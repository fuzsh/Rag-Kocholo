JOHN W. RUNYON, Chairman of the Board — CLYDE W. REMBERT, President REPRESENTED BY THE BRANHAM COMPANY Page 4 • July 2, 1956 Broadcasting • Telecasting closed circuit INSIDE, SENATE SIDE • Here's inside on Senate Commerce Committee's ap- proach to tv problem: Committee is revis- ing its planned interim report on allocations in light of FCC allocations report last week and hopes for full committee approval of new draft. It would comment on FCC re- port, praising FCC for finally acting and expressing hope Commission is serious about carrying through its proposals. Com- ments would indicate approval of some FCC proposals, doubt about others. Sen- ate report would replace planned interim reports by both majority and minority seg- ments of the committee. B»T ORIGINAL majority report (before FCC action) had recommended selective dein- termixture on broad enough scale to sup- port uhf and removal of 10% federal excise tax on all-channel sets or at least all-channel color sets. Report asked \"non- disruptive\" deintermixture: (1) keep vhf out of all-uhf markets; (2) hold back vhfs where not granted or not on air in uhf markets; (3) delete single on-air vhfs in uhf markets unless vhf provides only service for \"substantial\" number of homes, except for keeping balance between sole service to cer- tain remote areas and multiple service to more people in center of market area; (4) substitute vhf if possible for uhfs in two- vhf markets; (5) try to provide vhfs for areas overshadowed by big-city vhfs and where geographic and physical conditions argue for utilizing advantages of vhf. B»T NEW BRICKER APPROACH • Minority report urged FCC to declare policy to ( 1 ) move all tv to uhf in major part of country after finding uhf is technically mature enough to support tv system; (2) find gaps in uhf technology and sponsor crash pro- gram to fill them; (3) hold continuing pro- ceedings with comments during move; (4) authorize 5,000 kw for uhfs; (5) grant temporary \"stop-gap\" deintermixture to strengthen competition; (6) continue grant- ing uhfs and vhf consistent with (5). Re- port called for 5-8-year transition period and simultaneous uhf-vhf transmission to amortize equipment and sets and use of vhf-only for certain geographical condi- tions. Plan would turn remaining vhf band over to non-broadcast services. Both ma- jority and minority reports favored giving existing outlets priority at new grants. B»T WCAO Baltimore, acquired by Plough Inc. for $590,710 [B»T, March 26], has noti- fied CBS Radio it will cancel affiliation and go independent effective with contract ex- piration Dec. 6. CBS Radio is negotiating with other Baltimore outlets, it's under- stood, with likelihood that new affiliation will be announced within next few weeks. WHERE'S PAT? • With special presenta- tion reported to be one of most am- bitious that network ever prepared, Sly- vester L. Weaver Jr., NBC chairman of board, last week had series of quiet meet- ings with top executives of automotive companies in Detroit. Essence of his pres- entation is that makers of autos and parts cannot hope to put needed push behind sales without extensive use of tv advertis- ing. He's said to have renewed two ac- counts (A.C. Sparkplugs and United Motors) and to be hot on trail of new business. B«T IF AUTO MAKERS don't start jumping on tv bandwagon, they'll have only them- selves to blame. They're getting lot of original research these days from tv mis- sionaries trying to rid them of their ages- old newspaper bias, and they're due to get more. In addition to special auto studies revealed last week by TvB and ABC-TV (see stories page 35), NBC-TV is getting ready to break one conducted by Advertest Research and pointing up, like others, dealer preference for tv as means of getting prospects into show rooms. B«T NO BACKDOWN • While there's com- plete silence around NARTB headquarters about proposal of disgruntled group of tv code subscribers to form independent code unit, one thing is certain — association isn't scaring easily. Instead of letting up in an- nounced crackdown against persistent code violators, it's known that code staff is under orders to toughen up its monitoring and station-contact work. Most tv code activity is handled quietly, on person-to-person basis. Some code officials contend pub- licizing of any station revolt from ethical structure is just what tv needs to convince critics that document is really doing effec- tive job of raising calibre of telecasting. B»T HERSHEY Chocolate Corp., which since its founding early in century has never ad- vertised, may change its policy. Both J. Walter Thompson Co. and BBDO report- edly are preparing presentations for Penn- sylvania company to cover all media. LOOKING IN CHICAGO • Anomalous situation whereby WGN-AM cancels its affiliation with Mutual effective Aug. 31 [B«T, May 7] although it is minority stock- holder, has sent Mutual President John B. Poor searching for new affiliate or acquisi- tion of station. It's understood that over- tures were made to WJJD Chicago, owned by Plough Inc., for acquisition but was told that station was not for sale. Latest records show WGN Inc. to be 2.16% stockholder in MBS, but it's understood it disposes of that interest to General Tele- radio, MBS parent which holds 95.3%, upon disaffiliation. FINAL two days of hearings by Senate Commerce Committee in probe of tv net- works and uhf-vhf won't be held until sometime after July 9. Staff was shooting for that date at Chairman Magnuson's sug- gestion but ran into conflicting schedules. FCC testimony on its allocations report expected to occupy final day of sessions. B«T SLEEPER • Tucked away in FCC's new tv allocation report and order (see full text on perforated pages 91 to 97) is highly significant provision (No. 32) that could mean additional stations for number of markets without departing from engineer- ing standards. It is provision to measure spacings (mileage separations) from trans- mitter-to-transmitter, instead of main post office-to-post office. Latter is unrealistic since post office locations aren't necessarily in center of cities. T-to-t separations, on other hand, do what FCC originally in- tended anyway. B»T PRESSURE of committee legislative ac- tivity has caused Edward Jarrett, chief clerk of Senate Commerce Committee, to reverse his decision to become chief aide to J. Leonard Reinsch in handling of Chi- cago Democratic convention [B»T, June 18]. Mr. Jarrett originally had agreed to ac- cept appointment, with acquiescence of Chairman Magnuson (D-Wash.), but in- dications that Congress will remain in ses- sion until end of July, forced reversal. B»T STILL IN BALL GAME • Commodore E. M. Webster, whose term on FCC ended last Saturday, after nine years as commis- sioner and 47 years in government service, will retire from government but not from communications. While he will take short vacation, it is expected he will be avail- able for private consultancy at policy level, headquartering in Washington. He is ex- pert in marine, safety-of-life and communi- cations engineering, and during his 30 years in Coast Guard served several ten- ures as chief communications officer. B»T NATIONAL Women's Christian Temper- ance Union apparently believes there's more than one way to skin cat. Failing to get legislation passed this year to ban liquor advertising on radio-tv and other media, they've asked to testify before Sen- ate Commerce Committee in support of Bricker bill for network regulation. B»T GOTHAM BRANCH • Potent sniping at broadcasters, radio and tv alike, by organ- izations and all sorts of individual inter- ests may bring about long-planned move to open NARTB office in New York. This would be designed to strengthen relations with other media, business associations and advertising pursuits as well as to serv- ice large number of inquiries that origi- nate in New York.

Details of new programming, slated for 10 a.m. to 12 noon spot Mondays through Fridays and tentatively titled NBC Bandstand, were laid before NBC affiliates executives committee in all-day meeting Friday and will be presented to all NBC Radio affiliates by closed circuit at noon today (Mon.). Network officials said they definitely plan to start Bandstand July 30. It will be sold to advertisers on same basis as Weekday — in one-minute, 30-second, and six-second participations — and compensation to stations also will be on Weekday basis. There was some discussion of station com- pensation during meeting, participants said, but prospects of raising it were linked primarily to whether or not new programming revitalizes advertiser interest. There was no question of raising compensation merely because of CBS Radio's similar action few weeks ago [B«T, June 11, et seq.], authorities reported. Among name bands being considered for Bandstand, NBC said, are those of Dorsey Brothers, Benny Goodman, Guy Lombardo, May Tv Network Gross Up 21.4% Over 1955's MAY TV NETWORK gross time sales totaled $40,610,429, gain of 21.4% over May 1955 billings, Publishers Information Bureau re- ported Friday.

KXXL Sold for $125,000 KXXL Monterey, Calif., sold by Stephen A. Cisler to Pacific Ventures Inc. (among owners: Morton Downey, singer; H. G. Wells, manager, KOLO Reno), Reno, Nev., corporation. Price was $125,000. Transaction is subject to FCC approval. Blackburn-Hamilton Co. handled sale. KXXL operates on 630 kc with 1 kw and is daytime independent. Mr. Cisler recently sold KEAR San Francisco to David Segal, prin- cipal in Mid-America Broadcasting Co., for $500,000.

Bandstand idea attributed largely to William R. (Billy) Goodheart, show business veteran who joined NBC in May. Lester W. Lindow of WFDF Flint, Mich., chairman of affiliates executive committee, re- ported after meeting that his committee had presented to NBC officials \"a wide variety of views and opinions about radio broadcasting which had been received from the individual stations throughout the country. These were received with great interest by the network officials and were discussed and reviewed . . .\" Network delegation was headed by President Robert W. Sarnoff, who stressed commercial success of weekend Monitor (after which Week- day was patterned), and Board Chairman Syl- vester L. (Pat) Weaver Jr. Other participants included Charles R. Denny, vice president for owned stations and spot sales; Al Capstaff, ex- ecutive producer of Monitor, and Kenneth W. Bilby, vice president for public relations. Executive committeemen are Mr. Lindow; George Harvey, WFLA Tampa, Fla.; William Rines, WCSH Portland, Me.; Ben Larson, KDYL Salt Lake City; George Wagner, KFI Los Angeles; David Baltimore, WBRE Wilkes- Barre, Pa.; Leonard Reinsch, WSB Atlanta, and Harold Hough, WBAP Fort Worth. Crowell-Collier Announces Closing 'American Magazine' CROWELL-COLLIER Pub Co. announced Fri- day it will (1) cease publication of American Magazine with August issue, and ( 2 ) raise ad- vertising rates of Collier's and Woman's Home Companion, into which American's editorial content will be integrated starting with Sep- tember issues. Collier's and Companion rates go up 12%, and another 10% will be added to Collier's based on rise in guaranteed circulation from 3.7 million to 4 million per issue. C-C, which retains American title \"for use in another context in the future,\" explained de- cision by saying American's basic editorial functions are now \"overlapped\" by two others. Publisher Paul C. Smith said C-C's \"reorienta- tion-refocusing drive is taking us deeply into the television, radio and phonograph record business\" but that C-C's \"first order of the day\" will be to continue publishing national magazines. C-C has bought, subject to FCC approval, KFWB Hollywood, Calif.; KULA- AM-TV Honolulu, and Consolidated Television & Radio Broadcasters Inc. (Harry M. Bitner interests) in Indianapolis, Grand Rapids, Min- neapolis and Flint, for total of six radio and four tv stations [B»T, April 30, et seq.] Seeks Majority Control FCC Friday was asked to approve transfer of control of KMVI-AM-TV Wailuku, T.

C, to WRAL there. Peoria and Springfield grants forbade con- struction until outcome of pending deintermix- ture proceedings in those two cities (see alloca- tions story, page 27). Grant to WIRL Peoria sustained examiner's decision, was made on preferences given that station for local ownership, civic participation of principals, diversification of business inter- ests of principals, integration of ownership and management and diversification of media of mass communications. WIRL owned by Tim- othy W. Swain and lohn H. and Edward J. Altorfer. Losing applicant WMDB Peoria owned by Charles C. Caley, 66%%, and John E. Fetzer, 33 V3 % , who have other radio and tv interests. Reversing examiner in grant to WMAY Tv Inc. in Springfield, FCC found it to be preferred on grounds of broadcast experience of owners and integration of ownership and management. WMAY Tv Inc. owned 50% by WMAY that city and 28.5% by Lee Ruwitch (WTVJ [TV] Miami, Fla.). Losing applicant Sangamon Val- ley Tv Corp. is 40% owned by WTAX Spring- field. Sustaining examiner's initial decision, grant at deadline FAST FASHIONS IN WHAT was termed \"another example of the importance of television as a news medium,\" Peter Pan Foundations Inc. (bras and girdles), New York, announced it will sponsor Paris Fashion Preview on ABC-TV Aug. 29 (3:30-4 p.m. EDT) on same day that news of new Paris fall- winter fashions are carried in newspapers and magazines. Agency is Ben Sackheim, New York. Peter Pan spokesman added that Peter Pan sponsorship marks first use of net- work tv on major scale. He estimated that cost of filming fashions, plus expend- itures for time and talent, would run to about $100,000. to WRAL in Raleigh was predicated on integra- tion of ownership and management, diversifica- tion of business interests of principals and diversification of ownership of media of com- munications. In latter Commission accepted examiner's reasoning which held that WRAL should be preferred because it would give that station dominant tv station in Raleigh, leaving competitor WPTF with dominant radio station. Raleigh News & Observer, dominant printed media, owns 14% of WNAO-AM-FM-TV Raleigh (ch. 28). WRAL is owned by A. J. Fletcher and family. ELDON E.

Hauser Seeks Eureka Ch. 13 APPLICATION for ch. 13 at Eureka, Calif, (with studio at Humboldt), filed with FCC Fri- day by Carroll R.

Poller Would Buy WOPT (TV) As Subscription Tv Station APPLICATION to purchase ch. 44 WOPT (TV) Chicago, provided FCC will allow station to be operated on parttime subscription-tv basis, was filed with Commission Friday by Lou Poller, who early last month asked FCC to authorize pay-tv operation for his ch. 25 WCAN-TV Milwaukee [B«T, June 18]. Purchase of WOPT from WOPA Inc., en- tailed no cash and did not involve WOPA-AM- FM. If FCC approves purchase (this assumes approval of pay-tv plan), Poller firm (Tv Ex- hibitors of America) would issue WOPA Inc. 7Vi % of non-voting, Class B stock in WOPT, according to application. Proposed Chicago fee-tv operation would be similar to that envisioned for Milwaukee with 25% paid, 75% normal operation. Right Once, Sindlinger Again Predicts Sunday Duel SUBSTANTIATING prediction of Sindlinger & Co. that Steve Allen's first telecast opposite Ed Sullivan (June 24) would fail to attract half as many viewers as Sullivan [B*T, June 25], Sindlinger interviewers early last week found actual viewing in ratio of 67.8% for Sullivan to 32.2% for Allen. Pulse rated Sullivan 35.3, Allen 15.1; Trendex, Sullivan 24.6, Allen 13.3. Sindlinger Thursday estimated that Allen's sec- ond telecast (yesterday), would reduce audience ratio to three-to-two, 59.4% or 42,025,000 viewers for Sullivan, 40.6% or 28,766,000 for Allen.

Present hotels showed an average season occupancy of 93.3%, and some $40 million will be invested this year in new tourist facilities. Summer vacations are establishing remarkable new records. One airline experienced an 85% increase between April 15 and June 1 in package-vacation tours alone, while another predicts a 40% increase in all Miami trips during balance of summer. Railroads and bus lines are scheduling special trains and trips to carry greatly increased summer loads, greatest in Miami's history. The beautiful Miami skyline is familiar to most of the nation, but behind this lovely scene is an important industrial boom. The county now ranks first in Florida in industrial production, and a total of some $316 million in new projects (cement plants, aircraft industries, etc.) will solidify that position. While Florida's farm economy has been somewhat obscured by vacationland and industrial publicity, agriculture is an area of vast importance. The cattle industry ranks second in the nation, and the economic value to Dade County ( Miami) of all farming interests is in excess of $75 million per year. Deep channel port facilities bring ocean vessels (and voyagers) virtually to the center of Miami's downtown area, and cruise ships add their facilities to a greatly expanded transportation system. The University of Miami, possibly the nation's most modern, is Florida's largest with an enrollment of 11,077. The recent establishment of the state's first medical school at the University has provided added prestige. 114 MOVED IN TODAY Every day is \"moving-in\" day in Greater Miami. 42,000 new permanent residents in each of the past five years have stimulated phenomenal residential construction, and new- record tourist seasons keep hotel-motel construction at an equally high peak. 1956 public school enrollment increased 12.2% over 1955 and a $34 million bond issue will provide over 1,000 additional classrooms for next year's crop of youngsters. Greater Miami is enjoying an increased earning power generated by 249,000 non-agricultural jobs, while all-important retail sales moved up to a new level of over a billion dollars in '55 (a gain of 15.2% over 1954 against a national gain for the same periods of only 9.3%). \"Effective Buying Income\" is measured at over $134 bil- lion by Sales Management Magazine ($6,047 per family) in a population area of 744,000 as of January 1,1956. Federal Reserve \"Bank Debits,\" a reliable business yardstick, soared to a new high of over $6M billion in '55, a healthy 22.8% increase over '54 — and a remarkable 265% over '45. Serving this booming Florida market are two Storer Broadcasting Company stations: WGBS, a 50 kw CBS Network (radio) affiliate, and WGBS-TV. Both stations are enjoying new peaks in audiences and the widest cover- age in their respective fields. A strong merchandising service keeps pace with the rapidly expanding retail store development. Like all Storer stations, program policies of both WGBS and WGBS-TV make them \"local stations,\" while maximum power guarantees best reception through- out the entire Greater Miami area.

It was like taking candy from a baby, considering that the storyline of Anita Loos' play is and always has been incredibly complex and downright silly most of the time. If the play wasn't \"the thing,\" it probably was the idea of bringing to tv this Decameron night in a Newark tavern. The decision to do it must have been somewhat hard for the net- work and agency, beseiged as they are, by two opposing audience factions: the one demanding more sophisticated, mature tv; the other calling for more \"wholesome American family enter- tainment.\" Though the attractive Betty Field was handi- capped by too-appealing looks and clothes to be a prissy old maid, she still managed to im- press us as a frustrated dumpling having the time of her life on, under or astride the bar. Her performance was satisfactorily comple- mented by the colorcasting and the work of her supporting cast, notably, Barry Nelson, Enid Markey, Tina Louise, Bill Harrigan and Luella Gear.

CBS CARTOON THEATRE AS LIGHT (and lightweight) summer fare, CBS-TV's newest venture into cartoonland is not likely to create any stir around network quarters or any qualms in the Disneyland camp. Its June 20 CBS Cartoon Theatre offered viewers a group of Paul Terry cartoons, includ- ing Gandy Goose, Heckel and Jeckel, plus those two delightful hellions, Tom and Jerry, pieced together with pattern by Dick Van Dyke. He commented on the authenticity of historical characters, inserted a plug for The Adventures of Robin Hood (also a CBS-TV series) and gave water safety tips for the small fry. Mr. Van Dyke has a pleasant and smooth manner about him which, far from being condescending, ap- pears a bit too lofty for the juvenile audience. Slated opposite ABC-TV's full-hour Disney- land for the summer, Cartoon Theatre is not apt to win many viewers during the 7:30-8 p.m. slot, any more than Arthur Godfrey is during the second half of Disneyland. Nor is it likely to influence advertisers (Cartoon Theatre is aired on a limited CBS-TV network, sustain- ing). It's hard to envision it as a tv staple. This reviewer, an old Tom & Jerry fan, con- cedes that cartoons are popular, but isn't there a glut of them on tv already? And don't they belong on local stations instead of in prime network time? Production costs (gross): $25,000. Telecast June 20 by CBS-TV, 7:30-8 p.m. (EDT), sustaining. Announcer: Dick Van Dyke; producer: Michael Grilikhes; director: Howard Magwood; writer: Bill Dammie. THE STEVE ALLEN SHOW \"THE SAME old thing\" has no place in a Steve Allen format, as he has proved to nation- wide audiences for the past few years on the Tonight show. Now he's in the big time as time spots go — 8-9 p.m. Sunday — and as imag- inative as ever. Things got off to a properly informal start when the show opened on comic Jerry Lewis instead of Mr. Allen. Then the inevitable ap- pearance of Bob Hope to plug some movie (the name of which won't be mentioned here). Then some clever jibes at the opposing Ed Sullivan show. Then a bit of business where Steve played the piano while various scenes gave the viewer something to look at: a meat grinder, Skitch Henderson's head on a platter, etc. Hits of the show: The commercial parodies featuring \"testimonials\" by Dane Clark, Vin- cent Price and Wally Cox. Steve's routine with Kim Novak on \"teaching while you entertain\" television. The finale \"Death of the Blues\" duet with Steve and Sammy Davis Jr. Misses: The opening Davis Jr. routines. Not that they were bad, but Mr. Allen relinquished much too much time to the act. For a while it looked more like The Sammy Davis Jr. Show. Near miss: The rooftop ballet with Bambi Linn and Rod Alexander. It turned out to be interesting as novelty but poor as dance. Verdict: Results may not always be the most expert, but the show promises to be exciting. Production costs: Approximately $55,000. Sponsored on NBC-TV by Brown. & William- son Tobacco through Ted Bates & Co.; Avco Mfg. through Compton Adv.; Andrew Jer- gens through Robert W. Orr Assoc.; three out of four Sundays, 8-9 p.m. EDT.

SEEN & HEARD To meet NBC-TV's new challenge to his su- premacy in the Sunday evening 8-9 period, Ed Sullivan on June 24 celebrated his eighth anni- versary with 45 guests, practically all stars whose names are top flight audience attractions. True, most of them appeared only to take bows and join in a chorus of \"Happy Anniversary to You,\" but they were there, as promised. Moreover, unlike too many anniversary cele- brations, Mr. Sullivan and his producers did not neglect to have a show as well as greetings, with songs by Kate Smith, Teresa Brewer and Harry Belafonte, comedy by Jack Paar and — not forgetting his younger fans— a troupe of performing bears. In other words, it was just the type of show that has put Sullivan into his enviable position and we predict Steve Allen's going to have a tough time usurping his throne. Perhaps it's the heat that brought forth such talent last week in television. Whatever the cause, kudos are demanded for at least two of the week's performances: To Lorenzo Semple Jr., who wrote the script for Alcoa Hour's \"The Archangel Harrigan,\" a delightful fantasy about an Irish rogue who woos a Scottish miss in rural America. To John Drainie, whose por- trayal of \"Mr. Arcularis\" in Monday's Studio One Summer Theatre production of the same name was both spellbinding and supremely professional.

It is true that, until 1949, we charged a com- mission of 16%% on the net cost to us of time, space and other commissionable expenses. But in 1949 we changed to a straight 15% of the gross cost of time and space, and 15% of other commissionable expenses. This brought our charges exactly into line with those of othei agencies, although in billing for space and time we use a formula which permits us to receive our compensation from our clients rather than from media. This is in accord with our long- standing policy of making sure that, both actually and legally, we are working for the advertiser. If you would like some background on the reason for our 1949 change, here it is: Our 16%% of the net cost of space and time worked out as slightly less than the 15% of the gross charged by other agencies. Our 16%% of other commissionable charges was more than the charges made by other agencies. These differ- ences just about cancelled each other out until television, with its high production costs, be- came an important factor. At that point, in order to keep our charges in balance with charges made by other agencies, we dropped our policy of charging 16%% on the net and adopted the 15% system. Richard P. Powell, Vice President N. W. Ayer & Son Inc. Philadelphia, Pa. What's Newsworthy? EDITOR: In your June 18 issue you have published a report from Troy Knowles of the Helene Curtis Industries. On the subject of \"Free Plugs Supported, Says Cosmetic Company,\" Mr. Knowles was quoted as saying: \"The ques- tion of free versus paid time assumes that the only thing newsworthy is on a commercial.\" This remark is almost too absurd to warrant an answer. Mr. Knowles, suppose you try get- ting your so called \"free plugs\" or newsworthy notes to the various news services which serve radio. I feel sure that such accounts as Wrig- ley chewing gum and Coca-Cola do not evalu- ate their fine commercial copy, which in some cases has remained unchanged for years, as newsworthy. They want to sell merchandise and are willing to pay for it . . . J. M. McDonald, Gen. Mgr. KURV Edinburg, Tex. Vincent Hartnett, Researcher EDITOR: In the article, \"Faulk Sues AWARE for 'Blacklisting,'\" which appears on page 31 of the June 25 issue of your indispensable maga- zine, the following statement is attributed to me: \"I am hired by agencies, sponsors and net- works to look into the qualifications of persons they plan to use on radio and tv programs. Following my investigation, I find and report on any political activity in which the person under examination may have participated.\" This is not an accurate quotation of what I said over the phone to your able reporter. I did not use the word, \"investigation.\" I am not an investigator and have not the training or facilities to conduct investigations. I am a re- searcher. I have comprehensive files on com- munists and communist-fronters in the enter- tainment industry. What I said was that I \"check\" names proposed to me, to ascertain whether the individuals involved have or do not have records of affiliation of one kind or the other with the Communist Party or with communist \"fronts\" and causes. I did not use the phrase, \"political activity.\" I am not concerned with individuals' political activity. I am concerned about whether they did or did not engage in communist or pro- communist activity. The statement attributed to me in direct quotes was inaccurate and might well be dam- aging to me in my profession. I would appre- ciate your making a prompt correction. Vincent W. Hartnett New York Jeweled Coach EDITOR: Mr. Mack [Larry Mack, Slenderella presi- dent] has read the article, \"Radio: Jeweled Coach for Slenderella,\" in your June 4 issue and he has asked me to write and tell you how much he liked it.

Free Speech in Action EDITOR: On June 28 Santa Barbara radio station KIST will celebrate the second anniversary of its Free Speech program, which is unique in that [it affords listeners] free opportunity to [exercise that right]. By merely picking up the receiver at home, place of business or telephone booth and dialing Woodland 3981 at a given time, one is soon connected with a broadcasting medium whereby he or she is \"on the air.\" Any person's views on public matters or officials, one's innermost thoughts or convic- tions, are permitted (within propriety) and expressed on this Free Speech program. Par- ticipants include hundreds of citizens who have spoken, many more than once . . . Through the medium of this valuable pro- gram citizens have influenced public affairs in Santa Barbara City and County, as well as Cali- fornia State, as follows: ( 1 ) A long overdue special election for state senator in Santa Barbara County and vicinity, being thoroughly publicized on the program by citizens in 1955, had much to do with forcing Gov. Goodwin J. Knight to obey the state constitution by calling this election. (2) Free Speech was a large factor in Santa Barbara City whereby a majority of its speak- ers on the matter of a public golf course fa- vored same and a bond issue for this purpose was approved by the voters. (3) Discussions on traffic conditions, street improvements, education, taxes, city depart- ments and the general welfare of the people socially, culturally and at business and work have created much public interest and practical results. Free Speech is also a public forum — a meet- ing of the minds, so to speak. Controversial issues dealing with national and international affairs — with matters legal, moral, practical and ethical — of everyday living, have been presented and discussed pro and con. Harry C. Butcher, owner of KIST and origi- nator of the Free Speech program, his staff and moderators, are all to be congratulated on its moral success and achievements . . .

A beautiful and healthy 18, thanks largely to the good nutrition of Southern Cal- ifornia Radio. Since 1938 the Sally Shops have been a family enterprise of the Zuckermans; Ted and Marvin and their father, H. Lew. Their object: bring high fashion to the South- land at popular prices. Their meth- od: take the stores to the women in their residential neighborhoods. Foreseeing both the growth and the decentralization of Los Angeles, Sally harnessed the giant of adver- tising media, Radio, to carry the bulk of advertising. Morning news- casts and a half-dozen weekend five-minute programs are on KBIG. Spots are run on two other fine Los Angeles independents. Results? Sally Shops have grown from one small store to beautiful, modern fashion centers in 15 com- munities in Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino Counties. Sales have increased substantially every year. Says John Bainbridge, account ex- ecutive, The Lansdale Company Ad- vertising Agency: \"Radio has been our indispensable tool in making Sally's the 'Most Walked about Clothes in Town' ... by making them the 'Most Talked About'!\" Huge, sprawling, rich Southern California is reached best by radio : KBIG RADIO, for greatest cover- age at lowest cost-per-thousand. JOHN POOLE BROADCASTING CO. 6540 Sunset Blvd.. Los Angeles 28, California Telephone: Hollywood 3-3205 Nat. Rep. WEED and Company our respects to ROBERT WILFRED CARPENTER ALTHOUGH he had no particular affinity for driving an ice truck, Robert W. Carpenter, vice president in charge of station relations for MBS, had reason to believe as a youth that the feeling wasn't mutual — insofar as the ice truck was concerned. Twice during his career Mr. Carpenter guided such a vehicle on New Jersey highways because of the press of economic circum- stances. Today, as he busily criss-crosses the country several times a year attempting to keep some 500-odd Mutual affiliates happy, Mr. Carpenter can look backward and comment wryly: \"You can't beat those regular hours on the truck!\" Mr. Carpenter's arduous schedule as station \"trouble-shooter\" for the world's largest network might faze an individual with a less formidable basic training in hard work. Robert Wilfred Carpenter was born in Eliza- beth, N. J., on Sept. 30, 1909, one of six boys in a family that believed all youngsters should perform household chores. He grew up in Roselle Park, N. J., and was graduated from the local high school in 1928. Though Mr. Carpenter had set his sights on a college education, he had to defer his plans for lack of funds. He decided to work for a while, save some money and enter college at a later date. It was at this point that Mr. Car- penter had his experience in hauling ice. . Some months later, he switched to a factory job at the Western Electric Co. in Kearney, N. J., and later to one at the Ford Motor Co. plant in Edgewater, N. J. The arrival of the depression shattered Mr. Carpenter's hopes of attending college, and in the next four years, he worked at several jobs, including a second tour on the ice truck. Early in 1934, a friend tipped off Mr. Car- penter to a job opportunity that held promise of broadening his occupational vista: CBS was going to have an opening in its accounting de- partment in three months. Undismayed by his lack of background in accounting, Mr. Carpen- ter enrolled for a short course in accounting in the night division of the Drake Business Col- lege in Elizabeth. Armed with two months' worth of knowledge in accounting, he arranged for an interview for the job at CBS. He was hired by Samuel R. Dean, currently treasurer of CBS, as a clerk on the accounting staff. At CBS he displayed a penchant for figures as well as for administration. Three years after joining the network, he was promoted to comp- troller of WBT Charlotte, N. C, then a CBS- owned station. In 1940, he was moved to St. Louis as comptroller of KNOX, and in 1941, he was appointed account executive. In 1943, Mr. Carpenter responded to the war effort by joining the American Red Cross as an assistant field director. He served in various localities throughout the country and later was assigned to Morocco and Marseilles. At the end of the war, Mr. Carpenter re- turned to the U. S. and accepted an offer from Mutual in 1945 as southwestern manager of the station relations department in Oklahoma City. Three years later, Mr. Carpenter was advanced to eastern manager of the depart- ment, with headquarters in New York, and in 1953 was named assistant director of station relations. He was appointed director in March 1954 and last April was elevated to vice presi- dent in charge of station relations. As a veteran station relations official, Mr. Carpenter has come to know intimately the managers of the stations affiliated with Mutual. He estimates he spends about a third of his working time on the road, conferring with sta- tion executives on their problems and receiving suggestions from them on the ways Mutual can better serve its affiliates. \"We've gone up and down the land, asking our affiliates what they want from the net- works,\" Mr. Carpenter explained. \"Though the answers have been different, one pattern has emerged. We've found out that radio stations want these things from networks: news pro- grams— not spot news — but commentary and interpretation; good special events coverage; good national sports coverage; some \"who- dunits\" and drama. If that's what they want, that's what they'll get. Whether they pay us in dollars or oranges or time makes no difference.\" Mr. Carpenter's comment about payment re- ferred to Mutual's new affiliation contract [B»T, April 1 6], under which network option time was reduced from nine hours a day to an average of five hours a day. Affiliates were asked to \"pre-clear\" and carry without compensation some 16 hours of network programming a week in return for about 15 hours of programming, furnished free to the local station for local sales. Mr. Carpenter commented that the old contract form was \"obsolete\" and the new plan, which goes into effect on Nov. 1, is a blue-print that should work to the advantages of both the net- work and its affiliates. In 1933, Mr. Carpenter was active in amateur theatricals in Roselle Park, and appeared in a play opposite a young lady named Isabelle Struthers. Two years later they were married. The Carpenters, who live in Old Greenwich, Conn., have three children — Barbara, 20, a junior at the U. of Connecticut at Storrs, who recently was elected \"Campus Queen\" and presi- dent of the Women's Student Government Coun- cil; Robert, 17, and Heather, 15, both students at Greenwich High School. Mr. Carpenter is an avid reader. Though he prefers non-fiction books, he will read \"prac- tically anything I find\" in a hotel when he is on a business trip. He lists his hobbies as: work, golf, fishing, cabinet-making and bowling.

Roving assignments for B»T in past year took him 36,650 miles, had him inhaling the attar of gasoline in Texas, dodging flying chips in a High Sierra lumber mill, sampling Tillamook cheese, gaping at Wilson Dam turbines, eat- ing scrod in Boston, abalone on Catalina Is- land, Olympia oysters on Puget Sound and swordfish in Miami. Aside from a fondness for sea food and no air sickness, Frank boasts a well-traveled Swiss typewriter which may well symbolize B»T's editorial approach: Get it first hand and get it all. A radio-television trade magazine may be judged by the type of staffer who hits the road. Is he out selling advertising or is he out getting a story? Some books need only a scissors and paste-pot to \"cover\" the country; an edi- torial expense account for travel might include a couple of cross-town taxi fares, while the business of space selling uses 95% of their travel budget. *<aw*otY °l the c D on't get us wrong— there's noth- ing wrong with travel for space- selling. It's an essential part of the business of publishing a magazine. Our point is one of balance. Here at B*T our editors and reporters do plenty of traveling. Take Senior Editor J. Frank Beatty for example. He has traveled 36,650 miles in the past vear, making market studies in the Carolinas, the Gulf States, the Pacific Northwest, covering national advertiser meetings, digging into the impact of the Detroit newspaper strike, investi- gating uhf in Indiana and Pennsylva- nia, touring the major markets in Texas (and making an \"informal inspection in Las Vegas which yielded no story but proved that gambling doesn't pay ). Frank is one of 55 editors, writers, pro- duction experts and stringers who cover the world of radio and television for or Salesmen? B#T. It's a staff that puts out a book of 85,000 informative, informed and pertinent words a week. Raw material is 100,000 words a day that reach B*T Wash D C via AP, UP and B'T's own communications to bureaus in New York, Chicago and Hollywood, plus on-the-spot Congressional and FCC coverage. A recent survey* among 4,584 radio- television executives (42.2% replied) revealed that 90.4% read B#T regu- larly. Not only do they read it— if they could get only two of the seven publi- cations in the field, 82.1% would choose B*T as one of the two; 78.4% prefer B#T\"s weekly frequency; 57.1% list B*T as the publication in which an advertisement would have the most impact on them (runner up scored 18.7%). B'T's 77,440 readers every week find B#T indispensable. That's why B*T carried more pages of radio-tv advertis- ing (3,832) in 1955 than all other verti- cal publications in its field combined. *For a complete summary, write Executive and Publication Headquarters, Broadcast- ing^Telecasting, 173S DeSales St., N.W., Washington 6, D.

WRIGHT on all accounts AGENCY WORK has proved to be the \"happy combination\" of television and advertising at all media levels that Tom Wright first envi- sioned when he served as public relations rep- representative for NBC in tv's early days. Today, during the growth period of televi- sion, Mr. Wright describes his media group supervisor role at Leo Burnett Co., Chicago, as one of \"synthesizing a media plan upon marketing strategy.\" In that capacity he is re- sponsible for media recommendations in a Bur- nett client group that includes the Kellogg Co., Maytag, Tea Council and Campbell Soup Co. A native of Plainfield, N- J- (born March 18, 1919), Thomas A. Wright majored in jour- nalism at the U. of North Carolina and grad- uated with a B.A. degree in 1941. During the summers for two years (1939-40) he was a combination PR-guide representative for NBC at the New York World's Fair. After five years in the Marine Corps as ad- ministrative staff communications officer (he attained the rank of major), Mr. Wright set out to make advertising his career. Joining BBDO, Mr. Wright worked on every phase of agency tv operation from 1946 to 1951, preparing and planning budget presenta- tions for Hit Parade, Betty Crocker and other programs; developing programs and talent-time sales recommendations, and supervising con- tract preparations and negotiations. He also organized and staffed the tv traffic section and worked closely with studio producers. (Among his other credits: planning and placement of the Chiquita banana minute movie campaign for United Fruit Co.) At BBDO he was variously head of tv account service, business manager of the tv department and head of motion picture and tv film department. Mr. Wright left BBDO to join Dundes & Frank as vice president and radio-tv director with general agency assignments in 1951 and the following year became associated with NBC as account executive in radio and tv sales. Mr. Wright came to Burnett in September 1955 and now handles all media in his particu- lar account group. All four clients have been especially active in network and spot tv and one of them, the Tea Council, recently an- nounced a $248,000 spot television campaign in major cities. Burnett handles the Franco- American line, frozen soups, tomato juice and tomato catsup for Campbell. Mr. Wright married the former Christine Allen. They have three children — Laurinda, 10, Thomas Jr., 6, and Cynthia, 4 — and live in suburban Woodstock. His hobby is golf.

The FCC held out the possibility of moving all television — or those assignments in a major geographic area — to the uhf band in the un- specified future. It also proposed to deintermix 13 markets immediately and it raised the uhf maximum for power to 5 million watts and revised its mile- age separations standards from city-to-city to transmitter-to-transmitter. The prospective move of television to the uhf band was predicated on the hope that uhf propagation and equipment can be improved to more nearly equal that of vhf. * The deintermixture proposals — which do not become final until after the Commission has studied comments and counter-comments and probably heard oral argument — were issued with the idea of equalizing competitive facili- ties in the 13 markets. Some were authorized on slim four to three votes. Comments on the deintermixture proposals were requested by Sept. 10; on the long range plan by Oct. 1. Comr. John C. Doerfer issued a general dis- sent to the entire report, and most emphatically to the proposals to deintermix the 13 cities. Comr. Richard A. Mack urged that no moves be made now until the long-range project was completed. Other commissioners expressed varying views on separate items of the report. But, even as the industry was studying the document, the Commission went ahead and approved vhf grants in Peoria and Springfield. 111. — two of the prospective deintermixture cities. The grants were made to WIRL Peoria (ch. 8) and WMAY Tv Inc., Springfield (ch. 2). but forbidding construction and conditioned on any changes which might take place in the channels assigned after the proposed rule- making is concluded. The FCC also finalized the grant of ch. 5 to WRAL Raleigh, N. C. Reaction from broadcasters and manufac- turers was slow in coming. However, some comments were made late in the week by: Committee for Competitive Television: CCT said the Commission's proposals offer a \"prom- ising blueprint\" for establishing an all-channel television system. \"It now remains to be seen whether the Commission will develop the sys- tem according to the plan.\" CCT called on the Commission to refrain from granting vhf chan- nels in the 13 areas proposed to be deinter- mixed. It added that \"failure to do this would virtually nullify the deintermixture proposal.\" It also urged as \"mandatory\" that the Com- mission immediately institute proceedings to shift vhf to uhf channels in these markets \"in order that the deintermixture proposal may become deintermixture in reality.\" Radio-Electronic-Television Mfrs. Assn. had no comment on the proposals, but one uniden- tified manufacturer was quoted as saying that \"The FCC has just laid a great big egg. This will change nothing.\" Another set maker expressed doubt that anything substantial would be decided for an- other year. \"Maybe we\"ll get a final ruling by next June or July,\" he said. The Senate Commerce Committee, it was understood, instructed its counsel, Kenneth Cox, to study the Commission's action and make any required changes in its own proposed report on the subject. Individual Senators were reported to have expressed satisfaction that the FCC had finally acted. The committee held hearings on allocations earlier this year. Benedict V. Cottone, counsel to the Uhf Industry Coordinating Committee: Mr. Cottone declared that uhf operators must be gratified that the Commission has accepted the principle of deintermixture. However, he felt \"keen dis- appointment\" that the FCC refused to permit vhf squeeze-ins with lower power and antenna heights at reduced mileage separations. Other reactions were varied. Telecasters who stood to be hurt were naturally resentful; those who stood to benefit were happy. Most observers were certain that the long range plan was at least three years from any sort of start. It will be that long, engineers and attorneys felt, before any development pro- gram could attain worthwhile improvements bringing them to the level of vhf.

Broadcasting • Telecasting JUfy 2, 1956 e Page 27 the consensus of some broadcasters and Wash- ington attorneys that final decisions on these 13 cases would not be reached before the end of this year, or early in 1957. They also felt that there probably would be only three or four cities actually deintermixed. And, it was point- ed out, there were bound to be appeals to the courts which would stretch out the completion of these cases at least another year. Some observers noted that Comr. Webster's place would be taken by T. A. M. Craven (who takes office today). A change in one vote, it was pointed out, would reverse five out of the 13 proposed deintermixtures. The allocations proceeding was begun Nov. 10, 1955, when the FCC denied a group of deintermixture peti- tions. The Commission said then that the question had be- come nationwide in scope and could not be resolved on an in- dividual basis. Prior to that time the FCC had been called on to deintermix some 30-40 cities. It held an oral argument on five of these cases and then decided in its November ruling that a general, overall allocations proceeding was required. The allocations proceeding drew more than 500 comments, plans, suggestions and counter comments. It was the subject of almost weekly Commission meetings since the end of April. At various times it had been reported that the Commission favored \"selective deintermix- ture,\" large-scale deintermixture, division of the country into an eastern uhf area and a western combination uhf-vhf area, and no change in present principles of allocations assignments. It is known that at one time recently the Commission was ready to issue its long range proposal and invite individual comments on specific deintermixtures [B»T, June 11]. Television began commercial operations in 1941 when the FCC allocated 18 channels in the 50-294 mc band. In 1945, the television spectrum was contracted to 13 channels in the band from 44 mc to 216 mc, and fm broad- casting moved up to its present 88-108 mc. The following year, ch. 1 (44-50 mc) was deleted from the television band and allocated for industrial, public safety and transportation services. It was in 1945 that the Commission said that the 13 (now 12) vhf channels were in- sufficient for a nationwide, competitive televi- sion service, and that tv must expand in uhf. In 1952, following the four-year freeze, the COMPLETE TEXT OF FCC REPORT AND ORDER IS IN THIS ISSUE, BEGINNING ON PAGE 91 uhf band (470-890 mc) was opened to com- mercial tv operation. Within a year, it was apparent that uhf sta- tions, particularly where they faced competition from vhf outlets in the same communities, were in trouble. Heart of the problem was the. fact that in vhf areas, viewers refused to spend the $50-$75 necessary to convert their receivers. In addition to this, uhfs technical disadvantages led advertisers and networks to prefer vhf affilia- tion. Since July 1952, when television application processing was resumed by the FCC, more than 300 commercial uhf grants have been made. As of today there are 94 uhf stations operating. More than 130 uhf grantees have returned their permits, while the others have retained their construction permits awaiting the Commission's decision on uhfs future. In issuing last week's ruling, the Commission denied various proposals that would have per- mitted vhf squeeze-ins at reduced mileage separations, to drop the table of allocations and decide applications on a case-by-case basis, to permit antennas in Zone 1 to be 1,250 ft. above average terrain. In discussing the possibility of moving tele- vision to the uhf band, the Commisison declared that this would have many advantages: there would be equality of competition among all sta- tions; there would be no problems of receiver incompatability, and more stations would be built and successfully operated. Also, said the FCC, the vacating of the vhf band would open up space for the growing needs of other, non-broadcast services. The Commission asked that comments be supplied on what use might be made of the vhf band if it is decided to move television to chs. 14-83. In this connection, the FCC wondered whether 30-60 mc should not be set aside for ionsospheric scatter communica- tions and whether the lower vhf band might not be utilized by the mobile services. This is considered one of the most dangerous elements in the FCC's document. Key to any changeover, the Commission em- phasized, was uhfs capability to serve as well as vhf does. This means, the FCC said, that uhf transmitters, receivers and antennas must be upgraded. At present, uhf stations suffer in comparison with vhf outlets in lesser coverage, with prob- lems of shadow areas, and in the requirement for higher powers to adequately serve their markets. Uhf receivers also are more expensive and less sensitive and selective than vhf sets. Receivers are more noisy than comparable vhf receivers, while positioning of antennas also is considered more critical than for vhf. The Commission urged that a program of THE PROPOSED-TO-BE-DEINTERMIXED THIRTEEN THERE are 13 cities which have been tapped by the FCC for deintermixture — more or less. It is these cities — some of which were proposed to be made all uhf, some all or heavily vhf, and some with a single vhf operating station remaining in a sea of uhf assignments — about which pro- posed notices of rule making were issued last week. Comments requested by Sept. 10. The cities, and the proposals: Elmira, N. Y. — All uhf by deleting ch. 9 and adding ch. 30. This would give Elmira chs. 18, 24 and 30. Comrs.

Page 28 • July 2, 1956 Broadcasting • Telecasting ADVERTISERS & AGENCIES research and development — along the lines of the crash program recommended by Chairman McConnaughey to the NARTB convention last April — be instituted for uhf. Among its goals, the FCC stated, must be the increasing of uhf transmitter power, the use of boosters and satellites to fill in shadow areas, and the im- provement of uhf receivers and antennas. A transition period — 10 years has been sug- gested— was referred to by the Commission as one means of accomplishing the changeover. The FCC stated that there might be a period of time when vhf stations would ODerate simul- taneously on uhf. It also declared that there might be a cutoff date for vhf broadcasting. This transition period must be long enough, the FCC stated, to cover the useful life of vhf- only receivers in the hands of the public, and to permit vhf stations to amortize existing trans- mitting equipment. Congress might legislate tax relief and it also might ban interstate shipment of tv re- ceivers without uhf bands, the Commission sug- gested. This would be for the purpose of in- ducing the manufacture of uhf receivers. There have been suggestions that the price differential between vhf-only receivers and those with uhf be ameliorated by deleting the 10% excise tax on uhf-equipped television sets. Con- gressional tax committees have never accepted this proposal. As part of its discussion of interim measures (deintermixture in the 13 cities), the Commis- sion spelled out the considerations it would apply for favorable action. Standards for Change Standards for deleting a vhf allocation from a city should include such items as ( 1 ) the num- ber of people losing service, (2) how many uhf stations operate in the area, (3) the degree of uhf set conversion, and (4) terrain factors. Where an additional vhf channel is sought to be moved into an area, the Commission said these criteria would apply: (1) meeting trans- mitter-to-transmitter mileage separations, and (2) why the prospective community needed the assignment more than the community from which the vhf wavelength was to be taken. In both instances, the Commission said, the overall effects of these moves would be con- sidered as they relate to the goal of more effec- tive competition among stations. Buried in the FCC document was an allusion to the fact that the 13 cities proposed to be de- intermixed were not all which the Commission was considering. There are, it was learned, about 30 deintermixture petitions pending FCC action. It was possible, it was understood, that the Commission might report out a few more notices in the next few weeks. Also, in its order, the FCC virtually invited other such petitions. Methods of computing coverage of vhf and uhf stations were spelled out in the Commis- sion's document. This was for those seeking deintermixture changes in order to meet the standards set out. These computations must be based, the FCC said, on 1,000-ft. antenna height, maximum power and transmitter loca- tion near the center of the city to be served. According to some engineering sources, the FCC has revised its mileage tables, bringing uhf nearer the equivalent of vhf in theoretical coverage. These same sources pointed out that the Commission was still working on averages, rather than permitting showing to be made on actual measurements in individual cases. The Commission, however, declared that other data, based on other assumptions, would be accepted if submitted. This would be in addition to the information required under its criteria. RADIO, TV, OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA REPORTED FACING GREATEST CHALLENGE Delegates to 53d annual convention of Advertising Assn. of the West in Los Angeles are told by principal speakers of new demands in an expanding economy, where automation has been so successful in destroying manufacturing bottlenecks. TELEVISION, radio and the other major ad- vertising media are facing the greatest sales challenge of their history in the basic revolution taking place in retail marketing today, some 1,000 delegates to the 53d annual convention of the Advertising Assn. of the West were told in Los Angeles last week. The demands on media of a rapidly expand- ing economy, where automation has broken the traditional manufacturing bottleneck and shifted the burden of continued business growth in- stead to mass distribution and consumption, were highlighted by several keynote speakers. Others pointed out that media are being given be afforded new opportunities to prove them- selves as advertisers traditionally linked with older channels of consumer communication adapt themselves to the new marketing situation. Speakers were divided, however, on the ex- tent of aggressiveness or superlative appropriate in ad copy although agreeing that the sales prob- lem, medium and prospects should govern. John Karol, vice president in charge of net- work sales for CBS Radio, the only broadcaster on the agenda, told a Tuesday luncheon meeting that all major media are good media when used correctly but that radio, for instance, has the extra attribute of personal persuasion as well NEW OFFICERS of the Advertising Assn. of the West, elected at last week's convention in Los Angeles, are (I to r) Burt Oliver, vice president of Foote, Cone & Belding, Los Angeles, treasurer; Earl J. Glade Sr., public relations executive and former mayor of Salt Lake City, president; John Hoefer, co-founder of Hoefer, Dieterich & Brown, San Francisco, senior vice president; Mrs. Ella Breazeale, assistant cashier of the Valley National Bank, Tucson, Ariz., vice president at large, and Eugene M. McKim, director of advertising for Western Farm Life, Denver, Colo., secretary. more and more total sales responsibility — not just a role of pre-sales conditioning — as the concept of self-service retailing spreads and does away with the human link with the consumer, the clerk or salesman at the place of purchase. The expectation that color tv will capture new local retail dollars, traditionally poured heavily into newspaper advertising, also was voiced. Held Sunday, June 24, through last Wednes- day at the Hotel Statler. the convention of representatives from major agencies, media and advertisers in the 1 1 western states was marked for its general lack of specific \"pitches\" for any one advertising medium. Rather, speakers brought attention to the growing awareness that the bigger sales demands being placed on ad- vertising call for integrated and more effective use of all media, indicating that radio-tv will as other unique qualities. Addressing himself to the women delegates and the wives of the men also present, Mr. Karol noted that the purchasing power of the American woman today is such that any time an advertiser forgets or ignores her importance he will soon find out that the \"hand that rocks the cradle can just as easily rock the boat.\" \"In virtually every product category, you are the goal,\" Mr. Karol told his feminine listeners. \"You are the reason for almost every product innovation and every ad in print and on the air. You are the subject of endless research. Your marrying age, your employment status, your shopping days, your color preferences, your con- victions about calories, cigars, hard water, foam rubber and form fit — all these things are of un- believably great importance to American busi- ness. \"It is the same story in selecting advertising Broadcasting Telecasting July 2. 1956 Page 29 DISCUSSING color tv exhibition presented at CBS Television City, Hollywood, for the AAW convention are (I to r), Nelson Carter, vice president of Foote, Cone & Belding and retiring president of Los Angeles Advertising Club, convention host; Howard Meighan, CBS-TV vice president in charge of western division; William Lodge, CBS-TV vice president in charge of general engineering, who also demonstrated Ampex tv tape recorder to delegates; Frank Samuels, CBS-TV Pacific sales manager, and Russel Eller, advertising manager of Sunkist growers and convention program chairman. media. Will the life span of a four-color ad in a woman's magazine carry more, or less, im- pact that the greater frequency of radio com- mercials in the framework of believability of a daytime serial? Will the costly glamour of big- audience nighttime television produce more, or fewer, sales than a double truck in a general magazine? Even as prejudiced as you might believe me to be, I admit freely that no one medium for any given product is likely to be the perfect answer in reaching you and con- vincing you.\" Mr. Karol emphasized, \"I must go on the record, however, as saying that the low-cost combination of reach and frequency that good radio provides, both locally and on a network basis, gives it a unique status among media. It cannot, of course, claim the exclusive privilege of moving women to buy Brand A over Brand B. \"Actually, the choice of a media depends to a large degree on the psychology behind the copy approach. Which, for example, would impress you most? A picture of a new shade of lipstick, or a voice telling you what this new shade of lipstick will do for you. Without minimizing the value of pictures and copy to be read, I believe that for many products, it's what they will do for people that is most im- portant. And I think advertisers tend to over- look this. There is no fact of selling so im- portant as one person talking to another — tell- ing the prospect what a product or service will do for the potential buyer.\" The CBS Radio executive felt manufacturers and agencies sometimes fail to match the product to the needs of the consumer and \"sheep-like\" copy other advertising. \"The eye- patch for shirts, the animal for liquor, the man's man for cigarettes,\" he cited, commenting that \"imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but we're not in the business of flattering each other; we're in the business of selling goods and services. \"There is too often apt to be a similar pattern in media selection. Some of you remember when radio burst on the advertising scene and became the great glamour medium. The fact that radio was a fine new selling tool should not have detracted from the fact that newspapers and magazines and comics and the rest were also still good. \"In our growing economy we can use more ways of communicating with the consumer. We must keep our perspective. We're going through — actually, we're most of the way through — a similar situation with television. It has taken time to absorb this new glamour medium. Now, more and more advertisers have reached conclusions as to what tv can do and cannot do and we are finding that, again, all media are settling into their proper places to be used singularly and in combination to produce the best results for the particular product.\" Problems of selling to women and a defense of the excited adjective in radio-tv and other copy were set forth in a talk before another session of the convention by William G. Werner, director of public and legal services, Procter & Gamble Co. His theme was \"Four Guideposts in Adver- tising\": good, pre-tested products, fully support- able claims, scrupulous regard for the law and a constant concern for public opinion. Reviewing in detail the research and labora- tory testing of products before they are pre- sented to the public, Mr. Werner said that \"when it comes to translating provable product facts into pleasing, persuasive advertising, how- ever, we need more than a tabulation of points of superiority.\" Two problems in advertising creation appear here, the P&G executive said, both tied up with the word \"supportability.\" One is that a firm like P&G must sell to women and the second concerns \"the strength and steam of our com- petition.\" Comparing the \"quiet\" approach of ethical medical advertising to that of selling to women, Mr. Werner said \"if advertising is to be per- suasive to the fullest possible measure with our lady-folk, it cannot talk to them in a strictly logical and technical tone of voice. It must contain superlatives. It should sound excited and convinced — carry on in a way that a serious male critic of advertising might not like.\" Quoting what he considered typical woman- to-woman conversation, Mr. Werner continued, \"No advertising on earth could begin to match the hyperbole that the average woman hears and bubbles forth in an hour over the bridge table. What then is wrong with talking to women in advertising in the sort of language they know best?\" Observing that it is mostly \"professional critics\" who take exception \"to the strength of such enthusiastic claims and th"
