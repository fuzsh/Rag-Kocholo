        "text": "With the addition of a three hour talk show every weekday on its sister stations, CityNews flagship CFTR-680 Toronto is now the only All News station operated by Rogers. Details on the individual stations can be found below.\n\nAll times listed are Eastern Standard Time (EST).\n\n570 ON Kitchener CKGL Departing from its All-News format, CityNews Kitchener 570 will join most\n\nother Rogers CityNews stations airing a new national talk show, “Now You Know with Rob Snow”, weekdays from 1300-1600, beginning November 20th.\n\n570 SK Swift Current CKSW Swapped Formats with its FM sister station and now airs Classic Hits. Like CJSL-1150, CFSL-1190 and CJSN-1490, the change occurred on November 15th at 0700.\n\n580 ON Windsor CKWW Neeti P Ray has now been revealed by the CRTC as the potential buyer that owner Bell mentioned last June when it shut down many of its other AM stations.\n\n660 AB Calgary CFFR Now departs from its All-News format on weekdays from 1300-1600 for a national talk show with Rob Snow.\n\n680 ON Toronto CFTR Several Toronto area listeners are reporting that the station has been running low power (or an altered directional pattern) for all or part of the Overnights most days recently, occasionally going Open Carrier or possibly off the air completely.\n\n800 SK Moose Jaw CHAB “Rob Carnie in the Morning” has expanded its reach to include simulcasting on CKSW-570, CJSN-1150, CFSL-1190, CFYM-1210 and CJYM-1330.\n\n820 ON Hamilton CHAM Neeti P Ray has now been revealed by the CRTC as the potential buyer that owner Bell mentioned last June when it shut down many of its other AM stations.\n\n1130 BC Vancouver CKWX Now departs from its All-News format on weekdays from 1300-1600 for a national talk show with Rob Snow.\n\n1150 ON Hamilton CKOC Neeti P Ray has now been revealed by the CRTC as the potential buyer that owner Bell mentioned last June when it shut down many of its other AM stations.\n\n1150 SK Estevan CJSL Swapped Formats with its FM sister station and now airs Classic Hits.\n\n1190 SK Weyburn CFSL Swapped Formats with its FM sister station and now airs Classic Hits.\n\n1210 SK Kindersley CFYM Now simulcasts CHAB-800’s Morning Show.\n\n1260 AB Edmonton CFRN Permanently off the air since June, the two towers, one tall, one short, and the related buildings were removed from the former transmitter site during the past week. Now within Edmonton City Limits, the 10 acre site is worth millions, being adjacent to a recently built residential neighbourhood and across the street from a school and another neighbourhood.\n\n1310 ON Ottawa CIWW Although no longer on the air, CityNews Ottawa continues as a smartphone App, including the live streaming of the new national talk show, “Now You Know with Rob Snow”, weekdays from 1300-1600.\n\n1330 SK Rosetown CJYM As part of its simulcast of CFYM-1210, CJYM will also simulcast CHAB-800’s Morning Show.\n\n1490 SK Shaunavon CJSN Switched Formats from Country to Classic Hits, at the same time as sister station CKSW-570.\n\n1650 ON Mississauga CINA Owner Netti P Ray hopes to buy former Bell stations CKWW, CHAM and CKOC, after Bell accepted his offer of $445,000 for the three stations, which is about $322,500 US dollars. Adding assumed leases, the full value of the transaction works out to $772,219.20 Canadian. The CRTC will hold a virtual hearing on the station purchases on February 8 2024. Mr Ray already owns CKFG-FM Toronto and CINA-FM Windsor, as well as CINA-1650. CINA AM and FM both air mainly ethnic programming.\n\nDan Sys found a review of current CRTC Radio Regulations that indicates that both CHAM-820 and CKOC-1150 could air 40% ethnic programming 0600-2400 daily and 100% 0000-0600 with their existing licenses because Hamilton does not currently have a licensed ethnic station. The percentage drops to 15% for CKWW-580 because Mr. Ray’s own CINA-FM is a licensed ethnic station in Windsor. Of course, he may have other plans as his CKFG-FM is FLOW 98.7, playing Hip Hop and R&B, a brand and music format that he purchased from Stingray, which previously aired them on CFXJ-FM Toronto."
