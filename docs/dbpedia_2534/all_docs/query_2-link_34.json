With more than 500 radio stations participating, spanning different markets, regions, and formats, A DAY TO LISTEN aimed to leverage the power of radio to enact real change and begin to set a course for a more equitable future.\n\nThe mission of DWF is to create a pathway towards reconciliation, and to improve the lives of Indigenous people by building awareness, education, and connections between all Canadians.\n\nFull interviews are available below."
