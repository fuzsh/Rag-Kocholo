        "text": "RADIO/AUDIO/PODCAST:\n\nThe 2019 Canadian Podcast Listener (CPL) study finds that more than 40% of podcasting’s share of listening time is new media time. While traditionally radio measurement has focused on a system where only one station can ‘win the minute’ (or quarter-hour) and get credit for the listener’s attention, the study found that because podcasts enable listeners to start and stop when needed, they are well-suited to fill in gaps in media consumption throughout the day. 56% of listeners indicated that other audio media is most likely to be affected by podcast listening, but video, social and print are also being impacted: 26% of podcast listeners say that podcasts are carving into the time they spend with AM/FM; 22% say podcasts are replacing time spent with non-radio music (mp3s, streaming, etc.); and 9% say that they are listening to fewer audio books now that they’re listening to podcasts.

For the past five years, the station was operating as 98.9 The Goat – World Class Rock. Originally launched in 1959 as 1140 AM, the station has gone through several incarnations, moving to the FM dial in 1999 as Magic 98.9 when it adopted an Adult Contemporary format. It was rebranded to 98.9 The Goat in 2005 and took on an Active Rock sound. As part of the rebrand, former hosts Pete Montana and Robyn have also returned to mornings.\n\nCorus Entertainment is going to court to seek an injunction that would prohibit Harvard Broadcasting from using the POWER 107 brand in Edmonton or any name that includes the word POWER, including domain name power107.ca. Set to be heard in a Calgary court Nov. 8, the case centres around Corus’ former POWER 92 Top 40 station. While the station rebranded in 2004, Corus is alleging that Harvard’s CJNW-FM has not only adopted the name, but its distinctive black and white branding and ‘phrase that pays’ contesting slogan. Harvard rebranded Hot 107 to POWER 107 this past August. Harvard’s statement of defence says Corus has no legal claim to the Power brand.\n\nSiriusXM is now available on Google Nest smart speakers and displays via the Google Assistant. Users will see SiriusXM programming in the Google Home app, available on iOS and Android devices. Subscribers will be able to ask the Google Assistant to play a SiriusXM channel by saying, for example, “Hey Google, play The Beatles Channel on SiriusXM.” Later this year, subscribers with a Nest Hub will also be able to watch SiriusXM video, giving them access to a selection of video clips curated specifically for the Google Assistant that will allow them to see exclusive in-studio performances, interviews and other behind-the-scenes moments at SiriusXM. SiriusXM also plans to offer SiriusXM Select, SiriusXM All Access and SiriusXM Essential Streaming subscriptions at promotional rates that will be bundled with a Google Nest Hub.\n\nThe Radio Hall of Fame will recognize syndicated personalities Brooke Fox and Jubal Fresh, hosts of Brooke & Jubal in the Morning as this year’s recipients of the “One to Watch” award. Originating from Movin’ 92.5 (KQMV-FM) Seattle, Brooke & Jubal are heard on more than 50 stations, including Corus Radio’s Jump 106.9 Ottawa, Energy 95.3 Hamilton, and 92.5 The Chuck Edmonton. Created last year in honour of radio legend Art Laboe, the “One to Watch” award is given to a promising radio personality or team that has demonstrated ratings success, audience growth, and impact on one or more radio stations and their communities.\n\nRadioplayer is expanding to more countries and is currently working with Spanish broadcasters to launch Radioplayer España, making hundreds of Spanish stations available on the Radioplayer España iPhone and Android apps, on the web player, in the Alexa skill, on Sonos and BOSE speakers, Google Cast, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Smart Device Link, and many more automotive and in-home integrations. In addition, Spanish stations will join the international Radioplayer data feed which powers the hybrid radio interfaces in many Audi, VW and Porsche cars, and can switch automatically between DAB, FM, and streaming, to keep listeners locked in to their favourite radio stations. Spain is the 12th country to join the Radioplayer family, along with Canada, the UK, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Norway, Belgium, Switzerland, Peru, and Denmark, with Italy about to launch.\n\nQuebecor’s QUB Radio has released French-language true crime podcast, Synthèses, revisiting the 2001 unsolved homicide of Sherbrooke resident Louise Chaput. Chaput, 52, was crossing the Canada-US border alone to hike Mount Washington. The psychologist’s body was found a week later buried under a pile of branches on the edge of a forested path. The podcast reviews the investigation conducted by New Hampshire State Police and tries to understand how a murder in broad daylight, on a U.S. tourist trail, remains unresolved.\n\nThe 11th annual Pharmasave Radiothon for Healthcare, broadcast on Golden West Broadcasting’s Swift Current stations, raised more than $155,000 on Nov. 1. The 15-hour event, heard on CKSW 570, Magic 97.1 (CKFI-FM), and The Eagle 94.1 (CIMG-FM), raised funds towards the Dr. Noble Irwin Regional Healthcare Foundation and its Close to the Heart Campaign which has a goal of buying a new digital mammography unit.\n\nCountry 100 (CILG-FM) Moose Jaw hosted a Paws For Pledges Radiothon on Nov. 1 that raised $108,520 to help animals in need in the city. The event has raised a total of $649,541 since 2013.\n\nFEATURE: Canadian Dom Nero is the featured imaging producer in this week’s blog from Benztown CEO Andy Sannemann.

Born in St. Catharines, ON, Slade moved to England with his family as a child. Upon his return to Canada, he worked as an Air Canada as a steward before pursuing acting. Slade started his career as an actor in repertory theatre in England and at the Garden Center Theatre in Vineland, ON. He headed to Hollywood In the mid-1960s, where he found success writing TV sitcoms at Screen Gems, including Bewitched. That led to ABC series Love on a Rooftop and The Flying Nun. Slade would go on to create The Partridge Family and Bridget Loves Bernie. He was also behind the script for 1972 film Stand Up and Be Counted, starring Jacqueline Bisset. In 1975, Slade returned to the theatre with his hit play Same Time, Next Year, with Charles Grodin and Ellen Burstyn in the leads. The play earned Slade a Tony Award nomination. That was followed by the less successful Tribute, with Jack Lemmon in the lead, and then Romantic Comedy, starring Anthony Perkins and Mia Farrow. Slade went on to write the screenplays for the film versions of all three plays, and was nominated for an Oscar for his screen adaptation of Same Time, Next Year.\n\nRick Staehling, 73, on Oct. 25. Staehling was a film critic on CBC Radio One in Vancouver for more than three decades. He started at the public broadcaster in 1971 as a graphic designer.
