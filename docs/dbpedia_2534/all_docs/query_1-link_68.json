        "text": "Charlie,\n\nI noticed this message and wanted to listen... BUT: We are not a part of the CWB!\n\n\"Newsroom\n\nThe CWB report\n\nOn May 13, CWB weather analyst Stuart McMillan discusses the U.S. winter wheat outlook and his recent crop surveillance tours to Oklahoma. \"The CWB Report\" airs on Goldenwest Radio stations across the Prairies. Join the CWB and farm broadcaster Kelvin Heppner on Wednesdays for 12 weeks during the seeding and harvest seasons. This four-minute interview features CWB experts sharing current information with producers on topics such as crop outlooks and CWB programs. Successful farming comes down to what you know about what you grow.\n\nThe show runs on:\n\nCHRB 1140 High River, AB at 1:21 p.m.\n\nCFYM 1330 Kindersley, SK at 2:06 p.m.\n\nCJYM 1330 Rosetown, SK at 2:06 p.m.\n\nCFSL 1190 Weyburn, SK at 12:28 p.m.\n\nCJSL 1280 Estevan, SK at 12:38 p.m.\n\nCKSW 570 Swift Current, SK at 5:55 p.m.\n\nCJSN 1490 Shaunavon, SK at 5:55 p.m.\n\nCFAM 950 Altona, MB at 1:49 p.m.\n\nCHSM 1250 Steinbach, MB at 1:49 p.m.\n\nCJRB 1220 Boissevain, MB at 1:49 p.m.\n\nCFRY 920 Portage la Prairie, MB at 1:45 p.m.\"\n\nhttp://www.cwb.ca/public/en/newsroom/report/\n\nAre there any radio stations in Northern Alberta that are part of the GoldenWest network?\n\nIs the weekly commentary in question paid for by the CWB or is a public service announcement arranged for and paid for by GoldenWest? And if so, does GoldenWest have the exclusive rights to the broadcast?\n\nIf not were any radio stations in Northern Alberta approached to carry the information? If so why did they not do so? No time available when the CWB felt farmers were listening? Costs much higher than Golden West? .....\n\nHow much of GoldenWest does the CWB own as you claim?\n\nDear Charlie,\n\nWHY DOES the CWB keep the dollars for \"carry in the market\"?\n\nIE Dec 09 vs Mar 10 Futures:\n\nUS Futures /CDN per T /CDN price\n\nDec. 09 $7.08 $303.24 $8.25\n\nMar. 10 $7.18 $307.52 $8.37\n\nIf I plan to deliver after Dec futures expire... and planned to do so in advance... why should the CWB keep my money for the carry in the market?"
