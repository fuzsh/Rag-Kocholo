One way to help ease this transition is to provide young people with accurate and com prehen­ sive career guidance inform ation. By acquiring specific knowledge o f the various occupations in our econom y, they can becom e aware of the opportunities and alternatives that are available to them , and can plan for careers suited to their abilities and aspirations. The Occupational Outlook Handbook is a m ajor source of vocational guidance inform ation for hundreds of occupations. For each occupation, the Handbook describes what workers do on the jo b , the training or education needed, and m ost im portantly, some idea o f the availability of jobs in the years ahead. A lthough many people who need career guidance inform ation are young, such as students facing the transition from school to work, the Handbook also is a useful resource for those entering o r reentering the work force at later stages in their lives. The process of vocational choice and preparation may be accom panied by anxiety and uncertainty regardless of when in the life cycle it occurs. O ur hope in the D epartm ent of Labor is that this publication will continue to offer valuable assistance to all persons seeking satisfying and productive em ploy­ ment. Ray Marshall, Secretary of Labor iii Prefatory Note In o ur constantly changing econom y, inform ation on future career opportunities and educational requirem ents is necessary if w orkers are to be prepared for tom orrow ’s jobs. For m ore than 30 years, the Bureau of L abor Statistics has conducted research on occupations and industries for the purpose of providing this inform ation for use in vocational guidance. T he m ajor product o f this research is the Occupational Outlook Handbook, which contains inform ation on job duties, educational requirem ents, em ploym ent outlook, and earnings for several hundred occupations and 35 industries. The Handbook inform ation is based on data received from a variety of sources, including business firms, trade associations, labor unions, professional societies, educational institutions, and governm ent agencies, and represents the m ost cu rren t and com prehensive inform ation available. This edition of the Handbook has been revised to enhance its usefulness. Many statem ents contain expanded inform ation on occupational training; some include inform ation on the m ovem ent of workers from one occupation to another and typical paths of advancem ent within a career field. The new Handbook also contains a Dictionary o f Occupational Titles index, referenced to the third edition o f the Dictionary and cross referenced to the fourth, and m ost recen t edition. Julius Shiskin, Commissioner, Bureau of Labor Statistics IV Letter of Endorsement W ork can be one o f life’s m ost rewarding experiences. A jo b can offer pride in achieve­ m ent and an opportunity for personal growth, as well as the security of an adequate income. But finding work th at is satisfying seldom is easy. Many individuals m ake several different career choices over tim e as their job needs and aspirations change. C areer planning with the advice o f trained counselors can help a great deal. To assist individuals with their educational and vocational choices, counselors m ust have occupational inform ation that is current, accurate, and com prehensive. The Occupational Outlook Handbook is a prim ary source of the inform ation needed for sound career planning. For several hundred occupations and 35 m ajor industries, the Handbook describes what w orkers do on the jo b , the training and education required, advancem ent possibilities, em ploym ent outlook, and earnings and working conditions. Most statem ents also list profes­ sional societies, trade associations, unions, and other organizations that can supply additional career inform ation. C ounselors in all work settings will find the new edition of the Occupational Outlook Handbook an invaluable tool for helping clients plan a satisfying future in the working world. Dr. N orm an C.

Note A great many trade associations, professional societies, unions, and industrial organiza­ tions are able to provide career inform ation that is valuable to counselors and job seekers. For the convenience o f Handbook users, some of these organizations are listed at the end o f the statem ents on individual occupations and industries. A lthough these references were assem ­ bled carefully, the BLS has neither authority nor facilities for investigating the organizations listed. Also, because the Bureau does not preview all the inform ation or publications that may be sent in response to a request, it cannot guarantee the accuracy of such inform ation. The listing o f an organization, therefore, does not constitute in any way an endorsement or recom­ mendation by the Bureau or the U.S. Department o f Labor, either o f the organization and its activities or o f the information it may supply. Each organization has sole responsibility for w hatever inform ation it may issue. T he occupational inform ation contained in the Handbook presents a general, com posite description of jobs and industries and cannot be expected to reflect work situations in specific establishm ents or localities. The Handbook, therefore, is not intended and should not be used as a guide fo r determining wages, hours, the right o f a particular union to represent workers, appropriate bargaining units, or form al job evaluation systems.

HOW TO USE THE HANDBOOK How many kinds of jobs are there? Several hundred occupations are described in the Handbook, although the total num ber of occupations in the U.S. economy may be counted in the thousands. Most occupations re­ quiring long periods o f education or training are discussed, as are a num ­ ber of small but growing fields of em ­ ploym ent. A ltogether, the occupa­ tions in the Handbook account for about 95 percent of all salesworkers; ab o u t 90 p e rc e n t o f professional, craft, and service workers; 80 per­ cent of clerical workers; 50 percent of all operatives; and smaller propor­ tions of managerial workers and la­ borers. The main types of agricultur­ al occupations are described in the Handbook. The long-term job o u t­ look for the Nation as a whole is dis­ cussed, too. Where should I look first? Start with w hat you know about your own interests and abilities. Do you like frequent contact with other people or do you prefer to spend a lot of time alone? Are you a good fol­ lower or som eone whose greatest re­ wards com e from directing others in a work effort? The answers to these and similar questions can help you assess the personal traits and individ­ ual aptitudes that influence your job satisfaction and perform ance. It may be useful to discuss your personal needs and abilities with a counselor trained in exploring hum an behavior. He or she is familiar with tests and o th e r m e th o d s fo r m a k in g th is unique, personal assessment. The next step is to m atch your in­ dividual talents and goals with those dem anded by various fields of work. You may have discovered, for exam ­ ple, that one of your strong needs is frequent interaction with people so that social service work seems ap ­ pealing. To find out what kind o f jobs there are in that field, consult the Handbook's Table of C ontents under Social Service O ccupations. All o f the occupations in the Handbook are arran g e d in “ c lu s te rs ” o f re la ted jobs. There are 13 clusters altogeth­ er: Industrial production, office, ser­ vice, education, sales, construction, transportation, scientific and techni­ cal, m echanics and repairers, health, social science, social service, and art, design, and com m unications occupa­ tions. M ost ca re e r clusters in the Handbook describe a variety of jobs in a single field o f work. Training and skill requirem ents within a particular cluster often vary a great deal. If you are thinking about a future in health work, for example, you will find that a few jobs in the health occupations cluster require only a high school di­ ploma; others require a degree from a 2-year com m unity college or junior college; still others require a bache­ lo r’s degree; and a few require 4 years or m ore o f form al training fol­ lowing college graduation. If you know initially that the length or type of career training open to you is restricted by your own financial limitations or family obligations, you may want to narrow your job choices to those requiring high school or 2year college preparation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has prepared sev­ eral pam phlets, based on inform ation in the Handbook, that classify and d e­ scribe selected jobs by the type and length of training required. Looking first a t th e a p p ro p ria te p am p h let from this series, such as Jobs fo r Which a High School Education is R e­ quired, may be an efficient way to narrow your career choices to those that are realistic for you. See the sec­ tion on BLS Publications Useful to H andbook Readers for a list of the pam phlets in the Jobs fo r Which Se­ ries and inform ation on how to o b ­ tain them . You may already have a specific job or industry in mind. Or, if an im ­ portant industry is located in your area, you may find it useful to read the Handbook industry statem ent to learn about the different jobs in that industry and their varied training re­ quirem ents and earnings potefitial. To find out where it is described, turn to the Index of O ccupations and Industries at the back o f the book. There are 36 industry statem ents in the Handbook, grouped according to m ajor divisions in the economy: Ag­ ric u ltu re , m ining, and petroleu m ; construction; m anufacturing; tran s­ portation, com m unications, and pub­ lic u tilities; w holesale and re ta il trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; services; and government. What will I learn? Once you have chosen a place to b eg in —an occu p atio n o r industry you’d like to learn m ore about—you can use the Handbook to find out what the job is like, what education and training are necessary, and what the advancem ent possibilities, earn­ ings, and em ploym ent outlook are likely to be. E ach section o f the Handbook follows a standard form at, making it easier to com pare different jobs. W hat follows is a description of the type of inform ation presented in each Handbook statem ent, with a few words of explanation. The num bers in parentheses that appear just below the title of m ost H andbook sta te m e n ts are D .O .T . code num bers. D.O.T. stands for Dic­ tionary o f Occupational Titles, now in its fourth edition, a U.S. D epartm ent o f L ab o r p u b lic a tio n w hich “ d e ­ fines” each of about 20,000 jobs ac­ cording to a system that uses num ­ bers to classify each job by the type o f w ork p e rfo rm e d , tra in in g r e ­ quired, physical dem ands, and work­ ing conditions. Because many Hand­ book users have not yet received the recent fourth edition o f the D.O.T, 3 4 the D .O .T n um ber accom panying each statem ent in this Handbook re­ fers to the previous, third edition of th a t volum e. A co n v ersio n tab le showing the fourth edition num ber th at corresponds to th at from the third edition, used in the Handbook, appears in an Appendix. An index listin g H andbook o c c u p a tio n s by D.O.T. num ber precedes the alpha­ betical Index of Industries and O ccu­ pations. D.O.T. num bers are used primarily by public em ploym ent ser­ vice agencies for classifying appli­ cants and job openings, and for re­ p o rtin g an d o th e r o p e ra tin g purposes. They are included in the Handbook because career inform a­ tion centers and libraries frequently use them for filing occupational in­ formation. The Nature of the Work section describes the m ajor duties o f workers in the occupation. It tells what w ork­ ers do on the job and how they do it. A lth o u g h each jo b d esc rip tio n is typical of the occupation, duties are likely to vary by em ployer and size of em ploying organization, geographic location, and other factors. In some occupations, individual workers spe­ cialize in certain tasks. In others they perform the entire range of work in the occupation. O f course, job duties continually change as technology ad­ vances, new industrial processes are developed, and products or services change. The Places of Employment section provides inform ation on the num ber of workers in an occupation and tells w h eth er they are co n c en trate d in c e rta in in d u s trie s o r g eo g rap h ic areas. W h e th e r an o c c u p a tio n is larg e o r sm all is im p o rta n t to a jobseeker because large occupations, even th o se grow ing slowly, offer more openings than small ones be­ cause o f the many workers who retire or die each year. Some occupations are concentrat­ ed in p a rtic u la r in d u stries. M ost cooks and chefs, for exam ple, are employed in the restaurant and hotel industries while secretaries are em ­ ployed in alm ost every industry. If an occupation is found primarily in ce r­ tain industries, this section lists them . A few occupations are concentrat­ ed in certain parts o f the country. OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK A ctors and actresses, for exam ple, usually work in C alifornia or New York. This inform ation is included for the benefit of people who have strong preferences about where they live—because they do not wish to be sep arated from th eir fam ilies and friends, for example. For most occu­ p atio n s, how ever, em p lo y m en t is widely scattered and generally fol­ lows the same pattern as the distribu­ tion of the population. In addition, inform ation on parttim e em p lo y m en t is included b e ­ cause it is im p o rtan t to students, hom em akers, re tire d persons, and others who may want to work part time. Knowing which occupations of­ fer good opportunities for part-tim e work can be a valuable lead. T he Training, Other Q ualifica­ tion s, and A dvancem ent se c tio n should be read carefully because the decisions you m ake concerning prep­ aration for an occupation represent a considerable investm ent of time and m oney. E arly and w ise p lan n in g toward a career goal can save you un w arran ted expenditures later. If you currently are in school, it’s a good idea to look closely at the list o f high school and college courses re ­ garded as useful preparation for the career you have in mind. Nearly all H a n d b o o k s t a t e m e n t s lis t su c h courses. W orkers can qualify for jobs in a variety o f ways, including college study leading to a certificate or asso­ ciate degree; program s offered by p o stsecondary v o cational schools, both public and private; hom e study courses; governm ent training p ro ­ gram s; ex perience or training o b ­ tained in the Arm ed Forces; appren­ ticeship and o th er form al training offered on the job or in the classroom by e m p lo y e rs; an d h igh s c h o o l courses. F or each occupation, the Handbook identifies which of these routes of entry is preferred. In many cases, alternative ways of obtaining training are listed as well. It is worth rem em bering that the level at which you e n te r an o cc u p atio n and th e speed with which you advance often are d eterm in ed by th e am ount o f training you have. M any o c c u p a tio n s are n a tu ra l ste p p in g sto n e s to o th e rs . A fte r working for a time as a program m er, for example, many people advance to jobs as systems analysts. The world of work is dynam ic and few w orkers spend their lives in one or even two occupations. Some have several jobs o v er a lifetim e, changing ca ree rs when it is advantageous to do so. F re­ quently observed patterns of m ove­ m ent from one occupation to an oth­ e r , su c h as a d v a n c e m e n t fro m program m er to systems analyst, are discussed in the Handbook. This type of inform ation can be useful in sever­ al ways. It is helpful to know, for example, that skills gained working at one job can m ake you m ore employable in another—perhaps a job that is m ore desirable in term s o f earnings, w ork­ ing conditions, or scope for self-ex­ pression. On the other hand, it also is useful to know which jobs offer the most opportunity for transferring to other work of a similar nature. P er­ sons trained in electrical or chem ical engineering, for example, frequently can transfer to another engineering specialty where they can apply gen­ eral engineering knowledge in differ­ ent ways. In some cases moving from one o c­ cupation to another takes m ore than the training or experience acquired on the job. Before a hospital aide can advance to licensed practical nurse, for example, ye or she m ust com plete the year o f specialized training re­ quired for licensing. Many Handbook statem ents describe the possibilities fo r a d v a n c e m e n t a fte r a d d itio n al training, and note any in-service p ro ­ grams th at allow em ployees to gain n ee d ed skills while co ntinuin g to work part time. C ertain occupations offer em ploym ent opportunities to persons w ith little or no previous work experience. The Handbook in­ cludes many statem ents on such en ­ try level jobs, many in the office and service clusters. It usually is wise, how ever, to dis­ cuss the patterns of job transfer and advancem ent described in the Hand­ book with counselors, local em ploy­ ers, and others who know about the p a rtic u la r jo b m a rk e t w here you w ant to w ork. T ypical p attern s o f m ovem ent from one occupation to 5 HOW TO USE THE HANDBOOK another may not apply in every em ­ ployment setting. All States have certification or li­ censing requirem ents for some occu­ pations. Physicians and nurses, ele­ m e n ta ry a n d s e c o n d a r y sc h o o l teachers, barbers and cosmetologists, electricians and plum bers are exam ­ ples of occupations that are licensed. If you are considering occupations that require State licensing, be sure to check the req u irem en ts in the State in which you plan to work. An im p o rta n t fa c to r in c a re e r choice is the extent to which a par­ ticular job suits your personality. Al­ though it often is difficult for people to assess themselves, your counselor u ndoubtedly is fam iliar with tests that can help.

For a par­ ticular job, you may need the ability to: —make responsible decisions. —motivate others. —direct and supervise others. —work under close supervision. —work in a highly competitive atmosphere. —enjoy working with ideas and solving prob­ lems. —enjoy working with people. —enjoy working with things—good coordina­ tion and manual dexterity are necessary. —work independently—initiative and self-dis­ cipline are necessary. —work as part of a team. —enjoy working with detail, either numbers or technical written material. —enjoy helping people. —use creative talents and ideas and enjoy hav­ ing an opportunity for self-expression. —derive satisfaction from seeing the physical results of your work. —work in a confined area. —perform repetitious work. —enjoy working outside, regardless of the weather. The Employment Outlook section discusses prospective job opportuni­ ties. Knowing whether or not the job m arket is likely to be favorable is im p o rtan t in deciding w hether to pursue a specific career.

The em ploym ent outlook section of most Handbook statem ents begins with a sentence about expected em ­ ployment growth through 1985. The occupation or industry is described as likely to grow about as fast as the average for all occupations or indus­ tries; faster than the average; or more slowly than the average (figure I). Job opportunities in a particular occu­ pation or industry usually are favor­ able i f employment increases at least as rapidly as in the economy as a whole. Occupations or industries in which em ploym ent stays about the same or declines generally offer less favorable job prospects than those that are growing because the only openings are those due to deaths, retirements, and other separations from the labor force. Some Handbook statem ents take note 6f the effect of fluctuations in economic activity. This information is valuable to people looking into long-range career possibilities at a time when the economy is in a reces­ sion. Persons understandably w on­ der: W hat will the economy be like when I enter the labor m arket? Will it be harder to find a job 5 or 10 years from now than it is today? The Hand­ book gives in fo rm atio n , w herever feasible, on occupations and indus­ tries whose levels of em ploym ent fluctuate in response to shifts in the economic climate. It is im portant to bear in mind th at em ploym ent in many—but not all—occupations and industries is directly affected by an econom ic dow nturn. A sharp im ­ provem ent in the outlook for these occupations and industries is likely as the economy picks up. However, o th ­ er occupations and industries are less affected by short-term changes in economic activity. O ther factors in­ flu en c e th e ir grow th o r d ec lin e . These m atters are explored in a num ­ ber of Handbook statem ents. For som e occupations, inform a­ tion is available on the supply of workers—that is, the num ber of peo­ ple pursuing the type of education or training needed and the num ber sub­ sequently entering the occupation. When such information is available, the Handbook describes prospective job opportunities in terms of the ex­ pected dem and-supply relationship. T he p r o s p e c t i v e j o b s i t u a t i o n is term ed “ excellent” when demand is likely to g re atly e x c e e d sup p ly ; “ keen com petition” when supply is likely to ex c eed d em an d . O th e r terms used in Handbook statem ents are shown in Figure II. W orkers who transfer in to one oc­ cupation from an o th er som etim es are a significant com ponent of sup­ ply; similarly, those who transfer out may have a substantial effect on de- Figure II Job opportunities Excellent Very good Good or favorable May face competition Keen competition Prospective demand-supply relationship Demand much greater than supply Demand greater than supply Rough balance between demand and supply Likelihood of more supply than demand Supply greater than demand 6 mand because their leaving usually creates a job opening. Although the inform ation currently available on transfers among occupations is limit­ ed, some statem ents in the Handbook discuss transfer patterns and their ef­ fect on the supply for certain occupa­ tions. The employm ent outlook for engineers, for exam ple, notes that transfers into the field are likely to constitute a substantial portion of supply if past trends continue. The inform ation in this section should be used carefully. Getting a job may be difficult if the field is so small that openings are few (actu ar­ ies and blacksmiths are examples) or so popular that it attracts many more jobseekers than there are jobs (radio and television broadcasting, journal­ ism, the perform ing arts, and m odel­ ing). Getting a job also can be diffi­ cult in occupations and industries in which em ploym ent is declining (m er­ chant sailors, photoengravers, type­ setters), although this is not always the case. But even occupations that are small o r overcrow ded provide som e jo b s. So do o cc u p atio n s in which em ploym ent is growing very slowly or even declining, for there is a need to replace workers who leave the occupation. If the occupation is large, the num ber of job openings arising from replacem ent needs can be quite substantial. B ookkeepers, telephone operators, and machinists are exam ples of large occupations that provide a significant num ber of jo b o p en in g s ea ch y e a r b e c a u se workers leave. On the average, open­ ings re s u ltin g from re p la c e m e n t needs are expected to account for nearly two-thirds of all job openings. How reliable is the information on the outlook for em ploym ent over the next 10 years? No one can predict future labor m arket conditions with perfect accuracy. In every occupa­ tion and industry, the num ber o f job seekers and the num ber of job openings constantly changes. A rise or fall in the dem and for a product or service affects the num ber of w ork­ ers needed to produce it. New inven­ tions and technological innovations create some jobs and eliminate oth­ ers. Changes in the size or age distri­ bution o f the population, work atti­ OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK tu d e s, tra in in g o p p o rtu n itie s , o r retirem ent program s determ ine the n u m b er o f w orkers available. As these forces in te ra c t in the labor m arket, som e occupations ex p eri­ ence a sh o rtag e , som e a surplus, some a balance between jobseekers and o p e n in g s. M e th o d s used by econom ists to develop inform ation on future occupational prospects dif­ fer, and judgm ents that go into any assessment of the future also differ. Therefore, it is im portant to under­ stand what underlies each statem ent on outlook. For every occupation and industry covered in the Handbook, an estim ate of future em ploym ent needs is devel­ oped. These estimates are consistent with a set of assumptions about the future of the economy and the coun­ try. For m ore detail, see the section entitled, Assumptions and M ethods Used In Preparing the Employment Projections. Finally, you should rem em ber that job prospects in your community or State may not correspond to the d e­ scription o f the em ploym ent outlook in the Handbook. For the particular job you are interested in, the outlook in y o u r a re a m ay be b e tte r , o r worse.The Handbook does not dis­ cuss the outlook in local areas b e­ cause the analysis is far too much for a centralized staff to handle. Such in fo rm atio n has b een d ev elo p ed , however, by many States and local­ ities. The local office of your State em ploym ent service is the best place to ask about local-area em ploym ent projections. Names and addresses of these S tate and local inform ation sources and suggestions for addition­ al inform ation on the job m arket are given in the following section, W here to Go for More Information. The Earnings section helps answer many of the questions that you may ask when choosing a career. Will the income be high enough to m aintain the standard of living I want and ju s­ tify my training costs? How much will my earnings increase as I gain experi­ ence? Do some areas of the country or some industries offer better pay than o th e rs for the sam e type o f work? Like m ost people, you probably think of earnings as money. But m on­ ey is only one type of financial re­ ward for work. Paid vacations, health insurance, uniform s, and discounts on clothing or o th er m erchandise also are part of total earnings. About 9 out of 10 workers receive money income in the form of a wage or salary. A wage usually is an hourly or daily rate of pay, while a salary is a weekly, m onthly, or yearly rate. Most craft workers, operatives, and lab o re rs are wage e a rn e rs, while m ost p ro fessio n al, tech n ic al, and clerical workers are salary earners. In addition to their regular pay, wage and salary workers may receive extra money for working overtim e, or on a night shift or irregular sched­ ule. In some occupations, w orkers also may receive tips or be paid a commission based on the am ount of sales or services they provide to cus­ tom ers. Factory workers are som e­ times paid a piece rate, which is an extra paym ent for each item they produce. For many w orkers, these types of pay am ount to a large part of their total earnings. The rem aining 10 percent o f all w orkers are in business for th em ­ selves and earn self-employment in­ come instead of wages or salaries. This group includes w orkers in a wide variety of occupations:Physicians, shopkeepers, barbers, writers, photographers, and farmers are ex­ am ples of workers who frequently are self-employed. W orkers in some occupations earn self-employment income in addition to their wages or salaries. For exam ­ ple, electricians and carpenters often do small repair or rem odeling jobs during evenings or w eekends, and college p ro fesso rs freq u en tly are paid for publishing articles based on independent research. Besides money incom e, most wage and salary workers receive a variety of fringe benefits as part of their earn ­ ings on the job. Several are required by Federal and State law, including social security, w orkers’ com pensa­ tion, and unem ploym ent insurance. These benefits provide incom e to persons when they are not working because of old age, work-related in­ jury or disability, or lack of suitable jobs.

C onsidering w orking co nditio n s when you make up your mind about a career can help you choose a job that brings you satisfaction and en­ joym ent. WHERE TO GO FOR MORE INFORMATION W hether you have questions about a particular job or are trying to com ­ pare various fields, the Occupational Outlook Handbook is a good place to begin. The Handbook will introduce you to some of the im portant aspects of an occupation and answer many of your initial questions. But the Hand­ book is only one of many sources of information about jobs and careers. After reading a few Handbook state­ ments, you may decide that you want m ore detailed inform ation about a particular occupation. Or you may want to find out where you can find this kind of work in your community or where you can go for appropriate training. If you are willing to make an effort, you will discover a wealth of occupational inform ation—much of it available at little or no cost. Sources of Career Information M uch inform ation on careers is p u t o u t by go v ern m ent, industry, trade unions, schools, professional associations, private guidance serv­ ices, and other organizations. You should be careful in assessing any sin­ gle piece of career guidance m ateri­ al. Keep in mind the date and source, in particular. M aterial that is too old may contain obsolete or even mis­ leading inform ation. Be especially cautious ab o u t accepting inform a­ tion on em ploym ent outlook, earn­ ings, and training requirem ents if it is more than 5 years old. You also need to consider the source—and thus the intent—o f the career guidance m ate­ rial you obtain. Although some occupational m a­ terials are produced solely for the purpose of objective vocational guid­ ance, o th ers are p ro d u ced for re ­ cruitm ent purposes. You should be wary o f biased inform ation, which may ten d to leave o u t im p o rtan t items, overglamorize the occupation, overstate the earnings, or exaggerate the dem and for workers. School counselors can be a very im­ portant source of guidance inform a­ tion. Counselors should be able to refer you to the different types o f ca ree r m aterials available in your school or community. They are likely to be familiar with the job m arket. They also can discuss entry require­ ments and costs of the schools, col­ leges, or training program s that offer preparation for the kind of work in which you are interested. Most im­ p o rtan t o f all, your counselor can help you consider the occupational inform ation you obtain in relation to your own abilities, personal aspira­ tions, and career goals. Guidance offices usually have col­ lections o f c a ree r inform ation. In fact, the copy o f the Handbook that you’re reading now may have come from the guidance office. Find out what else the office has to offer. Some schools have career centers; often, these are located in or near the library or media center. C areer cen­ ters provide a sam pling of printed and audiovisual career inform ation materials, and also may offer individ­ ual counseling, group discussions, guest speakers, and field trips. Libraries have books, brochures, magazines, and audiovisual m aterials that contain inform ation about jobs and careers. Check your school li­ brary or media center, of course— but d o n ’t forget the public library. Many libraries have pam phlet files d ev o ted to specific o c c u p a tio n s. Some libraries also have collections of filmstrips, records and tapes, and microfilms with occupational infor­ mation. The reference shelf undoubt­ edly contains one directory or m ore that you will find useful if you want to get the names of specific schools, colleges, or business concerns. The library staff can direct you to the in­ formation best suited to your needs. Trade unions, business firms, trade associations, professional societies, and educational institutions all pub­ lish career inform ation, and much of this is available for the asking. The Sources of Additional Infor­ m ation section at the end of most Handbook statem ents lists organiza­ tions you can write to. This is a good way to begin. For the names and ad­ dresses of other organizations, con­ sult the directories on your library’s reference shelf. There, you are likely to find directories that list: —trade associations. —professional associations. —business firms. —junior and community colleges. —colleges and universities. —home study and correspondence programs. —business, trade, and technical schools. —sources of scholarships and financial aid. Your school library or career cen ­ ter may have one directory or more put out by com m ercial publishers that list sources of career inform a­ tion by occupation. A n o th er useful d irecto ry is the U.S. Office of E ducation’s Directory o f Postsecondary Schools with Occu­ pational Programs, 1973-74, which lists schools offering specific occupa­ tional training programs. The direc­ tory lists private business, trade, and technical schools as well as com m u­ nity and junior colleges and 4-year colleges and universities. Computer-assisted occupational in­ form ation systems have been in ­ stalled in some schools and career centers. These systems allow users to obtain career inform ation stored in a co m p u ter by entering specific re ­ quests and receiving im mediate an­ swers. Through the occupational in­ form ation systems, users are able to examine the ways in which different personal abilities, interests, and pref­ erences are related to different occu9 OCCUPATIONAL OUTLOOK HANDBOOK 10 pations. The U.S. D epartm ent of La­ bor is currently providing funds for such systems in eight States. D on’t overlook the im portance of personal contacts. An interview with someone in a particular job can often tell you much more than a booklet or brochure can. By asking the right questions, you find out what kind of train in g is really im p o rta n t, how workers got their first jobs as well as the one they’re in now, and what they like and dislike about the work. State employment security agencies in many States publish career briefs for dozens of different occupations and industries. These briefs usually describe earnings and job outlook in­ formation for a particular State—and sometimes for a city or m etropolitan area. By contrast, the Handbook gives in fo rm a tio n fo r th e N atio n as a w hole. In ad d itio n , a n u m b er o f States publish brochures on writing resumes, finding job openings, p re­ paring for interviews, and other as­ pects of a job search. To find out what m aterials are available for your State, consult the U.S. Employment and Training A dm inistration’s 1976 Guide to Local Occupational Informa­ tion. Or write directly to the chief information officer in your State em ­ ployment security agency.

For inform ation on job openings, fol­ low up as many leads as possible. P are n ts, neighbors, te a c h e rs, and counselors may know o f jobs. Check the w ant ads. Investigate the local office of your State em ploym ent ser­ vice. And find out w hether private or nonprofit em ploym ent agencies in your com m unity can help you. The following section will give you some idea of where you can go to look for a job and what sort of help to expect. Informal job search methods. Infor­ mal m ethods of job search are the most popular, and also the most ef­ fective. Informal m ethods include di­ rect application to employers with or w ithout referral by friends or rela­ tives. Jobseekers locate a firm that might employ them and file an appli­ cation, often w ithout certain knowl­ edge that an opening exists. You can find targets for your infor­ mal search in several ways. The Y el­ low P ages and local cham bers o f com m erce will give you the nam es and addresses of appropriate firms in the com m unity w here you wish to work. Y ou can also get listings o f m ost firms in a specific industry— banking, insurance, m anufacturing, and new spaper publishing, for exam ­ ple—by consulting one of the direc­ tories on the reference shelf of your public library. Friends and relatives may suggest places to apply for a job, and people you m eet in the course o f your job search are also likely to give you ideas. Want ads. The “ Help W anted” ads in a m ajor new spaper contain hundreds o f job listings. As a job search tool, they have two advantages: They are cheap and easy to acquire, and they often result in successful placem ent. T h e re are d isad v an ta g es as w ell. W ant ads give a distorted view o f the local labor m arket, for they tend to u n d e rre p re se n t sm all firm s. T hey also tend to o v errep resen t certain o cc u p atio n s, such as clerical and sales jobs. How helpful they are to you will depend largely on the kind of job you seek. Bear in mind that want ads do not provide com plete inform ation; many ads give little or no description of the jo b , w orking conditions, and pay. Some ads om it the identity o f the em ployer. In addition, firms often run multiple listings. Some ads offer jobs in o th er cities (w hich do not help the local w orker); others adver­ tise em ploym ent agencies rather than employment. If you use the want ads, keep the following suggestions in mind: * D o n ’t rely exclusively on the want ads; follow up other leads, too. * Answer ads prom ptly. The open­ ing may be filled before the ad stops running. * Follow the ads diligently. C heck­ ing them every day as early as possi­ ble gives you the best advantage over other applicants, which may m ean the difference betw een a job and a rejection. * D o n ’t ex p ect to o m uch from “ blind ad s” th at do not reveal the em ployer’s identity. Em ployers use blind ads to avoid being swam ped with applicants, or to fill a particular vacancy quietly and confidentially. The chances of finding a job through blind ads tend to be slim. * Be cautious about answering “ no experience necessary” ads. Most em ­ ployers are able to fill job openings that do not require experience w ith­ o u t advertising in the new spaper. This type of ad may m ean th at the jo b is h ard to fill because o f low wages or poor working conditions, or becau se it is straig h t com m ission work. Public employment service. The p u b ­ lic em ploym ent service, also called 13 WHERE TO GO FOR MORE INFORMATION the Job Service, can be a good source of information about job openings in your community. Em ployment secu­ rity (ES) agencies in each of the 50 States and the D istrict of Columbia are affiliated with the U.S. Employ­ m ent Service, and provide their ser­ vices w ith o u t c h a rg e . O p e ra tin g through a network o f 2,500 local of­ fices, State agencies help jobseekers find em ploym ent and help employers find qualified workers. To find the office nearest you, look in the State government telephone listings under “ Job Service” or “ Em ploym ent.” If the local office does not provide the information or services you are look­ ing for, write to the inform ation offi­ cer in your State capital. Addresses are given in the first section of this chapter. General services. Assuming you come to your local em ploym ent service of­ fice because you’re looking for a job, the first step is to fill out an applica­ tion that asks for general background and work history. To speed up the process, you should bring along com ­ plete inform ation on previous jobs, in c lu d in g d a te s o f e m p lo y m e n t, names and addresses of employers, and pay levels. After completing the application, you will talk briefly with an inter­ viewer in order to be classified into a particular jo b clu ster—professional and m anagem ent, sales, clerical, and so forth. This process, although cru­ cial, takes very little time. If you have specific training and experience and know exactly what you want, the ini­ tial interview may suffice. Most ap­ plicants, however, can benefit from additional guidance services, which are available on request. The un­ skilled and inexperienced may take a gen eral ap titu d e test b attery th at measures their abilities, and a voca­ tional interest questionaire that m ea­ sures th eir o ccu p atio n al interests. Specific tests in typing and shorthand may also be given. You may also talk at length with o c c u p a tio n a l c o u n s e lo r s . T h ese counselors, or interviewers, can as­ sist in a wide range of areas. They can help you pinpoint a suitable field of interest, suggest training programs and other means of preparing for a particular occupation, or simply ad ­ vise you on compiling a resume. One other aspect of your local of­ fice’s services deserves particular a t­ ten tio n —the"
