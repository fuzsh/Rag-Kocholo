        "text": "96.3 CRUZ FM also known by its on-air name CFWD-FM is a mix format (Classic Rock, R&B and Pop) radio owned by Harvard Broadcasting. The licensee received the permissions from CRTC on May 28, 2007 to in response to its application to launch an FM station in Saskatoon. The proposed frequency was 92.3 MHz complemented by an ERP of 100,000 watts. CFWD would cover 80% of the local news and offer local programming of 126 hours/week. The wattage was decreased to 96,000 watts and frequency was flipped to 96.3 MHz as an action to avoid the third adjacency interference in the city. Finally on April 9, 2008 the channel: “96.3 Santa FM” was launched as Saskatoon’s first ever Christmas station.\n\nMore Canadian ans Saskatchewan Radios\n\nListen 96.3 CRUZ FM Saskatoon, SK Online\n\nListen 96.3 Cruz FM (CFWD-FM) online from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
