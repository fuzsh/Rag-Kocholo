        "text": "I had a lady ask me what it meant when a cat starts tearin' up the upholstery, sharpens his claws on the Lazy Boy, and all the hair falls off his tail. I said, \"Ma'am, that means it's time to get a new cat!\"\n\nExcuses to keep an old cow that needs to be culled:\n\n\"She'll be as good as new once the hair grows back.\"\n\n\"My sister-in-law had a C-Section and we didn't ship her!\"\n\n\"I know she's barren, but look at how fat she is.\"\n\nBecause farmers and ranchers choose to work directly with God, we get a closer look at life. We're not insulated from its precarious nature. In return we're exposed to the beautiful sunrise, the smell of rain, the quiet snow and satisfaction of saving a life now and then.\n\nYour dog is so happy to see you whether you're gone 5 minutes or 5 days! Can you think of a single human that is that glad to see you? If you're going to town and forget your keys, when you come back in your dog licks your hand and your spouse says, \"I thought you left.\"\n\nA genius, smart as a tree full of owls, twenty foot tall with a bulletproof brain, a friend to all of his pals. So just like the story of Jekyll & Hyde, he's a wise man or a clown, a hero of fool, depending on whether the market goes up or down!"
