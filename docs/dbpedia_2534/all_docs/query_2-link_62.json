As for himself, he had sustain the conclusion that the rates are confiscatory never “ seen enough State regulation to justify Fed­ and unconstitutional, on the other hand when the eral action.” Commissioner Prouty, on his part, was quoted as evidence admits of no doubt, the rates are unhesi­ tatingly held to be invalid— at least in all special in­ saying that “ the decision, except for the confisca­ stances where the effect is plainly to leave them un­ tion paragraphs, is simply a statement of the law as productive. In this week’s decisions the State laws the law stands and as it had been construed by of Missouri, Oregon, Arkansas and West Virginia everybody except the railroads until the Minnesota were upheld, just as last week the Minnesota rate rate case came up.” Commissioner Meyer is repre­ laws and rate orders were upheld. But as last sented as saying: “ There was but one way the week the Minnesota law was held invalid as against Supreme Court could decide the Minnesota rate the Minneapolis & St. Louis ItII., so the present case— that was against the railroads. Congress week the Missouri law is held invalid as to a number intended that the right should be reserved for each of smaller roads. The Minnesota decision last week State to control railroads and their rates between embraced only three cases. The present week the points wholly within that State.” Commissioner Court announced its conclusions in no less than McChord was formerly a member of the Kentucky twenty-two cases; but seventeen of these came from Railroad Commission and he alluded to the decision Missouri. The Missouri rates are declared invalid as a correct interpretation of the principles involved as applied to the St. Louis & Hannibal, operating and dwelt upon what he personally had done to 121 miles within the State, the Kansas City Clinton authorize the Kentucky Railroad Commission to & Springfield, operating 151 miles within the State, prescribe rates. It is thus evident that the railroads and the Chicago Great Western, operating 84 miles would have absolutely nothing to gain even if the within the State. By virtue of stipulations between jurisdiction of the Commission were enlarged so the State and the railroads, the decision holding the as to include all the traffic of the roads. Under the rules now laid down by the Supreme rates confiscatory as to the Chicago Great Western Court, it remains for the roads to prove that the rates is also made to apply to the Quincy Omaha & Kansas which the States seek to enforce are non-compensa­ City R R . and the St. Joseph & Grand Island R y. It is noteworthy that whereas last week’s decisions tory. Thus far they have given less attention to upholding the Minnesota statutes and rate orders that feature than required, taking it for granted had the effect of completely upsetting the stock mar­ that if they could show that regulation of intra-State ket, causing almost a panic, this week's decisions, rates meant interference with inter-State rates, applying still further the doctrines then announced, nothing further was necessary. But it ought not have been received with great equanimity by the to be difficult, with net income even on the best of market. £Obviously, if last week’s decisions furnished roads at such a low ebb, to make out a clear and a warrant for panicky fears, this week’s decisions ought convincing case. It is only the weaker roads that to intensify the feeling of uneasiness. But there is have gained a victory, and it is to be noted that it is now a better appreciation of the real significance of their very weakness that saves them from being the principles followed by the Court, and a better obliged to adopt the State rates assailed. But the appreciation also of the fact that no seriously harm­ decree expressly provides that the State may apply ful results, in the long run, are likely to ensue in at any time to the Court for a new decree whenever allowing the States to control local rates in the future it shall appear that, by reason of a change in condi­ as in the past. The roads have little to fear from the ; tions, the rates prescribed by the State are sufficient States so long as the Supreme Court will interfere to yield reasonable compensation for the services to prevent the enforcement of non-compensatory rendered. It would seem as if the same rule rates, whereas they have a great deal to fear from the must apply in the case of the roads which have June 21 1913.] THE 1720 CHRONICLE failed in their endeavor to have the State rates de­ clare! void— that is, it would appear that they, too, must have the right to go into court again and en­ deavor to prove to the satisfaction of the judges that the rates really do yield an insufficient return. As far as the weaker roads are concerned, the claim is made that their victory is a barren one, since if they seek to maintain the existing rates while their powerful neighbors are forced to put in effect the lower rates prescribed by the States, these latter will get all the business and the weaker roads will lose. That is true, however, only as far as traffic to competitive points is concerned. The weaker roads, being small concerns, have comparatively little competitive traffic, and the action of the Court saves them from the necessity of reducing rates on the local traffic, which is most costly to handle and where the need for the higher rates is most urgent. wreck on the 12th inst. on the New Haven road would not deserve mention here except that they have excited wide comment and are considered most un­ fortunate, because indicating that even the clergy is not free from the demagogic spirit and loose talk so commonly indulged in by the politicians. Rev. Christian F. Reisner, pastor of the Grace Methodist Church of this city, preached the sermon referred to.

On Thurs­ day morning the daily papers even purported to give the full text of the bill. It was quickly repu­ diated, however, from Washington, the statement being made that this was simply an old draft or version of the measure and that since then innumer­ able changes had been made. On Thursday night Congressman Glass thought it best to give out a lengthy statement indicating the main features of the proposed reform measure, and this we print in full on a subsequent page. But it seems the plan is still subject to change. Under the circumstances extended discussion of the measure at this stage would be profitless. Judged by the outlines fur­ nished by Mr. Glass, it contains some good points. On the other hand in many of its aspects it seems crude and decidedly amateurish. One is deeply impressed with that fact in considering the functions and duties of the Federal Reserve Board, which is to have jurisdiction over new note issues and is to “ oversee the whole system.” This to be purely a political body. Originally it was provided that the Board should consist of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Comp­ troller of the Currency, and three members chosen by the President, and three more chosen by the banks. This gave the Government a two-thirds control, that is, six out of the nine members. But this has now been changed, so the Board is to consist of only seven members, namely the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Comp­ troller of the Currency and four others all chosen by the President with the consent of the Senate. Thus the Board will be exclusively a political bod y . Among many other things this Board is to establish each week a rate of discount for the Federal Reserve Banks which shall be mandatory upon these banks but which “ shall be made with a view to accommo­ dating the commerce of the country and promoting a stable price level .” Imagine what will inevitably follow when a political body attempts to promote “ a stable price level.” $200 a m o n th . b ility on th a t Ho is c o m p e l l e d s a la r y , w h il e to th e bear m an a ll th e w ho fo r r e s p o n s i­ in h e r ite d th e m i lli o n s r e p r e s e n t e d in s t o c k d r a w s $ 1 , 0 0 0 a d a y a s h e r i d e s i n h is y a c h t o r lo lls in h i s c l u b .

Hence, it is gratifying to find that these utterances have been generally condemned by the daily press. Caustic reference has been also made to the economic notion embodied in a criticism which considers em­ ployees in receipt of $2,400 a year as “ poorly paid.” There is general curiosity to know the identity of “ the Vice-President of one of the greatest institu­ tions in New York” who complained to this deluded dominie that the officers of his company “ are on salaries, and carry all the burdens, while the real owners shine in society.” He ought to come forward and reveal himself to the gaze of the world.

Where shall we stop in this course of progressive interference, and is there any better place or time than now and here? In this labor proposal, ship­ ments from States having equivalent child labor laws are exempted, but this both implies a Federal review of the efficiency of such State laws and points out the proper remedy, namely, action by the States.

Is it not the proper function of each State to take care of its own domestic affairs, and has not that mild and innocent commerce clause of the Con­ stitution been made a Pandora’s box far enough ? The expected bill for a partial suppression of child labor was introduced in the House this week by M r. Copley of Illinois. One section declares that em­ ployment of a child under 14 in any mill, factory or other producing establishment (trading or office establishments are not mentioned), or of any child under 16 in any quarry, mine, or similar place, or in any place where dangerous substances are handled, or where the work or the materials involve injury to the health or morals of the child, “ is hereby designated and defined as anti-social child labor, and as detrimental to the general welfare and debasing to commerce.” It has been quite common of late to print sketch drawings in which capital in the form Arrival of the new “ Imperator” , at present the of a gross-looking man is depicted as resting on the latest and largest of modern passenger liners, caused backs of little children, and a well-known weekly the Long Island road to run a parallel train westward appears this week with a broad picture of a flock from Montauk Point, as a “ demonstration” of possi­ of miserable-looking children (some of them on bilities which recalls the old dream of Mr. Austin crutches) coming to M r.

For the five months the same cities furnish a total of only $33,787,884 against $40,801,586 a year ago. From the Eastern provinces, however, 24 cities report an aggregate of estimated expenditures for the month moderately greater than in 1912, Fort William and Port Arthur showing especially notable gains, while for the five months the contrast is between $33,942,­ 476 and $26,752,968.

By a vote of 346 to 268 the House of Commons on Thursday, after a discussion of the Parliamentary Committee’s report on the Marconi disclosures of the last year, adopted a resolution vindicating the Attorney-General and the Chancellor of the Ex­ chequer. The resolution was thus adopted by a majority of 78, as compared with a nominal strength of 100. The motion was proposed by Sir W. Ryland Adkins, a Liberal, as follows: T h is H o u s e , a f t e r h e a r in g th e s t a t e m e n t s o f th e A t t o r n e y G en eral an d to th e C h a n c e llo r o f th e ir p u r c h a se s of sh a res in th e th e E x c h e q u e r in r e f e r e n c e M arcon i Com pany of A m e r ic a , a c c e p ts th e ir e x p r e s s io n s o f r e g r e t t h a t s u c h p u r ­ [ V o l .

I acted mistakenly, but I acted openly, innocently and honestly, and that is why I, with confidence, place myself in the hands, not merely of my political friends, but of all the members of this great assembly.” He and Sir Rufus Isaacs then left the House together. The Right Hon. H. L. Samuel, the Postmaster General, whose name was linked with those of the Attorney-General and the Chancellor of the Exechequer, in the earlier news­ paper reports repeated his denials of any dealings in Marconi shares. The British Premier, M r. Asquith, on Thursday, before the vote on the resolu­ tion that was finally carried, declared that an explanation was due from the Ministers to the House, but was there, he asked, ever a franker or more manly explanation than was given by the Chancellor of Exchequer and the Attorney-General on Wednes­ day? Mr. Asquith then confided to the House all that he knew of the Marconi transaction. He was told last August by the Master of Elibank (now Lord Murray) that three Ministers had bought American Marconi shares and that there was no connection between the English and American companies. The Premier then placed no importance on the pur­ chases, but he said that now he knew all the facts, he thought the Ministers ought to have stated these facts to the House in the debate last August. It is believed that the end, so far as Parliament is concerned, of the unfortunate Marconi incident has been heard. c h a s e s w e re m a d e a n d t h a t t h e y w e r e n o t m e n tio n e d in th e d e b a te o f O c t . 11 la s t , a n d a c q u its th e m o f a c tin g o th e rw ise t h a n in g o o d f a i t h , a n d r e p r o b a t e s t h e c h a r g e s o f c o r r u p t i o n a g a in s t th e M i n i s t e r s , w h ic h h a v e b e e n p r o v e d t o b e a b s o ­ lu t e ly fa ls e . The Balkan situation has once more assumed, on the surface at least, a threatening character. While Bulgaria and Servia, as a result of the pressure brought to bear by the Czar, agreed to submit their differences over territory captured from Turkey to him as arbitrator, additional excuses for friction have evidently been sought and found. Bulgaria on Thursday delivered a voluminous note to the Servian Government practically declining the lat­ ter’s request for a revision of the ante-bellum treaty and the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the Balkan trouble became more remote. Apparently Bulgaria will accept only Russian arbitration within the limits of this treaty while Servia is desirous of having all the disputed questions referred to Russia. The French Foreign Office has intimated to the leading French banking interests that the Govern­ ment will strongly disapprove of any loan being made either to Servia or to Bulgaria until after peace has been absolutely assured. Austria is being blamed for the development of what may almost be regarded as a new crisis, and is said to be so maneuvering as to make the Servian-Bulgarian compromise im­ possible. Austria is believed to resent the Czar’s arbitration proposal because of the power that would result in his control of the Slavonic races. On Wednesday Sir Rufus Isaacs, the AttorneyGeneral and David Lloyd George, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, frankly confessed in the House the unwisdom and indiscretion of their transactions in American Marconi shares. They defended in memorable and earnest addresses their honesty of purpose. The Attorney-General frankly accepted main responsibility. He admitted that his failure to disclose the facts to the House on October 11 was a mistaken course, but asserted that there was no intention whatever to deceive the House. In the light of what has since transpired, he would not say that the purchase of sharesJof|the American Marconi Company was a discreet transaction. The Chan­ cellor was on his feet before the applause which greeted the Attorney-General’s speech had died away. It would have been infinitely better, he conceded, if the Attorney-General and he, himself, had placed the whole fact before the House last October. It was a mistake in judgment, not really a lack of candor. Having regard to facts that have Since come to his knowledge, he would not have touched these transactions, because he now saw how they lent themselves to misconstruction, per­ The twenty-fifth anniversary of the accession of haps genuine misconception.

Secretary Bryan, in making the announcement, said he not only hoped but ex­ pected the Senate would ratify the new arbitration treaties already signed with Great Britain and other countries, despite the opposition to them. I he Sena­ torial opposition which Secretary Bryan is hopeful of overcoming was originally voiced by Senator Chamberlain, who insisted that, in renewing a treaty with Great Britains, pecific exemption should be made of the Panama Canal tolls controversy from the field of arbitration. The question of arbitrating with Japan the issue over the California Alien Land Law has also been a subject of discussion among Sen­ ators opposed to renewing that arbitration treaty. Ambassador Chinda has furnished the State Depart­ ment with a statement regarding the seizure by Jap­ anese authorities of the American yacht Columbia. The Japanese account of the incident, which is re­ garded as closed since the yacht, the passengers and the captain have been released, is as follows: “ I t a p p e a rs th a t o n J u n e 8 th e A m e r ic a n y a c h t C o lu m b ia , in d is r e g a r d of a w a rn in g g iv e n by th e c h ie f of th e lo c a l p o l ic e s t a t i o n , e n t e r e d , w i t h o u t s p e c ia l p e r m i s s i o n o f t h e a u ­ th o r itie s , a p r iv a to d o c k y a r d a t N a g a h a m a , n e a r N a g a s a k i , fo r r e p a ir s .

Washington dis­ patches say it has been learned from Japanese sources that secrecy and delay in this matter please the Jap­ anese Premier, who fears a public and Parliamentary demand for the reply of the United States at this time, and thinks the Cabinet will lose ground if the remedy suggested by President Wilson is inadequate. On Wednesday a delegation of Japanese who have come to Washington to confer with Viscount Chinda and the officials of this Government had a long confer­ ence with Secretary Bryan. The delegation con­ sisted of Dr. J. Soyedo and Tadao Kamija, both of Tokio; George Shima of Berkeley, Cal., and H. Abiko of San Francisco. Dr. Soyedo and M r. Kamija are representatives of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Japan and of the Japan-American Affiliation Association. Probably the best barometer of conditions at the foreign financial centres is the fact that the public offerings of the Mexican Government loan have been indefinitely delayed by the English and German members of the international syndicate which fin­ 1733 anced it, but that the French portion, amounting to 70,000,000 francs, is to be formally offered in Paris on June 28. The date of the offering of the American portion has not yet been announced and will undoubtedly wait upon market conditions. The Government loan in question, it will be recalled, was arranged at the same time that an agreement was reached for the purchase by an international syndicate of $26,730,000 of two-year 6% notes of the National Railways of Mexico. The Government loan was considered by the international syndicate mentioned as a necessary antecedent for the railway loan. It will be in the form of ten-year Treasury bonds to be sold at 973/6, bear 6% interest and be secured by customs duties. The Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas will, it is reported, subscribe almost 50% of the French part of the issue. Telegraphic advices from Mexico yesterday stated that $50,000,­ 000 (Mexican) of the Government loan may not be available for six months, according to a statement published by the Minister of Finance. Thirty million dollars (Mexican), he says, will be at the disposal of the Government after June 26, and the remainder in the form of two options of six months each. He continues: “ The only thing to prevent a consummation of the transaction will be that con­ ditions in Mexico become so bad as to make the placing of the bonds by the bankers impossible.” The London markets for securities showed improve­ ment early in the week, but later a reactionary tendency appeared, based very largely upon another threat of outbreak between Bulgaria andServia, due, it is believed, to the activities of Austria, which does not relish the influence of the Czar, who last week forced the two Balkan allies to agree to arbitration. Following the London settlement, which was con­ cluded, on Friday last, two small failures were re­ ported. These were Benito Weiser, a broker with Continental connections, and Percy Browning, also a broker dealing chiefly in American securities. The latter’s liabilities were only £17,000 however, and cabled advices state that sufficient sums that would have prevented the Weiser failure arrived in the afternoon after the failure had been announced in the forenoon. Several other firms were reported to have been helped out. The failures just mentioned took place on Friday of last week. On Monday there were two further small embarrassments, the first being Malcolm Cook & Company, which some years ago was an important concern; the second was that of Roderick Reading, a jobber in foreign securities. While the market during the closing days of the week has been reactionary in London the declines in prices have not been especially severe. Consols closed last evening at 72% , which compares with 73 5-16 a week ago. London & Northwestern stock, a representative British railway, closed % lower for the week at 129, Great Eastern closed at 57% , which is a decline of % for the week, and Great Western is 1 point lower at 114. Russian 4s on the London Stock Exchange, as reported by cable last evening, closed % lower at 88% , and Turkish 4s were without change at 85. Bulgarian 6s are 1 point higher at 103, while Servian unified 4s have declined two points to 78. German Imperial4s still continue at 74 and Greek monopoly 4s remain at 56% . On the Paris Bourse French rentes closed at 83.82%, which compares with 84.97% francs a week ago.

If has, for instance, been regarded somewhat in the nature of a notice that the Treasury Department has its eyes on the money situation and is prepared to use all the resources of the Govern­ ment to prevent any distinct stringency; and, in the next place, there seems a growing disposition at this centre to regard the Secretary’s announcement as notice to the banks that unnecessarily high rates will not be permitted, and that the effect of such rates would be to encourage the Treasury Department to use pressure to force the banks to take emergency circulation. On the basis of current conditions at New York, it may be figured that the proportion of emergency currency that the New York national banks could take out would be $63,750,000. The total amount of emergency currency that may be issued under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act is $500,000,­ 000. This amount may be apportioned, at the dis­ cretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, by States, in the proportion that capital and surplus of the na­ tional banks within each State bear to the aggregate capital and surplus of the national banks of the United States. On this basis, the national banks of New York State represent approximately 17% of the aggregate capital and surplus of the national banks of the United States, and would be entitled to apply for $85,000,000 of emergency circulation. The national banks of New York City in capital and sur­ plus represent an amount equal to 75% of the aggre­ gate capital and surplus of the national banks of the State. Thus it would seem that their proportion would be $63,750,000. But this full amount could not at once be applied for, as, according to last week’s statement of the Clearing House, there are eleven national banks at this centre which have not 40% of their capital outstanding in circulation secured by Government bonds. These banks, under the terms of the Aldrich-Vreeland law, must first take out their full measure of ordinary circulation before they are entitled to apply for emergency notes. There has been a German demand in the market far funds to relieve the strain of the semi-annual settle­ ments at the German centre. Bids have ranged from 5% % and 6 % for sixty-day loans and have gone as high as 6 ^ % for thirty-day contracts. But the bids have not included a guaranty against loss on the foreign exchange and no important actual transac­ tions have been reported. There have been no im­ portant demands on the New York market for new capital this week. The Southern Pacific has placed a large note issue with local bankers, who, however, will, it is understood, await improvement in invest­ ment conditions before making any formal offering of the notes to the public. The slowing down of imports and in various branches of our domestic activities is exerting the natural influence of releasing banking funds. There does not appear to be a strong prospect of distinct improvement in this direction until the new tariff has been placed on the statute book. Neither does the stock market outlook afford ground for the belief that speculation will require an abnormal volume of banking accommodation in the near future. Thus the way seems prepared for meeting the usual yearly crop requirement without essential strain, and crop funds, in turn, promise to be released before the mercan­ 1735 tile and industrial requirements are likely to respond to the settlement of tariff uncertainty. Advices from Washington suggest that the tariff bill will not be enacted before the latter part of August or, possibly, the early part'of September. The weekly statement of the Associated Banks on Saturday indicated a surplus above reserve requirements of all the banks and trust companies in the Clearing House of $38,­ 812,500, which compares with $29,235,050 a year ago. There was a decrease of $8,869,000 in loans for the week but an increase of $4,402,000 in deposits. The latter added $2,147,900 to the reserve require­ ment, so that while the cash reserve for the week increased $10,972,000, the surplus above require­ ment showed an expansion of only $8,824,100. The banks during the coming week will be called upon to provide for the July 1 dividends and coupons, whose requirements are among the largest of any month of the year. However, no important ad­ vances in money rates seem to be expected. The range for call money this week has been 1 % @ 2 and the renewal rates have averaged about 2% . M onday’s extreme figures were l% a n d 2)^ % , with 1ys% the renewal figure; Tuesday’s extremes 2 @ 2 ]^ % , with 2}/% the ruling rate; on Wednesday and Thursday 2]^ and 2% were again the highest and lowest, respectively, while renewals were on a 2% basis. Friday’s highest was 2J4%, lowest 2% and ruling rate 2 / i% . For fixed maturities, closing rates l were 3 ^ % for sixty days, 3 % @ 4 % for ninety days, 43^@ 4% % for six months, 4 % @ 5 % for five months and 534@ 5//6% for six months. Commercial paper has been in better demand, but rates are without change for the week from 5 % @ 6 % for sixty and ninety-day endorsed bills receivable and for four to six months names of choice character. Others are quoted at 6 ^ @ 6 3 ^ % . Sterling exchange has ruled rather nervous during the week, though quotations have not fluctuated on an important scale.- There has been the usual demand for remittances to pay July dividends and interest on American securities specifically payable abroad. The tourist movement has also contributed a fair demand, but on the other hand the unusually active export movement of products and other mer­ chandise and the gradual restriction of importations that is so natural when lower tariff duties are to be announced in the near future has materially strength­ ened foreign credits. Germany has been bidding 5 % @ 6 % for sixty-day funds and as high as 6 ^ % for thirty-day funds in the local market, but as exchange is not guaranteed the propositions were not attractive to local lenders and it cannot be learned that any important loans have been arranged. A local house has been selling francs quite freely this week. Such action in the past has been frequently preliminary to exports of gold to Paris, but no arrangements for such shipments have yet been announced. It is reported, however, that Germany has been taking gold very freely in Paris as well as in London. The Bank of France only reported an increase this week of 2,594,000 francs in its gold holdings, which, in view of the half-yearly settlement period, cannot be considered large, and Paris cables have suggested that the Bank of France has been arranging for additional gold importations from this side.. The easing down of money rates here would aid such a movement, although foreign exchange rates are still well above the point at which it is figured 1736 TH E CH RO N ICLE the precious metal can.be shipped to Europe as an exchange transaction without loss. Within the last few years, however, the Bank o f France has repeated­ ly assumed whatever loss may be thus incurred in this direction in order to obtain the precious metal. Foreign private discounts have ruled firm this week. Foreign selling of American securities has moderated, tVhich has materially cut down the demand for remit­ tances. There has, however, been no important foreign re-purchases o f American securities. Some large institutions have been selling sterling and utilizing the proceeds in various favorable banking propositions here, to- some extent in the purchase of commercial paper. This selling of exchange had tended to keep down rates well below the gold-export point. A shipment of $100,000 gold has been ar­ ranged for the Argentine. The Continental exchanges have not unnaturally moved in favor o f Berlin. The London check rate in Paris closed yesterday at 25.24 francs, comparing with 25.23 francs a week ago, and at Berlin the sterling check rate closed at 20.42J4 marks, against 20.43J4 marks last week. Berlin exchange in Paris as reported by cable yesterday was quoted 123.50 francs, against 123.25 francs last week. Compared with Friday of last week, sterling ex­ change on Saturday was very firm and recorded an advance of about 15 points on covering of shorts and anticipation of a favorable bank statement; demand was quoted at 4 8670@4 8680, cable trans­ fers 4 8710@4 8720 and 60 days 4 8280@4 8290. On Monday rates continued firm, chiefly due to the easier tendency in local money quotations; demand advanced 5 points to 4 8675@4 8685 and cable trans­ fers to 4 8715@4 8725; 60 days was marked up to 4 8310@4 8320. Firmness in discounts at London and lower rates for money here induced another ad­ vance in sterling to 4 8685@4 8695 for demand and 4 8720@4 8730 for cable transfers; 60 days receded 5 points to 4 8305@4 8315. The upward movement was checked on Wednesday, when a weaker tone be­ came evident and demand declined to 4 8670@4 8680; cable transfers to 4 8715@4 8725 and 60 days to 4 8295@4 8305; the main influence was liquidation by important speculative interests. On Thursday sterling ruled weak, with a further recession, due for the most part to easier English discounts and fresh selling by speculators here; the range was 4 8665@ 4 8675 for demand, 4 8710@4 8720 for cable trans­ fers and 4 8285@4 8295 for 60 days. On Friday the market ruled firm owing to the firmer discounts and higher money rates in London. Closing rates were 4 8295@4 4305 for 60 days, 4 8675@4 8685 for demand bills and 4 8720@4 8730 for cable trans­ fers. Commercial on banks closed at 4 81 *^@4 8 2 ^ and documents for payment 4 9 2 j£ @ 4 83. Cotton for payment ranged from 4 82*4 to 4 83j4 ; grain for payment 4 8 2 j4 @ 4 83.

GERM AN E M PERO R’S T W E N T Y -F IV E YEARS OF RU LERS HIP. Emperor William’s jubilee, celebrating the com­ pletion of a quarter century in his reign, has naturally brought up for consideration many interesting aspects o f a remarkable career. In one respect, the mere fact of the celebration reminds the world o f what may be called the youthfulness of spirit possessed by this distinguished sovereign. Except for the aged Austrian Emperor, and for the young Spanish King, who was born to the title, the Kaiser’s reign has been by far the longest of any sovereign now on a European throne. As against his twenty-five years o f rulership, the nearest other parallel is that of Emperor Nicholas of Russia, who came to his throne six years later than the German Emperor. Yet the qualities of energy, vigor of initiative, even impetuousness, which are commonly associated with youth are almost as marked with the Emperor to-day as they were when he first assumed power. Perhaps still more striking has been the fact that the ovation given the German Emperor during the present week has mainly taken the form of recogniz­ ing his work as a peaceful ruler. That such a con­ summation of twenty-five successive years o f sover­ eignty would be possible is something which would hardly have entered the mind of the observant world at the time when William ascended his throne in 1888. He was known at that time to be personally affiliated with the Junker party, whose habitual attitude toward European politics was then fami­ liarly described as “ rattling the sabre.” His own language at the time was not altogether reassuring, and it was known that he entertained little or no sympathy with his father’s Constitutional ideas. Indeed, the criticism of the world was most unfavor­ able in regard to the young Emperor, when he assumed the sovereignty after the brief and tragic reign of his dying father, Emperor Frederick, which had lasted only from March 9 to June 15, 1888. William had then to bear comparison with his father’s popularity; judgment on him was colored by the feeling of national grief at that sovereign’s untimely death. With the German Liberals, a feeling of bitter disappointment and chagrin could not possibly be avoided over this turn in events, which apparently augured so ill for their aspirations. Yet, although William came into power at a critical period in European diplomacy, when FrancoGerman hostility was still keenly alive, and although his country has repeatedly verged toward strained relations with other Powers since that time, the historic fact nevertheless is that during the quarter of a century in which he has ruled Germany, his coun­ try has never been at w ar; whereas every other Euro- June 21 1913.] TH E CH RONICLE pean State except Austria, Belgium, Holland and the Scandinavian countries has in that interval been engaged in one or more serious international conflicts. It is possible to raise the question, how much of this result should be placed to William’s credit and how much to that of the peaceful disposition on the part of his people or the conservative attitude of his Ministers. The Kaiser himself has on more than one occasion taken what might almost have been described as a belligerent attitude. His telegram to Kruger in the Transvaal at the time of the Jameson raid^vas an instance in point. Rightly or wrongly, popular rumor ascribed to him approval of the unfriendly acts of Admiral Diedrich toward our fleet in the Philippines during the Spanish war. The M orocco incident of 1911, which so gravely strained relations between France and Germany, was in its main aspect an acknowledged part of Will­ iam’s diplomatic policy. It remains to be said, however, that none of these incidents actually did result in war— which might easily have followed with an obstinate and ambitious Emperor— , and that, furthermore, in his personal relations with the other sovereigns, his influence has beyond question been consistently employed for peace. It is possible, indeed, that at the time when Austria was absorbing the provincial States which were drifting away from the Young Turk Govern­ ment, the German Emperor’s firm attitude prevented war between the other States involved. Having lived down the early criticisms to which we have referred, and the misgivings arising from his various impulsive utterances, and having also surmounted the highly unfavorable comment which grew out of his curt dismissal of Bismarck from the Chancellorship in 1890, the Emperor’s own person­ ality has had the best of chances to impress itself on the world. To-day it is recognized as undoubtedly the strongest personality among living sovereigns. In temperament and tendencies, William II. is a strange and perplexing mixture. One may say that he is, and has been all along, at once a historical anachronism and an embodiment of the spirit of his times. His constant and sometimes almost vio­ lent assertion of the divine right of kings, and his consequent placing of the Hohenzollern family in line with the designs of Providence, has a clearly mediaeval flavor. On the other hand, his insistent promotion of German commercial industry and insti­ tutions generally has marked him out as a modern administrator. Indeed, his great individual respect and official notice for men of affairs, even for mere men of great personal wealth, belong peculiarly to the Twentieth Century. In other directions, too, his career has presented contradictions. A constant and bitter antagonist of the Socialists, he has nevertheless been urgent, especially in the early years of his reign, in pressing schemes for bettering the condition of the laboring classes. It was largely under his auspices that the workingmen’s pension and insurance system, which, in a different form, England is now considering, was at a very much earlier period introduced and applied in Germany. His real achievements stand out all the more strikingly because of his tendency to under­ take almost everything— sometimes regardless of the question whether he was fitted to do it or not. The Emperor would be reported as trying his hand at poetry, at oratory, at patronizing music; even at preaching of a Sunday to the sailors of his fleet 1737 Yet, with all these experimental, and not always successful, undertakings, his achievements in pro­ moting the progress of German industry and com­ merce, and in emphasizing whatever tended toward distinctive German national life, are recognized as fully and fairly in Germany itself as in the outside world. Back of all this remains the highly important fact that, with all his assertion of the divine right of kings and of the absolutist theory, he has never once over-stepped, or tried to overstep, the German Constitution. The real power of this interesting sovereign has undoubtedly rested in the personality behind these various tendencies and peculiarities. Personality is often as potent a factor among the sovereigns of to-day as it ever was in the days of royal and imperial absolutism. The same throne in the Seventeenth Century was occupied by the three French rulers, Henry I V ., Louis X III. and Louis X I V ., whose careers were as different in their effect on the history of the time as those of any three men could possibly be. It was the individuality of the sovereigns rather than the character of their times which determined the actual career of each, and, in a large degree, the history of their country. Similar conditions, so far as the outside world can judge, may in our own time produce nonentities among the European sovereigns; it may produce an Emperor Francis Joseph or a Queen Victoria, with their potent in­ fluence on the lines of the older school of royalty; it may produce a Leopold of Belgium or a King Edward of England, who are abreast of the national necessities of the day, interested in industrial as well as political problems, and whose well-trained minds are adapted to supervise the business requirements of their respective nations. It is undoubtedly the achievements of this class of sovereigns which Emperor William has embodied, on an unusually important stage and through an unusually long consecutive period of time. There are necessary qualifications in this judgment. Recognizing, as he did, the rightfulness of the German Constitution and of German representative govern­ ment, the Kaiser has failed to recognize equally the spirit of that Constitution, especially as it inevitably developed with the progress of modern ideas. In this matter, he seems at times to have reverted to his original non-progressive ideas; of which the political result is seen in the present chaotic state of German polities, in the rise of the Socialist Party, which in Germany represents little more than a Constitutional opposition, and in the rather general feeling that great changes in the framework of government of the German Empire may be witnessed in the not very distant future. Had the Kaiser detected, recognized and directed these political tendencies of the day, as he did its industrial and social tendencies, his prestige and position would to-day be one of the most remarkable among modern sovereigns. ______________________ THE CO U N T R Y ’S T R E M E N D O U S PRODUCTION.

In fact, as far back as the output jumped to 20,023,947 tons and 1906 and 1906 the rail production was 3,977,887 tons. In 1907 saw a further increase to 23,398,136 tons and other directions, also, consumption by the railroads 23,362,594 tons, respectively.

Recovery occurred in 1909 and growth in the output of steel, in face of the diminished further growth in 1910, with a reaction in 1911 and consumption by the railroads, testifies to the great an advance to unprecedented heights in 1912.

Nevertheless, the preference which the railroads are showing for open-hearth rails will account for only a small part of the marvelous growth in the open-hearth make of steel during recent years. Besides the Bessemer and the open-hearth pro­ duct, a small amount of steel is made by other pro­ cesses. In 1912 121,517 tons of crucible steel were produced, 18,309 tons of steel by electricity and 2,853 tons by various minor processes. We annex the following table showing the steel production by each leading process for the years from 1898 to 1912 inclusive. IN U N IT E D ST A T E S IN GROSS T O N S .

S T E E L P R O D U C T IO N COTTON ACREAGE A N D CONDITION JUNE 1913. That there should be a well-defined inclination to increase the area devoted to cotton this spring is no more nor less than a natural outcome of condi­ tions prevailing anterior to and during the time when planting was carried on. Last year, as we pointed out at the time, the tendency toward enlargement of area was held in check by the phenomenal crop raised from the previous spring’s planting. Another crop, equally large, it was felt, might have a de­ pressing influence upon prices, notwithstanding the rapidly augmenting demand for cotton. Notwith­ standing this fear, however, the area seeded to the staple was not appreciably diminished. As a result of our investigations, it was found there had been only a nominal reduction (averaging 0.54% ). The crop has proved second only to that of 1911-12. Most important of all, it has been marketed on a very remunerative basis of prices. It is this last fact more than any other that has been instrumental in stimulating farmers to extend the current year’s planting to the extent of about 1M million acres, or 3.20% . The time has passed when the securing of an ex­ cellent yield in one year should cause planters, either of their own initiative or in response to specious advice of pretended well-wishers, to reduce planting, especially when prices were satisfactory, as they certainly have been in 1911-12 and in 1912-13. The demand for cotton has expanded so greatly of recent years that the getting together of a large surplus re­ serve stock is essential. How conditions have changed in the last quarter of a century! In 1890 at this time middling uplands ruled in the New York market at over 11 cents per lb.; from the planting of that and the succeeding season comparatively large crops for the period were obtained and prices fell off ma­ terially, and continued on a low level for some eight years, going, in fact, below 6 cents at times; this latter in 1897-98 and 1898-99, when two crops in excess of 11 million bales succeeded each other. 17351 Again, the large yield of 1904-05 caused a marked decline in prices— a drop below 7 cents at New York. Since then, however, there has been no time when middling has sold below 9 cents here, and the low­ est price last season was 9.20 cents. Moreover, notwithstanding the large carry-over of last August, and the early certainty that the current crop would finally pan out 14 million bales or more, a high level of values has at all times been maintained. In old times, either naturally or through manipulation, the occurrence of two such yields following each other would have meant a severe drop. The planter now holds a position of greater independence and is no longer under the necessity of selling, even at a sacrifice. In making our investigations into the extent of this season’s planting and the condition of cotton about the 15th of June, we have not been confronted 3,801 8,932,857 with such a situation as was experienced a year ago. Then, it will be remembered, the country suffered the most extensive overflow in the Mississippi Valley and contiguous territory that had been witnessed since 1897; in fact, the flood is stated by the Agri­ cultural Department to have overshadowed any former disaster of its kind there. Following the break on April 16 in Arkansas, there were numerous other crevasses, and at the end of June water was still flowing through the broken levee at Hymelia, above New Orleans. We have been endeavoring to obtain conclusive information as to the extent of last year’s flood and to what degree cotton­ growing land was involved, but have not had any very great measure of success.
