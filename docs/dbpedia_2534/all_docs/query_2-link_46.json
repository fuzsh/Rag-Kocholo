Industry professionals and friends were at great risk of losing homes, cars and could not provide for their families. They could not do what they truly love and what brings joy and “ therapy” to many Saskatchewan folks. After reaching out to our MLA, political leaders and ministers, collecting impact statements, and with much press and perseverance, opening the music industry a fraction was made possible. The survival of our industry as a whole depended on it, sadly we have had to say goodbye to some great live music treasures. This show is not about one particular genre of music. It is the coming together of the industry as a whole, a collective effort which shows only some of the professional versatility, wide musical tastes, genres, top notch songwriting and world class artists and performers in our province.\n\nSeptember 28, 2020\n\nCongratulations Tenille!\n\nCongratulations to Weyburn’s Tenille Arts for being named the C.C.M.A. Rising Star at this year’s CCMA awards!\n\nSeptember 15, 2020\n\nNew Music News – KARISSA HOFFART’S ALBUM “LIFE OF MINE” WILL BE THE INSPIRATION YOU NEED\n\nKarissa Hoffart’s album has already started to get traction through the three singles already released to country radio. Most describe Karissa as genuine and true to her passion of singing. Her songs enlighten you, bringing you emotions that were once forgotten. The album is set to take you through life’s ups and downs and realize that you can always find the good if you look hard enough.\n\nIt makes sense to have a country recording artist grow up in the badlands country of Saskatchewan. It’s clear to see her country roots shine through in her singing and songwriting. The album’s artwork resembles the country life Karissa lived and continues to live today. She works hard on the farm and the same goes for her music career. From opening for Tenille Arts last December to releasing her first album, Karissa does not hold back from her dreams and brings a big voice to the country industry.\n\nPreviously Hoffart has performed on the main stage at craven country jamboree, casino Regina, and at Telemiracle for many years now. Supporting and uniting communities of Saskatchewan, Karissa hosted her own drive in concert in August 2020! She was able to find a way to do what she loves, all while following the pandemic protocols. Since she has booked another outdoor concert for October 2020 and has many communities asking to host a concert.\n\nFor more information contact Karissa Hoffart at 1-306-861-6432 or send an email to karissahoffart@outlook.com.\n\nSeptember 15, 2020\n\nNew Music News – Jordyn Pollard Releases New Single\n\nJordyn Pollard has released a new single ‘Back to Us’ to Canadian radio. Reflecting back on her high school years, this song was so relatable to her. We hope when you listen, it will take you back to simpler times in life and put a smile on your face, like it did for us. Find it anywhere you purchase your music. https://music.apple.com/ca/album/back-to-us/1480359730?i=1480359962\n\nSeptember 14, 2020\n\nIG Wealth Management and the SCMA have partnered together to present to IG Wealth Clients an amazing opportunity for all SCMA Artists!\n\nIG Wealth Social causes align to include Seniors, Indigenous and youth.

They collaborated with 16 other Saskatchewan artists to create a musical message of love from Saskatchewan to the world. The song is a response to the global pandemic, about living through it, staying connected, and coming out on the other side. They aim to reach 1,174,000 people on YouTube…the population of Saskatchewan.https://youtu.be/pEKFfRGC0CY\n\n“Do right by all the people /Little things show you care /You can’t be there/ so for now Keep talking”\n\nOften collaborating as co-writers, Lyn & Terry decided to try a Bernie Taupin/Elton John style of songwriting online. For Elton John songs, Bernie writes the lyrics. Elton writes the music. So for WE’LL BE FREE 2020…Lyn wrote the lyrics. Terry wrote the music.\n\nThen Terry had an idea, “Why don’t we do a ‘We Are the World’ style of recording?” So Terry and Lyn invited some musical friends to participate in the project. Everyone picked one line from the song; then recorded their line and the chorus on their cell phones from the safety of their own homes; and sent their videos to Terry. Lyn directed traffic, reviewed audio/video takes – note by note and frame by frame and took to calling herself Quincy Jones. Terry spent more than 30 hours glued to his computer and completed an audio recording and a video.\n\nLyn and Terry are grateful to Jay Semko, Sylvia Chave, Desirée Hobbins, Glenn Sutter, Heather Desjardins, Shayne Lazarowich, Gillian Snider, Scott Anthony Andrews, Tom Kennedy, Krystle Pederson, Rhonda Gallant-Morari, Oral Fuentes, LJ Tyson, Larry Krause, Forrest Eaglespeaker and Terri Bear Linklater. All these artists have diverse backgrounds, career paths and experiences. They are singers, singer/songwriters and theatre artists in genres from roots, rock and country to pop, children’s music, reggae and more.\n\nFor artist bios see: https://www.saskmusic.org/news/the-latest\n\nMusic feeds the heart and soul but the body needs food.

The Saskatchewan Country Music Association is proud to welcome home to host this year’s awards show, Regina born and raised, Canadian country recording sensation, JoJo Mason!\n\nFor 604 Records recording artist JoJo Mason, the past three years have been an incredible journey. Now, with five Top 10 tracks under his belt, the BC based two-time CCMA Rising Star Award nominee is ready to hit the ground running once again, and he’s more than excited to see what’s on the horizon. “Future”, Mason’s aptly titled lead single from his 2019 sophomore EP Chapter Two, is closing in on four million streams, quickly becoming his highest streamed song to date. The track peaked Mason’s interest immediately, notably blending two of his favourite genres; country, with a little bit of soul. Written by Nashville singer/songwriter Mitchell Tenpenny, “Future” paints a vivid picture of what can happen when that one unforgettable moment occurs that changes your entire life, in ways no one could ever imagine; and for Mason, the song is nothing short of a game changer. Second single “Better On You” – another Tenpenny-penned track – highlights the more sensitive side of Mason. The Top 3 song has become his highest charting single to date, and is currently closing in 3 million streams respectively while his current single “As If We Won’t”, released November 25, 2019, has over 131K streams and is steadily climbing the charts at Canadian Country Radio. Co-written by Tenpenny, Lindsay Rimes & Matt Rogers, “As If We Won’t” switches gears from the approachable romance of “Future” and “Better On You” and rides the rollercoaster of an on-again-off-again love that neither person is ready to let go of. Where Mason shines brightest is in showcasing the dynamic, relatable layers of relationships through his sparkling vocals and larger than life, vibrant personality, and he is more than happy to continue providing the soundtrack for love in all capacities. Mason will be riding the momentum of Chapter Two right into 2020, kicking off the year by heading out on the road in support of Gord Bamford’s “#Rednek Music Fest” tour.\n\nThe 2020 SCMA Awards weekend will take place April 17th to 19th in Regina, with the final awards being presented on the televised awards broadcast the evening of April 18th.\n\nTickets for the entire weekend are on sale now.

I decided to learn how to record my own music (and there is still MUCH MUCH MORE to learn!) so that I could see my idea become reality. It is very exciting and meaningful to feature this song as my very first release as the Producer as well as the Artist.\n\nI felt a fire inside of me I have never felt before as I created the musical arrangement of this song and envisioning the story and imagery. There is a saying that goes something like, ” Your talent is God’s gift to you, and what you do with it is your gift back to God.” That is very much what this project means to me. God gave me the strength to create and complete this project.\n\nhttps://catherinelewans.ca/\n\nNovember 20, 2019\n\nDon’t miss this great Christmas Tradition in Prince Albert on Sunday December 1.

Early members and supporters of the SCMA, they were known as Saskatchewan’s premiere vocal group with exceptional polished three-part harmonies. The group consisted of three brothers, Rick and Keith on vocals and guitars, Myles on vocals and bass, who were supported by various drummers including Kent Cadman, Tom Cunningham and Gary Anderchuk.\n\nTheir kin folk harmonies, tight musicianship and professional stage presence put them in high demand and saw them performing in top venues throughout Canada such as The Canadian Brier curling championships, Craven country Jamboree, the Calgary stampede, the Gateneau Clogg in Quebec, and for the Saskatchewan Roughrider football team and the Saskatoon Blades. In addition to appearing in several TV shows, they toured on behalf of the Saskatchewan Arts Council doing sold out concerts right across the province. They headlined after concert parties for Garth Brooks and Brooks and Dunn and shared stages opening for Ian Tyson, George Fox, Patricia Conroy, and many others.\n\nThey charted with their original songs on Canadian radio, as well as over seas. At their peak they performed multiple shows per each week across Sask and Alberta making them one of the busiest acts of the era. During this time, they were the most nominated act ever at the annual SCMA awards, with multiple wins to their credit.\n\nToday, Rick lives in Outlook, Keith in Red Deer Alta, and Myles in Saskatoon. The brothers still perform live periodically, and do an annual show in their home town of Outlook in support of the local Hockey team.\n\nFebruary 12, 2019\n\nWarner Music Canada Artist Aaron Goodvin\n\nto host 30th Anniversary Saskatchewan Country Music Awards Show\n\nThe Saskatchewan Country Music Association (SCMA) is excited to announce Warner Music Canada recording artist Aaron Goodvin as the host for the 30th Anniversary Saskatchewan Country Music Awards, taking place Saturday, April 13, 2019 at TCU Place in Saskatoon.
