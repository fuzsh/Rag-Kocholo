Broadhurst,” which by implication is an antidote to this pessimistic cry for the government to rush to THE FIN ANCIAL SITUATION. The recent public utterances of M r. Wilson are the rescue of the individual: merely an autobio­ in tone so nearly like his article in the current number graphic sketch (which might have been made from of “ The World’s Work” that we may take the article hundreds and hundreds of cases) of how a boy fought as indicating what the President-elect has to say his way to success against the most adverse circum­ to the country in advance of official messages.

Moreover he is a student and a writer of history and he, of all men, ought to be alive to the futility and pregnant dangers of more attempts to have government make men happy by controlling everything. Bonar Law, leader of the Unionists in the House of Commons, with his party, went down to defeat on Wednesday when an effort to pass an amendment to the proposed Home Rule bill excluding Ulster from the operations of the bill was refused. The majority given to Premier Asquith was 97. Accord­ ing to press dispatches, the Unionist Party, which became strong so suddenly, is now badly divided, and a threatened general election this spring may show serious discord. Statements have been made that if the badgering of Bonar Law continues he will resign the leadership of the party, and other leaders, such as Lord Lansdowne and Austin Chamberlain, will desert him. Bonar Law has been at odds with many of his party since recent attacks on him on account of his food-taxation proposals. In the de­ feat of the Ulster amendment he made the assertion that Ulster would rather be ruled by a foreign coun­ try than by a Nationalist Parliament in Dublin. Winston Churchill, for the Government, replied, and suggested Germany as the country. The defeat of the Unionist amendment followed. Agreement was reached on Jan. 1 at Peking settling the details of the proposed Six-Power loan of $125,­ 000,000 to China. The new republic is to receive, according to press cable dispatches from Peking, . 6% below the sale price of the bonds. The Chinese audit department, under the advisership of Herr Romp, the German representative of the internation­ al banking group, will supervise the expenditure of the proceeds of the loan. China has agreed in prin­ ciple to an arrangement whereby the six Powers— United States, Great Britain, France, Russia, Ger­ many and Japan— undertake not to press for the immediate payment of compensation to foreigners for losses caused during the recent revolution. Russia alone claims $536,000. A mixed commission will assess the amounts due by China for these losses, and the funds for the payment of them will probably be derived from a supplementary loan. The present issue authorized is for forty years at 5% interest. Liquidation of the bonds begins at the end of seven years. The security is the salt gabel (tax) which the Chinese have pledged themselves to reorganize with the aid of the foreign advisers. Should this reorganization fail to take place within three years, the salt tax will be placed under foreign management, like the maritime customs. Japan is urging an alliance with China, according to press dispatches from Peking, which, American residents in Peking fear, is designed to frustrate a possible entente between the United States and China. The American residents on Monday cabled to Presi­ dent Taft urging immediate recognition of the Chinese republic. Japan, it is said, is extremely desirous of closer relations with China and is energetic in endeavoring to force the treaty. President Yuan Shi-Kai has shelved the question for the present, however, giving as the reason the desire to have the Chinese loan settled first. Im p o r ta n t progress tow ard a greem en t on th e fo r­ m al te r m s o f peace in th e B a lk a n W a r has b een m a d e 3 this week by the envoys at their meetings in London. After diplomatic skirmishing, in which Turkey first offered terms that were obviously intended to offset those of the Allies of the week previous, an amicable arrangement is reported whereby Turkey recedes from her position. She will, it is reported, rely on the Powers to settle her claims for retention of much of the territory she desires. Turkey’s change in attitude on Friday indicated an apparent willingness to surrender all the territory claimed by the Allies, with the exception of Adrianople and the Aegean Islands. This means that practically the whole of the Ottoman Empire, except Adrianople and the territory between it and Constantinople will be for­ feited. The extraordinary terms which the Turkish delegates had presented to the conference as a counter proposal to the demands of the Allies were: (1) the rectification of the Turko-Bulgarian frontier by making the boundary west of the line now occupied by the troops in the villayet of Adrianople; (2) the question of the status of Adrianople to be settled by Turkey and Bulgaria direct; (3) the cession of the remainder of European Turkey,including Yanina and Scutari to the Allies; (4) the Albanian and Cretan questions to be solved by the Powers, and (5) the Aegean Islands to remain Turkish. These terms were received with surprise by the Allies at a meeting on New Year’s Day, and the refusal to accept them was so spirited that the Turkish delegates then withdrew all their proposals except, as stated, the refusal to cede Adrianople and the Aegean Islands. The terms, however, are even now not popular with some of the Allies, Greece in particular. The latter is disappointed because she is not allowed to retain Salonica and the Chalcidice Peninsula, and is prevented from occupying Monas­ tir, which is taken by Servia. Greece is also obliged to renounce her possession of Avlona on the Adriatic. Even her right to remain in the islands ofThasos, Samothrace, Imbres, Lemnos, Myteline and Chios, islands which are distinctly Greek, is questioned. These latter islands are of international importance, as they command the entrance to the Dardanelles, while, in addition, Mytile and Chios bar the entrance to the Gulf of Smyrna. Some of the Allies have suggested a plan for the remaining problems. They propose that Adrianople and the Aegean Islands be ceded to the Powers for the Powers to decide to whom they shall belong. No decision has been reached on this proposal. The Powers, in the meantime, through the conferences of the Ambassadors, are withholding any advice, and awaiting definite action by the peace delegates. They are quoted by press dispatches to be in favor of Crete being annexed to Greece again, but in re­ turn for this friendly decision are themselves de­ sirous of deciding the future of the Aegean Islands. The status of Adrianople during the armistice con­ tinues without change, the city being in a state of siege and the allies allowing no food supplies to be taken in. On Thursday, however, the Allies per­ mitted a quantity of drugs to be carried into the city. A rumor cabled from Paris last evening asserted that Adrianople had surrendered. The other in­ cidents of actual warfare have been only minor engagements during the week between Turkish and Greek troops— the latter still refraining from signing the armistice— in which the Greeks are said to have been victorious. 4 THE CHRONICLE The attitude of Austria, which has been the real fear of Europe, continued to cause concern during the week. The large armies which were mobilized remain on active duty with no apparent thought of demobilizing. Austria is said to be urging the Am­ bassadors to make the territory of autonomous Al­ bania as large as possible, and include in it Prisrend, Djacova and even Scutari. Austria is known to be pressing for an Adriatic base, and is urging M onte­ negro, in exchange for the cession to it of Scutari, to permit Austria to have possession of the moun­ tains dominating Cattaro, which would thus become such an impregnable naval stronghold as to give Austria the control of the Adriatic Sea. Both Italy and Russia are strongly against this proposal and are endeavoring to curb the desires of the Dual King­ dom. Montenegro, it is said, regards the scheme as fatal to her own existence, and will oppose it vigor­ ously. The Balkan allies, in the form of brief in­ terviews from several of the leaders, allege that Aus­ tria’s scheme is to have this autonomous territory become as large as possible and then to seize it at the earliest opportunity. Another feature which is troubling the allies is the desire of Roumania to par­ ticipate in the spoils of the war. Roumania claims that by remaining neutral she aided the allies and is entitled to profit by the partition of Turkey. On Tuesday the Chamber of Deputies in Bucharest voted unanimously a $30,000,000 military credit to back up Roumania’s demands. [Vol. XCVI. New Year, and no new treaty has been prepared. The reason for the failure to enact a new commercial agreement is due to ’Russia’s refusal to recognize pass­ ports issued to American Jews. Relations with Russia will now rest on international law and offi­ cials look for no tariff reprisals. Trade relations, it is expected, will continue undisturbed unless there should be discrimination. Alfred von Kiderlen-Wachter, Secretary of For­ eign Affairs of the German Empire, died suddenly on Monday at Stuttgart. He had been ill for several days. His death is considered a great loss to Ger­ many in the present European situation. Herr Kiderlen-Wachter had an extensive knowledge of the affairs of the Far East and had been in the diplo matic service of Germany for many years. A crisis in the affairs of Mexico, particularly as to her relations with the United States, is said to be near. Dispatches from Washington on Tuesday stated that an ultimatum recently prepared by the State Department would be sent to Mexico without further delay. President Taft, the dispatches said, will take action after resting from his Panama trip. Conditions very close to anarchy are reported to pre­ vail in the State of Durango, and more men are, it is said, in rebellion at present than at any time since President Madero was successful in overthrowing the government of former President Diaz. The reason for the proposed ultimatum is said to be the lack of Opposition of the English medical profession to the effort by the Mexican Government officials to pre­ National Insurance Act has decreased during the last vent outrages against foreigners. week and it is now believed that there will not be suf­ The security markets of the world have this week ficient protest to prevent the Act from being carried into effect on Jan. 15.

This may perhaps be best indicated by re­ cording that call money on M onday did not exceed 7 % , which was the renewal rate, while on Tuesday the highest figure was 6 % . The disposition among New York bankers is now to look for a period of comfortable rates, although there is no expectation of really cheap money. However, the natural ten­ dency of the currency movement will now be to New York from the agricultural sections, where it has ful­ filled its annual mission of financing the gathering and marketing of the crops. Meanwhile, with tariff legislation so closely in view, and cumulative evi­ dence of caution in regard to entering into extensive commitments in the manufacturing and mercantile world, there is not likely to be the same rush for banking facilities in this channel as has recently been the case. Furthermore, the New Year and dividend and coupon payments will from now on gradually return to circulation. It is rather early to look for any definite indication as to the extent of the re-in­ vestment demand that will spring from these pay­ ments. The stock market, however, has opened the year with a fair show of enthusiasm, although dis­ tinct activity, suggesting investments, has not yet developed. Should there be any distinct hesitancy respecting this New Year demand, there seems a dis­ position to expect that professional operators, who in advance made preparations in the way of pur­ chases to supply it, will be inclined to convert their securities into cash. The so-called January re-in­ vestments, so far as the Stock Exchange securities are concerned, seem to be becoming each year less of a feature. This is probably explained by the in­ creased activity that is shown by investment houses in offering securities that are not listed on the Ex­ change, and which include the utility, municipal, manufacturing and other stocks and bonds of the smaller classes of corporations throughout the coun­ try. The extreme figures this week for call money have been 23^ and 7 % , which was also the range on M on­ day. On that day the renewal rate was 7 % . On Tuesday 6 % was the highest, 3 % the lowest and 6% the renewal basis. Wednesday, New Year’s Day, was a holiday; on Thursday 5 % was again the high­ est, while 434 was the lowest and 5 % % was the ruling rate. Friday’s maximum was 5 % , minimum 3% and renewal basis 4 % % . Time money rates at the close are substantially % % lower for the week and there is still a disposition among borrowers to await further concessions before entering into large com­ mitments. Closing quotations were 5 @ 5 % % for 60 days, 5 % for 90 days, 4 % @ 5 % for four months and 4 % @ 5 % for five months and six months. Rates for mercantile paper have not as yet been altered, but there is in this direction also an easier tone. Final quotations are 6 % for sixty and ninety-day endorsed bills receivable and also for four to six months’ single names of choice character; others are still quoted at 6 % % . [ V o l .

In fact there was a readjustment in the differences between rates for cable transfers as there had, at the close of the year, been an active demand for the latter for window-dressing purposes, while this week there has been a corresponding move­ ment in demand bills to cover the cable transfers. For the week sixty-day bills closed at an advance of 140 points, demand bills are also 140 points higher, while cable transfers are only 70 points higher. Sterling exchange in Paris closed at 25.18% francs, comparing with 25.14 a week ago, and the London check rate in Berlin closed at 20.4734 marks, showing that the Continental exchanges are once more moving in favor of London. Compared with Friday of last week, sterling ex­ change on Saturday was very firm, notably cable transfers, which advanced about 25 points on an active inquiry in connection with the London fort­ nightly settlement and the year-end requirements; the range was 4 8620@4 8630 for cable transfers, 4 8490@4 85 for demand and 4 8085@4 81 for 60 days. On Monday the market was weak and de­ clined at the opening to 4 8480 for demand and 4 8605 for cables, largely on the expectation of another flurry in local money rates; this was not realized, however, and later most of the decline was recovered, with de­ mand unchanged at the close at 4 8490@ 4 85, al­ though cable transfers and 60 days were still below Saturday’s final figures at 4 8610@4 8620 and 4 8080 @ 4 8090, respectively. The easing in the local money situation on Tuesday brought about a marked rise in sterling rates, to 4 8520@4 8530 for demand, 4 8620@4 8630 for cable transfers and 4 8115@4 8125 for 60 days. Wednesday was New Year’s Day. On Thursday there was an advance of about % c. in demand, due in some measure to the inquiries for remittance for dividend and coupon payments, to 4 8570@4 8580, and in 60-day bills to 4 8155@4 8165; cable transfers were also firm, advancing 10 points to 4 8630@4 8640. On Friday the market advanced 40 points for 60 days, 30 points for demand bills and 15 points for cable transfers. The closing quotations were 4 8195@4 8205 for 60 days, 4 86@ 4 8610 for demand bills and 4 8645@ 4 8655 for cable transfers. Commercial on banks closed at 4 7 9 % @ 4 81% and documents for payment at 4 8 0 % @ 4 81% . Cotton for payment ranged from 4 81% to 4 81% ; grain for payment 4 81% @ 4 82. The New York Clearing-House banks, in their operations with interior banking institutions, have gained $16,900,000 net in cash as a result of the cur­ rency movements for the week ending January 3. Their receipts from the interior have aggregated $23,400,000, while the shipments have reached $6,500,000. Adding the Sub-Treasury operations, which occasioned a gain of $100,000, the combined result of the flow of money into and out of the New York banks for the week appears to have been a gain of $17,000,000, as follows: Week ending January 3 1913.

The conviction of the accused dynamite conspira­ tors of the Structural Iron labor union last Saturday, by a Federal jury at Indianapolis, after a full and fair trial lasting from Oct. 1 to the close of last week, was in many ways an event of high importance in the social history of the day. The mere fact that a conspiracy of a peculiarly villainous and reckless character had been traced to its authors, and that the guilty parties had been punished, would not of itself stand out as anything very remarkable. Ordi­ nary criminals, even of the more vulgar sort, are apt to take precautions to guard against discovery, such as this band of conspirators seemed to regard as entirely superfluous. The detectives were there­ fore able to make their case with comparatively little difficulty, and the nature of the crime was such that, under ordinary circumstances, the jury’s verdict and the judge’s sentence would have been taken tor granted beforehand on the simple basis of the evi­ dence. But the circumstances were not ordinary. The very rashness of the conspirators and their agents had a particular cause. Their overconfidence and the doubts long entertained by the general public in regard to the probable outcome of the trial arose, without question, from the species of terrorism which has long prevailed with reference to any one who un­ dertook to expose the illegal or criminal actions of a labor union; accompanied, even in respectable classes of society, by a certain maudlin sympathy with acts of violence, so long as they were performed in behalf of the interests of the labor union. As is well known, the prosecution of the dynamit­ ers, who were condemned last Saturday and sen­ tenced last Monday, arose out of the McNamara episode of the year before at San Francisco. Through a skilled body of detectives, the dynamiting of the Los Angeles “ Times” building had been so posi­ tively brought home to the two McNamara brothers that they were led to confess their guilt. The pro­ found sensation which followed that confession was deepened by the positive announcement of the Gov­ ernment prosecutors that the McNamara outrage was merely a part of a nation-wide conspiracy conducted under the auspices of the labor union of which the McNamaras had been officers and agents. Most people very probably imagined that the in­ timations of the Government prosecutors as to what they expected to prove and whom they expected to convict were the result of something like over-as­ surance. As a matter of fact, the story of the evi­ dence submitted at Indianapolis was followed very imperfectly by the general public at the time of its submission, in October and November; the country being then absorbed with Presidential politics and the Balkan war almost to the exclusion of all other topics. Those who examined the result of the tes­ timony, however, were aware that a network of ex­ 7 traordinary tightness had closed around the accused men; that overwhelmingly convincing evidence had been produced that a conspiracy, directly and openly participated in by the officers of this laborunibn, for the purpose of dynamiting buildings constructed by non-union concerns, had been in progress during the past seven years. One thousand dollars per month of the funds of the union had been actually set aside to facilitate these explosions. There had been no less than 105 explosions of the sort— some of them of buildings and some of them of bridges— which were clearly brought home to the labor union and to the defendants in the trial. In form, the indictments in the case were based on the offense of carrying explosives from State to State in violation of the law. It was perfectly well known, however, that, though this was the ostensible charge to be proved, the real accusation was that of con­ spiracy to dynamite buildings of hostile business firms or contractors. At the start, fifty-four separate in­ dividuals were named among the defendants, the number being subsequently reduced to forty. It was on Thursday of last week that the case went to the jury. The jurymen remained out during nearly two days, and only on Saturday afternoon, Dec. 28, did they bring in their unanimous verdict of guilty. On the following Monday, Federal Judge Anderson imposed the penalties. Because of the fact already referred to— that the indictment had not been spe­ cifically for murder of conspiracy to murder— the scope of possible sentences was not great. The Judge very rightly imposed his heaviest penalty on the highest officer of the union, who had been proved to have been connected with the conspiracy. Frank M . llyan, the President of the structural organization was sent to prison for seven years; other accom­ plices for six; and so the conspiracy ranged downward to a group of convicted defendants who were re­ leased under suspended sentence. We have said that the importance of this conviction far supersedes the mere fact that a great crime has been punished. The incident is important, first, as proving the American people to be sound in their view of offenses of this sort; second, as proving that juries are still to be found who are too courageous to be intimidated. We have heard much during the past few years of labor’s presumed immunity from the penalties and responsibilities to which all other portions of our society are amenable, and much of the presumable unwillingness of juries to convict for such offenses. When the McNamara brothers were responding to their sentences, one of the two scoundrels seized the occasion to explain that he had committed his cowardly crimes, and thought himself right in doing so, because of his “ feeling for labor.” It will be remembered that at the time a similar view of the whole affair was expressed in circles very far removed from the field of professional and habitual crime. If we are not mistaken, there were clergy­ men who from their pulpits all but defended the M c­ Namaras’ act, and carefully pointed out how much it differed from a similar action inspired by other motives. T o what extent this pitiful view of social responsi­ bilities and the principles of modern civilization really prevailed at any time in the community at large, it was difficult to ascertain. But that this foolish and mawkish sentimentality was the opinion of the American people as a whole, there has never been the slightest reason to suppose, and those who 8 T H E C H R O N IC L E entertained any such theory must have received something of a shock when they read and heard the opinions expressed, at the time of the McNamara confessions and of last Saturday’s verdict, not only by the vast majority of thinking people, but by rep­ resentatives of labor, who had no idea of linking their own cause with conspiracy and crime. In this respect the peculiar atrocity of the offense of the convicted conspirators served at least one useful purpose; that it carried the theory and system of labor-union terrorism to its logical consequence. It does not require very complex reasoning to con­ vince' the average man that if labor as a body is to be permitted the privilege of avenging its own sup­ posed wrongs through murder, arson and assassina­ tion, then it will be very difficult to draw the line at which at any body of men bound together for whatever purpose could be denied the similar right. When the case is thus presented, the argument from common sense and civilization is overwhelmingly convincing. But we think the still more useful lesson of the episode is what it indirectly proves. Nothing can be more clear than that the kind of work to which this particular conspiracy directed its energies was a logical corollary to the far more familiar acts of violence by strikers against their employers or against non-union laborers. The argument that because certain men are laborers dissatisfied with the terms of their employment, therefore they have the right to destroy the property of their employers and to maim or murder the men sent to replace them, has been heard during many years. Even to-day there are many well-meaning men who argue, in a muddled way, that somehow the case of crime or violence is different when the demands of labor are at stake. We regard it, therefore, as not alto­ gether unfortunate that this extraordinary episode of the past twelve months should have shown the consequences which such ideas of the relations of labor unions to the law will logically bring upon American society if the public authorities fail to ap­ ply the law impartially and without discrimination. RETROSPECT OF 1912. The most striking characteristic of the calendar year 1912 will always be the fact that it was marked by uninterrupted trade expansion from beginning to end, in face of a series of untoward events, circum­ stances and developments which ordinarily would have been sufficient to occasion trade reaction if not trade prostration. It was a year of a Presidential election, which in itself usually acts as a damper on trade activity. For that reason, hardly anyone com­ petent to express an opinion on such matters looked for a genuine revival in trade. When 1912 opened the effects of the reaction encountered in 1910 and 1911 were still in evidence, and the general belief was that business would remain more or less unsettled during 1912, or at least until after the Presidential election; but expectations in that regard were agree­ ably disappointed. As it happened, too, it developed as the year pro­ gressed that the issues involved in the election were to be of grave importance and the contest of very exceptional character. But even this did not inter­ fere with the growing feeling of confidence in trade circles or to check steadily widening activity. It turned out that the Presidential contest was to be [VOL. XCVI. a triangular one, and that .the third candidate was to be a man havingahold on the masses, which made his appeal to the electorate on behalf of menacing doctrines unusually dangerous. In the early part of the year Mr. Roosevelt was still dissembling. Ho sought to convey the impression that he was un­ willing to run, that, in fact, it would be a sacrifice for him to accept a nomination, and that it would be impossible to prevail upon him to run unless there should be an unmistakable and overwhelming demand upon him to that end. But when evidence began to multiply that Mr. Taft, if unopposed, would get a renomination, and thus become the party candidate, Mr. Roosevelt quickly threw aside all disguise, and not only announced his willingness to accept, but determined upon a most vigorous fight to get the nomination. More than that, in seeking a re­ nomination he determined to take a new step in his doctrine of radicalism. He demanded for the voters the right of recall of judicial decisions on important questions of the day, and also, in certain contingen­ cies, the right of recall of judges. He failed in his endeavor to get the nomination from the Republican Party, then cried fraud and concluded to run as an independent candidate on a platform of his own making even more radical than anything he had previously advocated. In his campaign he de­ nounced both the great parties as being controlled by bosses and special interests, though, obviously, if he had succeeded in having himself again chosen by the Republican Party this cry would not have been raised. It was clear from the first that, running as a third candidate, he had not the remotest chance of being elected. This may have been the reason why his appearance as a candidate did not have any seriously disturbing effect on business. As a matter of fact, he got a surprisingly large number of votes, and the doctrines embodied in his platform involved a dis­ tinct menace to constitutional government. But, by running himself, he also made Mr. Taft’s success impossible. The truth is, he split the Republican Party wide open. His course insured victory in ad­ vance for the Democratic ticket. This made the Democratic candidate and the Democratic platform of unusual importance. But here, also, the condi­ tions were far from encouraging. As it turned out, William J. Bryan completely dominated the National Democratic Convention. He would not consent to the nomination of any but a radical candidate, and succeeded also in having the Democratic platform molded to his radical ideas. Woodrow Wilson was and is a man of high attainments and of excellent character, but he was committed to radical policies and proceeded to proclaim his stand in his subsequent appeal for election. This left Mr. Taft as the sole conservative candidate in the field— only semi­ conservative at that, but at least repudiating the doctrine of judicial recall and declaring flatfootedly for the maintenance of the Constitution and its limi­ tations and restrictions. With the Republican vote, however, divided between two candidates, Mr. Taft’s canvass was a hopeless one. Accordingly, Mr. Wil­ son’s election was a foregone conclusion, and with it also there came the certainty of the triumph of the Democratic Party in Congress. But the wave^of business activity kept rising higher and*jstill|higher in face of all?this. J an . 4 1913.] T H E C H R O N IC L E Many other political developments were also such as to suggest caution. The Banking and Currency Committee of the House of Representatives, with Mr. Pujo as Chairman, conducted a ' money trust” in­ vestigation whose purpose it seemed to be to attack existing methods in financial circles for the purpose of discrediting them and replacing them with other methods in accordance with new and crude theories and devices. The clearing houses were held up to public condemnation; so was the Stock Ex­ change and also many financial leaders; even Mr. J. P. Morgan being put on the stand late in the year (in December), though to the discomfiture of the in­ vestigators. It being a Presidential year, both par­ ties were engaged in making political capital for themselves, regardless of the effect upon business and the danger of disturbing confidence. Further­ more, Congress remained in continuous session until very late in the year, adjournment not occurring until Aug. 26, and tariff legislation occupied a large share of the discussions through the whole period. In the House the Democrats were in undisputed control, while in the Senate there were enough^Republican insurgents in conjunction with the Demo­ crats to secure defeat for any attempt at Republican obstruction influenced by a protective tariff policy. Two tariff bills actually did go through both Houses and were only saved from becoming laws by the inter­ position of the Presidential veto. A wool bill passed both Houses and was vetoed by Mr. Taft, then was re-passed over the veto by a two-thirds vote in the House, but failed in the Senate. A bill to revise the metal schedules also reached the President, was like­ wise vetoed by him, and re-passed by a two-thirds majority in the House, but failed in the Senate. Bills revising other schedules of the tariff also re­ ceived the approval of the House, and could, with certain modifications in each instance, have obtained the necessary support in the Senate, if it had not been felt that it would be a waste of time, in view of the certainty of a veto. Perhaps it was the knowledge of the certainty that there coukkbe no tariff legislation in view of the con­ flict between the Executive and Congress that made business interests apparently indifferent to what was going on. At all events, industrial activity continued undiminished. After the election, when it was seen what an overwhelming victory the Democrats had achieved, owing to the division in jthe Republican ranks, and when, with the announcement by Presi­ dent-elect Wilson thatjCongress would be convened in extra session not later than the middle of April it dawned upon the public mind that the Democrats after *the fourth of March 1913 would be in control of all branches of the Government, and thus be in position to change the economic policy which has pre­ vailed in this country for about fifty years (barring a brief periodjduring one of the Cleveland adminis­ trations), there seemed to come a realizing sense of the consequences^that might be involved in such a departure. It thus happened that after the middle ob- November a disposition grew up to take a sober view o f t h e possible effect of tariff changes where previously’ there appeared to be complete indiffer­ ence,Tand in financial circles a more or less cautious spirit became manifest, it being considered wise to proceed slowly^pendinglthe finaljoutcome. The ef­ 9 fect of these more sober views was at once reflected on the Stock Exchange, but trade and industry were under such an impetus, and capacity for production was engaged so far ahead, that no trace of a retarding influence was discernible in the year’s business. It is to be noted also that the Administration at Washington continued active in its trust prosecu­ tions, and it is quite possible that political considera­ tions played some part in these, as there would natur­ ally be a desire to appeal to the radical element in the population. To enumerate all the new actions that were started under the Sherman Anti-Trust Law would take altogether too much space in this general review. They will all be found recorded in our narrative of the different events, month by month. We may note here, however, that in May the Government went so far as to begin a suit against the parties in this country identified with the coffee valorization plan inaugurated several years ago under the auspices of the Brazilian Government. This had the effect not only of arousing the parties to the suit, but of stirring up the Brazilian Minister to the United States. In April, after fruitless negotiations with the International Harvester Co. for voluntary dissolution, an action against that company was started. Dissolution decrees were also entered against the so-called Powder Trust (M ay), the Aluminum Trust (M ay), the Pacific Coast Plumbing Supply Association, the Central West Publishing Co. et al (August), while the National Packing Co. (June) agreed to voluntary dissolution. In January, suits under the Anti-Trust law were begun against the American Naval Stores Co. et al., alleging unlawful combination and conspiracy in restraint of trade in spirits of turpentine, resin, &c., and a Federal grand jury at Buffalo brought in an indictment against the Association of Coaster Brake Licensees et al. In February a Federal grand jury at Cincinnati indict­ ed thirty officials of the National Cash Register Co. on charges of criminal violation of the Sherman Law, while in August suit was begun against the Motion Picture Patents Co. et al, and also against the Associated Bill Posters and Distributers of the United States and Canada. In March the Kindlingwood Trust was enjoined. Two further suits were also begun against steam­ ship lines, charging them with combination to monop­ olize and illegally restrain commerce between the United States and foreign countries. One was in­ stituted in March against the American Asiatic Steamship Co. and the other in June against the Prince line et al, the latter charging an attempt to monopolize the freight and passenger traffic between the United States and Brazil. In December came the indictment of Charles S. Mellen of the New Haven road and the officials of the Grand Trunk R y., to­ gether with a whole host of other suits under the Anti-Trust law— one against the Kellogg Toasted Corn Flakes Co., one aganst the Philadelph:2 Jcl ’ * ' Confectioners’ Association, one against the Elgin Board of Trade and the American Association of Creamery Butter Manufacturers and one against the “ Horseshoers’ Trust.” As against these, however, there were several notable instances of failures in criminal prosecutions under the Sherman Law. In March the trial of the Chicago beef packers, which had been commenced 1 0 THE C H R O N IC L E the previous Dec. 6th, resulted in a verdict of ac­ quittal for all of the defendants. The same month, in the trial of the four officers of the American Sugar Refining Co. in connection with matters relating to the Penn. Sugar Refining C o., the jury announced a disagreement, but was understood to have stood 11 to 1 for acquittal. In M ay, in the prosecution of those connected with the so-called Wall-paper Trust, a jury in the Federal Court at Cleveland rendered a verdict acquitting four wall-paper manufacturers and four wall-paper jobbers on the charge of criminal conspiracy in restraint of trade. Numerous decisions by the United States Supreme Court interpreting and expounding the anti-trust law were also among the events of the year, and some of these were hardly of an assuring character. In March came what is known as the patent rights decision, which encouraged the notion in certain quar­ ters that in cases where a patent monopoly was con­ cerned the Sherman Law could be disregarded. In November, however, in the so-called Bathtub Trust case, where the Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co. and sixteen corporations and thirty-one individuals were charged with monopolizing the manufacture and sale of enameled ironware in the United States, the United States Supreme Court held that the license agreements by which control was held “ clearly transcended what is necessary to protect the use of the patent or the monopoly which the law conferred upon it. They accomplished a restraint of trade condemned by the Sherman Law.” In April the United States Supreme Court held unanimously that the Terminal R R . Assn, of St. Louis was a con­ spiracy in restraint of trade in contravention of the Sherman Law. In December, in the Union Pacific merger case, the Supreme Court held that dominating ownership by the Union Pacific in the Southern Pacific was in conflict with the Anti-Trust law, and later in the same month a decision in the anthracite coal cases involved condemnation of the so-called 65% contract under which the independent producers had bound themselves to deliver their output to the railroad carriers for 65% of the average market price at tidewater. All these decisions seemed to show that under the “ rule of reason” laid down in the Tobacco and the Oil cases the previous year, the operation of the Sherman Law was being widened and extended. The stock market reflected the effects of this feeling, but as far as general business is concerned, they came too late in the year to have any influence. It so happened that labor involvements were un­ usually numerous both in the United States and in Europe. The demand of the locomotive engineers on the Eastern trunk lines for higher wages and other concessions was presented at the very opening of the year. The matter was not settled until towards the close of November, when a decision was made the effect of which will be to add to the yearly expenses of the roads only $1,500,000 to $2,000,000 instead of the $7,000,000 addition which would have resulted if the demands of the engineers had been granted. In the interval the possibility of a strike had loomed large, but had been happily averted by referring the whole question to arbitration. Not long thereafter, that is in M ay, the firemen and enginemen also made demands for increased wages [V o l . X C V I. which in their entirety would have called for an ad­ dition of $25,000,000 to $30,000,000 in the yearly expenses of the roads. This controversy still re­ mained unsettled at the close of the year, and the indications were that a compromise would be reached on some basis less extreme than that embodied in the original demands of the men, and yet involving a very considerable increase in the yearly outlays of the roads. In September a pretty general advance in wages was voluntarily made by Southeastern roads. In the spring sharp differences also arose in the coal-mining regions, and the operators had to contend with a demand for higher pay in both the anthracite regions and the bituminous regions. Both classes of miners eventually secured a portion of what they had been asking for, and in the meantime min­ ing remained completely suspended in the anthra­ cite regions during the whole of April and for the greater part of M ay. In the bituminous regions an agreement was reached at the very close of March, but as referendum votes of the miners had to be taken on the propositions, suspension of mining occurred here, too, in a good many sections for a larger or smaller period during the month of April. One re­ sult of the advance in wages granted the anthracite miners was an increase in the price of the domestic sizes of coal at tidewater of 25c. a ton, which aroused much public criticism. In Great Britain cessation of coal-mining on a gigantic scale occurred, the point at Issue in this instance being the question of a mini­ mum wage. The strike continued throughout the month of March, paralyzing industrial activity in the United Kingdom. It was estimated that, besides the 1,000,000 miners directly involved, 2,000,000 more persons were thrown out of employment be­ cause of the inability to get supplies of coal. The British Government found itself obliged to intervene and a minimum wage bill was enacted. A referendum vote of the miners was apparently in favor of the con­ tinuation of the strike,but the miners in such large num­ bers returned to work that practically full resumption of mining occurred April 8. It is to be noted, too, that on May 24 another strike of the dockers was ordered in London, holding up temporarily a large number of ships in the Thames. This strike of the dock workers was still causing trouble in July, and, as indicating the bitterness of feeling existing on the part of the strikers, a prayer was uttered at one of their meetings asking that God strike Lord Devenport (who had been active in opposition) dead. Many other differences with labor occurred from time to time during the course of the year. In Massachusetts the new law limiting work to 54 hours a week led to serious trouble in the textile in­ dustry. At Lawrence, Mass., the operatives at the woolen mills quit work when it appeared that they were to get only 54 hours’ pay for 54 hours’ work, and for many successive weeks scenes of blood­ shed and violence were enacted. This Lawrence strike at the woolen mills of the American Woolen Co. (the largest woolen and worsted manufacturers in the world) was not settled until March, when advances averaging about 7 j^ % were granted. In the mean­ time business had greatly improved, and throughout New England generally advances in wages ranging from 5 to 10% were granted at the various textile mills, cotton and woolen. J a n . 4 1913.1 T H E C H R O N IC L E Among the minor labor disturbances of one kind or another which marked the course of the year may be mentioned the freight-handlers’ strike at Chicago in M ay, and also a newspaper strike at the same point during the same month, as a result of which the peo­ ple of Chicago for a number of days were without their regular newspaper service, even the newsboys having joined in the movement and interfered to prevent the delivery of the papers. The year was one, too, of numerous disasters. The sinking in April of the White Star ocean steamer Titanic, with the enormous number of lives which this involved, many of them persons of conspicuous prominence in the world’s activities, ranks among the most startling events in the history of ocean naviga­ tion. The destruction by fire of the Equitable block in this city was also an event of no ordinary impor­ tance, especially as the fire temporarily placed be­ yond reach of their owners securities valued at hun­ dreds of millions of dollars. Then, also, the over­ flow of the Mississippi, which occurred in the spring, exceeded all former records as to rise; the breaks in the levees, it was estimated, aggregated in length about 20 miles, covering about 8,000 square miles of territory and necessitating very extensive relief measures on the part of Congress. To all this must be added the long-feared outbreak of war in Southeastern Europe between Greece and the Balkan countries (Servia, Bulgaria and Monte­ negro) on the one side and Turkey on the other side. This came quite unexpectedly, and the immediate effect was to cause a financial revulsion all over Europe, with panicky conditions in the security mar­ kets and a general rise in the discount rates of the leading European banks. The war between Italy and Turkey for the possession of Tripoli had not been definitely terminated when this new war, of much larger proportions, was precipitated. The United States was in position to render important services to the Old World in taking over the immense masses of securities which European holders were forced to throw over as a result of the liquidation which the Balkan war precipitated. The war began in Octo­ ber and was pushed with extraordinary vigor on the part of the Balkan allies, who were evidently well prepared beforehand, and soon had the Turk com­ pletely at their mercy, so that by the end of the month he was suing for peace. The loss of lives on both sides was frightful, and doubtless if it had not been for the outbreak of cholera in the Turkish ranks the Bul­ garian army would not have desisted in its victorious advance until it had reached the gates of Constan­ tinople, instead of resting 12 or 15 miles this side of that point. In the face of this formidable array of disturbing incidents and events in the political, the financial, the industrial and the international world, the course of trade and business made, as already stated, almost uninterrupted progress, and new records for activity and for volume of business were established in many directions. If there is a seeming paradox in such an outcome under the state of things narrated above, an explanation must be sought in the course of af­ fairs during the preceding two years. In 1910 and 1911 trade in the United States undoubtedly suffered a setback. The reaction, it must be admitted, was slight, but in this country steady growth is the rule 11 under normal conditions, and hence, when the coun­ try’s industries stand still, as it were, we may be sure there is restriction in demand and a curtailment of consumption. Where trade reaction does not culminate in a commercial or financial revulsion, such deficiencies must sooner or later be made up. In brief, in 1910 and 1911 we did not, it would seem, fully supply our needs, and in 1912 had to meet not only current requirements but also make good the arrears. It is to be remembered that the consump­ tive requirements of a population of over 90 millions are very large, and at times may become very urgent. When wholesalers and retailers combined all begin to realize simultaneously that, as a result of the policy pursued for a year and a half, or more, of buy­ ing only from hand to mouth, stocks of goods have been reduced to an exceedingly low point and need replenishing— when such a realization comes all at once to the entire population— there is the certainty that things will begin to hum. That appears to have been the situation during 1912. At such a psycho­ logical moment, too, confidence begets confidence, and a hopeful frame of mind in one direction soon becomes duplicated in another. The origin of the trade revival of 1912 is to be found in more senses than one in 1911. In the first instance, it undoubtedly had its inception in the great break in iron and steel prices which occurred in the summer of 1911. Previously the concensus of opinion seemed to be that violent declines in iron and steel prices should be resisted, with a view to pre­ venting a drop to below cost levels. There were legitimate arguments for such a course, but the effect unquestionably was to restrict buying out of lack of confidence in the basis of values. When, therefore, a break actually occurred— and a severe one at that — and when rumor had it that in many lines the new prices were below cost, a buying movement set in which was never arrested from that time up to the close of 1912. At these prices every one could feel that values had got down to bed-rock, and that, hence, there was no risk in giving orders with great freedom. Not only that, but at such prices there was an inducement for undertaking much work that did not exist before. Thus it happened that a grad­ ually widening circle of activity developed under which prices also improved and eventually reached figures assuring an ample margin of profit. The iron and steel industry is commonly accepted as a barometer of trade, but it likewise exercises a power­ ful influence in advancing or retarding trade in general. As a further help in promoting expansion in the iron and steel trade, the necessities of the railroads played a very prominent part. At first the revival in iron and steel proceeded in face of very limited orders from the railroads, which ordinarily consti­ tute the largest single consumer of iron and steel in the country. Later the railroads also began to pur­ chase very liberally and their orders served to give additional momentum to the expanding activity in iron and steel. The position of the railroad industry the last few years has been a most unfortunate one under Government regulations 'which [forbid an ad­ vance in freight rates while at the same time cost of operations, under advancing wage schedules and higher prices for materials, keeps steadily increasing. 12 Thus, railroad managers could buy only sparingly, for the double reason that declining net earnings imposed economy and that the same circumstance impaired the credit of the roads and prevented bor­ rowing except on onerous terms. But after defer­ ring the placing of orders for equipment and other things for a long time, further deferrals became in 1912 out of the question. More equipment was ab­ solutely necessary in order to take care of the growing volume of traffic provided by expanding business in all branches of industry. The need for further equip­ ment was additionally emphasized when it became certain that the year was to be one of great plenty in the agricultural world, and that the country’s trans­ portation lines would be called upon to handle a vol­ ume of grain tonnage never previously equaled. It is to be noted that new railroad consumption was unusually small, indicating the lack of faith existing among capitalists and investors in the paying char­ acter of railroad property. The “ Railway Age Gazette” puts the aggregate of new road built at somewhat less than 3,000 miles, and says it is neces­ sary to go back fifteen years, namely to 1897, to find a year when as small a railroad mileage was built as in 1912. The activity in the railroad world to which we have referred was mainly in the orders for new equipment. On that point the “ Railway Age Gazette” says that to find a year in which as large a number of locomotives and as large a number of freight cars was ordered it is necessary to go back six years, to 1906. Our contemporary furnishes records showing that orders for freight cars given in 1912 ag­ gregated 226,195 cars, against only 133,117 cars in 1911, and that the number of new freight cars actually built during 1912 was 148,357, as against only 70,931 cars built in 1911. With trade already in a state of great activity, the large crops raised were a powerful influence in keeping it so. The country’s grain harvests were of unexampled dimensions, and the contrast with the previous year was all the more striking by reason of the crop shortage then experienced. The winterwheat yield as a whole was very poor, an enormous amount of the area having had to be abandoned by reason of winter-killing. On the other hand, the spring-wheat crop proved very large, and conse­ quently the total wheat crop ran 100,000,000 bushels larger than in 1911. In the case of corn, the pro­ duction is estimated at 3,124,000,000 bushels for 1912, against only 2,531,000,000 bushels in 1911, and the oats crop at 1,418,000,000 bushels, against only 922,000,000 bushels. As a result of these large yields, an appreciable decline in grain prices occurred, but there was nevertheless very little relief from the high cost of living. Meat prices in particular ruled extraordinarily high and beef on the hoof in Chicago sold at figures not previously reached since the close of the Civil War— in December there were sales of beef on the hoof at $12 per cwt. The latter half of the year railroad earnings began to share in the general improvement. During the first six months of the year the character of the re­ turns was rather indifferent. There was a moderate gain in gross revenues, but it was entirely consumed by augmented expenses, so that net earnings were actually somewhat smaller than in the first six months of the previous year, notwithstanding that it was [Vol. XCVI. T H E C H R O N IC L E necessary to earn interest and dividends on a larger capitalization. Compilations published by us in the “ Chronicle” of Aug. 31 showed an increase of $56,­ 349,506 in gross, or 4.30% , but a loss of $2,037,477 in net earnings. In the last half of the year, how­ ever, the situation changed decidedly for the better. Under the larger crop movement and the continued activity of trade, the gains in gross earnings were now very large, and this also brought a considerable amount of improvement in the net, the gain repre­ senting, however, in the case of some of the separate roads, a recovery in part of what had been lost the previous year. As an index to the expansion in the iron trade, it may be noted that, according to the “ Iron Age,” the make of iron in October (31 days) reached the unprecedented figure of 2,689,933 tons and in N o­ vember (30 days) 2,630,854 tons, this comparing with 2,057,911 tons in January. The shipments of iron ore from the Upper Lake ports reached 47,­ 435,777 tons for the season of 1912, against only 32,130,411 tons in 1911 and 42,628,758 tons for 1910. The Steel Corporation reported unfilled or­ ders N ov. 30 of 7,852,883 tons, against only 5,084,761 tons Jan. 1; as early as April the Corporation re­ ported 93% of its capacity employed and in De­ cember the ratio was 95% . In the early part of the year profits from the steel business were very meagre, production being on orders taken a long time pre­ viously, when prices ruled exceedingly low. The latter half of the year, however, with the old orders pretty well worked off, profits increased. In Janu­ ary the net earnings of the Steel Corporation were only $5,243,406 but in August they had increased to $10,583,377. The copper trade, too, was fa­ vored to an unusual degree. Production was the largest on record, and yet stocks were steadily re­ duced until the latter part of the year. In March the price of the metal touched 15c. for the first time in five years and subsequently got close to 18c. The country’s foreign trade was likewise of unexampled dimensions, and this applies to both the exports and the imports. For the 11 months ending N ov. 30, 1912, the value of the merchandise exports was $2,148,563,324, as compared with only $1,867,619,­ 610 in the corresponding eleven months of 1911, and of the merchandise imports, $1,664,309,560, against $1,391,684,958.

In December easier conditions again developed, though on Dec. 26 and 27 the call-loan rate touched 12%. The last three months of the year time loans and also commercial paper of the best grades held close to 6 % most of the time. The Secretary of the Treasury was frequently urged to increase the amount of Government depositsin the banks, and on the reassembling of Congress a bill was actually introduced to make additional deposits of $50,000,000, but there was never any real need for such aid, and, as a matter of fact, the Government was not absorbing any large amounts of cash. Total cash in Sub-Treasuries (including the $150,000,000 gold reserve) was $354,591,895 Jan. 1 and diminished to $341,544,417 March 1 and $342,734,894 June 1. The large corporation tax payments in June increased the holdings to $368,­ 836,347 July 1 and to $373,020,860 Aug. 1; but there was no further addition during the active cropmoving period, and on Dec. 31thetotal stoodat$371,245,293. Government deposits in the banks were not greatly changed from month to month through­ out the year. One incident was an advance in the rate required by the Government on these deposits from 1% to 2% . Early in the year New York was still making loans abroad and extending aid, particularly to Germany. Gradually, however, these loans were paid off, and even before the panicky conditions which developed in Europe in October, most of the money loaned abroad had been recalled in view of the active de­ mand at home. The New York Clearing-House banks (not including the trust companies) showed a deficit below the required cash reserves three times, namely on March 30, on July 6 and again on N ov. 30. Quick recovery, however, ensued on each occasion. The trust companies (by themselves) frequently fell below the cash requirements. Combining the two classes of institutions, there was a deficiency only twice, namely July 6 and N ov. 30— a little over $5,000,000 on each occasion. The maximum of surplus cash reserve held was Jan. 27 at $48,763,050. The surplus D ec. 28 was $6,396,600. M oney hold­ ings of the combined institutions were at the highest Jan. 27 at $479,952,000 and at the lowest Dec. 7 at $374,436,000, with the amount Dec. 28 $385,132,000. The course of our foreign exchange market was irregular. The United States held a very favorable position in the foreign trade, but we exported gold in considerable amounts several times during the first seven months and it was not until the latter part of the year that we were able to command gold imports, though the urgency of the European money markets was even then such that it was necessary to moderate our desires for the metal in order not to cause disturbance abroad and further advances in discount rates, already at a high figure. The stock market was strong throughout most of the year, but in October, November and December the course of the market was reversed and a very noteworthy decline set in. As a matter of fact, in this downward movement the whole or the greater part of the rise previously established was lost. A review of the stock market for the year is given in the 13 THE CHRONICLE article in our “ Bank & Quotation” Section, which accompanies to-day’s issue of the “ Chronicle.” Below we bring together some general statistics for 1912 and 1911, affording an interesting contrast be­ tween the two years. The data for 1912 are neces­ sarily largely estimates, as the year has only just closed. The same table is incorporated in our annual “ Financial Review,” and there the 1912 figures will appear in their final corrected form. % GENERAL SUM M ARY FOR TW O YEARS. 1912. 1911.

The month also proved one of the very coldest on record. On Jan. 25 the M il. & St. P . reduced the s. a .d iv . on its com. stock from 3 } 4 to 2 J ^ % . The step had not been unexpected. Chairman Roswell Miller on Saturday, Jan. 27, gave out a statement saying the cut had been caused not alone by the failure of crops in the Dakotas and Minnesota, but by the depression in general business. It was reasonable to hope for better crops the ensuing season, but there seemed “ no prospect of improve­ ment in general conditions, and in addition there was the continued reduction of rates and the high cost of lab or.\" These remarks attracted wide attention, as it was recog­ nized that the influences mentioned were typical of the rail­ road situation throughout the U . S. On the Stock Ex­ change the’ effect was to cause renewed depression. M an y of the earnings returns of Western roads for the preceding De­ cember, which came in about the same time, served to in­ tensify gloomy feelings. The U n. Pac. for December re­ ported $172,190 falling off in gross and $630,419 in net; So. Pac. $269,987 in gross and $716,595 in net, and the Rock Island System $490,023 in gross and $346,762 in net. The 111. Cent., which apparently was still suffering from the shopmen’s strike, fell $411,794 behind in gross and $975,603 in net. On the N . Y . Cent, and the Pennsylvania drastic curtailment of expenditures served to bring improvement in net. In these last instances, however, demands for higher wages proved a new disturbing feature. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers addressed communications to the different railroads asking for large increases and for the equalization or standardization of the wage-scale on the different lines. A t the same time operators in the anthra­ cite coal regions were asked to grant higher wages to the miners. In the Middle Western States miners and operators in the bituminous coal fields were in conference discussing similar demasnd. There were other labor involvements. A t the textile mills at Lawrence, M ass., trouble was precipi­ tated by a new law in M ass, fixing 54 hours as the maximum timo for a week’s labor. It had been the custom in these woolen mills to work 56 hours, and now a reduction in wages to the extent of the two hours’ difference in time was made. The operatives went on strike and put in a counter demand for an increase in wages. The strikers, who were mostly foreigners, would not allow work of any kind to go on at the mills. Finally it became necessary to call out the State militia, and scenes of bloodshed and violence were enacted, with attendant loss of life. In the cotton dispute at Lan­ cashire (England) an adjustment was effected through the good offices of Sir George Askwith, the Chairman of the Board of Trade’s Conciliation Board. The Lancashire Cotton Spinners & Manufacturers Assn, had the previous month declared a lockout of 160,000 cotton weavers because of a strike inaugurated at the Helene mill at Accrington by the union weavers, owing to the refusal of two operatives (a man and his wife) to join the union. Unfortunately, a prospect loomed up of a labor conflict in Great Britain in,a 1 4t THE CHRONICLE different branch of industry. The coal miners of Wales and Scotland, by the overwhelming vote of 445,801 to 115,921, authorized their leaders to declare a strike on M ch . 1 for a fixed minimum wage. In our iron and steel industry a continuation of the activity which had marked the closing weeks of 1911 was noted. The monthly report of the U . S. Steel Corporation given out Jan. 10 showed that the un­ filled orders Dec. 31 1911 on the books of tho subsidiary cor­ porations aggregated 5,084,761 tons, an increase of 942,806 tons during December, following an increase of 447,627 tons in November. During January there was a further increase to 5,379,721 tons, as appeared from tho return issued the next month. These unfilled orders, however, represented mainly business taken at very low piices. In some direc­ tions prices improved during January. In wire and wire products the Pittsburgh Steel C o ., an independent concern, on Jan. 22 announced an advance of 81 a ton, which was soon followed by the Steel Corp. and the other producers; fence wire was moved up to 81 40 per 100 lbs. and wire nails to $1 60. Large orders remained to be filled at the old prices. The quarterly statement of the Steel Corp. showed that tho 1 % % div. on the com. stock had just about been earned, but without any special appropriation for improvements or new work. It appeared that in December and November profits had been, respectively, only 86,999,060 and 86,946,717, against 89,159,338 in October, making the total for the three months 823,105,115, against 825,990,978 in the Decembor quarter of 1910 and 840,971,309 in 1909. The copper trade continued to show improvement and accumulated stocks in the U . S ., already low on Jan. 1, at 89 ,4 5 4 ,6 9 5 lbs., were further reduced and were only 66,280,643 lbs. Jan. 31. In the dry goods trade tho tone improved, but print cloths at Fall River remained unchanged at 3 % cts. Tho cotton­ ginning report of tho Census Bureau showed that the D e­ partment of Agriculture’s estimated production, namely 14,885,000 bales of 500 lb s., would be exceeded, as the returns showed 15,015,357 bales already ginned on Jan. 15. Cotton, however, advanced, middling upland Jan. 31 being 9.70cts. in this market, against 9.35 cts. Jan. 2 and 9.25 cts. Dec. 31 1911. Grain prices sharply advanced, owing in part to the severity of the weather; M a y wheat in Chicago moved up frem 9 8 % cts. Jan. 16 to 81 0 3 % Jan. 29; M a y corn at the same point from 6 3 % cts. Jan. 3 to 0 8 % Jan. 31 and M ay eats from 4 7 % Jan. 2 to 5 2 % Jan. 31. G ovt, money hold­ ings in Sub-Treasuries were reduced from 8354,591,895 to 8342,043,032. G ovt, deposits in the banks decreased slightly— frem 847,768,004 to 847,439,241. National bank circulation secured by bonds increased from 8714,363,068 to 8715,493,996. Political agitation proved highly dis­ turbing. Ex-Pres. Roosevelt began to loom up as a Presi­ dential candidate and Senator La Follette in the prosecution of his own campaign delivered a speech at Carnegie Hall in which he declared, among other things, that he would carry the proposition for tho recall of judges so far as to make it apply even to the Judges of the U. S. Supreme Court. In Congress the investigation of the Steel Corporation "
