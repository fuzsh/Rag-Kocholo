        "text": "Discovery is the beauty of music. It reveals itself in layers. Such is the evolution of Celeigh Cardinal. With a confident voice and boundless energy, Cardinal owns a stage, connecting deeply with her audience through humour, passion and love. In 2020, Cardinal achieved one of Canada’s highest musical accolades, a JUNO Award for Indigenous Artist of the Year. She also received two Western Canadian Music Awards nominations, including Indigenous Artist of the Year and Songwriter of the Year. With two full-length albums completed and her third release in the works, Celeigh is quickly becoming one of the great Canadian voices that make up the fabric of this country’s roots music scene.\n\nCeleigh Cardinal will host the afternoon show for A Day to Listen 2022. She is a Cree Metis singer/songwriter originally from Grande Prairie, Alberta but currently based in amiskwaciwâskahikan, also known as Edmonton.\n\nIn reflecting on what National Day for Truth and Reconciliation means to her, she says:\n\n“My fathers family is Cree and they hail from northern Alberta. When they were children, my father and my aunts and uncles were separated and I was put into foster care. Just as my father wasn’t brought up with his culture, neither was I. I have felt between two worlds for most of my life…navigating carefully, mediating as a default, and never feeling a full expression or even knowledge of who I am. However, through this journey, I’ve found music to be a tool that I can use to express myself. I’ve also learned that walking between two worlds can sometimes be a blessing, because I hope to be a bridge that can bring parts of these two worlds together. I’ve found that storytelling through music has been very healing for me. ‘Song by the Supermoon’ is about growing while still being grounded by your roots, and where you come from.”\n\nThis song appears on Celeigh’s Juno award-winning album Stories from a Downtown Apartment. Celeigh also references some songs from friends during this broadcast:\n\nGR Gritt’s Ancestors\n\nDigging Roots’ Cut My Hair\n\nCeleigh touches on cultural appreciation, over appropriation using a friend’s art & business as an example:\n\n“A beautiful part of reconciliation is pretty simple – supporting Indigenous creatives and their stories, their businesses, and their art. l feel larger than life when I step on stage because of the outfit or the jewelry that I’m wearing. I could go on about Indigenous fashion for days – but I want you to recognize that your financial support of Indigenous creators can literally put food on their tables and help their families flourish. I want to share a little story about a high school friend of mine – Meghan Weeks. It’s been so inspiring to watch her create with traditional materials like deer hide and salmon skin, and she’s built a business out of this called MDW Jewelry. I love watching Indigenous people draw inspiration from the practices and traditions of their people. Like her website says: ‘My work reflects teachings from the matriarchs in my family, childhood memories, Cree humour and my continued healing journey to stop the cycle of intergenerational trauma.’”\n\n“I have a buffalo head ring made by her that I’ve worn in multiple music videos and photoshoots. Watch for it in the video below for When All is Said and Done.”\n\nCeleigh will also talk about her cover of The Tragically Hip’s Ahead by a Century:\n\n“The music video was a homemade creation of assorted videos sent to me by artists, families, and even an entire grade 3 class. I included videos from both Indigenous, and non-Indigenous people, straight and queer, people from all different walks of life. It was a giant celebration of community and joy. When I put the call out to people on social media to be a part of that project, it was a reminder to me that when you look to your community, they will in fact show up! I thought it was fitting to share my cover of this song, because it’s a parallel really for the work the Gord Downie and Chanie Wenjack Fund is doing, including everyone in the process of reconciliation. Before Gord Downie passed, he enlisted the help of his audience to amplify the reconciliation in this country and as an Indigenous person, I was quite moved. This is what I had in mind when I chose to record it.”\n\nWilliam Prince approaches the big questions with humility and curiosity. Prince’s influences and references span the pantheon of classic outlaw country singers, baseball, and the great beyond, all of which shape his approach to songcraft and offer a masterclass in skilful simplicity.\n\nPrince’s JUNO Award winning debut Earthly Days introduced the songwriter’s poignant philosophy and rich baritone to the world. His breakout song “Breathless,” found audiences worldwide. Prince followed up with Reliever, released February 2020. For this album, Prince began with a single word, Reliever, which informed a collection of that explored how peace is found. Prince surprised fans with a second new album in 2020. Gospel First Nation, released in October, is a “21st Century Northern Interlake Country Gospel” collection that tells stories of family and faith in the age of grief. The album explores Prince’s own family tree, the places and music that shaped his childhood, and explores the extremely complicated relationship of faith and colonialism with grace and empathy.\n\nPrince’s new album, Stand in the Joy, produced by Grammy Award winning producer, Dave Cobb, is slated for release in the spring of 2023. Prince’s momentum has continued to build, with each new album adding depth and dimension to an exceptional body of work that has received international acclaim. From national network television appearances, top tier media coverage including NPR Tiny Desk, LA Times and Rolling Stone, and high-profile performances at major international festivals, William Prince has become one of today’s most respected and celebrated songwriters.\n\nWilliam Prince will host the morning show for A Day to Listen 2022, broadcasting from 6am – 6pm at your local radio station. During his broadcast, you’ll hear him touch on some of his music, and the music of others. He mentions his partnership with the Gord Downie and Chanie Wenjack fund and reflects on the opportunity to be part of Secret Path Live with friends and musicians like Buffy Sainte-Marie, Serena Ryder, July Talk and more. You can revisit the project live at the link below where he sang Gord Downie’s song ‘Son.’\n\nYou’ll hear William speak about his song 7 during this broadcast, too. He says, “If you hear no other song from me today, go listen to this one.”\n\nIt’s inspired by his upbringing on Peguis First Nation, where he graduated from Peguis Central School. Years after graduating, his high school asked him to write a graduate anthem and he turned to the Seven Sacred Grandfather Teachings for some inspiration: Love, Wisdom, Respect, Truth, Humility, Honesty, Courage.\n\nDuring the broadcast, you’ll hear William touch on cultural appreciation through the inspiring story of his cousin Destiny Seymour, and her business, Indigo Arrows. She is an Anishinaabe interior designer based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. She graduated with her master’s degree in Interior Design from the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Manitoba. She worked at a local architecture firm in Winnipeg for over 10 years as their interior designer before starting her own design business in 2016. On her website, https://indigoarrows.ca/, she shares:\n\n“For thousands of years, Indigenous peoples in Manitoba, including my Anishinaabe ancestors, created beautiful patterns to adorn their pottery collections and host of bone tools. Most of the surviving pieces are held by museums now, but I think the world needs more than exhibition- we need these patterns in our homes provoking thought; we need them bridging gaps; and, we need them inspiring our loved ones. The Indigo Arrows line picks up where my ancestors left off.”\n\nWilliam will also speak about his friend, Indigenous comic Paul Rabliauskas, who he says is a true ambassador for taking your small community story to the world stage.\n\nCatch Paul in his new sitcom Acting Good where he stars as himself: a witty but sensitive comic who returns home to the fictional Grouse Lake First Nation after a botched attempt to move to the big city – it’s inspired by his community of Poplar River First Nation.\n\nWilliam also touches on a community member he’s a huge fan of: Winnipeg’s Christa Bruneau-Guenther. Born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and a proud member of Peguis First Nation, Christa has spent nearly 20 years refining her cooking skills and expanding her knowledge of Indigenous foods. She is a home cook turned restaurant owner whose passion and creativity are woven into the fabric of Feast Café.\n\nChrista started Feast with a focus on community and a goal of becoming a pillar in the West End. She wants each visitor to experience modern dishes rooted in traditional First Nation foods while celebrating the spirit of her culture. In the four years since opening, Christa’s recipes have been featured in publications such as Canadian Living, Chatelaine, and on Food Network Canada.\n\nWilliam highly recommends stopping-in if you’re ever in Winnipeg!"
