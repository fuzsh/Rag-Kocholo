The CBSC decision examined broadcasts on 96.9 FM (CKOI-FM) Montreal from Jan. and Mar. 2017, concluding the station did not violate the Canadian Association of Broadcasters’ (CAB) Code of Ethics when it broadcast an excerpt in English of a speech by Madonna at the Women’s March on Washington in which she used the f-word. On Mar. 25, the station also broadcast an English clip from a Green Day concert in which the band’s lead singer, Billie Joe Armstrong, used the f-word. Both broadcasts occurred during the afternoon, and a listener complained about the coarse language. The CBSC French-Language Panel determined “using the word ‘fuck’ in French does not have the same vulgar connotation as it does in English.”\n\nThe Mill St. Mixtape with Human Kebab premiered Nov. 4 on Toronto’s 102.1 The Edge (CFNY-FM).

The Benztown 50 list will be based on several criteria, including number of radio station affiliates, station size and market.

The letter suggests Ottawa review its position. Leitão states “The status quo is no longer possible.

B.C.-based Equustek Solutions Inc. brought about the original action in 2011 and won an injunction, later upheld by the B.C. Court of Appeal, forcing Google to remove search results related to networking tech company Datalink Technologies Gateways Inc., which Equustek accused of infringing on its intellectual property.\n\nGENERAL:\n\nOAB‘s 2017 Connection Conference and Gala Awards are getting underway this morning, Thursday Nov. 9, in Toronto.
