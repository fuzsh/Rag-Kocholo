        "text": "The Lloydminster Bobcats are thrilled to announce the hiring of Klarke Braaten as Team Broadcaster/Marketing Representative.\n\nBraaten, a native of Abbey, SK, joins the organization after spending over two years with Golden West Broadcasting in Swift Current, SK, holding the position of Sports Reporter on Magic 97.1FM, The Eagle 94.1FM, CKSW 570AM, CJSN 1490AM, and Swift Current Online. While in Swift Current, Braaten called play-by-play for the Swift Current Female Midget AAA Wildcats hockey team, Swift Current Comprehensive High School Colts football team, Shaunavon High School Shadows football team, and also served as colour commentator for the Swift Current Broncos of the Western Hockey League.\n\n“We are excited about having Klarke join our organization, as we think he’ll do an outstanding job with broadcasting the games, covering the team, and helping our organization in a marketing role as well,” said Head Coach and General Manager Travis Clayton. “He has already demonstrated a great understanding of our organization, and his enthusiasm toward the position will help continue to grow the Bobcats brand in the right direction.”\n\nBeginning this fall, Bobcats fans will become familiar with Braaten as the play-by-play voice of the Lloydminster Bobcats on Real Country 95.9FM and on HockeyTV, bringing all 60 games to you anywhere in the world. In addition to handling broadcasting duties, Braaten will take on a sales and marketing role with the team as well.\n\n“I’m looking forward to the opportunity to work with the Lloydminster Bobcats and provide Bobcats fans everywhere with the coverage that they desire,” said Braaten. “Getting the chance to move up here and familiarize myself with the team, fans, and community in the coming weeks is something I am very eager to do.”"
