Hello,

Just to know in which computer language Logic is programmed !

Any tech info are welcomed !

Thanks,

Olivier

Why? It makes no difference from your perspective--it would be unwise to evaluate the relative performance of DAWs by their language.

If you want to develop AUs, you can do it in any compatible language. Apple has examples in Objective C.

Given the fact that these days it's all Cocoa frameworks, then much of Logic will be written in Objective-C. Logic from the beginning has been in C with an object oriented approach, so the more core stuff will all be C or C++ variants, probably with some optimised assembler for some deep core bits (although I'm not sure whether that is necessary these days.)

Why do you want to know?

Why do you want to know?

Because, I am very curious ...

Because I am impressed by this program ...

Because, I am also in programming and object oriented technology ...

Because I am new to the Mac stuff ...
