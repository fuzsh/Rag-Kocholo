        "text": "Static analysis helps development teams that are under pressure. Quality releases needed to be delivered on time. Coding and compliance standards need to be met. And mistakes are not an option.\n\nThat‚Äôs why development teams are using the best static code analysis tools / source code analysis tools for the job. Here, we discuss static analysis and the benefits of using static code analyzers, as well as the limitations of static analysis.\n\nRead along or jump to the section that interests you the most:\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Find the best static Code analysis tool\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat Is Static Analysis?\n\nStatic analysis is best described as a method of debugging that is done by automatically examining the source code without having to execute the program. This provides developers with an understanding of their code base and helps ensure that it is compliant, safe, and secure.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat Is Static Source Code Analysis?\n\nStatic source code analysis refers to the operation performed by a source code analysis tool, which is the analysis of a set of code against a set (or multiple sets) of coding rules.\n\nStatic code analysis and static analysis are often used interchangeably, along with source code analysis.\n\nStatic code analysis addresses weaknesses in source code that might lead to vulnerabilities. Of course, this may also be achieved through manual source code reviews. But using automated tools is much more effective.\n\nStatic analysis is commonly used to comply with coding guidelines ‚Äî such as MISRA. And it‚Äôs often used for complying with industry standards ‚Äî such as ISO 26262.\n\nüìï Related Resource: How Static Code Analysis works to help ensure high quality, secure, and reliable code.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhen Is Static Analysis Performed with a Static Analyzer / Source Code Analyzer?\n\nStatic code analysis is performed early in development, before software testing begins. For organizations practicing DevOps, static code analysis takes place during the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù phase.\n\nStatic code analysis also supports DevOps by creating an automated feedback loop. Developers will know early on if there are any problems in their code. And it will be easier to fix those problems.\n\nBack to top\n\nStatic Analysis vs Dynamic Analysis\n\nSo, what‚Äôs the difference between static analysis and dynamic analysis?\n\nBoth types of code analysis detect defects. The big difference is where they find defects in the development lifecycle.\n\nStatic Analysis vs Dynamic Analysis\n\nStatic analysis identifies defects before you run a program (e.g., between coding and unit testing).\n\nDynamic code analysis identifies defects after you run a program (e.g., during unit testing). However, some coding errors might not surface during unit testing. So, there are defects that dynamic testing might miss that static code analysis can find.\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat Are the Limitations of Static Analysis Tools and Static Source Code Analysis Tools?\n\nStatic code analysis is used for a specific purpose in a specific phase of development. But there are some limitations of a static code analysis tool.\n\nNo Understanding of Developer Intent\n\nint calculateArea(int length, int width) { return (length + width); }\n\nA static analysis tool may detect a possible overflow in this calculation. But it can‚Äôt determine that function fundamentally does not do what is expected!\n\nRules That Aren‚Äôt Statically Enforceable\n\nSome coding rules depend on external documentation. Or they are open to subjective interpretation.\n\nFor example:\n\nCERT-C MSC04:\n\nUse comments consistently and in a readable fashion.\n\nPossible Defects Lead to False Positives and False Negatives\n\nIn some situations, a tool can only report that there is a possible defect.\n\nint divide(void) { int x; if(foo()) { x = 0; } else { x = 5; } return (10/x); }\n\nIf we know nothing about foo(), we do not know what value x will have.\n\nThe result is undecidable. That means that tools may report defects that do not actually exist (false positives). Or they may fail to report real defects (false negatives).\n\nBack to top\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Using the Best Source Code Analyzers / Source Code Analysis Tools?\n\nThere are several benefits of static analysis tools ‚Äî especially if you need to comply with an industry standard.\n\nThe best static code analysis tools offer speed, depth, and accuracy.\n\nSpeed\n\nIt takes time for developers to do manual code reviews. Automated tools are much faster.\n\nStatic code checking addresses problems early on. And it pinpoints exactly where the error is in the code. So, you‚Äôll be able to fix those errors faster. Plus, coding errors found earlier are less costly to fix.\n\nDepth\n\nTesting can‚Äôt cover every possible code execution path. But a static code analyzer can.\n\nA static code analyzer checks the code as you work on your build. You‚Äôll get an in-depth analysis of where there might be potential problems in your code, based on the rules you‚Äôve applied.\n\nHere's an example of in-depth code analysis in Helix QAC.\n\nAccuracy\n\nManual source code reviews are prone to human error. Automated tools are not.\n\nThey scan every line of code to identify potential problems. This helps you ensure the highest-quality code is in place ‚Äî before testing begins. After all, when you‚Äôre complying with acoding standard, quality is critical.\n\nüìï Related Resource: Discover how to improve the soundness of static analysis with the right tools and processes.\n\nBack to top\n\nHow Can Static Analysis Tools / Source Code Analysis Tools Help Developers Shift Left?\n\nStatic analysis is an essential technique for ensuring reliability, security, and maintainability of software applications. It helps developers identify and fix issues early, improve code quality, enhance security, ensure compliance, and increase efficiency. Using static analysis tools, developers can build better quality software, reduce the risk of security breaches, and minimize the time and effort spend debugging and fixing issues.\n\nThe term \"shifting left\" refers to the practice of integrating automated software testing and analysis tools earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Traditionally, testing and analysis were often performed after the code was written, resulting in a reactive approach to addressing issues. By shifting left, developers can catch issues before they become problems, thereby reducing the amount of time and effort required for debugging and maintenance. This is especially important in agile development, where frequent code changes and updates can result in many issues that need to be addressed.\n\nA key benefit of static analysis is that it can save you time and effort debugging and testing. By identifying potential issues early in the development process, you can address any issues before they become more difficult (and expensive) to fix. You'll also get higher quality applications that are more reliable and easier to maintain over time, plus prevent issues from propagating throughout the codebase and becoming harder to identify and fix later.\n\nBenefits of shifting left with static analysis include:\n\nEarly detection of issues. By integrating static analysis into the development process, developers can catch issues early on, allowing them to be addressed before they become bigger problems. This reduces the time and effort required for debugging and maintenance and helps ensure that code is reliable and secure.\n\nReduced cost. Addressing issues earlier in the SDLC can reduce the cost of fixing bugs and other issues later in the process. This can save time and resources and reduce the risk of delays or other issues that can impact the project timeline.\n\nImprove code quality. Static analysis helps identify coding standards violations and other issues that can impact code quality. By addressing these issues early on, developers can ensure that code is well-written, maintainable, and easier to debug.\n\nEnhanced security. Static analysis tools can identify security vulnerabilities in code, allowing developers to address these issues before the code is released into production. This can reduce the risk of security breaches and other issues that can impact the security of the application.\n\nHow Shifting Left with the Best Static Analysis Tools Helps Improve Your Bottom Line\n\nShifting left through static analysis may also increase the estimated return on investment (ROI) and cost savings for your organization.\n\nOne of the main advantages of static analysis is its ability to find defects and vulnerabilities early in the SDLC. Early detection can save your company time and money in the long run. According to a study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the cost of fixing a defect increases significantly as it progresses through the development cycle. A defect detected during the requirements phase may cost around $60 USD to fix, whereas a defect detected in production can cost up to $10,000! By adopting static analysis, organizations can reduce the number of defects that make it to the production stage and significantly reduce the overall cost of fixing defects.\n\nIn addition to reducing the cost of fixing defects, static analysis can also improve code quality, which can lead to further cost savings. Improved code quality can reduce the time and effort required for testing, debugging, and maintenance. A study by IBM found that the cost of fixing defects can be reduced by up to 75% by improving code quality.\n\nSecurity is another area where static analysis can help with costs, especially those associated with security breaches and negative branding status. An IBM study found that the cost of a data breach can range from $1.25 million to $8.19 million. Static analysis can detect security vulnerabilities early in the SDLC, allowing organizations to fix them before the software is deployed. By doing so, organizations can significantly reduce the risk and cost of a security breach and protect their reputations.\n\nIn addition to cost savings, static analysis can also bring productivity gains. By finding defects early in the development cycle, developers can reduce the time and effort required for debugging and fixing defects later on. This can free up time for other development activities like feature development or testing. By improving productivity, organizations can reduce the time and cost of software development and increase their capacity to deliver software more quickly.\n\nAdopting a shift-left approach in software development can bring significant cost savings and ROI to organizations. By detecting defects and vulnerabilities early, companies can significantly reduce the cost of fixing defects, improve code quality and security, and increase productivity. These benefits can lead to increased customer satisfaction, improved software quality, and reduced development costs.\n\nüìï Learn about using tools to find code vulnerabilities, ensure standards compliance, and reduce time-to-market early in the development process with Perforce's Shift Left 101 >>\n\nBack to top\n\nHow to Choose a Static Analysis Tool?\n\nHere are a few things to consider when deciding which tool is right for you.\n\nProgramming Language\n\nAnalyzers are designed for many different programming languages.
