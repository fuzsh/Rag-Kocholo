        "text": "Accept your badge from Credly\n\nPathway badges are issued through Unity's professional badging partner, Credly. This is the same platform that hosts Unity's Certification badges. When you complete a Pathway, Credly will issue the Pathway badge to the email address associated with your Unity ID, and will send you an email inviting you to create an Credly account (if you don't already have one) to claim your badge. You will also be able to see the Pathways badge in your badge list on the “My Learning” dashboard, but claiming your badge through Credly will enable you to add it to the “Licenses and Certifications” section of a LinkedIn profile, and to other professional networks.\n\nIf you completed the Pathway but did not receive the email from Credly, please check your spam folder in case it was accidentally marked as spam. If you accidentally deleted the email, a follow-up will be sent automatically in a few days. If you still cannot find the email, please check your Unity ID account settings to ensure that your email address is up-to-date. If the email was not correct at the time you completed the Pathway, please contact customer support."
