        "text": "Overview\n\nSoftware\n\nDescription\n\nWebsites\n\nReadings\n\nCourses\n\nOverview\n\nThe difference-in-difference (DID) technique originated in the field of econometrics, but the logic underlying the technique has been used as early as the 1850’s by John Snow and is called the ‘controlled before-and-after study’ in some social sciences.\n\nDescription\n\nDID is a quasi-experimental design that makes use of longitudinal data from treatment and control groups to obtain an appropriate counterfactual to estimate a causal effect. DID is typically used to estimate the effect of a specific intervention or treatment (such as a passage of law, enactment of policy, or large-scale program implementation) by comparing the changes in outcomes over time between a population that is enrolled in a program (the intervention group) and a population that is not (the control group).\n\nFigure 1. Difference-in-Difference estimation, graphical explanation\n\nDID is used in observational settings where exchangeability cannot be assumed between the treatment and control groups. DID relies on a less strict exchangeability assumption, i.e., in absence of treatment, the unobserved differences between treatment and control groups arethe same overtime. Hence, Difference-in-difference is a useful technique to use when randomization on the individual level is not possible. DID requires data from pre-/post-intervention, such as cohort or panel data (individual level data over time) or repeated cross-sectional data (individual or group level). The approach removes biases in post-intervention period comparisons between the treatment and control group that could be the result from permanent differences between those groups, as well as biases from comparisons over time in the treatment group that could be the result of trends due to other causes of the outcome.\n\nCausal Effects (Ya=1 – Ya=0)\n\nDID usually is used to estimate the treatment effect on the treated (causal effect in the exposed), although with stronger assumptions the technique can be used to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) or the causal effect in the population. Please refer to Lechner 2011 article for more details.\n\nAssumptions\n\nIn order to estimate any causal effect, three assumptions must hold: exchangeability, positivity, and Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)1\n\n. DID estimation also requires that:\n\nIntervention unrelated to outcome at baseline (allocation of intervention was not determined by outcome)\n\nTreatment/intervention and control groups have Parallel Trends in outcome (see below for details)\n\nComposition of intervention and comparison groups is stable for repeated cross-sectional design (part of SUTVA)\n\nNo spillover effects (part of SUTVA)\n\nParallel Trend Assumption\n\nThe parallel trend assumption is the most critical of the above the four assumptions to ensure internal validity of DID models and is the hardest to fulfill. It requires that in the absence of treatment, the difference between the ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ group is constant over time. Although there is no statistical test for this assumption, visual inspection is useful when you have observations over many time points. It has also been proposed that the smaller the time period tested, the more likely the assumption is to hold. Violation of parallel trend assumption will lead to biased estimation of the causal effect.\n\nRegression Model\n\nDID is usually implemented as an interaction term between time and treatment group dummy variables in a regression model.\n\nY= β0 + β1*[Time] + β2*[Intervention] + β3*[Time*Intervention] + β4*[Covariates]+ε\n\nStrengths and Limitations\n\nStrengths\n\nIntuitive interpretation\n\nCan obtain causal effect using observational data if assumptions are met\n\nCan use either individual and group level data\n\nComparison groups can start at different levels of the outcome. (DID focuses on changerather than absolute levels)\n\nAccounts for change/change due to factors other than intervention\n\nLimitations\n\nRequires baseline data & a non-intervention group\n\nCannnot use if intervention allocation determined by baseline outcome\n\nCannot use if comparison groups have different outcome trend (Abadie 2005 has proposed solution)\n\nCannot use if composition of groups pre/post change are not stable\n\nBest Practices\n\nBe sure outcome trend did not influence allocation of the treatment/intervention\n\nAcquire more data points before and after to test parallel trend assumption\n\nUse linear probability model to help with interpretability\n\nBe sure to examine composition of population in treatment/intervention and control groups before and after intervention\n\nUse robust standard errors to account for autocorrelation between pre/post in same individual\n\nPerform sub-analysis to see if intervention had similar/different effect on components of the outcome\n\nEpi6 in-class presentation April 30, 2013\n\n1.
