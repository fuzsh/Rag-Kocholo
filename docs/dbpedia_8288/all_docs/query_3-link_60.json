        "text": "In this article, we explore the best programming languages for game development in 2024.\n\nOne thing’s for sure: the games industry is certainly booming, with revenue expectations of more than $365bn in 2024!\n\nAs an industry, gaming has evolved from simple (but hugely fun!) arcade games to sophisticated and immersive experiences that captivate millions of players worldwide.\n\nBut how are these games created? Simple, skilled developers using programming languages for game development!\n\nPerhaps you’ve always wanted to take the leap from gamer to game dev? I mean, why not? If you love games, why not create them?\n\nPlus, when you consider that the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics reports an average salary in excess of $130K for software developers, now’s the time to learn the best programming languages for game development.\n\nSo, if you’re ready, let’s dive in!\n\nBest Programming Languages for Game Development\n\n1. C++\n\nFor many of us, myself included, C++ is one of the best programming languages for games due to its high performance and versatility.\n\nTake a look at any C++ course, and you’ll see that it’s ideal for any application that needs to be performant.\n\nAnd while you might start out using C++ for less exciting tasks, it’s really quite impressive for game development.\n\nAs a statically typed and compiled language, it’s really efficient in execution speed and memory, which is ideal for developing games.\n\nC++ also offers control over graphic processing and hardware, which is essential for creating complex and high-performance games.\n\nPlus, being an object-oriented programming language, it enables you to organize your code into reusable, modular components that can be easily managed and maintained.\n\nThe gaming industry has a long history of using C++ for a reason, which also means that there’s a wealth of resources and tools like libraries and frameworks for C++ game development.\n\nKey Game Development Features:\n\n2. C#\n\nC# is another popular language for game development, thanks in part to its close links with Unity.\n\nAnd while many of us might have started out with C# for less exciting projects (I still remember my CMS with ASP.NET!), it’s ideal for game development.\n\nAs a modern, object-oriented programming language, it was developed by Microsoft and mostly used with the .NET framework.\n\nThe benefit here is that you can access a large set of libraries and tools for developing various applications, including games.\n\nKnown for simplicity, readability, and ease of use, C# is one of the best gaming programming languages.\n\nThis means it lets you focus on creating high-quality games without getting bogged down by complex technical details.\n\nThe language itself is statically-typed, meaning it provides strong type safety and reduces the likelihood of run-time errors.\n\nThis is ideal for game development compared to dynamically-typed languages.\n\nC# is also an efficient language that supports multithreading and parallel programming, which is crucial for game development, as it lets your code efficiently use hardware resources.\n\nKey Game Development Features:\n\n3. JavaScript\n\nIf you’ve taken a JavaScript course, chances are that you were thinking about learning web development!\n\nAnd while it may not be your first thought when looking for the best game coding language, it’s become popular for various applications, including games, thanks to its versatility.\n\nAs a high-level, interpreted programming, it’s also dynamically typed, which means data types are determined at run-time and not at compile-time.\n\nI like this, as it makes it easier to write code quickly, but you do need to watch out for typing errors when developing games.\n\nOverall, JavaScript is an expressive language that’s great for writing code intuitively that other developers can always read and understand.\n\nA strong feature of JavaScript is the fact that it’s non-blocking, which means it’s well-suited for writing asynchronous code.\n\nI’m sure you can imagine how important this is for responsive games that handle lots of requests.\n\nThe TL-DR is that this provides a fast user experience.\n\nGames made with JavaScript can also run on any browser, making them easier to distribute.\n\nI always like this about JS: I can write it once, and it can run anywhere!\n\nKey Game Development Features:\n\n4. Swift\n\nSwift is a high-performance programming language from Apple for that’s ideal for developing software for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.\n\nAnd by software, of course, we mean apps and gaming apps!\n\nAs a modern programming language, Swift offers many features that make it well-suited for developing games.\n\nOne of the key benefits is its speed and performance. Swift code is compiled into machine code, allowing it to run efficiently and making it a good choice for demanding tasks like gaming.\n\nTake any Swift course for iOS development, and you’ll learn this early on.\n\nI also like the fact that Swift has a strong type system and automatic reference counting (ARC), because this ensures my code is safe, secure, and easy to maintain\n\nTrust me, this is ideal when developing large and complex games.\n\nIt also offers libraries like SpriteKit and SceneKit to let you easily add high-quality 2D and 3D graphics to your games.\n\nKey Game Development Features:\n\n5. Java\n\nJava is definitely one of the most well-known programming languages, but did you know that it’s also good for game development?\n\nSure, I agree, it may not be an obvious competitor for C++ or C# when handing out the title of best coding language for games, but hear me out!\n\nJava has built-in portability: remember, Java code can run on any device with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. The definition of code once, run anywhere!\n\nTake any Java course, and this is one of the main features you’ll be taught about.\n\nBut for you and me, this makes it ideal for game development on multiple platforms.\n\nAlso, as an OOP language, Java is great for developing large-scale applications, including games.\n\nJava also offers socket programming, which is essential for two-way communication with servers, which means you can conveniently build multiplayer games.\n\nThe JavaFX library also offers a comprehensive set of tools for working with graphics and animations.\n\nPlus, as you’d expect, Java has a large and active community of developers, making it easy to find resources and help.\n\nKey Game Development Features:\n\n6. Lua\n\nNow, Lua may not have the same massive reputation as some of the big hitters on our list, but trust me, it’s a fast and flexible gaming coding language.\n\nThis makes it ideal for scripting game logic or creating mods and extensions.\n\nIn fact, if you’ve heard of Roblox, you should know that Lua was used to create this massively popular game!\n\nFor me, this is a massive accomplishment! It’s also used within the game to let users create their own games and to allow player customization.\n\nOne of the major benefits of Lua is the ability to quickly and easily modify game behavior without recompiling game code.\n\nIt’s also useful for creating game modification interfaces that let users alter the behavior of a game.\n\nKey Game Development Features:\n\n7. Python\n\nWe’ve made it to the final entry on our list, and would you believe it, but Python is also useful for game development!\n\nNow, quick disclaimer, Python is not supposed to be used to create the next MMORPG like Fortnite!\n\nBut, it does have something to offer, so don’t be so fast to dismiss it!\n\nYes, take any Python course, and you’ll be told about how great it is for data tasks, but trust me, it’s also adept at game development!\n\nAs a high-level, interpreted programming language, it’s actually one of the best choices for games when you need to knock up a rapid prototype.\n\nPlus, with its inherent flexibility, it’s ideal for game developers that want to quickly iterate and refine their game design.\n\nOverall, Python is renowned for simple and straightforward syntax that’s easy to learn, even for newbies to programming.\n\nPython also offers a large standard library with support for basic graphics, networking, and sound. This makes it easy for developers to get started with game development.\n\nIt’s also nice to know that game engines often use Python to provide scripting interfaces.\n\nThese allow developers to create game logic and mechanics without writing code in a more complex programming language.\n\nKey Game Development Features:\n\nWhat Is the Best Language for Game Development?\n\nGot this far, but still not sure what is the best programming language for games?\n\nI get it! They all sound like they’re good for the job, but to help you out, I’ve tried to organize the different languages by use case.\n\nTake a look at the list below to quickly choose the best gaming programming language for your project.\n\nBest Programming Languages for Simple Games: Python, Lua, JavaScript, C#\n\nBest Programming Languages for Beginners: Python, Lua, JavaScript, Java, C#\n\nBest Programming Languages for 3D Games: C++, C#\n\nBest Programming Languages for AR/VR Games: C++, C#, JavaScript, Swift\n\nBest Programming Languages for PC Games: C++, C#, Java, Python\n\nBest Programming Languages for Console Games: C++, C#\n\nBest Programming Languages for AAA games: C++, C#\n\nBest Programming Languages for Android Games: Java, C++, C#\n\nBest Programming Languages for iOS Games: Swift, C++, C#\n\nBest Programming Languages for Web Games: JavaScript, Python\n\nWhat Is Game Development?\n\nVideo game development is the process of transforming game ideas into actual games for users to play. If you want to make games, you want people to play them!\n\nFrom experience, it’s a great feeling to create any piece of software and see others use it and enjoy it!\n\nThe process itself includes refining concepts, designing interfaces, planning architecture, and creating the game by writing the code that makes it function.\n\nThat said, let’s look at the typical stages of game development:\n\nConceptualization: The concept, video game design, and storyline are conceived via brainstorming. We found Will Wright’s game design Masterclass excels in this area.\n\nPre-Production: Defining a project plan with a timeline & resource allocation. This covers factors like target audience, gameplay mechanics, and art style.\n\nProduction: Game developers use tools and technologies like game engines, programming languages, and graphic design software to bring the game to life.\n\nTesting: Once the game is built, it goes through testing to identify and fix any bugs or glitches. Fun times!\n\nRelease: After testing, the game is released to platforms like PC, Xbox, PS5, mobile devices, etc.\n\nMaintenance: Game developers provide ongoing support and maintenance, fixing any issues that arise while also adding updates or new content.\n\nGaming Platforms\n\nGaming platforms are the systems where game programmers deploy their games and where users play the games.\n\nWe might not think of them as platforms because they’re so familiar to us as gamers, but common examples are:\n\nConsoles: Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Switch, etc. These have dedicated hardware designed for gaming and often include wireless controllers.\n\nPC: A computer system that runs Windows and occasionally MacOS or Linux. Users have more control over hardware, including GPUs, monitors, mouse and keyboard, etc.\n\nMobiles: Platforms like iOS and Android offer games that are optimized for touchscreen devices like tablets and smartphones.\n\nWeb-based platforms: Play directly in a web browser without additional software installation. Common web-based gaming platforms include Armor Games, Miniclip, and CrazyGames.\n\nAugmented Reality (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR): These use special hardware designed to create an immersive gaming experience, usually via special headsets and hand-tracking controllers. Check out the Meta Quest 2 for an example of an all-in-one VR headset.\n\nGame Engines\n\nGame engines are development environments or game frameworks that make game development more convenient.\n\nBut why use a game engine?\n\nWell, if you’re taking any form of game design course, you’ll quickly learn that there is A LOT that goes into creating a game!\n\nEnter the game engine, as this offers a suite of tools and reusable components that speed up the processes of building a game. Sounds good to me!\n\nThe general idea is to use pre-built functionalities rather than coding from scratch, which frees up your and my time to focus more on creating unique features for the game.\n\nThey also tend to include a renderer for creating graphics, a physics simulation engine, a scripting language, and other features.\n\nIf you’ve spent any time learning about game engines, you’ll probably know about the battle between Unity and Unreal Engine for the most popular game engine, but there are more on offer as well.\n\nIf you want the TL-DR, some of the most common functionalities offered by game engines include:\n\nRendering 2D/3D graphics\n\nAnimations\n\nScripting\n\nMemory management\n\nNetworking\n\nStreaming\n\nCollision detection\n\nI’ve summarized some of the most popular and some of the smaller game engines below, including key features, supported languages, and popular games created with them.\n\nWhat Makes a Language Good for Game Development?\n\nProgramming languages differ in features and core functionalities, with some having areas they are well suited for.\n\nFor example, if I’m working on a data science project, I might think about R, while I might look to Python for AI projects.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the qualities that make a good language for video game development.\n\nPerformance: Game development often involves complex simulations and real-time rendering, which require high performance.\n\nMemory management: Games typically require lots of memory, which needs to be managed efficiently for strong performance.\n\nInteroperability: Game developers often need to integrate various libraries and tools, which extends to interoperability with other languages.\n\nPortability: Games are often developed for multiple platforms, so it helps if a language can easily cross-compile.\n\nEase of use: This makes game development accessible to a wider range of developers.\n\nCommunity and support: Provides developers with access to resources, libraries, and tools that make development faster and more efficient while helping with debugging or optimization.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nSo there you go, the 7 best programming languages for game development in 2024, including favorites like C++ and C#, alongside newcomers like Lua and surprise entrants like Python.\n\nMaybe you’re brand new to game development, and you’re not sure where to start.\n\nAfter all, choosing the best language for game programming must be crucial to the success of your project, right?\n\nWell, don’t worry!\n\nTo help you choose the best programming language for game development, we’ve broken each down by pros and cons, game engine compatibility, and platform support.\n\nWhatever your career goals and objectives, there should be enough information to help you navigate the world of game development.\n\nHappy gaming, and be sure to let us know in the comments which language you choose and tell us about any games you’ve built!\n\nHave you decided to become a game developer, and are you itching to start?
