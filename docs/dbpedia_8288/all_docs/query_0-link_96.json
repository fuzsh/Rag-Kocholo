        "text": "Last update on January 30 2024 12:54:32 (UTC/GMT +8 hours)\n\nWhat is C Programming Language?\n\nC is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs. It has since become one of the most widely used programming languages of all time, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems.\n\nThe best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. We have started this section for those (beginner to intermediate) who are familiar with C programming.\n\nHope, these exercises help you to improve your C programming coding skills. Currently, following sections are available, we are working hard to add more exercises. Please refer to this page for important C snippets, code, and examples before starting the exercises. Happy Coding!\n\n[ Want to contribute to C exercises? Send your code (attached with a .zip file) to us at w3resource[at]yahoo[dot]com. Please avoid copyrighted materials.]\n\nDo not submit any solution of the above exercises at here, if you want to contribute go to the appropriate exercise page.\n\nList of Exercises with Solutions :"
