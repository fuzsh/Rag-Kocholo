Model-driven development lets you visualize how the application works as it’s being built with the ability to launch with one-click deployment.\n\nWhat is model-driven development?\n\nBusiness\n\ndevelopers\n\nRather than wait for IT, non-technical business users can use low-code’s simplified development environment to build their own applications.\n\nGovernance cuts down on shadow IT and empowers anyone to build basic applications while IT still maintains visibility and control of the organization’s application landscape.\n\nCitizen developers\n\nCollaborative IDE\n\nTo empower your entire workforce to co-create solutions, make sure the platform you use has a collaborative IDE.\n\nThe platform should have built-in tools to facilitate real-time collaboration between business and IT throughout the application lifecycle.\n\nData integration\n\nOrganizations have vast amounts of data across various teams. The platform should have the ability to integrate with any system and data source.\n\nYour low-code platform should make it easy for developers to find, understand, and use data from any internal or external source — without compromising data security.\n\nApplication lifecycle management\n\nYour low-code platform should have an integrated set of tools and services for continuous support throughout the application development lifecycle — from ideation and requirements gathering to deployment and performance management.\n\nThis support eliminates the traditional bottlenecks, costs, and risks associated with app delivery while increasing quality and providing a better development experience for all stakeholders involved.\n\nProductivity\n\nTo support developers of all skill sets, the platform should offer drag-and-drop widgets, reusable components, and real-time collaboration tools to enhance citizen development productivity.\n\nThe platform should also offer flexible integration and extensibility, as well as out-of-the-box DevOps tools to help professional developers build complex applications and systems faster.\n\nUse cases\n\nWhat type of applications do you need to deliver? If you’re looking to build simple productivity applications and web forms, no-code features will get the job done. But if your goal is to deliver mission-critical applications, modernize core systems, and offer sophisticated user experiences, invest in an enterprise-grade low-code platform.\n\nSee what you can build\n\nThe vendor’s vision\n\nWhat is the low-code vendor’s strategic vision for the platform? Work with a vendor that has a strong customer-centric focus on the future of the platform, with an ecosystem of delivery partners, developer communities, marketplaces, and training resources.\n\nLearn how to avoid vendor lock-in"
