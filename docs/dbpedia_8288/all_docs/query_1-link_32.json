        "text": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have introduced smart tools revolutionizing coding. They are not intended to replace human engineers but rather augment their capabilities. Sam Babic, the Chief Innovation Officer of Westlake, described these solutions as a \"second set of eyes,\" offering a fresh perspective and valuable assistance in programming.\n\nThis article will define AI coding, explore its main benefits and features, and evaluate five notable AI coding tools.\n\nWhat is AI coding?\n\nAI coding refers to using artificial intelligence to assist developers in writing and reviewing their code with the ultimate aim of enhancing code quality and boosting productivity. This practice is rapidly gaining popularity, as evidenced by a GitHub survey revealing that 92 percent of U.S.-based developers are already leveraging AI coding tools both in and out of work.\n\nTechnologies used in AI coding\n\nFor a clearer understanding, it's essential to grasp the main interconnected technologies driving AI coding.\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that makes machines capable of comprehending human language. It harnesses linguistic principles, statistics, and machine learning algorithms to interpret spoken or written language, going beyond literal interpretations to capture context nuances. With NLP, computers can discern a person's intent and analyze expressed sentiments, much like human perception.\n\nRead our guide to Natural Language Processing, to learn more about NLP use cases, tools, and approaches.\n\nDeep learning, a subfield of machine learning, leverages artificial neural networks that excel in analyzing large volumes of data. Deep learning is capable of handling intricate and complex tasks like speech and image recognition. AI coding tools utilize deep learning models trained on extensive datasets of source code, often derived from open-source projects.\n\nLearn more from our dedicated article on deep learning and the future of artificial intelligence.\n\nGenerative AI is, in turn, a subset of deep learning. It relies on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques to build sophisticated AI models that can produce new content based on existing text, images, audio files, or, in our case, code. The idea is to create original works undistinguishable from those produced by a human.\n\nIf you want more details, read our article about generative AI models or watch a video, explaining their value to business.\n\nFive use cases of generative AI in business.\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) represent a subset of generative AI models with the primary function of predicting the next most suitable word to fill in a blank space in given text based on the context. LLMs are trained on large collections of text data and can be applied to a range of NLP tasks.\n\nFor a deeper understanding, read our article to learn more about language models and how they work.\n\nWe also recommend checking out the article that comprehensively explains the difference between data science, machine learning, AI, deep learning, and data mining.\n\nThe benefits of AI coding\n\nWith AI coding tools on the rise, let's explore their primary advantages.\n\nBoosted productivity. AI coding tools can significantly increase productivity and accelerate code development.

Source: McKinsey Digital\n\nIn a study by McKinsey Digital, developers were assigned tasks of varying complexity with specific time constraints. The results showed that participants using generative AI were more likely to meet deadlines compared to those who didn't apply such tools. In fact, the research revealed that generative AI is especially efficient for tasks of higher complexity, improving productivity by 25 to 30 percent.\n\nImproved code quality. AI coding tools enhance code accuracy by providing real-time suggestions based on industry best practices, identifying issues, alerting on potential bugs or security vulnerabilities, and, in general, acting as a safeguard against common coding mistakes. This helps developers create cleaner and more error-free code.\n\nEmpowering non-developers and newcomers. AI coding tools make code development more accessible to non-developers and newcomers. By giving contextual guidance and responding to natural language comments, these solutions simplify programming and facilitate the learning curve. They can serve as mentors, breaking down complex concepts and providing step-by-step instructions. In essence, AI coding tools offer comprehensive assistance for non-developers and foster a supportive learning environment for newcomers.\n\nIn this section, we present the most common features of AI coding tools, exploring the diverse ways in which AI can contribute to optimizing the development process. Apart from the functionality mentioned here, some AI coding tools are also capable of code refactoring, code documentation, providing explanations, and searching for certain files and code snippets.\n\nCode completion\n\nAI code completion involves suggesting code snippets as developers type by predicting the next code that is likely to be written based on the context. This reduces manual input, enhances code consistency, and minimizes errors, which is especially valuable for repetitive tasks.\n\nCode generation\n\nAI code generation is a process that transforms natural language prompts describing the desired functionality into executable code. It comprehends the provided suggestions and then offers contextually relevant code, considering established programming patterns.\n\nRead our article on how to engineer prompts to get the best results with generative AI.\n\nCode translation\n\nCode translation refers to converting the source code into the desired programming language. It allows you to seamlessly integrate code from different teams within the organization or other open source projects. It can also reduce the effort and expense of updating legacy codebases written in ancient programming languages like COBOL or Ada.\n\nCode review\n\nCode review is an evaluation process that harnesses the power of AI to increase code quality by identifying and fixing errors. AI coding tools can also generate comments and explanations in natural language. This makes it much easier to understand the review process, which is particularly beneficial for developers seeking detailed feedback to improve their coding skills.\n\nMoreover, AI tools can evaluate code for consistency and readability to ensure that it adheres to established style guidelines and can be easily understood by other developers.\n\nHere, we provide an assessment of five widely used AI coding tools, considering critical factors that influence their suitability for particular needs. We compared them based on essential criteria such as language support, integrations, functionality, and pricing.\n\nIt's important to note that since publicly available sources are primarily in English, AI coding tools will likely work worse in scenarios where prompts are written in other languages or contain grammatical errors.\n\nA general overview of five AI coding tools.\n\nGitHub Copilot: Trained on all programming languages and mastering various coding tasks\n\nGitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer, meaning that it serves as a coding partner for developers, collaborating with them in real time.
