        "text": "Ok so I am back in the Score editor with a simple arrangement at the top.\n\nI selected All, but only the piano is shown?\n\nNext I select all the Violas on the next track but only the first region is shown?\n\nDo you have to glue all regions within a track for everything to show?\n\nAlso not sure how I get everything sitting together with a Music Title name, and a BPM for example?\n\nI've never seen this?\n\nThe music and arrangement is finished, its just my score editor and exporting seem a total mess! lol\n\nThis is very helpful, however i am still having trouble with the export process, mainly as a PDF\n\nI have tracks for Piano, Violas, Cello, and Violin 1 and Violin 2.\n\nWhen using your above gif's I am still getting weird PDF exports,\n\n1. The names of the other tracks/instruments are not showing, only the piano? so nothing else is named?\n\n2. The cello needs to be in bass clef\n\n3. The viola needs to be in alto clef\n\n4. The two violins need to be in treble\n\n5. The piano is all in right hand, but think that this is now fixed and is both left and right hand\n\n6. I now have the option of a Clarinet to add to the mix, which i believe is Bb whilst the song is in C/Am\n\nI am using Logic's Library instruments as its a small quartet, so everything is contained in Logic rather than other libraries for compatibility.\n\nDoes Logic's own library samples like Violin/Viola/clarinet, span the same as the real instruments? so I know the range of the instruments when playing? I think some of mine go 'out of range' for the particular instrument like violin?\n\nThank you for any help on this as its the first time i've ever gone near the score editor! and just need readable PDF exports really. The music is completed and fine, its just the exports have come out a mess??\n\nThanks\n\nYou have been a great help Cuauhtemoc, and am using your template to start another, hopefully knowing that it will retain the settings in Logic Score editor.\n\nJust a quick question (s), the score editor seems to be ok again after using this template of yours, but the Instrument names aren't showing again for the staves? Is there a way to show these from the Logic tracks in the arrange?\n\nAlso is there a way to put a double bar stop on the end of the sheet music (been requested)? I did think dragging the song end in Logic would create one, but it doesn't?\n\nAnd finally, how do i record the articulation switch in 'Studio Strings' to move from legato to say, staccatto on say bar 37?\n\nIs this midi note info or line automation??\n\nThank you!"
