This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.\n\nThe return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0). These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.\n\nIn the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:\n\nA list of all comparison operators:\n\nLogical Operators\n\nYou can also test for true or false values with logical operators.\n\nLogical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values, by combining multiple conditions:"
