        "text": "Computer programming powers all the websites and apps we rely on for work, entertainment, and social communication. Even if you don't work in tech, programming can make you a more valuable asset at work. State governments have some of the highest levels of employment for computer programmers, while the highest-paying industries for programmers include finance and oil and gas companies, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nEven if you're a hobbyist, programming skills may come in handy as the internet continues to further shape society. Ready to boost your career with this in-demand skill? Here's a breakdown of the most popular programming languages.\n\n6 Types of Programming Languages\n\nDifferent types of programming languages are designed to accomplish different tasks. Some, like Python, are high-level and are closer to human language, while low-level languages, like C, are similar to how computers \"think.\" We can break up thousands of programming languages that exist today into six main types that are not mutually exclusive.\n\nProcedural Programming Languages\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nProcedural programming languages basically use a set of instructions to achieve an outcome. Variables can be assigned values and modified through a program's execution, allowing you to perform calculations or store user inputs.\n\nExamples: BASIC, Java, and C++\n\nFunctional Programming Languages\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nFunctional languages use mathematical functions to perform a specific task and return a result based on what you input. Functional programming is a type of declarative programming, which tells the program what to do rather than how to do it, leaving the program to figure out how something should be done. It uses expressions, such as variables and operands, that give it a value, rather than assignment statements, which may use words such as if, while, and for.\n\nExamples: Scala and Elixir\n\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) Languages\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nOOP uses data structures or objects that have their own properties or attributes. This language tries to imitate how objects work in the real world. Using OOP in software allows objects to interact with each other, making it more efficient and easier to use or fix if an issue arises.\n\nOOP treats a program as a group of objects made up of classes, objects, attributes, and methods. Classes are frameworks that use methods, or a set of instructions, to create child objects with certain attributes or properties.\n\nExamples: Java, Python, JavaScript, and C#\n\nScripting Languages\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nYou can use scripting languages to automate repetitive tasks, manage dynamic web content, or support processes in larger applications. Scripting languages produce scripts that must run within the shell or program they were designed for and can't be compiled, meaning the code isn't translated into machine code, which would make it easier for a computer to read. Scripting languages are used for back-end and front-end development, system administration, and plugin and extension writing.\n\nExamples: JavaScript, PHP, R, and Perl\n\nLogic Programming Languages\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nA logic programming language uses logic, or a series of facts and rules, to tell a computer how to make decisions. This type of language is used in AI to represent knowledge and reasoning. Logic programming can be used for natural language processing and other tasks.\n\nExamples: Prolog, Lisp, and Clojure\n\nImperative Programming\n\nChevron Down\n\nChevron Up\n\nImplicit programming, a counterpart to declarative programming, uses implicitly coded functions in each step to solve a problem. It focuses on how a problem is solved rather than what needs to be solved. This is sometimes also called algorithmic programming or procedural programming. Because the code reads like step-by-step instructions, some imperative programming languages are considered easier to learn and are good for beginners.\n\nExamples: Pascal, C, and Java\n\nFind the Right Coding Bootcamp For You\n\n12 Most Popular Programming Languages to Learn\n\nWant to learn code? With anywhere from 250-2,500 coding languages in use today, it makes sense to start with some of the most commonly used and popular languages.\n\nYou'll find that many of these languages are similar or commonly used together. Some were created to extend the capabilities of others. Some are so flexible they could be a part of almost any IT project. Below are the 12 most popular programming languages to learn.\n\nPython\n\nPython is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented language that can also be used as a scripting language to connect components. Python can be used for SEO and data analytics. It also has important cybersecurity uses and can analyze malware, scan ports, and send and receive packets. It's the most popular programming language of 2022 and is considered one of the easiest languages to learn.\n\nJavaScript (JS)\n\nJS is widely used for front-end development; most websites use this coding language to make interactive features. With JS, you can display updates, interactive maps, and animated graphics. It can also be used to create browser and third-party APIs.\n\nTypeScript\n\nTypeScript, a superset of JS, is an open-sourced programming language that allows users to easily identify types of data as well as errors.\n\nJava\n\nJava is an object-oriented, compiled programming language designed specifically for coding apps and services for the internet. It looks and feels like C++ but is simpler to use.\n\nIt is the second most popular programming language to learn and is also considered to be difficult to hack. You can start to build a portfolio as a novice by completing some beginner projects like making your own currency converter or calculator.\n\nSQL\n\nSQL is used for managing relational database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. You can use SQL to store and alter information in a database as well as optimize database performance. One strength of this programming language is its ability to integrate with other languages like Java. It also uses English-like statements, making it easier to understand.\n\nC#\n\nC# is an object-oriented language that runs on the .NET framework. It can be used to develop dynamic web pages, games, and workflow apps. It provides operators that can perform arithmetic, compare operands, use Boolean logic, and perform other tasks.\n\nPlenty of paid and free online bootcamps are available to learn C#.\n\nGo (aka Golang)\n\nGo is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It is modeled after C and was inspired by Python's simplicity. Go is a favorite choice for cloud-based or server-side applications and is also used for artificial intelligence, data science, and robotics. Go is popular for its simplicity and efficiency, and was intended to replace server-side languages like Java and C++.\n\nC or C++\n\nC is a versatile, general-use coding language first developed in 1972 at AT&T Labs. C++ is a superset of C. You can use C++ for both procedural and object-oriented programming. On the other hand, C is strictly a procedural language. The syntax for C and C++ is similar to those of Java and Python. C is considered faster but more difficult to learn than these two popular counterparts.\n\nSwift\n\nSwift was first released only for native iOS development in 2014 and remains one of the top languages for iOS app developers. It was created with the intention of simplifying Objective-C, another top choice for Apple developers. Swift runs up to 2.6 times faster than Objective-C.\n\nSwift is one of the easier coding languages to learn. A 2016 update made Swift compatible with the Linux operating system, and in 2020, it became available for the Windows operating system.\n\nPHP\n\nPHP is used to create customizable and dynamic websites. It supports object-oriented and scripting programming paradigms and works closely with HTML. A PHP interpreter connects the user with the web server, databases, and the responses sent back to the user.\n\nBack-end and full-stack engineers choose this language for its ease of use. It also has data encryption and access restrictions, bringing in built-in cybersecurity. You'll often see online forms use PHP.\n\nRuby\n\nRuby is an object-oriented scripting language. It's a general-purpose language that is often used for web applications, data processing, and automation tools. Thanks to its straightforward syntax, Ruby is easier to pick up. The language is different from Ruby on Rails, which is a web development framework that extends the Ruby language.\n\nKotlin\n\nKotlin is an object-oriented language that works and exchanges information well with the Java virtual machine (JVM). It's often used in combination with Java and is the preferred language of Android, though you can also use it for web development and data visualization. Java files can also be converted into Kotlin files.\n\nWhich Programming Language Should I Learn?\n\nSo which programming language should you learn? It depends. Every language has its strengths and capabilities. Whether you're brand new to coding or you're on your way to becoming a systems programmer, here's what programming languages you might want to get into depending on your career goals.\n\nTrue Beginner\n\nScratch is unique in that it was developed by MIT Media Lab to help teach people how to code. It's a block-based, drag-and-drop programming language that is used educationally in schools.\n\nJavaScript is a great way to dip your toes into building a dynamic, interactive webpage as a beginner project. Java, which is unrelated to JavaScript, is a simple, object-oriented programming language that is easier to learn and reads like English.\n\nPython is arguably easier to learn than Java because it's an interpreted language. This means the language executes instructions directly, unlike a compiled language, where a programmer's code is changed to machine code by a compiler.\n\nSQL will make it easier to navigate relational databases, which can help you produce research and write reports.\n\nFull-Stack Developer\n\nA full-stack developer fulfills the role of both a front-end and back-end developer. Some languages are more useful for front-end developers and client-side development, while others pull more weight for back-end developers and server-side development. Languages like JS, Kotlin, and Swift are useful for both areas.\n\nFront-End: JavaScript can help you improve user experience (UX) on a website, while TypeScript is useful for larger applications.\n\nBack-End: Back-end developers can also use JavaScript for dynamic typing and lightweight scripting. Python is useful for object-oriented programming. Ruby, PHP, C#, and SQL are also widely used on the back-end.\n\nMobile App Developer\n\nKotlin is growing in popularity for Android app development. Swift is the most popular language for iOS, but legacy apps will still use Objective-C. Java has persisted as a scalable solution for Android apps.\n\nGo is a popular language for building scalable backend services behind mobile apps. Frameworks like Kivy and BeeWare make Python a good choice for cross-platform applications, and JS is a favorite for back-end and front-end app development.\n\nDesktop App Developer\n\nThe addition of new frameworks like NodeGUI, Proton Native, and AppJS makes it possible to use JS for desktop applications. C# can be used to develop desktop apps that run on .NET. It also has nullable types and automatic garbage collection.\n\nPython can be used to connect components, while Java's cross-platform capabilities make it popular for platform-independent development. Go, Kotlin, Swift, and Ruby are other popular choices. Rust is good for writing scalable applications.\n\nSystems Programmer\n\nIf you want to be a systems programmer, C++ will likely be useful. This language is backward compatible, meaning it can interact with older versions of C. C is also considered a good language to know because its design informed the programming languages that followed.\n\nRust allows you to balance efficient programming with high performance and control over hardware. Java and Python are also helpful to know here.\n\nData Scientist\n\nData scientists may want to know Python for its libraries that give access to data analytics algorithms. SQL is useful for retrieving and editing information from data sets. JavaScript is useful for visualizing data.\n\nAmong the more advanced languages, R can perform statistical operations, while Scala performs well in large organizations and can handle high-volume datasets. C++ pairs well with Python and can be used to compile large datasets.\n\nSoftware Developer\n\nAs a software developer, you can use Python for data analysis, prototyping, and automation. Other versatile programming languages like Java and JavaScript will be useful to have in your toolkit of programming languages.
