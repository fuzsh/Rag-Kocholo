There are close to five hundred programming languages that modern coders use.\n\nWhile most languages are pretty easy, some of them are the hardest programming languages to learn. It’s important to understand that the difficulty of a programming language is subject to vary by individuals, their skills, and experience.\n\nWith this article, we have tried to rank some of the common programming languages from easiest to hardest.
