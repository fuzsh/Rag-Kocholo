Finding a tool that could captivate a third grader and simultaneously intrigue an eighth-grader was like finding a needle in a haystack.”\n\n—Robin C. Litchfield, NH.\n\nSouthern Tioga School District\n\n\"Having the hardware and software, but with the realistic 3D simulator, they're not dependent on each other. Being able to use it with or without the physical robot, the iRobot Coding App just seems like the most complete package that's out there for teachers.\"\n\n—Rachel S. Blossburg, PA.\n\nHyde Park Day School\n\n\"The decision to go with the iRobot Coding App was driven by its adaptability to different learning stages and its seamless integration with our existing curriculum. The potential of this tool goes beyond just coding. We're exploring ways to integrate it into math, science, and even language arts.\"\n\n—Jen G. Chicago, IL."
