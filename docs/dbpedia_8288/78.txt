UNDERSTAND, not just LEARN

Graphically Enhanced Manuals (GEM) are a different type of manual with a visual approach that helps you UNDERSTAND a program, not just LEARN it. No need to read through 500 pages of dry text explanations. Rich graphics and diagrams help you to get that "aha" effect and make it easy to comprehend difficult concepts. The Graphically Enhanced Manuals let you master a program much faster with a much deeper understanding of concepts, features and, workflows in a very intuitive way that is easy to understand.
