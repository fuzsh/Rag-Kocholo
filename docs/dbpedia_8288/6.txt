Had the same problem with chord display suddenly for no apparent reason showing weird variations of a C chord when Dm, Em etc. triad played. Tried everything I could find on the web, nothing worked. Then tried this from Apple Support page and problem solved! My keyboard is a Novation Impulse49.

Delete the PLIST file for control surfaces If you use a control surface with Logic Pro, try deleting the PLIST file for control surfaces. Quit Logic Pro. In the Finder, choose Go > Go to Folder. Enter ~/Library/Preferences, then click Go. Delete the “com.apple.logic.pro.cs” file from the Preferences folder. Restart your Mac. Open Logic Pro. Depending on your control surface, you might need to add the control surface again to use it with Logic Pro. If you're using Logic Remote, you're prompted to reconnect Logic Remote when you open the Logic Remote app for the first time after deleting the PLIST file. If you're using a device that supports the EuCon protocol, you don't have to add it within Logic Pro.
