The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today's prayer will be offered by the guest Chaplain, Pastor Sunday Adelaja from Kiev, Ukraine. ______ prayer The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer: O, Lord of creation, we acknowledge Your lordship today, Your sovereignty, love, and power. We ask that You will bless the United States of America in these days of great uncertainties. Bless the leaders of this great Nation with the wisdom needed to lead the Nation in the right direction. As leaders, we realize there are some things we want but do not need and some things we need but do not want. You have promised to meet our needs but not satisfy our greed. Help us to realize our decisions have a destiny, our choices have consequences, our path has a purpose, our faith has a foundation, our home has a hope, and this country has a cause. Acknowledging that as America goes, so goes our world, I ask for a sweeping, weeping, and reaping revival throughout this great Nation. May Your Kingdom come and Your will be done in America as it is in heaven. Help us to remember that America is great because America is good. If America ceases to be good, it will cease to be great. God of heaven, please help America to continue to be good. In Jesus' Name. Amen. ____________________ PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Honorable Jim Webb, a Senator from the State of Virginia, led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. ____________________ APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please read a communication to the Senate from the President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd). The assistant legislative clerk read the following letter: U.S. Senate, President pro tempore, Washington, DC, April 23, 2007. To the Senate: Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable Jim Webb, a Senator from the State of Virginia, to perform the duties of the Chair. Robert C. Byrd, President pro tempore. Mr. WEBB thereupon assumed the chair as Acting President pro tempore. ____________________ RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized. ____________________ SCHEDULE Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the time until 2:45 is equally divided, with the majority controlling the first portion of the time. Senator Casey is here and will be using that time to do a tribute. At 2:45 today, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 761, the competitiveness bill. While there are no rollcall votes today, I understand the managers are working on some amendments which could be offered today. Later this week, we expect to receive the supplemental conference report, and the Senate will act on that report prior to concluding business this week. ____________________ RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. ____________________ MORNING BUSINESS The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will now be a period for the transaction of morning business until 2:45 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak therein, with the first half controlled by the majority leader or his designee and the second half controlled by the minority leader or his designee. The Senator from Pennsylvania. (The remarks of Mr. Casey pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 166 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'') Mr. CASEY. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming. ____________________ IRAQ FUNDING Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about an issue that seems to be the most pressing of any we have before us; that is, to fund our troops in Iraq. I came to the floor on the 64th day following the President's submission to the Congress of legislation for funding our troops in the field. I believed it was important that we urge Congress to complete its work on this legislation immediately. How could there be anything more pressing than making funding available for our troops? Certainly, the time is now. It is now day 77, and we still don't have a bill to send to the President. It is time we do so. In fact, the conference committee has not even met. Even though both houses of Congress have passed the measure, they have yet to come together between the Houses in order to do something. Our military leaders are people in the best position to prioritize the needs of our troops. They are the ones who know what needs to be done and what the timing is. They have left no doubt that this funding is urgently needed, without arbitrary deadlines or unrelated pork, both of which are in the bill. Unfortunately, there are a number of Members who want to call the shots and micromanage the execution of the war. I understand there are different views about the war. There are different views about what our role should be. But the fact is, we are there now. We have had a change in direction. We have some new ideas, new leadership. But we have the troops there. They need to be supported financially so they cannot only do their job, certainly, but protect themselves. If we don't get this funding to the troops, the first thing to be cut without this supplemental will be facilities maintenance throughout the services, particularly the Army. In addition, counseling programs for both troops and their families will have to be cut back. As to this idea that there is no hurry, that we can find the money somewhere else, Members need to be sure they understand that finding it somewhere else takes it away from someone else who has earned it, either through service or families of service people. More and more troops and their families are seeking counseling, and reducing funding at this critical time certainly needs to be avoided. Failing to act immediately will have real-life impacts on military personnel. I should think we could come to that understanding. I don't know quite what the timing is seeking to do--apparently, impress on the President the points of view being made on the other side of the aisle or whatever. But he has made it clear what he is going to do. We know that. We know we have to go there and get it vetoed, come back [[Page 9605]] and find something that is acceptable. All that takes time. All the time we spend puts more risk on the military and their families. I believe failing to enact this legislation very soon will have real- life impacts on our military personnel. I can't find much reason for that. If we can't take care of our troops' mental health and see that they aren't living in dilapidated barracks, we will have a hard time ensuring they are able to fight when the Nation calls. I hope we can continue to remember what giving these people are doing, what they are sacrificing. We need, of course, to support them. It is very simple. If our troops don't have the training to deploy, then our soldiers and sailors overseas cannot come home, and that is kind of the situation we are increasingly in now. At this point the only priority should be funding our troops in the field. Even though we have other work to do, certainly if we look at priorities, what could be more important than dealing with the needs of our troops overseas. I don't know if James Baker would have been any clearer when we reiterated that the Iraq Study Group report does not set timetables or deadlines for the troop withdrawal. James Baker said: The [Iraq Study Group] report does not set timetables or deadlines for the removal of troops, as contemplated by the supplemental spending bill the House and the Senate passed. In fact, the report specifically opposes that approach. As many military and political leaders told us, an arbitrary deadline would allow the enemy to wait us out and strengthen the positions of extremists over moderates. Several months ago the President indicated he would establish a new direction in Iraq. General Petraeus is back in Washington today to report on the counterinsurgency plan. Certainly, it isn't doing everything we want it to yet. It hasn't achieved success yet. But it is moving in the right direction. We have a change in people. We have a change in leadership. We have a change in the plan. It has only been 3 months since we installed the general and only 60 percent of the troops are in place he had wanted and suggested were necessary. Despite these modest improvements, the other side wants to pack up and admit defeat. They are also claiming the war is lost, and that is unfortunate, especially when our troops hear those comments. In any event, I hope this Congress does what is responsible and sends the President a bill. Our troops deserve to know Congress will provide them with the funding they need to succeed. I wanted to talk on that issue. It is one of the most important we have. I look forward to proceeding with what will be before us on the floor now, education. Sharpening up our competitiveness is very important. I am hopeful we can assure Members that this program with this money and additional spending will have some impact. As we look at it, we have lots of programs that are designed to strengthen education, yet we don't have a very good measurement of whether those dollars are causing things to happen that we hoped they would. I look forward to that. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains in morning business on our side? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Nine minutes. Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair. ____________________ EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for the past several weeks, there has been a lot of debate and discussion about the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that has been pending now before Congress for more than 2 months. Completion of this emergency supplemental is critical for our troops serving on the front lines and for their families here at home. The President has requested, and Congress should be prepared to send immediately to the White House, a clean bill that meets our obligations to the troops. This legislation should not be used as a vehicle to pass billions of dollars of unrelated Federal spending or impose artificial deadlines on our commanders in the field. We have to move forward with this important military funding legislation because our troops deserve nothing less. I want to highlight a few of the items that are included in this supplemental appropriations bill so our colleagues can appreciate how essential it is to get these funds to our troops as soon as possible. This funding will ensure that our forces who are engaged in operations overseas have the very best force protection equipment available, as well as the most effective weaponry, communications gear, munitions, and other essential items. For example, high priority items in the supplemental for our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan include: funding for body armor and other personal protection items; aircraft survivability components, radios, night vision equipment, armored vehicles, and high mobility, multipurpose vehicle Fragmentation Kits; funding for Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Systems, at $2.4 billion. Yes, that Improvised Explosive Device Defeat System is the very type of technology we need to protect our troops from the type of weapon that has been more responsible than virtually any other for injuring our soldiers. In the supplemental, more than $5 billion in funding is designed for the ongoing surge of U.S. forces to support General Petraeus's revised strategy in Baghdad. Nearly $4 billion in funding is to accelerate the transition of two Army brigade combat teams and establish a new Marine Corps regimental combat team. Nearly $2 billion is to increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps to build combat capability, and lengthen the time soldiers and marines have between deployments. There is some very important equipment our troops are being denied while we linger in passing this important supplemental. As I mentioned a moment ago, IEDs, or improvised explosive devices, continue to strike our troops during ambushes, and IEDs are responsible for a substantial number of the casualties. The Marines and the Army have responded to enemy tactics with the acquisition of substantial numbers of up-armored HMMWVs and advanced armor kits for other vehicles. But the Army and Marines must continue to develop and field a mine-resistant ambush protected, MRAP, combat vehicle fleet capable of sustained operations on an IED-heavy battlefield. A type of the so-called MRAP is depicted on this chart I have in the Chamber. I believe this particular one shown here is known as the Cougar. What is distinctive about this vehicle, which is so important to get to our troops, is it represents a change in technology, with a V-shaped hull underlying this vehicle, which actually will disperse the energy from an improvised explosive device away from the troops located inside the vehicle. I had occasion to visit a manufacturing facility located in Sealy, TX, owned by Armor Holdings, which is constructing these very same vehicles, which are the subject of some of the funds contained in the supplemental. The President's fiscal year 2007 supplemental request asked for $1.83 billion for mine-resistant ambush protected, or MRAP, vehicles like this one shown in the picture. In addition, Senator Biden offered an amendment, which passed the Senate 98 to 0, that provided an additional $1.5 billion in funding for these critical MRAP vehicles. The total MRAP funding in the supplemental is now almost $4 billion. From what I saw in Sealy at the Armor Holdings facility, and from what I have heard from our troops, this is exactly the kind of equipment they need but which is now being delayed as [[Page 9606]] Congress continues to debate this supplemental appropriations bill. The mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle is an armored combat vehicle capable of providing superior protection to our warfighters against these kinds of IEDs. According to Marine Corps BG John Allen, Deputy Commander of Coalition Forces in Anbar Province, in more than 300 attacks since last year, no marines have died while riding in a new fortified MRAP armed vehicle. There has been an average of less than one injured marine per attack on the vehicles, while attacks on other types of vehicles caused more than two casualties per attack, including deaths, according to Brigadier General Allen. Our deployed servicemembers in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve this latest class of armored protection to protect them against the ever- present IED threat, and they do not need funding for this important vehicle to be held up. Let me close by highlighting the effect of delayed supplemental funding on our military. The Army announced on April 16 that because of the lack of passage of this supplemental, it will materially slow spending to various places. In order to stretch the money it has, the Army will tell commanders to slow spending in certain areas so war-related activities and support to families can continue. The Department of Defense will also request that Congress approve the temporary reprogramming of $1.6 billion from Navy and Air Force pay accounts to the Army's operating account. Beginning in mid-April--about this time--the Army has begun to slow the purchase of repair parts and other supplies, relying instead on existing inventory to keep equipment operational. Priority will be given to repair and refurbishment of immediately needed war-fighting equipment, while training and other nonmission critical equipment repair will be deferred. In addition, the purchase of day-to-day supplies with governmental charge cards will be restricted, nonessential travel will be postponed or canceled, and shipment of equipment and supplies will be restricted or deferred altogether, unless needed immediately for war efforts. The Army has added it will also delay the repair of facilities and environmental programs unless the work is for safety or health reasons, or has effects on family support. These actions carry significant consequences, including substantial disruption to installation functions, decreasing efficiency, and potentially further degrading the readiness of nondeployed units. These decisions may actually add to the Army's costs over time. Just as importantly, as Army Deputy Budget Director William Campbell said in the New York Times: Frankly, what I worry about is that second- or third-order effect that might affect a soldier or a soldier's safety or his ability to do a mission. Mr. Campbell said: As we put these brakes on, I do worry about the impact that we don't know about, that someone will take some action trying to do the right thing, but it will have a negative impact on the ability of a soldier to do his or her job. The New York Times also reported that unless the budget standoff is resolved by the end of June, Pentagon officials have warned that units preparing to go to Iraq may not have enough money to undertake all of their required training. It should go without saying, but apparently it needs to be said again, our troops need this funding, and they need it soon. Without it, it is simply a fact that our troops will be put at increased risk. We have been ready for weeks to work in good faith to pass a clean supplemental funding bill the President can sign as soon as possible. But every day we do not fund our troops is a day their ability to fight this war is weakened and they are exposed to additional danger. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________ CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Morning business is closed. ____________________ AMERICA COMPETES ACT The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 761, which the clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 761) to invest in innovation and education to improve the competitiveness of the United States in the global economy. Amendment No. 904 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself and Senator Alexander. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report. The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and Mr. Alexander, proposes an amendment numbered 904. Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: (Purpose: To strike the NIST working capital fund provision) On page 44, beginning with line 16 strike through line 2 on page 45. On page 45, line 3, strike ``(d)'' and insert ``(c)''. On page 47, line 8, strike ``(e)'' and insert ``(d)''. On page 47, line 21, strike ``(f)'' and insert ``(e)''. Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, at this point I will yield the floor. I know my colleague from Tennessee wishes to speak about a variety of issues, and then there is another amendment which we also will be sending to the desk for Senator Inouye, who will be here fairly shortly, related to provisions that have come from the Commerce Committee. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we have Senator Inouye here, who has played a major role in the development of this legislation, and I believe we will have a little later Senator Stevens, who is right behind me now, and Senator Domenici after that. So I am going to let the two distinguished chairs of the Commerce Committee speak. Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, technological innovation is the lifeblood of U.S. economic growth and well-being. To achieve growth and success, the United States must continue to support the two critical components necessary during the early stages of the innovation ecosystem: education and basic research. A pipeline of well-educated secondary school students feeds into the college ranks, which in turn feeds into the graduate schools. Graduate students engage in challenging and cutting edge research led by principal investigators that often are funded by Federal grants. Many times the students and scientists will make a breakthrough discovery of innovation and attempt to commercialize it. If successful, they will have created the next great generation, great American company that sells the next great product, employing thousands of people and driving this economy's economic growth further. The United States has the luxury of claiming many of the world's top scientific minds. These leading scientists either emigrate to the United States because we provide some of the best facilities and resources or they are home grown, having excelled through the U.S. educational system to reach the top echelons of their respective disciplines. However, this premier standing we have enjoyed in the past is in serious jeopardy. As a result, many believe our economic prosperity is at risk. Today the Senate has a unique opportunity to respond to the Nation's defining economic challenge in the 21st century, and that is how to remain strong [[Page 9607]] and competitive in the face of the emerging challenges from India, China, and the rest of the world. We have examined the expert reports and today the Senate is considering S. 761, the America COMPETES Act. S. 761 is a bipartisan product of several committees including: the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee; the Energy Committee; and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. As chairman of the Commerce Committee, which was instrumental in developing Divisions A and D of the bill, I encourage my colleagues to support S. 761. Many point out that the United States' declining scientific prowess is palpable. They cite, for example, the country's dismal proficiency scores: less than one-third of U.S. fourth-graders performed at or above a level deemed ``proficient'' and about one-fifth of eighth- graders lacked the competency to perform basic math computations. U.S. 15-year-olds ranked 22 out of 28 Organization for Economic Co-Operation Development, OECD, countries tested in mathematics. This is a troubling statistic. In math and science education our country is losing ground to the likes of Germany, China, and Japan. In the United States, only 32 percent graduate with college degrees in science and engineering, while 36 percent of German undergraduates receive degrees in science and engineering. In China it is 59 percent, and in Japan, 66 percent of undergraduates receive science and engineering degrees. In 2004, China graduated over 600,000 engineers; India, 350,000; and the United States, less than 70,000. These statistics are alarming and will have dire consequences as the U.S. talent pipeline begins to dry up. To respond, the America COMPETES Act emphasizes science, education, and technology as the keystones of a comprehensive American competitiveness agenda. We considered programs in several agencies. Within the Department of Commerce, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, is charged with promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology. The bill would continue NIST on a 10-year doubling path and promote high-risk, high-reward research within the agency. Also within the Department of Commerce. the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, conducts significant basic atmospheric and oceanographic research, including climate change research. Its management decisions and operational programs rely on a strong scientific and technical underpinning. Some have argued that the ocean truly is the last frontier on Earth, and ocean research and technology may have broad impacts on improving health and understanding our environment. Toward this end, our committee included modest provisions on NOAA research and education, which we hope to strengthen during the course of debate on S. 761. The bill also includes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the administration's competitiveness agenda. Like the oceans, space captivates the minds of our young people and can help attract them into a lifelong study of science. America COMPETES continues the Senate's commitment to doubling the funding of the National Science Foundation. The Foundation is the Nation's premier investment in undirected, basic science. The bulk of its funding is distributed as competitive grants. The bill includes provisions to ensure all States, including small States like Hawaii, can share in important research funding. After all, good ideas know no boundaries. In order to be strong, we will need the ideas and leadership of researchers and entrepreneurs in every corner of the Nation. I was pleased to work with my colleagues on the HELP Committee to develop the NSF education provisions. I am proud to have included programs to encourage women to have careers in science, technology, mathematics, and engineering. In recent years, we have passed legislation affecting interagency research in nanotechnology, information technology, computer security, climate change, oceans and human health, earthquake research, wind research, and aeronautics research. The America COMPETES Act provides for a Science Summit to encourage interactivity and knowledge sharing between science, scientists, and industry. I would like to end by noting that technology and innovation pervade many policy problems that the Commerce Committee and the Congress face. Changes in telecommunications policy are being driven by innovation. In particular, low broadband penetration is cited as a factor in the loss of competitiveness in many U.S. regions. Also, our transportation infrastructure would benefit from increased investment and deployment of new technologies, such as investment in technologies that can increase energy independence. To succeed in a whole host of arenas, we need scientific discoveries and a technologically savvy workforce. If enacted, the America COMPETES Act can provide the first step for this country to get back into the global race. Many countries are looking to overtake us to claim technological and economic superiority. While we continue to lead, we cannot take this lead for granted. I fully support what we are trying to accomplish with the America COMPETES Act and I look forward to working with my colleagues towards its final passage. Mr. President, working with Senators Stevens, Hutchison, other committee members, and members of other committees, we have developed a small package of amendments to the Commerce Committee sections of the bill. We took an expansive view of American competitiveness and wanted to ensure that the research agencies in our Government and jurisdiction could fully participate in interagency programs to address innovation and competitiveness. This amendment is just the provisions regarding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to align them with those addressing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I hope we can agree to even stronger provisions to promote ocean education. The oceans, like outer space, hold such a lure for young people and can draw them into a lifelong study in key fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. These students may someday invent products that keep our Nation economically competitive. The amendment also strikes a provision related to the sale of standard reference materials by the National Institute of Standards and Technology that could have resulted in a million dollars of direct spending. With this amendment, the bill contains no direct spending. The amendment adjusts the authorization levels for the National Science Foundation, so that the increase will not fluctuate but will be a consistent 15 percent annually. As amended, the fiscal year 2008 level for NSF is $300 million over the President's requested level, reflecting the $302 million in new education programs authorized in the bill. In addition, the amendment changes the authorized funding level for NSF's education and human resources programs to $1.05 billion in fiscal year 2008, and for the experimental program for competitive research, to $125 million in fiscal year 2008. These programs would grow annually from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2011 at the same rate that NSF overall funding grows. Finally, there are a series of technical changes to the bill that, first, add mathematics and engineering and technology in the Science Summit in section 1101; second, change the goal for increasing participation in two NSF fellowship and traineeship programs to a 4- year goal, matching the pendency of the authorizations in the bill; and third, on behalf of Senator Hutchison, we make a clarifying change to section 4006 regarding NSF priorities. Mr. President, I appreciate all of my colleagues' help in improving the Commerce Committee section and look forward to adopting this modest agreement and amendment so that we can begin to debate S. 761 in earnest. I yield the floor. [[Page 9608]] The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alaska speaks and while the Senator from Hawaii will be here for a while longer, I wanted to call attention to their leadership on this bill and their sense of urgency about the importance of it in the Commerce Committee. I wanted to relate specifically an event a year ago, in August, in Beijing, China, which I related on the floor when the bill was introduced. I think it puts into perspective why so many Senators on both sides of the aisle have worked on that, why the bill is being introduced by both the Democratic and Republican leaders, and why it came directly to the floor and is ready for action. Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye took a group of Senators to China. They were especially well received--this Congressional Medal of Honor winner and this Flying Tiger pilot who flew the first cargo plane into Beijing toward the end of World War II. As a result, we spent an hour with President Hu and another hour with the No. 2 man, Vice Premier Wu. We talked about all of the things one would expect in that discussion: North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. But the subject, I recall, about which both of those leaders of China were most animated was the subject we are discussing on the floor today: How is China going to increase its brainpower advantage so it can create more jobs? President Hu told us that he had done what we are doing today but in the Chinese way. He had, a month earlier, gone to the Great Hall of the People in China and assembled their national academy of science and engineering of China and established a 15-year goal for innovation and declared they would spend a certain amount in research and investment. That was the way they were going to raise their standard of living to compete with the United States. We see that with the recruitment of Chinese-born scholars who were educated in the United States and are going back to China to create even better universities there. We saw, under the sponsorship of these two Senators, that the two top leaders of that country understand very well America's brainpower advantage, which has been the greatest source of this remarkably high standard of living we have, and the fact that we produce 30 percent of all of the money in the world for just 5 percent of the people. I wanted to acknowledge their leadership and put into perspective that visit just last year in China. Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I agree wholeheartedly with my friend. We should not take the Chinese goal lightly. They mean business. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is recognized. Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I strongly support S. 761, which Senator Inouye just discussed. This is the America COMPETES Act. Fifty-six Senators, including members of both parties' leadership and several committee chairmen, are cosponsors of this important legislation. When it was first brought to my attention last year, I tried to see if we could organize a joint committee of the Congress to act on this subject because I believe it is extremely important. Having read the Augustine report, I knew we had to move as quickly as possible. That was not possible last year, but I believe it is this year. Many reports have revealed the serious competitive challenges we face. In 2003, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, compared 15-year-old students living in 40 industrialized nations. For America, the results were very dire. Our students placed 16th in reading, 23rd in science, and 29th in math. Carl Sagan said it best when he wrote this: We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology. Another report I mentioned before, the Augustine report, entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' contains the findings of the Commission chaired by Norman Augustine, the retired chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin. This study also paints an alarming picture of America's ability to compete in the 21st century. Economists informed Commission members that ``about half of the U.S. economic growth since World War II has been the result of technological innovation.'' But Commission members also discovered that our young people now spend more time watching television than they do in school or studying for school. They determined that hiring one engineer in America now carries the same cost as hiring eight engineers in India. They reported that 38 percent of the scientists and engineers with doctorates in our country were born abroad. If those young men and women choose to live and work in other countries, America will face a severe shortage of talented workers. If we are to maintain our competitive edge, we must improve the education our students receive in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. We must equip our teachers with the tools and resources they need, and we must encourage those who study in America to stay in America. This legislation we are now considering is a tremendous step forward in these efforts. S. 761 seeks to ensure our Nation remains the global leader in innovation. It would increase Federal investment in basic research, improve educational opportunities for young students to become excited about these fields, and develop an innovation infrastructure appropriate for the 21st century. The America COMPETES Act is the result of bipartisan cooperation between three committees: Commerce, Energy, and HELP. Since last year, these committees have worked together to address key concerns and solutions identified by the Council on Competitiveness and the National Academies. A number of Senators also deserve recognition for their leadership on this matter: Senators Bingaman, Alexander, Ensign, Hutchison, Domenici, Inouye, Kennedy, Lieberman, Mikulski, and Nelson. They all deserve our deepest gratitude, and I am sure there are others. Without their hard work and dedication, our bill would not have reached the Senate floor. In closing, let me say that educating the next generation of American innovators must be a priority for this Congress. Our Nation is at the crossroads, and the decisions we make today will affect us for decades to come. This bill, when enacted, will reaffirm our commitment to America's economic future. I urge each of our colleagues to support its swift passage. I thank the Chair. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to say to the Senator from Alaska that if he, who last year was President pro tempore of the Senate, and Senator Inouye, one of our leading Senators on the Democratic side, had not from the beginning placed such a priority on this legislation, it could never have made its way through the committees and reached this point. So I salute them for their willingness to look into our country's future and see the importance of this issue. Mr. President, if the Senator from Hawaii doesn't have further comments at the moment, I might use the time for the next few moments to talk about a couple of items. One is how we got here with this legislation and, two, more about what it does. First, let me say on behalf of the leadership, Senators Reid, McConnell, Bingaman, Inouye, and others, we hope that Senators will bring their amendments today, or early. Let us see them so that we can talk about them and, if necessary, vote on them. The Democratic leader and the Republican leader have created an environment in which we can deal with this bill in the way the Senate ought to be dealing with a piece of legislation that is at least on a subject as important as any other subject that will be before us. In other words, the bill is on the floor. We are ready to receive amendments. We are ready to vote on amendments, if necessary. I am sure the Democratic leader, who will announce [[Page 9609]] his schedule, would like to finish the bill by Wednesday sometime because we have other important legislation to consider this week. So I hope we make the most of today, tomorrow, and Wednesday. Just a word about how the Senate got here. I mentioned earlier that in China, President Hu could simply call a meeting in the Great Hall of the People and, with his national academies of science and engineering, declare that: This is where we are going for the next 15 years. In China, that works pretty well, and that is likely where they are going. They have very specific goals, for example, for the amount of gross domestic product they will be spending on research and development, what they will be doing with their universities, and how they hope to improve their schools. In the United States, we have to work in a little different way. The result we have here today with this legislation, which is 2,008 pages long--and I know that because I reread it over the weekend. It came in a different way. Senator Bingaman and I, with the encouragement and sponsorship of Senator Domenici, who was chairman of one of the affected committees here, literally asked the National Academy of Sciences this question a couple of years ago: What are the top 10 actions in priority order that Federal policymakers could take over the next 10 years to help the United States keep our advantage in science and technology? We figured that Members of Congress were not necessarily the best ones to make those recommendations. I am sure the Presiding Officer has some idea of some math or science program he thinks might be best or at least he has two or three friends who have an idea. I know the Senator from Hawaii has one. I have five or six myself. We thought perhaps we should ask the people who are supposed to know. We asked the National Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine exactly what should we in the Congress be doing. It is my view most ideas fail around here for the lack of an idea, so we asked them specifically for an idea. The academies took us seriously. They assembled an all-star panel of business, Government, and university leaders headed by Norman Augustine, as the Senator from Alaska said, the former chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin, a member himself of the National Academy of Engineering. That panel included three Nobel Prize winners. Those very busy people, including university president Bob Gates, now Secretary of Defense, and the Nobel Prize winners, gave up their summer, and they took our question seriously. Exactly what does the United States need to do to keep our brain power advantage, is really the question. We asked for 10 and they gave us 20 recommendations. The recommendations are in this report, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' to which the two Senators have referred. To their credit, they put it in priority order. I will talk more in a minute about what the priorities are. They started with kindergarten through 12th grade, 10,000 teachers, 10 million minds, K-12 science and math education: ``Sowing the Seeds through Science and Engineering Research,'' ``Best and Brightest in Science and Engineering Higher Education,'' ``Incentives for Innovation and the Investment Environment.'' They gave us 20 recommendations in priority order. That was not the only idea before the Senate at that time, nor were those of us in the Senate the only ones involved. Representatives Sherwood Boehlert and Mark Gordon of the House Committee on Science had joined us in asking this question. I know Representative Gordon, who is now chairman of the House Science Committee, moved forward quickly to introduce in the House of Representatives similar legislation. What did we do when we got these 20 recommendations? As I mentioned, they were not the only recommendations. Senator Bingaman and Senator Hutchison, for example, had been working for many years to increase the number of children, especially low-income children, who could take the advanced placement courses. Those are a ticket to college, and there are a lot of bright kids who don't have the money to pay for the tests or who go to schools where the teachers are not trained to teach the courses. They have been working on that for a long time. Senator Bond from Missouri and Senator Mikulski of Maryland have been speaking about this for a long time. Then there was an excellent piece of legislation by Senator Lieberman and Senator Ensign which had in it recommendations from the Council on Competitiveness. Many of those recommendations were then included in the Commerce Committee's hearings and deliberations. So the question is how to take all this information in the Senate where people have lots of different ideas and get it all together into one bill and get it passed. Senator Stevens said: Let's form a joint committee. That is a little harder to do than before. Senator Inouye once served on a joint committee--well, it was a special committee in the Watergate days, but there are not that many around here because we have our own committees. What happened was our senior Members of the Senate, such as Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy, Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman, just by the force of their own personalities worked together to create an environment with the help of a lot of staff members to say: Let's take all of these ideas and let's work in a genuinely bipartisan way. We then had a Republican Congress last year. Senator Domenici, who will be here a little later this afternoon, was chairman of the Energy Committee. He went to the White House to talk with the President about this issue. He invited me to go with him, but he didn't just invite me, he invited Senator Bingaman, his ranking Democrat, to go with him. So all the way we have worked together on this legislation. Then we sat down shortly after this report came out, which I suppose was in 2005 in the fall, and had a series of what we call homework sessions. We invited representatives from the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Education, the President's science adviser, and a whole variety of other people within the administration who were already working on these subjects to get their advice about these ideas and other ideas as we formed legislation. That is the kind of input this legislation has had. Finally, Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman introduced what we call the PACE Act, Protect America's Competitive Edge Act. Symbolically, it had 70 cosponsors in the Senate--34 Republicans and 35 Democrats. So we have gotten to the beginning of 2006. I will say a little bit more in a moment about exactly what was in that legislation, but let me continue with the process because it is fairly remarkable and helped to produce this legislation which I found in rereading it over the weekend is remarkably coherent. It is in plain English. It is organized by sections. I could understand virtually every section. I have been reading it as we went along. Maybe this is a model for other complex legislation we have in the Senate. The President, in his State of the Union Address in 2006, and again this year, put the issue front and center with what he called his American competitiveness agenda. The President included $6 billion in his budget for just the first year. In March of last year, the Energy Committee reported eight provisions related to energy research and math and science education for students and teachers in association with the National Labs. So eight provisions of the Augustine report were reported out by the Energy Committee. Then in May the Commerce Committee reported a bill that included ideas from the Augustine report, as well as the President's Council on Competitiveness. We had it from two committees. Then the immigration bill passed the Senate. The immigration bill didn't finally become law, but it passed the [[Page 9610]] Senate with pretty big numbers, and included within it were three provisions that tackled some of the most archaic provisions in our immigration laws, those provisions which basically prevent our insourcing of brain power. We have more than 500,000 foreign students who come here every year to study. They include some of the brightest people in the world, and we make them swear before they come that they will go home when, in fact, we should want most of them to stay here and create jobs for us so we can keep our standard of living. So three provisions from the Augustine report were in that immigration bill that passed the Senate last year, and it is my hope that when the Senate takes up immigration legislation before Memorial Day, which the majority leader has said we are likely to do, that legislation will, again, have the provisions from the Augustine report and other recommendations that will make it easier to attract and keep in our country the brightest men and women from around the world. If they are going to create good jobs somewhere, let's create them in the United States for Americans to have. The Defense authorization bill included a provision related to support for early career researchers funded by the Pentagon. There are so many good applications from so many talented people in the United States for basic research or even applied research that the investigators, as they are called, are sometimes in their forties before they win their first grant. That is discouraging to many of the brightest young minds in the United States. These recommendations have sought to include changes, and the Defense authorization bill last year took a step in that direction. One of the major recommendations of both of the reports I just mentioned was making permanent the research and development tax credit so that our brightest manufacturing jobs can stay here rather than be created overseas. In the so-called tax extender last year, the tax credit was temporarily extended, and so that was dealt with last year. Last year, just before Senators went home for the elections in October, the two leaders, Senator Frist then the majority leader, and Senator Reid then the Democratic leader, introduced a package--it was numbered S. 3936-- that included the work of the Energy and Commerce Committees and added an education component to improve our children's knowledge of math, science, and critical foreign languages. That bipartisan product was the work of the chairman and ranking members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Commerce and Energy Committees. We tried to be good stewards of the public money as we went through this process. That working group last year trimmed $3 billion from what the committees passed in order to make it more affordable. We did our best to stay close to the President's budget number, although we slightly exceeded that number. This year, to bring us to where we are today, the majority leader, Senator Reid, and Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, took that bill, the one introduced last year by Senator Frist and Senator Reid, and reintroduced it by removing authorizations for 2007 since we have already finished work on 2007 and are looking ahead to 2008. That is the bill we are considering today, the America COMPETES Act. That is a long train ride. To those who may be outside the Senate, they may think that is unnecessarily complex. We didn't really need to know all that. I think it is important for the American people to know all that. It is especially important for Senators and their staffs to know all that because virtually every Member of the Senate has had 2 years to get their say. I know on the Commerce Committee there have been long meetings of members of both sides. I know that is true with the staff meetings. Not all would write every provision of the bill the way it is, but that is the nature of work in the Senate. It is a very good piece of legislation. It may be improved on the Senate floor by amendment, but it has been a long and good process. Mr. INOUYE. Will the Senator yield? Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield. Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Alexander, for his broad and very intricate history of the bipartisanship. If all of us in this body followed this process on all major legislation, this would be a historic session, and I hope it is so. This will be one of the first I can look back to and say we tried and we succeeded. And I think we are going to succeed. I thank the Senator from Tennessee very much. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. His example with Senator Stevens is a good example for all of us. I hope he is right. The American people know we all have our principles, and we have our politics. They know that. But I believe they also know there are some issues that are simply too big for one party to solve, whether it is Iraq, whether it is immigration, whether it is energy independence, whether it is affordable health care. And one of those issues is how do we keep our brain power advantage so we can keep our jobs from going overseas to India and China. It will take a comprehensive approach. We take for granted sometimes that we produce 30 percent of all the money in the world for 5 percent of the people. That is one of my favorite statistics. If I were a citizen of China or of India and I was looking at the United States and I saw that disproportionately our wealth comes from our brain power, I would be encouraged because many of the brightest people in the world are in China and in India, wonderful researchers, wonderful scientists. There is no reason in the world that they cannot use that great resource they have to improve their standard of living, and they are setting about to do it. If the Senator from Hawaii has no objection, I thought I might talk a little about what is in the bill, just to go over it. As I said, for those who like to read whole bills, it is 208 pages, but any contractor will tell you that it is cheaper to start from scratch in building a house sometimes than remodeling it. I think we may have found something here working together in a bipartisan way. In starting from scratch, we actually may have produced a better organized bill, more straightforward than trying to remodel a lot of existing laws. But here is what we sought to do. Based upon these recommendations, this legislation doubles funding for the National Science Foundation over 5 years. Now, this is the work of Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens and their committee. This is merely an authorization bill--it doesn't appropriate a penny, but it has to be within the budget. Senator Bingaman offered an amendment, which I joined in with during our budget discussion, and it created room in the budget, nearly $1 billion of room in the budget, for the first year appropriations of the America COMPETES Act. So these dollars are within the budget, and I will talk a little more about the dollars a little later. I might say one thing about the dollars. The dollars are an additional $16 billion in spending over the next 4 years. That is real money. But we might remember on what else we spend money. That is about 2 months of the war in Iraq. We spend about $8 billion a month on the war in Iraq. We spent $237 billion on debt last year, $378 billion on Medicare, $545 on Social Security, and $100 billion or so on hurricanes. These are all very important priorities, but somehow we have to put gas in the engine, and the gas in the engine is our brain power advantage. We have to invest in research, education--K-12--in order to keep the advantage that creates the dollars that pay these bills for our most important programs. But we have worked hard. We have worked hard to have fiscal discipline. The $16 billion over the next 4 years that this bill would authorize to spend, and which is within the budget for this year, is a significant savings over the original legislation last year. More than $3 billion over the 4 years in authorized funding has been cut from last year's competitiveness bills passed by the Energy and Commerce Committees. [[Page 9611]] We also worked hard to avoid duplicative undergraduate scholarship programs that were proposed in earlier legislation, and it reduced the cost of a number of other proposed and existing programs. For example, the Robert Noyse scholarship program of the National Science Foundation was very similar to a recommendation of the Augustine report. So after discussions with the National Science Foundation in our homework sessions, we thought, well, why create a new duplicative program when we already have a good one. So we simply sought to expand it. With regard to the education and energy portions of the bill, the total cost closely tracks the President's proposed American Competitive Initiative. Remember, he put in $6 billion in his budget last year. The President has proposed over 10 years doubling research funding at the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science. The cost of the commerce portion of this legislation is a bit higher, but that is because Chairman Inouye and Cochairman Stevens agreed last year that they wanted to double the National Science Foundation's funding at a faster rate, of about 5 years rather than 10. So I would argue that this is progrowth legislation and a small price to pay for that growth in our standard of living. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Hawaii that any time he would like to interrupt my presentation, I hope he will. Some of the specific provisions are the doubling of funding for the National Science Foundation, I just mentioned, from $5.6 billion in the current year to $11.2 billion in 2011. Before I arrived, the Congress doubled funding for the National Institutes of Health with a great payoff, most people felt, in terms of our health and research for cures for diseases. But we did not do as good a job during that period of time on the physical sciences, which are also important to the health sciences. This, hopefully, will begin to change that. Second, setting the Department of Energy's Office of Science on track to double in funding over 10 years, and increasing from $3.6 billion in the current year to $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2011; establishing the innovation acceleration research program, which will direct Federal agencies funding research and science and technology to set as a goal dedicating approximately 8 percent of their research and development budgets toward high-risk frontier research. This was a recommendation of both of the major organizations, the Augustine committee and the Council on Competitiveness. What this means is that there are so many good proposals before the peer review and merit review groups that give out basic research grants that they obviously tend to be a little more conservative when presented with so many good ideas. The disadvantage of that is that it reduces the impulse to take a few risks, to roll the dice, or to try some idea that has less of a chance of succeeding but might be the next Google or the next hybrid or the next Internet or the next stealth invention. So this legislation encourages all through the America COMPETES Act in virtually every section that we fund, the idea of setting as a goal--not a mandate but as a goal--8 percent of the research and development budget toward this high-risk frontier research. Next, it authorizes bringing the National Institute of Standards and Technology up from $703 million next year to $937 million in fiscal year 2011. It would direct NASA to increase funding for basic research. It will authorize coordinating ocean and atmospheric research and education at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies to promote U.S. leadership in these important fields. This has been a major priority of Senator Inouye, as well as others. The Augustine committee, at our request, was asked to give us some priorities and not just give us a random list. And I might say, when they gave us 20 recommendations instead of 10, and they gave them in priority, they didn't just go out and get the first 20 they heard about. Over the summer, the working group of 21 members--and I am sure the Council on Competitiveness did the same--considered hundreds of ideas. So our leading scientists and the people we asked to give us their best advice on science and their best advice on medicine and their best advice on engineering, they waded through dozens and dozens of operating programs and other ideas and gave us just a handful of the best ideas. This has been a tremendously important screening process. I believe one reason this has been so broadly accepted in the Senate and by those outside the Senate is that it is not just one Senator's idea of what is a great math program or another's best friend's idea of a good research program. This is, in effect, a merit-based, peer-reviewed set of recommendations and an answer to the question as to what are the most important things we can do to keep our brain power advantage. So, No. 1, authorizing competitive grants to States to better align elementary and secondary education with knowledge and skills needed for success in colleges and universities and the Armed Forces. Now, what that means in plain English is to make sure our elementary, middle, and high schools are teaching what students need in order to go to college, to go to work, and to go to the Armed Forces. That is the key. Next, strengthen the skills of thousands of math and science teachers by establishing training and educational programs at summer institutes hosted by the National Laboratories, and increasing support for the teacher institutes at the National Science Foundation's institutes. One Senator said to me the other day: This is new, isn't it, the idea of giving the National Laboratories such a specific role in training outstanding math and science teachers and inspiring math and science students to learn and achieve more in math and science? The answer is, yes, it is new. But the feeling of the Augustine commission and others is that we have a crisis in math and science. And that is not too strong a word. The former Governor of North Carolina, Jim Hunt, told me the University of North Carolina only graduated three physics teachers in a recent year from its college of education. So we are not going to learn much physics if we don't have anybody teaching much physics. So why not take advantage of these remarkable National Laboratories we have around the country. I guess there are about two dozen or so of them, like the Oak Ridge Laboratory in the State of Tennessee, but there is also Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. They are all around the country. If you are going to inspire a student or inspire a teacher to be active in math and science, why not place them in an environment for 4 weeks in the summer with some of the finest math and science researchers and individuals in the United States? It would be a choice for a young musician--give them a choice whether to be on the road with Johnny Cash or be in the business office at the Grand Ole Opry, and they will go on the road every time because that is how a singer learns to be a singer. And that is how a student learns what they can do with math and the joy of mathematics. When I was Governor of Tennessee we created summer academies--we called them the Governor's schools--for outstanding students and teachers of various subjects. About 20 States have done the same thing. We have found it is the best money we ever spent to offer 4 weeks at the University of Tennessee connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for 200 of the most outstanding high school juniors interested in science and math. The teachers love to teach them, the students love to come. Instead of becoming a nerd in their rural school, suddenly they are with 200 peers, and they are all celebrated for their academic achievements. Why not use these National Laboratories to our advantage? No other country in the world has the National Laboratories that we have. One thing they can do is to help inspire the next generation of math and science students and improve this generation and the next generation of math and science teachers. [[Page 9612]] So expanding the Robert Noyse teaching scholarship program at the National Science Foundation--this is a very fine program at the National Science Foundation which has had for a long time a role in education as well as research. This program trains individuals to become math and science teachers in high-need local education agencies. Assisting States in establishing or expanding statewide specialty schools in math and science. Now, I don't know whether the State of Virginia or the State of Hawaii has a full-time residential school in science and math. I know the State of North Carolina does, and I went to see it. Governor Jim Hunt set it up. I went to see it when I was Governor. We didn't believe we had enough money to create one in Tennessee, so we created those summer academies about which I just spoke. But Governor Bredesen, our current Democratic Governor of Tennessee, wants to start, and has made a very small start, of what we call in the legislation a specialty school in math and science, and several other States have followed North Carolina's example. This would help States up to about a 50-percent level. All the rest of the money would have to be private, State, or local. Establish schools like the North Carolina residential high school for math and science. Not only will it give gifted students a greater knowledge, but it helps us compete with the world. North Carolina has felt as though over the last 20 years it has helped keep many of those bright students in North Carolina because if they go there to school, they may go there to college, or at least they may come back if they go somewhere else, and then they create more jobs and build up that economy. Facilitating the expansion of advanced placement in international baccalaureate programs by increasing the number of teachers prepared to teach those courses and foreign language courses. The AP courses, advanced placement courses, are a ticket to success. College entrance examiners read them carefully. If you get a 4 or a 5--those are the highest grades in math or science--or if you take several of them, your chances of being admitted to a variety of institutions are increased. But they are offered to a very limited number of the students--not limited by their brains but limited by their money. They either do not have the money to pay for the tests or they do not go to the schools where there are enough teachers who are trained to teach in the preparation for their tests. This builds on a program in Houston, TX, which has been very successful in the last 10 years, of expanding the opportunities for low-income students to take more advanced placement courses to prepare for college and also to train teachers to meet that demand. Senator Hutchison and Senator Bingaman have been two of the leaders in this for 10 years in the Senate. There are a variety of other proposals. Adopting another program from Texas, the You Teach program--this wasn't sent over from the White House although this is two straight Texas programs; this is from the National Academy of Sciences, because they have a terrific program at the University of Texas at Austin, where they take students who are enrolled in chemistry and recruit them into the College of Education with an attractive scholarship and then the idea was to pay them $10,000 a year to teach at a high-needs school for 5 years after they leave. In other words, they get the people into teaching and they will put them in the schools where they are needed the most. That is called the You Teach program. It would expand that. There was a program from the University of Pennsylvania which would take teachers who are now teaching and give them intensive summer training and improve their ability to teach math and science, all toward the same objectives. Then the President proposed Math Now grants, improving the teaching of mathematics in the elementary and middle schools. That is in here as well, after it went through the process. Then we expand the programs to increase the number of students who study critical foreign languages and become proficient. That was recognized here for a variety of reasons as a part of keeping our brain power advantage. Finally, there are a number of proposals that would identify continuing organizations within the White House and Cabinet councils and other studies to try to keep a spotlight on this subject. This is not the whole answer to the book ``The World Is Flat.'' It is on the same subject. It is part of the answer. It is a good start. In fact, it is a very good beginning. But we need to continue this attention to our position in competitiveness. What I have tried to review here is how this legislation came to the floor, why it has attracted this unusual leadership from the majority leader and Republican leader, why it has had such a sense of urgency from senior leaders such as Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and others, why today it has 56 sponsors, why the House of Representatives is considering legislation on a parallel track, and why I believe there is no more important piece of legislation that will come before us in this session of Congress. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 904, withdrawn Mr. INOUYE.

The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the amendment, the managers' package the Senator from Hawaii has proposed. I wish to make two points about it. The first is it reduces the cost of the bill by $280 million over 4 years. That is important to all of us and it is especially important to some of us. We are trying to spend money wisely. At the same time, there are significant increases in the National Science Foundation education programs--about $300 million, in fact, over the President's requested level. But it is important that we know what these are. They are directly in line with the recommendations of the Augustine report and the Council on Competitiveness. Remember, we asked them to put these recommendations in priority order. The first thing is not the R&D tax credit, it is not bringing in more foreign students--it is not. The first thing was kindergarten through 12th grade math and science education. That is where our academies believed we had the biggest problem. So this new money for education programs in the National Science Foundation goes to graduate research fellows, to graduate education, research traineeships for a program called Professional Science Masters. This is a program where colleges are helping students earn master's degrees, not necessarily with the goal of going on to a Ph.D., but a master's degree that might take you on into a highly technical field in business; in other words, making us more competitive. It includes the Robert Noyce scholarships, which were expanded to help train more math and science teachers, and the teachers institutes in the summer. These programs are education programs of the National Science Foundation, but we save $280 million over 4 years, and we have directed those toward nonduplicative programs that are consistent with the commission reports. I wonder if, before Senator Domenici speaks, I could say a word. Senator Domenici is here. He is going to speak now. I am going to step to the side while he does. But I wish to say a word about Senator Domenici's crucial role. I have already spoken to the fact that without the sense of urgency of Senators Inouye and Stevens, we would never have gotten to this point. But Senator Domenici was there at the beginning of this work. Even though, in our caucus, only one Senator is more senior, he stepped back and created an environment so Senator Bingaman and I and many other Senators could work on this. He watched it very carefully, he supervised it, he chaired it, but he left room for us, many of us, to work on this. When it came time to go to the White House, it was Senator Domenici who asked the President if we could come see him. It was Senator Domenici who, rather than go down by himself as a Senator might have done, invited his junior colleague, me, to go with him. But more important than that, he invited his senior colleague, the Democratic Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to go. It was Senator Domenici who insisted in the Energy and Commerce Committee he chaired that all this work be done in a bipartisan way. So because of that and the way Senators Stevens and Inouye work, we were able to do this. It was a Domenici-Bingaman piece of legislation called the Protect America's Competitiveness Act that was introduced last year with 70 sponsors, 35 Democrats and 35 Republicans. So before, Senator Domenici came, I thanked and saluted other Senators whose leadership has made a difference. But no one has been more responsible for this piece of legislation coming through. Now that the assistant Democratic leader is here, I want to use this occasion to say how much I, and many of us, appreciate the way he and the majority leader have handled this piece of legislation; created an environment in which we have it on the floor in a way it can succeed. Senator Durbin, the Presiding Officer, has been a strong supporter of this legislation and a cosponsor of it from the beginning. I also wanted to recognize that. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from New Mexico is recognized. Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is now over 60 years ago that a brilliant, charismatic man arrived on the scene in my home State of New Mexico. He cut an odd figure and began a strange recruiting effort for a secret project at an undisclosed location for an undetermined period of time. Who was this man and what was the upshot? His name was J. Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant and charismatic American physicist. We all know something of him, and we might have different views, one from another. But he was collecting the best scientific minds of his time worldwide, not just Americans, for he had the Fermis from Italy, husband and wife. Some say, as they assessed the brilliance of the team, Enrico Fermi led the pack. I don't know which; it was 60 years ago. But I do know they were asked and recruited by Mr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. He was collecting the minds and taking them on a mysterious journey to a remote mesa in New Mexico. The task was to develop the first atomic bomb. The collective scientific brain power of the Manhattan Project, and the awesome power it produced, would change the world forever. The scientists at Los Alamos ushered in a new era. Their sacrifice and their ingenuity created a story for the ages. More specifically, their legacy for us is to consider today, and is to find out that there is great value in an awesome power of science and mathematics education. That is what brings me to the Senate floor, and that is why I rise in strong support of this bill under consideration. Today is a great day. Today the Senate begins a process of rising above the gathering storm. Let's hope. Let's hope. Those words, ``Rising Above The Gathering Storm,'' are part of the title of the National Academy of Science report released in 2005 on American future competitiveness and standard of living of our people. The report was written by a distinguished group chaired by a former Lockheed chairman, chief executive officer Norm Augustine. Mr. Augustine's committee included three Nobel laureates, presidents of leading American universities, including then Texas A&M president and current Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, and the chief executive officers of corporations with global reach. After an intensive 10 weeks, the committee presented a significant challenge to our Nation. The findings of the ``Gathering Storm'' report and the 20 communications within tell us one thing above all else: America is not doing enough to harness and develop its national brain power. Yes, that is a strange thing to say. We are not doing [[Page 9614]] enough to harness and develop our national brain power. Today we are here to begin to remedy this problem and to meet the challenge set forth in the report. I am so grateful that even after 34 years in the Senate I can find an issue such as this to get excited about. I can find an issue such as this that Senators from both sides of the aisle can get excited about. They do not talk about their parties when we have these meetings. Most interesting. Maybe they go back to their rooms and talk about the Democratic party, how it can use this report, or the Republican party. They talk about America's brain power is on the wane, meaning that, believe it or not, we can do something about it. That is a nice observation. We can do something about the waning brain power of America; meaning these young kids, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 years of age, have within them the same collective brain power that was present when Oppenheimer went looking for the best. It was not just assumed that there were smart people; they knew there were people with brain power. Right? They just didn't have them in place. They were scattered about. Fermi was over here, some guys were over in Eastern Europe, and a bunch of them were over on the West Coast. But somebody had to put them together. They collected brain power that unlocked the atomic bomb. Now, we are not going to do that. What we are trying to do is look back and say, how do we do the things that experts tell us will, in fact, increase the brain power of our people. It is there the same as it is in China. They are just producing more. Does it mean they have more? No, it does not. It means they have decided it is the greatest thing for them, so they are educating more and more and more. So is India. We are sitting over here with all of the greatest institutions to do the educating, but we do not have--it has not been coalesced even around the essence of a plan that has, as its goal, brain power collection, brain power enhancement; brain power is on the wane. Let's build it back. That is what we are trying to do. Today, we begin to remedy the problem and meet the challenges set forth in the report called the ``Gathering Storm.'' It tells us in a few pages why it is a storm. It tells us in a few pages why it is a gathering storm. It tells us in a few pages that we are actually selling ourselves short. It tells us if we do not decide to build this brain power back, we are going to lose. We are going to lose a war which some of us do not even know we are fighting. We are going to lose the war for brain power equality and we do not even know we are fighting. This ``Gathering Storm'' report identifies the two challenges linked to scientific and engineering excellence: first, creating high quality jobs for the American people, and, secondly, responding to America's need for clean, affordable, and reliable energy. The report was aimed at enhancing our Nation's human financial knowledge and capital to ensure our prosperity. It addressed increasing America's talent pool by vastly improving science and mathematics education in kindergarten through grade 12. The report, ``Gathering Storm,'' called for significant advances in science and engineering programs in our Nation's higher education, improving our economic policy, from intellectual property protection to research and development tax credits and tax incentives for U.S.-based innovation. The report also provides us with some worrisome indicators. The following few facts should sound alarm bells throughout this Chamber and this Nation. I trust people will listen. Senators have participated from both sides of the aisle, from all vintages. Some are young, some have just come, they are excited, some have been here a long time. I am not going to say such as the Senator from New Mexico, I am going to say such as the Senator from Hawaii, and he is enthused. Some have been even here as long as the Senator from Alaska, and that is a long time, longer than me, and he is excited. Right? What it means is if you put the right plate in front of us, we can get excited about doing something for our great country. This report provided us with some worrisome indicators. I am going to tell you about them in a minute. In 2001, U.S. industries spent more on tort litigation than research and development. Look at that. That is not happening to our competitors, I tell you. If we want people over here to say, well, there is some good to that, we are gaining something on that, well, we will have an awfully long dialog on the floor on that one fact. Are we gaining that much benefit for the American people out of our tort system, as we are when we say that costs us as much in dollars? It says here: Industry spent more on litigation than it did on research and development. Chemical companies closed 70 facilities around the United States in 2004. I might say to my friend, of the 120 chemical companies being built at the time of the release of the Augustine report with a price tag of $1 billion or more, 1 was in the United States and 50 were in China. Got it? Those are chemical plants. People say: Oh, chemical plants; bad stuff. We are not talking about chemical plants, bad stuff. We are talking about chemical plants where you use the chemical product for all kinds of things that make you a strong nation, that make things for people to use in their house, that make things you can use outdoors. The chemical plants are an evidence of basic industry, and America built 1, China built 50. That is pretty startling, is it not? Of the nearly 1.1 million U.S. high school seniors who took the college entrance exam in 2002, less than 6 percent had plans to study engineering. That is a 33-percent decrease from 10 years earlier. Pretty big stuff. Meanwhile, more than 50 percent of the U.S. science and engineering workforce is approaching retirement. Startling. Now, Senators, these statistics show that the challenge to our Nation's standard of living is before us and the Senate must act. I am proud to join this bipartisan group of Senators introducing the America COMPETES Act of 2007, commonly referred to as the competitiveness bill. Through this legislation, we are addressing nearly every one of the recommendations made by this significant report. Enacting this bill will be a culmination of a remarkable cooperative effort, with work cutting across three Senate committees, and with valuable contributions from a large number of colleagues in the Senate. This bill has the support of both leaders in the Senate and the collective support of our Nation's boardrooms, classrooms, and laboratories. I will speak briefly about the area of the bill over which the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has jurisdiction. We know that following through on recommendations of the Augustine Commission will require new commitments and participation from several Federal agencies. The Department of Energy has a major role to play in meeting this challenge. This legislation doubles funding for the Office of Science over the next decade--that is healthy and hearty, and many will look forward to it with great enthusiasm--the largest source of Federal support for basic science in the physical sciences. The President called for the increase in announcing his American Competitiveness Initiative last year. The Augustine report stressed the importance of increasing our national commitment to basic research in the physical sciences. The America COMPETES Act responds by putting the Department of Energy Office of Science on a path to double in funding over the next decade. As the largest Federal funder of basic research in the physical sciences, the Office of Science is of critical importance. More than 58 Nobel Prize winners since 1936 have been supported by the Department of Energy at some time in their careers. Eighteen Nobel Prizes have been awarded to Department of Energy laboratory employees and another 13 to researchers who employed the National Laboratory facilities in their award-winning discoveries. Most of the 40 winners of the prestigious Enrico Fermi Presidential awards have [[Page 9615]] done research supported by the Department. A few years ago, we made a commitment to double funding in the National Institutes of Health to support the biological sciences. We made good on that commitment. We said it, and we did it. It is now time that we address the role physical sciences play and stand together to support such growth of key agencies such as the DOE Office of Science. By doing so, we will not be taking away from other Department functions or laboratory resources. In fact, I was cosponsors with Senators Bingaman and Alexander to an amendment in this year's budget resolution. We have a few people who know something about that, too. It is rather tricky, and sometimes you have to do some things you don't quite understand. Then you catch on. But we did put in a billion dollars for new authorizations provided in that budget, so that the legislation we are going to enact will not take money from Peter to pay Paul. We won't be taking money out of the Department of Energy to pay for the new items in the Department of Energy. We would be called down here on the floor, and we would lose. I hope we have done it right so we can prove our point. This bill leverages the tremendous talent and technological investment of our laboratories and its system. These new provisions will build on education and outreach work the labs have undertaken for years. Through this legislation, the national labs will provide opportunities for high school students from across the Nation to gain hands-on experience in science and engineering fields; assist States in establishing specialty schools in math and science; strengthen the skills of thousands of math and science teachers by establishing training and education programs at summer institutes hosted at National Laboratories; establish partnerships between the National Laboratories and local high schools and centers of excellence in math and science. I have spoken quite a bit recently about the importance of engaging China in the challenge of energy security and global climate change. I have written to the President about this important issue. It should be clear to all of us that our energy, environmental, and educational challenges cannot be considered in a bubble; rather, they must be considered in light of global competitiveness, challenges that face us all. To maintain our technological edge, we must improve our educational systems and the research and development we do in corporations, universities, and Government laboratories throughout our Nation. This must lead us to higher brainpower for our people. The challenge is great, like others this Nation has faced. The challenge was great 60 years ago in New Mexico. They were busy trying to put a team together to build the first atomic bomb--can you imagine--from scratch. The idea alone is all they had. They put it together and built it. They found the manpower to do it. We have the manpower. We are just not using it. We are not letting it build itself as required. I commend the authors of the Augustine report. I commend my colleagues for their hard work on this legislation. I am hopeful we will rise above the gathering storm. If we do, people will say: You had a lot to do, maybe more than you thought, but you sought out and found what was most important; that is, taking the gathering storm and making sure it did not end up hurting our great Nation but, rather, was the stimulus for us to increase the collective brainpower of our young people. I yield the floor. Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of a bill that addresses many of the challenges facing Georgia and our Nation during this time of increasing global competitiveness. I am a cosponsor of the America COMPETES Act because it will ensure that the United States will be able to sustain a vigorous economy, an unrivaled national defense, a first-rate health care and education system, a healthy environment, and a hopeful and prosperous future for generations to come. Although the United States has the strongest scientific and technological enterprise in the world, we are now experiencing the slow but steady effects of globalization. These effects, led most notably by modern advances in communications, have made the world a smaller place and have dramatically increased worldwide competition. The leadership in science and technology that the United States has enjoyed since World War II is being seriously threatened by the burgeoning and thriving economies and workforces in countries such as China and India. I believe in order to keep our competitive edge and to maintain our dominance in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, it is imperative we make a long-term investment in our future scientists, professors, and engineers. We can do so by improving science and mathematics education, and by providing schools, universities, and research centers throughout the country with necessary funding. Recently, Microsoft Corporation founder Bill Gates testified before Congress, and he said: The U.S. cannot maintain its economic leadership unless our workforce consists of people who have the knowledge and skills needed to drive innovation. Mr. President, that is a very accurate statement, and that is why we need to pass this bill. With the funding and programs provided for in this bill, it will be easier to educate and grow an innovative workforce that is highly skilled and highly trained. The America COMPETES Act recognizes that better educated students make a smarter, more efficient workforce. And that is an important investment for this Nation. As an example of what funding for science and mathematics education can do, let me tell you about a program that is doing great things in my home State of Georgia. The Georgia Academy of Mathematics, Engineering, and Science, or GAMES, was established at Middle Georgia College in Cochran, GA, during the fall of 1997. GAMES is a residential, joint enrollment program for top-performing high school juniors and seniors. The program allows students to obtain high school and college credits simultaneously while enrolled in full-time college courses. Most students in the GAMES program major in mathematics, science, or engineering. The GAMES program enrollment continues to grow each year and has earned the reputation of an academic alternative for gifted students all across Georgia. Over the 10 years this program has been in existence, students who have been accepted into GAMES have averaged a 3.85 GPA and an SAT score of 1246. After completing the GAMES program, 48 percent of the students enrolled in the program have transferred to the Georgia Institute of Technology. The GAMES program allows these students to earn a firm foundation in science, technology, and physics before entering Georgia Tech. Many GAMES graduates are pursuing and/or have received their Ph.D. in mathematics, science, or engineering. I commend Dr. Richard Federinko, president of Middle Georgia College, and the entire faculty and staff for their hard work in making the GAMES program a major success. GAMES is just one program in one State, and we need more like it throughout the country. This legislation will open the door and perhaps expand these types of programs into other States and allow more bright young people to enter the fields of science, math, and technology. My fellow colleagues, time is of the essence. We can no longer afford to be complacent and just assume the United States will continue to be the world's leading innovator. Without action, our grandchildren face the genuine possibility of living in an America that is not the preeminent leader in scientific and technological advancements. I urge each of you to join me in support of this critical piece of legislation. [[Page 9616]] I want to particularly commend my long-time dear friend, Senator Lamar Alexander from Tennessee, for playing a leading roll in the drafting of this legislation and for working so hard to make sure the policy in this legislation is the right kind of policy to promote science, math, and technology in our schools, not just from the eighth grade forward, from the ninth grade forward, but from kindergarten forward. I say to Senator Alexander, I know he has been ably assisted by Senator Bingaman, as well as others, in a bipartisan way to make sure America's educational system continues to be the preeminent system in the world and that we give these bright minds the opportunity to develop, and that we make sure--from the standpoint of developing engineers in the future, from the standpoint of developing medical researchers in the future, from the standpoint of developing doctors and other types of engineers in that field--we continue to lead the world not just in the production of individuals from a numbers standpoint but in the production of quality individuals to develop technology, to develop our research capability, as well as to make sure from a professional standpoint we have the engineers and the physicians who will continue to lead the world. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his comments but, more importantly, for his leadership. We usually think of Senator Chambliss in terms of leadership on intelligence matters, Armed Services matters, on agricultural matters, where he is the ranking member. But from the very beginning on this legislation, he has been out front. I can remember when Norm Augustine, chairman of the Augustine committee, came to the Senate and had a dinner with us right around the corner. Senator Chambliss was one of the first Senators there. He has been one of the major leaders in this endeavor for the last 2 years. His comments about the Georgia residential high school for math and science illustrates a good way to help take this legislation from the abstract and put it in concrete terms. Section 3171 of this legislation, specialty schools for math and science, will assist States in establishing or expanding such residential high schools for math and science. I spoke a little earlier on the floor about North Carolina's math and science program which they have had for 25 years. Tennessee is a little behind. We haven't had one yet; we have summer governor schools for math and science. This legislation would authorize the Congress to appropriate funds which could pay for up to 50 percent of the cost of operating that school in Georgia which would permit Georgia, if it wished, to expand that school. The Senator cited in his remarks one good reason to do it in addition to the Nation's competitiveness. I think I heard him say 48 percent of the students went to Georgia Tech. So if our goal is to keep bright students at home to create jobs for us in the United States, a more specific goal is to keep bright Georgia students at home so they can create jobs for Georgians. Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question through the Chair. Mr. ALEXANDER. Certainly. Mr. CHAMBLISS. I simply say the Senator is exactly correct; 47 percent of our students do go on to Georgia Tech. I wish we could get more of them at the University of Georgia where they happened to let me go, but at Georgia Tech we are doing a terrific job of taking these bright young minds that are being developed, as we said earlier, not just at the eighth and ninth grade level, but thanks to you and the leadership of folks like you, at a much earlier age. Our GAMES program, incidentally, was put into effect and implemented by our former colleague Senator Zell Miller, when he was the Governor of our State, and somebody whom I know you worked very closely with over the years. It is a great concept. It is forward thinking, as this legislation is very forward thinking from the standpoint of making sure that these great minds are developed at a very early age. Again, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his great work on this and I commend this legislation to all of our colleagues. Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, our former colleague Zell Miller was Lieutenant Governor of Georgia when I was a Governor. He was a professor by profession and he was always interested in education and very skillful in education policy. Every Governor I know spends a lot of time trying to think of how we are going to recruit jobs. Well, if you study it, you learn after a while you don't recruit nearly as many as you grow. The way you grow them is with brain power. So the single best thing any State can do to create the largest number of good new jobs in that State is to keep the brightest kids at home. Governor Miller, when he was there, initiated the HOPE scholarship, which played a major role in attracting many of th"
