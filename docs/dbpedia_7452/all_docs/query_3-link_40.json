        "text": "Symbolic color has been used to deepen the significance of religious rituals and esoteric ceremonies for thousands of years, and certain colors elicit symbolic connections. In the West, white has long associations with purity, black with death, and red with blood. But however universal these symbolic associations may seem, metaphorical connections with color are rooted in culture and apt to change over time.\n\nCultural Connections: What colors are seen in Native American pottery from the Southeast?\n\nNative Americans used color in a variety of media such as baskets, clothing, and rock art. Red, white, and black make up the three most common colors in pottery from the Southeast. Red was of particular interest to Native Americans from this region, and it was accessible and easy to use. Color combinations which archeologists call “Nodena Red and White” and “Carson Red on Buff” were also of frequently used. Early potters knew how to repeatedly bring about a desired effect, and they mastered firing methods to produce certain color outcomes. This bowl’s buff color is the result of the manipulation of paste, heat, and oxygen during the firing process. Visible chipped areas on the bowl provide evidence that its clay core is charcoal gray (an indicator that the bowl was fired at a low temperature). By contrast, the bowl’s outer surface is buff, a result of its direct exposure to heat. Essentially—fire—along with an oxygen-rich environment, cleaned this bowl’s outer surface of its organic residues, transforming it from dark gray to a warm buff. The interior of this bowl has a motif comprised of nested “U” shaped bands alternating in red slip and buff surface. The surface was scraped to accentuate the red slip and create a cameo effect. This motif is repeated twice and linked to a red slipped band on the inside of the rim. The people who made this bowl are from a community who also created rock art in the hills overlooking the Arkansas River.\n\nEffigy bottle or “head pot”\n\nPossibly made by an ancestor of the modern Quapaw Tribe\n\nCarden Bottoms, Yell County, AR\n\n1350-1600 AD\n\nCarson Red on Buff\n\nShell-tempered earthenware and mineral slip\n\n8 ¼ x 23 ½ in.\n\nUniversity of Arkansas Museum Collections\n\nCultural Connections: Who did this red-faced effigy represent?\n\nNative American effigy vessels in the form of plants, animals, and people have been found at sites along the Mississippi River to our east and near the banks of the Arkansas River in the central part of the state. Effigies carry symbolism that archeologists continue to investigate. Bottles depicting the human head are often called head pots, and scholars have long speculated about these decorative vessels and the people they represented. It is not possible to say with certainty if they depicted friends or enemies of the maker.\n\nOne explanation goes beyond the literal to suggest that head pots may represent a mythical being known as Red Horn, or “He Who Wears Human Heads As Earrings,” a culture hero and part of a great epic narrative. A culture hero is a mythological character who changes the world through inventions and discoveries. Recent archaeological studies show that some motifs appear across many media, including pottery vessels, rock art, engraved shells, woven baskets, and embossed copper. Archeologists posit a connection between motifs on pottery and those seen in rock art at nearby sites. Rock art found in Arkansas includes at least one example (the “head taker” pictograph) of a human-like being carrying an object that may have been a head. It is possible that this pictograph represents an episode from the epic narrative of Red Horn or a similar mythical being. The repetition of symbols across media and throughout the landscape demonstrates that the use of motifs was not haphazard but intentional and meaningful.\n\nFrock coat\n\nMaker unknown\n\nOwned by Captain Berna Blue\n\nca. 1861-1865\n\nAtlanta, Georgia\n\nWool\n\n34 ½ x 15 in.\n\nAccession No: 2008.9\n\nArkansas Natural and Cultural Resources Council Grant Purchase\n\nCultural Connections: Why is Captain Berna Blue’s uniform different from Colonel Williams’ uniform?\n\nAt the onset of the Civil War, many men arrived for war in bright, colorful costumes, but their dress made them easy targets. Even the officers’ golden lace and double-breasted buttons stood out in battle. As casualties mounted, the Confederate Adjutant and Inspector General’s Office issued General Order No. 9, on June 6, 1861, which laid out the proper “Uniform and Dress of the [Confederate] Army.” In this order, officers were ordered to wear “a tunic of gray cloth, known as cadet gray.” Cadet gray was a gray containing a heavy sea-blue pigment with a white thread cross-section. As the war progressed and it became increasingly difficult for the Confederacy to supply uniforms to its troops, men would simply dye whatever clothes they had gray or brown using nuts, leaves, and tree bark, a color that came to be known as butternut.\n\nThis hand-stitched Confederate uniform belonged to Captain Berna Blue of Marmaduke’s 18th Arkansas Infantry. A special button hole attached the empty sleeve to the front of his uniform, as Blue’s right arm was amputated after suffering a wound during General Bragg's invasion of Kentucky in 1862. The coat’s material is wool, dyed the standard cadet gray. This uniform was most likely made in a factory in Atlanta, Georgia, after Blue’s exchange as a prisoner of war.\n\nJames Harrison Williams (1813-1892)\n\nSamuel Shaver (1816-1878)\n\nArkansas1861-1862\n\nOil on canvas\n\n44 x 36 ¼ in.\n\nAccession No: 91.91.1\n\nGift of David and Margaret England\n\nCultural Connections: Why is James Harrison Williams wearing a blue uniform?\n\nAt the outset of the Civil War, volunteers reported for duty dressed in state militia garb or other military costume that represented the full spectrum in color and in style. Many wore what they brought from home, ranging from vivid holiday uniforms with contrasting colors and local militia gear to older United States blue uniforms. Since many soldiers and officers had homespun, instead of factory-made, uniforms, colors often differed even amongst men in the same regiment. The Confederate States gray, a steel blue color, was deemed the “ideal” gray by the government, but the color was eventually only used by officers. Other soldiers wore cadet gray or butternut colored uniforms.\n\nThis portrait of James Harrison Williams depicts the colonel of the 3rd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment in what was probably his first uniform during the war. By April 17th, 1861, months before the CSA government issued uniform orders, the 3rd SC reported for duty in Columbia, South Carolina, with Colonel Williams as their elected leader. While the date of this portrait is unknown, it depicts Williams donning his colonel’s uniform, with buttons featuring the South Carolina coat of arms up and down the breast. This jacket was painted a deeper blue than the standard cadet gray color.\n\nMasonic apron\n\nBelonging to George Alphonso Worthen (1816-1864)\n\nMaker unknown\n\nLikely Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nca. 1850\n\nPaint on silk with cotton backing\n\n19 ½ x 17 ½ in.\n\nAccession No: 2016.32.1\n\nGift of Bill Worthen\n\nCultural Connections: What is the most important color on this Masonic apron?\n\nThe ritual apron is the badge of a Freemason, the piece of regalia most essential to the individual Mason’s practice. Free masonry is not a religion, but rather a 300 year-old fraternal organization that teaches a system of ethics and self-improvement. The virtues of Free masonry are illustrated by symbols and veiled in allegory, but their superficial meanings are accessible through hundreds of books published on the subject. Many Masonic symbols illustrate moral interpretations of the stone mason’s traditional tools; the ritual apron is adapted from the full-length leather aprons worn by literal or operative masons, the historical builders of stone structures. Members of the modern fraternity are generally speculative Masons who are charged with building spiritual rather than literal edifices.\n\nThroughout the centuries, white remained the most significant color on the Masonic apron, symbolizing purity of life and reminding its wearer to conduct himself with dignity. By 1800, many ritual aprons were embellished with Masonic symbols; early examples were often hand-painted or embroidered, and eventually printed versions were available, which could then be hand-colored. George A. Worthen’s apron is based very closely on the Masters Carpet design produced by engraver Amos Dolittle for Jeremy Cross’s 1820 publication, The True Masonic Chart, or Heiroglyphic Monitor, a guidebook to the non-secret practices of the brotherhood. The design on this apron was probably printed using a plate based on Amos Dolittle’s original engraving, then hand-painted using moist pan watercolors, which were available in Little Rock from purveyors of stationery like William E. Woodruff at the Gazette office as early as 1836.\n\nUntitled, Woman in a Yellow Dress\n\nJenny Eakin Delony (1866-1949)\n\nParis or New York City\n\nca. 1890\n\nOil on canvas\n\n29 ½ x 23 ½ in.\n\nAccession No: 95.79.1\n\nGift of Irene Morse, Diane Vibhakar, and Len Delony\n\nCultural Connections: What is the meaning of the color yellow in this painting?\n\nIn Western cultures, yellow is frequently associated with happiness and the warmth of the sun, but just as often the color can suggest scandal, sickness, and fear. The last decade of the 19th century was known as the “Yellow Nineties,” an allusion to the yellow covers of salacious French novels. Stodgy Victorian attitudes began to loosen in favor of the French avant-garde; Van Gogh’s Sunflowers blossomed, and one of the era’s most famous writers, Oscar Wilde, was jailed for indecency.\n\nIn his 1870 ladies manual, Color in Dress, George Audsley declared yellow as the color most closely associated with light, and said its effect on the mind was cheerful and bright. By the end of the century, shades of creamy butter and electric lemon became popular color choices for morning and day dresses, evening gowns, and seaside attire.The subject of this portrait is dressed in yellow silk with daffodils tucked into her hair, suggesting the arrival of spring. Her short bangs and a hint of rouge and lipstick indicate a very on-trend ensemble. Despite the availability of a variety of pigments by the end of the 19th century, Arkansas artist Jenny Delony limited her palette to a few tones, expertly working them into warm, subtle shades. A green earth background complements the creamy peach and pink tones in the young woman’s face, while the radiant yellow color of her dress appears to light the painting from within.\n\nAmong fashion’s enduring traits are a tendency toward the irrational, a penchant for whimsy, and sometimes even a hint of danger. Until the invention of synthetic dyes, bright, colorfast hues were sought after due to their scarcity in the natural world. Color combinations that would be condemned by contemporary eyes as gaudy or garish were embraced by Colonial and Victorian Americans in their choices for apparel and home décor.\n\nBandbox\n\nMaker unknown\n\nAmerican\n\n1815-1830\n\nPasteboard (thin cardboard)\n\n11 ½ x 16 x 13 in.\n\nAccession No: 2017.51.2\n\nGift of Suzanne Hamilton\n\nTastemakers and Trends: What is chinoiserie?\n\nChinoiserie comes from the French word, chinois, for Chinese. The term perfectly illustrates how this design style did not come directly from Asia, but rather is a European interpretation of Asian culture and design. The style originated in the 17th century, at the height of European trade with China and other Asian countries. However, trade with the East could not keep up with the demands of the market, so Western designers created their own “chinois” - inspired pieces. Since these were Westerners’ interpretations of Asian aesthetics, sometimes their own cultural fantasies blended with Asian compositions. This bandbox, a cardboard box used to carry hats and other materials, is a wonderful example of this cultural fusion. At first glance, the hunting scene on the bandbox’s surfaces imulates an Asian print, but a closer look reveals a mix of “foreign” cultures that the American creator simply cobbled together. The scene depicts a classic fox hunt, but the riders are Native Americans shooting bows and arrows instead of upper-class Westerners shooting rifles. These seemingly out-of-place hunters add to the exotic feel of the scene, as does the parrot depicted on the box’s lid.\n\nBlue tureen\n\nProbably made by the Moustier s potters\n\nFrance\n\nca. 1745\n\nTin-glazed earthenware\n\n10 x 9 ¼ x 13 ½ x\n\nAccession No: 2003.27\n\nArkansas Natural and Cultural Resources Council Grant Purchase\n\nTastemakers and Trends: What inspired the designs of French faience?\n\nAfter Louis XIV banned silver and gold tableware in France in 1672—reserving precious metals for the state treasury to pay for his wars—the French pottery industry subsequently blossomed due to a need for new tableware. To replace the grand tableware of old, faience pottery pieces flooded aristocratic and provincial tables alike. Faience refers to tin-glazed earthenware.\n\nNaturally, since the height of faience pottery was prompted by the seemingly overnight replacement of silver tableware, it makes sense that this new ceramic tableware would mimic the existing popular silver forms. Coinciding with the increasing popularity of Asian porcelain imports, which were too expensive for even most of France’s nobility, French potters decorated their pieces to mimic Asian porcelain in both color (white and blue) and design. Another ban during this period was the import of chintz fabric, from 1686 to 1759. This decorative Indian cotton fabric incorporated motifs of flowers, exotic figures, and insects, woven together with broderie motifs which resembled geometrically arranged panels of drapery. This piece, probably made by the potteries at Moustier-Sainte-Marie, features all of these influences. The shape of the tureen was designed to simulate the silver forms Louis XIV banned. The classic blue and white combination was a direct imitation of imported Asian porcelain. And the hand-painted designs were influenced by both the styles of Asian porcelain and the motifs and patterns from chintz fabrics. Sherds of faience pottery similar to this piece were found at the Post of Arkansas.\n\nBroadside and trading card\n\nLittle Rock Paint & Color Works\n\nPrinted by M.R. Savage\n\nLittle Rock, AR\n\nca. 1890\n\nMineral-based paint on paper\n\n6 ¼ X 16 in.\n\nAccession No: 2017.4\n\nHistoric Arkansas Museum Foundation Purchase\n\nTastemakers and Trends: What was the appeal of this paint store’s product?\n\nLocal paint stores of the late 19th century usually sold paint manufactured out-of-state, but Little Rock Paint & Color Works appears to have mixed and made their own paints. This circa 1890s broadside is in mint condition, and features 25 swatches of paint, each color individually painted by hand. The broadside was printed by a local printer, M.R. Savage.\n\nLittle Rock Paint Works appealed to its market in several ways: the ‘ready-mixed’ feature would have significantly cut the time a painter spent preparing his paint, especially on larger jobs. The company also boasts itself as the “Manufacturer of the Arkansaw Traveler,” which we speculate is a reference to a paint color cleverly named after the then-ubiquitous pop culture icon. Finally, the fine presentation of 25 richly saturated color samples would have appealed to consumers. The dominant color among these “popular shades and colors” is green, which appears in a dozen varying olive and sage tones, as well as teal and emerald green. Other popular colors include earth tones and a bright and bold orange.\n\nThe company’s trading card (a traditional form of advertising) features five color swatches of varying shades of brown and earthy reds. They are advertised on the back of the card as “Iron Clad Paint,” with the suggested use for “Wood or Iron Bridges, Tin and Iron Roofs, Agricultural Implements, Cars, Barns...” Minerals like lead and iron were used in paints for their exceptional binding properties.\n\nChild’s cape and dress\n\nMaker unknown\n\nLikely Arkansas\n\nca. 1860\n\nWool, silk, cotton\n\n26 ½ x 15 in. (dress); 31 ½ x 15 in. (cape)\n\nAccession No: ND171\n\nTastemakers and Trends: Where did 19th century tastemakers find inspiration for this style?\n\nFlamboyant details borrowed from military uniforms inspired clothing styles for women and children in the mid-19th century. The elaborate braid trim used on European Hussar jackets and a distinctive uniform style used by the French Zouaves became fashion staples in the 1850s and 1860s. The many details of this girl’s sized military-inspired cape and dress closely mimic similar outfits worn by fashionable women of the time. Although this ensemble was likely made in Arkansas, far away from the fashion centers of eastern states, the maker had ready access to current styles of the day through lady’s magazines. Arkansas newspapers of the 1860s advertise wool and braided trim available in a rainbow of colors, giving our seamstress a variety of options available locally.\n\nToday, red and green color pairings are most often associated with the Christmas season, but in the 19th century, tastemakers felt that pairing contrasting colors from the color wheel created visual balance. “Green and scarlet harmonize”, wrote George Audsley in his 1870 book Color in Dress: A Manual for Ladies. Victorians married tones of red and green in their quilts, needlework, clothing, art, and interior decor with striking results. The color red was often used in elegant evening wear and winter coats. It conjured thoughts of energy, emotion, and passion and came into fashion through inspiration from military uniforms and hunting livery. To the Victorians, green evoked a much different response. Green symbolized youth, spring, and calm, and when used as an accent, made a wonderful foil for fiery red.\n\nCupboard\n\nOriginally made by Cherokee students\n\nPainted over time by members of the Washbourne family\n\nRussellville, AR\n\nca.1820-1829\n\nYellow pine, metal\n\n84 x 62 x 19 in.\n\nCourtesy of the Arkansas Tech Museum\n\nTastemakers and Trends: Why does this cupboard have a “rainbow” of colors?\n\nThis crudely constructed cupboard was made either by members of the Washbourne family and/or Cherokee students at the Dwight Mission, near Russellville (Pope County), Arkansas, around 1820-1829. Frontier furniture was crafted for functionality – which dictated a simple form. And though American interior design continued to evolve with new fads, these essential pieces of furniture were not cast aside, but were instead updated to reflect the tastes of the times.\n\nThe paint strips on this cupboard reflect the changing tastes of the American household from its construction date, 1820-1829, to its last coat of paint in 1947. In the 1820s, the exuberant trend of Fancy decoration was at an all-time high. The general rule was to choose pieces and materials that animated an interior. Wood furniture was often constructed out of whatever material was on hand, such as yellow pine, and then painted to mimic another finer wood material, such as mahogany. As new green and yellow pigments became commercially available, these colors were applied to furniture. No colors or combinations were too adventurous. As today, trends waxed and waned. While brown and more sober hues came back into vogue during the 1850s to 1870s, bright and bold colors, such as this green strip, made their return in the late 1870s to 1890s. Neutral colors once again returned to popularity around the turn of the century, and “drab” colors mimicking natural materials, like camel brown, once again dominated the household.\n\nMrs. John Drennen (née Emily Deadrick Stuart)\n\n(1801-1844)\n\nAttributed to George Catlin\n\nVan Buren, Crawford Co., Arkansas\n\nca. 1834\n\nOil on linen\n\n38 x 33 in.\n\nAccession No: 2005.12.50\n\nArkansas Natural and Cultural Resources Council Grant Purchase\n\nTastemakers and Trends: Why is Mrs . Drennen wearing black?\n\n“Dress” in 19th century terms refers to the total look, from head to toe. “Day dress” was more casual than morning attire, while evening wear or “full dress” was considered the most formal mode. Day dresses were frequently made of colorful wool or cotton prints, but black continued to be popular due to its associations with piety and traditional formal dress.\n\nDuring the early 19th century when this portrait was painted, true black was a difficult color to produce in textiles. Cheap dyes made of oak galls, walnuts, or blackberries faded almost immediately into orange or dark gray, respectively. The best and most expensive method was triple-dipping (once in blue, yellow, and then red vats of dye). A simpler process combined indigo and a deep red dye from a Central American tree called logwood to create a more permanent, less expensive dark black. In this portrait, Mrs. Drennen wears a black day dress with a low neckline, a pointed bodice, and tight-fitting sleeves that balloon out at the elbow. The 1830s were a transitional decade in fashion, spanning the years between the end of the Regency era and the beginning of the Victorian era. In the early 1830s, ballooning “gigot” or “leg-of-mutton” sleeves were considered fashionable, but by 1836, the gigot sleeve shrank, and the upper sleeve was drawn into tight horizontal rows of puffed shirring. Mrs. Drennen wears an embroidered cotton or linen bertha around her shoulders for modesty, closed with a decorative brooch at the center of her chest.\n\nOvermantle looking glass (mirror)\n\nMaker unknown\n\nOwned by the Woodruff Family of Little Rock, AR\n\nUnited States\n\n1815-1830\n\nCompo, bole, wood, gold, modern mirror glass\n\n54 ¾ x 44 in.\n\nAccession No: 2018.30\n\nGift of Swannee Bennett\n\nTastemakers and Trends: Why are there Romans on this mirror?\n\nThe second half of the 18th century in Europe witnessed the rising influence of classical antiquity on aesthetics and artistic style. As artists and aristocrats began touring, and subsequently copying, the great works and monuments of antiquity, the neoclassical style was born. This mix of first-hand observation and the reproduction of classical works dominated European art, architecture, and the decorative arts. Neoclassical designs had an immediate and broad influence on American interiors, and the “antique” taste was utilized by craftsmen in their own creations. To furnish the neoclassical style, ancient forms were transformed into gilt ornament. The gold finish was meant to mimic the golden accents recently rediscovered on Roman ruins. Only the elite were fortunate enough to purchase antiquities to decorate their homes, but cabinetmakers and other artisans transformed their creations to pass as the real things. This mirror is a mix of both.\n\nThe bas-relief frieze panel, featuring a scene of Roman centurions riding a chariot drawn by lions, warriors and cherubs, was inspired by classical Roman mythology. This scene is flanked by fluted columns with Corinthian capitals. The gilding of the piece added another mystical element mimicking classical antiquities. Gilding is the application of metal finishes to metal, wood, glass, or ceramics. This frame was probably water and oil gilded onto a bole-prepared compo surface. Compo (composition) was a popular material for molded ornament, as it was faster to produce than carved wood and more stable for gilding.\n\nPainted flour bin\n\nMaker unknown\n\nJefferson or Pulaski County, Arkansas\n\nca. 1875\n\nSouthern yellow pine, paint, iron hinges\n\n36 x 42 ½ x 14 ½ in.\n\nAccession No: 98.11.2\n\nGala Purchase honoring Ginger and Adron Crews\n\nTastemakers and Trends: How did the paint on this bin function in a mid-19th century kitchen?\n\nThe white paint on this bin oxidized over its original emerald green undercoat, transforming into a crackled yellow-cream. When the museum acquired the piece in 1995, it arrived well-aged, distressed to perfection from over 100 years of use. But back in the 1870s when it was made, its sturdy Southern yellow pine base was given a slick, shiny coat of paint. For a piece so heavily used (it likely stored flour), a freshly painted surface was much easier to wipe down and keep clean than bare wood. This “sanitary aesthetic” factored significantly into mid-Victorian era home furnishings, especially in work spaces like the kitchen.\n\nSanitary campaigns of the mid-Victorian era promoted hygiene in the home and associated sunlight and brightness with cleanliness. They marked the beginning of a slow shift from the dim, shadowy interiors of earlier days, which were thought to trap dust and conceal germs. The application of paint to surfaces like furniture also conveyed cleanliness and hygiene.\n\nInnovations in paint production helped popularize painted surfaces; as an alternative to traditional oil based paint, which had a more matte finish, 19th century paint manufacturers offered zinc oxide as a non-toxic base with a sheen for enamel paints. A second choice was soft distemper, which was reversible and required a re-coating after a year or two of use.\n\nPeter Hanger’s velvet parlor carpet\n\nManufacturer unknown\n\nProbably American\n\nca. 1860\n\nWool and linen\n\n13 x 11 ¼ in.\n\nAccession No: 87.70.17\n\nGift of Charles and Rebecca Witsell\n\nTastemakers and Trends: How did 19th-century Americans use carpets to enliven their decor?\n\nFew original 19th century carpets survived the ravages of moths, water damage, heavy foot traffic, and efforts to repurpose even the most worn fragments. This well-used carpet section was found in the attic of the historic Frederick Hanger House at 1010 Scott Street in Little Rock with a hand-written inscription penned by Frances Marion Hanger, daughter-in-law of early Arkansas settler Peter Hanger, describing the carpet’s origins. In 1859, Peter Hanger acquired 160 acres east of downtown Little Rock, as well as a Greek Revival home that he called Oakwood, which was located on what is now the south side of the 1400 block of East 9th Street. According to Frances’s inscription, Peter Hanger ordered several thousand dollars’ worth of goods during the Civil War, but this velvet carpet was the only article in the order to make it down the Mississippi River before it was blockaded by Union Troops in 1863.\n\nVelvet carpet is a high-end tapestry carpet with a low pile. Most middle-class families used flat-woven ingrain carpet, but affluent homes were decorated with pricier carpets, including Wiltons, Brussels, Axminsters, and tapestries. Wills and estate inventories confirm the practice of reserving quality floor coverings for the most public rooms of a house, with the best carpet saved for the formal parlor where guests were entertained and weddings, funerals, and other events were held. This velvet carpet was probably installed wall-to-wall in the parlor of Peter Hanger’s antebellum home, Oakwood. The original colors would have included cream, orange, maroon, golden yellow, and brown in an arabesque design.\n\nReproduction ingrain carpet\n\nBrunschwig & Fils, New York\n\nWool 22 x 20 in.\n\nReproduced in 2004\n\nBased on 1840s carpet from Abraham Lincoln’s home in Springfield, IL\n\nAccession No: R2005.002\n\nTastemakers and Trends: Is this carpet gaudy or tasteful?\n\n“Two colors only, with the dark and light shades of each, will make a very handsome carpet,” wrote “Miss Leslie” in her 1854 edition of The Lady’s House Book. Mid-19th century American design critics like Leslie praised ingrain carpets with various shades of green and red. Although this carpet may seem gaudy to contemporary eyes, the pairing of red and green was especially popular in the 1840s and 50s, in home furnishings and fashion alike. It is no accident that on the color wheel, red and green lie opposite each other and are thereby considered complementary.\n\nA home-furnishings fever spread across America when this ingrain carpet was manufactured. For the first time, Americans were experiencing an age of public taste in which they could actively cultivate an aesthetic for their home. Thanks to mass production, now most people—not just the wealthy few—could afford to decorate their interiors. Wallpaper, carpeting, and furniture arrived in Little Rock on steamboats from factories in Cincinnati and New Orleans.\n\nThe average Arkansas settler probably grew up in a home with bare or painted pine floors. But by the 1840s, almost everyone could afford to deck his home wall-to-wall with carpet. Samples arrived in mail-order catalogs, and merchants offered goods in great variety in their storefront windows. Given this new opportunity, a person might enthusiastically choose carpet bursting in colors and geometric patterns. The antebellum home of James McVicar (located on the museum grounds) features this reproduction carpet in the parlor.\n\nRoderweis front parlor\n\nPhotographer unknown\n\nJacksonville, AR\n\n1895\n\nPhotographic print\n\n9 x 11 in.\n\nAccession No: 96.49.3\n\nGift of the Estate of Ina Dupree\n\nTastemakers and Trends: What colors do you imagine in this Victorian parlor?\n\nThe Roderweis family (pictured) represented the up-and-coming, stylish middle class of late 19th century Americans. John Roderweis, the head of this German immigrant family and a carpenter by trade, built his home and surely beamed with pride at this accomplishment. His family fittingly posed for the camera inside their fully-furnished front parlor, the heart of the home. The family displays some of its prized personal possessions, including a piano, Bible, and gilt-framed family portraits. It’s the kind of cluttered, romantic nest that characterized so many bourgeois Victorian homes.\n\nIt’s hard to tell from the original black-and-white photograph that this late 19th century Victorian parlor was full of color, from floor to wall to tabletop. But a closer examination shows that nature-inspired floral and vine-like patterns climb almost every surface and furnishing. Cozy chaos came to define Victorian interiors. Attention to scale and a warm, subdued color palette helped harmonize an otherwise dizzyingly cluttered living space. Design critics from the period praised wallpaper and carpet manufacturers’ use of soft or “drabbed” color combinations, and denounced the bold contrasting colors of the mid-19th century. A wall covering, for example, was not meant to be a showstopper, but rather contributed to the atmosphere of a room.\n\nWe reimagined the Roderweis parlor with the help of William Doran, a professional colorist who digitally applied color to a high-resolution scan of the print. The tones in our retouched image appear a bit louder and bolder than they would have looked in real life, which is a trait common to both modern and historical photo colorizations.\n\nAbbie Churchill Henry C. Byrd (1804-1884)\n\nLittle Rock, Pulaski Co., Arkansas\n\nca. 1857\n\nOil on mattress ticking\n\n42 ¼ x 37 ½ in.\n\nAccession No: 98.51.1\n\nGala Fund Purchase in honor of Adron and Ginger Crews\n\nTechnology and Innovation: How have the fine art painter’s tools changed since the 1850s?\n\nWhen artist Henry Byrd made this portrait of young Abbie Churchill in the late 1850s, the painter’s tools and techniques had not changed much since 1400s, but American and European artists were poised on the precipice of rapid technological development. Before the overwhelming adoption of the collapsible paint tube, invented in 1841, each pigment was ground into linseed or poppy seed oil using a glass muller on a stone slab. For the sake of economy, most artists made only enough paint for the day’s work, laying out just a few colors on a relatively small palette.\n\nStanding at his easel, the 19th-century artist needed a solid foundation in draftsmanship, but he also had to remember a dizzying number of rules governing the possibilities and limitations of each pigment. Some pigments could not be worked with oil, and many pigments created chemical reactions when mixed, altering colors and even eating away at the linen support. Wax, alum, chalk, and other drying agents were added to correct what were seen as deficiencies in each pigment’s intrinsic properties. Itinerant artists like Henry Byrd probably would’ve purchased raw pigments and other fine art supplies from a merchant like S.H. Tucker, a Little Rock dealer in a wide variety of dry goods and stationery shipped to Arkansas through contact with wholesalers in bigger port cities like New Orleans. In lieu of fine linen canvas from England, Byrd painted this portrait on a support of tightly-woven blue and white mattress ticking.\n\nBlack Vulture or Carrion Crow\n\nDrawn from nature by John James Audubon (1785-1851)\n\nEngraved, printed and colored by Robert Havell\n\nLondon\n\n1831\n\nDouble elephant folio\n\n37 x 47 in.\n\nAccession No: 93.34\n\nGift of Dr. Alex A. Pappas\n\nTechnology and Innovation: How were colored prints made for Audubon's original The Birds of America?\n\nBefore the invention of photography and precision-ground lenses, if you wanted to study birds closely, you needed to be handy with a rifle. American naturalist John James Audubon was interested in the fledgling field of ornithology from a young age, and he spent hundreds of hours shooting and sketching wild birds. To create life-like poses, he pinned a freshly-killed bird to a board of his own design, wiring it into place and working quickly with pencils and watercolor before the creature deteriorated beyond use.\n\nAlmost from the beginning, Audubon was determined that even the biggest birds he drew should be reproduced at life-size. When printers Robert Havel l and his son were hired, they used the largest paper then available, the double elephant folio. Robert Havell Jr. first created a copperplate engraving based on each of Audubon’s original drawings by incising the design into a sheet of copper with a sharp tool called a burin. Then he inked the entire copper plate and wiped it clean, so black ink remained only within the incised lines. A printing process called aquatint was used to create effects like texture and value. Color printing was in its infancy in the 1830s, so once the black lines were printed, color was added by hand using watercolor paints. Robert Havell Sr. created one perfect ‘pattern’ print that was copied over and over by a team of colorists who painted each print to match the reference pattern.\n\nBlack Japanned chair\n\nMaker unknown Likely American\n\n19th century\n\nMaple or pine with fabric cover over original rush seat\n\n32 x 14 ½ in.\n\nAccession No: 73.11.7\n\nGift of the Elger Estate\n\nTechnology & Innovation: Why was this chair painted gold and black?\n\nFueled by increasing trade with countries like Japan and China in the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans and Americans developed a taste for all things Asian. The love for \"Oriental\" imports included art, ceramics, textiles, and perhaps most of all, black lacquered furniture. Lacquer finishes were prized for their lustrous depth and striking black sheen and those who could afford it incorporated imported pieces into their home decor. Yet for many people, high price and limited supply meant that authentic lacquered furniture was out of reach.\n\nLacquer is made of carefully processed sap from the Chinese lacquer tree, which is a species Western craftsmen didn't have access to. Ever ingenious, they developed ways to replicate the glossy black finish by using varnishes, a product derived from plant resin. Cabinet makers and furniture decorators called their faux-lacquered furniture “japanning”; the mistaken view of the time was that “Japan” encompassed all of southeast Asia, India, and China. This process further imitated imported furniture by incorporating faux bamboo, floral, porcelain elements, and gilt chinoiserie designs. Fine black lines, referred to at the time as pen work, were applied to further enhance the lacquer designs.\n\nCrazy quilt square\n\nMaker unknown\n\nArkansas\n\nca. 1890\n\nSilk, velvet and cotton\n\n9 ¼ x 10 ½ in.\n\nAccession No: 2003.4.120\n\nGift of Peg Newton Smith\n\nTechnology and Innovation: How did a Victorian quilter have access to such a wide variety of fabrics?\n\nA Victorian-era crazy quilt square holds a myriad of 30 unique pieces of fabric. Velvets in chocolatey earth tones and silks in pale pink and crimson red are accented by yellow and white embroidery stitches. Composed of a household’s clothing and textile remnants, this crazy quilt square is a wonderful way to see the variety of fabrics available to Americans during the second half of the 19th century. Mail-order design books such as Godey’s an d Journal of Design offered Americans the latest fabric samples, from patterned cottons and calicoes to high-styled silk, chiffon and crepe for fine dresses. For the first time, Americans (not just the wealthy elite) could purchase textiles of varying colors, patterns, and textures.\n\nThe industrialization of textiles in this country during the 19th century provided Americans with an unprecedented abundance of affordable fabric. Manufacturers in major cities produced fabrics like silk, velvet, and cottons in varying colorful prints. This new found supply essentially gave rise to the pieced quilt in America. In particular, crazy quilts—which got their name from the seemingly random arrangement of fabric pieces—appealed to needle workers of all skillsets and economic means. The crazy pattern was widely adored for the chance it gave its maker to add personal touches such as memorial ribbons and personal initials, and to make use of her “rag bag” of dress and household textile remnants.\n\n“Currant” Flock Paper for General Purposes\n\nManufactured by Woollams and Co.\n\nThe Journal of Design\n\nEngland\n\n1850-51\n\nFlock paper, paint\n\n5 x 4 in.\n\nAccession No: 87.68.2\n\nTechnology and Innovation: What toxic ingredient created green in early Victorian wallpaper?\n\nVictorians fell in love with a particular color called “Scheele’s Green,” named after the Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who first developed it. But the secret ingredient used to make this lusted-for hue was arsenic, an extremely toxic naturally-occurring element mined and used by manufacturers to color paint, wallpapers, and clothing. Arsenic was blamed for the deaths of miners and many consumers who were exposed to this pigment through painted objects and home furnishings like wallpaper.\n\nArsenic is a metalloid, meaning it and can bind with another metal to form an alloy, or a compound mixture. Scheele first combined arsenic in the 1770s with copper when he produced his brighter-than-usual green pigment. The copper-to-arsenic ratio, along with the degree of heat applied during the bonding process, determines the intensity of the resulting green. Even though arsenic was used as a rat poison at the time, consumers and manufacturers continued to deny its toxic effect on humans. However, as number of arsenic-related illnesses and a deaths rose, manufacturers eventually stopped using it in their production.\n\nMachine printed-wallpaper entered the mass market after 1840. Mechanized rollers allowed manufacturers to produce a higher volume of paper, making wallpaper more accessible and affordable to middle class Americans than traditional block-printed wallpaper. Rococo revival floral patterns were especially popular during the first half of the 19th century.\n\nOrange Tureen\n\nMaker unknown\n\nCanton, China\n\nca. 1810\n\nGlazed hard-paste porcelain\n\n11 ½ x 14 ½ x 8 ¾ in.\n\nAccession No: 2006.45.1\n\nGift of Mr. and Mrs. A. Howard Stebbins, III.\n\nTechnology and Innovation: How was this tureen made?\n\nChinese porcelain, “chinaware,” has always been popular in America. In 1785, when America’s firs t merchant ship in the Chinese trade returned from Canton, her hull contained the porcelain pieces made to order for the American market. The mechanics of the porcelain trade with the West was a streamlined, multi-step process completed at several different locations. From the digging of clay, the forming of objects at a potter’s wheel or using a mold, the decorating and glazing, the firing of kilns, to the final packing and distributing of the items to merchants, this process was automated at different villages established for each individual step.\n\nAt Canton, the vessels received final decorations specified by their buyers. Traders shared designs and personalized emblems from their customers with the painters who masterfully copied these designs. While visiting Canton in 1769, American traveler William Hickey noted, “we found upwards of a hundred persons at work in sketching or finishing the various ornaments upon each particular piece of ware, some parts being executed by men of a very advanced age, and others by children even so young as six or seven years.”\n\nThis tureen features the Fitzhugh, an immensely popular pattern of the time, with a floral quadrant of chrysanthemum clusters spaced around a central field which was filled with the buyer’s own design. The orange over-glaze, with a personalized emblem of the rampant United States bald eagle, painted en grisaille (dark brown over-glaze enamel painted to present an appearance with more shades) is an extremely rare combination.\n\nRoderweis family outside their home\n\nPhotographer unknown\n\nJacksonville, AR\n\nca. 1880\n\nPhotographic print and watercolor\n\n10 ½ x 11 ½ in.\n\nAccession No: 96.49.2\n\nGift of the Estate of Ina Dupree\n\nTechnology and Innovation: Why did this late 19th century family have their photograph color-tinted?\n\nWhen the Roderweis family posed before their home circa 1890, innovators in the field of photography had not yet figured out how to feasibly process color photographs. Still, it’s fair to say that everyone yearned to see their lives captured in color. The photography industry’s solution was (for only a few pennies more) to colorize the black and white prints by hand.\n\nAfter they were processed, the photographic prints were tinted by a “colorist,” a trained professional usually hired by the photographer. It was common for the photographer to make color notes on the back of his print for the hand-tinter to use as her guide. The colorist applied her colors with a small brush, using pastel, oil, or watercolor. Varnishing the print first ensured an even application of the color medium.\n\nThe colorizing of Roderweis’s print was perhaps a bit of an amateur job, or the family chose a minimal but affordable treatment. The artist brushed the principal elements of the image: the ground (grass & vegetation), the roof of the home, and a big blue sky. The five members of the Roderweis family remain untouched, and stand in their original black and white forms."
