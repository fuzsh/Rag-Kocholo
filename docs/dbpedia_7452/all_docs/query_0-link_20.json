RITCHIE\n\nAfter 1945 there was an obvious desire within Germany to forget the whole interlude of National Socialism. There was also a widely-held assumption that no literature of any value could have been produced in this period. Only comparatively few historians have been prepared to take the beliefs of the time seriously and to allow that in such literature there was some kind of idealism at work, and that many writers and intellectuals did believe in what they were doing — reacting against the 'decadence' of Weimar culture. This study starts with an exploration of proto-Nazi literature in the early years of this century and pursues later developments up to the arrival of fullyfledged National Socialism. Not only literature within Germany is covered; after 1933, republican writers forced into exile for racial as well as political reasons rejected the anti-semitic 'barbarism' of National Socialism and developed a powerful brand of anti-fascist literature in countries around the world. This 'exile' literature is covered in depth, both for its outstanding individual figures like Brecht and Mann, as well as for the general phenomenon of exile. Attention is particularly focused on those non-Nazis who remained in Germany as 'inner emigres' forming a resistance literature. One forgotten area of resistance also highlighted here is the Spanish Civil War in which many writers fought. Exile raised many problems, not least the nature of the Germany to which exiles might one day return, and a discussion of the divided Germany of the post-1945 period concludes this stimulating and thought-provoking study.\n\nDigitized by the Internet Archive in 2020 with funding from Kahle/Austin Foundation\n\nhttps://archive.0rg/details/germanliteratureOOOOritc\n\nGeiman Literature under National Socialism J.

Of course a great deal was also written inside Germany after 1933, but only comparatively few historians have been prepared to take the beliefs of the time seriously, and to start from the assumption that in such hterature there was some kind of ideahsm at work, and that many writers and intellectuals did beheve in what they were doing—reacting against the supposed corruption and ‘decadence’ of the modern age and reasserting traditional values. This is what I have attempted to do here. Instead of dismissing all Nazi hterature whether written before 1933 or after as rubbish, I have tried to understand what National Socialists thought they had to offer that was new and valuable. Very often, too, surveys of the period become obsessed either with theories of fascism or with the machinery of power and accordingly spend most time on the ideology or on the Reichsschrifttumskammer. In their fascination with the organs of censorship they ignore what was actually being written by behevers inside this system, overlooking the fact that Nazi cultural organisations were also supposed to promote the new hterature and art of the Third Reich. So, while not neglecting entirely the significance of the propaganda ministry and the laws and restrictions characteristic of National Sociahst Germany, I have also tried to show first of aU that there was in the Weimar RepubHc a powerful tradition on which the National Sociahsts could build. After this first section I consider those writers, dramatists and poets who firmly beUeved (at least initially) in the Fuhrer and his mission and the novels, plays and poems they produced in the Ught of this beUef. Despite National Sociahst contempt for inteUectualism and theory, such writers were by no means fanatics, bhndly foUowing national guide-lines developed by Goebbels with his ‘steely Romanticism’, or by others hke him. While the National Sociahsts rejected the ‘decadence’ of the Weimar Repubhc, repubhcan writers forced into exile for racial as weU as pohtical and hterary reasons rejected the ‘barbarism’ of the\n\nIntroduction National Socialists. From the point of view of literary history the result has been that what was written outside Germany between 1933 and 1945 has tended to be treated separately from National Socialist literature. It cannot be said that this ‘exile literature’ has benefitecf from such separate treatment. While Nazi literature has for long been neglected as not worthy of serious examination, exile Uterature has also been neglected, not because it was thought lacking in quality, but for a variety of other reasons, not the least of which was the fact that it was a painful reminder of a period many preferred to forget. The great names like Thomas Mann and Bert Brecht were taken out and dealt with separately, but the phenomenon of exile in itself and the effects of exile on literary productivity were ignored. Some scholars did start to examine the problem of exile at an early stage, but only in the last two decades has exile Uterature come to attract more widespread attention. At the same time the realisation has gradually dawned that exile cannot be separated from the movement which brought it about in the first place. Hence the last few years have seen the first attempts to consider cause and effect. National SociaUsm and exile together. This is what I too have attempted to do in this volume. Clearly, with so much ground to cover and so many authors and books to analyse, a great deal has had to be excluded. Focusing on books and authors means that less time is spent on organisations and outright poUtics. It also means there is Uttle consideration of the congresses, pubUc rallies, manifestos, declarations, et cetera which were a feature of the time. What may also perhaps make this book rather different from any other such survey of the Uterature of the period is not only a readiness to take what was written at the time seriously, but also the focus on the problem of Germany itself. The National Socialists thought they represented the real Germany, while writers in exile felt it was they who had to keep the memory of tme German culture aUve. Inside Germany those not in favour of the regime could attempt to withdraw into their own ‘inner’ Germany, or seek for sources of strength in Germany’s democratic traditions in order to resist. It is a conviction of this book that there was resistance to Hitler’s Germany and that this resistance found powerful Uterary expression not only outside Germany in the exile community, but also inside Germany itself. The most immediate example of such resistance to Hitler’s Germany was the Spanish Civil War, in which many German writers fought and died. This was a war which saw Germans fighting against Germans, democrats against Nazis, although the anti-fascist forces were defeated and with\n\nIntroduction Hitler’s and Mussolini’s help Franco was victorious. Despite this the megsage was not lost on the rest of the world. It was possible to resist and there were Germans as well as others prepared to do so. Hitler’s victories were staggering and embraced large areas of Europe and Russia, but the defeats when they came were also equally allembracing and catastrophic. After it was all over Europe was devastated, Germany lay in ruins and miUions were dead. When the end came the full evil of the regime began to be revealed, especially what had been done to the Jews. In view of such horrors it is not surprising that there has been a tendency to consider all German Uterature of the period contaminated—Nazi literature certainly does reek of blood and soil and no claim is made here that there are lost or forgotten masterpieces among its remnants. Yet it cannot be ignored: indeed it must be examined, even if only because not so long ago it constituted the reading matter enthusiastically devoured by milhons of people. Exile hterature too must become better known, both for its intrinsic quaUty and for the problems it confronted, for these problems have not gone away. When 1 started work on this book I thought I was a pioneer in this country, especially in the sphere of Nazi hterature. I quickly discovered that in fact several of my own colleagues had preceded me, with excellent (though regrettably unpubhshed) dissertations. ^ I have benefited greatly from Hugh Ridley’s Cambridge thesis on National Socialism and Literature; from A.D. White on Kolbenheyer; G.P. Hutchinson on Rosenberg; Roger Wood on Jiinger; and E.P. Dickins on irmer emigration; my grateful thanks go to Angela Rutter, who let me read her University of Sussex project work on Inner Emigration and resistance. They will all recognise traces of their work in this book. I have also drawn on many American dissertations now more readily available as books through the University Microfilm Service and on many speciahst studies, especially those by Orlowski, Brekle, Gisela Berglund, Gunter Hartung, Ernst Loewy, Wolfgang Emmerich, H.A. Walter and John Spalek. 1 learned a great deal through personal contacts with Jan Hans and Lutz Winckler, thanks to a semester at the University of Hamburg’s Research Centre for Exile Studies. I am also particularly grateful for the Fellowship from the Leverhulme Trust which made this stay in Hamburg possible. My gratitude extends equally to the staff in the Deutsche Bibliothek in Frankfurt and in the Literaturarchiv in Marbach whom I was able to consult at the same time. The longest periods were spent in the university library in Sheffield and I am grateful to Eileen Ryan and others there who found\n\nIntroduction books and references for me that others had failed to find. Students from the Sheffield University School of librarianship were extremely helpful with assistance in hterature searches. Finally, however, my thanks go to my wife Sheena, who has read the manuscript more tlian once and improved it where necessary (which was often); and to Barbara Zeun who has typed draft after draft and version after version.\n\nPART ONE 1914-1933-GERMANY SLEEPS\n\nAji£;» ■*\n\nj\n\n'\n\nI:\n\n.\n\n1\n\nTHE WEIMAR REPUBLIC'S SECRET GERMANY\n\nIn discussing the Third Reich it is as well to remember that the Reich was an ancient and hallowed concept which Hitler and the National Socialists appropriated and distorted.^ It had a long history; three was a magic number combining power, culture and well-being, the people of this Third Reich would be a master race inheriting all the cultural, spiritual and temporal riches of the Reichs which had preceded it; aU disharmony would be resolved by the third, permanence would be guaranteed for one thousand years, the millennium would be assured. The medieval German Reich had been a successor to the Roman Empire and like it had covered the greater part of Europe, bringing German rule and German law to a vast area. During the long period of the existence of the First Reich many poUtical weaknesses developed, yet when it finally collapsed these tended to be forgotten and only the memory of German unity and greatness remained. The word Reich had religious as weU as political reverber¬ ations. Reich was the word used in the Luther Bible in such phrases as ‘Dein Reich komme’ (‘Thy kingdom come’). The First Reich was holy. It had been founded in 962 when Pope John XII crowned and anointed as Roman Emperor Otto I, King of Germany. This First Reich lasted until 1806, by which time, as Voltaire had said, it was neither holy, Roman, nor an Empire. Yet the collapse of the First Reich created a vacuum; there remained only a confusion of conflict¬ ing German states of different sizes and political complexion. The heart of the ‘German problem’ after 1806 was what the future of these states would be geographically, politically and spiritually if a Second Reich were formed. Some of these states came together in the German Confederation of 1815 and the forces for further unification continued through the nineteenth century. Metternich’s Austria was far more powerful than Prussia and when the revolutions came in 1848 reaction seemed about to crumble but no democratic, united Germany emerged from the disturbances. The Second German Reich which Bismarck fashioned in 1871 was deliberately a Little German solution excluding not only Austria, but many other areas as well. It coUapsed in 1918. The Weimar Republic which followed satisfied no one. The official title of the federal Germany proclaimed at Versailles on 18 January 1871 was Deutsches Reich. This title was retained by the Weimar 3\n\n4\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\nRepublic and by the National Socialist regime. Third Reich was an unofficial name which in fact was banned after 1939. In addition to its political and reUgious associations the idea of a Third Reich also has a rich Uterary and philosophical tradition^ which , Hitler was quick to exploit. Aspirations to a future state of perfection had been fostered as early as the thirteenth century by the preacher Joachim de Floris, who had foretold the coming of a third kingdom. This prophecy lingered on and was put into more poetic form by Jakob Bohme in his allegory of the new dawn, Aurora. Herder developed a similar theme in his Maran Atha or The Lord Cometh and following the publication of this work, which roused much comment at the time, belief in chihasm became widespread in Germany. Evidence of Herder’s influence and of these chiUastic beUefs is shown by Goethe’s Mdrchen, which even Carlyle interpreted as heralding the coming of the New Universal Kingdom. Lessing too developed the idea of the Third Kingdom from Herder and the whole concept was expanded philosophically by Kant, Fichte and Schiller. Following this trend the whole Romantic generation seemed to be filled with a longing for the Golden Age, satisfied in part by reviving the memory of the medieval Reich as the ideal of unity and harmony. This kind of Uterary regression reached its cUmax in works like NovaHs’ mysticalhistorical romance Heinrich von Ofterdingen, but Holderlin too became a favourite of conservative-nationahst thinkers, not only for his German themes, but also for his stress on the Third Reich, that would combine Christianity and paganism into a new synthesis. Hegel and ScheUing developed the same ideas, yet ironically it was the Young Germans (and in particular Heine) who were to become the apostles of the philosophy of the Third Reich. Basically, throughout the nineteenth century, all schools of Uterary thought, whether conservative, Hberal or even SociaHst, were fascinated by the concept. As the mystics of an earher age had awaited the kingdom of God on earth, so now the Sociahsts, heralded by Jean Paul, awaited the coming of a time when a new social order would rule everywhere and all suffering and evil come to an end. Socialism is but a worldy form of ChQiasm.^ Hitler promised a SociaUsm that was also national. Whether all suffering and evil came to an end with the creation of his Third Reich is another matter. One of the poets the National Socialists Uked to look back to as one\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\n5\n\nof their spiritual ancestors was Ernst Moritz Arndt, and he gave a linguistic answer to the question about the extent of the German Reich. To the question ‘What is the German’s Fatherland?’, he replied, ‘Germany is wherever the German tongue resounds.’ This was extremely tempting as a cultural ideal as long as the Reich existed only in the mind. Hitler made this into a territorial demand. All of the implications of the word Reich discussed so far had been in the air for a long time before Hitler. Richard Samuel sums up all the possibilities as follows: The Reich constituted a supra-national idea, it could embrace—in theory—all Germans and at the same time provide historical reasons for including non-German minorities. The linguistic idea never came to grips with the fact that in many border regions of Germany people with German and non-German speech were so intermingled that no disentanglement was possible.^ Samuel might have continued that disentanglement was made possible through the wars and genocide which proved to be Hitler’s method. The Third Reich which, according to the ancient legend, should have been an age of eternal peace and harmony, was distorted into an age of death and destruction. The notion of the Reich was linked with that of the divine mission of the German people. In the words of the ‘herald of the Reich’, the poet Emanuel Geibel, in 1861: Und es mag am deutschen Wesen Einmal noch die Welt genesen. (What is German may one day restore the world.) This German mission too Hitler interpreted rather differently to mean the superiority of the Aryan race, the claim to Lebensraum, including the right to deprive inferior races of everything, even of their lives. This was yet another corruption of what had been a high ideal. If the Reich was holy, then the German Volk too was holy. In Arndt’s words: ‘The Volk is as holy as the rabble is unholy.’ Certainly there were anti-Semitic elements in German Romanticism, but the word Volk did not have any racial connotations, on the contrary Germany was the ‘Volk der Mitte’, the people which through its central geographical position had a peculiar destiny—‘the destiny to absorb in itself the spirit of West and East and to combine in itself the cultural achievements of Europe’.*^\n\n6\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\nThis was lost and Volkstum and Deutschtum came to denote a form of ‘Germanhood’ never envisaged by Herder and his contemporaries in the Age of Idealism. Volkisch, as used by later Nazi pseudo-scientists and cultural historians, came to have a purely racial meaning. Had German history been different the concept of the Third Reich as a glorious but impossible ideal, a Utopia, a paradise, in which all contradictions would be resolved and all the secret longings of the German people satisfied, would have remained a myth to be studied by medievalists and literary historians. During the chaotic days of the 1918 revolution, when the Second Reich was collapsing and it appeared that a neo-conservative state might take its place, the myth of the Third Reich enjoyed a sudden revival. It came to the surface again, especially in Eugen Diederich’s journal Die Tat, and was taken up seriously by national political circles. Their revolution would be a conservative one ushering in a new German Utopia. Artur Moeller van den Bruck’s The Third Reich (1923) became one of the gospels of the new right during the Weimar years.^ Hitler’s Mein Kampf began to appear two years after The Third Reich Six years later Hitler came to power and his Thousand Year Third Reich was a poUtical reality. As has been seen, the concept of the Third Reich had a considerable literary and cultural history. In the same way, before the appearance of a literature which was identified with the NSDAP, there already existed a literature which helped to prepare for it and to estabUsh it once it became a political reaUty. It is, of course, fairly easy to characterise National SociaUst literature simply as racist, aimed primarily at the elimination of all Jewish elements.^ It is equally easy to divide literature and culture according to a rigid dichotomy of friend and foe, and Nazi commentators, literary historians and censors were wont to do just this. They approved of what was healthy, ethnic, heroic, instinctive and drawn from the organic folk-community and disapproved of the intellectual, sceptical, ironic, divisive culture of the big city with its suggestions of disease and decay. As early as the 1890s, Adolf Bartels divided literature into two ideological camps—a conservative folk camp and a hberal social-democratic camp, applying to the latter the term ‘decadent’. This approach was also adopted by Mahrholz in the 1920s when he spoke of a ‘Secret Germany’ reacting against the Naturalist spirit of enlightenment in the direction of a new mysticism.^ In his quest for a new Leader who would (Uke Luther) help build the ‘Third Reich’, he pointed to writers like Hermann Stehr and Hans Carossa. Mahrholz had absolutely no political aims in mind.\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\n1\n\nbut the proposition of the two Germanies looked different, when aprapos the Burning of the Books Paul Fechter wrote an essay on ‘The Change-over from One Literature to Another’ corresponding to the change-over from one Germany to another. Fhs view too was that there had been two Uteratures in Gennany for the previous twenty years. One of them could be called the ‘official’ literature, the Uterature of the middle-class left in all its many manifestations from the periphery of social democracy through to Communism. This was a false literature of psychology, ‘analysis’ and eroticism, a Uterature concentrating on problems which had no real Ufe outside of magazines with aesthetic pretensions. Alongside this false Uterature there was a second type, which was the real, truly German one, because it was not merely Uterature but art in the traditional German sense of the word. When the ‘official’ representatives claimed that the great German authors were called Remarque, Feuchtwanger, Heinrich Mann and Arnold Zweig, then the other Germans claimed that the people who really counted had quite different names and Uved in localities which were completely inaccessible to the representatives of official writing. When pressed they spoke of Paul Ernst and Hans Grimm, Hermann Stehr and WiU Vesper, Agnes Miegel and Peter Dorfler, Usting writers whose names were rarely heard. This was, as it were, a literature below the surface, an art of depth, which was there but yet not there, because the ‘people who mattered’ did not know about it. It was known to only a few people, and was far removed from the literary cliques of the big city. What Fechter claims here was of course not true; his truly German Art was not really an underground literature, nor was it widely ignored or passed over in silence; on the contrary publishers’ records show that some of it enjoyed massive sales and great popularity. Nevertheless, the resentment and sense of exclusion was real. What Fechter was doing was preparmg the way for a take-over bid, which would eliminate aU left-wmg, Jewish, democratic Uterature. He wanted to clear the way for a raciaUy and biologically based Uterature which would serve the NS cause. What was felt to be the most appropriate form of Uterature for the new Germany was the Uterature of the peasant. It was to this that the NS histories devoted the greater parts of their surveys. Literature of the city was not only decadent and rootless: it inevitably involved a demonstration of class conflict. Such conflict was to be removed from the literary scene and its place taken by the Germanic ideal of the harmonious society in which there was no longer bourgeois, peasant or worker, only a united foUc-community, not brothers or comrades in the Communist sense, but Germans in the harmony of one race. To\n\n8\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\nthis end the Third Reich attempted to construct a unified line of descent showing the inevitability of its own creation. Some of its roots it sought in German Romanticism, in Adam Muller, for example, or in Gorres, some a Uttle later in the national Wars of Liberation *in a , spokesman Hke E.M. Arndt. HolderUn was admired as the poet of the ‘Gesang des Deutschen’ (‘Hymn of the German’) with the much quoted first line; ‘Oh sacred heart of nations. Oh Fatherland’. He was quoted too as the poet of the greatest war poem in the German language, ‘Death for the Fatherland’.® Grabbe was resurrected as the dramatist who saw the problematic relationship between leader and people, while Hebbel was considered Nordic enough because he did make his way towards Germanic themes hke the Nibelungen. Wagner, of course, was proclaimed not only for his treatment of Germanic mythology, but also for his anti-Semitic essays, while Riehl was rediscovered as the first to make folk-orientated sociological surveys of the German people. There were in addition various anti-Uberal philosophers and thinkers who could be harnessed to the nationahst cause, not least Nietzsche, though he could only be selectively exploited as he was a known critic of German culture, an admirer of the French and denouncer of the Blond Beast. Much more influential were lesser hghts Hke Gobineau, Lagarde or Houston Stewart Chamberlain.^ Moeller van den Bruck churned out his thousands of pages about The Germans in which he elaborated his categories of national stereotypes, but much more important was his book with the prophetic title The Third Reich (1923). Attempts were made to demonstrate the perfect identity between the ‘German Socialism of Adolf Hitler and the Prussianism of Spengler’, but despite courting by Goebbels the author of The Decline of the West refused to join the party As far as literature was concerned, NS ideologues also found their way back to the so-called Homeland literature of the turn of the century: the Rembrandt-German Julius Langbehn, Friedrich Lienhard and Adolf Bartels.^ ^ Langbehn’s Rembrandt the Educator (1890) was an enormously successful book which went into many editions and sold thousands of copies. The prime aim of the book was cultural criticism. The Second Reich of Bismarck had demonstrated that economic and poUtical triumphs do not necessarily bring cultural success in their wake. It was necessary to prepare the path for the great German culture to come, one which would be truly representative of the Reich in aU spheres. Bismarck and Wilhelm II had created and consolidated the Second Reich, and for that they were to be praised, but a new kind of spiritual renewal was now required, one based on the small businesses of the\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\n9\n\nmiddle classes, on rootedness in the German region, indeed on all forces directed against the atomistic forces of capitaUsm and democracy. Rembrandt had been a great artist, but also a great low German, a realist and an ideaUst. This was the model for the future: Artist, peasant, king stand and faU together; they stand and faU with what man calls his homeland; and with what is for him the dearest thing in the world. Sick natures consider it a peculiarity of the ideal that it should be infinitely far away; and yet it is infinitely near: the homeland is the ideal! In this sense the German and (if you prefer) the Low German, is an especially ideal nature. What Rembrandt the Educator strove for was a union of petty bourgeois, peasant and the power centres of the Reich. The Rembrandt-German attacked UberaUsm as the party of progress and also positivistic science, in both of which could be detected the democratic, destructive spirit of the age which reduced everything and everybody to the same level. Rampant modem capitahsm was also a force for change, but attacks upon it were redirected against assimilated Jews and big-city parvenus. The crude cult of money was dismissed as something North American and Jewish, with Berlin falling more and more under its sway. The true German reader was invited to do something to purify the cesspool of the city. All in all the ideal held up was that of the corporative state, one which should be imposed upon the whole of Europe, so that Germany, once it had the power, would become the natural leader in a United States of Europe. (This latter idea was one of those ideals which the National SociaHsts with their incredible Uteral-mindedness were to prove only too eager to put into practice.^^) As far as literature was concerned, Rembrandt was on firmer ground when attacking than when making concrete proposals for the future. These were far from clear. What did emerge clearly was aggressiveness against Lessing and the whole of the Enhghtenment and the rejection of Zola and Natural¬ ism. This too was to become the official fine under National SociaUsm. As far as Naturahsm was concerned, Gerhart Hauptmann, its most celebrated exponent, had been officially honoured by the Weimar Republic, especially on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday in 1922. The celebrations lasted for four months, starting with the Gerhart Hauptmann Festival in Breslau at which the President of the RepubUc had given the address. In 1933 Hauptmann did net leave Germany, indeed he hastened to ingratiate himself with the new regime, echoed the government’s words when Germany left the League of Nations in\n\n10\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\nNovember 1933 and was present at the official opening of the Reichsschrifttumskammer.l ^ The Volkischer Beobachter, in an article of 16 November 1933, was ironic about Hauptmann’s readiness to give the Nazi salute and join in the singing of the Horst Wessel Song af a National Sociahst gathering. Despite this readiness he was categorised as ‘undesirable’ under the Third Reich, while his works were designated ‘unsuitable’ and frequently attacked. The Nazis knew that his Gleichschaltung was merely an external gesture, and they treated him and his works accordingly. Even before 1933, Hauptmann and Naturalism had been attacked. The arguments brought up against him, as against other Naturahsts like Sudermann and Holz, were always the same— Naturahsts were only good at being negative, or at accusing and criticising, they presented no ideals and in their creative works there were no heroes, they had nothing positive to offer, they gave no hope for the future. Besides, true German art could never be naturaUstic, as that had been the ‘Uterary manifestation of the positivistic, rationahstic age and therefore especially susceptible to Jewish inteUectuaUsm’. So, grand old men Uke Hauptmann could be exploited for propaganda purposes, especially towards the outside world, but they should not be allowed to enjoy any real acclaim inside National Sociahst Germany. Langbehn’s influence can be observed in Adolf Bartels who carried over the same basic attitudes towards the Enhghtenment and Natural¬ ism. One of the most influential forerunners of National SociaHsm, his histories of Uterature provided many of its basic attitudes. Hitler was personally deeply impressed by Bartels and visited him in Weimar in 1926. On the occasion of the author’s eightieth birthday in 1942, he made Bartels an honorary member of the NSDAP and awarded him the Golden Badge, given as a rule only to ‘old fighters’. Bartels was noted for his anti-Semitism, which he transported into the literary sphere and apphed with unheard-of viciousness and unrelenting hatred. There had been anti-Semitic utterances in German Uterature before in some of the Romantics, while in the latter half of the nineteenth century Freytag, the successful national-liberal noveUst, consistently brought comments about Jews into his works, often in a financial context. In the political sphere Ferdinand Lassalle, the organiser of the German working class, was among the first to be subjected to anti-Semitic attacks. Houston Stewart Chamberlain put these two elements of finance and Socialist poUtics together and associated them with one common enemy—the Jew. This was the combination which Bartels took over and appUed to Uterature, making the Jew a Uberal, a Sociahst and a capitaUstic exploiter at one and the same time. Like Langbehn\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\n11\n\nhis point of departure was criticism of the cultural situation in the Secend Empire. He denounced the 1870s as a corrupt Age of Journal¬ ism, and called for a spiritual renewal against the ‘decadence’ of liberal corruption and democracy, which he saw all around, and attributed especially to the Jews. Bartels’ approach was biological, appealing to national resentment against foreign cultural imports and seeking the seeds of cultural decline far back in the past, for example, in Jews like Heine. Capitalism according to him led to a lust for pleasure, the modern age was characterised by vulgar materialism and brought low by social democracy; hence its main characteristic was unhealthy pessimism and immorality. Wedekind was for Bartels ‘the height of late German decadence’. While this was the negative aspect of his cultural survey, he had a positive message to offer, because salvation was possible and could be achieved, if the trend to decadence were halted through a return to home art, which he saw as a source of regional pride, health and optimism. AH in all he saw himself as representing a return to ‘ideals in a particularly Germanic sense’, and put his ideals into practice in creative as weU as critical works. His most popular novel. The Dithmarshers, sold over 200,000 copies by 1928. Nor was he by any means a lone voice crying in the wilderness. Clubs and literary journals were normally associated with the Bohemian life of the despised cities, nevertheless nationalist circles did have them and Bartels found like-minded spirits in Ferdinand Avenarius, who published the Kunstwart, in Heinrich Sohnrey with his journal Das Land, in von Grotthuss with his Turmer and, most important of aU, in Friedrich lienhard, who became famous not only through his regional novels, but also through his pragmatic work The Predominance of Berlin, in which he denounced the decadent capital city and called for a return to the land. For various reasons, but basically because he was sincere and truly idealistic, his ‘back-to-the-land’ slogans were taken up by the Nazis, while lienhard himself, who had died in 1929, was left in comparative obscurity. What all of these forerunners and predecessors of National Socialism had in common was their regressive view of art. Modernism was rejected and instead the perspective was backward-looking: back to certain aspects of German Classicism (without its essential ingredients of humanity and Bildung): back to a selective vision of individualism (especially if this involved the great artist or the great leader): back to the post-revolutionary years of the 1850s in which Bartels could find figures like the Poetic Realist Otto Ludwig and the north German Hebbel to admire. The basic elements of this regressive view which\n\n12\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\nwere to become, through Bartels, the characteristic features of the coming fascist Uterature, were a pale surface realism and a classicistic monumentahsm. Anything non-German, like anything modern, was rejected. In the cultural sphere the National SociaHsts felt fortunate in having one giant from the nineteenth century they could claim as their own. Wagner was Romantic enough and volkisch enough to satisfy all their requirements. Houston Stewart Chamberlain had aheady shown the way by marrying into the family in order to get close enough to the master, and had started the cult of which Hitler himself was to become a follower. Bayreuth was declared a national shrine and Wagner exploited to educate Germans to the Nazi version of the Volksgemeinschaft. He was the ideal combination of artist and musician, spiritual and poUtical leader, and of course he was an out¬ spoken anti-Semite. Wagner developed the world of Germanic mythology, he presented Germanic heroes, and according to Rosenberg, he expressed the Nordic soul, the Nordic ideal of beauty, the power of the will, the struggle for greatness and honour. Wagner offered not only heroes but also villains in a maimer which was to be followed by the Friend-or-Foe Nazi manner of thinking. The authoritarian pretensions, the romantic allusion to a classless people’s community and the clear portrayal of a timeless villain (made possible only by means of the myth) were combined in the music-dramatic offering of serious combat and mahcious joy —the model for the Unter- and Ubermensch relationship.^\"^ Here as elsewhere the Nazis were appropriating Germany’s cultural heritage for their own purposes. Wagner in fact was a modernist, he was decadent, he was certainly more of a pessimist than a happy optimist and it was crude manipulation to take him over as a pioneer of National SociaHsm; nevertheless there was enough there for the Nazis to work on, even to the forebodings of universal destruction and suggestions that ‘the Third Reich had to be destroyed hke the epic hero Siegfried’. Yet it must not be thought that there was no support for Bartels’ view or that by eUminating so much he left too Uttle. It is only too easy in any time in any country to marshal popular support for denunciations of modern art as difficult and dangerous, shapeless and decadent, yet this was no mere poHtical ploy for the National Socialists, it was consistent with their basic beUefs. The National\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\n13\n\nSocialists made themselves into a mass party by competing with the Soc^iaUsts, the Communists and the National and Centre parties to gain the support of blue-coUar and white-collar workers and country people. To this end they were prepared to engage in tactical manoeuvres. In the same way, in the literary sphere, National Socialists saw them¬ selves as a movement of cultural revolution and some were tempted to ahgn themselves with the radical avant-garde. It was at this point that Expressionism nearly became the style of the party. However, it was only by turning to the traditional Uterature of the regions that the Nazis could hope for mass support and this is what they did. Besides, literary regression into biological and mythical zones could satisfy aU that the NS ideology required of an art form. In the village and in the mral community SociaUsm had never really put down roots and it was there that feelings ran high about threatened possessions and the defence of what one owned. Not all regional literature of the homeland is fascist and in this genre Germany like other countries had some fine novels, of which Wilhelm von Polenz’ The Biittnerbauer is a good example. What such works had to offer was rootedness and permanence as against the restlessness of the modem age. Capitalism broke down age-old rules governing man’s relationship with his work and his place in society. This was particularly noticeable in the countryside, where certain traditions and ways of Ufe had tended to continue unchanged for centuries. Freedom of movement and the flight from the land to the cities had meant therefore not only the sudden appearance in Germany of massive conurbations, but the dissolution of bonds which had for centuries been thought of as indissoluble. Many people, the rich as weU as the poor, the feudal landlord as well as the serf, felt uneasy about such drastic changes and longed for an assurance, even if only in the illusory form of literature, of some permanence amid a world of change. Hence literature of the homeland was welcomed in many quarters for its sense of intimacy with the surroundings in which one had grown up, and for its feehng of security far removed from the social and political conflicts and contradictions of the modem world. At the same time such tales were by no means harmless, for they often included an invitation to be ready to fight for what was one’s own. Moving back from the city to the land meant by no means a return to a completely idyUic, pastoral, harmonious age, for the peasant Like the soldier had to be shown as able to defend himself and his native land—with his blood if necessary. From the start, then, this kind of regressive Uterature could also be extremely aggressive. Nor was Uterature of this kind confined to Germany, as names like Giono,\n\n14\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\nTimmermanns and Maurice BarrSs indicate, though it was generally to the Nordic countries that National Socialist Germany was to look for the kind of books it could admire Trygve Gulbranssen was among the most widely read authors in the Third Reich, though he never’ declared his allegiance to it. The Icelandic writer Guimar Gunriarson received rave notices in Germany, especially after 1934 when he came out pubhcly in favour of the new regime. In 1937 he received the Henrik Steffens Prize from the city of Hamburg and in 1940 after a tour through Germany with the Swedish authoress Clara Nordstrom and the Dutch authoress Jo van Ammers-KiiUer, he was received in Berhn by the Fiihrer. Knut Hamsun was equally active in his support of the Third Reich. After 1933 his works were given an enthusiastic reception in Germany and he was always lavishly praised as the true friend of Germany. He made many pubhc statements in favour of the Third Reich, even defended the German invasion of Norway, declared Norwegian resistance to be senseless, came out in favour of Quisling and advocated a Europe under German leadership, fighting against England. For Vesper he was ‘the greatest epic writer of our time’. The novel was not the only traditional genre honoured and revered by the National Socialists. The ballad in Germany had long clung to its mythical origins and so it too, with its laconic language, its sense of fateful inevitabiUty and its love of death, was bound to appeal to the new nationaUstic wave. Wedekind and Brecht attempted to demonstrate that the baUad form could develop in different directions, by exploiting the demotic language of the cities, but this was totally rejected as un-German in nationaUstic circles and the trend backwards through the nineteenth century and beyond was preferred. The traditional baUad enjoyed a striking revival with Borries von Miinchhausen, Agnes Miegel and Lulu von Strauss und Tomey as its leading exponents. AU figured prominently on the literary scene in the Third Reich. But by far the greatest popularity was achieved by the work of another author from this sphere of traditional Uterature of the German region, namely Hermann Lons. Today he is remembered for his simple, folksy poetry, far removed from any sphere of ideological conflict, though he was also the author of the anti-British song, ‘Denn wir fahren gegen Engelland’, sung in both world wars. Apart from this he survives in the song-books with verses about the German countryside, hunting and the simple Ufe of the soldier. When he moved on from poetry and song to the more extended narrative, a further ideological element was added: the marriage between ancient nobility and ancient\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\n15\n\npeasantry. The Wehrwolf (1910) shows this most clearly. This novel, whigh Walter Linden rightly described as the basic book of the Volk movement, provided the model and the behavioural patterns for the nationahstic Freikorps groups and Feme murderers of the post-World War One period. It gave the vblkisch youth groups their symbol and furnished Hitler Youth fighters in the final stages of the Second World War with their name. This was a novel which exercised a far-reaching impact of a kind which it would be hard to overestimate. It had sold some 565,000 copies by 1939, (375,000 of these by 1933). The theme of the novel is the action taken by peasants against marauding soldiers and looters in the Thirty Years War. Lest there be any possible mis¬ understandings the peasants are shown as in no way comparable with revolutionaries. This is done by portraying them as far removed from the ranks of the propertyless proletariat. Only those who own land and their followers are allowed to join the exclusive ranks of the Wehrwolves. In addition the Wehrwolves are careful to ensure the approval of both their prince and their church for their actions, thereby marking what they do as entirely legitimate and praiseworthy. The peasant (the novel demonstrates) is more than a man whose life is devoted to making the soil fruitful for his kith and kin: he must also be capable of defending his land against attack. In the same way the priest, whom the Wehrwolves acquire in the course of time, is more than a mere preacher of the gospel of peace; he too must be shown to be capable of fighting and indeed killing if necessary. The essential elements in Blood and Soil literature have been described as, firstly, settlement, and, secondly, aggression in defence of the settlement. This is the basic pattern to this novel. The first chapter is devoted to the peasants of the heath, who in far distant times came down from the north with their pale faces and blond hair, found a place and built a house, before clearing the land and fighting with the bears and the dark brown people who Uved in the swamp. Time passes until the year 1623 is reached and there is talk of war. War, hunger, fire and pestilence come upon the land, and the point is reached when the peasants have to take a decision on their own behalf. One of them puts the question of defending the homeland this way: Any gypsies or other foreign folk that put in an appearance here will immediately be greeted with the whip, for that rabble shows the robbers (for that’s aU the soldiers are) where there’s something to steal. In Ehlershausen last week two of these fellows who stole a\n\n16\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany horse from the field were quietly strung up. And that is absolutely right: because first of all they are not real people and besides why don’t they stay where they belong? «\n\n4\n\nThe language is that of the vigilante who takes the law into his own hands. This in any event is the policy which is adopted, the ideology of encirclement, the poHcy of the white man’s laager defending the kraal against all comers. All agree to stick together and Wulf uses, for the first time, the phrase, which he will repeat many times thereafter: ‘before I let anybody touch a hair of my head, or that of any of my people. I’d rather wade up to my ankles in blood’. Before the end of the book he will be wading that deep in blood. KiUing is continuous, and the score is kept by cutting notches on the handle of one’s weapon. By now the peasants have had to withdraw into the rough country to build a defensive position, an oath is sworn and the magic number of initiates elected. It must not be thought that such a novel is completely devoid of love interest. It soon becomes clear that the role in life of the Germanic lady is to be faithful and true to her warrior-peasant husband, to be a good housewife and good mother. A great deal of breeding goes on, though the love scenes tend to be pure and sentimental rather than erotic or stimulating. The close-knit community continues to thrive, because there are no divisions among them, they are a community of industrious people, aU working for themselves and at the same time working for the whole. Only the external world is against them, but though they kill constantly, no blame attaches to them. This is con¬ firmed by their padre, who tells them their consciences are clear, and by the Duke, who also recognises that what the peasants are doing is right and proper; indeed he even rewards them for their bravery and commends them as a model to be followed by everybody. The basic appeal of the novel is its combination of killers’ lust and legitimacy. And clearly, from the way the novel is told, its message is not meant to be limited to the seventeenth century, but rather is clearly intended as a model for the problems of the modem world. The last words of the novel express pleasure at the election of a peasant to the Reichstag, but the whole thrust of the novel is not directed towards the solution of social and political problems by means of parliamentary processes: the examples given on page after page are examples of collective aggression. The effect of such a novel was considerable —through the agency of the right-wing publishers Eugen Diederichs this Peasants’ Chronicle sold in hundreds of thousands. Its simple message\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\n17\n\nexpressed in simple language, its sentimentality and its crude frontier humour made it irresistible fare for many. Lons himself followed his own doctrine, joined up as soon as the war broke out and was killed in September 1914, but not before he had launched an appeal for a hero who would emerge from the masses to save the German nation and lead it to triumph.!^ Paul Ernst did not have the same mass effect, yet he too was recognised by the National Socialists as one of their forerunners and admired and propagandised accordingly. He attempted the regional novel without great success and passed through a period of social concern and naturaHstic endeavour before finding his true home finally in historical epics and dramas of the most formal and traditional kind, offering nobdity, leadership and a tragic awareness of fate. Ernst’s classicism was of the monumental kind that the National Socialists could admire. In the long article in the Volkischer Beobachter in which Dr Rainer Schlosser attempted to sketch the duties of a National Sociahst theatre, he called for both heroic and folksy plays and he named Johst’s Schlageter and Paul Ernst’s comedy Pantalon and his Sons the cornerstones of an ideal NS repertoire. Paul Ernst declared himself a National Socialist just after the seizure of power and shortly before he died.^^ The difference between Lons and Paul Ernst and the Hterature which followed the First World War was that now radical nationalism existed in real pofitical terms and that literature as a whole tended to be politicised. What had emerged from the war was a republic, which could never be accepted in nationalist quarters, hence traditional anti-democratic sentiments were now aggravated by the military defeat, by the revolution, and by the upsurge of Socialist forces which apparently divided it. The front-line fighters saw themselves deprived of the fruits of victory, deprived of the honour and glory they felt was rightly theirs and confronted by an entirely different social and political situation from the one they had left behind when they set off for the trenches. It is true there was still military work for them to do in the Freikorps and home guard groups, and to some extent the Weimar government itself directed such forces against the revolutionaries, but this was stiU not what they had hoped for and clearly it could not last. War had been their life and it is not surprising that the 1920s saw a spate of war books glorifying the new German who (it was claimed) had emerged from the cauldron of war. On the surface many such war books by front-line soldiers seem mere documentary accounts, but it quickly becomes clear that they were more than that, for they were\n\n18\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\nfilled with hatred for the post-war Germany with whose compMcations their authors found themselves incapable of coping. The general tendency of such books was to concentrate exclusively on the war itself, reducing the world to the front line as the only place where a man could show his worth. There in the midst of death, life had been lived to the full, boredom was unknown. In these works the Germany of before the war simply did not exist or was shown as something dead and mechanical, behind the front the homeland was exploited by crooks and profiteers, poHtics was a dirty, corrupt game, the country was divided by competition and class warfare. How much better everything could be made to appear at the front, where, as in the brotherhood of the Wehrwolves, it was all for one and one for aU. At the front there was a real basis for collective action, there it was possible to find a model of true popular spirit and comradeship. In this kind of front-line community relationships were clearly fixed by the authority of the leader over his men. All became part of a greater whole, a team which alone was capable of ensuring the survival and ultimate victory of each of its members. This kind of appeal was clearly directed at the masses who were to be won over from the counter-attractions of the Marxist models of collective action and it must be said that such works were not without their successes. National Socialism set out to be a mass movement and this was one of the methods it used to attract the masses. The war had demonstrated its own kind of SociaHsm, a SociaUsm of a national, not a poHtical or proletarian kind, a Socialism which set out to mobiUse the nation totally for the war effort. Making the worker into a soldier was the equivalent of making the peasant into a soldier—as in the Wehrwolf. If, despite the later translation of the ethos and symbols of the Wehrwolf'mio the reality of National SociaUst Germany, it is thought that there is too great a gap between the novel and the party, an even better example is provided by another novel, namely Hermann Burte’s Wiltfeber, the Eternal German. The Story of a Man Seeking his Home¬ land (1912), which not only combined Nietzschean ideas with volkisch ideology and the message of the pure Krist (a Germanic version of Christianity of an anti-Semitic kind), but also provided the regime with one of its most important symbols. After a scene in this historical novel in which the decUne of true Germanic blood is sketched in (‘there are more genuine Jews around than there are genuine blond people’), in an age in which the blood-leader is replaced by an elected bureaucrat, the Germanic hero Wiltfeber makes his stand:\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\n19\n\nAnd Wiltfeber stood in the dusty street and with his stick he drew a cfoss of St John in the dust, Ughtly and loosely. And then he drew in the half cross more strongly and lo, there in the sand with high¬ lights and shadows was the ancient Hakenkreuz. The Knight spat blood from his Ups and said; ‘Do you beUeve in it? What if it were to come to Ufe again?’^^ In fact it was to come to Ufe quite soon, for in the course of the abortive Kapp Putsch in March 1920 Captain Erhard’s naval Freikorps hoisted the swastika over BerUn. The hooked cross had a vast history which had been described by Guido list in 1910 in a book caUed The Hieroglyphs of the Ario-Teutons. After that this symbol of fire and sun and salvation came to be used increasingly by pan-German pagan societies and anti-Semitic groups. Three months after the abortive Putsch Hitler appropriated the swastika as the flag of his party, just as he appropriated the concept of the Third Reich. In Mein Kampf the three Imperial colours were reinterpreted as foUows: The red reflects the sociaUst, the white the nationalist ideas of the movement, the (black) Swastika symboUses the mission of the struggle for the victory of Aryan man and simultaneously the victory of the idea of creative work which itself has always been anti-semitic and wUl remain anti-semitic for ever more.^® Burte was to become one of the leading Uterary figures during the NS regime. His career was assured. In one of his poems on the role of the poet, he wrote the Unes: Help native blood Home to its own soul! Impart courage to the downhearted, courage. What they need are words of command! In a sUghtly later historical novel Artur Dmter attempted to help native blood find the way back to its own soul. His novel The Sin against the Blood (1922) recounts the story of Hermarm, who faUs passionately in love with Johanna and persuades her to marry him.^l The resultant marriage is not a happy one, although she does everything that could be expected of the perfect wife. Johanna has a past which comes to light when she gives birth to her husband’s child. To his horror it turns out to be a Jewish child with black curly hair and a\n\n20\n\nThe Weimar Republic’s Secret Germany\n\nswarthy skin. She then confesses that ten years before she had been seduced by a Jewish officer and subsequently deserted. The child she bore then died at birth, nevertheless Hermann’s child looks like her first child. This puzzle is resolved when Hermann discovers the breeding law that any thoroughbred mare is ruined if it has once been mated with an inferior partner. The whole organism of the thorough¬ bred is poisoned. The consequences of this insight form the moral of the book: Now consider the damage which year in, year out, is infiicted upon the German race by Jewish youths who every year seduce thousands upon thousands of German maidens! Hermann immediately demands the name and regiment of the Jewish officer from his wife, goes straight to him to demand satisfaction in a duel and when this is refused, shoots him on the spot. No one attempts to stop him as he leaves and when he gets home he finds his wife and child both dead, the morphia needle still sticking in the region of her heart. This novel was to become one of the most praised works during the NS period, although Dinter did not enjoy the glorious Uterary career he might have expected.^^\n\nTHE MAKING OF A PEOPLE 4\n\nAnti-Semitism was not an ever present element in the works of the forerunners of National Sociahsm, for there were also other ‘inferior’ races, as was often demonstrated by authors from the periphery of the German-speaking world. One such was more con¬ cerned about the Slavs than the Jews: Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer survived the collapse of the Nationahst SociaHst regime. ^ To the end he never saw any necessity to revise his opinions or to doubt in any way the intellectual path which had led him to accept Adolf Hitler and ‘the movement’ as the solution to Germany’s problems. Clearly he was a writer rather than a poHtician and he can perhaps be excused for failing to see the implications of the nationahst line he personally followed and also advocated in his novels, dramas, poetry and pamphlets. Bom in Bohemia, he saw at an early age the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the rise of the mhitant Slav. The German language, the one single factor which seemed to hold the whole rambling Empire together, was forced to give way to Czech as the language of administration. For him this seemed to mark the begin¬ ning of the end of the Sudeten Germans. In fact the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was to take another fifty years, but nevertheless his basic attitudes were formed at an early age —the desire to preserve the German language and resentment against the Slavs, combined with longing for a greater German fatherland. little wonder that the Anschluss with Austria, which Hitler brought about, was welcomed by such people. When Kolbenheyer started his career as an author he was the typical apoHtical German intellectual; however, he was bom into an age in which the world of aesthetics was being radically poUticised and he gradually moved further and further to the right, in what was to become a characteristic manner for the time. The frontiersman became more German than the Germans, living in Germany after the war he found the repubhc less than satisfying and was soon denouncing the shortcomings of the parUamentary system. His position has been described as close to that of Thomas Marm’s Reflections of an Unpolitical Man. They shared the same rejection of democracy, ostentatious conservatism, beUef in a German mission for Europe, dependence on Nietzsche as a model of the precarious and paradoxical radical conservative, approval of the war mania of July 21\n\n22\n\nThe Making of a People\n\n1914 in Germany, insistence on a powerful Germany as a pre-condition for European peace, a metaphysical conception of the Volk, a tendency to equate Goethe with Bismarck, a view of the leader as exponent of the people, and an admiration of the German performance in war. Yet although Kolbenheyer and Mann both started off expressing beliefs of this kind, Thomas Mann was to develop into a strong defender of the republic and an enemy of National SociaUsm, while Kolbenheyer was to come more and more to denounce the one and acclaim the other. Probably the difference between them lay in the very fact that Kolbenheyer was a border German. As Kolbenheyer the Sudeten German saw the Slavs as the enemy, this made him only too ready to accept nationalistic concepts. But Kolbenheyer was a true intellectual who had studied philosophy, psychology and natural sciences. He was no crude racist: instead he attempted to apply biological concepts to problems of social and cultural history and as a result developed a vast historical panorama, in the manner of the time, which he called the Bauhutte - Elements of a Metaphysic of the Present (1925). At the core of this philosophy Kolbenheyer sees something he calls Plasma, the fundamental stuff of Ufe; from this, through the plant, animal and human world, he builds up a universal picture embracing races and people, but also famihes and individuals. The heart of the matter, however, is the ‘white race’ and the need for the young and healthy (Germanic) race to take over the leadership from the old and exhausted (Romance-Mediterranean) race: what he demonstrates in mystical pseudo-scientific terms is Volkwerdung, the ineluctable progress of a race like the Aryans to leadership and maturity. Mysticism, soul, heart, Hfe he conceives of as characteristic elements of the German race; civiUsation, the profit-motive, quantification and logic he rejects as un-German, and his projection of such quaUties on to an external enemy (be it Jewish, Mediterranean or Slav) was to prove only too ‘convergent’ with the NS ideology. Indeed it has been pointed out that what Kolbenheyer claimed as the first true and correct view of history was an almost direct forerunner of Rosenberg’s Myr/z of the Twentieth Century.^ Kolbenheyer’s pohtical activity was mainly in the twenties and thirties when in many essays and pamphlets he propagated the national revolution, but his major essays. The Biological Foundations of the Liberation Move¬ ment in the People (1933) and The National Revolution and the Revival of the German Spirit (1933) give some indication by their titles alone of the thrust of his biological view.3 By 1932 he had joined the NSDAP, because it meant for him Uberation from the\n\nThe Making of a People\n\n23\n\nclaims of Versailles and also the possibility of a greater Germany. Gerrhans inside Germany itself were in his view much less aware of the biological imbalance than were the Germans outside. Hitler’s poUtical actions did justice to what for Kolbenheyer were the natural facts. Hitler came from the Austrian border, and so he could see things from the outside. His whole hfe was devoted to Germany as a whole. It has been argued that the difference between Hitler and aU other nationalist extremists lies in the importance he placed on the German/Austrian Slav frontier and the conclusions he drew from his awareness of it. This was certainly what appealed to Kolbenheyer. It did not make him an out-and-out supporter of the party or the regime—he was too much of an individualist for that, yet he was prepared to go a long way in his polemics against the opposition, attacking Romain Rolland, defend¬ ing the burning of books, and repeating his conviction that German nationahsm was only the preliminary stage on the way towards the ideal of a Europe united under German leadership. In time Kolbenheyer became ‘the figurehead of Nazi cultural support for the Sudeten Germany’ by accepting the presidency of the Sudeten German Cultural Society. This meant that to some extent he was in a position to help some Hterary colleagues who fell foul of the regime. So, for example, in 1933 he was able to effect the release from Dachau of Karl Broger, the worker-poet whose poems about the cameraderie of the First World War the Nazis exploited. But there can be no suggestion that he in any way acted against the regime or engaged in any kind of resistance. In effect he supported the Hitler regime right up to 1945, though he claimed afterwards to have been totally unaware of the horrendous crimes committed in the name of National Sociahsm. He himself was never anti-Semitic and said he knew nothing of the poUcy directed at the extermination of the Jews. Without doubt it was Kolbenheyer’s Sudetenland background combined with his ‘biologically’ based ultra-nationaHst beliefs which led him into the National Socialist camp. At the same time he was sensitive, as were so many of the nationalist writers, about what he felt was the lack of recognition afforded Iris works (despite all the prizes) and was prepared to engage in practically any ideological contortion in order to prove that the National Socialist ideology accorded with his own, if this meant he could gain the recognition he felt he rightly deserved. His Bauhutte philosophy had not brought enough recognition, nor had his novels and plays, though much admired, brought him the wider recognition he sought So perhaps, when he felt his creative powers decline, he moved more into the directly political sphere. It cannot be\n\n24\n\nThe Making of a People\n\nsaid to have been to his ultimate advantage. Certainly his reputation as a writer now remains severely tarnished and few will be prepared today to give serious consideration to the once much-acclaimed Paracelsus trilogy which projected its hero as a genius and artist, whose hfe and work, culminating in the ‘Third Reich of Paracelsus’, sums up the ‘German’ values of depth of feeling, rehgiosity and strength. Another writer equally rooted in the cultural traditions of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and one destined to become just as much of a pan-German nationalist as Kolbenheyer, was Josef Weinheber. At first sight this prophet of pure form and poetry seems the last person one would expect to find among the uniformed ranks of the brown-shirted barbarians; yet he claimed to have been converted to National Socialism at an early stage and he certainly remained one of its most prominent figureheads on the cultural stage right to the very end. Like many of his generation he went through a Nietzschean phase with ‘pride in loneliness, delight in perverse evil and affirmation of life’, yet the working-class young man trying to make his way in the world of letters never really had the strength, confidence or social poise to put these ideals into practice. What he clearly wanted more than anything else was acceptance, recognition and fame. As an Austrian he shared some of Hitler’s cultural background and certainly developed one feature associated with Hitler’s Austria, namely anti-Semitism. Like many he also felt excluded by the ‘other’ literature: indeed it was only with the national revival in 1933 that his eventual breakthrough came. By that time Weinheber had connections with the Austrian NSDAP, though as a party it was still illegal, because it threatened the stability of the Austrian repubUc.'^ His collection of poems Nobility and Decline betrays no direct references to events of the time, and yet the divisions of the collection were remarkably consonant with Nazi tastes, especially the grandiose classicism of his verses on classical models, his variations on the Nazi favourite Holderlin, his attempts at the ‘pure poem’, and his ‘Hymn to the German Language’.^ Weinheber specialised in denunciations of the decadence of the age, from which the poet withdraws into isolation or against which he reacts with existential heroism. In effect Weinheber shared the reactionary distaste for democracy, disliked the republic, developed an extremely nationahstic view of German culture, and was anti-Socialist and ambitious. Will Vesper took up his work, and by March 1935 Weinheber was being invited to give broadcasts on the German radio. His longing for recognition in Germany and not merely in Austria was about to be more than satisfied. He received an\n\nThe Making of a People\n\n25\n\nhonorary doctorate, he was awarded the title of professor by the Austrian government, he was awarded the Mozart Prize and he visited Germany where he met Kolbenheyer, with whom he had much in common. Not surprisingly the butcher’s son from the city bought a house in the country and attempted to show by his poetry that he too was rooted in the soil. Yet it was not for this kind of poetry that he became widely known or famous, but rather for Wien wortlich, a cycle of poems about the ancient city of Vienna. Weinheber set his sights very high. Repudiating competitors like RQke, George, Hofmann¬ sthal and Werfel, he strove to raise himself to the level of the great masters of the past by taking as literary models the Greek, Latin and Itahan verses of Sappho, Alcaeus, Homer, Horace, Dante and Michelangelo, and the works of German authors who had preceded him—Holderlin, Morike, Droste-Hulshoff and Goethe. Weinheber had in other words a fixed idea of what constituted real poetry, and aspired to reach it by imitation. In such an age, however, it was impossible to withdraw into the timeless sphere of pure poetry, and so he also wrote a hymn in praise of the Anschluss, various poems to the Fiihrer, and a ‘Hymn to the Munitions Worker’.^ His Nietzschean love of what was great and his amoral love of grandeur for its own sake led the ‘pure’ poet to commit himself totally to National Socialism, despite or perhaps even because of the ruthlessness and brutality of it. Here at last was the oneness of the Volk he looked for, uniting German and Austrian. History was being made and he was part of it. Politics meant something other than party political manoeuvring. The Volk had spoken as one. His ‘Hymn to the Home-coming’ was written for the celebrations for Hitler’s birthday, held in the Burgtheater in Vienna on 20 April 1938; it consists largely of a comparison between Hitler’s return to Austria and Odysseus’ return to his beloved Ithaca after long years of wandering. It concludes: This in the name of the people! This in the name of the blood! This in the name of suffering: Germany, eternal and great, Germany, we greet you! Fiihrer, sacred and strong, Fiihrer, we greet you! Homeland, happy and free. Homeland, we greet you!\n\n26\n\nThe Making of a People\n\nThe Volk, the blood, the Fuhrer, Germany, the homeland—this is Nazi language unadorned. With poems like this and his ‘Austria 1934’ he ‘prostituted his honour in the cause of political murderers and black¬ mailers’.^ He was not an unworldly ideaUst who could be exploited by , the Nazis for propaganda purposes: he was a reaUst determined to demonstrate his poHtical reliabiUty to the new masters. Needless to say he was not completely blind, yet such criticism of the movement as he expressed from time to time tended to be after the manner of the believer rather than the doubter, admitting that foreigners were perhaps right to describe the National SociaUsts as barbarians, but claiming that this was because they could be aware only of the external trappings of the national upsurge, not of its essence and true nature. Similarly, the Austrian in him felt some resentment from time to time at German interference in Austrian matters, but this did not stop him from penning a panegyric when the insignia of the Empire, the supreme symbols of Austria’s cultural heritage, were removed from Vienna by the new German masters and taken to Nuremberg. The declaration of war indissolubly linked Austria’s fate with that of Germany, and Weinheber’s Uterary destiny even more with victory for the regime. The war for him was not about mere conquest, but about the survival of the white race, the triumph of the German cultural mission. Throughout the course of the war, nevertheless, Weinheber avoided all jingoistic poetry and instead devoted himself to what seemed on the surface much loftier ideals. In the same way as he had previously appeared as the poet of pure form, so now he strove to cultivate the word m its purest form. The lofty, almost biblical ring of the title, //ere is the Word, gives some idea of his intentions. In this he is in line with a powerful German tradition from the turn of the century on, marking a reaction against the abuse of language in the age of mass communications (not least in the Journalistic language of newspapers) and the distortion of language by mass pohtical parties. But Weinheber, who felt he had a special relationship with Goebbels, was clearly not one to see direct applications of his critique of language to an expose of the propagandistic distortions of National Socialism: his linguistic theories are more in line with those of a Jiinger. In the volume Leaves and Stones (1934) lunger’s essay ‘In Praise of Vowels’ appeared. This was an exercise which had been attempted elsewhere (notably by Rimbaud), but in this case the outcome was rather different. Rainer Stollmarm uses this example as the climax and culmination to his book on ‘the aestheticisation of poHtics’.® Weinheber’s exercises in the irmer form of the word, or the symbolic\n\nThe Making of a People\n\n27\n\nsignificance of particular letters of the alphabet, are somewhat similar, and by no means stop him from finding reasons for extreme nationaUsm. As Ridley points out, in an earlier collection like Nobility and Decline it was but a small step from the ‘Ode to the Letter of the Alphabet’ to the ‘Hymn to the German Language’ and later, in the lectures on language which he gave to students at the University of Vienna, he still found reasons for the defence of Blood and Soil writing. Significantly, language was for Weinheber not a means of communication, but a mystical entity expressive of an immutable racial essence; and this mystical essence was essential for the war effort, for ultimately in ‘loyalty to the German language lay the only true hope of victory’.^ By the end Weinheber found himself more directly involved with the struggle for German victory than he had expected would be necessary for a German poet. By 1944 the war was going so badly that all belletristic publications were banned and his Here is the Word could not be printed. Air raids destroyed the stocks of his other works, while he himself daily expected to be called to military or munitions service. By the end of 1944 the man who in the First World War had somehow escaped mihtary training or service at the front was in the Volkssturm, and when the Russian tanks reached his village the following year he took an overdose of morphia and died: it is not clear whether this was by mistake because he was an addict, whether in terror at the thought of falling into Russian hands, or in despair at the collapse of the regime, to which he had become too closely attached. A remarkable number of people are still sufficiently impressed by Weinheber’s formal talents to think of him as a real poet. A writer from an entirely different part of the German-speaking world, but one nevertheless whose extreme patriotism and love of the German soil led him into close contact with National Socialism, was Hans Grimm. This author’s real life took him outside Germany to the colonies and yet his Uterary life was to become intimately bound up with Germany itself, with the nationalist movement, with Blood and Soil and with National Socialism. After leaving Germany Hans Grimm lived for years in South Africa as trader, farmer, reporter and writer. He also lived later in German South West Africa. On his return to Germany he bought the lippoldsberg Cloister House and made it into a national literary and cultural centre. Grimm was a prolific writer and the complete edition of his works contains dramas, stories and novels as well as collections of essays. Of particular interest is his African narrative The Judge in the Kara (1926), not only for its style and African background, but also for the author’s fairly explicit\n\n28\n\nThe Making of a People\n\nstatement of his belief in the superiority of the white race over the black. However, his most successful book was his massive novel of 1,300 pages called People without Living Space (1926). The title was immediately taken up and exploited as a poUtical slogan by the National Socialists, although Adolf Hitler was more interested in Lebensraum in the East and had no desire at that time to become involved with England, the world power, over colonial demands. Nevertheless the whole concept appealed to the ultra-nationahst factions in Germany. As F.L. Carsten has put it:\n\n,\n\nOf all the political slogans current in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, none exercised a stronger influence on the youth of the country in school and university than that which proclaimed that Germany needed more space, that the nation—to be able to live — required more Raum. Deprived of its colonial empire by the Treaty of Versailles without any justification—thus the young were taught in the German schools—the Germans had become a Volk ohne Raum, a nation without hving space.^^ This message is explicitly proclaimed by the author in the very first chapter of the book, entitled ‘Homeland and Constriction’. In his own rather pretentious and inflated style the author appeals to all German men and women, boys and girls of all classes and walks of Ufe to raise their arms to God, so that together in their millions He may be made aware of the horrific nature of the German fate. This will be revealed through the story of one simple German whose fate will be representative for that of His people. To answer any superior doubter who might claim that the German people will always Uve, he then examines more closely what is meant by Hving. The sick man Uves, the thief Uves, the whore Hves and worm eats worm—‘but the German needs Hving space around him and sun above him and freedom inside him, in order to become good and fine. Is he to have waited centuries in vain for it?’ The hero of Volk ohne Raum, CorneHus Friebott, is a Low German, born (as Lulu von Strauss und Torney was to put it) in the most German part of the country and by the most German river, the Upper Weser. He shares the typical fate of the landworker of the end of the nineteenth century through being forced to tear up his roots in the soil and move into the big city. Where this leads is shown by the fact that he is no longer involved m healthy work, but instead is subject to the machine. He declines into a worker, a member of the proletariat, and even goes so far as to desert his peasant background\n\nThe Making of a People\n\n29\n\ncompletely and become involved with the Sociahsts! As a result of activities on behalf of the Social Democrats he is dismissed and is sentenced to imprisonment. At this point he leaves this Germany of class warfare and emigrates to South Africa, which proves to be a land of opportunity for a German like himself who is prepared to work hard. He joins the Boer Army to fight against the British, is wounded, captured and imprisoned. This whole section of the book, needless to say, not only provides plenty of adventure and excitement, but also permits the author to express his resentment against the colonial, imperiahst British, who treat Germans as second-class citizens. Further excitement comes when the hero moves to the new German colony, fights the Hottentots, prospers on a farm and makes money in the diamond rush. This whole wonderful world collapses on the outbreak of the World War, when he is again exposed to rough treatment at the hands of the British authorities. Indeed he is even sentenced to death merely for kiUing an African in self-defence; but he escapes from British territory to Portuguese Angola, is re-arrested and finally shipped back to Germany. By this time the war is over and he finds his home¬ land in a depressed, defeated state and makes it his duty to tour Germany, conveying to his countrymen the message of Lebensraum. During one of his speeches caUing upon Germany to awaken he is killed by a stone thrown by a worker in the crowd. His message is taken up, however, by the author Hans Grimm, who from the very first page figures prominently in the novel; the book is written to carry on the torch from the point where Comehus Friebott was violently forced to put it down. There is no doubt whatsoever that this blockbuster of a book is a ‘good read’. For one thing it is almost dehberately not modern or difficult in its style, for another Grimm has a great deal of natural, narrative drive, and he teUs a good, adventurous yarn, setting it against an exotic background. It is true there are many digressions and the author tends to preach at his readers; but there is also no doubt that it was as much the message as the story that made the book seU in hundreds of thousands of copies. According to Carsten it had reached the hah\" miUion mark before 1938, and even after the Second World War it was still selling weU, though sales have now declined and the whole ethos of the book has dated. Grimm, the out¬ spoken exponent of colonial imperiahsm, was quite clear in his own mind about the superiority of the Nordic Herrenvolk over other inferior races, and it was this racism which was quickly identified and praised by Nazi critics in the 1930s.\n\n30\n\nThe Making of a Peop le Hans Grimm shows the particular difficulties which ensue for the worthy Germans as against other colonial peoples, quite simply from the superiority of the race . . . Volk ohne Raum belongs among those works in our literature which will last and in which rnost , distant generations will experience the tme nature of the people, the eternal power of its being and the voice of its blood, shuddering before the weight and magnitude of its Fate.^^\n\nAn early doctoral dissertation which examined Grimm as one who ‘prepared the way for the Nordic view’ came to the conclusion that the political ideas of Adolf Hitler and Hans Grimm converged at four main points: in the general question of race, in the particular question of the place of the Jews, in the stress given to the significance of the Aryan as Nordic man, and finally in the question of the German stance vis-a-vis England. Apart from the basic idea of Lebensraum, the novel’s mihtant nationaUsm also appealed to NS ideologues. Grimm released emotions and struck chords which could not fail to have their effect on a receptive public. But it must also be remembered that though he consciously acted as a propagator of the Nordic world view, he was more of an old-fashioned, crabbed national conservative than an out-and-out Nazi. Indeed he never joined the party and always avoided the formula Heil Hitler. While it is true he allowed himself to be elected Senator of the literary Academy and accepted a high position in the Reichsschrifttumskammer he never made any secret of his doubts about Hitler and about Goebbels’ Hterary poHcies. In the period between 1933 and 1945 he pubUshed only two speeches and he never received any of the many cultural prizes of the Third Reich. His relationship with Goebbels was a tense one, because the Doctor found it impossible to make Grimm toe the party Hne. Grimm remained the individualist who approved in general of what was happening, but disapproved of any restriction on his personal freedom. Of course, as the ‘poet of the national epic’, enjoying a special relation¬ ship with Goebbels, his position was a unique one, and he could get away with more than many of his less prominent colleagues. Nevertheless, his hfe under National Socialism was strange. like many, he dried up as far as creative writing was concerned, but his great wealth enabled him to develop widespread activities, most notable of which were the Lippoldsberg literary Gatherings, to which he invited leading German national-conservatives like Edwin Erich Dwinger, Moritz Jalm, Rudolf Alexander Schroder and Paul Alverdes.^'^ Even after 1945 meetings still took place there at which Kolbenheyer, Schumann and Pleyer\n\nThe Making of a People\n\n31\n\nengaged in discussions about Germany’s place in the new Europe. Grilhm himself remained completely unchanged and true to himself. Like a Christian defending the early Church and primitive Christianity Grimm continued to defend ‘original’ National Socialism. It was his opinion that there had been nothing wrong with the movement, indeed it had attempted a great deal that was right for Germany and for Europe. It was only through Hitler’s paranoia that it had gone wrong and crimes and excesses had crept in. Grimm remained one of the incurables. Attempts to rediscover him and find new readers for his works failed. As for the old readers, they had been ready to die for their belief in Lebensraum and when the war came they did so: Their graves are to be found from the Arctic Circle to the Caucasus, but Hans Grimm Hved to deny vociferously any responsibility for the events of the Third Reich. It is true that he was not a National SociaUst and differed from them in certain matters. Rather he was an extreme Nationalist. In Germany nationahsm of a violent and anti-western type has a much stronger tradition than national-sociaUsm; this kind of fervent nationahsm is much more hkely to stage a come-back than Hitler’s brand of German fascism. Another author, of an entirely different type, but nevertheless one who, like Grimm, could claim that he was never a National SociaHst, one who, like Grimm, preached a nationahsm of an extremely violent, anti-democratic kind; and one who, hke Grimm, gave thousands of young Germans ideals to hve and die for, was Ernst Jiinger, who is still writing to this day. Countless studies have been devoted to Ernst lunger, not least in an attempt to discover the extent to which he was or was not associated with National Sociahsm, but no satisfactory conclusion has yet been arrived at.^^ Admirers and defenders of this brilhant styhst, philosopher, botanist, aesthete and adventurer are almost as numerous as those who describe him as ‘one of the most dangerous of ah fascist thinkers’. Ernst Jiinger is constantly changing, modifying and manipulating his writings and so any quotation from his work can be countered by its opposite. Yet despite the contradictory nature of his place in the conservative revolution, and of his personal and ideological relationship with National Sociahsm in general and with Hitler and Goebbels in particular, there is no doubting the role of war in his writings. This was for him, as indeed for all his generation, the fundamental experience, the primal vision, and to it he\n\n32\n\nThe Making of a People\n\nconstantly returns. Bom in Heidelberg into a solid middle-class home, his youth seems to have been characterised by the same paralysing boredom and longing for release that was to find literary expression in a play hke Wedekind’s Spring Awakening, in novels like Musil’s * Tbrless and Hesse’s Under the Wheel, or in the poets of the imrtiediate pre-war expressionistic generation. In 1910 Georg Heym wrote in his diary: ‘It is always the same, so boring, boring, boring. Nothing happens, nothing, nothing, nothing. If only something would happen, which wouldn’t leave this stale taste of everyday things.’ German middle-class youths of this generation seem to have been filled with disgust at the deadly poison of ennui, with hatred of the money-gmbbing business mentahty, and with contempt for the merchant’s longing for safety and security. They were brim-full not with the spirit of adventure, but with the longing for an explosion, for some liberating action of any kind. Jiinger shared these feehngs and it was not surprising that in 1913 he ran away from home to join the Foreign Legion and only returned on the promise of a chance to join an expedition to Africa to chmb Kilimanjaro. When the war came he delayed only long enough to take the emergency School Leaving Certificate before joining up. By the end of 1915 he had reached the rank of lieutenant and had become a shock-troop leader. He survived the war, but not without wounds. In the final chapter (‘My Last Storm’) of Storm of Steel (1920) he amuses himself in hospital counting the number of times he has been hit: I found that I had been hit in all fourteen times; six times by riflebullets, once by a shrapnel bullet, once by a shell splinter, three times by bomb splinters, and twice by splinters of rifle-bullets. Counting the ins and outs, this made precisely twenty punctures, so that 1 might confidently with that Roman centurion, Holkschen Reiter, take my place in every warlike circle. Before the end of hostiUties he was made a Knight of the Order ‘Pour le m^rite’, the highest possible decoration in the German armed forces. He was a national hero. lunger remained in the army after the war, and it was during this time in the twenties that he started to write. All his titles reveal war as the central experience: Storm of Steel (1920); Struggle as Inner Experience (1922); Storm (1923); Copse 125. A Chronicle of the Trench Fighting (1915); Fire and Blood One Small Segment from a Major Battle (1925); The Adventurous Heart (1929); Total Mobilisation (1931). The last title, based on one of lunger’s own\n\nThe Making of a People\n\n33\n\nconcepts, is yet another example of a literary-intellectual idea which was^aken over and turned into reality by the National Socialists. lunger’s first and perhaps his most influential work, Storm of Steel, reveals his Hterary starting-point. As the subtitle indicates, it was written as ‘The Diary of a Storm-Trooper-Leader’. It was first pubhshed at the author’s own expense, and indeed at first sight it does look Uke the amateurish effort of a typical regimental officer. Junger signs himself a volunteer (that is not conscript), then lieutenant and company commander, he names his regiment (of which he is inordinately proud) and gives full miUtary details of regimental casualties. The aim of the book is to be sachlich (objective), a term taken up later as the style of the post-war generation; yet despite such claims Junger is far from being an exponent of the New Objectivity, and in many ways is closer to Expressionism, a movement of which he was certainly aware. His style is in fact not so much objective as visionary and apocalyptic, without the more glaring styUstic excesses of the Expressionists. What started off as a fairly technical mUitary account, of direct interest only to a limited number of specialists, came in time to be read as one of the key books of the period. But it was not until the wave of war books started in 1928 that this came about. Then Mittler the publisher, who had re-issued Storm of Steel in 1922, brought out a third edition of 10,000 as a counter to the pacifism and anti-militarism of Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front. It was only then that a book which had been read almost exclusively in army and Stahlhelm circles began to be read by a far wider public and that Junger began to be characterised in the reviews as a propagator of militarism, and as a central figure in the process of mental rearmament. In this the author’s self-dramatisation and the ‘legend’ that surrounded him, together with his personal charisma, did a great deal to further his new Uterary and intellectual career and he began to emerge as a German author to place alongside Lawrence and Malraux. Gide praised Storm and Steel as the finest piece of writing to come out of the war. Certainly it is quite unlike anything of its time — none of the pastoral musings of Siegfried Sassoon or Edmund Blunden, no whiffs of cowardice as in Hemingway, none of the masochism of T.E. Lawrence, or the compassion of Remarque. Instead Junger parades his belief in Man’s ‘elementary’ instinct to kill other men—a game which, if played correctly, must conform to a chivalric set of rules.^^\n\n34\n\nThe Making of a People\n\nAfter the war Jiinger withdrew from the army into the study of botany, entomology and marine biology. Here again he appears at first sight to be following the typical nationalist path towards that crude form of Darwinism the National Sociahsts were able to adopt because semi-scientific slogans like the ‘Struggle for Existence’ or the ‘Survival of the Fittest’ permitted them to rationalise the elimination of the gypsies and the extermination of the Jews as inferior races. But lunger was far too much of a real scientist to be taken in by such pseudo¬ science and besides he leaned towards the kind of biology concerned with Linnaean classification rather than eugenics. Jiinger became that contradiction in terms, the conservative intellectual, the man-of-action turned scientist, the aesthete and bibHophile. In effect the super-cool Prussian had all the hallmarks of the dandy, namely contempt for the masses, contempt for poHtical parties, radical individuahsm and indifference to the banality of commonplace matters. Patriot and nationalist he certainly was, but with his contempt for the realities and compromises of the political game he tended to move more and more into the realms of pure theory. And yet he could not stay away from politics—he had to feel that he was playing an important part. By 1925 he was writing political articles and by 1927 he was back in BerUn mixing with Kubin, Brecht, Dr Goebbels and Toller. Jiinger’s pohtical opinions were as mixed as the company he kept: in fact he moved from the Stahlhelm variety of nationalism through the youth movement to Niekisch’s National Bolshevism, that ‘Prussian Communism which hated capitalism, hated the bourgeois West and hoped to graft the methods of Bolshevism onto the chivalric ideals of the Junkers’. Jiinger was as friendly with Niekisch as he was with anyone, and helped his wife and child when he was arrested by the Gestapo in 1937. Jiinger probably did earnestly desire the alliance of workers and soldier-aristocrats who would abohsh the middle classes. He probably did, more than anything else, hope to win over the workers to the national cause, but this did not make him totally committed to National Bolshevism—he just was not capable of total commitment.
