It doesn't think, and it doesn't feel any more  it follows.  Victor Klemperer[1200]\n\nAll Führers were incurable phantoms. They robbed us of our freedom, first inwardly, then outwardly. But their existence was possible because so many people no longer wanted to be free, to be responsible for themselves.  Karl Jaspers[1201]\n\nBut the actual murderers and those who sent them out had accomplices. German scholarship provided the ideas and techniques which led to and justified this unparalleled slaughter.  Max Weinrich[1202]\n\nHannah Arendt sub-titled her study of the trial of Adolf Eichmann A Report on the Banality of Evil. There was no doubting the banal nature of Eichmann's appearance in the Jerusalem courtroom. Balding, suited, in horn-rimmed spectacles, he resembled little more than a stereotype of the travelling salesman for the Vacuum Oil Company he had been prior to seeking an alternative career in the Nazi Party.[1203] On the surface, polite, respectful, and obsequious, his appearance and attitude, however, were parts of a carefully contrived defence strategy. The public had expected a monster; instead they saw everyman.[1204]\n\nThe banality of evil, and what this phrase has come to imply, is intrinsic to any study of Nazi eugenics and its consequences, indeed of Nazism in its entirety. The phrase is often used to inadequately describe evil behaviour that is in all other respects incomprehensible, but it is pertinent to question the meaning Arendt actually ascribed to it. As a figure, Eichmann may well have appeared banal. But his acts were not. In truth, Eichmann was an efficient, rather dull bureaucrat, who, bereft of his SS uniform and consequent limitless powers over life and death, would not even rate a footnote in Holocaust history. Circumstances, rather than talent or ability made him, although there is no doubting his dedication to murder on a gigantic scale when fate placed him in a position to play God. It is at least open to question as to whether he could have ever have been anything other than an enthusiastic administrator, a classic example of the Schreibtischtäter  the desk murderer, corrupted by limitless power. Accused of killing a boy in the garden of his villa in Budapest in 1944, Eichmann vehemently denied having ever personally killed anybody - indeed, this became a cornerstone of his defence.[1205] Such an accusation was an offence to his honour. Although it was apparent that this in no way lessened his monstrous crimes, a fact surely evident even to Eichmann himself, it does raise the issue of the designation Arendt chose. What has generated a seemingly endless debate in the more than half-century since she coined the phrase is not her description of Eichmann's acts, but the subtitle of her book, which is not so much A Report on the Banality of Evil, but rather A Report on the Banality of the Evildoer. Such banality becomes increasingly apparent as the history of the perpetrators of Nazi crimes is studied. In fact, this was quite evident to Arendt herself, for she concluded that it would have been very comforting indeed to believe that Eichmann was a monster [but]...the trouble was precisely that so many were like him, and that the many were neither perverted nor sadistic, that they were, and still are, terribly and terrifyingly normal.[1206]. Of course, much depends on what is understood by normal in this context, but what was true of Eichmann was also true of the great majority of those responsible for both the theory of National Socialist racial hygiene and its practice.\n\nIf most of these perpetrators of the crimes under consideration in this text were not sadistic monsters, neither were the majority of them true Schreibtischtäter like Eichmann, long-distance executioners who were content to issue orders for the killing of millions to other operatives in the field without soiling their own hands. Their guilt lay somewhere in between; they were often directly and personally involved in killing the helpless, and if deriving little or no personal gratification from it, or acting out of what German law describes as base motives, still finding ample justification for their actions.[1207]In an almost classic display of hubris, Paul Nitsche, psychiatric head of mass murder, and a leading light in the production of the euthanasia films already detailed, once commented: Isn't it wonderful to get rid of all the ballast collecting in the asylums? Now we can perform some real therapy.[1208] What this meant in reality was spelt out at the very commencement of T4 in 1939. The number of psychiatric beds was targeted to be reduced by fifty percent; the average length of a patient's hospitalisation was to be severely reduced, treatment was to become more radical, and long term patients were to be exterminated.[1209] This was to be literally a case of kill or cure.\n\nWhat follows does not pretend to be a comprehensive lexicon of those accused of perpetrating the crimes previously described. Such a task is beyond the scope of this, or it may be presumed, any other work. Rather it should be viewed as an attempt to provide brief biographical details of a representative cross-section of those accused of participating or impacting upon, directly or indirectly, a gigantic criminal enterprise, and, where known, their eventual fate. Their number includes those who designed and implemented the programme and those who executed it in killing centres and extermination camps. Here there professors and doctors, administrators and policemen, technicians and nurses, and others who were employed in the most mundane of occupations prior to their involvement with T4. Some were simply murderers, a few of whom were undoubtedly motivated by the pleasure they derived from killing, but the majority participated for reasons it is still difficult, if not impossible, to truly comprehend. Examining the education, political and otherwise, careers, ambitions, influences, and ultimate destiny of these individuals provides not only a portrait of who they were, what they did, and how they were, or were not, brought to account for their actions, but also presents a vignette of their interlocking relationships and mutual devotion to eugenic goals. Hopefully, it also imparts some indication of the size and scope of this iniquitous undertaking. Complete information about every individual included is by no means easily available or accessible. In some cases very little is known. But what is known paints a frightening picture.\n\nThe categories that follow, of (a) theorists, (b) technocrats, (c) members of the medical profession, and (d) operatives, are not intended to be definitive, but rather illustrative. It is difficult in some cases to precisely allocate an individual to one group rather than another, since there was frequently an overlapping of duties and responsibilities. However, these designations attempt to generally distinguish between (a) the pioneers of German racial hygiene and eugenics; (b) the higher ranking and administrative staff of T4; (c) the doctors and nurses who manned senior positions in T4, in most cases for at least some of the time at one or more killing centres; and (d) the rank-and-file operatives, those at the sharp end of euthanasia and Aktion Reinhard, who were responsible for administering the instructions that filtered down to them from above.\n\n* * *\n\nTheorists\n\nEugen Fischer (1874-1967)[1210] was born in Karlsruhe. Together with Fritz Lenz (q.v.) and Wilhelm Schallmayer (q.v.), he studied under the influential zoologist August Weismann in Freiburg.[1211] In 1900 he attained the status of Privatdozent, the approximate equivalent of an associate professorship, and in 1912 was appointed ao professor, before in 1918 taking up the chair in anatomy at Freiburg University. His subsequent academic career has been described above.\n\nFischer was a conservative nationalist, and although he did not join the Nazi party until 1940, he was a spiritual National Socialist long before then, endorsing Nazism for realizing (in his opinion) that it was the qualities of race that were responsible for a nation's culture.[1212] He served as a judge in the Berlin Higher Hereditary Health Court, and was considered an expert witness concerning the issue of paternity in civil lawsuits.[1213]He was also one of those involved in assessing the racial characteristics of the so-called Rheinlandbastarde.[1214] He made his views clear in a speech of 20 June 1939:\n\nWhen a people wants, somehow or other, to preserve its own nature, it must reject alien racial elements, and when these have already insinuated themselves, it must suppress them and eliminate them. The Jew is such an alien and, therefore, when he wants to insinuate himself, he must be warded off. This is self-defence. In saying this, I do not characterize every Jew as inferior, as Negroes are, and I do not underestimate the greatest enemy with whom we have to fight. But I reject Jewry with every means in my power, and without reserve, in order to preserve the hereditary endowment of my people.[1215]\n\nFischer retired from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1942; two years later that establishment's name was changed to the Eugen Fischer Institute in his honour.[1216] In the same year Fischer was awarded the Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches[1217] in recognition of his eminence as the founder of human genetics.[1218]Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer (q.v.) recognized Fischer's contribution as groundbreaking for the scientific basis of the hereditary and racial cultivation of the National Socialist state.[1219] Fischer's beliefs can be summarised in his statement: All human traits  normal or pathological, physical or mental  are shaped by hereditary factors.[1220] After the war Fischer continued to lecture on anthropology and other subjects, and to contribute to academic publications.[1221] Despite his Nazi associations, in 1952 Fischer was made an honorary member of the German Anthropological Society.[1222]\n\nHans Friedrich Karl Günther (1891-1968) was born in Freiburg, the son of a musician. He studied comparative linguistics at Freiburg University, obtaining his doctorate in 1914. At the outbreak of the First World War he enlisted in the army, but due to sickness was quickly hospitalized and then discharged. Thereafter he served with the Red Cross.\n\nAfter the war, Günther went to Dresden, where he became a teacher, and in 1919 produced his first book, a work entitled Ritter, Tod und Teufel (The Knight, Death and the Devil: The Heroic Idea), a title taken from an engraving by Albrecht Dürer.[1223] In 1920 the Nazi publisher Julius Friedrich Lehmann[1224] asked Günther to write a book about the German people from a racial-biological point of view. The result, Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (Racial Biology of the German People), appeared in 1922. By 1935 it had reached its 16th edition, and 91.000 copies had been printed.\n\nIn an article entitled Hatred published in 1921, Günther dismissed the idea of an all-embracing love of mankind. Rather one should extend love to those who were members of the racial community, but hatred towards all those who were not.[1225] This was a message that Nazism readily embraced. Günther claimed that the Nordic was the pre-eminent race, establishing valuable cultures everywhere. The antithesis of the Nordic was the Jew, a thing of ferment and disturbance, a wedge driven by Asia into the European structure. Günther proposed that the Nordic peoples should unite to secure global dominance, another theory that was hardly likely to find disfavour with Hitler and his followers.\n\nIn 1923 Günther moved to Scandinavia, where he was recognized as being among the most prominent theorists in matters of racial biology. By 1930, however, he had returned to Germany to take up the chair in Social Anthropology at Jena University, a position that had been specifically created for him. Hitler, Göring, Frick, and other prominent Nazis attended his inaugural lecture; that same evening Nazi students held a torchlight procession in his honour.[1226] Gunther joined the Nazi party in 1932 and went on to receive a number of honours from the regime, including the Goethe Medal for Art and Science. In 1935 he was appointed Director of the Institute for Racial Studies, People Biology, and Rural Sociology in Berlin Dahlem (Anstalt für Rassenkunde, Völkerbiologie und ländliche Soziologie).\n\nBy now nicknamed Rassen-Günther (Racial-Gunther), he remained in Jena until taking up a professorship at Freiburg University in 1939, where he continued to teach until 1944. At the end of the war Günther was removed from his professorship and was imprisoned by the French occupying authorities for three years. On his release he continued to write and issued new editions of his books. He never relinquished his National Socialist worldview, and continued to promote sterilisation as a solution to mankind's ills. His last work, an autobiography entitled My Impression of Adolf Hitler (Mein Eindruck von Adolf Hitler), described as a good example of repression and selective perception, was published posthumously in 1969.[1227]\n\nErnst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel (1834-1919) was born in Potsdam. He studied medicine in Würzburg, Berlin, and Vienna, obtaining his doctorate in 1857 and his licence to practice shortly thereafter. After abandoning a career as a physician, he obtained a degree in zoology and eventually became professor of comparative anatomy and director of the Zoological Institute at the University of Jena, a position he occupied from1862 to 1909. In 1865 he was appointed to the university's zoology chair. This was a position which had been specially established for him, in the same way that Günther's professorship in Social Anthropology was to be at the same university 65 years later.[1228]\n\nHaeckel was a prolific researcher, illustrator and author, producing no less than 42 books and innumerable other publications by the time of his sixtieth birthday. His contribution towards nineteenth-century perceptions of Darwinism have already been considered above. Although today regarded as highly dubious, Haeckel's conclusions regarding eugenic matters were enormously influential in their day, particularly with men who were themselves to become important contributors to National Socialist racial hygienic theory. Ironically, his own views were considered sufficiently unacceptable to the Nazis for them to have his books banned on the grounds that they incorporated an unacceptable element of democratic-liberalistic spirit.[1229]\n\nFritz Lenz (1887-1976)[1230] enjoyed a long and successful career, as already described. His fundamental philosophy can be summarized in a quotation from his doctoral thesis of 1912: The only way to eliminate genetic illness is through the negative selection of the afflicted families.[1231] It is not difficult to understand why such pronouncements made him the leading light of what came to be called scientific racism, and the Nazis' favourite eugenic theoretician, even though he only became a member of the NSDAP in 1937, and the Nazi Physicians' League in 1940. To the end of his life he continued to believe that the eugenic hypothesis of racial differences had been scientifically proven, and that the Holocaust was merely another example of social Darwinism in practice. Hailed on the occasion of his eighty-fifth birthday by the neo-Nazi journal Neue Anthropologie as the grandfather of German racial hygiene,[1232] in 1951 he had written: \n\nI also have sympathy for the chimpanzees and gorillas, and it distresses me that they are expected to become extinct like so many other animal species and native peoples. To me the fate of millions of Jews is also very painful; but all this does not permit us to regard questions of biology differently or to look at them other than purely objectively.[1233]\n\nAlfred Ploetz (1860-1940)[1234] was born in Swinemünde, Pomerania (now Swinoujscie, Poland), but grew up and attended school in Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) before enrolling at the University of Zurich. Initially a student of political economics, after a six month sojourn in the United States he returned to Zurich and medicine, qualifying as a doctor in 1890. He then went back to America for a short period, opening a medical practice in Springfield, Massachusetts, but found life there a disappointment and quickly returned to Europe.[1235] His subsequent career has been outlined above. He joined the Nazi party in 1937, and on his death three years later was eulogized by Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer (q.v.), who praised his inner sympathy and enthusiasm [for] the National Socialist Movement.\n\nRudolf Ramm (1887-1945)[1236] was born in Dortmund. He studied medicine and pharmacy in Strasbourg, Munich, and Cologne, in due course obtaining his licence to practice as a physician and pharmacist. In 1921 he began working as a general practitioner and in 1929 was appointed Gau Chairman of the National Socialist Doctor's League of the Rheinpfalz. In the same year he became a member of the town council of Pirmasens, going on to officiate as mayor of the town between 1934 and 1937. In 1930 he joined the NSDAP as well as the SS, and in 1932 was elected to the Reichstag as the party's representative. Between 1932 and 1936 he was Nazi Kreisleiter in Pirmasens, and from 1933 became a member of both Leonard Conti's (q.v.) staff and the medical faculty of the University of Berlin.\n\nRamm became an influential member of the Nazi medical elite, holding a number of important positions before eventually taking on responsibility for maintaining the standards of German medical education.[1237] His idea of medical ethics can be gathered from some of his published comments; enforced sterilisation of the valueless was beneficial, euthanasia merciful for the incurably sick and insane, and moreover an obligation to the Volk.[1238] A true physician must not only be a Party member on the outside, but rather must be convinced in his heart of hearts of the biological laws that form the centre of his life. In addition to accepting the inviolability of these laws, Ramm wrote, the doctor's duty was to continually preach them to unbelievers.[1239] Jews had spread spiritually poisonous ideas and had destroyed the genetic life of the German nation.[1240] In 1942 he informed his students that: The faster and more thoroughly [the Jewish question] is solved, the more rapid (and better) will be the reformation of the European continent upon a racial basis, and the happier will be its future.[1241]\n\nRamm died on 9 August 1945, thereby escaping probable arrest and trial for a career largely devoted to endorsing Nazi eugenic and racial policies.\n\nErnst Rüdin (1874-1952)[1242] psychiatrist, geneticist, eugenicist, and brother of Alfred Ploetz's (q.v.) first wife, was born in St Gallen, Switzerland. Rüdin began his career in psychiatry at Emil Kraepelin's clinic in Munich.[1243] In1931 he was appointed managing director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatric Research, which Kraepelin had founded in that city as The German Research Institute of Psychiatry in Munich in 1917.[1244] At the time of the foundation of the Institute, Rüdin had been made head of the department dealing with psychiatric research on heredity.\n\nAfter 1933 the National Socialist government and party endorsed Rüdin's work by supplying financial and manpower support. Considered the spiritual father of the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring,[1245] in 1934 he wrote the official commentary on that legislation, as well as subsequently serving in the Hereditary Health Courts.[1246] Rüdin was unstinting in his praise of Nazi policies. In January 1943 he not only commended the sterilisation law and the Nuremberg racial laws, but acclaimed the Nazi's combat against parasitic foreign-blooded races, like the Jews and Gypsies.[1247] He was another to be awarded the Adlerschild des Deutschen Reiches, in his case in 1944 for his efforts as a path breaker in the field of human hereditary care.[1248] He dabbled in providing special research facilities at his institute for the Ahnenerbe department of the SS, was a supporter of aviation medical experiments, and was not averse to utilizing euthanasia victims for the purpose of brain research.[1249]\n\nFollowing a denunciation by the psychiatrist Theo Lang, who had defected to Switzerland in around 1941, Rüdin was arrested in Munich by the Americans in December 1945, but released eleven months later. He was considered a candidate for prosecution at the Nuremberg Medical Trial, but in the event his contribution to Nazi racial hygiene policies and practice was not considered worthy of legal proceedings. Apart from his age and alleged health problems, the issue of the sterilisation of German citizens, in which Rüdin had played such a prominent role, was considered too sensitive to form part of the main thrust of the trial.[1250]\n\nEven today, Rüdin's research on the genetics of schizophrenia, which established a theoretical basis for his eugenics work, continues to be cited in matters of psychiatric genetics without reference to his involvement in eugenics.\n\nFalk Ruttke (1894-1955) was a lawyer born in Halle. A former Freikorps recruit, he joined the Nazi party in 1932 and the SS in 1933.[1251] As a member of the Committee for Population and Race Policies at the Ministry of the Interior he co-authored a commentary on the Sterilisation Law together with Arthur Gütt (q.v) and Ernst Rüdin (q.v.), a matter which brought him into conflict with Gerhard Wagner (q.v.). Wagner was dissatisfied with the commentary on the grounds that, in essence, it did not adequately reflect Nazi racism, a dispute that resulted in some amendments to the Sterilisation Law in 1938, but ultimately was resolved by the introduction of euthanasia.[1252]\n\nThroughout the 1930s Ruttke was a prominent advocate of National Socialist ideology, appearing at a variety of international conferences and seminars to espouse the virtues not only of the Sterilisation Law, but other legislation as disparate as The Law to Reduce Unemployment, The Decree for the Granting of Marriage Loans, the Law for the New Formation of the German Farmerstock, and their ilk. Germany's progress, indeed its continued existence, Ruttke proclaimed, was based upon such new legislation continuing to promote a wholly racist vision of social hygiene. At a 1936 international gathering of eugenicists, he declared:\n\nHereditary traits are not only given to us, but carry a moral obligation to pursue the highest biological development possible. This not only calls for work on behalf of the Volk, into which the individual is born and with which he is connected through blood ties, but also on behalf of all humankind. This is thus extremely important work toward the maintenance of peace.[1253]\n\nRuttke continued his involvement in matters of racial law throughout the Nazi era.\n\nWilhelm Schallmayer (1857-1919) was born in Mindelheim, a small town in Bavaria. After a year's voluntary army service, he attended the universities of Würzburg, Munich, and Leipzig, finally settling on a career in medicine after having flirted with a variety of other subjects. In 1883, Schallmayer became a licensed medical practitioner, eventually commencing to work in that capacity at Kaufbeuren in 1887. By then he was a prototypical eugenicist, for whom the all important question was whether the physical development of the human race, upon which the continuation of all cultural progress depends, is presently advancing or declining. The answer was obvious to him:\n\nEven if medical technology grew to such an extent that malfunctioning human organs could be safely replaced by healthy human, animal, or laboratory-produced ones, the following generations would not be more efficient, rather just the opposite: the more advanced therapeutic medicine becomes, the more succeeding generations will have need of it. Therapeutic medicine affects the improvement of national health in about the same way as poor-relief contributes to the improvement of national welfare. Both encourage an increase in the dependent [population]. . . . Medicine, insofar as it aims at treatment rather than prevention, contributes nothing to the gradual advance of human productivity and human happiness. It aids the individual but at the expense of the human race.\n\nSince he considered his work as general practitioner useless, if not actually detrimental to the improvement of the Volk, he decided to leave Kaufbeuren and specialize in urology and gynaecology instead. After year's training in Vienna, Leipzig, and Dresden, he began a lucrative practice in Düsseldorf, where apart from a two year break during which he worked as a ship's doctor, he remained until 1897. In that year he settled in Munich, an independent scholar intent upon preaching the virtues of eugenics to his fellow citizens. But it was winning the Krupp Prize competition in 1903 which brought him to national prominence. Much of the rest of Schallmayer's life was devoted to defending his thesis, for as has been demonstrated, there was little unanimity of opinion among eugenicists. Of Schallmayer's importance as the intellectual patriarch of German racial hygiene, and thus his influence on the course of twentieth century history, however, there can be no doubt.[1254]\n\nReinhold Ralph Ernst Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer (1896-1969)[1255] was born in Richelsdorfer Hütte, a small town near Fulda in central Germany. In August 1914 he volunteered for the army, and served with distinction in the Great War, being thrice wounded and winning the Iron Cross first and second class, among other medals. In 1919 he began to study medicine in Marburg, and in 1920 became involved in the Kapp Putsch, a failed right-wing attempt to overthrow the Weimar government of Friedrich Ebert. Taken together with his membership of the Thule Society, a forerunner of the NSDAP, he thus evinced his political inclinations at an early age. He continued his medical studies in Hamburg, Munich, and Freiburg and in 1923 was awarded his doctorate. From 1923 to 1927 he worked as an assistant physician at the medical clinic of the University of Tübingen, where he began his research into the hereditary and environmental characteristics of twins.[1256] This was a subject which was to obsess him for the rest of his days. In Verschuer's opinion, twin research was the sovereign method for genetic research in humans.[1257]\n\nIn October 1927 Verschuer became a lecturer at the University of Berlin and was also appointed a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics (Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Anthropologie, menschliche Erblehre, und Eugenik), becoming director of the Institute in 1942. In July 1932 he was involved in discussions with the Prussian authorities concerning the introduction of a sterilisation law, a matter soon superseded by the advent of Hitler's government. Verschuer remained a staunch supporter of racial hygiene, and approved of the Nuremberg Laws, although he did not join the NSDAP until 1940, and only became a member of the Nazi Medical Association in 1942. In 1934 he became the first editor of `Der Erbarzt' (`The Genetic Doctor'), a journal devoted to the discussion of sterilisation and related issues. Every doctor must be a genetic doctor, Verschuer declared.[1258] In 1935 he was appointed director of the Institute for Genetic Biology and Racial Hygiene (Institut für Erbbiologie und Rassenhygiene) in Frankfurt, and held a number of other positions in organisations and institutions dedicated to the pursuit of Nazi eugenics.\n\nVerschuer's most infamous pupil was Josef Mengele, who was awarded his PhD under Verschuer's tutelage. Mengele shared his mentor's enthusiasm for research into twins, as was evident from Verschuer's report on his protégé: My assistant, Dr [Josef] Mengele (M.D., PhD) has joined me in this branch of research. He is presently employed as Hauptsturmführer and camp physician in the concentration camp at Auschwitz. Mengele supplied material from murdered Auschwitz inmates to Verschuer at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.[1259]\n\nAlthough described by Allied investigators as a man who remained in the background, but in spite of all, [was] one of those principally responsible for the theory of racial hygiene and executions by gas, in 1946 a denazification tribunal deemed Verschuer a Mitläufer (collaborator or fellow traveller) rather than a criminal, and fined him 600 Reichsmarks. Apart from a brief spell of house arrest, this represented the complete extent of his encounter with the judicial system insofar as his eugenic activities were concerned.[1260] He subsequently tried to have his branch of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute re-established in Frankfurt, without success. Instead some recognised him for what he was, the head of the commission responsible for such matters writing:\n\nVerschuer should not be considered a collaborator, but one of the most dangerous activists of the Third Reich. An objective judgment of the investigative committee must recognize this, and thereby take action to guarantee that this man does not come into contact with German youth as a university teacher, or with the broader population as a scientist in the fields of genetics and anthropology.\n\nNotwithstanding these observations, in 1951 Verschuer was appointed professor of human genetics at the University of Münster, and went on to hold several other important academic positions, his past apparently both forgiven and forgotten. After a serious car accident in September 1968, Verschuer fell into a coma. He died a year later without regaining consciousness. His obituaries made no mention of his extensive and influential participation in Nazi eugenic affairs.[1261]\n\n* * *\n\nTechnocrats\n\nAugust Dietrich (Dieter) Allers (1910-1975)[1262] was born in Kiel and studied law at the universities of Jena and Berlin. As a student he joined the Nazi party in 1932 and the SA in 1934,[1263] subsequently becoming a civil servant in the Prussian government in 1937. He was conscripted on the outbreak of war, and as a non-commissioned officer, was sent to Poland to train recruits. As previously described, following a chance encounter between his mother and Werner Blankenburg (q.v.), Allers was recruited to T4.\n\nHe rapidly became the organization's chief legal expert, heading its financial bureau the Zentralverrechnungsstelle Heil- und Pflegeanstalten (Central Clearing Office for Mental institutions) and succeeding T4's first legal advisor, Dr Gerhard Bohne (q.v.), who had resigned his position in June 1940 in a dispute over the corruptibility of his colleagues. In spring 1941, Allers was promoted to the position of general manager of T4, effectively becoming principal assistant to Viktor Brack (q.v.), his deputy, Werner Blankenburg (q.v.), and T4's chief medical advisor, Paul Nitsche (q.v.). Aller's office coordinated efforts to disguise the killings, which involved deliberately misinforming both the relatives of the victims as well as the agencies involved in committing patients and paying for their care.[1264] Allers also succeeded Bohne as head of the Gemeinnützige Stiftung für Anstaltspflege (Charitable Foundation for Institutional Care), usually referred as the Stiftung (Foundation), which was the T4 front organization responsible for all personnel affairs and financial matters. Although Allers supervised activities, acting in effect as managing director of T4, he was not directly responsible for the day to day administration, leaving this to Friedrich Tillmann (q.v.).[1265] As part of his duties, Allers visited all six of the main euthanasia killing centres on numerous occasions, ensuring the smooth running of the operation. Following the reorganisation of the killing in August 1941, he was a member of the T4 Organisation Todt Russian expedition the following winter.\n\nThat Allers was immersed in the business of murder is evident from a letter he wrote in 1943 to Rudolf Lonauer (q.v.), the physician-in-charge at Hartheim, in which he stated that Herbert Linden (q.v.) wanted to transfer a mentally ill Russian named Boris Mirkolo to Hartheim and that Lonauer should have no difficulty understanding the purpose. It seems unlikely that Mirkolo, who spoke German, actually suffered from any mental illness. At Hartheim he was shot and then, since he was not yet dead, dragged into the gas chamber and gassed.[1266] Linden's reason for wanting Mirkolo murdered is unknown.\n\nIt is certain that Allers visited the Aktion Reinhard extermination camps, although the extent of his involvement in that operation has not been clarified. What is known is that he dispatched Adolf Kaufmann (q.v.) to Belzec to collect sealed crates, probably containing gold, jewellery or banknotes, and take them directly to Berlin.[1267] He remained manager of the euthanasia project until May 1944, when together with other T4 members he was posted to Trieste [replacing the shot Christian Wirth[1268] (q.v.)], allegedly to conduct anti-partisan activities. In fact, it has been established that his unit was concerned with the rounding up of Italian Jews for extermination.[1269]\n\nThirty years after these events, Allers remained an unrepentant Nazi. On euthanasia:\n\nWell, as far as I myself was concerned, the idea of euthanasia was not new to me; I had read quite a bit about it. Good heavens, it's been discussed, and on the cards, for centuries. What was intended at the time has been completely distorted since[1270] People have completely misunderstood: now it is constantly being misinterpreted. Just look at the world now: don't you think something very much like this will have to happen?[1271]\n\nOn murdering Jews: Originally what they wanted to do was put into practice an old Polish plan one third to be killed; one third resettled somewhere; and one-third to be allowed to assimilate.[1272] On that reasonable basis only one million Polish Jews would have been murdered, rather than the three million eventual victims.\n\nAllers was arrested by the British military in August 1945, and remained in various camps until his release in February 1947, at which time he became the manager of a mining company. He was re-arrested by the Americans in April 1948, and handed over to the German authorities. It would appear his new captors either had no knowledge of Aller's activities, or alternatively possessed no desire to delve into them too deeply, for he was released again in September 1949. The investigation into his participation in the euthanasia programme was discontinued in May 1950. Allers now entered into the law practice of his friend Johannes Plöger (former legal counsellor to Victor Brack), and in November 1951 became legal advisor to the German Shipyard in Hamburg. He continued to be involved in right-wing politics and maintained contact with his T4 Alte Kameraden, as well as running Die Stille Hilfe (Silent Help), the secret organization set up to aid ex-SS members.[1273] In 1954 he wrote to Reinhold Vorberg (q.v.) in confident mood:\n\nTake a look around and think back to the time around 1947. At that time, all of us envisioned a miserable personal future for ourselves. Today most of us have again become something, and it is my opinion we should not demand too much. Certainly quite a few people who held totally different positions (before) have landed well on their feet.[1274]\n\nThe confidence was misplaced. In August 1962 Allers was arrested once again on suspicion of his involvement in the euthanasia programme, but was released on bail in May 1963 to await trial. He lost his job with the German shipyard, but continued with his Hamburg law practice. In October 1963 it was decided to link his case with that of Vorberg, but it was to be April 1967 before the trial of the two opened in Frankfurt am Main, where it was to last twenty months.\n\nThe court had no doubt that both men had participated in the killing of tens of thousands of mentally ill patients (Allers' Aktion Reinhard activities were unfortunately not investigated in any depth), but were less convinced about their involvement in Sonderbehandlung 14f13. In December 1968, Allers was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, confirmed in October 1972 by the Federal High Court. However, since the term of his pre-trial confinement was deducted from the sentence, Allers was released after the verdict had been read out in court.[1275]\n\nAllers may be regarded as representative of the majority of those who became embroiled first in euthanasia, and then in Aktion Reinhard. Wartime life was undoubtedly more comfortable (and lucrative) in a Berlin office than in a barrack in Poland, and career prospects infinitely rosier in the KdF than in the army. Allers was no idealist committed to the practical application of eugenic theory, nor was he a virulent anti-Semite. Instead, he was a petit bourgeois opportunist, who saw the main chance, and seized it. As he himself put it regarding his colleagues, it wasn't a matter of careful or scientific selection of these people.[1276] In only slightly different circumstances he would have remained a nonentity, just another small-town lawyer. But once he had crossed the genocidal bridge and was able to accept murder as simply a further task to be efficiently accomplished, there were no limits to his ambition, or to his capacity for evil.\n\nGeorg Andreae (1888-?)[1277] was born in Göttingen. He held a doctorate in law rather than medicine, but nonetheless controlled the asylums at Wunsdorf, Hildesheim, Göttingen, Lüneburg, and Osnabrück from his office in Hannover.[1278] A dedicated Christian, Andreae had been a senior civil servant since 1926. He joined the NSDAP in 1933, and in July of that year became a sponsoring member of the SS. He had done so, he later claimed, inspired, by the hope that the National Socialist movement would finally evolve from its stormy early phase into a more peaceful, less violent development. When he discovered that such aspirations were a pipe dream, he desisted from further participation in party affairs.[1279] However, by that time and the ending of the first phase of euthanasia, an estimated 1,500 of the 7,000 patients under his jurisdiction had been deported from the Hannover institutions to Hadamar, and death.[1280] Andreae was well aware of their fate.\n\nAndreae appeared in court alongside Ludwig Gessner (q.v.) in Hannover in July 1950, accused of aiding and abetting murder and crimes against humanity[1281].[1281] With little documentary evidence concerning euthanasia in the province having survived the war, much reliance was placed upon oral testimony. Andreae declared that he had always been opposed to euthanasia, which he described as a monstrous crime. Witnesses described him as an exemplary civil servant, whose heart beats warmly for his patients whom, as a leading administrative official, he had cared for over several decades.[1282] He had even confronted Werner Heyde (q.v.) in an (unsuccessful) attempt to prevent the implementation of euthanasia in Hannoverian institutions.[1283] How could such a decent man be convicted? He wasn't. All charges against him were dismissed.\n\nHans-Joachim Becker (1909-?)[1284] [nicknamed `Millionen' (`Millions')], was born in Kassel, and entered his father's dairy equipment business on leaving school. As economic conditions worsened he had to leave his job and take up employment as an unpaid factory worker. In 1930 he found work in the civil service in Kassel, and became a member of the Nazi party in 1937. He studied higher public and financial administration, passing his examinations in 1940. In June of that year he was called up, but was discharged as medically unfit after just a few days. Shortly thereafter he was transferred to a local government office in Danzig where he was not happy. He applied for relocation to the Ministry of the Interior in Posen or Strasbourg, but instead found himself transferred to the Stiftung in Berlin.[1285] He had no idea what that organization was, but in January 1941 found himself employed by T4 as assistant to Allers, whose financial expert he was to become.\n\nIt was Becker who was primarily responsible for organizing T4's finances into the extremely profitable enterprise they grew to become, earning him the nick-name of `Millionen  Becker'. He was appointed director of the Central Clearing Office for Mental institutions, which, as Becker himself described it, was essentially the financial intermediary between the cost carriers and the so-called intermediate institutions and euthanasia facilities, the names and existence of which were to be kept secret.[1286]\n\nApart from standardizing various regional rates with cost carriers such as local authorities, insurance companies, welfare agencies and pension funds, then paying those costs to the T4 institutions involved,[1287] he also enriched T4 operations to a significant extent by creating a sophisticated system of fraud, whereby the nursing-fees of murdered patients continued to be collected long after they were dead. He performed many other chores in order to generate funds for T4, not the least of which was the plundering of gold dentures from the mouths of victims. These were regularly sent from the killing centres to Becker in Berlin for smelting. It was due in large part to Becker's input that T4 not only became self-financing, but was also able to donate funds to other sympathizing agencies.[1288] He claimed to have collected 6-8 million Reichsmarks per annum on average, in one year actually raking in 10 million Reichsmarks.[1289]\n\nBecker worked as a personal assistant to Paul Nitsche (q.v.) , and in 1943 was given the responsibility of supervising Hartheim, where in the following year he was in charge of the gassing of 3,228 inmates from Mauthausen and Gusen. Among his final tasks at Hartheim was the dismantling of the gassing apparatus and the reconversion of the institution to a normal mental hospital.\n\nAt the war's end, Becker avoided arrest, and even found employment with the Americans as a translator in Thuringia. When the American turned that region over to the Soviets in June 1945 and left, Becker left with them, returning to Kassel. In January 1947, the police in Thuringia issued a warrant for his arrest, but the Kassel police chief found no grounds whatsoever for a police arrest. Nonetheless, shortly thereafter an investigation into Becker's activities was commenced by the Chief Prosecutor's Office in Kassel, but abandoned in May 1950 because of an inability to find  a causal relationship between his activities and the resultant killings.\n\nAnd there matters rested for the next sixteen years while Becker continued to work for the Americans in Bad Kreuznach. In June 1966 his arrest in connection with his involvement in euthanasia was ordered by the Frankfurt court. He was released on bail, but the Americans had decided to dispense with his services, and he remained unemployed for most of the time until his trial commenced on 20 August 1969. Although Becker admitted to much of his T4 career, he sought to minimize his participation in the collection of gold dentures and the killings at Hartheim. However, the court had little difficulty in dismissing his defence, which included a claim that Werner Heyde (q.v.) had shown him the Führer authorization, an act that Becker contended had legitimized his actions. Instead, the court ruled that no human being with normal feelings can consider mass killings as right and as a just cause.\n\nIn the opinion of the court, rather than being a fanatical National Socialist, Becker was merely a weak character. It was considered that without Nazism he would not have become a criminal; on the other hand, without people like him, Nazism could never have realized its horrific crimes. Consequently, he was sentenced to the minimum term of imprisonment the court could impose  10 years for being an accessory to the murder of 24,540 mentally ill patients and 3,228 concentration camp inmates.[1290] He served three years in prison before entering hospital suffering from psychological strain. In September 1974, four years after sentencing, Becker's remaining prison term was suspended.[1291]\n\nOtto Friedrich (Fritz) Bernotat (1890-1951)[1292] Born in Mittel-Jodupp, East Prussia (now Czarnowo Srednie, Poland), Landesrat Fritz Bernotat was the representative for mental institutions in the state of Hesse. Together with his superior, Landeshauptmann Wilhelm Traupel (1891-1946) he had indicated his determination to eliminate ballast existences as early as 1936/1937. Having begun his local government career in 1922 he joined the NSDAP in 1928, a career move that saw him rapidly promoted to the post of head of the Hessian department of political affairs, welfare services agency, and the central administration of institutions, among other positions.[1293] In 1931 he became a member of the SS.\n\nResponsible for all Hessian asylums, Bernotat was one of the most brutal and fanatical of Nazi functionaries, even going so far as to arrange for his Jewish mistress to be murdered in Eichberg by a lethal injection.[1294] He would repeatedly tell medical staff: Why don't you beat patients to death, then you are rid of all of them? He and Traupel supervised a devastating lowering of the standard of care in Hessian hospitals through the reduction of nursing fees and the appointment of young Nazi doctors who, so one hospital director was told, were better with the needle.[1295] On their engagement, all recruits to T4 were asked if they belonged to a church. If they did, Bernotat demanded of those he interviewed that they give up their membership, for they could not serve two masters.[1296] He terrorized his workforce, once stating at an Eichberg staff meeting that if he heard even a hint that a nurse had spoken about conditions at the institution, or said anything at all in public, he would make that person accountable and stop at nothing.[1297]\n\nIn December 1940, Bernotat employed his brother-in-law, Fritz Scherwing, a master mechanic, to assist in the installation of the pipe-work and ventilation system in the gas chamber at Hadamar. Scherwing, clearly an innocent abroad in a cruel and heartless world, denied at his post-war trial of having any knowledge about the true purpose of the work he had undertaken, despite receiving repeated warnings from Bernotat concerning the strict secrecy surrounding his labours, and the presence of a crematorium adjoining the disinfection room. The court chose to believe Scherwing, and acquitted him for lack of evidence.[1298]\n\nA month prior to the commencement of Schwering's employment (that is while Hadamar was still operating as a normal mental hospital) Bernotat had gathered the entire staff together for the purpose of swearing them to absolute secrecy about forthcoming events at the institution. He threatened that any transgressions would be severely punished by detention in a concentration camp, or even execution.[1299] There is some doubt concerning whether he broached the subject of euthanasia at that time, but the evacuation of patients, Schwering's activities, and the arrival of T4 staff must have provided a reasonably clear indication of the State's intentions.[1300]\n\nWhen the war ended Bernotat assumed a false name and lived at Neuhof, near Fulda, where he died a natural death in 1951. He was never brought before a court to account for his participation in the murder of thousands of individuals.[1301]\n\nWerner Blankenburg (1905 -1957)[1302] [T4 pseudonym Brenner, post T4 pseudonym Bieleke][1303] was born in Caputh, Brandenburg. A Nazi party and SA member since 1929, he worked as a sales representative before joining the KdF.[1304] Despite becoming a member of the NSDAP at a relatively early date, he had held no previous party post, although he had achieved the rank of SA Oberführer. Together with Reinhold Vorberg (q.v.), Blankenburg had been recruited from private business in order to become a senior member of the T4 staff,[1305] in Blankenburg's case to be head of Amt IIa of the KdF, one of the sub-divisions responsible for the implementation of the euthanasia operation. His immediate superior, and overall head of Amt II was Viktor Brack (q.v.).[1306] Blankenburg was Brack's permanent deputy and in the latter's absence conducted the affairs of Amt II. He was thus completely immersed in the criminal activities of the KdF in general, and of T4 in particular.\n\nAfter Brack left the KdF for the front as a Sturmbannführer in the SS-Division Prinz Eugen in 1942, Blankenburg succeeded him as day-today manager of T4.[1307] Brack had been corresponding with Himmler concerning the possibility of the use of X-rays for the mass sterilisation of Jews (see chapter 10). When Himmler evinced interest in the proposal, directing that the method be tried in at least one concentration camp, Blankenburg replied to him in August 1942: As permanent deputy of Oberführer Brack, I shall immediately take the necessary measures and get in touch with the Chiefs of the Main Offices for the Concentration Camps. Some 20 months later, Blankenburg again wrote to Himmler explaining that the method had not been successful, and that operative castration requires not more than 6-7 minutes, and can therefore be performed more reliably and quicker than the castration by X-rays. Blankenburg concluded by assuring Himmler that he (Blankenburg) would soon be able to submit a report on the continuation of this work.[1308]\n\nBlankenburg was as deeply implicated in the murders and theft of Aktion Reinhard as all of the other senior T4 personnel. When he visited the Reinhard offices in Lublin to temporarily deposit some important items for the front, the duty supervisor contacted Odilo Globocnik (in charge of the Aktion) to obtain the necessary permission. Globocnik abruptly told the supervisor to mind his own business. A few days later, Blankenburg returned, removed the items and, in loading them onto a motor vehicle, one of the crates was damaged, dropping gold items onto the ground. The supervisor concluded that these items were the subject of Jewish measures.[1309] It is not difficult to surmise where Blankenburg had obtained the contents of the crates. Franz Suchomel (q.v.), in charge of the gold Jews at Treblinka, stated that a messenger arrived at the camp one day bearing an order from Blankenburg to hand over one million Reichsmarks. We filled his suitcase with a million marks, and he returned with it to Berlin, Suchomel testified.[1310] Blankenburg's citation for a medal in 1942 stated: Without his decisive contribution, it would not have been possible to complete this special assignment, so important to the war effort, on such a broad basis and with the necessary speed.[1311] The special assignment in question was self-evident.\n\nIn April 1945, Blankenburg was evacuated from Berlin to Bavaria together with other members of the KdF, including Viktor Brack. When the war ended he adopted the identity of Werner Bieleke (his wife's maiden name), and lived in the Wangen district of Stuttgart. He worked as a bank clerk in Ludwigsburg, and later as representative for a textile company in Freudenstadt. Despite being on the most wanted list of war criminals from 1945 until the time his death, he managed to escape arrest, even keeping in contact with his parents in an old people's home in Ulm, as well as with former T4 colleagues.\n\nAt the request of his wife, Blankenburg had been officially declared dead by a magistrates' court in Berlin-Tempelhof in 1956. The date of his death was given as 31 December 1945. In 1950, the Stuttgart Kriminalpolizei began to take an interest in the wartime activities of Herr Bieleke and he quickly disappeared into the Swabian Alps, south of the city. There he sought refuge with a former comrade from T4 in the market town of Münsingen. He returned to Stuttgart about a year later to resume his previous occupation. Blankenburg died in Stuttgart-Wangen on 28 November 1957[1312] and is buried there under the name of Werner Bieleke. At the funeral service numerous former members of Aktion T4 were present, among them Dietrich Allers (q.v.) and Erwin Lambert (q.v.).\n\nGerhard Bohne (1902-1981) [post T4 pseudonym Kurt Adolf Rüdinger[1313] was born in Braunschweig and studied law at the University of Cologne, qualifying as a lawyer in 1924 and obtaining his doctorate in 1928. After working in the civil service for several years, he commenced practicing law in Berlin in 1930. He returned to the civil service in 1935, serving as an administrative judge in a government economic agency. Bohne joined the NSDAP and SA in 1930, leaving the latter in 1935 to become a member of the SS.[1314]\n\nIn September 1939 Bohne was recruited by T4; together with Herbert Linden (q.v.) he represented Department IV of the Ministry of the Interior. T4's first legal expert, and thus responsible for creating the concern's administrative organization, he resigned in June 1940 in a dispute over the corruption prevalent amongst his colleagues,[1315] and was replaced in 1941 by the rather brighter and apparently more corruptible Dieter Allers (q.v.).[1316] Bohne's accusations were deemed to be somewhat exaggerated and led to his dismissal from the SS in December 1943.\n\nIn January 1943 Bohne was conscripted into the Wehrmacht, finishing the war in American captivity in Italy, from where he was released in late 1946. He immigrated to Argentina in 1949, then returned to Germany in 1955, settling first in Cologne and then in Düsseldorf, where in 1956 he began to practice law. Arrested in 1959 and charged with the murder of at least 15,000 people, Bohne was released from pre-trial confinement on medical grounds on 15 March 1963. Bohne's symptoms of illness were in fact caused by a fellow doctor overdosing him with quinine and caffeine. Despite Bohne having surrendered his passport, four months later his lawyer informed the court that Bohne was now seeking to recuperate in Buenos Aires,[1317] where he proceeded to live under the name of Kurt Adolf Rüdinger.[1318]\n\nArrested by the Argentinean police in February 1964 and eventually extradited to Germany in November 1966, Bohne stood trial together with Allers, Vorberg (q.v.), and Adolf Kaufmann (q.v.). However, before the case ended he was deemed unfit to stand trial on medical grounds. In October 1968 the proceedings against him were temporarily suspended, and nine months later the suspension became final.[1319] Miraculously, Bohne managed to survive until 1981.\n\nPhilip Bouhler (1899-1945)[1320] was born in Munich, the son of a retired colonel. He served in the German army during the Great War, eventually achieving the rank of Leutnant before being wounded and invalided out of the army in 1917. For a short time he became a philosophy student, but by 1921 he had joined the Nazi party, member number 12, and was a contributor to the Völkischer Beobachter. In 1922 he was appointed second secretary of the NSDAP.\n\nBouhler participated in the failed 1923 Beerhall Putsch and was consequently awarded the Blutordensträger (Blood Order). During the subsequent period, during which the party was banned, he acted as business manager of a Nazi cover organisation in south Germany, The Greater German Racial Community. Following the relaunching of the party in 1925, he became Reich Business Manager, working with Max Amann, the publisher of Mein Kampf.[1321] After the Machtergreifung, Bouhler was made a Reichsleiter, the highest position attainable in any Nazi Organisation, second only to the office of Führer.[1322] He was also appointed a Member of the Reichstag for Westphalia and became Commissioner for the Protection of National Socialist Literature,[1323] an office Goebbels, Rosenberg, and others undoubtedly considered their own. Despite the splendid titles he was clearly a man in search of an assignment of greater importance. After serving a brief term as Police Chairman of Munich, one such was found for him with the creation of the KdF, whose head he became in October 1934. Two years later he was appointed an SS-Obergruppenführer.\n\nPale and bespectacled, Bouhler remained a shadowy figure, always polite, always self-effacing,[1324] the archetypal obsequious civil servant - at least to the casual observer. Initially he shared an office at Schellingstrasse 50[1325] with Rudolf Hess, his ostensible immediate superior, before directing the KdF from the Brown House. He wrote several books on Nazism, and another bearing the title Napoleon  Kometenpfad eines Genies (Napoleon  the Comet-Path of a Genius), which was apparently a favourite of Hitler's.[1326] Despite his undoubted Nazi convictions, Bouhler lacked aggression. He was essentially an executor of orders, allegedly sharing the view held by Hess and many other sincere idealists within the party that its `great goals' justified every suppression of your own ideas, even of your own conscience. [1327] In that he unquestionably succeeded. If Brack (q.v.) is to be believed, in March 1941 when the so-called Madagascar Plan was supposedly still considered as a possible Final Solution to the Jewish Problem, it was Bouhler whose name was suggested to Hitler as governor of the island.[1328] Given Bouhler's activities at the KdF before and after that date, it requires little imagination to envision the fate of the Jews intended to be deported to that tropical wilderness under his stewardship .\n\nEven after euthanasia had officially been stopped in August 1941, Bouhler retained the hope of regaining the services of the T4 functionaries who had been loaned to Globocnik for the purpose of Aktion Reinhard.[1329] It was intended that the programme recommence at the successful conclusion of the war, but Bouhler was irate that Globocnik had used his well-trained men in connection with an assignment which would make them unfit, in Bouhler's opinion, to return to their former service.[1330]\n\nAs the war drew to a close Bouhler sought Göring's protection, following the Reichsmarschall to Austria. The sometime nominated successor to the Führer and the former joint head of the euthanasia programme both only succeeded in postponing the inevitable. Together with his wife, Bouhler committed suicide on 19 May 1945 whilst in American custody in transit to the Dachau concentration camp. Göring followed suit on 15 October 1946 following his conviction by the IMT at Nuremberg.\n\nViktor Brack (1904-1948)[1331] [T4 pseudonym Jennerwein, post T4 pseudonym Hermann Ober] was born in Haaren, near Aachen, the son of a physician. He studied agriculture for a time in 1923, before switching to economic science at the Technical High School in Munich, receiving his diploma in the latter subject in 1928.[1332] Thereafter, for a time he administered the estate attached to his father's sanatorium and was also a test driver for BMW. Active from an early age in right-wing politics, he joined the SA in 1923, and the Nazi Party and SS in 1929.[1333] In 1930 and 1931 he was often Himmler's chauffeur (he knew the Himmler family well, since Brack's father had delivered one of Himmler's children),[1334] before Bouhler (q.v.), then Reich Business Manager of the NSDAP, employed Brack on a full time basis at the Brown House in Munich in the summer of 1932. During 1933, Brack acted as Bouhler's adjutant; when Bouhler moved to Berlin as head of the KdF in 1934, Brack moved with him.\n\nIn 1936 Brack was placed in charge of Amt II of the KdF with the title of Reichsamtsleiter. This department examined complaints arriving from all sections of the population. By now Brack was also officially Bouhler's deputy, acting as liaison between the KdF and the SS, where he received steady promotion, achieving the rank of Oberführer in 1940.[1335] Despite his lack of any medical qualification, Brack was also given the responsibility of liaising directly with the Ministry of Health on behalf of the KdF.[1336] He was thus an integral and vital cog in the machinations of the Chancellery, the individual primarily responsible for the overall organization and day-to-day activities of T4. It was an occupation that placed him at the heart of both the euthanasia programme and the Final Solution. Amongst countless other tasks, together with Werner Blankenburg (q.v.), he was responsible for interviewing all potential T4 personnel. Moreover, as early as the summer of 1939 he had been discussing with his cohorts the use of carbon monoxide as the killing agent of choice for use in the forthcoming mercy killings.[1337]\n\nHaving largely been given the responsibility of organizing euthanasia, Brack claimed to have read a good deal about the subject, and decided to visit the asylums at Buch and Brandenburg-Görden to judge the condition of his potential victims for himself. Not surprisingly, he found the sight of inmates distressing and fully meriting of the release he was about to offer them. After all, as he explained at his trial:\n\nThe life of the insane person has, for himself and his relatives, lost all purpose, and consists only of pain and misery. Just as the soul belongs in the helping hands of the priest, so the body belongs in the helping hands of the physician. Only so can the sick person really be assisted It is [the doctor's] duty to free the person from his unworthy condition, so  I might even say  from his prison.[1338]\n\nThe court was not impressed with Brack the humanitarian, particularly after he freely admitted that he had been a participant in the original discussions concerning implementation of the euthanasia programme, as well as being present at the initial and many subsequent meetings of medical experts, administrators, and other operatives. He had frequently acted as Bouhler's representative, taking vital decisions based upon his own personal assessments and individual authority, in effect assuming the role of chief executive officer to Bouhler's chairman. Brack even went so far as to accept that his involvement in euthanasia was such that it might be presumed he was the key man at T4  an accurate, if unwise, display of vanity.[1339]\n\nAnother example of Brack's immersion in practical Nazism was his espousal of the economic advantages of sterilisation. On the principle that by such methods, valuable labour could be utilized whilst ensuring the ultimate disappearance of Nazism's arch enemy, Brack had been eager to suggest methods of mass sterilisation for Jews as an alternative to extermination, a subject which is examined in greater detail in chapter 10.\n\nIn evidence given in 1962, Josef Oberhauser (q.v.) described a visit by Brack to Lublin in May 1942. The Belzec extermination camp had been inoperative for the previous six weeks, but now Brack met with Globocnik to discuss the resumption of killing. When Globocnik complained of a lack of staff, according to Oberhauser, Brack replied:\n\nThe euthanasia programme had now stopped and that the people from T4 would from now on be detailed to him [meaning Globocnik] on a regular basis so that the decisions taken at the Wannsee conference could be implemented. The decision had been taken to set up two further extermination camps, which would be ready by 1 August 1942, namely Treblinka and Sobibor The large-scale extermination programme was due to start on 1 August 1942.[1340]\n\nPresumably because there was little killing left for him to organise, Brack left T4 in 1942, joining the Waffen-SS as a Sturmbannführer, and apparently remained on active duty until the war's end.[1341] When arrested in May 1945, he claimed his name was Hermann Ober (his wife's maiden name), but his true identity was quickly discovered.[1342] He was arraigned before an American military tribunal at Nuremberg in 1946, one of 23 defendants in the Medical Trial. It says much for Brack's qualities that he chose SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS Karl Wolff as a character witness. Wolff, for several years Himmler's Chief of Personal Staff and the Waffen-SS liaison officer at Hitler's military headquarters, had this to say about his former colleague: I can only call Brack an extremely decent, extremely obliging man, to whom any thought of committing or taking part in an inhumane act would be alien.[1343]\n\nEvidently the court did not find Wolff's testimony credible. Sentenced to death in 1947 for his manifest crimes, Brack was executed in 1948.[1344]\n\nLudwig Gessner (1886-1958)[1345] was born in Crumstadt, a village near Darmstadt, and held a doctorate in chemistry. He joined the NSDAP in 1930, and in 1933 was appointed to the position of Landeshauptmann (effectively, Governor) of the province of Hannover. In this capacity he was the immediate superior of Georg Andreae (q.v.).[1346]\n\nGessner began to hear rumours of a comprehensive planned euthanasia programme in early summer 1940, although even before then he was aware that patients were being killed in Pomerania. He visited Hans Hefelmannn (q.v.) and Herbert Linden (q.v.) in Berlin, who confirmed the intention of implementing the policy in Hannover.[1347] Gessner claimed to have been far from convinced about the legality of this, and wrote to the Minister of the Interior, Wilhelm Frick, setting out his objections. Unfortunately no copy of this document survived the war. Together with Andreae, Gessner thereafter continued to make strenuous efforts to prevent, or at least minimize the impact of euthanasia on the institutions under their control  or so they both testified.\n\nDespite a career that obviously had relied much on his longstanding enthusiasm for Nazism, at his trial in July 1950 the court considered Gessner to be of exemplary character. He could not have resigned his position since, Berlin would not only have accepted [his] withdrawal, but would have encouraged it, because it would have vacated his position for a more ideologically suitable replacement. So, like Andreae, and despite the demise of so many patients in their joint care, Gessner was acquitted of all charges.[1348]\n\nFriedrich Haus (1909-1945). According to the testimony of his sister, Haus joined the NSDAP and SA in 1930 and was a friend and colleague of Viktor Brack (q.v.). Haus was one of the so-called old fighters (Alten Kämpfer), and wore the golden party badge (Goldene Ehrenzeichen). This was awarded to the first one hundred thousand members of the party, but was also conferred on other individuals at Hitler's discretion. In about 1934 Haus became a full-time employee of the SS central office in Munich.[1349]\n\nHaus became head of T4's Personnel Department in 1940. This office was responsible for hiring all T4 staff and administering the oath of secrecy to them.[1350] In 1943 Haus joined either the Wehrmacht or the Waffen-SS, and was succeeded at T4 by Arnold Oels (q.v.). Haus died on 8 August 1945 as the result of a traffic accident. In a list of names kept by Friedrich Lorent (q.v.) in a bank vault, Haus' death is noted as suicide.[1351]\n\nHans Hefelmannn (1906-1986)[1352] [T4 joint pseudonym with Richard von Hegener (q.v.), Dr Klein][1353] was born in Dresden, the son of a textile manufacturer. A member of the NSDAP since 1931, he received his doctorate in agricultural engineering in 1932. After spending some time working for his father and in private business, he became an employee of the Nazi party's economics department headed by Rudolf Hess, moving in January 1936 to the KdF. There he was appointed head of Amt IIb in 1937, a section responsible for Reich ministerial matters (other than those relating to the Wehrmacht and the police), as well as clemency petitions. Hefelmann's brief was to settle with such matters in as informal a manner as possible.[1354] However, Viktor Brack (q.v.) decided to also allocate the organization of children's euthanasia to this office, with the programme to be directed by Hefelmann and his deputy, Richard von Hegener (q.v.).[1355]\n\nIn the T4 pecking order, Hefelmann was senior to both Werner Heyde (q.v.) and Paul Nitsche (q.v.);[1356] together with Brack and Herbert Linden (q.v.), he had been involved in the planning of children's euthanasia since early 1939.[1357] Later, his participation would extend to adult euthanasia.[1358] For his services to the mass-murder industry, in 1942 Hefelmann was awarded a medal  the War Service Cross Second Class. Philip Bouhler's (q.v.) citation stated:\n\nIn addition to his especially important contributions relating to matters of public health handled by Hauptamt II, party comrade Dr Hefelmann provided the intellectual basis for the implementation of a special task important to the war effort and assigned by the Führer. He directs a separate department with independent responsibility for this special task.[1359]\n\nThis special task was, of course, the killing of children. According to Werner Heyde, in September or October 1939, discussions ensued between interested parties concerning the manner in which the simultaneous death of so many victims of euthanasia could be disguised. Hefelmann came up with the idea of a series of fictitious fatal rail and road accidents, at which point Heyde claimed to have refused to participate if such a ludicrous suggestion was adopted.\n\nLike other leading lights of T4, as the nature of euthanasia changed, and Aktion Reinhard drew to a close, in 1943 Hefelmann was conscripted to serve in the Wehrmacht. He was discharged in March 1944 suffering from malaria and jaundice, to return to T4. In January 1945, together with von Hegener and others, he left Berlin. Hefelmann became director of a refugee camp established at the former asylum in Stadtroda. The medical director of the hospital, Gerhard Kloos (q.v.), having himself been involved in children's euthanasia, knew Hefelmann well. But Hefelmann's stay was brief. He moved first to Munich, then to Innsbrück, before in June 1948, with the assistance of the Catholic charitable organization, Caritas International, he immigrated to Argentina. There he worked in a variety of jobs before finally becoming manager of a German-language bookshop. He returned to the Federal Republic in 1955, and a year later was managing director of a textile business in Waging am See in Bavaria.[1360]\n\nAfter Heyde's arrest in 1959, reasoning with justification that his name was bound to crop up in any forthcoming proceedings (he had made no attempt to disguise his identity), Hefelmann fled again, this time to Spain. But he was unhappy there, and so returned to Germany in August 1960, where he surrendered himself to the public prosecutor's office in Munich.[1361] Accused of participation in the murder of more than 70,000 adults and at least 5,000 children, Hefelmann's trial opened in February 1964. With the aid of a helpful opinion supplied by his good friend Dr Kloos, by then medical director of the Göttingen hospital, six months later Hefelmann was diagnosed as suffering from a progressive metabolic disorder unknown in detail, which had mysteriously developed from the moment of his arrest. Medical experts announced that the unknown illness had resulted in a serious deterioration in Hefelmann's mental and physical capacity, and would result in his demise within two years. Moreover, in their opinion, Hefelmann was no longer able to follow the proceedings with the requisite attention, and was therefore incapable of adequately defending himself. Other medical opinion was more sceptical.\n\nIt took a further eight years of legal wrangling before Hefelmann was finally declared unfit to stand trial; the case against him was abandoned in October 1972. Hefelmann was once again a free man. Amazingly, despite the pessimistic 1964 medical prognosis, Hefelmann survived until 1986. He did not, however, go unpunished; because of his illness, his driver's licence was cancelled.[1362]\n\nRichard von Hegener (1905-1981)[1363] [T4 joint pseudonym with Hans Hefelmann (q.v.), Dr Klein] born in Sensburg, East Prussia, was the son of an army officer. He left school in 1923 to work first for the Dresdner Bank, then for a trucking company, before becoming a statistician for the Association of German Iron and Steel Producers. He joined the NSDAP in 1931, becoming active in local party affairs.[1364] He was unemployed prior to being recruited to the KdF in 1937 through the auspices of Hans Reiter, president of the Reich Health Office, who was his brother-in-law.[1365] Initially working in an office dealing with marriage applications from Mischlinge (individuals of mixed Jewish and Aryan descent  literally, mongrels), in due course he was promoted to the position of Hefelmann's deputy both in Amt IIb and in the children's euthanasia programme.[1366]\n\nTogether with Hefelmann, von Hegener was responsible for the establishment of the Kinderfachabteilungen, or special children's wards, specifically created for the purpose of killing children within existing mental facilities. The pair were also responsible for sifting the forms received under the aegis of the decree of 18 August 1939 requiring doctors and midwives to report various categories of handicapped children. The fact that neither Hefelmann nor von Hegener had any medical training whatsoever was no impediment to their deciding which cases should be passed to the panel of three experts who finally decided on the fate of the child.[1367] In similar terms, and for identical reasons, in 1942 he and Hefelmann were both recommended by Philip Bouhler (q.v.) for the same decoration  the War Service Cross Second Class.[1368] However, the activities of both men had not been limited to solely murdering children. Both were also participants in adult euthanasia, attending meetings and visiting facilities. In practice, there was little administrative distinction between the killing of children and adults.[1369]\n\nAfter the war von Hegener was first employed as a farm worker and then as a carpenter. Dropping the von, he subsequently worked at the Ministry of Trade and Supply in Mecklenburg, where he was quickly promoted. He was arrested in 1951 and charged with crimes against humanity. In 1952, the court in Magdeburg sentenced him to life imprisonment, but he was released in 1956, and with the assistance of his former superior Dieter Allers (q.v.), found employment at the German Shipyard in Hamburg. He testified at the trials of Hefelmann and Allers, but was never subject to further prosecution himself.\n\nAdolf Gustav Kaufmann (1902-1974)[1370] the son of a railway inspector, was born in Przemysl, Poland, then part of the Habsburg Empire. He attended school at Ried im Innkreis in Upper Austria before serving in the Austrian navy during the Great War. At the war's conclusion he trained to become a mechanic. Between 1921 and 1934 he was employed in the commercial department of the Austrian Federal Railways. In 1923 he had joined the SA and the Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei (DNSAP), the predecessor of the Nazi party in Austria. He became a member of the NSDAP in Linz in 1926. After being arrested for possession of weapons and explosives, in 1934 he lost his job with Austrian Railways and spent four months in custody before moving to Germany.\n\nFrom 1935, Kaufmann worked full-time for the SA; in 1937 he was appointed Gauinspektor for Pomerania. Called-up for naval service in 1939, he was granted leave of absence in January 1940 when his personal friend of twenty years, Viktor Brack (q.v.), enlisted him in T4. Kaufman was appointed head of the inspection department,[1371] responsible, among other things, for selecting the institutions that were to become killing centres, refurbishing five out of six of them as necessary for their new task,[1372] and looking after the welfare of those employed at these facilities. He personally supervised the transformation of Brandenburg into a killing centre before turning the new resource over to Irmfried Eberl (q.v.).[1373] Kaufmann visited the killing centres from time to time to ensure all was in order, although despite his regular inspection trips, he claimed never to have seen an actual gassing.[1374] In addition to all of this, he found time to establish a holiday home for T4 personnel at Weissenbach am Attersee in Austria.[1375] He also managed to ensure that his brothers Rudolf and Reinhold were employed by either the KdF or T4.\n\nWith the completion of the first phase of euthanasia, on 31 January 1942 Kaufmann returned to Pomerania as Gauamtsleiter. From October 1942 he was a deputy district head of the Nazi Party in the General District of Taurien in the office of the Reich Commissioner Ukraine. As the tide of war turned, a year later he returned to Pomerania. In July 1944 he was appointed NSDAP-Oberbereichsleiter in Budweis, then in Czechoslovakia.\n\nHaving enjoyed a risk-free wartime career at a variety of jobs within the Nazi party, after the war Kaufmann worked for BMW and as a representative for a manufacturer of laboratory equipment. He was arrested in July 1965, and together with Dieter Allers (q.v.), Reinhold Vorberg (q.v.), and Gerhard Bohne (q.v.), was arraigned before the court in Frankfurt in April 1967. Having been unsuccessful in persuading the court to abandon proceedings against him because of his wife's alleged bedridden medical condition (his plea was not helped when a letter from her was discovered in which she detailed how she had painted the entire house in his absence)[1376] two months later the case against Kaufmann was suspended after he had suffered a heart attack. In September 1969 he was declared permanently unfit to stand trial.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Siegmund Robert Lorent (1905-1988)[1377] the son of a coffee merchant, was born in Bremen. Following an accident he left secondary school and became an agricultural apprentice, but in view of the then unfavourable economic prospects for agriculture, he gave up his apprenticeship and instead joined his father's firm. In December 1930 he became a member of the Nazi party and in October 1932 joined the SA, by whom he was subsequently employed. By January 1934 he had risen to the position of leading manager of the Hanover SA under Viktor Lutze. Following the so-called Night of the Long Knives and the murder of Ernst Röhm in June 1934, Lutze was appointed head of the SA and moved to Berlin, with Lorent accompanying him to become treasurer of the SA head office. Here he met and befriended Viktor Brack (q.v.), an association which led to a falling-out between Lutze and Lorent, with the latter demoted in 1936 to the post of accountant with the National Socialist Relief Organisation for War Casualties (NSKOV), a position he held until the outbreak of war.\n\nLorent served in the military from November 1939 until May 1940, at which point he was transferred by NSKOV to Warsaw and Cracow, where he was employed as accountant to a trust company (Treuhandverwertungsgesellschaft), one of the organisations set up by the Nazis to handle the theft of Polish and (primarily) Jewish property. In autumn 1941 Lorent was appointed manager of a formerly Polish-owned company in Warsaw dealing in building materials. Shortly afterwards he met Brack in Berlin. When he complained to Brack about working conditions in Poland, Brack offered him the position as manager of the Economic Department of T4; despite a substantial resulting reduction in income, Lorent was happy to accept the job.\n\nHe commenced employment with T4 in February 1942, when the first phase of the euthanasia programme had already been terminated. Answerable only to Brack and Werner Blankenburg (q.v.), Lorent and the staff he controlled were responsible for the entire financial and accounting functions of T4, including the ordering of the necessary gas and lethal medications, payment of the salaries of personnel in Germany and in the Aktion Reinhard camps, and overseeing the handling of the valuables of the Jewish victims of the death camps, among other tasks. Lorent was in a unique position to obtain virtually complete knowledge of the activities of T4 and its personnel, visiting most of the principle German euthanasia centres, as well as the Polish extermination camps.[1378] On at least one occasion he personally delivered the possessions of murdered Jews from Poland to Berlin.\n\nLorent was a conscientious and efficient administrator, priding himself on his incorruptibility.[1379] Near the end of the war, he was ordered to take the remaining assets of T4, some 1.2 million Reichsmarks, from Berlin to Bavaria. Due to advancing Allied troops he was unable to comply with this order, and in April 1945 was still carrying around a number of cheques and 87,000 Reichsmarks in cash (the fate of the rest of the cash is uncertain), money he used to pay the salaries of the T4 employees remaining in Berlin. In summer 1945 he passed the balance of the cash, by now reduced to little more than 16,000 Reichsmarks to the Landrat (District Administrator) of the Wesermarsch county, for the care of political prisoners in need.\n\nLorent was interrogated by the American Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), who in September 1946 pronounced him administrative head of `Stiftung' and for all institutions as well as the camps in Poland and Italy Well informed about institutions and camps. Despite his known involvement in such criminal affairs, for reasons unknown Lorent was released, and for the next twenty years remained a free man, living in the town of Nordenham under his own name whilst earning his living as a sales representative.\n\nIn September 1965, Lorent was arrested on suspicion of his involvement in euthanasia. Together with Hans-Joachim Becker (q.v.), he was arraigned before the court in Frankfurt in 1969, accused (in Lorent's case) of complicity in the murder of 4,300 people. Despite his protestations of innocence the court considered Lorent's guilt proven beyond all reasonable doubt, yet still sentenced him to only 7 years' imprisonment. On the court's own admission this was a minimal sentence, which could only approximately atone for the injustice committed. Notwithstanding these sentiments, having served two-thirds of his sentence, Lorent was released[1380]\n\nArnold Oels (1908[1381] -?) became a member of the SA in 1933 and subsequently of the NSDAP.[1382] At the beginning of the war he volunteered for the Waffen-SS. However, his girlfriend, who worked at Hadamar, suggested he join T4,[1383] which he did in November 1940 as deputy to Friedrich Haus (q.v.) in the Personnel Department.[1384] When Haus left for the armed forces in 1943, Oels succeeded him as head of the department. Oels remained with T4 until March 1945, and after the war was employed as travelling salesman.[1385]\n\nFritz Schmiedel (?-?) was a graduate engineer. He was yet another of Viktor Brack's (q.v.) friends to be recruited to T4,[1386] where he succeeded Willy Schneider (q.v.) as head of the Finance Office in August 1941, before he was in turn succeeded by Friedrich Lorent (q.v.) in January 1942.[1387] In 1943 he joined the Waffen-SS. After 1945 he lived under a false name in France, before returning to the Federal Republic in 1951.[1388]\n\nWilly Schneider (1900[1389]-?) the nephew of Alfred Ittner (q.v.), was the first head of T4's Finance Department, a position he relinquished in August 1941.\n\nGerhard Siebert (1905[1390]-?) was a cousin of Viktor Brack (q.v.) and Reinhold Vorberg (q.v.).[1391] He was born in Königsberg and trained as an engineer, joining the NSDAP in 1931. As an employee of T4 he was made Vorberg's deputy at Gekrat, succeeding the latter when Vorberg was dispatched to Russia as part of the Organisation Todt operation in late 1941.[1392]\n\nSiebert visited Treblinka at least once, somewhat improbably claiming to have seen nothing of the extermination of the Jews occurring there. Rather he had merely met a Jewish tailor, who had repaired Siebert's clothes.[1393] Siebert maintained an equal degree of blamelessness concerning his activities at Gekrat, stating: I am innocent of the killing of patients.[1394] His cousin Brack, he maintained was a decent person (ein anständiger Mensch).[1395]\n\nLike many other T4 personnel, Siebert spent some time in Trieste as part of Aktion R.[1396] After 1945 he worked for the Siemens-Schuckert electrical engineering company.\n\nFriedrich Tillmann (1903-1964)[1397] was born in Cologne. On leaving school in 1921 he began a commercial apprenticeship. He had right-wing political sympathies from an early age and in 1923 joined the Nazi party. When the party was banned in November 1923 after the abortive Munich beer hall putsch, Tillmann continued to maintain connections with neo-Nazi organizations, and was readmitted as a party member in June 1925. He worked in Nazi youth associations, thereby ensuring that he was on good terms with many people who would be influential in furthering his career, one of whom was Viktor Brack (q.v.).\n\nHe met with little success in terms of his livelihood, so much so that in 1928 he was excluded from membership of the NSDAP because he could not afford to pay his subscriptions. He managed to join the party for a third and final time in 1933, and took up employment in the welfare department of the Cologne district. In late 1939, Tillmann met Herbert Linden (q.v.), who recruited him for T4. In February or March 1940, Tillmann succeeded Gerhard Bohne (q.v.) and was effectively responsible for the management of the Administrative Office at T4, although Dieter Allers (q.v.) was nominally head of that department.[1398] Tillmann took on this responsibility in addition to his job in Cologne.\n\nTillmann attended monthly meetings of the office managers at the individual killing centres, and on at least one occasion attended a gassing. When it was feared that notification of the deaths of too many people on the same day and in the same place might arouse suspicion, he was the person responsible for organizing the complex cover-up of the location and timing of the murder of the victims. For his dedication to the cause of T4, in 1942 Tillmann was awarded two medals.\n\nAfter the war Tillmann was interned for a short time, and in 1949 unsuccessfully applied for re-employment with the city of Cologne. Instead he was engaged by a number of different children's homes, until in July 1960 he was arrested, accused of participation in the killing of about 70,000 adult inmates of treatment and care institutions. He was then released to await trial,[1399] stating: It is clear to me that my activity contributed to the smooth operation of euthanasia. However, I am not able to see that I thereby made myself punishable.[1400] He apparently had second thoughts, for on 12 February 1964, six days before proceedings against him were to commence, Tillmann jumped to his death from the eighth floor of a Cologne skyscraper.[1401] It is possible this was not the suicide it appeared; the next day, Werner Heyde (q.v.) was found dead in his cell in Butzbach, having apparently hanged himself.[1402] It is all too easy to detect a conspiracy where perhaps none existed, but there were many who had good cause to feel far from unhappy at the sudden demise of two of the leading members of T4.\n\nReinhold Vorberg (1904-1983)[1403] [T4 pseudonym Hintertal,[1404] post T4 pseudonym Heinz Vorberg] was born in Kiel, and like Friedrich Tillmann (q.v.), on leaving school began a commercial apprenticeship, the completion of which three years later[1405] saw him join the so-called Schwarze Reichswehr, an illegal paramilitary branch of the German army. Shortly afterwards he left that organization to work for the Ostbank in Königsberg, where he remained for about a year. 1927/28 saw Vorberg working as a sales representative in Spain. On his return to Germany the following year he assisted his mother for a time in managing family affairs in Königsberg, before in early 1930 he immigrated to a German colony in South-West Africa to pursue an unsuccessful career as a farmer. After that failure he returned to Germany a year later to set up another business with some friends in 1932, selling lighters and jewellery in Berlin. That enterprise was no more successful than Vorberg's other ventures into the world of commerce, it being declared bankrupt in 1935.[1406]\n\nVorberg had joined the Nazi party in 1929, and in about 1936/37 a party comrade offered him an unpaid job in the mailroom at the KdF. A little later he obtained paid employment at the KdF and shortly thereafter his cousin, Viktor Brack (q.v.), appointed him head of Amt IIc of the organisation, the department dealing with matters concerning the armed forces, the police, the SS, and churches.[1407] Vorberg was conscripted into the Wehrmacht on the outbreak of war, and served with an engineers' unit in Poland. However, on the conclusion of the Polish campaign his military service was suspended and he was recalled to Berlin, where Philip Bouhler (q.v.) informed him of the euthanasia programme, and offered him the position of head of T4's transport division, the Gemeinnütziger Krankentransport GmbH, or Gekrat (the Charitable Society for the Transportation of the Sick Limited). Vorberg accepted the offer with alacrity.\n\nAs general manager of Gekrat, and thus responsible for organizing all aspects of the transportation of victims, Vorberg was in constant communication with the leading officials of T4. He visited the killing centres, corresponded with other feeder institutions, organized the actual transports, and even arranged petrol rations for the bus drivers. He was of sufficient importance within the organisation to be Brack's third deputy, after Werner Blankenburg (q.v.) and Hans Hefelmann (q.v.).\n\nAfter the suspension of euthanasia in August 1941, Vorberg was a member of the T4 Organisation Todt mission to Russia, but returned to Berlin a few months later to resume his position at the KdF, where he remained until almost the end of the war. In early 1945, together with other leading members of the Chancellery he was flown to Bavaria, where plans for a new office disintegrated as the war ended. Bearing false identity papers, Vorberg was captured by the Americans, but was released after a few weeks. He settled in the Munich region, and worked on a chicken farm, continuing to correspond with Brack so that when the latter was arrested the Americans found and arrested Vorberg too. The two of them were interned in the prisoner-of-war camp at Moosburg, where Vorburg contrived a false identity  Heinz Vorberg, born 1 June 1906 in Juditten, East Prussia. Since this region was under Soviet occupation, it made it all but impossible to verify these bogus credentials.[1408]\n\nVorberg escaped from the camp and became a forester in Schleswig-Holstein until he was dismissed from this job in 1948. He was briefly detained by the British before settling in the town of Neuss and working in a fertilizer factory. After a while he moved to Freiburg, where together with Reinhold Siebert [brother of Gerhard (q.v.)], he opened an enamel factory. Needless to say this enterprise failed too, and it was not until 1952 that Vorberg found what he must have hoped was some kind of permanent employment at a tile factory in Bonn. But this too was not to last, for in 1961, with the probability of his arrest looming, Vorberg suddenly resigned from his job and fled to Spain. Here, under another Fascist regime he felt secure; however, as could be anticipated, he had misjudged the situation. In November 1962 he was extradited to Germany, and taken into pre-trial confinement.[1409]\n\nWhen his trial began together with that of Dieter Allers (q.v.) in April 1967, Vorberg stood in the dock accused of participation in the murder of 70,273 persons. There was little doubt concerning the guilt of either defendant, although the court still found sufficient extenuating circumstances in Vorberg's case to restrict his sentence to ten years' imprisonment, rather than the life sentence it could have imposed. In October 1972, allowance having been made for the period of his pre-trial confinement, both in Germany and in Spain,[1410] Vorberg was released from custody.[1411]\n\nThere appears to have been little in Vorberg's miserable history as a businessman and would-be entrepreneur to recommend him to T4 for such a responsible position, other than his relatively early membership of the NSDAP and his familial ties to Brack and Siebert. If Vorberg can be seen as a classic example of the Schreibtischtäter, the desk murderer, it is worth bearing in mind his presence at the experimental gassing at Brandenburg in winter 1939/40.[1412] He had seen for himself the consequences of the activities he organized so willingly at Gekrat.\n\nPaul Werner (1900-1970)[1413] was born in Appenweier, Baden-Württemberg, the son of a railroad supervisor, and served in the armed forces during the last months of the Great War. At the war's conclusion he studied law at Heidelberg and Freiburg, and after qualification, was appointed an auxiliary public prosecutor in Baden, before going on to serve as a prosecutor in Offenburg and Pforzheim. In 1933 he became District Court Advisor in Lörrach, and joined the Nazi party in May of that year.\n\nIn early September 1933, Werner was appointed head of the state criminal police agency of Baden in Karlsruhe. His success in this position led to his 1937 promotion as deputy to Arthur Nebe, head of the newly formed Reich Criminal Office (Reichskriminalpolizeiamtes - RKPA) in Berlin. Werner enthusiastically endorsed the Criminal Police strategy of preventing crime on the basis of hereditary characteristics:\n\nIf a criminal or asocial person has ancestors who also led a criminal or asocial life the results of hereditary research have shown that the person's behaviour is hereditarily conditioned. Such a person must be treated with differently than a person who comes from a respectable family The criminal is no longer regarded as an individual person, and his crimes are no longer regarded as individual crimes.[1414]\n\nHereditary criminals such as Gypsies were, in Werner's view, primarily a racial problem.[1415] In this he was later to find an enthusiastic accomplice in Robert Ritter (q.v).\n\nOn 27 September 1939 the RKPA became Department V of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA). In 1963 Hans Hefelmann (q.v.) stated that Werner had been the RKPA's contact with Reinhold Vorberg (q.v.), head of Gekrat. Together with Nebe, Werner had met in August 1939 with Viktor Brack (q.v.) at the KdF to discuss the proposed euthanasia programme. Nebe thereupon appointed Albert Widmann (q.v.) to advise T4 regarding suitable killing techniques. According to Hefelmann, Werner had been responsible for procuring killing agents such as morphine ampoules and Luminal tablets for T4.[1416] As mentioned earlier, it was Werner who had first interviewed Franz Stangl (q.v.) for T4, explaining to him the virtues of euthanasia.\n\nFrom spring 1942 to early 1943, Werner was employed by the German criminal police offices in Paris, Brussels and the Hague. In March 1943 he returned to the RSHA and remained there until the end of the war, following which his police career came to an end. Instead, following denazification (which determined he had been a sympathizer), he served in a senior capacity in the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of the Interior. In 1955 he was even proposed as head of the Federal Criminal Investigation Office (Bundeskriminalamts). Fortunately this promotion failed due to the opposition of officials of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.\n\nAlthough a preliminary investigation into his wartime activities by the public prosecutor's office in Stuttgart was dropped in 1962, unlike many others Werner made no attempt to feign ignorance of the Holocaust. In a statement before the chief public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt in November 1962, Werner stated: Naturally I knew of the Einsatzkommandos in the east and of Auschwitz.[1417]\n\n* * *\n\nPhysicians, Nurses, and Scientists\n\nErnst Baumhard (1911-1943) [T4 pseudonym Dr Jäger at Grafeneck, Dr Moos at Hadamar][1418] was born in Ammendorf, near Halle, the son of a doctor. He joined the SA in 1934 and the Nazi party in 1937.[1419] After leaving school he studied medicine at the University of Halle, in 1938 becoming leader of the medical section of the university's Student Union. A totally committed Nazi, in May 1938 he was received by Adolf Hitler in person as a winner of Reichsberufswettkampf, a competition that was held from 1934 to 1939 for young Nazis who had displayed unswerving dedication to the cause of Nazism in the theory and practice of their vocation or profession.\n\nBaumhard received his medical licence and doctorate on 1 September 1939,[1420] and worked for a short time at the Barbarakrankenhaus in Halle. He was recruited by T4 on 1 November 1939, and was among those present at the Brandenburg gassing demonstration in winter 1939-40.[1421] In early 1940 he was appointed Horst Schumann's (q.v.) assistant at Grafeneck, before succeeding the latter in April 1940. When Grafeneck closed in December 1940, Baumhard took up the position of physician-in-charge at Hadamar.[1422] Under Baumhard's direction, busloads of patients arrived daily at Hadamar for gassing from mid-January 1941.\n\nBaumhard was party to a rather odd incident at Grafeneck involving the death of a nurse, Anne H. in mysterious circumstances. According to the somewhat unclear testimony of an eyewitness:\n\nIn the summer of 1940, when I was in bed with a concussion, it was on 4 June 1940, a transport arrived in which there was someone who suffered from leprosy. According to the male nurse the leper's face had already been eaten away. The leper was shot immediately by Dr.Baumhard, to prevent infection. Dr. Baumhard ordered all of us to stay where we were. But head nurse H. from the Rhine country jumped to the other [meaning the dangerous] side and was hit fatally by the bullet. Dr. Baumhard, who told me about this himself, was in deep trouble because of the incident, and wanted to commit suicide.[1423]\n\nAfter either falling out with Viktor Brack (q.v.) or simply seeking an escape from euthanasia, Baumhard resigned from T4 in August 1941 to enlist in the navy as a U-boat doctor, and in this capacity was killed in action in June 1943.\n\nAugust Becker (1900 -1967)[1424] [nicknamed Rot (Red)], was born in Staufenberg, Hesse. He was conscripted towards the end of the Great War, following which he studied chemistry and physics at the University of Giessen, obtaining a doctorate in the former subject in 1933. He joined the NSDAP in 1930 and the SS in 1931, and elected for a career within the Nazi movement, briefly working in 1934 for the Gestapo in Giessen before joining the SS regiment Germania, with whom he continued to serve until 1938 when he was transferred to Berlin, to join the RSHA on the formation of that organisation to work as a chemist. In October 1939, Becker travelled to Posen, where in Fort VII he constructed a gas chamber. There he tested the relative efficacy of carbon monoxide and an agent similar to Zyklon B on patients from Polish mental hospitals, judging carbon monoxide the superior killing medium.["
