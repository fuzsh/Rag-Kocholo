Inc. 515 Madison Avenue, New York 22, N. Y. Summer Issue, 1957 ltlillffa Z[. In. #oIv? JJtiA.0Aob.Gem? The situation in the Middle East continues to be fraught-with grave dangers to world peace. Unless posi- tive and effective action is taken to thwart those forces which wilfully keep tensions alive and to solve the burn- ing issues in that area, mankind may be faced with the awful spectre of World War III. In the Society's statement \"The U. N. and the Middle East Crisis\" (November 1956) the observation was made that \"for years it has been politically expedient for states- men to pretend there was peace in this vital area.\" The U. N. itself became the main vehicle through which the real situation was concealed. Consequently, the U. N. Charter, as it- applied- to the Middle -East, was a virtual dead letter. When Britain, France and Israel embarked on military operations against Egypt, the U. N. was quick to condemn them. In retrospect, it is now clear that whatever one may have thought about their moves, they focussed world attention on a festering sore which had been eating away at the prestige and usefulness of the United Nations. For the first time since the State of Israel was born, fundamental elements making for conflict in the Middle East, are spotlighted. The \"pure and simple aggression\" which originally described the military action, has lost much of its weight as the history of Nasser's endless provocations and lawless deeds were catalogued before the bar of world public opinion. Viewed in this light, the conflict with Egypt can now be traced directly to the insatiable ambitions of the Cairo \"strong man.\" It was mainly through the deceit of the Dictator and his agents that the legitimate aspirations of the Arab peoples were turned into an irrational force of hate and enmity. The ceaseless harrassing of Israel marked by cold- blooded physical violence and economic attrition was the microcosm of the larger conflict between Nasser and the West. If Israel could be forced to bend the knee, the whole Middle East would fall into Nasser's lap, leading to economic strangulation of our most reliable allies in Western Europe. This was Nasser's calculation. If it had been realized, U. S. security would have been placed in the greatest jeopardy since Hitler's planned invasion of the British Isles. Nasser, of course, did not possess the wherewithal to challenge the West without concrete help from outside sources. Though a self-proclaimed anti-Communist, the mutual advantages gained by Hitler and Stalin in their 1939 pact, could hardly be ignored by Nasser and his top German advisors. Thus, the \"mariage de convenance\" between Nasser and Khruchev was a logical and essen- tial ingredient in the successful development of his plans. All of the hidden ramifications of Nasser's conspiracy were disclosed by the short-lived military, campaign. They. constituted nothing less than a major threat to world peace and security. Yet, the initial reaction of U. S. policy makers toward the conflict was essentially the continuation of the old line. This. position proved to be decisive during the deliberations of the United Nations in November 1956. As in the past, the U. N. devoted its efforts to the surface manifestations while glossing over the basic issues which had turned the Middle East into a caldron of strife and unrest. However, the force of events and the growing awareness of millions throughout the world who may have been blinded by Nasser's cunning propaganda, began to make their impression. Today, our policy makers are beginning to \"understand\" that the real issues in the Middle East crisis can no longer be swept under the rug. What are some of the major problems which block progress toward peace in the Middle East? Nasser's policy of belligerency toward Israel: The denial of Israel's sovereign rights through unlawful eco- nomic blockade and acts of physical terror and attack run counter to the U. N. Charter and violate resolutions adopted by the Security Council. In terms of its own security, the West can no longer sit by and accept as a matter of course Nasser's defiance on this question. In this connection, a hopeful sign is the President's view that \"free and innocent passage\" in the Gulf of Aqaba is in accordance with international law. As a logical sequence Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 to the President's position, support of all nations' rights of passage through the Suez Canal, including Israel, must be unequivocal. The problem of the Arab refugees: For a number of years Arab propaganda has endeavored to discredit Israel as responsible for the miserable conditions of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Yet, it is a matter of historical record that the Israeli Government has time and again offered to work out an equitable agreement with the Arab states so as to alleviate the hardships of these unfor- tunate people. It is also a matter of record that the Arab leadership, egged on particularly by Nasser, has rejected such overtures for negotiations. The reason is not hard to find. The Arab leadership looks upon these refugees as pawns whose plight is to be exploited for ulterior motives. The refugee problem would have never developed in its present sharp form, had not the Arab leaders made war on Israel in the first place, and having done so, in- duced the Arabs living in Israeli territory to leave. That the Arabs continue to stall on the question of providing a just solution is indicated by reports of U. N. officials, Fortunately, public opinion is getting to know these facts and this is reflected in new efforts by the United Nations as well as by our own representatives at the U. N. to solve this problem in a concrete and just manner for all concerned. The continuation of hate-inciting propaganda: In the No. 49 issue (Winter-Spring 1957) of Prevent World War III the Society noted that Arab propaganda against the West and Israel was a fundamental impediment to the establishment of normal conditions in the Middle East. \"Those leaders who purvey poisonous propaganda, help to create a climate of blind hatred which may prove to be uncontrollable among peoples who are kept igno- rant as to the real state of affairs. As a result, a change from a policy of hostility to one of peace and mutual accommodation becomes virtually impossible, even when the long term interests of the country concerned require it. lr/hen a people are infected by artificially whipped up hatred, those who are responsible for this state of mind become prisoners of it. They are no longer able to act in a statesmanlike manner which is imperative i f the country's welfare is to be safeguarded.\" In this connection, it is interesting to note that anti- American propaganda emanating from Egypt predates the decision of our Government to withhold financial support for the Aswan Dam project. Many people have been un- der the impression that the Nasser regime began to talk Sough after that episode. The facts show that this is not the case. For example, the Cairo Radio (Oduber 11, 1955) denounced the Mutual Security Program as a weapon by which the United States hoped to \"penetrate\" the Middle East. On October 14, 1955, the Cairo Radio proclaimed: \"Justice and logic require that we now defend Russia and attack America, which has shown falsehood, deceit, and ill-:dill.\" The outpourings of poisonous propaganda against the United States, the West and Israel continues un- abated, particularly from Egypt and Syria. We cite below a sampling of this propaganda which dominates the news- papers and airways of these countries: \"It is being said that we peoples of the colonies should support Christianity and fight for the democ- racy of the Western states, threatened with being uprooted. `Arc not these things the cause of the oppression and servility a f flictlnp us?' \"But which states are detonating atomic and hy- drogen bombs? The Christian Western states, which are appealing to iris to help them preserve their civ- ilization. Whose civilization is responsible for dis- crimination among people because of color? The civilization of the Western states. `These Western states, whose Christian religion eulogizes fraternal love and equality of human bein s, are foremost in destroying the lives of their fellowmen in Japan, Kenya, Algeria, Port Said, Malaya, South Africa, and elsewhere. The same states were responsible for the Jews seizing the property and homeland of the people of Palestine.' \" (Cairo Radio, 6-9-57.) \"'The former Jordanian government which was oppled by the American imperialists with the help the palace and its plotting group was loyal to these agreements.' \"The imperialists and their foster child Israel received these agreements calling for cooperation with hatred and anger. They continued working with their agents in Jordan, as they still work with their agents in Syria, until they were successful in terttporarily altering the situation in Jordan. They destroyed the agreements of honor and glory, vio- lated the principles of Arab policy, maltreated the people, and filled the prisons with thousands of detainees including officers, soldiers, and citizens.\" (Syrian newspaper AN-NASIR quoted by the Cairo Radio, 6-14-57.) \"Only a few million dollars have thrown a national government in Jordan out of office. Only a few mil- lion emboldened the Lebanese Premier and Foreign Minister. A f cw millions convinced Nuri as-Said to relinquish power after he had spread terrorism in every inch of Iraq to prepare the way for his masters for a new alliance. \"But do these leaders, these governments, and their supporters at least know :chat they are worth in the eyes of America? Did they ever consider how much Israel is receiving compared with what they take themselves, and what Israel is paying? They content themselves with the crumbs while Israel is receiving Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 billions. They sacrifice their interests and the future of their countries. They sacrifice even their very existence and expose themselves to the wrath of their peoples, while Israel pays nothing unless realization of its aims happens-to result in a disadvantage to it.\" (Egyptian newspaper ASH-SHAB, 6-17-57.) The war-like character of this propaganda is obvious. \"It goes beyond the normal practices of exhortation to patriotism as it whips the mind of the people into a state of blind hatred\" (The U. N. and the Middle East Crisis). It creates a war psychosis. Peace in the Middle East cannot be built in the path of this hurricane of hate. Therefore, it should be a cardinal task of western statesmanship to work for the curbing of this propaganda. Though the Middle East situation is in a state of flux at the present time, there are signs that Nasser's game is beginning to lose its effectiveness. Even those Arab states which have provided an important base for Nasser's operations, are shying away from his domineering and grasping tactics (see p.- 24.) It is certain that Nasser will try by all means to prevent the disintegration of his Pan- Arabic scheme and, therefore, one must anticipate that he will resort to desperate measures. The appearance of contingents of the Russian Navy in Middle Eastern waters and the delivery of Russian submarines to Cairo must be viewed in this light. New provocations against the State of Israel which has tirelessly sought a peaceful settlement, may be employed by Nasser so as to bolster his prestige. Whatever Nasser's plans, however, they will fail if the United States acts with determination. In concert with our western allies, our Government should insist that the United Nations grapples once and for all with the fun- . Nasser has used his merely nuisance value more skillfully, by far, than Hitler or Mussolini ever did. Hitler possessed the enorm- ous industrial and military power of Germany plus the discipline of the German people. Mus- solini used to be called a sawdust Caesar, but at least he had the military power to conquer Ethiopia, Possibly even Ethiopia and demon- strably Israel could conquer Egypt today, and would gladly do so, if the Western powers whom Colonel Nasser thwarts would stand aside and give their permission. \"The crowning irony of the business is that Colonel Nasser owes his security most to the country whose interests he most injures. \"And yet it has been the United States which has protected Colonel Nasser in his adventures and which saved him from the logical conse- quences when Britain and France set out to bring him down. He survives today in his palace in Cairo by grace of Washington, and th? UN, the Soviet Union, and Asian-African opinion. It takes real skill to parley such meager assets into such power....\" (Joseph C. Harsch, Christian Science Monitor, 3-27-57) damental issues involved in the crisis. The Society is under no illusions with regard to the complexity and difficulties attending the situation in the Middle East. Yet, we are confident that the United Na- tions with the active support of the United States and all freedom-loving countries can achieve positive results. In this connection we advocate the adoption of a program resting on the following principles: 1. Unity of action in the Middle East with France and England; 2. Protection of the sovereignty of all Middle East- ern states, as envisioned by the Eisenhower Doc- trine. 3. A fundamental Israeli-Arab settlement of out- standing differences through peaceful negotia- tions; 4. Insistence that all hate-inciting propaganda in the Middle East against the West cease and that Arab leaders publicly recognize the rights of the Israeli people to live a normal economic life with all of her neighbors; 5. A U. N. program to help the distressed Arab refugees and to contribute to the development of the resources of all the Middle Eastern countries. If the actions of the United States are based on these principles of justice, we shall have safeguarded our own interests while, at the same time, given new faith and con- fidence in the United Nations as man's best hope for world peace. \"I HAVEN'T LAID A HAND ON HER\" Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 The accuracy of this \"jest\" became painfully clear on the eve of the Summit meeting in Geneva in 1955. Ade- nauer was not officially present, but his voice in Allied councils was heard above all. On the eve of the meeting, Business Week, 6-18-55, observed that in the whole question of disarmament and collective security \"Adenauer will play a leading part\" at Geneva. This authoritative publication further reported that the Chancellor \"has been giving Eisenhower and then Dulles, MacMillan and Pinay, a fill-in on the ne- gotiating position he wants the West to take.\" The course of the Geneva Conference and the reports emanating therefrom indicated that Adenauer's hand de- termined many of the major moves of the Allied powers. When Anthony Eden put forth the idea of a demilitarized zone in Europe, Adenauer vigorously protested. Accord- ingly, the Allies dropped the plan. Adenauer's obstructive tactics contributed in no small part toward the inconclu- siveness of the Geneva meeting. This was precisely the precondition for his own journey to Moscow in September 1955 where he made his deals with the Russians. Though Adenauer had blocked serious consideration of the Eden plan, he welcomed the Russian proposal of November 17th, 1956, which, in principle at least, resembled Eden's idea. (N. Y. Times, 1-11-57) Indeed, the Chancellor went further and called for the prohibition of the use of thermonuclear weapons which in the words of one U. S. official \"is playing into the Russian hands.\" (N. Y. Times, 1-11-57) In early May of this year, Adenauer told the press that his government would \"gladly agree to (aerial) in- spection.\" On May 21st, 1957, the Bulletin, published by the Bonn Government, elaborated on Adenauer's view, \"The Federal Republic would agree to aerial inspection of the Federal territory, provided that the 'open-skies' sys- tem would also cover a corresponding area beyond the Iron Curtain; such an aerial inspection would be only the first step towards disarmament; therefore, the reuni- fication of Germany is not considered by the Federal Gov- ernment a prerequisite for trying out the 'open-skies' plan ...\" It was only when disarmament negotiations in London showed promise that the Chancellor hurried to Washing- ton. Once again it was the Adenauer of the Geneva days. He insisted that aerial inspection of Germany would have to wait until the Russians showed greater inclination to go forward on the reunification of Germany. As regards future meetings of the Big Four Foreign Ministers, Ade- nauer told the President that this might be permissible following the \"conclusion of an initial disarmament agree- ment.\" By blocking the aerial inspection plan, Adenauer had automatically scuttled the possibilities of Big Four nego- tiations even though, for the record, he said they were permissible. WHO MAKES POLICY? At the height of the Middle East crisis, Vice President Nixon hailed the Administration's break with Anglo- French policies as a \"declaration of independence that had an electrifying effect throughout the world.\" Seven months later, Secretary Dulles announced that \"In anything which touched directly or indirectly upon Germany and its prospects for reunification, we would act only in the closest concert with Chancellor Adenauer.\" The Nixon-Dulles pronunciamentos are essentially linked to each other and reflect the present basis of U. S. foreign policy. The Chicago Tribune correspondent spelled out this shift reporting on the Nato Conference in May of this year, \"Adenauer's talks today with Dulles added to the impression in some quarters that a Bonn-Washington tie-up had replaced the western big three of Britain, France, and the United States as the prime movers behind the Atlantic pact ... \"Observers said that there was no sign of reviving con- sultations among the United States, Britain, and France, a common practice before Britain and France launched their ill-fated attack on Egypt. \"Even the Nato council statement last night reflected the image of a Washington-Bonn axis in the emphasis on German reunification, the observers said ...\" (5-5-57) Let it not be forgotten that the change in U. S. foreign policy comes less than a dozen years after American GIs shed their blood with our British and French Allies in freedom's defense against German aggression. The \"Washington-Bonn Axis\" received further support during Adenauer's latest visit to the U. S. A. As a short- term proposition his talks with the President and Secre- tary of State were summed up by the London Economist, \"The aim of Dr. Adenauer's fifth visit to the U. S. was to give a decisive boost to his election campaign. It has been achieved.\" (6-1-57) However, much more was accomplished by way of lasting value to Adenauer and the Germans. The radio commentator, Fulton J. Lewis, after praising Adenauer effusively as one of the \"greatest political leaders of the century,\" declared that the conference in Washington gave West Germany \"a guaranty of veto power\" over American foreign policy. That \"veto power\" culminates a trend that became discernible shortly after the end of World War II. Thus, by 1953 a German newspaper, the Deutsche Zeitung, was able to report a popular quip making the round in Ger- many, \"Who makes Washington's European policy? Kon- rad Adenauer in Bonn.\" Approved For Release 2006/11/21 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 Approved For Release, 2006/11/21 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 As we go to press, Adenauer seems to have reversed himself again, intimating that he might approve aerial inspection for West Germany. Whether the new sommer- sault is due to electioneering considerations, or serves as a decoy to distract attention while he hamstrings disarma- ment negotiations by other means, remains to be seen. In any event, the twists and turns in Adenauer's tactics have but one central objective, i.e., paralyze U. S. policy while leaving the Chancellor free to bargain with the Russians and to prove his usefulness to them. This is the kind of diplomacy which has strong advo- cates in Germany today. In this connection, the Christian Science Monitor, 6-4-57, reported \"with unanimity indica- tive of common origin much of the press here, June 4, advocated a more supple foreign policy for West Ger- many\" ... vis-a-vis the Soviets. No matter' what the rationalizations in defense of the \"Washington-Bonn Axis,\" the Society, for one, cannot reconcile itself to a situation where vital aspects of our foreign policy are subject to the \"nods and nays\" of an alien politician representing a power which has twice challenged our security and independence within one generation. Much has been said and written about the Status of Forces Treaties which, according to critics, deprive our servicemen abroad of their constitutional rights. Yet, hardly anyone has raised an eyebrow over the Adenauer- Eisenhower communique which placed an official stamp on Bonn's \"veto\" on foreign policies bearing upon the very security of our country. 11. . . We need have no illusions about the difficulty of coming to an agreement among ourselves and with Russia which would limit and stabilize the competition in armaments. But this is the central and overriding task today as was the recovery of Western Europe ten years ago. \"The task is certainly not to disarm while the world is so divided. Perhaps it is not even to reduce substantially the present scale of arma- ments. The task is to bring the competition it- self under international control before it be- comes intolerably costly, and before the ten- sions of the nuclear testing and of the threat of nuclear war brings us to some breaking point. Walter Lipprnann, N. Y. Herald Tribune, 6-18-57) \"The blunt, inside fact of the disarmament talks is that Russia jumped and took over much of the U. S. disarmament plan while the United States was bickering over two things: \"1. Old Guard Republican prejudice against modern Republican Harold Stassen as the dis- armament negotiator. \"2. The traditional Dulles determination to put Germany ahead of peace with Russia. \"The Secretary of State has always bowed from the waist when anything German ap- proaches, dating from the days when, as attor- ney for New York banks he urged the American public to invest in now worthless German bonds. So when reelection-worried Adenauer demand- ed that German unification come before dis- armament agreement, Dulles got jittery.\" . . . Drew Pearson, 6-10-57) \"The French newspaper `Combat' writes as follows to the appointment of General Dr. Speidel to the command of Nato forces. \" `Above all let us not be plagued by the childish argument, even more despicable than cynical, that Speidel was not a Nazi. If that were true then the affair Speidel would only be much worse. If, for a cause he did- not be- lieve in, he was responsible for having created martyrs, he would be a monster. We want to believe in Speidel's own interest that he was a Nazi.' \"Let it be said that such an `exoneration' or `de-nazification' is fairly bitter for a proven anti-Nazi!\" (Deutsche Wochenzeitung, 5-9-57) DANGEROUS MARRIAGE Deutsche Volkszeitung Approved For Release 2006/11/21 CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 jitd4iltQ On By WALTER LUPPMANN D The noted political analyrt, Mr, I!'`alter Lippnrann. has achieved an international reputation for his brilliant conrnmentaires on international Affairs. In this Connection. the New Republic published a surrey by Mr. Lippnrann prepared originally as a Gideon D. Seyniour Memorial lecture at the University of Minnesota. II'e hare re- printed what we believe to be the highlights of Mr. Lippmann's analysis. No one, I think, not even at the lop of affairs and there- fore on the inside of all of the available information, can as yet see clearly, can as yet see as a whole, where we really are and where we ought to go. Everyone knows, of course, that we are in a time of rapid, radical and complicated change. Now, in itself, change is far from being a new experience for the generation to which I belong. We have lived amidst great events for which we were unprepared. We have become involved in wars which we expected to stay out of. We have hoped great things from victory and we have never seen a good peace. But now, if I may put it that way, the world is changed for Americans, not only in the degree of our involvement with the outer world,' but in the very kind of our involvement with the rest of the world. Throughout the 19th Century, and during the two world wars of this century, we have thought that we were living in one world. We have thought that this world had its po- litical center in the western society, the society which con- sists of Europe and the Americas, the society to which we belong. Even the most anti-imperialistic among us has assumed this. We have supposed that all the nations--the old ones who were breaking with the past, the new ones who were emerging from colonial status-that all the nations would have the same fundamental political ideals which we have. not because they are our ideals but because these ideals are universal. The greatest and most fundamental change of our time is that this picture of ourselves and of our place in the world and of our role in the history of mankind is no longer valid. The culture, the ideology of the western society is no longer recognized as universal. It is challenged as it has not been challenged since Christendom was challenged by the expan- sion of Islam. The one world which we always have taken for granted in our thinking has been succeeded by many worlds. We now live amidst these many worlds. They compete with one an- other, they coexist with one another. They trade with one another and, in varying degrees, they co-operate with one another. This change from one world to several worlds is a deep change. It is a change not only in what we think about our foreign policy but in the very way that we have to think about it.... When the war ended in 1918, we hoped and believed that we had won a victory for the idea that the principles and ideals of the Western society are universal. Woodrow Wil- son proclaimed a world order. But it was a world order based on our Western principles and ideals. Moreover, it was to be an order in which the nations of the North Atlantic re- gion would continue to be the political leaders of mankind ... We now know that this was a brilliant illusion. Both France and Britain were profoundly weakened by their fear- ful losses in the First World War. As representatives of the Western philosophy, they were challenged as imperialists over all Asia and Africa. We did not know this in 1918. We took it for granted that with American military and fi- nancial help the worldwide predominance of the Atlantic community would continue. In the Second World War, the role played by the United States was no longer that of an associated power bringing up the reinforcements and the reserves. But before Pearl Har- bor, and before we actually entered the Second World War, we still thought of ourselves in terms of World War 1. We used to talk, you may remember, about aiding the Allies to defend America. In fact, however, it was soon plain that we must take up the whole burden of the war in the Pacific, including the defense of Australia and of New Zealand. In Europe, the French Army had been defeated and Great Britain was under violent assault and strained to the limit. We had not only to supply the weapons and other economic neces- sities, but we had to raise a great army ourselves. The difference between the two world wars is marked by the fact that in the second, as distinguished from the first, the supreme commanders on sea and on land were Ameri- cans. Nevertheless, until World War II ended, we could still believe-perhaps I should say that we tried still to believe- that when Britain and France and Western Europe recovered from the damages of the war, the North Atlantic community would still be the political center of the world. I venture to believe that in the last analysis this was the underlying assumption in the minds of both Churchill and Roosevelt at the close of the war., They believed that with Britain and America acting as partners, they could handle Russia and have the deciding voice in the postwar settlement. They were mistaken.... The greatest powers with which we have to concern our- selves are no longer in the North Atlantic region. They are in eastern Europe and in Asia. While the welfare of the Atlantic community is a close and vital interest of the United States, the Atlantic community is no longer the political center of the world.

As a result of the Yalta conference the world was divided into two great spheres of influence. In the one sphere, where the Soviet Union was supreme, Stalin tried to create a new Russian Empire. This empire was founded primarily on the power of the Red Army. In fact, the empire was the territory occupied by the Red army. Stalin's purpose was to make the people of Eastern Europe docile satellites or colonies of the new Russian Empire. The other sphere comprised the rest of the world. It was an unorganized collection of old and new states. It consisted not only of Western Europe, Latin America, and the United States, but also of the old European empires, which then ex- tended across North Africa, Egypt, and the Middle East through India and Southeast Asia to the Dutch Empire in Indonesia. In this sphere, the United States took the ini- tiative in trying to make sure that the Soviet Union did not extend its empire. As the principal military arm of the Communist sphere was the Red army, so the principal military arm of the non- Communist sphere was the United States Strategic Air Force equipped with atomic bombs. This situation lasted until about 1950, as long as only the Soviets had an effective army and only the United States had the atomic bomb. In this uneasy balance of power, the Red army was supreme on the ground in all of Europe and Asia; the United States Strategic Air Force was supreme in the air over Europe and Asia. Each acted as a` deterrent on the other. As against an invasion by the Red army, Western Europe was wholly defenseless. Yet the Red army did not and could not overrun Western Europe. It was contained because the Krem- lin knew what the United States Air Force could do to Russian cities. On the other hand, one might say vice versa, the United States was held in check by the Red army. Let me say a word about how we were held in check. The very highest Ameri- can military authorities knew that if we struck at the Rus- sian cities, the Red army, which was already in Eastern En- rope, would overrun Western Europe. It would occupy the countries of Western Europe against which we could not use the atomic bomb, countries such as Western Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. When the Red army did that it would destroy the existing governments. It would liqui- date the existing leaders in all classes and, before it could be forced to retire, it would probably destroy the big cities and the industrial plants of Western Europe. This was the postwar stalemate, the Red army as against the atomic bomb.... It was when he realized this, that President Eisenhower made his historic declaration that there is now no alternative to peace. The Russians had also realized what the revolution in military weapons meant: This common realization in Moscow and Washington led to the famous meeting at the summit, which took place in Geneva a year and a half ago, in July of 1955. At that meeting, Russia and the United States acknowledged publicly to each other and before the . Contrary to widespread assumptions in the United Nations and in Washington, the issue is not originally the result of Israel's armed in- vasion of Egypt. The issue was raised by Egypt's long-standing insistence on maintaining a `state of war' with Israel and implementing it by both guerrilla raids and a double blockade in the Suez Canal and the Strait of Tiran. It was this Egyptian maintenance of a `state of war' and the exercise of belligerent rights which Egypt derives therefrom that resulted in Israel's military counter-action. Egypt has made no public move or promise to end the `state of war' or to re- nounce the belligerent rights. \"The Egyptian claim to belligerent rights un- der its self-proclaimed `state of war' against another United Nations member is both absurd and illegal. It is ruled out not only by the Charter, which bars the use or threat of force in settling international disputes, but also by the armistice agreement of 1949, which Secretary General Hammarskjold interprets as a virtual nonaggression pact. It was specifically rejected by the Security Council in 1951, when it denied Egypt any belligerent blockade rights.... \"In these circumstances it would seem that the first duty of the United Nations should be to call on Egypt to end the `state of war' and renounce its claim to belligerent rights as a first condition of peace in the Middle East....\" (Editorial, N.

At the time of the Geneva meeting, we were all aware that, beyond these mutual declarations against war, there were no serious agreements reached, or even brought any nearer, on any of the great practical issues of the time-- on, for example, the reunification of the two Germanies, on the problem of the status of the satellites in Eastern Europe, on the future of the Middle East. There is no way of telling whether or not the opportunity existed to go on from Geneva to settlements of some of these problems. If the opportunity existed, it was missed. On our side, the President fell ill and was unable for some time to take the initiative in foreign affairs. On the other side, the Russians stood pat and were unyielding. We do not know what might have been. But what has actually hap- pened is that while we have come no nearer to settlements in Europe, in the Middle East and in the Far East, there has been a rapid disintegration of empires and of alliances. We can see what has happened to the French in North Africa and the British in the Middle East. We know from what has happened in Poland and in Hungary that the Soviet empire in eastern Europe is undermined, and that the Soviet military system, which is known as the Warsaw Pact, is profoundly affected. We know that if NATO is going to survive, it is going to have a very different future from what we expected. A few months ago, at the end of October, the course of events, which I have been describing, burst into violence. It is a remarkable fact, which historians will long be studying and trying to explain, that the explosion in Hungary and the explosion in Egypt took place at approximately the same time. The fact that the two explosions came so very close together may not have been a mere accident. It may well be that the Israeli Government decided to strike when it saw that the Soviet Union was deeply entangled by the rebellion in Hungary. But the two explosions would not have hap- pened if both in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East the situation had not become explosive. These two explosions marked the disintegration of the postwar world.... There will remain the fundamental stalemate between the Soviet Union and the United States, the stalemate which was recognized by the President and the Soviet leaders at Geneva in 1955. In all probability, neither of the superpowers will decide deliberately to make war against the other. On the other hand, both in Europe and in the Middle East, there are very grave issues which, if they cannot be settled by negotiation, may burst into violence. They may become uncontrollable, and they could involve Russia and America in a war they are both trying to avoid... . The supreme question is whether we can, by a great effort of statesmanship, negotiate a settlement which averts these dangers. I am not saying that we can. But at least one can imagine such a settlement. It will have to be a settlement negotiated by the Western Powers with the Soviet Union and ratified by the two Germanies. It will have to provide for the reunification of the two Germanies. It will have to provide for the gradual but nevertheless definite evacuation of the European Continent up to the Soviet frontier by the Red Army in the east, and by the British and American Armies in the west. Only in this way can Poland, Hungary, and the other satellites be liberated. But that will not be enough. The withdrawal of the armies, the unification of Germany, the liberation of the satellites will be possible, will be conceivable--only if we can con- struct by negotiation an all-European security system which is underwritten by the Soviet Union and the United States. It will have to be a sytsem which guarantees the European nations among themselves, and particularly against a revived and reunited Germany. It will have to be a system which guarantees all of Europe against Russia, and it will have to be one which guarantees Russia against Europe. Within such a European system there ought to develop an all-European economy, and beyond that--on the far horizons of hope- the prospect of a European political confederation. In my view the issue of war and peace will be decided primarily in Europe, and, so to speak, along the line of Iron Curtain. The greatest question in the world is whether Europe can cease to be divided and can become united by negotiation and peaceable means. I would go so far as to say that if we could engage the Russians in a serious negotiation which looked to a general European settlement, the problem of the Middle East would become-I won't say soluble-but manageable. I say this because Russia is not vitally interested in the Middle East. She does not need the oil, and she cannot be invaded from the Middle East. Russia is, however, vitally interested in Europe, particularly in Germany and in Poland, and it is there in Europe that we must make a settlement or live in continual danger of a gigantic war. When I look into the future I think of this country as having two great missions to perform. The one is to bring about the European settlement I have just been describing. On this, as I have just said, depends the issue of peace or war. From such a settlement would come a new Europe, a Europe which had lost its empires overseas but had found a new strength, security, and prosperity in its own unity. Our other mission is, I firmly believe, to work out a new rela- tionship between the Western nations and the newly emanci- pated peoples of Africa and Asia. The imperial and colonial age is over. The age which is to follow is only in its dim beginnings, and it is our mission to play a leading part in working out the terms on which the peoples of the East and the peoples of the West can live side by side in confidence, in security, and in mutual respect- \"An historic incident occurs this week.

His name arouses in the hearts of our movement sympathy and enthusiasm. These sentiments are due not to his aggressiveness and greed for power but to the fact that he beat down. our traditional enemies, Britain and France. The whole Arab world was pleased at the time when France was routed by the Nazis; it was regarded as retribu- tion for the imperialist crimes which the French still keep committing. \"If this is the way we feel about Hitler, the Nazi who is no blood relation of ours, how much more must we support a Leader who has risen from among the Arabs themselves and is inflicting defeat after defeat on the Western Powers, our eternal enemies? Blessed be the Arab people who succeeded in producing, from its own midst, a 'Hitler' who has shown that the Arab nation is entitled to an honourable place in the family of nations and that its sovereignty and freedom must be recognised. The British and French journalists are mistaken if they think they can hurt our feelings by calling Nasser 'Hitler of the Arab world.' On the contrary, that title fills our heart with pride.

However, it is a fact that German influences have also been operating in this area with considerable effectiveness. Pan-Germans and former Nazis have gained important positions in a number of Middle Eastern states, particularly Egypt. Prevent World 117ar III has published detailed accounts of this development in the Nos. 41 and 47 issues. Additional information on the role of former Nazis in the Nasser Gov- ernment is contained in an exclusive report published by the National Jewish Monthly (February 1957). These dis- closures deserve to be pondered by all liberty-loving Americans and it is with this in mind that ire have reprinted the report. The violent actions taken by Nasser's government against British, French and stateless Jews resident in Egypt, the con- fiscation of their property, and their de- portation on from 9 to 72 hours' notice, have provided the press with a flood of news which overshadowed the ominous fate that looms over the naive Egyptian Jewish community of more than 10,000 individuals. This ancient Jewish community is be- ing systematically pauperized, maltreated, and interned together with common criminals in unspeakable places of de- tention. Together with the remainder of Egyptian Jews, they are left at the mercy of the State Security Cadre (SSC), which seems to be as precise a copy of the German Nazi Sichcrheitsdienst as Egyptian inexactitude permits. This unit is the military junta's forceful arm which is responsible for Egypt's actions and policies to a far greater extent than is generally known. The Commander-in-Chief of the SSC is Lt. Col. Al Nacher, formerly SS-Gros- saktionsleiter Leopold Gleim, who was the Commander-in-Chief of the Nazi government's SD-Geheimgarde. Addressing a luncheon in Cairo given in his honor by the representatives of the League for (East) German-Arab Broth- erhood (Al-akhwah al-Almaniyah I'Ara- biyah, i.e., Deutsch-Arabischer Bruder- schaftsverband) on December 17, 1956 ---Gleim frankly pointed out the sig- nificance of the SSC as the \"backbone of Egypt's protective apparatus against the aggressive elements of Zionism and Imperialism.\" He thanked the League for its \"vast help extended to this young State-a most significant contribution to the mutual efforts in the strengthening and stabilizing of Germano-Arabic friendship and relations.\" Later on, during more intimate talks with members of the Bruderschaft-- conducted in Hochdeutsch and made ge- mutlich by cigars, Bourbon, and coffee--- Gleim gave an outline of his unit's short history and structure. This outline, when pieced together with additional facts on hand and the already known pro- cedures of the Cadre's activities, sketches a tolerably clear picture of the Egyptian version of Nazism, which found in Egypt ideal conditions for its recrudescence. The plan for the SSC was drawn up by \"several technical advisers of German origin,\" approved by the Ministry of In- terior. The Cadre headquarters were set up in Cairo, and its administration handed over to the 6,249 \"arabized\" Nazis presently in Egypt (aided by per- haps 70,000 Egyptians). According to Gleim, the unit consists of the following depar(ments: A : The Public Relations Department. (PR-Dpt.) The executive positions in this section are entirely manned by Germans who are holding Arab passports. The PR-Dpt. is headed by SS-Gruppenleiter Moser, a Sudeten German who has now assumed the name of Hussa Nalisman. His right- hand man is SA-Gruppenleiter Bubic. now arabized into Amman. The propaganda machine operates with German precision, according to the Goebbels-Stuermer pattern. Its main tar- get for attacks is, of course, the Jews. Egyptian youth has been responding en- thusiastically to this propaganda. The PR-Dpt. has branches in Berlin (East and West), Vienna, Stockholm, Helsinki. Rome, Milan and Bordeaux; it commands special squads of vans with loudspeakers, which cruise throughout Egypt constantly inciting again-t Ameri- can, British. French, Imperialistic or Zionist Jews---the adjective changing with the broadcaster's mood; and it also owns an independent broadcasting sta- tion which assiduously cultivates the en- tire Arab world. A flood of anti-Semitic literature is being published and distributed in the Middle East and Europe. Egypt's recent bestseller, however, was the new, popular edition of \"Kefahi,\" the Arabic transla- tion of Hitler's \"Mein Kampf.\" This is an abridged, illustrated version which contains photo-reproductions beginning with Hitler's picture as a corporal in Hindenburg's army and up to his cock- posing as the Fuehrer. The complete and unabridged version of \"Mein Kampf\" was first translated into Arabic in 1951 by the Syrian jour- nalist, author, and owner of the Beirut Printing & Publishing House, Louis al- Haj, formerly Luis Heiden, director of Die Reichsdeutsche Presseagentur, Berlin. Vulgar, colorful posters featuring the Israeli soldier as a bearded villain who bayonets an Egyptian baby, arc blooming in many Egyptian towns. These posters urge the people of Egypt to rise in Jihad -the Holy War-against \"the Zionist threat to Islam.\" Egyptian youth is being assiduously educated for militarism. One of the out- standing examples of this campaign is the target-tent pitched opposite the SSC- HQ in Cairo's Liberty Square, where schoolboys are given an interest in usage of arms. The PR-Dpt, also has a very special branch: the Youth Club of the Deutsch- Arahischer Bruderschaftsverband. Twice weekly this Club has a closed session, when many Egyptian youngsters are sworn in by the Club's chairman, Hussa Nalisman. This requires only one more comment: Colonel Abdul Nasser is the Honorary President of the Club, and had been sworn in as member No. 3.

The EC-Dpt., now so strongly associ- ated with Jewish affairs., is a close enough translation of the SS-Wirtschaftsamt, and it operates on a similar basis. This De- partment was founded on February 2, 1954; it controls the SSC treasury, which is independent of the Government's Ex- chequer. Apart from the annual allow- ance granted to the SSC from the Gen- eral Defense Budget, this treasury ab- sorbs a considerable income from prod- ucts of prison workshops throughout Egypt. The archives of the EC-Dpt. have a \"Jewish Section\" with a register of all Jewish property in Egypt. It contains Colonel Hatern, of the EC-Dpt., de- clared that \"not a single piaster or brick has been confiscated, as the Zionist lies alleged. We have documentary proof that property and currency abandoned by peo- ple who had to leave Egypt were volun- tarily assigned to the administration of the EC-Dpt.\" Another interesting branch of the EC- Dpt. is the Public Sales Center in Cairo. Whatever remained in the residences which the Jewish deportees \"voluntarily\" assigned to the administration of the EC-Dpt.-furniture, clothes, paintings, refrigerators, radios, entire libraries, etc. -is being auctioned off.

It is worthwhile noting that the majority of deported Jews had been very rich; this explains why there was no mass deportation of all foreign and stateless Jews, and why individual ex- pulsion warrants were issued. The poorer stateless Jews have been left over, \"to be dealt with later on\"-as Colonel Abd-al- Qadir Hatem explained. Ge-Sta-Po. Its duties are now carried out by Army intelligence.

Ben Salem is a- very modest man, and while entertaining some of the young East-German visitors he declared \"I never wear a uniform be- cause it makes one look more important than he really is.\" This is a moot matter, because in addition to all his known and unknown tasks, humble Ben Salem is also Chief of the Interrogation Center of the SSC, better known to the Egyp- tions and to the Egyptian Jews in par- ticular as \"The Floating Hell.\" The Floating Hell is an old, 12,000- ton cargo vessel, the former Italian \"Ma- rinajo Rosso,\" which has been converted into a floating prison of 80 cells where, according to Ben Salem, \"only cases of special interest\" are being held. The sole \"practical device for bringing out the truth\" which he was prepared to exhibit, was the recording center in the vessel's former radio cabin, from which a net- work of hidden microphones reaches all the cells. Thus, every word uttered dur- ing the interrogations or at intervals, while prisoners are together, is recorded. The recording center is operated by two men only: tight-lipped Sergei Klin- ikin from Odessa; and his subordinate, Alexei Morganoff, a true Moscovite with an enchanting smile, huge feet, and a Swiss watch.

The Floating Hell was also where Lt. Col. Ben Salem had been \"most de- lighted to be able personally to handle the affairs of an Egyptian publisher, a Jew named Mr. Salama.\" (Late news dispatches indicated That their confiscated businesses have been re- stored to a small number of Jews in Egypt-Editor.) Early in November the first phase of Salem's \"Solution of the Jewish-Zionist Problem\" began to take shape: Conducting 3,000 men of the SSC Executive Force (municipal police units, plainclothes men, and army squads), SS- Grossaktionsleiter Gleim personally su- pervised the combing of the Cairo and Alexandria rural districts, throughout the duration of the curfew. This action resulted in the seizure of 1,711 native Jews-men, women and children-inclu- sive of the six Jewish fellahin families of Mit Ghammar, who are the last survivors of a Jewish community believed to have lived there since 90 B.C.E. During this action, looting, rapine, and eight killings were reported and confirmed. The officers in charge \"\"re- gretted the incident which resulted due to the refusal of the subjects to follow instructions.\" These captives have been classified as \"Prisoners Category Alif (A)\" and con- centrated in the southern wing of the famous French-built prison, Des Bar- rages, in Cairo. No charges were made against them, but on the way to prison, all captives (exclusive of pregnant women and mothers of children below the age of 10) were handcuffed. The northern wing of Des Barrages is packed with \"potential deportees\" i.e., Jews who have no Egyptian nationality. The sanitary conditions in which those prisoners are being held should be of speical interest to those members of the UN and of the International Red Cross who, during interviews with foreign cor- respondents in Cairo, denied any knowl- edge of such conditions or of the above- mentioned arrests. Cells intended for 10 persons pres- ently shelter 30; and Cell No. 73 is packed with 38 male Jewish prisoners \"because they have their own water- Closet,\" as explained by the Chief War- den, Hadji Mustaffa Ibn-Aziz, who is very friendly but responsive to bakshish only so far as \"matters of non-political nature are concerned, because now-a-days politics are dangerous.\" The male prisoners arc not allowed out of their cells. Their sole opportunity to breathe some fresh air is while they carry out the waterbuckets-a task ea- gerly done every morning in rotation by a couple of prisoners--and while fetch- ing food and water. The daily rations consist of 500 grams of Pittah-bread and two litres of soup per head. Water (two litres per head) is being distributed only once daily, in the morning, and the male prisoners must drink it all at once, because they are not permitted to keep any containers in their cells, Women Are Treated Better The female prisoners are granted 20 minutes a day to walk in the prison courtyard, and mothers may, in addition to that, spend half an hour daily with their children, who have been accom- modated very comfortably in the former recreation hall for prison personnel. Mothers with babies up to the age of three are kept in the prison dispensary and have beds to sleep on. The babies are being provided with adequate and appropriate food and with daily rations of fresh milk. The 18,000 Alexandria Jews (among them some 6,000 natives) classified as \"Category Ba (B)\" suffered an attack which completely crushed their economic life. Alexandria's Military Governor, Col. Ilusseini, imposed under Security Act penalties, a permanent curfew which lasts from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m., and from 1 t a.m. to 3 p.m. The rest of the time is left for purchase of food which is usually bought with funds obtained through the sale of jewelry or other per- sonal assets, because by order of the SSC. EC-Dpt., 93 percent of every Jew- ish bank account has been blocked \"until the position of Category Ba is clarified.\" Colonel Hatem elucidated this hazy statement as follows: \"The Alexandria Jews are known to have strong connec- tions with Israel; but since we cannot bring them to justice without concrete proof and simultaneously cannot let them endanger the State Security by letting them carry on with their underground activities, we are forced to take some slight precautions. These are the \"slight\" precautions: All Arab enterprises have dismissed their Jewish employees without any com- pensation whatsoever-as per govern- ment orders, Most Jewish enterprises, including the Cicurel Stores and down to small shops, were taken over and only those few Jews who have inter-married were permitted to continue, but they closed their shops \"\"voluntarily\" because they were picketed by the Moslem Brotherhood and their show-windows were stoned. Any custom- ers who attempted to enter Jewish shops were assaulted. All Jewish professionals in Alexandria (with the exception of a few dentists) have been forbidden to practice. 710 prominent Jewish personalities, including a relative of Mrs. Mendes-France, Mr. Guy Cicurel, former President of the Maccabi, and Mr. E.

While an outraged world focussed at- tention on the Russian tanks crushing the Hungarian revolt, a group of Ger- man industrialists were enjoying the sights in Moscow. Of course, the West German Government had deplored tl:c Soviet action. It is also noteworthy that Chancellor Adenauer's Government \"was profoundly disturbed\" over U. S. \"hesi- tation\" during the crisis (New York Times, 11-2-56). According to the New York Times, a senior official in the Bonn Government (unidentified) declared that the prestige of the U. S. \"hangs in bal- ance,\" He warned that if Washington pursued a do nothing policy in Hungary and permitted the Stalinist tyranny to triumph, the moral capital of the U. S. in Germany \"will be worth nothing.\" Bonn's \"holy anger\" and the visit of the industrialists to Moscow may best be understood not as a contradiction but rather as a division of labor. Berthold Beitz, Krupp's General Manager, put it succinctly: \"1 ant a businessman, so what do I care about politics? Let Adenauer see to politics, and let him leave me do my job. All embargo lists (on trade will; the Soviet bloc) should be abolished immediately,\" The Eastern Contact The \"tourists\" in Moscow repreccnt- ing some of the largest industrial aggre- gates including Krupp, Mannesmann, Siemens, AEG, Demag and Gutchofl- nungshUtte, were warmly received by the Soviet Minister for Heavy Industry. Their travels were quite extensive rang- ing from a visit to Moscow's industrial and agricultural exhibition to the fato- ries and industries of the Ukraine and the Urals. Judging from subsequent de- velopments, it appears that their sojourn in Soviet Russia has created promising opportunities for both, the Germans and the Russians. This is not to say that the visit of the German industrialists repre- sented a radical shift in Soviet-German relations. It would be more accurate to say that the visit added a powerful stim- ulus to contacts which have steadily im- proved over a number of years. In August 1952 leading spokesmen for the Ruhr conferred secretly with associates of Soviet Deputy Prime Min- ister Mikoyan in Copenhagen, The meet- ing was called at West German initiative with the prior knowledge of the Bonn Government. It took place only 3 months after the Allies had drawn up the Con- tractual Agreement which gave West Germany a free hand in her foreign relations. The meeting retrained a closely guarded secret until former Foreign Min- ister Molotov let the cat out of the bau during a Big Four meeting in Berlin in 1954. Commenting on this sensational disclosure the Christian Science Monitor (-1-17-54) noted that talks between Moc- cow and West German industrialists had \"been going on for about 3 years.\" One year after the secret get-together in Copenhagen, Chancellor Adcnauer made a public statement on Sovic-Ccr- man relations which would be inter- preted as a followup of that sleeting. As reported in the Frankfurter Allge- meinc Zcitung (7-7-53) the Chancellor urged the strengthening of economic ties bctwe_n West Germany and tl:e Sovies and expressed confidence that this would facilita'e clo-er political undcrsranding. \"Already today the states of the Euro- pean Schuman plan have formed a mar- ket of 157 million people. Thus from the point of view of the Riirsian econ- omy these countries represent a highly interesting trade partner. Years ago there refits a tine when the economy of Ger- many and Russia complemented one art- other in a magnificent way. The economy of an integrated Europe, including Ger- many, could do vastly more. The greater the economic integration (between li7est- ern Europe and Russia), the grea.'er the political security.\" Since then other German political leaders have repeated the Adenauer thesis. As recently as February 10, 1956, Foreign Mini-ter von Brentano to!d tl-e U. S. News & World Report: \"ll''ithou! doubt the economies of both countries (Rarsia and Germany) could supnle- ment each other in a most tt.ceJul trlarr- ner. Playing the Right Cards - At the Right Tinter (;cite understandably the delicate ni- ture of Soviet-German relations has taxed the ingenuity and frne:se of German of- ficialdom. Bonn is incli^cd to discourage publicity about this side of its diplomacy since it could p!ace the Chancellor, \"God's gift to the West,\" in an em- barrassing light. Conte ,uently, the gen- eral line passed down to those who write about this touchy subject, may be summed up in these words: \"The less said, the better.\" It was with this dictum in mind that Adcnauer and his associates tried to deflate the importance of his trip to Moscow in 1955. At a press conference in July of that year, Herr von Brentano assured report- ers that Adenauer would remain stead- fastly loyal to the West regardless of the impending talks with the Kremlin. Indeed, he declared, the Chancellor would not even think of going to Mos- cow if he felt there was no hope of altering the Russian stand on German unification, Though Adenauer has shown a marked talent for talking one way to Moscow and another to Washington, this fact does not seem to have registered among our top policy makers. Prior to his trip to Moscow he conferred at length in Washington and told our experts that he would not agree to the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Kremlin. Ile said he was going to talk tough and would, insist that there could be no ex- change of ambassadors until substantial progress had been made on the problem of German unity. It was only after his policy of toughness was transformed into a posture of meekness that U. S. policy makers showed the first signs of shock. It has always been surprising to us that Washington should have been taken aback by the results of the Bulganin- Adcnauer get-together. After all, as early as May 7, 1954, the Chancellor specifi- cally stated to his own people that diplo- matic relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union \"might be estab- lished in the not too far future.\" He said by way of explanation. \"Our trade with the Soviets has been intensified lately.\" Thus, Adenauer consistent with his previous statement in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, had given clear in- dication of what he was up to. However, Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 Washington in 1955 preferred to believe in the stories which Adenauer had handed out for American consumption. Washington's chagrin over the diplo- matic rapproachment between the Krem- lin and Bonn was heightened still further when the U. S. Ambassador to Moscow Charles E. Bohlen reported that nego- tiations between Adenauer and Bulganin had been decisively in Moscow's favor. According to Drew Pearson (10-1-55) Bohlen reported to the State Department that Adenauer \"had been virtually putty in Russian hands, and warned that the U. S. could not trust the West Germans to stand up against the Kremlin in the future.\" As if to anticipate criticisms of his dealing with Moscow, Chancellor Adenauer told the press just before de- parting from Russia, \"I swear that I made no secret. agreement with the Rus- sions.\" Fact and Fiction In the maze of diplomatic maneuver- ing and intrigue, it is not easy to sepa- rate fact from fiction. The passage of time, however, does help to clear the air. Thus, in October, 1956, the Russians sent a long note to the West German Government on the problem of unifica- tion. The Kremlin complained that Bonn was not \"endeavoring to solve on the basis of mutual understanding questions that have not been settled and which interest both sides and obviously con- tradicts the agreements made between our governments during the Moscow ne- gotiations in the year 1955.\" While the note did not reveal all of the specific agreements which were supposed to have been reached between the two govern- ments, it made reference to \"firm agree- ment on the question of the development of trade ...\" It is significant, we think, that Adenauer has never denied that he reached such an understanding with the Russians. On the contrary, the informa- tion which has been published relative to this issue, points to the fact that the Germans no less than their Russian counterparts are very much interested in an agreement. Shortly after the Russians had sent their note of complaint to Bonn, the new Soviet Ambassador to West Germany, Andrei A. Smirnov, received a cordial welcome from leading German officials. The New York. Times (10-26-56) re- ported: \"The West German Government is eager to make use of Mr. Smirnov's presence here ... The official policy now is to 'activate' Soviet-West German rela- tions in the hope that bit by bit the basis for serious negotiations on German re- unification can be established.\" The Times referred to the first round discus- sions between the Soviet Ambassador \". . . It will be recalled that the French govern- ment was able to obtain the approval of the National Assembly for the Paris Agreements only on the strict understanding that the new German army would never be equipped with atomic weapons. \"But it is now affirmed that the weapons for- bidden to Germany are to be fabricated in Spain. \"According to recent reports, Franco has offered all facilities for their manufacture, and the United States is prepared to finance some extra ones for experimentation in atomic weapons-more for the benefit of Germany than of Spain. \"If this information is correct it would be a repetition of what happened during the twenties. The Versailles treaty explicitly limited the num- ber and kind of military equipment permitted the small new German army authorized by the victorious Allies....\" (J. Alvarez Del Vayo, Gazette & Daily, 1-30-57) and the Bonn Foreign Office which would include \"an improvement of trade relations\" and \"a cultural and scientific exchange.\" \"Love Notes\" and the Fair As the new year was ushered in, the eagerness of the Bonn Government to talk about trade with the Soviets grew considerably. The Frankfurter Rundschau (1-5-57) reported that the West German Government \"no longer takes a negative attitude to the conclusion of a trade agreement between the Federal Republic and Soviet Russia.\" A spokesman for the Government, according to the newspaper, declared that Chancellor Adenauer \"after his talks with Soviet Ambassador Smir- now shortly before Christmas seemed fully agreeable to take this subject under consideration.\" The Associated Press of the same date reported that this devel- opment resulted partially from the pres- sure of West German industrialists who hope to profit from it. Several days after these reports appeared in the press, the Chancellor spoke at a news conference. The Times described him as \"relaxed and in good humor\" and \"maintained his new 'flexible' posture while making it clear that he was not rushing out to curry Soviet favor.\" He emphasized that he wanted to expand trade with the Soviets. In a message to the Soviet Govern- THE DIRECT WIRE Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 ment (March 1957) which referred to Bulganin's original complaint, the Chan- cellor agreed to discuss ways and means of expanding trade relations which would \"improve the political atmos- phere.\" Moscow seemed pleased to learn that the Chancellor felt this way and promptly notified Bonn that the Soviets were ready to conduct negotiations \"in the very near future.\" The deal was sealed when the West German Govern- ment informed Moscow that it was pre- pared to negotiate trade and consular agreements (New York Times, 4-18-57). The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung viewed the exchange of these notes as \"a sure sign that the Federal Govern- ment plans concrete negotiations between the two countries in which diplomatic relations are not merely empty formal- ities.\" Following on the heels of this diplo- matic exchange, the Germans opened their Hannover Fair. Judging from de- scriptions in the press, one is almost tempted to believe that a most important consideration governing the organization of this fair was to impress the Russians with the great possibilities of trade be- tween the two countries. The London Financial Times (4-22-57) said that re- ports had been circulating that \"massive Soviet trade bids may be made\" at the fair where four Soviet trade delegations totaling 50 high ranking officials, were expected. A New York Times reporter observed that the Russian technical and trade experts were coming in sufficient strength \"to inventory the fair and draw up 1 ists of manufacturers producing goods needed by the Soviet Union\" (4-27-57). Commenting on this devel- opment the Times correspondent stated that when the German trade negotiations arrive in Moscow, the Soviets will have conveniently prepared for them the lists of specific goods which they desire. On the following day (4-28-57) the Times correspondent reported that the Soviet Ambassador and his colleagues from Moscow \"made a bee-line for The Krupp pavilion on their arrival at the fair.\" He also mentioned that such great con- cerns as Demag, Kloeckner and Rhein- stahl received \"the personal attention of the Soviet officials.\" The fair made a hit with the Russians. The Soviet Ambassador sent a telegram to the exhibition stating that it had aroused great interest in Russia. He ex- pressed the hope that through this event Soviet officials would \"be able to make valuable contacts with German business- men and thus strengthen economic and scientific relations\" (Frankfurter Allge- meinc 7eitung, 4-27-57). Wilfried Braun, Chairman of the Board of Hartmann & Braun A. G., Frankfurt, told the Frankfurter Allge- meine that the embargo on Russia was no longer \"disturbing\" his exports to that country. He informed the press that within a few weeks he would fly to Russia with a private delegation of Ger- man industrialists, He saw great possi- bilities in exports to the eastern bloc and said that payment arrangements were always prompt and never produced any difficulties. The \"Fire Buries Bright\" Obviously the profit lure has kindled a fire among the Ruhr industrialists. Un- der these circumstances the task of diplo- macy became more difficult. In simple terms, the problem is to contain this enthusiasm so as to avoid giving alarm to Washington which has placed so much trust in \"tier Alte.\" Thus, we find reports in the press (which seem to be inspired) indicating that the Germans are \"re- luctant\" to deal with the Russians and are \"worried\" lest the Soviets demand too much, The New York Times (4-21- 57) describes how West German officials are allegedly concerned over the Soviet Government's propaganda for large scale trade relations. We are told that Bonn is determined to place a limit on com- mercial transactions with the Russians. We have also been given to understand that Adenauer will not enter into \"a formal trade agreement with Russia\" but will only consent to \"an informal trade agreement . - .\" (New York World Telegram, 4-27-57). Can one think of a better example of hairsplitting? It is hard to believe that the mores of the German cartellists are so unique that they will go out of their way to avoid making as much profit as they can from trade with the Eastern bloc. Fact is that German trade with the Soviets and the satellites has risen spectacularly. West Germany's trade with the East was 710 million DM in 1950. In 1955 it reached the figure of 1,351 million DM and for the first 10 months of 1956 1,786 mil- lion DM. In 1956 trade with the Soviet Union alone was 25076 of what it had been in the previous year. These statistics tell the trend. In some respect trade with the Russians is even more significant than the overall statistics indicate. Ac- cording to an article published in the Soviet publication New Times \"West Germany's Stake in Soviet Trade\" (March 1957) it is stated that in 1956 \"the USSR stood first in Western Ger- many's imports of pig iron (23 per cent), second in her imports of rye (26 per cent) and third in her imports of as- bestos (17 per cent). It was the second biggest buyer of West-German shipping (18 per cent) and copper wire, and third to fifth biggest buyer of certain types of rolled steel.\" Studies conducted by West German Government experts show that exports to the Soviets could reach as high as $1 billion annually. These export plans will unquestionably be borne in mind by Bonn diplomats in future negotiations. \"The fact that German experts drew up these plans would appear to contradict the internal propaganda line that trade with the Soviet Union does not have a future\" (New York Times, 9-18-55). The Times report could have added that these statistics and studies also belie the propaganda which the Germans have been passing out to the West. Bonn has not only pretended that fu- ture trade with the Soviets will be of little value but its top leaders are al- ways careful to assure the West that commercial dealing with the Russians will not assume diplomatic significance. On the other hand, the German people are told a different story. The German newspaper Die Welt (4-15-57) carried a special editorial under the title \"Trade with Russia.\" It noted that a future trade agreement with Moscow would not only step up contacts between the two coun- tries in the economic sphere but in the political as well. \"There is,\" the edi- torial observed, \"the desire to again take up old contacts and connections with which we have had such favorable expe- riences between the two wars, Politically the creation of trade relations with Rus- sia can become a trump card for us, A genuine trade agreement would really be the biggest trump of all ...\" Because of the importance of future negotiations which would involve vital political con- siderations, the editorial believes that Bonn should entrust these negotiations \"only to the best man who is in a pasi- tion to maintain relations to the Commit- tee for Eastern Matters of German in- dustrialists.\" - The above editorial was in sharp con- Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 tract to previous positions taken by the Bonn Government. On May 2, 1956, a spokesman for Chancellor Adenauer told the press that the Bonn Government would not negotiate a trade agreement with the Soviet Union until the Soviet Government was ready to consent to the reunification of Germany in \"peace and freedom.\" A few weeks later von Bren- tano repeated this point at a press con- ference and dismissed a trade agreement with the Russians as \"by no means ur- gent.\" As recently as January 11, 1957, Adenauer declared that his government would not negotiate a commercial treaty with Moscow. But this promise may be evaluated in the same light as Adenauer's previous pledge not to establish diplo- matic relations with Moscow. Fact is that such negotiations are now under way. Ironically, agreement to negotiate came shortly after Adenauer had succeeded in obtaining a veto power over vital aspects of US policy (see p. 4). As previously noted, Germany went into secret con- ference with the Russians in Copenhagen after winning the Contractual Agree- ment. They seem to be repeating ! The Larger Goal There is no question but that leading circles in West Germany look upon the trade negotiations as a stepping stone toward resolving political issues between Bonn and Moscow. Chancellor Adenauer has stressed this tie-up and the Soviets, too, share the same views. Thus, along- side the preparatory steps for the con- clusion of a trade agreement we find Soviet and German sentiment speculating on the wider ramifications. In the Jan- uary 1957 issue of the Russian publica- tion \"International Affairs,\" several il- luminating documents on former Soviet- German economic relations are repro- duced allegedly taken from German archives. On February 17, 1920, the top executives of the Allgemeine Elektrizi- taets Gesellschaft, Felix Deutsch and Walter Rathenau, wrote a lengthy memo- randum dealing with the problem of establishing economic and political ties with the Bolshevik Regime. The German industrialists urged that Germany \"with all haste\" should establish contacts with the new Russian regime and declared that Germany's future relations with the East \"will evidently be brightest if Ger- man foreign policy succeeds as soon as possible in establishing relations between Germany and the Eastern states which would make the latter refrain from agree- ing to desires of the Entente for a re- striction of relations between Germany and Russia.\" They expressed alarm lest the Entente took the initiative before the Germans. They further warned, that the closer the understanding between the Entente and the Soviets \"the greater the danger that Germany will miss the mo- ment for laying the foundations of a suc- cessful Germany policy in Eastern Eu- rope.\" Elaborating on their views the memorandum said, \"The decisive point is that Germany will be either- a colony .of the Entente countries, the object of exploitation by them, and if necessary a purveyor of hired troops who will have to fight for the glory of the Entente any- where in the world where, the criminal working of the Versailles Conference kindles a war, or she will succeed in ex- ploiting the political possibilities which offer themselves in the East of Europe and winning a modicum of independence and freedom which will guard her against the worst privations and oppres- sion. Besides the fact that Central and Eastern Europe are neighbours and eco- nomcially complete each -other, they also have common needs, and Russia and Germany have the common fate of de- feated nations. Cleverly and carefully to make use of the points of contact given here, and by developing them to construct a dependable framework for German foreign policy is a need the importance of which has probably never been felt so strongly as today, when the demands of the Entente for extradition (of crim- inals-Ed.) are aimed at tainting the name of Germany with indelible dis- grace for centuries.\" Toward the conclu- sion of this memorandum the industrial- ists declared: \"But the revival of German influence in Russia gives Germany at the same time the possibility of being an in- termediary between Russia and other countries, particularly the Ignited States of America. These countries call for German mediation because psychologial- ly the British and Americans do not un- derstand the Russians as well as the Ger- mans who have at least had the rich ex- perience of the pre-war period.\" The Russian publication also reproduced let- ters from Stresemann and from Krupp, stressing the importance of the Eastern contact. It does not take a bright mind to figure out why the Russians should have reproduced these documents at this time. Bulganin's note to the Germans of February 5, 1957 seems to fit in exactly with the Russian propaganda offensive designed to reawaken the \"good old times.\" Bulganin did not equivocate and the letter is particularly warm and friendly. Here are some choice excerpts: \"Whether there will be peace or war in Europe depends above all on the fu- ture relations between our- peoples. That is why both our Governments must be aware of their responsibility for the des- Deutsche Volkszeitung Approved For Release 2006/11/21 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 Approved For Release 2006/11/21: CIA-RDP88-01315R000400480017-1 tinies of the peoples of their countries and for the destinies of peace in Eu- rope ... \"After thoroughly analyzing the pres- ent situation my colleagues and I have come to the conclusion that the vital in- terests of the Soviet and the German peoples call for a decisive turn in the relations between the USSR and the Federal Republic of Germany .. . \"Only such a turn in the relations be- tween our countries can guarantee that the two great peoples-the Soviet and the German-will never again be forced to squander their forces and wealth, bleeding each other white ... \"It is not difficult to understand that those who want to push the Federal Re- public of Germany onto the road of rear least of all care for its future, or the interests of the German people.

The Federal Republic has a highly developed industry and can count on big and ad- vantageous orders from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union in its turn also has broad possibilities for selling goods to the Federal Republic of Germany needed by its industry and agriculture. \"Ire raise the question of expanding trade with the Federal Republic also because the Soviet Union regards the de- velopment of such contacts as a firm foundation for improving the political relations between states.\" Business Week (2-16-57) reported that the Bulganin message to Adenauer looked \"like the first gambit in a differ- ent Soviet approach to the German ques- lion . . . Bulganin Wrote as though he thought a Soviet-German agreement would settle all the problems of Europe.\" Mutual Admiration Society Soviet propaganda latched on to the note with a steady drumbeat on the enormous good that would come from close ties between Moscow and Bonn. One Russian commentator reported an important conference to be held in Dus- seldorf by West German business circles. According to him, the meeting evoked great enthusiasm and was filled to capac- ity--200 people were refused entrance. The same commentator quoted German newspapers and businessmen to the effect that good relations with the Russians was a \"must\" He referred to an article published by the Rheinischc Post, an or- gan closely associated with Adenauer's party, which said that a trade treaty with the Soviet Union would be of mutual benefit. Another publication associated with German industry, West Post, de- clared that a trade treaty with Russia \"would help to improve the political climate in the relations between the two countries ...\" It also noted that one of Germany's top financiers, Robert Pferd- menges, perhaps Adenauer's closest ad- visor, had also spoken favorably for the conclusion of an agreement with the Russians. As the political flirtation grew charmer, Soviet propagandists began to recall the halcyon days of the 1920s and 1930s when close economic and political co- operation existed between Germany and the Soviets. Thus, a special article re- cently appeared in the government news- paper Izvestia entitled \"The Spirit of Rapallo and Our Times.\" The writer of the article, N. Polyanov, spoke about \"the lessons of Rapallo\" which marked what he called \"sincere friendly coopera- tion\" between the two countries. Surely, he Said, this spirit must still be alive. \"Is it not time to achieve a decisive change in relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the USSR, a change towards confidence and friend- ship? The possibilities in this direction have by no means been exhausted.\" The love note excited Adcnauer too, and he publicly declared that it was of decisive significance. At the same time, he told reporters that he would not dis- cuss its contents because the time was premature. The Russians, always with an eye towards exploiting the propaganda value of their diplomatic moves, were uninhibited and publicized the contents of the note all over the world. Bonn was extremely annoyed by this publicity. One German newspaper, the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, published a cartoon of \"Auntie Adenauer\" watching Mar- shal Bulganin announcing in a television screen the text of his latest note; Aden- auer is incensed and says, \"But I thought that was our special secret.\" Poor Aden- auer did not take into account the Rus- sian temperament which can be embar- rassingly frank. The well-known German commentator Reinhard Gerdes, speaking over the radio on February 8, 1957, found great poten- tialities in Bulganin's note: \"They (the Russians) may with to obtain a disarm- ament agreement through the mediation of the Federal Government. The Chan- cellor should see to it that despite all caution the Soviet request will not be turned down.\" The idea of Germany holding the last word on East-West re- lations is certainly an attractive one for German diplomacy, especially if Aden- auer is able to prove to the Russians that they can obtain advantageous terms through his good offices. On February to, Herr Gerdes returned to this theme mentioning that Adenauer's statement on the possibility of halting the test of H bombs \"was also designed to increase Soviet readiness for talks with Bonn ...\" As though he was talking to the Soviets, Gerdes once again empha- sized Adenauer's \"position of trust in the Western world\" and the role that he could play as mediator between the United States and Russia. Another Ger- man radio commentator, Otto Herr, also waxed enthusiastically over Bulganin's note. Here was a great opportunity which the Federal Republic must not neglect. \"Among the Vestern nations,\" he told his listeners, \"the Federal Republic is the biggest supplier of the Soviet Union anyway.,, It has been rightly stated that a well informed public opinion is the surest guaranty for an intelligent and farsighted foreign policy. In our opinion, it is a real tragedy that the American people, as we have stated many times in Prevent World War III, have come to know only one side of the German coin. Respon- sibil"
