        "text": "Giessen\n\nGermany\n\nGiessen, city, Hessen Land (state), west-central Germany. It lies on the Lahn River between the Westerwald and Vogelsberg (mountains), north of Frankfurt am Main. First mentioned in 1197, it was chartered in 1248 and sold to the landgraves of Hesse in 1267. It was part of independent Hesse-Marburg from 1567 until 1604, when it passed to Hesse-Darmstadt. Giessen is a busy centre for shopping, regional administration, culture, and conventions. Industrial products include machine tools, precision instruments, pharmaceuticals, and foodstuffs; electrical engineering is also important. Historic landmarks include the “new castle” (1533–37), the ruins of the old castle (14th century), and the Schiffenberg Monastery. The laboratory of the famous chemist Justus von Liebeg may still be seen at Giessen University (Justus-Liebig-Universität), founded in 1607. The socialist Wilhelm Liebknecht, cofounder of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, was born in Giessen and attended the university. There are also several general and specialized colleges. Local attractions include the Upper Hessian Museum and the botanical gardens (1609). Pop. (2003 est.) 74,001.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Amy Tikkanen."
