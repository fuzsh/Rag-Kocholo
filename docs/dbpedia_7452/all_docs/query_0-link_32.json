        "text": "Herman Collitz (2-4-1855 to 5-13-1935)\n\nHerman Collitz was born in the town of Bleckede, Hanover, Germany. He attended the University of Göttingen and specialized in classical philological branches as Sanskrit and Iranian. He also worked with Slavic and Germanic languages. He was at the University of Berlin in 1878. He came to the U.S. in 1886 accepting a position at Bryn Mawr College. Here he devoted himself to Germanics.\n\nHe studied and produced many original papers that were invaluable to the science and art of linguistics. In comparative linguistics he dealt with such subjects as the phonology and morphology of the Indo-European languages. He was also an authority on Indo-European mythology.\n\nIn 1907 Professor Collitz was called to the Johns Hopkins University to fill the newly created chair in Germanics. At the age of 72, after 41 years of active college and university teaching, Professor Collitz was made Professor Emeritus of German Philology. A portrait of this pioneer in comparative linguistics in America was presented in his honor and placed in Gilman Hall. As Emeritus Professor Collitz continued to write and study and contribute in his field until 1934. Besides being co-editor of numerous philological journals, he had the honor of being the first president of the Linguistic Society of America, and he also served as president of the Modern Language Association of America. To his Ph.D. degree from the University of Göttingen, the University of Chicago added an honorary doctorate in 1916. On his seventy-fifth birthday, February 4, 1930, he was similarly honored by the University of Magdeburg and his wife, Dr. Klara Collitz, had ‘Studies in Honor of Hermann Collitz’ published. His obituary in ‘Modern Language Notes’, states that “he was one of the most distinguished students in linguistics we have had in America”.\n\nDieter Cunz (8-4- 1910 to 2-17- 1969)\n\nEven though he wasn’t born in Baltimore nor did he die in Baltimore, a section on education could not be complete without the biography of a man who spent many years at the University of Maryland. Mr. Cunz was born in a village in the Westerwald and grew up in Schierstein, a suburb of Wiesbaden. He studied History, German Literature and the History of Religion at many universities throughout Germany. He received his Ph.D. in 1934 from the University of Frankfurt. Shortly thereafter, he left Germany and went to Switzerland where he lived for four years. During those four years he authored three books (A monograph on the Swiss reformer Ulrich Zeingli; a collection of ‘Fairy Tales for Adults’; and a Constitutional History of Europe Since the Early 16th Century. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1938, spent a year doing odd jobs in New York and then received a small stipend from the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation to catalogue and organize the library of the Society for the History of Germans in Maryland (at this time, this was the last surviving society in the U.S. dedicated to the study and preservation of the history of German immigration to America. After completion, he began his teaching career at the University of Maryland, where he remained for eighteen years. He revived the Society for the History of Germans in Maryland and published many reports in the field of immigration history. He became one of the most distinguished American writers on immigration history. During his time he wrote what was considered one of his major achievements, ‘The Maryland Germans: A History’, which was written in 1948. His last book, ‘They Came from Germany’ was published in 1966. In 1957, Professor Cunz moved from Maryland and accepted the position of the Chairman of the German Department at the Ohio State University.\n\nHe was acutely interested in methods used to teach German, especially elementary and intermediate German. He authored a college text, ‘German for Beginners’ in 1958 and a revised new edition in 1965.\n\nRev. Fritz Otto Evers (8-25-1886 to 9-4-1963) Pastor Zion\n\nOn January 27, 1929 he was installed as the regular pastor of Zion. He was born in Berlin on August 25, 1886, he was trained at Kropp Seminary near Schleswig for service with the German Lutheran Church in America. The seminary, at that time, prepared young men who expected to follow the ministry in foreign countries. He arrived in New York June 18, 1908 and was ordained in July 1908 at St. John’s in New Jersey, where he served as pastor until 1912. He married Luise Clara Micho. After two years of service as Director of the Lutheran Emigrants House and as Immigrant Chaplain on Ellis Island, he followed a call to the pastorate of Zion in Philadelphia in November 1914. He served there for fifteen years (the congregation was founded in 1742 by Henry Melchior Muhlenberg). During that time, he also was active in relief work for children affected by the war. He visited Germany in 1927 and was received with high honors, being granted a private audience with President von Hindenburg. He was chairman of the division on linguistic interests in the Baord of American Missions of the United Lutheran Church in America, secretary of the committee on German interests and director of the Seamen’s Mission. He was the organizer of the Oratorio Chorus of the Lutheran Church in Philadelphia.\n\nDuring his service to Zion, he was called twice to serve as chaplain in the Maryland Senate and once in the Maryland State House of Delegates. He organized the German language school at Zion and brought it to a high degree of efficiency with at one time eight teachers and 150 students.\n\nOn May 1942, Pastor Evers, on behalf of Zion Church committed the ambulance “The Pioneer” to the hands of the American Red Cross as ‘the gift of Zion Church for the work of mercy and in honor of Dr. Charles Frederick Wiesenthal.\n\nHe was a member of the German Society; served on the Executive Committee of the Society for the History of Germans in Maryland and helped organize the ‘Goethe Celebration’ in January of 1950. He was given the title of ‘Pastor Emeritus’ and in 1961 was awarded the Carl Schurz Medal for his work in American-German cultural relations.\n\nOn September 21, 1952, Pastor Evers informed the congregation during the Sunday service of his desire to retire. He did retire, but also served Zion as an interim pastor between 1961 (Pastor Wagner’s resignation) and 1963 (Pastor Penner’s arrival). He served as Zion of Baltimore’s pastor for twenty four years.\n\nHe is buried at Lorraine Cemetery.\n\nCharles M. Eyster (5-1857 to 7-13-1926)\n\nThe Rev. Charles M. Eyster, was pastor of the First German United Evangelical Church. He lived at his church at 1824 East Baltimore Street. He was very popular throughout the city and state. Two things made him very noteable….he married 7,950 couples and he never took a vacation from his duties in the twenty six years serving as First German United’s pastor. He became their pastor on June 3, 1900. He came to Baltimore in 1900 and is shown on the 1900 census as living with the Wittig family at 410 Annst Street. He was born in Thomasville, York County, Pennsylvania and his parents were both born in Germany. He was educated at the East Berlin Normal School in PA and the Poughkeepsie NY Pennsylvania College and the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. He commented that ‘I have been at the church since 1900 and I never go out of town. The charge has a large congregation and I have performed marriage ceremonies for many of its members. Another thing is that the church as a State Charter which is very far-reaching. That is the reason I have so many out of town couples to marry. The people who go to my church seldom take vacations and they don’t think their preacher or their doctor should take one. They want them when they are called upon.’\n\nHis first charge was as pastor of the Seven Vally Lutheran Church in PA., where he was from July 1884 to July 1885, from then until he came to Baltimore, he held a pastorate in Manchester, Carroll County, Maryland.\n\nHe married Margaret and together they had one daughter.\n\nThe Rev. Charles died at his home as a result of a stroke.\n\nAlbert Faust (4-20-1870 to 2-8-1951)\n\nMr. Faust was born in Baltimore in 1870. His parents His parents were natives of the\n\nlittle town of Schlitz in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. His father, Johann Faust, born in 1828, emigrated to America in 1852 and started a shoe factory in Baltimore. In 1861 he married Katharina E. Kalbfleisch.\n\nAlbert attended \"Scheib's School,\" was confirmed in Zion Church and later enrolled at Johns Hopkins University. Here he was deeply influenced by such eminent Hopkins scholars as Henry Wood and Marion Dexter Learned. After his graduation he traveled for several years in Europe and did graduate work at the University of Berlin. He returned to the U.S. in 1894 and began a teaching career which led him from Hopkins to Connecticut Wesleyan and the University of Wisconsin, to Cornell in Ithaca, New York. He settled here in 1904 and remained the professor of German until his retirement in 1921.\n\nFaust's scholarly endeavors centered around two problems: the impact of German immigration on the rise of American civilization and the intercultural exchange between Germany and the United States. His Ph. D. thesis at Johns Hopkins University, indicated the direction of his lifework: ‘Charles Sealsfield (Karl Postl), Material for a Biography, a Study of his Style, his Influence upon American Literature’. He was the first to penetrate the pseudonym and to rescue Sealsfield's work from oblivion. In 1897 his doctoral dissertation, in a revised and enlarged form, was published in Germany under the title:Charles Sealsfield, der Dichter beider Hemisphären. After the completion of the Sealsfield monograph, Faust's literary interests were increasingly overshadowed by his historical studies. More and more his research turned towards the history of German immigration into the United States, a field which until then had almost exclusively been held by interested laymen and amateurs. Now Professor Faust, with the firm step of the trained historian, approached the difficult and complex task of compiling a comprehensive history of German immigration and\n\nGerman contributions to American civilization. In 1907 he published his magnum opus: The German Element in the United States. The work won immediate recognition through the award of the Seipp Price of $3,000. It was highly praised by one of the judges of the award committee, the famous historian Frederick Jackson Turner. A few years later a German edition was published, Das Deutschtum in den Vereinigten Staaten (1912) which was awarded the Loubat Prize of the Prussian Academy. In 1927 a new and enlarged one-volume edition was sponsored by the Steuben Society of America. To be sure, in the forty years since the first publication of the work German-American studies have moved on, new vistas were opened, and in general scholars have attempted a more discerning and more critical evaluation of the effect of the German influx into the United States. Yet Faust's achievement as the first and fundamental compendium of German-American immigration history stands uncontested. Up to the present time it has remained the indispensable point of departure for all research in German-American studies. The German Element in the United States was the one book of the author which found its way into hundreds and thousands of American libraries, private and public. Other publications were addressed more to specialists, such as the Guide to the Materials for American History in Swiss and Austrian Archives (1916), the List of Swiss Emigrants in the Eighteenth Century to the American Colonies (1920/25) and the annotated edition of John Quincy Adams' Translation of Wieland's Oberon (1940).\n\nIn addition he wrote a great number of essays and articles, among them a brief survey of German- American letters in the Cambridge History of American Literature (Vol. IV, New York, 1921) and a chapter on the German Americans in a cooperative volume Our Racial and National Minorities (ed. by F. Brown and J. Roucek, New York, 1937). Among Faust's literary efforts there is also a historical drama published in 1944, The Bank War, dealing with the conflict between President Andrew Jackson and Nicholas Biddle of the Second Bank of the United States.\n\nWe should not forget to say a few words about Faust's activities as a teacher and editor. In 1928 he was appointed editor of the Foreign Language Division of F. S. Crofts and\n\nCompany, the largest publishing house for foreign language college textbooks, a post he held for almost twenty years. Under his guidance the writings of a good number of German authors such as Heine, Fontane, Hesse, Keyserling, Bonsels, Fallada, Thomas Mann, Paul Ernst and many others were made available to American students of German.\n\nHe also was instrumental in the founding of the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation in Philadelphia, which he welcomed as a promoter of intercultural relations between Germany and America. In 1930 he represented the American universities at the official celebrations which the German Reich arranged to honor the 100th anniversary of Carl Schurz. Three years later Dr. Faust was invited to Vienna as visiting Carnegie Professor. During this year in Austria he lectured on American history, literature and on his special field of German-American studies. He was decorated by the Austrian government with the Golden Cross of Honor. In 1937 he received an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Göttingen. In spite of his wide travels and his international recognition Albert B. Faust always remained conscious of his roots and of the soil from which he had grown: America, Maryland, Baltimore. He remained a member of Zion Church until his death; frequent trips to his home town kept old friendships alive His last visit to Baltimore occurred in February 1946 when he delivered the address at the sixtieth anniversary dinner of the Society for the History of the Germans in Maryland. Albert Bernhardt Faust's most outstanding and everlasting merit is the establishment of German American studies as a recognized province of scholarly research. He laid a solid foundation on which others are continuing to build. For this he deserves an honored place in the history of American scholarship.\n\nProfessor Paul Haupt (11-25-1858 to 12-15-1926)\n\nBorn at Görlitz in Silesia, son of Karl Gottlieb and Elise Hulse. The family an old and well known Protestant family.\n\nPaul Haupt received an excellent education and early exhibited signs of unusual brilliancy. While very he learned Hebrew. Graduating from the Gymnasium Augustum in Görlitz, he spent two years at Leipzig and in 1878 received his doctorate in Semitic Languages with high honors.\n\nHaupt's first book, Die sumerischen Familiengesetze, was an epoch making production. After receiving his doctorate Haupt spent some time studying in the British Museum. The fruits of this work resulted later in the publication of his Akkadische und sumerische Keilschrifttexte. This was the first volume in the great series of the Assyriologische Bibliothek, edited from the beginning by Dielitsch and Haupt. In 1880, he became Privatdocent for Assyriology in the University of Göttingen.\n\nHe early became the foremost authority on the Sumerian language. Thanks to the discernment of its first president, Daniel Gilman, Haupt, before he had reached the age of twenty-five years, was appointed Professor of Semitic Languages in Johns Hopkins University.\n\nDr. Haupt was the first US delegate to the International Congress of Orientalists at Rome in 1899 and the first US delegate to the International Congress of the History of Religions at Paris in 1900. His books are internationally reknown: The New Critical Editions of Hebrew Text of the Old Testement’ (1892) and the ‘Polychrome Bible’ (1898). He was the ‘honorary’ cuator of Oriental antiquities, etc., at the US National Museum in Washington DC.\n\nHe married on March 8, 1886, Minnie (Glede) born in Albany NY. Together they had three sons, Walter, Eric and Hans and one daughter, Ester/Istar?.\n\nPrior to 1920 the family lived on Linden Avenue in Baltimore. In 1920 he was living with his wife, Minnie and two children, Eric (28) and Ester or Istar? (23) on Longwood Road in Roland Park, Baltimore. The 1920 census shows an additional son, Harold and the family living on Madison Avenue in Baltimore.\n\nDr. Haupt is interred in Druid Ridge Cemetery.\n\nRev. Julius Hofmann, D.D. (4-9-1865 to 1928)\n\nJulius Hofmann was born in Friedberg, Hesse Darmstadt, Germany, the son of Peter and Maria (Engeler). In 1889 he graduated from the University of Giessen, receiving there also, in 1897, the degree of Licentiate[3] in Theology. In 1909 Franklin and Marshall College conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Divinity. In 1889, he was called to serve as assistant Pastor under Pastor Scheib at Zion Church. In 1895 when Pastor Scheib resigned, Pastor Hofmann succeeded him. He also took a course in philosophy at Johns Hopkins. In 1905 Dr. Hofmann received, from the Emperor of Germany, the decoration of the Order of the Crown[4].\n\nDr. Hofmann published several books regarding the history of Zion Church and also a volume of poems (1907). While at Zion, he founded the Young People’s Society, an association for the study of classical church music; a Sunday school library and edited a church bulletin. For many years, he was instructor in German at Johns Hopkins University. He mastered fourteen languages.\n\nOn the eve of World War One, Pastor Julius K. Hoffman and the members were about to dedicate their new parish house at Zion Church in Baltimore City. Wanting to identify the love for old world traditions they had brought across the Atlantic in their hearts, and, to profess the allegiance they had sworn to their new adopted country, Hoffman and others sought out sculptor Hans Schuler (See profile) to carve a special eagle set for the red-bricked parish hall's entrance.\n\nBy 1913, everything was in place. Schuler had produced another exquisite piece of his artistry. The sculpted sandstone lintel can be seen today: it represented an American bald eagle with a shield on its heart depicting the imperial German eagle - a symbol of the German immigrant at the heart of America.\n\nThe parish hall auditorium, located on the second floor, was named the ADLERSAAL (Eagle’s Hall).\n\nRev. Eduard Huber (6-22-1845 to 7-9-1906)\n\nRev. Huber was born in Canton Thurgau, Switzerland and emigrated to the U.S. with his parents and grand-parents at the age of nine. They settled on a farm near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was educated in the parochial school at Germantown, Wisconsin and later attended the German-English Academy in Milwaukee. He began teaching in the county public schools at seventeen years of age. He later taught in the public school system of Milwaukee. In 1865 he began his theology studies at Eden College in Marthasville, Missouri. He completed these studies in 1868 and assigned as an assistant pastor in Jefferson City, Missouri at the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the West. He was ordained in January 1869. At the death of the pastor, he was called to lead the congregation, which he did until 1873. He also, at that time, officiated as chaplain of the Missouri Legislature and volunteered his services to the Missouri State penitentiary.\n\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Synod of North America sent him, in 1873, to Richmond VA., to assume the pastorate of an Independent Congregation. He remained there for ten years and devoted all of his time to uniting the congregation.\n\nIn 1882, he was called to St. Matthew’s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Baltimore, where he spent the remaining years of his life. He introduced a bi-lingual service in his church. During his twenty-three years at St. Matthew’s, he organized three churches: Christ’s Church in Locust Point; St. Peter’s Chapel, on Federal Street near Gay, and St. Matthew’s German EvangelicalLutheran Church on Harford Rd. He also founded the German Evangelical Immigrant and Seaman’s Home.\n\nAt the time of his death he was the Supreme Judge of the Ministerial Union of his Synod, a very high judicial position in the denomination.\n\nHe was fascinated with science and the field of micro-organisms and made many important discoveries in the field. He was a member of the Microscopic Society of Johns Hopkins University and The Maryland Academy of Sciences, as well as the Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis. He was a board member of the German Society of Maryland, the German Orphan Asylum and the German Aged Peoples’ Home. He was chairman of the Executive Committee of the Society for the History of Germans in Maryland.\n\nEva ‘Maus’ Kelleher (4-18-1936)\n\nEva was born in Dortmund, Germany. During the first four and a half years of her life she lived in Dortmund with her parents and her brother. Her father was an engineer. When he received an offer of a position with an Austrian firm, he accepted it and the family moved to Kienberg-Gaming in Lower Austria. Eva entered elementary school at the age of five. She progressed very quickly in learning the basic skills of reading, writing and math. Because she was a fast learner, she was allowed to advance at her own pace and she had finished the curriculum for the seventh grade by the age of ten. This early start instilled in Eva a life-long respect for early childhood education and a keen desire to transmit her own love of learning to children.\n\nAfter the end of World War II the area of Austria where Eva and her family lived was occupied by Russian forces. They lived under this occupation for quite a while. Then the family left Kienberg-Gaming under stressful circumstances and went to Gelnhausen in the American zone of West Germany. Eva attended the Oberschule/Gymnasium Gelnhausen, after which she completed three years of schooling and internship training as a physical therapist and worked closely with doctors and nurses in a local medical clinic. She was employed in this field when she met Bill Kelleher, who was an infantry squad leader in the U.S. Army stationed at Gelnhausen. Bill and Eva were immediately attracted to each other and they were married in April, 1957. When Bill was discharged from the U.S. Army in 1958, he returned to his home city of Boston and settled down near his parents and sisters. Eva and their little daughter joined him as soon as they could do so. Their family grew to include four daughters. In 1962 Bill completed his B. A. degree in Economics at Boston College. Economic Laboratory offered him the Baltimore / Washington, D.C. sales area in 1963. So the Kellehers moved to Baltimore and began to reach out to the vibrant German-American community of this geographic area.\n\nIn September, 1966, Eva found her special calling in life when she was offered a position teaching German to the elementary school children at the German Language School located at Zion Church in Baltimore. Eva was delighted to accept this position. She had the ability to relate well to the children and enrich her instruction with a variety of strategies that captured their attention and built up their enthusiasm. The children loved to be with her and attended her German classes eagerly. She set high expectations for her young students and they reciprocated by rising to the challenge, learning German well, and eagerly participating in the activities that she planned. When Elizabeth Roberts decided to retire as the principal of the German Language School in 1985, she recommended Eva Kelleher to be her successor in this position. Eva willingly agreed to accept this multifaceted and demanding position while continuing to teach German in the school. She also took several additional college courses to prepare herself better for her new responsibilities. For the past twenty-six years she has administered the German Language School energetically and developed the instructional program to serve the needs of many different people in the community. In recent years the enrollment of this Saturday school has reached and at times exceeded 100 students. Approximately half of these students are adults.\n\nIn addition to her ongoing responsibilities at the German Language School, Eva is a board member of the German Society of Maryland. This position stems from her election as president of the Women’s Auxiliary of the German Society, a leadership position that carries with it ex officio membership on the German Society’s Board. The Auxiliary is supportive of the German Language School and honors high-achieving students there who score at the 85th and the 90th percentile on the AATG German Language Test (Levels 1, 2 and 3).

(2-28-1795 to 12-29-1865)\n\nSource: Centennial History of the Evangelical Church in Maryland 1820-1920, Wentz\n\nHe was chairman of the committee that drafted the first Constitution of the Synod. Five times he was President of the Synod and he was always prominent in the work of the body. He was a nephew of Daniel Kurtz, the first President, and a grandson of the John Nicholas Kurtz who was ordained by the Pennsylvania Ministerium at its first meeting in 1748. Few men have exerted a greater influence in the Lutheran Church of America than Benjamin Kurtz. His public career extended over half a century and during that period he was identified with all the more important events in the history of our Church. His life story has been related by Hutter and Stoever and Morris, and the influence of his career has been estimated by many others.\n\nBenjamin Kurtz was born in Harrisburg, February 28, 1795. His youth was marked by seasons of deep religious convictions.\n\nHe studied theology under George Lochman and was licensed by the Pennsylvania Ministerium at Frederick in 1815. For several months he was the assistant to his uncle in Baltimore, but that same year accepted a call to the Hagerstown charge. He was then the only pastor in Washington County and his charge embraced five congregations. Sixteen years later when he left that field the number of Lutherans there had been multiplied by four and six pastors were required for the field.\n\nFor two years (1831-1833) he was pastor at Chambersburg, but the precarious condition of his health made it imperative for him to lay aside the active duties of pulpit and pastorate. Just then Dr. Morris invited him to take charge of the Lutheran Observer and as editor of that paper for twenty-eight years he wielded his chief influence. When Dr. Kurtz took charge of the paper it was a small bi-weekly with seven hundred subscribers; when he laid down the editorial pen in 1861 it was a large weekly with more than eight thousand subscribers.\n\nDr. Kurtz was not only prominent in organizing the Maryland Synod but he also took a leading part in the formation of the General Synod. The General Synod was organized in his church at Hagerstown. He was present at almost every convention of that body until his death and was twice its President. For many years he was President of the Home Missionary Society and of the Parent Education Society.\n\nIn 1826 Dr. Kurtz was appointed by the General Synod to visit Europe in the interest of the Gettysburg Seminary and after two years he returned with $10,000 and a great number of books.\n\nLate in life he was instrumental in establishing the Missionary Institute at Selinsgrove.\n\nDr. Kurtz stoutly maintained the \"evangelical\" standpoint and was an ardent advocate of the \"new measures\" and of \"American Lutheranism”. To his dying day he zealously advocated English preaching, Sunday school, protracted meetings, and temperance reform. He is characterized as \"an eloquent preacher, a sympathetic pastor, a keen debater, and a voluminous writer.\" The decree of D.D. was conferred on him by Washington College in 1838, and the degree of LL.D. by Wittenberg College in 1858. He died in Baltimore, December 29, 1865.\n\nRev. Johann Daniel Kurtz (3-30-1763 to 6-30-1856)\n\nFirst President of the Maryland Synod, 1820 –1823\n\nFirst President of the General Synod, 1820\n\nJohann Daniel Kurtz was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania, in 1763 and died in Baltimore, Maryland, June 30, 1856. He studied theology under the direction of his father, and afterward with Reverend Dr. Henry Ernst Muhlenberg at Lancaster, Pennsylvania He was licensed to preach by the synod of Pennsylvania in 1784, and for some time assisted his father in pastoral work. He later took charge of a congregation near York, Pennsylvania. In 1786 the Synod sent he and the Rev. Jacob Goering, Mr. Kurtz's brother-in-law, on a missionary tour to the vacant congregations in Maryland and Virginia. They fulfilled this appointment, and the next year Mr. Kurtz made another tour, going over nearly the same ground.\n\nAbout this time Mr. Kurtz made a visit to Baltimore, where he preached for his father's friend, the Rev. Mr. Gerock at Zion Church. His services proved highly acceptable, and the result was that he was called to be his assistant, and finally became his successor.\n\nIn 1792 he was married to Maria Messersmith and their marriage lasted for more than a half century. Together they had nine children. Mrs. Kurtz died in 1841.\n\nIn 1816 the degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon him by the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1823 the Rev. Mr. Uhlhorn was chosen his assistant. In 1833 Mr. Kurtz resigned his charge, and a pension was granted. In his eighty-eighth year he preached on two occasions, one of which was the dedication of the Rev. M. Schwartz's church. In 1853, being then in his ninetieth year, he attended, by particular request, the laying of the corner stone of the two German Lutheran churches, and, on each occasion, delivered an address. Dr. Kurtz died in Baltimore on the 30th of June, 1856, in the ninety-third year of his age, leaving one son and three daughters.\n\nRev. Kurtz is buried at Green Mount Cemetery.\n\nCharles Hermann Miegel (2-20-1897 to 1958)\n\nMr. Miegel was born in Baltimore.

He completed his studies at Johns Hopkins and went to the Law School of the University of Maryland. He was admitted to the bar in 1922. He started a small firm, Miegel & Rollins and later associated with the law firm of Moylan and McKeldin. It was during this time that his career path changed and he wanted to teach. He spent a brief period teaching in elementary schools and then went to Polytechnic Institute in 1922, where he taught English. He spent thirty years at Poly. He also gave courses in Journalism and Public Life at the Baltimore Evening High School at City College and taught German for Berlitz and later in the School of Foreign Languages. In 1925 he joined the faculty at Peabody Institute where he taught German.\n\nHe was in love with music, literature and the theater. He was involved with the Morris Mechanic as assistant manager of the New Theatre. He wrote plays for the amateur stage. Most of the annual ‘Poly Follies’ had him as author during his tenure at Poly. He was involved with Zion Church as a member of the Church Council, Sunday School teacher and member of the Volunteer Choir. He founded the Young People organization at Zion and each year the group would present a play. They played to many full houses (held at the Maryland Casualty Company 1200 seat auditorium). For the 175th Anniversary of Zion, he wrote a series of historical scenes in a pageant titled, ‘The Walls of Zion’.\n\nHe is interred in Moreland Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\nJohn Gottlieb Morris (11-14-1803 to 10-10-1895)\n\nDr. Morris was born in York, PA. His father was a native of Württemberg. The family changed their name from Moritz to Morris because it was at the time of the Revolutionary war and they did not want to be mistaken for Hessian deserters. He received his early education in the Classical Academy at York and enrolled in his sophomore year in Princeton College. He attended Princeton for three years, but in his senior year transferred to Dickenson College in Carlisle, PA, where he graduated in 1823. His desire was to become a Lutheran Minister and he studied under several prominent theologians of that time, namely, Rev. Mr. Schmucker and Bishop Schultze. He completed his studies at the Theological Seminary at Gettysburg and graduated in 1826.\n\nHe applied for a license to preach in Maryland and in 1826 was admitted to the Synod of Maryland and Virginia. He preached to a small band of English Lutherans in Baltimore and stayed there for thirty-three years as their pastor. The congregation was located on West Lexington Street near Howard. A few of his parishioners formed the Second and Third English Lutheran churches. He supported the move. He has been called the ‘Patriarch of the English Lutheran Church in Baltimore’. He was pastor of the First Lutheran Church in Baltimore and established a literary institute for women in Lutherville, Baltimore County.\n\nHe accepted the position of Librarian at the Peabody Institute. He served several other parishes over the years. He was editor of the ‘Lutheran Oberserver’ and founder of the Lutherville Female Seminary. He served as president of the College at Gettysburg, the Maryland Bible Society, the Maryland Academy of Sciences, the Maryland Historical Society, Society for the History of Germans in Maryland, the Historical Society of the Lutheran Church and vice-president of the Maryland Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. He was a Professor in the Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, the Natural History in the University of Maryland and served in many other societies. In fact upon his death he was president of four historical societies.\n\nHe had many works published including ‘Popular Exposition of the Gospels,’ published in Baltimore in two volumes in 1840; ‘Life of John Arndt,’ in 1853; The Blind Girl of Wirtenberg; and ‘Catherine DeBora,’ in 1856; ‘Martin Behaim,’ a discourse before the Maryland Historical Society in 1855; and ‘The Lords Baltimore,’ published in 1874.\n\nArmin Mruck (6-6-1925 to )\n\nArmin Mruck was born June 6, 1925, son of Otto E. and Käthe Mruck (nee Burdanski). He was born in a small town called Osterode am Herz, which at that time was a district in Lower Saxony, but in 2016 became incorporated with the larger Göttingen. Armin was raised in a solid middle class Prussian family, both his father and grandfather members of the teaching profession. Armin attended the public school in the area, the Kaiser Wilhelm Gymnasium (established in 1907). He graduated in 1943.As a child, Armin did not feel the impact of the depression that came in the 30s. Friends and family would often bring and share food. His family was blessed with a ‘Dienst Mädchen (day servant) which would help with food preparation and caring for both he and his older brother Dieter. While attending the Gymnasium in 1935, his principal refused to join the Nazi party, remaining at the school until 1943. It was also at the beginning of the Hitler Youth program. Armin’s hometown was small and most knew each other. Youth groups were not new. Many, however, refused to join the Hitler Youth movement. It wasn’t until late 1935 when a law passed requiring every child over the age of 10 to attend the meetings that Armin joined. The group met twice a week. The meetings served several purposes, one to keep the children positive through music and songs, and also to begin the party indoctrination.\n\nA round-up of German pastors began in the mid-30s, which included such well-known authors and leaders as Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemüller. Despite these developments, Armin’s family continued attending church service and Armin was confirmed in 1940 in their Lutheran church.\n\nWorld War II took its toll on the Mruck family. Armin’s older brother, Dieter, an expert sailor, joined the German Navy. Armin’s father Otto, a veteran of World War I, was also drafted in August of 1939. Dieter served aboard a minesweeper/torpedo boat and later was loaned from the Navy to the Air Force where he became a Reconnaissance Pilot. His father remained on the Polish front for his entire service time. It was at this time where Armin’s home life became more somber, where reality set in and waiting for the postman became a big part of their life. Christmas 1940 was the last time the Mruck family was together. It was a fun time for the family. As customary for many German families, they were all talented musicians, with Armin’s father on the violin, his mother and brother on the piano and Armin himself on the accordion. It is not unusual for Armin to pull out his accordion at Christmas.\n\nTo read more, click here\n\nPhilip William Otterbein (6-3-1726 to 11-17-1813)\n\nFather of the United Brethren Church, Philip Otterbein was born in Dillenburg, Germany. His father was a man of culture, who gave his son the finest literary advantages. He was brought up in the German Reformed Church and was ordained to the ministry at Dillenburg on June 13, 1749. For a time he performed the duties of both a teacher and a pastor; but in 1852 he felt compelled to come to the US in order to administer to the spiritual needs of the large number of Germans who had already left Germany and arrived in the US. He reached New York on July 28, 1852 and proceeded to Philadelphia, under the guidance of the Rev. Michael Schlattel, whose appeal had brought him here. There were six young men in the party, and they were sent to different posts. The Rev. Mr. Otterbein was sent to Lancaster, PA. Here he served for six years in the second most important German Reformed church in the US. During his administration the old, wooden church, which had been built long before, was superseded by a massive stone building. In 1758 he resigned in order to visit his old home in Germany; but the French and English war made travel dangerous and he accepted a temporary charge at Tulpehocken, PA and remained there two years. In September, 1765, he moved to York, PA and was the pastor of that large church until 1774, when he was called to assume the charge of the independent Reformed Church of Baltimore. He did make it back to his home in 1770.\n\nThe Second Reformed Church of Baltimore had come into existence in 1771 and was the result of a serious division in the First Reformed Church over the conduct of its pastor. A large minority, after appealing in vain to the synod for relief, left the First Church and established an independent Reformed church. Their first pastor, the Rev. Benedict Schwope had just come from German. A large lot was purchased on Conway near Sharp and a small frame building was erected. Efforts were made to reunite the congregation however the efforts were in vain. Rev. Schwope resigned and Rev. Mr. Otterbein was urged to take the reins. He took charge on May 4, 1774. The German population of Baltimore was small at that time, the entire population of which numbered only 6,000. After the War of Independence conditions became more favorable and the congregation, in 1785, developed a formal organization. A set of rules, now quite famous, was adopted January 1, 1785. The new rules departed from the tenets of the Reformed Church and established the new body. Mr. Otterbein enjoyed the support of several other church affiliations namely, Amr. Martin Boehme of the Mennonite Church (later expelled from that body because of the new views he held; George Adam Guething of the German Reformed (later expelled for espousing fanatical views) and later of the United Brethren Church, where he spent 40 years as a preacher; Rev. Dr. William Hendel, German Reformed Church ; the Rev. Daniel Wagner, Rev. Anthony Hautz, Rev. Frederick L. Henop and Rev. Jacob Weimer. To these is to be added the Rev. Benedict Schwope. Long before the seperation came, these ministers had formed themselves into a bond of union under the name of \"The United Ministers.\" They met several times, the last meeting being at the parsonage of Rev. Otterbein in 1789. Here a new mode of procedure was adopted. The group consisted of fourteen ministers, seven were present.\n\nThey adopted the first creed of the self-constituted organization. It is entitled: \"The Doctrine of the United Brethren in Christ.\"\n\nWilliam Otterbein was elected bishop of the new church at a formal conference held in 1800 at the home of Peter Kemp near Frederick. It was at this conference that the name United Brethren Church was also solidified.\n\nThe church were Otterbein officiated at Conway and Sharp was replaced by a large brick building that remains there today. It was built in 1784 and is popularly called ‘The Otterbein Church’.\n\nRev. August Pohlman, M.D., D.D. (1864 to )\n\nDr. Pohlman was born in 1864 in Baltimore, Maryland, to Frederick Pohlman and Augusta Scherger, both of Germany. He was baptized by Rev. E. J. Wolf, D.D., and attended Sunday school at the Second English Lutheran Church, Baltimore. He received his early education in the public schools in Baltimore City and attended Pennsylvania College in Gettysburg in 1888. During his college days he was a member of the Philomathean Literary Society and also had managed the college gymnasium for four years. He graduated in 1891. After completing two years at the Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, he read the third year of the course while taking the first year of medicine at the University of Maryland, preparing for mission work in Africa. He was licensed and ordained by the Maryland Synod in 1803 and 1804 respectively. He received his degree in medicine and went to the Muhlenberg Mission, Monrovia, Liberia, Africa, in the fall of 1896. Rev. Pohlman was married in the mission on June 11, 1899, to Augusta V. Shaffer, daughter of Rev. J. F. Shaffer, D.D., of Delaware, Ohio. They had a daughter Dorothea, in September, 1907. Both returned to the United States during 1900, presenting the cause of Muhlenberg Mission throughout the country. They left the mission field in the spring of 1902, and began home mission work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the then new Temple Lutheran Church. This mission has had remarkable growth, reaching a thousand members in the first five years, necessitating the large new building for which the corner stone was laid in less than a year after the new pastor took charge.\n\nThe mission was only receiving aid from the board for eighteen months. In addition to the degree of B.A. given by the college, an M.A. was given after three years, and M.D. by the Baltimore Medical College in 1896, and the honorary degree of D.D. was given by Pennsylvania College in 1916.\n\nDr. Pohlman was president of the East Pennsylvania Synod during the years of 1915 to 1918, and was a member of the Synodical Mission Committee up until the end of his office as president of the synod. He was for years the Lutheran member of the Philadelphia Sunday School Association and one of the trustees of the Pastor's Fund of the General Synod until the merger of the three bodies, when he became president of the Board of Ministerial Relief in 1919. He was also a delegate to the General Synod meetings at Sunbury, Atchison and Akron. He was a member of the Evangelistic Commission of the Federal Council of Churches and president of the Keswick Colony, New Jersey, which rehabilitated and cared for alcoholics, and he is also the Lutheran member of the National Reform Association. He was also a member of the Pan Lutheran Missionary Society to South America, until that work was taken over by the Foreign Board.\n\nWhile in Africa Dr. Pohlman was a prolific writer for the Church papers. The articles were published under the title of \"Letters from Africa.\" He was a frequent contributor to the Church papers. He was also a well-known popular speaker, being often in demand for Sunday school and Young People's conferences, missions and men's meetings. He frequently addressed shop and car-barn meetings, and is often in Reform Institutions, showing men the better way of life. To the brotherhoods and men's organizations he was no stranger.\n\nOn September 28, 1939, Dr. Pohlman celebrated his seventeenth year as pastor of Temple Church. During that time nearly 3,000 people have become members of the church.\n\nAbraham Joseph Rice (Reiss) (1800-1862)-Rabbi\n\nRabbi Rice was the first ordained rabbi to serve in a rabbinical position in the United States.\n\nRice was born around 1800 at Gochsheim, near Würzburg, Bavaria. He studied at the Würzburg yeshivah, and was ordained by Rabbi Abraham Bing. He later continued his studies at the yeshivah of Rabbi Wolf Hamburger in Fürth, and then headed a small yeshivah in Zell. In the 1830s he married Rosalie Leucht, and in 1840 they immigrated to the United States. After a brief attempt at reviving the Jewish community in Newport, Rhode Island, he accepted an appointment as the first rabbi of Congregation Nidche Israel in Baltimore.\n\nRice usually delivered his sermons in German, later occasionally in English, and insisted on retaining all the traditional piyyutim in the prayers. His constant battle against assimilation and lax observance of shabbat and kashrut brought him into conflict with many of his congregants. When he decreed that Sabbath-breakers should not be called to the Torah, there was such resistance that he had to back down; but he insisted that while they could be called up, nobody should answer \"amen\" to the blessings they recited. After an 1842 incident in which he objected to Masonic rites held at a Jewish funeral, some members left the congregation and founded the Har Sinai Verein, the first lasting Reform congregation in the United States.\n\nRice was known throughout the United States and Germany as a learned Talmudist. In 1845 he established a Hebrew school, one of the earliest in the United States.\n\nIn 1849, finding it impossible to resist the demand for reforms at Nidche Israel, he resigned his position, founded his own synagogue which was strictly orthodox; to support himself he opened a dry goods store, and then a grocery. In 1862 he was asked to return to the rabbinate of Nidche Israel, with the promise that it would remain strictly orthodox; but he died a few months later. In 1871 an organ was introduced and the Reform prayer book was adopted, and Nidche Israel became a Reform temple.\n\nRabbi Reiss is buried at Baltimore Hebrew Cemetery.\n\nSchloegel (Schlögel), Charles (2-27-1827 to 1-27-1892)\n\nCharles (Karl) Schloegel born 2.27.1827 in Bietigheim, Wurttemberg to Karl Frederick and Christina Rosina Ribbmann.

According to a civil war pension record, he resided at 169 S. Bond Street. This was also confirmed by a Sunpaper article on September 9, 1879 reporting the death of a House Painter, Robert Schnoor who died when he fell from the roof of the house of Rev. C.A Schlogel, located at 169 South Bond Street, next to the St. Peter’s (German) Evangelical Lutheran Church.\n\nHe spent 30 years at St. Peter’s German Lutheran Church. Rev.

On October 20, 1901, the twenty-fifth anniversary of his connection with the congregation was celebrated by the members of the congregation and the public in general.\n\nDuring his stay in Europe Dr. Schneeberger wrote \"The Life and Works of Rabbi Yehooda Hanasi,'' contributed articles to the \"Jewish Messenger\" and the '\"American Hebrew of New York\"'; \"The Rabbi and the Young People\" (Activities of the Rabbi), a translation of \"Plessner's on Prayer.\"\n\nDr. Schneeberger's activities were not confined to his congregation. He was for a number of years president of the Education Society, where he conducted the education of the immigrants in Baltimore from their very first arrival, and was for years the superintendent of the night school of the above society; he was a member of the advisory board of the New York Theological Seminary, was a director of the Alliance Israelite L'niverselle of the Baltimore branch, was a member of the advisory council of the \"American Jewish Committee,\" a member of the executive committee of \"Orthodox Jewish Congregations of the United States and Canada,\" and was the secretary of the Hebrew Ladies' Sewing Society of Baltimore. In April 1882, he was married to Miss Sarah Nussbaun. daughter of the late Rabbi Charles-Nussbaun, of New York City.\n\n1880 Census shows Sigmund and Regina with son William Henry (minister) living at 16 Lloyd Street, East side. William was 30 and Jacob and Jennie? Also lived in the house, they were 24 and 18 respectively. The parents are both listed as 61. Father a retired clothier. Both parents were born in Prussia.\n\nRev. Schneeberger died on November 2, 1916. He is buried at Hebrew Friendship Cemetery.\n\nTheodor Schneider (1703-1764) Jesuit Priest\n\nFather Schneider was born in the Palatinate, near Speyer in 1703. He was about thirty-eight years old when he emigrated to the U.S. at the request of Father Henry Neale, who arrived in Maryland in 1740. Father Neale was frustrated that he couldn’t serve the German population because of his inability to speak their language\n\nFather Schneider held the chair of Philosophy and Apologetics at the Jesuit school at Liege and became rector of the Jesuit house of studies in the city of Heidelberg. Rev. Schneider was a member of the faculty of philosophy of the University of Heidelberg. In addition to being a preacher and a university professor, he was also a respected physician. He was elected to the highest office of the university, that of Rector Magnificus[8] for 1738-1739. He was ordered to go to the U.S. on September 19, 1740. If you wonder why such a learned and respected man would be sent, there are two simple reasons. In the first place, Father Schneider wanted to go and he had studied medicine in hopes of one day being able to use his abilities in a foreign mission. There was also the fact that many German Catholics were drifting from the faith. This was primarily due to conditions in the U.S. because at the time Catholics could not worship in a group or build a church. They were able to worship only in private.\n\nFather Schneider was welcomed in the U.S., not only for his ability to preach, but because of his medical background. Being a priest at the time was difficult and he traveled through the early settlements of Maryland and surrounding states in disguise. Despite his extensive travels, he managed to copy tow complete missals of seven hundred pages each.\n\nRev. Peter Stanislaus Schreiber (1804 to 9-15-1845)\n\nRev. Schreiber was born in Baltimore in 1804. His father was a German who in youth reached this country; his mother was the daughter of Frederick Yeiser, one of the earliest settlers of Baltimore; he was a soldier in the Revolution and present at Brandywine and Yorktown. The mother was a Protestant, but became a convert to the faith of her husband, Catholic. The son graduated from Mount St. Mary's College at Emmitsburg in 1820.\n\nHe received the order of priesthood in September, 1828. Among the churches he served were St. Patrick's, Washington; a church in Richmond and later the Cathedral in Baltimore. St. Vincent de Paul Church, Baltimore, was consecrated in November, 1841. In its steeple, which is one hundred and thirty feet high, hangs a bell taken from a Spanish chapel in Spain, during one of its wars. Rev. Schreiber became pastor at St. Vincent de Paul. [Rumor has it that Frederick Yeiser, grandfather to Rev. Schreiber, entertained George Washington very near the site where his grandson later officiated as their priest].\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Schreiber's received was known as a wonderful speaker regarding his faith. He had large congregations and grew very popular. This from a written piece in 1830, \"His style is easy and fluent denoting the man of lingual refinement and extensive reading. His gesticulation is graceful, while the matter of his discourses plainly indicates careful thought in their preparation, and the workings of a heart of benevolence.\"\n\nHe was an ardent temperance advocate and among the first of the clergymen of his church to form Catholic temperance associations in Baltimore. He broached the subject in a sermon which he preached in St. Peter's Church and it is thought his efforts directed the movement to success. Mr. Schreiber was a gentleman of polished manners and pleasing conversational powers. He died in 1845. A tablet bearing his name and that of its first pastor is in the vestibule of St. Vincent's Church.\n\nHe is interred at the Sulpician Cemetery.\n\nRev. Dr. Andrea (Andrew) Schwartz (11-13-1819 to 12-29-1894)\n\nAndreas Schwartz was born in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. He was six when his family came to America, settling in New York, where he received his education. At 19, he entered the Theological Seminary at Schenectady, being ordained four years later. His first charges were in New York and New Jersey. He came to Baltimore in 1848 to take over the German parish at Bond and Lombard Streets. He stayed there until 1851 when he founded the First German United Evangelical congregation in East Baltimore and erected the church building on Eastern Avenue, near Broadway. He served there for fourteen years, when he accepted a call to the German Lutheran congregation in Richmond, Virginia. Because of illness, he retired from this charge and returned to Baltimore and founded the Zion Lutheran Church in Canton. Because of failing health, he resigned his ministry in 1889.\n\nDuring his early ministry he studied medicine and graduated from Washington University and while serving his congregation, he used his medical background to provide gratuitous treatment of the poor.\n\nHe was married to Christina (1821-1890). They had a daughter, Josephine who married Charles Herzog. After his retirement, he lived with his daughter. They also had two sons Col. John A. Schwartz and William H. Schwartz, both serving in the Federal Army during the Civil War.\n\nThe New Church Magazine, 1874 (volume 2) states that Rev. Schwartz preached and believed in the Swedenborg (a religious movement, informed by the writings of Swedish scientist and theologian Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772). Swedenborg claimed to have received a new revelation from Jesus Christ through continuous heavenly visions which he experienced over a period of at least twenty-five years. In his writings, he predicted that God would replace the traditional Christian Church, establishing a 'New Church', which would worship God in one person: Jesus Christ. The New Church doctrine is that each person must actively cooperate in repentance, reformation, and regeneration of one's life. Source: Wiki).\n\nRev. Schwartz served as pastor at many of the German Lutheran Churches in the area:\n\n1835-German Evangelical Congregation in Wheeling, WV.\n\n1851-1865-First German United Evangelical Church, Baltimore, MD.\n\n1870-German Evangelical, Zion-Baltimore, MD.\n\n1873-1889-German United Evangelical, Baltimore, MD. (Also known as Batz Church on East and Dillon Sts.)\n\nRev. Schwartz is buried at Mt. Carmel Cemetery. This is strange because the First German United Evangelical Cemetery is often called ‘Schwartz’ cemetery after Rev. Schwartz.\n\nRev. A.L. Timothy Stiemke (8-24-1847 to 3-14-1908)\n\nRev. Stiemke was the pastor of Emanuel Evangelical Lutheran Church on Caroline Street in Baltimore. He was born in Kirchhayn, Washington County, Wisconsin. He was the son of Charles A. and Wilhelmena, both natives of Prussia, Germany. They went to Wisconsin with a group from Germany and settled on land procured from the government. The Stiemkes had eight children.\n\nRev. A. L. T. Stiemke was born in 1847 and was educated by his father. He attended Martin Luther College at Buffalo, NY. He later attended Concordia College and Ft. Wayne, IN. He graduated in 1874, from Concordia Theological Seminary in St. Louis. He was ordained the same year.\n\nWhen in Buffalo he taught school and was also adjunct professor in Concordia College, Ft. Wayne, one year. He began his ministry in Warder, Tex., in 1874, where the congregation was predominantly Slavic, making it necessary for Rev. Stiemke to learn the language. From there he went to Houston, Texas, Trinity Church, and two and a-half years later went to St. John's Church, in New Orleans. He remained in New Orleans for six years and served three terms as president of that synodical district.\n\nHe received his call from Emanuel in September 1888 and was installed as their pastor. At one point the congregation had over 1000 communicants, and more than 350 in the Sunday School.\n\nHe was a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio and other states. He married Anna Schoening, daughter of Matthias and Margaret (Baumann), natives of Holstein, Germany, in November of 1874. They had one child, Adopf Stiemke (1895-1967). Pastor Stiemke is buried at Immanuel German Cemetery on Grindon Avenue.\n\nMr. Vaditz was the son of Anthony and Hannah Vaditz, both of Hanover, Germany. George was instructed early at Zion School in Baltimore[1], a private bilingual (German/English) school at the age of five and was fluent in both English and German when he lost his hearing at the early age of eight. His hearing loss was attributable to scarlet fever. His education was then through a private instructor until the age of 14 when he entered the Maryland School for the Deaf. He attended Gallaudet University, which was known as the National Deaf Mute College prior to being renamed. While at Gallaudet he was secretary to the President and foreman of their printing office. He graduated in 1884 as the valedictorian. He was named Gallaudet’s Visionary Leader in July 2014.Following graduation he began to teach at the Maryland School for the Deaf. He left the Maryland school in 1888 and began teaching at the Colorado School for the Deaf. He kept close association with his school in Maryland, however, and provided the foundation for the Maryland Association of the Deaf, which he led as their 7th president.\n\nHe was instrumental in the preservation of sign language. Veditz launched the project Preservation of Sign Language in 1913 at the National Association of the Deaf (U.S.) in response to the tragic aftermath of Milan 1880. In 1880, oralist proponents at the conference (International Congress on Education of the Deaf) in Milan voted to ban sign language. In fear for the decline of sign language, Veditz and the NAD produced a series of films Preservation of Sign Language from 1913 to 1920 which are the oldest filmed records of sign language.\n\nMr. Vaditz was also editor of both the Maryland Bulletin and the Colorado Index. He founded the Colorado Association for the Deaf in 1904. He was a strong advocate for the deaf and He contributed articles to The Jewish Deaf, The Silent Worker, the Deaf American, and the Deaf Mute's Journal. Veditz was editor-in-chief for the Optimist in Atlanta and the Silver Courier in Chicago. Many of his articles are preserved in the Gallaudet University Library Deaf Collections and Archives.\n\nHe founded both the Maryland School for the Deaf’s Alumni Association and the Gallaudet’s Alumni Association.\n\nMr. Vaditz married Elizabeth (Bessie) Bigler in June 1894. They met during a game of chess, which was also a passion of Mr. Vaditz. Ms. Vaditz was also a teacher. George Veditz was hailed as the ‘Father of American Sign Language’.\n\n[1] American Annals of the Deaf, The Sound Memories of a Semi-Mute; Olv. LIV No 2, March 1909, page 122\n\nVogtmann, Ludwig, Rev. (6-4-1828 to 2-18-1890)\n\nRev. Vogtmann was born at Herblinghausen in what was then the Prussian Province of Westphalia. He attended parochial school. At the age of 16 he began his classical studies at the Royal Gymnasium at Arnsberg. He graduated from that school with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1850. He attended the University of Bonn for his theological studies and completed those studies at Paderborn Seminary. He was ordained a priest at the Seminary August 18, 1855. He was immediately made assistant priest at Warburg. He remained there for two years and then transferred to the Church Beatam Virginem in sole at Bachum in Westphalia.\n\nAt this time, the Redemptorist Fathers in Baltimore had charge of Holy Cross Church and they heard of Rev. Vogtmann’s work and invited him to come to the U.S. He accepted and arrived in the US, December 5, 1889. He immediately assumed charge of Holy Cross Church in South Baltimore. The congregation at that time, numbered 1200. Steadily the number grew to 5,000 built steadily upon the physical buildings of the church. The new addition to the church building cost $70,000. It was the red brick gothic style building with a tower and spire of 200 feet. He added a handsome marble altar inside and a chime of three bells. There was the addition of a school house that greeted 600 pupils who were taught by 13 sisters. He worked at Holy Cross alone until his final year when failing health brought him assistance.\n\nHe was well-known and popular in Baltimore. He passed away at the parish house on February 18, 1890. He had been ill three weeks with abdominal trouble, which resulted from his long and severe attack of typhoid fever the previous summer. During his illness, Cardinal Gibbons was a frequent visitor\n\nSource: The Baltimore Sunpaper, February 19, 1890, page 6\n\nPeter Augustus Witmer was born in the Clear Spring District of Washington County, Md. His paternal ancestor, Benjamin Witmer, emigrated from the canton of Berne, in Switzerland, in 1716, and settled in the Conestoga Valley, Lancaster County, Pa. In 1805 his great-grandfather, Henry Witmer, moved from Lancaster County, Pa., to Washington County, and bought property on the Beaver and Conococheague Creeks.

Herbert. The paper expanded to a twenty-eight column paper in 1881. The paper is the only morning daily in the area. It is widely read for that reason.\n\nMr. Witmer married Mary Katherine ‘Brewer’ (1847 to 1924). Together they have two sons, Harry (1877 to 1952) and Frank (1869 to 1934) and a daughter, Clara (dob 1870).\n\nHe is best known publicly for his work with the State and County education systems and has been ranked as one of the foremost educators in Maryland. As State Commissioner he examined all schools, teachers and processes. He restored the finances of the schools and during that time, it is said that new schools sprang up in every district.

The church realized it would be impossible for the Vicar Apostolic, seated in London, to exercise jurisdiction over the church in the new country. Accordingly a General Chapter of the American Clergy was called at White Marsh. John Carroll was appointed Prefect-Apostle and in 1789 the first Bishop of the newly created diocese o Baltimore, thereby becoming the first Bishop of the United States.\n\n[2] Phonology is the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken human language, or the field of linguistics studying this use.\n\n[3] An academic degree ranking below that of doctor given by some European universities\n\n[4] There are several Orders of the Crown, however, most are linked to military service. The Order of the Crown of Westphalia (German: Orden der Westfälischen Krone) was instituted in Paris on the 25th of December, 1809 by King Hieronymus I of Westphalen, better known as Napoleon's brother Jérôme Bonaparte.\n\n[5]Christoph Martin Wieland (September 5, 1733 – January 20, 1813) was a German poet and writer.\n\n[6] Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (August 1749 – 22 March 1832) was a German writer. Goethe's works span the fields of poetry, drama, literature, theology, philosophy, pantheism, and science. Goethe was one of the key figures of German literature and the movement of Weimar Classicism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Goethe is the originator of the concept of Weltliteratur (\"world literature\"). His influence on German philosophy is virtually immeasurable..\n\n[7] Zion Deutsche Schule is still in operation, having just celebrated it’s 80th year in 2009. The school teaches the German language every Saturday morning.\n\n[8] The title is used widely in universities across Europe, including Germany. At some universities it is phrased in a loftier manner, as Rector Magnificus or Lord Rector.\n\n[9] Turners, an athletic and political organization founded in Germany during the second decade of the nineteenth century. Turners quickly established societies (known as Turnverein) in the American cities in which they settled. These societies served as athletic, political, and social centers for German communities in the United States. The Turners most important contribution to American life in their communities has been their advocacy of physical education and fitness.\n\nFrom Undercurrents of German Influence in Maryland (A paper written by Prof. Albert B. Faust-Cornell University, February 21, 1911)\n\nAlmost all of the earlier faculty members of JHU had taken their doctorate degrees at German Universities (Gildersleeve, Remsen, Adams, Morse, Haupt, Wood, Warren, Ely, Renouf and Williams.)\n\nQuote from James B. Angell..veteran president of Michigan…at a special ceremony..JHUs 25th Anniversary, no mention was ever made, even by implication, that this university ideas derived directly from Germany, yet emphasis was laid on statistics showing that the number of American students attending German universities had decreased. Was it too obvious to mention…this German university idea, has a hard struggle for recognition in most parts of the country. The University of Chicago more generous in acknowledgement of German influence on the graduate school. At the 50th convocation, March 22, 1904, a group of representative German professors were invited and honored by the University of Chicago and a celebration instituted which was called ‘Recognition of the Indebtedness of American Universities to the Ideals of German Scholarship’."
