        "text": "PRAIRIE TOWNSHIP (Shelby County)\n\nTHIS township is bounded on the south by Effingham county, north by Richland township, east by Big Spring, and on the west by Holland. It contains fifty-four sections. It is drained by Jordan, Wolf, Rattlesnake and Hog creeks and their affluents. The township is strictly prairie -- only slightly timbered in the north-west and south-east corners, with a grove on Brush creek, section thirty, and two small groves on Wolf creek. In consequence, it was only sparsely settled until a comparatively late date. At the opening of the year (1845), the township was very little settled; indeed, it could hardly be said to be settled at all. At that time the most hopeful of the old settlers only dared to think that the country would ever be settled, except al ong the timber edges. There were several reasons for their belief at that time. The prairie grass grew thick and very high, and its roots were tough; and, there being no roads or ditches through the country, the most of this land was wet the whole year. It was, therefore, an impossibility for the first settlers to break this prairie, even where the land would drain. The early residents of the country hardly ever possessed more than one team. The plow they used would now be considered a curiosity -- i t had a strip of iron for a shear, attached to a wooden mould-board, and with this kind of an implement they could manage to plow a little where a clearing had been made in the timber.\n\nThe first settler that we have any account of here was David Keller; he came from Indiana, and located on the north side of Rattlesnake creek, on section thirteen, about 1835. The first land he entered here was forty acres S.E. quarter of the N.W. quarte r, section thirteen, town nine, range five, in April, 1836.\n\nThe next entry was by William Leach, of forty acres, in section five, south-east quarter of the north-east quarter, same town, in May, 1837.\n\nNovember of the same year, George Rouse entered the forty north of the Leach forty.\n\nThomas McKibbin made the fifth entry of forty acres, north-east quarter of the north west quarter, section twelve, town nine, range five, Feb., 1842. Three years later, he made the next entry, entering the west eighty in the same quarter. Preston Ramsey and John Cregger were early settlers in the south-east part of the township.\n\nPaul Daniel, now living here, is one of the old residents of the country; his father, Nathan Daniel, came to Big Spring township in 1831.\n\nWilliam S. Colston, a native of England, settled at the head of Rattlesnake creek, section fourteen, about 1845 - place now owned by J. Shelton. Colston afterwards settled on the mound on section eleven, in 1853 - the place is now owned by E. Deal.\n\nOther early settlers in this part of the township are -- Jesse Shelton, John Brown, and Squire Hutchins. Jesse Welton, a native of Virginia, but from Franklin county, Ohio, here bought a \"squatter's\" improvement in 1840, on sec. seven, north of Richland creek; he moved on this tract in October, 1842. The following November he took sick and died. He left a family of six children, three of whom now live in the county, viz.: - John Welton, Mrs. Lucinda Reed, and Mrs. Mary Miller.\n\nF. Shumard and _______ Lilly were the first settlers in the vicinity of Stewardson. The began improvements here in 1855. Shumard settled the west half of section three, and Lilly located on section thirty-three.\n\nM.B. Williams was the first settler on the head of Brush creek. His father, J.B. Williams, improved a place east of Mode, in 1839. He was from Ohio. Here M.B. Williams settled, where he now lives, in the summer of 1856. At that time there were no sett lements within two and a half or three miles. He raised the first two crops before fencing the farm. After that time stock became troublesome, and he fenced his place in 1858.\n\nJosiah Huffer settled in the edge of the timber, south side of Brush creek, on section 30, in 1852 or '53.\n\nJ.J. Elam located where he now lives, on section 25, in 1860. Nathan Elam, his father, came to the county in 1834, from Maury county, Tennessee, and for a time lived near Shelbyville. In 1845 he moved to Big Spring township, where he died in 1864.\n\nDead Man's Grove, on Wolf creek, section 8, in the south part of the township, received its name from the following circumstances: About forty-two years ago the skeleton of a man was found on the east side of the grove, a short distance south of Wolf cre ek. The man had undoubtedly been killed for the purpose of robbing him; for when found by a party of hunters, a hole in the skull showed where the bullet had done its deadly work. His clothes were intact, but the flesh had entirely disappeared from the bones. The coroner's jury, after their examination, buried the remains in a shallow grave near where they were found. The clothes of the murdered man were taken to Shelbyville, and there subsequently identified by his wife, who had come on from Ohio to obtain some trace of her missing husband, who was a man of considerable means, and was traveling through this country with the intention of purchasing\n\nPage 309\n\nland, and at the time of his death had a large amount of money concealed in a belt upon his person. The murderer, or murderers, in their haste ripped open his clothes and secured the belt, but overlooked a wallet containing several dollars in his pants' pocket. The coroner's jury expressed the opinion that the man had been killed in the early part of 1838-9, and his remains were not discovered until the fall of the following year.\n\nThe town of Stewardson, situated on the Wabash, St. Louis, and Pacific railroad, is built on section 34, on nice rolling ground, at the head waters of Wolf creek, and contains a population of about seven hundred. The town was laid off by William Stewards on, Jr., January, 1874. At the time Stewardson laid off this town he owned nearly 3,000 acres in the vicinity. Shafer, Turner & Baldwin erected the first business house, and put in a stock of hardware in 1874. The next business house was built by Fagan & Pfluger. They opened with a stock of general merchandize. The same year Jacob Leader erected a hotel, which is now used as a private residence. Knox & Jordan built the same year, and put in a stock of drugs. Knox here kept the first post-office. N oah Hostter built one among the first houses; he sold furniture, and was the first undertaker in Stewardson. His house stood in the south-west part of the town. Jacob Leader put up a livery stable in 1874.\n\nJ.D. Wilson kept the first livery stable, in 1876, which is still in operation. The flouring mill was erected in 1874, by Stewardson, Wilhelm & Douthit, now operated by John Frankboner. The mill has two run of burrs, and does a good business. The town built up rapidly in the years 1874, '75, '76, and buildings are still being erected annually. There are two church buildings, Baptist and Methodist, and a graded school in the place.
