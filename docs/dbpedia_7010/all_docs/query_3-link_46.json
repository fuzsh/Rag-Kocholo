        "text": "September 9, 2022\n\nT\n\noday’s issue is the first of a monthlong series that will highlight the sponsors of the FFI Global Conference in October. We begin with the conference academic host, MIT Sloan School of Management.\n\nAcademic Host\n\nMIT Sloan School of Management\n\nMIT Sloan is where smart, independent leaders come together, confident that the world should and can be better. MIT Sloan transforms confidence into ability, channeling determination and drive toward bold action and impact.\n\nMIT Sloan School of Management is academic host of the 2022 FFI Global Conference, “Family Enterprise and the Fourth Economy: Internal and External Pressures to Change and Adapt,” with MIT and MIT Sloan faculty as conference presenters. The conference sessions will cover Changing Family Dynamics, Future of Work, Societal Trends, and Environmental Sustainability.\n\nOPENING RECEPTION AT THE MIT MUSEUM: WEDNESDAY\n\nThe MIT Museum—adjacent to Boston Marriott Cambridge—re-opens on October 2 in the recently realized Kendall Gateway to MIT. Housed in a new building in purposely-built space, the museum serves as an interface between MIT and the wider world, while offering a comfortable environment to participate in discovery and debate the issues of our times.\n\nGalleries display highlights of past and ongoing research at MIT, objects from the museum’s vast collection, as well as investigations of a wide range of topics. The museum also features a state-of-the-art maker space and learning labs offering visitors a hands-on chance to tinker and create.\n\nPeter Hirst, MIT Senior Associate Dean of Executive Education, and John Davis will deliver opening remarks.\n\nMIT KEYNOTES: THURSDAY AND FRIDAY\n\nThe keynote speakers for this year’s conference come from across MIT, with diverse perspectives on the changing landscape of family enterprise and the skills that practitioners will need for the future.\n\nThursday Morning\n\nOpening Keynote: John Davis\n\nJohn Davis\n\nMIT Sloan School of Management\n\nCFEG\n\n2022 Conference Program Chair\n\nChanging Family Demographics: The aging of the world’s populations and other demographic trends have profound implications for multi-generational family enterprises, advisors, and researchers. What demographic changes and changes in family dynamics and culture are clients experiencing? How can practitioners help them build family unity in this new era?\n\nThursday Afternoon\n\nKeynote: The Future of Work: How humans, AI, and robots collaborate in the 21st century organization\n\nJulie Shah\n\nDirector, Interactive Robotics Group\n\nThomas Malone\n\nDirector, MIT Center for Collective Intelligence\n\nFuture of Work: As digitization, AI, automation, and robotics are transforming the workplace, how will work get done over the coming years? How will work be influenced by core family enterprise concerns and considerations, such as generational and social shifts? What new skills and understandings do families and family firms need to build in this new era?\n\nFriday Morning\n\nKeynote: Societal Trends\n\nStephanie Woerner\n\nPrincipal Research Scientist, MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research\n\nSocietal Trends: During the next decade, researchers are anticipating increasing dissatisfaction in society, even in advanced economies. For the past several decades, global prosperity and standards of living have increased, while at the same time income, wealth, and education inequality have risen. As relevant economic actors in all countries, family enterprises will need to find ways to navigate the challenges, opportunities, and dilemmas that will be posed by key societal trends.\n\nFriday Afternoon\n\nKeynote: Creating Climate Futures: Business in a changing world\n\nJason Jay\n\nDirector, MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability: Societies, industries (and their supply chains), companies, and families are suffering from the destabilizing effects of climate change that include flooding and water shortages, violent weather patterns, air and water pollution, and physical risks that individuals endure from environmental degradation. Governments and others are ramping up efforts to create a sustainable economy and to limit pollution from businesses and households. Researchers are producing promising new technologies. Entrepreneurs are building significant wealth through new approaches to doing business. Can these combined efforts save us from life-altering changes? In any case, we need to understand how to guide family enterprises in this new era.\n\nPOST-CONFERENCE: SATURDAY\n\nInternal and External Pressure to Change and Adapt: How to apply the lessons of the conference\n\nFollowing upon the ideas generated in the main FFI Global conference on October 27 and 28, this post-conference day will focus on the implications of the Fourth Economy for advisors and researchers in the field. Limited to 100 registrants, the day will be organized around the four segments discussed in the main conference. Attendees must be registered for the main conference to be eligible to attend.\n\nThe post-conference will feature John Davis, 2022 Conference Program Chair, and Mark Stevenson, FFI Futurenaut-in-Residence, and will be held at the MIT Samberg Conference Center.\n\nA Sincere Thank You to the 2022 Conference Sponsors\n\nAlliance Bernstein\n\nPatricia Annino\n\nBallentine Partners, LLC\n\nBanyanGlobal\n\nBurns & Levinson\n\nCambridge Family Enterprise Group\n\nCFAR\n\nFiduciary Wealth Partners\n\nFidelity Family Office Services\n\nFFI Board of Directors\n\nFFI Iberoamérica Virtual Study Group\n\nGreen Associates, LLC\n\nHemenway & Barnes\n\nMIT Sloan School of Management\n\nSterling Resources, Ltd.\n\nTrusted Family\n\nTwenty Second Consulting, LLC\n\nDon’t miss these two opportunities to continue your professional education through FFI’s online educational programs this fall!\n\nTuesday, September 20 AND Wednesday, September 21 (8AM-12PM ET)\n\nTwo half-day virtual seminars\n\nPhilanthropy, Investing and the Enterprise: Advising families in pursuit of impact\n\nTuesday, October 11 AND Wednesday, October 12 (8AM-12PM ET)\n\nTwo half-day virtual seminars\n\nTools for Positive Change in Family Enterprise Systems: Analysis and application\n\nThe 2022 Global Conference is October 26 – 29!\n\nHOTEL RESERVATIONS ARE LIMITED!
