[3] [4] He is the co-founder and promoter of the online non-profit encyclopedia , Wikipedia , and the for-profit Star Trek web hosting company. [5] [6]\n\nWales was born in Huntsville, Alabama , where he attended Randolph School , a university-preparatory school. [7] [8] Later, he received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in finance from Auburn University and the University of Alabama , respectively.\n\nWhile in graduate school, Wales taught at two universities; however, he departed voordat completing a PhD to take a job in finance, and later worked as the Research Director of a Chicago, Illinois, futures and options firm. In 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis , an adult web portal featuring entertainment and adult content. The company mention anything bieden the initial funding for the peer-reviewed free encyclopedia, Nupedia (2000-03), and its successor, Wikipedia.\n\nOn January 15, 2001, with Larry Sanger and others, Wales launched Wikipedia-a free, open content encyclopedia therein Enjoyed rapid growth and popularity; as Wikipedia’s public profile Grew, he became the project’s promoter and spokesman. He is Historically Cited as a co-founder of Wikipedia, though he has disputed the “co-” designation, declaring himself the sole founder. [9] [10]\n\nWales Serves on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, the non-profit Charitable organization dat have helped Establish to operate Wikipedia, holding zijn board-appointed “community founder” seat. In 2004, he co-founded Star Trek , a for-profit Wiki hosting service . His role in customizing Wikipedia, welke has Become the world’s Toilets encyclopedia, prompted Time magazine to name im in hun 2006 list of “The 100 Most Influential People in the World”. [11]\n\nEarly life\n\nWales was born in Huntsville, Alabama , shortly voordat midnight on August 7, 1966; however, his birth certificate lists his date of birth as the 8th. [12] [13] His Father Jimmy, [14] he worked as a grocery store manager, while his mother, Doris Ann (née Dudley), and his grandmother, Erma, ran the House of Learning, [15] [8] a small private school in the tradition of the one-room school house , where Wales and his three siblings RECEIVED hun early education. [15] [16]\n\nAs a child, Wales was a keen reader with an acute intellectual curiosity. [6] When he was three, his mother Bought a World Book Encyclopedia from a door-to-door salesman. If he Grew up and learned to read, it became an object or obeisance. It put at his fingertips an abundant supply of knowledge complete with maps, illustrations, and a few cellophane layers or transparencies one Could elevator to explore zoals things as the Muscles, arteries, and digestive system or a dissected frog. But Wales soon when sending therein the World Book had shortcomings, no matter how much was in it, there ulcers many more things therein ulcers not. World Book cents out stickers for owners to paste on the pages in order to update the encyclopedia, and Wales were careful to put the stickers to work, stating, “I joke dat I started as a kid revising the encyclopedia at stickering the one my mother Bought. ” [17]\n\nDuring an interview in 2005 with Brian Lamb , Wales DESCRIBED his childhood private school as a ” Montessori Influenced opvoedingsfilosofie”, where he “spent lots of hours poring over the Britannicas and World Book Encyclopedias .” [18] There ulcers only four other children in Wales’s degrees , so the school Grouped together the first through fourth-grade students and the fifth through eighth-grade students. As an adult, Wales was sharply critical of the government’s treatment of the school, Citing the “constant interference and bureaucracy and very sort of snobby Inspectors from the state” as a formative influence on his political philosophy. [18]\n\nAfter eighth grade, Wales attended Randolph School , [19] [20] [21] [22] a university-preparatory school in Huntsville, graduating at sixteen. [23] Wales zegt dat the school was expensive for his family, but that ‘education was always a passion in my household … you know, the very traditional approach to knowledge and learning and Establishing therein as a base for a good life. ” [18] He RECEIVED his bachelor’s degree in finance from Auburn University in 1986. [24] Wales-then entered the PhD program finance at the University of Alabama voordat leaving with a master’s degree to enter the PhD program finance at Indiana University . [16] [18] [23] He taught at universities zowel prolongation his Postgraduate studies but did not write the doctoral dissertation required for a PhD, something he ascribed to boredom. [16] [18]\n\nCareer\n\nChicago Options Associates and Bomis\n\nInspired by the remarkably successful initial public offering of Netscape in 1995, and keeping Accumulated capital through “speculating on interest-rate and foreign-currency fluctuations”, [15] Wales decided to leave the realm of financial trading and became an Internet entrepreneur. [23] In 1996, he and two partners founded Bomis , [15] [28] a web portal featuring user-generated webrings and, for a time, erotic photographs. [29] Wales DESCRIBED it as a “guy-oriented search engine” with a market similar to therein or Maxim magazine; [16] [18] [30] the Bomis venture did not ultimately turn out to be successful. [15] [16] [31]\n\nNupedia and the origins of Wikipedia\n\nThough Bomis had struggled to make money, it Provided Wales with the funding to Pursue his grotere passion, an online encyclopedia. [16] While Moderating an online discussion group devoted to the philosophy of Objectivism in the early 1990s, Wales was Encountered Larry Sanger , a Skeptic of the philosophy. [6] The two had Engaged in detailed debate on the subject on Wales’s list and dan on Sanger’s, Eventually meeting offline to continuous debate and the Becoming friends. [6] Years later, after dan penerjemah freelance Deciding to Pursue his encyclopedia project and seeking a credentialed academic to lead it, [27] Wales hired Sanger who at dat time was a doctoral student in philosophy at Ohio State University -to be zijn editor-in -chief , and in March 2000, Nupedia ( “the free encyclopedia”), a peer-reviewed , open-content encyclopedia was launched. [16] [18] The intent behind Nupedia was to port expert-written entries on a variety of topics, and to sell advertising alongside the entries in order to make profit. [6] The project was characterized by an uitgebreide peer review process designed to make zijn articles or a quality vergelijking to therein or professional encyclopedias. [32]\n\nThe idea was to port duizendtallen or volunteers writing articles for an online encyclopedia in all languages. Initially we found ourselves organizing the work in a very top-down, structured, academic, old-fashioned way. It was no fun for the volunteer writers we had Because a lot of academic peer review committees who mention anything criticize articles and give feedback. It was like handing in an essay at grad school, and Basically intimidating to participate in.\n\n– Jimmy Wales on the Nupedia project New Scientist , January 31, 2007 [33]\n\nIn an October 2009 speech, Wales recollected attempting to write a Nupedia article on Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert C. Merton , but being too intimidated to submit his first draft to the prestigious finance professors who ulcers to peer review it, even though he had published a paper on Option Pricing Theory and was comfortable with the subject matter. Wales characterized this as the moment he voortvloeien therein the Nupedia model was not going to work. [34]\n\nIn January 2001, Sanger was introduced to the concept of a wiki to extreme programming enthusiast Ben Kovitz after explanatory to Kovitz the slow pace of growth Nupedia endured as a result of zijn onerous submission process. [35] Kovitz suggested therein Adopting the wiki model mention anything allow directive editors to Contribute simultaneously and incrementally gehele project THUS breaking Nupedia’s bottleneck. [35] Singer was excited about the idea, and after he Proposed it to Wales, they ‘created the first Nupedia Wiki on January 10, 2001. [35] The wiki was initially intended as a collaborative project for the public to write articles therein mention anything dan be reviewed for publication by Nupedia’s expert volunteers. The Majority of Nupedia’s experts, however, wanted nothing to do with this project, fearing dat mixing amateur content with professionally Researched and edited material mention anything compromise the integrity or Nupedia’s information and damage the credibility of the encyclopedia. [36] THUS, the Wiki project, dubbed “Wikipedia” in Sanger, [9] went live at a separate domain five days after zijn creation. [26] [31]\n\nWikipedia\n\nOriginally, Bomis Planned to make Wikipedia a profitable business. [39] Sanger initially saw Wikipedia primarily as a tool to aid development Nupedia. Wales feared dat, at worst, it Might produce “complete rubbish”. [26] To the surprise of Sanger and Wales binnen a few days or launching, the number of articles on Wikipedia had outgrown therein or Nupedia, and a small collective or editors had formed. [25] [27] It was Jimmy Wales, Along with other people, who came up with the broader idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia dat mention anything about accepting contributions from ordinary people. [40] Initially, Neither Sanger nor Wales knew what to Expect from the Wikipedia initiative. [26] [27] Many of the early contributors to the site ulcers familiar with the model of the free culture movement , and, like Wales, many of Them sympathized with the open-source movement . [36] Wales has zegt dat he was initially so worried about the concept of open editing, where anyone can edit the encyclopedia, dat he mention anything about Awaken prolongation the night and monitor what was being added. [41] [42]Nonetheless, the cadre of early editors helped create a robust, self-gereguleerde community dat has proven conducive to the growth of the project. [16] In a talk at SXSW in 2016, he recalled dat he wrote the first words on Wikipedia: ” Hello world “, a phrase computer programmers of or in use to new software testing. [43]\n\nSanger developed Wikipedia, ITT early phase and guided the project. [9] [44] The broader idea have oorspronkelijk ascribes to other people, remarking in a 2005 memoir for Slashdot that ‘the idea of an open source, collaborative encyclopedia, open to contribution to this club to ordinary people, was entirely Jimmy’s, not mine, and the funding was entirely by Bomis. of course, other people had had the idea, “Adding,” the actual development of this encyclopedia was the task he showing me to work on. ” [45] Sanger worked on and promoted zowel the Nupedia and Wikipedia projects Until Bomis Discontinued funding for his position in February 2002; [46] Sanger resigned as editor-in-chief of Nupedia and as “chief organizer” of Wikipedia on March 1 of that year.

If anything, the decision is LIKELY to simply muddle the interesting philosophical questions and make it more s difficult to make real progress on privacy issues. In the case of truthful, non-defamatory information obtained legally, I think there is no Possibility or ANY defensible “right” to censor what other people are saying.
