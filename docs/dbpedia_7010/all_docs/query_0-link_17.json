Together with Larry Sanger, Wales founded Wikipedia, an encyclopedia based on the concept wiki and the model of free software.\n\n3. Wales is the President of Wikimedia foundation, situated in San Francisco. In an interview made on 2004, Wales explained his motivations to create Wikipedia saying: “ Imagine a world in which every person had free access to the sum of the whole human knowledge. This is what we are doing.”\n\n4. The 4th of November 2009 the Nokia Foundation gave their annual award to Jimmy Wales &quot; For his contributions to the evolution of the World Wide Web as a participatory and democratic platform “ The 14th October 2010, he received the keys of the City of Tijuana for his conference on the event called innovating Tijuana, carried out in this city. Wales is member of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School and the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, the Board of Directors at Creative Commons, Socialtext, and Hunch.com, and former co-chair of the World Economic Forum on the Middle East 2008.

Wikipedia is a free, web-based, collaborative, multilingual encyclopedia project supported by the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. Its 18 million articles (over 3.6 million in English) have been written collaboratively by volunteers around the world, and almost all of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the site. Wikipedia was launched in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger and has become the largest and most popular general reference work on the Internet, ranking around seventh among all websites on Alexa and having 365 million readers. The name Wikipedia was coined by Larry Sanger and is a portmanteau of wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning &quot;quick&quot;) and encyclopaedia.\n\n8. Wikipedia first was a complementary of Nupedia; Nupedia is an English encyclopaedia that was written by experts. Nupedia was founded in 2000. Jimmy Wales was one of the most important people in Nupedia before starting the project of Wikipedia. Nupedia at the start had the Nupedia Open Content License but also before starting the Wikipedia it changed to the GNU Free Documentation License by Richard Stallman. History\n\n9. Wikipedia is an open editing model, all the people that have an account in Wikipedia can change all the articles except some very prone to vandalism; Also someone that has an account can create a new article, but this article isn’t a property of the creator, it is the property of all the people that visit Wikipedia. It is important that the new articles are available to visit at the moment when they are created, nobody checks the new articles. The German and Hungarian versions are a little bit different because they have a system to keep the articles clean. It contains a memory of the old articles if the readers want to have a look at them."
