Perplexity, the \"AI-powered Swiss Army Knife for information discovery and curiosity\", recently raised $73.6M at a $520M valuation, bringing total funding to over $100M. Jeff Bezos, the founder of @Amazon and one of the richest people in the world, is one of the investors participating in Perplexity AI's latest $73.6 million funding round. Founded in 2022, Perplexity competes with search giants like Google and Microsoft by trying to reinvent AI search from the ground up. If tools like Perplexity succeed, will the era of \"Googling\" crumble as students increasingly use AI engines instead? With all that said, AI-powered search drove @Microsoft's Bing Chat - now rebranded as Co-pilot - but only has about 3% of the search market, while Google maintains a hold on a chunky 90% slice. Google developed a Labs experiment called Search Generative Experience (SGE), which uses AI-generated summaries, sources, and follow-up questions to enhance search results. But I have yet to get access. All of this got me thinking about not only my information-searching habits but also how we might see students slowly turn away from Google's page of links. What do you think? Have your search habits changed? https://lnkd.in/egCtK5A2 #ai #aiforeducation #promptcraft .: :. Are you keen for more?
