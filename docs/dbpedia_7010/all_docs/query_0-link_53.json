        "text": "From the Brownstone Institute\n\nBy Peter St Onge\n\nUnlike the previous recessions, Canada is not recovering this time. Something broke.\n\nCanada’s standard of living is on track for its worst decline in 40 years, according to a new study by Canada’s Fraser Institute.\n\nThe study compared the three worst periods of decline in Canada in the last 40 years – the 1989 recession, the 2008 global financial crisis, and this post-pandemic era.\n\nThey found that, unlike the previous recessions, Canada is not recovering this time. Something broke.\n\nIn fact, according to the Financial Post, since 2019 Canada’s had the worst growth out of 50 developed economies. Inflation-adjusted Canadian wages have been flat since 2016.\n\nSo, yes, something broke.\n\nAnd it’s nowhere near over: Canada’s per-person real GDP is still falling and with a looming US recession – the US is 75% of Canada’s exports – Canada could crash again before it ever recovered.\n\nTrudeau’s Canada in Decline\n\nIn previous videos, I’ve talked about the disaster that is Justin Trudeau’s Canada. In short, incomes are West Virginia-level, house prices are at the Los Angeles level, and Canadian taxes are halfway to the Soviet Union.\n\nIt’s not rare for a middle-class family in Canada to pay half their income in taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, since the pandemic, Canada’s official food inflation is up 25%, and energy is up 30% – partly thanks to a carbon tax.\n\nAnd keep in mind sales tax in most Canadian provinces is 13 to 15 percent on everything you buy.\n\nWhile Canadians post TikToks about trying to stretch a loaf of rye bread through the week or selling off their possessions to afford groceries, the cost of living is hitting harder with time.\n\nCanadian bankruptcy filings jumped 40% last year, while CIBC reports nearly half of Canadians have zero emergency savings.\n\nAccording to StatsCan Canada’s violent crime rate is up 40% since 2014.\n\nAn Ipsos poll found 7 in 10 Canadians agree that “Canada is broken” – rising to 8 in 10 of those between age 18 and 34.\n\nAngus found fully 42% of Canadians are considering moving to another country.\n\nWhat Changed\n\nThis is all a shock because it happened so fast – it’s night and day from the last crisis in 2008, which Canada weathered much better than America.\n\nWhat changed? Justin Trudeau. Specifically, his campaign to convert Canada from a mixed economy like the US into a government-dominated economy like the sick men of the European Union.\n\nUnder Trudeau, business investment has plunged by a third. While government spending nearly doubled to almost half of GDP.\n\nGovernment workers in Canada are growing almost four times faster than the private sector, and one in three Canadians now work for the government, raking in 30% more in salary and benefits than the taxpayers they lord over. Another 1.7 million Canadians – roughly 1 in 10 households – are on welfare.\n\nOf course, that makes it very difficult to win an election in Canada on a small-government platform: You’re up against the government-provided livelihoods of 40% of voters. Meaning you’ve got to win, what, 80% of everybody else.\n\nWhat’s Next\n\nNear-term things will get worse because Canadians are stuck with Trudeau through the next election in 2025.\n\nConservative Pierre Poilievre is ahead in the polls for now, but Canada’s government-funded media is doing everything they can to destroy him so the lead’s already narrowing.\n\nThat means more inflation, more decline, more mass migration, and rising crime in what was once a paradise.\n\nRepublished from the author’s Substack\n\nAuthor\n\nPeter is an economist, a Fellow at the Mises Institute, and a former MBA professor.\n\nFrom the Brownstone Institute\n\nBy\n\nAmassive attack on civil liberties is underway in the wake of a week of rioting in the UK. For politicians, the media, NGOs, and academics our old friend “misinformation” shares a large portion of the blame. It is the excuse that keeps on giving.\n\n“Fake news sparks riots,” “Misinformation fuels riots,” “Misinformation Stoked Anti-Migrant Riots,” Protests “sparked by misinformation,” “Disinformation fuelling the UK far-right riots,” “How false claims about a mass stabbing led to a riot,” How disinformation spread to start a riot,” and “UK riots spurred by misinformation.” There are literally hundreds of articles of this type, seemingly extracted from the laziest of ChatGPT prompts.\n\nThe UK is talking of arresting and even extraditing people from other countries for misinformation. “You may be committing a crime if you repost, repeat or amplify a message which is false,” said UK Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson. There are calls to expand the already regressive online safety bill and facial recognition, and the Counter Disinformation Unit, which targeted legitimate dissent during Covid, is being rebooted to monitor social media.\n\nMisinformation was spread, particularly in the days when the name of the teenager charged with murdering the three young girls was withheld as per UK law. Once the identity of the alleged attacker was known (a British citizen born of Rwandan parents) the riots in no way abated. It was all fuel for the anti-immigration movement. The people leading the rioting weren’t information connoisseurs; they needed just enough true information to connect to real concerns. Tinderbox Britain did the rest.\n\nIt is quaint to think that had accurate information about the attacker been immediately known there would have been no viral outrage and protest. Information can direct where energy flows, but the energy and tension were long there. If it hadn’t been this event it would have been another soon enough.\n\nIf the roots and shoots of a society are green and healthy a spark thrown it is unlikely to do much damage. If the forest is dry you don’t need a bolt of lightning (real or imagined): a hot summer day is enough for combustion.\n\nIndeed, despite a massive ramping up of progressive anti-racist and pro-immigration campaigns in the past decade, the UK appears to be more racist and anti-immigration than ever. Not only have anti-racism campaigns failed, but the all-stick-no-carrot approach of the last decade arguably exacerbated tensions.\n\nThe purpose of blaming “misinformation” is that it deflects from the real issue: a great many Britons are not happy with the scale and results of immigration. According to Wikipedia, a record 1.26 million people arrived in 2022, and recent polls say just 9% of Britons are satisfied with the way the UK government is dealing with immigration.\n\nYou may decide that xenophobia and racism are the real causes of the unrest and that there is no legitimate criticism (even of the peaceable and democratic kind) to be had of migration and integration. That however does not change the fact that British society is deeply fractured. Do you put everything down to perception and continue with the same policies regardless? No matter how much you suppress and nudge you’ll get the same outcome or worse without real material change, especially as economic conditions likely worsen.\n\nThe “misinformation” excuse just kicks the can down the road, and failing to have difficult conversations leaves the terrain open to the extremes. It was always magical to think that papering over such huge issues would work for any serious length of time. As Joe Biden found out recently, you can bend reality to your will for only so long. If there is an information culprit, it is the shutting down of conversation on difficult issues.\n\nFact-checkers and NGO workers are overwhelmingly of the post-modern progressive variety and generally supporters of large-scale immigration. For them too, the fault must not be laid at the scope and scale of existing policy. I have often tried to explain to my progressive friends that large-scale migration is a capitalist program, not an anti-racist one. But this progressive shift fits the broader one where progressives now largely support corporate and government authoritarianism, from Big Pharma to border closures.\n\nAt the same time, people like X CEO Elon Musk are not helping. Musk amplified an undeniably fake news story and is heightening tensions more broadly. Some adults in the room would be really handy right now.\n\nMisinformation is new “the dog ate my homework” for politicians and the media class. The only real solution is hard and deeply uncomfortable conversations. Repress the conversation and you amplify the fringe. Creating sustainable policy solutions requires holding the conversation at the center, and not dismissing everything inconvenient as “misinformation.” The alternative is social Balkanisation and expanding authoritarianism.\n\nThe repressed always returns, and it is usually ugly.\n\nRepublished from the author’s Substack\n\nAuthor\n\nAndrew Lowenthal is a Brownstone Institute fellow, journalist, and the founder and CEO of liber-net, a digital civil liberties initiative. He was co-founder and Executive Director of the Asia-Pacific digital rights non-profit EngageMedia for almost eighteen years, and a fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society and MIT’s Open Documentary Lab.\n\nFrom the Brownstone Institute\n\nBy\n\nThe official story circulating on BBC and echoed by government and police spokespersons is that the riots and unrest seen in the UK in recent weeks are the product of a tiny minority of “far-right” hooligans and criminals, egged on by “disinformation” about the circumstances of the awful murder of innocent children in Southport, in particular the identity of the 17-year-old assailant, who was initially alleged to be a Muslim refugee, and later turned out to be a Welsh-born citizen born to Rwandan parents. This official story is not, strictly speaking, false. But it is only half the story.\n\nThe race riots, street violence, and public unrest we have seen in recent weeks have complex underlying causes and are not susceptible to any simple, one-dimensional explanation. Yet in their eagerness to condemn “far-right” rioters and looters, many public commentators omit to mention that the visceral anger of the rioters is really just an extreme and unlawful expression of the anger and frustration of many ordinary, law-abiding citizens, whose concerns about immigration and its impact on their communities are usually either ignored or blithely dismissed as “disinformation” or “far-right” propaganda.\n\nDon’t get me wrong: I’m not suggesting for a second that it is in any way justified to hurl rocks at a mosque, injure police officers, set refugee accommodation centres on fire, engage in disorderly conduct, or intimidate people of other religions or ethnicities. I’m not suggesting for a second that anti-immigrant violence should be tolerated or encouraged.\n\nBut I would suggest that the condemnation of “far-right” agitation and violence should not lead us to overlook the broader societal discontent and fragmentation that such violence emerges from. Our condemnation of far-right violence should not be allowed to blind us to the fact that a very large proportion of citizens who express disquiet over immigration policy, or attend public rallies to raise awareness of their concerns, are not violent thugs, or “far-right” agitators; just regular, law-abiding citizens who are worried about how poorly controlled immigration will impact their access to housing and public services, or the safety of their streets, or the cohesion and prosperity of their neighbourhoods.\n\nIf deep discontent with the UK’s immigration policy was restricted to “far-right” hooligans, we could not explain the remarkable success of the Brexit movement, one of whose primary selling points was its opposition to “mass immigration,” which saw through a successful Brexit referendum in 2016. Nor could we explain the fact that in the 2024 elections, Nigel Farage’s Reform Party, with its call for stricter controls on immigration, managed to win 15% of the popular vote, in a first-past-the-post system in which many of the Reform voters knew they were likely handing the election to Labour.\n\nOf course, it is psychologically comforting to blame a social problem on a single scapegoat. It makes you feel more comfortable because the problem is contained and limited to whomever you have chosen to scapegoat – be it those pesky refugees, or the Muslims, or the Jews, or the conservative hillbillies, or the “Far Right.” But it may also be myopic, if the problem happens to be a complex one, with multiple underlying causes.\n\nThose who, in the face of growing unrest surrounding immigration and race, limit themselves to condemning far=right violence, are missing out on a golden opportunity to open a sophisticated public conversation about fragmented communities across the UK, about the real and perceived failures of immigration policy, and about the reasons why immigration remains such a “hot button issue” in towns and cities across Britain.\n\nPublic disquiet in the UK over immigration policy is real and goes far beyond “far-right” agitation. Even when that disquiet is not on the front pages of British newspapers, it continues to bubble under the surface, as some communities feel that their access to public services and housing, as well as the future of their way of life, are threatened by disproportionate levels of immigration, including illegal immigration.\n\nAccording to a 2023 analysis of professional opinion polls undertaken by the Migration Observatory, 37% of Britons believe immigration should be reduced “a lot,” and 15% believe it should be reduced “a little,” compared with 6% who believe it should be increased “a lot” and 8% who think it should be increased “a little.” In short, over half of the population believe there is too much immigration, while more than one in three believe there is far too much immigration.\n\nThe superficiality of the “official” British response to the unfolding unrest may come down to a sort of wishful thinking: if we just keep the focus on the “far right,” then we can just round up the culprits, pack our bags, and go home. After all, what politician or head of police wants to grasp the nettle of a racially charged issue like immigration, in a way that seriously engages with the demands of disgruntled citizens and communities?\n\nNevertheless, until public authorities and opinion leaders start to respectfully engage with citizens who believe illegal immigration is out of control, as well as communities that worry over the impact of immigration on social cohesion, housing, public services, and public finances, the disquiet and resentment will continue to brew. Sadly, we can expect more unrest and disorder if public authorities do not engage in a respectful way with citizens’ legitimate fears and concerns.\n\nRepublished from the author’s Substack\n\nAuthor\n\nDavid Thunder is a researcher and lecturer at the University of Navarra’s Institute for Culture and Society in Pamplona, Spain, and a recipient of the prestigious Ramón y Cajal research grant (2017-2021, extended through 2023), awarded by the Spanish government to support outstanding research activities.
