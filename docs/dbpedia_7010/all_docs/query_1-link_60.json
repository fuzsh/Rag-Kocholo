        "text": "§1 References\n\nMost of the sources used in this book are Web pages easily accessible to the reader. Because I cite many Wikimedia related pages, I elide some information from their preferred format for brevity: I use “Wikipedia” as the author and publisher, rather than “Wikipedia contributors” and “Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia” respectively. Given the large amount of grammatical and syntactical deviations online, and that some sources are not native English speakers, I mostly present quoted text verbatim, with minimal corrections or editorial caveats such as “[sic].” In the printed book I do not provide URLs for printed or easily locatable sources. For online sources, where available, the versioned URL (i.e., a “stable” or “permanent” link) is used. I sometimes reference different versions of the same wiki page or older versions so as to provide a historical source, for comparison, or because I noted text that might have been subsequently edited — wikis do change — but I expect that its spirit remains the same.\n\nHowever, I recommend consulting the online bibliography where I include hypertextual references whenever possible, including for printed sources now online. This is common for recent works, sometimes as preprints or author’s copies, and for older works in the public domain; I use the publication date of the version I used. For older works, if necessary, I often mention the original publication date. Page numbers might refer to the original pagination or to an online printout; I hope it will be clear to the reader which is the case.\n\n§2 Notes\n\nChapter 1\n\n1 AndyL, “Neo-Nazis Attempt to Stack Wikivote on Jewish,” wikien-l, February 6, 2005, http://marc.info/?i=BE2BEA7C.4E78%andyl2004@sympatico.ca (accessed February 6, 2005) .\n\n2 AndyL, “A Neo-Nazi Wikipedia,” wikien-l, August 19, 2005, http://marc.info/?i=20050819221529.ZQFS2134.tomts48-srv.bellnexxia.net@[209.226.175.82] (visited on August 23, 2005) .\n\n3 Mike Godwin, “Meme, Counter-Meme,” Wired 2, number 10 (October 1994), http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/godwin.if_pr.html (visited on August 24, 2006) .\n\n4 Wikipedia, “User:Raul654/Raul’s Laws,” Wikipedia, July 10, 2009, http://en.wikipedia.org/?oldid=301373968 (visited on July 20, 2009) .\n\n5 Jimmy Wales, “Re: A Neo-Nazi Wikipedia,” wikien-l, August 23, 2005, http://marc.info/?i=430B6975.9040906@wikia.com (visited on August 23, 2005) .\n\n6 Wikipedia, “Wikipedia:Etiquette,” Wikipedia, October 23, 2008, http://en.wikipedia.org/?oldid=247072399 (visited on November 3, 2008) ; Wikipedia, “Wikipedia:Assume Good Faith,” Wikipedia, November 1, 2008, http://en.wikipedia.org/?oldid=248943513 (visited on November 3, 2008) ; Wikipedia, “Wikipedia:Please Do Not Bite the Newcomers,” Wikipedia, October 16, 2008, http://en.wikipedia.org/?oldid=245559838 (visited on November 3, 2008) .\n\n7 Wikimedia Foundation, “Vision,” Wikimedia, September 1, 2007, http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Vision (visited on June 5, 2008) .\n\n8 H.G.

(I present such sources mostly verbatim, with minimal corrections or editorial caveats such as “[sic],” and use names as provided, including idiosyncratic spellings.) These are roughly organized into sixty top level categories; those topics on which I spent significant time include subdivisions. So, for example, the “good faith” category includes the subcategories of: compassion, humor, patience, etc. Capturing, excerpting, annotating, and categorizing, these sources was facilitated by bibliographic tools, as described in Joseph Reagle, “Thunderdell and BusySponge,” January 2009, https://reagle.org/joseph/2009/01/thunderdell.html (visited on May 28, 2009) .\n\n46 John Van Maanen, Tales of the Field: on Writing Ethnography (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988), 1, 13 .\n\n47 Henry Jenkins, Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture (New York: Routledge, 1992), 7, http://books.google.com/books?id=71U9-cOx_ZwC (visited on May 2, 2005) .\n\n48 W.
