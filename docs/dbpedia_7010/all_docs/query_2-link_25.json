Wikipedia currently comprises some 36 million articles which are available free of charge in 280 languages.\n\nMcCann / Thiess Conferences, launched in 2015 by McCann Worldgroup Romania and Thiess Holding, is a know-how platform on issues of leadership, education, sport, and innovation.\n\nThe past speakers in this conference series have included Italian prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro and Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.\n\nWorld Wide Web inventor comes to Romania for conference\n\nIrina Popescu, irina.popescu@romania-insider.com\n\n(Photo source: Wikipedia)"
