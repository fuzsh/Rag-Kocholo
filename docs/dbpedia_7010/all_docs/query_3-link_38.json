Tor Jakob Ramsøy and Lars Thoresen will continue serving on the Board of Directors.\n\nNew Board Members\n\nStuart Morstead is currently COO and co-founder of Arundo Analytics.

He was a Senior Partner for 25 years, including time as leader of the Scandinavian Office; leader of the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region; leader of the Doha Office; and Chairman of the Directors Committee. During his time at McKinsey, he focused on clients in the global energy and materials sector and the public sector, with particular experience in corporate transformations. He holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and is based in Doha, Qatar.\n\n“I have been involved with Arundo since its earliest days, and I’ve seen its astounding growth over the last few years,” said Tore Myrholt. “I’m excited to become more actively involved and support the company’s strategies in energy and other heavy industries.”\n\n>Read more on Is cyber security still not a top boardroom priority?\n\nThomas Malone is the Patrick J. McGovern Professor at MIT Sloan School of Management and founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. He is also a Professor of Information Technology and a Professor of Work and Organizational Studies at MIT. Previously, he was the founder and director of the MIT Center for Coordination Science and one of the two founding co-directors of the MIT Initiative on “Inventing the Organizations of the 21st Century”.\n\nHe teaches classes on organisational design, information technology and leadership, and his research focuses on how new organisations can be designed to take advantage of the possibilities provided by information technology. With a Ph.D. from Stanford University, Malone has been a co-founder of four software companies and served on boards for several organisations. For Arundo, he will contribute from Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n“Technology is fundamentally changing how industry operates, and Arundo is at the forefront of this change in some of the biggest industries in the world,” said Thomas Malone. “As an entrepreneur and researcher in this area, I’m excited to help Arundo navigate and respond to dynamics of this once-in-a-generation opportunity.”"
