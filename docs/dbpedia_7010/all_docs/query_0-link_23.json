        "text": "JIMMY WALES\n\nFounder, Wikipedia\n\nU.S. Internet Entrepreneur and Wiki Pioneer\n\nOne of TIME Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People”\n\nWikipedia: Ranked Among the Top Ten Most-Visited Web Sites Worldwide\n\nRanked by Forbes Magazine as a “Web Celeb”\n\nJimmy Donal Wales is a U.S. Internet entrepreneur and wiki pioneer who is best known as the founder of Wikipedia, an international collaborative free content encyclopedia on the Internet, and the Wikimedia Foundation. He is co-founder of Wikia, a privately owned free web hosting service he set up in 2004.\n\nThe origins of Wikipedia began in March 2000, when Mr. Wales started Nupedia (“the free encyclopedia”), which was characterized by an extensive peer-review process designed to make its articles of a quality comparable to that of professional encyclopedias. With the addition of wikis (a collection of web pages designed to enable anyone who accesses it to contribute or modify content), the project was dubbed “Wikipedia.” Mr. Wales laid down the founding principles and content, establishing an Internet-based community of contributors during that year. Wikipedia was initially intended to be a wiki-based site for collaboration on early encyclopedic content for submission to Nupedia, but Wikipedia's rapid growth quickly overshadowed Nupedia's development.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with Slashdot, Mr. Wales explained his motivations about Wikipedia, “Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing.”\n\nThe success of the project has helped popularize a trend in web development (called Web 2.0) that aims to facilitate creativity, collaboration, and sharing among users. As Wikipedia expanded and its public profile grew, Mr. Wales took on the role of the project's spokesperson and promoter through speaking engagements and media appearances. His work with Wikipedia, which has become the world's largest encyclopedia, prompted TIME Magazine to name him one of its “100 Most Influential People,” in 2006 in the “Scientists & Thinkers” category.\n\nIn 2003, Mr. Wales founded the Wikimedia Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content, and to providing the full content of these wiki-based projects to the public free of charge. The Wikimedia Foundation operates some of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world, including Wikipedia, one of the 10 most visited websites in the world.\n\nIn 2004, Wales co-founded, with Angela Beesley, the for-profit company Wikia, Inc. Wikia is a wiki farm – a collection of individual wikis on different subjects, all hosted on the same website. As part of his work at Wikia, Inc., Mr. Wales is developing a human-powered search engine, Search Wikia, which will be based on the same open, transparent, community-driven principles of Wikia and Wikipedia.\n\nThe World Economic Forum recognized Wales as one of the “Young Global Leaders” of 2007. This prestigious award acknowledges the top 250 young leaders across the world for their professional accomplishments, their commitment to society, and their potential to contribute to shaping the future of the world.\n\nMr. Wales is a Fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School. He serves on the Board of Directors of Socialtext, a provider of wiki technology to businesses and the non-profit organization Creative Commons. Mr. Wales has received an honorary doctorate from Knox College of Illinois and was presented with a Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 2006.\n\nMr. Wales received his bachelor's degree in finance from Auburn University and started with the Ph.D. finance program at the University of Alabama, where he left with a Master's. After that, he took courses offered in the Ph.D. finance program at Indiana University. He taught at both universities during his postgraduate studies, but did not write the doctoral dissertation required to earn a Ph.D.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2000, Wales was the research director at Chicago Options Associates, a futures and options trading firm in Chicago.\n\nKAREN CATOR\n\nKaren Cator is the Director of the Office of Educational Technology at the U.S. Department of Education.

In this role, she focused on the intersection of education policy and research, emerging technologies, and the reality faced by teachers, students and administrators.\n\nCator joined Apple in 1997 from the public education sector, most recently leading technology planning and implementation in Juneau, Alaska. She also served as Special Assistant for Telecommunications for the Lieutenant Governor of Alaska. Cator holds a Masters in school administration from the University of Oregon and Bachelors in early childhood education from Springfield College.

At the same time, daily exposure to the web is creating a incredibly design-literate population. Could this be a new language?\n\nDavid will share his passion for exciting potential of this merging of design, information, text and story. And unveil some of the interesting, unexpected and sometimes magical things that happen when you visualise data, knowledge and ideas. And, admitting that his book is as full of mistakes as it is successes, he'll also explore some of the common pitfalls, traps and FAILS that dog this young design form. Using examples from his book and blog, he'll share thoughts on what makes a successful information visualisation and journalistic tips, especially for designers, on how to zero in on interesting data and subjects - and how designing information expose your own biases and change your views about the world.

More recently work has started on processing other forms of imaging, collaborating with the MRRC in the University of Cambridge to improve MRI imaging using probabilistic inference. The team also works on medical imaging, feeding image processing innovation into the Microsoft Amalga family of Enterprise Health Systems. Most recently they have built the machine learning technology inside the Xbox Kinect human motion tracking system.\n\nKATHARINE BIRBALSINGH\n\nKatharine Birbalsingh is the teacher who spoke out at the Conservative Party conference and then found herself out of job. She has held senior leadership roles for over a decade in inner-city schools in London. She has always chosen to work in the inner city because it presents the most demanding of challenges and she enjoys the satisfaction of conquering difficulties that have dumbfounded others.\n\nHaving spent years transforming the lives of children and revitalising leadership in schools, she recently shook up the debate around education in this country at great cost to herself. Katharine lost her job, found herself thrown into the lion’s den and came out fighting on top. She is able to inspire others because she knows how to get the most out of the power of belief. As an MP recently said about her, ‘Katharine has managed to inspire many a politician because she has reminded us of what it is to believe in something’.\n\nUsing her skills as an “outstanding” teacher, Katharine has turned around many “unteachable” classes and failing departments. She has also inspired entire staff teams to take on board behaviours and thought patterns to which they were fundamentally opposed, thereby creating sustainable change and leading to whole school success. Change for the better is what Katharine does best.\n\nBorn in New Zealand to West Indian parents, Katharine Birbalsingh grew up in Canada. She has lived and worked all over the world, including Nigeria, France and South Africa. Her extensive travelling and studying of school systems throughout America, Europe, Brazil and Asia give her a world view. She read French and Philosophy at Oxford University.\n\nShe writes regularly for The Telegraph and Standpoint magazine.\n\nKatharine’s book To Miss with Love comes out in April 2011.\n\nANNIKA SMALL\n\nAnnika is passionate about the power of the internet to improve lives and communities.

He is universally acknowledged as one of the games industry’s technical innovators.\n\nA graduate of Cambridge University, Alex got his first taste of the software industry working at Bullfrog Productions during his holidays. On graduating he joined Lionhead Studios full time and fast became a key member of the team, developing cutting-edge graphics technology for titles such as Black & White, Black & White 2, The Movies and The Room. His R&D work led to his invitation into Microsoft’s exclusive “Graphics Arbitration Board\", a small group of top developers who help shape the future of 3D graphics on the PC. By night Alex turns his creativity to a more musical direction and his visuals and films have been shown around the world, most notably, on tour with Warp Records and the London Sinfonietta.\n\nAlex's technical contributions to the cult PC internet game Live For Speed and Mark Healey's Rag Doll Kung Fu, along with his longstanding links with the demo scene (where he is known as Bluespoon) inspired him to develop games in a small and highly creative environment. In 2006 Alex co-founded Media Molecule with the Rag Doll Kung Fu collaborators Mark Healey, Dave Smith and Kareem Ettouney.\n\nMedia Molecule\n\nKAREEM ETTOUNEY\n\nI was born on the 5th of June 1975 in Dundee, we moved back to Egypt when I was three. I started drawing very early on. My biggest inspiration as a child was comic books; I loved them and would try to draw like my heroes Bill Sienkiewicz, Frank Frazetta and many more great comic artists.\n\nMy dad, who is an amazing architect, was also a huge inspiration. He not only taught me how to draw, but it was growing up surrounded by pictures on our walls by great artists like Klimt & Schiele, and having lots of art and design books in his library, that opened my eyes to the visual world.\n\nMy mum, who was a teacher, and then an office manager is a very impulsive natural character had lots impact on my personality and attitudes.\n\nAnother huge influence on me is my sister who although only 2 years older than me was my biggest supporter, she always encouraged and helped me through my life in all aspects.\n\nAnd Julie my girlfriend who has also been an incredible support and inspiration, I really like her opinion on my work , it has always been clear and useful.\n\nAnother huge inspiration throughout my life has been The Beatles, not only musically, which I love, but as a story of very unique individuals and how they evolved creatively. Life drawing has had a huge influence on my work also. For the last 5 years I have been drawing in my art teacher John Freeman’s studio. Doing this has really helped develop my drawing skills and attitude towards creating artwork in general.\n\nAfter school I went to Fine Art University in Cairo. I specialised in interior design a decision I would never regret as I got to learn a lot of tangible skills as opposed to going completely arty. In my university years I also began my career as a freelance artist designer, I took any job I could get, from graphic design to painting murals, doing cartoon drawings for magazines and commissioned portraits. This proved to be a great move as I ended up learning by doing as well.\n\nAfter university I continued freelancing for five years and then I started feeling that I needed to work with other creative people, after developing as much as I can on my own.\n\nI was attracted by the video game industry as I felt that in games I could create fantastical worlds and characters, unleash my imagination without the boundaries of the real world construction limitations and budgets, and I would do that with amazing teams of very varied talents and backgrounds. I put a portfolio together and applied to Lionhead Studios in the UK in June 2002, where I got a job as a concept artist. I worked on Fable, Black & White, The Movies, BC, and other unreleased projects; I also met many talented people and made lots of good friends there. During my time in Lionhead I found myself really interested in the game development creative process and started to have my own ideas of creative environments and team dynamics…\n\nIn January 2006 me and my mates founded Media Molecule, together with a small team of other super talents. the full history of Mm can be seen on the Media Molecule website... Today, 5 years later, we have created one of the best projects I have ever worked on: LittleBigPlanet, a project that exposed how talented this generation is. We currently have millions of unique user generated creations that are published for everybody to enjoy and appreciate, and we are soon to finish LittleBigPlanet 2 which I am very proud of too. Art directing this project was an amazing experience, as creating a game that empowers people to do whatever they want needs an empowered team to develop it. My philosophy in art direction is to work with people on solving the creative challenges, much more than being the judge that sees the work after it’s done and critiques it."
