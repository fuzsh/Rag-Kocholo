Just as a long camera exposure fuses motion into a single image, his projects reveal the average sonority, visual language, and vocabulary in music, film, text, or cultural information. Exhibitions of his work include: the Insitut ValenciÃ dâArt Modern, Spain; Haus der elektronischen KÃ¼nste, Switzerland; 2008 Democratic National Convention, Denver; Weisman Art Museum, Minneapolis; San Jose Museum of Art; National Constitution Center, Philadelphia; Cleveland Museum of Contemporary Art; Daelim Contemporary Art Museum, Seoul; 2007 Sundance Film Festival; the Sydney Film Festival; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; PROSPECT.2 New Orleans; and the Aspen Institute. DuBoisâ work and writing has appeared in print and online in the New York Times, National Geographic, and Esquire Magazine, and he was an invited speaker at the 2016 TED Conference. A major survey of his work, NOW, received its premiere at the Ringling Museum of Art in 2014, with a catalogue published by Scala Art & Heritage Publishers.\n\nAn active visual and musical collaborator, DuBois is the co-author of Jitter, a software suite for the real-time manipulation of matrix data developed by San Francisco-based software company Cyclingâ74. He appears on nearly twenty-five albums both individually and as part of the avant-garde electronic group The Freight Elevator Quartet.

He is now in the Symbolic Systems Program at Stanford University. His work has centered in the dynamics of information and how distributed intelligence performs as it flows within networks. As part of this research he designed and implemented a globally distributed computer network that allocates resources by auctioning off computons, bundles of cpu, storage and bandwidth. The other aspect of this work involves designing and testing in the laboratory mechanisms for discovering and aggregating widely dispersed information using economic incentives. Examples are the discovery of social networks from patterns in email exchanges, the prediction of uncertain events using groups of people within a market setting, and more recently the economics of attention.\n\nTom Kalil\n\nEric and Wendy Schmidt Group\n\nThomas Kalil is the former Deputy Director for Policy for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and Senior Advisor for Science, Technology and Innovation for the National Economic Council. Kalil is on leave from UC Berkeley, where he was Special Assistant to the Chancellor for Science and Technology.
