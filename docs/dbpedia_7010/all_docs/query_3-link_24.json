        "text": "Starling, an applied behavioral sciences technology company in the “regtech” space, has announced the appointment of MIT’s Thomas W. Malone to its distinguished academic advisory board.\n\nProfessor Malone is the Patrick J. McGovern Professor of Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. He is also a Professor of Information Technology, of Work and Organizational Studies, and was a founding co-director of the MIT Initiative on “Inventing the Organizations of the 21st Century.” In 2004, Professor Malone summarized decades of his research in the critically acclaimed book, The Future of Work and, in 2018, he did so again in his newest book, Superminds.\n\n“I’m delighted to have Tom with us,” said Starling founder and CEO Stephen Scott. “Tom is a true pioneer in showing how the marriage of ‘Man and Machine’ works to produce a collective intelligence – one that can be harnessed to transform performance management among firms. This includes the way firms manage non-financial risks, such as those that tie to culture and conduct. Tom’s long history of leadership in this new science will be of tremendous value to us at Starling, and to our customers in the financial sector.”\n\nKeep Reading"
