Studies\n\nHe attends Randolph School in Alabama, United States and receives Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in finance.\n\nHe studies at two universities at the time of his graduation and leaves his PhD degree in between as he gets a job in finance and after that he works at Chicago futures and options firm as the research director.\n\nHe is so addicted to the internet that he spends his leisure time writing computer codes.\n\nHe decides to leave financial trading for becoming an internet entrepreneur.\n\nThe initial public offering of Netscape inspired him in 1995.\n\n4. Expensive Schools\n\nBecause of an intense educational background in his family, Wales is always studying at schools that are more expensive than his parents can afford.\n\nThis same educational influence earns him an admission for a PhD, however writing the dissertation is not his cup of tea!\n\nWonder Years\n\n5. Nupedia\n\nBefore Wikipedia launches, Jimmy Wales founds Nupedia, a free online encyclopedia which is developed to provide free of cost experts’ contribution and peer-reviewed encyclopedia.\n\nHe soon starts creating a new encyclopedia called Wikipedia with the help of wiki software.\n\nAnyone can contribute to this new encyclopedia so it is bound to be more successful than Nupedia.\n\n6. Funding for Nupedia\n\nTo fund his brainchild Nupedia and later Wikipedia, Wales partners with two colleagues to form Bomis, which in Wales words was “guy-oriented search engine”.\n\nThis is the first of his attempts to become something in the internet and technology world.\n\nWhile Bomis was has never been taken as a long term project, the adult content that is available here for viewership is intended to generate revenue that Wales can use to fund his encyclopedia projects.\n\nThe Beginning of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales\n\n7.
