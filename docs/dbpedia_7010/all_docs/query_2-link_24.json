        "text": "1. Collective Intelligence Mi Gao & Sandra Rivera______\n\n2. Collective intelligence: concept and implications Here comes everybody The cult of the amateur\n\n3. “Intelligence” and “Collective” Intelligence Collective the “capability of a system defined as “of, relating to, to adapt its behavior to characteristic of, or made meet its goals in a range of by a number of people environments” acting as a group” (Fogel,1995, p. 22) (American Heritage Dictionary) “the ability to solve hard problems” (Minsky, 1985)\n\n4. What is collective intelligence?\n\n5. MIT Center for Collective Intelligence Current Working Definition: Groups of individuals doing things collectively that seem intelligent.\n\n6. Question How about beehives and ant colonies are examples of groups of insects doing things like finding food sources that seem intelligent ? Could we even view a single human brain as a collection of individual neurons or parts of the brain that collectively act intelligently ?\n\n7. MIT Center for Collective Intelligence Further Definition: Collective Intelligence relies upon the individual knowledge, creativity, and identity of its constituent parts, and emerges from a synergy between them. In its highest forms, participating in collective intelligence can actually help people self-actualize while solving collective problems.\n\n8. Wikipedia Collective intelligence has been defined as a “shared or group intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and competition of many individuals. Collective intelligence appears in a wide variety of forms of consensus decision making in bacteria, animals, humans, and computer networks”.\n\n9. Levy’s definition “It is a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and resulting in the effective mobilization of skills. (1997, p. 13)\n\n10. Levy’s Definition indispensable characteristic The basis and goal of collective intelligence is the mutual reorganization and enrichment of individuals rather than the cult of fetishized or hypostatized communities (1997, p. 13).\n\n11. Identifiers of Collective intelligence a group of actors a set of resources available to those actors a set of actions that the actors take the collective results of the actions a way of evaluating the result\n\n12. Question Some people, when they hear the term “collective intelligence” assume that it implies individuals giving up their individuality to be somehow subsumed in a group. What do you think about this opinion ?\n\n13. Which factors inhibit collective intelligence ? Groupthink and Informational Cascades Social Dilemmas Coordination Failures\n\n14. Groupthink and Informational Cascades Whole turns to be less than the sum of the parts because only some parts are actually contributing while everyone else imitates or conforms. Remedy: mechanisms that foster diversity and independence might improve collective intelligence.\n\n15. Social Dilemmas Whole turns to be less than the sum of the parts because some parts contribute and the others slack off. Remedy: Incentives must be carefully structured to reward individual participation as well as collective intelligence.\n\n16. Coordination Failures Whole turns to be less than the sum of the parts because the parts’ contributions interfere with or cancel each other. Remedy: evolving structures and practices that coordinate individual contribution (Al-Hakim & Memmola, 2008 )\n\n17. Participation\n\n18. Question Why do people take part in the activity? What motivates them to participate ? What incentives are at work?\n\n19. Human Motivation Money Love • 1) intrinsic enjoyment of an activity • 2) socializing with others • 3) contributing to a cause Glory (Malone, Laubacher, and Dellarocas, 2009)\n\n20. Here comes everybody: the power of organizing without organizations Clay Shirky • consultant on Internet technologies • Professor in New York University\n\n21. Here comes everybody Group action just got easier”\n\n22. Here comes everybody 3. Collective action 2. Cooperation 1. Sharing\n\n23. Stages in formation of groups: sharing\n\n24. Stages in formation of groups: cooperation\n\n25. Stages in formation of groups: collective action\n\n26. Stages in formation of groups: collective action\n\n27. Stages in formation of groups: collective action “ Revolution doesn’t happen when society adopts new technologies, it happens when society adopt new behaviors” (Shirky, 2008, p. 160)\n\n28. The cult of the amateur: how blogs, MySpace, YouTube and the rest of today's user generated media are killing our culture and economy Andrew Keen • Internet entrepreneur • executive at several Silicon Valley based technology start-ups\n\n29. The cult of the amateur “ noble amateur”: “ the heart of Web 2.0’s cultural revolution and threatens to turn our intellectual traditions and institutions upside down. In one sense, it is a digitalized version of Rousseau’s noble savage, representing the triumph of innocence over experience, of romanticism over the commonsense wisdom of the Enlightenment” (Keen, 2008, p. 36)\n\n30.
