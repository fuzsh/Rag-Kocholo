        "text": "Last week I was happy and honored to introduce professor Thomas Malone - founder-director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence - at a conference he gave at the ARTEM Alliance in Nancy. Tom's presence coincided with the soft launch of a new School of Collective Intelligence that I am helping create at ARTEM, a pioneering multidisciplinary higher-education campus that allies Nancy's École des Mines, ICN Business School and École Nationale Supérieur d'Art et Design. Here's a transcript of my introduction to Tom's keynote address:\n\nIt is a great pleasure and honor to introduce professor Thomas Malone, who, as you know is the founder and director of the Center for Collective Intelligence at MIT.\n\nToday everyone is talking about artificial intelligence and big data, which promise enormous changes in our lives. They say that intelligent machines are going to become smarter than us and will take over our jobs. We have reason to fear that big data is going to lead to a world of massive surveillance and restricted freedom, not unlike a Big-Brother type nightmare.\n\nSo it is a relief to think that even at MIT, perhaps the most famous technological university in the world, there are scientists like Tom who believe that there is still great value in human minds! That the future belongs to us, not to the machines.\n\nIndeed, few scientists have thought more deeply and practically than Tom about how the digital revolution is going to impact the future of work – the title of his first book, ten years ago – or how humans and machine may collaborate to solve some the humanity’s most complex problems – the topic of his new book, Superminds, to be published next spring.\n\nCollective intelligence is a very old idea that dates back at least to Aristotle. But only recently has it become a science. And Tom is largely responsible for making it so:\n\n• Creating the CCI in the heart of MIT, just ten years ago, was a first step in establishing collective intelligence as a multidisciplinary scientific and technical discipline rather than just a cool idea.\n\n• He and his colleagues have published in SCIENCE fundamental discoveries about measuring the intelligence of groups, and how to improve it.\n\n• He then launched the first annual international conference on the topic, in 2012, which has been attracting a growing worldwide community of scientists in multiple disciplines.\n\nThe MIT, like ARTEM, mixes together a school of engineering, a school of management, a cool media lab of creative artists, and more. So when I came earlier to Nancy at the invitation of André Rossinot (president of Métropole du Grand Nancy) to discuss collective intelligence and digital humanism, and I learned about ARTEM, I immediately thought that this unique multidisciplinary campus would be an ideal incubator for a leading-edge school of collective intelligence.\n\nAs we start upon this journey, we are grateful for the inspiration we can draw from Tom’s example, his work, his vision and his gracious presence among us today."
