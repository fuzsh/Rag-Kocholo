        "text": "In this interview, I speak to Professor W. Russell Neuman, one of the world‚Äôs foremost experts on the relationship of technology and society. He was one of the founding faculty of the MIT Media Laboratory and served as Senior Policy Analyst in the White House (Office of Science & Technology Policy). We discuss the danger of projecting human traits onto the machines (and algorithms) we might build and talk to the need for a new vision of computational (and human) intelligence - https://lnkd.in/ebXWRSGM\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gzVyhxXr - In this video in memory of my friend and colleague Professor Peter K. Haff I describe the technosphere and how humans are part of it and how they interact with it.\n\nIt was an absolute honour to host my intellectual hero, John Vervaeke, for episode three of Active Inference Insights. John is a cognitive scientist at the University of Toronto and is a leading intellectual in the fields of intelligence, rationality and meaning in life. He is also the host of the extremely popular lecture series, Awakening From The Meaning Crisis, as well as After Socrates. In this episode, he and I work through the convergence points of relevance realisation and predictive processing, before moving onto the function of consciousness, flow states, the implications of radical enactivism, and much, much more. https://lnkd.in/dRFq6tUK\n\nImagine a profound inner experience, revelation, or download beyond anything you‚Äôve experienced before. How do you understand what‚Äôs happened to you? By using the language of metaphor and drawing on stored memories, networks of neurons begin to fire together in new and novel ways. And you can begin to build a bridge from the known to the unknown. This week, we continue our series on ‚ÄúThe Language of Transformation.‚Äù Learn more in Dr Joe‚Äôs latest blog. https://bit.ly/47loz05\n\nDo you find it hard to visualise higher dimensional space? You're not alone. Even pure mathematicians find it difficult to think beyond three dimensions in a physical sense. Join mathematician and topologist A/Prof Lisa Piccirillo from MIT in the USA, who specialises in studying three- and four-dimensional spaces. In this talk, she'll discuss her work on four-manifold topology and introduce a toolkit on how to develop 'handles' to think about manifolds in four-dimensional space. Be prepared to have your mind warped just a little bit. Register: https://bit.ly/3Quneih\n\nOur president Dr. Qian Chen is presenting in APS 2024 meeting on March 5th discussing the ground breaking result on \"How to test the 'Relativistic Mass/Energy' Concept in Special Relativity with a prediction from Asymmetry Theory\". See the abstract at https://lnkd.in/eEky-vtt\n\nTitle: Probing the Multiverse: The Quest for Evidence Beyond Our Universe Description: Step inside the unassuming lab at the University of Cambridge, where a team of researchers is embarking on a remarkable journey to explore the existence of other universes. In this video, join Zoran Hadzibabic as he takes you through this cutting-edge experiment that seeks to unlock the secrets of the multiverse. https://lnkd.in/gRHv7UUD\n\nWhat lessons have we learned from one of the world‚Äôs worst inventors? ü§î Register for our upcoming webinar to learn about human consequences on the environment and how researchers can mitigate them: https://ow.ly/845e50Q60zy"
