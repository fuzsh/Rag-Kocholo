        "text": "“Our new board members bring world-class, international expertise from global management consulting leadership, software entrepreneurship and academia. Their involvement with Arundo showcases how we are well-positioned for a massive global opportunity,” said Tor Jakob Ramsøy, CEO and Founder of Arundo Analytics. “With outstanding credentials and excellent track records, these new board members bring significant understanding of Arundo’s customer needs, the cutting-edge implications of machine learning and the Industrial Internet of Things, and what it takes to build a successful software company.”\n\nCurrent Board Members Jan Van der Eijk and Harald Norvik will rotate to a new Advisory Board and continue to be involved with Arundo. Tor Jakob Ramsøy and Lars Thoresen will continue serving on the Board of Directors.\n\nArundo enables enterprise-scale machine learning and advanced analytical applications for heavy industrial companies. Its proprietary software for asset-intensive industries like oil and gas, maritime, power and chemicals provides edge-state streaming and local analytics, rapid cloud deployment of applications and company-wide management of numerous applications, helping customers transform their businesses.\n\nNew Board Members\n\nStuart Morstead is currently COO and Co-founder of Arundo Analytics. He was previously a Partner at McKinsey & Co., where he helped drive technology strategy for energy and industrial companies across the Americas, and led McKinsey’s Business Technology Office in the Southern US, Mexico and Central America. Before these roles, he co-founded two technology services companies, was an adjunct professor at Rice University and authored two books on managing enterprise technology operations. He holds a BA in Economics from Rice University and an MBA from INSEAD. Previously serving as a Board Observer, Morstead now adds formal governance duties to his position at Arundo. He is based in Houston, Texas.\n\n“I am honoured to join our new external directors on the board as we position the company for the next step on our journey,” said Stuart Morstead. “I am also grateful for the counsel from Harald Norvik and Jan van der Eijk and look forward to continue working with them as they transition on to our advisory board.”\n\nTore Myrholt was one of McKinsey’s longest-serving Senior Partners before transitioning to a Senior External Advisor role. He was a Senior Partner for 25 years, including time as leader of the Scandinavian Office; leader of the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region; leader of the Doha Office; and Chairman of the Directors Committee. During his time at McKinsey, he focused on clients in the global energy and materials sector and the public sector, with particular experience in corporate transformations. He holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and is based in Doha, Qatar.\n\nThomas Malone is the Patrick J. McGovern Professor at MIT Sloan School of Management and founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. He is also a Professor of Information Technology and a Professor of Work and Organizational Studies at MIT. Previously, he was the Founder and Director of the MIT Center for Co-ordination Science and one of the two founding co-directors of the MIT Initiative on “Inventing the Organisations of the 21st Century.” He teaches classes on organisational design, information technology and leadership, and his research focuses on how new organisations can be designed to take advantage of the possibilities provided by information technology. With a Ph.D. from Stanford University, Malone has been a co-founder of four software companies and served on boards for several organisations. For Arundo, he will contribute from Cambridge, Massachusetts."
