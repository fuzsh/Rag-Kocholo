Afghanistan faces one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. Drought, disasters, decades of war and now economic collapse have left over half the population in need of assistance.

MCC is working with partners to provide relief and promote literacy and peace.

MCC began working in Afghanistan in 1970 when we delivered relief support in response to a cyclone.

Together with our partners, we serve the Afghan people through food assistance, mental health programs and literacy training for girls and women.
