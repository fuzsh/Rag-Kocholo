        "text": "***\n\nEdgewood Arsenal experiments\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThe Edgewood Arsenal experiments (also known as Project 112) are said to be related to or part of CIA mind control programs after World War II, like MKULTRA. Journalist Linda Hunt, citing records from the National Archives, revealed that eight German scientists worked at Edgewood under Project Paperclip: see Secret Agenda: the United States Government, Nazi Scientists and Project Paperclip St. Martin’s Press, 1991; ABC PrimeTime Live, Operation Paperclip, 1991, and hearings before the House Judiciary Committee, 1991. The experiments were performed at the Edgewood Arsenal, northeast of Baltimore, Maryland, and involved the use of hallucinogens such LSD, THC, and BZ, in addition to biological and chemical agents. Experiments on human subjects utilizing such agents goes back to at least World War I. In the mid-1970s, in the wake of many health claims made from exposure to such agents, including psychotropic and hallucinogenic drugs administered in later experiments, Congress began investigations of misuse of such experiments, and inadequate informed consent given by the soldiers and civilians involved.\n\nThe Edgewood experiments took place from approximately 1952-1974 at the Bio Medical Laboratory, which is now known as the U. S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense. The volunteer would spend the weekend on-site. They would perform tests and procedures (math, navigation, following orders, memory and interview) while sober. The volunteer would then be dosed by a scientist and perform the same tests. These tests occurred in the building/hospital under the care of doctors and nurses. At times the tests would be taken outside to study the effects while in the field. For example the volunteer would have to guard a check point while under the influence to see what effects certain drugs had on the patient.\n\nA pamphlet produced by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Effects from Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Weapons (Oct. 2003), discusses the Edgewood Arsenal Experiments in some detail:\n\nRenewed interest led to renewed human testing by the Department of Defense (DoD), although ultimately on a much smaller scale. Thus, between 1950 and 1975, about 6,720 soldiers took part in experiments involving exposures to 254 different chemicals, conducted at U.S. Army Laboratories at Edgewood Arsenal, MD (NRC 1982, NRC 1984, NAS 1993). Congressional hearings into these experiments in 1974 and 1975 resulted in disclosures, notification of subjects as to the nature of their chemical exposures, and ultimately to compensation for a few families of subjects who had died during the experiments (NAS 3). These experiments were conducted primarily to learn how various agents would affect humans (NRC 1982). Other agencies including the CIA and the Special Operations Division of the Department of the Army were also reportedly involved in these studies (NAS 1993). Only a small number of all the experiments done during this period involved mustard agents or Lewisite. Records indicate that between 1955 and 1965, of the 6,720 soldiers tested, only 147 human subjects underwent exposure to mustard agent at Edgewood (NRC 1982). According to the 1984 NRC review, human experiments at DoD’s Edgewood Arsenal involved about 1,500 subjects who were experimentally exposed to irritant and blister agents including:\n\n* lachrymatory agents, e.g., CN;\n\n* riot control agents, e.g., CS;\n\n* chloropicrin (PS);\n\n* Diphenylaminochlorarsine (DM, Adamsite);\n\n* other ocular and respiratory irritants; and\n\n* mustard agents.\n\nFor example, from 1958 to 1973 at least 1,366 human subjects underwent experimental exposure specifically with the riot control agent CS at Edgewood Arsenal (NRC 1984). Of those involved in the experiments:\n\n* 1,073 Subjects were exposed to aerosolized CS;\n\n* 180 Subjects were exposed dermally;\n\n* 82 subjects had both skin applications and aerosol exposures;\n\nand finally\n\n* 31 subjects experienced ocular exposure via direct CS application to their eyes.\n\nMost of these experiments involved tests of protective equipment and of subjects’ ability to perform military tasks during exposure.\n\nThe report cites three earlier studies for its data, namely;\n\n* Veterans at Risk: Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite\n\n* Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Chemical Agents, Volume 1, Anticholinesterases, and Anticholinergics. (1982). Commission on Life Sciences. The National Academies Press\n\n* Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Short-Term Exposure To Chemical Agents, Volume 2: Cholinesterase Reactivators, Psychochemicals and Irritants and Vesicants (1984) Commission on Life Sciences. The National Academies Press.\n\nThe Veterans Affairs pamphlet, written to aid government clinicians in understanding the presence of various symptoms in presenting patients at their clinics and hospitals, also discusses the use of psychoactive drugs on human subjects:\n\nAbout 260 subjects were experimentally exposed to various psychochemicals including phencyclidine (PCP), and 10 related synthetic analogs of the active ingredient of cannabis (NRC 1984). The NRC report also mentions human experiments involving exposure of 741 soldiers to LSD (NRC 1984).\n\nThe Vanderbilt University Television News Archive has two videos about the experiments, both from a July 17, 1975 NBC Evening News segment . In one, NBC newsman John Chancellor reports on how Norman Augustine, then-acting Secretary of Army, ordered a probe of Army use of LSD in soldier and civilian experiments. In a separate piece, by reporter Tom Pettit, Major General Lloyd Fellenz, from Edgewood Arsenal, explains how the experiments there were about searching for humane weapons, adding that the use of LSD was unacceptable.\n\nA Washington Post article, dated July 23, 1975, by Bill Richards ( 6,940 Took Drugs ) reported that a top civilian drug researcher for the Army said a total of 6,940 servicemen had been involved in Army chemical and drug experiments, and that, furthermore, the tests were proceeding at Edgewood Arsenal as of the date of the article. A Government Accounting Office May 2004 report, Chemical and Biological Defense (p. 24), states that there even more victims of the experimental program, a number that may never be completely known:\n\nWe also reported that the Army Chemical Corps conducted a classified medical research program for developing incapacitating agents. This program involved testing nerve agents, nerve agent antidotes, psycho chemicals, and irritants. The chemicals were given to volunteer service members at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland; Dugway Proving Ground, Utah; and Forts Benning, Bragg, and McClellan. In total, Army documents identified 7,120 Army and Air Force personnel who participated in these tests.15 Further, GAO concluded that precise information on the scope and the magnitude of tests involving human subjects was not available, and the exact number of human subjects might never be known.\n\nGAO explains at the outset of their report the rationale for the study:\n\nIn the 1962-74 time period, the Department of Defense (DOD) conducted a classified chemical and biological warfare test program —- Project 112 —- that might have exposed service members and civilian personnel to chemical or biological agents. In 2000 the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) began obtaining information from DOD about the program. Concerned that veterans and others might have health problems from exposure during Project 112 and similar DOD tests, Congress required DOD in the 2003 Defense Authorization Act to identify Project 112 tests and personnel potentially exposed—service members and the number of civilian personnel—and other chemical and biological tests that might have exposed service members.\n\nFinally, it appears there were similar experiments conducted at the UK Ministry of Defence establishment at Porton Down, Wiltshire, into at least the 1970s.

Recently the term has gained notoriety in describing secret prisons operated by the Central Intelligence Agency, generally outside of US territory and legal jurisdiction. It can refer to the facilities that are controlled by the CIA used by the US in its War on Terror to detain alleged unlawful enemy combatants.[1]\n\nUS President George W. Bush acknowledged the existence of secret prisons operated by the CIA during a speech on September 6, 2006.[2][3] A claim that the black sites existed was made by The Washington Post in November 2005 and before this by human rights NGOs.[4]\n\nMany European countries[who?] have officially denied they are hosting black sites to imprison terrorists or cooperating in the US extraordinary rendition program. Not one country has confirmed that it is hosting black sites. However, an EU report adopted on February 14, 2007 by a majority of the European Parliament (382 MEPs voting in favour, 256 against and 74 abstaining) stated the CIA operated 1,245 flights and that it was not possible to contradict evidence or suggestions that secret detention centres were operated in Poland and Romania.[1][5]\n\nIn early 2009, the U.S. administration ordered the black sites to be closed.\n\nContents\n\n* 1 Official Recognition of Black Sites\n\no 1.1 2006 Bush announcement\n\no 1.2 2007 Red Cross report to the U.S. government\n\no 1.3 2009 closure of black sites by U.S.\n\n* 2 Controversy over the Legality and Secrecy of Black Sites\n\no 2.1 Legal status of black site detainees\n\no 2.2 Legal authority for black site operation\n\no 2.3 Public information about black site operation\n\n+ 2.3.1 Representations by the Bush administration\n\n+ 2.3.2 Information derived from investigative reporting\n\n* 3 Specific Facts Surrounding Black Sites\n\no 3.1 Detainees\n\n+ 3.1.1 Khaled el-Masri\n\n+ 3.1.2 Imam Rapito\n\n+ 3.1.3 Dr. Aafia Siddiqui\n\no 3.2 Suspected black sites\n\n+ 3.2.1 Asia\n\n+ 3.2.2 Middle East\n\n+ 3.2.3 Africa\n\n+ 3.2.4 Indian Ocean\n\n+ 3.2.5 Europe\n\n+ 3.2.6 Mobile sites\n\n* 4 Media and investigative history\n\no 4.1 Media\n\n+ 4.1.1 The Washington Post December 2002\n\n+ 4.1.2 Human Rights Watch March 2004 report\n\n+ 4.1.3 Village March 2005 report\n\n+ 4.1.4 Washington Post November 2005 article\n\n+ 4.1.5 Human Rights Watch’s report\n\n+ 4.1.6 BBC December 2006 report\n\n+ 4.1.7 New Yorker August 2007 article\n\n+ 4.1.8 September 2007 media reports to present\n\no 4.2 European investigations\n\n+ 4.2.1 Spain investigations\n\n+ 4.2.2 France investigations\n\n+ 4.2.3 Portugal investigations\n\n+ 4.2.4 Other European investigations\n\n+ 4.2.5 The Onyx-intercepted fax\n\n+ 4.2.6 The European Parliament’s February 14, 2007 report\n\no 4.3 Obama administration\n\n* 5 See also\n\n* 6 References\n\n* 7 External links\n\nOfficial Recognition of Black Sites\n\nBlack sites operated by the U.S. government and its surrogates were first officially acknowledged by President George Bush in fall, 2006. The International Committee of the Red Cross reported details of black site practices to the U.S. government in early 2007, and the contents of that report became public in March, 2009. President Barack Obama ordered the black sites closed in January, 2009.\n\n2006 Bush announcement\n\nOn September 6, 2006 President Bush publicly admitted the existence of secret prisons[6] and announced that many of the detainees held there were being transferred to Guantanamo Bay.[7]\n\n2007 Red Cross report to the U.S. government\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) prepared a report based on interviews with black site detainees, conducted between October 6 and 11 and December 4 and 14, 2006, after their transfer to Guantanamo.[8] The report was submitted to Bush administration officials.\n\nOn March 15, 2009, Mark Danner provided a report in the New York Review of Books (with an abridged version in the New York Times) describing and commenting on the contents of the ICRC report.[9][10] According to Danner, the report was marked confidential and was not previously made public before being made available to him. Danner provided excerpts of interviews with detainees, including Abu Zubaydah, Walid bin Attash, and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Danner also provided excerpts of the ICRC report characterizing procedures used at the black sites, dubbed an alternative set of procedures by President George Bush, and discussed whether they fit the definition of torture.\n\n2009 closure of black sites by U.S.\n\nSearch Wikisource Wikisource has original text related to this article:\n\nMessage from the Director: Interrogation Policy and Contracts\n\nNewly inaugurated President Barack Obama issued an executive order closing the CIA’s black sites on January 23, 2009.[11] In April, 2009, CIA director Leon Panetta announced that the CIA no longer operates detention facilities or black sites, in a letter to staff and that [r]emaining sites would be decommissioned . He also announced that the CIA was no longer allowing outside contractors to carry out interrogations and that the CIA no longer employed controversial harsh interrogation techniques .[12][13][14] Panetta informed his fellow employees that the CIA would only use interrogation techniques authorized in the US Army interrogation manual, and that any individuals taken into custody by the CIA would only be held briefly, for the time necessary to transfer them to the custody of authorities in their home countries, or the custody of another US agency.\n\nControversy over the Legality and Secrecy of Black Sites\n\nBlack sites are embroiled in controversy over the legal status of the detainees held there, the legal authority for the operation of the sites (including the collaboration between governments involved), and full (or even minimal) disclosure by the governments involved.\n\nLegal status of black site detainees\n\nAn important aspect of black site operation is that the legal status of black site detainees is not clearly defined.\n\nThe revelation of such black sites adds to the controversy surrounding US government policy regarding those whom it describes as unlawful enemy combatants . According to government sources, the detainees are broken into two groups. Approximately 30 detainees are considered the most dangerous or important terrorism suspects and are held by the CIA at black sites under the most secretive arrangements.\n\nThe second group is more than 70 detainees who may have originally been sent to black sites, but were soon delivered by the CIA to intelligence agencies in allied Middle Eastern and Asian countries such as Afghanistan, Morocco, and Egypt.\n\nA further 100 ghost detainees kidnapped in Europe and rendered to other countries must be counted, according to Swiss senator Dick Marty’s report of January 2006. This process is called extraordinary rendition . Marty also underlined that European countries probably had knowledge of these covert operations. Furthermore, the CIA apparently financially assists and directs the jails in these countries.\n\nWhile the US and host countries have signed the United Nations Convention Against Torture, CIA officers are allowed to use what the agency calls enhanced interrogation techniques . These have been alleged to constitute severe pain or suffering under the UN convention, which would be a violation of the treaty and thus US law.\n\nLegal authority for black site operation\n\nThere is little or no stated legal authority for the operation of black sites by the United States or the other countries believed to be involved. In fact, the specifics of the network of black sites remains controversial.\n\nThe United Nations has begun to intervene in this aspect of black sites.\n\nThe fourteen European countries Marty listed as collaborators in unlawful inter-state transfers are Britain, Germany, Isle Of Man, Italy, Sweden, Bosnia, Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Spain, Cyprus, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Romania and Poland. Named airport bases include Glasgow Prestwick Airport (Britain), Shannon (Ireland), Ramstein and Frankfurt (Germany), Aviano Air Base (Italy), Palma de Mallorca Airport (Spain), Tuzla Air Base (Bosnia-Herzegovina), Skopje (Republic of Macedonia), Athens (Greece), Larnaca (Cyprus), Prague (Czech Republic), Stockholm, as well as Rabat (Morocco) and Algiers (Algeria) [15].\n\nPolish Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz characterized the accusation as libel , while Romania similarly said there was no evidence. Britain’s Tony Blair said that the report added absolutely nothing new whatever to the information we have. [16][17] Poland and Romania received the most direct accusals, as the report claims the evidence for these sites is strong. The report cites airports in Timis,oara, Romania, and Szymany, Poland, as detainee transfer/drop-off point[s]. Eight airports outside Europe are also cited.\n\nOn May 19, 2006, the United Nations Committee Against Torture (the U.N. body that monitors compliance with the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the world’s anti-torture treaty) recommended that the United States cease holding detainees in secret prisons and stop the practice of rendering prisoners to countries where they are likely to be tortured. The decision was made in Geneva following two days of hearings at which a 26-member U.S. delegation defended the practices.[18] PDF file of report\n\nPublic information about black site operation\n\nThe U.S. government does not provide information about the operation of black sites, and for a period of time did not provide information about the existence of black sites.\n\nRepresentations by the Bush administration\n\nResponding to the allegations about black sites, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated on December 5 that US had not violated any country’s sovereignty in the rendition of suspects, and that individuals were never rendered to countries where it was believed that they might be tortured. Some media sources have noted her comments do not exclude the possibility of covert prison sites operated with the knowledge of the host nation,[19] or the possibility that promises by such host nations that they will refrain from torture may not be genuine.[20] On September 6, 2006 President Bush finally publicly admitted the existence of the secret prisons[6] and that many of the detainees held there were being transferred to Guantanamo Bay[7].\n\nIn December 2002, The Washington Post reported that the capture of al Qaeda leaders Ramzi Binalshibh in Pakistan, Omar al-Faruq in Indonesia, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in Kuwait and Muhammad al Darbi in Yemen were all partly the result of information gained during interrogations. The Post cited U.S. intelligence and national security officials in reporting this.[21]\n\nOn April 21, 2006, Mary O. McCarthy, a longtime CIA analyst, was fired for allegedly leaking classified information to a Washington Post reporter, Dana Priest, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for her revelations concerning the CIA’s black sites. Some have speculated that the information allegedly leaked may have included information about the camps.[22] McCarthy’s lawyer, however, claimed that McCarthy did not have access to the information she is accused of leaking. [23] The Washington Post posited that McCarthy had been probing allegations of criminal mistreatment by the CIA and its contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan , and became convinced that CIA people had lied in a meeting with US Senate staff in June 2005.[24]\n\nIn a September 29, 2006 speech, President Bush stated: Once captured, Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi Binalshibh, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed were taken into custody of the Central Intelligence Agency. The questioning of these and other suspected terrorists provided information that helped us protect the American people. They helped us break up a cell of Southeast Asian terrorist operatives that had been groomed for attacks inside the United States. They helped us disrupt an al Qaeda operation to develop anthrax for terrorist attacks. They helped us stop a planned strike on a U.S. Marine camp in Djibouti, and to prevent a planned attack on the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, and to foil a plot to hijack passenger planes and to fly them into Heathrow Airport and London’s Canary Wharf. [25]\n\nOn July 20, 2007 President Bush made an executive order banning torture of captives by intelligence officials.[26]\n\nIn a September 7, 2007 public address to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, rare for a sitting Director of Central Intelligence, General Michael Hayden praised the program of detaining and interrogating prisoners, and credited it with providing 70 percent of the National Intelligence Estimate on the threat to America released in July. Hayden said the CIA has detained fewer than 100 people at secret facilities abroad since 2002, and even fewer prisoners have been secretly transferred to or from foreign governments. In a 20-minute question-and-answer session with the audience, Hayden disputed assertions that the CIA has used waterboarding, stress positions, hypothermia and dogs to interrogate suspects — all techniques that have been broadly criticized. That’s a pretty good example of taking something to the darkest corner of the room and not reflective of what my agency does Hayden told one person from a human rights organization. [27]\n\nInformation derived from investigative reporting\n\nThe vast majority of information that has been provided to the public about black sites has been the result of investigative reporting. For full details, see the section below on the media and investigative history.\n\nSpecific Facts Surrounding Black Sites\n\nAs discussed in the preceding section, many of the facts surrounding black sites remain controversial. The identity of detainees and the location of sites are known with varying degrees of certainty, though many facts have been discovered in substantial detail.\n\nDetainees\n\nMain article: Detainees in CIA custody\n\nThe list of those thought to be held by the CIA include suspected al-Qaeda members Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin, Ramzi Binalshibh and Abu Zubaydah. The total number of ghost detainees is presumed to be at least one hundred, although the precise number cannot be determined because fewer than 10% have been charged or convicted. However, Swiss senator Dick Marty’s memorandum on alleged detention in Council of Europe states stated that about 100 persons have been kidnapped by the CIA on European territory and subsequently rendered to countries where they may have been tortured. This number of 100 persons does not overlap, but adds itself to the U.S.-detained 100 ghost detainees.[28]\n\nA number of the alleged detainees listed above were transferred to the U.S.-run Guantanamo Bay prison on Cuba in the fall of 2006. With this publicly announced act, the United States government de facto also acknowledged the existence of secret prisons abroad in which these prisoners were held.\n\nKhaled el-Masri\n\nMain article: Khalid El-Masri\n\nKhalid El-Masri is a German citizen who was detained, flown to Afghanistan, interrogated and allegedly tortured by the CIA for several months, and then released in remote Albania in May 2004 without having been charged with any offense. This was apparently due to a misunderstanding that arose concerning the similarity of the spelling of El-Masri’s name with the spelling of suspected terrorist Khalid al-Masri. Germany had issued warrants for 13 people suspected to be involved with the abduction, but dropped them in September, 2007.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court declined without comment to hear an appeal of El-Masri’s civil lawsuit against the United States, letting stand an earlier verdict by a federal district court judge, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Those courts had agreed with the government that the case could not go forward without exposing state secrets. In May 2007, Masri was committed to a psychiatric institution after he was arrested in the southern German city of Neu-Ulm on suspicion of arson. His attorney blamed his troubles on the CIA, saying the kidnapping and detention had left Masri a psychological wreck. [29]\n\nImam Rapito\n\nMain article: Imam Rapito affair\n\nThe CIA abducted Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr (also known as Abu Omar) in Milan and transferred him to Egypt where he was allegedly tortured and abused. Hassan Nasr was released by Egyptian justice in February 2007, who considered his detention unfounded, and has not been indicted for any crime in Italy. Ultimately, twenty-six Americans and nine Italians have been indicted with a trial pending.\n\nDr. Aafia Siddiqui\n\nMain article: Aafia Siddiqui\n\nThe defense for Dr. Aafia currently under trial in the US has alleged that she was held and tortured in a secret US facility at Baghram for several years. The case of Dr. Aafia gained notoriety due to the allegations of Yvon Ridley in her book the grey lady of baghram\n\nSuspected black sites\n\nThe U.S. and suspected CIA black sites Extraordinary renditions allegedly have been carried out from these countries Detainees have allegedly been transported through these countries Detainees have allegedly arrived in these countries Sources: Amnesty International[30], Human Rights Watch, Black sites article on Wikipedia[citation needed]\n\nAsia\n\nIn Thailand, the Voice of America relay station in Udon Thani was reported to be a black site. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has denied these reports.[31]\n\nMiddle East\n\nIn Afghanistan, the prison at Bagram Air Base was initially housed in an abandoned brickmaking factory outside Kabul known as the Salt Pit [32], but later moved to the base some time after a young Afghan died of hypothermia after being stripped naked and left chained to a floor. During this period, there were several incidents of torture and prisoner abuse, though they were related to non-secret prisoners, and not the CIA-operated portion of the prison. At some point prior to 2005, the prison was again relocated, this time to an unknown site. Metal containers at Bagram Air Base were reported to be black sites.[33] Some Guantanamo detainees report being tortured in a prison they called the dark prison , also near Kabul.[34] Also in Afghanistan, Jalalabad and Asadabad have been reported as suspected sites.[35]\n\nIn Iraq, Abu Ghraib was disclosed as also working as a black site, and was the center of an extensive prisoner abuse scandal.[36] Additionally, Camp Bucca (near Umm Qasr) and Camp Cropper (near the Baghdad International Airport) were reported.\n\nThe Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Al Jafr prison in Jordan as a black site.[37]\n\nBlack sites have also been reported in Alizai, Kohat,[35] and Pesha-war, Pakistan. The Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram reported in December 2001 that 275 prisoners, charged with illegally entering Pakistan, were interrogated by the FBI and CIA at Kohat prison, writing that while Pakistani Taliban were questioned by Pakistan’s intelligence agency, the Arabs were at the mercy of the FBI and CIA. [38]\n\nAfrica\n\nSome reported sites in Egypt, Libya, and Morocco [39][40], as well as Djibouti [41] The al-Tamara interrogation centre, five miles outside the Moroccan capital, Rabat, is cited as one such site.[42]\n\nOn January 23, 2009, The Guardian reported that the CIA ran a secret detention center in Camp Lemonier in Djibouti, a former French Foreign Legion base.[11]\n\nIndian Ocean\n\nThe U.S. Naval Base in Diego Garcia was reported to be a black site, but UK and U.S. officials initially attempted to suppress these reports.[43][44] However, it has since been revealed by Time Magazine and a senior American official source that the UK isle was indeed used by the US as a secret prison for war on terror detainees.\n\nWhile the revelation is expected to cause considerable embarrassment for both governments, UK officials may face considerable exposure since they had previously quelled public outcry over US detainee abuse by falsely reassuring the public no US detainment camps were housed any on UK bases or territories. The UK may also face liabilities over apparent violations of international treaties. [45]\n\nEurope\n\nSeveral European countries (particularly the former Soviet satellites and republics) have been accused of and denied hosting black sites: the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Armenia, Georgia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan[8]. Slovak ministry spokesman Richard Fides said the country had no black sites, but its intelligence service spokesman Vladimir Simko said he would not disclose any information about possible Slovak black sites to the media.[citation needed] EU Justice commissioner Franco Frattini has repeatedly asserted suspension of voting rights for any member state found to have hosted a CIA black site.\n\nThe interior minister of Romania, Vasile Blaga, has assured the EU that the Mihail Koga (lniceanu Airport was used only as a supply point for equipment, and never for detention, though there have been reports to the contrary. A fax intercepted by the Onyx Swiss interception system, from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry to its London embassy stated that 23 prisoners were clandestinely interrogated by the U.S. at the base.[46][47][48] In 2007, it was disclosed by Dick Marty (investigator) that the CIA allegedly had secret prisons in Poland and Romania.[49]\n\nThere are other reported sites in Ukraine[50], who denied hosting any such sites [51], and the Republic of Macedonia.[8]\n\nIn June 2008 a New York Times article claimed citing unnamed CIA officers that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was held in a secret facility in Poland near Szymany Airport, about 100 miles north of Warsaw and it was there where the he was interrogated and the waterboarding was applied. It is claimed that waterboarding was used about 100 times over a period of two weeks before Khalid Sheikh Mohammed began to cooperate.[52]\n\nIn September 2008 two anonymous Polish intelligence officers made the claims about facilities being located in Poland in the Polish daily newspapewr Dziennik. One of them stated that between 2002 and 2005 the CIA held terror suspects inside a military intelligence training base in Stare Kiejkuty in north-eastern Poland. The officer said only the CIA had access to the isolated zone, which was used because it was a secure site far from major towns and was close to a former military airport. Both the then Prime Minister, Leszek Miller, and President, Aleksander Kwasniewski, knew about the base, the newspaper reported. However the officer said it was unlikely either man knew if the prisoners were being tortured because the Poles had no control over the Americans’ activities. [53]\n\nOn January 23, 2009 The Guardian reported that the CIA had run black sites at Szymany Airport in Poland, Camp Eagle in Bosnia and Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo.[11]\n\nMobile sites\n\n* U.S. warship USS Bataan[54][55][56]- By definition as a U.S. military vessel, this is not technically a black site as defined above. However, it has been used by the United States military as a temporary initial interrogation site (after which, prisoners are then transferred to other facilities, possibly including black sites).\n\n* N221SG a Learjet 35\n\n* N44982 a Gulfstream V[57][58] (also known as N379P)\n\n* N8068V a Gulfstream V\n\n* N4476S a Boeing Business Jet[59][60]\n\n* On May 31, 2008 The Guardian reported that the human rights group Reprieve said up to seventeen US Naval vessels may have been used to covertly hold captives.[61][62] In addition to the USS Bataan The Guardian named: USS Peleliu and the USS Ashland, USNS Stockham, USNS Watson, USNS Watkins, USNS Sister, USNS Charlton, USNS Pomeroy, USNS Red Cloud, USNS Soderman, and USNS Dahl; MV PFC William B Baugh, MV Alex Bonnyman, MV Franklin J Phillips, MV Louis J Huage Jr and MV James Anderson Jr. The Ashland was stationed off the coast of Somalia, in 2007, and, Reprieve expressed concern it had been used as a receiving ship for up to 100 captives taken in East Africa.\n\nMedia and investigative history\n\nMedia\n\nThe Washington Post December 2002\n\nThe Washington Post on December 26, 2002 reported about a secret CIA prison in one corner of Bagram Air Force Base (Afghanistan) consisting of metal shipping containers.[3] On March 14, 2004, The Guardian reported that three British citizens were held captive in a secret section (Camp Echo) of the Guantánamo Bay complex.[63] Several other articles reported the retention of ghost detainees by the CIA, alongside the other official enemy combatants . However, it was the revelations of the Washington Post, in a November 2, 2005 article, that would start the scandal. (below)[64]\n\nHuman Rights Watch March 2004 report\n\nFurther information: Enduring Freedom – Abuses by US Forces in Afghanistan\n\nA report by the human rights organization Human Rights Watch, entitled Enduring Freedom – Abuses by US Forces in Afghanistan, states that the CIA has operated in Afghanistan since September, 2001[65]; maintaining a large facility in the Ariana Chowk neighborhood of Kabul and a detention and interrogation facility at the Bagram airbase.\n\nVillage March 2005 report\n\nIn the 26 February-4 March 2005 edition of Ireland’s Village magazine, an article titled Abductions via Shannon claimed that Dublin and Shannon airports in Ireland were used by the CIA to abduct suspects in its ‘war on terror’ . The article went on to state that a Boeing 737 (registration number N313P, later reregistered N4476S) was routed through Shannon and Dublin on fourteen occasions from 1 January 2003 to the end of 2004. This is according to the flight log of the aircraft obtained from Washington DC by Village. Destinations included Estonia (1/11/03); Larnaca, Sale, Kabul, Palma, Skopje, Baghdad, Kabul (all 16 January 2004);Marka (10 May 2004 and 13 June 2004). Other flights began in places such as Dubai (2 June 2003 and 30 December 2003), Mitiga (29 October 2003 and 27 April 2004), Baghdad (2003) and Marka (8 February 2004, 4 March 2004, 10 May 2004), all of which ended in Washington DC.\n\nAccording to the article, the same aircraft landed in Guantanamo on September 23, 2003 having travelled from Kabul to Szymany (Poland), Mihail Koga(lniceanu (Romania) and Salé (Morocco). It had been used in connection with the abduction in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia, of Khalid El-Masri, a German citizen of Lebanese descent, on 31 December 2003, and his transport to a US detention centre in Afghanistan on 23 January 2004.\n\nIn the article, it was noted that the aircraft’s registration showed it as being owned by Premier Executive Transport Services, based in Massachusetts, though as of February 2005 it was listed as being owned by Keeler and Tate Management, Reno, Nevada (US). On the day of registration transference, a Gulfstream V jet (number N8068V) used in the same activities, was transferred from Premier Executive Transport Services to a company called Baynard Foreign Marketing.\n\nWashington Post November 2005 article\n\nA story by reporter Dana Priest published in The Washington Post of November 2, 2005, reported: The CIA has been hiding and interrogating some of its most important alleged al Qaeda captives at a Soviet-era compound in Eastern Europe, according to U.S. and foreign officials familiar with the arrangement. [66] According to current and former intelligence officials and diplomats, there is a network of foreign prisons that includes or has included sites in several European democracies, Thailand, Afghanistan, and a small portion of the Guantánamo Bay prison in Cuba – this network has been labeled by Amnesty International as The Gulag Archipelago , in a clear reference to the novel of the same name by Russian writer and activist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.[67][68]\n\nThe reporting of the secret prisons was heavily criticized by members and former members of the Bush Administration. However, Dana Priest states no one in the administration requested that the Washington Post not print the story. Rather they asked they not publish the names of the countries in which the prisons are located.[67] The Post has not identified the East European countries involved in the secret program at the request of senior U.S. officials who argued that the disclosure could disrupt counter-terrorism efforts .[69]\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s report\n\nOn November 3, 2005, Tom Malinowski of the New York-based Human Rights Watch cited circumstantial evidence pointing to Poland and Romania hosting CIA-operated covert prisons. Flight records obtained by the group documented the Boeing 737 ‘N4476S’ leased by the CIA for transporting prisoners leaving Kabul and making stops in Poland and Romania before continuing on to Morocco, and finally Guantánamo Bay in Cuba.[70][71] Such flight patterns might corroborate the claims of government officials that prisoners are grouped into different classes being deposited in different locations. Malinowski’s comments prompted quick denials by both Polish and Romanian government officials as well as sparking the concern of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ), who called for access to all foreign terrorism suspects held by the United States.\n\nThe accusation that several EU members may have allowed the United States to hold, imprison or torture detainees on their soil has been a subject of controversy in the European body, who announced in November 2005 that any country found to be complicit could lose their right to vote in the council.[72]\n\nAmnesty International November 2005 report\n\nOn November 8, 2005, rights group Amnesty International provided the first comprehensive testimony from former inmates of the CIA black sites.[73] The report, which documented the cases of three Yemeni nationals, was the first to describe the conditions in black site detention in detail. In a subsequent report, in April 2006, Amnesty International used flight records and other information to locate the black site in Eastern Europe or Central Asia.\n\nBBC December 2006 report\n\nOn 28 December 2006, the BBC reported that during 2003, a well-known CIA Gulfstream aircraft implicated in extraordinary renditions, N379P, had on several occasions landed at the Polish airbase of Szymany. The airport manager reported that airport officials were told to keep away from the aircraft, which parked at the far end of the runway and frequently kept their engines running. Vans from a nearby intelligence base (Stare Kiejkuty) met the aircraft, stayed for a short while and then drove off. Landing fees were paid in cash, with the invoices made out to probably fake American companies. [74]\n\nNew Yorker August 2007 article\n\nAn August 13, 2007 story by Jane Mayer in The New Yorker reported that the CIA has operated black site secret prisons by the direct Presidential order of George W. Bush since shortly after 9/11, and that extreme psychological interrogation measures based at least partially on the Vietnam-era Phoenix Program were used on detainees. These included sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, keeping prisoners naked indefinitely and photographing them naked to degrade and humiliate them, and forcibly administering drugs by suppositories to further break down their dignity. According to Mayer’s report, CIA officers have taken out professional liability insurance, fearing that they could be criminally prosecuted if what they have already done became public knowledge. [75]\n\nSeptember 2007 media reports to present\n\nOn September 14, 2007, The Washington Post reported that members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence had requested the withdrawal of the nomination of John Rizzo – a career CIA lawyer – for the position of general counsel, due to concerns about his support for Bush administration legal doctrines permitting enhanced interrogation of terrorism detainees in CIA custody. [76]\n\nOn October 4, 2007, The New York Times reported that despite a public legal opinion issued in December 2004 that declared torture abhorrent, that shortly after Alberto Gonzales became Attorney General in February 2005 that the Justice Department issued another, secret opinion which for the first time provided CIA explicit authorization to barrage terror suspects with a combination of painful physical and psychological tactics, including head-slapping, simulated drowning and frigid temperatures. Gonzales reportedly approved the legal memorandum on “combined effects” over the objections of James B. Comey, the outgoing deputy attorney general, who told colleagues at the Justice Department that they would all be “ashamed” when the world eventually learned of it. According to The Times report, the 2005 Justice Department opinions remain in effect, and their legal conclusions have been confirmed by several more recent memorandums. [77]\n\nPatrick Leahy and John Conyers, chairmen of the respective Senate and House Judiciary Committees, requested that the Justice Department turn over documents related to the secret February 2005 legal opinion to their committees for review. [78] The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, John D. Rockefeller IV, wrote to acting attorney general Peter D. Keisler, asking for copies of all opinions on interrogation since 2004. I find it unfathomable that the committee tasked with oversight of the C.I.A.’s detention and interrogation program would be provided more information by The New York Times than by the Department of Justice, Rockefeller’s letter read in part. [79] On October 5, 2007, President George W. Bush responded, saying This government does not torture people. You know, we stick to U.S. law and our international obligations. The President said that the interrogation techniques have been fully disclosed to appropriate members of Congress. [80]\n\nOn October 11, 2007, The New York Times reported that CIA director Gen. Michael V. Hayden had ordered an unusual internal inquiry into the work of the agency’s inspector general, John L. Helgerson, whose aggressive investigations of the CIA’s detention and interrogation programs and other matters have created resentment among agency operatives. The inquiry is reportedly being overseen by Robert L. Deitz, a lawyer who served as general counsel at the National Security Agency when General Hayden ran it, and also includes Michael Morrell, the agency’s associate deputy director.\n\nA report by Helgerson’s office completed in the spring of 2004 warned that some CIA-approved interrogation procedures appeared to constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, as defined by the international Convention Against Torture. Some of the inspector general’s work on detention issues was conducted by Mary O. McCarthy, who was fired from the agency in 2006 after being accused of leaking classified information. Helgerson’s office is reportedly nearing completion on a number of inquiries into CIA detention, interrogation, and renditions. [81] Members of the House and Senate intelligence committees expressed concern about the inquiry, saying that it could undermine the inspector general’s role as independent watchdog. Senator Ron Wyden said he was sending a letter to Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, asking him to instruct General Hayden to drop the inquiry.[82]\n\nIn an October 30, 2007 address to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, CIA Director General Michael Hayden defended the agency’s interrogation methods, saying, Our programs are as lawful as they are valuable. Asked a question about waterboarding, Hayden mentioned attorney general nominee Michael Mukasey, saying, Judge Mukasey cannot nor can I answer your question in the abstract. I need to understand the totality of the circumstances in which this question is being posed before I can give you an answer. [83]\n\nOn December 6, 2007, the CIA admitted that it had destroyed videotapes recordings of CIA interrogations of terrorism suspects involving harsh interrogation techniques, tapes which critics suggest may have documented the use of torture by the CIA, such as waterboarding. The tapes were made in 2002 as part of a secret detention and interrogation program, and were destroyed in November 2005. The reason cited for the destruction of the tapes was that the tapes posed a security risk for the interrogators shown on the tapes. Yet the department also stated that the tapes had no more intelligence value and were not relevant to any inquiries . [84] In response, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., stated: You’d have to burn every document at the CIA that has the identity of an agent on it under that theory. Other Democrats in Congress also made public statements of outrage about the destruction of the tapes, suggesting that a violation of law had occurred. [85]\n\nEuropean investigations\n\nAfter a media and public outcry in Europe concerning headlines about secret CIA prisons in Poland and other US allies, the EU through its Committee on Legal Affairs investigated whether any of its members, especially Poland, the Czech Republic or Romania had any of these secret CIA prisons. After an investigation by the EU Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, the EU determined that it could not find any of these prisons. In fact, they could not prove if they had ever existed at all. To quote the report, At this stage of the investigations, there is no formal, irrefutable evidence of the existence of secret CIA detention centres in Romania, Poland or any other country. Nevertheless, there are many indications from various sources which must be considered reliable, justifying the continuation of the analytical and investigative work. [86]\n\nSpain investigations\n\nIn November 2005, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that CIA planes had landed in the Canary Islands and in Palma de Mallorca. An attorney opened up an investigation concerning these landings which, according to Madrid, were made without official knowledge, thus being a breach of national sovereignty.[87][88][89]\n\nFrance investigations\n\nThe prosecutor of Bobigny court, in France, opened up an investigation in order to verify the presence in Le Bourget Airport, on July 20, 2005, of the plane numbered N50BH. This instruction was opened following a complaint deposed in December 2005 by the Ligue des droits de l’homme (LDH) NGO ( Human Rights League ) and the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) NGO on charges of arbitrary detention , crime of torture and non-respect of the rights of war prisoners . It has as objective to determine if the plane was used to transport CIA prisoners to Guantanamo Bay detainment camp and if the French authorities had knowledge of this stop. However, the lawyer defending the LDH declared that he was surprised that the judicial investigation was only opened on January 20, 2006, and that no verifications had been done before. On December 2, 2005, conservative newspaper Le Figaro had revealed the existence of two CIA planes that had landed in France, suspected of transporting CIA prisoners. But the instruction concerned only N50BH, which was a Gulfstream III, which would have landed at Le Bourget on July 20, 2005, coming from Oslo, Norway. The other suspected aircraft would have landed in Brest on March 31, 2002. It is investigated by the Canadian authorities, as it would have been flying from St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, via Keflavík in Iceland before going to Turkey [90].\n\nPortugal investigations\n\nPortugal opened an investigation concerning CIA flights in February 2007, on the basis of declarations by Socialist MEP Ana Gomes and by Rui Costa Pinto, a journalist for the Visão review. The Portuguese general prosecutor, Cândida Almeida, head of the Central Investigation and Penal Action Department ( DCIAP ), announced the opening of investigations on February 5, 2007. They center on the issue of torture or inhuman and cruel treatment, and are instigated by allegations of illegal activities and serious human rights violations made by MEP Ana Gomes to the attorney general, Pinto Monteiro, on January 26, 2007 [91].\n\nAna Gomes was highly critical of the Portuguese government’s reluctance to comply with the European Parliament Commission investigation into the CIA flights, leading to tensions with Foreign Minister Luís Amado, a member of the her party. She declared that she had no doubt that permission of these illegal flights were frequent during Durão Barroso (2002-2004) and Santana Lopes (2004-2005)’ governments, and that during the [Socialist] government of José Sócrates [2005-], 24 flights which passed through Portuguese territory are registered [92]. She has declared herself satisfied with the opening of the investigations, but underlined that she had always claimed that a parliamentary inquiry would be necessary [91].\n\nJournalist Rui Costa Pinto was heard by the DCIAP after having written an article, refused by Visão, about flights passing through Lajes Field in the Azores, a Portuguese airbase used by the US Air Force[91].\n\nApproximatively 150 CIA flights which have flown through Portugal have been identified. [93].\n\nOther European investigations\n\nReport regarding the Egyptian fax intercepted on 10 November 2005 by the Swiss Onyx interception system, as published in the Swiss press.\n\nThe European Union (EU) as well as the Council of Europe pledged to investigate the allegations. On November 25, 2005, the lead investigator for the Council of Europe, Swiss lawmaker Dick Marty announced that he had obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for suspected black sites, and he was planning to use satellite imagery over the last several years as part of his investigation. On November 28, 2005, EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini asserted that any EU country which had operated a secret prison would have its voting rights suspended.[94]\n\nOn 13 December 2005 Dick Marty, investigating illegal CIA activity in Europe on behalf of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, reported evidence that individuals had been abducted and transferred to other countries without respect for any legal standards . His investigation has found that no evidence exists establishing the existence of secret CIA prisons in Europe, but added that it was highly unlikely that European governments were unaware of the American program of renditions. However, Marty’s interim report, which was based largely on a compendium of press clippings has been harshly criticised by the governments of various EU member states.[95] The preliminary report declared that it was highly unlikely that European governments, or at least their intelligence services, were unaware of the CIA kidnapping of a hundred persons on European territory and their subsequent rendition to countries where they may be tortured [28].\n\nOn April 21, 2006 the New York Times reported that European investigators said they had not been able to find conclusive evidence of the existence of European black sites.[96]\n\nOn 27 June 2007, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted on Resolution 1562 and Recommendation 1801 backing the conclusions of the report by Dick Marty. The Assembly declared that it was established with a high degree of probability that secret detention centres had been operated by the CIA under the High Value Detainee (HVD) program for some years in Poland and Romania.[95]\n\nThe Onyx-intercepted fax\n\nIn its edition of January 8, 2006, the Swiss newspaper Sonntagsblick published a document intercepted on November 10 by the Swiss Onyx interception system (similar to the UKUSA’s ECHELON system). Purportedly sent by the Egyptian embassy in London to foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the document states that 23 Iraqi and Afghan citizens were interrogated at Mihail Koga(lniceanu base near Constant,a, Romania. According to the same document, similar interrogation centers exist in Bulgaria, Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, and Ukraine [50].\n\nThe Egyptian Foreign Ministry later explained that the intercepted fax was merely a review of the Romanian press done by the Egyptian Embassy in Bucharest. It probably referred to a statement by controversial Senator and Great Romania party leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor.[97]\n\nThe Swiss government did not officially confirm the existence of the report, but started a judiciary procedure for leakage of secret documents against the newspaper on 9 January 2006.\n\nThe European Parliament’s February 14, 2007 report\n\nThe European Parliament’s report, adopted by a large majority (382 MEPs voting in favour, 256 against and 74 abstaining) passed on February 14, 2007 concludes that many European countries tolerated illegal actions of the CIA including secret flights over their territories. The countries named were: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. [1]\n\nThe report…\n\ndenounces the lack of co-operation of many member states and of the Council of the European Union with the investigation, Regrets that European countries have been relinquishing control over their airspace and airports by turning a blind eye or admitting flights operated by the CIA which, on some occasions, were being used for illegal transportation of detainees; Calls for the closure of [the US military detention mission in] Guantanamo and for European countries immediately to seek the return of their citizens and residents who are being held illegally by the US authorities; Considers that all European countries should initiate independent investigations into all stopovers by civilian aircraft [hired by] the CIA; Urges that a ban or system of inspections be introduced for all CIA-operated aircraft known to have been involved in extraordinary rendition. [98][99]\n\nThe report criticized a number of European countries (including Austria, Italy, Poland, Portugal and the UK) for their unwillingness to co-operate with investigators.and the action of secret services for lack of cooperation with the Parliaments’ investigators and acceptal of the illegal abductions. The European Parliament voted a resolution condemning member states which accepted or ignore the practice. According to the report, the CIA had operated 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture. The Parliament also called for the creation of an independent investigation commission and the closure of Guantanamo camp. According to Italian Socialist Giovanni Fava, who drafted the document, there was a strong possibility that the intelligence obtained under the extraordinary rendition illegal program had been passed on to EU governments who were aware of how it was obtained. The report also uncovered the use of secret detention facilities used in Europe, including Romania and Poland. The report defines extraordinary renditions as instances where an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is illegally abducted, arrested and/or transferred into the custody of US officials and/or transported to another country for interrogation which, in the majority of cases involves incommunicado detention and torture .\n\nObama administration\n\nOn January 22, 2009 new US President Barack Obama signed an executive order requiring the CIA to use only the 19 interrogation methods outlined in the United States Army Field Manual unless the Attorney General with appropriate consultation provides further guidance. The order also provided that The CIA shall close as expeditiously as possible any detention facilities that it currently operates and shall not operate any such detention facility in the future.

It was established in order to study the effects of LSD on unconsenting individuals. Prostitutes on the CIA payroll were instructed to lure clients back to the safehouses, where they were surreptitiously plied with a wide range of substances, including LSD, and monitored behind one-way glass. Several significant operational techniques were developed in this theater, including extensive research into sexual blackmail, surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugs in field operations.\n\nThe safehouses were dramatically scaled back in 1962, following a report by CIA Inspector General John Earman that strongly recommended closing the facility. The San Francisco safehouses were closed in 1965, and the New York City safehouse soon followed in 1966.\n\nThe file destruction undertaken at the order of CIA Director Richard Helms and former MKULTRA chief Sidney Gottlieb in 1972 makes a full investigation of claims impossible. However, many records did survive the purge. News of the story began to leak following a landmark story by New York Times reporter Seymour Hersh on illegal CIA domestic surveillance. This report triggered Senate Subcommittee hearings which investigated MKULTRA, and brought Operation Midnight Climax to light.\n\nIn 2009 Strange Science LLC released a HD video series entitled Operation Midnight Climax, based on the CIA experiments of the same name. It starred Meredith Salenger, Todd Cahoon, and Quinton Flynn.\n\nReferences\n\n* Marks, John (1991). The Search for the Manchurian Candidate . W.W.

January 25, 1993 near the entrance of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) headquarters in Langley, Virginia where two CIA employees were killed and three others wounded. The perpetrator, Mir Aimal Kasi, shot CIA employees in their cars as they were waiting at a stoplight.\n\nKasi fled the country and was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, sparking a four year international manhunt. He was captured by FBI agents in Pakistan in 1997 and rendered back to the United States to stand trial. He admitted that he shot the victims of the attack, and was subsequently found guilty of capital and first-degree murder, and was executed by lethal injection in 2002.\n\nContents\n\n* 1 Background\n\n* 2 Shootings\n\n* 3 Investigation\n\n* 4 Capture and rendition\n\n* 5 Trial and execution\n\n* 6 Possible vendetta\n\n* 7 Execution\n\n* 8 Victims\n\n* 9 Memorials\n\no 9.1 Central Intelligence Agency memorial wall\n\no 9.2 Route 123 Memorial\n\no 9.3 Lansing Bennett Forest\n\n* 10 References\n\n* 11 See also\n\n* 12 External links\n\nBackground\n\nMir Aimal Kasi, shortly after his capture in 1997\n\nKasi (Arabic: ??? ????? ??????) was a Pakistani national, born in Quetta, Balochistan[1] on February 10, 1964,[2] and belonging to the Pashtun tribe of Kasi[1]. He went to the US in 1991, taking a substantial sum of cash he had inherited on the death of his father in 1989[1]. He travelled on forged papers he had purchased in Karachi, altering his name to Kansi , and later bought a fake green card in Miami[3]. He stayed with a Kashmiri friend, Zahed Mir[4], in his Reston, Virginia apartment, and invested in a courier firm[1] for which he also worked as a driver[5]. This work would be decisive in his choice of target: I used to pass this area almost every day and knew these two left-turning lanes [were] mostly people who work for CIA. [3]\n\nAccording to Kasi, his first thoughts of an attack came after the purchase of an AK-47 from a Chantilly gun store. The plan soon became more important than any other thing to [him]. [3]\n\nShootings\n\nAt around 8 a.m. on January 25, 1993, Kasi stopped his brown station wagon behind a number of vehicles waiting at a red traffic light on the eastbound side of Route 123, Fairfax County.[6] The vehicles were waiting to make a left turn into the main entrance of CIA headquarters. Kasi emerged from his vehicle with an AK-47 and proceeded to move among the lines of vehicles, firing into them. Within seconds, he had killed Lansing H. Bennett MD, 66, and Frank Darling, 28. Three others were left with gunshot wounds.[5] Darling was shot first and later received additional gunshot wounds to the head after Kasi shot the other victims.\n\nDuring his later confession, Kasi said that he’d only stopped firing because there wasn’t anybody else left to shoot , and that he only shot male passengers because it would be against [his] religion to shoot females .[5]\n\nHe was also surprised at the lack of an armed response: I thought I will be arrested, or maybe killed in a shootout with CIA guards or police. [3]\n\nKasi climbed back into his vehicle and drove to a nearby park. After 90 minutes of waiting, it became clear that he was not being actively sought and so he drove back to his Reston apartment[5]. He hid the assault rifle in a green plastic bag under a sofa, went to a McDonald’s for something to eat, and booked himself into a Days Inn for the night. The CNN news reports he watched made it clear that police had misidentified his vehicle and did not have his license plate number.[4] The next morning, he took a flight to Quetta, Pakistan.[1] According to Kasi, he killed American CIA people because, I was real angry with the policy of the U.S. government in the Middle East, particularly toward the Palestinian people, Kasi said in a prison interview with CNN affiliate WTTG.[7]\n\nInvestigation\n\nAn investigative task force (named Langmur for Langley murders ) was drawn together from both the FBI and local Fairfax County police. They began sifting through recent AK-47 purchases in Maryland and Virginia—there had been at least 1,600 over the previous year alone. Mir Aimal Kasi’s name was on the sales slip from a gun store in Chantilly, where he had exchanged another gun for the AK-47[4] just three days before the shootings.[5]\n\nThis information provided the first solid lead in the investigation when Kasi’s roommate, Zahed Mir, reported him missing two days after the shootings.[5] He also told police how Kasi would get angry watching CNN reports of attacks on Muslims[4] — in particular, Kasi would later cite the US attacks on Iraq, Israeli killings of Palestinians, and CIA involvement in Muslim countries.[3][5] Although Mir didn’t think much of it at the time, Kasi had said he wanted to do something big , with possible targets of the White House, the Israeli Embassy and the CIA.[4]\n\nA police search of Kasi’s apartment turned up the hidden AK-47 under the couch. Ballistics tests confirmed it was the weapon used in the shootings, and Kasi became the chief suspect of the investigation.[4]\n\nKasi was listed as one of the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.[8] The search was focused on Pakistan, and agents spent the next four years following hundreds of leads, taking them as far afield as Thailand, but to no avail.[4] Kasi would later reveal he had spent this time being sheltered by fellow Pashtun tribesmen, in the border regions of Afghanistan, making only brief visits to Pakistan.[3][5]\n\nCapture and rendition\n\nIn May 1997, an informant walked into the US consulate in Karachi and claimed he could help lead them to Kasi. As proof, he showed a copy of a driver license application made by Kasi under a false name but bearing his photograph. Apparently, the Pashtun tribals who had been sheltering Kasi were now prepared to accept the multi-million dollar reward offer for his capture.[9] Other sources claim they were pressured by the Pakistani government.[1]\n\nKasi was in the Afghan border regions, so the informant was told to lure Kasi into Pakistan where he could be more easily apprehended. Kasi was tempted with a lucrative business offer—smuggling Russian electronic goods into Pakistan—which brought him to Dera Ghazi Khan, in the Punjab province of Pakistan, where he checked into a room at Shalimar Hotel.[9]\n\nAt 4 a.m. on the morning of June 15, 1997, an armed team of FBI agents, working with the Pakistani ISI, raided Kasi’s hotel room. His fingerprints were taken on the scene, confirming his identity.\n\nThere is some dispute over where Kasi was taken next—US authorities claim it was a holding facility run by Pakistani authorities[5], while Pakistani sources claim it was the US embassy in Islamabad[9] — before being flown to the US on June 17 in a C-141 transport.[5][10]\n\nDuring the flight, Kasi made a full oral and written confession to the FBI.[5]\n\nKasi’s extrajudicial rendition was controversial in Pakistan—no formal request for his extradition was made, and no extradition proceedings were initiated.[10] US authorities would later assert the rendition was legal under an extradition treaty signed with the UK, before Partition when India was under colonial rule.[5] Kasi argued against his rendition in court but his assertions were found to have no basis in law. The Court wrote:\n\n…the treaty between the United States and Pakistan contains no provision that bars forcible abductions, nor does it otherwise ‘purport to specify the only way in which one country may gain custody of a national of the other country for the purposes of prosecution.’ Id. at 664 (emphasis added). Nor does the treaty provide that, once a request for extradition is made, the procedures outlined in the treaty become the sole means of transferring custody of a suspected criminal from one country to the other. Finally, because Kasi was not returned to the United States via extradition proceedings initiated under the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Pakistan, Kasi’s reliance upon United States v. Rauscher does not avail him.[11]\n\nTrial and execution\n\nOn February 16, 1993, Kasi, then a fugitive, had been charged in absentia. The charges involved capital murder of Darling, murder of Bennett, and three counts of malicious wounding for the other victims, along with related firearms charges.\n\nKasi was tried by a Virginia state court jury over a period of ten days in November 1997, on a plea of not guilty to all charges. The jury found him guilty, and fixed puni"
