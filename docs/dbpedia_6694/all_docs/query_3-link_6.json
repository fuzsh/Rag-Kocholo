        "text": "Press Release\n\n15 July 2024\n\nIsDB and FAO Join Hands to Rehabilitate Irrigation Systems and Improve Rural Livelihoods in Eastern Afghanistan\n\nJeddah/Rome. - A targeted grant from the Afghanistan Humanitarian Trust Fund (AHTF) will provide key support to communities in eastern Afghanistan, through the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), improving food security by rehabilitating climate-resilient irrigation structures to boost wheat production and establish fisheries.The USD 3 million contribution is provided by the Saudi Fund for Development through the AHTF, which is established by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and managed by the Islamic Development Bank, to support the people of Afghanistan.The amount, mostly spent on hard infrastructure, will be matched by FAO, making a total of USD 6.18 million available over the next two years for emergency and resilience activities in the eastern provinces of Laghman and Kunar. The matching funding by FAO will be used to stock and operate the fisheries, and to distribute wheat seeds and other crucial inputs, besides providing training.A main focus of the project is to restore three historical water canals in Eastern Afghanistan that date back to the last century and have presently lost much of their effectiveness.The project will rehabilitate 21km of canals in Nahr-e Karim, in Qarghayee district of Laghman, an area which provides many of the vegetables consumed in Kabul, as well as the Upper and Lower Sarkano canals in Kunar province, together about 18km.The canals were dug last century with pickaxes and shovels. Increasingly frequent flash floods have caused sedimentation and damage to canal intake, canal banks and side structures (canal outlets, cross-drainage structures etc.).Both canal systems currently service hundreds of hectares less than they were designed to and are susceptible to rapid further deterioration. Given the effects of climate change (longer dry and hot periods alternating with flash floods) it is urgent to rehabilitate these irrigation systems in densely populated areas.Funded by the IsDB-managed AHTF, these activities build both on FAO’s technical expertise in the field of Water Resources and Irrigation (WRI), and on FAO’s large-scale program to provide emergency relief to Afghan farmers.This timely funding by AHTF through the Islamic Development Bank and contributed by SFD will support communities in two of eastern Afghanistan’s key agricultural production areas. This support will not only address the populations’ immediate food security needs, but also take a holistic approach to solving the water problems which affect the area, laying the groundwork for more durable solutions and lasting improvements for food security and nutrition.With the help of local construction companies working under the supervision of FAO’s engineers, FAO will repair the canals to ensure irrigation to over 2 100 ha, benefiting around 10 500 households, at least 70 000 people.Of this group, 8 000 households will be directly supported with a wheat cultivation package, allowing them to grow enough wheat during at least three years to meet their family’s annual wheat requirements. Working in close collaboration with local communities, eight locations will be selected to establish fish farms. When operational, each fish farm is expected to produce 1.5 metric tons of fish per year, which at current prices is worth USD 6,000 – 7,000 on the market. The salary of a teacher, in comparison, is about USD 150 per month. Fish consumption will also improve nutrition within target communities.FAO engineers, hydrologists and technical specialists bring decades of experience in improving the collection and distribution of surface waters, critical skills in a drought-prone region such as Afghanistan.The project will draw on locally tested solutions, such as those pioneered by Dr. Tetsu Nakamura in Nangarhar, who brought 25 000 ha of land under cultivation by adapting old Japanese irrigation techniques to the culture and geography of the Eastern Region. FAO’s emergency relief program has reached 16 million people since it began in 2021, about half of Afghanistan’s rural population. It is designed to make farmers and rural communities self-sufficient, transitioning out of emergency assistance towards sustainable development by providing inputs and training. The improvements in Afghan food security have been noticeable: while 55% of the Afghan population was deemed to be in acute or emergency food insecurity in late 2021, by May 2024 that percentage had halved to 27% - despite the ongoing drought and economic crisis caused by the withdrawal of the international community after the Taliban takeover in August 2021.\n\n1 of 5\n\nPublication\n\n21 May 2024\n\nHumanitarian and Basic Human Needs Factsheet 2023\n\nThe 2023 Factsheet centers on the results achieved with UN-supported interventions responding to the humanitarian and basic human needs of people in Afghanistan. In July 2023, the UN Country Team adopted the United Nations Strategic Framework for Afghanistan (UNSFA) 2023–2025, replacing its previous Transitional Engagement Framework (TEF, January 2022 to June 2023). As a multi-year framework, the UNSFA allows to address sustainably the Afghan people’s large-scale basic human needs and to reduce the medium- and long-term humanitarian caseload.\n\n1 of 5\n\nPublication\n\n18 April 2024\n\n2023 UN Afghanistan Annual Results Report\n\nThe year 2023 has been one of tremendous challenges but also one of resilience and determination. In the face of adversity and multiple concurrent shocks, the people of Afghanistan have demonstrated remarkable courage and strength. This annual report serves as a testament to our ongoing commitment to the people of Afghanistan and our unwavering support for their journey towards peace, stability, and prosperity. It also reflects the tireless efforts of the United Nations and its partners to address the complex and multifaceted challenges facing the country. Due to the international assistance community’s concerted efforts, levels of support to Afghanistan remained significant. With our partners, we remained engaged despite unprecedented impediments that have shaken our core values and beliefs. In 2023, we continued to grapple with the challenges of upholding our core principles and values and simultaneously delivering on the imperative to assist people in need. The tremendous efforts and tenacity of all partners involved have shown the incredible creativity and perseverance of assistance partners who were determined not to leave the Afghan people alone. I am proud to be a representative of this extraordinary community. Afghans now mention access to food as their most pressing need. Unable to pay for or produce basic sustenance, millions face hunger and malnutrition. In 2024, an estimated 15.8 million people will experience crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity. The majority of the population is unable to procure basic needs such as healthcare, food, livelihoods, and housing. A Gallup poll found that 95 per cent of the population consider themselves to be suffering. Average life expectancy has been falling for the past five years. The Herat earthquakes and unprecedented large-scale returns from neighbouring countries have shown the disruptive impact of recurrent shocks and underscored the need for sustained international engagement and support. As we embark on the next chapter, in 2024, it is imperative that we remain steadfast in our commitment to the principles of human rights, gender equality, and women’s empowerment. We will continue to include women as key partners in our work, to provide assistance “by women, for women”, and to tirelessly work for equal access to education in line with the demands we hear from Afghans in all areas of the country. I would like to express my gratitude to the United Nations agencies, our partners from the International Financial Institutions such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), bilateral and multilateral donors and assistance partners, non-governmental organizations, and all those who continue to support the people of Afghanistan. I further express my deep gratitude to our Afghan partners, especially the Afghan women, who remind us daily of our responsibility to assist and empower them as they lead the course for a better future for themselves and their children. Your dedication and perseverance inspire us all. Indrika Ratwatte Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator\n\n1 of 5\n\nPublication\n\n20 February 2024\n\nHerat Earthquakes 2023 Post-Disaster Needs Assessment\n\nThe United Nations – together with the World Bank, the European Union, and the Asian Development Bank - has released a comprehensive Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) report for Afghanistan's Herat Province, hit by devastating earthquakes in October 2023. The report highlights the scale of the disaster: direct physical damage up to US$ 217 million and losses reaching US$ 78.9 million. The assessment underscores an urgent need for US$ 402.9 million to support the critical recovery and reconstruction efforts in the province. Besides assessing damage, losses, and recovery and reconstruction needs, the assessment evaluates broader macro-economic and human impacts and proposes principles for a comprehensive recovery and reconstruction framework. It cautions about persistent widespread poverty, slow economic recovery, job scarcity, banking sector instability, adverse impact on mental health and wellbeing, and climate vulnerability, exacerbating Afghanistan's ongoing economic challenges. The PDNA emphasizes the critical need to transition from immediate humanitarian aid to long-term recovery. Recovery strategies should prioritize building community resilience, service restoration, earthquake-safe housing, livelihoods options, social protection, and access to basic services, especially for the most affected families. The PDNA supports principles of building back better, emphasising women's empowerment and reducing disaster risks and enhancing climate resilience. This first-of-its-kind, multi-partner joint assessment since August 2021 showcases an international resolve to address the needs of disaster-affected communities and support their recovery. The assessment – launched in October 2023 – relied on field data, publicly available information, and remote sensing analytics.\n\n1 of 5\n\nPublication\n\n02 July 2023\n\nUnited Nations Strategic Framework for Afghanistan\n\nThe past several years have been extremely challenging for the people of Afghanistan. Already suffering from decades of conflict and instability, Afghanistan’s human rights, governance, humanitarian, and development situations deteriorated sharply after the Taliban takeover in August 2021. This transition impacted not only the political and security situations but also had particularly severe implications for human rights, gender equality, and women’s empowerment. The country’s economy contracted by about 30 per cent between 2020 and 2022. With 24.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and more than 9 in 10 living in poverty, the country is in the midst of a crisis on an unprecedented scale. The United Nations and its partners recognize that humanitarian aid alone will not be enough to sustainably address the large-scale and increasing human suffering of the Afghan people in the medium and long term. As such, humanitarian efforts should be complemented and reinforced with interventions addressing basic human needs that aim to reduce the humanitarian caseload over time and support Afghans, particularly women, girls, and other vulnerable groups, to a) build resilience to shocks, b) sustain livelihoods, c) protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, d) strengthen social cohesion and build social capital, and e) preserve hard-won development gains achieved over the past two decades, including with regard to service delivery. This approach is also important for the identification and achievement of durable solutions to displacement caused by conflict, climate change, and sudden onset natural disasters. In close consultations with our Member States, partners, and stakeholders, the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) has identified three complementary and mutually reinforcing joint priorities as it supports the basic human needs of the Afghan people. Priority 1: Sustained Essential Services Priority 2: Economic Opportunities and Resilient Livelihoods Priority 3: Social Cohesion, Inclusion, Gender Equality, Human Rights, and Rule of Law With the Humanitarian Country Team, the UNCT has also agreed on two collective outcomes: to 1) reduce food insecurity and 2) reduce maternal and child mortality rates. Partners across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus have agreed to work together toward these outcomes. The United Nations Strategic Framework for Afghanistan articulates the UN’s approach to addressing basic human needs in Afghanistan. Anchored in the principle of leaving no one behind, the UN Strategic Framework prioritizes the needs and rights of those most vulnerable and marginalized, including women and girls, children and youth, internally displaced persons, returnees, refugees, ethnic and religious minorities, geographically isolated communities, sexual and gender minorities, the Kuchi community, persons with disabilities, human rights defenders, people who use drugs, and people living with and affected by HIV. This Strategic Framework is an offer of assistance to the people of Afghanistan. Whether the UN can implement this framework depends in part on external factors, most notably on actions by the de facto authorities and on donor support. The UN expects to be deeply engaged in maintaining and expanding the access and operational space necessary for implementation.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n30 July 2024\n\nStories of Resilience: Three Lives, One Project\n\nAfghanistan is one of the top 10 countries experiencing extreme weather patterns. This, against a backdrop of decades of war and numerous social and economic shocks, has left over 23 million people in need. Three lives Mumtaz, Kabul“I used to be a teacher, as well as three of my daughters. But because of the restrictions, we cannot do that anymore.”For decades Mumtaz’s income as a math and science teacher fully supported her family of five, following an illness that prevented her husband from working. Mumtaz’s three daughters followed in their mother’s footsteps, supporting the growing household.Recent restrictions on education and employment opportunities for women and girls have rolled back two decades of gender rights advances. Past the sixth grade, girls are banned from accessing an education. For women, employment with non-governmental organizations is denied and they are wholly excluded from public office.\n\nOvernight, Mumtaz and her daughters lost their source of income, joining 94 per cent of the women in the country outside the workforce. Ahmad, Baghlan province“The floods destroyed the canal I use to irrigate my lands so I could not cultivate anything and this put my family in a very difficult economic position.”Approximately 85 per cent of Afghans rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. Yet across this landlocked country, with temperatures that range between -20°C and +45°C, early frost and unpredictable precipitation patterns can greatly impact production – alter lands that so many depend upon to graze cattle and cultivate crops.\n\nBefore the 2023 floods, Ahmad grew enough to feed his family every day and sell some produce for an additional income.Overnight, Ahmad's family joined the 15 million people across the country who are food insecure.\n\nZeyba, Khost province“We are a total of seven members in our family. It has been three months since we have moved from Pakistan to Afghanistan after 40 years. I was even born in Pakistan. We have been working very hard for our family’s survival for the past three months.”October 2023 saw the start of the forced repatriation of Afghans residing in Pakistan. Women and children – extremely vulnerable groups in Afghanistan – make up the majority of returning Afghans. Many of the people returning have never lived in Afghanistan, further complicating their adjustment and ability to integrate into one of the world’s least-developed countries – amid a major humanitarian crisis.Overnight, Zeyba’s family joined over six million already internally displaced people in Afghanistan. One projectAmid intensifying needs, the World Bank and the Afghanistan Resilience Trust Fund initiated the UNOPS-managed Afghanistan Community Resilience and Livelihoods Project (CRLP).Managed by UNOPS, the initiative provides short-term employment, offering a lifeline for vulnerable households, with the benefits of the work activities extending to entire communities. Social grants are also extended to particularly vulnerable households unable to participate in work, prioritizing women-headed households, people with disabilities and those suffering from drug addiction.Community engagement is a cornerstone of the project – and has long been a powerful vehicle for development interventions in Afghanistan. As such, the initiative invites Afghan people – via community representatives – to select work activities, manage labourers and provide channels for grievances.And from a climate perspective, the project assesses any potential activity against key environmental and social considerations before a final selection is made. A shared experienceLiving in three different provinces, Mumtaz, Ahmad and Zeyba all found opportunities with the project. Mumtaz“This was a good chance to find a job in very difficult times for women. At least now we have a bit of time to see what else we can find. This is not a permanent solution and it will not solve all of our problems but we are happy as women that we can put food on the table.”Mumtaz worked as a short-term labourer, helping to construct a green park in Kabul. She worked on-site helping cure cement and clean up after construction – earning approximately $6.30 a day for a month. By early June 2024, sub-projects have included nearly 60,000 women labourers. While this is a high number, it still represents less than 12 per cent of the total urban labourers and close to 7 per cent of rural labourers. Looking ahead, the project is committed to reaching more women. Ahmad“Now that the canal has been fixed, I will be able to grow on my land again next year. I even helped to repair the canal, which I was happy about doing for my village.”In his village in the Baghlan Province, Ahmad worked on a project that the local community council identified as being important for the lives of the people who lived there.Since the start of the project, over 7,500 activities in urban and rural areas across the country have helped put in place infrastructure that allows local communities to better adapt to a changing climate. Work ranges from the construction of protection walls to the building and rehabilitation of canal networks. Zeyba“One of the CRLP projects was ongoing near my home. I sent my son to speak to the engineers in the project and tell our story. Then they welcomed him and arranged for him to join the work. At least it is a start for settling back in Afghanistan.”With the unexpected return of millions of Afghans from Pakistan – many vulnerable and in need – the resilience of communities and their ability to support those in need was tested. Within the CRL project, they rose to the challenge. Working as intended, the community representatives recognized the vulnerability of this incoming group during their needs mapping. Returning Afghans were able to connect within their new community and register as part of the project.\n\nDISCLAIMERAll images featured in this article were generated with the help of artificial intelligence tools.

More about the projectThe Afghanistan Community Resilience and Livelihoods Project is a $419 million initiative funded by the World Bank and the Afghanistan Resilience Trust Fund, managed by UNOPS. Working directly with more than 9,000 communities, the project is set to benefit over 14 million Afghans, across 10 cities, 29 provinces and 98 rural districts. It aims to create approximately 42 million labour days and support more than 1.3 million households.\n\nRead more about the project via the World Bank.\n\nThis article first appeared in UNOPS.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n28 June 2024\n\nBeyond Aid: “Delivering as One” to Build a Resilient Afghanistan\n\nAfghanistan presents one of the most compelling portraits of the complex tapestry of global polycrisis. Amid socio-economic deterioration, exacerbated by natural disasters including droughts, floods, and earthquakes, and massive displacement, Afghanistan’s challenges require not only a coordinated humanitarian response but also long-term durable solutions for development and peace. This is where the UN and partners’ joined-up approach indispensable. The Scale of CrisisSince the Taliban takeover in 2021, a diminishing flow of international aid has made service delivery to the Afghan people more challenging. Afghanistan has one of the highest numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) globally including a significant surge of over half a million Afghan returnees Pakistan, further straining the country's limited resources. Having visited IDPs and returnees’ temporary camps, I have witnessed first-hand the precarious conditions that they are living in including lack of access to basic services such as safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, healthcare, and jobs. Afghanistan ranks as the world's seventh most vulnerable country to climate change despite contributing minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions. Natural disasters are becoming a major threat for Afghanistan as floods, earthquakes, and droughts deal major blows for communities with limited capacity to respond to and recover from these shocks. The 2023 earthquakes in Herat, which claimed over 1,500 lives and displaced thousands more, have exposed the country’s vulnerabilities to climate shocks. The Plight of Afghan Women and GirlsPerhaps no group is more vulnerable in Afghanistan today than women and girls. Since August 2021, the De facto authorities have issued and expanded more than 50 edicts targeting women and girls, alongside several inconsistently enforced provincial-level decrees and practices, restricting the basic rights and fundamental freedoms of women. The exclusion of women from education beyond grade 6 as a human rights violation not only diminishes the economic stability of women and their families but also deprives the society of skilled contributors in all sectors. Without access to continued education, an entire generation of girls will be unable to pursue careers in medicine, engineering, or academia, fields that are crucial for Afghanistan’s future development. Why ”Delivering as One” through a joined-up approach?To streamline and synergize the efforts of various United Nations organizations operating in Afghanistan, where humanitarian needs are vast and complex, the Delivering as One (DaO) approach ensures that the collective expertise and resources of the UN are leveraged more effectively. By pooling resources and aligning strategies, we can address the multifaceted challenges of humanitarian aid, development, and peacebuilding (HDP) in a cohesive manner within the HDP nexus. As the world and UN gear toward the “Summit of the Future” this year to strengthen international cooperation and multilateralism, the DaO approach has been a critical example to showcase the effectiveness of coordination and collaboration of multiple donors and UN organizations in addressing complex challenges like those faced in Afghanistan.The benefit of this approach is exemplified by the Special Trust Fund for Afghanistan (STFA), which the UN launched in 2021. The STFA is already showing a positive impact of DaO by delivering a more coherent response to the HDP nexus needs in Afghanistan. Focusing on Basic Human Needs and Durable SolutionsAddressing basic human needs in Afghanistan is not merely about providing temporary relief but about establishing the foundations for long-term resilience and development. By 2024, the STFA has mobilized over US$230 million from 13 contributing donors, providing crucial support to approximately five million Afghans, particularly focusing on women and vulnerable groups. 17 UN organizations have come together to deliver the support through joint programmes.The support for basic human needs must also include durable solutions for the IDPs and returnees. This means not only meeting immediate needs such as food, water, and shelter but also providing access to education, healthcare, and livelihood opportunities. These are essential for their reintegration into society, reducing dependency on aid, and laying the groundwork for long-term development.A Call for Sustained International Attention and SupportAs global attention fluctuates with increasing conflicts and wars around the world, Afghanistan risks becoming a forgotten crisis, yet the needs of its people are more pressing than ever. We call on the international community and donor partners to renew their commitment to the people in Afghanistan, to mitigate the current humanitarian crisis and support a strategy that bridges humanitarian aid with development and peace efforts. “Delivering as One” through a joined-up approach is as necessary as efficient to address the complex challenges: Through our unified efforts, support for basic human needs, and a focus on durable solutions for the displaced, particularly women and girls, we can help build the resilience of people in Afghanistan.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n13 March 2024\n\nInvesting in Afghanistan's Women is more critical than ever\n\nAfghanistan's people have faced extraordinary hardship in recent years. Decades of conflict compounded by natural disasters and the impacts of climate change have brought immense suffering – particularly for women, whose rights have eroded significantly. As UN Resident Coordinator and on behalf of the UN team on the ground, I reiterate our commitment to maintain our focus on strengthening investments for women in Afghanistan – support that is more critical than ever.Delivering as One in Afghanistan: The Special Trust FundIn October 2021, the UN established the Special Trust Fund for Afghanistan (STFA). Under the leadership of the Resident Coordinator, this fund aims to meet urgent human needs across the country while complementing ongoing humanitarian efforts. By pooling resources, it directly supports the most vulnerable Afghans and actively champions women's rights.Since its creation, the Fund has been a powerful tool for joined up, cross-agency action. It brings together the diverse strengths of 17 UN agencies, funds, and programmes, allowing us to work collaboratively. The Fund promotes comprehensive local solutions that span from essential services to livelihoods and risk management. It supports programmes aligned with the United Nations Strategic Framework for Afghanistan 2023-2025, aiming to make a real difference in people's lives.As Resident Coordinator, my office and I play a crucial role in driving this unified effort, drawing on the shared plan outlined in the Strategic Framework. In my role as Humanitarian Coordinator alongside the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, we combine our resources to deliver the support Afghans desperately need, avoiding unnecessary duplication and maximizing our impact. Our approach is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the ever-changing situation in Afghanistan.Focus on women and girlsThe UN team in Afghanistan uses the Fund to tackle complex issues with an approach that empowers women as agents of positive change, precisely to tackle the dire constraints for women and girls in the countries. Gender equality is central to our work. With the unprecedented challenges Afghan women and girls face, we follow a “by women, for women” approach – prioritizing women-led initiatives and giving them the tools to succeed. Since 2021, the Fund has supported over 1.67 million women across Afghanistan.For example, the Fund has enabled the creation of more than 90 ‘Family Health Houses’ – community clinics staffed by local midwives who offer essential reproductive, maternal, and child health care. Access to these services gives women greater control over their health, their lives, and their futures.\n\nBeyond health, the Fund supports education. Afghanistan’s female literacy rate sits at a worrying 23 per cent – even lower in rural areas. To combat this, the Fund enables local programmes that teach literacy, numeracy, and various income-generating skills. These initiatives create opportunities, improve health, and help manage risks in the community.Since economic independence is crucial for women, the Fund targets micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) owned by women. With access to capital, skills, and markets, women entrepreneurs can thrive. Even as employment opportunities are restricted, women-led businesses help meet families’ needs and strengthen the overall economy. Remarkably, over 70 per cent of MSMEs supported by the Fund are women-owned, a testament to the impact of direct investment. This represents over 3,200 enterprises able to sustain or grow operations and employ more people, including women, in their communities.As with the rest of the world, natural disasters weigh heavily on Afghanistan, disproportionately affecting women. The Fund promotes climate-resilient infrastructure, like water systems, clinics, and shelters, with women at the forefront of decision-making to ensure their needs are prioritized.Opening doors, overcoming challengesThe UN’s work in Afghanistan is fraught with challenges, especially restrictions affecting women’s roles in local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). But we remain firm in our commitment. While we adapt our methods, we will not compromise our core principles of non-discrimination and women’s meaningful involvement in their country’s progress.Women-led organizations such as NGOs, MSMEs and others are vital for women and girls’ participation, leadership, and essential services, especially in contexts like Afghanistan. Therefore, a core priority for the Fund in 2024-2025 is to further invest in women’s empowerment by supporting these organizations. Our focus includes long-term solutions for internally displaced persons and returnees and aid for post-earthquake recovery in western Afghanistan. Our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remains unwavering, especially noting that investing in women and girls plays a catalytic role in boosting gains across all Goals. The Special Trust Fund illustrates how the Resident Coordinator's Office can bridge immediate and long-term needs while supporting peacebuilding efforts. It offers both immediate relief and long-term solutions driven by the communities themselves. Though progress has been made, we must scale up investments in women, as donor support, unfortunately, shows a declining trend.I am inspired daily by the courage of the Afghan people, especially the women who tirelessly fight for a better future. The UN remains steadfast in its pledge to ensure that Afghan women and girls can fully reclaim their rights. The world must stand with them.This blog was written by the UN Deputy Special Representative, Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan, Mr. Indrika Ratwatte.\n\n1 of 5\n\nStory\n\n20 January 2024\n\nAfghanistan's recovery hinges on international assistance, reviving productive sectors and reinstating women's rights\n\nKabul, 18 January 2024 – UNDP Afghanistan released new data today in a report depicting a bleak socio-economic scenario in the country, since August 2021. Restrictions on women's rights and an almost collapsed banking system are identified as major areas of concern, needing international cooperation. Analyzing the latest macro and household-level data, the report reveals some progress in certain areas, - including overall macro-economic stability, security, and control of opium production and illicit trade - but notes that it has not been enough to change the country’s trajectory. Moreover, seven out of ten Afghans are unable to fulfil their basic needs for food, healthcare, employment and other daily requirements. The report, titled “Two Years in Review: Changes in Afghan Economy, Households and Cross Cutting Sectors”, shows that the Afghan economy has not recovered from the significant shrinkage experienced since 2020, and appears to be stabilizing at a very low level of economic activity with high poverty and unemployment levels. Among the key reasons for this are the restrictions on the banking sector, trade disruptions, weakened and isolated public institutions, and lack of foreign investment and donor support for the productive sectors – such as agriculture and manufacturing. Public institutions, particularly in the economic sector, continue losing technical expertise and capabilities, including women employees, further exacerbating challenges. The report also adds that the humanitarian and economic crises and restrictions on women’s rights have had a severe impact on the country’s female population. It notes that in addition to having limited access to public spaces, women now consume less food, and are experiencing greater income inequality compared to men. Alarmingly, the proportion of women in employment across all sectors has dropped dramatically, nearly halving from 11% in 2022 to just 6% in 2023. Introducing the Subsistence-Insecurity Index (SII), the report utilises 17 non-monetary indicators across three dimensions to measure deprivation. It highlights that 69 percent of Afghans are subsistence insecure and face a scarcity of essential amenities such as healthcare, basic goods, living conditions, and employment opportunities. “International assistance has helped save millions of Afghans from starvation, sustained delivery of essential social services, and ensured the continuation of hundreds of thousands of livelihoods,” said Stephen Rodriques, UNDP Resident Representative in Afghanistan. “However, humanitarian assistance is declining at a time when an overwhelming majority of the Afghan population remain highly vulnerable, and subsistence-insecurities remain very high. The assistance and efforts require complementary investment to stimulate the recovery of the private sector, financial system, and overall production capacity of the economy.” The report stresses the need to address challenges in the banking system, including the microfinance sector, which is crucial for financing women-led micro and small enterprises that have experienced a 60% contraction since 2021. Urgent remedial actions are essential to prevent further decline. To sustain livelihoods and foster lasting recovery and prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable, particularly women and girls, the report calls for a comprehensive approach, that would integrate local economic development, resilience against shocks, and robust private sector-led growth. Women’s economic participation must be at the forefront of any efforts aimed at addressing the crises in Afghanistan. The two years in review report is available online.

As the UN intensified its support for the Afghan population, mis-disinformation and unfounded criticisms about the organization began to circulate. In today's digital era, false information can rapidly propagate, leading to confusion and eroding trust. The United Nations Resident Coordination Office in Afghanistan recognized the importance of countering false narratives and embarked on joint field missions with local media and journalists to highlight the impact of the UN’s work on the daily lives of Afghan people. Afghanistan has a population of approximately 43 million, with less than half actively engaging on social media platforms. Given that much of the information regarding UN programs is disseminated online, connecting with the broader Afghan people presents a considerable challenge. However, nearly every household in Afghanistan possesses a television or, at the very least, a radio. Recognizing this media landscape, the UN Resident Coordination Office in Afghanistan made a strategic decision to collaborate with local radio and television stations. This partnership involved conducting joint field visits to diverse UN project sites, facilitating direct access for media representatives and journalists to interact with beneficiaries of UN assistance. Consequently, this approach ensures the accurate, precise, and factual transmission of information about UN activities to the community through various media channels. In early November, many Afghans returning from Pakistan found themselves in dire circumstances, further exacerbating the humanitarian challenges within Afghanistan. UN agencies coordinated and facilitated media visits to the border region to heighten the awareness of humanitarian services for the returnees. A total of 10 local media outlets actively participated in this field visit, obtaining direct access to better understand the UN's humanitarian efforts. Concurrently, local media such as Tolo News, Ariana News, Pajhwok Afghan News, and Kilid Media gained direct access to first-hand information, concrete facts, and pertinent figures. This access enabled them to portray an authentic depiction of the substantial humanitarian support extended to returnees, with a particular focus on women and children who constitute 80 Percent of the returnee caseload. The Power of Media Collaboration “It was my first joint field mission with the United Nations dedicated to compiling a report tailored for my local audiences,” expressed a journalist from Balkh, a Northern province of Afghanistan. Reflecting on the experience, one of his journalist colleagues remarked “This opportunity offered a unique glimpse into project sites, enabling us to report firsthand on the tangible impact of the UN's humanitarian services. Such coordinated efforts are invaluable for fostering improved access to information, and we hope for continued collaboration in the future.\" The United Nations in Afghanistan is committed to upholding transparency and accountability in its assistance endeavors, aiming to cultivate a responsible media landscape and generate a constructive influence on the lives of the Afghan people. Ensuring access to verified and reliable information is a fundamental right, and collaborative efforts with the media play a pivotal role in fortifying public perception while mitigating the dissemination of mis-and disinformation. Such coordinated initiatives are crucial in promoting an environment where accurate information prevails, empowering beneficiaries to tell their own story as well as the Afghan community with factual insights to foster trust in humanitarian efforts.\n\n1 of 5"
