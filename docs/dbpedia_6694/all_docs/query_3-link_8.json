Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Afghans evacuated to the United States are living in legal limbo with no viable pathway toward permanent residency.\n\nWhat Must Be Done?\n\nWorld leaders and governments must act swiftly to ensure Afghans’ humanitarian needs are met. The U.S. Congress must urgently pass the Afghan Adjustment Act, legislation to create a path to permanent residency for Afghans in the United States. And Afghan refugee leaders must have a seat at the policy table. Take action now.\n\n“They Left Us Without Any Support”: Afghans in Pakistan Waiting for Solutions\n\nFit for Purpose: Getting Humanitarian Aid Right in Afghanistan One Year after the Taliban Takeover\n\nFutures In The Balance: Taking Action To Ensure Afghan Women’s and Girls’ Rights Under Taliban Rule"
