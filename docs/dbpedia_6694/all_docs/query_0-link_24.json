It was the successor to the famous T-34. Fewer than two thousand T-44s were built, but the design became the basis for the T-54/55 series of main battle tanks, the most-produced tank of all time.\n\nDevelopment history Genesis By the end of 1940, when production of the T-34 started,[2][3] there were already plans to improve the vehicle's reliability and operational capabilities by adopting more modern technology.[4] This design project was designated T-34M.[4] It had enhanced armour protection,[2] a three-man hexagonal turret, torsion bar suspension instead of Christie suspension, road wheels with internal shock absorption,[2] increased fuel capacity,[2] and more main gun ammunition (100 rounds instead of 77 in standard T-34).[2][2][5] The bow machine gun and driver's hatch switched positions on the glacis plate. In addition to six smaller wheels,[5] the suspension of the T-34M had four return rollers. The original model V-2 12-cylinder diesel engine developing 500 hp (373 kW) was replaced by a new 12-cylinder diesel engine which produced 600 horsepower (450 kW).[5][6] It had a new 8-speed transmission system.[5] It was the first tank design to feature transverse engine placement, which made it smaller than a standard T-34 and gave the crew more space.[5] The Zhdanov Metallurgical Factory manufactured five sets of armour plates for the hull of the T-34M[2] and delivered them to Factory No. 183.[2] However, early in 1941 work on the T-34M ceased[2] as the production facilities were extremely busy with the mass production of the T-34.[2] When the war with Nazi Germany broke out the only sensible solution was to gradually improve the existing design.[3] During the battles on the Eastern Front it became apparent that the Red Army needed a new medium tank.[5] They requested that it should have better protection at a minimal increase of weight.[5][6] In 1942 the T-43 tank design project began. It featured a new turret and shorter suspension which reduced the clearance between the roadwheels.[5] However, it concentrated on increasing armour at a time when maintaining production and increasing firepower were more important. The T-43 was cancelled, but its new turret design was adapted to carry a larger 85 mm D-5T and later ZiS-S-53 gun in a new variant called the T-34-85. It marked the end of T-34 improvements as fitting 100 mm guns in T-34-100[5] prototypes proved unfeasible. (See T-34 variants article for details).[1][3]\n\nT-34-85\n\nT-44\n\n3\n\nPrototypes First generation In the autumn of 1943 the design bureau of the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, located in Nizhny Tagil (in the Ural Mountains, where most of the Soviet tank industry had been evacuated after Operation Barbarossa in 1941), started working on a vehicle that would have improvement opportunities in the future, under a direct order from Joseph Stalin.[7] The intention was to retain the high mobility of the T-34 and provide it with heavier armour protection against modern tank guns. In November 1943, the chief designer, A. A. Morozov, presented the overall design of the vehicle and a model of the tank, which received the designation T-44 (Ob'yekt 136). The first prototype was completed by January 1944 and two more were completed in February. The first two prototypes were armed with 85 mm D-5T guns and received the designation T-44-85, while the third prototype was armed with the 122 mm D-25-44T tank gun and received the designation T-44-122. The D-25-44T tank gun was very similar to the basic D-25 field gun, but differed in some minor details including fixed single-piece ammunition to increase the rate of fire and a double-baffle muzzle brake.[1][8] What allowed fitting such powerful armament in a medium tank weighing 30 tonnes was the construction of the hull with an innovative placement of the engine. Unlike most tanks, in the T-44 the engine was placed perpendicular to the axis of the tank. The hull was designed without sponsons. It was also much wider which made the crew compartment bigger and allowed the turret to be placed over the center part of the vehicle.[1] This reduced the overall length of the vehicle. The thickness of the armour was 75 mm on the front of the hull and 90 mm on the front of the turret. The side armour was 45 mm thick and could be reinforced by 30 mm thick additional armour plate. All three prototypes were powered by the V-2IS diesel engine which developed 500 hp (373 kW). This first generation of prototypes featured a raised cast driver's hatch with an opening vision flap as well as mounting bolts in a ring around the base of the gun tube.[1][3][8] Morozov's new medium tank design received a sceptical response.[9] It was believed that putting a high-speed 12-cylinder engine with a working displacement of almost 40 liters perpendicular to the direction of travel would cause problems, including breaking the connecting rods.[9] It was believed that decreasing the displacement of the engine compartment for the purpose of enlarging the fighting compartment was unnecessary and that moving the turret rearwards would limit the elevation angle of the main gun. However, it turned out that even though rotating the engine complicated the transmission by introducing an additional reduction gear - gear-train and fan drive, it also solved many problems. The cover of the engine and transmission compartment turned along with the radiator; this allowed easier access to the engine, transmission and batteries. The significant decrease in the length of the engine compartment allowed the turret to be moved rearwards, which in turn moved its rotation axis and the center of mass[10] to the center of the hull, increased the accuracy of the main gun[1] and decreased a chance that the turret could get stuck after getting hit in the turret ring with a projectile that ricocheted.[10] The thickness of the frontal armor protection more than doubled without disturbing the center of mass or drastically increasing the weight of the tank. At the beginning of World War II the thickness of T-34 armor was considered enough. Improvements made to the T-34 during World War II included increasing the caliber of the gun (from 76.2 mm to 85 mm) and thickening the armor of the turret. No significant improvements were made to the hull. Increasing the size of the fighting compartment allowed the removal of floor ammunition stowage. The height of the tank was decreased by 300 mm, even though the turret remained almost the same. Removal of the conical pair in the transmission permitted fitting a more compact gear box and improved the control of the brakes and the steering clutch. Visibility from the driver's position was improved. The driver was protected from being splashed by water while the vehicle was fording.[9] The new torsion bar suspension allowed easier crossing of rough ground.[9]\n\nT-44\n\n4 Second generation\n\nT-44-122 prototype during comparative trials against captured German Panther\n\nSecond of the two first generation T-44-85 prototypes and T-44-122 prototype during comparative trials\n\nSecond generation T-44-85 prototype during trials. Notice that this one does not have the splashboard.\n\nThe first trials of the T-44-122 prototype took place in February and March 1944, but were unsuccessful due to gun failure, and the gun was returned to the No. 9 factory for repair. In April and May 1944 the trials were resumed. Aside from standard trials, the T-44-122 was put in competitive trials against the captured German Panzerkampfwagen V Panther medium tank[1] and the second of two first generation T-44-85 prototypes.[1] The practical rate of fire was two to three rounds per minute due to the cramped turret and long, heavy ammunition.[1] The vehicle had a very limited storage of only 24 rounds and this was considered insufficient for a medium tank. As a result all further development of the T-44-122 prototype was cancelled.[1][3][8] Like the T-44-122 prototype, one of the two first-generation T-44-85 prototypes went through competitive trials against the captured German Panzerkampfwagen V Panther medium tank.[1] The second of the two first-generation T-44-85 prototypes was put in competitive trials against the T-44-122 prototype.[1] The second prototype uncovered additional faults in the design. By May 1944 two second-generation prototypes were being built. These featured the driver's position moved rearwards so that his hatch was partially on the hull roof. The driver's vision flap was reduced to a plain square flap with rounded lower corners, in line with the glacis plate. These prototypes had prominent collars at the base of the gun tube, without the mounting bolts which were present in the first generation prototypes. The two prototypes also have differences between each other.[8] One prototype had a splashboard on the glacis plate[8] while the other had a smooth uncluttered glacis plate.[8] One of these prototypes passed trials at the NIBT proving grounds near Kubinka in June and July 1944. This prototype weighed 31.3 tonnes and was armed with an 85 mm ZiS-S-53 gun. The turret front armour thickness was increased to 115 mm. Hulls side armour thickness was increased to 75 mm.[3][8]\n\nT-44A The third generation prototype, which received the designation T-44A, was completed after the Morozov Design Bureau had moved back to Second generation T-44-85 prototype during trials at NIBT proving grounds near Kubinka, Kharkiv in Ukraine. The hull upper front armour (glacis plate) summer 1944. Notice driver's vision flap was thickness was increased to 90 mm and the turret front armour thickness reduced to a plain square flap with rounded lower was increased to 120 mm. Even though it was more heavily armoured, corners, in line with the glacis plate, a prominent the weight went down to 30.7 tonnes. This vehicle had a new V-44 collar at the base of the gun tube and the splashboard on the glacis plate. 12-cylinder 4-stroke diesel engine of 520 hp (388 kW) at 1,800 rpm, which allowed the tank to travel at a speed of 60.5 km/h. This prototype had the splashboard on the glacis plate like one of the second generation T-44-85 prototypes.[8] This prototype featured some other differences from the earlier prototypes, including the fact that drivers hatch was moved entirely to the roof of the hull[8] and the vision flap was deleted from the design[8] and replaced by a vision\n\nT-44\n\n5 slot in the glacis plate.[8] After trials conducted in August and September 1944 and after it received several upgrades[3] (which increased the weight of the vehicle to 32 tonnes), the T-44A officially entered service with the Red Army on the 23 November 1944.[3][8]\n\nT-44-100 and T-54 Even with its innovative technology and better armor protection, the T-44A still used an 85 mm ZiS-S-53 tank gun, the same as the one fitted on the T-34-85 medium tank. The army needed a new tank armed with a more powerful 100 mm gun.[3] At the end of 1944 the designers had three types of 100 mm guns at their disposal which could considerably increase the firepower of the tank. These included the One of the two T-44-100 prototypes. Notice the D-10 (which already proved itself in combat as it was used in SU-100 100 mm gun, 12.7 mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy tank destroyer) as well as prototype ZiS-100 and LB-1 (LB stands for machine gun mounted on the loader's hatch and 6 Lavrenty Beria).[3][8] The T-44 tank armed with the 100 mm tank gun mm thick anti-HEAT sideskirts protecting the originally received the designation T-44B. Two projects were started, sides. This example does not have a splashboard on the glacis plate. both based on the T-44A. The development of the first one started in October 1944 at the design bureau of the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, located in Nizhny Tagil. The designing stage was completed in December. The prototype was ready in February 1945. The trials conducted between March and April gave positive results and the vehicle entered service with the Red Army as T-54. The tank had almost the same hull and drive train as the T-44A. Differences included thickened front armour (120 mm on the upper section and 90 mm on the lower section) and a different hatch and vision slot for the driver. The turret had increased diameter to 1800 mm. There was thicker armour (180 mm on the front, between 90 mm and 150 mm on the sides and 30 mm on the roof). The armament included the 100 mm D-10TK tank gun as well as two 7.62 mm GWT machine guns. The tank was powered by a new V-54 12-cylinder 38.88 liter water-cooled diesel engine developing 520 hp (388 kW) at 2,000 rpm. The fuel capacity was increased (530 liters in the internal fuel tank and 165 liters in the external fuel tank). The external fuel tanks were connected to the fuel system. The rubber rollers on the roadwheels were widened. The weight was increased to 35.5 tonnes, which reduced the maximal road speed to 43.5 km/h. The maximal road operational range increased to 360 km. Because of positive results seen in trials, it was decided to modernize the tank before starting production (for more details about it see the T-54/55 article) as well as to put the new tank's turret onto two modified serial T-44A tanks. This was done in 1945 and the two prototype tanks received the designation T-44-100. One of the prototypes was armed with a D-10TK tank gun while the other one was armed with a LB-1 tank gun.[3][8] Like the second generation T-44-85 prototypes, the two T-44-100 prototypes had differences between each other. One prototype had a splashboard on the glacis plate while the other did not. They both had the 12.7 mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy machine gun fitted to the loader's hatch, 6 mm thick anti-HEAT sideskirts protecting the sides and two cylindrical fuel tanks in the back[1] which increased the fuel capacity to 1035 liters.[11] These cylindrical fuel tanks were later used on Soviet main battle tanks as additional fuel tanks. Further development of the T-44 was canceled and all the attention was directed towards the development of a new T-54 main battle tank.[1][8]\n\nDescription The T-44 had a typical tank layout: the driving compartment at the front, the fighting compartment in the middle and the engine compartment in the rear. The original intention was to retain the high mobility and speed of a T-34 and to provide the T-44 with heavier armour protection against large-caliber tank guns. This was accomplished by adding thicker armour but reducing the internal volume of the hull. The T-44 had a lower profile than the T-34, and was potentially simpler to manufacture. Although the T-44 used many components of the T-34, it had a new hull, and a\n\nT-44\n\n6 modified model V-2 diesel engine, suspension and transmission.[1][8] Reflecting trends in other designs in this period, the T-44 was designed without the hull radio operator/machine gunner position present in many older designs. This was done for a number of reasons.[12] The extensive machine gun firing port in the glacis plate (which was present in the T-34 medium tank) was a weak spot in the armour.[13] In the T-34, this firing port and the driver's hatch were exploited during World War II by the Germans fighting the T-34s.[13] Shooting the machine gun was ineffective as it was inaccurate due to obscured vision.[12] It was considered inefficient to transfer reports through an additional member of the crew and therefore these duties were transferred to the commander.[12] The space saved was used for a fuel tank[12] and to increase the ammunition load.[8] The driver's hatch was on the left side of the hull roof. The tank had an improved hull design, longer and wider than the T-34 but slightly lower thanks to the relocation of the air filter, with thicker armour, and was simpler to construct. The hull had a sloped glacis plate, vertical sides, and a slightly beveled rear. Most tanks had a splashboard on the glacis plate although there are pictures of T-44A tanks without them. It protected the upper part of the vehicle from splashes of mud or water. There were three mounts for rectangular stowage bins on the fenders (two on the right fender and one on the left fender). There were four mountings for cylindrical fuel tanks on the fenders (two per side). This was changed in the T-44M which used rectangular fuel cells.[1][8] During its service the tank proved to be not entirely adapted to winter conditions, due to an incomplete draining of the cooling system, caused by a water pump system that had been modified to reduce engine height. A small shaft would break after the impeller pump froze. The repair of the shaft, considering the field conditions, proved very impractical and required three people. Two people had to hold a third person by the legs and lower him into the engine bay, where he had to loosen the fastening and remove the broken shaft. Then, he was pulled out and lowered back down to install the new shaft. He was repeatedly lowered until the new part was secured. Another serious problem discovered during the winter conditions was that the crews of the T-44A suffered from frostbite because of the complete lack of a heating system. The driver was supposed to be protected from rain and snow by a removable Tarpaulin cover with a small glass window. However, this was not successful and its use was deemed impractical.[9] The T-44 had a compact torsion-bar suspension instead of the T-34's Christie coil springs, although it retained the Christie method of engagement between the slotted drive wheel and track lugs. The suspension had five large spoked road wheels and 'dead' 500 mm wide track from the T-34.[7] The hull and wheels were virtually identical to the early T-54 main battle tanks although the original T-44 had the T-34's 'spider' road wheels and a narrow, inset drive wheel at the rear. The T-44 was the last Soviet medium tank with paddle-type tracks. The mechanism for tensioning them was significantly better on the T-44 than it was on the T-34. On the T-34, first two lug-nuts on the crank had to be loosened and then the crank pounded with a sledge hammer in order to separate it from the hull. After the track was tensioned, the crank had to be set back in place with a sledge hammer. The whole process required up to three people. On the T-44, the same task could be carried out by one person, without the help of a sledge-hammer. The roadwheels were spaced evenly from each other except for a prominent gap between two of the roadwheels. The T-44-85 and T-44-122 prototypes had a gap between the second and third roadwheels like in the T-34[5] but the T-44A had a gap between the first and second roadwheels.[5] This arrangement of wheels was continued in the T-54 and T-55 main battle tanks. The roadwheels sometimes started to 'fall home' after 2,500 km. To increase the service life of the road wheel, a slight camber of the paired road wheels was tried. However, this resulted in greater stress on the outer rollers. When the tank crosses 20 km of rough ground it can pick up about a ton of dirt along the way.[1][8][9] The new V-44 12-cylinder 4-stroke diesel engine, developing 520 hp (388 kW) at 1,800 rpm, was a more powerful version of the T-34's model V-2 with a new planetary manual 5-speed transmission system, filtration system, improved cooling system, horizontally placed water and oil pumps[6][14] and an improved fuel system which increased its power output,[6] although the tank retained the side clutches from the T-34.[1] The new engine gave the T-44 a maximal road speed of 53 km/h and maximal cross country speed of 20 km/h to 25 km/h as well as maximal road range of 350 km. The engine could become worn out after the tank traveled 3,000 km. When that happened, the\n\nT-44\n\n7 oil pressure would drop to 2-3 atmospheres and under heavy loads, the engine would start smoking, spewing out black smog out of the side of the tank. The engine deck had two transverse ventilation grilles at the rear. The exhaust port was on the rear left hand side of the hull. The tank could cross 1 m high vertical obstacles, 2.5 m wide trenches, 32°[5][15] side slopes and 60° gradients and ford 1.3 m deep water obstacles without preparation.[1][9][11] Because driver's hatch was moved from the glacis plate and positioned so that he exited the vehicle perpendicularly instead of crawling out of the hatch, his seat received an elevating mechanism. While in a relatively safe area the driver could elevate his seat to look outside of the tank, providing greater visibility and easier access to the controls. While in combat the driver lowered his seat back into the tank and had to rely on the vision slot protected by triplex (three-layer glass).[14] While in this position the pedals of the main clutch, the fuel supply, and incline brake were positioned much higher and the levers of the steering clutch and gear shifting became inconvenient to operate. Early examples had transmission problems. While the driver was switching gears, two gears could engage simultaneously, which caused a broken gear pinion. This and other gearbox related problems were solved in a 1961 T-44M modernization with the introduction of a gearbox from the T-54 main battle tank.[1][8][9] T-44A was armed with an 85 mm ZiS-S-53 tank gun as well as two 7.62 mm DTM light machine guns. One of these machine guns was mounted to fire through a tiny hole in the center of the glacis plate. Because the tank's crew did not include a radio operator/machine gunner, the driver operated this light machine gun. The gun was mounted in a fixed position and could only be aimed by turning the tank.[12] The main gun was placed in a centrally placed turret along with a coaxially mounted 7.62 mm DTM light machine gun. The ZiS-S-53 tank gun could penetrate around 100 mm of armour at range of 1000 m. The gun could be elevated or depressed between -5° and +25°.[5] It wasn't stabilized.[11] Like in the T-34 and SU-76 SPG, hot cartridge-cases were rolling under the feet of the crew. The crew was also subjected to gases from the main gun every time after it was fired.[9] The tank carried 58 rounds for the 85 mm ZiS-S-53 tank gun and 1890 rounds for 7.62 mm DTM light machine guns.[1] The turret was cast, with a prominent horizontal casting seam, shaped like an elongated hexagon, with sloped sides and overhang all around. It resembled a longer, better armoured T-34-85 turret. It had a cast gun mantlet with a small but prominent ring/collar around the base of the tank gun tube. The turret roof had a raised commander's cupola on the left and loader's hatch on the right with a low dome-shaped ventilator behind it. The turret was moved with an electric motor. The front armour of the turret was 120 mm thick while the side armour was 75 mm thick.[3][7][8] The hull was made of rolled welded steel. The glacis plate was 90 mm thick while the side armour was 75 mm and the bottom armour was 20 mm thick. T-44 tanks could be fitted with additional 30 mm thick armour plates on the sides of the hull and the turret. Additional spaced armour panels could be fitted to the sides of the hull.[3][11] The T-44A could be fitted with the PT-3 mine clearing device. It had a radio in the back of the turret with an antenna at the center of the left side of the turret. The vehicle was equipped with a submachine gun.[14] The vehicle lacked an NBC (nuclear, biological and chemical) protection system and a night vision device.[8][11]\n\nProduction history The T-44A officially entered service with the Red Army on 23 November 1944 but the production started in October.[12] Production took place at the new Factory No. 75 (Zavod 75) in Kharkiv which used the buildings of the old KhPZ Factory No. 183 which were recaptured from Germans on 23 August 1943.[12] To restore the factories to working order, engineers, workers, machines and tools were sent from Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183, located in Nizhny Tagil.[12] The original plans were that the factory would produce 300 T-44As a month. However, only 25 were built by the end of 1944. In 1945, 940 were built, making a total of 965 (190[12] tanks built in 1944 and 1945 were completed by the end of the war). An additional 858 T-44As were made in 1946-1947. The T-34 continued to account for 85% of medium tank production through 1950,[16] and development of a more advanced medium tank with a more powerful 100 mm gun proceeded. The relatively brief production run ended in 1947 with a total of 1,823 T-44A tanks built. The reasons for such a brief production run included mechanical teething problems,[17] the end of the war which reduced the Red Army's need for a new tank,[17] and the design's inability to successfully fit a 100 mm\n\nT-44\n\n8 tank gun.[17] It was replaced on the production lines by the T-54-1 main battle tank, which was more mechanically reliable and could mount a 100 mm gun. The superior T-54-2 would replace T-34 production at the Omsk Factory No. 183 in 1950, and the T-54/55 main battle tank series would remain in production until 1981.[3][8]\n\nService history The T-44 was issued to three tank brigades mustered on 15 September 1944 for training purposes, but these formations (6th Guards, 33rd Guards, and 63rd Guards Tank Brigades[18]) were re-equipped with T-34-85 tanks prior to entering the Battle of Berlin and Prague Offensive. The T-44A was not used operationally during World War II in Europe for several reasons, including the fact that the Red Army was not ready to accept a new tank[1] because of lack of sufficient spares[1] and technical specialists who could repair and maintain the new tanks[1] as well as the fact that many of the tank crews would have to be retrained.[1] However, three tanks were sent to the 100th Special Tank Company which tested them on the Eastern Front.[1] Many T-44As were immediately sent after they were produced in the Far East regions of the Soviet Union. The first tanks arrived there before the end of the war and were used operationally during the last three days of fighting. They continued to arrive after the war and eventually around 600 T-44As were stationed there.[19] Due to the Cold War, the USSR decided to keep the tank secret.[1][13] It was never shown publicly during military parades[13] and pictures were never shown publicly until the secrecy was dropped. There is almost no photographic evidence of T-44s stationed in East Germany[13] or during the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956[13] although it is known that T-44s were sent there (there are only a small number of photos of T-44As in Hungary in existence).[13] In 1961, a number of T-44As were modernized with parts from the T-54 main battle tank and other upgrades and received the designation T-44M. In 1963, some T-44Ms were converted into T-44MK command tanks. In 1965 some T-44Ms were converted into BTS-4A armoured recovery vehicles.[12] In 1966, a number of T-44As and T-44Ms received the \"Cyclone\" gun stabilizer and the designations T-44S and T-44MS, respectively.[12] According to most sources T-44S, T-44M and T-44MS tanks remained in service with the Soviet Army until the end of the 1970s, when their usefulness as tanks had ended. It is possible that they remained in storage until the beginning of 1990s.[19] Many T-44Ms were converted into artillery tractors, tank tractors and engineer tanks. A number of T-44A, T-44S, T-44M, T-44MK and T-44MS tanks were converted into fixed defensive positions; some of which are known to have been positioned on the border with the People's Republic of China.[13] Unlike most Soviet made weapons the T-44 wasn't exported.[1][8] After the cloak of secrecy was lifted in 1960s, when the tank was already becoming obsolete, it was used in the war movies:[1] Father of a Soldier,[1] Liberation, Battle of Moscow, Red Cherry,[20] The Star,[21] and Downfall.[1][22] In the first, it was used to portray a T-34.[1] In Liberation, Red Cherry, The Star, and Downfall it was visually modified with additional plates[1] to resemble the Tiger I heavy tank.[1] Some T-44 and T-34 tanks were visually modified to represent German Panzerkampfwagen IVs. They were made for Soviet era film studios and were used in a number of movies about battles on the Eastern Front. They were also used during a 2004 re-enactment of the Battle of Moscow.[23] Some T-44As were given to military museums including one in Brest in today's Belarus. One of two T-44-100 prototypes is in the Kubinka Tank Museum.\n\nT-44\n\n9\n\nCombat history • World War II – briefly fielded in 1944–45, but kept out of combat • Hungarian Revolution – not known to have seen combat\n\nVariants • T-44-85 (1944) – Designation for two first generation prototypes armed with 85 mm D-5T tank gun and two second generation prototypes armed with 85 mm ZiS-S-53 tank gun.[1][8] • T-44A (1944) – Designation for the third generation prototype and the production model.[1][3][8] • T-44S (1966) – T-44A fitted with \"Cyclone\" two-plane gun stabilization system.[8][12] • T-44M (1961) – T-44A modernization incorporating a drive train upgraded to match the one used in T-54 including the V-54 12-cylinder 38.88 liter water-cooled diesel engine developing 523 hp (390 kW), gearbox, tracks, 'starfish' road wheels and a conventional toothed drive sprocket, flush with the outer track edge. It had an increased ammunition stowage (from 58 rounds to 61 rounds), new R-113 and R-120 radio sets, a heater and infra-red night sight, TVN-2 night vision device for the driver as well as another fuel tank which increased the fuel capacity by 150 liters to 650 liters and 800 liters with additional fuel tanks.[12] The maximal road operational range of the tank increased to 420 km - 440 km.[12] The original fenders were replaced with T-54-style ones. The catwalk stowage was changed to the flat T-54 rectangular external fuel tanks with embossed circle and cross. Hence the T-44M had a different arrangement of additional fuel tanks and stowage boxes. There were four rectangular external fuel tanks as well as two smaller ones on the right fender and fastenings for four spare track chain links, one rectangular external fuel tank as well as two smaller ones and one stowage box. The tank received a mount for an antiaircraft machine gun.[12] A T-54-style headlight cluster with two headlights was added to right hand side of the glacis plate and the T-34-style headlight on the left hand side of the hull was removed.[8] • T-44MK (1963) – T-44M converted into a command tank. Apart from standard T-44M equipment, it is equipped with R-112 radio set. The ammunition stowage was reduced by 15 rounds to 46 rounds.[8][12] • T-44MS (1966) - T-44M fitted with \"Cyclone\" two-plane gun stabilization system. It also has increased maximal operational range.[12] • BTS-4A (1965) – T-44M converted into an armoured recovery vehicle. The turret has been removed. The vehicle was fitted with a stowage basket, a hoist and a small folding crane with a capacity of 3 tonnes and a snorkel. It was also known as BTS-4-44M.[8][12] • T-44 tanks converted into fixed fortifications. This process usually involved the removal of the engine and the gearbox while burying the tank up to the top of the hull and covering the turret in concrete to break up the outline and to give it a rock-like appearance.[8] • T-44-122 (1944) – First generation prototype armed with D-25-44T 122 mm tank gun. It carried 24 rounds.[1][3][8] • T-44-100 (1945) – Prototype fitted with a new modified turret which would allow fitting the 100 mm D-10T gun or 100 mm LB-1 gun. The tank carries 36 rounds for the 100 mm tank gun.[12] This prototype had the 12.7 mm DShK anti-aircraft heavy machine gun fitted to the loader's hatch, 6 mm thick sideskirts protecting the sides and two cylindrical fuel tanks in the back giving it a fuel capacity of 1035L. The longer tank gun barrel increased the overall length of the vehicle to 8.04 m. The new turret, new armament and the sideskirts made the vehicle heavier as it weighed 34.55 tonnes.[1][8][11] • SU-122-44 (1944) - Self-propelled gun prototype armed with an 122 mm gun. • Uralmash-1 (1944) - Self-propelled gun prototype armed with either 100 mm gun or 122 mm gun. Also known as SU-101 and SU-102.\n\nT-44\n\n10\n\nNotes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]\n\n\"The Russian Battlefield\" (http:/ / www. battlefield. ru/ content/ view/ 95/ 50/ lang,en/ ) \"KMDB T-34\" (http:/ / www. morozov. com. ua/ eng/ body/ history4-6. php) \"Czołgi Świata\" (World's Tanks or Tanks Of The World) magazine issue 25 \"KMDB T-34M\" (http:/ / www. morozov. com. ua/ eng/ body/ tanks/ t-34m. php) \"Centrum Symulacji Taktyczno-Opearcyjnych\" (http:/ / www. csto. cal. pl/ forum/ viewtopic. php?t=982) \"armor.kiev.ua\" (http:/ / armor. kiev. ua/ Tanks/ WWII/ T44/ t44. html) \"Czołgiem\" (http:/ / www. czolgiem. com/ rosja/ t44. htm) \"JED The Military Equipment Directory\" (http:/ / www. jedsite. info/ tanks-tango/ tango-numbers-su/ t-44_series/ t44-series. html)(subscription required) [9] \"Rem Ulanov's memories\" (http:/ / armor. kiev. ua/ Tanks/ WWII/ T44/ t44_1. html) [10] \"historycy.pl\" (http:/ / www. historycy. pl/ Strony/ Artykuly/ 2007_02/ 01. html) [11] \"Modern Tanks\" (http:/ / mainbattletanks. czweb. org/ Tanky/ t44. htm) [12] \"armoured.vif2.ru\" (http:/ / armoured. vif2. ru/ t-44. htm) [13] \"Czołgi Info\" (http:/ / www. czolgi. husky-anana. net/ galeria. php?sortuj=rok_powstania& szukaj=& ile=1& nr=20& ile=10& s=20& rec=31) [14] \"mkmagazin\" (http:/ / mkmagazin. almanacwhf. ru/ armor/ t_44. htm) [15] Technika Wojskowa LWP.

The project's aim was to build a medium tank with heavier armour, but it turned out that what was needed to counter German advances in tank technology was better armament, and the T-43 was cancelled in favour of a more heavily-armed T-34-85.\n\nT-43 tank\n\nDevelopment history The T-34 medium tank was the mainstay of Soviet mechanized forces in World War II, produced in huge numbers. In May 1942, Soviet forces started encountering German tanks armed with the new long 75mm KwK 40 gun which could easily penetrate a T-34 at long range. In June 1942, the Soviet Main Directorate of Armoured Forces (GABTU) issued a requirement to two tank-design bureaus to compete in designing a \"universal tank\", which would combine the heavy armour of heavy tanks with the mobility of the T-34 medium tank. The SKB-2 heavy tank design bureau in Chelyabinsk started the KV-13 program, which two years later resulted in a line of successful Iosif Stalin heavy tanks. The Uralvagonzavod complex in Nizhny Tagil developed the T-43 medium tank. Uralvagonzavod included the Morozov Design Bureau, the designers of T-34, who were able to draw on its previous work on the advanced T-34M project. T-34M had been cancelled in 1941, when Germany invaded the USSR. As the new T-43 project was given a low priority—the focus was on increasing production of the T-34—the first prototype T-43 was finally completed in March 1943. The T-43 was generally similar to the T-34, but it had a new armour layout and turret design. It had a space-efficient torsion beam suspension instead of the T-34's Christie type and a new five-speed gearbox. It also had a three-man turret, with commander's cupola for all-round vision, a major improvement on the T-34's two-man turret in which the tank commander was being constantly distracted with aiming the main gun. Compared to the T-34 Model 1943 with hexagonal turret, the T-43's turret armour was increased from 70 mm to 90 mm, hull from 47 mm front and 60 mm sides to 75 mm. It retained the same 76.2 mm F-34 tank gun and, for ease of production, shared at least seventy percent of its parts interchangeably with the T-34. But testing at Kubinka showed that the heavier T-43 couldn't match the T-34's mobility, while its armour was still not heavy enough to stop the German 88mm gun. After the Battle of Kursk, Soviet planners realized that the T-34's biggest drawback was the ineffectiveness of its 76.2mm gun against the frontal armour of the new German Tiger and Panther tanks. What was needed was a more effective gun rather than heavier armour. The T-43 turret was adapted to mount a more effective 85 mm gun, and to fit on the T-34 tank hull. The T-43 project was cancelled, and the new T-34-85 was put into production instead. The decision to improve on an existing design rather than commit to a major retooling of the factories was characteristic of Soviet philosophy which held enormous production level as paramount. While Germany—having double the industrial resources of the Soviet Union—suffered a string of production and logistical difficulties while introducing new, technically superior tank models, the Soviets—maximizing productivity—accepted a compromise by significantly improving their main tank, even though it did not match the new German Panther. The result was that while in May 1944 the Wehrmacht only had 304 Panthers operating on the Eastern Front, the Soviets were producing T-34-85 tanks at a rate of 1,200 per month. When the T-34-85 first appeared in combat, German intelligence initially misidentified it as the \"T-43\", based on reports about Soviet tank research.\n\nReferences • Chamberlain, Peter and Chris Ellis (1972).

The tank had a weight of 36.5 tons and was powered by a 630 hp diesel engine which gave it a top road speed of 31 mph.[1] The primary armament of the Panzer 61 was a 105 mm main gun.\n\nHistory During the early 1950s the Swiss Army tried to buy modern tanks to reinforce the armoured forces which, due to the war in Korea, proved to be impossible. As a stop-gap solution, the army bought AMX-13 light tanks from France and decided to start the development of a Swiss-built main battle tank.\n\nPanzer 61 at the Tank Museum in Thun, Switzerland\n\nSwiss Panzer 61 MBT in Yad La-Shiryon Museum, Israel.\n\nThis led to a vehicle called Panzer 58. This tank had most of the characteristics of the later Panzer 61 with the exception of its main gun. The Panzer 58 was fitted with a British Ordnance QF 20 pounder.[2] The Swiss Army took delivery of 10 preproduction models. In 1961 the parliament decided to buy 150 of the improved Panzer 61 which were delivered between 1965 and 1967, produced at the RUAG Land Systems facility at Thun.[3] In the years from 1967 to 1994 (when the last Panzer 61 battalion was reequipped with more modern tanks) the tank underwent a series of changes and improvements which brought it very close to the standard of the Panzer 68 (its successor). Among many other changes, the original and characteristic 20 mm secondary gun was replaced by an additional machine gun in a coaxial turret mount. This last development step was called Panzer 61 AA9. The chassis was used as the basis of the Entpannungspanzer 65 armoured recovery vehicle[1] and for the initial prototype of the\n\nBrückenlegepanzer 68.[4]\n\nIn popular culture Two Panzer 61 tanks were mocked up as Panzer III tanks in the film, Enemy at the Gates. These replicas would be re-used in All the Queen's Men and Defiance.\n\nReferences [1] [2] [3] [4]\n\nChant, Christopher (1987). A Compendium of Armaments and Military Hardware. Routledge. pp. p.10.

The design makes use of proven components such as the L7 gun of the Centurion, and the Leyland L60 multi-fuel engine, transmission and fire control system of the Chieftain. A large number of tanks were also built by India under licence.\n\nDesign and development The Vickers MBT followed on from a 34-tonne 20-pdr gunned tank design intended for export. This would be as well equipped as Centurion but substantially cheaper and with Vickers Vigilant missiles as effective. However with the appreance of the 105 mm L7 gun into the British, US and German tank designs, this light tank would have been less powerful while too large for the reconnaisance role and so a new design was required. With armour twice that of the light tank design it would still be 12 tonnes lighter than Centurion and hence more mobile. The design would use the new engine and transmission of the Chieftain tank then being developed. The development conincided with an agreement with India in 1961 to produce a tank design and help set up a factory there to produce it. The Vickers MBT Mk 1 was designed to be a simple, low cost, but effective tank.[1] The first prototype was completed in 1963.[1] In 1964 one of the prototypes was sent to India. The Vickers was made of welded rolled homogeneous armour plates. It weighed 38,600 kg, carried a 105mm gun with 44 rounds and had a top speed of 48 km/h.[1] 70 tanks were sold to Kuwait and a large number of a modified version were made in India where the tank was called Vijayanta.[1]\n\nVariants • The prototype of the Vickers MBT Mk 3 was completed in 1975 and the tank was designed to meet the same requirements as the Mk 1 while offering better performance.[2] Improvements over the Mk 1 include better armour, a new diesel engine Detroit Diesel 12V-71T and a more modern fire control system EFCS 600 from Marconi with a Pilkington PE Condor commander's dag/night sight, NANOQUEST L23 gunner's sight and Simrad LV352 laser rangefinder.[3] Production started in 1978 and a number of tanks were sold to Kenya and Nigeria. The tank is armed with the same 105mm main gun L7A1 with 50 APFSDS, APDS, HEAT, HESH, HE, Smoke and Canister rounds. Sub-variants were the Vickers MBT Mk 3(I) with newly developed power train and suspension system, and the Vickers MBT Mk 3(M). The latter one was developed for Malaysia and had a number of improvements, for example ERA and an enhanced fire control system.[3] • The Vickers Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle is based on the Mk 3 and is equipped with a main winch, pulleys, cables and towbars. Some vehicles have a crane capable of lifting 4,000 kg.[3] • The Vickers Armoured Bridgelayer or Vickers AVLB is also based on the Mk 3 and is equipped with a hydraulically-operated launch and recovery system for an MLC 60/70 scissors bridge with a length of 13.41 m.[3]\n\nPrototypes • A Vickers MBT Mk 2 version was planned, to be equipped with four Swingfire anti-tank missiles in addition to the main gun, but this did not enter production.[4] Other changes included a new turret design and tracks that could sustain running at 56 kilometres per hour (35 mph).[5] Only one prototype was build.[3] • The Vickers MBT Mk 4 Valiant was designed in 1977. It mounted a \"Universal Turret\" which was offered with different gun options such as the rifled 120mm Royal Ordnance L11A5 from the Challenger, the 44-calibre smoothbore 120mm Rheinmetall L44 or the smoothbore GIAT CN-120 F1. The fire control system was Marconi's \"Centaur\". The hull was made of aluminium which proved to be too weak for the turret. This was only a prototype.\n\nVickers MBT • The Vickers MBT Mk 7, developed in the 1980s, was a further development of the Mk 4 and was offered to the British Army and to a number of potential export costumers. In the end, only one prototype was built. The Mk 7 had the same \"Universal Turret\" but the hull and chassis came from the Leopard 2.[6] The tank was fitted with Chobham armour and had a fire control system with a Marconi digital computer, a SFIM day sight and a Philips 2nd Gen thermal imager.[7] • There was also a Vickers Anti-aircraft Tank, equipped with the Marksman turret,[3] as well as a self-propelled 155mm howitzer with the GBT 155 turret.[8] The GBT 155 was unveiled in 1982 and was armed with the same 155mm ordnance as the AS-90. It was designed primarily for existing tank chassis'.[9]\n\nOperators • • • •\n\nKenya - 76 MBT Mk 3 and 7 ARV delivered in 1979-1982[3] Kuwait - 70 MBT Mk 1 delivered in 1970-1972, probably no longer operational[3] Nigeria - 136 MBT Mk 3, 12 ARV and 26 AVLB delivered in 1983-1995[3] Tanzania - 4 ARV delivered in 1989[3]\n\nReferences [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]\n\nGelbart, Marsh (1996).

The tank is also known by the name of 천리마 전차 （ 千 里 馬 or the \"Chollima Tank\"). The original Ch'ŏnma-ho is based on the Soviet T-62. There are at least five different operational versions of the Ch'ŏnma-ho. Since its inception, the Ch'ŏnma-ho has been upgraded various times. Not much is known about it, and its most recent public appearance was the 65th Anniversary Parade held in Pyongyang, North Korea, on 10 October 2010, celebrating the 65th anniversary of North Korea's ruling party.\n\nChonma-ho\n\n20\n\nA history of North Korea's armour After the Armistice Agreement of the Korean War in 1953, North Korea found itself in need of much more modern equipment. During the war, North Korea had been sold T-34s by the Soviet Union to combat American M4 Shermans and M26 Pershings. According to a report to the United States Congress in 2000, the North Korean military had more or less 2,000 tanks garrisoned along the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) alone.[6] This means that between the years 1954 and 2000 the North Koreans were able to stockpile over 2,000 tanks, including Soviet T-55s and T-62s and Chinese Type 59s and Type 62s. A North Korean general who defected to South Korea also said that due to a lack of fuel military exercises are limited.[7] It is also possible that many of the older vehicles used by the North Korean People's Army are not well maintained and have suffered from years of use. This still remains true even assuming good maintenance, and the North Korean army would not be the only military experiencing this. Although not much is known about the North Korean military after the Korean War, it is known that they have many different types of tanks. These include the Type 59 and Type 62, as well as the T-54, T-62 and possibly the T-72. The T-54 was probably sold to North Korea between 1960 and 1970, while the T-62 was reportedly sold in the mid 1980s. Unconfirmed reports indicate a few T-72s may have been provided to North Korea in the early 1990s. It is known that the North Koreans still make limited use of vintage World War II T-34s as well as well as the Soviet-era PT-76/85 amphibious tanks. Up to 5,400 tanks are coupled with at least 12,000 self-propelled artillery pieces and thousands of other towed artillery pieces of unknown type and number.[8] The North Koreans also have at least nine different types of armoured personnel carriers, including the BMP-1.\n\nCh'onma-ho The Ch'ŏnma-ho has been issued to North Korea's premier armored formations, and would lead the initial attempts to break through South Korean defences. Other armour is relegated to a secondary role in this corps or to North Korea's four mechanized corps. To underscore North Korea's concept of combined arms and the importance of armour, and A conceptual drawing of the Ch'ŏnma-ho, with several upgrades, including the light explosive therefore the importance of the Ch'ŏnma-ho, North Korea's sole armour reactive armour. corps is directly grouped with two mechanized corps and a single artillery corps.[9] However, this forms the second echelon of North Korea's deployment to the DMZ, with the first echelon composed of four infantry corps,[9] and the rest in strategic reserve. This may also play a part in a defensive strategy, as the North Korean army is arrayed in depth, and the armour might be strategically placed to both provide offensive power and a second echelon composed of mobile defences to plug a South Korean breakthrough along the DMZ.[10] The Ch'ŏnma-ho is a product of North Korea's approach of Juche, or self-reliance, which also includes several indigenous self-propelled artillery pieces. The idea of juche comes from a North Korean sentiment of abandonment by their allies, China and Soviet Union/Russia.[11] This accounts for their drive towards overproduction and for recent North Korean nuclear developments, as well as the production of long-range missiles which provide North Korea with its longer range striking power. This all manifests itself within the 'triangle' of North Korean military development - armour, artillery and missiles. In fact, this seems reminiscent from Soviet military theory, including the application of overwhelming artillery support and the use of large amounts of armour to create a breakthrough after the initial\n\nSoviet T-62. The Ch'ŏnma-ho is a direct copy of the T-62 with several upgrades.\n\nChonma-ho artillery disruption. In that sense, North Korean military strategy is very mobile, and the large amounts of tanks underscores this. The Ch'ŏnma-ho is an attempt to partially address the technology gap between its current dated tank forces and South Korean K1A1 and the US M1 Abrams tank.\n\nProduction history There might be two versions of the Ch'ŏnma-ho 1: the copy of the Syrian T-62 in the late 1970s, and an original copy exported by the Soviet Union which may be the T-62D.[12] The Ch'ŏnma-ho is not related to the Chinese Type 62. Despite its relation to the T-62, the original version of the Ch'ŏnma-ho had thinner armour and was consequently lighter.[13] This version of the tank has two distinctive bolts on the bottom portion of the upper glacis plate. The Ch'ŏnma-ho I name was also given (at least by the West and South Korean white papers) to the imported T-62, which was later slightly upgraded to the IM version. Although no dates are available, the Ch'ŏnma-ho I was later upgraded to the II version with a laser rangefinder above the mantlet.[14] According to online sources this Ch'ŏnma-ho was upgraded once again, probably in the mid-1980s, with a 'boom shield'. The Ch'ŏnma-ho III might have also seen an armour upgrade with the addition of full-hull skirting and a new thermal shroud for the original 115 mm main gun.[15] The most modern Ch'ŏnma-ho tanks seem to be the IV and V versions. The Ch'ŏnma-ho IV is fitted with what resemble EDZ light explosive reactive armour bricks. Judging by photographs, these are mounted specifically on the turret side, with at least eight bricks per side. The Ch'ŏnma-ho IV is reported to be upgraded with new side-mounted smoke launchers.[14] North Korea is rumored to have received a few examples of the T-72s after 1992, and possibly a single T-90S main battle tank in August 2001.[15] Any conclusion regarding whether the Ch'ŏnma-ho has been upgraded to the standards of either the T-72 or the T-90S would be highly speculative at this point. Around 90% of the Ch'ŏnma-ho is indigenously produced.[16] There is evidence, however, that North Korea has purchased entire engines, or engine components, from Slovakia.[17] Furthermore, it is thought that ceramic components, possibly for an upgraded armour scheme, are from foreign sources, as well as fire control components.[16] It is not clear how much is indigenously produced in regards to the different variants of the Ch'ŏnma-ho. The figure of 90% could have changed considerably between the original Ch'ŏnma-ho I and the Ch'ŏnma-ho V, although it should be kept into consideration that many of the major features are probably purchased from abroad - especially for the upgrades of the tanks. It is not clear how much North Korea can afford on producing on its own, or how much it can afford to import for that matter. It is thought that North Korea is considerably low on resources, especially money, and this belief has been perpetuated after North Korea's nuclear test incidents in 2006.[18] It is possible that Russia is supplying North Korea with several components for North Korea's tank projects which include the Ch'ŏnma-ho and quite possibly the M-2002, although no hard evidence can support this claim. In August 2010 North Korean media revealed images of its new main battle tank the Pokpung-ho (also known as the M-2002), which had been rumoured to have been under development since the early 1990s and to have undergone performance trials in 2002. While precise details of its capabilities remain unclear, the Pokpung-ho appears to be simply a further improvement of the Ch'ŏnma-ho.[19] The news concerning North Korea's future main battle tank has certainly driven South Korea to look for outlets for their own national tank programs, including the future South Korean Main Battle Tank, the K2.\n\nDeployment history It is unknown which units of the Korean People's Army might be outfitted with the Ch'ŏnma-ho. It is clear that the Ch'ŏnma-ho is a general replacement for previously employed tanks, including the T-62, T-34 and Type 59 medium tanks.[20] It is very possible that the Ch'ŏnma-ho will equip the spearhead and elite of North Korea's armoured forces. They are apparently deployed in sufficient numbers to be strategically significant. There might be as many as 800 T-62s in addition to the over 1000 Ch'ŏnma-ho's in the North Korean army,[21] of which any number could be one of the five Ch'ŏnma-ho variants.\n\n21\n\nChonma-ho\n\nModels • Ch'ŏnma-ho I (Ga) - Lightened copy of the T-62 with thinner armour[3] • Ch'ŏnma-ho II (Na) - Similar to a stock T-62, but has several differences, has a laser rangefinder housed in a blister above the main gun atop the turret (though the original T-62 doers have a laser rangefinder, the Ch’onma-ho 1 do not – and the laser rangefinder of the T-62 is an integral part of the fire control system, rather than an add-on part like on the Ch’onma-ho 2). Fitted with spaced appliqué armor on the turret in a ring around the turret (\"boom shield\") – thin plates of steel welded onto the turret atop bars provide a space between the shields and the turret armor to provide the equivalent of spaced armor, as well as doubling as turret baskets for crew equipment and vehicle equipment.[3] • Ch'ŏnma-ho III (Da) - A simple progressive upgrade of the Ch’onma-ho 2, with a thermal sleeve for the main gun and armored track skirts added. It is possible, but considered unlikely, that lugs for ERA have been added since its introduction; if they are present, they would be most likely found on the glacis and turret sides. A night vision upgrade.[3] • Ch'ŏnma-ho IV (Ra) - Greatly upgraded armor protection, including composite armor on the glacis and turret front, and appliqué or thickened armor elsewhere. Even the appliqué and/or thickened armor appears to be more advanced than earlier models, does not appear to have gained a huge amount of weight. A ballistic computer was added to the fire control suite, and the fire control suite has been integrated into a complete system rather than being a patchwork of upgrades. Gun stabilization has been improved. Radios are improved, and the suspension beefed up. The new engine is a 750-horsepower model which can lay a thick, oily smoke screen by injecting diesel fuel into its exhaust. Lugs for ERA (similar to the Russian Kontakt-3 ERA) added to turret sides, and lugs on the armored track skirts and on the glacis. Lugs for a relatively small amount of ERA bricks on the turret front; the ERA on the turret front would only protect 40% of hits to the turret front. On side of turret, clusters of four smoke grenade launchers; at the rear of the turret another cluster of four smoke grenade launchers, firing backwards instead of forwards.[3] • Ch'ŏnma-ho V (Ma) - Armor upgrades derived partially from the T-90S and T-72S, as well as a better ballistic computer and the addition of the aforementioned thermal imagers. Upgraded main gun – a copy of the 125mm 2A46 gun, complete with an autoloader. The fire control system replaced with one matching the new main gun, and the spent shell ejection system dispensed . Use wider tracks.[3] • Ch'ŏnma-ho VI (Ba) - Newly improved armor. fitted with rubber plates to defend shape charged warheads. The chassis has been stretched, and six roadwheels per side instead of five. [3] • Ch'ŏnma-ho II - Designation for imported T-62 • Ch'ŏnma-ho IM - Improved imported T-62[3]\n\nVariants • Ch'ŏnma-ho ARV - Armoured recovery vehicle with a casemate superstructure • Ch'ŏnma-ho Command - Command variant of the tank with a fake main gun • Juche-Po - Self-propelled artillery gun on a modified Ch'ŏnma-ho chassis. The Juche-Po is an improvement over the Tok-Ch'ŏn artillery piece, which was mounted on an ATS-59 chassis. There are at least four M1991 versions of the Juche-Po, each mounting a different gun; the D-30 122 mm, D-74 122 mm, the M-46 130 mm and the ML-20 152 mm howitzer. A fifth M1992 version is armed with the SM-4-1 130 mm howitzer. These artillery pieces can be identified by their six road wheels, as compared to the Tok-Ch'ŏn's five, and a prominent recoil cylinder which protrudes from the turret. Another major difference is the fact that the Juche-Po has a fully encased rounded turret, as opposed to the older open-topped self-propelled artillery pieces used previously.\n\n22\n\nChonma-ho\n\nOperators • •\n\nIran - 150 ordered in 1981 from North Korea and delivered between 1982 and 1985.[2][4][5] North Korea - 470 were produced between 1980 and 1989 (the original order was placed in 1976).[2] Overall more than 1,200 were produced.[4][5] as many as 1,000 are currently in service in addition to roughly 800 T-62's (Which are capable of receiving the same upgrades)\n\nNotes [1] Bermudez Jr., p 50.

The M-84 is in service in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kuwait, Slovenia & Serbia.\n\nDevelopment and production The M-84 is based on the Soviet T-72 but with several modifications, including: a domestic fire-control system, improved composite armor, and a 1000-hp engine. The M-84 entered service with the Yugoslav People's Army in 1984. The improved M-84A version entered service a few years later. There were about 240 Yugoslav factories which directly participated in the production of the M-84 and about 1,000 others which participated indirectly.

Unlike the M-84, the Vihor was not a copy of a Soviet tank, but a new design from scratch. Two prototypes were created by 1991. One was completely finished, but the factory refused to deliver it to the Yugoslav People's Army. The second prototype only had its body completed. Due to the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the M-91 project was paused until the end of the civil war in Croatia. After 1994, the second tank body was fitted with a new turret and the entire project was renamed Croatian main battle tank M-95 Degman. The M-95 Degman is still in prototype/experimental/technological-testbed phase. Croatia also created an M-84D Degman upgrade package for the M-84. The Croatian army planned to upgrade its 75 M-84 tanks to the M-84D revision, but due to the economical crisis, the upgrade was postponed. The latest Serbian version of the M-84 is the M-84AS, unveiled in 2004. It features a new fire control system, Kontakt-5 ERA armor, AT-11 Sniper anti-tank missiles, Agava-2 thermal sight, and the Shtora defensive suite. It is very similar to the Russian T-90S, both in appearance and in capability. About 150 M-84 tanks were exported to Kuwait. The disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s prevented further exports of the M-84.\n\nM-84\n\nDesign Armament The M-84A is armed with a 2A46 125 mm smooth bore cannon. The gas cylinder positioned in the middle of the barrel is shielded with a thermal coating that minimizes deformation of the barrel from high temperatures and ensures it is cooled at the same rate during rapid firing. The M84 uses an automatic loader, which enables it to sustain a firing rate of 8 rounds per minute. The cannon's ammunition is stowed underneath the turret (40 rounds) within the hull of the tank. This concept was inherited from the original Soviet design for T-72 and is both a strength and weakness of the tank. While the lower hull beneath the turret is one of the least likely place to be hit and penetrated by antitank rounds or mines, it also means, that in the event of penetration and secondary detonation of the ammunition, the crew and tank are unlikely to survive the resulting catastrophic explosion. This weakness was exploited by Croatian soldiers in the Croatian War of Independence to the detriment of the YPA's tank crews. In later stages of the conflict, losses were reduced by adjusting and improving tactics. Along with its primary armament, the M-84 is also armed with one 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, and one 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun mounted on the commander's turret. All versions of the M-84 have a crew of three. The commander sits on the right side of the turret, the gunner on the left, and the driver sits centrally at the front end of the vehicle. Like most Soviet derived vehicles, the M-84 series of tanks do not have a manual loader, due to the tank's autoloader system.\n\nProtection The armour of the M-84AS tank consists of cylindrical pad, high-hardness steel, titanium, tungsten, aluminium as well as modular Kontakt-5 reactive armour plates. Croatian M-95 Degman versions use improved armor protection with four layers of titanium, two layers of tungsten and three layers of ceramic armor giving protection of 592 mm against HEAT and kinetic attacks. In addition to this, the Degman is extensively covered with explosive reactive armour plating. Twelve smoke grenades are positioned in front of the turret in banks of five and seven grenades. Thermal imaging and infrared guidance are positioned on the top-right side of the turret. The M-84 has a search light used in short-range combat situations. The M-84 tank has nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection capabilities.\n\nMobility The base M-84 engine is a 12-cylinder water-cooled V46-6 diesel engine, rated at 574 kW. The improved M-84A has a more powerful, V46-TK 735 kW (1,000 hp) engine. With maximum fuel capacity (1,200 litres) the tank's range is 450 km, and with external fuel tanks, this range can be extended to 650 km. The Croatian-made variants have enhanced power plants. The M-84A4 Sniper model has a German-built 820 kW (1,100 hp) engine, while the M-84D has a 895 kW (1,200 hp) engine, the most powerful of all M-84 variants. The M-84D also has greater fuel capacity (1,450 litres). The tank can ford 1.2 meters of water at any time, or up to 5 meters with a snorkel.\n\n27\n\nM-84\n\nVariants • M-84A (Yugoslavia) - An upgraded original M-84 with a new engine and sights. • M-84AB (Yugoslavia) - The M-84AB comes with the new SUV-M-84 computerized fire-control system, including the DNNS-2 gunner's day/night sight, with independent stabilization in two planes and integral laser rangefinder. It also comes with the TNP-160 periscope, TNPA-65 auxiliary periscope, and DNKS-2 day/night commander's periscopes, as well as the TNPO-168V driver's periscope. Furthermore, the M-84AB is fitted with new gyrocompass, communication and intercom systems. This variant is in service in Kuwait. The Kuwaiti 35th ash-shahid (Martyr's) Armoured Brigade, armed with several dozen M-84AB's, took part in Operation Desert Storm. During the fighting, only two M-84ABs were lost, but both were later recovered. • M-84ABN (Yugoslavia) - This variant is simply a M-84AB, fitted with land navigation equipment. • M-84ABK command tank (Yugoslavia) - This is a M-84AB fitted with extensive communication equipment, land navigation equipment, and a generator for the command role. • M-84A4 Sniper (Croatia) - This version includes the all-new SCS-84 day/night sight, DBR-84 ballistic computer and improved elevation and traverse sensors. Croatia purchased around 40 of these models from 1996 till 2003 from its domestic factory. As rumoured, these tanks have a different engine of German origin, rated at 1,100 hp instead of the 1,000 hp powerplant originally installed, but this information has never been officially confirmed. A Racal communication suite also replaced the older communication set. As of 2008, the entire Croatian M-84 tank fleet was upgraded to M-84A4 standard. • M-84AI armoured recovery vehicle (Yugoslavia and Poland) - During the mid-1990s Kuwait requested an armoured recovery vehicle variant of the M-84A tank as part of the deal to buy a large batch of M-84A tanks. The vehicle had to be developed in very short time so it was decided that it should be based on an already working foreign vehicle rather than designed and built independently. The Polish WTZ-3 license was bought and Polish parts were used in the M-84AI project completed in the factory \"14 October\" in Kruševac. There was also a plan for a M-84ABI for Kuwait, but this idea failed. It is armed only with a 12.7mm machine-gun fitted to the commander's hatch and 12 smoke grenade mortars (8 right and 4 left). Standard equipment includes: A TD-50 crane, front-mounted stabilizing dozer blade, main and secondary winches. • M-84AS (Serbia) - This is the latest upgrade package of the M-84A in the Serbian Army. Adding a new fire control system, new armour consisting of cylindrical pad, high-hardness steel, titanium, aluminum, and NERA as well as modular Kontakt-5 armour, new AT-11 Sniper and Agava-2 thermal sights, and the Shtora defense suite. The first public appearance of the M-84AS was in July 2004 at the Nikinci military base. It appeared to be very similar to the Russian T-90S, both in appearance and in capability. The differences reportedly consist of better armour on the T-90S, whereas the M-84AS has superior maneuverability. The M-84AS was also tested by Kuwaiti Army as part of an international tender, but a bid by a Turkish company was selected instead. It can also survive multiple hits at relatively close ranges from ATGMs or other hits from tanks. New thermal imaging cameras were mounted for the commander and driver so that the tank can operate at night. It is fitted with the 125 mm 2A46M smooth bore gun and a 1,200 hp diesel engine giving a maximum speed of 72 km/h. In addition, there were a number of undisclosed Arab countries that are interested in the purchase of the M-84AS. • M-84D (Croatia) - This variant brings existing M-84 variants to the M-84D standard, equipped with a new 1,200 hp (895 Kw) engine and new RRAK ERA armour. The M-84D is equipped with a Rafael - Samson Remote Controlled Weapon Station, and a new Omega ballistic computer (Slovenian Fotona-made digital ballistic computer). The M-84D has an electric cupola, which means it can fire at two targets at once. It has a new SDZ defence system, which has the capability to protect the crew from biological, chemical and nuclear strikes. The M-84D is also equipped with new thermal imaging that is able to see at night, through fog, in shade, and during a storm. A new Racal communication system was also installed, which now comes as standard on all new M84D and M84A4 tanks. Diehl, the German firm which supplies track for the Leopard 2 is also supplying tracks for the\n\n28\n\nM-84\n\n29 Croatian M-84D and M-84A4 tanks. The M-84A4 and M-84D have an operational range of 700 km and a maximum speed of 65 km/h.The M-84D has also a 15% faster auto loader, meaning 9 shells per minute instead of 8 shells per minute.[1] The M-84D is a second version of the upgraded tanks.It has also chains on the back of the tank to protect the engine and has SLAT armour around the ammunition to prevent an ATG or a shell from hitting it. M-84D received few additional upgrades, Turret basket was added to provide extra space for extra ammunition and to provide increased armour protection. Turret basket has additional slat armour, which adds additional armour to the exterior of the tank. M84D and M84A4 are to receive 12.7mm Kongsberg Protector Remote Weapon Stations which are to be integrated on to all M84D and M84A4 tanks. M-84D will also feature LIRD-4B - Laser irradiation detector and warner and LAHAT anti tank missiles. There is a potential for integration of Swiss 120 mm compact gun developed by RUAG. This option is being now seriously considered as this would allow Croatia to use NATO 120 m standard ammunition. 120 mm RUAG compact gun is a preferred option over German Rheinmetall L44 120 mm cannon which is more expensive and would require German support, whereas RUAG will provide technical know how and technology transfer to Đuro Đaković specijalna vozila d.d.. The final version is due to be presented to the public by late 2009 or early 2010 and conversion of existing tanks is to start by 2011.\n\nOperational history Desert Storm Prior to the Gulf War, Kuwait ordered 170 M-84ABs, 15 M-84ABI ARVs and 15 M-84ABK command tanks, from Yugoslavia. Four M-84A tanks were delivered, however the Iraqi Army soon captured them after the occupation. Further deliveries were stopped for the duration of the war. The Kuwaiti 35th Al-Shaheed Armoured Brigade was equipped with 70 M-84s. During the retaking of the country, the 35th Brigade did not directly take part in battles with Iraqi tanks because of the M-84s resemblance to Iraqi T-72s. The M-84 was however very effective against T-62s and T-55s but some unconfirmed reports claim that a few of them were damaged, but recovered and repaired.\n\nKuwaiti M-84s taking part in Operation Desert Storm.\n\nYugoslav wars Slovenia During the Ten-Day War, the Yugoslav People's Army (YPA) attempted to regain control over border crossings, airports and other strategic positions in Slovenia. The Slovenian Territorial Defence had no armoured units of its own, as such YPA M-84s were commonly used to break through barricades. The YPA lost some 20 M-84s to insurgent tactics. Slovenia inherited all the M-84s within its territory, once the ceasefire and Slovenia's independence was accepted.\n\nA Kuwaiti M-84 during Operation Desert Shield, demonstrates its ability to lay a smoke screen.\n\nCroatia The M-84 saw action in the Battle of Vukovar, where the YPA deployed large columns of main battle tanks without the support of the infantry. Tanks and APC's found themselves extremely exposed and suffered significant losses. The Croatian Army captured about 50 M-84 MBTs from Yugoslav Peoples Army during the Battle of the Barracks.\n\nM-84\n\n30\n\nBosnia During the Bosnian War, M-84s saw little action; the mainstay of all 3 warring parties was the T-55. At the beginning of war, YPA units located in Bosnia and Herzegovina had passed their equipment to the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The VRS had several dozen M-84s with the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina managing to capture only three M-84s. A number of M-84 tanks were used during the Siege of Sarajevo, as well during smaller localized conflicts. The number of M-84 tanks destroyed during the Bosnian war is unknown.\n\nOperators Current operators KuwaitKuwaitKuwaiti M-84 • Kuwaiti Army is equipped with 149 M-84AB MBTs in M-84AB, M-84ABK and M-84ABN versions bought prior to Operation Desert Storm from Yugoslavia. • 35th Shahid (Martyr's) Armoured Brigade equipped with 70 M-84s.

The tank is named for Arjun, a character in the Indian epic, Mahabharata. The Arjun features a 120 mm main rifled gun with indigenously developed APFSDS ammunition, one 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun, and a 12.7 mm machine gun. It is powered by a single MTU multi-fuel diesel engine rated at 1,400 hp, and can achieve a maximum speed of 70 km/h (43 mph) and a cross-country speed of 40 km/h (25 mph). It has a four-man crew: commander, gunner, loader and driver. Automatic fire detection and suppression, and NBC protection systems are included. All-round anti-tank warhead protection by the newly developed Kanchan armour is claimed to be much higher than available in comparable third generation tanks.[9] In March 2010, the Arjun was pitted against the T-90 in comparative trials and performed well. Subsequently delays and other problems in its development from the 1990s to the 2000s prompted the Indian Army to order vast numbers of T-90S tanks from Russia to meet requirements that the Arjun had been expected to fulfill.[9][10] Army placed an order for an additional 124 Arjun Mk-I tanks on 17 May 2010 and 124 Arjun Mk-II Tanks on 9 August 2010.[2][11][12][13] The Arjun entered service with the Indian Army in 2004.[14] The tanks were first inducted into the 43rd Armoured Regiment, Indian Army Armoured Corps, which was later built up to regiment strength in 2009,[14] while the latest induction has been into the 75th Armoured Regiment on 12 March 2011.[15]\n\nHistory Planning and development The DRDO, with its Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) as the main laboratory, was tasked to develop the hull, armour, turret, running gear and gun for the tank, with the powerpack being imported.[16] Although the development of the tank began in 1972 by the CVRDE, it was only in 1996 that the Indian government decided to mass produce the tank at Indian Ordnance Factory's production facility in Avadi.[9][17] When first accepted for service in the army, the Arjun relied heavily on foreign components and technology. Initially close to 50% of the tank's components were imported, which included the engine, transmission, gun barrel, tracks, and fire control system.[18] However, several of these have since been replaced by indigenous systems or are being supplied by Indian companies.[19][20] Recent comments from Army sources indicate that the Russian T-90S will form the mainstay of its future force, despite that tank’s performance issues in hot weather. The Arjun project experienced serious budget overruns and repeated delays that resulted in a development time of over 37 years. A complicating factor was that advances in technology and the threat environment in the intervening years led to multiple revision of requirements by the Army. While the government sanctioned 15.5 crore (US$2.8 million) for the initial design in May 1974,[16] by 1995, DRDO had spent Rs. 300 crore (US$ 54.6 million) on development due to changing requirements and inflationary cost increases.[21]\n\nArjun (tank)\n\n34\n\nProduction and deployment The Indian Army ordered 124 Arjuns in 2000,[22] expected to cost US$471.2 million.[1] Early development versions of the Arjun were held by 43 Armoured Regiment which were shown in display in the Republic Day Parade of 2001.[23] The first batch of 16 production version Arjun tanks were received in 2004[14][24] and they were provided as a squadron to the 43rd Armoured Regiment. The regiment was later made up to 45 tanks on 25 May 2009 making it the first Arjun regiment of the Indian Army.[14][25] More than 100 tanks have been delivered to the Indian Army by June 2011.[26] The latest regiment to be completely equipped by the Arjun tank is 75 Armoured Regiment which was the last regiment in the Indian Army to hold the T-55 tank.[15]\n\nUpgrades As part of improving the Arjun to the Mark-II variant, DRDO is continuing to develop new technology systems for MBT Arjun, in order to improve performance in areas like automatic target locating, tracking and destruction.[27] The Arjun MK-II variant is being developed in coordination with and with the involvement of the Indian Army and will feature several modifications that are being sought by it.[6] DRDO is developing the Tank Urban Survival Kit which is a series of improvements to the Arjun intended to improve fighting ability in urban environments which includes defensive aids like laser warning, IR jammer, and aerosol smoke grenade system.[28][29]\n\nArjun Tank model\n\nCVRDE is in the process of developing tank simulators.[27] DRDO is developing a Laser Warning Control System (LWCS) in cooperation with Elbit Limited of Israel to be equipped on the Arjun at regimental level trials with T-90s. The MCS is being developed by DRDO to help the tank reduce the threat of interference from all types of sensors and smart munitions of the enemy in the tank's systems. LWCS includes the defensive aids mentioned, and will help reduce the signatures of the tank in the battle field and improve its survivability. DRDO is also co-developing the and Mobile Camouflaging System (MCS) technology along with a Gurgaon-based private sector defence manufacturer Barracuda Camouflaging Limited. The upgrade also includes a new improved 1500 hp engine.[30][31] An anti-helicopter round is under development as well.[9]\n\nArjun (tank)\n\n35\n\nSpecifications Weighing in at 58.5 tons, the Arjun tank is significantly heavier than the Soviet-legacy tanks used presently by the Indian Army, and required changes to the army's logistics establishment, including new railroad cars to transport the bigger and heavier Arjuns. The required logistical changes have been made but the cost of the whole project has increased.\n\nArmament Armed with a 120 mm rifled gun, the Arjun is believed to be capable of firing APFSDS (Kinetic Energy) rounds, HE, HEAT, High Explosive Squash Head (HESH) rounds at the rate of 6-8 rounds per minute and the Israeli developed semi-active laser guided LAHAT missile. The LAHAT is a gun-launched missile and is designed to defeat both enemy armour and enemy combat helicopters. In addition, the Arjun is armed with a 12.7 mm AA machine gun and a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun.[32] The Arjun can carry 39 rounds in special blast-proof canisters. The Arjun uses a manual loader and has a crewman to reload the gun.\n\nLAHAT missile\n\nFire control and navigation The computerised fire control system aboard Arjun has been jointly developed by DRDO with the Elbit,Israel.[33] The Fire Control System is stabilised on two axes, and with an extremely high hit probability (design criteria call for a greater than 0.9 Pk) replaces an earlier analogue one, which had problems due to its inability to function under the harsh desert conditions.[17] The combined day sight from Bharat Electronics Ltd. and the thermal imager (formerly from Sagem, now reported to be from El-Op) constitute the gunner's primary sight. The first batch of tanks of the 124 ordered by the Army will have an Arjun gunnery simulator. all-digital Sagem FCS, whereas the second block will have the BEL unit, which will be used for all units thereafter. The commander's own stabilised panoramic sight allows him to engage targets and/or hand them over to the gunner.[34] The Arjun has an auxiliary power unit to operate weapon systems in silent watch mode as well.[9][35][36] The tank incorporates GPS-based navigation systems and sophisticated frequency hopping radios. The state-of-the-art Battlefield Management System, co-developed by DRDO and Ebit Israel, allows it to network with other fighting units.[37] The Arjun has the capability to network with other tanks, thanks to its Battle Management System. In a search and engage operation, several Arjun tanks can monitor an opponent and his moves, and try to eliminate him in a chase or ambush.[9][35][36]\n\nArjun (tank)\n\nProtection The turret and glacis are heavily armoured and use \"Kanchan\" (\"gold\") modular composite armour. The Kanchan armour got its name from Kanchan Bagh, Hyderabad, where the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) is located.[38] The armour is made by sandwiching composite panels between Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA) to defeat APFDS or HEAT rounds. During the trials in 2000, the Kanchan was able to withstand a hit from a T-72 at point blank range, and was able to defeat all available HESH and APFSDS rounds, which included the Israeli APFSDS rounds.[38] A new honeycomb design non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour (NERA) armour is reportedly being tested on the Arjun. Nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection equipment mine sweeps and an automatic fire fighting system.
