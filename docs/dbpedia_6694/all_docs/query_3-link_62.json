        "text": "In this panel discussion, Hoover Oral Historian Halima Kazem and Hoover Fellow Kelly J. Shannon will discuss the often overlooked or forgotten histories of women’s rights activism and resistance against oppressive regimes in Iran and Afghanistan that stretch back 120 years. While the discussion will detail the history of the women’s movements in each country, the speakers will also highlight the convergences and similarities between the Afghan and Iranian women’s rights movements. This history of women’s resistance is centrally important to Afghan and Iranian women’s struggles today.\n\nThe panel discussion will include brief presentations by both speakers, followed by a moderated discussion with the panel host and audience. The talk will be moderated by Lalita du Perron, Associate Director of the Stanford Center for South Asia, and Rachel Jean-Baptiste, Michelle Mercer and Bruce Golden Family Professorship in Feminist and Gender Studies, Director of the Program on Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and Professor of History.\n\nThis talk is presented by the Hoover Institution Library & Archives and co-sponsored by the Stanford Program in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and Stanford Center for South Asia.\n\nAbout the Speakers\n\nDr. Halima Kazem, HART Oral History Project Manager, is currently building an oral history archive on Afghanistan and the US Afghan war at the Hoover Institution Library & Archives. Halima is also a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she is producing a documentary about Afghan women’s struggle against the current Taliban regime. Halima holds a Ph.D. in feminist studies from UC Santa Cruz and a master’s in business and economic journalism from New York University.
