These are visas available for the following people:\n\nInterpreters who worked for the US military but not long enough to qualify for SIV,\n\nAfghan employees of a US news organization, and\n\nAfghans employed directly by a US NGO. (ex:Afghans who were employed directly by Indiana University, Ball State University, Kansas State University, Save the Children, International Assistance Mission, Reuters, Associated Press, etc.)\n\nIf you or a relative fit these categories, please complete this form.\n\nPriority 1 Visas:\n\nThese visas are available to refugees identified and referred to the program by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a US Embassy, or a designated non-governmental organization (NGO).\n\nPriority 3 Visas:\n\nThese visas are reserved for family reunification with immediate relatives already in the United States.\n\nHumanitarian parole can be requested by Afghans or sponsors who are outside of the United States. USCIS makes determinations for humanitarian parole, but generally the beneficiary must show particular vulnerabilities and significant family or other ties to the United States. Unlike a visa, parole does not give the beneficiary immigration status in the United States and they will still have to apply for an adjustment of status if they plan to stay beyond the duration of their parole.\n\nFor more information on humanitarian parole, please visit:\n\nhttps://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/information-for-afghan-nationals-on-parole-into-the-united-states"
