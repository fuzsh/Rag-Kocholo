        "text": "Important Notice: Reassigning SIV Cases from Embassy Kabul to Another Post\n\nOperations at U.S. Embassy Kabul have been suspended since August 31, 2021. We are unable to provide visa services, including visa interviews, in Afghanistan at this time. Applicants with an approved I-360 petition, who are ready to schedule their SIV interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate outside Afghanistan, should reach out to NVC NVCSIV@state.gov to have their case reassigned. Please do not request that your case be reassigned to a country you will not be able to travel to. Please note that SIV interviews can only be reassigned to U.S. embassies or consulates with immigrant visa processing capacity and that we cannot help you enter or obtain a visa for a third country. Applicants still undergoing COM or I-360 processing do not need to reassign their case.\n\nYour interview will be scheduled after you submit all required documents, making your case documentarily complete, and the receiving post has notified NVC they have interview capacity. NVC will send you an email notification when your interview is scheduled. SIV interviews are being prioritized by posts worldwide. However, interview wait times may vary post to post even for SIVs due to COVID-19 and other capacity limitations.\n\nIf you had an interview scheduled at Embassy Kabul and were unable to complete the interview due to the suspension of operations, you may email the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate with immigrant visa processing capacity that you are able to travel to and request an interview there. For contact information, please visit https://usembassy.gov. The response times may vary depending on the U.S. embassy or consulate. If you did not have an interview scheduled at Embassy Kabul, do not contact a U.S. embassy or consulate directly as they will be unable to reassign your interview.\n\nALL / ALL /\n\nImportant Notice: Litigation Matter\n\nNOTICE ON LITIGATION MATTER: Afghan and Iraqi Allies Under Serious Threat Because of Their Faithful Service to the United States, on Their Own and on Behalf of Others Similarly Situated, et al. v. Blinken, et al. No. 18-cv-01388-TSC (D.D.C.) and No. 20-5251 (D.C. Cir.).\n\nPlaintiffs (collectively a group of anonymous Afghan and Iraqi Special Immigration Visa (“SIV”) applicants) filed a class complaint against Defendants Antony J. Blinken, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of State, et al., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and Mandamus Act. Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants have unreasonably delayed the adjudication of SIV applications submitted by certain Iraqi and Afghan nationals under the Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act of 2007 (“RCIA”) and the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 (“AAPA”). Defendants deny many of these allegations.\n\nOn September 20, 2019, the district court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion, granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, in part, and declared Defendants’ delays in the processing and adjudication of the SIV applications to be unreasonable under the APA in light of AAPA § 602(b)(4) and RCIA § 1242(c)(1). On February 5, 2020, the district court certified a class that consists of all people (1) who applied for an Afghan or Iraqi SIV by submitting an application for Chief of Mission (“COM”) approval and (2) whose applications have been awaiting government action for longer than nine months. On June 14, 2020, the district court adopted a Joint Adjudication Plan that establishes a performance standard for each of the steps in the SIV application process and requires the Government to submit quarterly performance reports to the court.\n\nClass members covered by the Joint Adjudication Plan are all people who applied for an Afghan or Iraqi SIV pursuant to the AAPA, and RCIA, by submitting an application for COM approval, and whose applications have been awaiting government action for longer than 9 months, as of May 21, 2020, the date of the submission of the Joint Adjudication Plan. The following parameters are used to identify class members: individuals who—\n\n(1) submitted COM applications to the National Visa Center (“NVC”) prior to August 21, 2019, and whose COM applications are pending, either on original review or on appeal, or approved;\n\n(2) submitted COM applications to the NVC prior to August 21, 2019 and whose COM applications were denied after January 22, 2020 [i.e., case received date is earlier than August 21, 2019 AND (not approved/denial date) is later than January 22, 2020], and are still within the statutorily allotted 120-day time period for appealing the denial;\n\n(3) submitted I-360 petitions that are pending or were issued a notice of approval [i.e., (I-360 Filing Date) is earlier than May 21, 2020]; or\n\n(4) are pre- or post- visa application interview [i.e., who received a letter informing them that NVC has received their approved SIV petition earlier than May 21, 2020], including those refused under INA section 221(g) for administrative processing.\n\nOverview\n\nA special immigrant is a person who qualifies for lawful permanent residence under one of several programs. Section 602(b) of the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009, as amended, is a special immigrant program, which authorizes the issuance of Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) to Afghan nationals who meet certain requirements:\n\nhave been employed in Afghanistan for a period of at least one year between October 7, 2001 and December 31, 2023\n\nby, or on behalf of, the U.S. government; or\n\nby the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), or a successor mission (1) in a capacity that required you to serve as an interpreter or translator for U.S. military personnel while traveling off-base with U.S. military personnel stationed at ISAF, or a successor mission, or (2) to perform sensitive and trusted activities for U.S. military personnel stationed at ISAF, or a successor mission;\n\nhave provided faithful and valuable service to the U.S. government, or ISAF, or a successor mission, as applicable, which is documented in a positive letter of recommendation or evaluation from your senior supervisor or the person currently occupying that position, or a more senior person, if your senior supervisor has left the employer or has left Afghanistan; and\n\nhave experienced or be experiencing an ongoing serious threat as a consequence of their employment.\n\napply no later than December 31, 2024.\n\nFor more information about the relevant U.S. laws, see References - U.S. Laws. For frequently asked questions, see Afghan FAQs. For contact information, see Afghan Contact us.\n\nIn addition to the information on this website, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has posted on its website a fact sheet and information on Form I-360 petitions for this program.\n\nThis program is completely distinct from another program authorizing SIVs for certain Iraqi and Afghan translators/interpreters who worked directly with the United States Armed Forces or under COM authority, although some translators and interpreters may qualify under both programs. For information on that program, see Special Immigrant Visas for Iraqi and Afghan Translators/Interpreters.\n\nAfghans employed by an organization under a U.S. grant or cooperative agreement are not eligible for the SIV program; if you are unsure of whether this is the case, please inquire with your HR department before you apply for Chief of Mission approval. Afghans who were employed by contractors or subcontractors to work at ISAF, or a successor mission, also do not qualify for the SIV program.\n\nStep 1 - Collect Chief of Mission Documents and fill in the DS-157 Petition\n\nAfter you review the requirements for this program, you must collect the five (5) documents required to support your application for this program, including the Form DS-157 Petition for Special Immigrant Classification for Afghan SIV Applicants. Review the detailed Applicant Guidelines for Chief of Mission Approval for the required documents. Please do not submit anything other than what is listed unless we ask you to do so.\n\nImportant Notice on Missing Documents: If after reviewing the FAQs and a required document is unavailable, you must submit a detailed written explanation when you submit your application. The Chief of Mission designee will review your case. It is important to understand that, if you provide a statement of unavailability for a letter of employment or recommendation, the Chief of Mission cannot approve your case. If your case is pending and you later provide, or the U.S. government is able to obtain a letter of employment and recommendation on your behalf, it will be added to your file for COM review.\n\nMost scanning programs offer a preview function so you can make sure the document is easily read. If you cannot read the scanned document, re-scan it at a higher resolution. Keep in mind this means the saved file will be larger and you may need to compress the file before you upload it.\n\nCompressing a File\n\nCompression means saving your document in a smaller file size. This not only allows the file to take up less space on your hard drive but also means it can be uploaded or e-mailed much faster. However, not all file types are easily compressed. Most computer operating systems include an option to compress a file. This option is often found under “File” or “Save,” or appears when you right-click on a file name in a navigation screen. Look on the “Help” tool in your computer operating system for more information on what is available to you.\n\nThere is also third-party compression software available, both at no cost and for purchase. Please remember, the Department of State cannot accept files that have been “zipped.”\n\nOnce you have scanned your required documents, then continue to Step 3: Submit Documents.\n\nStep 5 - Submit Petition\n\nSIV Petition Fact Sheet (PDF-61.25 KB) - SIV Petition Fact Sheet_Pashto (PDF-129 KB) SIV Petition Fact Sheet_Dari (PDF-111 KB)\n\nStarting July 20, 2022, the Department of State and USCIS have combined two steps in the Afghan SIV application process: (1) the Chief of Mission approval, and (2) the SIV petition.\n\nThe old process, until July 20, 2022\n\nUntil July 20, 2022, Afghan SIV applicants had to apply for Chief of Mission (COM) approval with the U.S Department of State using the DS-157 form. Then after receiving COM approval, applicants had to file an I-360 petition for special immigrants with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as a separate step.\n\nThe new process, starting July 20, 2022\n\nBeginning July 20, 2022, new Afghan SIV applicants need to submit only a DS-157 form along with their COM approval application. The Department of State will process this form both for COM approval and as a special immigrant petition. New Afghan SIV applicants will no longer need to file an I-360 petition.\n\nIf you have not yet applied for an Afghan SIV\n\nFor new applications for Afghan SIVs, use the new DS-157. Get the new form at https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds157.pdf. Fill it out, sign it, and attach the rest of the documents needed for COM approval. Email the signed form and your supporting documentation to the National Visa Center (NVC) at AfghanSIVApplication@state.gov. If your application is approved, the NVC will send you an approval letter and instructions on how to continue the SIV application process.\n\nIf you have previously contacted the National Visa Center, but your application is not documentarily complete\n\nThe National Visa Center (NVC) needs a signed DS-157 from you to consider your application documentarily complete and ready for Chief of Mission review.\n\nIf you have already sent a signed DS-157 to the NVC, you don’t need to do anything. Your existing DS-157 will be used as your petition. If your application is approved, the NVC will send you an approval letter and instructions on how to continue the SIV application process.\n\nIf you have not already sent the NVC a DS-157 with your signature, then get the new form at https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds157.pdf. Fill it out, sign it, and attach the rest of the documents needed for COM approval. Email the signed form and your supporting documentation to the NVC at AfghanSIVApplication@state.gov. If your application is approved, the NVC will send you an approval letter and instructions on how to continue the SIV application process.\n\nIf you received Chief of Mission approval before July 20, 2022\n\nIf you are outside the United States and:\n\nIf you are IN the United States and:\n\nIf you receive Chief of Mission approval dated July 20, 2022 or later\n\nThe NVC will send you an approval letter and instructions on how to continue the SIV application process.\n\nInstructions for the DS-157\n\nAccess the DS-157 at https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds157.pdf. Fill it out, sign it, and attach the rest of the documents needed for COM approval, refer to the guidelines at Step 1 - Collect Chief of Mission Documents.\n\nInstructions for the I-360\n\nSubmit the following package of documents directly to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Nebraska Service Center:\n\nA completed Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant. [NOTE: To be properly filed, the Form I-360 must include your original signature.]\n\nA copy of your passport or tazkera showing that you are a national of Afghanistan, along with a certified English translation, if the document is not in English.\n\nA copy of the letter of recommendation that you sent to NVC when you applied for Chief of Mission (COM) Approval.\n\nA copy of your Chief of Mission approval\n\nIf you are in the United States when you file the petition, a copy of the front and back of your paper Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record. If you entered the United States after the automation of Form I-94, and your Arrival/Departure Record was created electronically, you may obtain a paper Form I-94 at http://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/i-94-instructions.\n\nTo learn more about USCIS and to access forms and instructions, please click here.\n\nStep 6 - NVC Processing\n\nStarting July 20, 2022, the Form DS-157 Petition for Special Immigrant Classification for Afghan SIV Applicants which you must file together with your COM application, will be processed by the COM or COM Designee as your special immigrant petition. Under this new petition process, starting July 20, 2022, if you are granted COM and petition approval, NVC will send you an approval letter and instructions on how to continue the SIV application process. Some Afghan SIV applicants may however still be required to file an I-360 petition with USCIS. For those applicants only after USCIS approves your petition, they will transfer your case to the Department of State's National Visa Center (NVC). NVC will send you a Welcome Letter by e-mail. With the information in this letter, you can log in to our Consular Electronic Application Center (CEAC) to complete your Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration (Form DS-260) and submit your supporting documents.\n\nOnce you submit forms and supporting documents to NVC, we will review your case to ensure you provided all the documentation required to schedule the immigrant visa interview. Interviews are based on the availability of appointments offered at the Embassy/Consulate. Operations at U.S. Embassy Kabul have been suspended since August 31, 2021. We are unable to provide visa services, including visa interviews, in Afghanistan at this time\n\nYou must provide an email address to facilitate communication with NVC. You may contact NVC by email at NVCSIV@state.gov.\n\nImportant Notice: Termination of Registration:\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 203(g) provides that the “Secretary of State shall terminate the registration (petition) of any alien who fails to apply for an immigrant visa within one year” of notice of visa availability. The petition may be reinstated if, within two years of notice of visa availability, the alien establishes that the “failure to apply was for reasons beyond the alien’s control.” Therefore, if you do not respond to notices from NVC within one year you risk termination of your petition under this section of law and would lose the benefits of that petition, such as your priority date.\n\nIf you believe that you have an approved petition, but you have not been contacted by NVC, or you have questions about your pending SIV case after the petition has been approved, please email NVC at NVCSIV@state.gov or call 1-603-334-0828 and provide your U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) receipt number, full name, and date of birth. Customer Service Representatives at NVC are available from 7:30 a.m. to midnight (EST).\n\nStep 8 - Collect Documents\n\nAfter you complete your DS-260(s), you and each family member immigrating with you MUST collect the civil documents required to support your visa application.\n\nYour civil documents MUST be issued by the official issuing authority in your country. Please refer to the Document Finder to learn about the civil document requirements for each country.\n\nPlease note that all documents not written in English, or in the official language of the country from which you are applying, must be accompanied by certified translations. The translation must include a statement signed by the translator stating that:\n\nThe translation is accurate, and\n\nThe translator is competent to translate.\n\nImportant Notice on Missing Documents: If a required document is unavailable per the country-specific guidelines, you do not need to scan the document into your CEAC. However, if you cannot obtain a required document for another reason, you must submit a detailed written explanation to NVC when you scan your other documents. During your visa interview, the consular officer will determine whether you must obtain the missing document before a visa can be issued. As a general rule, any document that is listed as “available” on the country-specific guidelines must be reviewed by a consular officer. Failure to obtain all required documents will delay your case.\n\nA copy of the biodata page from the passport of each applicant;\n\nScanned copies of a birth certificate/tazkera for each applicant, and any other civil documents showing the relationship between you and your spouse and/or minor children (e.g. marriage (Nikah Khet) and divorce certificates, adoption decrees, etc.);\n\nPolice certificates are NOT required if you are a resident of Afghanistan. However, if you have lived in a different country for more than 12 months since reaching the age of 16, then you must submit a police certificate from the authorities of that locality. See additional information how to obtain a police certificate.\n\nA completed Refugee Benefits Election Form (PDF - 364 KB). Please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions for more information resettlement benefits;\n\nA completed DS-0234, Special Immigrant Visa Biodata Form (PDF - 312 KB) for each family member immigrating with you.\n\nStep 9: Scan Collected Documents\n\nOnce you have collected all the necessary documents, you must scan and save them.\n\nIn order to scan your documents, you will need access to a computer and scanner or a smartphone with an internet connection. Note: If you choose to use a public computer, be sure to delete your scanned documents once you have finished uploading them.\n\nIn order to ensure your case does not experience delays in processing, follow these guidelines when scanning your documents:\n\nRequirements:\n\nSingle File Size and Type\n\nAcceptable file types include .pdf (preferred) .jpg, and .jpeg\n\nEach individual file (scanned document) must be no larger than 4 MB (megabytes).\n\nScan your multiple page documents, such as your letter of recommendation, as one file. If the document size is more than 2 MB, compress the file.\n\n“Zipped” files, modifiable PDFs, or password-protected files will not be accepted.\n\nImage Quality\n\nYour scans must:\n\nInclude the front and back side of any document that has stamps, seals, or writing on the back.\n\nMost scanning programs offer a preview function so you can make sure the document is easily read. If you cannot read the scanned document, re-scan it at a higher resolution. Keep in mind this means the saved file will be larger and you may need to compress the file before you upload it.\n\nCompressing a File\n\nCompression means saving your document in a smaller file size. This not only allows the file to take up less space on your hard drive but also means it can be uploaded or e-mailed much faster. However, not all file types are easily compressed. Most computer operating systems include an option to compress a file. This option is often found under “File” or “Save,” or appears when you right-click on a file name in a navigation screen. Look on the “Help” tool in your computer operating system for more information on what is available to you.\n\nThere is also third-party compression software available, both at no cost and for purchase. Please remember, the Department of State cannot accept files that have been “zipped.”"
