        "text": "Birth Certificates\n\nAvailable:\n\nNot required for IV purposes, see Comments below\n\nFees: Varies\n\nDocument Name: Varies. Acceptable names include:\n\nKart Tawalod (Da Zokry Sanad)\n\nBirth Certificate\n\nBirth Registration Card\n\nIssuing Authority: Varies. Acceptable authorities include:\n\nClinics and hospitals\n\nNational Statistic Information Authority (NSIA)\n\nEmbassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\n\nSpecial Seal(s) / Color / Format: Varies considerably depending on which authority is issuing the birth certificate. May be:\n\nYellow Card\n\nThe NSIA yellow document is issued in Afghanistan and is a yellow one-page document listing Tazkera) Information, as well as “Birth Registration Card” information, and including the photo of the child. The Birth Registration portion includes the child’s biographical information. The document will have several seals and signatures.\n\nThe birth certificates issued by the Embassy of Afghanistan to children born outside of Afghanistan may be a white one-page document listing the child’s birth information, including: child’s names, mother’s names, father’s names, place of birth, date of birth, ID number, and gender. The document will have the seal and Embassy local address at the top and the signature and seal of the consular officer at the bottom.\n\nIssuing Authority Personnel Title: Varies considerably depending on which authority is issuing the document. May be:\n\nAdministrative staff\n\nHead of Population Registration Services\n\nDirector of NSIA\n\nEmbassy Consular Section\n\nRegistration Criteria: Issued for children who were delivered at a registered clinic or hospital.\n\nProcedure for Obtaining: Parents must present their Tazkeras to the appropriate staff at the clinic or hospital where the child was born.\n\nCertified Copies Available: Certified copies are available.\n\nAlternate Documents: After issuance at the hospital, Kart Tawalods may be registered with the Ministry of Interior’s Population Registration Department and a record is also kept by the Ministry of Public Health. The kart tawalod is not the primary means of establishing identity or citizenship in Afghanistan – rather it is considered as supplemental evidence of birth. The Tazkera is the principal document used in official settings for proof of identity, citizenship, and also used as a quasi-birth record. All Afghan applicants applying for U.S. immigrant, special immigrant, or other such visas must present a Tazkera, regardless of whether they also choose to submit a kart tawalod.\n\nFor children born outside of Afghanistan, a “birth declaration” provided by the local hospital and issued by the local Department of Health can be presented at the nearest Embassy of Afghanistan branch office, which will then issue an Afghan birth certificate.\n\nCorrected birth certificates will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis but are usually not accepted.\n\nExceptions: None\n\nComments: All Afghan citizens should be able to present a Tazkera as proof of their identity and their birth place. Kart tawalod may be considered as supplementary documentation but should not be utilized as primary evidence of date and/or place of birth or identity. Please refer to the National ID section for information on Tazkeras.\n\nThat Kart Tawalod is one of the few Afghan civil documents that lists the mother of a child. Although not a required document, the Kart Tawalod may assist in establishing the relationship between a child/applicant and their mother.\n\nDeath Certificates\n\nAvailable\n\nFees: There are no fees.\n\nDocument Name: Sanad Wafat (Da Marani Sanad), Death Letter (English)\n\nIssuing Authority: Afghanistan Central Civil Registration Authorities (ACCRA) and Population Registration Department (PRD) of the Ministry of Interior. Also issued by hospitals, the Ministry of Public Health, and Afghan Courts\n\nSpecial Seal(s) / Color / Format: Varies considerably depending on which authority is issuing the death certificate\n\nIssuing Authority Personnel Title: Varies. Acceptable authorities include:\n\nAfghanistan Central Civil Registration Authorities (ACCRA) - for death certificates issued prior to 2019\n\nPopulation Registration Department (PRD) of the Ministry of Interior\n\nHospitals\n\nMinistry of Public Health\n\nAfghan Courts\n\nNational Statistic and Information Authority (NSIA) - for death certificates issued after 2018\n\nSpecial Seal(s) / Color / Format: Varies considerably depending on which authority is issuing the death certificate.\n\nIssuing Authority Personnel Title: Varies considerably depending on which authority is issuing the document.\n\nRegistration Criteria: Death certificates are only issued to Afghan citizens\n\nProcedure for Obtaining: A family member of the deceased may file a request for a death certificate with NSIA. The requester will be issued a form that must be signed by his/her Area Representative (Wakil Guzar) and two witnesses to verify that the death occurred. If a person dies in a hospital, a letter from the hospital can be attached as additional evidence of the death. Once the form has been signed by all parties, the requester submits it back to NSIA and a death certificate is issued.\n\nIf the death occurs in a rural area, the requester must file an application with the District Governor’s office. The village representative or Malik (influential elder) from the requestor’s village and two witnesses will be asked to confirm the death. Based on this confirmation, the District Governor’s office will attest that the death occurred and issue a document which can be presented to NSIA to obtain the official death certificate.\n\nCertified Copies Available: Certified copies are available.\n\nAlternate Documents: There are no alternate documents.\n\nExceptions: None\n\nComments: Timely registration of deaths is not common in Afghanistan. Typically, a death certificate is only requested and obtained as part of an official requirement such as resolution of an inheritance, request for governmental compensation, or when applying for a foreign visa.\n\nThe Afghan death certificate of a husband/father is vital for confirming the relationship of a wife/mother to the father of the children. When no other civil document is available to prove a mother/wife’s relationship to her children, her name on the Afghan death certificate [DJA1] helps a woman verify their relationship.\n\nMarriage Certificates\n\nAvailable\n\nFees: Varies\n\nDocument Name: Nekah Khat or Sharaei Waseqa Khat; Marriage Certificate (English)\n\nIssuing Authority: Varies. Acceptable authorities include:\n\nPrimary Court, Conduct Court, Family Court.\n\nEmbassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\n\nSpecial Seal(s) / Color / Format: Varies considerably depending on which authority is issuing the marriage certificate. May be:\n\nThe Nekah Khat is a green booklet with photos of the bride, groom, and two witnesses.\n\nThe Sharaei Waseqa Khat is a white one-page document with photos of the bride, groom, and five witnesses.\n\nReplacement marriage certificates issued by the Embassy of Afghanistan are a white one-page document with photos of the bride, groom, and two witnesses.\n\nIssuing Authority Personnel Title: Varies considerably depending on which authority is issuing the document. May be:\n\nCourt Administrator\n\nEmbassy Consular Section\n\nRegistration Criteria: Tazkeras and passport-sized photos of the bride, groom, and each witness\n\nProcedure for Obtaining: Either the groom, the bride and groom together, or a relative submits an application to the Conduct Court, along with the Tazkeras and photos of the bride and groom. The court’s Administrative Office will issue a form which is then taken to the couple’s Area Representative (Wakil Gozar) to certify that the marriage occurred. The groom, bride, and witnesses will then be interviewed by a judge. (If either the husband or wife is unable to appear in-person, he/she may be represented by an authorized lawyer.) If the judge authorizes the issuance of the Nekah Khat booklet, it must then be taken to the Supreme Court for certification.\n\nApplicants outside of Afghanistan may request a replacement marriage certificate at the nearest Embassy of Afghanistan, if originals are unavailable.\n\nCertified Copies Available: Certified copies are available.\n\nAlternate Documents: To obtain a Sharaei Waseqa Khat, an application must be submitted to the Primary Court or Conduct Court. The requestor must present original Tazkeras of the bride and groom along with passport-sized photos of each. Additionally, five witnesses will need to appear before the judge to swear that the wedding took place. The judge will then prepare the Sharaie Waseqa Khat, which includes the date of marriage, signatures and thumb prints of the bride, groom, and witnesses, and photos of all parties. The Primary Court or Conduct Court will register the Shariae Waseqa Khat, after which it must then be taken to the Supreme Court for certification.\n\nExceptions: None\n\nComments: Marriages are often only recorded when evidence is required for an official purpose such as immigration. Outside of major cities, a married woman might not be permitted to register her own marriage, and may also have scant knowledge of the individuals who served as witnesses for the court process.\n\nThe Afghan marriage certificate is often the only official record or proof of a woman's relationship as a wife/mother to the children's father. Therefore, the marriage certificate may be the only civil document to help establish a female applicant's familial relationships.\n\nDivorce Certificates\n\nAvailable\n\nFees: There are no fees.\n\nDocument Name: Talaq Khat\n\nIssuing Authority: Supreme Court\n\nSpecial Seal(s) / Color / Format: Booklet or two-sided document\n\nIssuing Authority Personnel Title: Administrative staff\n\nRegistration Criteria: Divorce in Afghanistan is a complicated process, as is the issuance process for a divorce certificate. Individuals seeking divorce certificates are recommended to consult a legal expert for the process that best fits their particular circumstances.\n\nProcedure for Obtaining: As mentioned previously, individuals seeking a divorce certificate in Afghanistan are recommended to consult with a legal advisor. The following is just one mechanism for obtaining a divorce certificate:\n\nIf a man in Afghanistan wants to obtain a Talaq Khat, he can submit an application to the Family Court, along with his marriage certificate, his and his wife’s tazkeras (national identity document), and their photos. The Family Court will issue a form, which is then taken to the requestor’s police district office and Regional Representative for certification. Once the form is submitted back to the Family Court, the husband and wife will be scheduled for an interview by a judge. The judge may order a pause in the proceedings to encourage the couple to make one last attempt at reconciliation or may proceed with issuing a divorce order. Administrative personnel will then prepare the Talaq Khat. The husband, wife, and two witnesses must then return to court to sign the Talaq Khat, which is then passed to the Supreme Court for final signature.\n\nCertified Copies Available: Certified copies are available.\n\nAlternate Documents: Hand-written divorce letters are sometimes executed by a husband or wife, but such documents are not legally recognized.\n\nExceptions: None\n\nComments: Divorce is still rare in Afghanistan.\n\nAdoption Certificates\n\nUnavailable: Adoption is illegal under Islamic law.\n\nGuardianship Certificates\n\nAvailable\n\nFees: There are no fees.\n\nDocument Name: Sanad e Sarparasti/Sarparasti Khat\n\nIssuing Authority: Family Court\n\nSpecial Seal(s) / Color / Format: An A4 sized, two-sided document, usually printed in two colors\n\nIssuing Authority Personnel Title: Administrative staff\n\nRegistration Criteria: The child’s current guardian and the guardian-to-be must appear in-person with witnesses and present their tazkeras (national identity documents) and passport-sized photos, along with confirmation from the Area Representative (Wakil Gozar). If the guardian or guardian-to-be is from a rural area, confirmation from the village Malik (respected elder) is also required.\n\nProcedure for Obtaining: Guardianship applications are filed with the Family Court. The prospective guardian(s) will complete a form attesting that they are in compliance with Afghan guardianship criteria. The form must then be certified by the prospective guardian’s District Police Office and Area Representative, after which it is returned to the Family Court. A judge will review the guardianship package and, if approved, a guardianship order will be issued. If the prospective guardians reside in Afghanistan, they are required to provide periodic updates on the child’s well-being to the court.\n\nCertified Copies Available: Certified copies are available.\n\nAlternate Documents: There are no alternate documents.\n\nExceptions: None\n\nComments: Formal guardianship through a court process is still a new phenomenon in Afghanistan. It is not the equivalent of an adoption. If children become orphans in Afghanistan, it is common for them to move-in with family members. These arrangements are generally informal and rarely documented through an official guardianship court process.\n\nNational ID Cards (Tazkera)\n\nAvailable\n\nFees: Varies\n\nDocument Name: Tazkera\n\nIssuing Authority: Varies. Acceptable authorities include:\n\nAfghanistan Central Civil Registration Authorities (ACCRA) - for Tazkeras issued prior to 2019\n\nPopulation Registration Department (PRD) of Ministry of Interior (MOI)\n\nNational Statistics and Information Authority (NSIA) - for Tazkeras issued after 2018\n\nSpecial Seal(s) / Color / Format: Afghanistan has two kinds of Tazkeras. Both are available and legal in the country:\n\nOld Tazkera: A4-sized Paper with border. Adult Tazkeras always include a photo. Available in all provinces and in districts.\n\nElectronic Tazkera: Size of a business card with a chip on it.\n\nIssuing Authority Personnel Title: The issuing authority varies based on whether the process started at the district or provincial level, and whether the application is for a paper or an electronic Tazkera.\n\nRegistration Criteria: Applicant must submit the application form, his/her father’s Tazkera, and passport-sized photos. If the father’s Tazkera is not available, a different relative on the father’s side (such as the father’s sibling or aunt/uncle) may be substituted.\n\nProcedure for Obtaining: The first step is to confirm the applicant’s identity. In a city or larger town, this confirmation will be handled by an Area Representative (Wakil Gozar), while applicants from villages will use a Malik (respected elder). After the applicant’s identity is recorded, the individual can apply for a Tazkera with the Ministry of Interior. The Tazkera lists the holder’s name, date and place of birth, basic physical description, military service, religion, marital status, profession/employment and also includes a photo. The document also lists the holder’s age as of the year the document was issued, but this is usually just an estimate as birth records are seldom available. Applicants over age 7 must apply in-person and submit a thumb print. Parents may apply for a Tazkera on behalf of their children. Applicants outside of Afghanistan should contact their nearest Afghan Embassy or Consulate on how to obtain a Tazkera. The application for electronic Tazkeras is done online (https://nid.nsia.gov.af/individual-form). Following the online application, a confirmation with a tracking code and a printing date is provided to the applicant, and all applicants must follow a biometric process.\n\nCertified Copies Available: The paper-based Tazkera is printed by the Ministry of Finance with a tracking number, and then it is distributed in all provinces. Certified copies are available.\n\nAlternate Documents: Legacy paper Tazkera, instead of a modern ID card with a chip, are acceptable.\n\nSome alternate legacy Tazkeras issued by PRD can be booklet size.\n\nExceptions: None\n\nComments: It is required for all Afghan citizens who are applying for immigrant, special immigrant, or other such visas to submit a Tazkera, as proof of identity and birth. Some Afghan citizens may also possess birth certificates issued by clinics or hospitals in Afghanistan, but these documents are not accepted for U.S. visa processing. All Tazkeras must be accompanied by a certified English translation.\n\nTypes Available:\n\nTourist Passport: Distributed by the Ministry of Interior via the Directorate of Passports\n\nDiplomatic Passport: Given to diplomats and senior members of the government and issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOfficial/Service passport: Given to non-senior members of the government\n\nSpecial Passport: Given to non-senior members of the government at or below management level\n\nTravel Document\n\nFees: Varies based on type and validity of passport. Based on new policy all recent passports are being issued for 10 years.\n\n5 years: 5200 AFs\n\n10 years: 10.400 AF\n\nIssuing Government Authority: Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nSpecial Seal(s) / Color / Format: Regular Passport (cyan blue-green cover); Diplomatic Passport (black cover (as of late 2017), previously cover was navy blue in color); Official/Service Passport (red cover); Special Passport (navy blue cover, issuance started in late 2017); and Travel Document (baby blue cover)\n\nPassports newly issued by some consulates overseas may not include a chip, as they are locally produced.\n\nPassport extensions are currently available in some countries outside of Afghanistan. Passport extensions issued by the Embassy of Afghanistan will consist of a sticker that includes the passport holder’s biographical information and will be resemble a visa pasted on one of the existing passport blank pages.\n\nIssuing Authority Personnel Title: Passport Department staff\n\nRegistration Criteria: Afghan citizen\n\nProcedure for Obtaining: Applicants residing in Kabul generally apply at the Ministry of Interior Passport Department. Applicants in other parts of the country apply at their Provincial Passport Office, which will forward the application to the Kabul Passport Department for issuance. Applicants applying for a regular passport must submit an application along with a copy of their original attested Tazkera and passport-sized photos. A bio data form will be completed, and then the applicants are scheduled for biometric appointments. Each applicant is given an invoice (Tarofa) which must be paid at a bank, with the payment confirmation returned to the Passport Department. Once proof of payment is received, the applicant will be notified when to pick up the passport. Applicants applying outside of Kabul will retrieve their passports from the Provincial Passport Office. Applicants outside of Afghanistan should contact their nearest Afghan Embassy or Consulate. Applicants outside of Afghanistan may apply for a two-year extension to validity of existing passports at the nearest Embassy of Afghanistan, if they are unable to apply for a new passport.\n\nAlternate Documents: There are no alternate documents.\n\nExceptions: None\n\nComments: Previously issued handwritten passports are no longer valid for air travel by the Afghan government and the International Civil Aviation Organization; all such travelers are required to possess machine-readable passport. Biographic information in machine-readable passports frequently does not match biographic information contained in older handwritten passports.\n\nIn 2017, Afghanistan started producing navy blue Special Passports, available to retired government officials and sportsmen. The light blue colored Travel Document, containing only four pages for visas and stamps, is used to document Afghan citizens who are being repatriated back to Afghanistan. Applicants without passports can get issued visas on DS-232s."
