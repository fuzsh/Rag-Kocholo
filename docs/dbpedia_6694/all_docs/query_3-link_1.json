All made start-to-finish with fair trade standards.\n\nPreserving An Ancient Craft\n\nThis initiative is to ensure the art and beauty of Afghan rugs lives on today. The rich history of carpet weaving runs through the heart of Afghanistan’s heritage, with prints, patterns, and techniques that have spanned thousands of years.\n\nBehind the Designs"
