A report by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in June said that 14 million people - more than a third of the population - were suffering from hunger.\n\nMary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP country director for Afghanistan, said last week that unless emergency food and medical supplies arrived soon, the \"already horrendous situation\" would become \"an absolute catastrophe, a complete humanitarian disaster\".\n\nWhere do Afghan refugees go?\n\nNeighbouring countries Pakistan and Iran saw the highest numbers of Afghanistan's refugees and asylum seekers last year.\n\nAlmost 1.5 million fled to Pakistan in 2020, while Iran hosted 780,000, according to UNHCR figures.\n\nGermany was third, with more than 180,000, while Turkey took nearly 130,000.\n\nWhen looking at asylum seeker numbers only - those who have applied for sanctuary in another country but whose claims have not yet been granted - Turkey, Germany and Greece top the list, with about 125,000, 33,000 and 20,000 respectively.\n\nAlthough there are no Afghan asylum seekers in Iran, those with refugee cards - an official document recognising their status - are able to access the country's health and education systems.\n\nWhat are countries doing to help?\n\nThe UN has called on its member states to help Afghan people in \"their darkest hour of need\" - but while some countries have offered refugees a safe haven, others have indicated they will not be giving sanctuary to those fleeing the crisis.\n\nBoth Pakistan and Iran have said that they cannot cope with a further influx of Afghan refugees. Officials in both countries have said that any refugees that do arrive will have to stay in camps near the border until they can return to Afghanistan.\n\nUzbekistan has said it will help transfer Afghans to third countries but will only host refugees temporarily. The Tajikistan government previously offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees but it's unclear if any have been allowed in yet. Turkmenistan has said its airspace can be used for evacuation flights but it hasn't made any commitment to take in refugees itself.\n\nIn Turkey, the government has urged European countries to take responsibility for any new migrant crisis, saying Turkey would not be \"Europe's migrant storage unit\". The country has stepped up construction of a border wall with Iran to thwart those entering illegally.\n\nOfficials in several European Union countries say they are keen to avoid a repeat of the 2015 migrant crisis, when there was a populist backlash against large numbers of Syrian refugees being allowed to enter EU territory.\n\nFrance, which evacuated more than 2,800 people from Kabul airport, mostly Afghans, has indicated it will accept some refugees but has not specified a number. Germany has also not specified a number but Chancellor Angela Merkel has said as many as 40,000 people still in the country may have a right to be evacuated to Germany if they feel they are endangered.\n\nThe UK has said it will take in 5,000 Afghans in 2021 as part of a scheme to resettle 20,000 over the next few years, focusing on those at greatest risk from the Taliban.\n\nThe US has not said how many refugees it will accept yet, but it has authorised $500m (£367m) for \"unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs of refugees\". Canada has said that it will resettle 20,000 Afghans while Australia has said it will take in 3,000."
