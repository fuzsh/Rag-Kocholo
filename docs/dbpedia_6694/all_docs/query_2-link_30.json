        "text": "The Afghan War, a complex and enduring conflict, has been a significant setting in numerous literary and cinematic creations. Four notable works, Khaled Hosseini’s novel The Kite Runner, the movies Charlie Wilson’s War and Brothers, and Brian Van Reet’s short story “Big two-hearted Hunting Creek”, present diverse perspectives on a tumultuous period in Afghanistan’s history, covering, notably, the Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989), the subsequent civil war in Afghanistan, the rise of the Taliban regime, and the involvement of the United States in the early 2000s following the 9/11 attacks. Each work focuses on different aspects and timeframes within this multifaceted conflict, providing diverse perspectives on the complex history of Afghanistan and its armed struggles.\n\nThe repercussions of the Soviet-Afghan War extended well beyond its conclusion, leading to a power vacuum and internal conflicts that shaped Afghanistan’s destiny. The War stemmed from a complex web of socio-political upheavals that gripped Afghanistan in the late 1970s. The origins of this conflict can be traced back to a coup that took place in 1978, which led to internal instability and the establishment of a radical communist government taking control. In response to this, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979, deploying troops to support the new regime.\n\nThe Soviet intervention marked the beginning of the Soviet-Afghan War, a prolonged conflict characterized by clashes between the Soviet-backed government and Afghan resistance fighters known as the Mujahideen. This period was marked by intense armed conflict, widespread destruction, and significant human suffering. During this time, the United States covertly supported Afghan rebels through Operation Cyclone, an initiative aimed at providing financial and military aid to the Mujahideen. Figures like Congressman Charlie Wilson played instrumental roles in securing substantial support for the Afghan resistance, effectively altering the trajectory of the conflict. This covert assistance was a pivotal factor in the eventual withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan by 1989.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal was marked by political instability, internal strife, and a power vacuum in Afghanistan. This turmoil led to a devastating civil war between various factions competing for control. Amidst this chaos, the Taliban, an extremist group, gradually gained control over parts of Afghanistan, imposing a harsh interpretation of Islamic law. By the mid-1990s, the Taliban had established control over most of Afghanistan. Their oppressive regime led to widespread human rights abuses, particularly affecting women and minorities, and attracted international condemnation. Afghanistan became a haven for extremist groups, including Al-Qaeda, which orchestrated the infamous 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. In response to the attacks, the United States, supported by a coalition of allies, launched a military campaign against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. This marked the beginning of the U.S. military involvement in the region, aimed at dismantling terrorist networks and ousting the Taliban from power. The subsequent years witnessed intense military operations, attempts at nation-building, and efforts to establish stability in Afghanistan. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini, published in 2003, delves into the lives of individuals deeply affected by the Soviet invasion, civil unrest, and the rise of the Taliban, providing an intimate view of the impact of the Afghan War on ordinary citizens. Hosseini offers a poignant portrayal of the Soviet-Afghan War and its far-reaching aftermath, providing an intimate portrayal of the complexities of friendship, betrayal, and redemption set against the backdrop of a nation ravaged by conflict. Charlie Wilson’s War (2007) focuses on the behind-the-scenes political maneuvers and covert operations carried out by the United States during the Soviet-Afghan conflict. Based on the account of the aforementioned American Congressman Charlie Wilson and CIA operative Gust Avrakotos, who supported the Afghan Mujahideen during the War, the movie sheds light on the intricacies of international intervention, exposing the far-reaching ramifications of geopolitical decisions during this turbulent period. Brothers (2009) explores the psychological toll of war on individuals and families. It follows the story of the return of a soldier from Afghanistan, grappling with the trauma of combat and the challenges of reintegrating into civilian life. The aftermath of these events and the prolonged conflict form the backdrop of Brothers. It masterfully delves into the psychological and emotional toll of war on soldiers in a nation ravaged by conflict and instability. “Tips for a Smooth Transition” by Siobhan Fallon is part of the collection Fire and Forget: Short Stories from the Long War (2013). The author introduces us to Colin, who returns home from Afghanistan after his third deployment. The story brilliantly depicts his thoughts and concerns as a returning soldier, and the challenges of dealing with the perceived danger, unreachability, and unpredictability that often surround soldiers returning from conflict.\n\nThe selected works, spanning both literature and film, present multifaceted viewpoints on the Afghan War. They depict the conflict’s impacts on individuals, societies, and geopolitics, thereby offering insights into the complexities and nuances of this prolonged and transformative period in Afghanistan’s history.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBrothers.
