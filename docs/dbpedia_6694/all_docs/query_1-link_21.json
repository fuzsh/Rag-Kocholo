        "text": "Open-File Report 2006-1038\n\nVersion 2.0\n\nGeologic and Mineral Resource Map of Afghanistan\n\nCompiled by Jeff L. Doebrich and Ronald R. Wahl\n\nWith contributions by Stephen D. Ludington, Peter G. Chirico, Craig J. Wandrey, Robert G. Bohannon, Greta J. Orris, James D. Bliss, Abdul Wasy, and Mohammad O. Younusi\n\nScale 1:850,000\n\nData Summary\n\nThe geologic and mineral resource information shown on this map is derived from digitization of the original data from Abdullah and Chmyriov (1977) and Abdullah and others (1977). The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has made no attempt to modify original geologic map-unit boundaries and faults as presented in Abdullah and Chmyriov (1977); however, modifications to map-unit symbology, and minor modifications to map-unit descriptions, have been made to clarify lithostratigraphy and to modernize terminology. Labeling of map units has not been attempted where they are small or narrow, in order to maintain legibility and to preserve the map's utility in illustrating regional geologic and structural relations. Users are encouraged to refer to the series of USGS/AGS (Afghan Geological Survey) 1:250,000-scale geologic quadrangle maps of Afghanistan that are being released concurrently as open-file reports.\n\nThe classification of mineral deposit types is based on the authors' interpretation of existing descriptive information (Abdullah and others, 1977; Bowersox and Chamberlin, 1995; Orris and Bliss, 2002) and on limited field investigations by the authors. Deposit-type nomenclature used for nonfuel minerals is modified from published USGS deposit-model classifications, as compiled in Stoeser and Heran (2000). New petroleum localities are based on research of archival data by the authors.\n\nThe shaded-relief base is derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data having 85-meter resolution. Gaps in the original SRTM DEM dataset were filled with data digitized from contours on 1:200,000-scale Soviet General Staff Sheets (1978Â–1997). The marginal extent of geologic units corresponds to the position of the international boundary as defined by Abdullah and Chmyriov (1977), and the international boundary as shown on this map was acquired from the Afghanistan Information Management Service (AIMS) Web site (http://www.aims.org.af) in September 2005. Non-coincidence of these boundaries is due to differences in the respective data sources and to inexact registration of the geologic data to the DEM base. Province boundaries, province capital locations, and political names were also acquired from the AIMS Web site in September 2005. The AIMS data were originally derived from maps produced by the Afghanistan Geodesy and Cartography Head Office (AGCHO).\n\nVersion 2 differs from Version 1 in that (1) map units are colored according to the color scheme of the Commission for the Geological Map of the World (CGMW) (http://www.ccgm.org), (2) the minerals database has been updated, and (3) all data presented on the map are also available in GIS format.\n\nThumbnail image of Geologic and Mineral Resource Map of Afghanistan, which measures 76 by 54 inches.\n\nReport Availability\n\nThis report is available in PDF format. Two versions of the map exist. The larger version (171 MB) is fully editable in Adobe Illustrator. This version will not print. The smaller version (26 MB) is rasterized and is for viewing or printing on a plotter. To download the PDF files, right-click (PC) or control-click (Macintosh) the links.\n\nOpen-File Report 2006-1038 [26-MB PDF file for viewing or plotting]\n\nOpen-File Report 2006-1038 [171-MB, editable PDF file]\n\nDownload Adobe Reader free of charge.\n\nTo order maps, publications, and other miscellaneous products on paper and compact disc media from the USGS:"
