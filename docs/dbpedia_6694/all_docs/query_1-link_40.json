We cannot promise anything, but Rep. Bera’s office is doing everything it can to assist any American and Afghan ally and their families who are at risk in Afghanistan.\n\nCurrently, there are few ways to seek safety and assistance from the U.S. government. It depends on the individual’s status. The situation is evolving rapidly, which may affect how up-to-date this information is. Below identifies some options:\n\nIt is recommended that anyone trying to travel around Afghanistan wipe their phones so that they have no social media or other files that would provoke the Taliban. Travelers should travel light, with just what they need for kids (food) and medicines. Lines are extremely long at airports.\n\nShould you need more information, please contact:\n\nCAIR San Diego at 858.278.4547 or bit.ly/cairla-immigration"
