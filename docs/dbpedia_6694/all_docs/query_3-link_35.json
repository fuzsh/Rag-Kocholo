        "text": "The High-level Pledging Event on Supporting the Humanitarian Response in Afghanistan 2022 took place on Thursday, 31 March 2022, 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Geneva / 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. New York / 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Kabul. The meeting was convened by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, joined by Member State co-hosts including the Governments of Qatar, the United Kingdom and Germany. The meeting was held at ministerial level and took place online through a virtual platform.\n\nBackground\n\nWhile Afghanistan has long had persistent humanitarian needs due to years of conflict and recurring drought, the current situation is unparalleled, with more than 24.4 million people requiring humanitarian assistance to survive. Food security levels have plunged at a rate not seen elsewhere in such a short period, with half the population facing acute hunger, including 9 million people in emergency food insecurity – the highest number globally. Malnutrition is on the rise, and livelihoods have been destroyed.\n\nFrontline international and Afghan partners continue to deliver humanitarian aid under some of the most challenging circumstances and continue to scale up operations. Meanwhile, humanitarian access to reach all vulnerable populations throughout the country has improved. The international community has demonstrated its support for the people of Afghanistan, contributing generously to the humanitarian response in 2021. However, humanitarian financial requirements have since tripled. At the start of 2022, over US$4.4 billion is required through the Afghanistan Humanitarian Response Plan to avert even worse disaster.\n\nThe consequences of inaction will be swift and severe – and difficult, if not impossible, to reverse. It is crucial that humanitarian funding is scaled up over the remainder of the year, while remaining flexible and responsive to escalating needs. Economic collapse and gaps in social services have been significant drivers of the deteriorating humanitarian situation.\n\nIn the spirit of global solidarity, the international community must come together and centre its response closely on the voices and needs of all the Afghan people who are affected by the crisis – particularly women, girls and minority groups.\n\nMeeting Objectives\n\nSecure scaled-up resources to address the unprecedented level of humanitarian needs in Afghanistan in 2022.\n\nHighlight the capacity and commitment of humanitarian partners to implement lifesaving assistance across the country.\n\nRaise awareness of other challenges that are also critical to the survival of Afghanistan’s people, including basic needs, the functioning of its economy and availability of basic social services, while taking into account the political realities and situation on the ground.\n\nEvent Details\n\nThe event included opening remarks by UN Secretary-General Mr. António Guterres. After the panel, Member States and partners were given the opportunity to take the floor for interventions, followed by closing remarks. Partners were strongly encouraged to announce pledges.
