Anonimski (talk)\n\n@Anonimski: The best person to contact about that is . 1989 (talk)\n\nI have a strong memory that Commons search engine worked in a slightly different way a few months ago. When I typed something in Search Wikimedia Commons searchbox, let's say Amsterdam, one of suggestions in the drop down list was obviously related to Wikidata, it said something like \"Files depicting Amsterdam (Q727)\", and the search results displayed images that have \"depicts: Q727\" in their structured data.\n\nHas this changed? Is there a way to force this type of search when I need it? I tried to find it today, and failed :) --Tupungato (talk)\n\nHello @Tupungato: in Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets there is an option Wdsearch: When searching on Commons, also include search results from Wikidata which could be activated. --M2k~dewiki (talk)\n\nHi @Tupungato: . Earlier this year, we removed the \"files depicting...\" feature from the search box, since the new search experience uses depicts as a search input. You can read more details in this Village Pump announcement. CBogen (WMF) (talk)\n\nHello, all.\n\nAs you know, the Board election was due to open on August 4th. Due to some technical issues with SecurePoll, the election must be delayed by two weeks. This means we plan to launch the election on August 18th, which is the day after Wikimania concludes.\n\nFor information on the technical issues, you can see the Phabricator ticket here.\n\nYou can also read this announcement in other languages here.\n\nWe are truly sorry for this delay and hope that we will get back on schedule on August 18th. We are in touch with the Elections Committee and the candidates to coordinate next steps. We will update the Board election Talk page and this channel as we know more. Best, Zuz (WMF) (talk)\n\nHello, all.\n\nif you look at these images uploaded to WikiCommens, you will see that all of them have been uploaded to WikiCommens without reference to any credible source. And in most of them, the regions, Armenians, Kurds, Persians, Arabs, as well as other ethnic groups have been introduced as Turkic and Turkic-speaking. ([1] In this map, you can see that the regions that have never been counted as Azerbaijan have been counted as South Azerbaijan, for example, the Kurdish regions of Makrian and Kurdistan province and the Persian regions of Qazvin, Hamedan, Arak, etc.) – ([2] The map explicitly refers to Kurdish, Arab, Persian, Armenian, Georgian, and Talysh regions; The Kurdish and Arab provinces of Erbil, Kirkuk, Diyala, Salahuddin and Ninawa in Iraq, as well as the Persian provinces of Qom, Qazvin and Arak in Iran. In this invalid map, even the whole country of Armenia, which has a history of several thousand years in the region, is considered part of Azerbaijan! This map shows several provinces in Georgia as well as mixed areas in Turkey.) – ([3] In this map of Kurdish areas; Kermanshah, Sanandaj and Makrian, the Talysh regions of Gilan, as well as the Persian regions of Qom, Qazvin, Hamedan, Arak, Karaj and even the capital of Iran «Tehran» are incorrectly except Azerbaijan!) – ([4] This map is also taken from [File:Idioma azerí.png|this map], but with the difference that a person whose account in Persian Wikipedia has been closed due to multiple accounts and violations of Wikipedia rules, has created it and to the Kurdish areas in the west and southwest, areas In the south and east, the Persians have invaded the Armenian regions of Nagorno-Karabakh, as well as parts of Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Georgia, and mentioned it with an Azeri majority!) – ([5] This map also has several errors in the Oghuz languages ​​regarding Turkish and Azeri. The Persian-speaking regions of Iran and the Kurdish regions of Turkey, Iraq and Iran, which I mentioned above, are among these two languages, for example, the city of Erbil in the Kurdistan region and the Kurdish city of Diyarbakir in Turkey, as well as the city of Tehran!) – ([6] The latest map also includes several mistakes in Eurasia!) Now I ask Wikinews administrators to remove incorrect files, such as the ones I mentioned, to prevent duplication between valid and invalid files. You may say that these areas may be among the disputed areas between Turks and other ethnic groups, but are Tehran, Yerevan and Erbil also among these areas? Thank you very much. Ahrir (talk)\n\n@Ahrir: You can tag any or all of these with {{Fact disputed}} and an explanation of your issue. However, Commons does not generally try to adjudicate disputes of fact when maps conflict. We leave it up to the various Wikipedias to decide which map to use. Not infrequently, Wikipedias in different languages draw different conclusions. It is not Commons' place to tell them which is right and wrong. Again: {{Fact disputed}} lets you raise the issues you've raised here in a more relevant place. - Jmabel ! talk\n\n@Ahrir: , Coincidentally I just launched a proposal to address the problems you mentioned to inform users of files with factual disputes. The problem is that unless someone there clicks on an image and specifically open the image's pages they won't see disputes. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nI found this website about Louis Renault that contains a wealth of images related to him personally and the early years of the automotive company Renault. As I am already working on a lot of projects I can't adopt this one either, so anyone interested can import from this website, preferably categorise these files at \"Category:Files from Louisrenault.com\". --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nHi all\n\nIs anyone aware of a bot or other automated way I could request to upload around 300 images from Flickr the copyright holder wants to share on Commons but doesn't want to change the license on Flickr for? They want to share under CC BY-SA 4.0 which Flickr doesn't offer so I can't use Flickr2Commons.\n\nThanks\n\nJohn Cummings (talk)\n\n@John Cummings: I take it that the current Flickr license is not an allowable one for Flickr2Commons? Because if they can come through Flickr2Commons, we can easily change the license with VFC once they are on Commons. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nThanks Jmabel yes its not an allowable one. Also the issue is that its just a list of URLs not a specific collection or their whole photo stream so using Flickr2Commons won't work very well. John Cummings (talk)\n\nIf the Flickr user puts the files they want to donate in a Flickr album, this avoids the weirdness of listing URLs and the album can be uploaded as a block. I have a generic 'upload by album' script which can bypass everything else, and tweaking to change the license would be trivial. As 300 files is small, I'd rather not have to invest programming time in any significant customization beyond that. --Fæ (talk)\n\nHi Fæ (talk · contribs), thanks so much, so I just need to ask them to put it in an album and tell you the album? Would it be possible for your software to use my favourites list as an album so the Flickr guy at the organisation doesn't have to press 320 x 5 buttons? John Cummings (talk)\n\nIf they let others tag their photos, it would be easier to filter by a specific flickrtag, like \"wikimediacommons\", as detecting these is already in the code. You tagging their photos would be almost as easy, plus they can add more later using that system. --Fæ (talk)\n\nThanks Fæ :) Currently they don't allow this but I can ask, one other idea, can you use a gallery e.g this as a way to scoop them all up? This would mean I would only need to do 600 clicks which is pretty easy to churn through. John Cummings (talk)\n\np.s Fæ, Multichill has pointed out flickrripper.py, I'm not sure if this is what you already use or not. John Cummings (talk)\n\nI currently use flickrapi directly which is very stable for python and itself is something I've moved to during migrating stuff to python3. I tried flickrripper a few years ago and it created more problems than seemed worth working around or debugging.\n\nIf I do something new, like set up pulling from a gallery list, I may as well be pulling from somewhere else. What form is your list of 'urls' in? If it can be read as the list of flickr photoIDs then pulling it in may be the same amount of work. Again this is a small upload, so it's best that the way it happens is something I might reuse for something else. --Fæ (talk)\n\nHi Fæ the urls are just plain links to Flickr images e.g [7]https://www.flickr.com/photos/wipo/50583189738/. I didn't realise it would be additional work if it was in gallery or a list, so I can just do it by hand. Thanks very much for the explanation. John Cummings (talk)\n\nin cantonese the date should be yyyy年m月d號, but current display is d m月 yyyy. how to correct this?--RZuo (talk)\n\nRZuo, the best place to discuss this is at Template talk:Date and perhaps Jarekt can help you with this problem. --AFBorchert (talk)\n\nRZuo I added \"yue\" language to Data:DateI18n.tab where this information is kept. Below are various outputs for different cases. Are they correct?\n\n{{Date |year=2021 |month=9 |day=8 |hour=11 |minute=27 |second=15 |lang=yue }} → 2021年9月8號, 11:27:15\n\n{{Date |year=2021 |month=9 |day=8 |lang=yue }} → 2021年9月8號\n\n{{Date |year=2021 |month=9 |lang=yue }} → 2021年9月\n\n{{Date |year=2021 |lang=yue }} → 2021年\n\n{{Date |month=9 |day=8 |lang=yue }} → 9月8號\n\n{{Date |month=9 |lang=yue }} → 9月\n\n--Jarekt (talk)\n\nthank you! your edits to Data:DateI18n.tab are good. we indeed prefer 號 over 日 for dates. RZuo (talk)\n\nI feel it's my duty to add 18+ warnings to links to sites with significant adult content whenever I post on the Internet. I do not want to potentially harm children. Back then, I didn't realize CWCiki is an adults-only site due to how much NSFW content there is (there's supposed to be a warning, but it may not be reliably placed). PrincessPandaWiki (talk)\n\nI don't understand why you would want to add a \"18+\" warning to that particular page. The image has already deleted (and showed no adult content when it was here). -- Infrogmation of New Orleans (talk)\n\n@Infrogmation: I meant the URL. (I also fixed your indention. Also, put {{reply to|(insert username of user you're replying to here)}} and a space in front of your message whenever you reply to someone so that you can notify them.) PrincessPandaWiki (talk)\n\n@PrincessPandaWiki: the link leads to a completely innocuous page. Are you saying we need a warning because of content elsewhere on the site? Would you make a warning every time we link to Flickr? Or to ourselves? Or am I missing something? - Jmabel ! talk\n\n@Jmabel: I don't attach warnings to mainstream sites such as Flickr or Twitter because that would be silly. CWCiki is a more niche site, along the lines of Encyclopedia Dramatica. (In fact, CWCiki spun off Encyclopedia Dramatica's article on Christine Weston Chandler.) PrincessPandaWiki (talk)\n\n@PrincessPandaWiki: Given that it would be a remark on your own comment, I see no problem with you adding a warning. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nHi all\n\nI'm working with an organisation who have agreed to release a lot of graphs to Commons, however they only have them inside a 100+ page pdf. Does anyone know of a program that can easily (ie no command line stuff) allow someone to batch export pages from a pdf as individual svgs?\n\nThanks\n\nJohn Cummings (talk)\n\nWell, I would consider command line usage the most easiest form to do this. For example, pdf2svg could be helpful. --AFBorchert (talk)\n\nThanks AFBorchert I tried this today but I just can't get it to run, I think I just don't understand enough command line stuff to be able to use the instructions, e.g 'Do the normal ./configure && make && make install', I have no idea what this means.... John Cummings (talk)\n\n(Edit conflict) Which platform are you using and what exactly went wrong? Any error messages? --AFBorchert (talk)\n\nYou should not try to compile it using \"./configure\" etc. Just install the binaries. I can help you here, provided you could identify your platform. --AFBorchert (talk)\n\nThanks AFBorchert, Windows 10, it looks like there is no stable version for Windows anyway. Do you know of anything else I could try that isn't command line? John Cummings (talk)\n\nJohn Cummings, did you try pdf2svg-windows which is already precompiled? I'm afraid I am not of any help if you insist on leaving the command line. And I have absolutely no experience with Windows 10. I just know that a command line exists ;) Good luck! --AFBorchert (talk)\n\nThanks, yes I'm aware of it but the instructions for installing are beyond me, especially 'To cross compile for Windows under Linux, simply install the relevant cross-compiler packages (for Fedora this is mingw32-cairo and mingw32-poppler and their dependencies) and then replace “./configure” in the compilation instructions above with “mingw32-configure” or “mingw64-configure”.' John Cummings (talk)\n\nJohn Cummings, you do not need to recompile this package, just download the binaries and you are done. The instructions you quote are directed to those who are interested in reproducing these binaries. You have two options for downloading:\n\n* Use \"git clone https://github.com/jalios/pdf2svg-windows.git\" on the command line (if you happen to have git).\n\n* Or download https://github.com/jalios/pdf2svg-windows/archive/refs/heads/master.zip into some directory and unpack it using unzip.\n\nThen you will find the subdirectories dist-32bits and dist-64bits for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, respectively. Within these subdirectories are the shared libraries and the pdf2svg.exe executable which can be invoked from the command line as described. Good luck! --AFBorchert (talk)\n\n@AFBorchert: , thanks very much for your help. I managed to install Ubuntu on an old laptop and install pdf2svg, I have one last issue, I don't understand what command I need to do to get it to extract all pages as svgs not just the first page which I get by using 'pdf2svg input.pdf output.svg'. I can't work out what command I need to use to tell is to do all the pages as separate files, any suggestions? The instructions are written as pdf2svg <input.pdf> <output.svg> [<page no of pdf or \"all\">] but I simply can't find a version of this command that actually works. I'll improve the instructions on Commons so it can help others and remind me for next time. Thanks again, John Cummings (talk)\n\nJohn Cummings, I am glad that you managed to install Ubuntu. This makes everything much easier! You can solve your problem using following command line: “pdf2svg input.pdf output-%02d.svg all”. The selector “all” causes all pages to be converted and the pattern “%02d” will be replaced by the respective page numbers. Hence, you will get then output files named output-00.svg, output-01.svg etc. BTW, Ubuntu (and other Unix-like systems) have manual pages. Using “man pdf2svg” will deliver you a manpage with a description on how to use this utility. I hope this helps. Best wishes, AFBorchert (talk)\n\nThanks very much AFBorchert, it works great, I've added the command to the instructions here. John Cummings (talk)\n\nWe seem to be building up a backlog at Category:Flickr review needed. Does anyone know whether some bot has stopped? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nI think it's mainly the result of recent mass uploading via Flickr2Commons. User:FlickreviewR 2 bot seems to be working okay, but it gets swamped just like a human.

File:Tratactus Induciarum Cessationis omnis hostilitatis actus, ut Navigations ac Commercipariterque succurssus factus, initus conclusus Hagae Comitis die duodecimâ Iunij 1641.pdf. My Latin is not up to it!--Headlock0225 (talk)\n\nIt appears to be a 1641 peace treaty to enable commercial trade, or trade agreements, negotiated in the Hague. The filename needs fixing to be better Latin than a literal transcription. --Fæ (talk)\n\nIt is apparently en:Treaty of The Hague (1641). I am not familiar with categorization of ancient treaties, but Category:Treaties with Portugal as a party and Category:Treaties with the Netherlands as a party (or some subcategories that probably do not exist yet) as well as Category:Events in The Hague (or some subcategory) could be good. A an appropriate subcategory of Category:Treaties by year for 1641 might be good as well. --Robert Flogaus-Faust (talk)\n\nThank you, Fæ and Robert Flogaus-Faust. I am not going to attempt a correct Latin file name though! \"Treaty of The Hague (1641)\" will do just fine.--Headlock0225 (talk)\n\nI've just created {{PD-old-architecture}}, meant for images of buildings from countries with no suitable freedom of panorama but are now in public domain. This relies on {{PD-old-auto}}, while the lower part is based on {{PD-US-architecture}} (as said by some users, for US compliance). Files tagged with this will be categorized under Category:PD old architecture, not to mention the already-existing categories used by PD-old-auto. This is what has transpired from both Commons:Village pump/Copyright/Archive/2021/03#PD-US-architecture for Icelandic buildings? and Commons:Village pump/Copyright/Archive/2021/05#Proposal for a PD-architecture tag or similar. Because in reality I believe {{PD-US-architecture}} and the accompanying Category:PD US architecture must be confined only to images of pre-December 1990 US buildings themselves (like those of Empire State Building, Willis Tower, or U.S. Bank Tower); it may just cause some confusion because images of buildings from no FOP countries are tagged by a template that is supposed to be exclusive for US buildings only (as indicated at COM:FOP US).\n\nIf the template I created needs fixes and other refinements, feel free to do so. Besides I will not use this for a while until several users say so.\n\nPing the two participants from the March 2021 discussion, @Brainulator9 and Ymblanter: . JWilz12345 (Talk|Contrib's.)\n\nThanks, seems useful. There was indeed a lot of confusion about the point.--Ymblanter (talk)\n\n@Ymblanter: I made a correction to the documentation, as I actually used the whole {{PD-old-auto}} as the main body of the template. JWilz12345 (Talk|Contrib's.)\n\n@JWilz12345: That's good idea. One more suggestion. What about Template:PD-ineligible-architecture, which can be used in copyright-free buildings due to its simple structure? This too is for countries that do not have freedom of panorama. Ox1997cow (talk)\n\n@Ox1997cow: that is highly impractical in my opinion. Threshold of originality varies country by country, even to countries with no freedom of panorama. In some no FOP jurisdictions like France, the courts have already set the TOO standards in their rulings. I don't see the need for a PD-ineligible tag for tangible architecture as of this moment. Unlike this PD template, which is both flexible (as I used the PD-old-auto as its main body) and compatible with the copyright durations as stated in the copyright laws of the countries. JWilz12345 (Talk|Contrib's.)\n\n@JWilz12345: Oh, I see. How about {{PD-old-sculpture}}? It's used for sculptures whose author died a long time ago. Ox1997cow (talk)\n\n@Ox1997cow: not possible to create PD-old-sculpture. For one thing it is highly impractical and wastes time of users and admins to tag such. And another thing, sculptures are copyrightable works in the United States. Perhaps you might be familiar with the infamous 2012 takedown notice by the camp of sculptor Oldenburg which led to mass deletions of nearly all images of his sculptures here during that year (as such we rarely see pre-2013 images of his works). Even works in countries with suitable FOP provisions (e.g. Germany, Israel, and Spain) were nuked too! The takedown notice is found here, which led to a discussion at Commons:Requests for comment/non-US Freedom of Panorama under US copyright law. That discussion concluded with the creation of {{Not-free-US-FOP}}, which is supposedly for all images of all protected works of sculptures, murals, and other non-architectural works from countries with freedom of panorama. This means sculptures of \"no-FOP countries\" that are in public domain in their physical jurisdictions may not be allowed here as they may be unfree in the United States (and U.S. courts are known to apply the doctrine of w:lex loci protectionis by applying US law over international works of art). Further complicating matters is the so-called American copyright restorations through the Uruguay Round Agreements Act or URAA. As sculptures are not works of architecture (architectural works are not applicable for URAA), these are all at mercy of copyright extensions, which vary depending on what period these were created (a guide for the copyright extensions is found here. JWilz12345 (Talk|Contrib's.)\n\nThank you for this. As an aside, it might be best to redo the template so both messages are part of the same template, much like {{PD-old-auto-expired}}. -BRAINULATOR9 (TALK)\n\n@Brainulator9: that seems to technical for me hehe. I don't know who are the template editors here and if they are active here in VP or not. JWilz12345 (Talk|Contrib's.)\n\nYeah, I'd probably be the one to try to pull that off. -BRAINULATOR9 (TALK)\n\nInfo I have replaced all instances of {{PD-old-auto}}+{{PD-US-architecture}} tagged in recently restored files of non-US buildings with {{PD-old-architecture}} (thereby the files are now categorized at Category:PD old architecture). JWilz12345 (Talk|Contrib's.)\n\nRecently I requested file renaming for the three last entries of this list upon COM:FR-4 \"To harmonize the names of a set of images so that only one part of all names differs\"\n\nIngenuity flight 4 real-time animation.gif\n\nIngenuity flight 5 real-time animation.gif\n\nIngenuity flight 6 real-time animation (39 seconds).gif\n\nIngenuity flight 7 real-time animation (48 seconds).gif\n\nIngenuity flight 8 real-time animation (75 seconds).gif\n\nIngenuity flight 9 full real-time animation.gif\n\nIngenuity flight 10 full real-time animation.gif\n\nFile:PIA24644-MarsIngenuityHelicopter-ThirdTestFlight-Animated-20210425.gif\n\n→ Ingenuity flight 3 real-time animation.gif\n\nFile:Black-and-White View of Ingenuity's Fourth Flight.gif\n\n→ Ingenuity flight 4 animation (vertical).gif\n\nFile:Ingenuity flight six navcam imagery showing last 29 seconds in flight along with navigation anomaly.gif\n\n→ Ingenuity flight 6 real-time animation (29 seconds).gif\n\nHowever, TommyG declined all these requests on the grounds that they allegedly \"do not comply with renaming guidelines\" — cf. diffs 1, 2 and 3.\n\nI insist that at this point honorable TommyG misinterpreted the regulations of COM:FR-4. On the contrary, as clearly follows from the abovepresented list, the present names of last three files fall out from the general naming convention for this set of animated gifs (\"Ingenuity flight ## [animation type] | optional duration | optional frame rotation\").\n\nI also insist that honorable TommyG incorrectly perceived the presence of a prefix 'PIA-00000' as an attribute of some general scheme, which is broken with my local naming convention.\n\nI also must draw attention to the inner contradiction of his motive for declining my request, as he wrote in his comments. On the one hand he insists that\n\nMaking all files in a category have similar names isn't a goal on Commons\n\nBut on another hand he requires to keep the naming convention in another category thus calling for similarity of names in another category.\n\nThat would make it disharmonizaed with files in Category:Ingenuity flight 3.\n\nFot that matter I propose to browse the category which has been suggested as a template to be followed and was used as the reasin for declining my file rename request:\n\nCategory:Ingenuity flight 3\n\n1-PIA24624-MarsPerseveranceRoverViewsIngenuityHelicopter-ThirdFlight-20210425.png\n\nBlack and White Image From Ingenuity's Third Flight.jpg\n\nIngenuity's Third Flight photo in color with Perseverance rover visible.png\n\nJPL-20210425 Perseverance Rover's Mastcam-Z Captures Ingenuity's Third Flight.webm\n\nPerseverance Rover's Mastcam-Z Captures Ingenuity's Third Flight.webm\n\nPerseverance's NavCams Views Ingenuity During its Third Flight.jpg\n\nPIA24625-MarsIngenuityHelicopterViewsPerseveranceRoverFromAir-20210425.jpg\n\nPIA24625-MarsIngenuityHelicopterViewsPerseveranceRoverFromAir-20210425a.jpg\n\nPIA24625-MarsIngenuityHelicopterViewsPerseveranceRoverFromAir-20210425b.jpg\n\nPIA24644-MarsIngenuityHelicopter-ThirdTestFlight-20210425.jpg\n\nPIA24644-MarsIngenuityHelicopter-ThirdTestFlight-Animated-20210425.gif\n\nZoomed in, Perseverance rover from Ingenuity during it's third flight.png\n\nPlease note that prefix 'PIA-…' in this list just creates an appearance of consistency. Entries 7 through 9 and 10-11 are the duplicates of the same 'PIA-…'; thus actually we have 3 'PIA-named' files against twice more, six files named upon absolutely different pattern. Thereon I find the refusal to rename files not duly motivated.\n\nAt this point let me shed some light on certain details that are likely unknown to most of my colleagues here who did not have the chance to upload from NASA. Prefix PIA is the catalogue identificator used by NASA for a certain part of its public image archives, but by no means for every image displayed at the 'nasa.gov' domain. For this reason you may see that the swingeing majority of images uploaded upon PD-NASA terms do not have this prefix. As for the category where my files reside (being simultaneously defined also in another categories), prefix 'PIA' cannot appear there 'by definition', since all these files are animations. Thus it's a mistake to treat my desire as the only wish the similar names in one category. Here's a reverse causation.\n\nReason: no other files but animations may appear in Category:Ingenuity flight animations\n\nResult: all file names in this category shall look similar being named under the same schema.\n\nOn the basis of the above I consider myself entitled to renew the request for renaming as being improperly declined, and to ask the honorable file movers to satisfy my application for renaming upon the same COM:FR-4 \"To harmonize the names of a set of images so that only one part of all names differs\".\n\nFile:PIA24644-MarsIngenuityHelicopter-ThirdTestFlight-Animated-20210425.gif\n\n→ Ingenuity flight 3 real-time animation.gif\n\nFile:Black-and-White View of Ingenuity's Fourth Flight.gif\n\n→ Ingenuity flight 4 animation (vertical).gif\n\nFile:Ingenuity flight six navcam imagery showing last 29 seconds in flight along with navigation anomaly.gif\n\n→ Ingenuity flight 6 real-time animation (29 seconds).gif\n\nI keepg the same respect to the honorable TommyG and perceive his refusal only as a misunderstanding caused by haste in making a decision and hope for continued fruitful cooperation here.\n\nP.S. Shall I renew the renaming templates in these three files myself, or it would be enough for file movers to revert them in these diffs: 1, 2 and 3?\n\n— Cherurbino (talk)\n\nUPD: I renewed the renaming request under the same COM:FR-4 (name harmonization) with an improved clear reasoning: by template \"Ingenuity flight ## [animation type] • [optional duration] • [optional frame rotation]\" already used for naming 7 identical animated gifs. Cherurbino (talk)\n\nHi, please have a look at COM:FNC#cite_note-4 which elaborates a bit further on what criterion 4 should and shouldn't be used for. My edit comments wasn't meant as mutually exclusive, but rather that both those are reasons not to rename the files. We don't rename files just to make the filenames look good in a category listing. If you want them to be in a certain order in the category, you can use defaultsort. As for the PIA prefix, my experience is that these sort of seemingly random sequence of numbers and letters, is actually some sort of identifier which helps map the images to their source. It's desired to retain this in the name, f.ex to make it easier to check for duplicates when doing bulk uploads of files. However, if some other filemovers feel I'm interpreting the rules too strictly, they are of course free to overrule my judgement and move the files. TommyG (talk)\n\nRe: We don't rename files just to make the filenames look good in a category listing - please do not assign me the motives I did not have in mind. It's you who speaks on my behalf that I allegedly wanted \"the filenames look good\" while my motives were based upon the reasons I explain above.\n\nAs for the PIA prefix… my experience is that these sort of seemingly random sequence of numbers and letters — your exerience with the NASA storages, if any, is wrong. It's not the \"random sequence\". Strange to hear that from a person, who works with German archives with their Bd/Bild identifiers. But, if not 'PIA', then what pattern made you think that the name I insist upon shall conflict with what you saw as the \"naming tradition\" in Category \"flight 3\"? Did you think that PIA is a sort of user-assigned index which I am obliged to follow? Alas, it's impossible. NASA shall be against faked PIA’s\n\nRe: If you want them to be in a certain order in the category, you can use defaultsort — do not think on behalf of another users. I swear, I do not need to sort them, can you beleive? In en-wiki I have more serious principles. Those who have experience in compiling and rearranging image galleries and \"'multiple image'\" templates shall understand me - because en-wiki is a place which needs clear file naming principles and harmonization more than any other national wiki in the world. I kindly invite you to visit Ingenuity (helicopter) to understand what I mean.\n\nI sincerely hope for your understanding my motives for file name harnonization - at least, considering these three files. - Sincerely, Cherurbino (talk)\n\nYour last point would probably be something which would have been a good idea to reference in your justification for moving the files, since this is in fact one of the specific reasons for moving files under criterion 4. However, you did not. At this stage it seems like you have a problem with me and how I perform the filemover task, so I think I'll step back and let some other filemover review whether there is cause for moving these files or not. TommyG (talk)\n\nThank you for your kind understanding. We shall wait for another opinions, and until they appear I dared to renew my application under an improved motivation formula: by template \"Ingenuity flight ## [animation type] • [optional duration] • [optional frame rotation]\" already used for naming 7 identical animated gifs\n\nBest regards and looking forward to the continualion of our cooperation. — Cherurbino (talk)\n\nI was invited by Cherurbino to add my comment. I read the guideline and my understanding is that he refers to Which files should be renamed? #4 that proposes to harmonize the names of a set of images. The argument of ThommyG was #1 from the opposite list Files should NOT be renamed only because the new name looks a bit better. Since the change is much bigger than the example there this is not convincing to me.\n\nBut I doubt also that all files of a category should follow a certain naming template that even new uploads should follow. I would consider a set of images a very small number and tightly connected images e.g. uploaded at once.\n\nThe PIA prefix is just a leftover from the upload when the person did not choose a completely new file name. So I would prefer to have this removed.\n\nTo sum up, I support the suggestion with some doubts about future uploads.--Schrauber5 (talk)\n\nThank you for coming, Shrauber, I know you as one of the most active \"ameliorators\" of articles about space missions with new data and especially with the new images from NASA. You know the job from the point of view of the article editor. You know what a headache is to logically rearrange the gallery from the files named in disorder. For us, editors, harmonizing file names at Commons is not an end in itself but a prerequisite of quality of the whole work under the improvement of articles.\n\nAs for 'PIA-…' prefixes, I would certainly support your doubts about their necessity in the file names. Selecting illustrations for the articles we focus only on visual content, and not at indexes. However, the present version of COM:FR-4 forces the usage of them — if I correctly understand the words \"If possible, language and schema should be preserved, as well as the camera or catalogue number\", so in some cases I am forced to stick with this requirement.

Justlettersandnumbers (talk)\n\nKeep trying with the tutorials on \"coherent noise\". You need to install a couple of plugins, but then the process per image is easy. The Gimp tutorial is pretty clear.\n\nThe point with Moiré noise is that it has this regular-spaced appearance to it. This means that a tool that's sensitive to that repetition (i.e. something based on Fourier) will have a much better noise reduction effect, with less general blurring. It's worth learning this, as a trick for cleaning up old scans, especially if you're working with newspaper or halftone images. Andy Dingley (talk)\n\nI'll second Andy's comments.\n\nUnsharp masking should not be used because it would increase the moiré pattern noise. The purpose of unsharp masking is to sharpen an image, and that sharpening would make the halftone dots stand out more.\n\nBlurring the image will tend to merge the halftone dots and reduce the moiré pattern. However, it also blurs everything else in the image. It essentially defocuses the image.\n\nGlrx (talk)\n\nI added information to Template:Fonds Raoul Berthelé - Archives municipales de Toulouse/en and Template:Fonds Raoul Berthelé - Archives municipales de Toulouse/fr\n\nI need to get a cs translator for Template:Fonds Raoul Berthelé - Archives municipales de Toulouse/cs.

User:SteveMajerus, on what basis were you in a position to grant a license to use this image? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nProbably as editor-in-chief of the publication, assuming that his issuance of the license attributing personally to himself the entire contents shown in the image is conform to the facts, to the policies of the publication and to the legal contracts with the publishing company, which is something that VRT member Krd apparently accepted as all satisfactorily proven. According to the log, the reduction in size was made by the original uploader himself minutes after his original upload. Maybe he wanted to license only the small version and forgot to request the deletion of the larger version, or maybe he thought that uploading a small file was necessary to display a small image in the Wikipedia article. It would be useful if he clarified what he was doing, if it's not already specified in the VRT communication. -- Asclepias (talk)\n\nWhy is there any reason to reduce it in the first place? It's the cover of a publication with extrenely simple design: titles as text, and graphic design way below COM:TOO. Just what is even protectable here?

Comparing the timestamps in the article history and in the file log, it can be seen that, after several attempts, he managed to display the image in the infobox of the article. And, a few minutes later, he uploaded the reduced versions, possibly thinking that would adjust the size of the display in the infobox. Since he claims a copyright, his evaluation of the the copyrightability of works in Belgian law would apparently differ from your evaluation. -- Asclepias (talk)\n\nSorry, I'd missed the VRT ticket.

For example, it is not allowed to upload currencies issued after 1970 in Australia and 30 years in Iran. Ox1997cow (talk)\n\n@Ox1997cow: I see. Still, this does not align with your template, does it?

That being said, its possible to transpile the code to ES5 and load it using traditional methods, but I see little benefit in doing it at this stage.

And as of today this batch DR relating to images of Burj Khalifa has reached more than 20 threads (with hundreds of images within each). Just in case someone will refer me to an old discussion at COM:FOP talk page, I already read that and just only reaffirmed the lack of FOP status. To date the only provision there states that works are only allowed to be depicted through broadcasting media (which I think only encompasses television-related media). De minimis may be one thing, but it is not relevant to my questiom that follows.\n\nMy only question is, are there any attempts by Arab Wikipedians and Wikipedians based in that desert kingdom to have FOP introduced there, at the very least architecture-only FOP? (Similar to countries like U.S. and Russia.) So as to finally allow images of two famous icons of Dubai (Burj's Khalifa and al-Arab) here on Commons and restore thousands that were deleted from 2010 up to now. JWilz12345 (Talk|Contrib's.)\n\nI doubt that the UAE, ranked the 145th most democratic country by the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2020, would be responsive to a grassroots movement to change the nation's copyright law.

I had based my statement that the car is owned by \"Jack and Gail Burk\" on what it said in the sign at the lower left of File:Louie Louie custom car 01.jpg. The recent edit removes \"and Gail\". If this were from a registered user, of course I'd ask what's going on. Coming from an IP, maybe it's random vandalism, maybe it's pointed vandalism, maybe the sign was wrong, maybe Jack and Gail are now divorced, or she died, or she no longer wants anything to do with the car. What the heck do you do with something like this? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nundo and add \"according to the sign shown in one of the photos, it was owned at xxxx.xx.xx by xxxx and xxxx\" (Edit comment: \"please provide a reference for changed ownership\") --C.Suthorn (talk)\n\n@C.Suthorn: Good idea. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Jmabel ! talk\n\nFile:En-us-especial.ogg has incorrect pronunciation.

The author Neskaya claims to come from Southern California so maybe it is pronounced like that where she comes from? De728631 (talk)\n\n@De728631: This person is giving a slightly anglicized version of the Spanish word, rather than an English-language pronunciation of the English word. This probably should be renamed as \"es-us...\" and a new en-us one recorded. - Jmabel ! talk\n\n@Jmabel: I was thinking that too. It does have a heavy Spanish accent. De728631 (talk)\n\nThis system is broken; we should not have magic names at Commons like this. As for the word, the actual US English pronunciation is as likely to be as a Spanish loan word instead of pronounced as a historically English word. And again, this is not and should not be a Commons issue; Wiktionary and Commons should be disentangled here.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nI have noticed that for many plant species, the gallery page is not in the category of the species, but of the genus.\n\nExample: The page Renanthera monachica is in Category:Renanthera, but not in Category:Renanthera monachica.\n\nIs this on purpose?\n\nBy the logic on described on Commons:Galleries, gallery pages should be in their corresponding category, which in the case of plant species would be the category of the plant species, correct?\n\nThe one species gallery given as an example on Commons:Galleries (Lama glama) is in the corresponding species category (Category:Lama glama). I'm not sure if that's because it's an animal rather than a plant.\n\nI'm now wondering if there's a logic to this, or if many plant species categories should be moved.\n\nCheers–Jérôme (talk)\n\nEdit: As additional info, let me add how I came across this: I'm searching for the name of plant species on Commons a lot, which leads to the gallery page. Then, if I'd like to see more images of the species, I'm looking for a link to the species gallery, but there is no such link, although in the cases I've tested a category always existed. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Jérôme (talk • contribs)\n\nSpecies galleries are often considered sister pages to the species categories.

So, Category:Office equipment should be alright. De728631 (talk)\n\nRZuo has just created Letter trays. I think I’ve also called them paper trays, stacking trays, and sorting trays at one time or another.—Odysseus1479 (talk)\n\nI've used them a lot, but very seldom for letters. Usually they are made so that they can be stacked, but not always (some are made to be hanged from a vertical pole so that they can be rotated, somebody found that very clever back in the 70s, I didn't like that). They are for sorting, and mostly used with papers (but not always). I'm surprised we just have one example in Commons. I'll try to improve that. B25es (talk)\n\n@Jmabel, De728631, RZuo, Odysseus1479, and B25es: Staples still sells two of these monolithic beasts, but only painted black (the picture is probably of one with light-colored paint, ivory or white). They call each a \"Side Loading Letter Tray, Black Steel\" on-page or \"Metal 5-Tier Letter Size Horizontal Organizer\" in-URL and \"\"5-Compartment Steel File Organizer, Black\" on-page or \"5-compartment steel file organizer black\" in-URL. I have had to deal with some (and their equivalents at the ends of collating copiers & printers), and they are very efficient at collecting dust. Staples also sell versions with more compartments. Modern versions are more modular, and the better ones can be stacked to save space in storage. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nAre the ones where the separators are vertical instead of horizontal still \"letter trays\" or is there a different term? - Jmabel ! talk\n\nDo you have an example of vertical separators? De728631 (talk)\n\nE.g. this would not be a tray. Staples calls it a \"sorter\" and I would agree that a tray is something on a horizontal level. De728631 (talk)\n\nI have one about 2-1/2 feet from me as I write that is sort of like the one in the picture I started this with, but turned on its side. A bit heavier-duty than De728631'a example.

I know Commons is much better at detecting copyright violations nowadays, but having missing pictures of the day makes us look bad.\n\nWould it be a crazy idea to retroactively nominate new PotDs to replace the deleted ones? Ixfd64 (talk)\n\n@Ixfd64: Yes, it would be. Recently I had an argument on Wikipedia about whether it’s a good idea to hide revisions with serious vandalism but nothing legally unacceptable (no copyvio, no personal data etc.). I argued it’s not a good idea: vandalism belongs to Wikipedia’s history, don’t try to do as if it wasn’t vandalized regularly. Similarly, copyvio images belong to Commons’ history, don’t try to do as if no copyvios were selected as POTDs ever. —Tacsipacsi (talk)\n\nI was afraid there would be no consensus to replace deleted PotDs. It looks like we'll either have to ask for permission and hope for the best or be really patient and wait for the copyrights to expire.

Anyhow, I would also prefer to see hard evidence of copyright trolling before we take any action over here. De728631 (talk)\n\nWe should have a \"{{Copyright troll}}\" template, these are free educational images, while their licenses are free the re-users often make a small mistake and it's the author(s) that act in bad faith.

There is a photographer, who uploads them photos at flickr with a cc-license. These photos have been imported to commons by Magnus-Manske's bot and other commons users and the flickr-license has been translated by these commons users to cc-2.5. The photographer does not have a MW account, them might not know of the existence of commons, maybe them is not even aware of a website by the name of wikipedia, but them now gets called out for trolling at commons?? If them has actually done something wrong, that would be needed addressed at flickr? --C.Suthorn (talk)\n\n@C.Suthorn: As I read it, the trolling does not appear directly at Commons but offline in the form of compensation claims when re-users of photographs by this person fail to follow all their complicated attribution details to the letter. On another note, CC 2.5 seems like nonsense to me because that is not an original option at Flickr. De728631 (talk)\n\nNot sure if this is an overkill, but perhaps the CC-BY-2.0 template should be amended with a warning that the attribution rules need to be followed carefully? BeŻet (talk)\n\n+1 - Jmabel ! talk\n\nFYI copyright trolling is being discussed in a Wikimania session tomorrow @19:45 UTC see here. --Fæ (talk)\n\nI checked one of his images, at random. It's CC by here, but (now) CC by-nc at Flickr ([9]). It's not the only such example. Is that part of the problem?\n\nAs I thought: user:Alex Pro... user:AlexPro... does not exist. If action has to be taken, it would need to be at Flickr side, or Commons needs to outrule Flickr (because Flickr allows \"changing\" of license, which enables \"copyright trolling\") imports, or cc-2.0 needs to be outruled on commons, or the cc-2.0 template needs to be amended, to describe the difficulty. But without a user Alex Proimos at commons it does not make sense to declare them a troll at commons. Them does not interact with commons. Them photos have been imported to commons by others. --C.Suthorn (talk)\n\nI posted the original comment about this and just to clarify, I should mention I'm not particularly familiar with how Wikimedia Commons works. I reported this here because on two occasions people had said they'd been hit with a demand for over $600 by this photographer because they had linked to an image on Wikimedia Commons instead of his Flickr account. I don't expect Wikimedia Commons to be able to solve this problem entirely - that is indeed something Flickr should do (and they won't because they have a partnership with Pixsy and frankly don't seem to care about people abusing CC licenses, as evidenced by the fact they still allow Marco Verch to use their site). But given these cases were directly linked to the images appearing here on Wikimedia Commons and given that the vast majority of users of this site will be unaware of the potential risk there is in using these images, it is surely at a minimum worth notifying you about this. What you do with it is up to you - like I say, I don't have much understanding of this site or how your policies work, but when your users are at risk of being ripped off over a minor mistake (if it's even a mistake to give an attribution to Wikimedia Commons instead of Flickr) it seems like an obvious problem. Incidentally, we encourage people in our group to avoid CC BY 2.0 images completely for this reason. I personally run a website that runs thousands of articles each year and the idea of getting a $600 fine every time we make a typo is frightening. There are a long list of photographers who do this now but I specifically mentioned Proimos because of the link to Wikimedia Commons.

The first time it was posted, it was archived without an answer from an administrator. I restored it two times and no one even bother to take care of it. The problem is that the user who is the center of this request has a problematic behavior since at least 2015 (7 years). In all that time, the user only received warnings and nothing was done to prevent his bad behavior after multiple requests on the Administrator's noticeboards.\n\nIs it common for the admins to ignore requests? Is it because they can't take care of cases more complex than simple vandalisms?\n\n--Myloufa (talk)\n\nThat noticeboard is for simple blocks for obvious abuse only. Complex cases should be discussed at COM:AN/U. -- King of ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠\n\nThis came up in a side discussion at Wikimania today. So far as I am aware, we have no process for automatically nominating/ awarding the winning images from Wiki Loves... related competitons, as quality or featured images. Should we?\n\nJudges for most of the photo competitions aren't looking for the same things QIC/FPC are, necessarily. There are often some good candidates, but only a few ever succeed when nominated right away. Often they require some postprocessing adjustments in order to satisfy the technical expectations of the regulars in those spots. Like I was just looking through some of the winners of Wiki Loves Africa. this one is a contender, but people will inevitably say \"too noisy\" and \"right crop\". The former can be fixed, and that may be enough to make it succeed, but if it were automatically nominated, it would almost certainly fail on those grounds, for better or worse. Similarly File:Pupil.jpg has some heavy chromatic aberration. It's fixable, but requires someone to actually fix it.\n\nThe best thing is probably to post the news of the results and maybe a few stand-out examples to Commons talk:Featured picture candidates. — Rhododendrites talk |\n\nI don't like starting this discussion, but it has to be held. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has fallen to the Taliban and on Wikimedia Commons we have multiple pages like \"Template:Afghanistan by year\" that use the flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. As it is now a \"historical country\" and after two (2) decades the Taliban are back in power at what point will we replace the flags of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan with the flag of the Taliban? Perhaps it's when the IR Afghan flag emoji gets replaced with the Taliban flag, perhaps we should use international recognition as a standard but the old Islamic Republic of Afghanistan wasn't recognised either.\n\nAs to many Afghan people the Taliban flag will be received as \"the Nazi flag of Afghanistan\" especially by non-Pashtun Afghans, but the government has changed, so when should we change the flags to reflect this in a neutral way? --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nI suggest we wait until they form a government. And then wait until that government is the de facto recognised government of Afghanistan. Until then, I propose no changes be made. Is there a {{Disputed}} that covers this? Rodhullandemu (talk)\n\nI Support Rodhullandemu's suggestion. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nAgreed. Assuming the regime change ‘sticks’, the state’s official name might be changed, or OTOH the Taliban may keep the existing national insignia to signal their feig^H^H^H^Hnew-found civic principles &c., so moving things around would seem very premature at this point.—Odysseus1479 (talk)\n\nYeah, going over it, Wikipedia doesn't use a flag for Afghanistan at the moment, so it's safe to wait it out and then any changes won't be controversial as they would then be undeniable facts. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nApologies if this has already been posted:\n\nYou can run to be on the Movement Charter drafting committee.

I haven't been able to log in; keep getting \"Sorry, an error occurred while processing your request.\" Is it working okay for you? — Sam Wilson ( Talk • Contribs ) …\n\nIt looks like it was probably the fact that I was including non-alphanumeric characters in my password. Is working now. — Sam Wilson ( Talk • Contribs ) …\n\nCan we thus upload them here? This Poor Man's Guardian advertised there seems not to be in Commons yet. Zezen (talk)\n\nUpdate: It does not work for me. I used to have a Wikipedia (free account), I logged in after some years' break and now I see only\n\nGet unlimited access to the British Newspaper Archive. There are hundreds of millions of incredible stories just waiting to be found. Get your subscription today to start exploring over 300 years of history.\n\nafter the first free page. Sigh. Zezen (talk)\n\nIt says the same for me, but searches come up with lots of hits, and I've not yet found any article that's not accessible. Maybe the message about subscriptions is out of date. — Sam Wilson ( Talk • Contribs ) …\n\nIt looks like the have 230 issues of The Poor Man's Guardian, from the first issue on 9 July 1831. It seems to be possible to download only one page at a time, unfortunately. — Sam Wilson ( Talk • Contribs ) …\n\nReferences\n\n(Revising my viewpoint) Some works are marked as public domain, regardless of the website terms, this should override any other legal claims.\n\nOkay, it should be possible to \"hack\" the website as tiles can be queried directly using links like https://tiles-api.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/API/dz?Q=BL/0000097/18310716/0007&p=m1c8f9qbrpt45686s6lam9itplb26s2sgbnmsengsj0ppa2v1gvrllo19re4r7kov0g53ea9vg6m83ff5q61mne4pitkooou5qohu2o%3D&t=_files/11/2_2.jpg.\n\nThe \"t\" parameter is the tile with <zoom level>/x_y at the end and I presume \"p\" is the session reference that tracks users. You can actually plug the tile reference into Dezoomify and it'll create a PNG for the newspaper page, no programming talent needed. However, you can automate the browser session and download the PDFs, which could be an approach to download thousands of pages in PDF, but with an annoying and unnecessary \"public domain\" watermark. Another presumption is that the \"3 free downloads\" does not count public domain files, though if it does, then directly \"reading\" the (jpeg) tiles would not be counted as downloading anyway, it's part of the display function and if someone writes a dezoomer to recreate the full jpeg originals, these would be easy to upload to Commons and have no watermark.\n\nBizarrely, the \"official\" downloadable PDFs just look like they are generated on the fly from the jpegs and don't even have the OCR text, which exists in the system for their searches to work and the text is displayed in their zoom viewer. That just looks lazy. Someone could probably hack the searchable text, considering that there's a text highlighting function in the viewer. However there MIGHT be a potential claim of copyright over the derived text, even if the creation of it is the product of some off-the-shelf OCR tool. I have no idea why the only downloadable format they offer is PDF, especially considering the originals sitting in the image database are jpegs, again that's lazy.\n\nI'm not volunteering to do any of this at this time. --Fæ (talk)\n\nThe above URL is now returning \"405 Not Allowed\". Given that, and the fact that the BL's blogpost includes the statement \"The fact that we consider newspapers made before 1881 to be in the public domain does not mean that we can make all pre-1881 digitised titles available for free—the BNA is dependent on subscriptions to maintain the considerable effort required to sustain it, and the one million pages per year arrangement [[SIC: read \"limit\"] is intended to protect that model\", I suspect that laziness is not the motivation here.\n\nThe \"p\" parameter will vary by user session, probably, which means it will timeout. This can still be mass uploaded with an automated browser session, or someone might work out how to get around it as the OpenResty instance looks pretty open to me, not that I'm intending to hack it myself. I don't agree that the Findmypast company needs us to pay them £8, or that the British Library's decision to hand over these public domain public records to a private company (DC Thompson Ltd) so their directors can get rich is a \"good thing\". --Fæ (talk)\n\nIf things cost money to produce they need to be paid for. If you're not the product, and there's no advertising... Secretlondon (talk)\n\nI didn't notice that going on the last time I was at the British Library.\n\nDC Thompson Ltd is a commercial publisher, they exist to make a profit, not to provide public services. --Fæ (talk)\n\nWe should adopt the policy of not downloading newspaper archives wholesale, or even in major part I.E. whole daily issue. These collections cost an enormous sum to create, the software required to curate and search them is highly specialized and a lot more sophisticated than what we have to offer. Last but not least it takes a proprietorial organization with substantial funding and systematic patience to create these databases in the first place.\n\nIf we disrupt their funding / fiscal model by plundering them for free, they will not be incentivized to create or maintain them, or add to their collections. Past newspaper archives would be lost forever.\n\nThis is one of the reasons google stopped or limited access to their book project.\n\nCommons should be aware that it cant do it all, plundering museum sites (funded by the public) and auction houses (who do not rely on exhibition of pictures for revenue), is one thing. Copying an entire catalogue of a newspaper collection is quite another and is destructive.\n\nThey already allow (sic) us to to publish individual photos from their collections, and we should be happy with that.\n\nConsidering the huge expense of these curations, they are remarkably cheap for the public to access.\n\nThis exception, to the policy on downloading PD images, needs to be written into our policy, urgently.\n\nThis is the proverbial sleeping dog that should never have been woken up. Broichmore (talk)\n\n@User:Broichmore. I quite agree with you on this! It is important to keep in mind that (our) commons is in the first place a repository for things we use, or might use in the future, on our Wikimedia-projects. It is not a repository of everything that is (more or less) freely available in the world. We don't want to be a group of Robin Hoods, that roam around and plunder what we find on our way. There is still something like an equilibrium of Quality and Quantity. Thanks for your intervention.\n\nApart from that it is very interesting to hear that The British Library has opened the Newspaper Archive for the 19th century. Thank you for that hint, @User:Pigsonthewing. That is exactly what we want and what we need, and that is something we surely can use to enhance the quality of our projects. I'm going to take a look now immediately. --Dick Bos (talk)\n\nOr we can choose to believe that Public Domain is Public Domain and organizations that post-hoc rubber stamp \"non-commercial use only\" over Public Domain media are copyfraudsters and should be called out for it.\n\nI'll just get on with populating Commons with useful educational material like today's Newspapers in Italian while you think of new funny names to call me like \"Robin Hood\" to make me feel and look like a criminal.\n\nThanks for your interest. --Fæ (talk)\n\nI agree with User:Dick Bos that we should be something less than a universal PD host and that we probably should not swallow up all of this material simply because it is legally possible. However, I disagree that our purpose is limited to serving other WMF projects. There are many legitimate educational/academic uses that we support that have nothing to do with WMF. For example, thoroughly documenting the floats in a parade or the speakers at a conference is presumably not going to be useful to any other WMF project, but it might be very useful to an academic researcher with a specific scope and focus. - Jmabel ! talk\n\n\"museum sites (funded by the public)\" As are the British Library.\n\nDefinitions of \"plunder\" at Wiktionary include \"To pillage, take or destroy all the goods of, by force (as in war)...\" and \"To take by force or wrongfully; to commit robbery or looting, to raid.\" Robin Hood famously \"stole from the rich\". The use of such terms in this context is an egregious failure to assume good faith. No-one is \"plundering\" or \"stealing\" PD content from the BNA. By definition, PD content cannot be stolen by downloading it, it already belongs to us all. debating what content is suitable for Commons is legitimate. Impugning the legitimate actions and motivations of others is not.\n\nPinging @Broichmore, Dick Bos re plundering. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nSorry for using the wrong words. Please don't take it to literally. Of course I don't want to suggest that certain things are not done or said in good faith. Perhaps my intention was clear? Don't put everything on commons, especially if it does not have enough metadata to make it useful. Quantity and quality. Better try to put less things on commons, but with good background data. I can give you many examples of having a lot of work to arrange all double or triple images etc. on commons, without good categories etc. I regularly find cases that someone puts a lot of things on commons, and leaves it to others to order it. I don't believe that's what we want. But perhaps I'm wrong. Apart from that I did not call anyone a Robin Hood, but I said that we don't want to be Robin Hoods. As far as I'm concerned, we can finish this conversation --Dick Bos (talk)\n\nYes, I used the wrong word. What is the right word?\n\nI think we all understood exactly what I meant.\n\nRobin Hood was not a thief or even criminal, he returned to the pheasants what was wrongfully taken from them, by a corrupt regime acting falsely in the name of and against the wishes of its legal king. A regime so heinous it led to Magna Carta. Calling someone a Robin Hood is in fact a compliment.\n\nRegarding some of the points mentioned here. The British Library brought D.C. Thompson into the project, because the biggest \"useful\" library in the world did not have the funding, resources, or expertise for this massive project. Had they not done it, or had there been no fiscal interest in creating such archives, they would not exist. The entire past newspaper history of the world would either be in landfill, or on a dusty shelf awaiting the same fate as the en:Library of Alexandria.\n\nThe BL decided that they were going to create a fully accessible, properly curated archive of PD or soon to be PD materiel. They succeeded. It took a fiscal model to do it.\n\nThe commons model could not have done it, it would tiny, never complete in any part, missing huge chunks, quality would be uneven, and difficult to search. Not even as good as some of the immense government collections, publicly funded at great expense, which are so big, with so few librarians, that they are impossible to index. commons helps there. Broichmore (talk)\n\nSpeaking of the wrong word, \"pheasants\" => \"peasants\" (\"faisans\" vs. \"paysans\"). - Jmabel ! talk\n\nThe newspaper upload launched after this thread was started is now at over 14,000 public domain by age newspapers, that's how I invest my time while joining Wikimania sessions on the side. BTW, Robin Hood was a murderer and a thief (reference), don't gaslight our volunteers in this entirely unnecessary way and then tell them off for not thanking you for the \"compliment\".\n\nAre you still arguing that I should stop this volunteer effort to create Commons educational content, and deserve to be criticized for spending my unpaid volunteer time doing it, or not? --Fæ (talk)\n\nI never put forward any argument against your downloading a mirror copy of a part of the Internet archive website.\n\nFrom looking at a small part of it I can see that, google has no entry to it as it has not benefited from any OCR work. The Internet Archive probably got the files from tessmannDigital where there has been some OCR work done. Just looking at these websites is enough to be profoundly impressed with the British Library initiative. The Germans and Italians are catching up, but as you'd expect there is no easy access there for English only speakers and researchers.\n\nRegarding Robin Hood. I never called you that in the first place. Your definitely nothing like Robin Hood. Thanks for letting me know what criminal biographers of the 18th century thought of him.\n\nAm I still arguing that you should stop this volunteer effort to create Commons educational content, and deserve to be criticized for spending your unpaid volunteer time doing it, or not? No, I didn't propose that you should stop. As a matter of fact had it not been for your efforts there would be be virtually nothing here, but non educational crap. Did I criticize you; no I didn't.\n\nDon't put words in my mouth, and while here, I never told anyone off for not thanking me for any \"compliment\", and I'm not looking for any now either\n\nGiving out some advice or a contrary position to your views is not gaslighting. I have a valid view, and some agree with me.\n\nWhen the newspaper archives who give Wikimedia free access to their websites withdraw it, because we are disturbing their fiscal model we can point to the internet archive being there first. Actually we're not disturbing their model at all. Their model is selling retrievable indexed access, our model is providing access to material that has to be used the old fashioned way 18th century way; by reading it. Broichmore (talk)\n\nThere's also an OCR dataset, according to [10].\n\nMy understanding of this is that Wikimedia Commons is technically limited in way that well-financed websites aren't, to me the issue is with the somewhat isolationist nature of the website and the COIphobia, I am sure that if we created a Patreon-like model for technical volunteers who wish to add their time into developing technical features to help the Commons with better search and categorisation as well as import tools and help better maintain the tools we already had that everyone would win. Those of us that wish to donate our money could and those that don't want to won't. In fact this is theoretically already the case with the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) and Wikimedia Deutschland (WMDE) that have paid employees that work on the technical side of Wikidata and as a consequence as a website it is growing much faster and is better organised than Wikimedia Commons despite having a lot less volunteers. Despite almost existing for two (2) decades Wikimedia Commons doesn't attract newspaper archives to upload their archives here, we don't have easy tools that if people want to donate their digital content to this website that they could after giving VRT permission, and the website barely has any outreach programmes to GLAM organisations.\n\nI don't get why Wikimedia Commons can't natively add text recognition software to help read words in media files here, such a change would benefit literally every Wikisource yet we're lacking the volunteers with the technical skills to do this. Personally I want to invite Wikimedia Deutschland (WMDE) over to use their army of technical users to improve the tools here but I think that they basically only care about Wikidata. The problem with Wikimedia Commons is that as a website it doesn't have a vision, there are no large groups of volunteers here that organise together and try to work with museums and other organisations to digitise, imagine if we had \"a digitisation taskforce\" that approaches archives. I know of a Brazilian user that spent countless hours digitising works to be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons but lost his passion for the project because of the \"bitey\" community. Digitisation projects happen individually here with very little collaboration, Wikimedia Commons is essentially a \"do-it-yourself archive\".\n\nLooking at this I don't think \"We shouldn't take away their incentives by stealing their public domain content\" I think \"How can we convince such organisations to donate directly?\", we should create a partnership programme and try to become a trusted name, The Internet Archive already has such a status but Wikimedia Commons' scope is different and as such should try to build its own reputation, it is quite baffling that despite Wikipedia being one of the world's top websites and most of its images coming from here most people probably have no idea what Wikimedia Commons even is, imagine if some strange website you have never even heard of \"steals\" your public domain content, Wikimedia Commons shouldn't be \"a hidden gem 💎\" forever and importing such archives can create more potential for Wikimedia Commons to prove that it could be \"a better archive\", if we had text recognition software and better integration with Wikidata, and better categorisation, Etc. But for all intents and purposes Wikimedia Commons currently is just \"the website that couldn't\".\n\nSeriously, just think about all the massive archives Fæ imported over the years that have now disappeared from the internet, we shouldn't discourage users from importing any free educational work because who knows how long it will actually be accessible. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nWhy would Commons install text recognition technology? The WMF has installed text recognition technology for Wikisource.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nHi all\n\nI'm very pleased to say the EU's European Investment Bank (the largest not for profit bank in the world) has released its first batch of content under an open license. To the best of my knowledge this is only the second EU body to make content available under an open license, after the Commission.\n\nThey're released around 100 amazing graphs from the largest survey of the public's attitude to what actions should be taken on climate change (+some photos of their buildings). Broadly it shows widespread support for significant action on climate change.\n\nPlease help to encourage them to release more by adding them to articles.\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Content_produced_by_the_European_Investment_Bank\n\nThanks\n\nJohn Cummings (talk)\n\nJust to be safe, I wanted to double-check to verify that certain content would not go against our policy on sexualization of minors, namely \"physique magazines\" of the 1950s/1960s. Wikipedia's w:Physique magazine article gives some background on the genre. Basically, they were presented under the pretense of being about bodybuilding, but their real target audience was gay men. Models for these magazines often included adolescents. There are some examples (mostly covers) under Category:Beefcake magazines. This issue of Physique Pictorial is pretty representative of the genre. The ages given for models range from 16 (including the cover model), to 28. The magazines did not include exposed genitalia or sexual contact between models (or even any references to sexuality), but the sixth criterion at w:Dost test gives me some pause: Whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.\n\nI would tend to think this would not be legally classified as child pornography given that these magazines are available at lots of research libraries (e.g. worldcat lists lots of university libraries with collections of Physique Pictorial) and images from them (including images of under-18 models) have been reprinted in books put out by reputable publishers (e.g. w:David K. Johnson's Buying Gay, published by Columbia University Press). Still I wanted to check here since I'm not familiar with how the community has drawn the line on this kind of material in the past. (There was a recent discussion about this material, but it focused only on the copyright aspects.) Colin M (talk)\n\nSome statements of fact.\n\nCommons is not censored.\n\nCommons does not host child pornography.\n\nThe Dost test (United States v. Dost 1986) has only ever been used in one US court case as part of establishing criteria for assessing photographs of girls aged 10 to 14. It appears to have not been quoted in any court case in over a decade. It makes no sense to try to use it as a way to control what international volunteers are uploading to Commons.\n\nPhysique Pictorial is not child pornography.\n\nScantily clad or nude photographs are not turned into pornography just because a gay man might look at it, rather than some other observer. C.f. Florida v. Brabson, 2008.\n\n--Fæ (talk)\n\nThanks for your thoughts. I brought up the Dost test only because it's specifically mentioned at Help:Sexual content#Prohibited content. Colin M (talk)\n\nThis reference has been removed, see Help_talk:Sexual_content#Dost_test. That help page is effectively a user essay and the original text was rejected as policy. --Fæ (talk)\n\nI'm just going to register here that I'm uncomfortable with that edit. I'm not a lawyer and it's not an area I have experience with, but even I've heard of the Dost test (perhaps not by that name, but that set of criteria). Moreover, you didn't just remove mention of the Dost test, but also the warning that \"Images of minors – even if clothed – can be found to be in violation of child pornography laws\". That seems like the sort of thing we should retain... If it were a policy page I'd certainly err on the side of reverting here, but will defer to others with more knowledge of precedent, I guess. — Rhododendrites talk |\n\nLess is more. There's no need to water down the statement Manufacturing, distributing, possessing, or intentionally accessing child pornography is a very serious charge in the United States, where Wikimedia's servers and main offices are located. By adding the \"Dost test\" you just confuse volunteers and create the risk of encouraging wikilawyers to argue about what that obscure and unused USA \"test\" actually means, for example, it has only ever been used in court for child pornography for very young girls, and Commons is not a host for any child pornography by policy which includes boys, selfies, faked images not of any living child, or even user-created artworks that promote child pornography, none of which is dealt with by vaguely waiving at the dost test.\n\nAgain keep in mind that this is not a policy document, in my opinion, the project would be improved by having this help page essay deleted and a meaningful and enforceable policy used and agreed with WMF Legal. Perhaps during UCOC enforcement discussions, this is something to revisit. --Fæ (talk)\n\nBeyond just saying that we don't allow child pornography (duh), I do think it's important to give the relevant definition of child pornography that we're working with, since there will inevitably be some cases (like the one described above) where files that otherwise fall within COM:SCOPE are at least conceivab"
