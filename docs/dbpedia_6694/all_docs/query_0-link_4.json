MPham (WMF) (talk)\n\nCategory:Gifts Ukraine Needs (Ukraine War)\n\nI would like to see this category removed as quickly as possible, but felt it would be too precipitous for me to do it unilaterally with no consensus at all. CFD seems too slow. While I personally wish Ukraine the absolute best outcome, and I despise Putin, this category amounts to taking sides in a war, which Commons should not be doing.\n\nPinging @Lupus in Saxonia as category creator.\n\nJmabel ! talk\n\nAnd more or less the same for Category:Gifts that Ukraine does not need (Ukraine War). - Jmabel ! talk\n\nWhy? Can the truth in this matter not be tolerated on Wikipedia Commons?-Maybe the world feels better if truths are not mentioned here either? What is the point of what you do? Heartfelt greetings from - --Lupus in Saxonia (talk)\n\nI agree, these kinds of categories are not helpful for organization and are created reflecting recent events rather than memorializing useful information about media on Commons. I'm in support of getting rid of them. aismallard (talk)\n\nCommons is a repository of media. It is not an advocacy organization, not a directory, not an encyclopedia, and not a magazine of opinion. --Animalparty (talk)\n\n@Lupus in Saxonia, while I understand your sentiment und your well-meant intention, this is not the purpose of our category-system, as well summarized by Animalparty. Therefore tagged for speedy deletion. You might consider creating a paragraph/section about this subject in :de/:en Wikipedia article about this terrible war. --Túrelio (talk)\n\n(After edit conflict and possibly redundant now the categories are flagged for speedy deletion) I also support removal. If Commons takes sides in one war, what is to stop another editor causing Commons to take sides in the next war? This will inevitably lead to contentious category trees as the supporters of opposing sides in any conflict turn Commons into an extension of their information war battleground. As stated by others, the remit of Commons is to store files that enable others to present meaningful information, such as news outlets or encyclopedias. Commons must not take on the role of the news outlet or encyclopedia itself. From Hill To Shore (talk)\n\nI support deletion as a bizarre unsourced category. People are just going to make up which belongs in which and I agree, fight on it. Either way, I'm doubtful that a Commons admin will speedy this so I suggest a DR on both. And Commons is very minor is contrast to the various wikis of various languages. -- Ricky81682 (talk)\n\nThese files, creating a map using GeoJson data, have very poor possibilities to add \"meta-data\". I think it would be nice to have similar functionality as in ordinary \"File:*.jpg\".

I just created {{PD-structure}}, intended as a tag for ordinary buildings that are not copyrightable (important for buildings from no -FOP areas like the Philippines). It categorizes files to Category:PD structure. However, I desire to add something that could set the category by country, with the mentioned category as default, without having to change the template itself (similar to {{FoP-Sweden}}'s function), but I cannot do it because it is too technical. Hope someone will be able to do that. JWilz12345 (Talk|Contrib's.)\n\nanswered :This section was archived on a request by: -- sarang♥사랑\n\nThere is a large amount of confusion in subcategories of Category:Diving and Category:Underwater diving because the word diving is commonly used for both and as a result there are complicated miscategorizations within these two. How does one go about sorting this out so that they are separated and files can be allocated correctly? · · · Peter (Southwood) (talk):\n\nOn English Wikipedia they are disambiguated as \"Diving (sport)\" and \"Underwater diving\", which while not ideal, works better than the current system at Commons. I would really like to see something better, but would settle for the same if that is the only reasonable option. · · · Peter (Southwood) (talk):\n\nI have no better idea other than maybe additionally turning Category:Diving into a disambiguation (via {{Disambig}}). El Grafo (talk)\n\nYes that would help. It would show up the miscategorisations.\n\nWould one also rename all the subcategories with \"diving\" in their name which could be ambiguous to show which top category they belong in?, or just ones that have a history of being confusing? · · · Peter (Southwood) (talk):\n\nIs there a tool to transfer all files or a batch of files in a category into another category? · · · Peter (Southwood) (talk):\n\nI have found Cat-a-lot and seem to be getting it to do what I want. · · · Peter (Southwood) (talk):\n\nAm I likely to get any further feedback here? Is there a better place to develop a consensus, or should I just do it? · · · Peter (Southwood) (talk):\n\nSomeone has removed File:Lakhdar Amar.jpg and others in the category from the Wikidata entry, saying we have no proof that the man in the image matches the man pictured in this image at his football profile (the Wikidata person), to me they are the same man maybe 20 years apart. What do you think? The person at Wikidata is Lakhdar Amar (Q111049016). He has the same shape of his face, the same hairline, and the same name. --RAN (talk)\n\nSeems likely to be the same person. It doesn't seem ever to have been in the relevant category, though. Also, Wikidata should normally only have one photo of a person, occasionally two, almost never more.\n\nReally, though, I'd tend to doubt the \"own work\" claim by User:Abdrahmane lakhdar who was here only to make a small number of uploads 6 years ago, some of them from photos as far back as 1957. Possible, but unlikely. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nWhen you scan a photo, the derivative copy you create is your \"own work\", we need to have room for two source entries, one for the original object itself, and one for the newly created derivative copy. Currently the template only accepts one, to the confusion of every new user, and the delight of people looking for a rationale to delete. --RAN (talk)\n\n@Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ): No. A scan does not create any new intellectual property rights. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nMore specifically: it does not create a \"dervative work\". It is considered simply a \"copy\". - Jmabel ! talk\n\nUnless you consider the \"sweat of the brow\" principle, which does allow a new copyright claim, which has been upheld in numerous copyright cases. Also, the Bridgeman copyright case is not part of the Berne agreement or URAA agreement, it was a court ruling that is only applicable within the United States. When Wikimedia Commons users in other countries reuse our material they need to be aware that their country may not have a similar ruling and be required to credit the maker of the derivative work, even if it doesn't restart the copyright clock. Australia adopted wording similar to Bridgeman, while the UK rejected the principle, hence our NPG - WMF disagreement which led to a compromise of Commons reducing the size of the NPG images we store. Most countries have not had a ruling and the status of exact derivative works is unclear. --RAN (talk)\n\nThere is a wikidata talk page. Wouldn't it be better to have this discussion at that page (maybe not in terms of people being aware of it but for being the best place to keep a record of this discussion)? And I agree with Jmabel but I have no background in wikidata's policy on how they determine what images to include. -- Ricky81682 (talk)\n\nI do not want to add a second image to Wikidata, I had the category linked to Wikidata, and the link was removed, I want to restore it. I just restored the link. --RAN (talk)\n\nHi, I \"fixed\" the Template:UgandaMapsDecade (difflink) so that it includes a reference to \"<decade> maps by country\". Now, Category:1960s maps of Uganda are correctly categorized into Category:1960s maps by country, at least according to the Uganda-Maps category. It is however not listed in the parent category - what needs to be done? --Enyavar (talk)\n\nInfo You open Category:1960s maps of Uganda, remove the last indention, and save it. By doing this, the category reflects the latest edit of the template. It will, by the way, not appear on the history of your edits or the category, because removing the last indention is less than a minor edit. --トトト (talk)\n\nWow, so quick. Yet, this means I have to touch every category that is affected by the template. Or is it just the second line (the indention?) that leads to this error? --Enyavar (talk)\n\nI know there's ways to do grab the full resolution copy, but I don't know them.

I see no evidence against this. But nor do I see evidence for. It has fairly strong evidence of anonymous creation if not, insofar as no documentation appears to exist in the archive dedicated to him. Think the copyright status is safe? Adam Cuerden (talk)\n\nI guess the quandary is, is it 1) an official US photo or 2) An anonymous studio photo made public (published, in copyright legal jargon) when a positive print of the negative was sent to the person sitting for the photographer. I would say that version two is the safest and the proper copyright tag would be PD-US-no notice. --RAN (talk)\n\n@Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ): Thanks!

If you reply and tell me the answer, thank you for letting me learn something new. - Anynomous — Preceding unsigned comment was added by 172.97.188.96 (talk)\n\n@172.97.188.96: The lede for the Wikipedia article en:Marsh seems to have an answer. In the future, en:WP:Reference Desk is a better place for this kind of question; this board is for talking about Wikimedia Commons. – BMacZero (🗩)\n\nThere is still a Commons relevant problem: Category:Marshes says nothing about what the category is about. To categorise something there I should click the iw link to Wikipedia. Oops, Swedish is missing. OK, clicking another language, say English. OK: \"A marsh is a wetland that is dominated by herbaceous rather than woody plant species.\" So is there some more specific category? My image is not a salty marsh, so checking Category:High marsh, which seems to be a category that should be deleted.\n\nOK, adding my image to Marches, hoping there is no more specific category and that Commons uses the same definition as the Wikipedia article I looked at. Now, I missed Category:Flooded grasslands and savannas and Category:Wet meadows– aren't those \"dominated by herbaceous plant species\"? Should they be subcategories of Marches? I suspect not; I suspect the Wikipedia definition was a bit imprecise. Perhaps a thorough reading of the article in a foreign language would have helped, but that is too much for categorising one image.\n\nIf there were a description in Marches, like there is in Category:Moorlands, bogs and swamps – if the above IP question were answered there – we'd have a larger proportion of correctly categorised images (and lesser of wrongly categorised). See alsos in the subtypes would also help.\n\nThen the High marsh. As it's in singular, it is probably created by a novice user. There being just one image, with its name in Dutch and uploaded by the category creator, suggests there is no such thing as \"high marsh\" in English. The image has a flooded landscape with dead birches, not a march by the Wikipedia definition at least. One should perhaps check the word-by-word translation of \"high marsh\" to Dutch and get the category and description from there.\n\n–LPfi (talk)\n\nAn additional problem here is that the Wikipedia articles linked from the category may describe slightly different concepts, as words seldom are perfect synonyms. Even between Sweden and Finland (neighbours with mostly the same soil and vegetation types) the scientific wetland categorisation is totally different (as the base categories use different criteria). If I am using the definition in the Swedish article and somebody else is using the Dutch one, we will end up categorising images differently. Therefore, we want to have a single definition in Commons, where the differences around the world are pointed out. –LPfi (talk)\n\nIf you would ask for the difference between totally generic wetland and the geomorphological term marshland/tidal marsh: The marshes _naturally_ emerge from mudflats and were later protected by dikes. Artificially drained (lower than sea level) marshes are called polders.--Mya arenaria (talk)\n\nFile:WUL-bunko19 f0399 0088 五菩薩宝巻.pdf can be called either 五聖宗寶卷 or 五菩薩寶卷. how do i properly present this info in {{Book}}?

Multichill (talk)\n\n​Thank you - it works! :This section was archived on a request by: ---- sarang♥사랑\n\nI am currently working on an article on the Namaqua Afrikaner sheep, for which currently no image is available either on flickr or Wikimedia Commons. But I have found an old article (1960) with photos in it (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0388.1960.tb00132.x). The article was written by someone called Epstein and working at the time at the University of Jerusalem. The Journal in which this study is published is now called Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics and is based in Germany. If the pictures are still covered by the copyright, do you know to which I should adress my request for downloading these pictures on Wikimedia Common (the journal or the University). I guess the juridiction/laws concerning copyrights are not the same in Israel and Germany.\n\nI'm not at all used to copyrights requests / laws, so any answer will be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance, --Braveheidi (talk) PS : I can read German (should someone want to point to an information in German).\n\n@Braveheidi: Those are certainly still in copyright. In both Germany and Israel, copyright is author's lifetime + 70 years. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nWhich would mean that to use them you need the copyright owner's permission. I think that's what Braveheidi intended to do. The copyright might be with the photographer or the journal, and I suppose the article author would be the person most likely to know, and if the photograph was taken by them, they might be able to license the photo under a free licence. However, there seems to be a big risk that the work is orphaned, with nobody knowing who owns the copyright.\n\nThe relevant jurisdictions are those of the first publication of the image and USA (as the servers are there). According to COM:Israel#Durations, copyright for certain works would have a shorter term, but long enough for the URAA to give protection in accordance with US durations (I assume the Israeli URAA date to be 1996), i.e 95 years after first publication. It seems South Africa has a 50 years term for photographs, but 1960+50 would still be after the URAA date. The photograph may of course have been published significantly earlier than the article, but it'd need to be from the 1940s to be old enough.\n\nI don't think fair use is relevant for this use of the photo, but I don't know the US fair use requirements. Otherwise that could be an option on some Wikipedias (including af and en, but not nl).\n\n–LPfi (talk)\n\nHello!\n\nThe Movement Strategy and Governance team of the Wikimedia Foundation would like to invite you to the next event about \"Regional and Thematic Hubs\".

While there are news outlets and individuals grabbing the videos and redistributing them, other than Facebook I am not seeing another way to access original copies. Also, to watch the videos in Facebook, an account is required. The Ukrainian government websites seem down all the time.\n\nhttps://www.president.gov.ua/\n\nI know it is always complicated to ask for copyright to videos, but I am posting here to check community interest in making a request to the Ukrainian government for Wikimedia compatible licenses to host the videos in Wikimedia Commons. If they are here then we could coordinate subtitle translations. I think everyone is aware that Wikipedia is a major information outlet in war. I am not finding other places to access the original high quality video copies, and I think Wikipedia is a suitable host. New outlets run ads before the videos, usually cut them to be shorter than 7 minutes, dub the audio, create barriers to redistribution, and in general alter the videos and context of them.\n\nIf we made a request, ideally we could check the videos in advance for copyright issues beyond government permission. I think there is no music, other images, etc. in them. See Commons:Copyright rules by territory/Ukraine. The request might need to happen through Facebook, but other channels could help. I think the government only posts messages in Ukrainian, and they have no English language outlet. The request would need to be in Ukrainian. I think a short message is fine to see if they bite.\n\nNataliia is the chair of the board of trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation and she is Ukrainian.

Verbcatcher (talk)\n\nHello there, If I would like to ask someone with a copyrighted image they have taken if they could add their image to Wikipedia themselves so it isnt copyrighted what is a page I could link them to on how to do that if they are willing? — Kaleeb18TalkCaleb\n\n@Kaleeb18: Adding your copyrighted image to Wikipedia (or to Commons, the site on which you are writing) does not normally change whether it is copyrighted. It typically involves granting a free license that allows derivatives and commercial reuse, but that is not a waiver of copyright. In particular, if I have licensed an image under CC-BY-SA-4.0 and someone reuses it without crediting me, they have violated my copyright.\n\nTo address what I think is your intent: typically, if the image in question is already on the web on a page obviously controlled by the copyright-holder, then the easiest thing for the copyright holder to do is to indicate on that page that they grant (for example) a CC-BY-SA-4.0 license. Then you, or anyone, can cite that page as a source and upload the image to Commons.\n\nIf for some reason that approach is not feasible, there is also the COM:VRT system, but that takes a lot more work by volunteers and, in my opinion, should be considered a second choice.

But unfortunately usages as at that file do not function any more, sorry. I tried to restore the source code display in the Mauna Loa file, and will try to repair the other ones.\n\nWhen you want to use it that way, it will be possible by directly transcluding the Template:Created with code, as I made as an example with Other versions/Mauna Loa CO2 monthly mean concentration.R but that is a less recommended method - there will not occur any automatic categorization, as for the Mauna Loa file. -- sarang♥사랑\n\n​IMHO the better method is to have the R + validation with each file, but not everwhere the complete code; a link to the file which shows the code might be better, as is done now in Mauna Loa CO2 monthly mean concentration.svg with the option 'external'. -- sarang♥사랑\n\nThanks for your reply @Sarang, I'll look into your propositions.

Showing stills from a public domain work is 100% proper, and the ones deleted are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept. So, if the WB cartoons were not renewed, showing a still from them is proper and has nothing to do with \"character copyright protection. To see if a cartoon was not renewed, check w:List_of_animated_films_in_the_public_domain_in_the_United_States. --RAN (talk)\n\nI have rewritten the section on character copyright that people keep misquoting to make it clearer. --RAN (talk)\n\nCategory:September 1985 in rail transport in Munich There is a template 'rail transport in Munich-year' but nothing beyond.

Well, that's wrong. Confusingly, Belgium has moved the responsibility to set speed limits from a national level to the regional district authorities. Following that, Flanders has decided to go on it's own in 2017, as they changed their out-of-town speed limit to 70 km/h.\n\nFlanders used to have a general out-of-town speed limit of 90 km/h, but Flanders is so densely populated and planning has been so messy (from a Dutch perspective), that you are never ever really out of town in many places in Flanders. No wonder that before 2017 the 70 km/h signs were all over the place. After 2017, all these 70 km/h signs were scrapped and only a few roads, in very thinly populated areas of Flanders, got 90 km/h signs as an exception.\n\nWallonia decided to keep their general out-of-town speed limit at 90 km/h. Flanders had to set up new speed limit information signs at borders at every border crossing, both with the Netherlands and Wallonia. French speaking Wallonia took a French turn and has left a lot of old speed limit information signs for the whole of Belgium in place, especially on the border to Germany.\n\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zul%C3%A4ssige_H%C3%B6chstgeschwindigkeit&oldid=220971184\n\nI have spend too many hours to educate anyone reading German that Belgium now has impossibly complicated speed limit laws, differing by region.

That's a decline, and a low number not seen for a long time. We are severely understaffed, i.e. compared to the English Wikipedia, which is around the same traffic than Commons, but with five times more admins (Also around 80 active admins here against 457 on En WP, rough calculation). We have a huge backlog, and we need more admins. Any idea how to improve that? Thanks, Yann (talk)\n\nWho needs more admins? More specialty rights are needed, including ones whose duties admins barely have time with. Right? --George Ho (talk)\n\nI'd say that it is highly time to revive Alexis Jazz' \"General Maintainer\" user right proposal, we could actually experiment with our situation to have more user groups rather than blindly adopting the English-language Wikipedia's strategy as a \"one-size-fits-all\" model. The diffusion of user rights from the admin model would also make it a less prestigious rank for hat collectors that only want to collect user rights to go after it. We could probably create a couple of \"admin lite\" user rights to make the pressure on the current admins less and to reduce the future need for a minimum numbers of admins to maintain the project. --Donald Trung 『徵國單』 (No Fake News 💬) (WikiProject Numismatics 💴) (Articles 📚)\n\nAlexis Jazz's \"general maintainer\" proposal failed to gain consensus. As I'm sure, any re-proposal of it would also fail. I'm thinking a straight-forward, simple user right proposal without too many duties, and I believe there's nothing wrong with a one-duty user right... right? BTW, unsold on the \"admin lite\" thing. Furthermore, any proposal to create separate right to perform delete duties won't gain consensus anytime soon, but I wish it had. George Ho (talk)\n\nHi, I am a bit confused.

Thanks! —‍CX Zoom (A/अ/অ) (let's talk|contribs)\n\nDark mode is a matter of taste and preferences. To shine a light on this discussion, I need to tell you folks that I really hate how Firefox is forcing dark mode upon me since updating my browser to Firefox 96.

[2] I can see no evidence that the uploader is in a position to upload it under any license. The source cited is an EBay listing of a copy of an 1988 'wire press photo' supposedly from 'a closed newspaper'. The (unnamed) newspaper may possibly be closed, but that doesn't mean that nobody owns the copyright, I'd have thought? AndyTheGrump (talk)\n\nCopyright doesn’t end when the business closes for good, much like copyright doesn’t end when a person (creator) dies, only after a set term after death. I think it should be deleted per COM:PCP (though might need to go through DR). Bidgee (talk)\n\nThe license is correct, the Associated Press never added the copyright symbol to the copy they distributed to the various news outlets. They rarely did for any of their images, their photographers around the world could generate up to 1,000 images a day, and the expense of copyrighting could never be justified. Even some of their most iconic images that were copyrighted were never renewed. This image is the copy they sent to USA Today using their Laser Photo service, a high resolution fax-like machine. We host over 10,000 news service images. I have removed \"glossy Press Photos from a closed newspaper\" which is incorrect, it comes from USA Today, which is still active, but someone kept several images that worked at USA Today and sold them on eBay. I buy them from time to time, mostly older ones that are actual photographic prints. --RAN (talk)\n\nBut the copyright symbol isn't required for something to have copyright protection, and the lack of such a symbol doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I don't understand that part of the argument here. --ZimZalaBim (talk)\n\n@ZimZalaBim: In that era in the U.S., an overt notice of copyright was required. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nYou needed to register a copyright by sending a copy to the copyright office up until 1977, you still had to have a visible copyright symbol up until March 1, 1989, after that everything was automatic, the act of creation generated an automatic copyright, but people still send in copies to the copyright office to certify a date of creation, should there ever be another person claiming authorship. You still see litigation around music creation where there are multiple collaborators and you need documentation of your contributions if you want a portion of the lucrative publication rights. --RAN (talk)\n\nHello everyone,\n\nThank you to everyone who participated in the feedback period for the Leadership Development Working Group initiative.

At this location there are in fact two high speed lines. One in use: Madrid - Sevilla and Madrid - Levant starting from the junction Bifurcación Torrejón de Velasco just beyond. The other tracks are not yet in use and are the tracks of the Chamartin Atocha normal guage tunnel wich have separate tracks up until the Bifurcación Torrejón de Velasco where the tracks continue to the Levant line. See for details in https://www.openrailwaymap.org/. Do we create a separate category for the Chamartin - tunnel - junction Bifurcación Torrejón de Velasco line? It can also be considered a prolongation of the Category:Madrid–Valladolid high-speed rail line. The line will probably be opening in 2022. es:Túneles ferroviarios Atocha-Chamartín Smiley.toerist (talk)\n\nI personally feel that disambiguating in the category name is wise, because if you don't, you'll get a lot of miscategorisation. Perhaps with a \"via\"? Although if they rejoin for part of the route, it would be better to have subcategories, like \"X rail line, Y to Z branch via W\" for each option so the jointly used parts have a place to go.

The question is how this is handled on Commons. Should the logo image of an application (so eg. gedit logo.svg) always be the latest design one or should designs be uploaded to an extra file and the file use should be exchanged?\n\nI would keep the original logo and upload a new version under a new name. The alternative would be that the file is renamed and the new design is uploaded under the old name. So all previous uses point to the original logo, but the application logo.fileextension is used for the latest design.\n\nA problem with Gedit-logo-clean.svg is that it's original design is not added as svg to category Gedit logo.\n\nAny ideas? --D-Kuru (talk)\n\n@D-Kuru: New logos should be uploaded to new files. The old one remains interesting for historical reasons. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nFor files intended to be updated there is {{Current}} and friends. It should be added immediately when the file is uploaded for the first time. Then users – who hopefully check the file description before they link it – know what to expect. Adding such a template later would cause disruption, as different users would get different expectations. Even with such templates, changing the file in an unexpected way is disruptive; sometimes colour coding of maps has been changed on update, causing captions to be misleading. For such changes, a new filename is still needed. –LPfi (talk)\n\nThanks for the reply! I switched all WP pages that want to use the current logo to the file for the current logo. I reverted the old file with a note. Again thanks for the answers. --D-Kuru (talk)\n\nI have little understanding of how Commons works.

However the file name is still incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the image is one of the well-known author Alex Comfort (who write the bestseller The Joy of Sex) and not the Austrian Reinhard Spitzy, as the file name suggests.\n\nI would be most grateful if another editor with more expertise could put this right, either by simply changing the file name (which I can't see how to do) or deleting this file and replacing it with one which is correctly titled (as per the body of the description, ie Alex Comfort appearing on After Dark on 1 July 1989.jpg)\n\nApologies for this confusion and thanks in advance for help. AnOpenMedium (talk)\n\n@AnOpenMedium: Thank you for the information. I've renamed the file following your request (after getting the filename wrong on my first attempt).

AnOpenMedium (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nI believe that we should discuss this with the whole community, I am starting it here because starting it on a talk page on any single category guarantees that nobody will see it.\n\nSo, we have categories of stamps published in every country (and sometimes of former countries or other territories), the format of those categories is akin to Category:Stamps of Bulgaria. There is also a hierarchy of categories of different things shown on stamps, and obviously countries can also be displayed on the stamp, and that brings forth another intersection of a stamp and a country; the format of those categories is akin to Category:Bulgaria on stamps.\n\nNow here is the potential conflict that brings me here. I have created the template {{stamps of country}}, which I have been applying to appropriate categories, and that template places Stamps of Country inside the Country on stamps, my argument is that at least the logo of the country, or the country name is displayed on the stamps. This is true for almost every country, with the notable exception of the United Kingdom (UPU has made that exception, since the first stamps was made in Britain). In parallel Kreuz und quer has been doing the opposite, placing Country on stamps inside Stamps of Country (example). I have reverted them a few times, but now I believe that it is possible that we'll begin some sort of revert war, and I would like to avoid that.\n\nHence, I am looking for some sort of community consensus on this categorisation. ℺ Gone Postal (〠 ✉ • ✍ ⏿)\n\nPing @Kreuz und quer: .

Ww2censor (talk)\n\n@Gone Postal I agree that Stamps of Country makes more sense inside Country on stamps. My doing the opposite was simply out of a desire to link the two categories -- due to the vagaries of the English \"of,\" I hadn't thought too much about hierarchy. But the way you and @RZuo describe it is more logical. I'm happy to change over my categorization if that's the consensus. Kreuz und quer (talk)\n\n@Gone Postal: I don't see why Stamps of Country would be placed inside Country on stamps or vice versa. Country on stamps makes me think the country is depicted on the stamp, not just shown as a word. Why would anyone want to sort stamps by the words they include? That doesn't seem like useful categorization. Also, such an arrangement makes the Country on stamps categories mostly just useless containers for Stamps of Country.

So my question isː are those graphs and tables legally uploaded there? If soː let's expand that categoryǃ If notː delete those files ASAPǃ\n\nAnyway, let's discuss. Regards,̃Jeff5102 (talk)\n\n@Jeff5102: That license doesn't appear compatible with COM:L. \"Revocable\" is a problem (licenses must be non-revocable), and the limitation on reuse in full also sounds like a problem. It looks like some of the existing media is licensed with a threshold of originality rationale, which does circumvent Pew's attempts to apply a more restrictive license (if it is correct), but could be debated. – BMacZero (🗩)\n\n\"The Center provides you with a [...] license to [...] the survey datasets\". I cannot find any indication above that the any graphs would be licensed. The first bullet seems to be about the same as the EU dataset protection (although there is an odd wording making it seem you cannot replicate your own work in full). Do datasets have any protection under US law? In what jurisdiction is this Pew research centre? –LPfi (talk)\n\nI assume that if you use the data to create a derivative work, allowed under the licence, a revocation of the licence wouldn't affect that work, only your ability to create a similar work in the future. That is of course problematic for a database used for academic research, as you wouldn't be able to replicate your results with slightly modified methods, to show your results were robust, and neither could other people replicate them once the licence is globally revoked. Problematic, but not too uncommon (in a project I worked for, we paid for datasets to be used during five years, then to be destroyed unless the contract was renewed – and we were not allowed to share the data) – and mostly irrelevant for Commons. –LPfi (talk)\n\nHere [4] is an example file tagged with a \"wrong license\" tag by a recently blocked user. This file is dated in the 17th century and is Public Domain. The file has a \"Public Domain\" tag already.

Should I revert these tags on all these files, which I am willing to do, if that the correct action?

Thank you, Ooligan (talk)\n\nYou could also ask the user who inserted the tags about why he did that. He is currently blocked here, but seems to be based at the Polish Wikisource project. --Rosenzweig τ\n\nI think this was because the license is not correct. The files are scans of old book and so they are public domain and not just declared CC0 Zero. The correct \"license\" would be {{PD-scan}}. --GPSLeo (talk)\n\n@GPSLeo - I see that the CC0 Zero license was used on these files from a 2014 cooperative project. Would the PD-scan license apply to Public Domain photos? I changed a few licenses to the PD-Poland. Is that ok or is PD-scan more accurate? Thanks, Ooligan (talk)\n\nI do not know what the copyright rules for scans in Poland where in 2014. In Germany it was not clear that scans of PD material are always public domain. This changed with the EU copyright directive. So maybe using CC0 for those files in 2014 was a good way to make this clear. But now this is not needed anymore. I think using {{PD-scan}} only would be fine, because I am not sure if the Poland the law in the template covers includes the Poland of the 17th century. GPSLeo (talk)\n\n@Rosenzweig - The currently blocked User could have just changed the CC0 license to PD-Poland, PD-scan or another appropriate license on each of the dozens of files they tagged for having a \"wrong license.\" That action would have been more efficient, would have corrected the issue immediately and would not require other Users do the work. That same User could have asked this page or another User for help in determining the correct license on all those files tagged as having the wrong license.

It doesn't mention deletion requests or namespace but applies there for sure. Multilingual description is welcomed but not required. There are administrators covering a lot of major languages, so this is not a problem. Often there is the opposite issue; an uploader who doesn't know English not knowing what the deletion request is about and how to fix the issue. For both cases https://translate.google.com/ works fine. TFerenczy (talk)\n\n@Ooligan: Slightly to my surprise, the language policy doesn't explicitly cover this, but I'd expect people to write in a language they feel comfortable in, and for readers to translate as necessary. Google Translate isn't perfect, but it's usually good enough to understand discussions on Commons. --bjh21 (talk)\n\nThank you for checking to see if Commons policy applied to my question. Could you provide a link to this language policy? Thank you, Ooligan (talk)\n\n@Bjh21 added ping. Ooligan (talk)\n\n@Ooligan: TFerenczy provided one above: Commons:Language policy --bjh21 (talk)\n\n@Ooligan: I translated it from Russian for you. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\n@Jeff G. Thank you for the translation. Is there a translation tool on any Wikimedia projects? Again, thank you and Bjh21 for your help. Ooligan (talk)\n\nAnd what about those languages not available in Google Translate? Haoreima (talk)\n\n@Ooligan: You're welcome. Sorry, I don't know of such a tool. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nAlthough you may use any language, if your language is very rare, I'd recommend translating it yourself or asking somebody else (use Category:user xxx, where xxx is the language code) to translate it to some bigger language.

Included in that collection are 827 images taken by John K. Hillers.\n\nThe problem is examplified by, for example, this image record; within it three photographers are listed as Author.\n\nPowell used three consecutive photographers on this 1871 expedition; Elias Olcott Beaman, James Fennemore, and John K. Hillers. Three people cannot take one photograph.\n\nEach of the 827 images in particular has buried in it text the following statement: \"Series: Photographs taken by John K. Hillers during the Powell Survey and other Geological Surveys, compiled ca. 1879 - ca. 1900\" obviously indicating that the photographer is John K. Hillers.\n\nIf someone sufficiently thick and doesnt study the files before using cat-a-lot, they are going to add on false attribution to others than Hilliers.\n\nSolution is for a bot to edit the Author field down to Hillers, by deleting the other two.\n\nAnyone willing to do that? --Broichmore (talk)\n\nWhat do you mean by \"Powell used three consecutive photographers on this 1871 expedition\"? Are images by those photographers elsewhere? Can we trust \"Photographs taken by John K. Hillers during [...]\", or is it possible that the text was put on the records without research on who the actual photographer was? Is it thinkable that the other photographs are mentioned because they might be the real one? Do you have knowledge other than that stated in the file description? –LPfi (talk)\n\n@Broichmore: –LPfi (talk)\n\nFour photographers were on the expedition; two of them acting as assistants. In practical terms three were consecutively principals. Several diaries were kept, and the expedition mapped. I know, from a distance, that some of the plates had numbers, initials or names scratched on them. Photographs in the various collections have annotated notes made on the backs of them. Each image obviously has a definite location, and presumably can be dated with some degree of accuracy. I can't vouch for the accuracy of whatever record labelling we have. I don’t know if a comprehensive study has been made and by whom. --Broichmore (talk)\n\nHello. Does WCommons have a page equivalent to en:Wikipedia:Consensus concerning cases where disagreements arise? I found no such things at Commons:Policies and guidelines. If a WCommons equivalent does not exist, I think it definitely should, if not as a policy at least as a recommendation. Veverve (talk)\n\nI would say that, without (as far as I know) a formal policy, we tend to operate roughly along those lines, with the caveat that because of Commons' nature as a media repository, much larger areas of Commons are the work of single individuals than is typically the case for Wikipedia in any major language. Also, the fact that the COM:Precautionary principle is itself something for which we have consensus often overrides what might otherwise appear to be a consensus about what would be desirable. - Jmabel ! talk\n\n@Jmabel: do you think I should create the WCommons article myself? Veverve (talk)\n\n@Veverve: You could write something, but it wouldn't automatically be policy, it would just be your own statement. To drive it toward being formal policy, you'd have to build a more formal consensus, I presume at Commons:Village pump/Proposals. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nYou can find this message translated into additional languages on Meta-wiki.\n\nThe Community Resilience and Sustainability team at the Wikimedia Foundation is hosting a conversation hour led by its Vice President Maggie Dennis.\n\nTopics within scope for this call include Movement Strategy, Board Governance, Trust and Safety, the Universal Code of Conduct, Community Development, and Human Rights.

De728631 (talk)\n\nFrom Commons:Village_pump/Archive/2020/06#Is there a tool to expand a specific category tree?\n\n@Jeff G. and RZuo: There is a tool to do just this that works on all Wikimedia wikis. It's quite flexible and can traverse subcategories or supercategories with a depth limit and total node limit, showing each category only once in the graph. Here's a query equivalent to Jeff's example. Each graph node is a link to its Commons page (note that only category pages are shown). Here's a more interesting one that is bound by the 250 node limit. Each node links to the query for traversing using the tool starting that node. The other rendering mode is more compact, but makes connections harder to follow when there are many nodes.\n\nCaveat: I did notice that in subcategory mode the node limit is reached at a depth of just 2 for many of the categories I tried it with. This causes the tool to automatically limit the depth of the output to 1 (only immediate subcategories), though you can bypass the limit by rendering yourself as the documentation says.\n\nI saw this thread while trying to search Commons for a link to the tool, which I'd seen before but had forgotten the name of. It seems the single mention at Commons:Categories#Tools isn't very search engine optimized, because I ended up locating it through an amusingly convoluted trail of breadcrumbs:\n\nImage searching for an example of output from the tool\n\nFinding an image on a news site\n\nReverse-image searching to locate that image as originally used on Wikipedia\n\nGoing to its file page on Commons (File:Category-diagram.png)\n\nFollowing the link to the tool in the file description to http://tools.wikimedia.de/~dapete/catgraph/\n\nBeing redirected to https://vcat.toolforge.org/catgraphConvert/, which is now a 404\n\nVisiting that page in the Wayback Machine to finally find a link to Dapete's userpage\n\nIt doesn't look like there is much awareness of the tool outside of German Wikipedia. I'm not sure where I saw it on Commons; perhaps it used to be linked on a more conspicuous page, and the link was deleted when it became a 404. In that case, it could be re-added.\n\nI also came across Commons:Kategoriler#Tools (probably copied from an old version of the English page), which has several links to similar, now-defunct tools. Perhaps the authors can be asked to at least publish the sources. Category visualizations also seem to be called catgraphs in existing Commons parlance, referring to the name of the first version of this tool.\n\nAlso, I'm unsure if there is a prescribed format for reviving an old thread.\n\n--wqnvlz (talk | contribs)\n\nthank you so much! i will spend some time understanding this tool.--RZuo (talk)\n\nI stumbled upon this user's talk page and I noticed that from about 2/3 deep in the page the templates are not expanded anymore.

It seems that Commons somehow is able to extract those and add them as clear information on the image page. I have been wondering if this is generally possible for images on the internet. Sometimes I come across an image where I would like to know who the author is or what the copyright situation is. Is there some way to do that? Thanks, --91.34.36.56\n\nMany graphics programs allow to display image metadata. See for example freeware IrfanView (download at https://www.irfanview.com/). --Túrelio (talk)\n\nHi, and welcome. I use http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi and Windows Explorer's rightclick Properties. — Jeff G. ツ please ping or talk to me\n\nThe information is usually only what the camera (or scanner, imaging software, whatever) adds, so the author is usually missing, and any author filed may just refer to a (former) camera owner.\n\nOn Linux there is the command line tool exiv2 (available also at least for macOS): no need to start any graphical programs. See also Commons:Exif#Editing Exif fields.\n\n–LPfi (talk)\n\nThanks, everyone! I'll try those! --91.34.36.56\n\nWhen I check where a file is used, sometimes I find it linked to an article on Santali WP. But when I follow the link, the page doesn't exist. If I click to create it, it doesn't say that it's been deleted. An example is File:Idioma_azerí.png, which supposedly appears on the page sat:ᱢᱩᱬᱩᱛ:ᱟᱡᱟᱨᱵᱟᱭᱡᱟᱱᱤ ᱯᱟᱹᱨᱥᱤ. If I remove the prefix ᱢᱩᱬᱩᱛ, then I find the article with the file. But this prefix doesn't always appear: sometimes the Commons link takes me to the article.

Thanks MKFI. --Enyavar (talk)\n\nThere is a keyboard icon popping up by most input fields (when the field is activated), with a menu including the IPA-SIL. It is easy to click the one by the search box by mistake, as the box is small and thus the icon is near things you may want to click.

What's the intention of the question? --Schlurcher (talk)\n\n@Schlurcher: i saw File:好又多超市 廣州崗頂店 2008.jpg which had \"自己拍摄\" in the source. i thought your bot didnt recognise this chinese phrase, but then realised it's a 2008 file before your bot started running.\n\nanyway, \"自己拍摄\" (zh-hans) or \"自己拍攝\" (zh-hant) should be replaced by {{Own}}. i'm not sure if your bot already recognises it as such. thx!--RZuo (talk)\n\nDone, added \"自己拍摄\" (zh-hans), \"自己拍攝\" (zh-hant) was already included. I've also on the agenda to run a full dump search soon. --Schlurcher (talk)\n\nHave we found a way to overcome \"SmartFrame\", and extract the highest resolution imagery from pages like [6] (the example, like many on that site, is out of copyright, contrary to the interstitial that claims otherwise)?\n\nI had never heard of this viewer before.

Arlo James Barnes\n\nThere is some more problematic editing by Special:Contributions/Sarangbot: Broadcast_icon.png Fluss-lbach.png and many more. It is most likely NOT useful to move from specific categories to desperately crowded Category:Icons. Is this sort of a deletion process? Taylor 49 (talk)\n\nSeems like someone could not wait for Commons:Categories for discussion/2022/02/Category:Superfluous images to conclude (which I also understand, considering how CfDs can take years...) and went for an alternative. --HyperGaruda (talk)\n\nIn the past, I assumed a new user who is unfamiliar with freedom of panorama, and I nominated a deletion request on a photo of Telus Sky under construction which is located at Canada where there is freedom of panorama.\n\nSee also: Commons:Deletion requests/File:The Telus Twist.jpg\n\nThis was an experiment I did, but in fact, users who are unfamiliar with freedom of panorama may nominate deletion requests on photos of buildings or sculptures in a country where there is freedom of panorama.\n\nIt's easy to make this mistake, especially if users live in a country where there is no freedom of panorama and have experienced that photos of buildings or sculptures they've taken are frequently deleted due to lack of freedom of panorama.\n\nThen, Can I get blocked if I consistently nominate deletion requests to photos of buildings or sculptures in countries with freedom of panorama?\n\nOx1997cow (talk)\n\nIf you nominate a few cases where there is a clear reason for retention, then there is nothing wrong. However, it would be expected for you to learn from the deletion discussions. If you continue to make nominations with the exact same issues, a few editors may suggest that you try focusing in a different area of Commons. If you persist in bringing the exact same issue to deletion review against repeated consensus to keep, then I expect sooner or later your behaviour would be raised at the Administrator's noticeboard. At that point, it would depend on how you interact with the Administrators. If you take efforts to learn from your mistakes and make better nominations or agree to focus on another part of Commons, then you probably won't be blocked. If you continue making the same mistake after it is flagged to Administrators then you will probably enter a cycle of temporary blocks and reblocks until you agree to modify your behaviour. Repeated blocks with no sign of improvement would probably end in a permanent block. However, you should have received plenty of warnings long before then. From Hill To Shore (talk)\n\nMany uploads from the US Library of Congress have incorrect information, such as the spelling of a depicted person's name, and the date. I also sometimes want to expand the description. (I am NOT talking about renaming the file.) For example, I requested and received a rename of the file that is now File:Graphophone LCCN2014719133.jpg. But the description is wrong. Do I have to preserve the original description and date with strikeouts, or can I overwrite them? If I only want to expand the description, do I have to separate it from the LCCN description? Downtowngal (talk)\n\n@Downtowngal: Typically what I do in a case like that is leave their description as is, then use \"----\" on a line of its own as a separator, then clarify the situation. So in this case you might do something like:\n\n|description={{en|1=Title: Sewing machine\n\n''Abstract/medium:'' 1 negative : glass ; 5 x 7 in. or smaller.\n\n----\n\nDespite the LoC saying \"sewing machine\", this is actually a graphophone on a sewing machine table.\n\n}}\n\nJmabel ! talk\n\nThe LoC actually says [Graphophone, an early dictation machine, in a room] [graphic], no mention about a sewing machine, If I am not mistaken? VScode fanboy (talk)\n\n@VScode fanboy: Great, then we can just fix it straightforwardly. I bet they had it wrong when we imported it, but have since corrected it. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nThanks for replying, surely they corrected it afterwards. VScode fanboy (talk)\n\n@Downtowngal: Are you also participating in the LOC project at Flickr Commons? --RAN (talk)\n\nI don't quite understand your question. I am categorizing, on Commons, images from the Bain news service from the 1920s. It looks like the same set of images that are on Flickr. Lots of errors, especially in the dates, and many incomplete descriptions. Downtowngal (talk)\n\nThe project at Flickr is to identify the people in the LOC image and assign a Wikipedia/Wikidata entry to the people in the images and find a more accurate date. At our end here at Commons it means adding a category and adding the image to the Wikidata entry, or creating a new Wikidata entry if the person does not have one. User:Fae transferred the images to Commons. See: this image where the people in a group photo are identified and some of the people are not in Wikidata yet. The LOC releases 50 each Friday to Flickr. Here is an example of creating a wikidata entry whne we do not have one: See: Richmond Temple. --RAN (talk)\n\nI am really confused now. I have never logged into Flickr or categorized an image there. I am finding uncategorized images from the Bain News Service that are already on Commons. Some of these uncategorized images are duplicates of images already categorized on Commons (which may have come from the Flickr project?). And one or both may have incorrect information. What is the optimal workflow here? I think one is needed to avoid duplication of effort and confusion if the files are renamed on Commons. Downtowngal (talk)\n\nYou and I are probably the only people working on the project from the Commons end, but there are a half dozen people working on the LOC project at the Flickr end. Each week the LOC releases 50 new images and they are crowdsourcing information about the images and then you and I transfer that information to Wikimedia Commons. There is a more exact date, we are currently in the year 1924 at Flickr. We also transfer the identity of the person from Flickr to Wikimedia Commons by adding a category for that person. If we identify the exact event that image is displaying, we can add in a link to a New York Times article on that exact event. I also add the Flickr Link to Commons. If you change the name here at commons the only to find the image will be the ggbain number, such as: \"ggbain.36868\". --RAN (talk)\n\nYou stated, \"they are crowdsourcing information about the images and then you and I transfer that information to Wikimedia Commons.\" Not true. *I* am not transferring anything. I am working only with the images that are already on Commons. Any research that I do to find the correct name or date affects only the image that is already on Commons, where I a) change the description/date (as in the above discussion) and/or b) leave a note in the changelog or Talk page of that image. Furthermore, I don't understand what Wikidata is as distinct from a category, and I am happy to continue just categorizing (with its concomitant tasks of a) updating the description and b) using the image on Wikipedia), and not using Wikidata at all. Can you please explain to me what I should a) continue or b) stop doing so that I don't duplicate efforts of other categorizers? Downtowngal (talk)\n\nHere is an example: This image is only labeled as Bendix but someone at Flickr identified him as Jörgen Bendix, so I created a Wikidata entry for him and added the image. See: Jörgen Bendix . --RAN (talk)\n\nTo address the original question: if Library of Congress images and their bot-imported descriptions/metadata have errors, you can change/refine them. No one is under any obligation to preserve incorrect/outdated info, report the correction to the Library of Congress, nor ask permission to modify public domain media or descriptions, although explanatory notes or links to sources that clarify/correct the identification would be appreciated to increase confidence, prevent future confusion, and promote accurate and correct reuse (if a certain image is widely misidentified outside of Wikimedia, an additional note on the file Talk page might be warranted). Commons is not itself a museum or encyclopedia requiring documentation of every previous (mis)identification or "
