Also known as the Perry or FFG-7 class, the warships were designed in the United States in the mid-1970s as general-purpose escort vessels inexpensive enough to be bought in large quantities to replace World War Il-era destroyers. Fifty-five ships were built in the United States: 51 for the United States Navy and four for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). In addition, eight were built in the Republic of China (Taiwan), six in Spain, and two in Australia for their navies. Former U.S. Navy warships of this class have been sold/donated to the navies of Bahrain, Egypt, Poland, and Turkey. Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate • SH-2 Seasprite landing on ORP General Tadeusz Kosciuszko Design and Construction The ships were designed by the — > Bath Iron Works shipyard in Maine in partnership with the New York-based naval architects Gibbs & Cox. The Oliver Hazard Perrv-class ships were produced in 445-foot (136 meter) long \"short-hull\" (Flight I) and 453-foot (138 meter) long \"long-hull\" (FUght IE) variants. The long-hull ships (FFG 8, 28, 29, 32, 33, and 36-61) carry the larger -^ SH-60 Seahawk LAMPS III helicopters, while the short-hulled warships carry the smaller and less-capable — > SH-2 Seasprite LAMPS I. Aside from the lengths of their hulls, the principal difference between the versions is the location of the aft capstan: on long-hull ships, it sits a step below the level of I the flight deck in order to provide clearance for the tail rotor of the longer Seahawk helicopters. The long-hull ships also carry the RAST (Recovery Assist Securing and Traversing) system for the Seahawk, a hook, cable, and winch system that can reel in a Seahawk from a hovering flight, expanding the ship's pitch-and-roll range in which flight operations are permitted. The FFG 8, 29, 32, and 33 were built as \"short-hull\" warships but were later modified into \"long-hull\" warships. American shipyards constructed Oliver Hazard Perry-class, ships for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Early American-built Australian ships were originally built as the \"short-hull\" version, but they were modified during the 1980s to the \"long-hull\" design. Shipyards in Australia, Spain, and the Republic of China have produced several warships of the \"long-hull\" design for their navies. Although the per-ship costs rose greatly over the period of production, all 51 ships planned for the U.S. Navy were built. Some Oliver Hazard Perry-class warships are planned to remain in American service for years, but some of the older ships have been decommissioned and some scrapped. Others of these decommissioned ships have been transferred to the navies of other countries, including Bahrain, Egypt, Poland, and Turkey. Several ot these have replaced old Second World War-built American destroyers that had been given to those countries. The Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates were designed primarily as anti-aircraft and anti-submarine warfare guided-missile warships intended to provide open-ocean escort of amphibious warfare ships and merchant ship convoys in moderate threat environments in a potential war with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries. They could also provide air defense against 1970s- and 1980s-era aircraft and anti-ship missiles. These warships are equipped to escort and protect aircraft carrier battle groups, amphibious landing groups, underway replenishment groups, and merchant ship convoys. They can conduct independent operations to perform such tasks as surveillance of illegal drug smugglers, maritime interception operations, and exercises with other nations. The addition of the Naval Tactical Display System, LAMPS helicopters, and the Tactical Towed Array System (TACTAS) gave these warships a combat capability far beyond the original expectations. They are well-suited for the littoral regions and most war-at-sea scenarios. Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate Notable combat actions Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates made worldwide news twice during the 1980s. Despite being small, these frigates were shown to be extremely durable. During the Iran— Iraq War, on 17 May 1987, the — > USS Stark was attacked by an Iraqi warplane. Struck by two Exocet anti-ship missiles, thirty-seven American sailors died in the deadly prelude to the American Operation Earnest Will, the reflagging and escorting of oil tankers through the Persian Gulf and the Straits of Hormuz. Less than a year later, on 14 April 1988, the USS — > Samuel B. Roberts was nearly sunk by an Iranian mine. No lives were lost, but 10 sailors were evacuated from the warship for medical treatment. The U.S. Navy retaliated four days later with Operation Praying Mantis, a one-day attack on Iranian oil platforms being used as bases for raids on merchant shipping. Those had included bases for the minelaying operations that damaged the USS Samuel B. Roberts. Both frigates were repaired in American shipyards and returned to full service. The USS Stark was decommissioned in 1999, and scrapped in 2006. USS Stark listing to port following an air attack Modifications United States The remaining American \"long-hull\" Oliver Hazard Perry-class warships are being modified to reduce their operating costs. The Detroit Diesel Company electrical generators are being replaced with more modern Caterpillar, Inc. -made diesel engines and the ships' Mk 13 single arm missile launchers and magazines have been removed from all U.S. Navy active frigates because the primary missile that it was meant to fire, the Standard missile SM-IMR, has outlived its service life [1] -^ USS Rodney M. Davis (FFG-60) after the reinoval of her foredeck — > Mk 13 missile launcher. It would supposedly be too costly to refit the Standard Missile SM-IMR missiles, which had a marginal ability to bring down sea-skimming missiles. Another reason for withdrawing the SM-IMR from the American ships is to focus the supplies of these missiles to American allies, such as Poland, Spain, Australia, Turkey, and the Republic of China (Taiwan), which need them most. (Possessing no or few other guided-missile warships in their navies.) With the removal of their — > Mk 13 missile launchers the American Oliver Hazard Perry-class warships also lose their Harpoon anti-ship missile capability. However, their Seahawk helicopters can carry the much shorter-ranged Penguin anti-ship missile, delivered far from the ship by helicopter. The \"zone-defense\" anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) capability has vanished, and all that remains is a \"point-defense\" type of AAW armament. The U.S. Navy plans to update the Oliver Hazard Perry-class warships' — > Phalanx CIWS to the \"Block IB\" capability, which will allow the Mk 15 20 mm Phalanx gun to shoot at fast-moving surface craft and helicopters. The remaining Oliver Hazard Perry-class ships are also to be fitted with the Mk 53 DLS \"Nulka\" missile decoy system, which will be better than the presently-equipped chaff (SRBOC, Super Rapid Blooming Offboard Chaff) and flares at guarding against anti-ship missiles. On June 16, 2009, Vice Adm. Barry McCullough turned down the suggestion of Mel Martinez to keep the Perrys in service, citing their worn out and maxed out condition. Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate Australia As part of a major project of improvements, a one billion Australian dollar moderization project for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Adelaide-class, guided-missile frigates is in progress. This project will include enhancements to both their weapons and other equipment. The costs of the project will be partly offset, in the short run, by the decommissioning and disposal of the two older frigates. HMAS Canberra was decommissioned on 12 November 2005 at naval base HMAS Stirling in Western Australia and HMAS Adelaide was decommissioned at that same naval base on 20 January 2008. The first of the upgraded frigates, HMAS Sydney, returned to the RAN fleet in 2005. Some of the new features include the ability to carry and fire the SM-2 version of the Standard missile, an eight-cell Mk-41 vertical launch system (VLS) for Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles, enhanced air-search radars, and enhanced long-range sonar systems. Each of the four frigates to be upgraded have the work at the Garden Island shipyard in Sydney, Australia, with the modernizations lasting between 18 months and two years. These frigates are planned to be replaced starting in 2013 by three new Hobart-class air warfare destroyers equipped with the AEGIS combat system. However, the third of those destroyers will not be commissioned until 2017, at the earliest. Turkey The Turkish Navy has commenced the modernization of its G class frigates with the GENESIS (Gemi Entegre Sava§ tdare Sistemi) combat management system. The first GENESIS upgraded ship was delivered in 2007, and the last delivery is scheduled for 2011. The \"short-hull\" Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates that are currently part of the Turkish Navy were modified with the ASIST landing platform system at the Istanbul Naval Shipyard, so that they can accommodate the S-70B Seahawk helicopters. Turkey is planning to add one eight-cell Mk 41 Vertical Launching Systems (VLS) for the Evolved Sea Sparrow missile, to be installed forward of the present — > Mk 13 missile launchers, similar to the case in the modernization program of the Australian Adelaide class frigates. There are also plans for new components to be installed that are being developed for the Milgem class warships {Ada class corvettes and F-lOO class frigates) of the Turkish Navy. These include modern Three-dimensional and X-band radars developed by Aselsan and Turkish-made hull-mounted sonars. One of the G class frigates will also be used as a test-bed for Turkey's 4,500-ton TF-2000 class anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) — > frigates that are currently being designed by the Turkish Naval Institute. F-490 TCG Gaziantep is a G class frigate of the Turkish Navy Operators • gH Australia {Adelaide class): The Royal Australian Navy purchased six frigates. Four of them were built in the United States while the other two were built in Australia. They are being upgraded since 2005, with the addition of an eight-cell Mk 41 VLS with 32 Evolved Sea Sparrow (ESSM) missiles, and the Standard Missile SM-2, plus upgraded radars and sonars. • ^ Bahrain: The — > USS Jack Williams (FFG-24), a gift of the American government in 1996, and re-christened the Sabha. • ^J Egypt {Mubarak class frigates): Four Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates were transferred from the U.S. Navy. • Q Pakistan: 6 to be transferred , FFG-8 Mclnerney to be transferred to Pakistani Navy in August, 2010. Poland: Two frigates were transferred from the U.S. Navy in 2002 and 2003. Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate • ^1 Republic of China {Cheng Kung class): Taiwanese-built. Eight ships equipped with 8 Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles, PFG-1 101 and PFG-1 105 now carrying 4 HF-2 and 4 HF-3 supersonic AShM. Rest of the ships in the class will change the anti-ship mix upon their major overhaul. 7 out of 8 ships addes Bofors 40mm/L70 guns for both surface and anti-air use. • ^^ Spain {Santa Maria class): Spanish-built: six frigates. • IM Turkey (G class): Eight former U.S. Navy Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates have been transferred to the Turkish Navy. All eight are undergoing extensive modernization, and they are now know as the G Class frigates. The Turkish Navy modernized G Class frigates have an additional Mk-41 Vertical Launch System capable of launching Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles for close-in, as well as their longer-range SM-1 missiles; advanced digital fire control systems and new Turkish-made sonars. • ^m United States: The U.S. Navy commissioned 51 FFG-7 class frigates between 1977 and 1989. As of early 2008, 30 long-hull Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates remain in active service. On May 11, 2009, the first International Frigate Working Group met in Mayport Naval Station to discuss maintenance, obsolescence and logistics issues regarding Oliver Hazard Perry-class ships of the U.S. and foreign • [11] navies.

He was an older brother to Matthew Calbraith Perry. As a boy, he lived in South Carolina, sailing ships practicing for his future career as an officer in the US Navy. He served in the War of 1812 against Britain, and earned the title \"Hero of Lake Erie\" for leading American forces in a decisive naval victory at the Battle of Lake Erie. The city of Perrysburg, Ohio, Perry County, Kentuckyand its county seat Hazard, Kentucky, the borough of Perryopolis, Pennsylvania, Perry County, Pennsylvania, Oliver Township in Perry County, Pennsylvania, as well as the village of Perrysburg, New York and its the surrounding township are all named after him. Biography Through his mother. Perry is descended from Scotland's national hero, William Wallace [1] Oliver Hazard Perry Educated in Newport, Rhode Island, Perry was appointed a midshipman in the United States Navy on April 7, 1799. During the Quasi-War with France, he was assigned to his father's frigate, the USS General Greene. He first experienced combat on February 9, 1800, off of the French colony of Haiti, which was in a state of rebellion. During the First Barbary War, he initially served on the USS Adams and later commanded USS Nautilus during the capture of Derna. At Perry's request during the War of 1812, he was given command of United States naval forces on Lake Erie. He supervised the building of a small fleet at Dobbin's Landing in Presque Isle Bay in Erie, Pennsylvania. On September 10, 1813, Perry's fleet defended against an attacking British fleet at the Battle of Lake Erie. Perry's flagship, the USS Lawrence, was destroyed in the encounter and Perry was rowed a half-mile through heavy gunfire to transfer command to the USS Niagara, carrying his battle flag (reading \"DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP\", the final words of Captain James Lawrence). Perry's battle report to General William Henry Harrison was famously brief: \"We have met the enemy and they are ours; two ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop.\" His victory opened Canada up to possible invasion, while simultaneously protecting the entire Ohio Valley. It was one of only two significant fleet victories of the war, along with the Battle of Plattsburgh. In 1819, during an expedition to Venezuela's Orinoco River Oliver Hazard Perry died of yellow fever contracted from mosquitos Perry's battle flag DONT GIVE UP THESHIP Oliver Hazard Perry 12 while aboard the Nonsuch. He was 34 years old. Perry's remains were buried in Port of Spain, Trinidad, but were later taken back to the United States and interred in Newport, Rhode Island. After resting briefly in the Old Common Burial Ground, his body was moved a final time to Newport's Island Cemetery, where his brother Matthew C. Perry is also interred. Monuments to Perry are located in Front Park at Buffalo, New York and Perry Square in Erie, Pennsylvania, and Perry's Monument at Put-In-Bay, Ohio.

The term has been used for warships of many sizes and roles over the past few centuries. In the 17th century, the term was used for any warship built for speed and manoeuvrability, the description often used being \"frigate-built\". These could be warships carrying their principal battery of carriage-mounted guns on a single deck or on two decks (with further smaller carriage-mounted guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel). The term was generally used for ships too small to stand in the line of battle, although early line-of-battle ships were frequently referred to as frigates when they were built for speed. In the 18th century, the term referred to ships which were usually as long as a ship-of-the-line and were square-rigged on all three masts (full rigged), but were faster and with lighter armament, used for patrolling and escort. In the definition adopted by the British Admiralty, they were Rated ships of at least 28 guns, carrying their principal armament upon a single continuous deck - the upper deck, while ships-of-the-line possessed two or more continuous decks bearing batteries of guns. Frigates did not carry any guns (or have any gunports) on their lower decks; confusingly, the lower deck was often referred to as the \"gun deck\" in the British Navy (in the American Navy, it was usually called the \"berth deck\"), even for frigates, where it did not carry any guns or have gunports. Both types could (and usually did) additionly carry smaller carriage-mounted guns on their quarter decks and forecastles (the superstructures above the upper deck). Technically, rated ships with fewer than 28 guns could not be classed as frigates but as \"post ships\"; however, in common parlance most post ships were often described as 'frigates', the same casual misuse of the term being extended to smaller two-decked ships that were too small to stand in the line of battle. In the late 19th century (beginning about 1858 with the construction of prototypes by the British and French navies), the armoured frigate was a type of ironclad warship and for a time was the most powerful type of vessel afloat. The term 'frigate' was used because such ships still mounted their principal armament on a single continuous upper deck. The later 19th century battleship thus developed from the frigate rather than from the ship of the line. In modern navies, frigates are used to protect other warships and merchant-marine ships, especially as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups, and merchant convoys. But ship classes dubbed \"frigates\" have also more closely resembled corvettes, destroyers, cruisers and even battleships. The rank Frigate Captain derives from the name of this type of ship. Frigate 14 Age of sail Boudeuse, of Louis Antoine de Bougainville Origins The term \"frigate\" (Italian: fregata; Spanish/Catalan/Portuguese/Sicilian: fragata; Dutch: \"fregat\") originated in the Mediterranean in the late 15th century, referring to a lighter galleass type ship with oars, sails and a light armament, built for speed and maneuverability. In 1583, during the Eighty Years' War, Habsburg Spain recovered the Southern Netherlands from the rebellious Dutch. This soon led to the occupied ports being used as bases for privateers, the Dunkirkers, to attack the shipping of the Dutch and their allies. To achieve this they developed small, maneuverable, sail-only vessels that came to be referred to as frigates. Because most regular navies required ships of greater endurance than the Dunkirker frigates could provide, the useful term 'frigate' was soon applied less exclusively to any relatively fast and elegant sail-only ship, such that much later even the mighty English Sovereign of the Seas was described as 'a delicate frigate' after modifications in 1651. The navy of the Dutch Republic was the first regular navy to build the larger ocean-going frigates. The Dutch navy had three principal tasks in the struggle against Spain: to protect Dutch merchant ships at sea, to blockade the ports of Spanish-held Flanders to damage trade and halt enemy privateering, and to fight the Spanish fleet and prevent troop landings. The first two tasks required speed, shallowness of draft for the shallow waters around the Netherlands, and the ability to carry sufficient supplies to maintain a blockade. The third task required heavy armament, sufficient to fight against the Spanish fleet. The first of these larger battle-capable frigates were built around 1600 at Hoorn in Holland. By the later stages of the Eighty Years War the Dutch had switched entirely from the heavier ships still used by the English and Spanish to the lighter frigates, carrying around 40 guns and weighing around 300 tons. The effectiveness of the Dutch frigates became most visible in the Battle of the Downs in 1639, triggering most other navies, especially the English, to adopt similar innovations. The fleets built by the Commonwealth of England in the 1650s generally consisted of ships described as 'frigates', the largest of which were two-decker 'great frigates' of the third rate. Carrying 60 guns, these vessels were as big and capable as 'great ships' of the time; however, most other frigates at the time were used as 'cruisers': independent fast ships. The term 'frigate' implied a long hull design, which relates directly to speed (see hull speed) and also, in turn, helped the development of the broadside tactic in naval warfare. At this time a further design evolved, reintroducing oars to create the galley frigate such as the Charles Galley of 1676 which was rated as a 32 gun fifth rate but also had a bank of 40 oars set below the upper deck which could be used to propel the ship in the absence of a favourable wind. In French, the term 'frigate' became a verb, meaning 'to build long and low', and an adjective, adding further confusion. [3] Under the rating system of the Royal Navy, by the middle of the 18th century, the term 'frigate' was technically restricted to single-decked ships of the fifth rate, though small 28-gun frigates were classed as sixth rate. Frigate 15 Classic design The classic sailing frigate, well-known today for its role in the Napoleonic wars, can be traced back to French developments in the second quarter of the 18th century. The French-built Medee of 1740 is often regarded as the first example of this type. These ships were square-rigged and carried all their main guns on a single continuous upper deck. The lower deck, known as the \"gun deck\", now carried no armament, and functioned as a \"berth deck\" where the crew lived, and was in fact placed below the waterline of the new frigates. The new sailing frigates were able to fight with all their guns when the seas were so rough that comparable two-deckers had to close the gun-ports on their lower decks (see the Action of 13 January 1797, for an example when this was decisive). Like the larger 74 which was developed at the same time, the new frigates sailed very well and were good fighting vessels due to a combination of long hulls and low upperworks compared to vessels of comparable size and firepower. The Royal Navy captured a handful of the new French frigates during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740—1748) and were impressed by them, particularly for their inshore handling capabilities. They soon built copies and started to adapt the type to their own needs, setting the standard for other frigates as a superpower. The first British frigates carried 28 guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-four 9-pounder guns (the remaining four smaller guns were carried on the quarter deck) but soon developed into Fifth Rates ships of 32 or 36 guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-six 12-pounder guns (with the remaining six or ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle). From around 1778, a larger \"heavy\" frigate was developed with a main battery of twenty-six or twenty-eight 18-pounder guns (again with the remaining ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle). Royal Navy frigates of the late 18th century included the 1780- vintage Perseverance class, which measured around 900 tons burthen and carried 36 guns; this successful class was followed by numerous other classes that measured over 1,000 tons burthen and carried 38 guns. In 1797, the US Navy's first six major ships were 44-gun frigates (or \"super-frigates\"), which actually carried fifty-six to sixty 24-pounder long guns and 36-pounder or 48-pounder carronades on two decks, and were exceptionally powerful and tough. These ships were so well-armed that they were often seen as equal to smaller ships of the line and, after a series of losses at the outbreak of the War of 1812, Royal Navy fighting instructions ordered British frigates (usually of 38 guns or less) to never engage American frigates at any less than a 2:1 advantage. USS Constitution, preserved as a museum ship by the US Navy, is the oldest commissioned frigate afloat, and is a surviving example of a frigate from the Age of Sail. Constitution and her sister ships were created in a response to deal with the Barbary Coast pirates and in conjunction with the Naval Act of 1794. The six ships when built had a distinctive building pattern which minimized \"hogging\" (in which the centre of the keel rises while both ends drop) and improves hydrodynamic efficiency. The hull was designed so that all the weight from the guns was upon the keel itself. Joshua Humphreys proposed that only live oak, a tree that grew only in America, should be used to build these ships. The method was to use diagonal riders, eight on each side that sat a 45 degree angle. These beams of live oak were about two feet wide and around a foot thick and helped to maintain the shape of the hull, serving also to reduce flexibility and to minimize impacts. These ideas were considered revolutionary in the late 18th and early 19th century. A three-layer method was used in which the planks along the sides of the hull were laid horizontally across the ribs, making a crossing or checker board pattern. The sides of the ship could be as thick as 25 inches, and were able to absorb substantial damage. The strength of this braced construction earned USS Constitution the nickname \"Old Ironsides\". Frigate 16 Role Frigates were perhaps the hardest-worked of warship types during the Age of Sail. While smaller than a ship-of-the-line, they were formidable opponents for the large numbers of sloops and gunboats, not to mention privateers or merchantmen. Able to carry six months' stores, they had very long range; and vessels larger than frigates were considered too valuable to operate independently. Frigates scouted for the fleet, went on commerce-raiding missions and patrols, conveyed messages and dignitaries. Usually frigates would fight in small numbers or singly against other frigates. They would avoid contact with ships-of-the-line; even in the midst of a fleet engagement it was bad etiquette for a ship of the line to fire on an enemy frigate which had not fired first. For officers in the Royal Navy a frigate was a desirable posting. Frigates often saw action, which meant a greater chance of glory, promotion, and prize money. Unlike larger ships that were placed in ordinary, frigates were kept in service in peacetime as a cost-saving measure and to provide experience to frigate captains and officers which would be useful in wartime. Frigates could also carry marines for boarding enemy ships or for operations on shore. Frigate armament ranged from 22 guns on one deck to 60 guns on two decks. Common armament was 32 to 44 long guns, from 8- to 24-pounders (3.6 to 11 kg), plus a few carronades (large bore short-range guns). Frigates remained a crucial element of navies until the mid- 19th century. The first ironclads were classified as 'frigates' because of the number of guns they carried. However, terminology changed as iron and steam became the norm, and the role of the frigate was assumed first by the protected cruiser and then by the light cruiser. Frigates are often the vessel of choice in historical naval novels due to their relative freedom compared to ships of the line (kept for fleet actions) and smaller vessels (generally assigned to a home port and less widely ranging). For example the Patrick O'Brian Aubrey— Maturin series, C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower series and Alexander Kent's Richard Bolitho series. The motion picture Master and Commander features a reconstructed historic frigate, HMS Rose, to depict Aubrey's frigate HMS Surprise. The fictitious, but representative, ironclad frigate USS Abraham Lincoln, from Jules Verne's the novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea Frigate 17 Age of steam Vessels classed as frigates continued to play a great role in navies with the adoption of steam power in the 19th century. In the 1830s navies experimented with large paddle steamers equipped with large guns mounted on one deck, which were termed 'paddle frigates'. From the mid- 1840s frigates which more closely resembled the traditional sailing frigate were built with steam engines and screw propellers. These 'screw frigates', built first of wood and later of iron, continued to perform the traditional role of the frigate until late in the 19th century. ^ jl . ^ u '^\"■■-, j^ fey* y^J'Sjl ■ French paddle frigate Descartes From 1859, armour was added to ships based on existing frigate and I ship of the line designs. The additional weight of the armour on these first ironclad warships meant that they could have only one gun deck, and they were technically frigates, even though they were more powerful than existing ships-of-the-line and occupied the same strategic role. The phrase 'armoured frigate' remained in use for some time to denote a sail-equipped, broadside-firing type of ironclad. Towards the end of the 19th century, the term 'frigate' fell out of use. Armoured vessels were designated as either 'battleships' or 'armoured cruisers', while unarmoured vessels including frigates and sloops were classified as 'unprotected cruisers'. Modern Age Second World War Modern frigates are related to earlier frigates only by name. The term \"frigate\" was readopted during World War II by the Royal Navy to describe a new type of anti-submarine escort vessel that was larger than a corvette, but smaller than a destroyer. The frigate was introduced to remedy some of the shortcomings inherent in the corvette design: limited armament, a hull form not suited to open-ocean work, a single shaft which limited speed and maneuverability, and a lack of range. The frigate was designed and built to the same mercantile construction standards (scantlings) as the corvette, allowing manufacture by yards unused to warship construction. The first frigates of the River class (1941) were essentially two sets of corvette machinery in one larger hull, armed with the latest Hedgehog anti-submarine weapon. The frigate possessed less offensive firepower and speed than a destroyer, but such qualities were not required for anti-submarine warfare. Submarines were slow, and ASDIC sets did not operate effectively at speeds of over 20 knots. Rather, the frigate was an austere and weatherly vessel suitable for mass-construction and fitted with the latest innovations in anti-submarine warfare. As the frigate was intended purely for convoy duties, and not to deploy with the fleet, it had limited range and speed. The contemporaneous German Flottenbegleiter (\"fleet escorts\"), also known as \"F-Boats\" were essentially frigates. They were based on a pre-war Oberkommando der Marine concept of vessels which could fill roles such as fast minesweeper, minelayer, merchant escort and anti-submarine vessel. Because of the Treaty of Versailles their displacement was officially limited to 600 tons, although in reality they exceeded this by about 100 tons. F-boats had two stacks and two 105 mm gun turrets. The design was flawed because of its narrow beam, sharp bow and unreliable high pressure steam turbines. F-boats suffered relatively heavy losses and were succeeded in operational duties later in the war by Type 35 and Elbing class torpedo boats. Flottenbegleiter remained in service as advanced training vessels. It was not until the Royal Navy's Bay class of 1944 that a British design bearing the name of frigate was produced for fleet use, although it still suffered from limited speed. These frigates were similar to the United States Navy's (USN) destroyer escorts (DE), although the latter had greater speed and offensive armament to better suit them to fleet deployments. American DEs serving in the British Royal Navy were rated as frigates, and British-influenced Frigate 18 Tacoma class frigates serving in the USN were classed as patrol frigates (PF). One of the most successful post-1945 designs was the British Leander class frigate, which was used by several navies. Guided missile role OLIVER HAZARD PERRY Cla?^ tUSA) NEUS7RASHIMT Class (RUiS'-fa) The introduction of the surface-to-air missile after the Second World War made relatively small ships effective for anti-aircraft warfare (AAW): the \"guided missile frigate.\" In the USN, these vessels were called \"Ocean Escorts\" and designated \"DE\" or \"DEG\" until 1975 - a holdover from the World War 11 Destroyer Escort or DE. British Navy maintained the use of the term \"frigate.\" Soviet Navy used the term \"guard-ship\" (cxopojKeBOH Kopa6jii.). From the 1950s to the 1970s, the USN commissioned ships classed as guided missile frigates which were actually AAW cruisers built on ^^4^ destroyer-style hulls. Some of these ships — the Bainbridge-, Truxtun-, ' ^^^■^■f -*\"-^C» California- and Virginia- classes — were nuclear-powered. These were larger than any previous frigates and the use of the term frigate here is much more analogous to its original use. All such ships were reclassified as guided missile cruisers (CG / CGN) or, in the case of the smaller FarragMf-class, as guided missile destroyers (DDG) in 1975. The last of these particular frigates were struck from the Naval Vessel Register in the 1990s. Nearly all modern frigates are equipped with some form of offensive or defensive missiles, and as such are rated as guided-missile frigates (FFG). Improvements in surface-to-air missiles (e.g., the Eurosam Aster 15) allow modern guided-missile frigates to form the core of many modern navies and to be used as a fleet defence platform, without the need for specialised AAW frigates. U FAyETTL Class (francftj HALJFAJf; CUss (Canada) Modern frigates Anti-submarine role At the opposite end of the spectrum, some frigates are specialised for anti-submarine warfare (ASW). Increasing submarine speeds towards the end of the Second World War (see German Type XXI submarine) greatly reduced the margin of speed superiority of frigate over submarine. The frigate could no longer be slow and powered by mercantile machinery and consequently postwar fiigates, such as the Whitby class, were faster. Such ships carry improved sonar equipment, such as the variable depth sonar or towed array, and specialised weapons such as torpedoes, forward-throwing weapons such as Limbo and missile-carried anti-submarine torpedoes such as ASROC or Ikara. Surface-to-air missiles such as Sea Sparrow and surface-to-surface missiles such as Exocet give them defensive and offensive capabilities. The Royal Navy's original Type 22 frigate is an example of a specialised ASW frigate. Especially for ASW, most modern frigates have a landing deck and hangar aft to operate helicopters, eliminating the need for the frigate to close with unknown sub-surface threats, and using fast helicopters to attack nuclear submarines which may be faster than surface warships. For this task the helicopter is equipped with sensors such as sonobuoys, wire-mounted dipping sonar and magnetic anomaly detectors to identify possible threats, and torpedoes or depth-charges to attack them. With their onboard radar helicopters can also be used to reconnoitre over-the-horizon targets and, if equipped with anti-ship missiles such as Penguin or Sea Skua, to attack them. The HMS Somerset ot the Royal Navy. Type 23 frigates are leading anti-submarine warfare frigates. Frigate 19 helicopter is also invaluable for search and rescue operation and has largely replaced the use of small boats or the jackstay rig for such duties as transferring personnel, mail and cargo between ships or to shore. With helicopters these tasks can be accomplished faster and less dangerously, and without the need for the frigate to slow down or change course. Further developments Stealth technology has been introduced in modern frigate design. Frigate shapes are designed to offer a minimal radar cross section, which also lends them good air penetration; the maneuverability of these frigates has been compared to that of sailing ships. Examples are the French La Fayette-cla&s, with the Aster 15 missile for anti-missile capabilities, the German F125 class and Sachsen class frigates and also the Turkish Milgem type corvettes and TF-2000 type Frigates with the MK-41 VLS. The modern French Navy applies the term frigate to both frigates and destroyers in service. Pennant numbers remain divided between F-series numbers for those ships internationally recognized as frigates and D-series pennant numbers for those more traditionally recognized as destroyers. This can result in some confusion as certain classes are referred to as frigates in French service while similar ships in other navies are referred to as destroyers. This also results in some recent classes of French ships being among the largest in the world to carry the rating of frigate. Also in the German Navy frigates were used to replace aging destroyers; however in size and role the new German frigates exceed the former class of destroyers. The future German F125 class frigate will be the largest class of frigates worldwide with a displacement of 7,200 tons. The same was done in the Spanish Navy, which went ahead with the deployment of the first Aegis frigates, the F-lOO class frigates. Some new classes of frigates are optimized for high-speed deployment and combat with small craft rather than combat between equal opponents; an example is the U.S. Littoral Combat Ship.

Aircraft carried: 2 x ^ SH-60 LAMPS III helicopters USS Mclnerney (FFG-8), second ship of the — > Oliver Hazard Perry class of guided-missile — > frigates, is the first United States Navy ship named for Vice Admiral Francis X. Mclnerney (1899—1956). Ordered from — > Bath Iron Works on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY75 program, Mclnerney was laid down on 16 January 1978, launched on 4 November 1978, and commissioned on 15 December 1979. 1980s Mclnerney s mission is to provide multi-threat protection for military and merchant shipping, amphibious task forces and underway replenishment groups. During her first two years of service, Mclnerney was the US Navy test platform for the LAMPS MK-III(SH-60B helicopter) anti-submarine warfare system and the Recovery Assist, Secure, and Traverse (RAST) system. Her efforts during this period earned her a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Mclnerney'^ first major deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean began in November 1982. During this deployment she embarked a LAMPS Mk-I (SH-2 Seasprite) helicopter detachment. Mclnerney made brief port visits to Tangiers, Morocco, and Catania, Sicily and supported the Multi-National Force in Beirut, Lebanon (earning her the Navy Expeditionary Medal). After transiting the Suez Canal, Mclnerney operated in the Indian Ocean and made port calls to Karachi, Pakistan, Columbo, Sri Lanka, and Mombasa, Kenya. She also crossed the equator enroute to Diego Garcia. Following this deployment, Mclnerney operated in the Caribbean and visited Port Limon, Costa Rica and Tela, Hondurus. She received the Coast Guard Operational Meritorious Unit Citation for her efforts in law enforcement during this period. In October 1984, Mclnerney deployed again to the Middle East in the midst of the Iran/Iraq Tanker War. She had now been fitted with the Phalanx CIWS and also carried a LAMPS Mk-I (SH-2 Seasprite) helicopter detachment. During this deployment she visited ports in United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Palma, Spain. Mclnerney returned from this cruise in March 1985, and conducted law enforcement operations and other fleet exercises. In May 1986, Mclnerney began a year-long overhaul (extended Selected Restricted Availability) in Boston, MA. During this yard period she received the AN/SQQ-89(V)2 Anti-Submarine Warfare Suite, fin stabilizers, and the Single Audio System. The RAST equipment was also reinstalled and made operational. In August 1988, Mclnerney was underway for her third deployment — this one to the Mediterranean. This deployment was highlighted by Mclnerney being awarded the COMSIXTHFLT \"Hook 'Em\" Award for excellence in Anti-Submarine Warfare and a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Mclnerney returned from the Mediterranean in February 1989, and departed for the Northern Atlantic in the spring of 1989. Anti-Submarine Warfare operations led the Mclnerney above the Arctic Circle, and Mclnerney returned to Mayport in May 1989. 1990s Mclnerney deployed to the Middle East in January 1991 and was awarded her second \"Hook 'Em\" Award after a brief ASW operation in the Mediterranean Sea. Mclnerney then entered the Persian Gulf in support of coalition forces against Iraq. Mclnerney performed in every warfare area during the conflict, including convoy escort, mine, anti-air and anti-surface operations. Mclnerney earned the Navy Unit Commendation, the National Service Defense Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal with Bronze Star, the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) and the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait) for her wartime service. USS Mclnerney (FFG-8) 27 The ship returned from the Middle East in July 1991 after escorting more than 50 merchant vessels through the mine-swept waters to Kuwait ports. Her continued, proven prowess earned her the Battle \"E\" for efficiency, and the COMNAVSURFLANT ASW Award, designating her as the top AN/SQQ-89-configured ASW platform on the East Coast. Mclnerney & humanitarian efforts include assisting the tug Taurus in the Jacksonville Operating Area, transferring a wounded merchant seaman during the Tanker War, rescuing Sailors from the sinking motor vessel Jenneastar in the Mediterranean and escorting merchant ships carrying needed supplies to the ports of Kuwait through mine-swept channels in the aftermath of Operation Desert Storm. In 1999, the USS Mclnerney participated in the UNIT AS 40-99 deployment to South America. 2000s Mclnerney completed a highly successful SOUTHCOM Counter-Drug Operations Deployment in November 2001. The highlight of the deployment was a drug bust of an Ecuadorian fishing vessel in which nearly 10 tons of cocaine were seized. For her efforts throughout the deployment, Mclnerney was awarded the Humanitarian Award and the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation. On September 13, 2008, Mclnerney intercepted a 59-foot self-propelled semisubmersible carrying 7 tons of cocaine off the coast of Guatemala. Four Colombian drug smugglers were captured aboard. The cargo had an estimated street value of $187 million. On October 5, 2009, Mclnerney left Mayport Naval Station on its final deployment. Pakistan Transfer In September 2008 the US Congress approved selling the frigate to Pakistan with a delivery date of August 2010. Sighting the Foreign Assistance Act and the Arms Export Control Act, Pakistan is considered a \"major non-NATO ally\", able to receive older unneeded US military equipment. Additionally, the 32 year old frigate will be given a 65 million dollar refurbishment including anti-submarine capability paid for with foreign military aid provided by the U.S to friendly countries. The ship will be inactivated by the US Navy on August 31, 2010 in preparation for the transfer to Pakistan.
