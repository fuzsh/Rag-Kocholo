        "text": "A European Politics of Education proposes a sociology of education establishing connections between empirical data coming from European-scale comparative surveys, normative assumptions structuring actors’ representations and interpretative judgements, and a specific focus on Lifelong Learning policy areas. It invites readers to think about the place of standards, expertise and calculations in the European space from a common perspective, supported by a tradition of critical sociology and European political studies.\n\nThe book:\n\nAddresses an important agenda: how the policies and politics of supranational Europe are making a European educational space\n\nContains a response to the emergence of new epistemic governance and instruments at European level\n\nContains contributions from the EU and the UK which give a comprehensive selection of perspectives and analysis of the field as it concerns Europe\n\nThe complexity of the contemporary European education policy space is addressed here with new lines of inquiry as well as a reflexive outlook, on standardization, policy-making and actor engagement. Students and researchers of European policy studies, education policy analysts and theorists will all be particularly interested readers.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nRomuald Normand and Jean-Louis Derouet\n\n2 Standards and Standardization in European politics of Education\n\nPaolo Landri\n\n3 Policy transfers in Europe: the European Union and beyond\n\nMagdaléna Hadjiisky\n\n4 The Praise of mutual Surveillance in Europe\n\nLuís Miguel Carvalho and Estela Costa\n\n5 Policy Learning and Expertise in European Education\n\nRomuald Normand\n\n6 Ranking and the Structuration of a transnational Field of Higher Education\n\nNiilo Kauppi\n\n7 Higher education: from « unclear technologies » to human resources management techniques\n\nJean-Émile Charlier and Sarah Croché\n\n8 Universities, the risk industry and capitalism: a political economy critique\n\nSusan L.
