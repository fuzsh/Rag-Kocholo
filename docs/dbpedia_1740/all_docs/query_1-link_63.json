        "text": "Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, a champion of interfaith dialogue as a top Vatican diplomat and the man who announced Pope Francis’s election to the world, died on July 5 in Hartford. He was 75.\n\nThe Vatican, which announced his death, said he had been treated for Parkinson’s disease for years.\n\nAt his death, Cardinal Tauran was camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, the official who takes care of the church’s administration during the transition between the death or resignation of a pope and the election of his successor.\n\nBut he was best known for his work as the Vatican’s foreign minister, from 1975 to 1983, which gained him a reputation as a tireless behind-the-scenes diplomat. That reputation persuaded Pope Benedict XVI in 2007 to appoint him president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, shortly after the pope gave a speech in which he quoted a 14th-century Byzantine emperor as calling Islam “evil and inhuman,” offending Muslims and spurring protests against the Roman Catholic Church all over the world.\n\nWhen Cardinal Tauran traveled to Saudi Arabia three months ago to meet King Salman and sign a cooperation accord with the Saudi authorities, he said that people everywhere were threatened “not by the clash of civilizations, but by the clash of forms of ignorance and radicalism.” Over the years, in his speeches to Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists, he reiterated that all men and women of good will should work for dialogue and tolerance.\n\n“Dialogue is not for the consumption of the community,” he said in a 2013 interview. “It’s at the service of society.”\n\nCardinal Tauran made a distinction between Islam and those who commit acts of terrorism in Islam’s name. “It must be clear that the defenders of the oppressed are not the terrorists but the believers, along with men and women of good will who do not profess religion,” he commented after the terror attacks in Paris in 2015.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
