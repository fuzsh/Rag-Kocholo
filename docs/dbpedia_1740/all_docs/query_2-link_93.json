Maybe once a month I receive an aerospace med paper to review. The local med school, OHSU, tolerates me to teach the first year students. Not to be trusted with an aero engine any more, I fly gliders with the Willamette Valley Soaring Club. Julie and I travel often to see our children in Dublin, London, and California. I am studying Russian, and gave a lecture to a group of Russian Av Med docs in Moscow last fall, in Russian...maybe. I ordered the Class of 63 recommended book: \"Grit\". I figure, if the cadets need it, I do too! Best wishes to all Golden Boys. 2020-04-14 Al Anderer I tried to delete myself from Linkedin @ 10 years ago and found it impossible to do so. I therefore dummied the info & edited my name to Nino Baldachi. A number of you (1963) and others have tried to connect with Nino over the years. I was just trying to disappear but now think it would be an opportunity to carry on a class tradition. Anyone want to take over the site and try to find Nino a place in the world? Let me know.

He is now in western Kansas and \"getting stronger\"!!

It was during a night landing gone wrong and proved that the rocket seats worked at ground level. It also fused the instructor's windscreen. Does that make me the first in the class to eject? 2006-01-19 George Looks nice! amazing site. awesome content. 2006-01-19 Bob \"The Venk&q A dubious distinction: I think I was the last Golden Boy to eject from an aircraft -- F4G near Edwards on 6/1/81. Hank Hoffman recently said that he was the last of us to \"use\" an ejection seat while ferrying an OV-10 to S. America in '05. I corrected him: sitting on one is not the same as \"using\" one! Anyone else with a more recent claim? 2006-01-10 Don Yarbrough I attended pilot training at Williams AFB, UPT class 64B. A large number of AFA grads were in that class and won their wings with me.

As I'm sure you remember, we were in several squadrons while we were there but 22nd squadron is the squadron we graduated in.

I received my commission from ROTC that year and was assigned to James Connally AFB in August. My wife and I met and made friends with one of your classmates, Jack (John E.) Zimmerman and his wife, Polly. In 1964, we parted ways as 2nd Lts. We lost track of them in the late 60's. Recently I found through internet sources that he may have retired in 1988 as an O-6, and the last known civilian addresses were in Knoxville, TN, and somewhere in MD. If any of you know the whereabouts or how I may contact Jack and Polly, please contact me or have Jack contact me, William Bullock, at CandBBullock@aol.com.

Don 2005-08-10 Barney Bartlett Fifty summers ago, in 1959, we arrived at the new Air Force Academy and took our first step forward as classmates. Now, the 50th class has taken that same first step. I am happy to say that my son, Austin, is a member of that class of 2009 and will be a Fourthclassman in 3rd Squadron this fall. I thought I would be the last member of 1963 to have a child at the Academy, but Skip’s article in the recent checkpoints revealed that John Heimburger and Ralph Bacue have children in the class. The April orientation for appointees discussed in Checkpoints was excellent for us also. Lynn and I are now discovering that being the parent of a basic cadet is more of an emotional challenge than we anticipated, but it is fun to be a part of the direct Academy experience again. Steve Dotson’s earlier comment in this forum about 40 years of service for the T-38 got me to thinking if there had been a class arriving at the Academy in 1909 -- fifty years before us. In March of 1909, the New York Aeronautical Society bought the first Aeroplane sold in America from Glenn Curtiss. On August 02, 1909, the U.S. Army purchased the world’s first military heavier than air flying machine from the Wright Brothers. On August 28, 1909, Glen Curtiss won the first ever air race in Reims, France by covering a 12.42 mile course in 15 minutes, 53.5 seconds. Austin has his sights set on flying an F-22 or a Joint Strike Fighter, quite possibly the last of the manned fighter aircraft. What can the next 50 years bring for him? It’s exciting to think about. Thank you for this website. 2005-07-30 Gil Merkle Received from Frank Karasienski's widow Maria: Hi, I'm Maria Karasienski, Frank's Widow and I would love to let you know some of what Frank managed to do during his lifetime. I really miss him and miss having him with us. He built buildings from Michigan to El Salvador and from New Hampshire to Denver. He completed infrastructure in Atlanta as well as many buildings in San Antonio. Of course, his classmate Don Shillcut, helped him with the Math, and boy, he really worked! That ruler was better than a computer to him. Thank you Don, for everything. Frank received a Masters and a Theologian degree. Additionally, he pastored ten little churches; all these accomplishments were a lot from one who got mad at me because I messed up his ending last in the class. Oh well! We had two boys, and now we have five granddaughters and four grandsons. Frank was a good man because while all this was going on, he fought Agent Orange(AO) and half of the diseases AO could cause. He fought them valiantly. Each and every illness he got, he fought until two years ago when he experienced a combination of stroke and a massive heart attack. When I see all he did while he fought Agent Orange, one thing after another, I'm amazed! Thank you, Don Schillcut, because without your help I would not have been able to go to the Academy for Frank's interment. The problem was that you can't save money or have insurance when you have the mess of illnesses Frank had through the years. So he died on the floor of an inner city high rise with only Joe (our son) and I to help him. He put me through Nursing school and I was there when he went. I couldn't help him; he was in unbelievable pain. AO causes great pain; yet he lived a life that was wonderfully blessed. He loved people and everyone loved him. I know his classmates loved him and I thank you all for that. Thank you for being his friend.

She was 89 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for almost 10 years and had fallen and broken both hips. My brother John (deceased) retired as an O5 from the USMC after 27 yrs and I had 30 yrs. in the USAF. Rose was an ardent supporter of USAFA and became an Air Force dependent parent for many years, living with us and helping raise our two children while my wife Marsha was incapacitated due to a long, chronic illness. One of those children, Mark, is now a Captain in the Kansas Air National Guard at Forbes Field, Topeka, Kansas. Rose was buried in Greenville, New York on November 18, next to her beloved husband, and my father, Jerry D. Adinolfi, Sr. I entered the Academy from Greenville, New York in 1959. Sincerely, Jerry D.

Angie and I had a super time at our 40th & look forward to the 45th. There is a pretty good chance we will be there in Oct 04 for the Navy game with our daughter and her family. Look forward to joining the locals for their \"famous\" tailgate! 2004-02-11 Steve Dotson As some of our classmates pointed out during the reunion, if guys from a class that had graduated 40 years earlier had showed up for a reunion when we were firsties, they would have been from the Class of 1923. They would have seen several generations of trainer aircraft come and go between 1923 and 1963. What's really remarkable, though, is that the graduates of the Class of 2003 will train in the incomparable T-38 Talon that gave us so many thrills and memories years ago. For those of us fortunate enough to have flown the \"White Rocket\" in a first assignment immediately after pilot training, the staying power of this remarkable airplane is completely understandable. 2003-12-17 Harry Allen Pam and I are living in Las Vegas.

Moved back to the land of my birth(Sallisaw, Oklahoma) in 1990. Worked awhile, met an engaging redhead who turned out to more than just engaging, then bought a lifetime hunting and fishing license and started a small business with my new wife. The deer and bass are pretty much safe from my predations, but 16 full time employees and a couple of part-timers do not leave much time. I have of course grown to really hate the IRS, State Tax Commision, and various other gov't regulatory agencies. The SOB gov't sent me a medicare card last spring, much to my mother's delight. Other than that, life is full and rich and the alarum still goes off at 0600 six days a week. Three dogs, two cats, a Chinese fighting fish named Rambo, grandchildren, church and civic duties round out the week. Trudy and I are looking forward to a few days of respite in early October. Beat the hell out of Army!!! 2003-09-5 Joe Peters Virus checks done daily @ petersagency@csweb.net 2003-09-5 Grant Bornzin This is a terrific way to catch up on news. Lots of material for Skip’s quarterly Checkpoints update. Anyway I can’t wait to see all of you “old guys” in November. Truthfully, I don’t know whether I should be jealous or not, but unlike many of you I’m not even thinking of retirement. However, I must admit that in this continuing recession my patience with the work-a-day world has been growing thin. Time to start a new venture – or is it an adventure? With this thought in mind, I came across a transcription of our own John Borling’s interview with radio talk show host Jeff Berkowitz in Chicago. It seems that John may soon announce his candidacy for US Senate from Illinois. http://ericzorn.com/extra/borling/ Damn, I wish I were a registered Illinois voter. Go to it, John! 2003-09-1 Tom Fox's wife, Mari As many of you know, Tom died suddenly in May, 2000. We miss Tom tremendously but we are very grateful for having such a loving and devoted father and husband. Many of Tom's classmates have been a great support to our family and we deeply appreciate this. Tom felt a great bond with his classmates. He told me many stories of life at the AFA and a lot of these stories had Tom and friends, \"living on the edge.\" I was fortunate to attend the 10th & 25th reunion and was able to meet many of Tom's friends. Tom & I were very busy and happy raising our six children. Life was never dull! Colleen is a consultant in Boston. John is a Lt in the USCG--a CGA grad and now in the Persian Gulf, Patrick, Capt in the AF, AFA '98 KC 10 pilot at McGuire, Kathleen teaches in FL, Tim just got a degree in engineering and has a job in the Boston area and Molly will be headed to the U. of Notre Dame next month. I teach fourth grade in Concord, NH. Thanks for keeping me on the mailing list.
