        "text": "THE GOODWILL FOR A MEETING: THAT'S CINEMA1\n\nExcerpts by Henri Langlois / Jean-Louis Comolli / Nicholas Ray\n\nDOWNLOAD\n\nHenri Langlois\n\nSilent cinema is the image. And what is the image? It is a diamond. A diamond which men learned to cut, polish and set off to advantage, but which always retains its irreducible nature. The sound film is an alloy. It is a ceramic. How can one fuse these two things?\n\n[...]\n\nWhen I lecture, I sometimes take the liberty of cutting off a film’s soundtrack. If you do this to M (Fritz Lang, 1931), the images become flat; switch it on again, and they regain their tone. This shows that M is a true talking picture. Deprived of sound, The Most Dangerous Game (Ernest B. Schoedsack and Irving Pichel, 1932) reveals what its soundtrack conceals. You see people whose lips move but whose eyes and faces are expressionless. They are in effect people talking, but saying what? They make a pretence of speaking, they imitate people talking. Do you see what I mean? It was through experimenting like this that I realised Gabin was nothing without sound. Why? Because he wanted to seem natural, and since the stress was laid on the dialogue, the result was naturalism.\n\nThere is one man, just one, who succeeded in making a homogeneous whole out of talking pictures, and he is dead. Vigo. He took sound, image, music and dialogue and merged them –and I mean merged, not mixed. The result was L’Atalante (1934). Seeing this film you see why the cinema is dying from a horrible disease: naturalism. By naturalism I mean a servile imitation of reality. No film seems more naturalistic than L’Atalante. But only seems: in fact it is a stained glass window.\n\n[…]\n\nThe cinema is a means towards the acquisition of knowledge in the manner of St. Thomas: by touch. Read all you like about love, but if you haven’t made love your idea of it will be totally false."
