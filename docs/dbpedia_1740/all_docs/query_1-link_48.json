        "text": "In this digital age, trust is everything. Cybersecurity is crucial to ensuring universal, trustworthy, and equitable access to connectivity. While the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) enables better management and increased productivity, the use of digital systems also generates risks. In fact, cyberthreats and cyberattacks give rise to ever-growing security challenges for both the public and private sectors in all countries. Enhancing cybersecurity and protecting critical information infrastructures are essential to every nation's social and economic development. Cybersecurity-related incidents can compromise the availability, integrity and confidentiality of information transiting on networks and disrupt the operations and functioning of critical infrastructure, digital and physical. They can also compromise the security of people and whole countries. [1]\n\n[1] https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/backgrounders/Pages/role-of-ITU-in-building-confidence-and-trust-inthe-use-of-ICTs.aspx#cyberthreats\n\n“Strengthening the trust framework, including information security and network security, authentication, privacy and consumer protection, is a prerequisite for the development of the Information Society and for building confidence among users of ICTs. A global culture of cyber-security needs to be promoted, developed and implemented in cooperation with all stakeholders and international expert bodies. These efforts should be supported by increased international cooperation. Within this global culture of cyber-security, it is important to enhance security and to ensure the protection of data and privacy, while enhancing access and trade. In addition, it must take into account the level of social and economic development of each country and respect the development-oriented aspects of the Information Society. While recognizing the principles of universal and non-discriminatory access to ICTs for all nations, we support the activities of the United Nations to prevent the potential use of ICTs for purposes that are inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security, and may adversely affect the integrity of the infrastructure within States, to the detriment of their security. It is necessary to prevent the use of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights.”\n\nGeneva Declaration of Principles, https://www.itu.int/net/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html\n\nPreetam Maloor is the Head of the Emerging Technologies Division at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the specialized United Nations Agency for Information and Communication Technologies.\n\nAn accomplished international civil servant with more than two decades of experience in Technology matters, he is an expert on Artificial Intelligence and international cyber-related public policy matters.
