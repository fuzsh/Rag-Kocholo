Several airports are clear, including the two major international airports of Orly and Le Bourget. Paris was founded in pre-Roman times on an island in the Seine River and continued as a Roman outpost. The easily defensible location was one of the keys to the growth of this island city. The city expanded from its island state to become a major urban center in Europe because of its location, its easy access by river traffic, and its productive hinterland.\n\n[Suicide in Paris and Ile-de-France].\n\nPubMed\n\nLecomte, D; Hatton, F; Jougla, E; Le Toullec, A\n\n1995-01-01\n\nA study carried out in collaboration between the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Paris and the INSERM (SC8) concerned all the suicide occurred in Paris region over 1990; 455 suicides in Paris and 1,229 in the suburbs of Paris (overall, 1,684 suicides observed in Paris area for the same period). For Paris city, the rate of suicide reaches 23.3 per 100,000 subjects. This frequency increases up to 40 years and falls after this age with a further rise between 75 and 85 years. Suicide represents 17% of the total mortality for adolescents and young adults living in Paris, with a large over-representation of males (277 males, 178 females). Suicide is more frequent before 45 years in Paris than in France but this tendency is reversed after 45 years. It represents the first cause of violent deaths among young population (15-34 years) living in Paris and is, after AIDS, the second cause of death. In Paris suburbs, it constitutes the second cause of mortality after traffic accidents. The mode of suicide in Paris is essentially poisoning, then hanging and jumping from high place. In contrast, outside Paris, the hanging is more frequently used than poisoning and firearms. The contribution of the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Paris is essential for the knowledge of these voluntary deaths, a large part of them being unknown in the National statistic of causes of death. This underestimation is extremely important: only 68% of the suicides are known by the Official Statistic in Paris region and 26% for Paris city.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nPaleoclimate records at high latitude in Arctic during the Paleogene\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSalpin, Marie; Schnyder, Johann; Baudin, FranÃ§ois; Suan, Guillaume; Labrousse, LoÃ¯c; Popescu, Speranta; Suc, Jean-Pierre\n\n2015-04-01\n\nPaleoclimate records at high latitude in Arctic during the Paleogene SALPIN Marie1,2, SCHNYDER Johann1,2, BAUDIN FranÃ§ois1,2, SUAN Guillaume3, LABROUSSE LoÃ¯c1,2, POPESCU Speranta4, SUC Jean-Pierre1,4 1: Sorbonne UniversitÃ©s, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMR 7193, Institut des Sciences de la Terre Paris (iSTeP), F 75005, Paris, France 2: CNRS, UMR 7193, Institut des Sciences de la Terre Paris (iSTeP), F 75005 Paris, France 3: UCB Lyon 1, UMR 5276, LGLTPE, 69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France 4: GEOBIOSTRATDATA.CONSULTING, 385 Route du Mas Rillier 69140 Rillieux la Pape, France The Paleogene is a period of important variations of the Earth climate system either in warming or cooling. The climatic optima of the Paleogene have been recognized both in continental and marine environment. This study focus on high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, in the Arctic Basin. The basin has had an influence on the Cenozoic global climate change according to its polar position. Is there a specific behaviour of the Arctic Basin with respect to global climatic stimuli? Are there possible mechanisms of coupling/decoupling of its dynamics with respect to the global ocean? To answer these questions a unique collection of sedimentary series of Paleogene age interval has been assembled from the Laurentian margin in Northern Yukon (Canada) and from the Siberian margin (New Siberian Islands). Selected continental successions of Paleocene-Eocene age were used to study the response of the Arctic system to known global events, e.g. the climatic optima of the Paleogene (the so-called PETM, ETM2 or the Azolla events). Two sections of Paleocene-Eocene age were sampled near the Mackenzie delta, the so-called Coal Mine (CoMi) and Caribou Hills (CaH) sections. The aim of the study is to precise the climatic fluctuations and to characterise the source rock potential of the basin, eventually linked to the warming events.

It is based on the daily chemical composition of PM2.5 characterised during one year at an urban background site of Paris (Bressi et al., 2013). Positive Matrix Factorization (EPA PMF3.0) was used to identify and apportion the sources of fine aerosols; bootstrapping was performed to determine the adequate number of PMF factors, and statistics (root mean square error, coefficient of determination, etc.) were examined to better model PM2.5 mass and chemical components. Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) and Conditional Probability Function (CPF) allowed the geographical origins of the sources to be assessed; special attention was paid to implement suitable weighting functions. Seven factors named ammonium sulfate (A.S.) rich factor, ammonium nitrate (A.N.) rich factor, heavy oil combustion, road traffic, biomass burning, marine aerosols and metals industry were identified; a detailed discussion of their chemical characteristics is reported. They respectively contribute 27, 24, 17, 14, 12, 6 and 1% of PM2.5 mass (14.7 Î¼g m-3) on the annual average; their seasonal variability is discussed. The A.S. and A.N. rich factors have undergone north-eastward mid- or long-range transport from Continental Europe, heavy oil combustion mainly stems from northern France and the English Channel, whereas road traffic and biomass burning are primarily locally emitted. Therefore, on average more than half of PM2.5 mass measured in the city of Paris is due to mid- or long-range transport of secondary aerosols stemming from continental Europe, whereas local sources only contribute a quarter of the annual averaged mass. These results imply that fine aerosols abatement policies conducted at the local scale may not be sufficient to notably reduce PM2.5 levels at urban background sites in\n\nSources and geographical origins of fine aerosols in Paris (France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBressi, M.; Sciare, J.; Ghersi, V.; Mihalopoulos, N.; Petit, J.-E.; Nicolas, J.

The first aim of this study is to estimate the total amount of anthropogenic Pb inputs in soils and to distinguish Pb due to diffuse pollution from geochemical background Pb. Secondly, this study tries to find the main controlling factors of the spatial distribution of anthropogenic Pb. We used the technique of relative topsoil enhancement to evaluate the anthropogenic stock of Pb and we performed lognormal kriging to map Pb regional distribution. The results show a strong gradient of anthropogenic stock of Pb around the urban Paris area. We estimate a total amount of anthropogenic stock of Pb close to 143,000 metric tons, which corresponds to an average accumulation of 5.9 t km(-2). Our study suggests that a grid-based survey can help to quantify diffuse Pb contamination by using robust techniques of calculation and that it might also be used to validate predictions of deposition models.\n\nCity of Paris, France\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis highly detailed view of the City of Paris 49.0N, 0.0E) shows a varied land use pattern in great detail.

Nevertheless such observations, only partially understood, are the subject of much skepticism. Radon-222 is a radioactive gas, daughter of radium-226 from alpha-decay in the uranium-238 decay chain that is naturally present in rocks and soils. Its escape is facilitated by preferential pathways such as fractures. Its half-life is 3.8 days only. As a consequence, radon may accumulate during short period only, and is thought to be released prior, during and after earthquakes as stress is discharged and new fluid pathways are made available. However, the physical processes involved in radon emanation during stress variations remain mostly unknown in the field and poorly studied in the laboratory. Here, we investigate radon emanation from various granite samples: Isla Craig, Westerly, La Peyratte and various leucogranites. Radon emanation and diffusion length, measured first on intact samples, are compared with measurements performed after heating at 850Â°C. Despite extensive thermal fracturing, radon emanation decreases irreversibly after heating compared to intact sample, and the higher the heating temperature the smaller the radon emanation. This is explained by the disappearance of water-film at grain boundaries, which plays an important role in radon percolation through the porous space, and then, at higher temperatures, by dehydration and melting of biotites where radium is concentrated. The recoil range of radon is likely shorter in melted biotites than in intact ones.

The objective of this study was to evaluate predictive factors for CMV seronegativity in a cohort of pregnant women in Paris, France. Pregnant women enrolled in a prospective cohort during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic were tested for CMV IgG antibodies. Variables collected were age, geographic origin, lifestyle, work characteristics, socioeconomic status, gravidity, parity and number of children at home. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify independent predictive factors for CMV seropositivity. Among the 826 women enrolled, 389 (47.1%) were primiparous, and 552 (67.1%) had Metropolitan France as a geographic origin. Out of these, 355 (i.e. 57.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI): [53.6%-60.4%]) were CMV seropositive: 43.7% (95% CI:[39.5%-47.9%]) in those whose geographic origin was Metropolitan France and 84.1% in those with other origins (95% CI:[79.2%-88.3%]). Determinants associated with CMV seropositivity in a multivariate logistic regression model were: (i) geographic origin (p<0.001(compared with Metropolitan France, geographic origins of Africa adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 21.2, 95% CI:[9.7-46.5], French overseas departments and territories and other origin, aOR 7.5, 95% CI:[3.9-14.6], and Europe or Asia, aOR 2.2, 95% CI: [1.3-3.7]); and (ii) gravidity (pâ=â0.019), (compared with gravidityâ=â1, if gravidityâ¥3, aORâ=â1.5, 95% CI: [1.1-2.2]; if gravidityâ=â2, aORâ=â1.0, 95% CI: [0.7-1.4]). Work characteristics and socioeconomic status were not independently associated with CMV seropositivity. In this cohort of pregnant women, a geographic origin of Metropolitan France and a low gravidity were predictive factors for CMV low seropositivity. Such women are therefore the likely target population for prevention of CMV infection during pregnancy in France.\n\nPredictive Factors of Cytomegalovirus Seropositivity among Pregnant Women in Paris, France\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNâDiaye, Dieynaba S.; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Krivine, Anne; Andrieu, Thibaut; Rozenberg, Flore; Picone, Olivier; Tsatsaris, Vassilis; Goffinet, FranÃ§ois; Launay, Odile\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most frequent cause of congenital infection.

In 2013, a survey was performed on homeless families in order to characterize their living conditions, their health needs, and the developmental problems in children. This probability survey was conducted in 17 languages among 801 homeless families sheltered in emergency centers for asylum-seekers, emergency housing centers, social rehabilitation centers, and social hotels in the Paris region. Among the 772 families that provided data on food security only 14.0% were with food security, whereas 43.3% were with low food security and 9.8% with very low food security (a situation where children are also affected). Stratified multivariate robust Poisson models showed that some characteristics are associated with a higher risk of food insecurity and/or of falling into very low food security, such as residential instability, single parenthood, having more than three children, depressive symptoms, housing in social hostels, and difficult access to cheap or free food locally. Given the wealth of the Paris region, resources and programs should be concentrated on improving the living situation of this vulnerable population. It needs better detection of these families, a closer social follow-up, and an increase in food aid.

The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of women who had never been screened for cervical cancer and to identify the associated factors. This cross-sectional study was based on data collected in the ENFAMS survey, which was conducted in 2013 among 764 sheltered homeless mothers in the Greater Paris Area. Robust Poisson regression models were used to estimate the association between no lifetime CCS and certain sociodemographic and health-related factors (selected from the behavioral model of vulnerable populations). Analyses were carried out separately for women with and without a regular gynaecological follow-up (RGF). The proportion of never-screeners was 33% among the women with an RGF versus 64% among those without an RGF (P<0.001). Among the latter, never having been screened for CCS was associated mainly with socioeconomic conditions, the length of time lived in France, a history of delivery in France and the duration of homelessness. In those with an RGF, the factors were mainly poor health service utilization and language difficulties. This first quantitative study of CCS among homeless women in the Greater Paris Area points to the need for it to be proposed and performed more systematically in primary care. Every contact between this hard-to-reach population and health services should be an opportunity to check their screening status and to ensure that those in need actually undergo a Pap test.\n\nGreenliteâ¢: a year of carbon dioxide monitoring over paris, france, and recent progress in monitoring methane\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDobler, Jeremy; Zaccheo, T.

Methods A representative, population-based, random sample of the adult, French speaking population of the Paris metropolitan area was interviewed in 2005. Self-reported BMI (BMI = weight/height2) and overweight (BMI â¥ 25) were our 2 outcomes of interest. Two variables were constructed to estimate individualsâ migration origin: parental nationality and the proportion of lifetime spent in mainland France, as declared by the participants. We performed multilevel regression models among different gender and age groups, adjusted for demographics and socioeconomic status. Results In women, a parental origin in the Middle East or North Africa (MENA) was associated with a higher risk of being overweight (especially before the age of 55) and a higher BMI (between 35 and 54 years of age), and so were women of Sub-Sahara African parental origin in the middle age category. Only in the youngest men (< 35 years of age) did we observe any association with parental nationality, with a higher BMI when having a MENA parentage. Regarding the association between the proportion of lifetime spent in France and overweight, we observed that, in women, a proportion of 50% to 99% appeared to be associated with overweight, especially after the age of 35. In men, having spent more than half of oneâs lifetime in France was associated with a higher risk of overweight among oldest men. Conclusions Our results plea for potential cultural determinants of overweight in the migrant and migrants-born populations in the French context of the capital region. Taking into account the peopleâ family and personal migration histories may be an important issue in public health research and policies on overweight and\n\nCharacteristics and health of homeless families: the ENFAMS survey in the Paris region, France 2013.\n\nPubMed\n\nVandentorren, StÃ©phanie; Le MÃ©ner, Erwan; Oppenchaim, Nicolas; Arnaud, Amandine; Jangal, Candy; Caum, Carme; Vuillermoz, CÃ©cile; Martin-Fernandez, Judith; Lioret, Sandrine; Roze, Mathilde; Le Strat, Yann; Guyavarch, Emmanuelle\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe objectives were to estimate the size of homeless family population in Paris region, to describe their living conditions and health and to analyse the impact of homelessness on children's growth and development, which was never investigated in France. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a random sample of homeless sheltered families in 2013. Families were interviewed in 17 languages and a nurse took anthropometric measures, blood samples and collected health data from child health reports. The population size was estimated at 10 280 families. Half were single-parent female families and 94% were born outside France. Most families had experienced housing instability and 94% were living below the poverty line (828 euros/month). Malnutrition was a major problem: the prevalence of food insecurity was high (77% of parents and 69% of children), as well as anaemia (50% of mothers and 38% of children), overweight (38% of mothers and 22% of children) and obesity (32% of mothers and 4% of children). High rates of depressive disorders were found in 30% of homeless mothers and 20% of children had signs of possible mental health disorders. These first results highlight the important number of families among the homeless population in Paris region. Families differed from other homeless people regarding social characteristics such as birthplace, single-parent status and residential instability that are likely to influence schooling, social ties, health and access to care. These results demonstrate the need for urgent actions targeting homeless families, in terms of reducing housing instability and providing adequate care, especially for children. Â© The Author 2015.

Its long and fascinating history began in the 18th century. In 1952, it was at Sainte-Anne Hospital that Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker used the first neuroleptic, chlorpromazine, to cure psychiatric patients, putting an end to the expansion of psychosurgery. The Department of Neuro-psychosurgery was created in 1941. The works of successive heads of the Neurosurgery Department at Sainte-Anne Hospital summarized the history of psychosurgery in France. Pierre Puech defined psychosurgery as the necessary cooperation between neurosurgeons and psychiatrists to treat the conditions causing psychiatric symptoms, from brain tumors to mental health disorders. He reported the results of his series of 369 cases and underlined the necessity for proper follow-up and postoperative re-education, illustrating the relative caution of French neurosurgeons concerning psychosurgery. Marcel David and his assistants tried to follow their patients closely postoperatively; this resulted in numerous publications with significant follow-up and conclusions. As early as 1955, David reported intellectual degradation 2 years after prefrontal leucotomies. Jean Talairach, a psychiatrist who eventually trained as a neurosurgeon, was the first to describe anterior capsulotomy in 1949. He operated in several hospitals outside of Paris, including the Sarthe Psychiatric Hospital and the Public Institution of Mental Health in the Lille region. He developed stereotactic surgery, notably stereo-electroencephalography, for epilepsy surgery but also to treat psychiatric patients using stereotactic lesioning with radiofrequency ablation or radioactive seeds of yttrium-90. The evolution of functional neurosurgery has been marked by the development of deep brain stimulation, in particular for obsessive-compulsive disorder, replacing the former lesional stereotactic procedures.

The seismic interpretation supported by in-depth facies analysis permitted to depict the potential depositional environments offshore Lebanon as no well has yet been drilled. The Levant region has been affected by successive geodynamic events that modified the architecture of its margin and basin from a Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic rift into a Late Cretaceous subduction followed by collision and Miocene-Present strike slip motion. The interplay between major geodynamic events as well as sea level fluctuations impacted on the sedimentary infill of the basin. During Jurassic and Cretaceous, the Levant Margin is dominated by the aggradation of a carbonate platform while deepwater mixed-systems prevailed in the basin.

A qualitative study].\n\nPubMed\n\nde Brie, Claire; Piet, Emmanuelle; Chariot, Patrick\n\n2018-03-01\n\nViolence for educational purpose refers to a modality of education that includes threats, verbal abuse, physical abuse and humiliations. Twenty European countries, not including France, have abolished corporal punishment through explicit laws and regulations. The position of general practitioners in the screening and care of violence for educational purpose in France is unknown. In this study, we aimed to assess the representations of this form of violence among general practitioners. We have performed semi-directed interviews of general practitioners in the Paris, France region (Ãle-de-France). Interviews were conducted until data saturation was achieved. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed by two investigators. Interviews were conducted with 20Â physicians (November 2015-January 2016). General practitioners considered that physical, verbal or psychological abuse had possible negative consequences on children. Uncertainty regarding the consequences of violence was a cause of tolerance towards violence for educational purpose, depending on the act committed and the context, as perceived by nearly all practitioners. General practitioners expressed interest in the field. They cited their own education and experience as the main obstacles to action. Most of them expressed a feeling of failure when they screened or took care of violence for educational purpose. This study suggests that doctors can participate in supporting the parents in the prevention of violence for educational purpose. Support to parents would need specific medical training as well as a societal change. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Huge investments have been made in Paris conurbation to improve waste water treatment processes in accordance with the European Water Framework Directive. The interdepartmental association for sewage disposal in Paris conurbation (SIAAP) carried out a monitoring of both fish assemblages and water quality in the Seine River around the Paris conurbation (France) since the early 90's. The main goal of this study was to estimate the influence of the water quality improvement on fish. On one hand, the study confirmed the improvement of the water quality (dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, organic matter) in the Seine River, mostly focused downstream of Paris conurbation. On the other hand, an increase of the number of species occurred from 1990 (14) to 2013 (21). Moreover, changes in the river Seine assemblages happened over that 23-year period with emergence of sensitive species (ruffe, scalpin and pike-perch). The improvement of the water quality was also reported with respect to the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). However, no variation of pollutant concentrations in roach, eel and chub muscles has been observed. An exceedance of the environmental quality standards have even been reported all over this period as regards mercury and organochlorine.\n\nMessier, Copernicus, Flamsteed: The SAF Rare-Book Collection in Paris\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPasachoff, Jay M.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe historic books belonging to the SociÃ©tÃ© Astronomique de France, founded by Camille Flammarion in 1887, are located partly in Paris and partly at the Flammarion site in Juvisy, a Paris suburb.

CFP is endemic to tropical areas and may be described in travelers in non-endemic areas. We describe two clusters of autochthonous cases of CFP in Paris, France. They were related to two fish caught in Guadeloupe (French West Indies) and consumed in Paris after being air-transported in a cooler. In both cases, fish flesh was analyzed and the presence of ciguatoxins by mouse bioassay (MBA) was confirmed. The first cluster involved eight individuals among whom five presented gastrointestinal symptoms and four presented neurological symptoms after consuming barracuda flesh (Sphyraena barracuda). The second cluster involved a couple who consumed a grey snapper (Lutjanus griseus). Most of them consulted at different emergency departments in the region of Paris. CFP may be seen in non-traveler patients outside endemic countries resulting from imported species of fish. Thus, CFP may be undiagnosed as physicians are not aware of this tropical disease outside endemic countries. The detection of ciguatoxins by MBA in the French National Reference Laboratory is useful in the confirmation of the diagnosis.

Cognitive categories of soundscapes were inferred by means of psycholinguistic analyses of verbal data and of mathematical analyses of similarity judgments. Results show that auditory judgments mainly rely on source identification. The appraisal of urban noise therefore depends on the qualitative evaluation of noise sources. The salience of human sounds in public spaces has been demonstrated, in relation to pleasantness judgments: soundscapes with human presence tend to be perceived as more pleasant than soundscapes consisting solely of mechanical sounds. Furthermore, human sounds are qualitatively processed as indicators of human outdoor activities, such as open markets, pedestrian areas, and sidewalk cafe districts that reflect city life. In contrast, mechanical noises (mainly traffic noise) are commonly described in terms of physical properties (temporal structure, intensity) of a permanent background noise that also characterizes urban areas. This connotes considering both quantitative and qualitative descriptions to account for the diversity of cognitive interpretations of urban soundscapes, since subjective evaluations depend both on the meaning attributed to noise sources and on inherent properties of the acoustic signal.\n\nPreface - 'NANOSMAT-Paris 2017'\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Hosson, Jeff Th.

The opening ceremony and welcome reception was chaired by Professor Herbert Y Meltzer, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA, President of C.I.N.P., and a new president was elected (Professor Brian E. Leonard, Ireland). Congress included the rich social program, combined with lectures of invited speakers, speeches and awards. There were 6650 registered participants all over the world. The meeting consisted of 4 plenary lectures (held by Professor FE Bloom, Department of Neuropharmacology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla USA, Professor HY Meltzer, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA, Professor CL Masters, The University of Melbourne, and the Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia, and Professor JP Changeux, CNRS URA 2182 Recepteurs and Cognition, Paris, France), 69 symposia, 5 synthesia, 25 satellite symposia, 2 electronic interactive sessions, 6 meet the expert sessions, 11 sessions that were held under the name breaking scientific news, 6 workshops, 5 joint meetings, and 2 poster sessions with 657 posters. Posters were displayed for 2 days between 12.00 to 18.00 h, and presenters were available between 16.30 and 18.00 h to answer the questions. Abstracts from the congress were published in International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, vol 7, Supplement 1, June 2004. The 24th Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum (C.I.N.P.) Congress introduced some new exciting data, summarized some new knowledge, and its goal was to connect the preclinical and clinical data and to introduce some news into clinical practice. The smaller part of the congress that I was able to follow was well organized, and very good attended, with diverse topics, covering all aspects of neuropsychopharmacological research. The sponsorship by the pharmaceutical industries was visible only in the selected sponsored symposia.\n\nTrace metal concentrations in forest and lawn soils of Paris region (France) along a gradient of urban pressure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLudovic, Foti\n\n2017-04-01\n\nconcentrations and subsequent risks in soils of Paris and Paris region (Ãle-de-France). Our study aims at filling this knowledge gap, focusing on contamination and pollution by TMs in lawns and forests that constitute the main types of vegetation in urban areas of Paris region. Considering the rational described above, the aims of the present study were (i) to examine the concentration of eight selected TMs (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Zn) in soils of two land-uses (public lawns and woods) along an urban pressure gradient in Paris region, (ii) to distinguish origins and sources of contamination or pollution, (iii) to evaluate the individual and overall TM contamination degree as well as the individual and overall TM pollution degree, (iiii) to use soil characteristics to better understand soil origins and histories along the urban pressure gradient and the relationship between these characteristics and TM concentrations. Ultimately, this study provides a baseline TM assessment for the long-term monitoring of the evolution of TM soil contents in urban area of the Paris region.\n\nGHG monitoring over Paris megacity and OrlÃ©ans forest\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTe, Y. V.; Jeseck, P.; Zanon, T.; Boursier, C.; Janssen, C.; Deutscher, N. M.; Warneke, T.; Notholt, J.; Lac, C.; DieudonnÃ©, E.; Lopez, M.; Schmidt, M.; Xueref-remy, I. C.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nIn a growing world with more than 7 billion inhabitants and big emerging countries such as China, Brazil and India, emissions of anthropogenic pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs) are increasing continuously. Their monitoring and control in megacities have become a major challenge for scientists and public health authorities in environmental research area. The ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer (QualAir FTS[a], model IFS 125HR) of the QualAir platform located in downtown Paris at University Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), is a scientific research instrument dedicated to the survey of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and urban air quality. Equipped with a sun-tracker, the remote sensing QualAir FTS relies on solar infrared absorption for monitoring trace gas concentrations and their variability in the Ile-de-France region[b]. Concentrations of atmospheric GHGs, especially CO2, CH4 and N2O, are retrieved by the radiative transfer model PROFFIT[c]. Because Paris is the third largest European megacity, the QualAir FTS can provide new and complementary measurements as compared to existing ground-based FTS network stations (NDACC and TCCON) located in unpolluted environments, such as the TCCON-OrlÃ©ans station[d] situated in the forest of OrlÃ©ans (100 km south of Paris). In the effort to integrate QualAir FTS into the TCCON network, simultaneous FTS measurements of GHGs at Paris and OrlÃ©ans have been performed. We will emphasize on comparisons of CO2 from these two sites. Our comparison will be completed by high-resolved direct CO2 modeling outputs from the Meso-NH model, and ground in situ measurements at different sites (OrlÃ©ans/Trainou, Paris/Jussieu, Paris/Eiffel Tower). Parts of the data were acquired in the framework of the French CO2-MEGAPARIS project[e, f], whose main goal is to quantify CO2 emissions from the Paris area. The present data intercomparison will help to reduce uncertainties in carbon cycle models and to better characterize regional GHG fluxes\n\nDevelopment and Exploitation of Low Enthalpy Geothermal Systems, Example of \"The Dogger\" in the Paris Basin, France\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRojas, J.; Menjoz, A.; Martin, J.C.\n\n1987-01-20\n\nA feature of French geothermal engineering is the development of industrial projects in normal gradient, non-convective areas. The economic feasibility of exploiting wells producing between 150 and 350 m{sup 3}/h at temperatures from 55Â° to 85Â° from depths of 1,500 to 2,000 meters, in sedimentary basins with normal gradient, for direct heat production has been proved by 50 plants providing heating for over 500,000 people during the last few years. This opens new possibilities for geothermal energy development the world over, in particular for areas where heat consumption is higher than 2,500 Tons oil equivalent (Toe)/year over several square kilometers.moreÂ Â» The recent and rapid development of geothermal projects in France, in particular in the Paris Basin has provided much more information on the characteristics of the Jurassic Dogger, which is the unit tapped by geothermal doublets (one production and one injection well). Detailed study of the Dogger reservoir in the Paris Basin is one of the main objectives of the IMRG research and development program drawn up in 1983. The preliminary results presented here are oriented towards (1) improved knowledge of the potential geothermal resources, and (2) analysis of optimum development conditions. 1 tab., 7 refs., 9 figs.Â«Â less\n\nTrace element concentrations along a gradient of urban pressure in forest and lawn soils of the Paris region (France).\n\nPubMed\n\nFoti, Ludovic; Dubs, Florence; Gignoux, Jacques; Lata, Jean-Christophe; Lerch, Thomas Z; Mathieu, JÃ©rÃ´me; Nold, FranÃ§ois; Nunan, Naoise; Raynaud, Xavier; Abbadie, Luc; Barot, SÃ©bastien\n\n2017-11-15\n\nThe concentration, degree of contamination and pollution of 7 trace elements (TEs) along an urban pressure gradient were measured in 180 lawn and wood soils of the Paris region (France). Iron (Fe), a major element, was used as reference element. Copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were of anthropogenic origin, while arsenic (As), chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) were of natural origin. Road traffic was identified as the main source of anthropogenic TEs. In addition, the industrial activity of the Paris region, especially cement plants, was identified as secondary source of Cd. Soil characteristics (such as texture, organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (tot N) contents) tell the story of the soil origins and legacies along the urban pressure gradient and often can explain TE concentrations. The history of the land-use types was identified as a factor that allowed understanding the contamination and pollution by TEs. Urban wood soils were found to be more contaminated and polluted than urban lawns, probably because woods are much older than lawns and because of the legacy of the historical management of soils in the Paris region (Haussmann period). Lawn soils are similar to the fertile agricultural soils and relatively recently (mostly from the 1950s onwards) imported from the surrounding of Paris, so that they may be less influenced by urban conditions in terms of TE concentrations. Urban wood soils are heavily polluted by Cd, posing a high risk to the biological communities. The concentration of anthropogenic TEs increased from the rural to the urban areas, and the concentrations of most anthropogenic TEs in urban areas were equivalent to or above the regulatory reference values, raising the question of longer-term monitoring.

A thermokarst origin of the lakes is supported by abundant traces of ground ice, particularly ice wedge pseudomorphs beneath the lacustrine layers and synsedimentary deformation caused by thaw settlement. The features include brittle deformation (normal and reverse faults) resulting from ground subsidence owing to ice melting and ductile deformations caused by slumping of the sediments heaved by the growth of ice-cored mounds. These correspond to lithalsas (or lithalsa plateaus) and/or to open system pingos. At least two generations of thermokarst are recorded and may reflect the millennial climate variability typical of the Last Glacial. The structures studied in quarries are associated with an undulating topography visible in 5-m DEMs and a spotted pattern in aerial photographs. The search for similar patterns in the Paris Basin indicates that many other potential thermokarst sites exist in the Last Glacial terrace (Fy) of rivers located north of 48Â°N when they cross the lower Cretaceous sands and marls. In some sites, the presence of organic-poor, fine-grained deposits presumably of lacustrine origin was confirmed by borehole data. The site distribution coincides broadly with that already known for ice wedge pseudomorphs. This study provides new evidence of permafrost-induced ground deformations in France and strongly suggests that thermokarst played a significant and probably largely underestimated role in the genesis of Late Pleistocene landscapes.\n\nNew characterization aspects of carbonate accumulation horizons in Chalky Champagne (NE of the Paris Basin, France)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLinoir, Damien; Thomachot-Schneider, CÃ©line; Gommeaux, Maxime; Fronteau, Gilles; Barbin, Vincent\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe soil profiles of the Champagne area (NE of Paris Basin, France) occasionally show carbonate accumulation horizons (CAHs). From the top to the bottom, these soil profiles include a rendic leptosol horizon, a Quaternary cryoturbated paleosol (QCP), and a chalky substratum. The CAHs are located in the top part of the QCP. This study is aimed at highlighting the specific characteristics of CAHs compared to other soil profile horizons using geophysics, geochemistry, micromorphology, and mercury injection porosimetry. It is the first essential step for understanding the impact of CAHs on water transfers into the Champagne soil profiles. Our analyses show that Champagne CAHs are not systematically characterized by a typical induration unlike generally put forward in the regional literature. They are more porous and heterogeneous than their parent material (QCP). Carbonate accumulation horizons are also characterized by singular colorimetric parameters that are linked to their geochemical specific content, even if they bear a signature of the initial QCP before the pedogenic modification.\n\nOutreach in southern France\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJackson, D.\n\n1992-12-09\n\nFrance's Europort South community lives cheek by jowl with the chemical industry, with major complexes at For, Berre, and Lavera. Xavier Segond, technical adviser at the regional chemical industry association, Le Syndicat General des Industries Chimiques Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Corse (SGIC), says a good relationship has grown over a period of 20 years. Segond describes Arco Chimie as an effective driving force for the Responsible Care effort in the region - partly because its US parent introduced the program on a worldwide basis in 1989, ahead of national industry association Union des Industries Chimiques (UIC; Paris). Arco's F2-billion ($373 million)/year Fos-sur-MermoreÂ Â» site makes it a significant player. But in 1986 the company was a complete newcomer. We came to Fos as a US company, we had no Paris headquarters or French president, explains Dominique Lequeux, director/human resources. The community viewed the company with a mixture of curiosity and enthusiasm as a potential employer - about 330 people now work at the site. The day before the officials propylene oxide plant opening, we invited in local people, says Lequeux. That formed a good basis for its Responsible Care community outreach program. Now, schools, professional groups, and political groups make 20-25 plant visits each year.Â«Â less\n\nImpact of migration origin on individual protection strategies against sexual transmission of HIV in Paris metropolitan area, SIRS cohort study, France.\n\nPubMed\n\nKesteman, Thomas; Lapostolle, Annabelle; Costagliola, Dominique; Massari, VÃ©ronique; Chauvin, Pierre\n\n2015-08-20\n\nThe impact of migration and country or region of origin on sexual behaviours and prevention of the sexual transmission of HIV has been scarcely studied in France. The objective of this study was to evaluate if and how individual attitudes of prevention towards HIV infection are different according to country or region of origins in Paris area, France. 3006 individuals were interviewed in the Paris metropolitan area in 2010. Outcome variables were (i) the intention of the individual to protect oneself against HIV, and (ii) the adoption of a condom-based approach for protection against HIV. To explore factors associated with these outcomes, we constructed multivariate logistic regression models, first taking into account only demographic variables -including country of origin-, then successively adding socioeconomic variables and variables related to sexual behaviour and HIV perception and prevention behaviour. French and foreign people who have origins in Sub-Saharan Africa declared more intentions to protect themselves than French people with French parents (in foreign men, aORâ=â3.43 [1.66-7.13]; in foreign women, aORâ=â2.94 [1.65-5.23]), but did not declare more recourse to a condom-based approach for protection against HIV (in foreign men, aORâ=â1.38 [0.38-4.93]; in foreign women, aORâ=â0.93 [0.40-2.18]). Conversely, foreign women and French women from foreign origin, especially from Maghreb (Northern Africa), reported less intention of protection than French women with French parents. These results underline the importance of taking culture and origins of target populations into consideration when designing information, education and communication about HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. These results also draw attention to fractions of the general population that could escape from prevention messages.\n\nAnnoyance from light aircraft investigation carried out around four airports near Paris\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1980-01-01\n\nAn opinion survey was carried out on residents living near four airports in the Paris, France area.

The purpose of this study was to examine associations between perceived neighborhood safety and sleep health among a sample of MSM in Paris, France. We placed broadcast advertisements on a popular smartphone application for MSM in October 2016 to recruit users in the Paris (France) metropolitan area (nÂ =Â 580). Users were directed to complete a web-based survey, including previously used items measuring perceptions of neighborhood safety, validated measures of sleep health, and socio-demographics. Modified Poisson models were used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between perceived neighborhood safety and the following outcomes: (1) poor sleep quality, (2) short sleep duration, and (3) self-reported sleep problems. Poor sleep health was common in our sample; e.g., 30.1% reported poor sleep quality and 44.7% reported problems falling asleep. In multivariate regression models, perceived neighborhood safety was associated with poor sleep quality, short sleep duration, and having sleep problems. For example, reporting living in a neighborhood perceived as unsafe during the daytime (vs. safe) was associated with poor sleep quality (aRR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.01, 2.52), short sleep duration (aRR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.26, 2.94), problems falling asleep (aRR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.17, 2.11), and problems staying awake in the daytime (aRR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.05, 4.43). Interventions to increase neighborhood safety may improve sleep health among MSM.\n\nPreliminary report on AED deployment on the entire Air France commercial fleet: a joint venture with Paris XII University Training Programme.\n\nPubMed\n\nBertrand, C; Rodriguez Redington, P; Lecarpentier, E; Bellaiche, G; Michel, D; Teiger, E; Morris, W; Le Bourgeois, J P; Barthout, M\n\n2004-11-01\n\nThe positive effect of early defibrillation on survival from cardiac arrest has been demonstrated. We describe the use of AEDs over 1 year following the training of flight attendants. Air France and the University of Paris XII together designed a 1 year training programme for 14000 flight attendants. The university emergency departments (SAMU) provided 250 instructors. AEDs training and certification was conducted for crew members between November 2001 and November 2002. By January 2003, all aircraft were fully equipped with AEDs. All cases of cardiac arrest that occurred during the study were reviewed comprehensively. Comments from the crew were collected. Twelve cardiac arrests were reported between November 2002 and November 2003 out of 4194 cases of emergency care delivered to passengers. Shock treatment was advised initially in 5/12 cases. The survival rate after in-flight cardiac arrest was 3/12. The survival rate at discharge from hospital following in flight shock was 2/5. No complications arose from the use of AEDs. Training by professionals gave the flight attendants confidence and allowed for the survival of two young passengers. Our study highlights the ability of flight attendants to give better onboard care for the future. The next step is to consolidate the network between in-flight care and the medical dispatch centre in Paris.\n\nTesting blood donors for Chagas disease in the Paris area, France: first results after 18 months of screening.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl Ghouzzi, Marie-HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Boiret, Elisabeth; Wind, FranÃ§oise; Brochard, Claudine; Fittere, SÃ©bastien; Paris, Luc; Mazier, Dominique; Sansonetti, Nicole; Bierling, Philippe\n\n2010-03-01\n\nChagas disease is endemic in Latin America (LA). Currently 10 million people are infected despite World Health Organization efforts aimed at preventing domestic transmission. However, with the migration of infected asymptomatic individuals to nonendemic countries, transmission of Chagas disease by transfusion may become a worldwide problem. The observation that the number of cases of Chagas disease has increased over the past 10 years in French Guiana, together with the results of a previous hospital-based study in the Paris area, confirms the transmission of Chagas disease from patients coming from LA. For these reasons, the French authorities stopped the collection of blood in French Guiana in 2005 and began screening blood donors in the French Caribbean islands and, in 2007, in continental France. Data on birth place, mother's birth place, and travel in LA were recorded for at-risk donors. These subjects were tested using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Of the 312,458 individuals who gave blood in the Paris area during an 18-month period, 30,837 were tested. Of these, 972 were born in LA, three of whom were positive for the two ELISAs and immunofluorescence tests. The prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi-positive donors was 9.7 in 100,000 tested donors, but 0.31% among donors born in LA. Serology tests gave discrepant results in 1.02% of the samples. The efficiency of blood donor screening programs could be improved by screening only blood donors who were born in LA or who have traveled in LA for extended periods, using a single enzyme immunoassay.\n\nFrance and the Rif War: Lessons from a Forgotten Counterinsurgency War (Northern Morocco - April 1925 - May 1927)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2010-04-07\n\nthe fighting: the then captains Alphonse Juin, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and Lieutenant Philippe de Hautecloque.

The cohort investigated in this study consisted of 830 male members of the Brigade des sapeurs-pompiers de Paris (BSPP). These professional had served for a minimum of 5 years on 1 January 1977. They were monitored for a 14 year period, finishing 1 January 1991. When compared to the average French male, the Paris fire-fighters were found to have a far lower overall mortality (SMR = 0.52 [0.35-0.75]). None of the cause specific SMRs were significantly different from unity. However a greater number of deaths than expected was observed for genito-urinary cancer (SMR = 3.29), digestive cancer (SMR = 1.14), respiratory cancer (SMR = 1.12) and 'cerebrovascular disease' (SMR = 1.16). The low overall SMR observed was consistent with the healthy worker effect. As for cause specific SMRs, they will be confirmed or invalidated by a further analysis as the follow-up of this cohort is being carried on.\n\nEuropean and Americas Committees for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS/ACTRIMS) - 7th Joint Triennial Congress (October 25-28, 2017 - Paris, France).\n\nPubMed\n\nDÃ­az, N\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe 7th Triennial Joint conference of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) and Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) was held in Paris, France. The meeting brought together attendees from a wide range of disciplines involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) research to explore an extensive program of teaching courses, plenary lectures, oral and poster sessions from approximately 2,000 abstracts submitted, and hot topic and young investigator presentations. These presentations covered topics including diagnostics, therapeutics and biomarkers, as well as a special section for MS nurses. Industry-sponsored symposia were also held. The report from this conference covers the latest developments in MS treatments.\n\nUndergraduate education in endodontology at two European dental schools. A comparison between the Faculty of Odontology, MalmÃ¶ University, MalmÃ¶, Sweden and Faculty of Odontology, Paris 5 University (RenÃ© Descartes), France.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetersson, Kerstin; Olsson, Helena; SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m, Christina; Fouilloux, Isabelle; Jegat, NadÃ¨ge; LÃ©vy, GÃ©rard\n\n2002-11-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the courses in endodontics and to assess the treatment quality in the student clinics in two dental schools, in MalmÃ¶, Sweden and Paris, France. A further aim was to improve the curriculum development in Paris 5 and MalmÃ¶ by testing student exchange programmes. The comparison was based on the guidelines for undergraduate education set up by the European Society of Endodontology (ESE) [Int. Endod. J. 25 (1992) 169] and on the criteria formulated by Qualtrough and Dummer [Int. Endod. J. 30 (1997) 234]. The latter criteria covered the following aspects: educational methods, the timing of endodontic teaching, pre-clinical practical exercises, student assessment, recommended literature, clinical/practical procedures, the education of the staff and number of students per teacher. The quality guidelines for endodontic treatment set up by the ESE [Int. Endod. J. 27 (1994) 115] were used for the assessment of the quality of the treatment. The following aspects were covered: history, diagnosis and treatment planning, records, infection control, root-canal treatment, assessment of endodontic treatment. The undergraduate education in endodontics was fundamentally similar in Paris 5 and MalmÃ¶. The main differences observed were related to: Educational methods: In MalmÃ¶, problem-based learning and in Paris 5, traditional. Assessment of student performance. In MalmÃ¶, self-assessment and in Paris 5, credits for clinical/practical procedures. Clinical/practical procedures relating to infection control. Aseptic treatment regimens were more meticulously performed in MalmÃ¶ than in Paris 5. Assessment (follow-up) of all endodontic treatments was a routine only in MalmÃ¶.\n\nCirculation of Pneumocystis dihydropteroate synthase mutants in France.\n\nPubMed\n\nLe Gal, SolÃ¨ne; Damiani, CÃ©line; Perrot, MaÃ«la; RouillÃ©, AmÃ©lie; Virmaux, MichÃ¨le; Quinio, DorothÃ©e; Moalic, Elodie; Saliou, Philippe; Berthou, Christian; Le Meur, Yann; Totet, Anne; Nevez, Gilles\n\n2012-10-01\n\nData on the prevalence of Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii) dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) mutants in France are still limited. In this study, mutant prevalence in the Brest region (western France) was determined. Archival pulmonary specimens from 85 patients infected with P. jirovecii and admitted to our institution (University Hospital, Brest) from October 2007 to February 2010 were retrospectively typed at the DHPS locus using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Type identification was successful in 66 of 85 patients. Sixty-four patients were infected with a wild type, whereas mutants were found in 2 patients (2/66, 3%). Medical chart analysis revealed that these 2 patients usually lived in Paris. Another patient usually lived on the French Riviera, whereas 63 patients were from the city of Brest. Thus, the corrected prevalence of mutants in patients who effectively lived in our geographic area was 0% (0/63). Taking into account that i) Paris is characterized by a high prevalence of mutants from 18.5% to 40%, ii) infection diagnoses were performed in the 2 Parisians during their vacation <30 days, iii) infection incubation is assumed to last about 2 months, the results provide evidence of mutant circulation from Paris to Brest through infected vacationers. The study shows that the usual city of patient residence, rather than the city of infection diagnosis, is a predictor of mutants and that P. jirovecii infections involving mutants do not represent a public health issue in western France.

In France, synthetic cathinones emerged in 2008 (while first mentioned by the French police force in 2007Â first alerts among users appeared in 2008) and have grown to be popular drugs of abuse. Under the Official Journal dated 11thÂ JuneÂ 2010, only mephedrone has been listed as narcotics but \"designer drugs\" have synthesized new substitute cathinones in order to avoid anti-drug laws. However, since JulyÂ 2012, in France, all synthetic drugs from the cathinones family have been banned and listed as narcotics following the example of United Kingdom. Despite their recent classification and inclusion on narcotic list, they are readily available on Internet and used widely. Paris Addictovigilance Centre observed a signal of derivate cathinones abuse (21Â cases over a two-year period). Paris Addictovigilance Centre and Marmottan Hospital wanted to describe the use of cathinones in the Paris area and alert the health care community about the abuse identification and risk assessment problems of these compounds. After a review of derivated cathinone's chemical structure, pharmacology and toxicology, this article seeks to provide patricians with a clinical description and treatment's modality. Most users of synthetic cathinones will experience euphoria, increased energy, talkativeness, openness and increased sexual arousal. Signs and symptoms of toxicity are consistent with a sympathomimetic toxidrome. The main reasons for care access are psychiatric (hallucinations, psychotic symptoms, agitation) and addiction disorders. Somatic complications were described with various patterns of symptoms such as headache, tachycardia, confusional states, rhabdomyolysis with renal failure or serotonin syndrome. The most important fact is the apparition of the \"slam\" phenomenon among men who have sex with men\n\n[History of the JournÃ©es Dermatologiques de Paris].\n\nPubMed\n\nTilles, G\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFounded in 1801 at the HÃ´pital Saint-Louis, Paris, under Jean-Louis Alibert, the French School of Dermatology was initially structured around the French Society of Dermatology (1889) and the organization of two world congresses (Paris 1889, 1900). After World War I, the creation of dermatological societies in the provinces infused French dermatology with new energy. In 1922, the first congress of the French-speaking dermatologists further contributed to the public profile of dermatologists in France. The \"JournÃ©es de Mars\" were initiated in 1961 at the HÃ´pital Saint-Louis, and in 1975 they went on to become the \"JournÃ©es dermatologiques de Paris\". Pr. Jean Civatte played a key role in their creation and in their organization for 30 years. After 1979, since actual patients could no longer be presented, the organizers of the congress had to change the content of the meeting from clinical presentations to post-graduate teaching and clinical research. From its origins in the form of meetings of French dermatologists in an intimate setting at the HÃ´pital Saint-Louis, the \"JournÃ©es dermatologiques de Paris\" grew within the ensuing decades into a major scientific event of the French-speaking dermatological community, bringing together more than 4000 participants in December each year.

The first informations concerning this topic reached England in late fall of 1846 and after that came to France and especially Paris. The German physician Aloys Martin from Munich who was living in Paris at that time was largely responsible for conveying the news about these new findings in medical science to the German-speaking nations. Controversial discussions concerning the anaesthetic properties of ether developed among the members of various scientific circles right after the news from America had reached the city--and many members of the \"Verein Deutscher Aerzte in Paris\" (Association of German Physicians in Paris) took part in them, Martin then was one of the club's most active members and repeatedly reported on the new method as a correspondent for the widely read \"Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung\": Documents discovered recently at the archives of the \"Leopoldinisch-Carolinischen Akademie\" of Halle provide an interesting insight into this association, whose members tried to find out more about the anaesthetic properties and side effects of ether carrying out a series of well appreciated self-experiments in the spring of 1847. The following text reports on the history of the \"Verein Deutscher Aerzte in Paris\" which has largely fallen into oblivion and emphasizes the importance of Aloys Martin whose name is strongly attached to the spread of the use of ether throughout the German-speaking countries.\n\nAn EMPA investigation of the redox state of natural glasses from mantle xenoliths and mantle-derived boninitic magmas.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFialin, Michel; Wagner, Christiane; Ohnenstetter, Daniel\n\n2010-05-01\n\nAn EMPA investigation of the redox state of natural glasses from mantle xenoliths and mantle-derived boninitic magmas.

The determination of the oxidation state of iron is based on the measure of the self-absorption induced shift of the emitted Fe L peak [1, 2, 3]. This method is well suited for the study of glassy phases of few tens of squared micrometers disseminated in a mineral matrix. It can be operated on common petrographic thin sections and, thus, it can be easily coupled with conventional chemical analyses by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). This latter point is essential because the total Fe content of the glass must be precisely measured by EPMA to scale the corresponding Fe-L ï peak position relative to the calibration curves giving the Fe3+/SFe ratios. The samples studied are spinel lherzolite from the French Massif Central, and low Ca type 1 boninites from dykes cutting serpentinized peridotite at NÃ©poui, New Caledonia. Glass occurs commonly in mantle xenoliths as small (<10 micrometers) patches in reactional rims but its origin remains controversy and has been interpreted in relation to mantle processes or to interactions with the xenolith host magma. We have previously demonstrated that these xenoliths have been metasomatized, and that the glasses are reaction products between mantle phases and migrating melts [3, 4]. The consensus emerging from different studies is that metasomatism is oxidizing relative to both primitive\n\nUrban dew and rain in Paris, France: Occurrence and physico-chemical characteristics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBeysens, D.; Mongruel, A.; Acker, K.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThis paper summarizes one year (April 2011 to March 2012) measurements on planar condensing surfaces of dew and rain events and related physico-chemical characteristics in the urban environment of Paris (city center). Yearly collected water was 3.48 mm for dew (63 events) and 593 mm for rain (146 events). The latter value compares well with rain data (547 mm and 107 events) collected within 12 km at Paris-Orly airport. An estimation of dew yield based on meteo data gives 2.35 mm and 74 events, to be compared with 17.11 mm and 196 events at Paris-Orly. These differences highlight the large reduction in dew events and dew yields in an urban area as compared to a close rural-like area. This reduction is not due to a sky view reduction but to heat island that increases air temperature and decreases relative humidity. Analysis of dew (34) and rain (77) samples were done concerning pH, electrical conductivity (EC), major anions and cations as well as selected trace metals and other minor ions. Mean pH values are found similar for both, dew (6.5) and rain (6.1), rain being slightly more acidic than dew. The mean dew total ionic content (TIC 1.8 meq/l) and EC value (124 Î¼S/cm) are about four times that of rain (0.45 meq/l; 35 Î¼S/cm), meaning that total dissolved solids in dew is nearly four times that in rain. Sulfate and nitrate are the most acidifying components, calcium the most neutralizing constituent with ratio of mean total acidity/total alkalinity comparable for dew and rain ( 0.9). Sulfate and nitrate have mainly anthropogenic sources, whereas chloride and magnesium are mostly connected with marine air masses. Dew is a considerable factor of wet deposition of pollutants; dew and rain ion concentrations, however, meet the WHO requirements for drinking water.\n\nMolecular Fingerprinting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Risk Factors for Tuberculosis Transmission in Paris, France, and Surrounding Area\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGutiÃ©rrez, M. C.; Vincent, V.; Aubert, D.; Bizet, J.; Gaillot, O.; Lebrun, L.; Le Pendeven, C.; Le Pennec, M. P.; Mathieu, D.; Offredo, C.; Pangon, B.; Pierre-Audigier, C.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nForty-three percent of the tuberculosis cases reported in France are from the Ile de France region. The incidence of tuberculosis in this region is 33 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, twice the national average. A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed with clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated during 1995 in 10 hospitals in Paris and surrounding areas to detect tuberculosis transmission and define the factors associated with clustering in this population. The molecular markers used were the insertion sequence IS6110 and the direct repeat (DR) sequence. Social, demographic, and clinical data were collected from the patientsâ medical files. Ten patients with isolates with a single copy of IS6110 were excluded from further analysis. Twenty-four patients with false-positive cultures due to laboratory contamination (based on RFLP analysis with IS6110 and examination of patient data) were also excluded. The study was then conducted with 272 strains isolated from 272 patients. Further fingerprinting was performed by using the DR element with strains with patterns by RFLP analysis with IS6110 that differed by one band only and strains with identical patterns by RFLP analysis with IS6110 and with low numbers of copies of IS6110. The combined use of both markers identified unique patterns for 177 strains and clustered 95 (35.7%) strains in 26 groups, each containing isolates from 2 to 12 patients. The clustering was strongly associated with homelessness and the male sex. It was not associated with age, birth in a foreign country, human immunodeficiency virus positivity, or residence in hostels or prison. Isolates from homeless people were often included in large clusters, and homeless people could be the source of tuberculosis transmission for more than 50% of the clustered patients. These results suggest that homeless people play a key role in the spread of M. tuberculosis in the community and that poor socioeconomic\n\n[Medical humanism at the FacultÃ© de mÃ©decine de Paris: one hundred years of history (1795-1898)].\n\nPubMed\n\nLellouch, A\n\n1999-06-01\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, tumultuous relationships existed between the public authorities, the Paris Medical Faculty, its students and teachers, the medical and the popular press.

Now, in its seventh year, the aims of the WIN consortium's annual meeting, to foster communication and collaboration between members and deliver clinical trial results that improve the care and outcomes of patients are presented in open dialogue to encourage debate and discussion. This year, the meeting was held in Paris, France from 26-27 June and consisted of six plenary sessions, two debates, and poster presentations from attendees. In keeping with the consortium's goals, presentations and posters focused on the development and integration of new therapies and updates in genome-based medicine. Among the presentations at this year's meeting, much of the focus fell on design and implementation of new designs of clinical trials, moving away from decades-long assessments of thousands of patients towards a nimble, adaptive design fitting the edicts of personalised medicine and delving into greater depths within genomic data, ranging beyond genome analysis to chart new targets in ligandomics, proteogenomics and more.\n\nThe Fate of Polyol-Made ZnO and CdS Nanoparticles in Seine River Water (Paris, France).\n\nPubMed\n\nda Rocha, Alice; Sivry, Yann; Gelabert, Alexandre; Beji, Zyed; Benedetti, Marc F; Menguy, Nicolas; Brayner, Roberta\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThis study aims to characterize nanoparticles with different compositions and structures as well as seeing their evolutions over time in a natural environment such as Seine river water (Paris, France). Face centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal (hcp) CdS as well as hexagonal (hcp) ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by the Polyol method. CdS nanoparticles (i) cfc structure: are agglomerated, present 100 nm length with heterogeneous diameter and 10 m2 g(-1) specific surface area (S(g)) from Brunauer Emett and Teller (BET) measurements; (ii) hcp structure: 20 nm and S(g) = 67 m2 g(-1). ZnO hcp nanoparticles presents 50 nm length and 15 nm diameter and S(g) = 54 m2 g(-1). These results are in agreement with X-ray diffraction (XRD), and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXs). After 48 h interaction with Seine river water, cryo-TEM analysis showed that ZnO nanoparticles form spherical agglomerates with 300 nm diameter; CdS nanoparticles (fcc) are agglomerated presenting large diameters (> 500 nm); and CdS nanoparticles (hcp) are not agglomerated and present the same characteristics of the starting material. After 168h of contact with Seine river water, CdS (fcc) presents only 14% of dissolution, CdS (hcp) presents both 60% dissolution and 30% reprecipitation in a cadmium carbonate form and finally almost 90% of ZnO nanoparticles are dissolved.\n\n[Defusing of victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris.

Medico-psychological unit (CUMP) of the Paris Ãle-de-France region's immediate care services were immediately mobilized and rapidly strengthened by all regional medico-psychological units (CUMP) throughout the country. Psychological assistance has been provided in several key points of Paris and specifically in the 11th district City Hall of Paris where Lyon's Medico-psychological unit was located. These specific immediate psychological assistances, referred to as a \"defusing process\" by the medico-psychological unit (CUMP), are mostly devoted to provide the victims with an entry point to a psychological healthcare relationship and give them a first sense of soothing and relief even though they do not prevent further psychological care follow up for the victims. Nonetheless, the potential therapeutic effect of this \"defusing process\" has not yet been sufficiently established nor demonstrated by any scientific study. A phoning survey was carried out one-month post-terrorist attacks and interviewed the 129 victims who benefited from the \"defusing process\" conducted by Lyon's medico-psychological unit (CUMP) in order to collect data and assess its effects. These people, whether directly exposed, bereaved relatives or witnesses, whose average age is 35, are mostly living in the Ãle-de-France region. Most of them present a high score on the IES-R scale, whether they were directly exposed, bereaved relatives or witnesses. Almost all of them (96.5%) experienced at least one medical care contact within this one-month post-trauma period with psychotropic medication for 37% of them. Regarding the defusing conducted by Lyon's medico-psychological unit (CUMP) in the 11th district City Hall of Paris, it appears that 93% of the victims who were looked after indicated that they were satisfied and 87.4% of\n\nUrbanization impact on sulfur content of groundwater revealed by the study of urban speleothem-like deposits: Case study in Paris, France.\n\nPubMed\n\nPons-Branchu, E; Roy-Barman, M; Jean-Soro, L; Guillerme, A; Branchu, P; Fernandez, M; Dumont, E; Douville, E; Michelot, J L; Phillips, A M\n\n2017-02-01\n\nSpeleothem-like deposits that develop underground in urban areas are an archive of the environmental impact of anthropic activities that has been little studied so far. In this paper, the sulfate content in shallow groundwater from northern Paris (France) is compared with the sulfur content in two 300-year-old urban carbonate deposits that grew in a historical underground aqueduct. The present-day waters of the aqueduct have very high sulfur and calcium contents, suggesting pollution from gypsum dissolution. However, geological gypsum levels are located below the water table. Sulfur content was measured by micro-X-ray fluorescence in these very S-rich carbonate deposits (0.5 to 1% of S). A twofold S increase during the second half of the 1800s was found in both samples. These dates correspond to two major periods of urbanization above the site. We discus three possible S sources: anthropic sources (industries, fertilizersâ¦), volcanic eruptions and input within the water through gypsum brought for urbanization above the studied site (backfill with quarry waste) since the middle of the 19th century. For the younger second half of the studied section, S input from gypsum brought during urbanization was confirmed by the study of isotopic sulfur composition (Î´ 34 S=+15.2â° at the top). For the oldest part, several sulfur peaks could be related to early industrial activity in Paris, that caused high local air pollution, as reported in historical archives but also to historical gypsum extraction. This study provides information on the origin and timing of the very high SO 4 2- levels measured nowadays within the shallow groundwater, thus demonstrating the interest in using carbonate deposits in urban areas as a proxy for the history of urbanization or human activities and their impact on water bodies.

In order to evaluate the quality of their response to this challenge, a retrospective survey based on a self-administered standardized questionnaire was undertaken among the 18 hospital laboratories involved in A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detection over a period of 10 months from April 2009 to January 2010. All concerned laboratories responded to the survey. Due to imposed initial biosafety constraints and indications, virological diagnosis was performed in only two laboratories at the start of the studied period. Step by step, it was further settled in the other laboratories starting from June to November 2009. From the beginning, A(H1N1)pdm09-specific RT-PCR was considered the reference method while the use of rapid influenza detection tests remained temporary and concerned a minority of these laboratories. Among the overall 21,656 specimens received, a positive diagnosis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was obtained in 5,390 cases (25%), the positivity range being significantly higher among women as compared to men (P<0.0001) and subjects below 45 years of age as compared to those over 65 years (P<0.0001). Two peaks in positivity frequency were observed at weeks 24 (30%, 8-12 June 2009) and 44 (50%, 26-30 October 2009) respectively, the latter one occurring 2 weeks earlier than the peak of epidemic at the national level. In contrast, a low positivity rate was detected at weeks 38-40 in relationship with other respiratory virus infections which were clinically misinterpreted as a peak of influenza epidemic. These data demonstrate the ability of medical virology laboratories of Paris Ãle-de-France region to provide in real time a valuable diagnosis of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection and a relevant view of outbreak evolution, suggesting they will be a crucial component in the management of future influenza epidemics.

The total suspended particulate matter (TSP) was collected continuously on quartz fibre filters. The TSP contents were determined for 36 elements (including Ag, Bi, Mo and Sb) using two analytical methods: Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The measured concentrations were in agreement within the uncertainties with the certified values for the polycarbonate reference material filter SRM-2783 (National Institute for Standard Technology NIST, USA). The measured concentrations were significantly lower than the recommended atmospheric concentrations. In 2003, the Pb atmospheric level at Saclay was 15 ng/m 3, compared to the 500 ng/m 3 guideline level and to the 200 ng/m 3 observed value in 1994. The typical urban background TSP values of 1-2, 0.2-1, 4-6, 10-30 and 3-5 ng/m 3 for As, Co, Cr, Cu and Sb, respectively, were inferred from this study and were compared with the literature data. The typical urban background TSP concentrations could not be realised for Cd, Pb and Zn, since these air concentrations are highly influenced by local features. The Zn concentrations and Zn/Pb ratio observed in Saclay represented a characteristic fingerprint of the exceptionally large extent of zinc-made roofs in Paris and its suburbs. The traffic-related origin of Ba, Cr, Cu, Pb and Sb was demonstrated, while the atmospheric source(s) of Ag was not identified.\n\nFrench Ministry of Health's response to Paris attacks of 13 November 2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nPhilippe, Jean-Marc; Brahic, Olivier; Carli, Pierre; Tourtier, Jean-Pierre; Riou, Bruno; Vallet, Benoit\n\n2016-04-01\n\nOn Friday November 13th at 9:20 pm, three kamikaze bombs went off around the Stade de France a stadium in Saint-Denis just outside Paris, 4 different shootings took place and bombings in Paris and hundreds of people were held hostage in a theater.This multi-site terrorist attack was the first of this magnitude in France. Drawing the lessons of these attacks and those which occurred in other countries from a health perspective is essential to continuously adapt and improve the French response to possible future attacks. Several issues would need to be further explored: Management of uncertainties: When to trigger the plans: after the 1st attack, the 2nd? When do attacks end and when to release mobilized resources? Management of victims: How to ensure that all victims are secured or taken care of? How to provide assistance when attacks are ongoing? Management of teams: Proper follow-up of persons involved in the response: health professionals, police and firemen, emergency call centers but also civil servants within administration that contributed to the response. Communication: Reactivity of all is a key element to secure appropriate resource is mobilized for the response. All actors have to be able to communicate quickly in a secured way.\n\nGas Geochemistry of the Dogger Geothermal Aquifer (Paris Basin, France)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCriaud, A.; Fouillac, C.; Marty, B.\n\n1987-01-20\n\nThe low enthalpy program developed in the Paris Basin provides the opportunity for studying the gas geochemistry of the calcareous aquifer of the Dogger. Hydrocarbons and CO{sub 2} are mainly biogenic, He displays high concentrations. He, Ar and N{sub 2} have multiple origins (radioactive decay, atmospheric migration, biochemical processes). The distribution of the gases in the zones of the basin varies in relation to the general chemistry, sedimentology and hydrodynamics. The gas geothermometers do not apply to this environment but useful estimations of the redox potential of the fluid can be derived from CO{sub 2}/CH{sub 4} and N{sub 2}/NH{sub 4}{supmoreÂ Â» +} ratios. H{sub 2} and H{sub 2}S are involved in corrosion processes and scaling in the pipes. 12 refs., 3 figs., 2 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nAtypical aetiology of a conjugal fever: autochthonous airport malaria between Paris and French Riviera: a case report\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPomares-Estran, Christelle; Delaunay, Pascal; Mottard, Annie; Cua, Eric; Roger, Pierre-Marie; Pradines, Bruno; Parzy, Daniel; Bogreau, HervÃ©; Rogier, Christophe; Jeannin, Charles; Karch, SaÃ¯d; Fontenille, Didier; Dejour-Salamanca, Dominique; Legros, Fabrice; Marty, Pierre\n\n2009-01-01\n\nEndemic malaria has been eradicated from France, but some falciparum malaria cases have been described in patients who have never travelled outside the country. Ms. V. 21 year-old and Mr. M. 23 year-old living together in Paris were on holiday in Saint RaphaÃ«l (French Riviera). They presented with fever, vertigo and nausea. A blood smear made to control thrombocytopaenia revealed intra-erythrocytic forms of Plasmodium falciparum. The parasitaemia level was 0.15% for Ms. V and 3.2% for Mr. M. This couple had no history of blood transfusion or intravenous drug use. They had never travelled outside metropolitan France, but had recently travelled around France: to Saint Mard (close to Paris Charles de Gaulle (CdG) airport), to Barneville plage (in Normandy) and finally to Saint RaphaÃ«l. The most probable hypothesis is an infection transmitted in Saint Mard by an imported anopheline mosquito at CdG airport. The DNA analysis of parasites from Ms. V.'s and Mr. M.'s blood revealed identical genotypes. Because it is unlikely that two different anopheline mosquitoes would be infecte"
