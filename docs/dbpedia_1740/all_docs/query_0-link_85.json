Modelled power plant plume rise that considers surface and elevated temperature inversions improves results compared to observations. Modelled near-surface concentrations are improved by representation of vertical mixing and emission estimates. Large increases in diesel vehicle emissions at temperatures reaching -35 °C are required to reproduce observed NOx.\n\nExtension, development, and evaluation of the representation of the OH-initiated dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation mechanism in the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) v3.3.1 framework\n\nLorrie Simone Denise Jacob, Chiara Giorio, and Alexander Thomas Archibald\n\nAtmos.

Here we synthesise a number of recent studies to further develop and extend a state-of-the-art mechanism. Our new mechanism is shown to outperform all existing mechanisms when compared over a wide set of conditions. The development of an improved DMS mechanism will help lead the way to better the understanding the climate impacts of DMS emissions in past, present, and future atmospheric conditions.\n\nSignificant Influence of UV-vis Irradiation on Cloud Activation Efficiencies of Ammonium Sulfate Aerosols under Simulated Chamber Conditions\n\nAnil Kumar Mandariya, Junteng Wu, Anne Monod, Paola Formenti, BÃ©nÃ©dicte Picquet-Varrault, Mathieu Cazaunau, Stephan Mertes, Laurent Poulain, Antonin Berge, Edouard Pangui, Andreas Tilgner, Thomas Schaefer, Liang Wen, Hartmut Herrmann, and Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin\n\nAtmos.

The irradiated clouds clearly showed a gradual activation of seed particles into droplets. In contrast, non-irradiated clouds faced a flash activation. This paper will lay the foundation for multiphase photochemical studies implying water-soluble volatile organic compounds and particulate matter formation during cloud formation-evaporation cycles.\n\nSecondary organic aerosol formed by Euro 5 gasoline vehicle emissions: chemical composition and gas-to-particle phase partitioning\n\nEvangelia Kostenidou, Baptiste Marques, Brice Temime-Roussel, Yao Liu, Boris Vansevenant, Karine Sartelet, and Barbara D'Anna\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2705–2729, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2705-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2705-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSecondary organic aerosol (SOA) from gasoline vehicles can be a significant source of particulate matter in urban areas. Here the chemical composition of secondary volatile organic compounds and SOA produced by photo-oxidation of Euro 5 gasoline vehicle emissions was studied. The volatility of the SOA formed was calculated. Except for the temperature and the concentration of the aerosol, additional parameters may play a role in the gas-to-particle partitioning.\n\nGasâparticle partitioning of toluene oxidation products: an experimental and modeling study\n\nVictor Lannuque, Barbara D'Anna, Evangelia Kostenidou, Florian Couvidat, Alvaro Martinez-Valiente, Philipp Eichler, Armin Wisthaler, Markus MÃ¼ller, Brice Temime-Roussel, Richard Valorso, and Karine Sartelet\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15537–15560, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15537-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15537-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge uncertainties remain in understanding secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from toluene oxidation. In this study, speciation measurements in gaseous and particulate phases were carried out, providing partitioning and volatility data on individual toluene SOA components at different temperatures. A new detailed oxidation mechanism was developed to improve modeled speciation, and effects of different processes involved in gas–particle partitioning at the molecular scale are explored.\n\nDirect formation of HONO through aqueous-phase photolysis of organic nitrates\n\nJuan Miguel GonzÃ¡lez-SÃ¡nchez, Miquel Huix-Rotllant, Nicolas Brun, Julien Morin, Carine Demelas, Amandine Durand, Sylvain Ravier, Jean-Louis ClÃ©ment, and Anne Monod\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15135–15147, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15135-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15135-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOrganic nitrates play a crucial role in air pollution, as they are nitrogen oxide (NOx) reservoirs. This work investigated the reaction products and mechanisms of their reactivity with light in the aqueous phase (cloud and fog conditions and wet aerosol). Our findings reveal that this chemistry leads to the formation of atmospheric nitrous acid (HONO).\n\nOptimized procedure for the determination of alkylamines in airborne particulate matter of anthropized areas\n\nDavide Spolaor, Lidia SoldÃ , Gianni Formenton, Marco Roverso, Denis Badocco, Sara Bogialli, Fazel A. Monikh, and Andrea Tapparo\n\nAerosol Research, 1, 29–38, https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-1-29-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-1-29-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn remote environments, atmospheric amines are involved in new particle formation processes. In anthropized areas, they readily react to form secondary aerosol. These particles may have relevant environmental (climate) and health effects. Together with instrumental techniques for the on-line determination of these compounds (PTR-MS, AMS), the development of simple methods for their accurate quantification represents a scientific target aimed at by obtaining more significant environmental data.\n\nAerosol optical depth climatology from the high-resolution MAIAC product over Europe: differences between major European cities and their surrounding environments\n\nLudovico Di Antonio, Claudia Di Biagio, Gilles Foret, Paola Formenti, Guillaume Siour, Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin, and Matthias Beekmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 12455–12475, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12455-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12455-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLong-term (2000–2021) 1 km resolution satellite data have been used to investigate the climatological aerosol optical depth (AOD) variability and trends at different scales in Europe. Average enhancements of the local-to-regional AOD ratio at 550 nm of 57 %, 55 %, 39 % and 32 % are found for large metropolitan areas such as Barcelona, Lisbon, Paris and Athens, respectively, suggesting a non-negligible enhancement of the aerosol burden through local emissions.\n\nComplex refractive index and single scattering albedo of Icelandic dust in the shortwave part of the spectrum\n\nClarissa Baldo, Paola Formenti, Claudia Di Biagio, Gongda Lu, Congbo Song, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Jean-Francois Doussin, Pavla Dagsson-Waldhauserova, Olafur Arnalds, David Beddows, A. Robert MacKenzie, and Zongbo Shi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7975–8000, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7975-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7975-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents new shortwave spectral complex refractive index and single scattering albedo data for Icelandic dust. Our results show that the imaginary part of the complex refractive index of Icelandic dust is at the upper end of the range of low-latitude dust. Furthermore, we observed that Icelandic dust is more absorbing towards the near-infrared, which we attribute to its high magnetite content. These findings are important for modeling dust aerosol radiative effects in the Arctic.\n\nOn the importance of multiphase photolysis of organic nitrates on their global atmospheric removal\n\nJuan Miguel GonzÃ¡lez-SÃ¡nchez, Nicolas Brun, Junteng Wu, Sylvain Ravier, Jean-Louis ClÃ©ment, and Anne Monod\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5851–5866, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5851-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5851-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOrganic nitrates play a crucial role in air pollution, as they are NOx reservoirs. This work investigated for the first time their reactivity with light in the aqueous phase (cloud and fog and wet aerosol), proving it slower than in the gas phase. Therefore, our findings reveal that partitioning of organic nitrates in the aqueous phase leads to longer atmospheric lifetimes of these compounds and thus a broader spatial distribution of their related pollution.\n\nSubstantial organic impurities at the surface of synthetic ammonium sulfate particles\n\nJunteng Wu, Nicolas Brun, Juan Miguel GonzÃ¡lez-SÃ¡nchez, Badr R'Mili, Brice Temime Roussel, Sylvain Ravier, Jean-Louis ClÃ©ment, and Anne Monod\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 3859–3874, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-3859-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-3859-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work quantified and tentatively identified the organic impurities on ammonium sulfate aerosols generated in the laboratory. They are likely low volatile and high mass molecules containing oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. Our results show that these organic impurities likely originate from the commercial AS crystals. It is recommended to use AS seeds with caution, especially when small particles are used, in terms of AS purity and water purity when aqueous solutions are used for atomization.\n\nAn experimental study of the reactivity of terpinolene and Î²-caryophyllene with the nitrate radical\n\nAxel Fouqueau, Manuela Cirtog, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin, and BÃ©nÃ©dicte Picquet-Varrault\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The purpose of this study is to furnish kinetic and mechanistic data for terpinolene and β-caryophyllene, using simulation chamber experiments. Rate constants have been measured using both relative and absolute methods, and mechanistic studies have been conducted in order to identify and quantify the main reaction products.\n\nWet deposition in the remote western and central Mediterranean as a source of trace metals to surface seawater\n\nKarine Desboeufs, Franck Fu, Matthieu Bressac, Antonio Tovar-SÃ¡nchez, Sylvain Triquet, Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin, Chiara Giorio, Patrick Chazette, Julie Disnaquet, AnaÃ¯s Feron, Paola Formenti, Franck Maisonneuve, Araceli RodrÃ­guez-Romero, Pascal Zapf, FranÃ§ois Dulac, and CÃ©cile Guieu\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Through the chemical composition of trace metals (TMs) in these samples, it emphasizes the decrease of atmospheric metal pollution in this area during the last few decades and the critical role of wet deposition as source of TMs for Mediterranean surface seawater, especially for intense dust deposition events.\n\nEvolution under dark conditions of particles from old and modern diesel vehicles in a new environmental chamber characterized with fresh exhaust emissions\n\nBoris Vansevenant, CÃ©dric Louis, Corinne Ferronato, Ludovic Fine, Patrick Tassel, Pascal Perret, Evangelia Kostenidou, Brice Temime-Roussel, Barbara D'Anna, Karine Sartelet, VÃ©ronique Cerezo, and Yao Liu\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 7627–7655, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-7627-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-7627-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new method was developed to correct wall losses of particles on Teflon walls using a new environmental chamber. It was applied to experiments with six diesel vehicles (Euro 3 to 6), tested on a chassis dynamometer. Emissions of particles and precursors were obtained under urban and motorway conditions. The chamber experiments help understand the role of physical processes in diesel particle evolutions in the dark. These results can be applied to situations such as tunnels or winter rush hours.\n\nIntercomparison of IBBCEAS, NitroMAC and FTIR analyses for HONO, NO2 and CH2O measurements during the reaction of NO2 with H2O vapour in the simulation chamber CESAM\n\nHongming Yi, Mathieu Cazaunau, Aline Gratien, Vincent Michoud, Edouard Pangui, Jean-Francois Doussin, and Weidong Chen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 5701–5715, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5701-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5701-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHONO and NO2 play a crucial role in the atmospheric oxidation capacity that affects the regional air quality and global climate. Accurate measurements of HONO are challenging due to the drawback of existing detection methods. Calibration-free high-sensitivity direct, simultaneous measurements of NO2, HONO and CH2O with UV-IBBCEAS provide accurate and fast quantitative analysis of their concentration variation within their lifetime by intercomparison with NOx, FTIR and NitroMAC sensors.\n\nExperimental investigation of the stable water isotope distribution in an Alpine lake environment (L-WAIVE)\n\nPatrick Chazette, Cyrille Flamant, Harald Sodemann, Julien Totems, Anne Monod, Elsa DieudonnÃ©, Alexandre Baron, Andrew Seidl, Hans Christian Steen-Larsen, Pascal Doira, Amandine Durand, and Sylvain Ravier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 10911–10937, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10911-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10911-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo gain understanding on the vertical structure of atmospheric water vapour above mountain lakes and to assess its link to the isotopic composition of the lake water and small-scale dynamics, the L-WAIVE field campaign was conducted in the Annecy valley in the French Alps in June 2019. Based on a synergy between ground-based, boat-borne, and airborne measuring platforms, significant gradients of isotopic content have been revealed at the transitions to the lake and to the free troposphere.\n\nMeasurement report: Fourteen months of real-time characterisation of the submicronic aerosol and its atmospheric dynamics at the MarseilleâLongchamp supersite\n\nBenjamin Chazeau, Brice Temime-Roussel, GrÃ©gory Gille, Boualem Mesbah, Barbara D'Anna, Henri Wortham, and Nicolas Marchand\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 7293–7319, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7293-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-7293-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe temporal trends in the chemical composition and particle number of the submicron aerosols in a Mediterranean city, Marseille, are investigated over 14 months. Fifteen days were found to exceed the WHO PM2.5 daily limit (25 Âµg mâ3) only during the cold period, with two distinct origins: local pollution events with an increased fraction of the carbonaceous fraction due to domestic wood burning and long-range pollution events with a high level of oxygenated organic aerosol and ammonium nitrate.\n\nOn the importance of atmospheric loss of organic nitrates by aqueous-phase ●OH oxidation\n\nJuan Miguel GonzÃ¡lez-SÃ¡nchez, Nicolas Brun, Junteng Wu, Julien Morin, Brice Temime-Roussel, Sylvain Ravier, Camille Mouchel-Vallon, Jean-Louis ClÃ©ment, and Anne Monod\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 4915–4937, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-4915-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-4915-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOrganic nitrates play a crucial role in air pollution as they are considered NOx reservoirs. This work lights up the importance of their reactions with OH radicals in the aqueous phase (cloud/fog, wet aerosol), which is slower than in the gas phase. For compounds that significantly partition in water such as polyfunctional biogenic nitrates, these aqueous-phase reactions should drive their atmospheric removal, leading to a broader spatial distribution of NOx than previously accounted for.\n\nTechnical note: Emission factors, chemical composition, and morphology of particles emitted from Euro 5 diesel and gasoline light-duty vehicles during transient cycles\n\nEvangelia Kostenidou, Alvaro Martinez-Valiente, Badr R'Mili, Baptiste Marques, Brice Temime-Roussel, Amandine Durand, Michel AndrÃ©, Yao Liu, CÃ©dric Louis, Boris Vansevenant, Daniel Ferry, Carine Laffon, Philippe Parent, and Barbara D'Anna\n\nAtmos.

In this study the particle-phase emissions of seven Euro 5 passenger vehicles were characterized. Changes in engine technologies and after-treatment devices can alter the chemical composition and the size of the emitted particulate matter. The condition of the diesel particle filter (DPF) plays an important role in the emitted pollutants.\n\nChemical composition and source apportionment of atmospheric aerosols on the Namibian coast\n\nDanitza Klopper, Paola Formenti, Andreas Namwoonde, Mathieu Cazaunau, Servanne Chevaillier, AnaÃ¯s Feron, CÃ©cile Gaimoz, Patrick Hease, Fadi Lahmidi, CÃ©cile Mirande-Bret, Sylvain Triquet, Zirui Zeng, and Stuart J. Piketh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 15811–15833, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15811-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15811-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe chemical composition of aerosol particles is very important as it determines to which extent they can affect the Earth's climate by acting with solar light and modifying the properties of clouds. The South Atlantic region is a remote and under-explored region to date where these effects could be important. The measurements presented in this paper consist in the analysis of samples collected at a coastal site in Namibia. The first long-term source apportionment is presented and discussed.\n\nA comparative and experimental study of the reactivity with nitrate radical of two terpenes: Î±-terpinene and Î³-terpinene\n\nAxel Fouqueau, Manuela Cirtog, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin, and BÃ©nÃ©dicte Picquet-Varrault\n\nAtmos.

The optical cavity allows a high sensitivity for NO3 detection up to 6 ppt for an integration time of 10 s. The technique is now fully operational and can be used to determine rate constants for fast reactions involving complex volatile organic compounds (with rate constants up to 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1).\n\nDistinct chemical and mineralogical composition of Icelandic dust compared to northern African and Asian dust\n\nClarissa Baldo, Paola Formenti, Sophie Nowak, Servanne Chevaillier, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Claudia Di Biagio, Jean-Francois Doussin, Konstantin Ignatyev, Pavla Dagsson-Waldhauserova, Olafur Arnalds, A. Robert MacKenzie, and Zongbo Shi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 13521–13539, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-13521-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-13521-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe showed that Icelandic dust has a fundamentally different chemical and mineralogical composition from low-latitude dust. In particular, magnetite is as high as 1 %â2 % of the total dust mass. Our results suggest that Icelandic dust may have an important impact on the radiation balance in the subpolar and polar regions.\n\nMolecular insights into new particle formation in Barcelona, Spain\n\nJames Brean, David C. S. Beddows, Zongbo Shi, Brice Temime-Roussel, Nicolas Marchand, Xavier Querol, AndrÃ©s Alastuey, MarÃ­a Cruz MinguillÃ³n, and Roy M. Harrison\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 10029–10045, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-10029-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-10029-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNew particle formation is a key process influencing both local air quality and climatically active cloud condensation nuclei concentrations. This study has carried out fundamental measurements of nucleation processes in Barcelona, Spain, and concludes that a mechanism involving stabilisation of sulfuric acid clusters by low molecular weight amines is primarily responsible for new particle formation events.\n\nGlyoxal's impact on dry ammonium salts: fast and reversible surface aerosol browning\n\nDavid O. De Haan, Lelia N. Hawkins, Kevin Jansen, Hannah G. Welsh, Raunak Pednekar, Alexia de Loera, Natalie G. Jimenez, Margaret A. Tolbert, Mathieu Cazaunau, Aline Gratien, Antonin BergÃ©, Edouard Pangui, Paola Formenti, and Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 9581–9590, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-9581-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-9581-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen exposed to glyoxal in chamber experiments, dry ammonium or methylammonium sulfate particles turn brown immediately and reversibly without increasing in size. Much less browning was observed on wet aerosol particles, and no browning was observed with sodium sulfate aerosol. While estimated dry aerosol light absorption caused by background glyoxal (70 ppt) is insignificant compared to that of secondary brown carbon overall, in polluted regions this process could be a source of brown carbon.\n\nPhotolysis and oxidation by OH radicals of two carbonyl nitrates: 4-nitrooxy-2-butanone and 5-nitrooxy-2-pentanone\n\nBÃ©nÃ©dicte Picquet-Varrault, Ricardo Suarez-Bertoa, Marius Duncianu, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Marc David, and Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 487–498, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-487-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-487-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMultifunctional organic nitrates are important atmospheric species that are known to play a key role in the transport of reactive nitrogen and in aerosol composition. However, very little is known about their atmospheric reactivity. Here we provide an experimental study on the photolysis and reaction of two carbonyl nitrates with OH radicals. Atmospheric implications and the influence of the chemical structure on the reactivity are discussed.\n\nComplex refractive indices and single-scattering albedo of global dust aerosols in the shortwave spectrum and relationship to size and iron content\n\nClaudia Di Biagio, Paola Formenti, Yves Balkanski, Lorenzo Caponi, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Emilie Journet, Sophie Nowak, Meinrat O. Andreae, Konrad Kandler, Thuraya Saeed, Stuart Piketh, David Seibert, Earle Williams, and Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 15503–15531, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-15503-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-15503-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a new dataset of laboratory measurements of the shortwave (SW) spectral complex refractive index and single-scattering albedo (SSA) for global mineral dust aerosols of varying origin and composition. Our results show that the dust refractive index and SSA vary strongly from source to source, mostly due to particle iron content changes. We recommend that source-dependent values of the SW spectral refractive index and SSA be used in models and remote sensing applications.\n\nEvidence of the complexity of aerosol transport in the lower troposphere on the Namibian coast during AEROCLO-sA\n\nPatrick Chazette, Cyrille Flamant, Julien Totems, Marco Gaetani, Gwendoline Smith, Alexandre Baron, Xavier Landsheere, Karine Desboeufs, Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin, and Paola Formenti\n\nAtmos.

The high variability of atmospheric aerosol composition is highlighted using a combination of ground-based, airborne and space-borne lidar. Aerosols are mainly transported from Angola, but part of the highest aerosol layer may come from South America.\n\nSummertime surface PM1 aerosol composition and size by source region at the Lampedusa island in the central Mediterranean Sea\n\nMarc D. Mallet, Barbara D'Anna, AurÃ©lie MÃªme, Maria Chiara Bove, Federico Cassola, Giandomenico Pace, Karine Desboeufs, Claudia Di Biagio, Jean-Francois Doussin, Michel Maille, Dario MassabÃ², Jean Sciare, Pascal Zapf, Alcide Giorgio di Sarra, and Paola Formenti\n\nAtmos.

We show that the aerosol loading is similar to coastal sites around the Mediterranean. We observe higher loadings of sulfate and aged organic aerosol from air masses transported over the central and eastern Mediterranean in comparison to those from the western Mediterranean. These results highlight the rarity of pristine air masses, even in remote marine environments.\n\nThree years of measurements of light-absorbing aerosols over coastal Namibia: seasonality, origin, and transport\n\nPaola Formenti, Stuart John Piketh, Andreas Namwoonde, Danitza Klopper, Roelof Burger, Mathieu Cazaunau, AnaÃ¯s Feron, CÃ©cile Gaimoz, Stephen Broccardo, Nicola Walton, Karine Desboeufs, Guillaume Siour, Mattheus Hanghome, Samuel Mafwila, Edosa Omoregie, Wolfgang Junkermann, and Willy Maenhaut\n\nAtmos.

Results show that new particle formation and growth occurs only in the lower layer of the atmosphere, where aerosols are mixed due to convection, especially when the atmosphere is clean. A comparison of urban and suburban surface stations was also made, suggesting that such events may have a significant impact on ultrafine particle concentrations in a wide area.\n\nChAMBRe: a new atmospheric simulation chamber for aerosol modelling and bio-aerosol research\n\nDario MassabÃ², Silvia Giulia Danelli, Paolo Brotto, Antonio Comite, Camilla Costa, Andrea Di Cesare, Jean FranÃ§ois Doussin, Federico Ferraro, Paola Formenti, Elena Gatta, Laura Negretti, Maddalena Oliva, Franco Parodi, Luigi Vezzulli, and Paolo Prati\n\nAtmos.

Emission rates were found to be mainly sensitive to future temperature changes and poorly represented by current empirical emission models. Drought was found to aggravate thermal stress on emission rates.\n\nInfluence of the vapor wall loss on the degradation rate constants in chamber experiments of levoglucosan and other biomass burning markers\n\nAmelie Bertrand, Giulia Stefenelli, Simone M.

High levels of ultrafine particles (UFPs) are evidenced, but we demonstrate that most O3 arises from the fumigation of high atmospheric layers, whereas UFPs are generated inside the PBL. O3 contributions from the fumigation of the vertical recirculation of regional air masses, hemispheric transport, and horizontally from direct urban plume transport are shown. Complexity arises from the need to quantify them to abate surface O3.\n\nPrimary marine aerosol physical flux and chemical composition during a nutrient enrichment experiment in mesocosms in the Mediterranean Sea\n\nAllison N.

Fluxes are evaluated with an original approach, a \"lab in the field\" experiment that preserves the seawater and atmospheric complexity while isolating air-to-sea exchanges from their surroundings. We show different features of the aerosol emission fluxes compared to previous findings.\n\nOnline molecular characterisation of organic aerosols in an atmospheric chamber using extractive electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry\n\nPeter J. Gallimore, Chiara Giorio, Brendan M. Mahon, and Markus Kalberer\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We applied a new technique to provide a diagnostic fingerprint of the organic compounds present in aerosols. We followed changes in this fingerprint over time in lab experiments which mimic the conversion of plant emissions into aerosols. Our results compare well with computer simulations of the reactions and we conclude that the technique merits continuing use and development in future.\n\nMultiphase composition changes and reactive oxygen species formation during limonene oxidation in the new Cambridge Atmospheric Simulation Chamber (CASC)\n\nPeter J.

We studied particle formation from the oxidation of limonene and found substantial quantities of oxidising components which are thought to be associated with the negative health effects of particulates. State-of-the-art measurements of the products of limonene–ozone chemistry were also presented.\n\nAethalometer multiple scattering correction Cref for mineral dust aerosols\n\nClaudia Di Biagio, Paola Formenti, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Nicolas Marchand, and Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin\n\nAtmos.

In this work we provide an estimate of the Aethalometer multiple scattering correction for mineral dust aerosols at 450 and 660 nm. Our results suggest that the use of an optimized correction factor can lead to up to 11 % higher absorption coefficient and to 3 % higher single scattering albedo for mineral dust.\n\nEffect of mid-term drought on Quercus pubescens BVOCs' emission seasonality and their dependency on light and/or temperature\n\nAmÃ©lie Saunier, Elena OrmeÃ±o, Christophe Boissard, Henri Wortham, Brice Temime-Roussel, Caroline Lecareux, Alexandre Armengaud, and Catherine Fernandez\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 7555–7566, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7555-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7555-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the BVOC emissions variations of Quercus Pubescens, under natural and amplified drought, in situ, in order to determine the dependency to light and/or temperature of these emissions. Our results showed that all BVOC emissions were reduced with amplified drought. Moreover, we highlighted two dependences: (i) light and temperature and (ii) light and temperature during the day and to temperature during the night. These results can be useful to enhance emission models.\n\nSpectral- and size-resolved mass absorption efficiency of mineral dust aerosols in the shortwave spectrum: a simulation chamber study\n\nLorenzo Caponi, Paola Formenti, Dario MassabÃ³, Claudia Di Biagio, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Servanne Chevaillier, Gautier Landrot, Meinrat O. Andreae, Konrad Kandler, Stuart Piketh, Thuraya Saeed, Dave Seibert, Earle Williams, Yves Balkanski, Paolo Prati, and Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 7175–7191, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7175-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7175-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents new laboratory measurements of the shortwave mass absorption efficiency (MAE) used by climate models for mineral dust of different origin and at different sizes. We found that small particles are more efficient, by given mass, in absorbing radiation, particularly at shorter wavelength. Because dust has high concentrations in the atmosphere, light absorption by mineral dust can be competitive to other absorbing atmospheric aerosols such as black and brown carbon.\n\nDiurnal fluxes of HONO above a crop rotation\n\nSebastian Laufs, Mathieu Cazaunau, Patrick Stella, Ralf Kurtenbach, Pierre Cellier, Abdelwahid Mellouki, Benjamin Loubet, and JÃ¶rg Kleffmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 6907–6923, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-6907-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-6907-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSources of nitrous acid (HONO), a major precursor of the OH radical, are still under controversial discussion. Since mainly ground surface sources have been proposed, HONO fluxes were measured above an agricultural field. Positive daytime fluxes were observed which showed strong correlation with the product of the NO2 concentration and J(NO2). These results indicate HONO formation by photosensitized heterogeneous conversion of NO2 on soil surfaces as observed in recent laboratory studies.\n\nMeasurement of alkyl and multifunctional organic nitrates by proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry\n\nMarius Duncianu, Marc David, Sakthivel Kartigueyane, Manuela Cirtog, Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin, and Benedicte Picquet-Varrault\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 10, 1445–1463, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-1445-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-1445-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA commercial PTR-ToF-MS has been optimized in order to allow the measurement of individual organic nitrates in the atmosphere. This has been accomplished by shifting the distribution between different ionizing analytes. The proposed approach has been proved to be appropriate for the online detection of individual alkyl nitrates and functionalized nitrates.\n\nCLEPS 1.0: A new protocol for cloud aqueous phase oxidation of VOC mechanisms\n\nCamille Mouchel-Vallon, Laurent Deguillaume, Anne Monod, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Perroux, ClÃ©mence Rose, Giovanni Ghigo, Yoann Long, Maud Leriche, Bernard Aumont, Luc Patryl, Patrick Armand, and Nadine Chaumerliac\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 10, 1339–1362, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-1339-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-1339-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Cloud Explicit Physico-chemical Scheme (CLEPS 1.0) describes oxidation of water-soluble organic compounds resulting from isoprene oxidation. It is based on structure activity relationships (SARs) (global rate constants and branching ratios for HOâ¢ abstraction and addition) and GROMHE SAR (Henry's law constants for undocumented species). It is coupled to the MCM gas phase mechanism and is included in a model using the DSMACC model and KPP to analyze experimental and field data.\n\nGlobal scale variability of the mineral dust long-wave refractive index: a new dataset of in situ measurements for climate modeling and remote sensing\n\nClaudia Di Biagio, Paola Formenti, Yves Balkanski, Lorenzo Caponi, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Emilie Journet, Sophie Nowak, Sandrine Caquineau, Meinrat O. Andreae, Konrad Kandler, Thuraya Saeed, Stuart Piketh, David Seibert, Earle Williams, and Jean-FranÃ§ois Doussin\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 1901–1929, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-1901-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-1901-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModeling the interaction of dust with long-wave (LW) radiation is still a challenge due to the scarcity of information on their refractive index. In this paper, we present a unique dataset of dust refractive indices obtained from in situ measurements in a large smog chamber. Our results show that the dust LW refractive index varies strongly from source to source due to particle composition changes. We recommend taking this variability into account in climate and remote sensing applications.\n\nCharacterization of gas-phase organics using proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry: fresh and aged residential wood combustion emissions\n\nEmily A. Bruns, Jay G. Slowik, Imad El Haddad, Dogushan Kilic, Felix Klein, Josef Dommen, Brice Temime-Roussel, Nicolas Marchand, Urs Baltensperger, and AndrÃ© S. H. PrÃ©vÃ´t\n\nAtmos. Chem.

This approach allows for improved characterization, particularly of oxygenated gases, which are a considerable fraction of the total gaseous mass emitted during residential wood combustion. This study is the first thorough characterization of organic gases from this source and provides a benchmark for future studies.\n\nThe performance and the characterization of laser ablation aerosol particle time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LAAP-ToF-MS)\n\nRachel Gemayel, Stig Hellebust, Brice Temime-Roussel, Nathalie Hayeck, Johannes T. Van Elteren, Henri Wortham, and Sasho Gligorovski\n\nAtmos. Meas.

The advantage of this instrument is that it can analyze the ambient particles online and continuously. It is capable of analyzing inorganic material in ambient particles; in particular the presence of metals can be analyzed. Last but not least, it is a compact and easily transportable tool for field measurements.\n\nSecondary organic aerosol formation from isoprene photooxidation during cloud condensationâevaporation cycles\n\nL.

Cloud-induced SOA formation is experimentally demonstrated in this study, thus highlighting the importance of aqueous multiphase systems in atmospheric SOA formation estimations.\n\nOn the radiative impact of aerosols on photolysis rates: comparison of simulations and observations in the Lampedusa island during the ChArMEx/ADRIMED campaign\n\nS.

It is shown by using the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model (CTM) as well as in situ and remote-sensing measurements that taking into account the radiative effect of the tropospheric aerosols improves the ability of the model to reproduce the observed photolysis rates. It is hence important for CTMs to include the radiative effect of aerosols on photochemistry.\n\nOverview of the Chemistry-Aerosol Mediterranean Experiment/Aerosol Direct Radiative Forcing on the Mediterranean Climate (ChArMEx/ADRIMED) summer 2013 campaign\n\nM.

Results indicate an important atmospheric loading associated with a moderate absorbing ability of mineral dust. Observations suggest a complex vertical structure and size distributions characterized by large aerosols within dust plumes. The radiative effect is highly variable, with negative forcing over the Mediterranean and positive over northern Africa.\n\nAqueous-phase oligomerization of methyl vinyl ketone through photooxidation â Part 2: Development of the chemical mechanism and atmospheric implications\n\nB.

Over 70% of vehicles on this highway were diesel, and a high concentration of BC and NOx were measured. Even close to a major highway, the bulk of the aerosol mass was secondary in nature. Radiocarbon data revealed that most of the fossil organic carbon was from primary vehicular emissions and not from SOA.\n\nRelating hygroscopicity and optical properties to chemical composition and structure of secondary organic aerosol particles generated from the ozonolysis of Î±-pinene\n\nC.

Cu2+ has quenching effects on HULIS by complexation, hydrogen substitution, or electrostatic adsorption, with aromatic structures of HULIS. Such effects are less pronounced if from Mn2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+.

This study focuses on the particle size, mineralogy, cohesion, and iron mode of occurrence and reflectance spectra of dust-emitting sediments. Icelandic top sediments have lower cohesion state, coarser particle size, distinctive mineralogy, and 3-fold bulk Fe content, with a large presence of magnetite compared to Saharan crusts.\n\nPhotoenhanced sulfate formation by the heterogeneous uptake of SO2 on non-photoactive mineral dust\n\nWangjin Yang, Jiawei Ma, Hongxing Yang, Fu Li, and Chong Han\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Photochemical sulfate formation depends on H2O, O2, and basicity of mineral dust. The SO2 photochemistry on non-photoactive mineral dust contributes to sulfates, highlighting previously unknown pathways to better explain the missing sources of atmospheric sulfates.\n\nComparison of water-soluble and water-insoluble organic compositions attributing to different light absorption efficiency between residential coal and biomass burning emissions\n\nLu Zhang, Jin Li, Yaojie Li, Xinlei Liu, Zhihan Luo, Guofeng Shen, and Shu Tao\n\nAtmos.

The BrC fraction from residential coal and biomass burning emissions, which were the major source of BrC, was characterized at the molecular level. The CHOS aromatic compounds explained higher light absorption efficiencies of biomass burning emissions compared to coal. The unique formulas of coal combustion aerosols were characterized by higher unsaturated compounds, and such information could be used for source appointment.\n\nSuppressed atmospheric chemical aging of cooking organic aerosol particles in wintertime conditions\n\nWenli Liu, Longkun He, Yingjun Liu, Keren Liao, Qi Chen, and Mikinori Kuwata\n\nAtmos.

Previous studies demonstrated that the chemical lifetimes of cooking organic aerosols (COAs) were much shorter (~minutes) than the values reported by field observations (~hours). We conducted laboratory experiments to resolve the discrepancy by considering suppressed reactivity under low temperature. The parameterized k2–T relationships and observed surface temperature data were used to estimate the chemical lifetimes of COA particles.\n\nFormation and loss of light absorbance by phenolic aqueous SOA by ●OH and an organic triplet excited state\n\nStephanie Arciva, Lan Ma, Camille Mavis, Chrystal Guzman, and Cort Anastasio\n\nAtmos.

All the phenols formed light-absorbing secondary brown carbon (BrC), which then decayed with continued oxidation. Extrapolation to ambient conditions suggest âOH is the dominant sink of secondary phenolic BrC in fog/cloud drops, while 3C* controls the lifetime of this light absorption in particle water.\n\nTechnical Note: A technique to convert NO2 to NO2â with S(IV) and its application to measuring nitrate photolysis\n\nAaron Lieberman, Julietta Picco, Murat Onder, and Cort Anastasio\n\nAtmos.

As an example of the utility of the method, we quantified both photolysis channels of nitrate, with and without a scavenger for hydroxyl radical (·OH). The results show that without a scavenger, ·OH reacts with nitrite to form nitrogen dioxide, suppressing the apparent quantum yield of NO2− and enhancing that of NO2.\n\nDistribution, chemical, and molecular composition of high and low molecular weight humic-like substances in ambient aerosols\n\nXingjun Fan, Ao Cheng, Xufang Yu, Tao Cao, Dan Chen, Wenchao Ji, Yongbing Cai, Fande Meng, Jianzhong Song, and Ping'an Peng\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 24, 3769–3783, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3769-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3769-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMolecular-level characteristics of high molecular weight (HMW) and low MW (LMW) humic-like substances (HULIS) were comprehensively investigated, where HMW HULIS had larger chromophores and larger molecular size than LMW HULIS and exhibited higher aromaticity and humification. Electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed more aromatic molecules in HMW HULIS. HMW HULIS had more CHON compounds, while LMW HULIS had more CHO compounds.\n\nDesorption lifetimes and activation energies influencing gasâsurface interactions and multiphase chemical kinetics\n\nDaniel A. Knopf, Markus Ammann, Thomas Berkemeier, Ulrich PÃ¶schl, and Manabu Shiraiwa\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 3445–3528, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3445-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-3445-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe initial step of interfacial and multiphase chemical processes involves adsorption and desorption of gas species. This study demonstrates the role of desorption energy governing the residence time of the gas species at the environmental interface. A parameterization is formulated that enables the prediction of desorption energy based on the molecular weight, polarizability, and oxygen-to-carbon ratio of the desorbing chemical species. Its application to gas–particle interactions is discussed.\n\nMolecular analysis of secondary organic aerosol and brown carbon from the oxidation of indole\n\nFeng Jiang, Kyla Siemens, Claudia Linke, Yanxia Li, Yiwei Gong, Thomas Leisner, Alexander Laskin, and Harald Saathoff\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2639–2649, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2639-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2639-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the optical properties, chemical composition, and formation mechanisms of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and brown carbon (BrC) from the oxidation of indole with and without NO2 in the Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere (AIDA) simulation chamber. This work is one of the very few to link the optical properties and chemical composition of indole SOA with and without NO2 by simulation chamber experiments.\n\nSecondary organic aerosol formed by Euro 5 gasoline vehicle emissions: chemical composition and gas-to-particle phase partitioning\n\nEvangelia Kostenidou, Baptiste Marques, Brice Temime-Roussel, Yao Liu, Boris Vansevenant, Karine Sartelet, and Barbara D'Anna\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 2705–2729, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2705-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-2705-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSecondary organic aerosol (SOA) from gasoline vehicles can be a significant source of particulate matter in urban areas. Here the chemical composition of secondary volatile organic compounds and SOA produced by photo-oxidation of Euro 5 gasoline vehicle emissions was studied. The volatility of the SOA formed was calculated. Except for the temperature and the concentration of the aerosol, additional parameters may play a role in the gas-to-particle partitioning.\n\nCharacterization of the particle size distribution, mineralogy and Fe mode of occurrence of dust-emitting sediments across the Mojave Desert, California, USA\n\nAdolfo GonzÃ¡lez-Romero, Cristina GonzÃ¡lez-FlÃ³rez, Agnesh Panta, JesÃºs Yus-DÃ­ez, Patricia CÃ³rdoba, Andres Alastuey, Natalia Moreno, Melani HernÃ¡ndez-Chiriboga, Konrad Kandler, Martina Klose, Roger N. Clark, Bethany L. Ehlmann, Rebecca N. Greenberger, Abigail M. Keebler, Phil Brodrick, Robert Green, Paul Ginoux, Xavier Querol, and Carlos PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a-Pando\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-434,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-434, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this research, we studied the dust-emitting properties of crusts and aeolian ripples from the Mojave Desert. These properties are key to understand the effect of dust upon climate. We found two different playa lakes according to the groundwater regime which implies differences on crusts cohesion state and its mineralogy, which can affect the dust emission potential and properties. We also compare them with Moroccan Sahara crusts and Icelandic top sediments.\n\nAssessment of the contribution of residential waste burning to ambient PM10 concentrations in Hungary and Romania\n\nAndrÃ¡s Hoffer, Aida Meiramova, ÃdÃ¡m TÃ³th, Beatrix Jancsek-TurÃ³czi, Gyula Kiss, Ãgnes RostÃ¡si, Erika Andrea Levei, Luminita Marmureanu, Attila Machon, and AndrÃ¡s GelencsÃ©r\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1659–1671, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1659-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1659-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSpecific tracer compounds identified previously in controlled test burnings of different waste types in the laboratory were detected and quantified in ambient PM10 samples collected in five Hungarian and four Romanian settlements. Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on the relative emission factors of individual tracers suggested that the contribution of solid waste burning particulate emissions to ambient PM10 mass concentrations may be as high as a few percent.\n\nSource differences in the components and cytotoxicity of PM2.5 from automobile exhaust, coal combustion, and biomass burning contributing to urban aerosol toxicity\n\nXiao-San Luo, Weijie Huang, Guofeng Shen, Yuting Pang, Mingwei Tang, Weijun Li, Zhen Zhao, Hanhan Li, Yaqian Wei, Longjiao Xie, and Tariq Mehmood\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1345–1360, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1345-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1345-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPM2.5 are air pollutants threatening health globally, but they are a mixture of chemical compositions from many sources and result in unequal toxicity. Which composition from which source of PM2.5 as the most hazardous object is a question hindering effective pollution control policy-making. With chemical and toxicity experiments, we found automobile exhaust and coal combustion to be priority emissions with higher toxic compositions for precise air pollution control, ensuring public health.\n\nChamber studies of OH + dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl disulfide: insights into the dimethyl sulfide oxidation mechanism\n\nMatthew B. Goss and Jesse H. Kroll\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1299–1314, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1299-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1299-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe chemistry driving dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation and subsequent sulfate particle formation in the atmosphere is poorly constrained. We oxidized two related compounds (dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl disulfide) in the laboratory under varied NOx conditions and measured the gas- and particle-phase products. These results demonstrate that both the OH addition and OH abstraction pathways for DMS oxidation contribute to particle formation via mechanisms that do not involve the SO2 intermediate.\n\nLow-temperature ice nucleation of sea spray and secondary marine aerosols under cirrus cloud conditions\n\nRyan J. Patnaude, Kathryn A. Moore, Russell J. Perkins, Thomas C. J. Hill, Paul J. DeMott, and Sonia M. Kreidenweis\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 911–928, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-911-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-911-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we examined the effect of atmospheric aging on sea spray aerosols (SSAs) to form ice and how newly formed secondary marine aerosols (SMAs) may freeze at cirrus temperatures (< −38 °C). Results show that SSAs freeze at different relative humidities (RHs) depending on the temperature and that the ice-nucleating ability of SSA was not hindered by atmospheric aging. SMAs are shown to freeze at high RHs and are likely inefficient at forming ice at cirrus temperatures.\n\nTemperature-dependent aqueous OH kinetics of C2âC10 linear and terpenoid alcohols and diols: new rate coefficients, structureâactivity relationship, and atmospheric lifetimes\n\nBartÅomiej Witkowski, Priyanka Jain, Beata WileÅska, and Tomasz Gierczak\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 663–688, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-663-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-663-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article reports the results of the kinetic measurements for the aqueous oxidation of the 29 aliphatic alcohols by hydroxyl radical (OH) at different temperatures. The data acquired and the literature data were used to optimize a model for predicting the aqueous OH reactivity of alcohols and carboxylic acids and to estimate the atmospheric lifetimes of five terpenoic alcohols. The kinetic data provided new insights into the mechanism of aqueous oxidation of aliphatic molecules by the OH.\n\nA possible unaccounted source of nitrogen-containing compound formation in aerosols: amines reacting with secondary ozonides\n\nJunting Qiu, Xinlin Shen, Jiangyao Chen, Guiying Li, and Taicheng An\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 155–166, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-155-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-155-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied reactions of secondary ozonides (SOZs) with amines. SOZs formed from ozonolysis of β-caryophyllene and α-humulene are found to be reactive to ethylamine and methylamine. Products from SOZs with various conformations reacting with the same amine had different functional groups. Our findings indicate that interaction of SOZs with amines in the atmosphere is very complicated, which is potentially a hitherto unrecognized source of N-containing compound formation.\n\nSeasonal variations in photooxidant formation and light absorption in aqueous extracts of ambient particles\n\nLan Ma, Reed Worland, Laura Heinlein, Chrystal Guzman, Wenqing Jiang, Christopher Niedek, Keith J. Bein, Qi Zhang, and Cort Anastasio\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1–21, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe measured concentrations of three photooxidants – the hydroxyl radical, triplet excited states of organic carbon, and singlet molecular oxygen – in fine particles collected over a year. Concentrations are highest in extracts of fresh biomass burning particles, largely because they have the highest particle concentrations and highest light absorption. When normalized by light absorption, rates of formation for each oxidant are generally similar for the four particle types we observed.\n\nVariability in sediment particle size, mineralogy, and Fe mode of occurrence across dust-source inland drainage basins: the case of the lower DrÃ¢a Valley, Morocco\n\nAdolfo GonzÃ¡lez-Romero, Cristina GonzÃ¡lez-FlÃ³rez, Agnesh Panta, JesÃºs Yus-DÃ­ez, Cristina Reche, Patricia CÃ³rdoba, Natalia Moreno, Andres Alastuey, Konrad Kandler, Martina Klose, Clarissa Baldo, Roger N. Clark, Zongbo Shi, Xavier Querol, and Carlos PÃ©rez GarcÃ­a-Pando\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15815–15834, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15815-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15815-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effect of dust emitted from desertic surfaces upon climate and ecosystems depends on size and mineralogy, but data from soil mineral atlases of desert soils are scarce. We performed particle-size distribution, mineralogy, and Fe speciation in southern Morocco. Results show coarser particles with high quartz proportion are near the elevated areas, while in depressed areas, sizes are finer, and proportions of clays and nano-Fe oxides are higher. This difference is important for dust modelling.\n\nGasâparticle partitioning of toluene oxidation products: an experimental and modeling study\n\nVictor Lannuque, Barbara D'Anna, Evangelia Kostenidou, Florian Couvidat, Alvaro Martinez-Valiente, Philipp Eichler, Armin Wisthaler, Markus MÃ¼ller, Brice Temime-Roussel, Richard Valorso, and Karine Sartelet\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15537–15560, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15537-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15537-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge uncertainties remain in understanding secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from toluene oxidation. In this study, speciation measurements in gaseous and particulate phases were carried out, providing partitioning and volatility data on individual toluene SOA components at different temperatures. A new detailed oxidation mechanism was developed to improve modeled speciation, and effects of different processes involved in gas–particle partitioning at the molecular scale are explored.\n\nChemically speciated air pollutant emissions from open burning of household solid waste from South Africa\n\nXiaoliang Wang, Hatef Firouzkouhi, Judith C. Chow, John G. Watson, Steven Sai Hang Ho, Warren Carter, and Alexandra S. M. De Vos\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15375–15393, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15375-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15375-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOpen burning of municipal solid waste emits chemicals that are harmful to the environment. This paper reports source profiles and emission factors for PM2.5 species and acidic/alkali gases from laboratory combustion of 10 waste categories (including plastics and biomass) that represent open burning in South Africa. Results will be useful for health and climate impact assessments, speciated emission inventories, source-oriented dispersion models, and receptor-based source apportionment.\n\nBulk and molecular-level composition of primary organic aerosol from wood, straw, cow dung, and plastic burning\n\nJun Zhang, Kun Li, Tiantian Wang, Erlend GammelsÃ¦ter, Rico K. Y. Cheung, Mihnea Surdu, Sophie Bogler, Deepika Bhattu, Dongyu S. Wang, Tianqu Cui, Lu Qi, Houssni Lamkaddam, Imad El Haddad, Jay G. Slowik, Andre S. H. Prevot, and David M. Bell\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 14561–14576, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-14561-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-14561-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe conducted burning experiments to simulate various types of solid fuel combustion, including residential burning, wildfires, agricultural burning, cow dung, and plastic bag burning. The chemical composition of the particles was characterized using mass spectrometers, and new potential markers for different fuels were identified using statistical analysis. This work improves our understanding of emissions from solid fuel burning and offers support for refined source apportionment.\n\nVolatile oxidation products and secondary organosiloxane aerosol from D5 + OH at varying OH exposures\n\nHyun Gu Kang, Yanfang Chen, Yoojin Park, Thomas Berkemeier, and Hwajin Kim\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 14307–14323, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-14307-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-14307-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nD5 is an emerging anthropogenic pollutant that is ubiquitous in indoor and urban environments, and the OH oxidation of D5 forms secondary organosiloxane aerosol (SOSiA). Application of a kinetic box model that uses a volatility basis set (VBS) showed that consideration of oxidative aging (aging-VBS) predicts SOSiA formation much better than using a standard-VBS model. Ageing-dependent parameterization is needed to accurately model SOSiA to assess the implications of siloxanes for air quality.\n\nMolecular fingerprints and health risks of smoke from home-use incense burning\n\nKai Song, Rongzhi Tang, Jingshun Zhang, Zichao Wan, Yuan Zhang, Kun Hu, Yuanzheng Gong, Daqi Lv, Sihua Lu, Yu Tan, Ruifeng Zhang, Ang Li, Shuyuan Yan, Shichao Yan, Baoming Fan, Wenfei Zhu, Chak K. Chan, Maosheng Yao, and Song Guo\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 13585–13595, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13585-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13585-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIncense burning is common in Asia, posing threats to human health and air quality. However, less is known about its emissions and health risks. Full-volatility organic species from incense-burning smoke are detected and quantified. Intermediate-volatility volatile organic compounds (IVOCs) are crucial organics accounting for 19.2 % of the total emission factors (EFs) and 40.0 % of the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) estimation, highlighting the importance of incorporating IVOCs into SOA models.\n\nHigh enrichment of heavy metals in fine particulate matter through dust aerosol generation\n\nQianqian Gao, Shengqiang Zhu, Kaili Zhou, Jinghao Zhai, Shaodong Chen, Qihuang Wang, Shurong Wang, Jin Han, Xiaohui Lu, Hong Chen, Liwu Zhang, Lin Wang, Zimeng Wang, Xin Yang, Qi Ying, Hongliang Zhang, Jianmin Chen, and Xiaofei Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 13049–13060, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13049-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13049-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDust is a major source of atmospheric aerosols. Its chemical composition is often assumed to be similar to the parent soil. However, this assumption has not been rigorously verified. Dust aerosols are mainly generated by wind erosion, which may have some chemical selectivity. Mn, Cd and Pb were found to be highly enriched in fine-dust (PM2.5) aerosols. In addition, estimation of heavy metal emissions from dust generation by air quality models may have errors without using proper dust profiles.\n\nProduction of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) by fast-growing phytoplankton\n\nDaniel C. O. Thornton, Sarah D. Brooks, Elise K. Wilbourn, Jessica Mirrielees, Alyssa N. Alsante, Gerardo Gold-Bouchot, Andrew Whitesell, and Kiana McFadden\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 12707–12729, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12707-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12707-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA major uncertainty in our understanding of clouds and climate is the sources and properties of the aerosol on which clouds grow. We found that aerosol containing organic matter from fast-growing marine phytoplankton was a source of ice-nucleating particles (INPs). INPs facilitate freezing of ice crystals at warmer temperatures than otherwise possible and therefore change cloud formation and properties. Our results show that ecosystem processes and the properties of sea spray aerosol are linked.\n\nTechnical note: InÂ situ measurements and modelling of the oxidation kinetics in films of a cooking aerosol proxy using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D)\n\nAdam Milsom, Shaojun Qi, Ashmi Mishra, Thomas Berkemeier, Zhenyu Zhang, and Christian Pfrang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 10835–10843, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10835-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10835-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosols and films are found indoors and outdoors. Our study measures and models reactions of a cooking aerosol proxy with the atmospheric oxidant ozone relying on a low-cost but sensitive technique based on mass changes and film rigidity. We found that film morphology changed and film rigidity increased with evidence of surface crust formation during ozone exposure. Our modelling results demonstrate clear potential to take this robust method to the field for reaction monitoring.\n\nContrasting impacts of humidity on the ozonolysis of monoterpenes: insights into the multi-generation chemical mechanism\n\nShan Zhang, Lin Du, Zhaomin Yang, Narcisse Tsona Tchinda, Jianlong Li, and Kun Li\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 10809–10822, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10809-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-10809-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we have investigated the distinct impacts of humidity on the ozonolysis of two structurally different monoterpenes (limonene and Δ3-carene). We found that the molecular structure of precursors can largely influence the SOA formation under high RH by impacting the multi-generation reactions. Our results could advance knowledge on the roles of water content in aerosol formation and inform ongoing research on particle environmental effects and applications in models.\n\nQuantifying the seasonal variations in and regional transport of PM2.5 in the Yangtze River Delta region, China: characteristics, sources, and health risks\n\nYangzhihao Zhan, Min Xie, Wei Zhao, Tijian Wang, Da Gao, Pulong Chen, Jun Tian, Kuanguang Zhu, Shu Li, Bingliang Zhuang, Mengmeng Li, Yi Luo, and Runqi Zhao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9837–9852, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9837-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9837-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlthough the main source contribution of pollution is secondary inorganic aerosols in Nanjing, health risks mainly come from industry sources and vehicle emissions. Therefore, the development of megacities should pay more attention to the health burden of vehicle emissions, coal combustion, and industrial processes. This study provides new insight into assessing the relationship between source apportionment and health risks and can provide valuable insight into air pollution strategies.\n\nOpinion: Atmospheric multiphase chemistry â past, present, and future\n\nJonathan P. D. Abbatt and A. R. Ravishankara\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9765–9785, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9765-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9765-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWith important climate and air quality impacts, atmospheric multiphase chemistry involves gas interactions with aerosol particles and cloud droplets. We summarize the status of the field and discuss potential directions for future growth. We highlight the importance of a molecular-level understanding of the chemistry, along with atmospheric field studies and modeling, and emphasize the necessity for atmospheric multiphase chemists to interact widely with scientists from neighboring disciplines.\n\nDistinct photochemistry in glycine particles mixed with different atmospheric nitrate salts\n\nZhancong Liang, Zhihao Cheng, Ruifeng Zhang, Yiming Qin, and Chak K. Chan\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9585–9595, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9585-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9585-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we found that the photolysis of sodium nitrate leads to a much quicker decay of free amino acids (FAAs, with glycine as an example) in the particle phase than ammonium nitrate photolysis, which is likely due to the molecular interactions between FAAs and different nitrate salts. Since sodium nitrate likely co-exists with FAAs in the coarse-mode particles, particulate nitrate photolysis can possibly contribute to a rapid decay of FAAs and affect atmospheric nitrogen cycling.\n\nEffects of storage conditions on the molecular-level composition of organic aerosol particles\n\nJulian Resch, Kate Wolfer, Alexandre Barth, and Markus Kalberer\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 9161–9171, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9161-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-9161-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetailed chemical analysis of organic aerosols is necessary to better understand their effects on climate and health. Aerosol samples are often stored for days to months before analysis. We examined the effects of storage conditions (i.e., time, temperature, and aerosol storage on filters or as solvent extracts) on composition and found significant changes in the concentration of individual compounds, indicating that sample storage can strongly affect the detailed chemical particle composition.\n\nCharacterization of gas and particle emissions from open burning of household solid waste from South Africa\n\nXiaoliang Wang, Hatef Firouzkouhi, Judith C. Chow, John G. Watson, Warren Carter, and Alexandra S. M. De Vos\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8921–8937, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8921-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8921-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOpen burning of household and municipal solid waste is a common practice in developing countries and is a significant source of air pollution. However, few studies have measured emissions from open burning of waste. This study determined gas and particulate emissions from open burning of 10 types of household solid-waste materials. These results can improve emission inventories, air quality management, and assessment of the health and climate effects of open burning of household waste.\n\nChemically distinct particle-phase emissions from highly controlled pyrolysis of three wood types\n\nAnita M. Avery, Mariam Fawaz, Leah R. Williams, Tami Bond, and Timothy B. Onasch\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8837–8854, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8837-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8837-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of fuels like wood which occurs during combustion or as an isolated process. During combustion, some pyrolysis products are emitted directly, while others are oxidized in the combustion process. This work describes the chemical composition of particle-phase pyrolysis products in order to investigate both the uncombusted emissions from wildfires and the fuel that participates in combustion.\n\nPredicting photooxidant concentrations in aerosol liquid water based on laboratory extracts of ambient particles\n\nLan Ma, Reed Worland, Wenqing Jiang, Christopher Niedek, Chrystal Guzman, Keith J. Bein, Qi Zhang, and Cort Anastasio\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8805–8821, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8805-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8805-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlthough photooxidants are important in airborne particles, little is known of their concentrations. By measuring oxidants in a series of particle dilutions, we predict their concentrations in aerosol liquid water (ALW). We find •OH concentrations in ALW are on the order of 10−15 M, similar to their cloud/fog values, while oxidizing triplet excited states and singlet molecular oxygen have ALW values of ca. 10−13 M and 10−12 M, respectively, roughly 10–100 times higher than in cloud/fog drops.\n\nPhysicochemical characterization of free troposphere and marine boundary layer ice-nucleating particles collected by aircraft in the eastern North Atlantic\n\nDaniel A. Knopf, Peiwen Wang, Benny Wong, Jay M. Tomlin, Daniel P. Veghte, Nurun N. Lata, Swarup China, Alexander Laskin, Ryan C. Moffet, Josephine Y. Aller, Matthew A. Marcus, and Jian Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8659–8681, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8659-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8659-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmbient particle populations and associated ice-nucleating particles (INPs) were examined from particle samples collected on board aircraft in the marine boundary layer and free troposphere in the eastern North Atlantic during summer and winter. Chemical imaging shows distinct differences in the particle populations seasonally and with sampling altitudes, which are reflected in the INP types. Freezing parameterizations are derived for implementation in cloud-resolving and climate models.\n\nLarge differences of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) and low-volatile species in secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) formed from ozonolysis of Î²-pinene and limonene\n\nDandan Liu, Yun Zhang, Shujun Zhong, Shuang Chen, Qiaorong Xie, Donghuan Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Wei Hu, Junjun Deng, Libin Wu, Chao Ma, Haijie Tong, and Pingqing Fu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8383–8402, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8383-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8383-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis, we found that β-pinene oxidation-derived highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) exhibit higher yield at high ozone concentration, while limonene oxidation-derived HOMs exhibit higher yield at moderate ozone concentration. The distinct molecular response of HOMs and low-volatile species in different biogenic secondary organic aerosols to ozone concentrations provides a new clue for more accurate air quality prediction and management.\n\nImpact of fossil and non-fossil fuel sources on the molecular compositions of water-soluble humic-like substances in PM2.5 at a suburban site of Yangtze River Delta, China\n\nMengying Bao, Yan-Lin Zhang, Fang Cao, Yihang Hong, Yu-Chi Lin, Mingyuan Yu, Hongxing Jiang, Zhineng Cheng, Rongshuang Xu, and Xiaoying Yang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8305–8324, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8305-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8305-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe interaction between the sources and molecular compositions of humic-like substances (HULIS) at Nanjing, China, was explored. Significant fossil fuel source contributions to HULIS were found in the 14C results from biomass burnng and traffic emissions. Increasing biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) products and anthropogenic aromatic compounds were detected in summer and winter, respectively.\n\nTechnical note: Improved synthetic routes to cis- and trans-(2-methyloxirane-2,3-diyl)dimethanol (cis- and trans-Î²-isoprene epoxydiol)\n\nMolly Frauenheim, Jason D. Surratt, Zhenfa Zhang, and Avram Gold\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7859–7866, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7859-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7859-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe report synthesis of the isoprene-derived photochemical oxidation products trans- and cis-Î²-epoxydiols in high overall yields from inexpensive, readily available starting compounds. Protection/deprotection steps or time-consuming purification is not required, and the reactions can be scaled up to gram quantities. The procedures provide accessibility of these important compounds to atmospheric chemistry laboratories with only basic capabilities in organic synthesis.\n\nTechnical note: Intercomparison study of the elemental carbon radiocarbon analysis methods using synthetic known samples\n\nXiangyun Zhang, Jun Li, Sanyuan Zhu, Junwen Liu, Ping Ding, Shutao Gao, Chongguo Tian, Yingjun Chen, Ping'an Peng, and Gan Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7495–7502, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7495-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7495-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe results show that 14C elemental carbon (EC) was not only related to the isolation method but also to the types and proportions of the biomass sources in the sample. The hydropyrolysis (Hypy) method, which can be used to isolate a highly stable portion of ECHypy and avoid charring, is a more effective and stable approach for the matrix-independent 14C quantification of EC in aerosols, and the 13C–ECHypy and non-fossil ECHypy values of SRM1649b were –24.9 â° and 11 %, respectively.\n\nChemical evolution of primary and secondary biomass burning aerosols during daytime and nighttime\n\nAmir Yazdani, Satoshi Takahama, John K. Kodros, Marco Paglione, Mauro Masiol, Stefania Squizzato, Kalliopi Florou, Christos Kaltsonoudis, Spiro D. Jorga, Spyros N. Pandis, and Athanasios Nenes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7461–7477, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7461-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7461-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOrganic aerosols directly emitted from wood and pellet stove combustion are found to chemically transform (approximately 15 %–35 % by mass) under daytime aging conditions simulated in an environmental chamber. A new marker for lignin-like compounds is found to degrade at a different rate than previously identified biomass burning markers and can potentially provide indication of aging time in ambient samples.\n\nFormation of highly oxygenated organic molecules from the oxidation of limonene by OH radical: significant contribution of H-abstraction pathway\n\nHao Luo, Luc Vereecken, Hongru Shen, Sungah Kang, Iida Pullinen, Mattias Hallquist, Hendrik Fuchs, Andreas Wahner, Astrid Kiendler-Scharr, Thomas F. Mentel, and Defeng Zhao\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7297–7319, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7297-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7297-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOxidation of limonene, an element emitted by trees and chemical products, by OH, a daytime oxidant, forms many highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), including C10-20 compounds. HOMs play an important role in new particle formation and growth. HOM formation can be explained by the chemistry of peroxy radicals. We found that a minor branching ratio initial pathway plays an unexpected, significant role. Considering this pathway enables accurate simulations of HOMs and other concentrations.\n\nMeasurement report: Atmospheric aging of combustion-derived particles â impact on stable free radical concentration and its ability to produce reactive oxygen species in aqueous media\n\nHeather L. Runberg and Brian J. Majestic\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7213–7223, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7213-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7213-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnvironmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) are an emerging pollutant found in soot particles. Understanding how these change as they move through the atmosphere is important to human health. Here, soot was generated in the laboratory and exposed to simulated sunlight. The concentrations and characteristics of EPFRs in the soot were measured and found to be unchanged. However, it was also found that the ability of soot to form hydroxyl radicals was stronger for fresh soot.\n\nPhotoaging of phenolic secondary organic aerosol in the aqueous phase: evolution of chemical and optical properties and effects of oxidants\n\nWenqing Jiang, Christopher Niedek, Cort Anastasio, and Qi Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 7103–7120, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7103-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-7103-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied how aqueous-phase secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA) form and evolve from a phenolic carbonyl commonly present in biomass burning smoke. The composition and optical properties of the aqSOA are significantly affected by photochemical reactions and are dependent on the oxidants' concentration and identity in water. During photoaging, the aqSOA initially becomes darker, but prolonged aging leads to the formation of volatile products, resulting in significant mass loss and photobleaching.\n\nAn intercomparison study of four different techniques for measuring the chemical composition of nanoparticles\n\nLucÃ­a Caudillo, Mihnea Surdu, Brandon Lopez, Mingyi Wang, Markus Thoma, Steffen BrÃ¤kling, Angela Buchholz, Mario Simon, Andrea C.

The intercomparison was performed based on the observed chemical composition, calculated volatility, and analysis of the thermograms. We found that the methods generally agree on the most important compounds that are found in the nanoparticles. However, they do see different parts of the organic spectrum. We suggest pote"
