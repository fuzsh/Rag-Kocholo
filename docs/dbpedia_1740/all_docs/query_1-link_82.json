        "text": "Also available as http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week257.html\n\nOctober 14, 2007\n\nThis Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 257)\n\nJohn Baez\n\nTime flies! This week I'll finally finish saying what I did on\n\nmy summer vacation. After my trip to Oslo I stayed in London,\n\nor more precisely Greenwich. While there, I talked with some good\n\nmathematicians and physicists: in particular, Minhyong Kim, Ray\n\nStreater, Andreas Doering and Chris Isham. I also went to a\n\ntopology conference in Sheffield... and Eugenia Cheng explained\n\nsome cool stuff on the train ride there. I want to tell you about\n\nall this before I forget.\n\nAlso, the Tale of Groupoidification has taken a shocking new\n\nturn: it's now becoming available as a series of *videos*.\n\nBut first, some miscellaneous fun stuff on math and astronomy.\n\nMath: if you haven't seen a sphere turn inside out, you've got\n\nto watch this classic movie, now available for free online:\n\n1) The Geometry Center, Outside in,\n\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6626464599825291409\n\nAstronomy: did you ever wonder where dust comes from? I'm\n\nnot talking about dust bunnies under your bed - I'm talking\n\nabout the dust cluttering our galaxy, which eventually clumps\n\ntogether to form planets and... you and me!\n\nThese days most dust comes from aging stars called \"asymptotic giant\n\nbranch\" stars. The sun will eventually become one of these. The\n\nstory goes like this: first it'll keep burning until the hydrogen in\n\nits core is exhausted. Then it'll cool and become a red giant.\n\nEventually helium at the core will ignite, and the Sun will shrink\n\nand heat up again... but its core will then become cluttered with even\n\nheavier elements, so it'll cool and expand once more, moving onto the\n\n\"asymptotic giant branch\". At this point it'll have a layered\n\nstructure: heavier elements near the bottom, then a layer of helium,\n\nthen hydrogen on the top.\n\n(A similar fate awaits any star between 0.6 and 10 solar masses,\n\nthough the details depend on the mass. For the more dramatic\n\nfate of heavier stars, see \"week204\".)\n\nThis layered structure is unstable, so asymptotic giant branch\n\nstars pulse every 10 to 100 thousand years or so. And, they\n\npuff out dust! Stellar wind then blows this dust out into space.\n\nA great example is the Red Rectangle:\n\n2) Rungs of the Red Rectangle, Astronomy picture of the day,\n\nMay 13, 2004, http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap040513.html\n\nHere two stars 2300 light years from us are spinning around\n\neach other while pumping out a huge torus of icy dust grains and\n\nhydrocarbon molecules. It's not really shaped like a rectangle\n\nor X - it just looks that way. The scene is about 1/3 of a light\n\nyear across.\n\nCiska Markwick-Kemper is an expert on dust. She's an astrophysicist\n\nat the University of Manchester. Together with some coauthors, she\n\nwrote a paper about the Red Rectangle:\n\n3) F. Markwick-Kemper, J. D. Green, E. Peeters, Spitzer\n\ndetections of new dust components in the outflow of the Red\n\nRectangle, Astrophys. J. 628 (2005) L119-L122. Also available\n\nas arXiv:astro-ph/0506473.\n\nThey used the Spitzer Space Telescope - an infrared telescope on\n\na satellite in Earth orbit - to find evidence of magnesium and\n\niron oxides in this dust cloud.\n\nBut, what made dust in the early Universe? It took about a\n\nbillion years after the Big Bang for asymptotic giant branch stars\n\nto form. But we know there was a lot of dust even before then!\n\nWe can see it in distant galaxies lit up by enormous black holes\n\ncalled \"quasars\", which pump out vast amounts of radiation as\n\nstuff falls into them.\n\nMarkwick-Kemper and coauthors have also tackled that question:\n\n4) F. Markwick-Kemper, S. C. Gallagher, D. C. Hines and J. Bouwman,\n\nDust in the wind: crystalline silicates, corundum and periclase in\n\nPG 2112+059, Astrophys. J. 668 (2007), L107-L110. Also available\n\nas arXiv:0710.2225.\n\nThey used spectroscopy to identify various kinds of dust in\n\na distant galaxy: a magnesium silicate that geologists call\n\n\"forsterite\", a magnesium oxide called \"periclase\", and aluminum\n\noxide, otherwise known as \"corundum\" - you may have seen it on\n\nsandpaper.\n\nAnd, they hypothesize that these dust grains were formed in the\n\nhot wind emanating from the quasar at this galaxy's core!\n\nSo, besides being made of star dust, as in the Joni Mitchell\n\nsong, you also may contain a bit of black hole dust.\n\nOkay - now that we've got that settled, on to London!\n\nMinhyong Kim is a friend I met back in 1986 when he was a grad\n\nstudent at Yale. After dabbling in conformal field theory, he\n\nbecame a student of Serge Lang and went into number theory. He\n\nrecently moved to England and started teaching at University\n\nCollege, London. I met him there this summer, in front of the\n\nphilosopher Jeremy Bentham, who had himself mummified and stuck\n\nin a wooden cabinet near the school's entrance.\n\nIf you're not into number theory, maybe you should read this:\n\n5) Minhyong Kim, Why everyone should know number theory,\n\navailable at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahmki/numbers.pdf\n\nPersonally I never liked the subject until I realized it was\n\na form of *geometry*. For example, when we take an equation like\n\nthis\n\nx^2 + y^3 = 1\n\nand look at the real solutions, we get a curve in the plane -\n\na \"real curve\". If we look at the complex solutions, we get\n\nsomething bigger. People call it a \"complex curve\", because\n\nit's analogous to a real curve. But topologically, it's\n\n2-dimensional. This will be important in a few minutes, so\n\ndon't forget it!\n\nIf we use polynomial equations with more variables, we get\n\nhigher-dimensional shapes called \"algebraic varieties\" - either\n\nreal or complex. Either way, we can study these shapes using\n\ngeometry and topology.\n\nBut in number theory, we might study the solutions of these\n\nequations in some other number system - for example in Z/p,\n\nmeaning the integers modulo some prime p. At first glance there's\n\nno geometry involved anymore. After all, there's just a *finite\n\nset* of solutions! However, algebraic geometers have figured\n\nout how to apply ideas from geometry and topology, mimicking\n\ntricks that work for the real and complex numbers.\n\nAll this is very fun and mind-blowing - especially when we reach\n\nGrothendieck's idea of \"etale topology\", developed around 1958.\n\nThis is a way of studying \"holes\" in things like algebraic\n\nvarieties over finite fields. Amazingly, it gives results that\n\nnicely match the results we get for the corresponding complex\n\nalgebraic varieties! That's part of what the \"Weil conjectures\"\n\nsay.\n\nYou can learn the details here:\n\n6) J. S. Milne, Lectures on Etale Cohomology, available at\n\nhttp://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/math732.html\n\nAnyway, I quizzed about Minhyong about one of the big mysteries\n\nthat's been puzzling me lately. I want to know why the integers\n\nresemble a 3-dimensional space - and how prime numbers are like\n\n\"knots\" in this space!\n\nLet me try to explain this in a very sketchy way, without getting\n\ninto any technical details. I'll still make mistakes... but this\n\nstuff is just too cool to keep secret - so if the experts don't\n\nexplain it, nonexperts like me have to try.\n\nYou can think of Z/p as giving a very simple sort of curve.\n\nNaively you could imagine it as shaped like a ring, for example\n\nthe integers mod 7 here:\n\n0\n\n6 1\n\n5 2\n\n4 3But now it's better to think of Z/p as a \"line\". After\n\nall, a line is defined by one variable and no equations. Here\n\nwe have one variable in Z/p.\n\nBut remember: a curve defined in a field like Z/p acts a lot\n\nlike a complex curve. And, a complex curve is topologically\n\n2-dimensional!\n\nSo, the \"line\" associated to Z/p seems 2-dimensional from the\n\nviewpoint of etale topology. In other words, it's really more\n\nlike a \"plane\" - just like the complex numbers are topologically a\n\nplane.\n\nThis is true for each prime p. But the integers, Z, are more\n\ncomplicated than any of these Z/p's. To be precise, we have maps\n\nZ -> Z/p\n\nfor each p. So, if we think of Z as a kind of space, it's a big\n\nspace that contains all the \"planes\" corresponding to the Z/p's.\n\nSo, it's 3-dimensonal!\n\nIn short: from the viewpoint of etale topology, the integers have\n\none dimension that says which prime you're at, and two more coming\n\nfrom the plane-like nature of each individual Z/p.\n\nNaively you might imagine a stack of planes, one for each prime.\n\nBut that's a very crude picture, and it misses a crucial fact: the\n\nprimes get \"tangled up\" with each other. In fact, each \"plane\" has\n\na specially nice circle in it, and these circles are *linked*.\n\nI've been fascinated by this ever since I heard about it, but I\n\ngot even more interested when I saw a draft of a paper by\n\nKapranov and some coauthor. I got it from Thomas Riepe, who got\n\nit from Yuri Manin. I don't have it right here with me, so I'll\n\nadd a reference later... but I don't think it's available yet,\n\nso the reference won't do you much good anyway.\n\nIn this paper, the authors explain how the \"Legendre symbol\" of\n\nprimes is analogous to the \"linking number\" of knots.\n\nThe Legendre symbol depends on two primes: it's 1 or -1 depending\n\non whether or not the first is a square modulo the second. The\n\nlinking number depends on two knots: it says how many times the\n\nfirst winds around the second.\n\nThe linking number stays the same when you switch the two knots.\n\nThe Legendre symbol has a subtler symmetry when you switch the\n\ntwo primes: this symmetry is called \"quadratic reciprocity\", and\n\nit has lots of proofs, starting with a bunch by Gauss - all a bit\n\ntricky.\n\nI'd feel very happy if I truly understood why quadratic reciprocity\n\nreduces to the symmetry of the linking number when we think of\n\nprimes as analogous to knots. Unfortunately, I'll need to think a\n\nlot more before I really get the idea. I got into number theory\n\nlate in life, so I'm pretty slow at it.\n\nThis paper studies subtler ways in which primes can be \"linked\":\n\n7) Masanori Morigarbagea, Milnor invariants and Massey products for\n\nprime numbers, Compositio Mathematica 140 (2004), 69-83.\n\nYou may know the Borromean rings, a design where no two rings are\n\nlinked in isolation, but all three are when taken together. Here\n\nthe linking numbers are zero, but the linking can be detected by\n\nsomething called the \"Massey triple product\". Morigarbagea\n\ngeneralizes this to primes!\n\nBut I want to understand the basics...\n\nThe secret 3-dimensional nature of the integers and certain other\n\n\"rings of algebraic integers\" seems to go back at least to the work\n\nof Artin and Verdier:\n\n8) Michael Artin and Jean-Louis Verdier, Seminar on etale cohomology\n\nof number fields, Woods Hole, 1964.\n\nYou can see it clearly here, starting in section 2:\n\n9) Barry Mazur, Notes on the etale cohomology of number fields,\n\nAnnales Scientifiques de l'Ecole Normale Superieure Ser. 4,\n\n6 (1973), 521-552. Also available at\n\nhttp://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=ASENS_1973_4_6_4_521_0\n\nBy now, a big \"dictionary\" relating knots to primes has been\n\ndeveloped by Kapranov, Mazur, Morigarbagea, and Reznikov. This\n\nseems like a readable introduction:\n\n10) Adam S. Sikora, Analogies between group actions on 3-manifolds\n\nand number fields, available as arXiv:math/0107210.\n\nI need to study it. These might also be good - I haven't looked\n\nat them yet:\n\n11) Masanori Morigarbagea, On certain analogies between knots and\n\nprimes, J. Reine Angew. Math. 550 (2002), 141-167.\n\nMasanori Morigarbagea, On analogies between knots and primes,\n\nSugaku 58 (2006), 40-63.\n\nAfter giving a talk on 2-Hilbert spaces at University College, I went\n\nto dinner with Minhyong and some folks including Ray Streater. Ray\n\nStreater and Arthur Wightman wrote the book \"PCT, Spin, Statistics and\n\nAll That\". Like almost every mathematician who has seriously tried to\n\nunderstand quantum field theory, I've learned a lot from this book.\n\nSo, it was fun meeting Streater, talking with him - and finding out\n\nhe'd once been made an honorary colonel of the US Army to get a free\n\nplane trip to the Rochester Conference! This was a big important\n\nparticle physics conference, back in the good old days.\n\nHe also described Geoffrey Chew's Rochester conference talk on the\n\nanalytic S-matrix, given at the height of the bootstrap theory fad.\n\nWightman asked Chew: why assume from the start that the S-matrix was\n\nanalytic? Why not try to derive it from simpler principles? Chew\n\nreplied that \"everything in physics is smooth\". Wightman asked about\n\nsmooth functions that aren't analytic. Chew thought a moment and\n\nreplied that there weren't any.\n\nHa-ha-ha...\n\nWhat's the joke? Well, first of all, Wightman had already succeeded\n\nin deriving the analyticity of the S-matrix from simpler principles.\n\nSecond, any good mathematician - but not necessarily every physicist,\n\nlike Chew - will know examples of smooth functions that aren't\n\nanalytic.\n\nAnyway, Streater has just finished an interesting book on \"lost\n\ncauses\" in physics: ideas that sounded good, but never panned out.\n\nOf course it's hard to know when a cause is truly lost. But a\n\ngood pragmatic definition of a lost cause in physics is a topic\n\nthat shouldn't be given as a thesis problem.\n\nSo, if you're a physics grad student and some professor wants you to\n\nwork on hidden variable theories, or octonionic quantum mechanics,\n\nor deriving laws of physics from Fisher information, you'd better\n\nread this:\n\n11) Ray F. Streater, Lost Causes in and Beyond Physics, Springer\n\nVerlag, Berlin, 2007.\n\n(I like octonions - but I agree with Streater about not inflicting\n\nthem on physics grad students! Even though all my students are in\n\nthe math department, I still wouldn't want them working mainly on\n\nsomething like that. There's a lot of more general, clearly useful\n\nstuff that students should learn.)\n\nI also spoke to Andreas Doering and Chris Isham about their work\n\non topos theory and quantum physics. Andreas Doering lives near\n\nGreenwich, while Isham lives across the Thames in London proper.\n\nSo, I talked to Doering a couple times, and once we visited Isham\n\nat his house.\n\nI mainly mention this because Isham is one of the gurus of quantum\n\ngravity, profoundly interested in philosophy... so I was surprised,\n\nat the end of our talk, when he showed me into a room with a huge\n\nrack of computers hooked up to a bank of about 8 video monitors,\n\nand controls reminiscent of an airplane cockpit.\n\nIt turned out to be his homemade flight simulator! He's been a\n\nhobbyist electrical engineer for years - the kind of guy who\n\nloves nothing more than a soldering iron in his hand. He'd just\n\ngotten a big 750-watt power supply, since he'd blown out his\n\nprevious one.\n\nAnyway, he and Doering have just come out with a series of papers:\n\n11) Andreas Doering and Christopher Isham, A topos foundation\n\nfor theories of physics: I. Formal languages for physics,\n\navailable as arXiv:quant-ph/0703060.\n\nII. Daseinisation and the liberation of quantum theory,\n\navailable as arXiv:quant-ph/0703062.\n\nIII. The representation of physical quantities with arrows,\n\navailable as arXiv:quant-ph/0703064.\n\nIV. Categories of systems, available as arXiv:quant-ph/0703066.\n\nThough they probably don't think of it this way, you can think\n\nof their work as making precise Bohr's ideas on seeing the quantum\n\nworld through classical eyes. Instead of talking about all\n\nobservables at once, they consider collections of observables that\n\nyou can measure simultaneously without the uncertainty principle\n\nkicking in. These collections are called \"commutative subalgebras\".\n\nYou can think of a commutative subalgebra as a classical snapshot\n\nof the full quantum reality. Each snapshot only shows part of the\n\nreality. One might show an electron's position; another might show\n\nits momentum.\n\nSome commutative subalgebras contain others, just like some open\n\nsets of a topological space contain others. The analogy is a good\n\none, except there's no one commutative subalgebra that contains\n\n*all* the others.\n\nTopos theory is a kind of \"local\" version of logic, but where the\n\nconcept of locality goes way beyond the ordinary notion from\n\ntopology. In topology, we say a property makes sense \"locally\"\n\nif it makes sense for points in some particular open set.\n\nIn the Doering-Isham setup, a property makes sense \"locally\" if\n\nit makes sense \"within a particular classical snapshot of reality\" -\n\nthat is, relative to a particular commutative subalgebra.\n\n(Speaking of topology and its generalizations, this work on topoi and\n\nphysics is related to the \"etale topology\" idea I mentioned a while\n\nback - but technically it's much simpler. The etale topology lets\n\nyou define a topos of \"sheaves\" on a certain category. The\n\nDoering-Isham work just uses the topos of \"presheaves\" on the poset\n\nof commutative subalgebras. Trust me - while this may sound scary,\n\nit's much easier.)\n\nDoering and Isham set up a whole program for doing physics\n\n\"within a topos\", based on existing ideas on how to do math in\n\na topos. You can do vast amounts of math inside any topos just\n\nas if you were in the ordinary world of set theory - but using\n\nintuitionistic logic instead of classical logic. Intuitionistic\n\nlogic denies the principle of excluded middle, namely:\n\n\"For any statement P, either P is true or not(P) is true.\"\n\nIn Doering and Isham's setup, if you pick a commutative subalgebra\n\nthat contains the position of an electron as one of its observables,\n\nit can't contain the electron's momentum. That's because these\n\nobservables don't commute: you can't measure them both simultaneously.\n\nSo, working \"locally\" - that is, relative to this particular\n\nsubalgebra - the statement\n\nP = \"the momentum of the electron is zero\"\n\nis neither true nor false! It's just not defined.\n\nTheir work has inspired this very nice paper:\n\n12) Chris Heunen and Bas Spitters, A topos for algebraic quantum\n\ntheory, available as arXiv:0709.4364.\n\nso let me explain that too.\n\nI said you can do a lot of math inside a topos. In particular,\n\nyou can define an algebra of observables - or technically, a\n\n\"C*-algebra\".\n\nBy the Isham-Doering work I just sketched, any C*-algebra of\n\nobservables gives a topos. Heunen and Spitters show that\n\nthe original C*-algebra gives rise to a commutative\n\nC*-algebra in this topos, even if the original one was\n\nnoncommutative!\n\nThat actually makes sense, since in this setup, each \"local view\"\n\nof the full quantum reality is classical. What's really neat is\n\nthat the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, saying commutative C*-algebras\n\nare always algebras of continuous functions on compact Hausdorff\n\nspaces, can be generalized to work within any topos. So, we get\n\na space *in our topos* such that observables of the C*-algebra\n\n*in the topos* are just functions on this space.\n\nI know this sounds technical if you're not into this stuff. But\n\nit's really quite wonderful. It basically means this: using topos\n\nlogic, we can talk about a classical space of states for a quantum\n\nsystem! However, this space typically has \"no global points\". In\n\nother words, there's no overall classical reality that matches all\n\nthe classical snapshots.\n\nAs you can probably tell, category theory is gradually seeping\n\ninto this post, though I've been doing my best to keep it\n\nhidden. Now I want to say what Eugenia Cheng explained on\n\nthat train to Sheffield. But at this point, I'll break down and\n\nassume you know some category theory - for example, monads.\n\nIf you don't know about monads, never fear! I defined them in\n\n\"week89\", and studied them using string diagrams in \"week92\".\n\nEven better, Eugenia Cheng and Simon Willerton have formed a\n\nlittle group called the Catsters - and under this name, they've\n\nput some videos about monads and string diagrams onto YouTube!\n\nThis is a really great new use of technology. So, you should\n\nalso watch these:\n\n14) The Catsters, Monads,\n\nhttp://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=0E91279846EC843E\n\nThe Catsters, Adjunctions,\n\nhttp://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=54B49729E5102248\n\nThe Catsters, String diagrams, monads and adjunctions,\n\nhttp://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=50ABC4792BD0A086\n\nA very famous monad is the \"free abelian group\" monad\n\nF: Set -> Set\n\nwhich eats any set X and spits out the free abelian group on X,\n\nsay F(X). A guy in F(X) is just a formal linear combination\n\nof guys in X, with integer coefficients.\n\nAnother famous monad is the \"free monoid\" monad\n\nG: Set -> Set\n\nThis eats any set X and spits out the free monoid on X, namely\n\nG(X). A guy in G(X) is just a formal product of guys in X.\n\nNow, there's yet another famous monad, called the \"free\n\nring\" monad, which eats any set X and spits out the free ring on\n\nthis set. But, it's easy to see that this is just F(G(X))!\n\nAfter all, F(G(X)) consists of formal linear combinations of\n\nformal products of guys in X. But that's precisely what you find\n\nin the free ring on X.\n\nBut why is FG a monad? There's more to a monad than just a\n\nfunctor. A monad is really a kind of *monoid* in the world of\n\nfunctors from our category (here Set) to itself. In particular,\n\nsince F is a monad, it comes with a natural transformation called\n\na \"multiplication\":\n\nm: FF => F\n\nwhich sends formal linear combinations of formal linear combinations\n\nto formal linear combinations, in the obvious way. Similarly,\n\nsince G is a monad, it comes with a natural transformation\n\nn: GG => G\n\nsending formal products of formal products to formal products.\n\nBut how does FG get to be a monad? For this, we need some\n\nnatural transformation from FGFG to FG!\n\nThere's an obvious thing to try, namely\n\nmn\n\nFGFG ======> FFGG ======> FG\n\nwhere in the first step we switch G and F somehow, and in the\n\nsecond step we use m and n. But, how do we do the first step?\n\nWe need a natural transformation\n\nd: GF => FG\n\nwhich sends formal products of formal linear combinations\n\nto formal linear combinations of formal products. Such a\n\nthing obviously exists; for example, it sends\n\n(x + 2y)(x - 3z)\n\nto\n\nxx + 2yx - 3xz - 6yz\n\nIt's just the distributive law!\n\nQuite generally, to make the composite of monads F and G\n\ninto a new monad FG, we need something that people call a\n\n\"distributive law\", which is a natural transformation\n\nd: GF => FG\n\nThis must satisfy some equations - but you can work out\n\nthose yourself. For example, you can demand that\n\nFdG mn\n\nFGFG ======> FFGG ======> FG\n\nmake FG into a monad, and see what that requires. Besides the\n\n\"multiplication\" in our monad, we also need the \"unit\", so you\n\nshould also think about that - I'm ignoring it here because it's\n\nless sexy than the multiplication, but it's equally essential.\n\nHowever: all this becomes more fun with string diagrams!\n\nAs the Catsters explain, and I explained in \"week89\", the\n\nmultiplication m: FF => F can be drawn like this:\n\n\\ /\n\n\\ /\n\nF\\ F/\n\n\\ /\n\n\\ /\n\n\\ /\n\n\\ /\n\n\\ /\n\n|m\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\n|\n\nF|\n\n|\n\nAnd, it has to satisfy the associative law, which says we\n\nget the same answer either way when we multiply three things:\n\n\\ / / \\ \\ /\n\n\\ / / \\ \\ /\n\nF\\ /F F/ F\\ F\\ /F\n\n\\/ / \\ \\/\n\nm\\ / \\ /m\n\n\\ / \\ /\n\nF\\ / \\ /F\n\n\\ / \\ /\n\n|m |m\n\n| |\n\n| = |\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\nF| F|\n\n| |\n\nThe multiplication n: GG => G looks similar to m, and it too has\n\nto satisfy the associative law.\n\nHow do we draw the distributive law d: FG => GF? Since it's a\n\nprocess of switching two things, we draw it as a *braiding*:\n\nF\\ /G\n\n\\ /\n\n/\n\n/ \\\n\nG/ \\F\n\nI hope you see how incredibly cool this is: the good old\n\ndistributive law is now a *braiding*, which pushes our diagrams\n\ninto the third dimension!\n\nGiven this, let's draw the multiplication for our would-be\n\nmonad FG, namely\n\nFdG mn\n\nFGFG ======> FFGG ======> FG\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n\\ \\ / /\n\n\\ \\ / /\n\nF\\ G\\ F/ /G\n\n\\ \\ / /\n\n\\ \\ / /\n\n\\ \\ / /\n\n\\ / /\n\n\\ / \\ /\n\n|m |n\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\nF| |G\n\n| |\n\nNow, we want *this* multiplication to be associative! So,\n\nwe need to draw an equation like this:\n\n\\ / / \\ \\ /\n\n\\ / / \\ \\ /\n\n\\ / / \\ \\ /\n\n\\/ / \\ \\/\n\n\\ / \\ /\n\n\\ / \\ /\n\n\\ / \\ /\n\n\\ / \\ /\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\n| = |\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\n| |\n\nbut with the strands *doubled*, as above - I'm too lazy to draw\n\nthis here. And then we need to find some nice conditions that\n\nmake this associative law true. Clearly we should use the\n\nassociative laws for m and n, but the \"braiding\" - the\n\ndistributive law d: FG => GF - also gets into the act.\n\nI'll leave this as a pleasant exercise in string diagram\n\nmanipulation. If you get stuck, you can peek in the back of\n\nthe book:\n\n14) Wikipedia, Distibutive law between monads,\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_law_between_monads\n\nThe two scary commutative rectangles on this page are the\n\n\"nice conditions\" you need. They look nicer as string\n\ndiagrams. One looks like this:\n\nF\\ G\\ /G F\\ G/ /G\n\n\\ \\ / \\ / /\n\n\\ |n \\ / /\n\n\\ / / /\n\n\\ / = / \\ /\n\n/ / /\n\n/ \\ / /\\\n\n/ \\ \\ / \\\n\n/ \\ \\ / \\\n\nG/ \\F |n \\F\n\n/ \\ G| \\\n\nIn words:\n\n\"multiply two G's and slide the result over an F\" =\n\n\"slide both the G's over the F and then multiply them\"\n\nIf the pictures were made of actual string, this would be obvious!\n\nThe other condition is very similar. I'm too lazy to draw it,\n\nbut it says\n\n\"multiply two F's and slide the result under a G\" =\n\n\"slide both the F's under a G and then multiply them\"\n\nAll this is very nice, and it goes back to a paper by Beck:\n\n15) Jon Beck, Distributive laws, Lecture Notes in Mathematics\n\n80, Springer, Berlin, pp. 119–140.\n\nThis isn't what Eugenia explained to me, though - I already knew\n\nthis stuff. She started out by explaining something in a paper\n\nby Street:\n\n16) Ross Street, The formal theory of monads, J. Pure Appl. Alg.\n\n2 (1972), 149-168.\n\nwhich is reviewed at the beginning here:\n\n17) Steve Lack and Ross Street, The formal theory of monads II,\n\nJ. Pure Appl. Alg. 175 (2002), 243-265. Also available at\n\nhttp://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/ftm2.html\n\n(Check out the cool string diagrams near the end!)\n\nStreet noted that for any category C, there's a category Mnd(C)\n\nwhose objects are monads on C and whose morphisms are \"monad\n\ntransforms\": functors from C to C that make an obvious square\n\ncommute.\n\nAnd, he noted that a monad on Mnd(C) is a pair of monads on C\n\nrelated by a distributive law!\n\nThat's already mindbogglingly beautiful. According to Eugenia,\n\nit's in the last sentence of Street's paper. But in her new work:\n\n18) Eugenia Cheng, Iterated distributive laws, available as\n\narXiv:0710.1120.\n\nshe goes a bit further: she considers monads in Mnd(Mnd(C)),\n\nand so on. Here's the punchline, at least for today: she shows\n\nthat a monad in Mnd(Mnd(C)) is a triple of monads F, G, H related\n\nby distributive laws satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation:\n\n\\F G/ |H F| G\\ /H\n\n\\ / | | \\ /\n\n/ | | /\n\n/ \\ | | / \\\n\n/ \\ | \\ / \\\n\n| \\ / \\ / |\n\n| / = / |\n\n| / \\ / \\ |\n\n| / \\ / \\ |\n\n\\ / | | \\ /\n\n\\ / | | \\ /\n\n/ | | /\n\n/ \\ | | / \\\n\n/H \\G |F H| G/ \\F\n\nThis is also just what you need to make the composite FGH\n\ninto a monad!\n\nBy the way, the pathetic piece of ASCII art above is lifted\n\nfrom \"week1\", where I first explained the Yang-Baxter equation.\n\nThat was back in 1993. So, it's only taken me 14 years to learn\n\nthat you can derive this equation from considering monads on\n\nthe category of monads on the category of monads on a category.\n\nYou may wonder if this counts as progress - but Eugenia\n\nstudies lots of *examples* of this sort of thing, so it's far\n\nfrom pointless.\n\nOkay... finally, the Tale of Groupoidification. I'm a bit tired\n\nnow, so instead of telling you more of the tale, let me just say\n\nthe big news.\n\nStarting this fall, James Dolan and I are running a seminar on\n\ngeometric representation theory, which will discuss:\n\nActions and representations of groups, especially symmetric groups\n\nHecke algebras and Hecke operators\n\nYoung diagrams\n\nSchubert cells for flag varieties\n\nq-deformation\n\nSpans of groupoids and groupoidification\n\nThis is the Tale of Groupoidification in another guise.\n\nMoreover, the Catsters have inspired me to make videos of this\n\nseminar! You can already find some here, along with course\n\nnotes and blog entries where you can ask questions and talk about\n\nthe material:\n\n19) John Baez and James Dolan, Geometric representation theory seminar,\n\nhttp://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-fall2007/\n\nMore will show up in due course.
