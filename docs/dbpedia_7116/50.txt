This place used to be the Sankara Circle, named after a former Head of state of Burkina Faso, Capt. Thomas Sankara. He was killed in a palace coup. The circle has been converted into a major interchange between the Ring Road Central and the Independence Avenue and renamed after Dr. Ebenezer Ako Adjei, a lawyer and founding member of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) and one of the "Big Six".
