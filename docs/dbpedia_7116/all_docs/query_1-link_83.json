        "text": "‘Be subject to the governing authorities’ (Rom. 13:1) has been the subject of discussion by scholars for centuries. Different interpretations have been given. The interpreters used mainly two traditional methods of biblical hermeneutics to interpret the text namely: (1) Historical critical methodologies which locate the meaning of a biblical text behind the text; and (2) the Exegetical method which locates the meaning of the text in the text. These methodologies which are part of the legacy of Western biblical scholarship have been used by Ghanaian biblical exegetes to interpret the text over the years. In this paper, the author the uses a the mothertongue biblical approach - a sub method of a broader methodology that finds the meaning of a text in front of the text – to find out what Rom. 13:1 mean to indigenous Ghanaian Christians and mother-tongue bible readers. Using fifteen (15) different versions of the Ghanaian mother-tongue translations of the text in six (6) languages, the author fo und out that, the different translations render pasa psuche and exousias the main subjects in the Greek text variedly, thus, giving a host of meanings to the text. The significance of this study is that it has added to the interpretations of the text, and thus it has implications for political education in Ghana.\n\nABSTRACT The concept of God in the traditional religion of Akan and Ewe ethnic groups compare to the Bible By Godwin Kwame Ofosuhene I am going to focus this writing, on how the Akan and Ewe ethnic groups of Ghana, understood God in their traditional religious practices and after that compare or discuss these beliefs in the light of the Holy Scriptures. Before you discuss on how somebody is doing something, it is also good to look at the reason why the person is doing that thing, so that you can be in a better position to educate the person properly. From this view point, I’ll begin to say that African Traditional Religion (ATR) involves the belief and worship of the Supreme Being known and revered all over Africa as Onyame in Akan, Mao in Ewe, Chineke in Igbo and Oludumare in Yoruba etc. The worship can be direct , but is done (mostly) indirectly through divine agents like the gods or divinities (abosom in Akan , legbaa in Ewe ) and the ancestors. Traditional theologians explained that one could not worship the Supreme Being formally, without the agency of the divinities or ancestors. Just as within the traditional political and diplomatic contexts, one cannot formally contact the king without the agency of his linguists or sub-chiefs. Therefore, these traditional theologians condemned those who said, “ATR and similar non-western religions are followed by irrational or foolish people who in their stupidity bow down to stones, trees and rivers instead of the Creator who created such objects and themselves”. They claimed or argued strongly that in the light of the more objective or scientific study of religions, ATR can no longer be justifiably characterized as stupid, since the worshippers do not worship the said material objects per se, but the Spirit of the Creator reflected in them. The traditional theologians also emphasized that as in all religious traditions, the belief and worship of the Supreme Being in ATR does not just mean the strict performance of certain rituals. But it is also the strict commitment, to the observance of certain (written or unwritten) divinely inspired moral prescriptions or codes of ethics, promulgated by the religious authorities and enforced by sanctions. These are called Taboos. In the Akan and Ewe ethnic groups the above phenomenological conception of ATR called for education in the light of the scriptures. For instance, in the southern Volta Region of Ghana, and in Togo and Benin, thousands of young girls of the Ewe (say Ay-vay) tribe are held as slaves in unspeakable conditions under a traditional religion belief called the “trokosi” system or “wives of the ancestral gods. This is one of the most amazing opportunities l have to speak or write in the hope of bringing freedom, to show the value of every human life, and to help girls who are in immense suffering. It is also an opportunity to help the Christian churches in the Akan and Ewe ethnic groups from which l come from, to see it as their duty to find means and ways to evangelise our fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts and children who are still under the African Traditional practices. For this reason, they can come to the saving knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ through the teaching of the Word of God because it is home going time."
