Akufo-Addo was called to the Middle Temple Bar, London, UK, in 1940 and returned to what was then the Gold Coast to start a private legal practice a year later.\n\nEarly political career, In 1947, he became a founding member of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) and was one of the \"Big Six\" (the others being Ebenezer Ako-Adjei, Joseph Boakye Danquah, Kwame Nkrumah, Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey and William Ofori Atta) detained after disturbances in Accra in 1948. From 1949 to 1950, he was a member of the Gold Coast Legislative Council and the Coussey Constitutional Commission.\n\nPost-independence career, After independence (1962–64), Akufo-Addo was a Supreme Court Judge (One of three Judges who sat on Treason trial involving Tawia Adamafio, Ako Adjei and three others after the Kulungugu bomb attack on President Kwame Nkrumah and for doing so was dismissed with fellow judges for finding some of the accused not guilty.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, he was appointed Chief Justice by the National Liberation Council (NLC) regime, as well as Chairman of the Constitutional Commission (which drafted the 1969 Second Republican Constitution).He was also head of the NLC Political Commission during this same time period.\n\nFrom 31 August 1970 until his deposition by coup d'état on 13 January 1972, Akufo-Addo was President of Ghana in the Second Republic. Unlike Nkrumah, however, he was only the nominal chief executive. Due to Nkrumah's authoritarian excesses, the president's powers were almost entirely ceremonial. Real power rested with the prime minister, Dr. Kofi Abrefa Busia. On 17 July 1979, Akufo-Addo died of natural causes.\n\nKofi Abrefa Busia, Prime Minister of the 2nd Republic of Ghana\n\nIn office - 1 October 1969 – 13 January 1972\n\nPresident\n\nBrigadier Akwasi Afrifa\n\n3 April 1969 – 7 August 1970\n\nNii Amaa Ollennu\n\n7–31 August 1970\n\nEdward Akufo-Addo\n\n31 August 1970 – 13 January 1972\n\nPreceded by\n\nKwame Nkrumah\n\nas Prime Minister\n\nPersonal details\n\nBorn July 11, 1913\n\nWenchi, Gold Coast\n\nDied August 28, 1978 (aged 65)\n\nOxford, United Kingdom\n\nPolitical party Progress Party\n\nSpouse(s) Naa Morkor Busia (died 2010)\n\nProfession Academic\n\nReligion Christian\n\nElected following military rule and overthrown by military regime.\n\nKofi Abrefa Busia (11 July 1913 – 28 August 1978) was Prime Minister of Ghana from 1969 to 1972. As a nationalist leader and Prime Minister, he helped to restore civilian government to the country following military rule.\n\nEarly life\n\nBusia was born a prince in the kingdom of Wenchi, in the Brong Ahafo Region, one of the four Gold Coast Territories, then under British rule and now called Ghana.\n\nEducation\n\nHe was educated at Methodist School, Wenchi, Mfantsipim School, Cape Coast, then at Wesley College, Kumasi, from 1931 to 1932. He later became a teacher at Achimota School. He gained his first degree with Honours in Medieval and Modern History from the University of London, through correspondence during this period. He then went on to study at University College, Oxford, where he was the college's first African student. He took a BA (Hons) in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (1941, MA) 1946) and a DPhil in Social Anthropology in 1947, with a thesis entitled \"The position of the chief in the modern political system of Ashanti: a study of the influence of contemporary social changes on Ashanti political institutions.\"\n\nCareer\n\nHe served as a district commissioner from 1942 to 1949, and was appointed first lecturer in African Studies. He became the first African to occupy a Chair at the University College of the Gold Coast (now the University of Ghana). In 1951 he was elected by the Ashanti Confederacy to the Legislative Council. In 1952, he was Leader of Ghana Congress Party, which later merged with the other opposition parties to form the United Party (UP).\n\nAs leader of the opposition against Kwame Nkrumah, he fled the country on the grounds that his life was under threat. In 1959 Busia became a Professor of Sociology and Culture of Africa at the University of Leiden near the Hague, Netherlands. From 1962 until 1969, he was a Fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford.\n\nHe returned to Ghana in March 1966 after Nkrumah's government was overthrown by the military to serve on the National Liberation Council of General Joseph Ankrah, the military head of state; and was appointed as the Chairman of the National Advisory Committee of the NLC. In 1967/68, he served as the Chairman of the Centre for Civic Education. He used this opportunity and sold himself as the next Leader. He also was a Member of the Constitutional Review Committee. When the NLC lifted the ban on politics, Busia, together with friends in the defunct UP formed the Progress Party (PP).\n\nIn 1969, the PP won the parliamentary elections with 104 of the 105 seats contested. This paved the way for him to become the next Prime Minister. Busia continued with NLC's anti-Nkrumaist stance and adopted a liberalised economic system. There was a mass deportation of half a million Nigerian citizens from Ghana, and a 44 percent devaluation of the cedi in 1971, which met with a lot of resistance from the public.\n\nWhile he was in Britain for a medical check-up, the army under Colonel Ignatius Kutu Acheampong overthrew his government on 13 January 1972. Busia died from a heart attack in 1978.\n\nAlong with J. B. Danquah and S. D. Dombo, Busia's name is associated with Ghana's political right. The New Patriotic Party has claimed the Danquah-Busia-Dombo mantle in the Fourth Republic.\n\nThe author Abena Busia, actress Akosua Busia are his daughters & yoga guru, Kofi Amaniampong Busia, is one of his sons. He left behind four sons and four daughters: Kwasi Osei, Afua Safoa, Nana Gyasi, Yaw, Abena, Kofi, Nana Frema and Akosua Busia.\n\nAdvertisement"
