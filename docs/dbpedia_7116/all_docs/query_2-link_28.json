Kwame Nkrumah fled to Conakry, Guinea after having been ousted upon the invitation of Sekou Toure, Guinea's first president.\n\nDr. Kwame Nkrumah was said to have died of cancer. 49 years now and the thoughts of his good and Pan- Africanism deeds keep lingering in our minds.\n\nMay his soul continue to rest in perfect peace.\n\nSource: www.kantankatv.com/Obidombie Kwabena Ahuofe\n\nShare This"
