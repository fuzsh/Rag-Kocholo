        "meta_description": "The monuments of Ghana’s first president Kwame Nkrumah that stand today in Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park in Accra have been the object of veritable “monument wars” (Savage 2009). Commissioned in 1956 and unveiled at the first anniversary of independence in 1958, the original statue has been continuously contested. In 1961, it suffered from a first bomb attack by militant opponents of the Nkrumah regime, and was toppled immediately after the coup against Nkrumah in 1966. It was not until 1992, under a relatively Nkrumah-friendly government, that the mausoleum and a new statue were constructed. However, contestations continued, and for the “Ghana@50 celebrations,” the then ruling Nkrumah-critical government erected the original beheaded statue behind the mausoleum, an act that Nkrumahists regarded as denigration. The history of the Nkrumah statues in Ghana bears out the paradox that generally characterises monuments: built as lasting memories, they remain embedded in social and political conflict. Conflicts surrounding the Nkrumah statues reflect Ghanaian political struggles between the ruling and opposition parties, which still portray themselves as successors either to the Nkrumaist project or to Nkrumah’s opponents. At the same time, they are an instructive example of how the politics and aesthetics of commemoration have been transformed over the past decades, developing from straightforward veneration, confrontation and destruction to more subtle forms of re-contextualisation and pluralisation.",

        "text": "4In this article, then, I will discuss the Nkrumah statue as a site of intense debate about Nkrumah’s political programme and his legacy for Ghana’s social and political order. At the same time, I will explore the statue as an object of aesthetic considerations and administrative activities. Finally, monuments do not speak for themselves but depend on the co-creation of meaning through a variety of other media, including further iconographic representations as well as performances, such as wreath-laying ceremonies or re-enactments of historical moments, accompanied by speeches and newspapers reports that offer competing readings of the statue and the hero it portrays. I cannot analyse all of these aspects in great detail, but hope to demonstrate that the making and remaking of monuments such as the Nkrumah statue are multifaceted processes that sometimes lead to unexpected outcomes in which multiple actors, often with conflicting intentions, participate.\n\nConstructing the Prime Minister’s Statue (1956-1958)\n\nContesting, Repairing and Replicating the Prime Minister’s Statue (1956-1966)\n\nRescuing the Original Statue(s) and Creating the Nkrumah Mausoleum (1972-2000)\n\n54 GMMB, Memorandum 0739/16, “Mounting of Nkrumah’s Statue,” 28 Feb. 1977, quoted in Fuller (2014: 17 (...)\n\nOne gesture of the “symbolic resurrection” of the nation’s founder was nonetheless realised under the Acheampong regime (Fuller 2014: 169-173). In 1975, the Director of the Museums and Monuments Board was informed that the ex-President’s statue, which had been removed in the wake of the 1966 coup, was still being kept at the central police station in Accra and would be better off if transferred to the National Museum for preservation. In fact, not only one, but two damaged statues—one headless and one armless—had been safeguarded at the police barracks and were now transported to the National Museum . Ghana’s twentieth anniversary of independence in 1977 offered an occasion to exhibit one of the original statues, the armless one, in the museum garden, where it still stands today, on a renewed pedestal, but with the initial plaque:\n\nThe original statue of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah which stood in front of Parliament House, Accra, attacked by a mob in the wake of a military and police coup d’État on 24th February, 1966, recovered for the National Museum in 1975, mounted by the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board, and unveiled on Thursday, March 3, 1977, by Mr. E. Owusu Fordwor, Commissioner for Education and Culture” (Fig. 4).\n\n23The ensemble’s architecture celebrates Nkrumah as a kind of chief, an allusion sustained by the bronze statue erected in front of the mausoleum that shows Nkrumah clad in royal kente cloth, pointing forward, as if symbolising the cpp slogan: “We face neither East nor West, we face forward. Forward ever, backward never.” The pose very much resembles the “dynamic attitude” of the sculpture which Cataudella had proposed for the Black Star Square monument, and Dr. Arthur insinuated that it was indeed one of the sculptures cast by Cataudella in the 1960s, shipped to Ghana, and stored in a warehouse where faithful Nkrumah followers salvaged it from the 1966 iconoclastic attacks (Fig. 6). There is no evidence to support this assertion, but most likely the statue was in fact produced according to Cataudella’s earlier designs, or even in his workshop. It may even be the one commissioned by the Acheampong government and shipped to Takoradi in 1976. In any case, as Dr. Arthur asserted, the statue was “found,” polished and varnished, and integrated into the mausoleum complex. Since then, this portrait of a triumphant and energetic Nkrumah has been reproduced over and over again on thousands of photographs which Ghanaians and foreign visitors shoot in front of the monument, on postcards, posters, calendars, T-shirts and coffee mugs (Fig. 7). It has become the new icon of the national hero and of Ghana’s independence. It seems as if with the increasing temporal distance from the original events this much larger statesmanlike statue has eventually supplanted in the public imagination the more modest, populist statue of 1958, despite the fact that the new statue has been erected on the very spot where Nkrumah declared independence, a moment and posture that was immortalised by the older sculpture.\n\nConstructing New Monuments, Continuing the “Monument Wars” (2000-2014)\n\n26The reburial, inauguration of the memorial park, and erection of the statue conferred on Nkrumah an incontestable place in the dominant national narrative. Nevertheless, intense controversies about Nkrumah’s regime and political legacy continued, particularly after the New Patriotic Party (npp), a party that regards itself as legitimate successor to the opposition against Nkrumah, won the elections in 2000 against the ndc. Yet unlike the 1966 coup-makers, the new government under J. A. Kufuor no longer attempted to raze the Nkrumah monument, but found other ways to leave a lasting imprint on Ghana’s commemorative landscape. On the one hand, the government created a series of new monuments commemorating politicians of the United Gold Coast Convention (ugcc), who had later become opponents of and were persecuted by Nkrumah. On the other hand, the Kufuor administration expanded, modified and re-contextualised the Nkrumah mausoleum and other existing monuments in ways that attempted to superimpose its own reading of Ghana’s political heritage on the Nkrumah-centred narrative.\n\n32Meanwhile, the statue at the mausoleum that shows Nkrumah in “dynamic attitude” continues to be the overriding image of the national hero. Most visitors to Memorial Park do not even take notice of the original statue behind the mausoleum. Furthermore, for a number of years now, the statue has been brought to life at every eve of Independence Day, by staging just in front of it a theatrical re-enactment of Nkrumah’s midnight declaration of independence by members of the Actors’ Guild, a very popular event to which hundreds of people flock in Memorial Park (Fig. 12). As Jesse Weaver Shipley (2015: 223) argues, the re-enactment epitomises a trend of objectifying independence by turning it into a cultural performance that is “no longer a marker of newness and possibilities for Ghanaian modern nationhood but […] a symbol of tradition, objectified and deployed in the service of the state.” At the same time, the ceremony has further contributed to enshrining the gleaming gold Nkrumah statue firmly as the dominant icon of Ghana’s independence.\n\n33The “monument wars” will certainly continue, but, as I have shown, the issues at stake and the measures with which the opponents make their commemorative claims have changed considerably over the past six decades. The statue(s) at the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park have become a lasting memory. New political turns are not likely to result in further destruction, but rather in more subtle forms of annexing, amplifying, re-inscribing, or otherwise modifying the existing monuments in order to transform their meaning so as to respond to changing contemporary agendas. The Nkrumah statues, and the national hero that they commemorate, have become a “lieu de mémoire,” a site of memory, to use Nora’s (1989) term, in which the memory of historical events crystallises and on which remembrance can focus. The statues have attracted controversial interpretations and become sites of debate that host a “maximum of meanings in a minimum of signs” (Rigney 2005: 18). They have become symbols for conflicting readings of the past and different projects for Ghana’s future—ranging from admonitions that the country’s democracy must be protected from dictatorial tendencies like those that Nkrumah developed or acknowledgements of Nkrumah as a leader who, despite facing serious internal and external challenges, greatly contributed to building a modern nation to celebrations of Ghana’s progress and the necessity to “look forward,” embodied in Nkrumah’s gesture with his outstretched arm. The history of the Nkrumah statue(s) clearly shows that although monuments are apparently built for eternity, they remain vulnerable, and are open for continuous redefinitions and re-appropriations."
