The accused in the case were Ebenezer Ako-Adjei (foreign minister), Tawia Adamafio (information minister), and Hugh Horatio Cofie-Crabbe (executive secretary of Nkrumah’s political party).\n\nThey were jailed under the Preventive Detention Act. CPP publications accused the defendants of complicity in the assassination attempt due to all of them choosing to ride in cars far behind the president when the bomb was thrown.\n\nREAD ALSO: Bulldog Finally Explains Why He Was Wickedly Staring At Nana Ama McBrown’s Chest Area – Apologizes To The Actress’ Husband\n\nThe trial lasted for over a year and the three were originally cleared by the court, headed by Chief Justice Arku Korsah. Nkrumah subsequently had Korsah dismissed from the bench and appointed a new court, re-charging the exonerated defendants. Nkrumah handpicked the jury in the next court which found the three guilty and sentenced them to death. The death sentences were later commuted to twenty-year sentences.\n\nThe three were however released from detention when Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown on February 24th, 1966.\n\nSource: GhanaCelebrities.Com\n\nREAD ALSO: Refused A UK Visa?
