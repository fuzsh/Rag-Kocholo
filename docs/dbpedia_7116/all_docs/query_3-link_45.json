From humble beginnings of barefist boxing on the beaches of Accra, Chocolate Kid would swim way out into the ocean with no fears, run marathons and even won the Queen's Coronation Cycling Championship Trophy.[citation needed] He became Welter and Middle-Weight Boxing Champion of Ghana and West Africa respectively retiring as an Undefeated Champion in 1941, a precedence in those years.\n\nAs a welter-weight boxer, \"Chocolate Kid\" claimed the Welter-Weight championship and the Sir Arnold Hudson Trophy in 1935. In 1939, in the second round of a friendly non-title bout, he knocked out one Jack Pullan, the Far Eastern Command Welterweight Champion, on board the troop ship New Northland [4]\n\nIn 1941, Chocolate Kid won the Middle-Weight title and the George R.

His mother Matilda Goy was German and his father was the Reverend Mark Christian Hayford MA, DD, FRCS [2] whose father was the Reverend, Joseph De Graft Hayford, the son of Reverend James Hayford, whose ethnic name was Kwamina Afua. The Hayford (Afua) family or clan of Cape Coast and Accra includes relations with the surnames Casely Hayford, Davy Hayford, degraft-Johnson, Yankah, Wilson, Welsing, Hutchful, Wilberforce, Graves and Brew, among others.[3]\n\nJ. E. S. de Graft-Hayford was from a Royal Fanti family of political nationalists and veritable Christian reverends and was first in line to follow in his father's footsteps as a reverend or be installed as the Chief of the Fanti stool (throne). He instead chose to become a civil servant, a champion fighter, a military man of esteem and, like his forefathers, a true believer in freedom and human rights. He was married to Phyllis de Graft-Hayford (née Stiff, 1919–2001), who co-established the first Child Care Centre in Ghana.[5] They have five children.\n\nNotes[]\n\nThe original indigenous surnames of many Ghanaians were corrupted during colonisation - such as 'Afua' becoming the name Hayford. This tended to be the norm of the day for phonetic simplicity for the European missionaries. It is therefore important not to connect the Hayford name with its roots from Ghana with that of the UK in historical and genealogical context.\n\nReferences[]"
