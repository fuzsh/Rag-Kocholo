        "text": "Ghana’s 67 years of independence have not traversed on a silver platter but through determination, resilience and patriotism, Ghanaians have come this far.\n\nThe annual celebration holds significance in Ghanaian history as the citizens remember how their forefathers like Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, Sergeant Adjetey, Corporal Attipoe, Private Odartey Lamptey, Joseph Boakye (J.B) Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey, Ebenezer Ako-Adjei, William Ofori Atta, Edward Akufo-Addo and others fought for Ghana’s independence.\n\nGhana gained independence on March 6, 1957 from the British colony. Before then, the Portuguese named Ghana, Gold Coast in the 15th century (1471).\n\nThe Portuguese gave the name Gold Coast because they found so much gold between the rivers Ankobra and the Volta on their arrival.\n\nAs Ghana marks 67 years after independence, The Ghana Report takes readers back to history to recollect historical events before, during and after Ghana’s independence.\n\nDeclaration of Ghana’s Independence\n\nOn the night of 5th and 6th March 1957, Ghana’s first Prime Minister, and the founder of the Convention People’s Party(CPP) Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah stood before thousands of Ghanaians in Accra to declare freedom for the people of Ghana. On that fateful day, he enlightened Ghanaians on the need to understand that they are no longer under foreign dominance but have the freedom as citizens to make their laws based on their culture and traditions.\n\nIn his short speech, he declared boldly, “At long last, the battle has ended! And thus, Ghana, your beloved country is free forever!\n\n“And yet again, I want to take the opportunity to thank the people of this country; the youth, the farmers, the women who have so nobly fought and won the battle.\n\n“Also, I want to thank the valiant ex-service men who have so cooperated with me in this mighty task of freeing our country from colonialist rule and imperialism.\n\n“And, as I pointed out… from now on, today, we must change our attitudes and our minds. We must realize that from now on we are no longer under subjugation but free and independent people.\n\n“But also, as I pointed out, that also entails hard work. That new Africa is ready to fight its own battles and show that after all the black man is capable of managing his own affairs.\n\n“We are going to demonstrate to the world, to the other nations, that we are prepared to lay our foundation – our own African personality.\n\n“As I said to the Assembly a few minutes ago, I made a point that we are going to t create our own Africa personality and identity. It is the only way we can show the world that we are ready for our own battles.\n\n“But today, may I call upon you all, that let us all remember that nothing can be done unless it has the purpose and support of God.\n\n“We have won the battle and again rededicated ourselves … OUR INDEPENDENCE IS MEANINGLESS UNLESS IT IS LINKED UP WITH THE TOTAL LIBERATION OF AFRICA.\n\n“Let us now, fellow Ghanaians, let us now ask for God’s blessing for only two seconds, and in your thousands and millions.\n\n“I want to ask you to pause for only one minute and give thanks to Almighty God for having led us through our difficulties, imprisonments, hardships and sufferings, to have brought us to our end of troubles today. One minute silence.\n\n“Ghana is free forever! And here I will ask the band to play the Ghana National Anthem.\n\n“Reshaping Ghana’s destiny, I am depending on the millions of the country, and the chiefs and the people, to help me to reshape the destiny of this country. We are prepared to pick it up and make it a nation that will be respected by every nation in the world.\n\n“We know we were going to have difficult beginnings, but again, I am relying on your support…. I am relying upon your hard work.\n\n“Seeing you in this… It doesn’t matter how far my eyes go, I can see that you are here in your millions. And my last warning to you is that you are to stand firm behind us so that we can prove to the world that when the African is given a chance, he can show the world that he is somebody!\n\n“We have awakened. We will not sleep anymore. Today, from now on, there is a new African in the world’ he ended.\n\nGhana Flag\n\nOn the midnight of March 5, 1957, the British flag was lowered as Ghanaians uplifted a new colourful and symbolic flag designed by Theodosia Salome Okoh after gaining independence.\n\nThe Ghana flag consists of the colours red, gold and green in horizontal stripes with a five-pointed black star in the centre of the gold stripe.\n\nSymbolically, the RED represents the blood of those who died in the country’s struggle for independence.\n\nThe GOLD represents the mineral wealth of the country from ancient days till now. The GREEN symbolises the country’s rich forests, while the BLACK STAR stands for the star of African Freedom or hope for Africans.\n\nNational Anthem\n\nShortly after the declaration of Ghana’s independence, another patriotic citizen, Philip Gbeho composed a national anthem for the nation.\n\nThe lyrics of the song seek God’s blessing in the land of Ghana and echo a sense of patriotism in the hearts of citizens.\n\nThe lyrics for the famous first stanza read; “God bless our homeland Ghana. And make our nation great and strong. Bold to defend forever. The Cause of Freedom and of Right. Fill our hearts with true humility. Make us cherish fearless honesty. And help us to resist oppressor’s rule. With all our will and might for evermore. And help us to resist oppressor’s rule. With all our will and might for evermore.\n\nE.T Mensah’s composition of “Ghana Freedom” song\n\nE.T. Mensah, a legendary highlife artiste in the early 1950s and 1960s composed another patriotic and solidarity song to celebrate Ghana’s independence.\n\nGhana, we now have freedom (freedom)\n\nGhana, land of freedom\n\nToils of the brave\n\nAnd the sweat of their labour\n\nToils of the brave which has brought results\n\nKwame, the star of Ghana (freedom)\n\nNkrumah, star Ghana (everybody)\n\nToils of the brave\n\nAnd the sweat of their labour\n\nToils of the brave which has brought results\n\nGhana, we now have freedom\n\nGhana, land of freedom (everybody)\n\nToils of the brave\n\nAnd the sweat of their labour\n\nToils of the brave which has brought results\n\nGold coast will thank Nananom and elders\n\nLate Casley Hayford, Mensah Sabbah\n\nPaa Grant, Sargent Adjetey and all who fought for freedom\n\nEverybody\n\nToils of the brave\n\nAnd the sweat of their labour\n\nToils of the brave which has brought results.\n\nNational Pledge\n\nGhanaians have been able to narrate and reaffirm their commitment to integrity, and to the nation through the national pledge.\n\nThe national pledge recited in schools, Parliament and other important gatherings recaps the trail to freedom and prowess in Ghanaians.\n\nThe words also remind citizens of the need to be faithful to the nation in any circumstances.\n\nThe words read: I promise on my honour to be faithful and loyal to Ghana my Motherland.\n\nI pledge myself to the service of Ghana, with all my strength and with all my heart.\n\nI promise to hold in high esteem our heritage, won for us through the blood and toil of our fathers; and I pledge myself in all things to uphold and defend the good name of Ghana.\n\nSo help me God.\n\nCoat of Arms\n\nAnother historical artefact Ghanaians can boost after gaining independence is the recognised Coat of Arms.\n\nThe Coast of Arms was designed by Mr. Amon Kotei on 4th March 1957, two days before Ghana’s Independence.\n\nComposition\n\nThe Ghana Coat of Arms is composed of a shield, divided into four quarters by a green St. George’s Cross, rimmed with gold. The following are the symbols in the quarters and their meanings.\n\nCrossed linguist staff and ceremonial sword on a blue background.\n\nPosition: Top left-hand quarter. It represents local administration.\n\nA heraldic castle on a heraldic is seen on a light blue background.\n\nPosition: Top right-hand quarter. Represents National Government.\n\nA Cocoa Tree\n\nPosition: Bottom left-hand quarter. Represents the Agricultural wealth of the country.\n\nA Mine Shaft\n\nPosition: Bottom right-hand quarter. Represents the mineral wealth of the country.\n\nA Gold Lion\n\nPosition: In the center of the green St. George’s Cross. Represents the continued link between Ghana and the Commonwealth.\n\nBlack five-pointed star rimmed with gold stands on the wreath of red, gold, and green colours.\n\nPosition: Surmounting (On top of) the shield. It represents the lodestar of African Freedom.\n\nTwo Eagles, around each of whose necks hangs a black star suspended from a ribbon of Ghana colours – red, gold, and green.\n\nPosition: Supporting the shield (Coat of Arms). This signifies a protector with strength, and very clear and attentive eyes keeping watch over the country.\n\nFinally, it has Ghana’s motto FREEDOM AND JUSTICE placed under the shield.\n\nOther positive stories Ghana can be proud of after 67 years of independence are the tertiary institutions, second-cycle institutions and other Junior High Schools.\n\nWith the health facilities, current leaders continue to improve on available health sectors to ensure that health delivery is convenient and accessible to all."
