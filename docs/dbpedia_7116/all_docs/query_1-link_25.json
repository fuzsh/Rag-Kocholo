This church is doing great in growth. Their enthusiasm, understanding, and love for the Lord keep increasing. Currently, their total number is fifteen (15). For this matter, we have assigned two (2) of our students, Jesus and Ahinkora, to Sunday and Wednesday meetings to help strengthen them. The Adoagyiri church has assigned Peter Abrokwa, one of our graduate students who completed in 2020, to take the role as an Evangelist.\n\n· Oklu Nkwanta church\n\nThis is one of the newly planted churches which report on their love for the church incredibly.

We did further visitation on three families to settle their marriage problems; There are promises from some listeners to search and visit the church in their various areas in Accra. For a lack of funds, we were unable to visit most of our Callers who requested us to visit their homes for studies. We pray for increased health and finance for our donors and sponsors, especially Steven and all who pray for this program. There has been a request for baptism and wish to help them in next week's programme. So far the program is serving as an opportunity for the advertisement of both the school and the church.\n\nWe are thankful for the unwavering support from our community, partners, and friends.

Larbi\n\nBear Valley Bible Institute - Accra East\n\nSecond Quarter Report - 2024\n\nCourses covered\n\nThe second quarter commenced on April 2nd, 2024, the first Friday of April, and concluded on June 29th, 2024, the last Saturday of June. During this quarter, the school successfully completed three courses:\n\nThe books of 1 & 2 Thessalonians\n\n1 & 2 Timothy, and Titus\n\nDenominational doctrines\n\nReport on the Students\n\nThe students' performance was highly commendable throughout this 2nd quarter. They demonstrated exceptional commitment by attending classes punctually and regularly. Moreover, they actively participated in class tests and discussions. The average attendance for this quarter was nine (9) students.\n\nIn April, all students participated in the Bear Valley Bible Institute graduation ceremony held at Serpeman Church of Christ auditorium on April 20th. The program was lively, and the speakers' presentations were inspiring. It was encouraging to see so much joy on the faces of the students.\n\nHouse to House Evangelism\n\nHouse-to-house evangelism continues in three communities: Gomoa Asebu, Santor, and Awutu Breku Twiime. These communities have congregations needing urgent attention, particularly Gomoa Asebu and Santor, where ministers are currently absent. I oversee these congregations along with Nmai Djorn, the mother church. Students are assigned to these congregations on a rotating basis, visiting every Sunday. They take the opportunity to engage in house-to-house evangelism after worship. During this period, we witnessed three baptisms: one in Gomoa Asebu, another in Awutu Breku Twiime, and one at Boi Church of Christ. At Boi Church, our student John Achie Quophy serves as a part-time preacher in the congregation\n\nReport on Awutu Breku Twiime Church\n\nThe students continue their visits to Awutu Breku Twiime Church of Christ this quarter. Established on September 24, 2023, through the Bear Valley Church Planting Program by Accra East, the church experienced one baptism during this period, maintaining an average attendance of 25 members. Accra East students continue to rotate their visits to the church every Sunday. On Sunday, June 30th, 2024, all students went to Awutu Breku and Asebu to assist with worship and evangelism.\n\nChurch Planting Program 2024\n\nThis year's church planting program is set for Achansa-Abobiri in the Eastern Region, a small cocoa farming village. Initially planned for April 26th-28th, 2024, the campaign and inauguration were postponed due to the passing of one of the community elders and subsequent seasonal rains. The new dates are now scheduled for July 27th-28th, 2024. We remain hopeful and pray for the successful establishment of the Church of Christ in this community.\n\nPending Lectureship\n\nThe school, in collaboration with Nmai Djorn Church of Christ, has scheduled a lectureship for the 1st Sunday in September this year. The event is planned for a Sunday to maximize participation. After discussions with the students over the past month and a half, the final date is confirmed for September 1st. For this year's lectureship, we intend to invite speakers from Bear Valley Bible Institute whom we trust to effectively address the chosen topic\n\nThe chosen topics for the lectureship are:\n\nHow to Safeguard Biblical Truth in a Changing World\n\nPrinciples of Hermeneutics and Interpretation: (Foundational rules and guidelines for interpreting and understanding biblical texts)\n\nThe Role of Scripture in Today's Culture\n\nThank you,\n\nPeter Arhinful-Quansah\n\nBear Valley Bible Institute, Accra\n\nEnd of April 2024 Operating Report\n\nWe give thanks to the Lord for His guidance and blessings throughout April 2024. It has been a month filled with growth, learning, and spiritual outreach. Below are the highlights of our activities for the month.\n\nAcademic Activities\n\nApril marked the beginning of a new quarter for our diploma class. Esteemed Bro Amoo Gyima led the students through enriching courses such as “The Life of Christ” and “Christian Evidences,” while “Scheme of Redemption” by Kojo, “Homiletics 1” by Shadrach Oppong, “Old Testament II and Godhead” by E. O. Larbi, and other subjects were also part of the curriculum. The dedication of both students and faculty has been commendable, ensuring a robust and spiritually enriching academic environment.\n\nGospel Campaign\n\nOur commitment to spreading the Word took the form of a church planting campaign that spanned two weeks, with activities conducted day and night. Although we did not witness any baptisms this month, we were blessed with the presence of three visiting prospects and the initiation of three new members. We remain hopeful that the seeds planted will bear fruit in God’s perfect timing.\n\nLeadership Seminar\n\nThe ongoing weekly leadership seminar at Akotoakrom, spearheaded by Bro E.O Larbi and Bro Sasu Ntim, has proven effective and transformative. The seminar has been instrumental in equipping our leaders with the knowledge and skills necessary to shepherd the flock and spread the gospel more effectively.\n\nWorking and Education on BV Library\n\nSammy has been moving around helping to resolve the network connection of the library, fixing errors, and educating its use to instructors and students. This month, he visited Koforidua and Accra East to help fix connection challenges. There was a peculiar error i.e. javascript error after connecting the laptop or phone. He is searching for how to resolve this to keep other students in touch and enjoy its use.\n\nThere were common questions students normally asked, “Can it be accessed everywhere I go,” and he answered, “It is a local area network.” Only when you are within the radius of the Wi-Fi yet, the school is working on upgrading it to be used worldwide.\n\nInstructors and students love using it because it contains many books you can access.\n\nGraduation and Matriculation Ceremonies\n\nApril 20th, 2024, was a historic day for our institution as we celebrated the 6th Graduation and 7th Matriculation ceremony for our Diploma class, alongside the 1st Graduation ceremony for our Degree class, which saw 12 students proudly receiving their degrees. The 2nd Matriculation ceremony was also held on this day. The events were not only successful but also memorable, marked by joyous celebrations and a spirit of camaraderie. As is our tradition, the ceremonies included a fundraising event, which received generous support from the churches. The funds raised will be instrumental in furthering our mission and supporting our students.\n\nWe are immensely grateful for the unwavering support of our partners, alumni, and friends of the college. Your prayers and contributions have been the cornerstone of our success. May the Lord continue to bless you abundantly.\n\nRadio Programme\n\nA new contract has been signed with Top Radio (TOP MEDIA GROUP). We still appeal to you to help by paying the full contract price for us to enable us to reach as many listeners as possible. We were able to reach as many as about Fifteen (15) to Twenty (twenty) people a week. We visited two homes a week to teach and instruct.\n\nWe thank our Lord God for these activities. We pray that He gives us strength all the time to work more.\n\nReport by E.O. Larbi, Director\n\nEnd of February 2024 Operating Report, BVBI Accra\n\nIntroduction\n\nGod has been good and merciful to us.

He is married with 2 children. He has recently completed his master's with Bear Valley Bible Institute, also working as an Evangelist. We have observed from him that he is sound in the doctrine and has a passion for teaching. He is with a media group, chariot TV which educates the church and public in the way of the Lord. He has endorsed the doctrinal position of the school and taken up the teaching responsibility with the school.\n\nNumber of Instructors\n\nCurrently, we have ten (10) instructors of which two (2) are mentoring to take over from the aged.

Larbi\n\nEnd of January 2024 Operating Report, BVBI Accra\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is with much joy for a new year.

The administration, teaching, non-teaching staff, and the student body, all thank God for His merciful love, protecting, and providing for our needs throughout the past years.

Recruitment campaign is ongoing through visiting the local churches and seminars.\n\nCLASS ACTIVITIES\n\nClasses have begun with their instructors as mentioned above. All the students are participating well.\n\nEVANGELISM\n\nTract Sharing Campaign at Nsawam Market\n\nMondays and Thursdays are market days for this town. As part of our evangelism activities, the school and the campaign team have decided to share tracts during these days.\n\nAs we prepared for this evangelism, we prayed to God for His guidance in the crowd for a successful event.\n\nWe took three boxes of the tract with the title Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth and other mini booklets. The marketplace was big enough that we could not cover a quarter until the tracts were finished. The activity was so interesting that some of the market women devoted their time for us to share the gospel with them. Some were astonished that our message was new to them. Most questions were asked on tithing “Is it Biblical to pay tithe” and “What is the truth church of the Bible and the direction if they want to visit them.”\n\nHaving accomplished the mission, we have decided to speak to the administration on our next tract-sharing campaign, we shall mount speakers and horns and preach while others walk through sharing the tracts and dialogue with individuals.\n\nFurthermore, we found an old woman who introduced herself as one of the members of the church but was unable to find the location of the church. We tried to locate her house and introduced her to Brother Moses Edison who was a past student and an evangelist at Ayigbe Town church to fellowship with them. A sad moment was when some of the members confessed their withdrawal from the church. We had time to dialogue with them to have a change of mind to restore.\n\nSURVEY ACTIVITIES FOR CHURCH PLANTING\n\nSome of the campaign team members and Sammy went out to survey areas to plant churches. We went to Paanor which is to our New School Building Project. We spoke with the chief of the town about the upcoming campaign and gave us the right hand to start the work. He introduced to us a piece of land at a cost of C50,000.00 near the road when we were ready to plant the church.\n\nWe also went to Akotuakrom in the Eastern Region where we found four (4) members of the church who complained about the cost of proximity. They were happy to hear about our mission in the town. However, we have decided to plant the church in this town in March 2024. We also introduce the school to the man who has been a member for two (2) years to think about coming to study the word to handle the church in his town.\n\nSTUDENT’S PROFILE\n\nBrother Silas Adjei has recently completed his courses and waiting on graduation. Silas is 27 years old, he is single, and a preacher at the Medie Ketewa congregation. Silas is a hardworking young man who loves missionary work. He is part of the campaign team of the school. This man always attends the Top Radio campaign with E.O. Larbi on Tuesdays. He reads the Twi Bile during the radio programme. He also helps the office of the school.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe thank God for His protection throughout the Month. Keep praying with us.\n\nReport by E. O. Larbi.\n\nBear Valley - Accra\n\nOperating Report for November 2023\n\nWe thank God for a successful month of November 2023. We are grateful for His grace and guidance in all our activities.\n\nClass Activities\n\nThe following classes were conducted in November:\n\n- Bro Gyasi-Quansah taught the last short course on world religion and denomination doctrines. The students learned about the history and doctrines of various religious groups and denominations and how to respond to them biblically and logically.\n\n- Bro Kojo Acquah Beenyi met the second batch of Bachelor’s students on congregational development. Six students were present and they discussed the challenges and opportunities of developing and growing a congregation in the contemporary world.\n\n- Bro Samuel Sasu Ntim taught Elementary Greek where he delt with areas such as Greek alphabets, vowels, diphthongs, breathing marks, and syllabification. The students appreciated the introduction to the original language of the New Testament and its relevance for biblical interpretation and exegesis.\n\n- Bro E. O. Larbi also taught the Book of Revelation and Christian Ethics. The students explored the apocalyptic genre and symbolism of the book of Revelation and its application to the church today. They also studied the ethical principles and issues that Christians face in their daily lives and how to make moral decisions based on the word of God.\n\nExams and Research\n\nThe students took their exams at the end of the quarter and submitted their research papers on various topics. The lecturers graded the exams and papers and gave feedback to the students. The results showed that the students performed well and demonstrated their understanding and skills in their respective courses.\n\nVisitation to our Students' Churches\n\nBro Samuel Sasu Ntim visited two churches for the last quarter at Pakro Road and Fotobi. He observed the worship services and the activities of the churches. He also interacted with the members and the leaders of the churches. He reported that the churches faced some challenges such as leadership issues by some old brethren at Pakro Road and the numerical growth of the the church. Also, the Fotobi congregation is challenged with a noisy environment due to five instrumental churches circling the brethren. This has made four baptized members difficult to worship. He also offered some suggestions and solutions to resolve these challenges. He encouraged the churches to remain faithful and steadfast in the Lord. A relocation is ongoing for Fotobi church for comfortable services.\n\nTalk with Past Students\n\nWe had a great and successful talk with our past and present students. We had a good turnout of our alumni who came to share their experiences and testimonies. Bro Keith spoke to us about Bear Valley policies; the importance of continuing education and lifelong learning. Bro Emmanuel Amoo-Gyima taught us about the role of the preacher in the church and society. Bro Kojo and Bro E. O. Larbi also made good contributions to the discussion. We were inspired and motivated by the words and deeds of our past students.\n\nWorking on Campaign for New Students\n\nWe are working on a campaign to recruit new students for the next academic year 2024. Currently, we have six outstanding applicants who have expressed interest in studying with the school. We are following up with them and providing them with the necessary information and guidance. We are also planning to conduct some campaign activities in the following places: Tamale, Pakro Road, Fotobi, and Akotoshi. We hope to reach out to more potential students and persuade them to enroll in the college.\n\nRadio Campaign\n\nThe college has been conducting a radio campaign to promote the college and the gospel. The director, Bro E. O. Larbi has been delivering interesting and edifying lessons on the radio. He has made a great impact in advertising the college and solving counseling problems. He has also brought many people to know Christ through radio messages. We thank God for this opportunity and we pray that more souls will be saved through this medium. However, the college still needs more funds to sponsor the radio campaign. We appeal to all our brethren and well-wishers to support us in this endeavor.\n\nWe will need (GHC 48,000.00) Forty-Eight Thousand Ghana Cedis to continue this programme when the contract ends next year April 2024 apart from transportation. We still need your kind donations both in cash and in prayer.\n\nSchool Bus\n\nWe are finding it very difficult in our campaigns and visitation because of the non-availability of school bus. The bus facilitates our movement in preaching and teaching, and wish a new bus is acquired. Hope to help find funds to purchase a new one next year.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe thank God for a fruitful month and the safe return of Bro Stephen Ashcraft.

Larbi\n\nDOBORO – ACCRA\n\nREPORT FOR SEPTEMBER, 2023\n\nClass\n\nAs this month marks the end of this third quarter for our 6th batch students, we are grateful to the Lord for bringing us so far. All courses were successfully completed with all exams and quizzes. All students took part in the exams without challenges. Currently, we are on vacation and hoping to resume on October 1, 2023.\n\nFurthermore, we were grateful to the Lord for the safe arrival of our dear brother Steven in Accra. He met with the bachelor's degree students on examination on Greek 1 and reading Greek 2.\n\nDuring the vacation, Sammy had a class with the Nsawam Extension School on computer studies where the students were introduced to the Digital Library which was promised and programmed by Keith and Steven. The students were very happy with it as they had never dreamt of having such a library. According to them, this has made it easy for their research work. Their request now is that it could be accessed in their various schools and wherever they find themselves.\n\nMoreover having met with some of the bachelor’s degree students, Sammy introduced them to the digital library on how it could help them in their research assignments.\n\nThe administration is preparing to introduce the Digital Library to our present students and the alumni during the upcoming “TALK” with Keith and the staff.\n\nIntroducing our new evangelism team and request for P. A. System for our campaigns\n\nSome students added to the Evangelism Team:\n\nWe are fortunate to have these brethren who have dedicated themselves to team up for campaigns of which Brother Wisdom Yirenkyi is the coordinator. Currently, three students who will be completing their Diploma programme in December 2023 have been introduced to this ministry and are willing to dedicate themselves to this task. These dedicated brethren are Ebenezer, Asante, and Silas. These men stay around and are already in the field and are taking part in the radio programme of which E.O. Larbi is currently preaching. Having met, we decided to organize internal and external campaigns in areas under survey.\n\nAs part of our campaign plan, we have organized house-to-house, info center preaching, public preaching, and tract distribution programme. We are also planning to organize children or teen Bible classes in the community where the school is located.\n\nAll schedules for the programme will be communicated in due course.\n\nStudents Profile\n\nOne outstanding student by Name Fredrick Owusu is on this day presenting him on our profile. He is married to Gladys Owusu and is blessed with two (2) children. The family are members of the church of Christ located at Bediako Michel Camp – Tema, Greater Accra. His effort is helping the church grow spiritually and numerically. At present, he is ministering to two hundred and twelve (212) members.\n\nHe is one of the best students whose participation and attendance in class is marvelous. He is serious with his class, campaign activities, social services, and motivating his classmates.\n\nHe is one of the benevolent students who has dedicated himself to providing and serving the students and the staff breakfast each morning because of his cooking skills.\n\nThe school has appreciated his effort in the ministry and services to the school and we pray that the Lord grant him knowledge and good health to serve the Lord.\n\nReport by E.O. Larbi\n\nAccra Monthly Report, August 2023\n\nGlory be to God for another month ending in success. We are always grateful to our God that He began with us and ended in peace. Our Lord has done greater things in us as He provides with our needs in times of crisis yet in all things He encourages us to hold firmly to Him in the doctrine and our way of life. To report to you the challenge of health challenges as our brother Gyan-Mante is challenged with mild stroke, Kojo with consistent health challenges, and Sammy. We glorify God for how far He has brought us and we are praying for healing and good strength.\n\nCLASS ACTIVITY\n\nRegular class\n\nAll the instructors are endeavoring to complete their courses with their exams and quizzes followed by the school’s campaign program.\n\nMaster’s Program\n\nAs with their normal class, they met for two (2) weeks with Brother Jerry Bate on the course, World Religion. Eleven students participated in the program.\n\nCAMPAIGN\n\nDoryumu follow-up\n\nAs we reported in our previous report for our next campaign location, Duayedeng, Paanor, and its environs, we saw the need for another place in Doryumu to embark on follow-up evangelism to strengthen the church and to restore some of the fallen brethren which commenced on 14th to 20th August 2023. Our past student, Philip Abruquah is the Evangelist for this church. Our students both rescent and past students, the Legon University campus church, Nsawam Road congregation, and the host brethren together, did work on campaigning both day and night preaching for one week. The campaign was successfully completed and the Lord added to the church with six baptisms.\n\nWe thank God for this successful occasion in strengthening us throughout the week. We pray that the new members will be strong in the Lord until He comes.\n\nBear Valley Top Radio Program\n\nWe are always proud to be preachers of the gospel of Christ and supporting the program with our funds. As we always report to you, the radio program keeps yielding fruit. Almost every week after preaching, we have numerous calls and private calls for further studies. As we reported in our previous reports, we are also invited to different places to help in teaching and counseling most listeners on some of the topics that were not clearly understood by them (listeners) and other social matters bothering them. This program has further sent messages on the advertisement of the school to brethren who are showing interest in attending the school. We have three prospects who are willing to pick forms to register for the academic year.\n\nThis month we had one baptism in addition which took place at Nsawam Road church.\n\nMode of funding the program\n\nWe are grateful to our Lord who has endowed us with understanding in the ministry. The staff of the school is doing well to sacrifice some amount from their monthly allowance, an amount of four hundred cedis each to pay the monthly installment of three thousand cedis for the ongoing preaching work.\n\nWe are using this medium to inform you of the wonderful work the Lord is doing in this program.\n\nWe will be also grateful to receive your contribution to this programme.\n\nWe request that you pray with us.\n\nEnd of June Report, Accra\n\nGlory be to God for a successful ending. Through His providence, all activities went on successfully, none of the instructors experienced ailment, and everyone is doing well and kicking.

The school vacated on 11th June 2023 and resumed on 2 July 2023 respectively.\n\nBachelor’s programme\n\nCurrently, we have two (2) batches pursuing the programme i.e. Bachelor One (1) and Bachelor Two (2). The second batch met on the 16th and 17th of June and studied Advanced Hermeneutics One (1) by Brother Emmanuel Amoo-Gyimah. The class was very interesting enlightening everyone, on the way of interpretation.\n\nOn 22nd June, the first batch also met to study Advanced Hermeneutics Two (2) by Emmanuel Amoo-Gyimah.\n\nCampaign Plan\n\nIn our previous report, we reported about the campaign held at Twerebo and Botokora. The next plan is to revisit the towns once again to check on the impact of the gospel preached. We shall also focus on the other two towns closer to the school site thus Duaeden and Paanor. It is our greatest hope that our visit to these towns will yield fruit for the Lord.\n\nWe are also planning to have information centers built in these towns to facilitate our preaching programme.\n\nBear Valley Top Radio Programme\n\nWe are much impressed to have you updated on the wonderful works of God. Our listeners keep calling even when on campus and in our homes. Others also come in to request the audio to listen once again. We also added books such as Voice of the Truth with our stamp and contact, to be shared freely with anyone who is interested to read out the truth. Through these calls, some prospects have received counseling regarding the load of frustrations and challenges on their neck. Through this counseling, a man who planned suicide due to massive challenges has repented. This depicts that many love and appreciate the truth. We always pray that our radio programme will convert more souls in various places to the glory of God.\n\nWe plead with you to keep remembering us in your prayers.\n\nTalk With Our Past Students\n\nAs part of the school’s planning activities, the staff has been meeting to find a day in November 2023 to meet with all students for the purpose to strengthen them to hold firm the doctrine of Christ which they received during their schooling. As we know that our Lord is well pleased when we keep to His instructions.\n\nAt this time, Brother Keith will be passing by and will stop over to speak more of the way of Christ and the rules of Bear Valley in America before leaving for other countries. We are looking forward to his safe arrival.\n\nWe hope the Lord will bring our brother safely to Ghana and we are praying that this programme will be successful and yield good fruits.\n\nMonthly College Report - May 2023\n\nWe praise God for His wonderful works in the month of May 2023. We acknowledge His presence and direction in all our endeavors. Here are some of the major activities that we engaged in during the month.\n\nAcademic Activities\n\nThe second quarter of the academic year which commenced on April 9 has been going on smoothly and is expected to end on June 9. We have been busy with academic work and practical evangelism. The students and staff have demonstrated enthusiasm and excellence in their studies and work.\n\nGospel Campaign\n\nWe conducted a gospel campaign in Twerebo, a town in the Eastern region near the new school project. During our visibility study, we found out that about 98% of persons cohabitating and native of Ga. These made communication very difficult. Sammy had some knowledge of the language yet he struggled much to communicate in this language. Also, due to multiple marriages and cohabitation, they found it difficult to repent in that state. Sometimes, the ladies fear giving in to baptism because they might be beaten by their men. Others also wait to hear permission from their spouse. Due to a local festival, we were not allowed to preach publicly or use loudspeakers. We opted for door-to-door evangelism and personal contacts. We did not record any baptism or restoration, but we sowed seeds of the gospel and hope to follow up later. On Sunday, we were given one of the rooms of the Anglican School building for the meeting. On our next meeting on Sunday, the Pastor of the Anglican church ceased us from using their facility for meetings. Since then George and Sammy have been visiting the village on Saturdays to evangelize.\n\nThis has been my first time encountering such challenges in evangelism and have been very sad yet, I am much grateful that as we keep on with our weekly visitation, some are coming back to their senses on what we have told them.\n\nMoreover, we are planning that Sammy with the students will take over their information centers to further explain the need to deny the world and come to Christ after the town’s local festival. I strongly believe that God will make a way for His chosen people.\n\nSchool Building Project\n\nThe construction of the wall around the school compound is completed. The wall will ensure security and safety for the school property and personnel. We thank God for the generous contributions of our supporters and partners who have made this project possible.\n\nRadio Programme\n\nThe college has started using the opportunity to preach on the radio. The director, Bro E. O. Larbi who initiated the programme with an engaging lesson on the radio has made a great impact in promoting the college and addressing counseling issues, and also bringing people to know Christ. We have received positive feedback and inquiries from listeners who want to know more about the gospel and the church. We still need more funds to sponsor the programme and reach more souls.\n\nWe thank God for a fruitful month and for the safe return of Bro Stephen Ashcraft who visited us in May. We appreciate his support and encouragement. We also thank all our supporters, partners, friends, and well-wishers who have been praying for us and supporting us in various ways. May God bless you all.\n\nMonthly Report - April 2023\n\nWe begin this month's report with gratitude to God for another successful month at our college.

The courses taken within these periods were four: The Life of Jesus, Pre-existence, Birth, and Early Ministry; The Plan of Redemption; Christian Evidences, and Old Testament 2 (The Old Testament History).\n\nNew chairs were bought for the school\n\nWithin this period of the third quarter, the Coordinator, Mr. Kojo Acquah, and his team presented to the school, Accra East, twenty-five new chairs. The students were very happy when they saw the new chairs. The chairs were very beautiful, well-designed, and comfortable for students' studies. It has beautified our lecture hall. The leadership of Nmai Djorn Church of Christ (Accra East Campus) was also grateful and expressed their appreciation to the school since the chairs will also be used by the church for worship.\n\nBaptism\n\nThe students started applying the evangelism methods studied in June 2022. The good news is that it has started yielding good results. Isaac Acquah one of the students, who worships at Ashalley-Botwe Old Town church, started the method in their visitors class and within this quarter he has converted four people. The joyful thing is that out of these four baptized people, one of them is his wife. Isaac was so delighted because for some years he and some brethren have made several attempts to win his wife to Christ but to no avail. For all these years Isaac was using a confrontational style, by arguing and condemning his wife because she was attending a different church. This time Isaac reversed his tactics and changed from confrontational and\n\ncondemnation to dialogue. This has yielded a good result and as a result, his wife has given herself for baptism on 25th September 2022.\n\nJohn Achie Quophy is the preacher of the Boi church of Christ. He also recorded two baptisms. He did both teachings. The two baptisms occurred in August and September 2022.\n\nReport on the students\n\nThe students’ performances were very encouraging. They were very committed to classes. They were punctual and regular. In addition to this, they also responded to class tests and discussions. There were a few who, because of their job schedules, were not able to attend classes regularly.\n\nThe average attendance for this third quarter is twelve. Currently, I have total students of eighteen. One of them, Vincent Tamatey had a motorcycle accident and has not yet recovered fully. To sustain the students and also to make Bear Valley Accra East one of the effective schools, I encourage them and advise them to take the courses seriously.\n\nHouse-to-House Evangelism\n\nWithin this period, some of the students were sent to Gomoa Asebu-Pomadze for house-to-house evangelism and edified the new church planted by Nmai Djorn church of Christ which was supported by the students of Bear Valley, Accra East. The fallen brethren within those two communities were targeted so we were able to locate some and talked to them. By God’s grace some were restored back to the fold and as a result, have increased their church attendance.\n\nOn 23rd-25th September 2022, eleven Accra East students went to Gomoa AsebuPomadze for house-to-house evangelism. In the same way, they also edified the church. This is the second time we have gone there in our numbers. However, what we are lacking is follow-up. Since Nmai Djorn church of Christ, which is the main sponsor of these projects, does not have the financial strength massive and effective evangelism is still lacking. Some of the students who took part in the third evangelism at Asebu-Pomadze were, Benjamin Forson, John Achie Quophy, Daniel Nkansah, Akwasi Mamah, Moses Antobam, Isaac Larbi, Cecil Larbi, Da-costa Asare, etc. On Sunday 25th, the Bible class and the sermons were handled by Benjamin Forson and John Achie Quophy. The people of Gomoa are the largest indigenous Fante groups in the Central Region of\n\nGhana. Their communities are divided into three districts, Gomoa Central, Gomoa East, and Gomoa West. They have many communities with vast lands. Some of their communities are growing at a fast pace, but sadly many are growing without a church of Christ. So it is for this reason that we have focused our evangelism in Gomoa Central, particularly the communities which share borders with Winneba and Swedru. We hope God will bless this mustard seed to grow to yield more churches of Christ in those communities.\n\nThe Projections\n\n1. I have planned to work hard so that more students will be enrolled as students of Bear Valley to acquire training to be able to conform to the image of Christ. Also to help defend, advance and uphold the true gospel of Christ.\n\n2. I have designed a program on how the two churches I have planted (Nmai Djorn church of Christ and Santor church of Christ, in Greater Accra) will organize joint worship once a year to raise money to support the rural evangelism of the students of Bear Valley, Accra East.\n\n3. It is my plan that if God gives me life, I will ensure that the church of Christ will be planted in all the fifteen communities across Winneba and Swedru road (in Gomoa Central).\n\nAccra Report\n\nReport on activities and programs for the month of August\n\nDuring this month, classes were ongoing. Ten students were present during the studies, except one who was absent due to family challenges. This student will be reseating all the courses for this quarter as required by the schools’ regulations. All instructors did well in the teaching activities until the completion of the research assignment.\n\nLectureship in Koforidua\n\nBoth weekend schools, the regular class, the ministers, and past students from the surrounding churches attended the three (3) day lectureship. The theme for the lectureship was Seeing the Big Picture. The program was more practical on evangelism. Eighty-eight were present for the lectureship. We are grateful to God for the success of the program, seeing the Big Picture and looking at the message from beginning to end. The brothers who facilitated the program did an outstanding job. It was Biblical and good and we commended the work done by them.\n\nBACHELOR’S CLASS\n\nWe had Bachelor’s class taught by Steven Ashcraft who took them through the introduction to Elementary Greek. This was to pre-equip the students, to be knowledgeable with the alphabet, ascent, breathing marks, syllabification, and parts of speech before the next class on Greek 1. About fifteen students were present for the course.\n\nCAMPAIGN PROGRAMME AT NIC\n\nAs part of our program this quarter, we gathered at Ablekuma NIC congregation to partake in a one week house–to–house and public preaching campaign. The community was very interactive during the gospel presentation. They attended in good numbers and contributed to the many questions asked after the presentation. We had no baptism yet, but we promised to pay a visit to study more.\n\nTHE WVBS VIDEO\n\nThis video has been handy to the school. Through this material, the Nsawam Adoagyiri congregation uses it for their Teen Bible Teachers in their classes. The brethren really enjoy using it in their studies. This is because the instructors teach in clarity and understanding. The teen class has learned How to Read the Bible and now to study How we got the Bible. They have been very grateful for these lessons and really appreciate the effort and the cost of the material.\n\nDIRECTOR’S VISIT TO STUDENT’S CONGREGATION\n\nThe Director, Bro. E.O. Larbi visited a student (Bro. Yaw Boadu) and was assigned to teach the congregation Marriage, Divorce, and Remarrying for the month of August. The church was full to its capacity during the second, third, and fourth weeks. Three visitors who were invited to the church were baptized during the period.\n\nStudent’s Profile\n\nWe also introduce our student John Acquah. A young man of Twenty-seven years old, and a student at the University of Education. He is single. He has been in the faith for a couple of years. He preaches for the Batanyah congregation and was admitted to the Bear Valley School this year, 2022. He has been very good in academics and fluent in evangelism and teaching activities. He is also helpful, humble, and willing to serve when he is called on a mission. He has been one of the students who we send to help the rural churches in the central region.\n\nThe school is very grateful for such brethren. We always request that you remember our students in prayer so that they may be well enlightened as all instructors strive to teach the doctrine of Christ.\n\nWe also appreciate the willful giving for the support and your prayers. God richly bless you.\n\nReport by E. O. Larbi"
