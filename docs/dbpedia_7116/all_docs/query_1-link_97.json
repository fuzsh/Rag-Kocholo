Bartels said that the various Presidential Special Initiatives were meant to encourage private enterprise.\n\nGovernment also believe that the private sector should be involved in the activities of the public sector so that there will be cross-fertilisation of skills and technical know-how, he said.\n\nHe said the concept of public private partnerships was one option worthy of consideration which could make more investment funds available to the government. We need to look at other innovative ways to provide service to our people quickly, but not necessarily through the orthodox budgetary allocation, he said.\n\nBartels noted that evolving a strategy for public private partnerships, Ghana would need to learn from the experience of other countries. He suggested that the proposed National Procurement law should be fashioned such that it would address the issue of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).\n\nThis is because procurement and tendering are an important ingredient in the implementation of PPPs. The concept of PPPs is now being implemented world-wide, and so far there is no rigid framework to such all circumstances. It is essential that in Ghana we develop our own set of guide lines to assist us in the implementation of the concept.\n\nThere may indeed be the need to pass legislation in the regard. We also have build expertise in the public sector so that it would be able to negotiate individual project agreement with private sector companies, he said.\n\nE. A. Kwakye, Chief Director of Ministry of Roads and Transport said the Public Private Partnerships projects must be client-driven instead of investor-driven.  Ghanaian Times\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nNavrongo Central by-election underway\n\nNavrongo (Upper East) 25 March 2003 - Residents in the Navrongo Central constituency have started voting to elect a new representative in Parliament. Four political parties  NDC, NPP, DPP and PNC are vying for the seat, which became vacant after the death of the MP for the area, John Achuliwor.\n\nUnlike previous elections where the contest has been a straight encounter between the main opposition NDC and the ruling NPP, the PNC has emerged as a major contender for this seat.\n\nThe partys candidate, Gabriel Pwamang is perceived as a great threat to the NPPs aspirations of maintaining the seat. The NDC which has also been complaining about the NPPs over-exploitation of incumbency is hoping for a landslide victory.\n\nThe NDC is confident that its candidate, Clement Bugase is poised for victory. Meanwhile, the DPP candidate, Grace Bogoniah has unofficially pulled out of the race, asking her supporters to vote for the NPP candidate, Joseph Adda.\n\nJOY FMs reporter in Navrongo says Madam Bogoniah has explained that her entrance into the race was to introduce herself to the people in preparation for other elections. - Myjoyonline\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nCastle to gag Special Assistants\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 25 March 2003 - The office of the Chief of Staff has expressed grave concerns about recent statements by Government Spokespersons and Special Assistants without due authorization and consultation. A source at the office told the ''Network Herald'' that their actions had often embarrassed and exposed the government and other sector ministers to unwarranted criticism and public ridicule.\n\nThe source suggested like personalities like Kwabena Agyepong and Kofi Amponsah Bediako should have been fired for speaking to the press without due consultation but have been left off the hook for strategic reasons.\n\nKwabena Agyepong came under fire last week for reacting to a story in the ''Ghana Palaver'' that President Kufuor spoke to President Bush on phone and declared Ghanas support for the war against Iraq.\n\nThe Presidential Spokesperson denied the story, but the Chief of Staff, Kojo Mpiani sent a statement condemning Agyepongs reaction. In view of this development, Government Spokespersons and Special Assistants would be confined to their original concept and made to operate within defined scope.\n\nThe source said ''even though they are not officially recognized as Civil/Public servants, they would now be compelled to operate mostly within the scope of the Code of Conduct for such officers.\n\nThe Code, among others, categorises the powers and functions of scheduled officers, the type of information to handle and pass on to the general public while respecting the official Oath of Secrecy of the Service. - Network Herald\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nProbe dismissed DCEs  Atta Mills\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 25 March 2003 - The Flagbearer of the opposition National Democratic Congress, Prof John Atta Mills has urged government to probe the dismissed District Chief Executives (DCEs) rather than letting them off the hook. President Kufuor on Monday 3 March, this year relieved three DCEs of their portfolios.\n\nThey were Ketiboa Blay of the Jomoro District in the Western Region; Kofi Wilson of the Mfantsiman District in the Central Region and Sam Baidu Kelele, Jasikan District in the Volta Region.\n\nLater reports showed that the District Chief Executives were relieved of their posts on the grounds of inefficiency, maladministration and alleged acts of corruption. But nothing has been heard from the President since then.\n\nThe NDC Flagbearer says since the government believes in the zero tolerance for corruption policy, it would be improper for the alleged corrupt officials to be merely dismissed without putting them before a court of justice.\n\nHe noted that the inefficiency, incompetence and corruption in the NPP government has contributed to its inability to better the lot of Ghanaians.  The Crusading Guide\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nControversy over Inflation Rate\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 25 March 2003 - The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Ghana is still not decided on the figure for the rate of inflation for the Month of February. Today is the second working day after the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank failed to officially announce the rate of inflation.\n\nThe figure which is normally announced after the quarterly meetings of the committee saw a new twist when the 9-member committee could not agree on a figure following perceived inaccuracies inherent in the data provided by the Statistical Service which pegged the inflation rate at 29.4 per cent.\n\nBut as the monetary experts try to resolve the problem, a new dimension has been brought to the whole drama with a ''Daily Graphic'' report that the Minister of Integration and Regional Cooperation, Dr Paa Kwesi Nduom himself an economist, has said that the inflation rate is around 16 per cent and not 29.4 per cent.\n\nSome economists have expressed concerns about the figure of 29.4 per cent, although they believe that the rate of inflation have gone up since the petroleum price increase in January. The inflation rate for January was 16.3%.\n\nThe onus now lies on the Monetary Policy Committee made up of technical experts including the Governor of the Bank of Ghana to work diligently to come out with accurate and uninfluenced figure.  Myjoyonline\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nSupreme Court dismisses application\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 25 March 2003 - The Supreme Court has dismissed an application for review of a case in which it unanimously revoked the 1989 Will in respect of the late Ackah Blay Meizah estates.\n\nThe court presided over by Mrs Justice Joyce Bamford-Addo dismissed the case on the grounds that the applicant, Dr John Robert Kells has not satisfied Rules 54 of Constitutional Instrument (C.I.) 16 for him to successfully obtain a review of the matter. The court did not award any cost to the respondent, Dr Ebenezer Ako-Adjei.\n\nThe six other Justices of the court, Justice A.K.B Ampiah, Justice F.Y. Kpegah, Justice G.K Acquah, Justice W.A. Atuguba, Mrs Justice G.T. Wood and Justice Dr Seth Twum gave the unanimous decision on 18 March this year.\n\nThere has been controversy surrounding the late Ackah Blay Meizahs will since his death more than ten years ago. The Supreme Court on the 24 October 2000 ruled that a 1988 will tendered by the late Dr. Ebenezer Ako Adjei is ''entitled to probate.''  Myjoyonline\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nFraud at National Lotteries\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 25 March 2003 - The Department of National Lotteries (DNL), one of Ghanas major revenue generating agencies is seriously mired in maladministration and fraudulent transactions.\n\nIn the course of investigations into the activities and administration, the ''Crusading Guide'' says it chanced upon a summary of Audit Report which revealed that the amount spent so far on the construction of its (DNLs) new office block has risen from ¢5.4bn to ¢31.675bn as at 31 December 2002.\n\nIt is estimated that the total cost of building ''Fortune House'' - on completion in December 2003, will be ¢50bn. The decision to put up the 5-storey building was taken in 1995 and was expected to be completed within 27 months but this had not yet materialized.\n\nAccounting for the astronomical increase in the cost of Fortune House was the uncompetitiveness in the selection of the main consultants. They were said to have been handpicked by the former Director of DNL, Col Martin Gbikpi. This, according to the report resulted in collusion and misappropriation of funds.\n\nContract fees were fraudulently inflated in the guise of ''fluctuation claims'' and in some cases payments were made on contracts that had not been signed.\n\nRegarding the maladministration, the Report indicated that the Department had been taking important decisions in the disbursement of large sums of money without reference to the Ministry of Finance. - Crusading Guide\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nArmed Forces enter into partnership with USA\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 25 March 2003 - The Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) and the United States of America have entered into a partnership known as African Contingency Operations Training Assistance (ACOTA) programme to enhance the capacity of the GAF to respond to peace support and humanitarian operations in peace-keeping operations.\n\nAccording to a release issued and signed by the Lt Col E.W. K. Nibo, Director, Public Relations of the GAF, the ACOTA programme succeeds the African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI).\n\nThe statement said the programme is aimed at realising within the GAF the capacity for self-sustainment, particularly in the area of ability to train its own military contingents proceeding to United Nations peace missions and other peace support activities in collaboration with ECOWAS or at the request of the Government of Ghana.\n\nAs part of the current training event, GAF has received materials to enhance training for peace support operations. The equipment includes personal gear as well as unit equipment which include communication and office supplies.\n\nAccording to the statement, the programme which covers a period of 13 weeks, is taking place concurrently at the Budase Training Camp, and the Signal Training School at the Burma Camp.\n\nThe statement explained that the ACOTA programme puts considerable emphasis on training the trainer. It said selected personnel of GAF drawn from various units are undergoing training in peace-support operations.\n\nThe trained personnel, the statement said, will in turn serve as resource persons to provide training to deploying contingents for UN operations, the immediate attention being on those to be deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe statement said the US Ambassador to Ghana, Ms Carlin Yates, handed over the equipment and also paid a familiarisation visit to the training school.  Daily Graphic\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nAbodakpi's case continues\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 25 March 2003 - John Prempeh, Controller and Accountant General (C&AG) on Monday told an Accra Fast Track Court that monies were transferred from the Bank of Ghana to various banks after the Trade and Investment Programme (TIP) had ended.\n\nHowever, Prempeh stated that he had no document to confirm that monies disbursed at the end of TIP represented interest accrued from the programme.\n\nThe C&AG was answering questions during cross-examination in a case in which Daniel Kwasi Abodakpi, ex-Minister of Trade and Industry and Victor Selormey, for Deputy Minister of Finance are being tried on seven counts of conspiracy to commit crime, defrauding by false pretences and wilfully causing a total loss of 2.73bn cedis to the State.\n\nThey have denied all the charges and are on self-recognisance bail in the sum of three billion cedis each. Prempeh who was being cross-examined by Charles Hayibor, Defence counsel stated that he did not know when the interest account of TIP was closed.\n\nCounsel: TIP fund ended in 1997? Witness: I can't confirm that, unless I crosscheck with my files.\n\nThe prosecution witness explained that the TIP fund was part of the Consolidated Fund, which comprised of the commitment and non-commitment accounts. Prempeh, however said monies under the two accounts were supervised by the office of the Auditor-General.\n\nCounsel: Tell the court the procedures governing the interest account.\n\nWitness: I don't know.\n\nCounsel: Tell the court on the procedures governing the utilisation of the interest account of TIP fund.\n\nWitness: I don't know because I am not involved in the disbursement of the committed accounts.\n\nHayibor ended his cross-examination but stated that he did not know whether Johnny Quarshie-Idun and Barima Manu counsel for Selormey had questions for the witness since they were absent.\n\nA few minutes later, the court was informed about Manu's illness.\n\nThe court presided over by Justice Stephen Farkye, an Appeal court judge, sitting with additional responsibility as the High Court Judge adjourned the matter to 31 March at the instance of defence.  Ghanaweb\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com\n\nReturn to top\n\nCommission stands by story\n\nAccra (Greater Accra) 25 March 2003 - The Energy Commission (EC) says it still stands by a Daily Graphic report on 8 March 2003 that Sonnidom Energy of Achimota was closed down because it was under-delivering by 0.2 litres to the motoring public.\n\nThis means that the station was selling 4.3 litres instead of 4.5 litres, which is a criminal offence.\n\nIt also stated that Sonnidom has only been granted a provisional licence to operate as oil marketing company but the station in question, which used to be under GOIL, has not been licensed and, therefore, does not have an operating licence.\n\nThis is against Section 54 (b) of Act 541 establishing the commission and that the allegation levelled against the commission is an attempt to ridicule the inspection initiated by the commission to protect the Ghanaian motorist against cheats in the petroleum retail business.\n\nThe Public Affairs Manager of EC, Mrs Irene Nyantekyi-Owusu, who stated this in an interview in Accra at the weekend, expressed shock at the statement by Sonnidom that the operation by the EC was a witchhunt.\n\nShe was reacting to an advertisers announcement by Sonnidom in last Thursdays edition of the Graphic denying that the station was closed down by the EC because it was under delivering by 0.2 litres and also had no licence to operate as a filling station.\n\nIt would be recalled that two fuel filling stations in Accra were closed down for altering their pumps to cheat customers.\n\nThe stations are Achimota Goil Filling Station and Sonnidom Filling Station, also at Achimota, which were closed down when officials of the EC in a surprise check caught attendants of the stations selling 4.3 litres to customers instead of 4.5 litres.\n\nMrs Nyantekyi-Owusu said, By a letter of 14 March 2003 Sonnidom has only just applied for an operating licence and this can be verified.\n\nWhen asked why the company should still be allowed to operate, although it has no operating licence, she said that the commission did not insist on continuous closure because it wanted this to serve as preliminary warning to the company.\n\nSonnidom was reopened after officials of Ghana Standards Board (GSB) inspected and calibrated their pumps.\n\nMrs Nyantekyi-Owusu challenged claims by the filling station that an independent institution re-checked the pumps in the presence of GSB officials and found them to be over-delivering.\n\nShe said the commission cannot accept this assertion, more so when the commission did not reopen the station with GSB as stated, even though it gave the go-ahead after GSB had re-set the pumps to the right level.\n\nThough the GSB is authorised to certify dispensing pumps, as the sole regulatory body for energy in the country, the commission has the responsibility to enforce these standards, especially when allegations of impropriety have been levelled against officials of the GSB by a section of the media, she stressed.\n\nMrs Nyantekyi-Owusu said the container used to measure the fuel was a measuring device made available to it by the Tema Oil Refinery and had been properly calibrated.\n\nShe announced that the commission, in collaboration with GSB, will continue to mount unannounced checks on petroleum retail outlets on a regular basis to flush out cheats in the industry.  Daily Graphic\n\nSend your comments to viewpoint@ghanareview.com"
