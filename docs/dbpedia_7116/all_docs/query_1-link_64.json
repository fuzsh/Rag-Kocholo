On the basis of archival evidence, it explores the changing role of the institute in the making of Nkrumahism as public discourse and documents the evolving relationship between the universalism of Marxism-Leninism and the quest for more local political iconographies centred on Nkrumah's life and work. Secondly, the article analyses the individual motivations and experiences of a sample of foreign lecturers. The article suggests that ideological institutes offer insights into the processes by which official ideologies were created and disseminated, a foil through which to interrogate the usages and appropriation of social sciences education, and a window onto the multiple ways in which local and foreign agents negotiated their identities and political participation in African socialist experiments.\n\nKeywords\n\nGhanaEducationIdeologyPolitical CulturePostcolonialSocialism\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nThe Journal of African History , Volume 60 , Issue 3 , November 2019 , pp. 407 - 428\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S002185371900032X [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Cambridge University Press 2019\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

Nkrumaism. Indeed, all the three initial definitions proposed by the KNII shared the notion that Nkrumaism was ‘SIMPLY SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM THE PATTERN OF WHICH [sic] IS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL AND DIALECTRICAL [sic] MATERIAL CONDITIONS OF AFRICA’, PRAAD, RG17/1/380, No. 1 Definition of Nkrumaism, No. 2 Definition of Nkrumaism, No. 3 Definition of Nkrumaism.\n\n70\n\n70 Jones, Ghana's First Republic, 61.\n\n71\n\n71 Ahlman, Living with Nkrumahism.\n\n72\n\n72 See especially K.

This also includes a list of students who are ‘above average’, presumably referring to Addison's 1964 proposal of starting a three-year programme for particularly striking students, Nkrumah's Subversion, 46. In contrast with the two-year programme, admission to the three-year Bachelor in Political Science required a ‘High School Certificate or its equivalent’, PRAAD, RG 17/1/440, Director's Report, 2.\n\n77\n\n77 The most significant exception is the memoir by the Czech philosopher Evzen Menert, who favourably compared his Winneba students to their counterparts in Prague, Menert, E., Na západ od Londýna: nepříliš souvislé vyprávění o Ghaně a okolí, přerušované zcela nesouvislými úvahami o doplněné ódou na bridž, anglický kolonialismus, pivo a armádu (Prague, 1967)Google Scholar.\n\n78\n\n78 Authors’ calculations based on PRAAD, RG 17/2/30. Addison declared that the students totalled 75 in 1962–3, 133 in 1963–4, 239 in 1964–5 and 260 in 1965–6, PRAAD RG 11/1/148/6, Letter from K. Addison to the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Science and Higher Education, 1 Dec. 1965. An alternative estimate claims that the institute enrolled 100 students in 1962, 210 in 1963, and 475 in 1964, Nkrumah's Subversion, 46.\n\n79\n\n79 PRAAD, RG 11/1/148/6, Letter from K.

Indeed, Consciencism’s treatment of categorial conversion shares some similarities with Engels's discussion of the first law of dialectics, ‘The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa’. This, in turn, was derived by G. W. F. Hegel, as noted in Engels, F., Dialectics of Nature (Moscow, 1954), 83Google Scholar.\n\n95\n\n95 PRAAD, RG 17/1/384, ‘Categorial Conversion’ (Pat Sloan), 2–3.\n\n96\n\n96 PRAAD, RG 17/1/384, Letter from P.

This qualifies the depiction of Addison as an ‘honest man’ and a disinterested pioneer of African unity presented in Budu-Acquah, K., Toll for the Brave: Tributes to Fallen Comrades, Part One (Accra, 1988), 14–16Google Scholar. Addison is depicted as a ruthless party man in Lacy, Rise and Fall, 223. Although it goes beyond the scope of this paper, the gendered dimensions of power relations governing life at the KNII merit further research. Addison remarked that he wanted to relax the political admission criteria for women (from members of ‘the Party and its integral wings’ to ‘all walks of life with sound Party back-ground’), to encourage them ‘to share fully in the national reconstruction’, PRAAD, RG 17/1/440, Director's Report, 2.

Tehoda, who taught physical education, went to Ghana after being imprisoned and tortured in connection with the assassination of Sylvanus Olympio in 1963; Condé, M., Mets et merveilles (Paris, 2015), 47–8Google Scholar.
