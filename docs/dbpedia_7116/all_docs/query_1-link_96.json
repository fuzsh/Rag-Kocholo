        "text": "Felix had his primary school education at Etche in Rivers State; while he lived with late Chief M. O. Ogbuagu. On return from study leave, the late Rev. Canon H. O. D. Chiwuzie was posted to St. Augustine’s Grammar School, Nkwerre ; and as God would have it, late Felix was offered an admission for secondary education at St. Augustine’s Grammar School, Nkwerre, and the late Rev. H. D. O. Chiwuzie sponsored his secondary education. Felix’s academic records revealed excellent academic performance in secondary school from 1952 to 1956. One of the classmates and as well as bosom friend of Felix, the Venerable Herbert U. U.

Urban and rural workers, unable to afford expensive imported gin, became the patrons ofakpeteshie. For urban workers,akpeteshiecame to underpin an emerging popular culture.Akpeteshiedistillation threatened the colonial government&#39;s prior dependence on revenue from imported liquor, raised the specter of crime and disorder, compromised colonial concerns about urban space, exposed the weakness of colonial rule and eventually led the British government into the embarrassing diplomatic position of seeking an alteration of the Sai..."
