        "text": "Independence Day marks the declaration of Ghanaian independence from the British colonial rule. This day is an official state holiday for the citizens of Ghana both within and in the diaspora to honour and celebrate the Heroes of Ghana who led the country to attain its independence. Apart from Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, one of the Heroes who intellectually and patriotically paid his dues towards the present Ghana is Dr. Ebenezer Ako-Adjei.\n\nDr. Ebenezer Ako-Adjei was a nationalist politician from Ghana. Ako-Adjei is considered to be one of the Big Six. The Big Six are arguably some of the most famous people in Ghana‚Äôs fight for independence from British rule. In the history of Ghanaian politics Adjei can be said to be the John the Baptist. For it was through him Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah brought back to Ghana to lead country to Independence. It all happened in the middle of 1947, when at one meeting of UGCC, the view was expressed that a time had come for the movement to have a full-time General-Secretary.\n\nAdjei who had been a pioneer in the formation of the movement was voted by the meeting to take up the post because he had in mind plans of establishing a chain of newspapers in country as well as looking forward to successful private legal practice. He declined the offer and instead recommended Kwame Nkrumah, whom he met and worked with at Lincoln University, Philadelphia and in the WASU London, as the best person suited for the post. That this suggestion by Ako Adjei was most crucial for the country‚Äôs heist was sustained by fact that when Nkrumah came to take over the Secretary Generalship of the UGCC, he jolted the movement into action and through that he became the foremost leader in the struggles which won independence for the country and for many other African countries.\n\nCareer:\n\nFrom June 1937 to December 1938 he was a Second Division Clerk in the Gold Coast Civil Service. He was assigned to assist Harold Cooper, a European Assistant Colonial Secretary, and J. E. S. de Graft-Hayford to organise and establish the Gold Coast Broadcasting Service. These were the beginnings of what is now the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nIn December 1938 he resigned from the Gold Coast Civil Service to travel to the USA to attend Lincoln University, Pennsylvania. At Lincoln University he was housed at Houston Hall. He registered for courses in Political Science, Economics, Sociology, English, Latin and Philosophy.\n\nTogether with a group of students they often had long heated discussions (known as Bull Sessions) about the emancipation of African countries from colonial domination. Among the African students who regularly took part in these discussions were Ako Adjei, Mr. Nkrumah, K. A. B. Jones-Quartey, Ozuomba Mbadiwe, Nwafor Orizu and Mr. Okechukwu Ikejiani.\n\nHe was instrumental in introducing Dr. Kwame Nkrumah to the political scene in Ghana and Nkrumah later became the first president of Ghana. However, in 1962 President Nkrumah had him imprisoned.\n\nHonours:\n\n1962 ‚Äì Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws from Lincoln University, USA\n\n7 March 1997 ‚Äì Officer of the Order of the Star of Ghana ‚Äì the highest national honour of the Republic of Ghana.\n\nLegacy:\n\nThe Ako Adjei Interchange in Accra, which used to be Sankara Interchange, was renamed after him. There is also an Ako-Adjei Park in Osu, Accra.\n\nLater Life and Death:\n\nOn the eve of his release from the Nsawam Prison in 1966, Ako-Adjei completely forswore politics. He spent the remainder of his long life in relative obscurity. Ako-Adjei died in Accra on 14 January 2002.\n\nFavourite Quotes:\n\n‚ÄúGhana is our country. We have nowhere to go. This is where God has placed us and the earlier we realized this the better for all of us.‚Äù\n\nCompiled By; Hanson Kwamena Andy Edited By; Arthur Kwame Philip\n\nTRYA_Patriotism_Monday\n\nTRYA_Heritage_March\n\nThe_Youth_Must_Rise\n\nFor God And Countryüá¨üá≠üá¨üá≠"
