        "text": "Derrick Rose is at the center of the basketball universe. It's a few days before Christmas in 2011, and the shy, 23-year-old point guard finds himself in the middle of a suburban Chicago shopping mall as throngs of fans scream for his attention. A few hours earlier, the Chicago Bulls formally announced that they have signed the reigning MVP to a max extension worth close to $100 million. The future was bright for one of the NBA's most prominent\n\nWhen thinking of basketball, what is it that we really think of? Just a ball, a basketball court, and final scores? Do we take the time to think of players who made this sport really famous and made a huge impact on it? Did you know that the very first NBA game Scottie Pippen ever saw was the first NBA game he played in.\n\nIn 1984, after he won the championship at North Carolina, Michael Jordan was signed to a five year endorsement deal by Nike. The contract was worth about 2.5 million dollars. A lot of people were very judgmental because of the huge endorsement given to a rookie. I am surprised as well because in this day and age, a company would never do that. However, because Michael Jordan had so much skill, he made all of the skeptical people eat their own words.\n\nA person that Interest me is Kevin Durant. He is one of the best basketball players on the golden state warriors team. He’s 29 years old and is 6’9. I don’t know him much but I want to get to know him better, here is a couple facts about him: he as born on September 29, 1988, he went to University of Texas at Austin, and one other thing I know about him is his full name it’s Kevin Wayne Durant. One other thing I know about him is that he played for the Thunders for Oklahoma City , then switched to the Golden State Warriors.\n\nRussell Westbrook is a point guard, who has been playing for the Oklahoma City Thunder. He was born on November 12, 1988 and is currently 27. Russell is a very quick, and explosive player, he loves to attack the rim. He's also a great shooter, he leads the NBA with tripe doubles. A triple double, is when you get 3 double digit stats. Russell gets assists, rebounds, and points. He's a 5 time NBA all star, 2 time NBA all star MVP , NBA scoring champion and he made the NBA All-Rookie team. In 2012 he made the NBA championship game, and played against the Miami Heat. They lost and Lebron James won MVP.\n\nThe name Antetokounmpo has thirteen letters and six vowels. This name is hard for many people to pronounce. Do you know where the The Greek Freak got his name? Well, he got his name from Greece since that’s his home country.\n\nAbdullah Alqatami Miss Perger English 11 6 March 2015 The successful American Dream Kobe Bryant and Lance Armstrong have both been proven best at what they do for a living. Kobe Bryant will always be thought of as one of the biggest mistakes for the Los Angeles Lakers, but over his life time he is proven best at achieving his goals and begging successful. Kobe Bryant's personality and hatred was earned and not given. He is one of the most hard working basketball players on this earth.\n\nMichael Jordan is considered the G.O.A.T ( greatest of all time) in basketball and my opinion is the same as every other sports watcher because Michael Jordan compared to LeBron James is kinda unfair because look at their NBA championship ratio. Michael Jordan is 6 for 6 everytime he goes the the finals and lebron is 3 for 7 in the finals and that just proves who's more clutch in bigger games and on every team lebron has been on he’s had a nba all star and michael jordan had 0 when he first started and made his teammates so much better, that they turned into all stars because michael jordan worked with them constantly. Michael jordan is a team player and he doesn’t just focus on scoring for himself he looks for teammates to be open and get the assist.\n\n“I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow. I just know for sure I'm going to keep playing basketball,” professional basketball player Kevin Durant was quoted as saying. As a successful figure in the basketball world, Kevin Durant shows that any dream can be achieved from hard work and dedication. This hard work can also guide you to achieving the American Dream just as Durant has done. That being the case, Kevin Durant would exemplify the American Dream from his success in his basketball career, his high budget, and the ownership of a house.\n\nOn October 4, 1957 in New York City a future black success was born by the name of Russell Simmons.

At the age of eight Simmons and his family moved into another home in the Hollis neighborhood. Their new home was near a notorious corner in that neighborhood known as a place for drug dealers and users to meet and make\n\nAlthough it is true that Kobe Bryant was charged with sexual assault, companies are willing to endorse him because he was proven not guilty by law. Does this make Kobe Bryant a risky partner to be an endorser for a company? I would say so, but than again, anyone would be a risk. I think the reason why people are still willing to endorse Kobe Bryant is because they are willing to take that risk. The reason why many companies are willing to take that risk is because Kobe's fame and success only continues to grow. I don't mean to say that he has found success because of his past sexual assault charge, but his success in the NBA has only continue to improve even after the ordeal. Kobe Bryant is considered to be one of the best to ever play\n\nThe person I decide to do my psychology study on is Dennis Roman, I decided to pick him to do my study would is because he is well known to have a lot of psychological problems.

Not everyone is fortunate to have a privileged childhood; Dennis Rodman was one of the unfortunate ones.
