        "text": "Gloria Ann Hammel, age 75, of Monroe, peacefully passed away at the Monroe Hospice Home, on July 12, 2024.\n\nGloria was born November 21, 1948 in Freeport, IL, to Harry and Paula (Howarth) Ehrler. Gloria graduated from Elizabeth, IL High School in 1967. She was united in marriage to Stephen Hammel on September 23, 1978. Following her marriage, Gloria operated a Home Day Care for 15 years, worked as a waitress, and was employed in food service for many years before retiring from Culver’s in New Glarus.\n\nGloria’s family and friends were extremely important to her and she was well known for always doing special things for loved ones on their birthdays and holidays. Gloria loved meeting friends for coffee, attending movies, dining out, spending time with her kids and grandkids and accompanying them to Disney World. Gloria also had a true love for dogs and the family was never without at least one, if not two, dogs.
