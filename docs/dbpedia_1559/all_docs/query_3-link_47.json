        "text": "Most people have a fascination with the extreme. And personally, I can’t blame them.\n\nI also want to know which building is the tallest in the world, and what kind of chili pepper is the spiciest.\n\nUnfortunately, the reality is often way more complex than your average internet clickbait site will have you believe.\n\nStill, I think it’s possible to find the answer to the question everybody has pondered sooner or later:\n\nWhat is really the best coffee in the world?\n\nIn this article, I’ll dive into that rabbit hole. And I will come back up to the surface equipped with plenty of statistics to back up my claims.\n\nHave you ever heard the term ‘coffee geek’? Well, this post is not for those vanilla guys.\n\nThis is for the ‘coffee aspie’.\n\nIf you want to know what the top coffee bean in the world truly is then read on. Below is the TL;DR version. Read on, for the full analysis.\n\nThe top-rated coffee beans\n\n#1: Panama\n\nNo matter how you analyze it, the rare Geisha bean from Panama comes out on top.\n\nPanama Geisha is most frequently used among winners of the World Brewers Cup.\n\nThe rare Geisha beans are also consistently the most expensive coffee at auctions.\n\n#2: Ethiopia\n\nEthiopia is right on the heels of Panama when looking at the statistics.\n\nThis isn’t a big surprise, since Ethiopian coffee, especially the stuff from Yirgacheffe, tends to be a favorite among coffee professionals.\n\nEthiopian coffee has many of the same qualities as Panama Geisha but for a fraction of the price.\n\n➡️ Try some delicious Ethiopian coffee from this roaster\n\n#3: Kenya\n\nKenyan coffee is bold but at the same time delicate. It often has flavor notes such as raspberry and blackberry.\n\nSL 28 & 34 — the two varietals most commonly grown in the country — are high performers. On average, only Geisha coffees are scoring higher.\n\nHow did we reach our conclusions?\n\nGoing into a discourse about being the ‘top something’ will always represent a challenge.\n\nWhen laymen say something like “Indonesian coffee is the best in the world”, they are being imprecise.\n\nThere’s a range of different varieties grown in that country, and the coffee can be processed in many different ways.\n\nNot to mention, Indonesia is a vast country (It has around 16.056. islands according to the UN!), so there will be a lot of variations in terroir across places such as Java, Bali, and Sumatra.\n\nA combination of all these aspects will have a massive impact on the final flavor of a given coffee.\n\nMost likely, Indonesia produces some lots of coffee that are extraordinary and some that are below average. So how do we quantify the output and compare it to other countries?\n\nWhile it’s interesting to see where in the world the top coffees come from country-wise, we need to be precise. As an example, it would also be nonsensical to say that ‘French wine is the best in the world.’\n\nClearly, there will be a gigantic difference between a generic $5 Vin de Supermarché and a bottle from the famous Chateau Lafite Rothschild.\n\nInstead, we will have to look at a combination of all the factors below to get a meaningful understanding:\n\nVarietal\n\nOrigin\n\nAltitude/farm\n\nProcessing method\n\nTop coffee countries\n\nLooking at coffee countries from the perspective of quality is eye-opening. Most people will already have some notions of what constitutes ‘the top origin’ and this data seems to back up the general consensus.\n\nNot surprisingly, Panama comes out ahead with 29 samples placed in the 96 or above position. This isn’t that strange since most of the prestigious Geisha varietal is grown in this small Central American country.\n\nFollowing right in the heels are Ethiopia and Kenya, with 28 and 27 top-scoring coffees, respectively.\n\nThese are the two major countries of African coffee, and they are both renowned for producing quality.\n\nThe biggest surprise is to see that Hawaii is placed as number 4. While Kona coffee is generally seen as good (albeit overpriced!), it’s rarely exported to Europe. Instead, there is a big market for Hawaiian coffee in Japan, and of course, in the US. Since this is where many of the roasters who submit samples to Coffee Review are based, there is most likely some kind of bias in the data.\n\nRead More — The Top Coffee Country: Panama\n\nRead More — Runner Up: Ethiopia\n\nBrazilian coffee is about quantity and not quality according to the data (Fernando Mafra | Source)\n\nBRAZIL IS LACKING QUALITY\n\nColombia and Indonesia are the following countries on the list with four top-scoring samples.\n\nBoth these countries export huge quantities, the former being more famous for quality than the latter. If we just go by this data, that is slightly unjust.\n\nA bunch of esteemed coffee countries have never managed to get any samples in the top position so far.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the two biggest producing nations in the world, Brazil, and Vietnam, are included in this ‘hall of shame.’ So are smaller origins like Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, Burundi, and Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe conclusion, according to this list, is that you have to focus on the “Big 3”; Panama, Ethiopia, and Kenya, if you want to source the best coffee in the world as they are far ahead of all the other origins when it comes to producing standout coffees.\n\nRead More: Is Brazilian coffee overrated or underrated?\n\nTop tasting coffee type\n\nWhen it comes to variety one thing is immediately clear: Geisha is superior. Almost 18% of the submitted samples of this varietal landed in a cupping score range of 96-100. Across the board, it outperforms all the other varieties; It has more samples on the top and fewer on the bottom.\n\nOther interesting findings:\n\nThe varietal Pacamara is sometimes compared to Geisha but in this study, only 2.22% of the cupped beans managed to get the highest score. The two Kenyan varieties SL28 & SL34 managed to score significantly higher, and Bourbon also beat it narrowly with 2.38%.\n\nAnother interesting trend to notice is that Typica seems to have more quality issues than other varieties. More than every fifth submitted Typica sample scored under 89 points. This is quite bad – even when we compare it to other bread-and-butter specialty coffee beans such as Caturra, Catuai, and Bourbon.\n\nIt would be interesting to focus more on Ethiopian coffee in this section, but even though coffee from this country is generally called a ‘heirloom’ it’s not considered to be a single genetic variety by agricultural scientists.\n\nGeisha from Colombia is available on Amazon\n\nthe top rated coffee producers\n\nLike I have mentioned before, comparing countries and varieties is a bit like comparing apple pies and oranges.\n\nSo let’s try to be a bit more specific in our analysis. Let’s look at the producer level. While there are many famous coffee farms in the world, there are two coffee estates that tower above the rest:\n\nHacienda La Esmeralda\n\nNinety Plus\n\nThe geisha revolution\n\nHacienda La Esmeralda is a farm whose history is interwoven with the varietal Geisha.\n\nGeisha was initially found in the Ethiopian forest region of Gesha (sic). In the 1930’s, it had been brought to Kenya and Tanzania to grow more disease-resistant crops. In the 1950’s it arrived in Costa Rica and, a decade later, in Panama. You can read the whole story about Geisha coffee here.\n\nIn its new surroundings, however, the plant was quickly forgotten and lived in obscurity for years. That changed in 2004 when the family owning Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama re-discovered the varietal by coincidence.\n\nThe second estate worth mentioning is Ninety Plus, which is also based in Panama (the company also sources in Ethiopia). The name refers to the high scores the coffees are supposed to achieve at the cupping table.\n\nNinety Plus has made a brand name for itself by supplying coffee to a range of recent World Brewers Cup winners.\n\nThe Top quality estates\n\nThese two estates have had almost the same amount of samples submitted to Coffee Reviews; 52 and 51, respectively.\n\nWhen analyzing the scores distribution, it immediately becomes apparent that both companies produce exceptional coffee. 81% of Ninety Plus’ coffee scored 93 or above, while the number for la Esmeralda was 84%. The total average of all samples submitted to Coffee Review scoring 93 or above was only 30%.\n\nA staggering 22% of the tested coffees from La Esmeralda even scored between 96-100. For Ninety Plus, the total number was 14%. It should be noted that these stats include the Ninety Plus coffees from Ethiopia. If we filter out the African beans and just look at the brand’s coffee from Panama, it’s a stalemate between the two elite producers.\n\nFor the average coffee, the result is only 1.77%.\n\nA selection of Panamanian coffee at the Taipei Coffee Expo (Source)\n\nThe Top Countries according to statistics\n\nTake a closer look at the statistics in the boxes below. Please note that all these stats are gathered and structured by myself and that they are my personal interpretation of the data from Coffee Review. Any errors are my responsibility solely. Please also note that this is an ‘inquiry’ and not an actual scientific study.\n\nCountries\n\nVarietals\n\nEstates\n\nKopi Luwak vs Geisha vs Average\n\nKopi Luwak vs. Geisha\n\nA surprising number of people outside the coffee industry believe in the kopi luwak myth. The story goes like this: The best and most expensive coffee in the world is produced by collecting the dung of a coffee cherry-eating animal named the Asian Palm Civet.\n\nIn fact, kopi luwak is pointless animal cruelty. Caffeine affects the civets the same way it affects humans. And too much is not suitable for anybody. The animals are trapped in small cages and are force-fed just to meet the demand of gullible tourists, who think it’s good coffee.\n\nSo how does the kopi luwak coffee compare to ‘real’ top-rated coffee? Not favorably, according to the stats.\n\nIn the 21 years coffeereview.com has existed, only 14 kopi luwak coffees have been submitted.\n\nUpon closer inspection, four of these are not ‘true’ Luwak coffees. Instead, they are washed premium coffees where a cultivated strain of bacteria from the Asian Palm Civet has been added during the fermentation stages to increase flavor potential.\n\nThese gimmicks don’t seem to have any effect at all. None of the submitted luwak coffees have ever reached the coveted bracket of coffees scoring between 96-100 on Coffee Review.\n\nOn the contrary, kopi luwak, on average, scored lower than the typical kinds of arabica coffee, such as Typica, Caturra, and Catuai.\n\nLearn More: Why Cat Poop Coffee is Shit\n\nCompetition coffee\n\nMatt Perger at the World Barista Championship (Iain | Source)\n\nAnother approach to finding the most outstanding coffee in the world might be to look at what coffees have been used by the winners at the most prestigious coffee competitions in the world.\n\nAt these competitions, the flavor of the coffee only makes up one part of the score. The performance of the barista also counts.\n\nStill, when you think about it, it’s a helpful way to determine what’s the elite coffee in the world. The baristas at these competitions are incredibly dedicated professionals – they have already beaten other skillful baristas at the national championships to qualify.\n\nWhen entering international competitions, they often have financial support from the coffee shops they represent. They’ll be able to utilize almost any whole-bean coffee they consider to be the most outstanding and fantastic.\n\nGEISHA DOMINATES – AFRICA STRUGGLES.\n\nThe results at the World Brewers Cup, where contestants duel on the ability to brew black coffee manually, are very much in alignment with the findings in the previous section.\n\nOut of seven competitions, the winner has used Geisha in five. Another exciting trend to notice is that the last four years’ winners have used coffee from Ninety Plus.\n\nBrewing drip coffee and pulling espresso shots are two fundamentally different brewing styles.\n\nThis is also showcased in the results at the World Barista Championship. Here we see that only the 2016 champion, Berg Wu of Taiwan, uses Geisha as the single origin beans for his espresso machine.\n\nThe other winners use mostly washed coffees from Latin America.\n\nWhen trying to understand the broad trends at the tournaments, a couple of things stand out:\n\nOnly one winner has used a coffee from Africa (Ethiopia)\n\nSo far, nobody has ever won any of the top tournaments using coffee from Asia.\n\nThe Geisha variety is well represented with 6 out of 14 possible victories.\n\nThe last 4 (!) winners of the World Brewers Cup have all opted for whole bean coffee from Ninety Plus.\n\nA selection of Ninety Plus green beans (Source)\n\nThe most expensive coffee in the world\n\nSo far, we’ve been looking at many metrics that have to do with taste. But maybe there is a better way to assess how good coffee is. In a globalized, capitalistic world such as ours, the market value of a particular coffee could be a helpful way to determine the ‘best coffee.’\n\nSo what IS the most expensive coffee in the world?\n\nBefore we get into that, let’s wait a minute and address the elephant or the civet in the room:\n\nYou have probably heard stuff like ‘kopi luwak is the most expensive coffee in the world.’ Or maybe you have googled the question and stumbled upon a listicle telling you that ‘a particular elephant version’ of kopi luwak is the one.\n\nNo matter what kind of product, it holds a certain allure to be ‘the most expensive in the world.’ You are almost guaranteed free publicity, as well as a handsome profit.\n\nScrupulous marketers have exploited this for ages. That’s why you see stuff like gold-dipped sneakers.\n\nAUCTION PRICES\n\nIn my opinion, the optimal way to judge the actual value of something is to see how much-informed buyers are willing to pay at an open market, where there is as little information asymmetry as possible.\n\nThat’s precisely what coffee auctions represent. For instance, most buyers participating in the yearly ‘Best of Panama’ auctions are professionals. They know the general market price of different varieties from different farms. The bidding history is entirely open, so they can even go back and see what cost a coffee from the same farm fetched the year before.\n\nIn my research for this article, I haven’t found any similar auctions selling Kopi Luwak or other ‘animal’ coffees. Sure, I have found individual retailers with shady websites selling overpriced beans, but I haven’t verified that they are selling it to repeat customers or bulk buyers.\n\nThat leads me to categorize the claim as being the ‘most expensive coffee in the world’ as incorrect.\n\nThe real ‘most expensive coffee\n\nThe coffee that is generally considered (by pros) to be the most expensive one ever is a natural processed Geisha from Hacienda la Esmeralda called ‘Cañas Verdes’. It was sold for $60,100 last year on the ‘Best of Panama’ auction.\n\nThis equates to a price of 601 dollars for a pound of green coffee – the highest rate ever paid for a coffee in an auction. Before that, the record was $350 for a pound – also from Hacienda la Esmeralda.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for green coffee to be sold for 3-4 times the price after it’s been roasted.\n\nFor instance, the Cañas Verdes, also nicknamed ‘Esmeralda 601’, was sold for $55 a cup (15 grams) by Klatch Coffee in California.\n\nUpdate: At the ‘Best of Panama’ auction on the 20th of July 2018 a new world record was set: $803 per pound!\n\nThe coffee was a natural processed Geisha going by the name ‘Elida Green Tip Natural’. However, this time the winner was the ‘Lamastus Family Estate’ – a farm that has been owned for 100 years by the family of the same name.\n\nThe Lamastus Estate actually broke two records on the same evening: A lot of their washed Geisha fetched an impressive $661 per pound.\n\n(Screenshot from the auction)\n\nConclusion\n\nLooking at the ‘best coffee in the world’ debate from a more statistical side, it’s clear that Geisha from Panama generally gets exceptionally high scores at the cupping table.\n\nIt’s also the coffee of choice at the different coffee championships – especially Ninety Plus has been successful during the recent decade.\n\nFurthermore, Geisha lots from Hacienda la Esmeralda and the Lamastus Family Estate have fetched the highest prices ever paid for coffee in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\nWhen we take all this into account, there’s only one clear conclusion:\n\nThe best coffee in the world can be found in Panama, more precisely at the Geisha farms of Ninety Plus, Hacienda la Esmeralda & the Lamastus Family."
