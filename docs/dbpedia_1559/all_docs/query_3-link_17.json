        "text": "Abbe-Koenig prisms add weight and size. And provide better light transmission in return. Do these prisms offer any other benefit besides transmission?\n\nLooking at Vortex Razor UHD 10x42 on allbinos, the measured light transmission is 86.5%. Why is it lower than other Schmidt-Pechan binoculars like Conquest or Monarch HG?\n\nWhy carry all the weight if there isn't a clear advantage in light transmission from the design using Abbe-Koenig? What am I missing?\n\nAbbe-Koenig prisms give:\n\n1. Better transmission (about 3% IIRC). Used to be important when coatings were less advanced.\n\n2. Offset eyepieces. Can help reduce minimum IPD for large aperture binoculars.\n\n3. Bragging rights. This cannot be quantified but is clearly important to some people.\n\nIn a modern top-end binocular, coatings are good enough that the human eye cannot normally see the transmission difference between SP and AK prisms. But weight and bulk differences can be felt and seen.\n\nTransmission in binos can range from 80% to 90% depending on the coatings, whereas AK can only add 3% versus SP. So for handheld binos many manufacturers decide AKs are not worth the weight/bulk/cost tradeoffs, instead they invest in better coatings. For mounted binos, porro prisms are a more effective way to reduce minimum IPD, are easier/cheaper to build to high quality AND have even better transmission. So small binos are SP, big binos are porro. AKs are a niche product.\n\nAbbe-Koenig prisms give:\n\n1. Better transmission (about 3% IIRC).

This cannot be quantified but is clearly important to some people.\n\nYou forgot that AK prisms don't need any reflective coatings on the prisms. They rely on total internal reflection which is more efficient than any reflective coating.\n\nYou also didn't mention that SP prisms pose some special difficulties: Seil, Konrad (1991): Progress in Binocular Design. In: Proc. of SPIE Vol. 1533, Optomechanics and Dimensional Stability, ed. R A Paquin, D Vukobratovich (Dec 1991). Konrad Seil was the designer of the new generation of Swarovski roofs at the time. Cf. also the discussion of Schmidt-Pechan prisms in Merlitz, Holger (²2019): Handferngläser. Funktion, Leistung, Auswahl. Europa-Lehrmittel, Haan-Gruiten, p. 58-61.\n\nHermann"
