        "text": "Sandra A. Horn, age 82, of The Town of Brooklyn, died Tuesday, May 21, 2024 at the SSM Monroe Hospice Home. Sandy was born in Green Bay, WI before the family moved to Oshkosh and then Hales Corners. She graduated from Bay View High School in 1959 where she was on the swim team. She was employed in the treasurer’s office at Allen Bradley Co. when she met Dick Horn dancing at Muskego Ballroom while he was home on leave from the U.S. Coast Guard. She worked her way through college starting at Marquette, UW Milwaukee, and graduating from UW Madison with honors and a degree in education. Sandy and Richard married and farmed near Waunakee for two years. During that time they welcomed their son, Douglas. They moved to Green County, near Monticello in 1966. Kathleen joined the family shortly after and Sandy established her expertise in the business of farming while raising both kids. In 1970 they moved the final time to the Attica area where Sandy quickly developed friendships with the neighbors, and they welcomed Eileen.\n\nThroughout her life, Sandy was a person who was comfortable with being a leader and also a helper. She served on the boards of Green County Human Services, ADRC, USDA, FHA, and St. Patrick’s Catholic Church in Albany. She was also the President of the Albany School Board for several years and was the first woman to serve on the Mt. Pleasant Perry Mutual Insurance Co. board of directors. She volunteered for Turner Hall, the Green County Fair, Green County Ag Chest, and as a 4-H club leader. She was also an active member of the Modern Makers Homemakers Club. Many local people remember her with her Gerry carrier backpack that she wore in her child-rearing days. All three kids, when small, were on her back when she was doing chores, calves, shopping, etc. Through 4-H she was involved with Labo, a Japanese group that promoted youth exchanges between the U.S. and Japan. She hosted folks from Japan, Germany, and South Africa. In her later years she worked off the farm, but also in agriculture with World Dairy Expo as a Dairy Cattle Coordinator. She enjoyed going to all of the events of her six grandchildren. When she wasn’t doing business or service she loved travel. She visited many countries and states with Dick and her sister Pat. Of course, we can’t forget dancing. Sandy loved dancing with the love of her life, Richard. They were often found together on the dance floor or in the kitchen.\n\nShe is survived by her husband of 59 years, Richard Horn of Brooklyn; son, Douglas (Jessica) Horn of Brooklyn; daughter, Eileen Horn of New Glarus; six grandchildren, Trevor (Rachel), Lillian, Kaitlin (Ben), Benjamin, Ivy, Michelangelo; great granddaughter, Joanna; son-in-law, Dale Ripley; sister, Patricia Carlson of Green Bay; brother, Robert (Val) Liebeck of Kewaunee, WI; and two nephews and one niece. She was preceded in death by her parents; daughter, Kathleen Ripley; niece, Cheryl Carlson; and brother-in-law, Ed Carlson.\n\nA memorial mass will be held on Friday, May 31, 2024, at 11:00 a.m., at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church in Albany with Father Joseph Bellamkonda officiating.
