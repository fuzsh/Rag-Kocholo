They lived in the South Wayne area their whole life. They farmed for many years on the Chapman homestead just south of town. She stayed home to raise five children. Later in life she worked as a teacher’s aide at Black Hawk with students that needed one on one teaching. She gave them that motherly love and they thrived. She worked at numerous businesses in Monroe. Deli Manager at Pic N Save, Alp and Del, Swiss Colony and opened her own cheese store in Mount Horeb. One of her best qualities was being a mother and grandma. The love she had for her grandchildren was beyond incredible. Then she became a great-grandmother and became even more loving.\n\nMert and Cal have always had an open-door policy. Being third oldest of 7 brothers she was a mother figure to most of them. Rumor has it that Emil Seffrood moved into their apartment before they returned from their honeymoon. Her brother Gary Seffrood lived with them growing up with her children. Taking in numerous teens thru the years that stayed for an extended time. Jim Lehman (Squawk), Jeff Meyer (Spriket), Chuck Brady, and Doug Busch to name a few. All still loved like family. She never wanted anyone to feel alone in this world. Maybe the reason they stayed was because of her awesome cooking! You never left hungry when you left their house. The wood stove was always going strong to keep everyone warm. Sometimes a little too warm. They loved to travel taking many trips with Lester and Marjorie Mau. Her and Calvin loved feeding and watching the birds outside the window in the sitting room. Cardinals were her favorite bird to watch. Mert will be remembered as the best sister, wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother to all of us. She was a selfless, caring, and kind hearted woman and will be missed each and every day by her family.\n\nMert is survived by her husband, Calvin of South Wayne; son, Allen (LeeAnn) Melland; daughters, Julie (Mike) Vondra of Platteville and Lorraine (Scott Neuenschwander) Melland of South Wayne; daughter-in-law, Jill Melland; 13 grandchildren; 20 great-grandchildren; Barb Sanders (Phillips) was like her third daughter; brothers, Wesley (Rose) Seffrood of Chicago, Il, Emil (Shirley) Seffrood of Monroe, Ed (Shirley) Seffrood, and Gary (Linda) Seffrood all of South Wayne; sisters-in-law, Winogene Everson of Monroe, Juanita (Jeff) Kant of South Wayne, Carol Seffrood; Patricia Seffrood, and Dorothy Seffrood all of Monroe; and many nephews and nieces.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents; grandparents, Frederick and Mary Frances (Underhill) Seffrood; parents-in-law, Victor and Dorothy (Johnson) Melland; brother, Leroy, Elton, and Ivan Seffrood; brothers-in-law, Walter and his wife Lois Melland and Alvin Melland; sister-in-law, Muriel Holverson and her husband Roy Holverson, Marjorie Mau and her husband Lester Mau, and Romona Denure and her husband Kenny Denure; nephews, Joseph Seffrood and Kevin Holverson; great-nephew, Bryant Gabioud; and great-niece, Devon Gabioud.\n\nHer greatest loss in life was the death of her two children.
