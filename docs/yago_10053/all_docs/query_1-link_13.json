        "text": "FUBAR, a new spy-adventure action-comedy created by Nick Santora, is now available on Netflix. The series, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, features color by Tony Dustin and sound mixing led by Alan deGraaf.\n\nFUBAR follows Luke, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, and his daughter Emma, played by Monica Barbaro, who have lied to each other for years, both of them not knowing the other is a CIA operative. Once they both learn the truth, they realize they know nothing about each other.\n\nTo mark the launch of the new series, Alan and Tony sat down with Post Magazine to talk about providing color & sound services on FUBAR.\n\nTony explains, “We designed a look to emulate a ‘90s Kodak film stock… There are two story elements or timelines where we have that action movie look for the secret spy stuff, and then a softer look for the normal life stuff.”\n\nA similar technique was used with sound, adds Alan, “As the series has two very different worlds, you have to differentiate between them using contrasting soundscapes, sometimes as subtle as chirping birds vs. high-tech command centers.”"
