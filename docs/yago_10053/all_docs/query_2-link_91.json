        "text": "The Oregon Ducks start the 2024 season Aug. 31 at home against Idaho. The Oregonian/OregonLive will count down the days with mini-profiles of prominent former and current Ducks whose jersey numbers correspond with the days remaining until the opening kickoff.\n\nToday, No. 23: Running back/wide receiver Ahmad Rashad and wide receiver Jeff Maehl.\n\n• • •\n\nAhmad Rashad\n\nBio: Rashad, born Robert Moore in Portland, graduated from Mount Tahoma High School in Tacoma, Wash., before heading to Eugene to play for the Ducks.\n\nSoon after leaving UO for the NFL, he converted to Islam and changed his name to Ahmad Rashad.\n\nRashad became a successful sports broadcaster following his playing covering both the NFL and NBA.\n\nRashad was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1987 and the University of Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nKey statistics: Rashad began his career as a receiver and wingback before moving to running back.\n\nIn 1969, Rashad caught 54 passes for 786 yards and 10 touchdowns (tied for fourth all-time with seven others). The following season, he moved to running back and rushed for 924 yards and six touchdowns while also catching 45 passes for 455 yards and five scores.\n\nIn Rashad’s final season, he rushed for 1,211 yards (13th all-time) and seven touchdowns and caught 32 passes for 324 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nRashad was named first-team All-Pac-8 three times and a first-team All-American in 1971.\n\nHis 249 yards on the ground against Utah in 1971 rank eighth in UO history. He also had 89 receiving yards in that game, giving him 338 all-purpose yards, tied for fourth in program history.\n\nRashad finished his career having set records for career rushing yards (2,306 yards), receptions (131), scoring (226), and all-purpose yards (3,898).\n\nHis points total currently ranks ninth all-time.\n\nNFL: The St. Louis Cardinals drafted Moore with the fourth-overall pick in the 1972 NFL draft.\n\nRashad played 10 seasons with four teams (seven in Minnesota) and was voted to the Pro Bowl four times with the Vikings, including 1979 when he was a second-team All-NFL selection.\n\nRashad finished his NFL career with 495 receptions for 6,831 yards and 44 touchdowns.\n\n• • •\n\nJeff Maehl\n\nBio: Oregon landed Maehl out of Paradise High School (California) where the three-star recruit scored touchdowns as a receiver, rusher, kickoff returner, punt returner and defensive back.\n\nMaehl began his career as a defensive back before moving to wide receiver.\n\nKey statistics: Maehl got his feet wet as a freshman in 2007 with 118 yards and a touchdown before becoming a starter in 2008.\n\nOver the next two seasons, he caught 92 passes for 1,015 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nIn 2009, against Arizona, Maehl caught 12 passes, tied for third in UO history.\n\nHe saved his best season for last when he caught 77 passes for 1,076 yards (seventh all-time) and 12 touchdowns (second all-time) for the 2010 Ducks, who went 12-0, won the Pac-10 conference, and reached the BCS National Championship Game.\n\nMaehl gained 133 yards on nine receptions in the championship game loss to Auburn.\n\nMaeh’s 34 consecutive games with a reception remains a program record. His 178 career receptions are tied with Samie Parker for the school record. Maehl’s career 24 touchdown receptions rank tied for second with four others.\n\nNFL: Undrafted in 2011, Maehl latched on with the Houston Texans as a rookie before signing with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2012 after former UO coach Chip Kelly took over. Maehl spent two seasons with the Eagles, appearing in 24 games.\n\n• • •\n\nPRIOR COUNTDOWN POSTS\n\nNo. 24: Running backs Kenjon Barner and Jeremiah Johnson\n\nNo. 25: Quarterback Norm Van Brocklin\n\nNo. 26: Running back Travis Dye\n\nNo. 27: Defensive back Terrance Mitchell\n\nNo. 28: Running back Jonathan Stewart and safety J.D.
