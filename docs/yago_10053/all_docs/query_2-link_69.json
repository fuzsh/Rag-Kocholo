        "text": "Relatives of knife crime victims in Reading have spoken out about the latest fatal stabbing in the town.\n\nPaul Spence, father of 17-year-old Robert Spence, who was murdered in 2008, said he was \"very shocked\" and \"angry\".\n\nJordan Malutshi, 17, from Clapham, south London, was stabbed in the heart at The Face Bar in the early hours of Sunday.\n\nMr Spence said his youngest daughter knew the teenager. \"She's upset,\" he said, adding that she used to see him in the Reading suburb of Whitley.\n\n\"It still makes me angry that this has happened,\" he added.\n\nHis son Robert, from Burghfield Common, left a club in Reading with six friends on 2 May 2008 and was stabbed while trying to break up a fight.\n\nMr Spence said a review of knife murder sentencing was needed.\n\n\"It should be an instant life sentence, nothing more, nothing less,\" he said. \"That would stop people carrying around knives.\n\n\"When I heard about it I thought, 'who is going to get the phone call that I got?'\n\n\"He died in a strange place miles away from home. It winds me up.\"\n\nLucy Davis, from Reading, whose brother Scott Davis was stabbed to death at the Oracle shopping centre in 2001, also said jail terms needed to be reviewed.\n\n\"Our brother's murderer was released after 10 years and he's out now,\" she said. \"So you can go out, kill someone with a weapon and be released.\n\n\"You take a life but you don't receive a life sentence.\"\n\nMs Davis led a campaign to increase awareness of knife crime at the time of her brother's death, but said \"nothing really has changed\".\n\n\"You campaign so hard to stop people carrying knives, what it can do and the effect it can have on families and yet people are still carrying weapons thinking it's OK to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"Metal detectors in clubs, are they using them? Knife crime education in schools? Something needs to change.\"\n\nFigures from the Office of National Statistics for England and Wales show that in 2011, 211 people were murdered by people using knives or other sharp, bladed instruments."
