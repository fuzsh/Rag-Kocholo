        "text": "Hello Dark Dabbers, please welcome SF writer Paul Spence to the blog today. We chat about heroes & villains, geeky stuff, books & movies, and plenty more. Enjoy!\n\nIf you could, what book/movie/TV series would you like to experience for the first time all over again and why?\n\nOut of the Dark, by David Weber, because it was then that I knew I could do better.\n\nWhat has been your worst or most difficult job? How does it compare to writing?\n\nWorst or most difficult job? Most of them. Anything monotonous that keeps me from thinking? Worst Job? Ditch digger. Writing is more stressful, but more rewarding.\n\nWhat book should be made into a game (card, PC, board, etc.) and why? Is there a specific character who you would want to play in this game?\n\nOther than mine? Seriously, I’d love to play a Fallout-type game set in my universe(s). Other than mine, Skyrim done Dragonriders of Pern style.\n\nWho are your non-writer influences?\n\nNon-writer influences? What is this thing you speak of?\n\nWhich ancient or historical works have you not read and periodically kick yourself for not having made time for them yet?\n\nGilgamesh. I haven’t made time for it yet. I need to.\n\nWho are some of your favorite book villains?\n\nTo be honest, I’m not fond of villains. As for villains I thought worked great, Eddorians would top the list. Maybe Cthulhu.\n\nWho are your favorite hero duos from the pages?\n\nKip and Peewee from Have Space Suit — Will Travel, by Robert Heinlein.\n\nWhat reboots (or retellings) of classics have you enjoyed?\n\nThe one that comes to mind is the movie Forbidden Planet, by William Shakespeare — er, The Tempest, yeah.\n\nIs there a book to movie/TV adaptation that you found excellent? Is there a PC game to book adaptation that worked for you?\n\nI thought the later Hunger Games movies were good. I usually don’t watch adaptations too often. Don’t even ask my opinion on The Hobbit movies. I don’t read books derived from games.\n\nIf you could sit down and have dinner with 5 dead authors, who would you invite to the table? What would they order?\n\nOff the top of my head: Roger Zelazny, Robert Heinlein, Andre Norton, Anne McCaffrey, and E.E. “Doc” Smith. I haven’t got a clue what they’d order, but I imagine alcohol would be involved.\n\nCare to share an awkward fangirl/fanboy moment, either one where someone was gushing over your work…..or one where you were gushing over another author’s work?\n\nCan’t think of any offhand. I’m pretty comfortable in my skin. Maybe when I shook hands with Neil Armstrong as a kid and realized I was already too tall to be an astronaut.\n\nCover art can be so important for a book, making or breaking sales. What cover art has caught your eye, that you found stood above other books?\n\nI like cover art that conveys something from the book. The original cover for John Steakley’s novel Armor really nailed it.\n\nWhat is a recurring or the most memorable geeky argument or debate you have taken part in?\n\nToo many to count. I’m a scientist, dammit! We geek out all the time! That said, I do have recurring arguments about Classic Star Trek vs Next Gen. Next Gen sucked and has no rewatch benefits. Classic Trek was real science fiction and still relevant. Anyone who thinks differently can feel free to try and debate me.\n\nWhat is the first book you remember reading on your own?\n\nThe Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCaffrey. I have dyslexia, so I started reading later than most. I’ve made it since then.\n\nYou have to run an obstacle course. Who do you invite along? Will there be a tasty libation involved?\n\nInvite someone to go through an obstacle course? How bizarre. I’d challenge anyone who thought Next Gen was better than Classic Trek. How about that? Libations? No. Not till after I kick their asses. Then they can buy me Guinness.\n\nFinally, what upcoming events would you like to share with the readers?\n\nMy third novel, The Madness Engine (#3 The Awakening series), is scheduled for release on the 22nd of May. I will also most likely be at Bubonicon in Albuquerque again this year.\n\nThe Remnant (#1 The Awakening series)\n\nLt. Commander Hrothgar Tebrey is assigned as a military attaché to an archaeological expedition as light duty to recover from the disaster of his previous mission. But things quickly begin to go wrong on Cedeforthy. Someone, or something, is manipulating events to sabotage the expedition.\n\nWhen the science team becomes marooned on the planet by the tides of war, the sinister force reveals itself, and Tebrey must fight against a seemingly unstoppable enemy to save not just himself, the expedition, and the woman he loves, but his very soul.\n\nSome things are worth dying for; it is the things worth living for that matter.\n\nThe Fallen (#2 The Awakening series)\n\nLt. Commander Hrothgar Tebrey has returned to duty in Special Operations, but it is becoming harder for him to fight in the name of a government he no longer feels is just – one that orders purges against its own citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, dissention is growing within the ranks of the Earth Federation Fleet. Ships continue to go missing, and the military needs someone to blame. A war with the Sentient Concord seems inevitable.\n\nBut if the Earth Federation destroys the Sentient Concord, who will fight the true enemy? For the Sentient Concord is the only government that knows the truth about the hellish Theta entities…\n\n…Entities that want Tebrey dead, and are willing murder entire worlds to make it happen.\n\nThe Madness Engine (#3 The Awakening series)\n\nThe war between the Sentient Concord and the Earth Federation grinds on, but dark forces are moving behind the scenes, forces intent on unleashing terror on a scale never seen before, a terror that has already spread beyond Commander Hrothgar Tebrey’s universe.\n\nOn an alternate Earth, acid rains fall smoking from the steely skies, and feral things that were once human skitter through the ruins. Tebrey’s father Daeren Drake searches for clues about the enemy and finds more than he bargained for.\n\nMeanwhile, Lt. Commander Tonya Harris and Ghost stumble upon an engine, a weapon that must never be used, but already has been… by the enemy.\n\nLoyalties will be tested, dark pasts revealed, and the enemy will strike a blow at the heart of the Concord from which it may never recover.\n\nPlaces to Stalk Paul B.
