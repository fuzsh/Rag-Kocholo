        "text": "Carrie-Anne Moss is joining Arnold Schwarzenegger in action comedy series “Fubar” Season 2 as a former East German spy — who has a passionate history with Schwarzenegger’s CIA operative.\n\nMoss (“The Matrix” movies, Disney+’s “The Acolyte”) joins the returning cast of “Fubar,” which includes Schwarzenegger, Monica Barbaro, Fortune Feimster, Travis Van Winkle, Jay Baruchel, Aparna Brielle, Andy Buckley, Milan Carter, Fabiana Udenio and Barbara Eve Harris.\n\nIn Season 2 of “Fubar,” Schwarzenegger reprises his role as Luke Brunner, a veteran CIA operative who, until recently, was on the verge of retirement. After his last mission in saving another operative — who just so happened to be his daughter — he’s back and face-to-face with new villains. This one is an old flame from Luke’s past who threatens to destroy the world… if she doesn’t destroy his life first.\n\nSchwarzenegger, 76, after undergoing open-heart surgery said on social media in March that he was ready to start shooting Season 2 of “Fubar” on schedule. “I’ve gotten so many kind messages from all over the world, but a lot of people have asked if my pacemaker will cause any problems with ‘Fubar‘ Season 2. Absolutely not,” Schwarzenegger wrote in a post. “I will be ready to film in April and you can only see it if you’re really looking for it.”\n\nNick Santora (“Reacher,” “Prison Break”) is creator, showrunner and executive producer of “Fubar.” Schwarzenegger serves as executive producer alongside Adam Higgs, Scott Sullivan, Phil Abraham, Amy Pocha, Seth Cohen with Skydance’s David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Matt Thunell. Season 2 of “Fubar,” slated for eight one-hour episodes, is from Skydance Television."
