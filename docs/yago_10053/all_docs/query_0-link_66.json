        "text": "Two Thieves FALL IN LOVE During HEIST\n\nwhat it looks like but not for the reason that you're thinking I swear there is a very good reason for all this Cloak and Dagger stuff come on lady it's not a bomb pick it up already I can't wait here forever finally I thought she might never take it I always felt really great when I saw someone's day turn around just like my dad said Dad hey oh how was your day pumpkin good yeah did you make anybody smile today I tried okay you're so weird she's so clumsy who is that she's the most clumsiest girl in the school oh falling dropping or tripping on something she's such a loser she's so weird come on you promised ice cream PNY wait did you see what they did to her haven't you ever felt like that don't you wish someone had been there to help you get up and clean up but everyone makes fun of her I never do I swear I'm glad you don't I think she needs a little more than don't you remember kindness is a choice every time you choose to help someone you make the world just a little bit better for everyone right what do you say okay hey oh oh thank you sorry she smart thank you so much do you want to hang out our recess tomorrow that would be awesome so my dad used to always say an act of kindness can change someone's life and come back to you in unexpected ways he worked for search and rescue and died trying to save someone when I was still little so I'm still not so sure about the second part but in honor of him I'm now what the police and school teachers all call a kindness vigilante that was close thanks hey you know that lady whose family necklace was kept by the museum and they wouldn't give it to her you know the one you were all sad about apparently was stolen last night know anything about it no not a thing actually Henny you can't keep doing that stuff you're going to get caught one of these days caught for what I did not do anything wrong except for maybe eating this m meatloaf which is Meatloaf right impossible I didn't want to lie to Ella she was my best friend in the world but this way she wouldn't have to lie to the police if they ever questioned her even though she obviously knew it was me and she knew why after I lost my dad things got really hard for us and one day there was an electrical house fire in my childhood home and my family lost everything but what my mom missed the most were the things she could never get back like old pictures of her parents and my dad's old love letters to her from when they were young until one day someone returned the pictures and letters in the tin which the firefighter said they couldn't find in the rubble and they assumed it had been thrown away or melted I can't thank the person who returned our photos and letters because I have no no idea who it is but what I can do is help others like they helped us like my dad would want me to so my teacher took my diary cuz I was Runing on it in class and he won't return it yeah it's been days it is something that is so personal to me and there's so many memories in there it was even my grandpa can please just get it back for me read in my diary is the only thing that helps my anxiety who are you no one but I know who you are penny please know you're in one of these rooms out after my little Museum Heist the police were on high alert which meant the cops were everywhere why do you always have to bring the police wherever you go okay spill it how do you know who I am and why are you stealing that diary what do you want money I don't want money and I've been doing this far longer than you have you should know you in my first case me wait you were the one that returned my family's photos back to us but why because I've been in love with you since the seventh grade who it's just like the movies now that things had changed I needed Ella so she was officially in on the secret for better or worse so he's loved you since he was in the seventh grade or since you were both I assumed I don't really know for sure does it even really matter who he is well it wouldn't except he knows who I am dude now how do you find out about the diary it was only on my website which is password protected people can like send me videos but only I can see them they must packed it there she is call me if you need back up this is fun I needed to know what he wanted why was he going to my cases but most of all I needed to thank him for what he did for me and my family and Sandy was my only lead gotcha [Music] why' you hack my site and try to take my case huh because you almost got caught the last time according to the news thought you might stop after that and why does it matter to you if I quit or not you're the reason I what we do is important okay so maybe we should team up I can't why I told you I'm in love with you you get messy besides you don't even know who I am so tell me I mean at least show me your face no oh no what are you doing Penny I need to know be patient the time will come but for now just know that everything I do is for you I don't understand you don't need to why not you know I already love what you did for my mom and I so I mean I'd say you're doing way better than you think here Mister trust me I know but if I want you to be with me can't be for something I did years ago it's got to be for who I am now and for that to happen we'd have to meet naturally okay but then how does that happen there was no way I was letting him go that easy maybe if I annoyed him something would slip mom always said I was good at that you know it's funny you think that you were like so mysterious but I bet you your real name is something super dorky like archal or Steve I mean do you even have a real name or sorry should I keep calling you The Masked boy or or maybe the Shadow or or the Phantom or how about Captain no name you can call me whatever you like okay fine you were right it's um it's getting too dangerous for me so you can keep the website hacker cuz I'm resigning of course I wasn't actually quitting it was just another plot to find out who he was if you're thinking that I don't actually need to know who he is is and that I'm just being selfish and I should respect his wishes you're right what happened next was a terrible idea okay so here's what we can do we set up a trap that's exactly what I was thinking I I I was just going to say you asked someone El see who gets jealous butan your idea is cool too yeah the question is how do we do it see that's where you come in I need your ring but I I swear I will get it back to you my ring this ring is like my life you know how important it is to me I know that that's why I would never lose it well you always say that true kindness means sometimes doing stuff that you don't want to do so I'm trusting you just don't lose it okay okay you're so clumsy as ever you know that and thank you seriously you are the best and I am going to take great care of this now let's set up a trap Ella acted as an anonymous victim whose ring was stolen she said her face couldn't be shown or her family could find out the local pawn shop always posted their new items it would be the first place he'd check and when he saw it there he'd come to get it for sure in Ella's post she said the ring was in heirloom her grandma gave her before she died which was actually true and I promised her that if our masked friend couldn't get it back I would what could possibly go wrong all I had to do was follow him home after he got the ring back and I'd finally know who he was oh no if he sees the boy come out he'll be arrested and the ring will be gone I got to think of something officer help please there's a cat in a tree it's a really angry cat angry cat okay I got it penny a cat really hey hold it right there what did I just do see a face those eyes doing in there don't you know this place is closed I know those eyes wait he's that kid who used to live next door I remember that night I went over to invite them to our Halloween party when I heard arguing inside I peaked in and I saw those same worried scared eyes we can't afford that how am I supposed to pay for the hospital bills his mom was sick and they didn't have enough money for her treatment and he was too young to deal with it and it really messed him up then later he had to live with foster parents and was picked on at school because of it I felt terrible not only did I lose Ella's ring but I was also the reason he was here in the first place hey I do know who you are Adam right how'd you know I was here I set a trap for you not not to get you arrested it was it's purely about the ring which I have no idea how I'm going to get back now a trap why I needed to know who you were and I wasn't sure about it until now but I just I felt like I was falling for you without even knowing you and trust me I tried to tell the cop CS here that you were only trying to help and I mean I even showed them Ella's video but they said that there was nothing they could do about it what you did was a crime so if I had any money I would be bailing you out right now it was always going to end up like this you should probably go before they start asking questions right now they think I'm the only vigilante you're not like any one else and I just I just want to know you it's all I ever wanted to please go I had to find a way to get him out I had to think of something please proceed with your closing statement hold on what's going on here quiet please your honor these are all of the people that Adam has helped during his years of vigilantism is that true this young man helped all of you yes look I don't want to punish someone who's helping his community but this young man's crimes are too many well actually um some of the crimes that he's being charged for were mine great to vigiles didn't see that coming okay since you both enjoy serving others you get two years of community service split between you not that you're already not serving your community I think we can live with that me too your honor thank you but no more vigilantism from either of you do you understand now look I realize it's important to you to do kind things but there's a right way and a wrong way wait im sorry excuse me your honor can I please get my ring back you may but you'll have to go to the pawn shop and return the money they gave you for it court is adjourned I'm really sorry for everything for setting up the Trap I just I was being selfish and you were just being selfless Penny the reason I started all of this went digging through the Ashes to find your family's photos wasn't because I was kind it's because you were so you see the acts of kindness didn't start with me they started with you all those people were helped because of you including your family so what did two vigilantes do when they can't Vigilant anymore well I was thinking of starting a kindness Club at school you know it's a it's a way to keep doing what we do but legally and I don't know with more hands- on Deck I'm in me too"
