        "text": "Vice Media in Canada has handed out an eight-episode order for a Viceland TV series based on Michael Dowse’s 2002 headbanger movie Fubar.\n\nThe half-hour show, unveiled on Friday, reteams Dowse and stars David Lawrence and Paul Spence in their original roles as Terry and Dean. Vice Studio Canada and Canadian broadcaster Rogers Media are co-producing the series, set to debut later this year.\n\nThe Viceland adaptation sees the clueless Terry and Dean characters fleeing the wildfires of Fort McMurray, Alberta, for Calgary with nothing but emergency government debit cards to their names. Discovering high-speed internet for the first time, Terry attempts to harness the web for profit, while Dean sets out to record a triple-concept album using his burnt bass guitar and falsetto voice.\n\nThe Fubar TV series follows a 2010 movie sequel, Fubar 2, also set in Fort McMurray. Vice Media in 2014 unveiled a $100 million partnership with Canadian phone giant Rogers Communications to operate a production studio in Toronto and to launch Viceland as a 24-hour cable channel in Canada."
