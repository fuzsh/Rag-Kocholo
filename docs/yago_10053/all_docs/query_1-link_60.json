        "text": "\"He's ready to risk it all to protect his family... and save the world!\" Ha! Dang this is pretty funny. Netflix has posted an amusing throwback action figure commercial promo video for the FUBAR spy comedy action series. It just started streaming this past weekend (view here), and they're trying to build the buzz with some clever viral marketing stunts. Arnold Schwarzenegger's FUBAR is a global spy adventure - when a father & daughter learn that they’ve each secretly been working as CIA Operatives for years, they realize their entire relationship has been a lie and they truly don’t know one another at all. It's pretty much a True Lies sequel. FUBAR stars Arnold, along with Monica Barbaro, Milan Carter, Gabriel Luna, Fortune Feimster, Travis Van Winkle, Fabiana Udenio, Barbara Eve Harris, Aparna Brielle, Andy Buckley, and Jay Baruchel. I'm smiling at how much they pack into this 90 second video, with good jokes about Arnold being the Terminator, his old age, the title \"FUBAR\", and more. This actually does make me want to tune in.\n\nHere's the funny \"action figure commercial\" for Netflix's series FUBAR, direct from Netflix's YouTube:\n\nYou can rewatch the first teaser for Schwarzenegger's FUBAR right here, or the main official trailer here."
