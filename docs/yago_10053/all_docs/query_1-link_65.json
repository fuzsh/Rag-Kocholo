        "text": "FUBAR spoilers follow.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger's CIA agent Luke Brunner may have finally found common ground with his fellow operative and daughter Emma (Top Gun: Maverick's Monica Barbaro), but the end of the first season of FUBAR certainly didn't leave the pair on safe ground.\n\nWhile Boro (Gabriel Luna) is now well and truly despatched, their covers have been blown, putting them at risk of all kinds of retribution in a cliffhanger ending that makes us thankful Netflix has now renewed the show for a second season.\n\nThanking fans for their \"great response\" to FUBAR on social media, Schwarzenegger said: \"It was really interesting how many of the fans loved the last episode. Because the interesting thing is, it is also my favourite episode. I don’t want to give it away, but there is some really wild stuff and it really sets it up for the next season.\"\n\nSo, now we know the spy comedy is officially returning for a second season, here's everything another season of Schwarzenegger and his crack CIA team could hold.\n\nFUBAR season 2 potential release date: When will it air on Netflix?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has confirmed that FUBAR is back in business, with production on season two now under way.\n\nNot only that, but the show has broken a Guinness World Record. In a video shared to Schwarzenegger's Instagram, he confirmed the good news, writing: \"Get to the choppa! FUBAR S2 is in production. It’s gonna be big, like Guinness World Record big.\"\n\nThe time-lapse video then showed the construction of a ginormous Luke Brunner figure. Standing at 22.14 feet, or 265.7 inches tall, it is officially the biggest action figure ever – much like the second season promises to be.\n\nTaking into account the time needed for filming and post-production (all of which took around a year to complete for season one), new episodes of FUBAR could debut in summer 2025 at the earliest.\n\nFUBAR marked Schwarzenegger's TV debut in a show which was modelled on his film True Lies. Prior to the show's release, the Terminator star said: \"Everywhere I go, people ask me when I'm going to do another big action comedy like True Lies. Well, here it is.\n\n\"FUBAR will kick your ass and make you laugh – and not just for two hours. You get a whole season. It's been a joy to work with [executive producer] Nick [Santora], Skydance, and Netflix to give my fans exactly what they've been waiting for.\"\n\nFUBAR season 2 cast: Who's in it?\n\nThe T-800 Terminator himself Arnold Schwarzenegger will of course \"be back\" as star Luke Brunner.\n\nWith production on season two now officially underway, we've had news of a new cast member. None other than The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss will be joining as a former East German spy who has a \"passionate\" history with Arnie's Luke, Variety reported.\n\nWe can also expect to see much of the supporting cast joining him after they all made it out of the eight-episode caper alive. So that would include Monica Barbaro as Luke's daughter Emma, as well as Milan Carter as Luke's best friend and agent-down-an-earpiece Barry.\n\nTheir fellow CIA chums Roo (Fortune Feimster) and Aldon (You season two star Travis Van Winkle) would likely be back, as they made it out of the Boro church showdown alive. Meanwhile, a big question mark hangs over Tina (Aparna Brielle) after that ambiguous ending suggested she could be up to no good, so we will have to wait and see.\n\nOne star of the show who would definitely not be returning is Boro, played by Gabriel Luna, after his very definitive death scene. So a second season of FUBAR would have to dig up another villain for Schwarzenegger's Luke to fight off.\n\nFUBAR season 2 plot: What will happen?\n\nAt the end of the first season of FUBAR, we left Luke on the lam with his family and the CIA team – with the exception of Tina, who was still back in the office, taking ominous phone calls.\n\nFather and daughter duo Luke and Emma had finally found a way to work together as partner CIA operatives, after plenty of bickering, back and forth, and time in joint therapy sessions. This armistice even bled into their private family drama, when Emma told Luke to go after her mum Tally, just as she was set to remarry.\n\nThe outcome of Luke's big romantic gamble was one of the threads left dangling when the season ended on its getaway car cliffhanger, so that would be something a second series would inevitably solve.\n\nAlongside the comedic high jinks, a second season would likely answer that tantalising question of who Tina really is, after Barry's new girlfriend was seen taking a hush-hush phone call in Russian.\n\nAparna Brielle, who plays Tina, has spoken of her hopes for the future of the show, given that her character was hinted to be a mole in the agency.\n\nAparna said she's particularly looking forward to the opportunity to do more stunts outside of the office, like she saw her cast members doing in the first season.\n\n\"I loved all the things I got to do and play with,\" she told ScreenRant. \"Knowing that I will get to do those things makes it that much sweeter, because I feel like I got to spend so much time watching everyone.\n\n\"I'm already thinking about the future, and it gives me more time to develop things like the fact that maybe she fights a little differently than everyone. Maybe she moves a little differently than everyone when you see the real her, whoever that is. So, I had FOMO, but it also bought me time to play a little bit.\"\n\nSeries creator Nick Santora described making the show as \"by far the most surreal\" project of his career. He said: \"I grew up watching Arnold Schwarzenegger films – I'd hit my dad up for a few bucks so I could race to the movies and see the biggest star in the world on the big screen, so creating the first scripted television project for Arnold is unbelievably exciting for me.\n\n\"The thing I always marvelled at was how Schwarzenegger could be funny while still kicking ass. That's why I wanted FUBAR to be a hysterical, CIA-spy comedy mixed with heart-stopping action! And it is all that – and more.\"\n\nSo, now we know we're getting a second season of FUBAR, we're sure fans of the show will be able to expect more of the same.\n\nFUBAR season 2 trailer: When can I watch it?\n\nSadly, we'll have to wait until closer to an official release date before we get ahead of ourselves with a trailer.\n\nFor now, we have the trailer for the first season to watch, as well as all of season one's eight episodes on Netflix to stream again.\n\nFUBAR is available to stream on Netflix.\n\n.."
