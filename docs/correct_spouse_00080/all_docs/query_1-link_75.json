An ordained United Methodist elder, she continues to serve as a member of the South Carolina Annual Conference of the church.\n\nIn February, Henry-Crowe will leave the University to serve as general secretary of the General Board of Church and Society, the denomination's main arm for social justice and advocacy, education and international outreach."
