Moviegoers remember him as the German commander, who almost hanged Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn at the end of “The African Queen”; as the dogged sheriff, who pursued convicts Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis in “The Defiant Ones”; as the treacherous Hungarian linguist, who tried to expose Audrey Hepburn as a fraud in the film version of “My Fair Lady.”\n\nBikel also was one of the founders of the Newport Folk Festival and, at age 76, continues to perform 50 to 60 concerts each year as a folk singer and guitarist. He’ll be bringing his act to this area Sunday night at Temple Beth Hillel-Beth El in Wynnewood. “I usually do a broad spectrum of things from quite a lot of source material,” he says. “I can sing in 21 languages, so I do folk songs in various languages, some Jacques Brel, some Weill, and songs from shows I’ve done like `My Fair Lady,’ `The Sound of Music,’ `Zorba,’ `Fiddler’ ~ quite an eclectic mix.”\n\n“Fiddler” has practically become Bikel’s personal vehicle. Although he wasn’t the original Tevye ~ that was Zero Mostel ~ he has played the role more often than any other actor over the past 33 years. He’ll be returning to it again in the fall for a 35-week tour that will culminate in Broadway revival. “Doing Tevye has been a marathon,” he admits, “except that I do many other things and find my way back to it. Over 33 years, I’ve strived to keep it fresh.” Such professional discipline came early to Bikel. Born in Vienna, he grew up in Palestine, and at age 20, was one of the founders of the Israeli Chamber Theatre, the “Cameri.” After graduating from London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, he attracted the attention of Laurence Olivier in some small London theater productions. He understudied the roles of Stanley and Mitch in Olivier’s production of “A Streetcar Named Desire,” later taking over the part of Mitch. ____________\n\n“Without the arts we are a barren\n\nnation. Respect for the arts is not\n\nsomething we get with mother’s\n\nmilk in this country. It’s regarded\n\nas a frill instead of an integral part\n\nof civilization.”\n\nTheodore Bikel\n\n“Olivier was the premier actor in world at the time, and here he was directing this play,” Bikel says. “Unlike other directors, he could actually show you exactly the way he wanted you to play a scene, but you knew you couldn’t do it as well as he did. It was a little disconcerting.”\n\nBlanche in that production was Vivien Leigh, Mrs. Olivier at the time. “She was strange,” Bikel recalls, “frail, though it seemed there was something very solid underneath.”\n\nFrom there, it was on to brilliant careers in several fields, working with the greats and near-greats. Mention a name, and Bikel will dip into his treasure trove of memories:\n\nOn John Huston, his director on “The African Queen” and “Moulin Rouge”: “Great fun, a practical joker ~ he would go to any lengths to amuse himself.” On Rodgers and Hammerstein, with whom he worked on “The Sound of Music”: “That show was their swan song. Oscar Hammerstein was very ill, and he and Richard Rodgers wrote `Edelweiss’ for me 11 days before we opened on Broadway. It was the last song Hammerstein ever wrote. I often think it’s appropriate that the last word in that song, the last word the dying man wrote, was `forever.’ ” On Audrey Hepburn, the star of the movie “My Fair Lady”: “I was terrified to do the ballroom scene with her ~ I was worried about stepping on her toes. So I took dancing lessons for two weeks before we started shooting.”\n\nIn addition to performing, Bikel has been politically active since he became a U.S. citizen in 1961. He was a delegate to the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago and a board member of Amnesty International, and is senior vice president of the American Jewish Congress. He has been a passionate arts advocate, having served as president of Actors Equity, as a member of the National Council on the Arts and other posts. “I wanted to make sure the arts, and especially practitioners, are respected in this country,” he says. “There’s an extraordinary and baffling gulf between superstars and others. … We pay homage (to stars) possibly because we don’t have royalty here. But the arts deserve more than adulation of superstars. Without the arts, we are a barren nation. Respect for the arts is not something we get with mother’s milk in this country. It’s regarded as a frill instead of an integral part of civilization,” he says.\n\nBoth of his sons have inherited his passion for the arts. Robert is a budding film producer; the younger son, Daniel, is pursuing a Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, but he’s also a musician. “His apartment looks like a recording studio,” Bikel says. When Bikel isn’t touring, he and his wife, Rita, divide their time between homes in Connecticut and California. But the upcoming revival of `Fiddler’ will keep him on the road for some time. “Beyond that, who knows?” he says. “I take it one thing at a time.” Theodore Bikel will perform Sunday night at 7:30 at the 10th annual Ruth N. Maltzman Memorial Event at Temple Beth Hillel-Beth El, 1001 Remington Road, Wynnewood. Tickets cost $50. Call 610649-5300\n\nOriginally Published: April 27, 2000 at 10:00 p.m."
