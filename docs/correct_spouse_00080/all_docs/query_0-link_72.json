        "text": "This year Theatre Ariel, Pennsylvania’s oldest professional Jewish theater (founded in 1990) has chosen legendary internationally acclaimed Theodore Bikel to headline its annual fund-raiser. Founder and Artistic Director Deborah Baer Mozes says, “Theo is a gifted performer. He very much embodies the mission of Theatre Ariel and sings works that span both the Jewish world and the secular world.”\n\nAccording to Mozes, “Theater Ariel’s mission is dedicated to illuminating the rich social, cultural and spiritual heritage of the Jewish people. We produce and commission new works that serve as a prism through which one can view the varied colors of the American Jewish experience, the contemporary Jewish American life as well as works that celebrate the rich Jewish history.” Mozes adds, “We use classic [Jewish] texts and ancient stories to reflect on the past, examine our present and in some cases envision the future.”\n\nThe concert is a perfect partnership as no one understands theater or preserving Jewish culture more intensely than Theodore Bikel. “I am passionate about preserving culture, about certainly [preserving] my own background, my own roots, [and] about the Yiddish language.”\n\nBorn in Austria, Bikel and his family relocated to Israel during World War II. He says, “My father was an amateur actor. He was very good actually. So he used to do plays but not in a professional sense. Very often after dinner, we would sit down and he would read a short story.” When asked about his family’s folk songs, Bikel says, “I learned a lot of what I sing from my father and mother.”\n\nIn addition to folk singing, Bikel has a long list of television, film, stage and Broadway credits, including Baron von Trapp in “The Sound of Music” and Tevye in “Fiddler on the Roof.” He has also received numerous awards, among which are an Academy Award nomination (1959), an Emmy (1988) and the 1997 “Lifetime Achievement Award,” which are merely a glimpse of this visionary’s passion and endless energy.\n\nEven though he was nominated for the Laurel Award for his performance in “The Defiant,” he is not resting on it. “I don’t lie back and bathe in the glory. My life just keeps going on. In some sense it is more active now.” As he continues to follow his heart, he is a champion for peace and has written an autobiography, just completed a new film, released a new CD and has a speaking and concert schedule that resembles an international travel log.\n\nThis multitalented Renaissance man says, “I refuse to be defined as one thing.” Indeed, thinking of Bikel in just one category would be like listening to one instrument in an orchestra which is able to stand alone as a beautiful entity. But put Bikel’s attributes together like all the instruments in an orchestra, blending with melodies and harmonies and you marvel at the breathtaking masterpiece. Certainly he is the conductor of his own destiny, stretching and re-creating himself, speaking out for that which he believes, and keeping his concerts fresh.\n\nBikel is touring with accomplished pianist Tamara Brooks. This Julliard graduate, who has earned degrees in piano and conducting, has extensive ties to the Philadelphia area as a former professor and conductor at Haverford and Bryn Mawr colleges, as well as her 11-year stint as music director of the Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia. Bikel and Brooks’ multicultural “Bridge to Peace” international tour has resulted in an upcoming film.\n\nBikel’s friendship with Adena Potok, the concert’s honoree and Theatre Ariel’s vice president, makes the evening even more personal. Bikel knew Adena’s husband, author Chaim Potok. In 2004 Bikel played the part of Reb Saunders in a stage production of Chaim Potok’s “The Chosen.”\n\nFollowing the play, Bikel and Adena Potok, to whom “The Chosen” was dedicated and who had been the first reader and editor for her husband’s books, participated in a symposium about the “The Chosen” (now required reading for many schools), both the book and the play.\n\nMozes felt that Potok was the right person to honor at this year’s fund-raiser. “Adena knows Theo. Her life and her life’s work are similar to Theatre Ariel’s mission and Theo’s mission. She is a visionary and an incredible board member. When she gets involved in a project, she gives her heart and soul to it. Adena has given to this community so much of her talents and her skill and her vision.”\n\nIn looking at the evening’s purpose, Bikel says, “There are three elements here [Bikel, Potok and Theatre Ariel] that are kind of fortuitous that come together and it can be in a festive occasion like this. Also it indicates that there is and should be support for theater, live theater, in general and Jewish theater in particular.”\n\nOrganizations such as Theatre Ariel depend on community support. Mozes’ ultimate goal for the evening is this: “We can continue to lend our Jewish voice to the artistic, cultural and ethnic mosaic of our community.”\n\nMozes is understandably excited about the evening and says, “When you go to a concert with Theo, it is an evening with him. It is fresh and electric. Because he is both a singer and an actor, he has a way of relating to the audience. He is an incredible person and that just radiates across the footlights.” Mozes concludes, “Give yourself the opportunity to spend an evening with Theodore Bikel.” In doing so. you will see a rare performance, support an innovative theater and honor a remarkable woman.\n\nIf YOU GO\n\nTheatre Ariel presents:\n\nTheodore Bikel\n\nwill perform in a\n\nfund-raising concert\n\nfor Theatre Ariel\n\nhonoring Adena Potok\n\nat Haverford School’s\n\nCentennial Hall,\n\n450 Lancaster Ave.,\n\nHaverford, PA 19041,\n\nMonday, Dec. 3, 7:30 p.m.\n\nGeneral Admission, $60;\n\nPatron tickets (including\n\npost-performance dessert\n\nreception with Bikel & Brooks)\n\nstars at $125.\n\nInfo: 610-667-9230."
