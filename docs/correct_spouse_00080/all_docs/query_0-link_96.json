        "text": "Jon Hammond with the great Theodore Bikel –\n\nsome lady was trying to crowd in to my photo, anyway it was\n\nnice of Mr. Bikel to pose for the photo with me after a long show – JH\n\nTheodore’s Wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Bikel\n\nTheodore Bikel\n\nBorn Theodore Meir Bikel\n\nMay 2, 1924 (age 88)\n\nVienna, Austria\n\nOccupation Film, television actor\n\nYears active 1946-present\n\nSpouse(s) Ofra Ichilov (1942-43; divorced)\n\nRita Weinberg Call (1967-2008; divorced; 2 children)\n\nTamara Brooks (2008-2012; her death)\n\nTheodore Meir Bikel (born May 2, 1924) is a character actor, folk singer and musician. He made his film debut in The African Queen (1951) and was nominated for an Academy award for his supporting role as Sheriff Max Muller in The Defiant Ones (1958).\n\nBikel is President of the Associated Actors and Artistes of America and was president of Actors’ Equity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He serves as the Chair of the Board of Directors of Meretz USA,[2] where he also lectures. His autobiography, Theo, was published in 1995.\n\nBikel was born in Vienna, Austria, the son of Miriam (née Riegler) and Josef Bikel from Bukovina.[3] Being active in Zionism, his father named him after Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. Following the Nazi occupation of Austria, Bikel’s family fled to Palestine, where his father’s contacts helped the family obtain British passports.[4]\n\nBikel started acting while in his teens. He co-founded the Cameri Theatre there—which has gone on to become one of Israel’s biggest theaters—before he moved to London to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1945.[5] In 1948, Michael Redgrave recommended Bikel to his friend Laurence Olivier as understudy for the parts of both Stanley Kowalski and Mitch in the West End premiere of Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire.[6] Bikel graduated from understudy to star opposite the director’s wife, Vivien Leigh, who would go on to recreate her role as Blanche DuBois in the film version opposite Marlon Brando.\n\nBikel was the President of the Actors’ Equity Association, in which office he supported human rights. At the 1977 AFL–CIO Convention, Bikel (right) welcomed the Russian dissident Vladimir Bukovsky (center) upon his release from the Soviet Union. Tom Kahn (left) was an assistant to AFL–CIO President George Meany\n\nAfter several plays and films in Europe, Bikel moved to the United States in 1954, and became a naturalized citizen in 1961. He was the U-boat first officer to Curt Jürgens in The Enemy Below (1957) and played the captain of the Russian submarine in The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming (1966). He also portrayed the sadistic General Jouvet in The Pride and the Passion (1957) Bikel was screentested for the role of Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film Goldfinger (1964). The screentest can be seen on the “Ultimate Edition” DVD released in 2006. Bikel also appeared in Frank Zappa’s 1971 film 200 Motels.\n\nOn Broadway he originated the role of Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music in 1959, for which he received his second Tony nomination. Bikel did not like his role in “Sound of Music” because his ability to sing was limited in the play, and he did not like to perform repeatedly the same role of the Captain. In 1964, he played Zoltan Karpathy, the dialect expert, in the film version of My Fair Lady. Since his first appearance as Tevye in the musical Fiddler on the Roof in 1967, Bikel has performed the role more often than any other actor (more than 2,000 times to date). When an injury required 74-year-old fellow Israeli performer Chaim Topol (veteran of many productions of the stage show and star of the motion picture of Fiddler on the Roof) to withdraw from a high-budget, much-promoted 2009 North American tour of the musical, Bikel substituted for him in several Canadian appearances, including Calgary in January 2010, and had scheduled appearances in the musical beyond his 86th birthday in May of that year.[7]\n\nIn the 1950s, Bikel produced and sang in several albums of Jewish folk songs, as well as Songs of a Russian Gypsy, in 1958. He was a co-founder of the Newport Folk Festival (together with Pete Seeger and George Wein) in 1959. In 1962, he heard Bob Dylan give his premiere performance of “Blowin’ in the Wind”. Bikel then went to his scheduled performance and became the first singer besides Dylan to perform the song in public. Bikel (with business partner Herb Cohen) opened the first folk music coffeehouse in Los Angeles, The Unicorn. Its popularity led to the two opening a second club, Cosmo Alley, which in addition to folk music presented poets such as Maya Angelou and comics including Lenny Bruce. Bikel became increasingly involved with civil rights issues and progressive causes, and was a delegate to the 1968 Democratic Convention.[8]\n\nIn addition to scores of appearances on film and on the stage, Bikel was a guest star on many popular television shows. He appeared in an episode of the 1954 NBC legal drama Justice based on cases from the Legal Aid Society of New York.[9] He also appeared in the episode entitled “The Faithful Pilgrimage” of CBS’s Appointment with Adventure anthology series. The particular episode was written by Rod Serling. He also appeared in a second episode of Appointment with Adventure entitled “Return of the Stranger.”\n\nLater, Bikel guest starred on Rod Serling’s The Twilight Zone (episode “Four O’Clock” as Oliver Crangle). He appeared on episodes of Wagon Train, Hawaii Five-O, Columbo, Charlie’s Angels, Cannon, Little House on the Prairie, Mission: Impossible, Gunsmoke, Dynasty, All in the Family, Knight Rider, and Law & Order. He appeared on the game show Super Password as a celebrity guest in 1988.\n\nIn the early 1990s, he appeared on Star Trek: The Next Generation, in the episode “Family”, playing Sergey Rozhenko, the Russian-born adoptive father of Worf, who, as a petty officer on the Starfleet vessel Intrepid, had found Worf at the site of the Khitomer Massacre and taken him home to raise as his son. Bikel performed two roles in the Babylon 5 universe. In 1994, he portrayed Rabbi Koslov in the first season episode “TKO”. In 1998, he appeared in the TV movie Babylon 5: In the Beginning as Anla’Shok leader Lenonn.\n\nIn February of 2012, Bikel played the title role in Visiting Mr. Green with the Harold Green Jewish Theatre Company in Toronto, Ontario.\n\n[edit]Actors’ unions and charities: Leadership\n\nBikel is president of the Associated Actors and Artistes of America. He was president of Actors’ Equity in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in which office he supported human rights. At the 1977 AFL–CIO Convention, Bikel welcomed the Russian dissident Vladimir Bukovsky upon his release from the Soviet Union.[1] U.S. President Jimmy Carter appointed him to serve on the National Council for the Arts in 1977 for a six-year term.[citation needed] In 1962 he co-founded Actors Federal Credit Union.\n\nOn January 28, 2007, he agreed to serve as chair of the Board of Directors of Meretz USA, where he also lectures.\n\nHis autobiography, Theo, was published in 1995 by Harper Collins, and re-issued in an updated version by the University of Wisconsin Press in 2002. He is a member of the High IQ collective Mensa International.[10]\n\n[edit]Marriage\n\nBikel married his third wife, conductor Tamara Brooks (1941-2012), in 2008.\n\n[edit]Discography\n\nSongs of a Russian Gypsy (1958)\n\nBravo Bikel (1959)\n\nSongs of Russia Old & New (1960)\n\nA Folksinger’s Choice (1964)\n\nSongs of the Earth (1967)\n\nA New Day (1969)\n\nFolk Songs From Just About Everywhere (1958)\n\nTheodore Bikel Sings More Jewish Folk Songs (1959)\n\nTheodore Bikel Sings Song of Israel (1960)\n\n[edit]Filmography\n\nThe African Queen (1951)\n\nMoulin Rouge (1952)\n\nNever Let Me Go (1953)\n\nThe Little Kidnappers (1953)\n\nThe Love Lottery (1954)\n\nBetrayed (1954) (uncredited)\n\nThe Divided Heart (1954)\n\nThe Young Lovers (1954)\n\nThe Colditz Story (1955)\n\nAbove Us the Waves (1955)\n\nThe Vintage (1957)\n\nThe Pride and the Passion (1957)\n\nThe Enemy Below (1957)\n\nFräulein (1958)\n\nI Bury the Living (1958)\n\nThe Defiant Ones (1958)\n\nI Want to Live!

Joe became an icon in the music product’s industry through his long associations with manufacturers as an endorsee, music retailers as a clinician, and publishers as an author of successful method books. He gave advice and lessons to all who ask, and was often known to be the last to leave a clinic – ensuring all questions have been\n\nanswered.\n\nJoe Morello the legendary Jazz Drummer July 17, 1928 – March 12, 2011\n\nInstead of hearing aids, he had a lady who would repeat everything in to his ear – Jon Hammond\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Morello\n\nJoseph Albert Morello (July 17, 1928 – March 12, 2011) was a jazz drummer best known for his 12½-year stint with The Dave Brubeck Quartet. He was frequently noted for playing in the unusual time signatures employed by that group in such pieces as “Take Five” and “Blue Rondo à la Turk”. Popular for its work on college campuses during the 1950s, Brubeck’s group reached new heights with Morello. In June 1959, Morello participated in a recording session with the quartet — completed by the alto saxophonist Paul Desmond and the bassist Eugene Wright — that yielded “Kathy’s Waltz” and “Three to Get Ready,” both of which intermingled 3/4 and 4/4 time signatures\n\nMorello suffered from partial vision from birth,[3] and devoted himself to indoor activities. At six years old he began studying the violin, going on to feature three years later as soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, playing Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto, and again three years later.\n\nAt the age of 15 Morello met the violinist Jascha Heifetz and decided that he would never be able to equal Heifetz’s “sound”, so switched to drumming, first studying with a show drummer named Joe Sefcik and then George Lawrence Stone, author of the noted drum textbook Stick Control for the Snare Drummer. Stone was so impressed with Morello’s ideas that he incorporated them into his next book, Accents & Rebounds, which is dedicated to Morello. Later, Morello studied with Radio City Music Hall percussionist Billy Gladstone.\n\nAfter moving to New York City, Morello worked with numerous notable jazz musicians including Johnny Smith, Tal Farlow, Stan Kenton, Phil Woods, Sal Salvador, Marian McPartland, Jay McShann, Art Pepper, Howard McGhee, and others. After a period playing in McPartland’s trio, Morello declined invitations to join both Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey’s bands, favoring a temporary two-month tour with the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1955; Morello remained with Brubeck for well over a decade, only departing in 1968. Morello later became an in-demand clinician, teacher and bandleader whose former students include Danny Gottlieb, Max Weinberg, Rich Galichon, Phish drummer Jon Fishman, Gary Feldman, Patrick Wante, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons drummer Gerry Polci, Jerry Granelli, and Glenn Johnson.\n\nExternal videos\n\nOral History, Joe Morello explains how he became a member of The Dave Brubeck Quartet. interview date June 8, 2007, NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) Oral History Library\n\nMorello appeared in many Brubeck performances and contributed to over 60 albums with Brubeck. On “Take Five”, he plays an imaginative drum solo maintaining the 5/4 time signature throughout. Another example of soloing in odd time signatures can be heard on “Unsquare Dance”, in which he solos using only sticks without drums in 7/4 time. At the end of the track, he can be heard laughing about the “trick” ending. He also features on “Blue Rondo à la Turk”, “Strange Meadow Lark”, and “Pick-Up Sticks”.\n\nDuring his career, Morello appeared on over 120 albums, 60 of which were with the Dave Brubeck Quartet. He authored several drum books, including Master Studies, published by Modern Drummer Publications, and also made instructional videos. Morello was the recipient of many awards, including Playboy magazine’s best drummer award for seven years in a row, and Down Beat magazine’s best drummer award five years in a row. He was elected to the Modern Drummer magazine Hall of Fame in 1988, the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 1993, and was the recipient of Hudson Music’s first TIP (Teacher Integration Program) Lifetime Achievement award in June, 2010.[4]\n\nJoe Morello died on March 12, 2011, at his home in Irvington, New Jersey. He was 82 years old.
