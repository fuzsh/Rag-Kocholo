        "text": "1934 Â· Alcatraz Island Becomes Federal Penitentiary\n\nAlcatraz Island officially became Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary on August 11, 1934. The island is situated in the middle of frigid water and strong currents of the San Francisco Bay, which deemed it virtually inescapable. Alcatraz became known as the toughest prison in America and was seen as a âlast resort prison.â Therefore, Alcatraz housed some of Americaâs most notorious prisoners such as Al Capone and Robert Franklin Stroud. Due to the exorbitant cost of running the prison, and the deterioration of the buildings due to salt spray, Alcatraz Island closed as a penitentiary on March 21, 1963.Â\n\n1948 Â· The Beginning of the Cold War\n\nThe Berlin Blockade was the first major crises of the Cold War. The Soviet Union blocked all access to the sectors of Berlin under Western control and offered to drop the blockade if the newly introduced Deutsche Mark was removed from West Berlin. The Berlin Blockade showed the different ideological and economic visions for postwar Europe. Even though there wasn't any fire fight during the cold war, many of these skirmishes arose and almost caused nuclear war on multiple occasions."
