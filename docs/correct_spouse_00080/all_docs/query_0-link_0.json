She was 70.\n\nShe had a distinguished career as a conductor and educator who performed around the world.\n\nThe director of choral activities at the New England Conservatory from 1982 to 2000, she also had served as president and head of the orchestral program of Philadelphia’s New School of Music. Brooks founded and was music director of Sequenza, a professional instrumental ensemble devoted to contemporary music.\n\nBrooks and Bikel met when they worked on two shows about Jewish music for PBS in 1999 and 2000, according to the conservatory website. Brooks became Bikel’s professional as well as life partner, accompanying him on piano in frequent concert tours in the U.S. and overseas."
