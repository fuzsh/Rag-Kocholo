Each of the four works chosen deals explicitly with the relationship between history “writ large” and its more microcosmic, personal, and psychic reverberations.\n\nFabulation of the Re-education of Undine\n\nBy Lynn Nottage\n\nDirected by Isaiah Wooden\n\nPresented in Collaboration with Black Theatre Ensemble\n\nNovember 1-4, 2007\n\nDC Premiere\n\nA sharp and riotously comic satire, this urban parable is about the dangers of disingenuous self-creation. Undine Barnes Calles is living her version of the American Dream until her husband disappears with her fortune. Bankrupt and pregnant, she is forced to confront the past she tried desperately to kill. Fashioned with dynamic theatricality and surprising warmth, this contemporary tale of comeuppance promises to transport audiences with humor and humanity.\n\nTrees and Ghosts\n\nAdapted and Directed by Natsu Onoda\n\nFrom the Graphic Novels of Tezuka Osamu\n\nNovember 8-11, 2007\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nA new multimedia production adapted from three short graphic novels by a Japanese cartoonist Tezuka Osamu, who is considered the inventor of manga (contemporary Japanese comics).

Composed from local history and gossip, newspaper accounts and photographs, asylum records and contemporary fiction, Lesy’s hallucinogenic text chronicles the decline of a rural Wisconsin county during the Great Depression of the 1890s. Employing American roots music to shift back and forth in time between the 1890 and the 1980s, the piece tells the story of a trailer park denizen living in the margins of Reagan’s America, haunted by the nineteenth-century ghosts of Black River Falls.\n\nStuff Happens\n\nBy David Hare\n\nDirected by Derek Goldman\n\nApril 10-13 and 16-19, 2008\n\nDC Premiere\n\nA dynamic history play that takes as its subject the diplomatic and political build-up to the Iraqi War, with familiar characters such as Colin, Condi, Cheney, Rummy, and Dubya himself. Combining documentary-style transcripts with Hare’s imaginings of conversations that took place behind closed doors, Stuff Happens examines the dynamic between private, hidden histories and the grand and more visible currents of our own contemporary history.\n\nAnansi the Story King\n\nAdapted and directed by Nadine George-Graves\n\nJune 12-15, 2008\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nThis new production will be an indoor/outdoor spectacle that re-imagines the legend of Anansi the spider, the classical African Diaspora trickster, using puppetry, new media, music and dance. A mash-up of the traditional African legend with the Arabian classic, Shahrazad, it is a performance for the whole family, a magical tale recounting Anansi’s attempts to prove he is king of all stories, while Sheri the firefly tries to outspin Anansi’s yarns and escape his powerful web.\n\nThe Sounds of Desire\n\nFESTIVAL OF INTERFAITH ARTS\n\nOctober 1, 2007\n\nHeather Raffo, author and actress of the award-winning one-woman show Nine Parts of Desire, teams up with Amir Elsaffar, accomplished trumpeter and Iraqi santoor player, for a dramatic evening of spoken word and music as a part of Georgetown University’s Interfaith Arts Festival.
