        "text": "Theodore Bikel, the Tony-nominated actor, folk singer and original Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music on Broadway, has died in Los Angeles aged 91.\n\nBikel, for whom Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote the musical’s famous song Edelweiss, died at the UCLA medical centre on Tuesday, his publicist, B Harlan Böll, confirmed.\n\nThe actor famously played Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof more times on stage than even Chaim Topol, who starred in the film, and also appeared in dozens of TV shows including The Twilight Zone, Charlie’s Angels, and Star Trek: The Next Generation, as Worf’s father.\n\nBorn in Vienna in 1924 and named after the modern Zionist leader Theodor Herzl, Bikel moved with his parents after the Nazi occupation of Austria to British-occupied Palestine, where he began acting in Hebrew theatre in his teens.\n\nHe later studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London where Michael Redgrave spotted his talent and recommended him for the West End premiere of A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Lawrence Olivier and starring Vivien Leigh. Bikel made his Broadway debut after moving to the US in 1954 and was Tony-nominated for The Rope Dancers in 1958 and The Sound of Music the following year.\n\nBikel’s multilingualism and talent for accents saw him cast variously on the big screen as a German officer, French commander, Russian submarine captain and US sheriff as well as, famously, the Hungarian voice coach in My Fair Lady.\n\nFrom the 1950s he began recording albums of folk songs, and in 1959 co-founded the Newport folk festival where he sang alongside a young Bob Dylan and Joan Baez.\n\nA lifelong unionist and activist, he was president of Actor’s Equity from 1977 and 1982, and later president of the Associated Actors and Artistes of America. Bikel once reflected: “Retiring – within that word is tiring, and I’m not tired. I don’t believe in retirement, really.”\n\nAt news of his death, US Equity paid tribute to his tireless campaigning.\n\n“From the time he joined Equity in 1954, Bikel has been an advocate for the members of our union and his extraordinary achievements paved the way for so many,” their statement read.\n\n“No one loved theatre more, his union better or cherished actors like Theo did. He has left an indelible mark on generations of members past and generations of members to come.”"
