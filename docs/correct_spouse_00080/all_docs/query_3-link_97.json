In the next presidential election, we may be choosing between the oldest president ever (Joe Biden, who would be 82 at the start of his second term) and the second oldest (Donald Trump, who would be 78 at the start of the term). The advanced age of candidates and incumbents, and the duration of their tenure, is striking: Think Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, Mitt Romney and the late Dianne Feinstein."
