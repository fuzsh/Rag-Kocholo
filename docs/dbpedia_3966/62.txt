Our Lady of the Light Catholic Church is a welcoming Catholic community of faith served now by the Augustinian Recollects. The church follows the teachings of Jesus Christ, of the Apostles and of the Magisterium of the Church to strongly believe in the love of Christ, who died and rose to life for all.

Worshiping God in the Eucharist, the Sacraments and Prayer to love, serve, and joyfully proclaim His Good News of salvation, sharing with others what we have received from Him.

As Godâ€™ stewards on earth we encourage the appreciation and practice of God-given gifts: Time, Talent, Treasure.

We entrust ourselves to the patronage of Our Mother, Our Lady of the Light to be good disciples of her Son, Jesus Christ.
