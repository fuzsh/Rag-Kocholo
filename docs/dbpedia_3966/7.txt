We would like to welcome you to the Clacton-on-Sea parish website.

We are located in the Diocese of Brentwood.

Our Lady of Light and St Osyth Church was built in 1902, through the working of Divine Providence. The establishment of the Shrine to Our Lady of Light, Spouse of the Holy Spirit and the securing of a parish priest to serve the Clacton area and the building of this beautiful church makes interesting reading and can also be found in specially printed booklets in the bookstand at the back of the church.

The parish website has been developed in order to provide local information for existing parishioners, visitors or new parishioners who may require the help that is available within the parish.

We hope that you will be inspired to support our beautiful church and to be supportive of our parish priest and the parish community.

The parish church is situated in Church Road on the east side of Clacton town centre, in the county of Essex, England. Clacton-on-Sea is the largest town on the Tendring Peninsula, and was founded in 1871. It is a seaside resort which attracts many tourists in the summer.
