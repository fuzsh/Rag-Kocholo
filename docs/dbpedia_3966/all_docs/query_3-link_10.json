        "text": "What year was the Cathedral of Notre-Dame built?\n\nConstruction began in 1163 on Île de la Cité, under the reign of King Louis VII, and the cathedral was largely completed by 1345, although many modifications and additions were made over the following centuries. It is one of the oldest and most well-known cathedrals in the world.\n\nIs the cathedral open?\n\nNo, the cathedral remains closed to the public until further notice. Notre-Dame de Paris is scheduled to reopen to the public by 2024.\n\nThe cathedral is still under restoration and reconstruction from the fire. No interior visits are possible at this time. In the meantime, you can explore Notre Dame virtually.\n\nThe cathedral’s “parvis” (an enclosed area in front of a cathedral or church) is accessible to the public since May 2020.\n\nWhere is Notre Dame located?\n\nNotre Dame Cathedral is a medieval Catholic cathedral located on the eastern end of Île de la Cité in Paris (small island in the Seine River). According to historians, Notre Dame de Paris was built on the ruins of earlier religious sites: a Roman temple dedicated to Jupiter and an early Christian Romanesque basilica.\n\nWhich arrondissement is it in?\n\nNotre Dame is located in the 4th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nNotre Dame de Paris address\n\nAddress: 6 Parvis Notre-Dame – Pl. Jean-Paul II, 75004 Paris, France\n\nNotre-Dame Cathedral: A Masterpiece of Architectural Splendor\n\nSituated in the heart of Paris, the iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral serves as a shining example of architectural genius and the artistic spirit of its era. Combining elements of both Gothic and Romanesque styles, the cathedral has captivated visitors worldwide, drawing them in with its breathtaking design and storied past. We’ll guide you through the cathedral’s most striking features and delve into the rich history that defines Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\nConstructed over the course of two centuries, from the 12th to the 14th with modifications made in the 18th century and a major restoration project in the 19th century, Notre-Dame Cathedral represents the progression from Romanesque to Gothic architecture. Its impressive façade is adorned with an array of intricate sculptures, each telling the tale of various biblical figures and events, and showcasing the talent of the artisans involved in its creation. The entrance is framed by three ornate portals – the Portal of the Virgin, the Portal of the Last Judgment, and the Portal of Saint-Anne – each bearing its own distinct narrative and symbolism.\n\nAmong Notre-Dame’s most noteworthy architectural features are the flying buttresses, a groundbreaking innovation from the Gothic period that enabled the construction of taller, more slender buildings. These external supports gracefully stretch from the walls to the ground, distributing the weight of the colossal structure and allowing for the installation of expansive stained-glass windows. The awe-inspiring Rose Windows, considered among the finest examples of Gothic stained-glass craftsmanship, drench the cathedral’s interior in a mesmerizing array of colors and light.\n\nThe interior of Notre-Dame is equally majestic, featuring a grand nave, elaborate rib vaults, and towering columns that create a sense of elevated space and height. The choir and high altar, situated at the core of the cathedral, are embellished with intricate carvings and artistic masterworks, inviting visitors to linger and reflect.\n\nOver the centuries, Notre-Dame Cathedral has endured the tests of time, conflict, and a devastating fire in 2019. Yet, its persistence and the ongoing restoration efforts speak to the unwavering spirit of the French people and their dedication to preserving this invaluable cultural gem. As a testament to human creativity and spiritual yearning, the exceptional architecture of Notre-Dame de Paris will continue to fascinate and inspire generations to come.\n\nNotre Dame Cathedral went through 5 major phases of construction:\n\nInitial Construction\n\nModifications and Adornments\n\nOngoing Modifications and Improvements\n\nMajor Restoration\n\nRebuild and Restore\n\nNotre Dame’s History\n\nThe cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris has gone through many changes in the past centuries.\n\nBy the 19th century, Notre Dame de Paris had fallen into disrepair and was in dire need of major restoration. Victor Hugo sounded the alarm in his novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, which brought renewed interest in the cathedral and its fate.\n\nApart from cleaning the cathedral’s western façade in the 1990s, Notre Dame Cathedral did not have any significant restoration work in over 150 years. As a result of time, weather, pollution and the inferior quality of stone used in the 19th century restoration, the cathedral was again in dire need of repair. To address these critical conditions, a second major renovation project was launched by the French government in 2018.\n\nOn April 15, 2019, the entire scope of the project changed when a devastating fire broke out under Notre Dame Cathedral’s roof. The fire destroyed the spire and caused extensive damage to the roof, vaults and interior of the cathedral.\n\nNow, the mission is to rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral. French President Emmanuel Macron has declared a deadline of opening the cathedral to the public by 2024, with renovation and restoration efforts continuing in the years beyond."
