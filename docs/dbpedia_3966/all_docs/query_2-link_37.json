        "text": "retreat\n\nDeepen your relationship with Jesus.\n\npray for peace\n\nPray for Peace\n\nWelcome\n\nOur Lady of Hope seeks to respond as a welcoming parish. All are welcome here: long-time parishioners, new arrivals, those seeking a spiritual home, those who have been away, members of the LGBTQ+ community, new Mainers, immigrants, and those who may be separated or divorced. We are all God’s children. All welcome.\n\n“We pray for those for whom home is no longer a safe place.”\n\nWelcome!\n\nA Welcome Message from our pastor\n\nParish Life Blog\n\nWeekly Reflections, Prayers and News\n\nSacramental Prep and Faith Formation\n\nConfirmation in the Restored Order\n\nLive Video from St. Pius X Church\n\nFor full-screen, scroll over the stream and click the screen icon in the lower right corner.\n\nGive Online\n\nCome Join Us\n\nComprised of a wide range of members, representing 25 area towns, we’re an intergenerational community inspired by Christ’s love for all people & the Ignatian vision that calls & empowers us to live the Gospel message and find God in all things.\n\nMass Schedule\n\nIn addition to the Masses listed here, Mass is celebrated in Loyola Chapel at Cheverus High School each weekday morning at 7:15 during the academic year.\n\nCalendar of Activities\n\nFind something that speaks to you and join us!\n\nSchool\n\nSt. Brigid School, our largest and most visible ministry, teaches and inspires over 360 students from around the region. From pre-K – 8th grade, St. Brigid is founded in the Mercy Tradition and guided by the Jesuit Educational Vision.\n\nFour Universal Apostolic Preferences of the Global Society of Jesus\n\nVital for our world today, these guide the work of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) through this decade and unite us in a common focus: Showing the way to God through the Spiritual Exercises and the practice of discernment; Walking with the poor, the outcasts of the world, and those whose dignity has been violated, in the mission of reconciliation and justice; Walking together with young people to build a hope-filled future, and Working together to care for the earth, our common home.\n\nWhat Our Parishioners are Saying\n\n“I’ve been a parishioner at Our Lady of Hope since I moved to Portland in 2003. Back then, I was a twenty-something attending Mass by myself. Now I’m here with my family, with my youngest son enrolled in the Faith Formation program and my oldest as an Altar Server.\n\nNo matter what stage of life I’ve arrived in, OLH has welcomed me with open arms. Years ago, I was interested in joining the music ministry. I gathered the courage to inquire about it, and was met with a whole-hearted welcome. Every time I’ve sought to be more involved in an event or ministry, I’ve been received the same way.\n\nThe congregation at OLH is friendly and warm, and I truly feel spiritually fed after listening to the homilies at Mass each week.”\n\n— Lauren Tigerman\n\nLearning about Ignatian Spirituality has helped me see God in everything. That grace has provided me great comfort and ease as I take on the days’ challenges.\n\n–Peter R.\n\n“…gratitude for the gift of being able to take part in the wonderful ministry at our Lady of Hope Parish through online Masses and the bountiful resources offered on the website. Though I live in (mid-Coast) and so am not able to participate in person, I receive great benefit from being a member of Our Lady of Hope’s “online community.”\n\n— C. J.\n\n“I have been attending the 5:00 Mass for almost two decades; it has been my go-to time of worship. If you also go to the 5:00 Sunday Mass, I’m honored, and grateful to share this time with you, worshiping together. Thank you for giving of yourselves by attending – I don’t take that for granted. But, fellowship amongst us can stretch beyond these four walls, and events offered by the parish events committee are designed not only as a major fundraiser(s) for our parish, but a form of fellowship for us all to enjoy together. So, I’d like to encourage you to consider joining in and seeing for yourselves what life is like in this parish outside these four walls.”\n\nScott, Portland"
