It has two gift shops and a walking trail to follow the stations of the cross. There are speakers at each stop where when you press a button, Bill Curtis gives a commentary on that specific station. There is beautiful music playing throughout the walk as well. I'm so glad I made a visit here! This is also free, but you can offer a donation if you wish.\n\nDulce Granados\n\n1722198786\n\nMuy hermoso la verdad pero si ban a venir vengan con aguas frías caminamos mucho el recorrido pero valió la pena\n\nMike Carpenter\n\n1721926012\n\nA beautiful and well-executed depiction of Christ's passion.

We've been there twice now and find it so peaceful and meditative. Be prepared to walk a fair distance but it is so worth it.\n\nPedro Lodise\n\n1721530246\n\nThis is probably the main attraction of Saint John Town.

Me alegro mucho de haberlos visitado, realmente lo recomiendo para ir con toda la familia👍👍Además tienen una tienda espectacular donde pueden encontrar demasiadas cosas relacionadas con el lugar .pusieron mucho amor y detalle en todo. ¡En primer lugar, el Monte Sinaí es más que increíble! Me hizo sentir como si estuviera allí. Fue muy emotivo ver la Crucifixión. Sentí las emociones correr. ¡Jesucristo pagó el precio! ¡Pero mi favorito fue la tumba! ¡¡¡¡Guau!!!! ¡Esto es todo lo que puedo decir! ¡Me dejó sin palabras! Este lugar es muy tranquilo y definitivamente es un lugar para visitar. Necesito volver\n\nvalena miles\n\n1711525816\n\nI can feel the Love ❤️ that was demonstrated from Jesus. This is must place to see and experiencing The Holy Land ba k in time. I would.also recommend the Upper Room that's right above the gift shop. I had my mother prize birthday party and church events. The staff members are very nice and Paul always take great care of me.. This is wonderful place to introduce Christ and win souls . People are amazed and lives are transformed . Thank you Jesus for this place.\n\nDalid Mikho\n\n1711460948\n\nThis was a great experience for my family. We spent 3 hours here walking through the Stations of the Cross, Moses and the 10 Commandments, Our Lady of Guadalupe plaza, the family plaza, and the two gift shops. Each station has a column that you can press a button and it will play a short audio talking about the station.\n\nZachary Hall\n\n1711411389\n\nThis place is amazing I think it’s worth going to as a non believer.\n\nTheresa Schau\n\n1711331848\n\nLove this place, back in the 1980’s I use to go there when the original statue of Mary stood and there was absolutely nothing there I would sit on the bench late at night and just contemplate. Amazing how much is built up , just a reminder how important Christ is. You leave knowing that he is all around us.\n\nThis place is always a great place to see and experience, and I would suggest it to anyone whether you're hardcore religious or not. It's a sight you won't forget soon and will probably tell your friends and family about later, and if you or one of your group members has problems walking they have wheel chairs as well\n\nIzabela Przybyla\n\n1698014850\n\nBeautiful and peaceful place!\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nSuch a peaceful and beautiful place!

I visited with my three children and they took pictures. I love the visual arts to help bring this story home my children aged 6,7, and 15 we all in awe as we followed the prayer trail. I will visit again by myself my children kept interrupting my prayers. Also it’s free they only ask for donations via a small box so please look for the donation box and donate before you leave. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽\n\nAbsolutely beautiful and highly recommend visiting.\n\nBest experience of my life! I left with a renewed sense of spirit and compassion, I highly recommend this place!\n\nWord's don't really do this magnificent place justice; it's all about what you experience while you're there. I fell in love with this place about 6 years ago, it's peaceful, beautiful, serene, magical, and the presence of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit is alive and well there. I thank God for whomever came up with thr idea to create this marvelous place, I thank God for the staff as well. No matter what you're going through, how you're feeling, when you start to walk on the Prayer Path it will leave you before you enter back into the gift shop! Thank you all for the wonderful experiences and may God continue to richly bless you and continue to build and create more Biblical scenes and tell the stories.\n\nIgnacia Colin\n\n1664806312\n\nTodo el lugar está muy bonito.

To say it was a moving experience would be an understatement! The staff is amazing & so knowledgeable making the experience that more meaningful! The gift shop is second to none with such a large variety of items. I go on lots of trips & I can say I’m excited to plan another trip back soon!\n\nAlma Romero\n\n1659205767\n\nQue vengan a visitar y a meditar las estaciones donde cristo fue crucificado es un hermoso lugar 🙏\n\nApril Smith\n\n1657515076\n\nBeautiful place to connect with the journey of Christ.

Thanks Good\n\nMónica Mancilla\n\n1656964680\n\nllevar agua suficiente.\n\nUn bello lugar !\n\nlleno de mucha calma y tranquilidad.\n\nThis is a great place to visit. my husband and I have visited more than once. We are Protestant but this is the shrine of Jesus Christ. no matter what denomination you are if you know Jesus or love Jesus visit this place.\n\nIt allows you to go back into time and walk the road of Via Dolorosa with Jesus Christ..\n\nWhen you reach the end and see him on the cross, the emotions is so strong is like being in the presence of the Lord.\n\nThe Ascension scene is very emotional and touching. If you love the Lord; you need to go see the shrine. Churches need to take field trips, Sunday Schools to the shrine.\n\nYou will not leave there feeling the same way that you did when you came.\n\nI knelt with Jesus in The garden of Gethsemane. So very close to the real thing that you feel the spirit of God.\n\nThe same way when you feel the spirit as you read the word and get into the word.\n\nI believe this place was ordained by the Lord\n\nReverend Tina Redden\n\nRitamarie Azarcon\n\n1650254633\n\nThey have great nativity sets both for the young and the young at heart. So many beautiful religious items to choose from. The Shrine of Christ's Passion giftshop is worth the visit.\n\nAmanda Heinz\n\n1650073677\n\nAn amazing and humbling experience! Such a powerful exhibit for anyone to visit - no matter where you are in your faith! Definitely a must see!!"
