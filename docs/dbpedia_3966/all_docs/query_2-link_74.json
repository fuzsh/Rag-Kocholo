Jean-Paul II 75004\n\nParis, France\n\nNearly synonymous with Paris itself, the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris is perhaps the jewel of the great churches of Paris. Despite the devastating fire in 2019, it is still a gorgeous and unique church in Paris that should be #1 on your Paris itinerary. In fact, historically, Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris was Europe’s most visited historical monument.\n\nConstruction of this iconic Gothic masterpiece began in the 12th century, in 1163, under the direction of Bishop Maurice de Sully and continued for nearly two centuries, culminating in the completion of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris around the year 1345.\n\nThe cathedral’s intricate architectural style is characterized by its stunning flying buttresses, stained-glass rose windows, and intricately carved sculptures and stands as a testament to the medieval craftsmen’s ingenuity and devotion.\n\nThroughout the centuries, Notre-Dame Cathedral has played a central role in French history, witnessing the most important French coronations, marriages, and significant religious events.\n\nHowever, perhaps its most famous moment occurred in 1831 when Victor Hugo’s novel “The Hunchback of Notre-Dame” brought the Notre-Dame de Paris further into the global spotlight.\n\nThe Notre-Dame Cathedral is beautiful to view from the River Seine as well and many companies offer boat tours for great photography of Notre-Dame!\n\nHow to Visit Notre-Dame Cathedral After the Fire – in 2023:\n\nAs of 2023, visitors may once again enter the square in front of Notre-Dame Cathedral as well as the Pont au Double, which connected the island of Notre-Dame with the Left Bank.\n\nVisitors may also enter the Crypt to see some of the treasures of Notre Dame, though the church itself and its towers remain closed. The reopening of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris is announced for the 8th December 2024 – I am looking forward to that day!\n\nWhere to Stay Near Notre-Dame de Paris, Accommodation in Paris:\n\nStaying near Notre Dame means staying in the heart of Paris itself! Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris lies in the Île de la Cité and is in the 4th arrondissement. The surrounding area is central to almost everything in Paris! You can search Expedia for awesome, refundable hotels in the 4th arrondissement in Paris!\n\n2. Saint-Sulpice Church\n\nFind it:\n\nÉglise Saint-Sulpice\n\n12 Place Saint-Sulpice\n\n75005 Paris, France\n\nThe Eglise Saint-Sulpice in Paris lies in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the 6th arrondissement. Much newer than Notre-Dame de Paris, Eglise Saint-Sulpice was built in the 17th century – and the current structure is actually the second church to be built on the site, the original church having been destroyed.\n\nYou’ll recognize it as you walk up to it by its mismatched towers that end in round turrets instead of spires. Eglise Saint-Sulpice is the second largest church in Paris, after Notre-Dame.\n\nA baroque church, and a Roman Catholic Church like the vase majority of churches in Paris, Saint-Sulpice Church has a very different architectural style from Notre-Dame Cathedral! Eglish Saint-Sulpice is also famous for having mismatched towers. And lately, it’s gained even more fame because Dan Brown used it for scenes in his famous novel, The DaVinci Code.\n\nSaint-Sulpice is famous for a number of reasons, the main reason being its incredible organ. The grand organ at Saint-Sulpice is considered by many the greatest organ in existence, and its organists – now and through history – some of the greatest to have lived.\n\nThe best way to visit Saint Sulpice: attend a religious service and hear the organ played! After the 10:45 am service [check times ahead of time in case there are changes] the organist usually gives an encore and mini-concert. Going to Mass at Eglish Saint-Sulpice is one of my favorite memories from visiting Paris and the organ music really is sublime!\n\n3. La Sainte-Chapelle – St. Louis’s Chapel\n\nFind it:\n\n10 Boulevard du Palais, 75001 Paris, France\n\nFor pure wonder and amazement, head to Sainte-Chapelle, very near Notre Dame. La Sainte-Chapelle is without a double one of, if not the, most beautiful churches of Paris.\n\nNot a cathedral or even a “church” in the traditional sense, La Sainte-Chapelle is actually a Royal Chapel, commissioned by King Louis IX (later Saint Louis) to house important relics that he acquired (including the purported crown of thorns of Christ.) Sainte Chapelle was built in the 13th century originally as a part of the Royal Residences on the Île de la Cité in Paris.\n\nSainte-Chapelle is famous on Instagram and with all kinds of photographers for very good reason! The upper chapel is adorned in 618 square meters of incredibly intricate stained-glass windows – that equals 1,113 stained glass windows in 15 glass panels and a Rose Window.\n\nThe chapel is built in a high Gothic style – making it feel high and sweeping! It is truly one of the finest religious buildings you will ever visit – a church in Paris no one can miss.\n\nBook Your Ticket to Sainte Chapelle —>>>\n\n4. Montmartre Basilica in Paris\n\nFind it:\n\n35 Rue du Chevalier de la Barre, 75018 Paris, France\n\nThe Basilica of Sacré-Cœur is unique amongst the churches in Paris because it is the only true Basilica.

Many people believed that the loss was due to spiritual poverty in the country, and leaders vowed to build a new Basilica to bring spiritual fervor back to France.\n\nThe all-white Basilica was not completed until 1919, also making it one of the newest churches in Paris. It is built in the Roman-Byzantine style. Inside the Basilica in the apse is a stunning mosaic, Christ in Majesty, one of the largest mosaics in the world.

L’église de la Madeleine\n\nFind it:\n\nPlace de la Madeleine, 75008 Paris, France\n\nL’église de la Madeleine, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, doesn’t look like a church at all: in fact it looks like a Greek temple!\n\nThe Madeleine church, named for Mary Magdalene in the Bible, doesn’t particularly look like a place of worship because it didn’t start out as one! The current Greek temple-style building is the third attempt at building a church on the site, the first two were torn down after the builders were dissatisfied with the attempts.\n\nThis present church building was actually begun as a temple by Napoleon Bonaparte to honor the French navy. Only later was it consecrated as a church.\n\nThe result is a neoclassical church with 52 Corinthian columns. On the pediment, the triangle part of the roof, the relief depicts the last judgment with Mary Magdalene praying to intercede for those who are lost (this was completed after it was decided to turn the building into a church!).\n\nInside the church are three domes that aren’t visible from tge outside and a particularly celebrated high altar with a statue of Mary Magdalene.
