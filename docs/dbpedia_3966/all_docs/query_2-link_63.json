        "text": "The initial phase of the decoration planned by the architect O'Donnell—very different from today’s—attracted much criticism. In fact, the wall behind the altar, which was very flat as dictated by English Gothic church tradition, had a large window that blinded worshippers by backlighting the ceremony.\n\nThe Fabrique, under the direction of pastor Benjamin-Victor Rousselot (1823-1889), then decided to redevelop the interior and hired popular Montréal architect Victor Bourgeau (1809-1888) for this project.\n\nFrom 1870 to 1900, Rousselot and Bourgeau worked on a style and symbolism inspired by the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, especially through the use of colour, gold-leaf motifs on the vault ceiling, and details on the columns.\n\nSix paintings from the old Notre-Dame were preserved and added to the current decor, as well as a Christ on the cross attributed to Paul Jourdain né Labrosse (1697-1769) hung on the east wall near the entrance. The high altar from the old church was placed in the side chapel dedicated to Saint Margaret of Youville.\n\nAt the request of Pastor Rousselot (1823-1889), the sanctuary’s decoration provides a “theological lesson” on the Eucharist. This sacrament commemorates Christ’s sacrifice and presence in Christians’ faith.\n\nAt the very bottom of the altarpiece there is a high relief of the Last Supper carved on wood. It is the institution of the Eucharist on the eve of Christ’s death.\n\nThe Crucifixion is in the centre of the altarpiece: Christ is shown dead on the cross, the Virgin and St John stand on either side of the cross, and Mary Magdalene is kneeling at his feet.\n\nAround the Crucifixion you can see four Old Testament scenes heralding the sacrifice of the cross and of the Mass.\n\nAt the top left, Moses prays in front of the Ark of the Covenant, in which is kept a pot of manna; he legislated on rules of worship.\n\nIn the upper right, high priest Aaron immolates a lamb according to tradition.\n\nIn the bottom right, the sacrifice of Isaac by his father Abraham.\n\nIn the bottom left: Melchizedek’s bread and wine offering.\n\nIn the upper part of the altarpiece, the Virgin Mary (after whom Notre-Dame is named) is crowned by her son, Jesus Christ. His royal attributes signal his victory over death through his resurrection.\n\nThe composition draws the eye upwards towards the vaulted ceiling, indicating the path to heavenly happiness, with its angels and stars on an intense blue background.\n\nThe pulpit is one of the Basilica’s treasures. In the past, the priest used to go up on it to pronounce his sermon. During the second interior decoration phase for the Basilica, architect Victor Bourgeau (1809-1888) adapted Henri Bouriché’s (1826-1906) original drawings, Louis-Philippe Hébert (1850-1917), a renowned Quebec sculptor, made the ornamentation. The Pulpit of Truth was the very last work created under Bourgeau’s direction before he passed away in 1888. It represents the components of Christian faith.\n\nAt its base are the two Old Testament prophets Ezekiel and Jeremiah carved in basswood. Above at the level of the guardrail, there is a series of statuettes representing Jesus Christ, Saint Peter and Saint Paul among others. A dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit, is depicted under the sounding board, accompanied by a shining triangle with the name of God in Hebrew written inside it."
