        "text": "From Darkness to Light: The Renaissance Begins\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, a period that took place between the fall of ancient Rome in 476 A.D. and the beginning of the 14th century, Europeans made few advances in science and art.\n\nAlso known as the “Dark Ages,” the era is often branded as a time of war, ignorance, famine and pandemics such as the Black Death.\n\nSome historians, however, believe that such grim depictions of the Middle Ages were greatly exaggerated, though many agree that there was relatively little regard for ancient Greek and Roman philosophies and learning at the time.\n\nHumanism\n\nDuring the 14th century, a cultural movement called humanism began to gain momentum in Italy. Among its many principles, humanism promoted the idea that man was the center of his own universe, and people should embrace human achievements in education, classical arts, literature and science.\n\nIn 1450, the invention of the Gutenberg printing press allowed for improved communication throughout Europe and for ideas to spread more quickly.\n\nAs a result of this advance in communication, little-known texts from early humanist authors such as those by Francesco Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio, which promoted the renewal of traditional Greek and Roman culture and values, were printed and distributed to the masses.\n\nAdditionally, many scholars believe advances in international finance and trade impacted culture in Europe and set the stage for the Renaissance.\n\nMedici Family\n\nThe Renaissance started in Florence, Italy, a place with a rich cultural history where wealthy citizens could afford to support budding artists.\n\nMembers of the powerful Medici family, which ruled Florence for more than 60 years, were famous backers of the movement.\n\nGreat Italian writers, artists, politicians and others declared that they were participating in an intellectual and artistic revolution that would be much different from what they experienced during the Dark Ages.\n\nThe movement first expanded to other Italian city-states, such as Venice, Milan, Bologna, Ferrara and Rome. Then, during the 15th century, Renaissance ideas spread from Italy to France and then throughout western and northern Europe.\n\nAlthough other European countries experienced their Renaissance later than Italy, the impacts were still revolutionary.\n\nRenaissance Geniuses\n\nSome of the most famous and groundbreaking Renaissance intellectuals, artists, scientists and writers include the likes of:\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452–1519): Italian painter, architect, inventor and “Renaissance man” responsible for painting “The Mona Lisa” and “The Last Supper.\n\nDesiderius Erasmus (1466–1536): Scholar from Holland who defined the humanist movement in Northern Europe. Translator of the New Testament into Greek.\n\nRene Descartes (1596–1650): French philosopher and mathematician regarded as the father of modern philosophy. Famous for stating, “I think; therefore I am.”\n\nGalileo (1564-1642): Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer whose pioneering work with telescopes enabled him to describes the moons of Jupiter and rings of Saturn. Placed under house arrest for his views of a heliocentric universe.\n\nNicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543): Mathematician and astronomer who made first modern scientific argument for the concept of a heliocentric solar system.\n\nThomas Hobbes (1588–1679): English philosopher and author of “Leviathan.”\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer (1343–1400): English poet and author of “The Canterbury Tales.”\n\nGiotto (1266-1337): Italian painter and architect whose more realistic depictions of human emotions influenced generations of artists. Best known for his frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua.\n\nDante (1265–1321): Italian philosopher, poet, writer and political thinker who authored “The Divine Comedy.”\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli (1469–1527): Italian diplomat and philosopher famous for writing “The Prince” and “The Discourses on Livy.”\n\nTitian (1488–1576): Italian painter celebrated for his portraits of Pope Paul III and Charles I and his later religious and mythical paintings like “Venus and Adonis” and \"Metamorphoses.\"\n\nWilliam Tyndale (1494–1536): English biblical translator, humanist and scholar burned at the stake for translating the Bible into English.\n\nWilliam Byrd (1539/40–1623): English composer known for his development of the English madrigal and his religious organ music.\n\nJohn Milton (1608–1674): English poet and historian who wrote the epic poem “Paradise Lost.”\n\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564–1616): England’s “national poet” and the most famous playwright of all time, celebrated for his sonnets and plays like “Romeo and Juliet.\"\n\nDonatello (1386–1466): Italian sculptor celebrated for lifelike sculptures like “David,” commissioned by the Medici family.\n\nSandro Botticelli (1445–1510): Italian painter of “Birth of Venus.”\n\nRaphael (1483–1520): Italian painter who learned from da Vinci and Michelangelo. Best known for his paintings of the Madonna and “The School of Athens.”\n\nMichelangelo (1475–1564): Italian sculptor, painter and architect who carved “David” and painted The Sistine Chapel in Rome.\n\nRenaissance Impact on Art, Architecture and Science\n\nArt, architecture and science were closely linked during the Renaissance. In fact, it was a unique time when these fields of study fused together seamlessly.\n\nFor instance, artists like da Vinci incorporated scientific principles, such as anatomy into their work, so they could recreate the human body with extraordinary precision.\n\nArchitects such as Filippo Brunelleschi studied mathematics to accurately engineer and design immense buildings with expansive domes.\n\nScientific discoveries led to major shifts in thinking: Galileo and Descartes presented a new view of astronomy and mathematics, while Copernicus proposed that the Sun, not the Earth, was the center of the solar system.\n\nRenaissance art was characterized by realism and naturalism. Artists strived to depict people and objects in a true-to-life way.\n\nThey used techniques, such as perspective, shadows and light to add depth to their work. Emotion was another quality that artists tried to infuse into their pieces.\n\nSome of the most famous artistic works that were produced during the Renaissance include:\n\nThe Mona Lisa (Da Vinci)\n\nThe Last Supper (Da Vinci)\n\nStatue of David (Michelangelo)\n\nThe Birth of Venus (Botticelli)\n\nThe Creation of Adam (Michelangelo)\n\nRenaissance Exploration\n\nWhile many artists and thinkers used their talents to express new ideas, some Europeans took to the seas to learn more about the world around them. In a period known as the Age of Discovery, several important explorations were made.\n\nVoyagers launched expeditions to travel the entire globe. They discovered new shipping routes to the Americas, India and the Far East and explorers trekked across areas that weren’t fully mapped.\n\nFamous journeys were taken by Ferdinand Magellan, Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci (after whom America is named), Marco Polo, Ponce de Leon, Vasco Núñez de Balboa, Hernando De Soto and other explorers.\n\nRenaissance Religion\n\nHumanism encouraged Europeans to question the role of the Roman Catholic church during the Renaissance.\n\nAs more people learned how to read, write and interpret ideas, they began to closely examine and critique religion as they knew it. Also, the printing press allowed for texts, including the Bible, to be easily reproduced and widely read by the people, themselves, for the first time.\n\nIn the 16th century, Martin Luther, a German monk, led the Protestant Reformation – a revolutionary movement that caused a split in the Catholic church. Luther questioned many of the practices of the church and whether they aligned with the teachings of the Bible.\n\nAs a result, a new form of Christianity, known as Protestantism, was created.\n\nEnd of the Renaissance\n\nScholars believe the demise of the Renaissance was the result of several compounding factors.\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, numerous wars had plagued the Italian peninsula. Spanish, French and German invaders battling for Italian territories caused disruption and instability in the region.\n\nAlso, changing trade routes led to a period of economic decline and limited the amount of money that wealthy contributors could spend on the arts.\n\nLater, in a movement known as the Counter-Reformation, the Catholic church censored artists and writers in response to the Protestant Reformation. Many Renaissance thinkers feared being too bold, which stifled creativity.\n\nFurthermore, in 1545, the Council of Trent established the Roman Inquisition, which made humanism and any views that challenged the Catholic church an act of heresy punishable by death.\n\nBy the early 17th century, the Renaissance movement had died out, giving way to the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nDebate Over the Renaissance\n\nWhile many scholars view the Renaissance as a unique and exciting time in European history, others argue that the period wasn’t much different from the Middle Ages and that both eras overlapped more than traditional accounts suggest.\n\nAlso, some modern historians believe that the Middle Ages had a cultural identity that’s been downplayed throughout history and overshadowed by the Renaissance era.\n\nWhile the exact timing and overall impact of the Renaissance is sometimes debated, there’s little dispute that the events of the period ultimately led to advances that changed the way people understood and interpreted the world around them.\n\nSources"
