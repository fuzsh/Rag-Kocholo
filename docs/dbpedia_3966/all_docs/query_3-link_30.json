In the Philippines, about 83% of the population belong to the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nOne of the traditions that Filipinos have been practicing is the Visita Iglesia, wherein the faithful visit at least seven different churches (sometimes even 14) on the evening of Maundy Thursday or on Good Friday, and pray before the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Catholics resorted to virtual or online Visita Iglesia. But now that travel restrictions have eased, Filipinos can go back to practicing their Lenten traditions.\n\nMetro Manila has over a hundred churches, some are heritage structures, such as the San Agustin Church, the Manila Cathedral, the Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene (Quiapo Church), and the Minor Basilica of St. Lorenzo Ruiz (Binondo Church), to name a few.
