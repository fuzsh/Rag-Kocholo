        "text": "Cathedrals are not only some of the most striking architectural wonders of religious history, but also of global history. One doesn’t need to consider themselves a spiritual individual to see the value in visiting these historic sites. Their carefully painted frescoes and carved steeples retell the records of the place and give insight into its community. The architecture of many of these religious structures influenced the growth of iconic movements, particularly the Gothic movement and its related variants, and served as inspiration for some of history's most renowned creatives like Leonardo da Vinci and Pierre Charles L'Enfant.\n\nWe've scoured the globe for the world's most beautiful cathedrals, from Mexico City to Moscow, and came across both famous and lesser-known architectural masterpieces. From the flying buttresses of Paris's best cathedrals to the domes of Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Kiev, these beautiful cathedrals of the world are sure to inspire your next trip across the pond—or country.\n\nThis iconic New York landmark receives approximately five million visitors a year. The cathedral was built in the latter half of the 19th century to symbolize the rise of religious freedom and tolerance in America.\n\nThough criticized for building St. Patrick's Cathedral too far outside the city during this time (though it is now on some pretty prime real estate), Archbishop John Hughes believed in his vision of building the most beautiful Gothic cathedral in the New World, which would one day be \"the heart of the city.\" Construction continued throughout the Civil War and was completed in 1878, fulfilling Hughes' dream.\n\nNotre-Dame is not only one of the most famous cathedrals in Europe, but in all the world. Situated in the heart of Paris right off the Seine, construction of Notre-Dame began in 1163, and it was consecrated 26 years later.\n\nWhile it's an impressive feat that the cathedral is still standing nearly 1,000 years after its construction, it has seen much damage and deterioration over the years. Its restoration can be attributed to Emperor Napoleon for making Notre-Dame his passion project after the French Revolution, as well as Victor Hugo's eponymous book. A fire broke out in 2019 during another restoration, destroying most of the roof and Viollet-le-Duc’s 19th-century spire.\n\nSt. Paul's is an Anglican cathedral located in London's city center. The site used to house a Roman temple to Diana and was dedicated to Paul in 604 A.D. The cathedral has gone through five iterations, the final in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, built by Christopher Wren (known as the greatest English architect of his time) after it was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666.\n\nWren combined Baroque, neoclassical, and Gothic elements, paying homage to both the English Restoration and 17th-century scientific philosophy. Some decorative changes were made to its interior in the 19th century to be more aligned with the Victorian style that dominated the period.\n\nAlexander Nevsky Cathedral is one of the largest Eastern Orthodox churches in the world and is one of Bulgaria's most popular tourist attractions. The cathedral was named after a Russian prince and honors Russian soldiers who died in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877, after which Bulgaria was freed from Ottoman rule. The cathedral was complete in 1912, with its name being temporarily changed shortly after, due to Russia and Bulgaria belonging to opposing alliances during WWI, but its original name was reinstated in 1920.\n\nWhat makes this structure so unique is that it's comprised of pieces from across Europe. Its marble parts and light fixtures were made in Munich, metal elements in Berlin, and its gates and mosaics in Venice."
