        "text": "Summary\n\nA Roman Catholic parish church constructed between 1887 and 1890 to the designs of Dunn and Hansom of Newcastle.\n\nReasons for Designation\n\nThe Church of Our Lady and the English Martyrs, a Roman Catholic parish church constructed between 1887 and 1890 to the designs of Dunn and Hansom of Newcastle, is listed at Grade I for the following principal reasons:\n\nArchitectural interest: * as the work of Dunn and Hansom, a highly significant architectural partnership noteworthy for their major contribution to the late-C19 architecture of the Catholic church in England; * for the building's landmark quality, found in its prominent position in the streetscape and skyline of Cambridge; * for the exceptional quality of its craftsmanship, architectural detail and building materials; * as an encompassing architectural vision, rich in symbolism internally and externally.\n\nHistoric interest: * as the physical legacy of the nationwide growth in the Catholic community during the C19; * as a record of the changing attitudes towards Catholicism in the late C19, seen in the contrast between the elaborate public display of the building's clear Catholic identity and the prevailing hostility still evident locally at the time of its construction; * as a significant example of female architectural patronage, being an entire church and separately listed presbytery produced for a single patron and completed in a single phase of work.\n\nGroup value: * for the strong visual and functional relationship with the attached Grade II listed presbytery, walls, gates and piers.\n\nHistory\n\nEngland’s many medieval churches had been built for a Roman Catholic mode of worship (the Latin rite). Elizabeth I’s 1559 Act of Uniformity rendered them all part of the Church of England and outlawed the Catholic Mass. The following two centuries imposed upon a diminishing minority of Catholic worshippers in England severe civil inequalities, public suspicion and periods of outright persecution. Catholic observance in Cambridge all but disappeared as the town became a centre of Protestantism and Puritanism.\n\nThe Second Catholic Relief Act of 1791 permitted the first new generation of Catholic places of worship to be built in England and Wales since the Reformation. They were forbidden to feature bells or steeples and were typically small, classically or domestically detailed, and were often hidden or set back from public view. The 1829 Act of Emancipation removed most remaining inequalities from Catholic worship and was accompanied by a growing architectural confidence.\n\nFor the first quarter of the C19 the nearest place for Catholic worship in Cambridge was at Sawston Hall, roughly 10km south of the city. In 1842, in the face of serious opposition, the first post-Reformation Catholic church in Cambridge was constructed on Union Road. Dedicated to St Andrew, the new church was designed by the highly influential architect AWN Pugin (1812-1852). By 1879 the small congregation at St Andrew’s set out to build a larger church and the adjoining land on Lensfield Road was bought by the Diocese of Northampton for that purpose, supported financially by the Duke of Norfolk. The old church would later be dismantled and re-erected as the Church of the Sacred Heart in St Ives, Huntingdonshire (Grade II).\n\nResponsibility for the creation of the new church was given to Canon Christopher Scott in 1884, and in the same year Yolande Lyne-Stephens agreed to fund the entire cost of the new building and its presbytery. A competition for the design of the church was won by Dunn & Hansom of Newcastle. Bishop Riddell of Northampton laid the foundation stone on 30 June 1887 and the building was consecrated in October 1890. The majority of the work was carried out by the significant local firm of Rattee & Kett. As with the earlier church, the project was dogged by serious anti-Catholic opposition. The new church was dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption and the English Martyrs (in later years referred to as OLEM). By the time of its completion the total cost had risen from £30,000 to £70,000.\n\nThe new building was one of the largest Catholic churches in the country in 1890 and was built at a prominent crossroads sometimes known as Hyde Park Corner. The height of the spire at 65 metres is only slightly lower than the tower of Ely Cathedral. Its large size, landmark features and arresting architectural detail were intended in part to befit its anticipated role as the centre of Catholic life at the University, though soon after its completion a dedicated Catholic chaplaincy was established instead.\n\nOn Shrove Tuesday 1941 bomb damage caused the stained glass in the apse and aisles to shatter; the windows were later repaired by the Hardman firm. Whilst the repairs were underway, some plain or simplified glass was introduced to improve the level of light to the interior. The priests’ sacristy and the chapel of the Sacred Heart were also damaged.\n\nA major reordering following the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) was proposed in 1972-3 but resulted instead in a less radical scheme directed by Gerard Goalen who introduced the central altar. (A major architect of the Liturgical movement in Catholic church design, Goalen was born in 1918 and died in Cambridge in 1999.)\n\nArchibald Dunn (1832-1912) and Charles Hansom (1842-1900) began their architectural partnership in 1871 and were later joined by Dunn’s son, also called Archibald, in 1887. They specialised in Catholic building projects, often in the north of England. Many of their buildings are now listed, some at a high grade, including the tower of the Catholic cathedral in Newcastle (Grade I), and the chapel of Stonyhurst College (Grade II*).\n\nYolande Lyne-Stephens was born Pauline Duvernay and had been a successful ballet dancer in France before her marriage to Stephen Lyne-Stephens. On the death of her husband in 1860 she inherited a considerable fortune and became a generous supporter of Catholic causes. Her patronage for Catholic church buildings included the support of the mission at St Mary’s Church in Thetford, and the construction of a chapel at her estate in Lynford, Norfolk (both Grade II*).\n\nDetails"
