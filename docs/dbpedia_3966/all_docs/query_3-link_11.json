        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nNotre Dame Cathedral is one of the most iconic and famous buildings in the world, located in the heart of Paris. The French name Notre Dame means \"Our Lady\" in English and it is dedicated to her. In cathedrals, the altar is placed in the east end where the sun rises, which symbolizes the Son of God, so the entrance of the church is always to the west. The book of Ezekiel in the Bible describes the ideal temple as a building oriented in this way, with the entrance to the west, opening directly into the sanctuary. Not all churches are built following the rule, but only important ones, like cathedrals and major churches in monasteries, abbeys, and military orders in the medieval world. Notre Dame was completed in 1345, but the site's history stretches back much further. In fact, no less than 11 churches have stood where Notre Dame currently resides, dating back all the way to the Roman Empire in the 4th century. The first church was a Roman temple dedicated to Jupiter, which eventually gave way to a Basilica in the 4th century. When Christianity was established as the official religion of the Roman Empire, Notre Dame was converted and expanded over the years to accommodate its growing congregation. The church was so essential to Paris and its people, more space was needed, leading to the much grander version we know today. Although it was damaged during the French Revolution - and later extensively restored - the Cathedral remains engulfed in history.\n\n2. Notre Dame Cathedral: A Historical Overview\n\nThe cathedral was initially known as Notre Dame de Paris, or Our Lady of Paris, and was a parish church that had been built on the Île de la Cité in the middle of the Seine River in the first part of the third century, along with an early Christian basilica. The building of the current cathedral was started in the mid-twelfth century and finished one hundred years later. The cathedral builders introduced many new architectural techniques. For example, the building was one of the first to be constructed with flying buttresses, an external masonry structure that was used to support the great outward thrust created by the roof vaults. The work at the main facade of the cathedral began in 1200 and its sculptures were completed circa 1250. At the cathedral, the statues that decorated it illustrated stories from the Bible and explained dogmas. During the 1990s, a large restoration program was initiated and, during the works, research discovered that the original cathedral was not as monochromatically white as had been believed. The 2010s commenced with a hearty celebration of the completion of the restoration of the great organs of the cathedral. The archdiocese had planned a 2020 celebration for the first Christmas Mass at the cathedral following a general restoration which, unfortunately, never occurred. Notre Dame is one of the most famous European cathedrals, and is classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. During the first week of the spring of 2019, on April 15, a fire largely destroyed the roof and the adjacent wooden spire. Other sections of the building and works of art were damaged by the heat and the debris of the collapse. The goal of this paper is to signal the essential facts of Notre Dame's architecture and history. It is based on the analysis of the architectural surveys, study of the already published documents and original studies.\n\n3. Architectural Features of Notre Dame Cathedral\n\nNotre Dame is a foundational figure in French Gothic architecture, not only for the physical shape and appearance it gave to this new style of architecture, but also for the intellectual eminence it held in such an important prelude to its design. These unforeseen financial resources must have provided an enormous windfall for any architectural projects of the mid-fifteenth century, especially one associated with a relic attended by the religious orders. Perhaps from the earlier generous sponsors with royal patronage, the cathedral secured the necessary revision of the earlier nave arcading to accommodate a more grandiose clerestory and flying buttresses. Thanks to Simon for undertaking the tasks of widening the space and heightening the airspace between the nave piers. These professionals, therefore, collectively benefited from and seem to have contributed to a period in which some engineering techniques that were to facilitate the spread of High-Style Gothic architecture across Bourges and other centers of Western France.\n\n3.1. Gothic Architecture in Notre Dame\n\nIn Paris, the architects of the Church of Saint Denis delivered a two-part innovation, which set the stage for the development of all subsequent European architecture and construction techniques. Their innovation was a new way to structure the load-bearing components of buildings, so that they were able to integrate tall, aesthetically pleasing windows between the beams and columns. This invited the passage of light and air into the interior, delivering a magical atmosphere of blessing and space that inspired all who passed within its confines. This new structural and lighting technique was called the Gothic (or Gothic) style, a phrase chosen by its opponents in order to criticize what they perceived as a disrespectful ethnic deviance that could only encourage the decadence of Western civilization. By 1145, the Cathedral of Chartres was completed, and within 55 years, the innovation resulted in a church building boom that involved 80 new structures. (Voiding cathedrals was a dissertative business indeed.) Or maybe this new style was highly attractive because it conveniently formed a continuum with local building traditions and fulfilled the most advanced human needs for both private envy and public clemency.\n\n3.2. Notable Sculptures and Artwork\n\nThe sculptures and vast amount of artwork found in the cathedral, even today after the revolution, is astounding. Some of the well-known ones include the north rose, the largest of the three roses, which dates back to 1250. It has 84 compartments with 36 ancient story windows, 12 Old Testament prophets, 12 apostles, and 24 crowned statues of monarchs responsible for the principal events in our Lord's life. Even more surprising is the number of statues at the entrances. The most in evidence is the main portals are those of the Last Judgment on the South Portico, those of the Apostles at the midnight Mass on the main gate which has been rerouted on the Cathedral Square. There are also statues on the two doors of the North Gate, as well as the statues of St. Michael, the Virgin, and the Apostles at the top of the arches of the portal of Creation. The figures in the portals, painted around 1235, are marvelous: thickset, often peasant-like, and seemed to belong to the same group. Their feet are well anchored to the ground beneath, and all around are the decorum of heaven, hell, and the celestial court. In addition to these life-size figures, there are at least 280 smaller statues of nearly 2 feet tall in the line over the lintels and the archivolts. The grand arches can show scenes depicting not only single deities with the prophets or Elders of the Apocalypse, but the hierarchy of the choirs in heaven with the Angels, the mobile quadrupeds, and the children's head (seraphim, cherubim, and thrones). There are 22 large statues on the northwest side of the portico. The south facade of the cathedral was not incorporated until the 14th century and is similar in style to the Sainte-Chanel Portal. The number of statues cannot be matched between the two because this facade is much smaller in size than that of the pirate.\n\n4. Notre Dame Cathedral: Historical Events and Symbolism\n\nIt will be quite useful to consider some historical and religious events which are symbolically reflected in the construction of the Notre Dame Cathedral. The history of the medieval church itself is so tightly bound with dramatic and tragic events that every tourist in the fantastic caves of limestone actually feels the tragic destiny of Notre Dame. The first cathedral in Paris was built back in 366. In the 8th century, after the adoption of Christianity, it became the center of the bishopric of Paris. In 1140, at the height of the Romanesque style in Paris, the newly elected Bishop Maurice de Sully asked permission from King Louis VII to dismantle the existing church and use its foundation for the new construction. So, Notre Dame became the first spread of the new architectural style - high Gothic. Maurice de Sully was a devout Christian and an ardent follower of the ideas of Peter the Venerable, who was struggling for the purity of the Catholic faith. Maurice sincerely sought to enlighten the pagans, sprinkled with the blood of martyrs, the Nativity of the Lord and the Epiphany on the festive calendar for the sake of commemorating the Birthday of Christ and His Baptism. However, Maurice was destined to die long before the laying of the last stone in the newly built temple, the European religious and civil wars and the movement of skeptical humanism. Only the first three portal pediments shaped on which the sculptor's art was so vividly presented with biblical and evangelical scenes like carved pages in a huge book. The last notes of stone music will still be played out, but the organ under the stained glass will show already different notes.\n\n5. Reconstruction and Restoration Efforts\n\nSince at least 2010, the structure has been undergoing renovation, and several months before the fire, scaffolding covered the roof behind the nave. Notre-Dame's wooden roof was constructed of an estimated 1300 trees. Carpenter Jean-Luc Lefrançois estimates it would take at least 12 years to fully replace the roof with trees of the right size, which would need to be cut from a similar forest (not France's domestic variety). In terms of restoration work, forest associations stress that most of France would not be able to supply the wood needed for the frame, and they look towards Germany and Poland. It is estimated it would take about 500 oak trees just to replace the medieval frame, and they would be needed for about 100 years from now. On 11 April 2019, junior Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez announced that all 16 copper statues from the church had been removed. He also announced the extent of the damage would not be known until engineers could enter the structure, which could take several days. Artworks from inside the cathedral were not removed as it was feared that they would be damaged in the process. Despite early reports that art experts had given them reason to hope the organ had not been damaged, inspection by Francis Chapelet led to the negative conclusion that the entire organ probably needed to be replaced due to lead dust and water damage. Although the cathedral's two pipe organs have been damaged, Noëlie Marchand, who works at Notre-Dame, has since written that Pierre Pincemaille, who contributed to the organ, said there were designers and plans for a new one. Mayor of Paris Annie Hidalgo agreed with experts about the most likely need for a full replacement, noting the extent of the damage."
