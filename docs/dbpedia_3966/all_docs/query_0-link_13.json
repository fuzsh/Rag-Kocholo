However, in the 18th century, writers and architects began to reevaluate Gothic architecture, recognizing its artistic and cultural significance. They saw it as a departure from the rationalism and restraint of neoclassical architecture, instead embracing its ornate decoration and dramatic use of space. Thus, Gothic Revival architecture represents a revival of interest in the architectural forms, motifs, and techniques of the medieval Gothic style.\n\n4.
