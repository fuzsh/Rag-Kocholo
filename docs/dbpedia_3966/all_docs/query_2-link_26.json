        "text": "Through our sacred music at the National Shrine, we strive to transform hearts and minds through the power and beauty of music in the Roman Catholic Liturgy.\n\nAlthough its foundation stone was laid in 1920, this great shrine seems to have been conceived of as early as 1846, the year the Bishops of America declared the Blessed Virgin Mary the patroness of the United States under her title of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nLighting a candle for loved ones or personal intentions is a longstanding tradition in the Catholic Church. We invite you to join us in this tradition by lighting a candle at the Basilica.\n\nWith over 80 chapels and oratories honoring the Mother of God and representing peoples from every corner of the globe, the Basilica reflects the cultural diversity of the United States.\n\nMary’s Shrine is a living place of prayer and worship. The prayers we offer for you, your family, and your friends are one of the many ways that we fulfill our important mission as a national sanctuary of prayer and pilgrimage.\n\nEach day we pray for people from across the United States and around the world and present their needs to the confidence and loving intercession of Our Lady."
