        "text": "1) San Miguel Mission [Oldest Church in the U.S.] (must see)\n\nBack in 1610, some Franciscan friars got busy and put up what's now the oldest church in the States. This was Santa Fe's first church, and those Spanish missionaries were smart enough to plonk it down across the river where the native folks were hanging out. They were all about spreading the good word, so they whipped up this mission before even sorting out their own church closer to the Plaza.\n\nNow, this place has seen its fair share of facelifts, so it's tough to say what's original and what's not. It's made of adobe with walls about five feet thick, and they threw in some stone buttresses in 1887 to keep everything from going sideways. The original church was likely a bit smaller, but it's been spruced up despite being set on fire during the Pueblo Revolt, and keeps standing on the same old foundations.\n\nBut enough about the exterior—let's dive into some juicy bits. The interior snug and whitewashed, with a restored late-18th-century altar screen that's seen its fair share of adventures. Covered in layers of house paint for years, it is the handiwork of an anonymous Mexican artist and acts like a giant picture frame, stuffed with oil paintings and bultos (fancy term for those painted wooden saint statues). And if you peek beneath your feet, you'll catch a glimpse of the church's original foundations—talk about history underfoot!\n\nTucked away at the back, San Miguel's old bell supposedly hails from Spain way back in 1356 – or so the engraving claims. Historians aren't buying it: They reckon it's more likely a sneaky defect that made an 8 look like a 3. Anyway, it made its way to the New World and landed here in the early 1800s, and it still hums like a charm, even with just a little tap.\n\n2) Loretto Chapel (must see)\n\nLoretto Chapel, the first Gothic-style building west of the Mississippi, was constructed alongside the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi for the Sisters of Loretto, New Mexico's pioneering nuns. Originally named the Chapel of Our Lady of Light, this project kicked off in 1873 with the aim of mirroring the grandeur of Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, France. The Chapel's materials, including stones from quarries 200 miles south, and the expertise of French architects and Italian stonemasons were shared with the Cathedral Basilica. With its spires, buttresses, and imported harmonium and stained-glass windows from France, Loretto exudes architectural splendor.\n\nBut what truly draws the eye is the exquisite spiral staircase, dubbed the \"Miraculous Stairs\", leading to the choir loft. Crafted entirely from wood, this marvel winds gracefully without any central support pole, defying gravity like it's no big deal. Legend has it that in 1878, a mysterious carpenter, seemingly guided by the Sisters of Loretto's spiritual call, silently toiled for six months flat to create this masterpiece. And then, like a true mystery man, he vanished into thin air, leaving behind nothing but whispers of his craftiness. These fascinating tales, along with other historical nuggets, are shared on a looped recording inside the chapel.\n\n3) Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi (must see)\n\nSanta Fe's majestic Cathedral Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, at the end of East San Francisco Street, is a testament to the vision of Bishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy, who oversaw its construction over a span of 15 years in the late 19th century. Known for his determination to \"elevate\" the city to European standards, Lamy's ambitious project resulted in this grandiose cathedral, towering over the landscape.\n\nLamy's disdain for the local religious customs, including the cult of the Virgin of Guadalupe and the Penitente brotherhood's practices, drove him to build a cathedral that surpassed the aesthetics and standards of the existing adobe structures. The original tiny adobe church dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi, standing for 170 years, served as the framework for the new stone cathedral, constructed in Romanesque Revival style. However, due to financial constraints, Lamy's dream of domed towers atop the facade remained unfulfilled.\n\nInside, visitors are greeted by Gothic-inspired architecture, flooded with light from glowing stained-glass windows. A striking gilt altar screen, installed in 1987 for the building's centennial dedication, showcases primarily New World saints, including Kateri Tekakwitha, a 17th-century Mohawk woman canonized in 2012. Adjacent to the main altar stands the salvaged adobe chapel dedicated to La Conquistadora, a revered Native American statue with a storied history dating back to the 17th century.\n\nAs you make your grand exit, take a moment to appreciate the great cast-bronze doors, each panel telling a tale of New Mexico's Catholic history. These doors offer glimpses into the cathedral's past, including scenes of Italian stoneworkers constructing the edifice and families fleeing during the 1680 Pueblo Revolt—a rare depiction sympathetic to the Spanish perspective.\n\n4) Holy Faith Episcopal Church\n\nChurch of the Holy Faith is an historic Episcopal church. The parish was established in 1863 and is the oldest Episcopal church in New Mexico. In its early days, many of the church members were the Anglo soldiers and officers garrisoned in Santa Fe during the American Civil War.\n\nThe first church building was completed in 1882 in a style known as \"folk gothic\" which resembles the architecture of many English cathedrals and parish churches dating from the simplified style of the 13th century. The building was also one of the first dressed-stone buildings in Santa Fe at the time.\n\nIn the 20th century, the church's physical footprint grew under two projects led by Santa Fe architect and parishioner John Gaw Meem whose Pueblo Revival architecture became known as “Santa Fe style\". Meem designed the church's adjacent parish house, now known as Palen Hall, which was completed in 1926. Towards the end of his career, Meem expanded the sanctuary, adding a chancel and choir in 1953.\n\nWhat you see today is a simple gothic structure with a clear Santa Fe flavor. Go visit it if you are in the neighborhood.\n\n5) Scottish Rite Masonic Temple\n\nThe Scottish Rite Temple, also known as Scottish Rite Cathedral or Santa Fe Lodge of Perfection was built in 1912.\n\nThe structure was designed by the Los Angeles architectural firm of Hunt and Burns who were known for their designs in the California Spanish Mission Revival architecture style. But Hunt and Burns decided to go with a design that bridges the Spanish building tradition of New Mexico and that of the Moors in southern Spain.\n\nThe final product is a Moorish Revival style structure based loosely on one of the gatehouses to the Court of the Lions at the Alhambra in Spain. The building bears some obvious similarities with the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles, which was being designed by Hunt and Burns around the same time, including the tower but without the Islamic entry.\n\nA special note about the building is that is was built before Santa Fe introduced strict building ordinances governing the architectural style of all buildings in Santa Fe, namely Pueblo Style, Territorial and Norther New Mexico. With its Moorish influenced architecture and pink color, the Scottish Rite Temple looks decidedly next to the other buildings on the block.\n\nMaybe because its unique look, the building was chosen to serve as the filming location for the 2016 Tina Fey film Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.\n\nSight description based on Wikipedia."
