        "text": "As a city with ambitions for a modern cultural policy, only very few people in the 1950s had the 'economic miracle city' of Wolfsburg in mind. However, various actors from the factory and the city began to use contemporary art to create a counterbalance to everyday working life in the \"shanty town\" for the inhabitants of the young VW city. As it turned out: a 'cold start' with success.\n\nAs the town, which was only founded in 1938 as a Nazi model settlement, had no artistic tradition to draw on, it made a virtue of necessity and promoted young art in a variety of ways. A visible expression of this was the awarding of the art prize junge stadt sieht junge kunst from 1959. At that time, various artists began to settle in Wolfsburg and set up their studios in the city's Renaissance Palace after being approached by Lord Mayor Uwe-Jens Nissen: The artists' collective Schloßstraße 8 was founded there in 1961. Heinrich Heidersberger and Gustav Kurt Beck, two internationally renowned artists, were among the founding members. They were joined by the Szaif-Pawlowa couple, Helga Pape and Paul Kurt Bartzsch, among others. Over the course of the 1960s, the group continued to grow with the addition of Katrin Brandt, the Siems couple and Rudolf Mauke. It existed in various constellations until the late 1980s.\n\nA council resolution was also passed in 1959 to regulate \"art in architecture\", according to which funds had to be set aside for the artistic design of new public buildings in proportion to the construction costs. The resolution is also regarded as the beginning of the field of \"art in the cityscape\". This helped the group of artists to increasingly make their artistic mark on the city. At the same time, it helped to establish the city's reputation as a place for young art. From murals and ceramic reliefs to fountain sculptures, there are numerous examples of their lively activity in the cityscape. However, it was not only works by the city's 'Haus und Hof' artists that were realized at the time. There were also sculptures from the workshops of Gerd Winner and Henry Joseph Lonas or, more recently, the bronze figure Early Forms by Tony Cragg or Sina Heffner's giraffe.\n\nAlthough the former Lord Mayor of Wolfsburg, Volkmar Köhler, himself a contemporary witness and pioneer of the city's early art policy, believes that the \"art in the cityscape\" that has been realized is \"not as glamorous\" as the collection in the castle, the works that have actually been realized have been (and still are) mostly well received by the city's population. Affectionately bestowed nicknames testify to an active and, as it were, stubborn engagement with local art: After all, who doesn't know the \"Backenzahn\" on Klieversberg or the \"Orgel\" on Rathausplatz?\n\nThe texts on \"Art in the cityscape\" were compiled by Maik Ullmann in 2020/2021. They were edited by Dr. Alexander Kraus."
