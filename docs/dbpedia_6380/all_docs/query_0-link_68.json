Remmick-Hubert's Notes:\n\nOchsner Family Home Site\n\nWeikum Letter\n\nGreiss Family and other families from \"A\" to \"Zzzz\" in Edenkoben /Palatinate, Germany\n\nIn a message dated 8/1/03 3:09:29 PM, ygrimmer@yahoo.com writes Wenderoth [Winterrot, Winteroth of Bammental Baden, Germany]:\n\n<< Hi Judy:\n\nMr. Vern Carpenter published a book on the descendants of Caspar Wenderoth of Bammental, Baden, Germany and Margaretha Strep of Meckesheim, Baden, Germany. The book is red with gold letters. On the spine of the book is WENDEROTH; on the front of the book is nine different spellings for Wenderoth. There are 287 pages + Two Indexes: pages 288-372 are surnames A-Z + pages 373-384 are surnames of all the different spellings of WENDEROTH (over 20). My family has had the WINTRODE spelling for many years.\n\nI.\n\nCaspar Wenderoth, 1705-1777(?) and Margaretha (Strep) 1711-1772(?) sailed\n\nto America on the ship \"Pleasant\" in 1732, just after they married. They\n\nsettled in New London, PA for about two years, then took up Lord Baltimore's\n\noffer of 200 acres of land for married men, for a penny per acre per year,\n\nfirst three years free. Of course, Caspar and Margaretha were right in the\n\nmiddle of a disputed area claimed by both Lord Baltimore as Maryland, and by\n\nWilliam Penn as Pennsylvania. They were very active members of the\n\nEvangelical Reformed Church of Frederick, Frederick County, MD. Caspar was\n\nnaturalized 27 April 1753, in the Provincial Court, Frederick County, MD.\n\nAt Caspar's request, it was recorded 6 Jun 1761. Liber G. p.20. Frederick\n\nCounty Circuit Court.\n\nII.\n\nJacob Wenderoth 1735-1797 born in Prince Georges County, MD; served in the\n\nFrench-Indian War (\"Pioneers of Old Monocacy-The Early Settlement of\n\nFrederick County, Maryland, 1721-1743\", by Grace L. Tracey & John P. Dern;\n\npage 378-380); married Barbara _____(?); lived in York County, PA; served\n\nin the American Revolution (which I haven't found his service records, yet,\n\nbut he is listed in the DAR Patriot Indexes). Jacob and Barbara were members\n\nof Christ Reformed Church, now in Adams County, PA.\n\nIII.\n\nHenry Winterroth 1767-1845 Frederick County, MD; married 1790 York County,\n\nPA to Margaretha Shabert/Shobert\n\n(\"Ohio Divorces: The Early Years\", by Bell - states that Margaretha's name\n\nwas Heming) (Henry's will states Margaretha's name was Schobert/Schabert).\n\nHenry was in public office in Columbiana County, OH in 1806. He moved to\n\nStark County, OH, then to Licking County, OH where he died at his son's\n\nhouse.\n\nIV.\n\nHenry Wintrode 1792-1866 Frederick County, MD; married 1815, Stark County,\n\nOH to Elizabeth Shively 1794-1867 Washington County, PA. Henry and\n\nElizabeth had a large farm in Andrews, Huntington County, IN. Both buried in\n\nRiverside Cemetery, Andrews.\n\nV.\n\nDaniel Wintrode 1824-1901Stark County, OH; married 1849 Huntington County,\n\nIN to Hannah Beauchamp 1820-1910 Wayne County, IN.

Martha was afflicted with epilepsy before\n\nchildbearing and after childbearing; she was in a mental hospital in\n\nRichmond, Wayne, IN at the time of her death. Both Curtis and Martha are\n\nburied in Riverside Cemetery, Andrews. Martha's mother, Mariah Phoebe Scott,\n\nwas a full-blooded American Indian; whose parents, William Scott and Martha\n\nO. Denton were from VA. I haven't discovered their American Indian tribe\n\nyet. William Scott was in the War of 1812.\n\nVII.\n\nClara Maude Wintrode 1889-1956 Andrews, Huntington, IN-Anderson, Madison,\n\nIN; married 1906, Huntington County, IN to William Tell Kumley 1869-1933\n\nLagro, Wabash, IN-Wabash, Wabash, IN. William's parents were from Wolfisberg\n\nand Wiedlisbach, Bern, Switzerland. Jacob Kumley, his father, was in the\n\nCivil War, 1861-1865 from Hardin County, OH.\n\nVIII.\n\nMary Elizabeth Kumley 1910-1987 Lagro, Wabash, IN - Wabash, Wabash, IN;\n\nmarried 1930, N. Fairfield, Huron, OH to Edward Albert Grimmer 1910-1976\n\nBucyrus, Crawford, OH-Washington Court House, Fayette, OH.\n\nMary and Edward, my mother and father, divorced; my dad enlisted in the\n\nArmy and my mother was in a mental health institution in Toledo, OH from\n\n1937 until the mid 1970's.

What a surprise!\n\nI have not found my Great Grandfather on your website,\n\nMy Grandfather never talked about his relatives, so we never knew anything other then he was German.\n\nOn page 152 on your website picture of [Wilhelm Roemmich b. 11/30/1862 ] might be the same person. He looks just like my Dad with a mustash !\n\nMy Dad grew up in Sutton NE.\n\nMy Grandfather's Brothers and sisters are\n\nKatrina , Elizabeth, William, Jacob, Orosalia, Amelia, Carl, Arvalia, and Kathrina..\n\nMy sister is going through some more stuff, I think that we have a picture of Wilhelm, and one of Carl and his sister's, probably 1908 or so. Carl had three sons: Donald [My father], Max, and Howard.\n\nI'm the youngest of five of Donald's children. The others are,\n\nRichard b. .....,\n\nTerry b.....,\n\nJeanna b.....,\n\nKendall b. ......\n\nI am going to try to get copies of the book and the video from NDSU\n\nWe never knew much about my mother's side of the family either. Her mother died giving birth to my mom, and was raised by her father's sister. From what I've been told, my Grandfather Bradsby is related to the founders of the Bradsby bat company { louieville slugger } and the Case Family. { Case knife comp.}\n\nAfter WW II everyone moved to Colorado, from Nebraska, and all of us still live here. I hope to learn my family's past, and if possible that I can fill in some gaps for your website. I always thought that my Grandfather and his parents came here all on their own, and that was that. To find this interesting story is really great.\n\nThanks again !

In 1809 and 1810 there were 4 Wiest families [all related] that came to Rohrbach (very near Worms) from the Rheinpfalz area in Germany. Since that time many came to the US and Canada. There are 5 people involved in trying to \"graft\" in different branches of the \"Rohrbach Wiest\" family tree. When we get info on, for example, an Elizabeth Wiest who married a Remmick, we want to figure out which family she belonged to.\n\nPart of our problem is that many of the Wiests came from the Reformed tradition, and on the PIXEL there appears to be only a few records from the Reformed side after 1860. So that leaves us with a big gap unless we can find someone who has an old Bible, or a family tree with some missing info that can tie that individual into the bigger \"Rohrbach Wiest\" family tree. >>\n\nIn a message dated 6/25/04 1:44:44 AM, Tatjana.Karlej@vbatue.fv.bwl.de writes:\n\nHello,\n\nyou don't know me, but I hope you would like to help me.\n\nI found your homepage on the internet by searchig for the name 'zimbelmann'. That name is included to your family tree and I thought you could help me searching for Conrad Zimbelmann and other Family members of Conrad Zimbelmann.\n\nMaybe they're named 'Zimblemann', 'Zimbelman' or 'Zimbleman' now.\n\nConrad Zimbelmann was born on Jan. 8, 1856 in Rohrbach, Cherson, Russia.

I am sorry I did not know how to address you as I could not find a name. Anyway I thought I would share what I have about the Winterroth family.\n\nMy maternal grandfathers is Christoph Winterroth, born 1893 in NeuGluckstal, Odessa, and married Anna Buelow, born 1895 in North Dakota.\n\nWilhelm Winterroth, born 1860 , in HOffnungstal, Odessa, married Rosina Walth, born 1863 in NeuGluckstal, Odessa. They emigrated to ND in 1909.\n\nGottlieb Winterroth, born 1826, unsure of birth place, married ELizabeth Geyer( of Grosslibental), Oct 26, 1850 in Freudental, Libental, Odessa. By 1858 they appear in the Hoffnungstal colony as living with a cousin. According to Gwen Pritzkau of Family History Center in Salt Lake City who helped with some research Gottlieb Winterroth's cousin was probably Gottfried Nehr's (also spelled Naher, Heer, Neer)wife, who was a Schweyer from Freudental.\n\nI know that Gottlieb Winterroth's wife was Elizabeth Geyer from our family bible listing as well as from the Gluckstal Colonies marriage record on film at Family History Center. I personally went to Grossbottwar, near Stuttgart, Germany, to see if I could find records of Winterroths as I thought Gottlieb Winterroth was from there as Stumpp says the Nehers were from there. The woman who kept the church records said no one by name of Winterroth had ever lived in that village. But, in Oberstadt, the neighboring village a Heer had emigrated to So Russia but she thought he went to Bessarabia.\n\nHow we think this Gottlieb Winterroth might be related to the other Winterroths in Worms is that his father was a brother to both Margaret and Sibilla Winterroth. Margaret married #1 a Rommich, #2 John George Bier. Sibilla married Georg Friedrich Bier. ELizabeth, Margaret, and possible the father of Gottlieb were born in Bammental, Heidelburg, Germany, but Sibilla appears in the Darmstadt records as born in 1806. Gwen thought that the parents Johann Philipp Winterroth and Catherine Elizabeth ---- left Bammental to move to Darmstadt then after 1806 moved on to South Russia.\n\nWhat I have is that Johann Philipp born 1776 was brother to Anna Maria who married Michael Reichel, Elizabeth who married Karl Feil, and Anna Felictius who married Christian Schmeir who had a child Maria Elizabeth born 1800 who married Theobald Ochsner.\n\nHope this helps clarify some of the Winterroth relationships after 1826. I would love to know exactly who the father of Gottlieb Winterroth was and why no records appear in all the census in So Russia.\n\nThanks, again, for the opportunity to read through your wonderful webpage. I will surely use it many times.\n\nKaye Kuntz-Igoa\n\nrkigoa@earthlink.net\n\nDate: Sun, 28 Aug 2005 20:55:29 -0700 (PDT)\n\nFrom: Tracy Bell <infinity1432@yahoo.com>\n\nSubject: Your Roemmich Website\n\nTo: RemMick@aol.com\n\nHello RemMick@aol.com:\n\nI was curious about my paternal geneology and began searching the internet. I came across your gloriously in-depth website and was hooked. I am trying to find my lineage on your site and wanted to give you the information that I know.\n\nMy name is Tracy Bell (Roemmich). I will give you the information that I know and hopefully that can fill in some of the information that you have or may not have. I will start back as far as I know. The difficult thing is that there are so many with the same names...anyway\n\nMy Great, Great, Great Grandfather was a Jacob Roemmich with a son by the name of Philip and we think that one of the two of these was married to a woman named Magdelene...think it was Philip. One of Philip's son's was Leonard b. 3-15-1895 d. 11-9-1964 m. Lydia Kline. Their son Darrell George Roemmich was my grandfather. b.2-22-1927 d.11-22-1991 m. Madeline Smith and had 4 children. Thomas Darrell is my father and his siblings are Ronald d.10-26-1977, Sharon and Leonard.\n\nAnyway, any information that we could share would be appreciated. Your site is really something to see.\n\nRegards,\n\nTracy L. Bell\n\nDonald Ashley:\n\nSubj: Roemmich, John Henry, born April 7, 1814\n\nDate: Tuesday, January 16, 2007 1:15:13 PM\n\nFrom: DonAshley1\n\nTo: RemMick\n\ncc: DonAshley1\n\nHello! I have just discovered the www.remmick.org website. Thank you for creating and having it!\n\nI am descended from John Henry Roemmich (born Germany April 17, 1814, died December 11, 1893, in Germany) and who married Anna Katherine Satter (born Germany April 19, 1811, died March 18, 1888), and their son Jacob Philip Roemmich (born Edenkoben September 15, 1841, died Missouri December 7, 1920).\n\nI have the names and birth dates of his siblings, which include John Philip, John Henry, Anna Katherine, Nickolano, William, and Philippina.\n\nI cannot find a connection on your website.....can you help or make a suggestion?\n\nI am in possession of a hard-copy genealogy of the John Henry and Jacob Philip family which was put together by my uncle Lee J. Ashley in the late 1940s. Do you have a copy and are you interested in having it?\n\nMy line:\n\nJohn Henry (1814), Jacob Philip (1841), Wilhelmina (1887) (married Jeptha J. Ashley 1918), Jay J Ashley (____), Donald Ashley ___).\n\nI'd be very happy to hear from you! I am looking for a connection to the Kast family of Edenkoben, one of which migrated to the U.S. in the late 1800's or early 1900's.\n\nThanks!\n\nDonald Ashley"
