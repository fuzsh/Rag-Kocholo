In 2000 she completed her PhD at the University of London (Goldsmiths College, Department of Historical and Cultural Studies). Her PhD thesis was the origin for the book Travels and Exhibitions: D. Pedro V in Nineteenth-Century Europe (Lisbon: Gótica, 2003) which obtained the prize “Victor de Sá” in contemporary history in Portugal (2004).\n\nAfter her Goldsmiths PhD, she started working on Colonial India in the 19th and 20th century. Between 2003 and 2009 she was a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of the History of Art of the Faculdade de Letras (University of Lisbon) and, in 2008-2009, at the Department of Art and Archaeology of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS-University of London).\n\nHer Post-doctoral research resulted in a book – Other Orientalisms: India between Florence and Bombay (1860-1900) (Lisbon: ICS, 2009) – that has been published in India and Italy in 2012: Other Orientalisms. India between Florence and Bombay, 1860-1900 (New Delhi: Orient BlackSwan, 2012); Altri Orientalismi. L’India a Firenze (1860-1900) (Firenze: Florence University Press, 2012).\n\nAnother book on Colonial India has been published recently in Lisbon, Between Two Empires: Britsh Travellers in Goa (1800-1940). This work reflects on colonial comparisons between British and Portuguese colonial experiences, and historical and ethnographic writing on Portuguese India written in English and published in the English-speaking world, India or England.\n\nHer work on women artists and feminist art history has resulted in a book published in Portugal untitled: A Arte sem História. Mulheres e cultura artística (séculos XVI-XX) (Lisbon: Athena, 2012) [Art without History. Women and artistic Culture (16th-20th century).\n\nShe coordinated a two-year funded research project Knowledge and Vision. Photography in the Portuguese Colonial Archive and Museum (1850-1950), and the result was an edited book with 30 authors - The Empire of Vision. Photography in the Portuguese Colonial Context (1860-1960), published in 2014.\n\nHer work has concentrated on different kinds of knowledge production in a specific colonial context and on the circulation of this knowledge within a global context, crossing national and colonial borders. Her approach is mainly historical, but her research work greatly benefits from other areas, from visual culture to anthropology. Apart from her most recent work on the history of the production of knowledge on the context of colonial India, both British and Portuguese, some of her other research interests centered mainly on the 19th and 20th centuries are: history of collections, museums and exhibitions, travelling of people and objects, history of photography, cultures of birth, women artists and gender studies.\n\nBooks:\n\nEntre dois Impérios: Viajantes Britânicos em Goa (1800-1940) (Lisboa: Tinta-da-China, 2015).\n\nEd., O Império da Visão.
