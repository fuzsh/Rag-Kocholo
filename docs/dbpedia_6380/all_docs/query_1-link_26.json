For the online finding aid to the Jacques Derrida Papers at Irvine, click here.\n\nA duplicate set of the manuscripts housed at Irvine is available under the collection name Fonds Jacques Derrida at the Institut mémoires de l'édition contemporaine. For the online finding aid at IMEC, click here.\n\nAt the time of acquisition, inserted material had been systematically removed from a subset of volumes and placed in a number of subject-based boxes and envelopes. Notes received by PUL from the dealer reflect this and are quoted in this finding aid in the interest of making the history of the collection's custodial interventions fully transparent.\n\nAll separated insertions received by PUL were re-inserted upon receipt of the collection in an effort to preserve archival context and service the collection as close as possible to its working state.\n\nA small number of separated insertions were not received by PUL and are so identified in the finding aid."
