The total number of women was forty, of whom six had two pregnancies during the study period. Pre-pregnancy baseline characteristics and kidney function parameters of women with post-transplant pregnancies and matched-paired controls are depicted in . Between both groups, there were no significant differences in the age at pregnancy, age at transplantation, time from kidney failure to transplantation, and the time between transplantation and the start of pregnancy (or to the start of observation in the case of controls). Furthermore, the percentage of living donation, baseline allograft kidney function, and amount of proteinuria did not differ.\n\nTable 1\n\nPatient Characteristics *Pregnancy Group\n\nn = 40Control Group\n\nn = 40Statistical Group Difference (p-Value) Age at pregnancy (y) 32.5 ± 4.432.9 ± 4.9n.s.

The causes of kidney failure before transplantation were predominantly glomerulonephritis in both groups. Regarding immunological risks, the pre-existence of donor-specific antibodies was low in both cohorts, namely two women in the PG versus four women in the CG.\n\nIn the PG, eight women had a previous post-transplant pregnancy, six experienced pregnancy while being on hemodialysis therapy, and 15 reported a previous miscarriage. Six of the women became pregnant after their second KTX and one woman after her third KTX. Most of the cases were planned pregnancies, thus a change in immunosuppressive medication in advance was performed in 34 women, whereas 10 women did not change their immunosuppressive regimen due to dual therapy with CS and CNI. Two women had unplanned pregnancies with ongoing MPA intake. Both resulted in an abortion at gestational weeks five and twelve.\n\n3.1. Pregnancy Outcome\n\nA total of 39 out of 46 pregnancies ended up with a live-born baby, and the median gestational week at delivery or at the end of pregnancy was 35.15 weeks (IQR 31.5, 37.225). The reasons for a negative outcome were two early abortions before week 12 with exclusion from further analysis, one abortion at week 12, two induced abortions at weeks 19 and 22 due to severe fetal malformations, one abortion due to early bubble rupture at week 20 and one stillbirth due to severe preeclampsia at gestational week 25. Detailed adverse pregnancy outcomes and kidney function at the end of pregnancy are listed in .\n\nTable 2\n\nPatient Characteristics *Pregnancy Group\n\nn = 40 Pregnancy ≥ 12 weeks 38 Median gestational weeks (IQR) 35.15 (31.5, 37.225) Adverse pregnancy outcome 18 Severe hypertension **3 Acute kidney injury (AKIN) II6 Acute kidney injury (AKIN) III2 Gestational thrombocytopenia12 Abortion ≥ 12 weeks4 Stillbirth1 Early preterm delivery ≤ 32 weeks3 Intrauterine growth restriction8 Kidney function at end of pregnancy eGFR (mL/min)57.5 ± 27.1 Proteinuria (mg/g creatinine)1051 ± 1541 >500 mg/g creatinine (%)42.5 >1000 mg/g creatinine (%)30 ΔeGFR (mL/min)−5.5 ± 17.7 ΔProteinuria (mg/g creatinine)830 ± 1498 Deterioration of eGFR > 5 mL/min (%)50\n\n3.2. Maternal Outcome\n\nWe identified 18 pregnancies with adverse pregnancy (APEs) events defined as preeclampsia with severe features (as described in the Methods Section). To analyze the risk factors, we divided the PG by status for adverse events during pregnancy ( ). Within our cohort, frequencies of hypertension, diabetes, previous pregnancies, or miscarriages did not correlate with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Next, we analyzed if impaired kidney function was associated with a negative pregnancy outcome. This was not the case as kidney function at the start of pregnancy did not differ significantly between pregnancies with and without adverse events (eGFR of 61 ± 22 vs. 64 ± 22 mL/min, respectively, ). Next, we analyzed, whether an allograft’s renal reserve capacity, measured as the amount of maximal hyperfiltration during pregnancy compared to pre-pregnancy eGFR, was more relevant than an absolute cut-off value. We also analyzed whether a higher renal reserve was beneficial for better pregnancy and kidney outcome, and vice versa, or whether a diminished renal reserve capacity during pregnancy posed a risk for an APE. We observed a significant difference regarding the allograft’s renal reserve capacity during gestation between women without APE (+16.6 ±11.3 mL/min) and women with APE (+7.8 ± 13.9 mL/min, p < 0.05, A, ). Along the same line, the mean percentage of eGFR increase during pregnancy in relation to pre-pregnancy eGFR was 25 ± 17% in women without APE versus 10 ± 24% in women with APE (p < 0.01, B, ). In addition, the overall number of allografts with a >20% increase in eGFR from pre-pregnancy eGFR differed significantly between both groups (65% in women without APE versus 17% in women with APE, p < 0.01). The amount of proteinuria increased markedly during pregnancy ( ) but did not differ between pregnancies with and without APE (p = 0.476, C). We observed a weak positive correlation between better pre-pregnancy eGFR and the length of gestational weeks, and between higher renal filtration reserve of the allograft and the length of gestational weeks (Supplementary Figure S1). Regarding the intensity of immunosuppressive regimens, we observed a significantly higher amount of triple immunosuppression during pregnancy in women with adverse pregnancy events, which mainly consisted of CS, CNI, and azathioprine ( ). Serial fetal ultrasound measurements of uterine and umbilical arteries showed higher pulsatility indices (PI) of the uterine artery during weeks 24–26 in women with APE (p < 0.05, ).\n\nTable 3\n\nVariable *Pregnancy Group Wo APE\n\nn = 26Pregnancy Group\n\nwith APE\n\nn = 18Statistical Group Difference\n\n(p-Value) Age at pregnancy (y) 32.7 ± 4.333.1 ± 4.3n.s.

Women with APE showed a trend in a higher sFlt-1/PlGF ratio during the second trimester, but due to the low numbers of available measurements and large overlap, its usefulness as a risk predictor for pre-eclampsia and/or APE could not be analyzed sufficiently (Supplementary Figure S2).\n\n3.3. Allograft Function\n\nAs already pointed out, kidney allograft function at the start of pregnancy did not differ between the PG and CG ( ). Noteworthy, the eGFR slope from mean pre-pregnancy/matched pre-observation eGFR to the 24 months follow-up (FU) period after the end of pregnancy/matched observation showed a mean eGFR decline in both groups (−5.4 ±14.3 mL/min in the PG versus −7.6 ± 14.1 mL/min in the CG, n.s., A, ). The annual decline in kidney function was −3.4% in the PG versus −4.6% in the CG. Similarly, no significant differences were obtained regarding the mean levels of proteinuria between baseline and 24 months FU, although mean proteinuria increased significantly during pregnancy and was significantly higher at the end of pregnancy, defined as the timepoint of delivery or interruption of pregnancy (e.g., abortion) (1051 ± 1541 vs. 205 ± 225 mg/creatinine in PG vs. CG, respectively, B, , p = 0.011). To analyze the risk factors for the deterioration in graft function over time, independent of pregnancy, we analyzed both cohorts together, the PG and CG, stratified by status for deterioration in eGFR (eGFR decrease >5 mL/min) by 24 months after the end of pregnancy or a matched control time point ( ). We hypothesized that a negative eGFR slope instead of an absolute eGFR value right before pregnancy/observation might be more suitable to determine stable or worsening kidney function over time. Therefore, we analyzed eGFR slopes at 24, 18, and 12 months before the start of pregnancy/observation in all KTR and correlated this with eGFR at the 24 months FU endpoint ( C, ). Only the eGFR slope at 12 months before pregnancy differed significantly between women with stable (mean eGFR slope of 4.9 ± 12.0 mL/min) and worsening (mean eGFR slope of −3.9 ± 11.0 mL/min) kidney function. Thus, a negative eGFR slope 12 months before pregnancy/observation was associated with a risk of further decline in kidney function over time, independent of the status of pregnancy (p < 0.01). Furthermore, more allografts with a stable eGFR course over time showed the capacity for hyperfiltration, namely, to increase eGFR during pregnancy >15 mL/min or >20% from baseline eGFR ( ), which was in line with the observation that a higher renal reserve capacity correlated with a positive pregnancy outcome. We did not observe relevant differences regarding the increase in proteinuria during pregnancy between stable and worsening eGFR ( D).\n\nTable 4\n\nPatient CharacteristicsPregnancy Group\n\nn = 40Control Group\n\nn = 40Statistical Group Difference (p-Value) 12 months FU eGFR (mL/min)59.1 ± 21.556.6 ± 23.2n.s.

Long-Term Follow-Up and Allograft Loss\n\nPatient survival in all KTR was 100% during the observed period. The median (IQR) range of follow-up after delivery or the end of pregnancy was 75.5 (49.5, 135.3) months with graft failures in seven women after a median time of 5.6 (3.0, 19) years. The median range of follow-up in the control cohort was 74.5 (43.5, 131.0) months with graft failures in five women after a median time of 13.0 (11, 17.5) years. The difference between graft loss in the PG and CG was not significant, as described by the Kaplan–Meier estimator shown in (p = 0.467). The main causes for allograft loss and the histopathologic results of the allograft biopsy according to the BANFF2017 classification histology scores are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Four out of seven patients in the PG developed DSA compared to 3/5 graft losses in the control group. Interestingly, de novo DSA occurred more than 1.5 years after pregnancy in one patient and in more than seven years in the other three patients. We experienced one very early pregnancy-related graft loss two months after delivery. This woman received her kidney transplant 22 years ago, and her allograft function at the start of pregnancy was marginal (12 mL/min) due to chronic allograft nephropathy with fibrosis (Supplementary Table S1). Pre-existing proteinuria of 500 mg/g creatinine worsened up to 4 g/g creatinine. Two months after delivery, dialysis therapy was initiated due to persistent allograft failure.\n\nOverall, we did not observe more graft loss due to rejection episodes in women with pregnancy compared to the CG.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn this study, we analyzed outcomes in women with post-transplant pregnancies using a single center cohort regarding the mothers’ health and kidney allograft function.\n\nThe main contributors to a worse pregnancy outcome were a negative eGFR slope during the last 12 months before the start of pregnancy, maintenance of triple immunosuppressive therapy during pregnancy, and an impaired functional renal reserve adaptation of the kidney allograft during pregnancy. Hyperfiltration (renal reserve capacity), defined as an eGFR increase during pregnancy of ≥15 mL/min or an eGFR increase of ≥20% from the pre-pregnancy eGFR, correlated significantly with stable allograft function after 24 months of follow-up. Moreover, in addition to the risk for an adverse pregnancy outcome, a negative eGFR slope 12 months before the start of pregnancy was also associated with a worsening allograft function at 24 months follow-up after the end of pregnancy.\n\nThe definition of preeclampsia in women with post-transplant pregnancy is challenging due to a pre-existing impaired allograft function with or without proteinuria and often underlying hypertension with the need of treatment. The incidence of pregnancies with adverse events was high in our cohort (40.9%), compared to 3–7% of regular pregnancies [21,22,23], but the numbers are comparable to other cohorts of women after KTX, with a rate of pregnancies with adverse events between 25% and 40% [3,7,24,25,26]. The change in new criteria for preeclampsia with severe features, also used in our study, adds a more precise definition of risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Beyond the established risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as higher stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), impaired allograft function at the time of pregnancy, uncontrolled hypertension, and pre-existing proteinuria [27,28], and instead of exclusively looking at non-dynamic kidney function parameters, we put our emphasis on dynamic changes in kidney function before and during pregnancy and up to 24 months after the end of pregnancy. Hyperfiltration during pregnancy develops early in gestation and persists until delivery [29,30]. Appropriate systemic vasodilation and the ability for renal hyperfiltration during pregnancy might play an important protective role during gestation [31,32,33,34], and previous or chronic damages to the allograft will likely impair physiologic pregnancy-related adaptions. Interestingly, Wiles et al. demonstrated in 178 women with CKD stages 3–5 that a gestational serum creatinine decrease of <10% compared to pre-pregnancy creatinine was a more significant risk predictor of early delivery and decline in kidney function than a higher CKD stage [35].\n\nWhile many studies reported a worsening allograft function after pregnancy [19,36,37], case-control studies to compare kidney outcome results in pregnant women with non-pregnant women are rare [30,38]. Comparable allograft outcomes were reported in a few case-control studies with non-pregnant KTR [39,40,41], with patients with CKD of similar CKD stage [10], and with a non-transplanted population, mostly healthy, with two kidneys [6,30,42]. Here, we compared our findings in post-transplant pregnancies with a close 1:1 matched-pair group of kidney-transplanted women with no recent pregnancy to exclude confounders and bias. We observed a similar rate of change in eGFR in both post-transplant pregnancies and the control group until the end of pregnancy or observation and during follow-up for up to 24 months. As expected, proteinuria increased during pregnancy while it remained stable in the control group, but at 24 months follow-up, there were no more significant differences between the two groups. This is in line with other reports, where increased proteinuria resolved during long-term follow-up in most of the cases [43]. Gutierrez et al. reported proteinuria at the end of pregnancy in post-transplant women (0.8 ± 1.4 g/d) compared to a control group (0.1 ± 0.1 g/d) which persisted for up to one-year post-delivery but disappeared during the long-term follow up (0.3 ± 0.2 g/d). In contrast, higher proteinuria before or during pregnancy was associated with worse graft survival [44,45], but this could not be demonstrated in other studies [46].\n\nTo analyze risk factors in post-transplant patients with eGFR decrease over time, we did not see pregnancy itself as a risk contributor to worse allograft outcomes. Moreover, while parameters such as organ donor age, time since transplantation, immunosuppressive regimen, co-morbidities, and glomerulonephritis were not different between women with stable and worsening eGFR, we observed that the trajectory of eGFR before pregnancy was a risk predictor of worsening allograft function over time. Although only the eGFR slopes from 12 months before pregnancy until the start of pregnancy or, in the case of the controls, until the start of observation were significant, we assume that a continuous eGFR decline mirrors chronic allograft deterioration for various reasons (e.g., due to CNI toxicity or chronic allograft nephropathy) with the subsequent loss in kidney function in the long-term.\n\nLittle is known about the factors influencing an allograft´s ability to increase renal filtration during pregnancy and the impact of renal hyperfiltration on the pregnancy itself has been discussed controversially [10,47,48]. Park et al. reported a poor pregnancy outcome in 1931 women, of whom 94 had CKD, if eGFR levels during pregnancy remained below or raised above a reference level of 120–150 mL/min per 1.73 m2 [48]. Of these, women with a lower midterm eGFR (60–90 mL/min per 1.73 m2) experienced more frequent adverse pregnancy outcomes than did those with a higher midterm eGFR (90–120 mL/min per 1.73 m2). Remarkably, women after kidney transplantation with single kidneys do rarely reach supranormal eGFR levels, thus deleterious effects of very high eGFR increases are difficult to analyze in this special cohort. In contrast, Garg et al. demonstrated a higher rate of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in women with previous living kidney donation than in matched non-donors with comparable health conditions (incidence, 11% vs. 5%, respectively) [46], which indicates a negative impact of a lower renal filtration reserve on subsequent changes in circulating plasma volume, placental perfusion, and endothelial damage. Bramham et al. did not see a correlation with adverse pregnancy outcomes despite the absence of a fall in creatinine in post-transplant pregnancies [6]. In contrast, Gosselink et al. showed, from a recent large nationwide cohort study with 177 patients, that a midterm percentage serum creatinine dip was significantly smaller in pregnancies with an adverse pregnancy outcome (mean difference of −4.5%) [49]. Our study also demonstrates that hyperfiltration (indicating the capacity to increase eGFR during pregnancy) occurred significantly more often and was more pronounced in the group with stable kidney function and in women without adverse pregnancy events. We assume that the ability for hyperfiltration reflects a reserved vascular and endothelial function of the kidney with the potential for hemodynamic adaptations during pregnancy. The relaxin pathway and the renin–aldosterone–angiotensin system, amongst others, likely contribute to the mechanism of blood flow increase and renal reserve capacity [32,50,51].\n\nKattah et al. reported results from allograft biopsies before and after pregnancy in kidney-transplanted women and observed more globally sclerosed glomeruli and an increase in chronic vascular injury [52]. Kolonko et al. suggested that hyperfiltration might damage allograft function by causing injury to the glomerulus with subsequent glomerulosclerosis [53]. The predictive value of a functional renal reserve in women with post-transplant pregnancies should be validated in larger prospective cohort studies. We suggest that women without adaptions of allograft eGFR during pregnancy need special attention regarding future complications such as worsening kidney function.\n\nThe immunosuppressive regimen in all KTR was dominated by the intake of CNI, MPA, and low-dose CS in both cohorts (the PG and CG). MPA was stopped in the case of a planned pregnancy, and patients were switched to azathioprin (in the case of triple IS) or to steroids in the case of previous dual IS with CNI and MPA. We hypothesized that the intake of CNI and the increased vascular stress of pregnancy might accelerate or aggravate allograft function or placental maturity, but we did not observe relevant differences, neither for the mother or fetal outcome nor for the long-term allograft outcome. Studies regarding the impact of IS on the complications of pregnancy in KTR are sparse. CNI are often the mainstay of immunosuppression in KTR. In general, the intake of CNI and azathioprin is considered to be relatively safe [30], but irrespective of pregnancy, CNI-induced decline in graft function in the long term is well described due to vasoconstriction associated with nephrotoxicity and hypertension [54,55]. Majak et al. reported that the use of cyclosporine in 175 pregnancies correlated significantly more frequently with pre-eclampsia [56]. Koenjer et al. retrospectively investigated the influence of CNI intake during pregnancy in 129 pregnancies with CNI and 125 pregnancies without. They did not find differences in major maternal or fetal outcomes between the two groups [57].\n\nRemarkably, within the PG, we found that maintenance of a triple immunosuppressive regimen as a correlate for more intense immunosuppression posed a risk contributor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, the maintenance of dual immunosuppression during pregnancy might be beneficial, but this has to be validated using larger prospective studies.\n\nFinally, we compared allograft losses after pregnancy with a matched-pair group of post-transplant women without pregnancy during the same observation period. Graft losses occurred late, several years after end of pregnancy or observation. We only experienced one pregnancy-related graft loss shortly after delivery due to severe chronic allograft nephropathy and fibrosis of the allograft. This patient had, already at the start of pregnancy, a severely diminished allograft function without any renal reserve capacity and a continuous decline in eGFR from 24 months before pregnancy onwards. The majority of data derived from kidney transplant recipient cohorts also showed a good outcome and no increased risk of rejection, allograft loss after pregnancy, or impairment in kidney function [6,58]. Another concern is the development of de novo DSA after pregnancy. We did not observe an increased frequency of de novo DSA after delivery in our cohort, which needs to be confirmed using larger studies. Levidiotis et al. demonstrated long-term follow-up data over 40 years of transplant patients with pregnancies that did not worsen fetal and maternal outcomes when compared to transplant patients without pregnancies [59]. This is also in line with several studies that have evaluated the impact of pregnancy on long-term graft function and survival [30].\n\nThe limitation of our study is its retrospective nature with a small single-center cohort of pregnancies. Except for the deterioration in eGFR before pregnancy, we did not find any other predictors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. The strength of this study is the comparison with a matched control cohort with detailed information regarding baseline characteristics, allograft function parameters with the emphasis on dynamic changes, and a detailed long-term mean follow-up time in both cohorts including regular determinations of HLA antibodies [60]. Since common clinical indicators were not helpful for risk prediction, the use of current biomarkers such as sFlt-1 and PlGF and the detection and validation of new biomarkers derived from multiple organ and cellular sources need to be explored in future studies [61]."
