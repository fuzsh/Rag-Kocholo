        "text": "Tag: N1K\n\nHasegawa Kawanishi N1K2-Ja Shiden-Kai 紫電 Violet Lightning “George” of LT Naoshi Kanno in 1/72 Scale\n\nDuring the last year of the Pacific War, the Imperial Japanese Navy formed the 343rd Naval Air Group under Captain Minoru Genda. The intention was to build a unit capable of standing up to American aviation units on equal terms. They were equipped with three squadrons of the outstanding Kawanishi N1K2 Shiden Kai (“George” to the Americans) and a section of Nakajima C6N Saiun (“Myrt”) reconnaissance aircraft. Many of the best surviving fighter pilots in the IJN were assigned to the unit, making it a squadron of aces.\n\nOne of these pilots was LT Naoshi Kanno. Kanno first entered combat in the Philippines in 1944, where he was credited with several F6F Hellcats and survived a ramming attack against a B-24 Liberator. On 01AUG45 one of Kanno’s 20 mm wing cannon exploded during combat over Yakushima, damaging his aircraft. He did not return to base. Kanno was credited with 25 aerial victories.\n\nThis is Hasegawa’s Shiden Kai, first issued way back in 1977. I built this back when it was new and Thorpe was the only real modeling reference available in the U.S. on Japanese aircraft. This mold is very much a product of its time, with a simplified cockpit, scant engine detail, and comically shallow wheelwells. One error which most modelers miss is the cord of the vertical tail is wrong – Hasegawa compromised between the two actual sizes, so the kit’s vertical is either too big or too small depending on which type the modeler wants to depict. Thorpe’s research of Kanno’s markings has also not aged well, the fuselage bands should only be yellow without the white band in between.\n\n2020 Year in Review\n\n“May you live in interesting times.” – ancient Chinese curse\n\nOddly for a method of telling time, the positioning of our new year is arbitrary from a physical perspective and should have no actual bearing on earthly events, but here’s hoping for a better 2021 anyway!\n\nI’ll look for the “win” here even if it is minor: We modelers are fortunate to have an inherently solitary hobby in these times. Overall modeling appears to have picked up, Hornsby (parent company of Airfix) is reporting profits for the first time in years. Modeling podcasts have come into their own and make bench time even more enjoyable.\n\nThe biggest void from a modeling perspective in my opinion is the cancellation of the shows. I usually attend half a dozen per year and they are always a fine day out, with friends, new kits, and getting to see the work of hundreds of fellow modelers. Also missing was the Half Price Books annual clearance sale where literally semi-truck loads of books are sold at ridiculously low prices at the state fairgrounds.\n\nOn a different note, perhaps the most interesting story of the year received very little attention – the U.S. government admitted that it was studying materials retrieved from vehicles of extraterrestrial origin. Another commentary on the year 2020.\n\nBlog Statistics and News\n\n2020 was the second complete year for the Inch High Guy blog. I am happy to report that I again managed to make a post each day, so 366 posts due to the leap year. The blog received 73,992 views and 26,731 visitors, up from 27,174 views and 7,303 visitors last year. The most popular post was “Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress Interior Colors Part I” with 1,857 views, followed by “The B-17E and the Myth of the Bendix Ventral Turret” with 1,116 views. Forts appear to be popular around here!\n\nLink: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2019/09/11/b-17-flying-fortress-interior-colors-part-i/\n\nLink: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2018/11/18/the-b-17e-and-the-myth-of-the-bendix-ventral-turret/\n\nI am still struggling with the counter-intuitive Word Press editor, and that was only made worse with the introduction of the Word Press “Block Editor” in September. This eliminated some useful functions while re-naming and moving others, with no apparent improvements on the user end. On a more positive note, I did finally locate the tagging function and busied myself adding tags to all posts old and new.\n\nI have linked several posts on ScaleMates, where the walk-around posts of museum aircraft have proved to be the most popular. The Women Warriors posts have found a following with wargamers over on The Miniatures Page, among others. I had intended for these pictures to tell their own stories, but there have been a few requests for captions. Easier said than done with the modern-era photos as information ranges from obvious to impossible-to-determine, but there may be hope for the historical pictures.\n\nModels Built in 2020\n\nForty-seven completions, twenty-nine aircraft and eighteen vehicles. In addition I painted fifteen figures (plus one dog) and constructed three diorama bases. Everything was built to 1/72 scale as is my preference. The mosaic has a picture of each build, if you want to see more finished pictures or the construction posts just follow the tags at the bottom of this post or enter the descriptions in the search bar in the upper right column.\n\nHasegawa Kawanishi Kyofu (Rex) x 2\n\nTamiya Kawanishi N1K1 Shiden (George)\n\nAoshima Kawanishi N1K1 Shiden (George)\n\nMPM Kawanishi N1K1 Shiden (George)\n\nHasegawa Kawanishi Shiden Kai (George) x 2\n\nHasegawa Mitsubishi Raiden (Jack)\n\nFujimi Aichi B7A1 Ryusei (Grace)\n\nLS Yokosuka K5Y Akatombo (Willow)\n\nAZ Yokosuka K5Y Akatombo (Willow)\n\nSpecial Hobby Curtiss P-40 Warhawk x 5\n\nTamiya Republic P-47D Thunderbolt\n\nAirfix Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress conversion to B-17E x 2\n\nRPM Hotchkiss H35 French Light Tank\n\nRAF Bomber Supply Set x 2 (6 vehicles)\n\nIBG Chevrolet C15A Personnel Lorry\n\nMonogram Boeing F4B-4 x 2\n\nRare Bits Boeing F4B-1 Conversion\n\nMonogram Curtiss F11C-2 Goshawk\n\nMatchbox Boeing P-12E x 2\n\nCzech Master Resin Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk\n\nPlastic Soldier StuG III Ausf.

The computer renders look good and show areas such as the wing leading edge and wheel well openings which have given other manufacturers problems appear to have been rendered properly. Here’s hoping! Every previous B/C in 1/72 scale has had some major shape issue so an accurate new tool kit has been at the top of many modeler’s wish lists for many years now. The early Mustangs, if done well, are sure to be a hit and a license to print money for Arma so here’s wishing for a successful release!\n\nIn more local news Ms. Inch High put a Creality LD-002R 3-D resin printer under the Christmas tree this year. These are very useful if you know what you’re doing, which I don’t at this point. Hopefully I will soon though, and I look forward to printing something useful. It is an amazing technology to have sitting on the bench. For all the talk of “Death of the Hobby” in some circles, I have yet to see any hint of it from here.\n\nI have enjoyed putting this together, and have enjoyed hearing from other modelers and discovering other blogs. A big thank you to all who have visited here, commented, followed, and especially those who have posted links.\n\nMay you all live long enough to build every model in your stash!\n\n1/72 Scale N1K Kyofu / Shiden Batch Build Part VII\n\nFinished! This turned into a “just one more thing” build and seemed to drag on, but the first seven completions for 2020 are done and I’m generally happy with how they turned out. The big pictures on the computer highlighted a few tweaks and touch ups which are needed but they’re mostly complete. Here’s the list of modifications and details added, some kits required more of these than others:\n\nCockpits replaced and/or detailed.\n\nInstrument panels, side consoles, and seatbelts printed on photographic paper.\n\nEngines replaced and/or wired.\n\nWheelwells removed, deepened, and detailed.\n\nLanding gear covers replaced with card stock.\n\nLanding lights made from CD case plastic.\n\nGear down indicators made from bronze rod.\n\nVacuform or plunge molded canopies.\n\nPitot tubes made with metal tube and insect pins.\n\nBeading wire brake lines.\n\nWheels replaced.\n\nTurned brass cannon barrels from Master.\n\nVarious openings and trestle ports drilled out.\n\nTrim tab actuators replaced with wire.\n\nRadio aerials made from Uschi elastic line.\n\nSo, overall a fun build but one which took longer than anticipated. I think the next batch will be something a little more current, hopefully one which doesn’t need as many modifications!\n\nCompleted N1K models here: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2020/04/02/hasegawa-kawanishi-n1k-kyofu-%e5%bc%b7%e9%a2%a8-strong-wind-rex-prototype-in-1-72-scale/\n\n1/72 Scale N1K Kyofu / Shiden Batch Build Part VI\n\nPart VII here: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2020/01/24/1-72-scale-n1k-kyofu-shiden-batch-build-part-vii/\n\n1/72 Scale N1K Kyofu / Shiden Batch Build Part V\n\nPart VI here: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2020/01/17/1-72-scale-n1k-kyofu-shiden-batch-build-part-vi/\n\n1/72 Scale N1K Kyofu / Shiden Batch Build Part IV\n\nPart V here: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2020/01/10/1-72-scale-n1k-kyofu-shiden-batch-build-part-v/\n\n1/72 Scale N1K Kyofu / Shiden Batch Build Part III\n\nPart IV here: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2020/01/03/1-72-scale-n1k-kyofu-shiden-batch-build-part-iv/\n\n1/72 Scale N1K Kyofu / Shiden Batch Build Part II\n\nPart III here: https://inchhighguy.wordpress.com/2019/12/27/1-72-scale-n1k-kyofu-shiden-batch-build-part-iii/\n\nKawanishi N1K Kyōfū / Shiden Design Evolution\n\nGenda’s Blade Book Review\n\nGenda’s Blade: Japan’s Squadron of Aces: 343 Kokutai\n\nBy Henry Saikaida and Koji Takaki\n\nHardcover in dustjacket, 208 pages, illustrated, ten color profiles by Tom Tullis\n\nPublished by Classic Publications May 2003\n\nLanguage: English\n\nISBN-10: 1903223253\n\nISBN-13: 978-1903223253\n\nDimensions: 9 x 0.8 x 12 inches\n\nDuring the last year of the Pacific War, the Imperial Japanese Navy formed the 343rd Naval Air Group under Captain Minoru Genda. The intention was to build a unit capable of standing up to American aviation units on equal terms. The unit fought in tactical formations built upon two- and four-plane sections, abandoning the three-plane formations long favored in the IJN. They were equipped with three squadrons of the outstanding Kawanishi N1K2 Shiden Kai (“George” to the Americans) and a section of Nakajima C6N Saiun (“Myrt”) reconnaissance aircraft. Many of the best surviving fighter pilots in the IJN were assigned to the unit, making it a squadron of aces.\n\nIt is rare to find accounts of air combat in the Pacific from the Japanese perspective, but this book goes into specifics of each encounter the 343rd had and their outcomes. The authors make extensive use of records and first-hand accounts for both sides, and sift through the conflicting claims to establish the actual results of each engagement. It is apparent that the pilots of the 343rd were comparable to their American counterparts. They went up against Corsairs, Hellcats, Mustangs, and Thunderbolts, as well as several patrol and bomber types. While the 343 Kōkūtai generally gave as good as they got, they were eventually ground down by constant combat and losses they could not replace.\n\nThis is a unique book, and a very interesting read for students of Japanese aviation in the Pacific War. There is plenty there for the modeler as well, with ten excellent Tom Tullis color profiles and ample photographs throughout. There is also a short but excellent appendix which gives specifics on the colors and markings carried by the Shiden Kais of the 343 Kōkūtai. This is becoming a collector’s book, so pick up a copy if you can find it!"
