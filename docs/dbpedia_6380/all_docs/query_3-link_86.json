        "text": "Berlin Now” is the name of a festival of drama, cinema, art, music and literature which began in New York City yesterday and goes on through April 19. As its title indicates, it is primarily concerned with what has happened in Berlin during the last 10 years or so. “Berlin Then” would be a great subject for a festival, but it is not the subject of this one.\n\nNot that the past is entirely neglected. From April 12 through 30 there will be a show of 19th‐century architectural drawings of Berlin at the CooperHewitt Museum which I, for one, would batter down the doors to see. On March 26 at 8 P.M. at Goethe House, 1014 Fifth Avenue, Hans Lietzau and Marianne Hoppe will read from the work of Theodor Fontane, the novelist and apothecary who is our best guide to 19th‐century Berlin. Throughout the run of the festival there will be opportunities of seeing, both at Goethe House and at the Goethe Institute, 42 Washington Mews, a whole slew of classic movies from the late 1920's and early 1930's.\n\nIn the context of the historical life of Berlin, samples such as these are no more than colored threads pulled out of whole cloth. In architectural terms, Berlin, for instance, was once one of the most elegant cities in Europe. Johann Georg Rosenberg's copperplate engravings of the 1780's show us street after unsullied street. What Karl Friedrich Schinkel built some 50 years later set a standard of crystalline distinction which was still alive in 1900 when Alfred Messel built a department store for the Wertheims that could almost have been a cathedral.\n\n•\n\nFontane was a very good novelist and an indispensable witness, not only to Berlin itself but to the countryside for many miles around. But if we touch at all on the human richness of 19thcentury Berlin we soon have a team that has Bismarck as its statesman, Hegel and Fichte as its philosopher, Mommsen and Ranke as its historians, Lepsius as its pioneer Egyptologist, E.T.A. Hoffmann as its storyteller, Menzel as its painter and draftsman and Heinrich Zille as its cartoonist and pioneer photographer. There would be no end to it; but I hope that that will not deter someone from making a beginning of it in museological terms.\n\nThe problem with Berlin today is that people incline to write it off as necessarily second‐rate, And certainly it is no good pretending that Berlin in 1977 is what it was 50 years ago: a capital city in which Albert Einstein could be reached on the telephone. Max Reinhardt and Erwin Piscator directed plays, Arnold Schoenberg taught composition, Mies van der Rohe built houses in a working‐class district, Erich Kleiber and Otto Klemperer conducted new music, Artur Schnabel taught the piano and Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht were on hand to give a new dimension to the musical. The Berlin in question was part of a continuum of energy which had been in being ever since Shakespeare sent his Hamlet to study at Wittenberg, just 60 miles Berlin.\n\nBerlin for generations was not only the capital of a united Germany. It was the liveliest, the most pungent, the most inventive and the most insubordinate city east of the Rhine. But very soon there came a cut‐off point. Disgrace and dereliction were everywhere. And for the part 30 years Berlin has been for many foreign observers a paper asset; something to be kept in being because it would be humiliating to see it struck off the map, but not a city from which anything of consequence can be expected.\n\n“Berlin Now” is intended to show that, at any rate in cultural terms, this is nonsense. And in certain areas it starts from strength. It is, for instance, common ground among students of the European theater that the plays directed by Peter Stein at the Berlin Schaubilhne are as remarkable in their way as anything that has been done in Europe since World War H. He and his company could not be brought to New York but at 7:30 P.M. tomorrow and on March 21 and 28 a filmed version of his production of Maxim Gorky's “Summerfolk” will be shown at the Museum of the Performing Arts in Lincoln Center. Not long ago, Samuel Beckett went to Berlin to direct his “Waiting for Godot” at the Schiller Theater; this production can be seen at the Roundabout Theater, 333 West 23d Street, from March 29 through April 3. And although the muse of cabaret is notoriously fickle, hopes are high for “Haus Vaterland” which members of the Schiller Theater will perform at the La Mama Theater, 74 East 4th Street from April 6 through April 10.\n\n‘Berlin has been energetic ever since Shakespeare sent his Hamlet to study at Wittenberg.’\n\nThe role of art in Berlin was never quite as secure as the role of music and theater, but it is a role to which much thought has been given in recent years. The new National Gallery by Mies van der Rohe is one of his most beautiful buildings. The new Academy of Arts by Werner Düttmann is an elegant and versatile construction. Every possible inducement has been offered to foreign artists of no matter what stature who want to come and work in Berlin. Quite a few galleries somehow keep going. But it's no good pretending that new art is integral to the life of Berlin. It cannot be without significance that, of the two one‐person shows which mark the festival, one is by Hannah Höch, the very distinguished collagist who was born way back in the nineteenth century, while the other is of etchings by Günter Grass who is better known as a novelist. (Miss Höch's collages are at Goethe House from March 18 through April 19 and Mr. Grass's etchings at the Weyhe Gallery, 794 Lexington Avenueat 61st Street from April 15 through May 6.)\n\nAll the more reason, perhaps, to welcome the group shows of younger artists from Berlin which will be held in SoHo during the festival. These include “Abstraction, Conception, Performance” at the Denise Rene Gallery, 484 Broome Street; “Realistic Tendencies” at the New School Art Center, 65 Fifth Avenue; “Video Art” at The Kitchen, 59 Wooster Street; films in English by Rebecca Horn at Anthology Film Archives, 80 Wooster Street, and recent photographs of Berlin life by Henry Ries at the downtown Goethe Institute. Further enlightenment is promised by a panel discussion on modern art in Germany at the New School Art Center at 4 P.M. on April 15. Barbara Rose and others will meet on this occasion with representative German spokesmen, among them Petra Kipphoff of “Die Zeit.”\n\n•\n\nMuch more could be said of “Berlin Now.” I doubt, for instance, if finer executants than the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Octet will ever be heard within the frontiers of SoHo: there is much to look forward to, therefore, in their concert of recent works by Stockhausen and others at 8:30 P.M. on April 13 in The Kitchen. Virgil Thomson is such a master of language, written or spoken, that the concert of works by the late Boris Blocher (Goethe House, March 15) would be worth going to for his introduction alone; and on March 23 and 24 there will be two concerts at The Kitchen of music written in Berlin by composers from all over who have accepted the city's hospitality.\n\nA last line or two for the 15 percent feature films which deal in one way or another with Berlin life, the readings from their own works by Günter Grass (New School for Social. Research, 65 Fifth Ave., 8 P.M., April 14) and Uwe Johnson (Goethe House, 8 P.M. on April 12) and the lectures and discussions on architectural subjects which fill the week beginning April 11. German festivals are like German meals in that they rarely give short weight; and if I single out Uwe Johnson's reading, it is for two reasons. First, it will be in English. Second, no writer now living has dealt more discerningly with a very important subject that forms no part of “Berlin Now” but cannot be avoided forever: the difference, that is to say, between West Berlin and the Berlin that lies on the other side or the wall. ■"
