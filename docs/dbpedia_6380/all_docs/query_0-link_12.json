He is credited with 137 aerial victories—that is, 137 aerial combat encounters resulting in the destruction of the enemy aircraft. This ties him for 43rd place among highest scoring fighter aces. He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German language: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.\n\nAfter the war he became a successful aerobatics pilot, winning the German Championship in 1962 and taking second place in 1961, 1963, 1964 and 1966.[1]\n\nAwards[]\n\nWound Badge\n\nFront Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe for Fighter Pilots in Gold (22 July 1943)\n\nIron Cross (1939)\n\n2nd Class (28 July 1943)\n\n1st Class (22 September 1943)\n\nEhrenpokal der Luftwaffe (20 April 1944)[2]\n\nGerman Cross in Gold on 18 May 1944 as Leutnant in the 5./JG 52[3]\n\nKnight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 27 Jul 1944 as Leutnant and pilot in the 5./JG 52[4][Note 1]\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n[]"
