Brunner Memorial Prize, New York, NY, 1979.\n\nRelocation\n\nMoore led a peripatetic existence, his places of residence spanning the United States, as the architect moved from university to university. His parents, Charles E. Moore and his wife Kathryn Almendinger, also made large-scale moves during their lives, shuttling between Lower MI and CA. Charles E. Moore's World War I draft registration card indicated that he lived in Benton Harbor, MI, in 09/1918. By 1920, however, five years before Charles Willard's birth, Charles E. and Kathryn lived with his parents Ephraim William Moore (born 04/30/1854 in Rochester, NY) and Lillian Estelle Willard (born 09/28/1853 in Battle Creek, MI), in a rented house at 1149 North Michigan Avenue in Pasadena, CA. (See Ancestry.com, Source Citation Year: 1920; Census Place: Pasadena, Los Angeles, California; Roll: T625_117; Page: 15B; Enumeration District: 523, accessed 09/18/2023.)\n\nThe son of NY-born banker, Ephraim Moore married Lillian Willard on 05/02/1877. Lillian's father was an influential man in Battle Creek, MI. Rev. George Willard (born 03/20/1824 in Bolton, VT-d. 03/26/1901 in Battle Creek, MI) was a Protestant Episcopal cleric between 1848 and 1862. He got into politics as a MI state legislator (c. 1866-1872) and a US Representative for two terms between 1872 and 1876. He became a newspaper editor for the Battle Creek Journal, that began publication in 1854. (See Joseph Willard and Charles Wilkes Walker, Willard Genealogy, [Boston, MA: WIlard Family Association, 1915], p. 415.)\n\nEphraim Moore began his working life as a merchant in Victor, NY, in 1880, although he made the switch to journalism later, likely with the help of his father in law. (See Ancestry.com, Source Citation Year: 1880; Census Place: Victor, Ontario, New York; Roll: 909; Page: 487A; Enumeration District: 138, accessed 09/18/2023.) He worked as a newspaperman in Battle Creek, MI, in 1900, possibly for the Journal. (See Ancestry.com, Source Citation Year: 1900; Census Place: Battle Creek Ward 4, Calhoun, Michigan; Roll: 704; Page: 5; Enumeration District: 0035, accessed 09/18/2023.) Ephraim relocated to Benton Harbor, MI, by 1910, where he was the Editor of the city's newspaper, the News-Palladium,that operated between 1904 and 1975 under this unusual name.He and Lillian had four children, only one of whom, Charles E. Moore, remained alive in 1910. (See Ancestry.com, Source Citation Year: 1910; Census Place: Benton Harbor Ward 2, Berrien, Michigan; Roll: T624_638; Page: 8a; Enumeration District: 0061; FHL microfilm: 1374651, accessed 09/18/2023.)\n\nAlthough not born in CA, Charles Willard Moore would reside in several cities in the state during his lifetime, suggesting that it held strong appeal for him.\n\nHe was born in Benton Harbor, MI, but lived in Battle Creek, MI, during his high school years. In 1940, his family had a residence off of Capital Avenue, SW (box #70), in Battle Creek, MI., likely on Hiawatha Drive. The Moore house was likely worth about $10,000 in 1940, well above most houses in the area, and had a prime view of Goguac Lake to the west. The architect grew up in a relatively prosperous neighborhood on Hiawatha Drive, that included three physicians and several small business owners who owned their own single-family dwellings. A few families, including that of a barber and a steam fitter, rented their houses in the immediate vicinity. (See Ancestry.com, Source Citation Year: 1940; Census Place: Battle Creek, Calhoun, Michigan; Roll: m-t0627-01736; Page: 26B; Enumeration District: 13-43B, accessed 09/18/2023.)\n\nMoore attended the University of Michigan (UM) in Ann Arbor, MI, from about 1943 until 1947. On 11/01/1943, Charles Moore listed his permanent address as Hiawatha Drive, Goguac Lake, MI. His campus address was 1617 Washtenaw Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI. (See Ancestry.com, Source Citation National Archives at St. Louis; St. Louis, Missouri; Wwii Draft Registration Cards For Michigan, 10/16/1940-03/31/1947; Record Group: Records of the Selective Service System, 147; Box: 831, accessed 09/18/2023.)\n\nHis first teaching assignment occurred at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City between 1950 and 1952. He then did military service in the US Army Reserves, where he served in the Corps of Engineers during the Korean War.\n\nHe moved to Princeton, NJ, to attend Princeton University in 1956-1957 and increased his amount of travel thereafter. While he was working at Princeton, he designed at least three houses in Monterey, CA, necessitating at least some trips back to the West Coast. He maintained an office Pebble Beach, CA, working there for about three years, 1959 until 1962, and likely lived somewhere on the Monterey Peninsula at the time. He also commuted to Berkeley to teach at the University of California during the period between 1959 and 1965.\n\nThe architect took on the assignment as Chair of the School of Architecture at Yale University in 1965, where he followed the tumultuous tenure of Paul Rudolph\n\nDuring his time teaching at Berkeley, Moore designed his timeless House in Orinda, that became one of the best-known, small residences of the 1960s in the US.\n\nMoore was buried at the Monterey City Cemetery, Monterey, CA. He was buried in the same plot as his mother, Kathryn Almendinger Moore.\n\nParents\n\nHis mother was Kathryn Almendinger Moore (born 1892 in MI-d. 1958), who was eleven years younger than her husband. After her husband's death in 1942, Kathryn returned to Los Angeles, CA, in 1950, living on her own in one unit of a four-plex apartment building at 4210 Los Feliz Boulevard. (See Ancestry.com, Source Citation National Archives at Washington, DC; Washington, D.C.; Seventeenth Census of the United States, 1950; Year: 1950; Census Place: Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California; Roll: 1562; Page: 13; Enumeration District: 66-369, accessed 09/18/2023.)\n\nCharles Ephraim Moore (born 11/12/1881 in NY -d. 1942), worked in multiple jobs during his adult years. In 09/1918, he worked for his father as an assistant manager for the News-Palladium in Benton Harbor, MI. In 1920, the US Census record that Charles E. worked as car salesman in Southern CA. By 1940, he made his living as a realtor. in Battle Creek, MI. Charle E. Moore was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Battle Creek, MI. He died while Charles W. Moore was still in high school.\n\nBoth of Moore's parents completed college, according to the 1940 US Census, a relatively unusual circumstance at the time.\n\nHe had a younger sister, Marianne E. Moore (born c. 1927 in MI).\n\nBiographical Notes\n\nMoore's World War II draft registration card listed him as being Caucasian, with a light complexion, brown eyes and blonde hair. He stood 6-foot, 3-inches tall and weighed a modest 145 pounds.
