Walter Wolfrum (23 May 1923, Schmölz, Küps, Germany – 26 August 2010, Schwabach) was a German World War II fighter ace who served in the Luftwaffe from February 1943 until the end of the war. He is credited with 137 aerial victories—that is, 137 aerial combat encounters resulting in the destruction of the enemy aircraft. This ties him for 43rd place among highest scoring fighter aces. He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German language: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.

After the war he became a successful aerobatics pilot, winning the German Championship in 1962 and taking second place in 1961, 1963, 1964 and 1966.[1]
