Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) was a French philosopher. He became associated with the philosophy of ‘existentialism’ (alongside his lifelong friend and lover Simone de Beauvoir), though he never embraced that label. More than a philosopher, Sartre saw himself as a writer, writing novels, plays, biographies and even song lyrics. His great work, Being and Nothingness, while challenging, is notable for its novelistic touches.
