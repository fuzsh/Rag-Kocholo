        "text": "''I don't consider myself a philosopher,'' Simone de Beauvoir wrote in the second volume of her autobiography. For decades, most philosophers have agreed with her.\n\nFor them, the French novelist and intellectual who wrote ''The Second Sex,'' creating modern feminism in a single, electrifying stroke, was Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophical sidekick, a Dr. Watson to his Sherlock Holmes. She may have promoted and applied his French brand of existentialism, but she was not, they argued, a philosopher in her own right.\n\nBut now, fueled by the discovery of previously unpublished diaries and correspondence, a growing group of philosophers and Beauvoir scholars declare that she deserves the rarefied title of philosopher herself. Some even argue that she was the prime influence on Sartre. In the process, they are helping to reverse the slide Beauvoir's reputation took a decade ago after some of the less-than-noble details of her relationship with Sartre were published.\n\n''I always thought that Beauvoir was original in her thinking,'' said Margaret Simons, a philosophy professor and the director of women's studies at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, who will publish some of these new findings in ''Beauvoir and 'The Second Sex': Feminism, Race and the Origins of Existentialism'' next year. Beauvoir's contemporaries thought the same thing. An eminent philosopher who sat on both Sartre's and Beauvoir's university examination committees recalled that ''everybody agreed that, of the two, she was the real philosopher,'' according to Deirdre Bair's 1990 biography.\n\nOddly enough, no one would more vehemently disagree with the claim that Beauvoir was a full-blown philosopher than Beauvoir herself. Slamming her fist on a table for emphasis and flashing her cornflower-blue eyes, she repeatedly swore that she was Sartre's pupil. Until the end of her life, in 1986, Beauvoir insisted that ''Philosophically I only had the role of a disciple.''\n\nThat unflinching subordination turned their 50-year partnership into one of the most fascinating and frustrating pairings of the 20th century. As Ms. Bair describes it, the godmother of modern feminism would drop whatever she was doing to chauffeur, make love to, find lovers for, nurse, edit, sit with, read to and travel with Sartre. In 1940, Beauvoir put aside her own novel ''without the slightest pang,'' because, she wrote, ''his theory was worth so much more than any novel I could have written then.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
