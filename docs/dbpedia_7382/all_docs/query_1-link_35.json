        "text": "Evolution of a Philosophy\n\nIt has been stated existentialism is uniquely suited\n\nto the twentieth century, as if somehow mankind reached a new level of\n\ncynicism during the previous century. After all, that is how most view\n\nexistentialism: a philosophy without hope, without faith. The reality is\n\nmore complex. Existentialism evolved as a school of philosophy, borrowing\n\nfrom others, while never completely rejecting past ideals.\n\nThe idea of writing the history of philosophy with a systematic, argumentative\n\nintent has been a very common way of proceeding in the Continental tradition\n\nsince Hegel’s 1807 masterpiece, Phenomenology\n\nof Spirit, which unifies both approaches. One can also find the same approach employed in more contemporary work, such as Jürgen Habermas’s Knowledge and Human Interests (1968), Foucault’s Madness and Civilization (1961), and Derrida’s Of Grammatology (1967). It is much less common in the Anglo-American tradition.\n\n— Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction; Critchley, p. 32\n\nAs with most “modern” philosophies, any student of existentialism\n\nmust begin with Immanuel Kant, the father of German Idealism. Kant’s works gave rise to Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, and Georg\n\nW. F. Hegel. These three successors of Kant — Fichte, Shelling, and Hegel — each attempted to defend faith as logical. These men were influenced by the rise of scientific pursuits and found it necessary to make sense of faith in a Creator. Hegel became the symbol of this philosophical quest to make religious faith reasonable.\n\nSøren Kierkegaard rose to prominence by attacking Hegel, or at least the tradition of defending religious faith as logical. Kierkegaard insisted faith was not logical — and the lack of reason was acceptable. It cannot be “faith” if one tries to establish a logical foundation for religion, according to Kierkegaard. He then went on to define the essence of existentialism: humans suffer a deep anxiety because they cannot be certain of anything, of any meaning. The concepts of anxiety and alienation meld neatly with the writings of Friedrich\n\nNietzsche.\n\nNietzsche represents what has been called “radical free will” — not only is there no logic to existence, but the truly strong person rises and masters the absurdity of life. For many students, and much of the public, Nietzsche’s words define not only existentialism but also nihilism. Yet Nietzsche does not represent existentialism as it was later defined by Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nSartre’s existentialism drew from Martin\n\nHeidegger, who in turn based much of his work upon those of his mentor, Edmund Husserl, the father of phenomenology. As existentialism was formalized by Sartre, one finds the logic of phenomenology with some Hegelian overtones merged with the radical individualism found in Nietzsche. Existentialism is a paradox, as Sartre came to describe it: an attempt to live logically in a universe that is ultimately absurd. Though “existential” scholars often deny it, without Hegel or the rush to science during the nineteenth century, Sartre’s existentialism would not exist.\n\nHow much should Existentialism be regarded and perhaps judged as a social\n\nmovement? It is unusual for a philosophy to attract so directly a following\n\nfor its ideas from people who would perhaps otherwise have no interest\n\nin philosophy. The typical image of an Existentialist as clad all in\n\nblack, drinking coffee and smoking on the Paris Left bank has endured,\n\nthough by all accounts the emergence of the stereotypical Existential\n\nfigure was something of a surprise to de Beauvoir and other Existentialists\n\nof the time (MacDonald, 2000: 5). From 1945 to the 1960s was its heyday,\n\nas popular versions of it chimed perfectly with increasing individualism\n\nand the concomitant anti-establishment attitudes of those decades, particularly\n\nwith the counter-culture movements of the Beats in the 1950s and the\n\nhippy movement of the 1960s, once it had moved outside mainland Europe.\n\n— Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Steven Earnshaw, pp. 8-9\n\nHistory and Tradition\n\nHusserl and Heidegger both called on their readers to remember history and tradition. However, this was not meant to be empty nostalgia for European history. Instead, this was a call to critically examine and reflect upon the history of Europe. The evaluation of history and cultural traditions should be a confrontation with our histories, potentially (and likely) an uncomfortable experience. We should see the flaws of our philosophical, political, and cultural histories. This recall is not a conservative effort to preserve history, but a radical effort to reform the present and future.\n\n… a critical conception of tradition is what Heidegger calls the Destruktion (de-structuring) or Abbau (dismantling) of the history of metaphysics, words that the young Derrida sought to render into French as deconstruction…\n\nTradition can be said to have two senses.\n\nAs something inherited or handed down without questioning or critical\n\ninterrogation.\n\nAs something made or produced through a critical engagement with\n\nthe first sense of tradition, as an appeal to tradition that is in\n\nno way traditional, a radical tradition.\n\nIt is this second sense of tradition that is shared… by Husserl and Heidegger. For the later Husserl of the posthumously published\n\nCrisis\n\nof the European Sciences\n\n(1954), the two senses of tradition correspond to the distinction between a\n\nsedimented\n\nand a\n\nreactivated\n\nexperience of tradition. […] For Husserl, sedimentation consists in the forgetfulness of the origin of a state of affairs.\n\n—\n\nContinental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction\n\n; Critchley, p. 69\n\nWe must not romanticize history or tradition. Instead,\n\nwe should recall history precisely, especially the worst aspects of our\n\nhistories. This applies to science, philosophy, and geopolitical histories.\n\nNo “memory” of history should be trusted, no account assumed to be reliable.\n\nHistory is a creation, an interpretation of events that must be incomplete\n\nand inaccurate because it is a human creation.\n\nWorld History (Political)\n\nCulturally, there are two major groups of existentialists:\n\nthe German-Danish and French-Anglo. In addition, the Jewish and Russian\n\ncultures have contributed to the philosophy. Many would argue Russian history\n\nmight be as existential as any work of fiction. The German and French nations\n\nhave experienced brutal wars (often against each other), plagues, and other\n\nsources of misery. The philosophical movement now known as existentialism\n\ncan be traced from 1789 through 1986, when Simone de Beauvoir died. After experiencing numerous civil disturbances, localized wars, and two world-wide wars, some people in Europe were bound to conclude that life is inherently miserable and irrational. If war is not absurd, nothing is.\n\nIndustrial Revolution\n\nThe Industrial Revolution altered society in ways we\n\nare still attempting to address. From automation to urbanization, the Industrial\n\nRevolution altered how we live our lives. It brought us into larger and\n\nlarger cities, removing us from small, tight-knit communities with deep\n\nfamilial roots. The pace of change, socially and technologically, proved\n\ndifficult for humanity. We still are adapting, while advancements continue\n\nto risk leaving us more alienated from our physical communities.\n\nFor Nietzsche, writing In the second half of the nineteenth century,\n\nthe human race had become decadent and weak. The descent of Western civilization\n\ninto decadence was a common sentiment in that period, and his writings\n\nproposed how a ‘will to power’ could prove a counter to this negative\n\nattitude. […]\n\nFor some commentators these views might be explained historically as\n\nreactions to industrialization, the ever-growing atomization of society\n\ninto little more than unthinking work-units.\n\n— Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 20\n\nThe Industrial Revolution’s first stage (1760–1830) ended\n\nat a time of social upheaval in Europe. Germany was about to unite under\n\nunder Otto von Bismark, through a series of orchestrated conflicts. Hegel\n\ndied in 1831, but his works were influential throughout the second movement\n\nof the Industrial Revolution, which lasted until approximately 1905.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Queen Victoria’s reign (1837–1901)\n\nmarked the second half of the Industrial Revolution, when automation and\n\ntechnology in general captured the public imagination.\n\nGreat and Terrible Wars\n\nAfter two world wars, major conflicts in Asia, and uprising\n\nthroughout the Middle East and Africa, a generational embrace of a philosophy\n\nassociated with absurdity might be viewed as inevitable. The psychological\n\naffect of turmoil in Europe shaped Continental philosophy in general, and\n\nexistentialism in particular.\n\nNor should we forget that after the First World War and again after\n\nthe Second World War, the question of what could possibly constitute\n\nthe human race after these catastrophic events was very much to the fore,\n\nand so the Existentialism of Sartre and Camus, and the thinking of Heidegger,\n\ncan sometimes be seen as responses to these major events.\n\n— Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 20\n\nFor Sartre, the experience of World War II was transformational.\n\nThis is not to suggest that everyone in Europe was not affected by the\n\nwar; surely everyone was affected and many survivors were permanently\n\ntraumatized. Sartre reevaluated his previous statements on philosophy and\n\nliterature. After the war, he publicly moved towards Marxism and socialism\n\nand away from existentialism. He viewed political activism as a duty after\n\nthe war.\n\nThe experience of the Second World War had given Sartre\n\na sense of social responsibility that, arguably, was lacking or at\n\nleast ill developed in his masterpiece, Being and Nothingness (1943). In fact, the existentialists had generally been criticized for their excessive individualism and apparent lack of social conscience.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Thomas R. Flynn, p. 13\n\nThe Korean and Vietnam conflicts followed World War II.\n\nThe absurdity merely continued, despite the obvious horrors of war. There\n\nwas little new to express about the recklessness of humanity. If anything,\n\nwe seemed destined to repeat our mistakes until our eventual demise.\n\nThough some suggest that there are modern existential\n\nphilosophers, they clearly are not prominent figures. In my research, by\n\nno means exhaustive since I am one person, I do not know of any major advancements\n\nto the school since the 1980s, and that is being generous. Scholars suggest\n\nexistentialism’s greatest works and lectures were completed by the mid-1940s\n\nand everything else is a response to or promotion of those works.\n\n… [W]hat are now considered the major texts had all been published\n\nby 1943 with Sartre’s Being and Nothingness, or by 1946 if his Existentialism and Humanism is included.\n\n— Existentialism: A Guide for the Perplexed; Earnshaw, p. 9.\n\nAs I have written in the general\n\nintroduction, most scholars of philosophy and literature consider existentialism to have been a product of historical events. Though the existentialists sought to find universal “truths” in their experiences (Cooper, p. 13), they are forever associated with the tumult of European upheavals, two world wars, and major geopolitical shifts. Even the scholars resistant to the impulse to cordon off existentialsm admit it is perceived as a symbol of a certain period.\n\nThe existentialists’ urge for contemporary relevance fired their social\n\nand political commitment. But it also linked them with the problems of\n\ntheir day and invited subsequent generations to view them as having the\n\ncurrency of yesterday’s news.\n\n— Existentialism: A Very Short Introduction; Flynn, preface (p. i)\n\nToday, several individuals are exploring existential\n\npsychoanalysis and existential fiction, but they are lacking major influence\n\nupon philosophy in general. Though the world is not at peace, existentialism\n\nis no longer viewed as offering one of the better explanations for the\n\nabsurdity of human events. Philosophy has continued to advance, as the\n\nContinental tradition suggests it must.\n\nExistential Timeline\n\nThis timeline is primarily European, as Europe is the\n\nbirthplace of Continental philosophy and existentialism.\n\nHistorical Events Shaping Existentialism 1770 August 27 G.

Browsing a good history book, it becomes\n\nclear that Germany has been attacked and has attacked… repeatedly. The\n\nGerman culture is shaped by war, from Germanic tribal feuds through the\n\nCold War. However, it is the period from 1871 through World War II that\n\nshaped most existential thought.\n\nThe timeline represents only a fraction of the events\n\nwithin the borders we now know as Germany. The individual most responsible\n\nfor the rise and fall of Germany during the period outlined is Otto von\n\nBismarck. In order to control Germany from 1862 through 1890, he found\n\nenemies first in other nations. Then, once he believed Germany had a reasonable\n\namount of territory, he found liberals and socialists to persecute. To\n\nmany cynics, it seemed as if Bismarck had no real political ideals, other\n\nthan the illusion that he alone should rule Germany.\n\nAs you might observe in the timeline, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard experienced the rise of a great German culture. Bismarck did bring amazing prosperity to Germany via both war and solid trade policies, which penalized imports in a world market that wanted German goods. Nietzsche’s idea of the superman, a man operating in life with a pure desire for power and excellence, was shaped by Bismarck’s Germany. Hitler would later pervert the philosophical debating point into a belief system.\n\nFrance\n\nWorld War II is the defining event in the history of\n\nFrench existentialism. Before the second war, the French had prided their\n\ncountry as one of the world powers. With expansive colonies, a rich history,\n\nand a victorious end to World War I, the French dared to consider their\n\ncountry safe and secure.\n\nA summary of French-German history is as follows: France\n\ninvades Germany, Germany fights back, Germany attacks out of anger, the\n\nFrench public demands a tougher stance…. And this cycle continues for several\n\nhundred years. World War I was as much about Napoleon I as it was about\n\nAustria and Serbia.\n\nWhen World War I ended, the French public demanded that\n\nGermany be punished severely. What the French governments and people did\n\nnot comprehend was that they would be responsible for the instability in\n\nGermany that produced Adolf Hitler’s rise to power. In effect, the French\n\ndemands in the Treaty of Versailles placed an unreasonable stress upon\n\nthe German economy and newly-formed democracy. French hubris once again\n\nresulted in German rage.\n\nGerman expenditures during World War I were ultimately\n\nresponsible for a weak economy, but the French and allied demands affected\n\nGerman national pride as much as the economy. Germany’s instability was\n\nlike that throughout European nations — workers were demanding more influence\n\nin German, and would later do so in France.\n\nFrench existentialism was shaped by the experiences and\n\nemotions of the French Resistance. Jean- Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice\n\nMerleau-Ponty, and others were already socialists. Sartre, however, was not as politically active as other students and teachers he knew. Sartre’s years as a student were not spent as an activist, by French standards. Camus was much more political and passionate than Sartre. In part, this might be due to their differing family backgrounds. The war temporarily made members of the French Resistance equal.\n\nThe war further aligned the famous French Existentialists\n\nwith the Soviet Communist Party. While the Soviet Union was eventually\n\nseen as The Evil Empire in the United States, the French public never embraced the idea. The Russian army had held the German army in place; any enemy of Germany could not be all bad.\n\nCurrent Thought\n\nThe word “existential” is now applied to postmodern philosophy\n\nand social theory. Most people now assume existentialism has been replaced\n\nby various social and critical theories, most of those with the name of\n\nMarx attached. Jean-Paul Sartre suggested Marxism was the logical successor to existentialism — an attempt to reclaim the individual from capitalistic hegemony.\n\nSome scholars suggest existentialism is historical, a\n\nmass emotional depression lasting from the middle of the nineteenth century\n\nthough the middle of the twentieth. Once Sartre declared existentialism\n\na thing of the past, that was it. Critical theory, postmodernism, and all\n\nthings Marx rose in stature, fending off the likes of Ayn\n\nRand.\n\nCooper, David E. Existentialism:\n\nA Reconstruction. 2nd ed.
