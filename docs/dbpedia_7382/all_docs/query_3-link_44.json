        "text": "Jean-Paul Sartre 1947\n\nThe Historical Process\n\nSource: Michel Contat and Michel Rybalka, Les Écrits de Sartre. Gallimard, Paris, 1970;\n\nTranslated: for marxists.org by Mitch Abidor, 2008;\n\nCopyLeft: Creative Commons (Attribute & ShareAlike) marxists.org 2008.\n\nAs existentialism swept the world in the immediate post-war years, Sartre was subject to vicious attacks by both the French Communist Party and the world Communist movement. Among those who attacked him at various times were official philosophers like Roger Garaudy, Henri Lefebvre and George Lukacs. A certain D. Zaslavski wrote a vicious attack on Sartre in Pravda on January 23, 1947, which defined existentialism as follows: “From the French: existence. Teaches that any historical process is absurd and fortuitous, any morality a falsehood. It is the doctrine of spiritual emptiness. As far as it is concerned there are not, there cannot be, either laws or norms. There is no history, only ‘historification’. There is no morality, only a ‘lifestyle’. There are neither peoples nor societies, only personal interest and profit, by virtue of the principle: carpe diem.” As a way of ridiculing it, Sartre published the piece in Les Temps Modernes in May of that year, but he wrote a response to it that appeared in the Gazette de Lausanne on February 8, 1947.\n\n“Existentialism is unaware of the historical process.”\n\n(Pravda January 23, 1947)\n\nI have expected an attack of this kind for some time. In my review, Les Temps Modernes, I had posed a few questions to Communist intellectuals and they weren’t able to answer. What is more, M. Ilya Ehrenburg, upon his return from America, severely criticized my books, and I had forced him to admit that he hadn’t read them, which he did with good grace and without being the least bit flustered. It was obviously necessary that an encyclical be issued to make things clear. It goes without saying that M. Zaslavski had no more read existentialist works than did M. Ehrenburg. Be he speaks of them from even higher and farther away. I am embarrassed to answer him: we answer someone, but M. Zaslavski is no one. Provisionally he is the editorialist of Pravda, and it is the “historical process” ( to use his words) that expresses itself though his mouth. Tomorrow, perhaps, the historical process will turn away from him and he’ll be a number in Siberia and everyone will have forgotten him. He will never have been a person; I regret this for his sake and mine. It remains for me then to address the “historical process” and to express my regrets to it that it chose so bad an interpreter. It could doubtless not find any others. The historical process always has reasons. But it would have been desirable that M. Zaslavski, who haughtily declares that “existentialism is the negation of all of philosophy,” prove, at least in his article, that he was himself a philosopher. Alas, in this hateful and stupid mass there is not a single sensible word. I will limit myself to pointing out the following errors:"
