        "text": "The aim of this paper is to describe the problem of God in Sartre’s philosophy. Even if Sartre has always been on the side of atheism, God has undoubtedly been a very important issue in his thought, at least during the 1940s, with the studies on the onto-phenomenology of Being and Nothingness (1943) and on the ethics of Notebooks for an Ethics (1947-48). We would like to demonstrate that Sartre, like all existentialists, had to make a bet regarding the role and the existence of God in humans’ world. This bet allowed him to think about God in a double way: the first path leads to the concept of God as the highest value of anyone, embedded in the being of everyone, of which we should get rid in order to be free; the second one brings to the hypothesis of the divinity of the mankind, i.e. of God thought as Humanity, a situation of ontological authenticity that opens the field of a true existentialist ethics. We will purpose to focus the attention of the theme of creation as the link between Sartrean ontology and his ethics: what should be a man, in order to be causa sui?"
