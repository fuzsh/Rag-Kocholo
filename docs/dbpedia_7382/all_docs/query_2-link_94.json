        "text": "-- Epictetus Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher who lived from around 50 CE to 135 CE. Born into slavery in the city of Hierapolis in Phrygia (modern-day Turkey), Epictetus was eventually freed and became one of the most influential Stoic philosophers of his time. Epictetus taught that philosophy is a way of life and that the primary goal of philosophy is to help individuals live in accordance with nature and reason. His teachings emphasize the importance of focusing on what is within one's control (one's own actions and attitudes) and accepting what is not within one's control (external events and the actions of others) with equanimity. Unlike many philosophers, Epictetus did not write down his teachings. They were recorded by his disciple Arrian in two works: the \"Discourses\" and the \"Enchiridion\" (often translated as \"The Handbook\"). These texts have had a profound impact on the development of Stoic thought and have been influential in both ancient and modern philosophy. Epictetus' philosophy revolves around the idea that true freedom comes from understanding the nature of reality and living in harmony with it. He believed that external events are beyond our control, and that our perceptions, judgments, and reactions are what truly matter. His teachings emphasize the importance of virtue, self-discipline, and the pursuit of wisdom. Epictetus' ideas have had a lasting influence on Western philosophy, particularly in the realm of ethics. His works continue to be studied and respected for their practical wisdom and insights into human nature. #inspirationalquote #motivationalquote #wisdomquotes #lifelesson\n\nYes, respect yourself first! If you're not being honest with yourself and hiding the truth from yourself, you can't be who you are! You then reflect the contradiction between who you really are and what you think you are, your mind! And you are not your mind! If you decide to let your mind direct the operations, you will only experience disillusion and frustration because its spokesperson, your ego, acts like a judge if not even a dictator who makes you act under duress. Indeed, your ego being empty or illusory, because it is only the representation of the past in the present, constantly tries to resemble an ideal image invented by itself on the basis of what it knows! But the present, the moment you live is always unknown, which pushes it out of its comfort zone! Indeed, knowledge disappears into the unknown to give way to infinity! The ego being limited to what it believes, your limiting beliefs, it hates the unknown and therefore invariably brings you back within its limits to control the situation and therefore continue to exist! This therefore causes a distortion of the present through the contradiction caused by the ego and this is reflected in your reality which certainly exists, but which is an unpleasant illusion. This reality makes you know the dissatisfaction, the suffering and above all fear, source of all the evils! The fear of disappearing of course, but also of not being identical to the invented image! And since this image is not reality, it will remain ad vitam impossible! So yes, you are embarking on an impossible mission with your ego because you are never aligned, neither with what is nor with who you really are! Do the following experiment to eventually take a direction: calm the frenzy of your thoughts, without fighting them but just by letting them pass through you, let the energy circulate to unclog your mind so that a new energy can approach you! Listen to the judge from afar but don't put him in the foreground, don't compare anymore and don't expect answers, no results. Be just as you are and listen to the whisper of life that is heard when all else is quieter! Observe and be grateful for everything you perceive, accept without resisting, without wanting to change, enjoy the moment you are living, nothing more and nothing less! This is a first step towards freedom! Do it, and see!\n\nFLASH BACK OF (2022/12/02) OPPORTUNITIES IN PHILOSOPHY Philosophy is not necessarily meant to teach anyone anything rather to make one think (reflective thoughtfulness). As you know thinkers are policy makers. So a philosopher can work in any place that thinking or policy making is needed,and philosophers could make good dectetives as well. In fact philosophy has wider opportunities than any course in social sciences and arts or humanities. Moreover, philosophy has the ability of giving anyone that interfaced with her a moral and values consciousness and discipline,as well as resurrection of humanity in human.However, it gives independent mind,some sense of reservation, responsibility and nobility: that makes me to think that a philosopher might be at his best when he is an independent professional,making and executing his policies,in consonance with ideals of the profession. The best environment for a philosopher is at least a decent society,if not he would regularly run into conflicts with the people and societal modus operandi. ISN-ODP: Nebeolism-Igweism (2023/11/02)"
