        "text": "AT THE EXISTENTIALIST CAFÉ\n\nFreedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails\n\nBy Sarah Bakewell\n\nIllustrated. 439 pp. Other Press. $25.\n\nSarah Bakewell’s book is a joint portrait of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Albert Camus, Karl Jaspers, Martin Heideg­ger and a half-dozen other European writers and philosophers who embodied the movements in 20th-century thought known as existentialism and phenomenology. The apricot cocktails in her subtitle and her sometimes breezy tone — “I like to imagine them in a big, busy cafe of the mind, probably a Parisian one” — seem to promise an undemanding, gossipy romp. Instead, she judges and explains the ways in which each writer responded to the moral and political crises of the 1930s and after, and her book asks demanding questions about the ways in which people think about themselves and their relations with others. She shapes her answers in the form of biographical narratives, because her central theme is that the large impersonal ideas pursued by much modern philosophy are less profound and illuminating than the varied and conflicting truths found in stories of individual lives.\n\nThose stories, in this book, include impressively lucid descriptions of what these thinkers thought and what they said in their writings and cafe arguments. Bakewell is often annoyed but never defeated by Heidegger’s obscurity, and some of her most exciting pages are the engaged, unsimplifying accounts she offers of complex philosophies, even ones that finally repel her.\n\nIn her first chapter she summarizes the kinds of things that existentialists do. This is not the same as saying what existentialism is, because to say what it is would present it as something static and definable, whereas it exists only in the form of actions, what happens when someone thinks existentially. Briefly, she explains, “existentialists concern themselves with individual, concrete human existence,” and individual existence is “whatever I choose to make of myself at every moment.” An existentialist’s driving concern is human freedom and the responsibilities and anxieties that are inseparable from it.\n\nThe stories she tells begin in medias res, around 1932, in a real Parisian cafe where Sartre is intrigued by his school friend Raymond Aron’s report of a new philosophical movement, phenomenology. It concerned itself, Aron explained, not with the theoretical or moral meaning of things, but with the things themselves and the immediate experience we have of those things. The apricot cocktails are in Bakewell’s subtitle because, as Beauvoir recalled, they were drinking them in the cafe when Aron said you could “make philosophy” out of them.\n\nAfter this, “At the Existentialist Café” leaves France for Germany and goes backward in time to the early-20th-­century origins of phenomenology in the work of Edmund Husserl and the stirrings of reaction against it in Husserl’s early acolyte Heidegger. From phenomenology, with its emphasis on the experience of things, it was a short step — for, among others, Sartre, Beauvoir and their friend Merleau-Ponty — to existentialism, with its emphasis on the experience of making choices, and on the wider question of what it means to be in the world at all.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
