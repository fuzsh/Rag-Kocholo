        "text": "The article discusses rationalistic and existential approaches to the problem of existence. The comparison of Sartre&#39;s pre-reflective cogito and Descartes&#39; reflective cogito makes it possible to define how Sartre’s thought moves from the thing to consciousness and from consciousness to the thing. At the same time, in Being and Nothingness Sartre does not only define the existence of the thing in its passivity—which in many respects corresponds to Descartes&#39; philosophy, but also as an open orientation towards consciousness, the latter concept not being fully developed by him. This statement may be regarded as a hidden component of Sartre’s key thesis about the role of the Other in the verification of our existence. The most important factor in understanding this is the concept of the look. Detailed analysis of Sartre’s theses in Being and Nothingness enables us to demonstrate that the concept of the look makes it possible to consider the identity of being-in-itself and be...\n\nThis paper aims to explain the contributions of the famous Philosopher of 19th century Jean Paul Sartre. It will analyze the early life and his contribution in filed of philosophy and politics. Phenomenological terms like existentialism, morality and dialects are explained via Sartre’s critical approach. The last part of the paper will tend to highlight some crucial critiques on his writings by prominent scholars of 19th and 20th century.\n\nThe question ‘how is man to live in this world?’ is one which is common to every man who reflects on his life, beliefs and ideas. Of course, this question has been the center of existentialists’ explorations, and Jean-Paul Sartre too begins his Philosophical investigations with this issue. As a movement in philosophy, existentialism is essentially the search for the meaning of life, the condition of man, the state of being free, and man’s always using his freedom. It further focuses on individual human lives and the poignant inevitability of suffering and choices of each individual. And so, man first is, and only subsequently is, this or that. In a word, man must create his own essence: it is in throwing himself into the world, suffering there, struggling there, that he gradually defines himself. The vocation of the Sartrean man then, is the perpetual process of his self-creation with a deep sense of responsibility. Man’s freedom can thus be limited by his facticity which, according to Sartre, comprises one’s place, body, past, position and fundamental relations with others.\n\nFreedom is a necessary prerequisite for living, as most existentialists emphasized. Jean-Paul Sartre, a prominent existentialist, fully appreciated the importance of freedom in helping humans lead authentic lives. In his philosophical magnum opus, Being and Nothingness, he proposed the notion of freedom and responsibility as a moral compass to an authentic existence. This paper will consider problems associated with Jean-Paul Sartre’s notion of freedom and responsibility, starting by explaining how Sartre conceived the concepts. This paper will examine some of the objections raised by Alvin Plantinga against Sartre’s philosophy of freedom. And finally, this paper will also analyze Sartre’s notion of freedom and responsibility and reveal its incompatibilities with universal morality.\n\nThis presentation would be considered as an attempt to introduce a new bridge between philosophy and art. The main problem of this presentation is “how can a conception of art grounded on humanist existentialism and phenomenological ontology be possible?” For the answer, this presentation concentrates on Jean-Paul Sartre’s philosophy. Existentialism and phenomenology are the two influential concepts of contemporary philosophy. Sartre brings these two concepts together and develops a new type of existentialism. Answering the question “how would the existence of human being be without belief in the existence of God?” Sartre develops his humanist atheistic existentialism. Sartre’s existentialism indicates a new understanding of the human being that comes after the destruction of onto-theo-logical constitution of the conception of the human being essential to western metaphysics. Thus Sartre introduces the concept of “phenomenological ontology”. Throughout this presentation, the fundeme...\n\nJean Paul Sartre is canonized as one of the main contributors to Existentialism along with Heidegger and Camus. And even though his philosophical treatise and manuscripts were exhaustive and prolific, his literature is what was able to solidify his genius. He created a bridge for his audience to understand the dry intelligence of his academic mind through his book, relying on imagination, philosophies of contingency, absurdity and the power which sets us unhinged to conventional religion as authentic beings that separates the two. The paper reviews the books Nausea, The Flies, No Exit and accounts for his life as it influenced his philosophy."
