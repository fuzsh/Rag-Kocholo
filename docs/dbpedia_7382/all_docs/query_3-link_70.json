        "text": "6533 words\n\nfor Gendering Western Philosophy, editor Karen J. Warren\n\nSimone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre\n\nby\n\nEdward Fullbrook and Margaret A. Simons\n\nSimone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre struggled for the whole of their philosophical careers against one of modern western philosophys most pervasive concepts, the Cartesian notion of self. This essay will show the considerable part that gender, especially Beauvoirs position as a woman in 20th-century France, played in the development, presentation and reception of the couples alternative formulation. A notion of self is always a complex of ideas and in the case of Beauvoir and Sartre includes the ideas of embodiment, temporality, the Other and intersubjectivity. We begin by looking briefly at the history of the tradition against which Beauvoir and Sartre rebelled.\n\nCartesian Heritage\n\nRené Descartes began his famous metaphysical deliberations (Discourse on Method, 1637; Mediations, 1641) at an historical crossroads. It was a time when secularized conceptions of the self were undermining religious ones, thereby destroying the certainty about ones self and place in the world that had been a common birthright in the West for centuries. Caught up in this historical flux, Descartes suffered what today we would call existential despair. Even his own existence fell for him within the sphere of the doubtful. He resolved to regain his lost certainty of self. For this he invented a philosophical method.\n\nI thought it necessary . . . to reject as if utterly false anything in which I could discover the least grounds for doubt, so that I could find out if I was left with anything at all which was absolutely indubitable. [Discourse on Method, part IV]\n\nWhat became so significant for the history of philosophy and eventually for the philosophical ambitions of Beauvoir and Sartre was that Descartes counted as doubtable anything revealed by our senses and, astonishingly, the existence of his own body.\n\nI shall consider myself as having no hands, no eyes, no flesh, no blood, nor any senses, yet falsely believing myself to possess all these things . . . [First Meditation (Haldane and Ross, p. 19)]\n\nOnly his existence as an incorporeal thinking being survived his program of radical doubt. I am thinking, therefore I exist.\n\nDescartes conception of himself as disembodied initiated the idea of a thinker/observer who is completely detached, existing independently of time, place and other human beings. I am a substance, he wrote in A Discourse on Method (Part IV), the whole nature or essence of which is to think, and which for its existence does not need any place or depend on any material thing. This phantom of perfect non-gendered self-consciousness and independence was reified by succeeding generations to become the intellectual ideal of Western society. Even British empiricism, contrary sometimes to popular belief, founded itself on Descartes notion of a completely autonomous self, separate from place, time, materiality and society, and therefore self-identical over time.1\n\nThrough the centuries the inward-looking line of thought begun by Descartes became a worldly and pervasive force in society. The Cartesian view of human reality, both in Europe and in the English-speaking world, shaped the way we think, especially the way we theorize, about all aspects of social and personal existence. Descartes disembodiment of human thought created a conceptually unbridgeable gap between the observer and the observed, the knower and the known, the subject and the object, thereby ascribing to each individual two separate planes of existence, an inside and an outside: one where we are the observer, the knower and the subject, the other where we are the observed, the known and the object of thought and perception. Under this dualism the body came to be thought of as a mere capsule, with windows called sense organs, in which human consciousness, cut off from the immediacy of the world around it and forever secure from the possibility of intersubjectivity, lived. This led to the tradition of thinking of the nature of human beings abstractly, as outside and beyond society, thereby erasing their complex and ongoing development as social beings.\n\nThe commitment to intrasubjective philosophy initiated by Descartes was renewed with the advent of the Analytical movement at the beginning of the 20th century. In The Problems of Philosophy (1912), effectively the movements manifesto, Bertrand Russell cajoles and enjoins fellow philosophers to embrace Cartesian fundamentals. He calls for recruits who\n\nwill see as God might see, without a here and now, without hopes and fears, without the trammels of customary beliefs and traditional prejudices . . . [and who] will value more the abstract and universal knowledge into which the accidents of private history do not enter, than the knowledge brought by the senses, and dependent, as such knowledge must be, upon an exclusive and personal point of view and a body whose sense-organs distort as much as they reveal. [Russell (1912) 1967, p. 93]\n\nRussells notion of the ideal philosopher, which was and remains so extraordinarily influential, helps us to understand and appreciate Simone de Beauvoir because she in effect defined herself as its antithesis.2 She rejected the Cartesian disembodied, ahistorical and intrasubjective, and thus noumenal self both as her ultimate unit of analysis and as the supposed basis of her performance as a philosopher. From her recently discovered early diaries we know that in her student days Beauvoir had already settled upon her radical approach.\n\nBeauvoirs Student Diaries\n\nThe philosophical precocity displayed in Beauvoirs student diaries, especially her commitment to the philosophers life and her dogged determination to think through philosophys big questions for herself, is impressive. Reading her diaries exhilarates, first because they drawn us into this young womans extreme, almost preternatural passion for life and second because we see already emerging some of the originality of not only Beauvoirs mature philosophical thought but also Sartres. She dedicates herself to developing my philosophical ideas and going deeper into the problems that have appealed to me . . . (p. 95) We also see developing her method, the intermingling of the personal with the philosophical, done with a logical hardheadedness that even the young Descartes or the mature Hume might have envied. And just as Descartes method of eliminating from philosophical consideration all aspects of himself that were not certain and fixed had the consequence of defining a permissible field of inquiry, so also are Beauvoirs philosophical method and concerns inextricably intertwined.\n\nIn her Diaries, Beauvoir, like Descartes in his Meditations, is foremostly concerned with the nature of her self. But she moves in the opposite direction from Descartes, seeking to bring back into philosophical illumination all those aspects of the human self blanked out by his radical reduction. This means examining the human self as an entity that exists not in seclusion but in-the-world. Philosophical tradition as commonly conveyed then did not support such a project. That did not stop Beauvoir in 1927, still a teenager, from committing herself to this pursuit. Attracted to works by Henri Bergson and Gottfried Leibniz (an unlikely pairing), she culled ideas from them which when combined with her own formed the first foundation of what became the basis of her and others mature thought. We should, therefore, look closely at the diaries of this girl-woman because, regardless of what prejudice may say, they document a series of mental events important in shaping 20th century Continental philosophy.\n\nAlready in her 1926 diary, Beauvoir, age 18, began to identify and formulate the problem of the Other, which in various forms became the preeminent philosophical concern and focus of both her and Sartres philosophical careers. In terms of the role of gender, it is particularly interesting to observe how Beauvoir came to this philosophical interest and arrived at her own formulation of the problem. It concerns the peculiar epistemological nature of her diaries. They are characterized by three primary dimensions. Firstly, they are fine examples of a late teenage girls diaries, one of the oldest and commonest of all literary genres. You find in Beauvoirs diaries accounts of heartthrob, self-doubt and general mental tumult. Secondly, her diaries are examples of a serious philosophy students journal, not a common genre but one with pedigree. It calls for the student to write down his or her bright ideas, usually gleamed from lectures. The third dimension of Beauvoirs diary-writing does the most improbable thing: it links the first two and not, as you might expect, by applying philosophical ideas to an analysis of personal experiences. The link works in the opposite direction. This is Beauvoirs innovation as a diarist and accounts in the main for her student diaries philosophical originality. She describes her experiences at coping, or not, with lifes contingencies and then, sometimes over a period of weeks or months, distills from then general philosophical questions and insights.\n\nFor example, consider how Beauvoir came to her formulation of the problem of the self and the other. Early in her 1926 diary she considers how one must serve both ones self and others, the one posing the temptation of egoism, the other the temptation of self-abnegation. She writes: [Its] very difficult, because turning in on oneself readily turns into egoism; while on the other hand, when one goes out of oneself, its indeed rare that one does not go too far and that one is not diminished. What Im, proposing is to achieve this equilibrium (CA26 1). This reflective musing, based on her own in-the-world experience, shows a certain wisdom but without rising above the level of advice dispensed by a good professional counselor. Later in the same years diary, however, she translates her empirical observation into a bold and anti-Cartesian philosophical proposition. She makes an ontological distinction between two parts in my existence: one for others [pour autrui], the links that unite me with all beings, and another part for myself [pour moi-mème] (CA26 53).\n\nOne cannot help but notice the similarity between Beauvoirs and Descartess predicaments that led them to radical philosophical reflection. She also faced an existential crisis. Hers arose from her loss of her childhood faith in God and from the development of her critical consciousness:\n\n\"What has this year brought me intellectually?a serious philosophical formation that has . . . sharpened my critical spirit, alas! . . . I have everywhere noted only our powerlessness to establish anything in the realm of knowledge as in that of ethics\" (Beauvoir 1927, 11).\n\nThe frustrated yearning for an absolute justification for her life, threatens her, as it did Descartes, with despair. But her response is the opposite of his: she chooses the phenomenal world in preference to the noumenal one. Moreover, she fails to find being anchored to a self in her consciousness. \"These miserable efforts for being!\" she writes in her diary entry for May 19, 1927 \"... at its very base, masked by these daily diversions, the same void!\" (p. 55). Against the Cartesian tradition, she takes her self to be an entity that will be constructed in the course of life and thus an object of consciousness rather than its subject that resides readymade in it.\n\n\"I know myself that there is only one problem and that it does not have a solution, because perhaps it has no sense. . . : I would like to believe in something-- to encounter total exigency-- to justify life; in brief, I would like God. Once this is said, I will not forget it. But knowing that this unattainable noumenal world exists where alone could be explained to me why I live, in the phenomenal world (which is not for all that so negligible), I will construct my life.I will take myself as an end\" (p. 62).\n\nPhilosophically, this was a doubly radical position to take. Beauvoir was rejecting not only the Cartesian self, but also Henri Bergsons proposed alternative, which was to identify with ones memories, that is with ones past. Thinking of Bergson in 1927, Beauvoir wrote:\n\nMy past is behind me like a thing gone from me; on which I can no longer act and which I regard with the eyes of a stranger, a thing in which I have no part at all. (Beauvoir 1927, 18 (April 28))\n\nThis idea that ones self, that is ones being, is continually in the making and thus haunted by a nothingness, became fundamental both to Beauvoirs and, more famously, to Sartres mature thought (Being and Nothingness, 1943). Indeed the idea is invariably attributed to Sartre, but the fact is that Beauvoir in her diary was in 1927 already talking about the nothingness of everything human. (1927, 160)\n\nBeauvoirs phenomenological turn not only set her apart from the modern mainstream philosophical tradition, but also presented her with new methodological imperatives and possibilities for doing philosophy. By committing herself to the phenomenal world in the pursuit of philosophical truth she had to find a way to get beyond the philosophers traditional a priorism. As we have described, she was already doing this through her diaries. But a vague suggestion from Henri Bergson pointed her toward another way of doing philosophy, one through which gender difference would in time have a profound impact on her and Sartres philosophical careers. In Time and Free Will Bergson gestures at the possibility of some bold novelist (TFW 133) revealing the phenomenological realities of selfhood masked by philosophical terminology. The teenage Beauvoir grabbed hold of and began to flesh-out this idea, declaring her intention to write philosophy in fictional form:\n\nI must . . . write essays on life which would not be a novel, but philosophy, linking them together vaguely with a fiction but the thought would be the essential thing, and I would be searching to find the truth, not to express it, to describe the search for truth (CA27 54)\n\nAnd she knew for which philosophical problems she would search for the truth.\n\nI must rework my philosophical ideas . . . go deeper into the problems that have appealed to me . . . The theme is almost always this opposition of self and other that I felt at beginning to live. (p. 95)\n\nHow often in the history of philosophy has there been a philosopher so precocious as Beauvoir? She was only 19, but had already:\n\n·on the basis of her own analysis rejected the standard self of philosophy as well as the one ready-made alternative on offer;\n\n·broadly formulated a new notion of self;\n\n·committed herself to pursuing the reorientation of philosophy from the study of the noumenal world to the phenomenal world;\n\n·set about developing a new philosophical method;\n\n·identified being and nothingness as her central theme;\n\n·settled upon the opposition of self and other as her primary philosophical problem\n\nAlso, please note, Beauvoir was still two years away from meeting Sartre. Meanwhile he also read (April 1925, age 20) and took inspiration from Bergson in his first year as a university student. After reading Time and Free Will he opted decisively for philosophy as his line of study, Bergson having shown him the possibility of connecting philosophy with psychology and thus to personal experience. This way of approaching philosophy fitted his prior and continuing intention to become a novelist. (F&F 1993, 28) Thus although Beauvoir and Sartre took the same book both as their starting point for philosophical exploration and as their rationale for connecting philosophy and fiction, they did so for opposite reasons. Sartre initially looked to philosophy as a means for enhancing his fiction, whereas Beauvoir envisioned fiction as her means for developing new philosophy.\n\nAlthough perhaps initially unaware, Beauvoirs idea of using fiction as the literary form in which she would do philosophy was profoundly significant to her precisely because she was a woman. Her commitment to give her life to the pursuit of philosophical truth, when interpreted as a career aspiration and placed in the social context of her time and place, was, without her methodological innovation, patently absurd. Philosophers were male. The very idea of a great or original woman thinker was, like a round square, perceived as a non-sequeter. Women did not write philosophy books, or if they did, they were not published as such. Women did however, even if not with the frequency of men, write and publish short stories and novels.\n\nBeauvoir and Sartre Together\n\nBeauvoir and Sartre met in 1929 in the final weeks of their student days, immediately commencing a philosophical dialogue that continued until Sartres death in 1980. Soon they became lovers as well as colleagues. In October 1929, on a stone bench in the shadows of the Louvre, they took an oath of mutual allegiance. Their agreement, which allowed them each to have other sexual partners, remained the primary framework for both their lives until Sartres death. We mention these personal facts not for their color but because an appreciation of Beauvoir and Sartres relationship is essential to understanding their working lives as professional philosophers and thus to how gender in complex ways entered directly and indirectly into the making of their philosophy.\n\nThe meeting of Beauvoir and Sartre was the beginning of long apprenticeships for both of them, especially Beauvoir. She would not break into print until 1943, yet all the while writing almost continually, turning out a succession of practice novels and stories, honing her technique. Sartre also scribbled incessantly, essays as well as fiction. Mercilessly they critiqued each others efforts. During these years they worked as lycee philosophy teachers, first in the provinces, later in Paris.\n\nBeauvoir continued to be fascinated with the problem of otherness and of the Other. Sartre also had an intellectual interest in other people but, as Beauvoir explained in The Prime of Life, it was mainly psychological whereas hers was attuned to philosophical questions, especially ontological ones. (124-6) His first published work, The Imagination (1936) was mainly a psychological work that does not enter into the sort of questions that fascinated Beauvoir. In fact, throughout the whole of the 1930s, and in retrospect this seems remarkable, Sartre appears not to have shared Beauvoirs primary philosophical concern.\n\nThey did however during these years pursue together other philosophical problems. Most notable of these was how to explain a whole range of human behavior without appealing to the existence of an unconscious, a concept of psychological determinism inconsistent with their emerging notion of human freedom. Instead they attributed these behaviors to a form of self-deceit that they called bad faith. By systematically observing themselves and people around them they identified various types and patterns of self-deceit, gradually building up an ever more powerful system of analysis that became central to their shared philosophy, as well as providing the basis for a non-Freudian branch of psychoanalysis.\n\nBy 1930 the question of contingency versus determinism was a fashionable topic in French philosophy, and soon after Sartre finished his formal studies he began a lengthy, abstract dissertation on contingency. (PoL, 106) But his first draft left Beauvoir unimpressed. She set about convincing him that he could and should turn his essay into a novel. He agreed and over a period of several years wrote many drafts of what was to become Nausea, the most celebrated on all his novels. Beauvoir read and meticulously critiqued each draft. As she has explained:\n\nI knew exactly what he was after, and I could more nearly put myself in a readers place than he could when it came to judging whether he had hit the mark or not. The result was that he invariably took my advice. (PoL, 106)\n\nNausea was published in 1938 to both instant acclaim and recognition of its philosophical dimension. Subsequently it became part of the cannon of existential philosophy. Arthur Danto, an eminent American analytical philosopher, regards Nausea as Sartres second most important philosophical work and begins his excellent book on Sartres philosophy as follows:\n\nSartres great philosophical novel, Nausea is a sustained reflection on the relationships and ultimately the discrepancies between the world and our ways of representing it; and each of its major characters is defined through his deep belief that reality has the structures which, he comes to realize, instead belong to the several ways he organizes it. (Danto 1991, p. 5)\n\nThe Methodology of Existentialism\n\nBut how, you may ask, is sustained philosophical reflection possible in a novel? Consumerist culture encourages us to mistake form for content and thus confuse the means of expression with the ideas expressed. So to be on safe side, we want to elaborate further  because it is so crucial to an appreciation of Sartre and Beauvoir as philosophers and of their working relationship -- how the nature of their philosophical pursuits enabled and at times required them to write and create new philosophy by using, in addition to the essay, the novel, the short story and the diary.\n\nBeauvoir, remember, in her student days rejected the idea that philosophers had special universal access to the world, that, as Russell put it, they could see as God might see, without a here and now. Moreover, as working philosophers, she and Sartre inverted the universalist presumption. In 1946, Beauvoir published an essay Literature and Metaphysics explaining the philosophical method used by Sartre in Nausea and herself in She Came to Stay and other works. If the world can be viewed only from a particular point of view, she argued, then the philosophical enterprise must begin with particular and concrete descriptions of subjects relations with the world and with other consciousnesses. Beauvoir believes that there is a metaphysical dimension to everyones daily existence and that peoples lives are full of metaphysical experiences: ones presence in the world, for example, ones abandonment in the world, ones freedom, the opacity of things, the resistance of foreign consciousnesses. To make philosophy, she says, is to be philosophical in the sense of sensitizing oneself to these individual metaphysical experiences and then describing them. If other people recognize these particular statements as true, then in a manner suggestive of empirical science, they can be used to generate general statements. For Beauvoir, and subsequently Sartre, good philosophical practice began not with a priorism but with accurate descriptions of an individuals metaphysical relations with the world, something for which fiction, as Bergson had suggested, was ideally suited. Beauvoir explains it as follows.\n\nIn the real world the sense of an object is not a concept knowable by pure understanding: it is the object in that it unveils itself to us in the global relation that we maintain with it and in that it is action, emotion, sentiment; ones asks of the novelists to evoke this presence of flesh and bone whose complexity, singular and infinitely rich, overflows all subjective interpretation. (ML, 105-6)\n\nMary Warnock, another eminent analytical philosopher who has found much to admire in existential philosophy, explains its method like this:\n\nThe methodology of Existentialism . . . consists in a perfectly deliberate and intentional use of the concrete as a way of approaching the abstract, the particular as a way of approaching the general. (Warnock, 133)\n\nAnd:\n\nThe existential philosopher, then, must above all describe the world in such a way that its meanings emerge. He cannot, obviously, describe the world as a whole. He must take examples in as much detail as he can, and from these examples his intuition of significance will become clear. It is plain how close such a method is to the methods of the novelist, the short-story writer . . . (Warnock, 136)\n\nShe Came to Stay and Being and Nothingness\n\nThe ultimate exemplification of the use of fiction as a vehicle for philosophical discovery is Beauvoirs first published novel, She Came to Stay (1943). Sartres Being and Nothingness, a conventional philosophers essay on which his philosophical reputation in the main rests, was also published in 1943. Beauvoir, however, had drafted her novel before Sartre began his essay. And it could not have been otherwise because She Came to Stay constituted the primary research that lies behind the more abstract Being and Nothingness.\n\nThe relation between these two works, both in the process of their creation and in their public reception, is fascinating, complex and heavily influenced by gender. Space does not permit a broad survey of the philosophical content of She Came to Stay, so we will focus on its complex concept of self, before showing how this and other material from Beauvoirs novel came to be used by Sartre in Being and Nothingness. Finally we will consider the part gender played in determining the couples division of philosophical labor and the publics response to these two books.\n\nShe Came to Stay takes place in the bohemian Paris of the late 1930s and is centered on the lives of five young people variously involved in the arts. Most of the narrative takes the point of view of Françoise, who is thirty and an aspiring writer. The book opens with Françoise personifying the Cartesian self, namely she regards her consciousness as independent both of her body and other consciousnesses and her self as self-identical over time. Françoise then undergoes a series of lived situations that test these and other hypotheses, the metaphysical drama of the novel being coextensive with the philosophical argument. The events of the first half of the book falsify the traditional positions, while the second half develops Beauvoirs own theories further, with constant testing against the characters experiences.\n\nShe Came to Stay shows individuals divided not between mind and body, but between their situation or, as she calls it, facticity (aspects which resemble inert objects, for example, the past, social circumstance, and body-as-object) and elements of freedom, for example, projects, values, and the body-as-subject. Its characters fall into bad faith when they fail to co-ordinate these two dimensions of their reality, that is, when they pretend that they are facticity without freedom or freedom without facticity. This split in human being makes self-identity an illusive goal: our freedom keeps our sense of self, including even how we see our past, from ever being complete and final. Through her characters Beauvoir demonstrates that one is always separated from one's \"self\" by one's freedom to do, imagine or believe differently. Furthermore, as with all objects of consciousness, the possible points of view one may adopt toward one's \"self\" is unlimited.\n\nBy letting go of the traditional views of consciousness as disembodied and of the self as a fixed entity residing in consciousness and putting in their place the ideas of embodied consciousness and of the self as an object of consciousness and an ongoing project, Beauvoir was opening the philosophical door to the possibility that the self could be fundamentally influenced by other people. This was part of her groundwork for solving her problem of the other with which as a teenager she had so passionately begun her philosophers life.\n\nBut this problem, which figures so large in She Came to Stay, was not only a personal and experiential one; it also tied up with one the oldest problems in philosophy: How do we know that other people are, like ourselves, conscious beings? We can observe, \"other people from without, through the shape of words, gestures and faces\", but we cannot observe that they have thoughts and sensations like ourselves. [Beauvoir, 1984 (1943) p. 135] From ones individual experience of being conscious one can argue from analogy that other people are conscious too, but as a philosophical argument this barely makes the grade. Nor does it provide any ontological foundation for creating a theory of intersubjectivity. Even those, like Hegel and Heidegger, who might have wished to do so, could not provide a direct relation between concrete individual consciousnesses.\n\nBut Beauvoir did and did so by borrowing an old trick from Descartes. His cogito, I am thinking, therefore I am, offers no proof or argument that he exists. Instead he identifies a fundamental experience, thinking, that leads him to believe beyond all doubt that he exists and that is, he presumes, a part of everyones experience. Similarly, Beauvoir ignored the problem of proving the existence of other minds, in favour of asking: What universal experience leads us all to believe other people to be conscious beings like ourselves? She answers that it is the phenomenological event of experiencing oneself as the object of anothers look. To be conscious of being looked at or judged by another person can actually cause a metamorphosis in someones consciousness: they are made aware that they have another self, an objective one which exists only for the Other. In She Came to Stay, Pierre peeking at lovers though a keyhole and imagining himself being caught illustrates the experience. [pp. 307-10) ] His self-for-the-other is revealed to him as an awareness that the Other has an image of him as an object in a world whose centre of reference is no longer his consciousness. This experience of being an object entails the Other-as-subject: only another consciousness could cause this decentering of his sense of self.\n\nShe Came to Stay is structured in part around six modes of Being-for-Others, [masochism, love, sadism, hate, desire, and indifference] and provides numerous illustrations and extensive analysis of each. For Beauvoir, the philosophical significance of these common experiences is that they all presume a direct or internal relation between consciousnesses. For example, the flush of embarrassment one undergoes when caught, like Pierre, in an unseemly act is not founded on an analogy which probabilistically induces the existence of other consciousnesses, rather it manifests itself instantaneously as the consequence of a causal relation internal to their consciousness and the Other's. The persons embarrassment arises from a sudden transformation in the mode of their consciousness, from one where they experienced themself wholly as subject, that is, as the point of view around which the world is organized, to a mode where they are an object in a world organized by the Other. This asymmetrical subject/object relation so extensively explored in She Came to Stay provides the ontological basis of Beauvoir's theory of intersubjectivity, which, when extended to groups as well as to individuals, provided the analytical framework of her most famous work, The Second Sex.\n\nLong ago it was pointed out by the English translator of Being and Nothingness, Hazel Barnes, that much of its philosophical content is also found in She Came to Stay. For example Barnes writes:\n\nAs with all of de Beauvoirs early fiction, the reader of She Came to Stay feels that the inspiration of the book was simply de Beauvoirs decision to show how Sartres abstract principles could be make to work out in real life. (Barnes 1961, 121-22)\n\nBut we know now that the real work sequence between the couple was the reverse of the one suggested by Barnes. Sartres biographers divide over when Sartre began to write Being and Nothingness. Some say late July 1940; others say the autumn of 1941. But both these dates come after Beauvoir had finished the first and most, if not all, of the second draft of She Came to Stay.3 It is also now known that in February 1940 Sartre, while on leave from the army, closely read Beauvoirs manuscript. Sartre scholars agree, from a study of the diaries that he kept in this period (War Diaries) that his flowering as a philosopher with new ideas took place in the weeks immediately following his reading of Beauvoirs novel. (Hoare 1984, x; Hayman 1986, 149; Thompson 1984, 43; Flynn 1992, 215; McBride 1991, 32; Boschetti 1988, 55; Fretz 1992, 70-1, 77)\n\nIn and of itself there is nothing scandalous or indecent about Sartres debt to Beauvoir for so many of the ideas and insights that he wove together in his great treatise. It merely reflected how the couple came to work together as philosophers. But it is important, especially in the context of this book, to appreciate the social origins of their professional relationship. So to close this essay we are going to return briefly to Beauvoirs student days and diaries.\n\nA Division of Labour\n\nEarly in her student days Beauvoir became a close friend and colleague of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whom she also let study She Came to Stay long before it was published and who became not only an existential philosopher like Sartre but also his closest rival. In 1927 Merleau-Ponty came third in the philosophy exams behind two women, Simone Weil and Beauvoir. Following encounters with him and other male students who expressed irritation with these results, Beauvoir wrote as follows in her diary.\n\nAnd so, my friends, you do not like girls but consider that not only do they have a reason to satisfy but a heavy heart to restrain  and in that respect I want to remain a woman, more masculine yet in the brain, more feminine in sensibility. (Beauvoir 1927, 107)\n\nAnd a few pages further on she expands on these thoughts about how gender differences differentiate her and Merleau-Pontys approach to philosophy.\n\nAristocrat he calls me? its true. I cant get rid of this idea that I am alone, in a world apart, being present at the other as at a spectacle . . . . Dreams are forbidden him. Ah! As for me I have riches there that I do not want to get rid of. Drama of my affections, pathos of life. . . . Certainly, I have a more complicated, more nuanced sensibility than his and a more exhausting power of love. These problems that he lives with his brain, I live them with my arms and my legs. . . . I dont want to lose all of that. (Beauvoir 1927, 126)\n\nThese words, after the fact, resound with irony because Merleau-Ponty became famous for practicing philosophy in the phenomenological manner and with the emphasis on embodiment that Beauvoir was, against him, already advocating and doing. But 16 years later and now a convert, he published an article on She Came to Stay titled Metaphysics and the Novel. It includes a cogent explanation of the significance of Beauvoirs philosophical method. Classical metaphysics he writes, could pass for a speciality with which literature had nothing to do because metaphysics operated on the basis of uncontested rationalism, convinced it could make the world and human life understood by an arrangement of concepts. (1964, p. 27) But, Merleau-Ponty continues:\n\nEverything changes when a phenomenological or existential philosophy assigns itself the task, not of explaining the world or of discovering its conditions of possibility, but rather of formulating an experience of the world, a contact with the world which precedes all thought about the world. After this, whatever is metaphysical in man cannot be credited to something outside his empirical being  to God, to Consciousness. Man is metaphysical in his very being, in his loves, in his hates, in his individual and collective history. (1964, pp. 27-28)\n\nIn less sophisticated prose, these views, sentiments and passions are found in Beauvoirs teenage diaries. As a young woman she hung on to and extended the nuanced sensibility that as a girl she so prized. When in maturity Beauvoir coupled it with her writers craft, she, as Merleau-Ponty acclaimed, succeeded in unveiling pretheoretical layers of experience, in seeing the world as immediate and thus as metaphysical experience.\n\nAs the years and decades went by, Beauvoir became even more persuaded that her untraditional and feminine way of doing philosophy, if not the only valid way, was in any case essential for providing real insights upon which system builders, like her beloved Sartre, could do legitimate work. She continued to believe that the universalist presumption of male philosophers was delusory, egomaniacal and only apparently tenable when claimed from their position of masculine privilege. Likewise, to the end of her life she insisted on the philosophical relevance of individual human experience. She also, more than once, expressed the view that system building in philosophy was a form of male madness. But we know that at the very least she did heavy editing on Being and Nothingness. It must have been immensely satisfying, even thrilling, for Beauvoir to see her discoveries and ideas incorporated in Sartres system and in consequence ingested by intellectuals around the world.\n\nBeauvoir and Sartre were bound together not only by immense love but also by a division of labor. Beauvoir carried out most of the primary research and its distillation. Together, often in the cafes of Paris, they did the refinement. And Sartre did most of the system making. But ethically it was a double-edged division of labor. On the one hand it came about through the different roles, opportunities and expectations that the couples society gave the two sexes. On the other, it for 51 years gave Beauvoir and Sartre a working life in a sort of philosophers paradise.Inevitably accounts of Beavuoir and Sartres working relationship have been corrupted, often grotesquely so, by sexism. This is a great pity. In the whole of philosophy there is no story of collaboration more inspiring than the true story of the gendered philosophical partnership of Beauvoir and Sartre.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1. True, John Locke (1632-1704) broke with Rationalism by declaring that all our ideas were derived from experience. (An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, 1690) But he saw knowledge as a product of reason working out the connections between those ideas, and he insisted upon Descartes phantom as the agent who carries out this process of reason. Locke made a distinction between person and man, and, by extension, between personal identity and a mans identity. The identity of a man, he wrote, is participation of the same continued life, by constantly fleeting particles of matter, in succession vitally united to the same organized body (An Essay Concerning Human Understanding II. xxvii, 6). But the identity of a person is that of a thinking intelligent being, that has reason, and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing in different times and places. (II. xxvii. 9) Lockes thinker is not his concept of man but rather his Cartesian concept of person, who, out of ideas, creates knowledge independently of time, place and society, and who became for British philosophers, no less than for Continentals, their imaginary, ideal persona.\n\n2. An example of where the Cartesian-Russellian self continues its prominence in philosophy is John Rawls immensely influential A Theory of Justice (1971). He explains the foundational presuppositions of his work as follows.\n\nThe essential point is that we need an argument showing which principles, if any, free and equal rational persons would choose . . . My suggestion is that we think of the original position as the point of view from which noumenal selves see the world . . . The description of the original position interprets the point of view of the noumenal selves, . . . [Rawls 1971, pp. 255-6]\n\nFor philosophers, this notion that some individuals, nearly always male, possess the means to see as God might see, to attain the original position so that their point of view should then outweigh and invalidate all others holds a powerful attraction, capable of seducing the best minds, even Bertrand Russells.\n\n3. The documentary evidence for this assertion is voluminous, diverse and incontrovertible. It consists the diaries and of letters of Beauvoir and Sartre during this period, which were not available to scholars when Barnes was writing.\n\nBibliography\n\nBarnes, Hazel (1961) The Literature of Possibility: A Study of Humanistic Existentialism.
