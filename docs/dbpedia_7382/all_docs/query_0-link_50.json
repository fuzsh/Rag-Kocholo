        "text": "The introductory chapter serves both as a thematic introduction as well as an introduction to Sartre’s reception. It begins with the theme of subjectivity and selfhood. Subjectivity, that is, having a perspective on and/or agency in the world, is directly related to the topic of selfhood. A subjective being is usually regarded as something that has a certain degree of unity and individuality. In other words, it has a Self. What makes one Subject different from another? Why can I say that I am the same person throughout my life, while I am at the same time constantly changing? How does a Subject experience itself? The answer to these and other related questions are all central to the topic of selfhood.\n\nThe second section turns towards the reception of Sartre’s philosophy. It sheds a light on his position as on the most popular, yet one of the most reviled thinkers of the twentieth century. It discusses the criticism from other continental philosophers in detail and shows how this criticism is related to subjectivity and selfhood. Furthermore, it shows that the same ideas which caused him to be criticized by his peers are the ones that have been taken a source of inspiration within analytic philosophy of mind in recent years. The final section of the introduction concerns the structure of the remainder of the book."
