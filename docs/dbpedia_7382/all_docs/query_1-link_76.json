        "text": "This paper aims to explain the contributions of the famous Philosopher of 19th century Jean Paul Sartre. It will analyze the early life and his contribution in filed of philosophy and politics. Phenomenological terms like existentialism, morality and dialects are explained via Sartre’s critical approach. The last part of the paper will tend to highlight some crucial critiques on his writings by prominent scholars of 19th and 20th century.\n\nThe study “Sartre’s Theory of Temporality in Being and Nothingness in Anglo-American Academic Discourse” presents in some detail Sartre’s ideas of time in his magnum opus Being and Nothingness ( L’Etre et le neant , 1943). The topic is dictated by the fact that these ideas have not been fully discussed by original philosophical literature in Anglo-American academia (English translations from French are not considered). The essay details three topics. The first, introductory part outlines the way Sartre’s theory of temporality in Being and Nothingness has or, rather, has not been fully analyzed in the specialized and popular philosophical literature in English. The overview covers some 65 titles on Sartre, existentialism, and phenomenology. The second section delineates Sartre’s theory of temporality in Being and Nothingness . The final part speaks of Sartre’s ideas of time in his literary criticism, namely, in his essay “On The Sound and the Fury : Time in the Work of Faulkner.” Сту...\n\nThe article discusses rationalistic and existential approaches to the problem of existence. The comparison of Sartre&#39;s pre-reflective cogito and Descartes&#39; reflective cogito makes it possible to define how Sartre’s thought moves from the thing to consciousness and from consciousness to the thing. At the same time, in Being and Nothingness Sartre does not only define the existence of the thing in its passivity—which in many respects corresponds to Descartes&#39; philosophy, but also as an open orientation towards consciousness, the latter concept not being fully developed by him. This statement may be regarded as a hidden component of Sartre’s key thesis about the role of the Other in the verification of our existence. The most important factor in understanding this is the concept of the look. Detailed analysis of Sartre’s theses in Being and Nothingness enables us to demonstrate that the concept of the look makes it possible to consider the identity of being-in-itself and be..."
