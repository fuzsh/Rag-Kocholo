IF you were rooting for a reuniting of Sipowicz and his long-lost wife before “NYPD Blue” ends forever in March, get ready for disappointment.

The show’s producers tried to get Charlotte Ross, the actress who played Det. Connie McDowell – aka Mrs. Sipowicz – to come back for a final reconciliation, but she was not available, according to a report on TV Guide Online.

The magazine isn’t sure whether “scheduling problems” foiled the hoped-for reconciliation or rumored bad blood between Ross and “Blue” producer Steven Bochco.

Bochco told a reporter that Ross “turned us down” when asked if she would come back for the finale.

Ross’ manager-husband, Michael Goldman, however, said the shooting schedule was right in the middle of a long-planned family vacation with her new son, born last March.

“She feels bad, but it is what it is,” said the husband.

Ross asked at the end of last season to be let out of the final year of her contract. The move was a surprise for the cast as well as fans.
