        "text": "Charlotte Ross (born January 21, 1968) is an American actress. She is best known for her roles as Eve Donovan on the NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives from 1987 to 1991 for the NBC Daytime programming block, and as Det. Connie McDowell on the ABC police procedural drama series NYPD Blue from 2001 to 2004.\n\nCharlotte Ross’ birth number is 21, 2+1= 3 which is ruled by Jupiter. Her destiny number is 2+1+0+1+1+9+6+8= 28, 2+8= 10, 1+0= 1 which is ruled by the Sun.\n\nAfter graduating from New Trier High School, Ross moved to Los Angeles, which her father opposed. She auditioned for the role of Kelly Bundy in the Fox comedy series Married… with Children but was the producers’ second choice behind Christina Applegate to whom she lost the role, before being cast as Eve Donovan on Days of Our Lives. Four years later, Ross co-starred with Katey Sagal in the television film Violation of Trust (aka She Says She’s Innocent). The year after that, she guest-starred on Married… with Children as one of Bud Bundy’s sexier classmates.\n\nRoss’s run on Days of Our Lives lasted from 1987 to 1991, earning her two Emmy Award nominations. Her other television credits include the musical drama series The Heights (where she sang on the Billboard Number One hit “How Do You Talk to an Angel”), The 5 Mrs. Buchanans, Drexell’s Class, Pauly, Law & Order, Trinity, Beggars and Choosers, Frasier, Savage Land, Jake in Progress, Fall Into Darkness, and A Kiss So Deadly (which reunited with her Days co-star Charles Shaughnessy). She also co-starred in the Lifetime original films Montana Sky and Christmas in Paradise (both 2007). She earned a Gold record in 1992 for her work as a singer on the soundtrack album to The Heights.\n\nRoss also played Connie McDowell in the ABC police procedural drama series NYPD Blue from 2001 to 2004. On February 25, 2003, Ross appeared in an NYPD Blue episode entitled “Nude Awakening”, which featured shots of her buttocks as she prepared to step into the shower. As a result, the FCC fined each of the 52 ABC stations with a $27,500 fine for broadcasting “indecent material” between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. However, on January 4, 2011, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously revoked the fine, stating that the FCC’s enforcement of its indecency rules was “unconstitutionally vague and chilling.”\n\nIn 2006, Ross joined Billy Blanks to co-host a series of Tae-Bo infomercials. In 2011, Ross appeared as Candy in Summit’s 3D film Drive Angry, alongside Nicolas Cage and Amber Heard. From 2009 to 2012, Ross began a recurring role on the Fox comedy-drama series Glee as Judy Fabray, the mother of Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron). She appeared in four episodes. In 2013, Ross began starring in the VH1 sports drama series Hit the Floor. In 2014, Ross passed on an offer to return to Days of Our Lives as Eve Donovan, and her role was recast with Kassie DePaiva because she was too busy with other acting projects. Along with this news, Ross made a guest appearance in the ABC musical drama series Nashville. Later in the same year, she was cast as Felicity Smoak’s mother in The CW superhero series, Arrow.\n\nOn October 18, 2003, Ross married Michael Goldman and gave birth to a child, a son named Maxwell Ross Goldman (whose name combines Charlotte’s and her mother’s maiden names). She and Goldman separated in 2008 but “remain best of friends in raising our son”. She resides in Los Angeles.\n\nFuture of Charlotte Ross in 2021\n\nCharlotte Ross is entering the 54th year of her life, 5+4= 9 which is ruled by Mars.\n\nRoss’ zodiac sign is Aquarius and is ruled by Saturn.\n\n3, 6, 9 are the lucky numbers for Birth Number 3.\n\n2021 adds to 5 which is ruled by Mercury.\n\nAstro Strategist cum Business Astrologer™ Hirav Shah says, “2021 will be a year of completion and transition. It is a time when we need to let go of things that no longer serve their purpose, and hold on to things that have a future. It is a time of cleaning out dead wood, not necessarily for new beginnings. It can be a time when a burden has been taken off her shoulders, and it can be a year of giving of herself.\n\nWishing the ever beautiful and talented Hollywood actress Charlotte Ross a very Happy Birthday."
