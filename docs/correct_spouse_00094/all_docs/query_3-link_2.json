        "text": "Charlotte Ross\n\nGeneral Actor Information Born: (1968-01-21) January 21, 1968 (age 56) Birthplace: Winnetka, Illinois, U.S. Vitals Occupation: Actress]; singer Website/URL: http://www.charlotteross.com Personal/Family Information Series Involvement Appeared on: Married... with Children Character on MWC: Darlene Episodes appeared in: \"Teacher Pets\" (Season 6)\n\nCharlotte Ross (born January 21, 1968) appeared as Darlene, a girlfriend of Bud's, in the Season 6 episode of Married... with Children titled \"Teacher Pets\" She is perhaps best known for her roles as Eve Donovan on the NBC-TV daytime soap opera Days of our Lives from 1987 to 1991, and Det. Connie McDowell on the ABC-TV series NYPD Blue from 2001 to 2004.\n\nCareer[]\n\nAfter graduating from New Trier High School in her hometown of Winnetka, IL, Charlotte moved to Los Angeles, which her father opposed.[1] She tried out for the role of Kelly Bundy on Married... with Children, but was the producers' second choice behind Christina Applegate who she lost the role to, before being cast in the role of Eve Donovan on Days of our Lives. Four years later, Ross co-starred with Katey Sagal (\"Peg Bundy\") in the movie Violation of Trust (aka She Says She's Innocent). The year after that, she guested on Married...with Children as one of Bud Bundy's sexier classmates.\n\nRoss's run on Days of our Lives lasted from 1987 to 1991, earning her two Emmy Award nominations. Her other television credits include The Heights (where she sang on the Billboard Number One hit \"How Do You Talk to an Angel\"), The 5 Mrs. Buchanans, Drexell's Class, Pauly, and Law & Order.\n\nRoss, in her role as Connie McDowell on NYPD Blue. appeared in an episode entitled \"Nude Awakening\", which featured shots of her buttocks as she prepared to step into the shower.[1][2] As a result, the FCC fined each of the 52 ABC stations with a $27,500 fine for broadcasting \"indecent material\" between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. However, on January 4, 2011, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously revoked the fine, stating that the FCC's enforcement of its indecency rules was \"unconstitutionally vague and chilling.\" ABC, Inc., et al. v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 08-0841-ag(L) (2nd Cir.).\n\nIn 2006, Ross joined Billy Blanks to co-host a series of Tae-Bo infomercials. In 2014, Ross passed on an offer to return to Days of our Lives as Eve Donovan, and her role was recast with Kassie DePaiva because she was too busy with other acting projects.[3] Along with this news, Ross made a guest appearance on the ABC musical drama series Nashville.[3]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nOn October 18, 2003, Ross married Michael Goldman and gave birth to one child: son Maxwell Ross Goldman (whose name combines Charlotte's maiden name with that of a restaurant where she and Goldman enjoyed eating). She and Michael separated in 2008 but \"remain best of friends in raising our son.\" She resides in Los Angeles.[4]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nCharlotte Ross at the Internet Movie Database"
