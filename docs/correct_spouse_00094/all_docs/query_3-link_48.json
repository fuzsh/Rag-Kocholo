        "text": "Jonathan Ross became the latest celebrity to fall victim to Send to All on Saturday’s, January 28 episode of Michael McIntyre’s Big Show on BBC One. The 62-year-old TV and radio host entrusted McIntyre with his phone, as he sent a hilarious text to his entire contact book.\n\nUpon looking at Ross’ phone, Michael couldn’t contain his excitement when he discovered a video that The Masked Singer star had created on an app his wife. “I don’t know whether you should open that,” warned Ross, “[This app] films you singing different parts of a song and it puts them together so you’ve done an acapella version of a song. My wife and I have done a couple to send to the kids, however, if you show this then I can never go home again.”\n\nWith that, the video was played in all its glory, showing Ross and wife Jane singing a rendition of ‘Only You’ by Yazoo. The couple have been married since 1988. But who exactly is Jane Goldman and where might you have seen her name before?\n\nRead more: Signs of fibromyalgia and CFS as Jonathan Ross' daughter left in wheelchair\n\nWho is Jane Goldman?\n\nRoss and wife Jane met when she was 16 years old and he was 26. The pair married two years later when she turned 18. They have three children together - Honey Kinney, 24, Harvey Kirby, 27, and Betty Kitten, 29.\n\nJane, herself, is now 50 years old and a screenwriter. Although she began work as a journalist during her teenage years, she eventually ventured into a career in film.\n\nShe has worked on numerous scripts with filmmaker Matthew Vaughan. Together the pair have been involved in Kingsman: The Secret Service, its sequel Kingsman: The Golden Circle, X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass and Stardust.\n\nSolo projects that Jane has worked on include The Woman in Black, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and the 2020 adaptation of Rebecca. She will next work on the script for Disney’s live-action version of The Little Mermaid. For more TV and showbiz stories, subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
