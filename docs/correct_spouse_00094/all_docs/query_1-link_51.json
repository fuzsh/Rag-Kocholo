Matt and his staff continue to recruit and develop world-class talent at Tennessee, and we look forward to seeing the program continue climbing under his leadership.”\n\nThroughout Kredich's tenure at Tennessee, the four-time SEC Coach of the Year guided the Lady Vols to a pair of SEC Championship titles, including the team’s first-ever championship in 2020 followed by a second title in 2022. During the men's 2022 SEC Championships, he led the Volunteers to a second-place finish, which marked their highest finish since 2001. In 2022-23, he coached SEC Swimmer of the Year Jordan Crooks to a national title in the 50 free. Both programs continued to thrive under his direction, as the Vols (7th) and Lady Vols (8th) both finished inside the top 10 at NCAAs for the first time in program history.\n\nKredich and his staff have been instrumental in the development of Crooks. After winning the SEC title in the 50 free as a freshman in 2021-22, the George Town, Cayman Islands, native enjoyed one of the best seasons ever by a Tennessee swimmer in 2022-23. Being recognized by league coaches, Crooks brought home the top conference honor after posting an incredible stretch in the 50 free, winning the event at the NCAA Championships, SEC Championships and Short Course World Championships throughout the season. During SECs, he threw down the second-fastest time in NCAA history at 17.93 effort, becoming only the second swimmer ever to swim under 18 seconds in the 50 free. After bringing home gold in the 100 free and silver in the 100 fly at SECs, Crooks became the first Vol to ever win SEC Swimmer of the Meet, and he was also Co-Commissioner’s Trophy winner as the highest points scorer. At NCAAs, Crooks earned All-America First Team status in seven different events, finishing first in the 50 free, fifth in the 100 fly, tied for fifth in 100 free, fourth in 200 free relay, sixth in the 200 medley relay, sixth in 400 medley relay and seventh in 400 free relay.\n\nSince 2005-06, Kredich has guided Tennessee student-athletes to a combined 82 SEC and nine NCAA titles. The two programs have achieved a comprehensive total of 684 All-American certificates under his guidance, while four different Vols and Lady Vols have garnered five SEC Swimmer of the Year honors with his coaching. A Tennessee swimmer has won the conference’s top recognition in four of the last five seasons.\n\nTennessee student-athletes have excelled in the classroom with Kredich at the helm. Since 2010, the Lady Vols boast 72 first-team Scholar All-Americans and 104 total honorees. As a program, the women have earned CSCAA Scholar All-American Team recognition for 12 consecutive seasons. On the men's side, a total of 61 Vols received Scholar All-American status, with 33 recognized on the first team, since 2012-13. The program has been named to the Scholar All-American Team list during 17 of the 18 semesters under Kredich. During the 2022-23 academic year, the Vols and Lady Vols combined for a program-record six College Sports Communicators Academic All-American selections, bringing the total under Kredich's direction to 13, and Tennessee's 52 SEC Academic Honor Roll recipients and 29 Lady Vols honorees led all SEC swimming & diving programs.\n\nOver the last seven seasons, the Lady Vols have finished fourth or better in the SEC every season, while the Vols have placed inside the top three four times. At the NCAA Championships, the women currently own a streak of five straight top-10 finishes and have achieved the feat 10 times with Kredich at the helm compared to placing inside the top 10 just three times before his arrival. The Vols have posted top-15 finishes at six NCAA meets under Kredich.\n\nBringing in some of the best talent in the world, Kredich has coached 13 Olympians who competed at Tennessee, including two medalists, while several more are set to join the program this upcoming season as freshmen or transfers. In addition, he and his staff have trained numerous athletes who qualified for the Olympics after their collegiate careers.\n\nErika Brown (USA: 2020) – Silver Medalist in 400 Medley Relay, Bronze Medalist in 400 Free Relay\n\nTess Cieplucha (Canada: 2020)\n\nLyubomir Epitropov (Bulgaria: 2020)\n\nMolly Hannis (USA: 2016)\n\nMichael Houlie (South Africa: 2020)\n\nChristine Magnuson (USA: 2008) – Silver Medalist in 100 Fly and 400 Medley Relay\n\nMona McSharry (Ireland: 2020)\n\nMartina Moravcikova (Czech Republic: 2012, 2016)\n\nTjasa Pintar (Slovenia: 2016)\n\nCherelle Thompson (Trinidad & Tobago: 2020)\n\nKira Toussaint (Netherlands: 2016, 2020)\n\nJoaquin Vargas (Peru: 2020)\n\nEllen Walshe (Ireland: 2020)\n\nBrown and Walshe are the only Lady Vols to ever win SEC Swimmer of the Meet during the SEC Championships. The duo along with Christine Magnuson mark the only Lady Vols to receive the Commissioner’s Trophy, which is given to the top points scorer at SECs. Walshe is the only UT freshman to win either award.\n\nBrown enjoyed a breakout performance at the 2018 SEC championships, the then sophomore had a hand in six conference titles: three individual – 50 free, 100 free and 100 fly – and three as part of relays. In 2019, she repeated her performance and became the first Vol, male or female, to win back-to-back SEC titles in three separate events. She continued her incredible streak in 2019-20 as she won SEC titles in the 50 free, 100 free and 100 fly for the third-straight season (as well as winning three more gold medals in relay events), becoming the first woman in SEC history to win the same three events in three consecutive seasons. She set a new American Record in the 100 fly (49.38) at SECs in 2020 and became just the second woman to ever swim sub 46 seconds in the 100 free (45.83), joining Olympian Simone Manual.\n\nThe Charlotte, N.C., native ran her SEC medal count to 23 (18 gold, two silver and three bronze) by the end of her career. Brown earned SEC Swimmer of the Year recognition twice and paced the Lady Vols to their first-ever conference championship.\n\nWalshe exploded onto the scene during her freshman campaign, winning four gold medals at the 2022 SEC Championships (100 fly, 200 IM, 400 IM, 800 free relay). She’s the first swimmer in SEC history to win the 100 fly, 200 IM and 400 IM during the same meet, while her 400 IM time of 4:01.53 marked a school record and was the fastest time ever by an SEC freshman.\n\nMagnuson, who was the American record holder in the 100-meter fly, won two silver medals at the 2008 Olympic Games and finished her college career as a 23-time All-American, four-time SEC champion, SEC Swimmer of the Year, NCAA champion and Olympic Trials champion.\n\nKredich accepted the head coaching position of the Tennessee women's swimming and diving program on April 30, 2005. He joined UT after spending four seasons at Richmond from 2001-02 through 2004-05, when he led the Spiders to the NCAA Championships and won the Colonial Athletic Association championship in all four years. He previously served as the head coach of a combined program at Brown University for nine seasons (1993-2001).\n\nHe was named head coach of the combined Tennessee men's and women's program on April 12, 2012.\n\nYEAR-BY-YEAR RECAPS\n\n2022-23\n\nMEN: SEC Finish: 3nd // NCAA Finish: 7th\n\nWOMEN: SEC Finish: 2nd // NCAA Finish: 8th\n\nFor the first time in program history, both programs earned top-10 finishes at the NCAA Championships during the 2022-23 campaign. The Vols finished seventh at the NCAA Championships, marking the program’s best finish since 2016, and placed third at SECs. The Lady Vols took second at the SEC Championships followed by an 8th-place finish at NCAAs, marking the sixth year in a row in which the group ended the season inside the top 10 nationally.\n\nThe men’s team was led by the duo of SEC Swimmer of the Year Jordan Crooks and SEC Diver of the Year Bryden Hattie. Crooks etched his name into history this year by winning the 50 free title at the NCAA Championships, SEC Championships and Short Course World Championships. During SECs, he threw down the second-fastest time in NCAA history at 17.93 effort, becoming only the second swimmer ever to swim under 18 seconds in the 50 free. The sophomore earned SEC Swimmer of the Meet and was a Co-Commissioner’s Trophy winner after taking four gold medals at the conference championships and hauling in first team All-American recognition in seven different events at NCAAs. Hattie, who won SEC Diver of the Meet and was also a Co-Commissioner’s Trophy winner, earned All-America First Team recognition on 3-meter and platform. Thanks to a list that included four dives scoring for 80-plus points, the junior was the national runner-up on tower. During the SEC Championships, he enjoyed a monster week on the boards, bringing home a pair of gold medals on platform and 3-meter and winning silver on 1-meter. Nick Stone won SEC Freshman Diver of the Year honors after scoring in all three events at SECs and earning All-America Second Team honors on platform.\n\nLeading the Lady Vols, junior Mona McSharry and sophomore Brooklyn Douthwright both won SEC titles and finished as national runner-ups in an event at the 2023 NCAA Women’s Swimming & Diving Championships, which were held at Tennessee’s Allan Jones Aquatic Center. McSharry swept the breaststroke events and took home silver in the 50 free at SECs, and she followed that performance up by placing second overall in the 100 breast and fourth in the 200 breast at NCAAs. Enjoying an impressive sophomore campaign, Douthwright was the SEC Champion and national runner-up in the 200 free. She was also a member of two Lady Vol relays that earned First Team All-America recognition. Fellow sophomore Josephine Fuller earned SwimSwam Breakout Swimmer of the Year honors after earning First Team All-America honors in the backstrokes and winning silver medals in three individual events at SECs.\n\n2021-22\n\nMEN: SEC Finish: T2nd // NCAA Finish: 18th\n\nWOMEN: SEC Finish: 1st // NCAA Finish: 10th\n\nBetween several key returners and the second-ranked recruiting class in the country, the Lady Vols enjoyed one of the best seasons in program history. For the second time in three years, Tennessee won the SEC Championship in dominant fashion, totaling 17 medals won, including seven gold, in front of a home crowd at Allan Jones Intercollegiate Aquatic Center. All 22 members on UT's SEC roster qualified for at least one B final or better. The Lady Vols followed up the performance by posting their fourth consecutive top-10 finish at the NCAA Championships, as the group hauled in 28 All-America honors and five podium finishes. Director of Swimming & Diving Matt Kredich received his fourth SEC Coach of the Year accolade following the campaign.\n\nFreshman Ellen Walshe was named the 2022 SEC Co-Swimmer of the Year and SEC Freshman of the Year for her performances throughout the season. She became the first swimmer in SEC history to win the 100 fly, 200 IM and 400 IM during the same SEC Championships. She won a combined seven medals en route to being named the SEC Swimmer of the Meet and receiving the prestigious Commissioner's Trophy as the top overall points scorer. She ended the season by earning All-America honors in seven events at NCAAs. Sophomore Mona McSharry finished the year on a high note, placing fourth nationally in the 100 breast behind a 57.18 time, which shattered the SEC and Tennessee records in the event. In total, six program records fell during the season.\n\nWith a good mix of veteran leaders along with talented underclassmen, the Vols enjoyed a successful 2021-22 campaign. During the SEC Championships, Tennessee earned its best finish since 2001, tying for second overall behind 10 medals won, with one gold, five silver and four bronze. Throughout the week, six new program records were set in front of the home crowd at Allan Jones Intercollegiate Aquatic Center. After his first night of individual races, freshman Jordan Crooks became a national name. The George Town, Cayman Islands, native exploded onto the scene with his dynamic performance in the 50 free. Winning gold in the event, his 18.53 time shattered the program record, marked the fastest time ever by a freshman and made him the fifth-fastest person ever in the event. His week was just getting started, as he proceeded to win two more medals in the 100 free (silver) and 100 fly (bronze) while setting the program record in both events. His 100 free time of 41.44 also stood as the fastest mark ever by a freshman in NCAA history.\n\nThanks to his performances at NCAAs, Crooks was tabbed the SwimSwam Breakout Swimmer of the Year after taking third in the 50 free and fifth in the 100 free to earn All-America first team honors. He was the lone freshman to compete in either event. Sophomore Bryden Hattie placed third nationally on the platform after finishing second in the event at SECs. He posted a score of 418.70 in the finals to earn first team All-America status. A total of 17 All-America honors were earned throughout the week by nine different Vols. Five swimmers received the status in multiple events. Tennessee finished on the podium in four events.\n\n2020-21\n\nMEN: SEC Finish: 3rd // NCAA Finish: 20th\n\nWOMEN: SEC Finish: 5th // NCAA Finish: 10th\n\nThe 2020-21 season brought many challenges outside of the pool with the navigation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite that, the Vols earned their second top-3 finish in three years at the SEC Championships. Junior Lyubomir Epitropov won gold in the 200 breast while breaking the school record in the event. Junior Michael Houlie won silver in the 100 breast with a school record time and also brought home the bronze in the 200 breast. Bryden Hattie won SEC Freshman Diver of the Year after winning gold on the platform. Seven Vols earned 11 All-America honors for the season.\n\nOn the women's side, the Lady Vols lost several major contributors from the previous due to graduation. While they didn’t finish as high as previous years at SECs, the squad rallied at the NCAA Championships to earn their third-straight top-10 finish. Sophomore Kristen Stege shined in her first season on Rocky Top, winning gold in the 1650 free and silver in the 500 free during the SEC Championships. Becoming the school record holder in the event, Stege went on to finish fourth nationally in the event. SEC Freshman of the Year Mona McSharry exploded onto the scene, winning silver in the 100 breast at SECs before going on to place fourth in the 100 and 200 breast at NCAAs and setting the program record in both events. The Lady Vols had 11 swimmers earn 28 All-America certificates for the year.\n\n2019-20\n\nMEN: SEC Finish: 6th // NCAA Finish: N/A - The 2020 NCAA Championships were canceled due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) global health crisis.\n\nWOMEN: SEC Finish: 1st // NCAA Finish: N/A - The 2020 NCAA Championships were canceled due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) global health crisis.\n\nThe 2019-20 season proved to be a special one as both the men's and women's teams had spectacular dual meet seasons, capped off by the women's team winning their first-ever SEC Championship. The women's squad finished the year undefeated at 8-0, just the third undefeated season in program history and the first since 1972-73. The men went 7-1 on the year and finished with their best record since 2001-02.\n\nAt SECs, the Lady Vols won 11 total medals en route to their SEC title while Erika Brown set an American Record in the 100 fly and three-peated in the 50 free, 100 free and 100 fly, becoming the first woman in SEC history to win the same three events in three consecutive seasons. Meghan Small won her third SEC title in the 200 IM, just the third woman in SEC history to do so.\n\nThe men's team brought home four medals from SECs and saw a number of underclassmen swimmers score at the championship meet.\n\n2018-19\n\nMEN: SEC Finish: 3rd // NCAA Finish: 11th\n\nWOMEN: SEC Finish: 4th // NCAA Finish: 8th\n\n2018-19 saw another remarkable season from Erika Brown as she became the first Vol, male or female, to win back-to-back SEC titles in three separate events and claim six more SEC Championships (three individually and three on relay teams). The year also witnessed the Lady Vols adding to their relay history as Meghan Small, Nikol Popov, Madeline Banic and Brown brought home an NCAA title in the 200 Medley Relay. As a team, Tennessee finished in the top 10 for the second consecutive year.\n\nRedshirt senior Zhipeng (Colin) Zeng earned CSCAA National Diver of the Year honors for a second time en route to capturing his second NCAA title with the Vols and his first in the 1-Meter Springboard.\n\n2017-18\n\nMEN: SEC Finish: 4th // NCAA Finish: 11th\n\nWOMEN: SEC Finish: 3rd // NCAA Finish: 7th\n\nThe 2017-18 season was marked by the grand emergence of Erika Brown onto the national college swimming and diving stage. The sophomore won six gold medals at the SEC Championships, including three individual (50 freestyle, 100 freestyle, 100 butterfly). She took second at the NCAA championships in both the 50 freestyle and 100 butterfly and set four school records. As a team, Tennessee rebounded back into the top 10, powered by a sophomore core that also included Meghan Small, Tess Cieplucha and newcomer Stanzi Moseley.\n\nRedshirt junior Zhipeng (Colin) Zeng earned CSCAA National Diver of the Year honors en route to capturing Tennessee's first NCAA men's platform title. He also took fourth on 1-meter and second on 3-meter. The Vols set six new program records with junior Kyle DeCoursey taking ownership of the 50-yard freestyle (19.12 seconds).\n\n2016-17\n\nMEN:SEC Finish: 6th // NCAA Finish: 20th\n\nWOMEN: SEC Finish: 4th // NCAA Finish: 22nd\n\nWith the SEC championships back in Knoxville for the first time since 2012, Tennessee claimed two individual women’s titles. Madeline Banic scored an upset victory in the 50 freestyle in a school-record time of 21.54 and was later third in the 100 butterfly. Freshman Meghan Small won the 200 IM and was third in the 200 backstroke. Small broke three school records during her first year on Rocky Top in the 200 IM, 400 IM and 200 butterfly.\n\nJunior diver Liam Stone led the Vols through the postseason once again. He broke the SEC record to clinch the 1-meter title (468.30) and took bronze on 3-meter. He took fourth in both springboard events at NCAAs and was named SEC Diver of the Year. Sophomore Kyle DeCoursey had a breakout year in the sprint events, taking third at SECs in the 100 freestyle in a school record 42.07.\n\n2015-16\n\nMEN:SEC Finish: 6th // NCAA Finish: 7th\n\nWOMEN: SEC Finish: 2nd // NCAA Finish: 13th\n\nThe Vols placed seventh in the NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships to end the season. It was the best NCAA meet for the Vols since taking third in 2001 and was the first top-10 finish for the program since 2009. Sophomore Liam Stone became the first Vol in 12 years to win an NCAA title, capturing the 1-meter springboard title with a score of 453.70. Sophomore Peter John Stevens took second in the 100 breaststroke, and senior Sean Lehane earned seven All-America honors at his final NCAA meet.\n\nThe Tennessee women matched the best conference finish in program history, taking second at the SEC Championships. The Vols' relay team of Kira Toussaint, Madeline Banic, Harper Bruens and Faith Johnson captured three SEC relay titles. Johnson finished her conference career with seven SEC titles, tying for the most in UT history. Rachel Rubadue won the SEC platform title and was named the SEC Freshman Diver of the Year. The Vols send 15 competitors to the NCAA meet and placed 13th overall.\n\nAfter the season, Toussaint made the Netherlands' Olympic team in the 100 backstroke. At the U.S. Olympic Trials, Molly Hannis earned a spot on Team USA with a second-place finish in the 200 breaststroke; she was also third in the 100 breaststroke. Lehane qualified for the trials finals in the 100 and 200 backstroke.\n\n2014-15\n\nMEN:SEC Finish: 4th // NCAA Finish: 14th\n\nWOMEN: SEC Finish: 4th // NCAA Finish: 11th\n\nMolly Hannis led the Tennessee women throughout her final collegiate season. At the SEC meet, she earned two more silver medals in the breaststroke events and also helped Tennessee win the two medley relays.

The year marked a real youth movement for the men's teams with six swimmers or divers earned All-America honors for the first time.\n\nAt the SEC meet, the men's and women's teams improved placement from the year before, both finishing fourth in the standings. Two newcomers enjoyed their breakout performances at the meet. Sam McHugh made the championship final of his three events, taking silver in the 200 butterfly. Liam Stone, who joined the team at midseason, won the 3-meter springboard with an SEC record score of 463.50.\n\n2013-14\n\nMEN:SEC Finish: 6th // NCAA Finish: 15th\n\nWOMEN: SEC Finish: 5th // NCAA Finish: 7th\n\nThe remarkable ends to Lindsay Gendron's and Tori Lamp's careers highlighted the 2013-14 season for the Tennessee women's squad.
