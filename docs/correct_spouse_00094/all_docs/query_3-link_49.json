I am Russian,\n\nbut not solely. My roots\n\nare Ukraine and Romania.\n\nI do not believe\n\nin Mother Russia\n\nwho eats her neighbors\n\nand exiles their children.\n\nWhen we came home\n\nto our apartment\n\nin Athens it was fifteen\n\ncelsius. I went to the beach\n\nthree days in a row to lie\n\nin the sun. That was two weeks\n\nago and I have been sick\n\never since. I am five feet tall\n\nthin as a rail. I speak seven languages.\n\nI have a daughter and a dog.\n\nMy name is Anna.\n\nWhat’s yours?\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWhy Vladimir Putin will die from periodontitis\n\nIf you were his dental hygienist\n\nyou would say\n\nhe has no pockets\n\nno bone loss\n\ngood color and adhesion\n\nignoring the blood\n\nif you want to keep\n\nyour extra privilege\n\nand perhaps in the back of your soul\n\nfeel some solidarity with ex-soviets\n\nwho Russia keeps trying\n\nto put back in her mouth\n\nto fill gaps where her tongue\n\nkeeps incessantly exploring\n\nit is this obsession\n\nhe can’t stand\n\nthough it is all a lost cause\n\nand whatever you say\n\nwill fall on welcome ears\n\nas long as it is not the truth.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWorking at the UN International Crime Tribunal\n\nafter The Croatian War\n\nI want justice served\n\nBut I cannot translate\n\nWith my eyes full of tears.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRemnant\n\nStatue of Lenin on an armored car pedestal, Finland Station, St. Petersburg\n\nIn this way you will be liberated\n\nfrom yourself, fall\n\nin service to squares, steel and gunsights.\n\nThe unconvinced will be riddled,\n\nremoved, and renounced, and I\n\nwill stand here in frozen proclamation,\n\nmy own ideal, a tiny triumph over\n\nthe failure of history to be merciful.\n\n.\n\n."
