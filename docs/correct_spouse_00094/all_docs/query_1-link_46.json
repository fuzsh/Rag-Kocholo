        "text": "Mathias Enard is one of my favourite contemporary authors after having read and loved two of his books – Compass and Tell Them of Battles, Kings & Elephants. I’ve yet to read his much celebrated work Zone, but decided to pick up his latest work instead…\n\nEnard’s The Annual Banquet of the Gravediggers Guild is a dazzling feat of the senses, a brilliant novel of rural life, violence and death, love and revelry, agriculture and anthropology, reincarnation and the afterlife.\n\nThe novel comprises seven sections but is arranged in a circular structure that begins and ends with an anthropologist’s journal entries, enveloping a third-person narrative that is the hallmark of Enard’s rich, dense, immersive prose style, that in turn surrounds the novel’s central feature, the icing on the cake, which is the banquet or the feast that gives the novel its name.\n\nSet in the marshlands of Deux Sevres, a village called La Pierre-Sainte-Christophe in Western France, the book begins with the diary jottings of David Mazon, an anthropology student, who has set up a temporary base in the area as part of the fieldwork for his thesis on agrarian life. David has been given lodgings in an annex owned by the farmer couple Gary and Mathilde, naming it The Savage Mind. Calling his diary a field journal of sorts, David begins to explore the region and its people thereby introducing the reader to an eccentric cast of characters. Through him we meet the other inhabitants of the village – Marcel Pouvreau, the village mayor and also head of the gravediggers association; Tubby Thomas, manager of the bar Café-Pêche; Maximilian, an artist with a penchant for creating grotesque artworks whose relationship with Lynn the hairdresser ends abruptly following her discovery of his paintings the vulgarity of which shocks her.\n\nMeanwhile, David is also introduced to Lucie, an activist cum vegetable farmer, who separated from her partner, is now living in her ancestral home with a considerably aged and addled grandfather and her simple-minded cousin Arnaud whose extraordinary ability to remember historical dates astonishes David. Cocky, spirited, and comical with a “talent to pick up new skills”, David immerses himself headlong into laying the groundwork for his research – setting up meetings with the locals, going about the village on a tattered moped lent by Gary to understand the geography of the region, even trying his hand at hunting all the while aware that he has barely made much progress in his work.\n\nThe distractions and disappointments are many – evenings spent in the Café-Pêche are nothing but a fertile ground for village gossip and revelry, pinning down Lucie for a chat is a challenge given how often she ditches him, and a promising meeting with Lucie’s grandfather who has stayed in the region longer than most leaves him thoroughly frustrated as the wild ramblings of the old man seem utter gibberish. Despite periods of despondency at his dwindling career prospects, his long-distance relationship with a woman in Paris, and his thesis mentor pushing him to get on with it, David finds himself drifting further away from his work yet enthusiastically becoming enmeshed in village life.\n\nTold from a first-person perspective, the tone of this section is often funny as we are taken inside David’s mind and the way he perceives and interacts with the villagers, his girlfriend, and even the army of ants and insects in his room whom he single-mindedly tries to kill with bleach unaware of their past and future reincarnations sprung from the Wheel of Life, that potent force which forms the central premise of the novel.\n\nMarked by a significant shift in tone and narrative style, in the second section we move into classic Enard territory; deliciously long, looping sentences encompassing a kaleidoscope of stories that lurch backward and forward in time, a spellbinding narrative that delves deeper into the troubled pasts of the characters and the violent history of the region displaying Enard’s considerable wit and erudition. More importantly, the Wheel of Life comes to the fore as the pulse of the novel where death and the afterlife rule the roost as the souls of humans are randomly hurled into the past or the future either as humans, notable historical figures, insects, or even wild beasts. Thus, the pious priest Father Largeau troubled by his desire for Mathilde in his present life dies and becomes a wild boar in his next reincarnation merrily mounting a sow and creating chaos for a couple of gendarmes; Tubby Thomas, the bar owner, in his previous reincarnation was a bug that feasted on the blood of Napoleon Bonaparte; while the soul of Lucie’s great-grandfather Jérémie who commits suicide, travels to the past entering the body of the French warrior and poet Agrippa.\n\nThéodore Agrippa d’Aubigné will make work for the gravediggers, he will revel in battle, kill with pleasure, loot and plunder, besiege fortresses, villages and farms, blindly following the dark path of his previous incarnation, despite the schooling and his books: he and his henchmen will raze the hamlet where Jérémie will later hang himself in a violent fury, without realizing that all things are connected and that evil perdures, that it settles in the soul with each transmigration like silt upon a riverbed…”\n\nIn this section and the next, Jérémie Moreau and his wife Louise’s (parents of Lucie’s grandfather) tragic story forms the kernel of the book, a tale filled with violence, abuse, frustrated hopes, deceit, and revenge. We learn that Lucie’s grandfather is the illegitimate son of Louise Moreau born out of wedlock when Louise is raped. Her father, filled with shame, marries her off to a hardworking but penury and violent farmer called Jérémie Moreau who detests his stepson and yearns to have a son of his own, tormented by the ridicule that will rain on him should he fail. Every time Louise is not pregnant, Jérémie’s rage explodes and he vents his frustration by beating her badly. Little wonder then, Louise longs to get away from him as far as possible, even contemplating suicide but a dash of deceit combined with the approaching rumblings of war forcing Jérémie to join the front, offers Louise a sliver of light, a respite that unfortunately proves short-lived. Meanwhile, Lucie’s grandad witnesses his stepfather dangling from the ceiling with a rope around his neck and a toe protruding from his torn sock, and with his mother also no more, Lucie’s grandfather suddenly becomes an orphan at a young age, a status that only intensifies his travails.\n\nBut while the Wheel of Life incessantly turns and recycles the souls of living creatures including humans into the past or the future and Death plays such a central role in these proceedings keeping the gravediggers on their toes, for three days every year they are gifted an interlude.\n\n“The long-faced gravediggers chatted as they got drunk, they talked about the Banquet, which would take place soon, in three months, in the spring, as it had been every year since the creation of the world, where they would have a few laughs, drink dry and eat hard, and for three days there would be no corpses, because, as is well known, no one ever dies during the Banquet of the Gravediggers Guild, for this is the Grim Reaper’s gift to the Guild, these three days’ repose, these revelries far from death are the Christmas of the baleful, the feast of Saint Nicholas for the men with long faces. Three months may seem like a long time but, for the gravediggers, winter was a season of impatience, when they drank more than usual, because of the cold, because the coffins’ handles were frozen, the marble icier than usual, and the earth difficult to dig even with the little bulldozer that was their only plaything, so they warmed themselves with the thought that the Banquet was approaching and everyone would come – the gravediggers, the cemetery keepers, the undertakers in their black ties, the drivers of luxury hearses – that the ritual words would be spoken and they would fall to feasting and drinking, telling tales and philosophizing, and for two nights they would forget that the Wheel was turning and that every human would one day end up on their shoulders, since none escapes it: whatever becomes of the subtle body, the body is always delivered into the hands of the gravediggers.”\n\nDuring these three days, Death retreats and takes a backseat, as the gravediggers’ guild congregate for a mammoth feast, an annual affair, that sees them engage in fierce debates, lightning-fast repartees, lewd jokes and bonhomie, revelry and utter mayhem, doused in an unending flow of French wines and gorging on an array of entrees, fish, meats, cheeses and desserts. From arguments put forth to include women at the gravediggers’ banquet to shifting towards environment friendly coffin technology and funerals, the gravediggers engage in heated discussions rendered in a playful use of puns and risqué rhymes.\n\n“Pizzlebeer, you’ve raised my dander. Your spineless words are naught but slander! ‘Tis you that needs a dose of formol! A pint, I think, no! A whole bowlful! That might verily bung up your blowhole! Do you realize how much we’d lose? That formol is not mere perfuse? Embalming’s how we earn our keep – ban formol and four boards are cheap!”\n\nInterspersed with mouthwatering descriptions of food and wines, the heady aromas and intoxicating flavours, are speeches made by the gravediggers – an amalgam of clamorous debates, songs and poems, retellings of myths and fairytales focusing on the themes of desire and romantic love. As an ode to the French writer François Rabelais, the tonal quality and narrative style is once again unique and different from what we’ve read thus far – it’s a section that brims with ribaldry and bawdy humour where Enard uses exaggeration, absurdity, and wordplay while depicting the interactions between these larger-than-life characters. There’s plenty of irreverence and intellectual depth here, and a mastery of language that shines a spotlight not only on Enard’s class as a writer but also on Frank Wynne’s skills as a translator.\n\nAmbitious and riveting in terms of scope and content with its evocative portrayal of the French marshlands, The Annual Banquet of the Gravediggers’ Guild explores myriad themes such as the recurring cycles of violence across centuries as history repeats itself, the looming spectre of death that sparks a celebration of life, the joy of language, embarking on new ventures, and the possibility of love.\n\nIn terms of setting and subject matter, The Annual Banquet of the Gravediggers’ Guild could not have been more different than either Compass or Tell Them of Battles, Kings & Elephants; the former is rooted in the French rural countryside, the latter two are drenched in the aura of the Orient, and yet Enard deftly lets some of the mystique of the East seep into The Annual Banquet too particularly through the dreams and visions of Arnaud in the later pages as he sits beside Lucie’s grandfather staring at the fire.\n\nIn a nutshell, then, The Annual Banquet is a richly detailed, intricately crafted literary feast with its exhilarating range of styles, forms, and voices, garnished with Enard’s trademark historical and literary references that make his books such a pleasure to read."
