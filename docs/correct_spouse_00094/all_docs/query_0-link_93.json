The structure was originally built in 1864 on the property of James Ross.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nCarol Winograd (President)\n\nSteve Price (Vice President/Executive Producer)\n\nAllan Casalou (Vice President/Treasurer)\n\nAlex Ross (Vice President/Business Manager)\n\nEllen Goldman (Secretary)\n\nStephanie Ahlberg, Michael Cohen, Mark Friedlander, Maureen Kalbus, Dee Kordek, & Vic Revenko\n\nCo-Production\n\nRoss Valley Players is interested in co-producing events with other organizations.

We invite the participation of an evolving and expanding community. We provide an open, collaborative environment in which to learn and develop theatre crafts. We honor and sustain our legacy as a flourishing cultural resource, and pursue the excitement and promise of the future through the transformative power of storytelling.\n\nOur History\n\nRoss Valley Players was founded by Beth Lloyd and a small group of women in 1930 as a way to escape the hardships of the Depression. After first performing in various indoor and outdoor venues, including the Mount Tamalpais Amphitheater, the Kittle estate offered the group a large red barn in 1939. The land on which the barn stands is now part of the Marin Art and Garden Center. Originally owned by James Ross, for whom the town of Ross is named, the land was settled by Ross’s daughter and her husband George Warn.\n\nThe barn was originally built in 1864 and then fell into disuse, and was far from performance ready. Jumping at the chance for a permanent home, the actors and staff cleaned out hay lofts, removed farming equipment, constructed a stage, bathrooms, seating area, and added lighting. Their first performance in their new home was a staged reading of Life With Father in 1940.\n\nOur Present\n\nRoss Valley Players offers a main stage season with four plays, and one Ross Alternative Works (RAW), an original play by a local playwright, for a total of 34 weeks of live theatre annually. Our actors, design staff, directors, production managers, and volunteers come from all over the Bay Area and we welcome newcomers with open arms. We are proud of our many awards and nominations. Among others, our productions have been nominated by Dean Goodman, the Bay Area Theater Critics Circle (BATCC), and most recently the Theatre Bay Area (TBA) Awards.\n\nJoin our Mailing List\n\nNon-Profit Status\n\nRoss Valley Players is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Your tax-deductible donations are gratefully accepted. All members are acknowledged by category in the program for each show. Join the Ross Valley Players and help us keep live theatre alive and thriving in Marin."
