        "text": "NMSU Teaching Awards\n\nThe criteria for teaching awards at NMSU are those that are explained by the University of Oregon at the links below:\n\nInclusive\n\nEngaged\n\nResearch-informed\n\nWesthafer Award for Excellence in Teaching\n\nThe Westhafer Award is presented in alternating years for excellence in teaching or in research and creative activity. The Westhafer is presented in memory of Robert L. Westhafer, Professor in Mathematical Sciences from 1946 to 1957. The Westhafer is the highest award at NMSU for teaching or for research and creative activity.\n\nAll NMSU faculty on Las Cruces campus who have worked here ten years, are in good standing with the university, and devote a portion of their time to teaching are eligible to apply, including full-time, part-time, and temporary faculty. This lifetime honor is granted only once per candidate. Candidates apply directly to the Provost's Awards Committee that makes the decision.\n\nWesthafer Award for Excellence in Teaching recipients beginning in 1981.

Roush awards are named for a former New Mexico State University executive vice president in recognition of his 35 years of helping to improve teaching in New Mexico. Any faculty who teaches is eligible for these awards, including tenure track, college track, and temporary faculty, as long as they have not won the award in the previous four years and are in good standing with the university.\n\nThe college-level Roush awards are decided based on input from students and department heads, with the selection made by deans and community campus directors (one college-level award winner for each college and two for the College of A&S—9 in total). College-level award winners compete for two university-wide awards and one community college award by submitting applications to the Provost’s Awards Committee that makes the decision.\n\n2023\n\nDavid LoConto, Sociology\n\nPaola Bandini, Civil Engineering\n\nKim Lopez Gallagher, Government, History and Philosophy (NMSU Alamogordo)\n\n2022\n\nMarija Dimitrijevic, Criminal Justice\n\nDerek Chase, Creative Media\n\nJiming Chu, DACC Sciences Program\n\n2021\n\nAnne Semrau, Biology, NMSU Grants\n\nMartha Desmond, Fishery and Wildlife Sciences\n\nAvis James, Biology\n\n2020\n\nJohn W.
