But a lifetime of traveling back and forth to France whenever he could, or even nowadays just viewing French tv directly from France on an Android mobile device has been extremely satisfying, so he would encourage current students to just go ahead and study whatever interests them the most.\n\n2013 Updates: Ryan Martinez ('05) - Ryan is now in his third year teaching French and is lucky enough to be teaching upper level students. At the moment, he's trying to teach his level 4 students how to express themselves both orally and in writing, while also broadening their cultural perspective. To do so, they're doing a unit called \"Immigration: enrichissement ou perte d'identité culturelle?\" So far they've touched upon l'affaire du voile, the FN, personal and national identity, as well as a host of other topics. It's a lot to encompass and organize, but the discussions have been very enriching. Many of his students are immigrants themselves and have commented on how great it is to be talking about issues that are both enlightening and also relatable to their own experience.\n\n2012 Updates: Joanna Sprout ('12) is currently a teaching assistant in Toulouse, France where she is living with her host family.
