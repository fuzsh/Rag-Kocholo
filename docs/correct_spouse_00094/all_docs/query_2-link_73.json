Ada has been a CPA practicing at local firms for 15 plus years. Her experience includes working with high net-worth individuals and their related trusts, as well their businesses set up as corporations and partnerships.

I work with successful business owners and families that want to live comfortably on their accumulated wealth, and pass those assets and values on to the next generation. For example, most business owners are laser-focused on growing their business but don’t have enough time to ensure their familial financial goals are met and portfolio is firing on all cylinders. At Exencial we’ve developed a unique process called E3 to take the stress and complexity of family finances and translate them into strategies for success that can help our clients spend their time and energy on the parts of life that they find meaningful. In our experience these solutions radically reduce the amount of time and mental energy our clients spend worrying about finances and empower them to live the lives of their dreams.\n\nAs for my story, after graduating from the University of Missouri, I began my career at Charles Schwab in Austin, TX. While at Schwab, I assisted retirement plan participants, executives, and business owners optimize their company provided benefits plans while earning my Chartered Financial Analyst and Certified Financial Planner designations. In 2019 I joined Exencial and moved to Oklahoma City to expand my practice and help clients as a fiduciary with wholistic, unbiased advice that can only come from working with an independent firm. I live in Edmond with my wife Selena and son Nicholas, where I’m a member of Rose Creek Golf Club and the CFA society of Oklahoma. If you’re at the point in your life where you need a specialist in investment management, retirement planning, or tax and estate planning, feel free to schedule a call below to see if there’s good alignment between our team and your family needs.\n\nAmi Black recently just joined the investment team at Exencial Wealth Advisors.
