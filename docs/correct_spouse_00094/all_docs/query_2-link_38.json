        "text": "Yearlong program will provide this year’s class of 39 mayors and 78 senior city leaders with management training to strengthen their city halls and deliver results for residents\n\nMayors hail from 27 U.S. and 12 international cities across 11 countries and five continents\n\nNew York, NY – The Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative today announced the eighth class of mayors and senior municipal leaders from their cities who will participate in its yearlong professional management training program. The 2024 class includes 39 mayors and 78 senior leaders from 11 countries across five continents. Established by Bloomberg Philanthropies, Harvard Kennedy School, and Harvard Business School as a first-of-its-kind program to help close the gap in executive development for the public sector, the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative equips mayors and senior city leaders with the tools and expertise to expand their problem-solving capacity, strengthen their city halls, and improve outcomes for residents as cities confront increasingly global challenges. With today’s announcement, the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative will have provided training to 314 mayors and over 540 senior city leaders across 33 countries and six continents since its launch in 2017.\n\n“As national governments increasingly rely on cities to help them achieve their goals, there has never been a greater need for investment in the capacity of mayors and local leaders to do big things,” said Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies and Bloomberg L.P. and 108th mayor of New York City. “Our Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative is designed to help mayors become more effective managers, build strong teams, and learn from the successes of other cities. This diverse class of leaders come from 11 countries, and we’re looking forward to helping them deliver results for the millions of residents they serve.”\n\nA program of the Bloomberg Center for Cities at Harvard University, the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative brings together Harvard faculty, staff, and students, alongside experts from Bloomberg Philanthropies’ global network, to work with the mayors and their senior officials over the course of one year. Through a combination of intensive classroom, virtual, and field-based learnings and offerings, the Initiative helps these leaders bolster their teams’ use of data and evidence, drive collaboration and innovation across sectors, and deliver impact for communities. In addition to the core coursework and convenings with peers, each city is able to access additional offerings, including executive education programs for their economic development, civic engagement, human resources, negotiation, and procurement leads; opportunities to host a Bloomberg Harvard City Hall Fellow for up to two years; and instructional research and materials to help city leaders improve key organizational practices.\n\n“The Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative brings together city leaders from across the nation and the world,” said Harvard University Interim President Alan Garber. “They work with one another and draw on resources from throughout the University to address pressing social problems, improving the lives of millions of people. Part of the Bloomberg Center for Cities at Harvard, the Initiative represents the University’s commitments to advancing rigorous scholarship, to putting cutting-edge research into practice, and to empowering and inspiring leaders to make a difference. I am pleased to join Bloomberg Philanthropies in welcoming our eighth cohort of mayors and senior leaders to the program.”\n\nTo kick off their participation, the 39 mayors joined Harvard faculty and renowned management leaders in New York City for a four-day immersive classroom experience. Two senior leaders from each of the 39 cities will begin their participation in the program in August.\n\nHighlights of the Initiative’s new eighth class of mayors include:\n\nThe mayors come from five continents including Africa (1), Europe (4), Oceania (2), North America (30), and South America (2)\n\nThe mayors hail from 11 countries including Australia (1), Canada (3), Colombia (1), Germany (1), Iceland (1), Italy (1), the Netherlands (1), New Zealand (1), and the U.S. (27), and the first-ever Initiative mayors from Argentina (1) and Kenya (1)\n\n69% (27) are from the United States and 31% (12) are from international cities\n\n49% (19) are from cities with less than 200,000 people, 38% of the mayors (15) are from cities with populations between 200,000 and 1 million people, and 13% of the mayors (5) are from cities with populations over 1 million people\n\nMembers of the eighth class of mayors in the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative are:\n\nAFRICA:\n\nMayor Johnson Sakaja of Nairobi, Kenya\n\nEUROPE:\n\nMayor Matteo Lepore of Bologna, Italy\n\nMayor Martin W.
