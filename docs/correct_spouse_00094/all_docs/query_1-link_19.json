        "text": "IF you were rooting for a reuniting of Sipowicz and his long-lost wife before “NYPD Blue” ends forever in March, get ready for disappointment.\n\nThe show’s producers tried to get Charlotte Ross, the actress who played Det. Connie McDowell – aka Mrs. Sipowicz – to come back for a final reconciliation, but she was not available, according to a report on TV Guide Online.\n\nThe magazine isn’t sure whether “scheduling problems” foiled the hoped-for reconciliation or rumored bad blood between Ross and “Blue” producer Steven Bochco.\n\nBochco told a reporter that Ross “turned us down” when asked if she would come back for the finale.\n\nRoss’ manager-husband, Michael Goldman, however, said the shooting schedule was right in the middle of a long-planned family vacation with her new son, born last March.\n\n“She feels bad, but it is what it is,” said the husband.\n\nRoss asked at the end of last season to be let out of the final year of her contract. The move was a surprise for the cast as well as fans.\n\nStar Dennis Franz, who plays Sipowicz, told reporters earlier this year that her unexpected departure was “a big disappointment” because the show had spent so much time building up their oddball relationship.\n\nEven though Sipowicz and McDowell eventually had a baby together – and they adopted her murdered sister’s baby as well – the writers never resolved what happened to McDowell. She just sort of disappeared from the show under the excuse that she was looking after the couple’s family.\n\nEventually, the producers simply wrote around McDowell’s absence by avoiding any reference to Sipowicz’ home life."
