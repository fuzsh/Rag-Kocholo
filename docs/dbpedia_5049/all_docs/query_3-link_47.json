        "text": "In the past, most of the people were using the left side of the road.\n\nThere was a very plausible reason for this. In the past centuries, it wasn’t possible to know whether someone coming from across the road was an enemy or a friend.\n\nSince people were using mostly their right hands, they were going on the left side of the road and keeping their left safe so that they were able to reach easily to their swords if a danger approaches. Travelling on the left side of the road was formalized first in the 1300s.\n\nThe Pope told the pilgrims to travel on the left side of the road so that they wouldn’t cause any chaos.\n\nThere are countries in the world where traffic flows from both left and right.\n\nHowever, today, nearly in the most of the world traffic flows from the right.\n\nOnly 33% of the world prefers left.\n\nSome of these countries are England, Japan, Australia and South Africa.\n\nNapoleon Effect\n\nIn the late 18th century, there were no driver’s seats in US postal vehicles, and the driver was sitting on the back and on the horse on the left. This made it more difficult to control the road when you used the left side of the road.\n\nSoon the traffic in the US began to operate on the right. During the French Revolution, Maximilien Robespierre, leader of the Revolutionary, demanded that people go from the right side of the road in Paris.\n\nAfter a while, Napoleon, himself a left-handed, commanded his trucks to go right from the roads, and in every country, he occupied he passed on this practice life.\n\nSince Britain could never be captured by Napoleon, the British have not abandoned their habit of using the left side of the road. They continued this procedure in all former colonies, such as Australia and India.\n\nAlready in the British, unlike the Americans, the driver was sitting on top of the car and on the right. With the development of modern car technology, the driver’s seat and steering wheel in the US were appropriately put on the left.\n\nIn Britain and its former colonies, the bill for getting the traffic on the right is so big that they can not easily switch.\n\nYou can see the countries where the traffic flows from the left and the right on the above map. The south of the Africa continent, India, Australia and New Zeland where traffic flows from the left. The whole list is at the bottom of the page.\n\nThe traffic flow from left was provided by Italy in 1300, by the pope Boniface 8th. The vast majority of European countries have subsequently abandoned this rule. But Britain did not change its position.\n\nIn Japan, traffic also flows from the left. Neither Japan nor Britain are satisfied with this system.\n\nIn England, which wanted to adapt to Europe, studies were made in 1960 to change the direction of traffic flow. However, this idea has been abandoned when it turns out that this change will cost billions of pounds.\n\nIn Japan, using left-hand drive vehicles is considered a prestige symbol.\n\nMany Countries Changed\n\nWhile many countries such as Canada, Italy, China, Sweden, USA and Iceland are among those who change the flow of traffic from left to right, the only example that changes the system from right to left is Okinawa.\n\nThe traffic that flowed from the left until 1945 on the Adabas began to flow right during the dominance of Americans until 1972. When the island was given to the Japanese, the flow of traffic was again left.\n\nDriving Standards and How They Changed\n\nFeatures of Right Hand and Left Hand Traffic\n\nFeatures of the Left-Hand Traffic\n\nThe traffic flows from the left, only the right lane can be used to pass the vehicle in front.\n\nThe traffic from the opposite direction is on the right.\n\nMost traffic signs are on the left side of the road where drivers can see.\n\nVehicles turn clockwise as they return from traffic hubs.\n\nWhen the rails cross over, they first look to their right.\n\nThe vehicle’s driver’s seat is on the right.\n\nWhere there is no sidewalk, pedestrians must walk from the right side of the highway.\n\nFeatures of the Right-Hand Traffic\n\nThe traffic flows from the right, only the left lane can be used to pass the vehicle in front.\n\nThe traffic from the opposite side stays on the left.\n\nMost traffic signs are on the right side where drivers can see.\n\nIn the traffic hubs, when the cars turn, they turn clockwise in reverse.\n\nWhen the rails cross over, they first look to their left.\n\nThe vehicle’s driver’s seat is on the left.\n\nWhere there is no sidewalk, pedestrians must walk from the left side of the highway.\n\nList of Countries that Traffic Flows on The Left\n\nAlderney\n\nAnguilla\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\n\nAustralia\n\nBahamas\n\nBangladesh\n\nBarbados\n\nBermuda\n\nBhutan\n\nBostvana\n\nBritain\n\nBrunei\n\nCayman Islands\n\nChristmas Island\n\nCocos Islands\n\nCook Islands\n\nDominica\n\nEast Timor (1928-1976 right)\n\nFalkland Islands\n\nFiji-Grenada\n\nGuernsey\n\nGuyana\n\nHong Kong\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nIreland\n\nIsle of Man\n\nJamaica\n\nJapan\n\nJersey\n\nKenya\n\nKiribati\n\nLesotho\n\nMacau\n\nMalawi\n\nMalaysia\n\nMaldives\n\nMalta\n\nMauritius\n\nMontserrat\n\nMozambique\n\nNamibia (1918)-Nauru (1918)\n\nNepal-Niue-Norfolk Island\n\nNew Zealand\n\nPakistan\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nPitcairn Island\n\nRepublic of Cyprus\n\nSaint Helena\n\nSamoa (2009)\n\nSeychelles-Singapore-Solomon Islands\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSri Lanka\n\nSuriname\n\nSwaziland\n\nTanzania\n\nThailand\n\nTokelau\n\nTonga\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands\n\nTuvalu\n\nUS Virgin Islands\n\nUganda\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited Kingdom Virgin Islands\n\nZambia\n\nZimbabwe\n\nCountries Where the Traffic is Left Hand (by Continent)\n\nAustralia\n\nChristmas Island\n\nCocos (Keeling) Islands\n\nCook Island\n\nFiji\n\nKiribati\n\nNauru\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNiue\n\nNorfolk Island\n\nPapua New Guinea\n\nPitcairn Islands\n\nSolomon Islands\n\nSamoa\n\nTokelau\n\nTonga\n\nTuvalu\n\nAsia\n\nBangladesh\n\nBhutan\n\nBrunei\n\nEast Timor\n\nHong Kong\n\nIndonesia\n\nIndia\n\nJapan\n\nMacao\n\nMalaysia\n\nNepal\n\nPakistan\n\nSingapore\n\nSri Lanka\n\nThailand\n\nAfrica\n\nBotswana\n\nKenya\n\nLesotho\n\nMalawi\n\nMauritius\n\nMozambique\n\nNamibia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSwaziland\n\nTanzania\n\nUganda\n\nZambia\n\nZimbabwe\n\nEurope\n\nAkrotiri and Dhekelia\n\nCyprus\n\nGuernsey\n\nIreland\n\nIsle of Man\n\nJersey\n\nMalta\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nSouth America\n\nGuyana\n\nSuriname\n\nCaribbean Basin\n\nAnguilla\n\nAntigua and Barbados\n\nBahamas\n\nBarbados\n\nBritish Virgin Islands\n\nCayman Islands\n\nDominica\n\nGrenada\n\nJamaica\n\nMontserrat\n\nSaint Kitts and Nevis\n\nSaint Lucia\n\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nTurks and Caicos Islands\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\nOther Islands"
