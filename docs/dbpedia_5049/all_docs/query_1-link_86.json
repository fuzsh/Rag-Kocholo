        "text": "This information applies to left-hand drive vehicles with a gross vehicle mass less than or equal to 4.5 tonnes. It provides guidance information on the eligibility criteria for granting left-hand drive exemptions for vehicle registration.\n\nIt is the vehicle owner’s responsibility to read this information carefully and conform to the requirements.\n\nBackground\n\nUnder South Australian legislation, a motor vehicle must be a right-hand drive. A right-hand drive vehicle is defined as having at least one steering control to the right of the vehicle’s longitudinal centre line. However, it is recognised that the historic character of older vehicles may be compromised by converting them to right-hand drive.\n\nThe Minister for the Department for Infrastructure and Transport has approved the issue of left-hand drive exemptions for lefthand drive vehicles that are 25 years of age or older as of 1 January of the year of vehicle manufacture. The exemption must be obtained as a pre-requisite to these vehicles being granted registration in South Australia.\n\nNote: A left-hand drive vehicle cannot be used to provide passenger transport services (unless the vehicle was being used for those purposes immediately before 17 June 1999 as per regulation 136 of the Passenger Transport Regulations 2009.\n\nEligibility for left-hand drive exemption\n\nTwo types of left-hand drive exemptions are available in South Australia:\n\nSingle trip left-hand drive exemption.\n\nUnrestricted left-hand drive exemption.\n\nSingle trip left-hand drive exemption\n\nThis exemption allows a single nominated trip of a left-hand drive vehicle under given conditions. The use of this exemption is limited to trips related to initial delivery, government inspection, quote, or conversion to right-hand drive and driving to a place for mechanical repair. The exemption cannot be used for road testing or other purposes.\n\nThe driver must carry the exemption in the vehicle at all times and it must be used in conjunction with:\n\nsingle-day registration permit, or\n\ntrade plate, where applicable.\n\nSingle-trip left-hand drive exemption.\n\nUnrestricted left-hand drive exemption\n\nThis exemption allows registration and operation of a left-hand drive vehicle that is 25 years of age or older as of 1 January of the year of vehicle manufacture.\n\nThe driver must carry the exemption in the vehicle at all times and it must be used in conjunction with:\n\nFull or historic registration,\n\nSingle-day registration permit, or\n\nTrade plate, where applicable.\n\nFor the exemption to be issued, the vehicle must meet the requirements on this page and pass both identification and roadworthy inspections undertaken in South Australia.\n\nInspection\n\nNote: an identification inspection must be undertaken and completed prior to a roadworthy inspection being started.\n\nIdentification inspection\n\nInformation about vehicle identity inspections.\n\nRoadworthy inspection\n\nInformation about roadworthy inspections.\n\nCountry inspections can be arranged in regional areas.\n\nA copy of the Import Approval documents issued by the Australian Government Department - Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts must be supplied and retained by the inspecting officer at the time of inspection, in addition to any requested engineering certification.\n\nVehicle modifications\n\nLeft-hand drive vehicles may be modified from their original design and exemptions from legislative requirements for the modification/s may be required. This is for cases where the modifications make a vehicle non-compliant with vehicle standards legislation.\n\nRefer to the requirements and processes on light vehicle modification (685.6 KB PDF)s for guidance and contact Vehicle Standards, as required.\n\nGeneral requirements\n\nThe vehicle must comply with the following requirements, regardless of the year of manufacture, in addition to the requirements in the South Australian Road Traffic Act 1961 and its Regulations.\n\nMirrors\n\nA left-hand drive vehicle must be fitted with both left and right-hand side external mirrors.\n\nLighting\n\nHeadlamps must be fitted with a dipping device to deflect the light projected from the headlamps downwards or downwards and to the left.\n\nFront parking lights must be white or yellow and rear parking lights must be red.\n\nA red rear-facing reflector must be mounted on either side at the rear of the vehicle at right angles to the road surface.\n\nVehicles manufactured before August 1966 must be fitted with either:\n\nRed or yellow rear indicator lamps and white or yellow front indicator lamps, or\n\nA mechanical signalling device on the right-hand side of the vehicle that complies with the requirements of the South Australian Road Traffic (Light Vehicle Standards) Rules 2018.\n\nVehicles manufactured after August 1966 but prior to 1 January 1973 must be fitted with red or yellow rear indicator lamps and white or yellow front indicator lamps.\n\nVehicles manufactured on or after January 1973 must be fitted with yellow front and rear indicator lamps.\n\nFor vehicles manufactured after December 1969, the parking lights must also be on when the headlamps are switched on.\n\nSeat belt and seat belt anchorage\n\nAll seat belts must be fitted in accordance with either the vehicle or seatbelt manufacturer’s requirements.\n\nIf lap-sash seat belts are required to be fitted and the vehicle has insufficient original anchorage points a report from a Light vehicle engineering signatory may be required on the additional anchorage points.\n\nRequirements specific to the year of manufacture\n\nThe vehicle will also need to comply with certain requirements specific to the year of manufacture, in addition to General requirements.\n\nVehicles built before 1 January 1967\n\nThere are no requirements for seat belts to be fitted to the vehicle.\n\nIf seat belts are fitted they must comply with at least Australian Standard (AS) E35-1935 or AS 2596-83 and be fitted correctly.\n\nVehicles built between 1 January 1967 and 31 December 1968\n\nSeat belts for front outboard positions complying with at least Australian Standard (AS) E35 – 1935 or AS 2596 – 83.\n\nLap or lap-sash seat belts are acceptable and must be fitted correctly.\n\nVehicles built between 1 January 1969 and 31 December 1970\n\nSeat belts for all front seating positions complying with at least Australian Design Rules (ADR) 4.\n\nLap-sash seat belts for outboard positions and lap seat belts for the inboard position.\n\nAll seat belts have non-partial engagement-type buckles.\n\nVehicles built between 1 January 1971 and 31 December 1971\n\nSeat belts for all seating positions complying with at least ADR 4.\n\nLap-sash seat belts for outboard positions and lap seat belts for inboard positions.\n\nAll seat belts have non-partial engagement-type buckles.\n\nVehicles built between 1 January 1972 and 31 December 1974\n\nSeat belts for all seating positions complying with at least ADR 4 and 4A for vehicles built after 1 January 1974.\n\nLap-sash seat belts for outboard positions and lap seat belts for inboard positions.\n\nAll seat belts have non-partial engagement-type buckles.\n\nHead restraints for all front outboard seating positions complying with at least ADR 22.\n\nVehicles built between 1 January 1975 and 31 December 1975\n\nSeat belts for all seating positions complying with at least ADR 4B.\n\nEmergency Locking Retractor (ELR) lap-sash seat belts for front outboard positions, lap-sash seat belts for all rear outboard positions, and lap seat belts for inboard positions.\n\nELR seat belts may be single or dual locking.
