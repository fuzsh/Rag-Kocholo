Those driving on the right changed but I fancy it's a passing phase and they will return to the fold.\n\nJohn, Kettering UK\n\nIt's a Roman thing. Riders travelled on the left to keep their sword arm free. So why does everyone else drive on the right? I've heard it's a Napoleonic thing but can't think of any reason why this was ever an advantage.\n\nSeth, Edinburgh UK\n\nI heard it was so that when passing other traffic, your sword arm (generally your right) is next to the oncoming traffic and so you can defend yourself (I have an image of people jousting in stagecoaches). Of course if we drove on the right, both prospective combatants would be inconvenienced by fighting on the weak side - so maybe we Brits just like a good fight? Or perhaps the current arrangement was brought in to end a reign of terror by a gang of left-handed bandits?\n\nTom Chivers, Oxford UK\n\nWe always have, supposedly dating back to the times when, passing other riders on horse-back, we could defend ourselves with our free sword hand (the right) - or presumably offer the hand of friendship. Our European cousins also used to ride on the left until Napoleon decided on a whim to change to the right in order to be different from the hated British. However, even in continental Europe, the trains still keep left. It's not just the Brits who drive on the left. We have that in common with Australians, New Zealanders, Japanese, Indians (I believe) and many others. In fact an interesting further question would be what proportion of the world's population live in countries where driving is on the left. Any answers?\n\nTim Waterfield, Cambridge UK\n\nBecause we have to drive on one side of the road, anyway, there are far more important things to be pondered over\n\nJohn Ness, Glasgow Scotland\n\nIn olden days strangers passed each other on the left so their sword hand (usually the right)was nearest the potential enemy. Passing on the right would leave your left hand side unprotected. This became the normal etiquette when using roads or paths. The question is why are all other countries seemingly more trusting?\n\njohn scott, Nottingham uk\n\nI heard it was something to do with avoiding swords clashing. In the days when people wore swords they wore them on the left hand side of the body, the easier to draw them in case of emergency, the majority of people being right-handed. If people walked/rode on the right the swords would meet in the middle. Hence they travelled on the left and only the hedgerows suffered. This may of course be a complete myth.\n\nTim Green, Bradford Yorkshire, UK\n\nIn an extension to the above answer, the Romans drove on the left so that, when approaching an unknown rider on the road, a horseman would have his sword arm nearest the stranger. Of course, this worked both ways!\n\nSimon Blake, Shrewsbury England\n\nBecause they can.\n\nDavid Vickery, Croydon UK\n\nBecause the Romans marched on the left side of the road, it being to draw a sword tethered to your left side, safely, to attack an oncoming army. Walk on the right side of the road and your body would be vulnerable while you drew the sword....unless you were left-handed.\n\nJonathan Gardner, Fulham UK\n\nIn days of old, when gallant knights fought dragons and saved maidens, they also used to fight each other, usually on horseback. In order that they could use a sword effectively against their opponent, they would have to pass right to right (all good knights were of course right handed!). The custom therefore originated as an essential part of self defence and simply carried over into our present convention for traffic flow.\n\nPete Causer, Paglesham UK\n\nAs John said, the Romans did. This was so their right hand was free for battle. It was the left-handed Napolean who changed the way France rode, and the rest they say is history.\n\nMatt Barton,\n\nNapoleon changed to be different from the British.The rest of Europe changed because Napoleon conquered them and told them to do so.\n\nBrian Robinson, Brentwood Essex\n\nThe real reason for the British driving on the left is that the French drive on the right! Of course the other reason is that in 1939/1940 Britain was not invaded, Czechoslovakia and Holland drove on the left but were forced to change, they never bothered to change back in 1945. It is interesting to note that in Indonesia, an ex Dutch colony, they still drive on the left.\n\nG. Baker, S. Ockendon U.K\n\nNapoleon started using the right hand side of the road to make it look like his armies were marching in the wrong direction.\n\nGareth Williams, Hilversum Netherlands\n\nSeth from Edinburgh asks why does everyone else drive on the right. They don't of course. Most African countries drive on the left, as do India, Australia, New Zealand, most of South East Asia, and I suspect more countries than you care to imagine. Europeans and Americans are the odd ones.\n\nJeremy Reynolds, London\n\nI always thought Napoleon changed to the right-hand side, not only to do the opposite of the enemy (the British), but because he was left-handed himself.\n\nJohn Porter, Huntingdon UK\n\nApproximately 1/3 of the world's population drive on the left. 1/3 drive on the right 1/3 don't have any roads\n\nPaul, Santiago Chile\n\n68 countries drive on the left. 159 on the right. For a comprehensive analysis of who drives which side and why, see www.travel-library.com/general/driving/drive_which_side.html\n\nJohn Rogers, Austin Texas\n\nI was told that it was all to do with getting on your horse. A righthanded person mountys a horse from the horse's left side. This allows the, less skilled, left foot to be put in a stirrup while the rider is still standing on the ground. Once the rider is up on the horse the more adept right foot can find the other stirrup on its own. If you mount from a pavement your horse will be facing to your left and therefore on the righthand side of the road.\n\nCharles Bather, Colchester UK\n\nSo the Romans were in the habit of just walking towards their enemies on the road, were they? The actual reason we drive on the left is due to the fact that most people are right handed. In the days when carriages and carts were the vehicle of choice, the driver relied on a simple lever operated brake bearing on a wheel to slow the vehicle. This necessitated him sitting adjacent to a wheel, and as you get a better view of the road the nearer to the middle you are, the carriage ended up on the left. Napoleon changed a lot of things after the French Revoloution, including the alphabet and the direction of travel, as a way to drive a wedge between the new \"progressive\" France, and the old Bourgoise regime. Unfortunately France vied with England when it came to colonialism at the time, and those countries now driving on the Right are those that had a greater French influence in their makeup.\n\nTim Hampson, Exeter UK\n\nRe the question of why we drive on the left there are several answers about it being because of the Romans. These answers refer to the Romans carrying their swords on their left sides. I always understood that Romans carried their swords on their right side so that, with training, they could draw it without having to move their shield from in front of their body.\n\nJohn, Cockermouth UK\n\nThe British drive on the left because most people are right handed. There is a logic which everyone seem to be missing. The two basic hand functions are gear changing and steering. Most cars in the UK have a manual gear change. Priority must be given to steering as the more critical function in terms of safety. If the car is designed around the driver, then it follows that steering is logically performed by the right hand, with the left performing the less critical function of gear changing, for a right handed person.\n\nEddie, New york USA\n\nBecause it's the law.\n\nMartin Eaglesham, Cheltenham UK\n\nI believe that driving on both the right and the left were seen in the USA prior to the introduction of the Model T, but that Henry Ford decided that drivers would find it easier to cope with changing gear with their right hand, and so contributed to the general adoption of driving on the left.\n\nBrian Gorton, Nottingham, UK\n\nBecause if we drove on the right we would crash.\n\nMark Farrer, Sale UK\n\nMost of this and some more is in Wikipedia, 'Driving on the left or right'. The article warns us: 'Trains often do not operate on the same side of the road as cars do.'\n\nIain Stewart, Sydney, Australia\n\nWe drive on the right because its the right thing to do. Cant get a more straightforward answer than that.\n\nEddison St. Rose, Castries, St. Lucia\n\nA better or additional question is possibly 'why Napoleon decided to change?' And the answer comes from the battlefield norms by which combat started from the left side of the army before moving to the right side. Napoleon changed this to destabilize his ennemies and imposed this norm on roads to mark his supremacy within conquered territories.\n\nEddie, Oxford UK\n\nThe right handed answer is the most popular answer. Next question, \"why are most people right handed?\". Answer, 99.9% of us have the largest portion of our heart in the left chest. Therefore, ones heart is less vulnerable when you fight right handed. Right or left handed, it does not matter, if you are a peaceful person, you are safer to pass on the left. If you are left handed and not peaceful, it is to your advantage to pass on the right. Therefore, the British either trust less or are smarter and experience tells us that these two qualities, trusting less and being smarter, run hand in hand.\n\nBruce Short, Olathe USA\n\nAdd your answer"
