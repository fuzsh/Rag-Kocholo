        "text": "Have you ever thought about why some countries drive on the left side of the road while others drive on the right?\n\nThe answer is tied to history, culture, and even a bit of science.\n\nDriving on the left in a horse carriage? Fight with your right hand!\n\nAbout 35% of the world population drives on the left, and the countries that do are mostly old British colonies. This strange quirk perplexes the rest of the world, but there is a perfectly good reason.\n\nIn the past, almost everybody traveled on the left side of the road because that was the most sensible option for feudal, violent societies. Since most people are right-handed, swordsmen preferred to keep to the left in order to have their right arm nearer to an opponent and their scabbard further from him. Moreover, it reduced the chance of the scabbard (worn on the left) hitting other people.\n\nFurthermore, a right-handed person finds it easier to mount a horse from the left side of the horse, and it would be very difficult to do otherwise if wearing a sword (which would be worn on the left). It is safer to mount and dismount towards the side of the road, rather than in the middle of traffic, so if one mounts on the left, then the horse should be ridden on the left side of the road.\n\nThe trend among nations over the years has been toward driving on the right, but Britain has done its best to stave off global homogenisation. With the expansion of travel and road building in the 1800s, traffic regulations were made in every country. Left-hand driving was made mandatory in Britain in 1835. Countries which were part of the British Empire followed suit. This is why to this very day, India, Australasia and the former British colonies in Africa go left. An exception to the rule, however, is Egypt, which had been conquered by Napoleon before becoming a British dependency.\n\nJapan was never part of the British Empire, but its traffic also goes to the left. Although the origin of this habit goes back to the Edo period (1603-1868), it wasn’t until 1872 that this unwritten rule became more or less official. That was the year when Japan’s first railway was introduced, built with technical aid from the British. Gradually, a massive network of railways and tram tracks was built, and of course all trains and trams rode on the left-hand side. Still, it took another half century till in 1924 left-side driving was clearly written in a law.\n\nWhen cars were introduced in the late 19th century, people continued to drive on the left side of the road. However, with the advent of faster and more dangerous gasoline-powered cars, many countries switched to driving on the right.\n\nThis switch was especially prevalent in countries that were part of the British Empire and achieved independence. The British themselves drove on the left. They still continue to do so.\n\nSome continued on the left?\n\nYes. Ireland, Malta, and India used to be part of the British Empire but still drive on the left. This is because of older driving habits, the cost and inconvenience of switching, and the difficulty of retraining drivers.\n\nNow, why did some countries switch to driving on the right?\n\nThere are several reasons, such as historical events like the French Revolution, where France switched to driving on the right in 1792 to align with revolutionary ideals.\n\nIndustrial Revolution: The late 1700s and early 1800s are closely connected to the rise of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution, which led to modern methods of production and gave the overall production process a boost. The amount of goods being produced could no longer be transported in small carriages that the merchants or traders owned. This is how freight wagons were introduced to the transport system. Freight wagons were large transport containers that needed to be hauled by a team of horses (and later, steam engines). The wagons did not usually have a central driver’s seat and the driver would sit atop one of the horses, on the left side, which would allow him to control the other horses with his right hand. Hence, the wagons naturally moved to the right side of the road, so the driver could have control over the horses and drive properly.\n\nFrench Revolution: The French Revolution created a stark divide between nobility and the commoners. Since the revolution was such a bloody one, much of the nobility had to change their ways of living to blend in with the commoners. In earlier times, the nobility and people with higher status in society would travel on the left side of the road, while the commoners, like the peasants, would travel on the right. During the revolution, the nobility began traveling on the right side so they wouldn’t be singled out and killed.\n\nIn Sweden, the switch to driving on the right in 1967 was driven by the increasing number of cars imported from countries that drove on the right and the need for better road safety. In other countries, the switch was influenced by colonial powers and trade and military alliances.\n\nIs driving on the right actually safer?\n\nThe idea that driving on the right is safer is based on the assumption that most people are right-handed, and it is easier and more natural for them to control a vehicle on the right side of the road. Driving on the right also allows drivers to see oncoming traffic more clearly and reduces the risk of head-on collisions.\n\nStudies have been conducted to look into the relationship between the side of the road on which a country drives and its road safety record. The World Health Organization found that countries that drive on the right side of the road have lower road traffic fatalities compared to those that drive on the left. Another study by the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute found that switching from left to right-hand driving could reduce road traffic accidents by up to 40%.\n\nReally?\n\nNo, we can’t be sure. The side of the road on which a country drives is just one of many factors that can impact road safety. Other factors like road infrastructure, traffic laws, a driver behavior can also play a big role.\n\nThe tradition of driving on the left or the right is largely historical and reflects the influence of early driving practices, imperial powers, and a bit of science. But, whether driving on the right is safer than driving on the left is still up for debate!\n\nA world map and a full list of all countries of the world and the side of the road on which they drive."
