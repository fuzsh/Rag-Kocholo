        "text": "The most fundamental traffic law in any country is whether traffic will follow the principles of right-hand traffic (RHT, or \"keep right\"), in which vehicles travel predominantly on the right side of the road, or left-hand traffic (LHT, or \"keep left\"), in which vehicles keep largely to the left.\n\nLeft-hand traffic rules are followed by roughly 30% of the world's countries and territories and 35% of the global population, including the United Kingdom and many former British colonies. However, the majority of the world's UN-recognized countries, which include 65% of its population and 75% of its roadways, follow right-hand traffic rules.\n\nRight-side traffic vs right-side drive\n\nThe terms right-hand traffic (RHT) and left-hand traffic (LHT) are easily confused with the related terms right-hand drive (RHD) and left-hand drive (LHD). While right-hand traffic indicates the side of the road traffic travels on, right-hand drive refers to the side of the vehicle on which the steering wheel and gas/brake pedals are located.\n\nEarly cars often placed the steering wheel either in the center of the vehicle or on the driving side. This changed with the 1908 Model T Ford, which moved the steering wheel closer to the center of the road to give the driver a better view of oncoming traffic. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit. As such, right-hand traffic countries are dominated by left-hand drive vehicles, while left-hand traffic countries prefer right-hand-drive vehicles.\n\nDespite these trends, vehicles of both right-hand drive and left-hand drive are legal in most countries. Only a few countries, such as Armenia, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, and Taiwan forbid the registration and use of same-side drive (also called \"wrong-hand-drive\") vehicles such as RHD vehicles in a RHT country. In fact, mail trucks, sidewalk sweepers, and other vehicles that benefit from quick access to the sidewalk are often deliberately manufactured with same-side drive.\n\nAncient traffic laws and the shifting balance of left-side driving\n\nIn most countries, traffic laws originated in the era of the horse-drawn wagon, centuries before cars and other motor vehicles became widely available. For example, various states in the US began legally establishing right-hand traffic laws as early as 1792, more than 100 years before mass-produced automobiles arrived on the market.\n\nHistorians are split as to why the US chose right-hand traffic. One prevailing theory is that RHT felt more natural for wagon driversâ€”most were right-handed, so they preferred to hold the reins with their left hand and keep their right hand free to wield a rifle or whip. However, another popular theory holds that the fledgling country simply wanted to do the opposite of England, which followed LHT guidelines."
