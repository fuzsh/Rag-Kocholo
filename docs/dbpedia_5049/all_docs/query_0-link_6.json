You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nLeft hand drive vehicles are more commonly manufactured and available in a broader range of models. This higher availability can translate into a wider selection of vehicles to choose from, ensuring you find the perfect fit for your needs.\n\nIn regions where left hand drive is the standard, LHD vehicles generally retain higher resale values due to their wider demand. This can be an important consideration if you plan to sell or trade in your vehicle in the future.\n\nIf you live in a country where RHD is the standard, driving a right hand drive vehicle can feel more natural and intuitive. The positioning of controls, such as the gearshift and indicator stalks, align with the driver's dominant hand.\n\nThe choice between left hand drive and right hand drive can be traced back to horse-drawn carriages. In medieval times, most people were right-handed, and it was common to sit on the left side of the carriage to have the right hand free for sword fighting or greeting others.\n\nWhile most countries follow either left hand drive or right hand drive, there are a few exceptions. For instance, the United Kingdom drives on the left side of the road but uses right hand drive vehicles, while Australia drives on the left side of the road and uses left hand drive vehicles.\n\nIn conclusion, the choice between left hand drive and right hand drive ultimately depends on various factors such as your country's driving norms, personal preferences, safety considerations, and vehicle availability. By weighing the advantages and drawbacks discussed in this article, you can make an informed decision when purchasing your next car."
