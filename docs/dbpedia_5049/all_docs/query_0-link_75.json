        "text": "Of the sites you mention, there's no good design or usability reason they are left justified. It's probably inattention to design and/or adherence to legacy design.\n\n(FWIW: You don't need a wrapper to center a simple webpage. You can do it with body {width:960px; margin:0 auto;} in the CSS.)\n\nWould anyone feel differently, I wonder: I find a lot of the feel for left-aligned web sites is connected with small, rectangular components. Much like a spreadsheet, that starts off in the top-left corner, and spreads out more strongly in a vertical/downward direction than horizontal/rightward direction. Moreso than small/rectangular elements, I'd expect left-aligned sites being much more text-heavy than colour or imagery based.\n\nThat's the feel on the front page of jenningsbet.com although much less on the front page of betfair.com.\n\nAlthough in both those cases, there seems to be a bunch of subdomain sites linked and what I've checked, after one click on the front page, the design is centered. Bizarre.\n\nOkay I just wanted to add: here are a couple examples after a minute searching:\n\nhttp://www.andythomasphotography.co.uk/\n\nAn odd-one-out left-aligned with MUCH colour and image style, but it turns out obviously very well used, taking advantage of left-alignment.\n\nwww.jrvelasco.com/ A great second example of good left-aligned content.\n\nhttp://www.artflavours.com/ Another beautiful left-aligned design, still full of small rectangular components (but oh-so-beautiful!)\n\nIt seems a common pattern between these three, and probably most GOOD left-alignment is a texture or other background image gradually flowing, unbounded beyond the right side of the screen.\n\nBtw, I had to remove the anchors for the links because I'm new and not allowed including more than 2 urls.\n\nLegacy.\n\nIn the past, the browser treated the top left corner of the page as the origin and built the page from there. On smaller screens, the top left corner of the page will always appear (and thus it's good to make your design built so that you know the user will see it (and thus your navigation) from the beginning rather than risk it being hidden from being on the bottom / off to the side. Left-aligned pages made a good \"foolproof\" way prior to the innovations of responsive design to make the site readable for smaller sizes as well as larger ones.\n\nAs browsers have improved and screen sizes have increased (and responsive design has made this one-size-fits-all approach obsolete), these sites end up showing their age more than others.\n\nFrom a usability perspective, this isn't a big deal except for its effect on a site's reputation -- a user who sees a site that looks older may well assume the site is either out of date or hasn't been maintained in a while, which could affect their willingness to interact with the site.\n\nMost of the reasons for designing a site this way have been rendered obsolete, so unless there's an aesthetic reason to design the site this way, it may just be a sign of a designer that's stuck in their ways."
