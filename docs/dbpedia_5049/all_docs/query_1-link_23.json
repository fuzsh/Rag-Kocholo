Another thing that could be included in this package is the driving rules – especially to those visiting from a right-hand driving country to a left-hand driving (LHD vs RHD) country or vice versa. Left hand drive vs right hand drive is a dilemma that many people cannot wrap their head around.\n\nFirstly , I want to ask two question .\n\n1.What is the RHD, LHD, RHT, LHT mean separately?\n\n1) RHD(Right hand drive):steering wheel on right side, when driving should on the left side.\n\n2)The RHD=LHT(Left hand traffic).\n\n3) LHD(Left hand drive):steering wheel on left side, when driving should on the right side.\n\n4)The LHD=RHT(Right hand traffic).\n\n2.The main Regulations of headlight: ECE,DOT,SAE.\n\nSee the following pictures show:\n\nSome facts about Left Hand Drive vs Right Hand Drive\n\n1）Approximately 35% of the world population drives on the left. The countries that follow the left hand drive rule are mostly old British colonies. It will be a tad shocking for anyone when they visit a country like England, Bangladesh, or Japan from one of the 75% of the countries that adhere to the right hand drive\n\n2）According to one study, the incidence of accidents in countries with lower left-hand driving laws is lower than that of the right-hand drive countries.\n\n3)In Africa, Mozambique – the former Portuguese colony – still retains the driving tradition on the left, although Portugal has shifted to the right hand drive in the 1920s. The reason is that all the bordering countries is a former British colony and is influenced by the British style of driving.\n\n4)Another country in Oceania, Samoa, has also enacted a new law to adapt the South Pacific nations to the left-hand drive to adapt to other East African Community (EAC) countries.\n\n5)For some African countries, Kenya for more specific, left-hand drive vehicles are not allowed except in cases of diplomats from left-hand drive car countries and they want to bring their car. In addition, vehicles with left hand drive used in mining and construction are allowed to circulate.\n\nOptical Display:\n\nLeft Hand Drive: Right Hand Drive:\n\nCountries that Apply The Left Hand Drive vs Right Hand Drive\n\nOriginal article from : https://carfromjapan.com/article/industry-knowledge/left-hand-drive-vs-right-hand-drive/"
