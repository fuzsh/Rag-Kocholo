        "text": "The modern roundabout is a circular intersection with design features that promote safe and efficient traffic flow. It was developed in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and now is widely used in many countries, including the United States, where its use is growing.\n\nAt roundabouts in the U.S., vehicles travel counterclockwise around a raised center island, with entering traffic yielding the right-of-way to circulating traffic. In urban settings, entering vehicles negotiate a curve sharp enough to slow speeds to about 15-20 mph; in rural settings, entering vehicles may be held to somewhat higher speeds (30-35 mph). As vehicles circulate within the roundabout, slow and consistent speeds are maintained by the deflection of traffic around the center island and the relatively tight radius of the roundabout and exit lanes.\n\nSlow speeds help vehicles move smoothly into, around, and out of a roundabout. Drivers approaching a roundabout must reduce their speeds, look for potential conflicts with vehicles already in the circle and be prepared to stop for pedestrians and bicyclists. Once in the roundabout, drivers proceed to the exits they need.\n\nCommon traffic maneuvers at roundabouts\n\nModern roundabouts are much smaller than older traffic circles — also known as rotaries — and require vehicles to negotiate a sharper curve to enter. As a result, travel speeds in roundabouts are slower than speeds in traffic circles.\n\nBecause of the higher speeds in older traffic circles, many are equipped with traffic signals or stop signs to help reduce potential crashes. In addition, some older traffic circles and rotaries operate according to the traditional \"yield-to-the-right\" rule, with circulating traffic yielding to entering traffic.\n\nThe first modern roundabouts in the United States were constructed in Nevada in 1990. Since then, many more have been built, although the precise number is unknown. Roundabouts are much more common in some other countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom and France.\n\nAlthough some states and cities have been slow to build roundabouts, they are gaining more popularity in the United States. Roundabouts are one of the evidence-based safety countermeasures recommended by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nSome states, such as New York and Virginia, have adopted \"roundabout first\" policies requiring that roundabouts be considered a preferred alternative when building new intersections or upgrading older ones if feasible (New York State Department of Transportation, 2011; Virginia State Department of Transportation, 2024).\n\nRoundabouts are appropriate at many intersections, including high-crash locations and intersections with large traffic delays, complex geometry (more than four approach roads, for example), frequent left-turn movements, and relatively balanced traffic flows. Roundabouts can be constructed along congested arterials and at freeway exits and entrances, in lieu of traffic signals.\n\nSometimes space constraints or topography make it impossible to build a roundabout. Geometric design details vary from one site to another and must take into account traffic volumes, land use, topography and other factors. Roundabouts often require more space in the immediate vicinity of the intersection than comparable traditional intersections. However, because roundabouts can reduce delays and queue lengths, they require less space on the approaching roads than comparable intersections controlled by stop signs or traffic signals.\n\nAn intersection with highly unbalanced traffic flows (that is, a very high traffic volume on the main street and very light traffic on the side street) may not be an ideal candidate for a roundabout. The same is true for isolated intersections in a network of traffic signals.\n\nWhile the initial construction cost of a roundabout varies site by site, its maintenance usually is cheaper than for intersections with signals. The service life of a roundabout is significantly longer, approximately 25 years, compared with 10 years for a typical traffic signal (Rodegerdts et al., 2010).\n\nAt traditional intersections with stop signs or traffic signals, some of the most common types of crashes are right-angle, left-turn, and head-on collisions. These types of collisions can be severe because vehicles may be traveling through the intersection at high speeds. With roundabouts, these types of potentially serious crashes are essentially eliminated because vehicles travel in the same direction and at low speeds.\n\nThe vehicle-to-vehicle conflicts that do occur at roundabouts generally involve a vehicle merging into the circular roadway. In the case of multilane roundabouts, conflicts may also occur as vehicles exit.\n\nStudies of intersections in the United States converted from traffic signals or stop signs to roundabouts have found reductions in injury crashes of 72%-80% and reductions in all crashes of 35%-47% (Retting et al., 2001; Eisenman et al., 2004; Rodegerdts et al., 2007).\n\nA study of 19 higher-speed rural intersections (speed limits of 40 mph or higher) that originally had stop signs on the minor approaches and were converted to roundabouts found a 62% reduction in all crashes and an 85% reduction in injury crashes (Isebrands & Hallmark, 2012).\n\nStudies of intersections in Europe and Australia that were converted to roundabouts have reported 25%-87% reductions in injury crashes and 36%-61% reductions in all crashes (Rodegerdts et al., 2010).\n\nBased on the results of a 2004 study (Eisenman et al., 2004), we estimate that the conversion of 10% of the signalized intersections in the United States to roundabouts would have prevented approximately 47,000 crashes in 2022, including 289 fatal crashes and more than 31,000 crashes involving injuries.\n\nMost U.S. studies have focused primarily on single-lane roundabouts. When included, two-lane roundabouts have been associated with smaller reductions in crashes compared with single-lane roundabouts (Retting et al., 2001; Eisenman et al., 2004; Rodegerdts et al., 2007) or with increases in crashes (Isebrands & Hallmark, 2012; Wang & Cicchino, 2022).\n\nA 2019 IIHS study, however, showed that the safety of two-lane roundabouts improves over time, as drivers become more familiar with them (Hu & Cicchino, 2019). The researchers looked at roundabouts built in Washington state between 2009 and 2015. They found that crashes at two-lane roundabouts decreased an average of 9% a year. At the same time, the odds that a crash at a two-lane roundabout involved an evident or incapacitating injury decreased by nearly one-third annually.\n\nIn addition to having fewer serious conflicts between vehicles than traditional intersections, roundabouts are generally safer for pedestrians as well. In a roundabout, pedestrians walk on sidewalks around the perimeter of the circular roadway. If they need to cross the roadway, they cross only one direction of traffic at a time. In addition, crossing distances are relatively short, and vehicle speeds tend to be low.\n\nStudies in Europe indicate that, on average, converting conventional intersections to roundabouts can reduce pedestrian crashes by about 75% (Brilon et al., 1993; Schoon & van Minnen, 1994). Single-lane roundabouts, in particular, have been reported to involve substantially lower pedestrian crash rates than comparable intersections with traffic signals (Brude & Larsson, 2000).\n\nCrossing at multi-lane roundabouts can be more difficult for pedestrians than crossing at single-lane roundabouts. A study found that motorists failed to yield to pedestrians 2-3 times more at multi-lane roundabouts than at single-lane roundabouts (Rodegerdts et al., 2007). Another study found that drivers exiting a roundabout were less likely to yield to pedestrians than drivers entering a roundabout (Hourdos et al., 2012).\n\nDespite the demonstrated safety benefits of roundabouts, some crashes still occur. An IIHS study of crashes at 38 roundabouts in Maryland found that four crash types — run-off-road, rear-end, sideswipe, and entering-circulating — accounted for almost all crashes (Mandavilli et el., 2009). Another common crash type involved a vehicle colliding with the central island. These crashes, which often involved unsafe speeds, accounted for almost half of all single-vehicle run-off-road crashes. Some drivers may not have seen the roundabout in time to slow down sufficiently.\n\nA review of crashes at 39 roundabouts in the United States found that entering-circulating, exiting-circulating and rear-end collisions were the most common crash types (Rodegerdts et al., 2007). A large majority of crashes at the single-lane roundabouts were entering-circulating crashes. At multi-lane roundabouts, the majority of crashes were exiting-circulating.\n\nA review of fatal crashes at roundabouts in the United States and injury crashes at roundabouts in Washington and Wisconsin found that motorcycle crashes, fixed object crashes, and crashes involving impaired driving were overrepresented (Schroeder et al., 2015).\n\nDesign features that encourage drivers to slow down are the key to optimizing roundabout safety.\n\nSigns — including speed limits posted well in advance of roundabouts and larger “roundabout ahead” and yield signs — pavement markings and lighting help make sure drivers know they are approaching a roundabout and therefore need to slow down.\n\nCenter island landscaping can promote slower speeds and focus drivers’ attention on the roadway close to them by limiting their through vision.\n\nIslands separating the approach and exit lanes, known as splitter islands, should extend far enough from the roundabout to provide pedestrian refuge and to delineate the roundabout.\n\nOther design features such as adequate curvature of approach roads far enough in advance of roundabouts and the alignment of approaching roads with the center island also may aid in reducing speeds.\n\nMultilane roundabouts are more challenging. A study of a pair of two-lane roundabouts near Bellingham, Washington, found that confusion about some aspects of navigating the roundabouts persisted one year after the construction ended (Hu et al., 2014). More than 40% of drivers said it wasn’t clear from signs and pavement markings what speed to drive, which lane has the right of way when exiting or that they shouldn’t drive next to large trucks in the roundabouts.\n\nAt multilane roundabouts, signs and pavement marking should remind drivers of the correct yielding patterns and help them choose the appropriate lanes. At two-lane roundabouts, for example, signs need to convey clearly that entering traffic must yield to both lanes of traffic.\n\nThe photos below show sample signs and pavement markings used at roundabouts."
