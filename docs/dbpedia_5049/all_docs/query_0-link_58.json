        "text": "Note - My question is NOT about the Compact view for the left side list of Team conversations.\n\nMy question is for the conversation area itself.\n\nWhy is my conversation fully left aligned versus split between my comments on the right and replies on the left?\n\nWhat it is NOW:\n\nWhat is WAS and what I want back. Just an fyi, my screenshot is from someone else, I had to use their screenshot to get the example. Either way, my comments since I'm making them should be right aligned:\n\n@Dion_Knudtson Yeah, that's weird! There's a suggested remedy in this thread: Why are my messages no longer aligned to the right hand side in Chat - Microsoft Community\n\nI've just actually managed to fix it by setting it to \"Compact\" (which did change the display again), restarting Teams and then setting it back to \"Comfy\".\n\nIf it still doesn't work, you could try:\n\nUpdating Teams\n\nSelect 'Settings and more' (...) next to your profile pic\n\nSelect 'Check for updates' and let it run for a while. It updates in the background\n\nClearing your Teams cache\n\nRe-installing Teams\n\n@Paul_Keijzers hey, it looks like a bug to me. You can see in the screenshot that the chat isn’t displaying properly. It has the speech bubbles of the “comfy” mode but the layout (left aligned) of the “compact” mode.\n\nOther people with the same issue seemed to fix it by setting it to “compact”, restarting Teams, and setting it back to “comfy”.\n\nTry using the browser and see if you get the view you expect, if so it's probably that the Teams client cache needs refreshing. Clear Teams cache - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn\n\nIt happens sometimes. Team is really a hybrid app that pulls down the layouts and sometimes these become incorrect."
