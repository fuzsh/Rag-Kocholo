        "text": "Hi All,\n\nI would be the first to admit that I struggle with maps, GPS is my friend, and I always stop and ask for directions if lost! but I do know left from right and in the UK at least consistently have no trouble keeping to the correct side of the road.\n\nCanada that was a whole different story but I got there in the end and the roads are massive and quiet so my one lapse was quickly corrected, but I had to think really hard to start with! Got used to it in the end though. The 4 way stop sign was also fun! Never seen that before.\n\nSo\n\nIn the UK steering wheel is on the right, and we on the whole keep left, unless passing with the steering wheel in the middle of the road. Otherwise known as Right had drive.\n\nIn Europe, the steering wheel is on the left, and on the whole you keep right, unless passing with the steering wheel in the middle of the road. Otherwise known as Left had drive.\n\nI was reading the manual on the LED intelligent light system, in preparation for my first Mercedes arriving in August.\n\nThe turn of phrase confuses me and I am probably over thinking this too much.\n\nIts written for multiple market and refers to left sided traffic and right sided traffic.\n\nSo\n\nDoes left sided traffic, mean the steering wheel is on the left (i.e Europe) or does it mean you keep left? (i.e UK)?\n\nDoes right sided traffic, mean the steering wheel is on the left (i.e Europe) or does it mean you keep left? (i.e UK)?\n\nSorry if this is a really dumb question, I just canâ€™t make up my mind!\n\nThe message apparently says\n\nIntell. Light System: System inoperative Inactive for left-side traffic\n\nor\n\nIntell. Light System: System inoperative Inactive for right-side traffic\n\nand the setting is described as\n\nRight-side traffic\n\nor\n\nLeft-side traffic .\n\nOne time I will read it and conclude,\n\nInterpretation 1\n\nLeft-side traffic = left hand drive (European)\n\nRight-side traffic = right had drive (UK)\n\nBut then I think do they mean\n\nInterpretation 2\n\nLeft-side traffic = driving and keeping left (UK)\n\nRight-side traffic = driving and keeping right. (European)\n\nI assume Interpretation 1, is correct but I am really not sure and wondered what you thought.\n\nSide makes sense, but the use of the word traffic is ambiguous to my mind and makes me wonder in that context what do they mean by side?\n\nFrom reading the manual I see the car has its default set, but I am just curious to understand what they mean.\n\nThanks\n\np"
