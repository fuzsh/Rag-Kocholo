Notice of a speed limit established under the program may be displayed using a stationary or portable changeable message sign, as defined by Section 544.013.

A new limit that is adopted for a turnpike project constructed and maintained by the authority in accordance with this section is effective at all times or at other times as determined.\n\n(d) The authority's power to alter prima facie speed limits is effective and exclusive on any part of a turnpike project constructed and maintained by the authority inside and outside the limits of a municipality, including a home-rule municipality.\n\n(e) The authority may not:\n\n(1) alter the general rule established by Section 545.351(a); or\n\n(2) establish a speed limit of more than 75 miles per hour.\n\n(f) The authority, in conducting the engineering and traffic investigation specified by Subsection (a), shall follow the procedure for establishing speed zones adopted by the Texas Department of Transportation.\n\nActs 1995, 74th Leg., ch. 165, Sec. 1, eff.
