        "text": "There are many reasons why different countries drive on different sides of the road. The most common explanation is that it has to do with the way that horses pulled wagons in old times.\n\nPeople would walk on the left side of the wagon so they could be closer to the horses and have better control over them. When cars replaced wagons, the habit stuck, and countries continued to drive on the left or right side of the road based on which side their wagons drove on.\n\nAnother explanation is that it has to do with swords. Back in the days when people rode horses and fought with swords, it was considered more important to have your sword arm free in case you needed to fight. So, people would walk on the side of the road with their sword arms free.\n\nThis explanation seems a bit less likely, but it’s still fun to think about!\n\nWhen traveling…\n\nRight-hand side drivers face difficulties when driving in countries where it has left-hand drive. In left-hand driving countries, the driver’s seat is on the left side of the car, opposite the right-hand driving countries.\n\nThis can be confusing for right-hand side drivers, especially when making turns. Right-hand side drivers also need to be careful when crossing the street, as they may not be looking in the right direction for oncoming traffic.\n\nThere is a price difference in cars for left-hand and right-hand drivers.\n\nGenerally, left-hand drive cars are less expensive than right-hand drive cars.\n\nThis is because left-hand drive cars are more common, and there is more demand for them.\n\nRight-hand drive cars are typically only manufactured for countries that drive on the right side of the road, so the demand is much lower.\n\nThis results in higher prices for right-hand drive cars.\n\nTop advice for right-hand drivers\n\nWhen driving in a country with a left-hand drive, it’s important to be aware of the differences in the way the road is structured. In left-hand drive countries, the driver sits on the left side of the car, and the windscreen is on the right.\n\nThis can be confusing for right-hand drivers, who are used to sitting on the right side of the car and looking out of the left-hand windscreen.\n\nHere are a few tips for right-hand drivers when driving in left-hand drive countries:\n\nStay aware of your surroundings\n\nMake sure to look left and right before crossing streets, even if there are no cars coming. The structure of the road can be confusing, so it’s important always to be aware of your surroundings.\n\nGet familiar with the traffic signs\n\nMany of the traffic signs will be in a foreign language, so it’s important to get familiar with them before you start driving.\n\nKeep left!\n\nWhen passing other cars, make sure to stay in your lane and keep left. It can be easy to get confused and accidentally switch lanes, but staying safe on the road is important.\n\nThe price difference\n\nThere is a price difference in cars for left-hand and right-hand drivers.\n\nGenerally, left-hand drive cars are less expensive than right-hand drive cars. This is because left-hand drive cars are more common, and there is more demand for them.\n\nRight-hand drive cars are typically only manufactured for countries that drive on the right side of the road, so the demand is much lower. This results in higher prices for right-hand drive cars.\n\nWhen it comes to cars that are only manufactured for right-hand drivers, there are not many on the market. This is because left-hand drive cars are more common, and right-hand drive cars are only manufactured for countries that drive on the right side of the road.\n\nRight-hand drive cars are typically more expensive than left-hand drive cars and can be difficult to find.\n\nThere are a few reasons why right-hand drive cars are more expensive\n\nFirstly, there is less demand for them, as left-hand drive cars are more common.\n\nSecondly, the manufacturing process is more complicated, as all components must be made to fit a right-hand drive car.\n\nFinally, many countries have laws that prohibit left-hand drive cars from being driven on their roads, so the demand for right-hand drive cars is even lower.\n\nRight-hand versus Left-hand\n\nRight-hand versus left-hand driving is a conversation that often sparks confusion among drivers, no matter the country.\n\nIn left-hand drive countries, such as the United States, the driver sits on the left side of the car, and the steering wheel is also on the left.\n\nConversely, in right-hand drive countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, India, and Thailand, the driver sits on the right side of the car and looks out from a right-hand steering wheel.\n\nWhile both setups have their advantages and disadvantages, left-hand drive is generally more popular because it is more common.\n\nLeft-hand drive cars are cheaper to produce and can be found in more countries. Right-hand drive cars are typically only manufactured for countries that use right-side driving, which limits their availability and increases the cost.\n\nManufacturing cost\n\nLeft-hand drive cars are typically only manufactured for countries driving on the road’s left side.\n\nThis is because left-hand drivers are used to sitting on the left side of the car and looking out of the left-hand windscreen.\n\nRight-hand drivers, who are used to sitting on the right side of the car and looking out of the right-hand windscreen, may find it confusing to drive in a left-hand drive country.\n\nLeft-hand drive cars can be difficult to find in right-hand drive countries, as they are not manufactured for these countries.\n\nHowever, a few left-hand drive cars are available in right-hand drive countries.\n\nThese cars are typically more expensive than left-hand drive cars that are manufactured for left-hand drivers.\n\nList of largest countries with right-side driving\n\n– United Kingdom\n\n– Australia\n\n– Japan\n\n– India\n\n– Indonesia"
