        "text": "Have you ever wondered why some countries, like Australia, drive on the left-hand side of the road? This intriguing practice has a rich history, dating back to ancient times. During the Roman Empire, soldiers preferred to keep to the left to ensure their right hand, which wielded their sword, was closer to potential enemies. This tradition continued through medieval Europe, where knights and horsemen kept to the left to keep their dominant hand free from combat. In the 18th century, England formally adopted this practice, which was then passed on to its colonies, including Australia.\n\nEven in Japan, left-hand traffic was influenced by British advisors during the Meiji Restoration era. In contrast, many former British colonies, such as Canada and the United States, shifted to right-hand driving due to the influence of their neighbors.\n\nThis historical tradition has continued, and countries like Australia have continued to drive on the left, shaping their infrastructure and road construction practices accordingly."
