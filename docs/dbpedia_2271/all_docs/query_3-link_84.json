        "text": "It's a bit late at night for a fuller response .....\n\nBut as for doctrine, it isn't something that RCs talk about much. Its kind of there in the background. A common comment is that for most, there has been little formation/faith development since leaving school. Homilies are about unpacking the readings of the day, not about doctrinal teaching. Pew surveys in the USA suggest there is a wide spectrum of understanding or assent to even the most basic doctrines among lay folk.\n\nAs for liturgy, there is a kind of relaxed seriousness in most parishes on Sundays at the main family Mass, but a much more devotional atmosphere on weekdays. Very few priests would tinker with either texts or rubrics, ever. So for example our main Sunday Mass has an atmosphere that makes room for noisy kids, uses modern music etc but is done by the book. Theologically the Euchrist is seen as an action of the whole Church concentrated at that place, so individualistic tinkering are seen as a serious matter way beyond the remit of individual parishes. There are of course places where Liturgy is conducted with great beauty and seriousness, but they are not typical. But always the actions and words are by the book.\n\nThe \"ex opere\" thing is to do with the spiritual state of the celebrant not getting in the way of the operation of sacramental grace. So God is still operating no matter how appalling a wicked person the priest is. Its not really about the performance of ritual .... we don't really see Liturgy like that.\n\nI think that Angloid is quite right when he says that 'most (Catholic)priests and people do not often challenge accepted doctrines but are less obsessed by them than many non-Catholics think'.\n\nOpenly to challenge the accepted doctrines of the Trinity and the Eucharist would normally get a priest into trouble with his bishop. But you have to ask also for most (Catholic) parishioners what are the 'accepted' doctrines of the Church ?\n\nFor most people if you belong to the Church you belong to the Church and leave\n\nthe details of doctrine to those who are interested in them. Otherwise you just get entangled in arguments which most people are not particularly interested in.\n\nThe Church (and this goes for all religious bodies) is not simply a list of doctrines which one has to believe in. It is for many a place of encounter both with the divine and also with the very human side of our societies. For some it is a very important part of their everyday life ,accompanying them at important stages of 'hatch, match and dispatch. For others it is there in the background and yet for others an irrelevance.\n\nThe \"ex opere\" thing is to do with the spiritual state of the celebrant not getting in the way of the operation of sacramental grace. So God is still operating no matter how appalling a wicked person the priest is. Its not really about the performance of ritual .... we don't really see Liturgy like that.\n\nPut like that it is exactly the same as the C of E Article XXVI; 'Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect of the Sacrament.'\n\nMaybe there is something else involved besides 'the ex opere thing'. I was thinking more, that for a Catholic, especially in times of persecution, the important thing would be simply to worship at the Mass, because there often wouldn't be the opportunity for splendid settings or lengthy liturgy. Hence I am surmising that a tradition might well have grown up amongst English Catholics at least that music, ceremonial, architecture was something of an optional extra.\n\nBy contrast, for many years in the C of E the importance of sacraments was downplayed and hence if worship was going to have any power it would be more as an intellectual or emotional activity. The other current thread here about Anglican worship in the pre-victorian age suggests that even those aspects were often neglected and going to church must have been an incredibly boring experience in many cases. Things did of course improve in the 19th century, but I would have thought the emphasis on preaching and music would have been a counterbalance to an exclusive focus on the sacraments.\n\nI'm aware that I am flying kites here of course and even if my theory has any truth there are too many exceptions on both sides to make much of it. So shoot me down if you wish!\n\nNevertheless there is an obvious difference between RC and Anglican worship which doesn't always reflect different theology. Full-on 'up the candle' Anglo-catholic liturgy is usually recognisable as Anglican even if the words of the rite are from the Missal and the ceremonial is from (pre or post Vatican 2) RC handbooks.\n\nHaving watched a number of Anglican Streamed Services in recent years, I think I agree with Android that Anglo-catholic liturgy is usually recognisable as Anglican even if the words of the rite are from the Missal.\n\nIt’s also very noticeable when a Roman Catholic Priest has crossed the Tiber and become Anglican. I watched an Anglican service once where I kept saying to myself “I bet he was one of us!” I wasn’t surprised when I found he had crossed the Tiber several years before.\n\nThere are certain giveaways in the liturgy, usually around the way Anglicans interpret the rubrics around the epiclesis and consecration which is hard to explain. Anglicans are usually more precise in their gestures, and I imagine they spend a lot of time studying how their hands are positioned in the orans position because they’re never lopsided.\n\nMost Catholic clergy tend to be a little more relaxed about such things, without being sloppy.\n\nLast week, I was at a mass where the priest said the entire Eucharistic prayer whilst not central to the altar, I must admit I found it a little distracting but I imagine if I said anything to the priest he really wouldn’t have cared.\n\nAnd then there are the Lutherans. On the one hand, our Augsburg Confession says we have not given up the Mass, but on the other hand, we also say the liturgy is adiaphora, neither commanded nor forbidden. Most Lutheran litugies follow the basic outline of the Deutche Masse which was Luther's adaptation of the Roman Catholic Mass at the time. What Luther essentially dropped was prayers referencing the saints and the papacy. While most Lutherans use the Revised Common Lectionary, some use the Narrative Lectionary . The different Synods also have the individual lectionaries in their hymnals.\n\nOur occasional services, though are very close to the occasional rites of the Roman church. Once I was in the hospital ICU as a patient. A Roman priest came by and said the Liturgy of the Anointing of the Sick to a man in the next bed. He was amazed I knew the whole rite from memory.\n\nIt does seem the TEC is more formal in gestures. I sometimes get tripped up. When do I genuflect? When do I reverence the altar? When do I cross myself? Things like that. Still I can do a passable job in a TEC setting.\n\nBut, when it comes to other denominations we ELCAers are in fellowship with (Methodist, UCC, Presbyterian), things are much less formal.\n\nIn general, I think that parishes that are self-consciously AC are not the norm. Most in TEC, at least, are broad church or low, although Anglican low and not happy-clappy low.\n\nI suspect you have never experienced the Church of England. I've only a limited experience of TEC, but I think that most churches you would describe as 'low', most C of E Anglicans would perceived as middle-to-high. But yes, I think even the 'highest' TEC churches are recognisably Anglican, not just in subtle ways but in their loyalty to approved Anglican texts. The C of E covers a much wider spectrum (including 'happy clappy low').\n\nWell my point about St Clement's is that they are among the \"highest\" parishes within TEC and they aren't really recognizably Anglican. It's a Missal Mass, so the priest says the canon privately, the peace comes at the end of the canon, etc. I suppose the missal is approved, in some sense, but also I think they and parishes like them are mostly allowed to continue on because they've been doing it for so long.\n\nThe churches I am classifying as low in TEC are the sorts that do Morning Prayer instead of communion at least once a month. How common are parishes of that sort in the CoE? To be fair, although I know of several in TEC, they are all in cities. It seems like most rural parishes do communion on Sundays and may be considered fairly \"high\" by CoE standards; I don't know what the baseline is there.\n\nThanks for correcting my over-simplified view of TEC! I didn't realise that there were still Morning Prayer churches... do they tend to be in certain regions? Morning Prayer, aka Choral Mattins, is now very rare in the C of E: but the centrality of the Eucharist has taken a knock in the last few years, partly because of the shortage of clergy but also because of an evangelical takeover of many parishes with 'praise services' and the like.\n\nBecause rural churches in England tend to be more conservative, many of them have been slow to catch up with the Parish Communion movement even after nearly a century, but equally they have been slow to abandon liturgical Morning Prayer. A bit different from your description of rural TEC parishes. But they have been even harder ht by the shortage of clergy, so non-eucharistic services are often the norm except in small towns.\n\nInterestingly enough, I just met an English woman after church today who commented on how the service was more like what one would get back in England. Fun timing!\n\nI've lived in the northeast and now live in the upper midwest, and you can kind of always find a Morning Prayer church--in the urban areas, that is. I think that in the rural and suburban areas it's most likely going to be a eucharist service. I'm not sure why that is, and I hadn't really put that all together until this thread. I used to live in a city and attended an extremely AC church there. There were 3 other TEC parishes in the city, two were broad church, and the third was a Morning Prayer church.\n\nI currently live in a somewhat rural spot in the upper midwest and go into the city for Mass to get out of the sticks. The city I go to has three TEC parishes: one church that tries hard to be AC, a broad church that I go to, and then a very reformed style church that does Morning Prayer every other week, uses leavened bread for communion, and tends to have longer sermons.\n\nI'm not sure how the priest shortage will impact churches in TEC, but I rather think that the first big hit overall will be with all of the baby boomer parishioners dying off, and the subsequent closing of small parishes. It will be interesting to see how these changes impact the liturgy.\n\nThe RC church near where my daughter lives in Oxford is manned by ex- Anglican priests, members of the Ordinariate. I knew from the moment the entrance procession started that was the case without ever being told. Something about their almost military precision when taking corners. Turning to the altar at the creed. Fussy manual gestures. Genuflections that were smartly done (stop 2,3, drop 2,3, up 2,3, move 2,3.) I found myself wishing they would just unbend a little and act as though they were among family and that God was their Father and not some despotic emperor.\n\nBut an excellent homily.\n\nMind you ....... you can find all of that among hyper Trad RC orders, like this lot. I will probably go to hell but I can't get the word \"zombies\" out of my head\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/kVMXPxCdmL0?feature=shared\n\nI think there are two reasons for this, both very peculiar to that particular wing of the CofE that they converted from. The Ordinariate only appeals to rather a geeky part of the CofE.\n\nWarning. Some of what follows may sound harsh to some Shipmates.\n\nThe first reason goes back to the nineteenth and earlier twentieth century, when the more ultra-montane wing of Anglo-Catholicism - itself already a wing - started looking to Roman Catholicism of that era to try to rebuild how they thought the CofE ought to be if it hadn't been for the Reformation. So it was all self-conscious, a bit like the liturgical equivalent of the Sealed Knot Society, driven by a strong commitment to emulating something else, rather than expressing a tradition that was live. It sprang from the head, not from the heart, more aimed at getting everything right, creating a model of being Catholic as it looked from outside, than living a life of faith.\n\nOver time that has changed the rest of the CofE. Its liturgical centre of gravity is further up the candle now than it was 124 years ago. However, the second reason, is that the rest of the CofE is much less bothered about the geeky stuff. That is particularly so since Common Worship came into use because it provides a wide range of alternatives and options. Well before that, most ordinary clergy approached putting services together according to how their training incumbent taught them to do it and what they think will work for their congregation. Common Worship has endorsed that.\n\nAlso, although the general flavour of the rest of the CofE has gone up the candle, it's more influenced by the happy clappy end than some of the generality like to admit. And multiple benefices mean that a lot of clergy cover more than one church. What works in one of their churches may not work in another. It's only the more foolhardy clergy that don't accommodate that.\n\nSo what happens in the rest of the CofE isn't quite what you're describing and may well not fit with what @Gramps49 has found with the TEC. It varies how dignified it is, but even in cathedrals, it isn't that consistent or prissy.\n\nAlan29, that film is incredible. Are they Spanish? I sort of admire it.\n\nReading the comments it seems as if that is a real church and not some sci-fi fantasy. Is that really the case? If so it is exceedingly creepy.\n\nEnoch, above, hits the nail on the head. There is much that is wrong with the current C of E, not least its obsession with what used to be called on here Dead Horse issues, but also with the liturgical (at least semi-) chaos which Common Worship attempted to control in vain. We've moved from the 16th century, Elizabethan, ideal of a church that didn't set tight limits on belief ('I would not open windows into men's souls.') but insisted on a uniform liturgy, through increasingly diversity of practice mirroring different theologies, to the present situation of a vocal minority attempting to force conformity to a very narrow set of beliefs, while tolerating a much wider variety of practice.\n\nAs I understand it (notwithstanding some of the corrections from Thomas Rowans) TEC and probably most other Anglican churches, have a generally accepted form of liturgy. Maybe because there is less theological diversity. But it would be nice to live in a church where you could attend any parish and share in familiar worship. Much like being a Roman Catholic.\n\nAt its best, when it is neither prissy nor pompous, traditional Anglican worship is priceless.\n\nI am slightly puzzled.\n\nSt Obscures is what most people would call Anglo-Papalist but it is not for them a religion of the head but of the heart. Novus Ordo (tick), bits in Latin (tick), incense (tick) and I can go on. The Anglican heritage is visible only in the occassional evensong (BCP) and the English saints included in the lectionary.\n\nHowever, compared to my experience of Presbyterians there are relaxed about liturgy. The Mass is the mass and honestly someone kneeling, sitting or standing at the wrong point does not invalidate it. Indeed as a congregational member what others are doing is none of my business, though I do have to check others are not just copying me because I do not always get it right*. I do not think we yet have a little old lady praying the rosary during the mass and just falling quiet for the consecration but maybe J will do that when she retires from the choir. It will not make any odds with the chaos that goes on a Sunday morning anyway. You can not be too prizzy if you have children in the nave for the whole of the mass. Nor is it sensible to be fussy about how everything is performed if you are dealing with an eighty plus year old priest with declining health. We are grateful that they are still willing to say the mass so we can receive beyond that we seek to make them as comfortable saying it as possible. If that means something happens that does not quite conform to the rubrics then so be it. People are people they are not robots and the Perichosis is likened to a dance not a military parade.\n\nNormally Father lays the fussiness on the part of the CofE he sees as High Church but not Catholic. I am not sure he is right, one congregation does not make a movement and there are some in our congregation who can get worried about little details of worship.\n\nMy sociologist of religion hat says the big difference at least in the UK is because the two groups are trying to prove different things in their liturgy. The Roman Catholics do not use liturgy to demonstrate their catholicism that is fully embedded in their allegiances, or if you prefer the familia they belong to. Their worship is formed in that context. However, they do have half an eye on not being thought of as properly English, i.e. being seen as the church for the Irish diaspora in England or because of centuries of persecution based on the distrust created at the time of the Reformation. Anglo Catholics on the other hand as part of the Church of England do not spend time worrying about their Englishness but are rather concerned to prove their Catholicism and use the liturgy to show case this.\n\n* I know they copy me, as when the Sacristan and I stood up at the end of Holy Hour to take things through to the Sacristy and the whole congregation stood up. They are getting better at being themselves and trusting themselves to know the mass.\n\nThe churches I am classifying as low in TEC are the sorts that do Morning Prayer instead of communion at least once a month. How common are parishes of that sort in the CoE? To be fair, although I know of several in TEC, they are all in cities. It seems like most rural parishes do communion on Sundays and may be considered fairly \"high\" by CoE standards; I don't know what the baseline is there.\n\nI haven't encountered one of your \"Morning Prayer\" TEC places in my travels.\n\nNor have I, at least since the mid-80s. (Many TEC parishes in my corner of the US transitioned to the Eucharist as the main Sunday service, following the adoption of the 1979 BCP, by celebrating the Eucharist on first, third and fifth Sundays and Morning Prayer on second and fourth Sundays. They followed that pattern for 3-5 years, then moved to the Eucharist as the main service every Sunday.)\n\nMaybe such parishes can be found in traditionally-low Virginia.\n\nI just checked the website of the parish I attended while living in Richmond for a year and they are still alternating between Eucharist and Morning Prayer for their big 11:00 Sunday service. I admit I found it strange when I was there, because Eucharist on Sundays is par for the course in Canada pretty much anywhere you go, but they did it very well.\n\nTo respond to the OP I find it hard to compare Anglican and Roman Catholic practice in Canada for lack of recent experience of the RC side of the equation. Anglican liturgy in Canada is all over the map. When I was around 10-11 years old and growing up in Ottawa (early 1980s) I was seeing more RC liturgy than I usually do now and it was definitely of the baby-out-with-the-bathwater style as far as more traditional liturgical and musical practices were concerned. Somewhat by accident lately I’ve been talking to some people coming out of the RC tradition and there seem to be promising things happening in places, without necessarily veering into ultra-trad territory."
