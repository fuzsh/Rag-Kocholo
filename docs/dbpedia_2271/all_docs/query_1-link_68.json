        "text": "FALL RIVER - José Silva says the Holy Ghost has touched his life in many ways.\n\n“It’s always been in my heart, and it has always been an integral part of my life,” said Silva, who is at the helm of this year’s Great Feast of the Holy Ghost of New England.\n\nBorn in Rabo de Peixe, S. Miguel, Azores, Silva was a teenager when he arrived in Fall River via Canada in 1967.\n\n“My family has served in my hometown’s feast for four generations, and I hope my children can carry on that tradition,” he said.\n\nDespite the distance from his motherland, his devotion to the Holy Spirit grew even fonder and Silva said the Great Feast has helped him remain rooted to his Portuguese heritage.\n\n“I have been a member of the feast committee for a few years, but this is my first time as its president. It’s such a great honor and I am very humbled by it,” said the Dartmouth resident, who served as the feast’s vice-president in 2012 and 2013.\n\nSilva said that one of his goals as president has been to encourage greater participation and collaboration from the Brotherhoods and the youth.\n\n“The youth are the future of this feast,” he said. “It’s very important that one day they carry it on, as it is a celebration of our faith and culture.”\n\nSilva said he is appreciative of all the untiring and unseen tasks undertaken by an anonymous army of volunteers who work diligently to assure the success of each celebration.\n\n“They work tirelessly for months,” said Silva. “You can’t have a successful feast without them. But we need everyone’s support.”\n\nOne of the committee’s greatest challenges has always been the fundraising aspect, as the four-day celebration comes with a roughly $180,000 price tag.\n\n“The feast by itself does not cover the expenses,” said Silva noting that some of those expenses include permit fees, rental of Kennedy Park, and the electricity bill. “That’s why sponsorships are so important.”\n\nSilva knows a thing or two about fundraising as he has been actively involved in several community initiatives. He was part of the Amigos de Rabo de Peixe, Inc.- USA for several years, and served as their president from 2005 to 2007.\n\nHe then founded the Irmandade do Senhor Bom Jesus da Vila de Rabo de Peixe-USA (Brotherhood of the Good Lord Jesus of the Vila de Rabo de Peixe-USA) in 2007, and currently serves as its president. He also serves as president of the General Assembly of the Saint Anthony Band of Fall River.\n\n“I hope everyone comes out to support the Great Feast,” he said. “It’s a great showing of our rich cultural and religious heritage.”\n\nIf you go\n\nAUG. 21 (Thursday)\n\n7:00 PM — Opening of the festivities at Kennedy Park.\n\n7:15 PM — Entertainment by local community entertainers:\n\n7:30 PM — 2FK\n\n7:30 – 8 PM — Geana Soares\n\n8 – 8:30 PM — Catia Ferreira\n\n8:30 – 9 PM — Rosa Maria\n\n9 – 10 PM — Shirley Guerreiro\n\n10 – 10:45 PM — Nádia & Band\n\n11:00 PM — Closing\n\nAUG. 22 (FRIDAY)\n\n7 PM — Blessing of the food (Pensões) to be distributed amongst the needy.
