Pope Francis on Tuesday urged the faithful to adopt a “spirit of service,” pointing to the example of the Blessed Mother who went in haste to help her expectant cousin Elizabeth.The pope spoke to a crowd gathered in St. Peter’s Square for the recitation of the Angelus on the feast of Mary’s assumption into heaven.In his reflection before leading the Marian prayer, Pope Francis drew on the day’s Gospel reading — Luke’s account of Mary’s Visitation — which the Holy Father said shows the Mother of God to be a “woman of service” to her neighbor.“Our Lady, who had just conceived, travels almost 150 kilometers [about 93 miles] from Nazareth to reach Elizabeth’s house,” Pope Francis noted. “Helping is costly, to all of us! We always experience this in the fatigue, patience, and worries that taking care of others entails.”Pilgrims carry a sign in St. Peter's Square on Aug. 15, 2023, during Pope Francis' Angelus reflections on the solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Vatican MediaThe pope warned, however, that “service risks being barren without praise to God.” “Indeed, when Mary enters the home of her cousin, she praises the Lord,” the pope said. “She does not talk about her weariness from the journey, but rather a song of jubilation springs from her heart. Because those who love God know praise.”“Let us try to ask ourselves: Do I live my work and daily occupations with a spirit of service, or with selfishness?” the pope said. “Do I devote myself to someone freely, without seeking immediate advantages? In short, do I make service the ‘springboard’ of my life?” He continued: “And thinking about praise: Do I, like Mary, exult in God? Do I pray, blessing the Lord? And, after praising him, do I spread his joy among the people I meet? Each one of you, try to answer these questions.”Following the recitation of the Angelus, Francis also offered a customary blessing of the crowd. “Today, we entrust to Mary assumed into heaven our supplication for peace in Ukraine and in all war-torn regions: There are so many of them, unfortunately,” he said. “The clamor of weapons drowns out attempts at dialogue; the law of force prevails over the force of law,” he continued. “But let us not be discouraged, let us continue to hope and to pray, because it is God, it is he who guides history. May he listen to us!”\n\nPope Francis blesses the crowd from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square at the end of his Sunday Angelus address Aug. 13, 2023. / Vatican Media. Vatican City, Aug 13, 2023 / 07:46 am (CNA). Pope Francis called attention Sunday to the thousands of people who have lost their lives trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to immigrate to Europe in 2023.“It is an open wound of our humanity,” he said after reciting the Angelus prayer at the Vatican on Aug. 13. He added that the deaths bring “pain and shame.”The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that 2,175 men, women, and children are either missing or dead in the Mediterranean Sea as of Aug. 13, 2023. In 2022, in the same period, the estimated dead and missing was 1,361.Speaking to a crowd of around 15,000 people gathered in St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis said he had prayed for the 41 migrants who died in the latest Mediterranean shipwreck tragedy.Survivors rescued off the coast of the small Italian island of Lampedusa reported the migrant shipwreck on Wednesday, according to CNN.An estimated 90,763 migrants have arrived in Italy by sea in 2023 as of Aug. 6, a large uptick from the previous year, authorities say.“I encourage political and diplomatic efforts that seek to heal [the wound of migrant deaths] in a spirit of solidarity and brotherhood,” Pope Francis said on Sunday, “as well as the efforts of all those working to prevent shipwrecks and rescue migrants.”\n\nPope Francis gives his Angelus address June 29, 2023. / Credit: Vatican News Vatican City, Aug 13, 2023 / 06:46 am (CNA). In times of fear and difficulty, call on Jesus, who has already conquered the powers of evil, Pope Francis said on Sunday.“The powers of evil that frighten us, that we cannot master, immediately take on smaller proportions with Jesus,” he said, encouraging people to “call on the Lord with faith.”On Aug. 13, the pope addressed around 15,000 people from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square before reciting the Angelus, a Marian prayer.His message focused on the day’s Gospel passage, which recalls when Jesus walked on the water of the Lake of Galilee to meet his disciples, who were afraid because their boat was being tossed by wind and waves.There is, Pope Francis said, “a message behind the walking on the water…”At the time, large bodies of water, especially during storms, were believed to contain evil powers uncontrollable by man, he explained.“Now, the disciples found themselves in the middle of the lake when it was dark,” he said. “They are afraid of sinking, of being sucked in by evil. And here comes Jesus, walking on the waters, that is, over the powers of evil, and he says to his disciples: ‘Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.’” He said Jesus is saying the same thing to us today: “‘Do not be afraid. I have put your enemies under my feet’ — not people! — not that type of enemy, but death, sin, the devil…”Pope Francis also drew attention to the words uttered by St. Peter as he began to sink into the lake while walking on the water toward Jesus.“Peter walks a little way out on the waters toward Jesus, but then gets frightened. He sinks and then cries out: ‘Lord, save me!’” the pope said.“This prayer is beautiful,” he added. “It expresses the certainty that the Lord can save us, that he conquers our evil and our fears. I invite you to repeat it now all together, three times: ‘Lord, save me! Lord, save me! Lord, save me!’”Francis pointed out that after calling on Jesus for help, the second thing the disciples do is welcome him into the boat.“The Lord knows that the boat of our life, as well as the boat of the Church, is threatened by headwinds, and that the sea on which we sail is often turbulent. The Lord knows,” he said.“He does not spare us the hard work of sailing, rather — the Gospel highlights — he pushes his disciples to depart. He invites us to face difficulties so they too might become salvific places,” he said. “Jesus conquers them so that they become opportunities to meet him. In fact, in our moments of darkness, he comes to meet us, asking to be welcomed like that night on the lake.”“So, let us ask ourselves: How do I react when I am afraid, when I have difficulty?” Francis said. “Do I go ahead\n\nPope Francis at his general audience in St. Peter's Square on May 17, 2023. / Vatican Media Vatican City, Aug 12, 2023 / 09:30 am (CNA). After Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was gunned down at a campaign rally this week, Pope Francis appealed for a unified effort for peace in the country plagued by drug-related violence.The pope sent a condolence telegram to Archbishop Alfredo Espinoza Mateus of Quito on Aug. 12 in which he condemned the assassination “with all his strength” and expressed his deepest sympathy to the family of the deceased and “all of the beloved Ecuadorian people.”Villavicencio, 59, was assassinated on Wednesday night at a campaign event only ten days before the first round of voting in Ecuador’s presidential election. The politician had been an outspoken critic of the violence caused by drug trafficking.Immediately following the assassination, the Ecuadorian bishops’ conference condemned the act of violence, while pledging to support initiatives to restore public safety and to “pray and work for peace based on freedom, justice, and truth.”The telegram sent on the pope’s behalf by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin called on “all citizens and political forces to unite in a common effort for peace in the face of the suffering caused by unjustifiable violence.”“With these sentiments, Pope Francis, while commending the eternal rest of Mr. Villavicenzo to the maternal intercession of Our Lady of El Quinche, affectionately imparts his apostolic blessing as a sign of faith and hope in the risen Christ,” it said.\n\nCardinal Manuel Clemente, the Patriarch of Lisbon, greets attendees of World Youth Day at the opening Mass on Aug. 1, 2023, in Lisbon, Portugal. / Arlindo Homem / JMJ Lisboa 2023 Rome Newsroom, Aug 10, 2023 / 04:30 am (CNA). Pope Francis on Thursday named Bishop Rui Manuel Sousa Valério as patriarch of Lisbon, just days after the conclusion of World Youth Day in the capital city of Portugal.The pope on Aug. 10 also accepted the resignation of Cardinal-Patriarch Manuel Clemente, who has led the patriarchate since May 2013. Clemente turned 75 last month.Valério, a member of the Missionaries of the Company of Mary for more than three decades, has been bishop of the Military Ordinariate of Portugal since the end of 2018.The 58-year-old bishop was born in Ourém, in the Diocese of Leira-Fátima. He studied for the priesthood at two Rome universities, the Pontifical Lateran and the Pontifical Gregorian. He also completed a course in linguistics at a third university in Rome, and a course in spirituality at the Centre International Montfortain in Louvain, Belgium.The pope’s appointment comes just days after the Patriarchate of Lisbon hosted hundreds of thousands of young Catholics for the celebration of World Youth Day Aug. 1–6. Francis also participated in the event, visiting the Portuguese capital as well as Fátima, from Aug. 2–6.Clemente celebrated the opening Mass of WYD on Aug. 1, while Lisbon Auxiliary Bishop Américo Aguiar oversaw the planning of the major international event. Aguiar, who will be made a cardinal by Pope Francis on Sept. 30, had been considered a potential candidate for the leadership of the historic patriarchate.The Patriarchate of Lisbon, which has roots dating back to the fourth century, as of 2020 served nearly 1.5 million Catholics — 89% of the area’s population.It also has a second auxiliary, Bishop Joaquim Augusto da Silva Mendes, a member of the Salesians of Don Bosco.\n\nA St. Thomas Christian cross at the installation of Mar Joseph Srampickal at Preston North End stadium, England, on Oct. 9, 2016. / Mazur/catholicnews.org.uk. Rome Newsroom, Aug 10, 2023 / 03:23 am (CNA). Pope Francis has appointed Slovak Archbishop-Bishop Cyril Vasil’ to resolve a decades-long liturgical dispute in the Syro-Malabar Church in India.Francis has directly intervened several times in the controversy, which centers on a debate about which direction the priest should face when celebrating the liturgy.Vasil’, an expert on canon law of the Eastern Churches, has been given special faculties in the Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly to ensure “the implementation of the liturgical reform approved by the Synod of the Syro-Malabar Major Archdiocesan Church,” according to an Aug. 10 press release from the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Eastern Churches.The archbishop’s mission began on Aug. 4, when he arrived in India, the release said.Vasil’, a Jesuit, has led the Slovak Catholic Eparchy of Košice since 2009. He has served, in the past, as a professor and rector of the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome and from 2009–2020 was secretary of the Congregation for the Eastern Churches.The eucharistic liturgy of the Syro-Malabar Church, known as the Holy Qurbana, has been the subject of a long, complex dispute over which direction the priest should face when celebrating the liturgy.Protests against the adoption of a uniform liturgy have included a hunger strike by priests and the burning of effigies of cardinals.The Syro-Malabar Church is one of the 23 autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches in full communion with Rome. Based in the Indian state of Kerala, the Church has more than 4 million members worldwide, making it the second-largest Eastern Catholic Church after the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.\n\nPope Francis smiles at pilgrims during his Wednesday general audience in the Vatican's Paul VI Hall on Aug. 9, 2023. / Daniel Ibanez/CNA Vatican City, Aug 9, 2023 / 03:40 am (CNA). Pope Francis said Wednesday he likes to invoke the Virgin Mary under the title of “Our Lady ‘in haste’” because she is always ready to swiftly intercede for her children’s requests.“At World Youth Day, the Gospel proposed to young people the model of the Virgin Mary. At her most critical moment, [Mary] goes to visit her cousin Elizabeth. The Gospel says ‘she arose and went in haste,’” the pope said at his weekly audience in the Vatican’s Paul VI Hall Aug. 9.“I really like to invoke Our Lady in this aspect,” Francis added. “Our Lady ‘in haste,’ who always gets things done quickly, never keeps us waiting, because she is the mother of all.”“Mary arose and went with haste,” from Luke 1:39, was the theme of World Youth Day 2023 in Lisbon, Portugal. The international gathering of Catholic youth, held Aug. 1–6, drew approximately 1.5 million people to its closing vigil and Mass with Pope Francis.Pilgrims at the Wednesday general audience Aug. 9, 2023, hold up an image of the Virgin Mary. Daniel Ibanez/CNAPope Francis resumed his Wednesday general audience Aug. 9 after traveling Aug. 2–6 to Portugal and taking a break during the month of July.While in Portugal, Francis also stopped at the Shrine of Our Lady of Fátima, where he prayed a rosary with sick young adults.“Just as she did a century ago in Portugal, at Fátima, when she addressed three children, entrusting them with a message of faith and hope for the Church and the world,” the pope said, “today, in the third millennium, Mary still guides the pilgrimage of young people in following Jesus.”He said he prayed at the place of the apparitions that God would heal the world of the diseases of the soul: “pride, lies, enmity, violence.”“We renewed the consecration of ourselves, of Europe, of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. And I prayed for peace, because there are so many wars in the world, so many,” he added.On his return flight to Rome from Lisbon Aug. 6, Pope Francis said in Fátima he prayed a private prayer for peace, though he opted to skip reading aloud a prayer that consecrated the Church and “countries at war” to the Blessed Virgin Mary.Francis said his second visit to Portugal “benefited from the festive atmosphere of... the wave of young people” in attendance at World Youth Day.“It was not a vacation, a tourist trip, nor even a spiritual event closed on itself,” he said. “The Youth Day is an encounter with Christ through the Church. Young people go to encounter Christ.”“While in Ukraine and other places in the world there is fighting, and while in certain hidden halls war is planned — it’s terrible, isn’t it? War is planned — World Youth Day showed everyone that another way is possible: a world\n\nSt. Josemaria Escrivá, founder of Opus Dei / Flick Torreciudad Sanctuary (CC BY 2.0) Rome Newsroom, Aug 8, 2023 / 10:00 am (CNA). Pope Francis changed canon law on Tuesday regarding the governance of Opus Dei and any future personal prelatures.In a motu proprio issued Aug. 8, the pope assimilated the personal prelature to “public clerical associations of pontifical right with the faculty of incardinating clerics.” It also further defined the role of the prelate as a “moderator endowed with the faculties of an ordinary.”The motu proprio modifies canons 295 and 296 of the Code of Canon Law on personal prelatures and immediately entered into force on the day of its publication.The updated canons now state that the statutes that govern a personal prelature can be “approved or issued by the Apostolic See.”To date, the international Catholic organization Opus Dei is the only personal prelature in the Catholic Church. The group’s statutes have yet to be approved by the Holy See following its extraordinary congress in April.Opus Dei is a personal prelature made up of laymen and laywomen and priests founded by St. Josemaría Escrivá in 1928. Escrivá called the organization Opus Dei to emphasize his belief that its foundation was a “work of God” — or, in Latin, “opus Dei.”Canon 296 on the lay involvement in the personal prelature now also includes a reference to canon 107 and stresses that “the manner of this organic cooperation and the main duties and rights connected with it shall be determined appropriately in the statutes.”The changes build upon the pope’s previous decree on the oversight of Opus Dei last year in the motu proprio “To guard the charism,” which declared that its leader, the prelate, could no longer be a bishop.In the text of the decree, Pope Francis also recalled that the apostolic constitution Praedicate Evangelium transferred the competence over personal prelatures to the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Clergy.Responding to the most recent changes, Opus Dei spokesman Manuel Sanchez told CNA that the organization “will study what consequences these changes may have for the juridical configuration of Opus Dei, also in the context of the work that is being carried out with the clergy dicastery on the adaptation of the statutes required by the motu proprio Ad Charisma Tuendum, in a climate of communion with the Holy Father.”Opus Dei has about 90,000 members — 98% of whom are laypeople, the majority of which are married. In addition to its lay members, some 1,900 priests incardinated in different dioceses throughout the world belong to the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, an association of clergy intrinsically united to the prelature of Opus Dei.\n\nnull / Credit: Blue Planet Studio/Shutterstock Rome Newsroom, Aug 8, 2023 / 08:30 am (CNA). The Vatican announced Tuesday that Pope Francis’ annual peace message for 2024 will focus on artificial intelligence (AI).A statement from the Vatican’s Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development on Aug. 8 described an “urgent need” to guide the development and use of artificial intelligence in a responsible way, requiring that “ethical reflection be extended to the sphere of education and law.”“Pope Francis calls for an open dialogue on the meaning of these new technologies, endowed with disruptive possibilities and ambivalent effects,” it said.The Vatican office noted that artificial intelligence technologies are having “a rapidly increasing impact on human activity, personal and social life, politics and the economy” and called for vigilance to ensure that technological development contributes to “the promotion of justice and peace in the world.”Years before the widely-popular release of the GPT-4 chatbot system, developed by the San Francisco start-up OpenAI, the Vatican was already heavily involved in the conversation of artificial intelligence ethics, hosting high-level discussions with scientists and tech executives on the ethics of artificial intelligence in 2016 and 2020.Pope Francis has repeatedly called for making “the intrinsic dignity of every man and every woman the key criterion in evaluating emerging technologies.”Last month, the Vatican’s education and culture office published an introduction to a 140-page ethics handbook for the tech industry published by the Institute for Technology, Ethics, and Culture (ITEC) at California’s Santa Clara University.The World Day of Peace — instituted by St. Paul VI in 1968 — is celebrated each year on Jan. 1, the solemnity of Mary, Mother of God. The pope provides a message for the occasion, which is sent by the Vatican to foreign governments around the world.In last year’s message for the World Day of Peace, Pope Francis asked: “What did we learn from the pandemic?”“Artificial Intelligence and Peace,” will be the official theme of the 2024 World Day of Peace. The pope’s message is expected to be released publicly in early December.\n\nnull / Shutterstock Rome Newsroom, Aug 7, 2023 / 09:15 am (CNA). Spiritual worldliness is one of the most dangerous temptations facing priests and the Church because it “reduces spirituality to appearance” while disconnecting it from the Gospel, Pope Francis warned in a recently released letter to the priests of Rome.“[Spiritual worldliness] leads us to be ‘workers of the spirit,’ men clad of sacred forms that actually continue to think and act according to the fashions of the world,” the pope wrote.The pope’s message was communicated in a lengthy letter released by the Vatican on Monday but which was dated Aug. 5, the memorial of the Dedication of the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome. The pope is the bishop of Rome and wrote the letter to provide what he described as the comfort of a “fraternal encounter.”In his comments on spiritual worldliness, the pope drew heavily from the reflections of 20th-century theologian and cardinal Henri de Lubac, who wrote that the invasion of spiritual worldliness into the life of the Church would be “infinitely more disastrous than any simple moral worldliness” because spiritual worldliness “corrupts [the Church] by undermining her very principle.”Pope Francis wrote that spiritual worldliness begins to take hold in the lives of priests not only through temptations to mediocrity, power and influence, and vainglory but also “from doctrinal intransigence and liturgical aestheticism,” which have the appearance of religiosity and even loving the Church but instead seek human glory and personal well-being.“How can we fail to recognize in all of this the updated version of that hypocritical formalism which Jesus saw in certain religious authorities of the time and which in the course of public life made him suffer perhaps more than anything else?” the pope wrote.The pope also took the occasion to address more deeply one of his perennial concerns, clericalism, which he described as a “specific form” of spiritual worldliness. Pope Francis wrote that clericalism falsely gives the impression that priests are “superior, privileged, placed ‘high’ and therefore separated from the rest of God’s holy people,” which the pope said denotes “an illness that makes us lose the memory of baptism we have received.” Drawing from the prophet Ezekiel and St. Augustine, the pope also told the Roman clergy that they must not seek primarily the “milk” of material gain nor the “wool” of praise and worldly recognition, which undermines “the priestly spirit, the zeal for service, [and] the yearning for the care of the people.”The pope also critiqued a “clerical spirit” among the laity, manifested by elitism, possessiveness of one’s ministry, and an inward focus, which he said leads to the loss of joy and gratuitousness and the rise of criticism and anger.The antidote to spiritual worldliness and clericalism, the pope wrote, is “to look at Jesus crucified, to fix our eyes every day on him who emptied himself and humbled himself for us unto death.” Looking at the wounds of Jesus, Pope Francis said, helps the clergy learn “that we are called"
