        "text": "Late in the evening of October 30, Our Lady in the Icon of Czestochowa arrived in the eighth district of Berlin called Neukölln, where she stopped at the Basilica of St. John the Baptist, the largest Catholic church in Berlin. The basilica functions as the \"cathedra,\" or Episcopal seat, of the Military Ordinariate of Germany, which is immediately subject to the Holy See and provides pastoral care to Roman Catholics serving in the German Armed Forces and their families. Since the year 2004, it is also the Seat of the Polish Catholic Mission in Germany.\n\nAt 9:00 pm, the Czestochowa Icon was brought solemnly into the Basilica in a procession with children in Polish folk costumes. A word of welcome was directed to all the present by Reverend Gregory Jeżewski SDB. After a joint singing of the Jasna Gora \"Appeal\", a prayer vigil commenced, led by various groups and communities active in the Polish Catholic Mission in Berlin. The Community of the \"Light-Life Movement\" (Fos Zoe), led the Holy Rosary for the intention of the protection of human life, from conception to natural death. The members of the \"Maranatha\" schola and the \"Auxilium\" choir led the subsequent parts of the prayer vigil.\n\nAt midnight, the Liturgy of the Holy Mass was celebrated using the Mass Form dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Father Lech Hebrowski SDB presided over the Holy Liturgy. During his homily, he reminded that this peregrination is the fulfillment of the wish of the Servant of God, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski. The Primate of Poland, who lived during the difficult times of the Communist rule in Poland, repeatedly predicted that the Icon of Our Lady of Czestochowa will travel through the world, beginning with the countries of the East, touched so severely by atheization. The presider called on the faithful to stand on the side of the civilization of life and the defense of human life – especially the weakest, the unborn. He also reminded that the prayer vigil before the Icon of Our Lady of Czestochowa should be done in the spirit of reparation for sins against life, from conception to natural death, and combined with a prayer for the intention of all life. He recalled the words of the great advocate of the civilization of life, Bl. John Paul II, in his encyclical Evangelium Vitae, said: \"We are called, as never before, to be the 'people of life,' continuing at prayer, and committed to the defense of the sanctity of human life.\" At the end of the sermon, Father Hebrowski asked for the intercession of Mary, Our Most Holy Mother, for marriage and the family – where there is no peace, where people are burdened by unemployment and the lack of livelihood; for couples living in non-sacramental unions; for broken families; for Polish youth and children; for parents and catechists; for the sick and infirm; for the lonely, the abandoned, and the forgotten by their own families.\n\nThe veneration lasted through the night. The meditations were led by the following groups: Szensztak Families, Community of the Living Rosary, Worshipers of the Divine Mercy, Family of the \"Radio Maria,\" and the Apostleship of Happy Death. The vigil ended in singing \"The Hours of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary,\" conducted by the Father Tomasz Zielinski SDB. Despite the late hour, many people attended the prayer service.\n\nThe farewell ceremony of the Icon of Our Lady of Czestochowa took place on October 31 at 6:30 in the morning. The Polish Catholic Mission in Berlin hosted splendidly the Queen of Poland.\n\nIn Her journey west, the Icon of Our Lady left for St. Clemens Parish in Hannover."
