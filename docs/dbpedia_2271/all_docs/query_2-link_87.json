        "text": "By Catholic News Service\n\nVATICAN CITY (CNS) — Here are brief biographies of each of the 21 churchmen Pope Francis will induct into the College of Cardinals Aug. 27:\n\n— English Cardinal-designate Arthur Roche, 72, is prefect of the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Sacraments, an office whose task is to continue the implementation of the Second Vatican Council’s document on the liturgy, “Sacrosanctum Concilium,” he told The Tablet Feb. 24, 2022. He came to the Vatican as secretary of the then-Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments in 2012 after leading the Diocese of Leeds since 2004. He served as chairman of the International Commission on English in the Liturgy, overseeing the translation of the Latin liturgical texts into English, from 2002 to 2012.\n\nA few months after Pope Francis restored limits on the pre-Vatican II Mass with his document, “Traditionis Custodes” (“Guardians of the Tradition”), the cardinal-designate was appointed head of the congregation and given the task of implementing the document. He clarified the restrictions and told Catholic News Service in January that the document “is really a call to take the unity of the church, our being together for the celebration of the breaking of the bread and the prayer, very, very seriously indeed.”\n\nBorn in Batley Carr, Yorkshire, March 6, 1950, he was ordained to the priesthood in 1975. He helped organize the visit of St. John Paul II to York in 1982 and he was appointed general secretary of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales in 1996.\n\nHe was ordained auxiliary bishop of Westminster in 2001 and appointed coadjutor bishop of Leeds in 2002, becoming bishop of the diocese in 2004 after his predecessor’s retirement.\n\nWhen he was appointed secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments in 2012, he was elevated to the rank of archbishop. He became prefect of the dicastery in 2021.\n\n— South Korean Cardinal-designate Lazarus You Heung-sik became prefect of the then-Congregation for Clergy in 2021, making him the second prelate from Asia to head a Vatican office. Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle had been named prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in 2019.\n\nThe 70-year-old cardinal-designate had served as president of the Justice and Peace Committee of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Korea. He has traveled to communist North Korea four times and has said he hopes for lasting peace and reconciliation on the peninsula.\n\nHe was president of Caritas Korea when it got the green light from the North Korean government to coordinate and lead a major aid program with assistance from Caritas Internationalis. Caritas Korea was responsible for helping approximately 5 million poor North Koreans.\n\nAs bishop of Daejeon, he welcomed Pope Francis to the city for the sixth Asian Youth Day in 2014 and he participated in the Synod of Bishops on young people in 2018.\n\nBorn Nov. 17, 1951, in Nonsan, the cardinal-designate was baptized at the age of 16. He studied in South Korea and Rome, where he was ordained a priest in 1979 for the Diocese of Daejeon. He is active in the Focolare movement.\n\nHe was appointed coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Daejeon in 2003 and became its bishop in 2005. He was elevated to archbishop in 2021 before beginning his role as prefect at the Vatican Congregation for Clergy.\n\n— Spanish Cardinal-designate Fernando Vérgez Alzaga is president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and president of the Governorate of Vatican City State, that is, the head of the office in charge of Vatican City State operations. He is the first member of the Legionaries of Christ to become a cardinal.\n\nBorn in Salamanca March 1, 1945, he joined the Legionaries in 1965 and was ordained a priest in 1969.\n\nThe 77-year-old cardinal-designate has degrees in philosophy and theology, and a diploma as an archivist from the Vatican Secret Archives.\n\nHe began serving in the Roman Curia in 1972 and has held a number of positions, including at the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, as head of the Vatican’s Internet Office and then as director of its telecommunications and information systems.\n\nPope Francis appointed him secretary-general of the governorate in 2013 and named him to a newly formed “Commission for Reserved Matters” in 2020 as part of broad reforms to ensure financial transparency and accountability. He became head of the governorate in October 2021.\n\n— French Cardinal-designate Jean-Marc Aveline was born in Algeria but grew up in the French port city of Marseille, where the 63-year-old has been ministering his entire adulthood. After becoming a priest in 1984, he was named auxiliary bishop in 2013 and then archbishop in 2019.\n\nHe shares many of the same concerns as Pope Francis, especially regarding the plight of migrants, the need to guide and inspire young people, the risk poverty and exclusion pose in contributing to extremism, and the danger of populism.\n\nMarseille lies on the Mediterranean and is home to many immigrants, particularly from North Africa, and Muslims make up at least 35% of the population. The cardinal-designate works closely with the city’s Muslims. He was a consultor for the then-Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue from 2008 to 2012 and has headed the French bishops’ council for interreligious relations since 2017.\n\nHe founded an institute of sciences and theology of religions in Marseille in 1992 and has long supported institutions and initiatives aimed at bringing the cities and people bordering the Mediterranean closer together to find answers to common challenges, including the contributions of religions.\n\n— Nigerian Cardinal-designate Peter Ebere Okpaleke became the first bishop of Ekwulobia in 2020.\n\nBorn in Amesi, March 1, 1963, he was ordained a priest of the southern Diocese of Awka in 1992. After his ordination, he spent 20 years in a variety of ministries, including serving as a university chaplain, parish priest, administrator of diocesan finances and diocesan chancellor. After studying canon law in Rome, he joined the Canon Law Society of Nigeria and served as a judge for an interdiocesan tribunal.\n\nPope Benedict XVI appointed him bishop of Ahiara in 2012, but his formal installation was continually delayed after many laity and clergy opposed his nomination, reportedly because of his ethnicity. He was ordained a bishop more than five months after his appointment, but the ceremony was held at a seminary in another diocese because the situation in Ahiara had not improved.\n\nEven after Pope Francis in 2017 ordered local priests to pledge their obedience to the pope and accept the bishop, the situation remained tense. In early 2018, Bishop Okpaleke resigned saying, “I am convinced in conscience that my remaining the bishop of Ahiara Diocese is no longer beneficial to the church.”\n\nThe cardinal-designate told Vatican News May 31 that over the six years he was unable to administer the diocese, he took the time to “reflect, to pray and to read” for deeper discernment. Pope Francis named him bishop of the newly created Diocese of Ekwulobia in March 2020.\n\nThe 59-year-old cardinal-designate told Vatican News that he seeks to witness to the life of Jesus Christ, his truth and love, in the context of current challenges, such as poverty and exploitation, and to build a dialogue between the Gospel and culture.\n\n— Cardinal-designate Leonardo Ulrich Steiner of Manaus, Brazil, will be the first cardinal from the Brazilian Amazon. The 71-year-old Franciscan said his election to the College of Cardinals shows “how fondly Pope Francis regards the Amazon.”\n\nThe pope has repeatedly shown his concern for the region, and the appointment is a further “gesture of affection toward our churches that are in the Amazon and all the work that the Catholic Church has developed here,” he said May 29.\n\nBorn in Forquilhinha, Brazil, Nov. 6, 1950, the cardinal-designate professed his vows as a Franciscan in 1976 and was ordained a priest in 1978 by his cousin, the late Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, who was also a Franciscan and led the Archdiocese of São Paulo for 28 years.\n\nAfter serving in a parish, then-Father Steiner was on the formation staff of a seminary and was novice master from 1986 to 1995. He was secretary-general of the Pontifical Antonianum University in Rome from 1999 to 2003. He returned to Brazil and was appointed bishop and head of the Prelature of São Félix in 2005, named auxiliary bishop of Brasília in 2011 and appointed archbishop of Manaus in 2019.\n\n— Cardinal-designate Filipe Neri Ferrão, 69, is archbishop of Goa, a former Portuguese colony and now an Indian state on the Arabian Sea coast. The Times of India headline about his being named a cardinal said, “After 465 years, Archdiocese of Goa gets its first cardinal.”\n\nHe is president of the Conference of Catholic Bishops of India (CCBI) — the national episcopal conference of the bishops of the Latin rite of the Catholic Church in India — and is a member of the central committee of the Federation of Asian Bishops’ Conferences.\n\nBorn in Aldona Jan. 20, 1953, he studied at the seminary in Poona and was ordained a priest of the archdiocese in 1979. Sent to Rome, he earned a degree in biblical theology from the Pontifical Urbanian University before going to Belgium for further studies in catechesis and pastoral theology at the Lumen Vitae International Institute.\n\nNamed auxiliary bishop of Goa in 1993, he also served as vicar general of the archdiocese. From 1998 to 2002, he chaired the laity commissions of both the CCBI and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India, which includes the Latin- and Eastern-rite bishops of the country.\n\nSt. John Paul II named him archbishop of Goa in 2003, which also comes with the title “patriarch of the East Indies.”\n\nThe Indian media reported that the cardinal-designate ruffled political feathers in May when he issued a pastoral letter on charity and the social responsibilities of Indian Catholics. “While India is struck by extreme poverty, 73% of our country’s resources are controlled by 10% of the population. The existing extreme poverty is therefore the result of the rampant social injustice prevailing in the country,” he wrote.\n\n— U.S. Cardinal-designate Robert W. McElroy, a native of San Francisco, is bishop of San Diego.\n\nBorn Feb. 5, 1954, in San Francisco, he grew up in San Mateo County.\n\nThe 68-year-old cardinal-designate graduated from Harvard University in 1975 and earned a master’s degree in 1976 in American history from Stanford University, where he also later studied for a doctorate in history. He attended St. Patrick’s Seminary in Menlo Park, California, and was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of San Francisco in 1980. After ordination, parish work and serving as secretary to San Francisco Archbishop John Quinn, he pursued more studies, earning a licentiate in theology from the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley, a doctorate in moral theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and a doctorate in political science from Stanford.\n\nPope Benedict XVI named him an auxiliary bishop of San Francisco in 2010 and Pope Francis named him bishop of San Diego in 2015.\n\nHe is author of “The Search for an American Public Theology: The Contribution of John Courtney Murray,” Paulist Press, 1989; and “Morality and American Foreign Policy: The Role of Ethics in International Affairs,” Princeton University Press, 1992. He also has been published in journals and America magazine, a weekly Jesuit publication.\n\nBishop McElroy has been vocal in the U.S. bishops’ discussions about public political positions and worthiness to receive the Eucharist. In an essay published in 2021 on the website of America magazine, he wrote, “The Eucharist must never be instrumentalized for a political end, no matter how important.”\n\nThe prelate reissued a warning he gave a few months earlier at a Georgetown University online forum against “weaponization of Eucharist.” Then, Cardinal-designate McElroy said: “I do not see how depriving the president or other political leaders of Eucharist based on their public policy stance can be interpreted in our society as anything other than the weaponization of Eucharist and an effort not to convince people by argument and by dialogue and by reason, but, rather, to pummel them into submission on the issue.”\n\n— Cardinal-designate Virgílio do Carmo da Silva, 54, is archbishop of Díli, Timor-Leste — an island nation in Southeast Asia and Asia’s second-most Catholic country after the Philippines.\n\nEven though the number of the Catholics and vocations remains high, the faithful face many challenges, including high unemployment, “brain drain” and proselytism by groups such as Jehovah’s Witnesses, the cardinal-designate told Catholic News Service in 2019, when he went from being bishop to archbishop of Dili after Pope Francis elevated the territory. He was made bishop of Díli in 2016 and participated in the Synod of Bishops dedicated to young people in 2018.\n\nA member of the Salesians of St. John Bosco, he said it has been important to reimagine the role and mission of the Catholic Church, which had served as a safe space and strong political voice during the nation’s struggle for independence during a 24-year occupation by Indonesia.\n\nThe small nation is still struggling to rebuild after militants destroyed its infrastructure. As much as 42% of the population lives below the poverty line, a situation made significantly worse by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the World Bank.\n\n“Poverty and unemployment remain very high,” he had told CNS. But despite the challenges, “the number and quality of the Catholics in Timor is still strong,” especially with vocations.\n\nThe focus now must be on education, re-evangelization, being close to the people and discerning and responding to their needs, he said in a 2021 interview with Lusa, the Portuguese news agency. The church in Timor-Leste is still too “hierarchical” and it needs to be a place where everyone can feel they belong and “everyone participates in the life of the church,” he said.\n\nBorn in Venilale Nov. 27, 1967, he made his first profession of vows as a Salesian in 1990. He completed his studies in Manila, Philippines, and was ordained a priest in 1998.\n\nHe served as a novice master for the Salesians and studied spirituality at the Pontifical Salesian University in Rome. He was head of a Salesian-run technical school in Fatumaca from 2009 to 2014, and he became provincial superior of the Salesians in East Timor and Indonesia in 2015.\n\n— Italian Cardinal-designate Oscar Cantoni of Como, said, “the Lord doesn’t choose the best, but the lowly and poor.”\n\n“I am moved by this completely undeserved gift, and I entrust myself to people’s prayers,” he told Vatican News May 30, in response to news of his elevation to the College of Cardinals.\n\nThe 71-year-old cardinal-designate has focused decades of ministry on serving young people and seminarians. Education and formation are essential, he said, as they are the best ways to help people of faith discover what the Lord is calling them to do.\n\nOne of his priests, Father Roberto Malgesini, who cared for migrants, refugees and the homeless, was brutally murdered in 2020 after a mentally ill man he was helping stabbed him. Shortly after the priest’s body was found by the volunteers and migrants the priest worked with, Bishop Cantoni arrived at the scene and blessed the deceased priest. Later he referred to him as a “martyr of charity.”\n\nBorn in Lenno, Sept. 1, 1950, the cardinal-designate was ordained in 1975 as priest of the Diocese of Como and was put in charge of supporting vocations at the diocesan seminary where he would later serve many years as a spiritual director. He also headed the diocese’s vocations center and taught religion in public high schools.\n\nHe has written for publications on spirituality and books for young adults. He preaches spiritual exercises for priests, and he helped initiate the diocesan order of consecrated virgins.\n\nHe was named bishop of Crema in 2005 and bishop of Como in 2016.\n\n— Indian Cardinal-designate Anthony Poola of Hyderabad, made headlines in his home country for being the first cardinal of the Telugu people from the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and, especially, for being the first Dalit cardinal. “Dalit,” which means “trampled upon” in Sanskrit, refers to the most disadvantaged group of people under India’s former caste system — treated as untouchables and often still treated with disrespect today, including in the church at times.\n\nHe told AsiaNews May 29 that his appointment was “good news for Dalit Catholics and for the entire church in India. I believe it will bring the encouragement of Pope Francis to many.” The appointment also represents “a privilege for the Telugu region and will grow the faith of the church in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.”\n\n“It is God’s will that I accept with humility; I am not worthy. I am grateful to Pope Francis for his trust,” he said.\n\nAn editorial May 31 on the website Matters India said, “That caste is a grave concern and that it needs to be addressed is undeniable, and Archbishop Poola would have to play a significant role in bringing this into the church’s conversations and discussions and help find ways to resolve it.”\n\nJesuit Father A. X. J. Bosco, the former Jesuit provincial of Andhra Pradesh and a Dalit rights activist, told AsiaNews after Archbishop Poola was named to the College of Cardinals that “it is a great joy for the Dalits, who represent over 65% of the faithful of the Catholic Church in India,” but who hold few positions in church leadership.\n\n“Pope Francis wants the church to be synodal, to listen to everyone, including the least: now the Dalit Christians also feel that they have been heard after years of struggle,” the Jesuit priest said.\n\nThe 60-year-old cardinal-designate was born Nov. 15, 1961, in the village of Poluru and ordained a priest for the Diocese of Cuddapah in 1992. He was appointed bishop of Kurnool in 2008 and archbishop of Hyderabad in 2020.\n\nHe is known to be especially dedicated to the poor and the Dalits as well as for being an open and generous pastor. From 2001 to 2003, he did graduate studies in pastoral healthcare and theology at the Loyola University of Chicago in the United States; he was in residence at the Catholic parish in St. Joseph, Michigan, in the Diocese of Kalamazoo and served as associate pastor of St. Genevieve Church in Chicago.\n\n— Brazilian Cardinal-designate Paulo Cezar Costa of Brasília, is a theologian who helped with the preparation of World Youth Day in Rio de Janeiro in 2013 as “administrative director.”\n\nAfter hearing about his election to the College of Cardinals, the 54-year-old told Vatican News May 30 that he was grateful to Pope Francis “for the trust placed in me for the confidence in my work.”\n\nBorn in Valença in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro July 20, 1967, the cardinal-designate was ordained to the priesthood in 1992 and served in parish ministry for 12 years. He holds a doctorate in theology from Rome’s Pontifical Gregorian University and has served as an expert for several commissions and groups on doctrine.\n\nHe has worked as a diocesan seminary rector and spent many years teaching theology and heading the theology departments at important academic institutions.\n\nIn 2010, he was named auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, where he had a variety of responsibilities in administration, legal affairs and missions. He was named bishop of São Carlos in 2016 and he became archbishop of Brasília in 2020.\n\nHe has been active in the field of canon law, and has spoken often about the importance of historical and cultural heritage and the relationship of science and faith. He serves on the commission for culture and education of the Brazilian bishops’ conference, and he was elected in 2019 to the board of consulting bishops who guide the work of the Latin American bishops’ council, known by its Spanish acronym, CELAM.\n\nHe is a member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America and the Dicastery for Promoting Christian Unity.\n\n— Cardinal-designate Richard Kuuia Baawobr of Wa, Ghana, is an expert in interreligious dialogue, particularly focused on promoting understanding between Christians and Muslims, and is involved in ecumenical dialogue and cooperation with other Christian churches.\n\nHe told Ghana News Agency May 30 the news of his elevation came as a surprise because had just been in Rome to attend a meeting at the former Pontifical Council of Promoting Christian Unity as a member of that dicastery “and nobody said anything. I did not suspect anything.”\n\nHe said he never suspected his name would be among the new cardinals “because in my understanding, it is archbishops who are appointed as cardinals, not the bishops who are in a diocese.”\n\nThe greatness of being a Christian is serving God and humanity, not in having titles, he said. “What is important is to serve other people with joy.”\n\nBorn June 21, 1959, in Tom-Zendagangn, he joined the Missionaries of Africa in 1981 and was ordained a priest in 1987. He pursued his studies in Fribourg, Switzerland and London, and studied scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome.\n\nAs a member of the Missionaries of Africa, he served in Congo for four years before heading to Tanzania, where he served in formation for three years. He was the director of formation for his order in France from 1999 to 2004.\n\nIn 2004, he was elected assistant to the superior general of the order in Rome, where he worked for six years before being elected in 2010 to a six-year term as superior of the order. As superior, he also was vice chancellor of the Pontifical Institute for Arabic and Islamic Studies in Rome from 2010 to 2016. The men’s Union of Superior Generals elected him a member of the Synod of Bishops on the family in 2015.\n\nWhen his term as superior general ended, in 2016 Pope Francis appointed him to lead the Diocese of Wa, where he has been promoting greater public awareness about mental illnesses and outreach by laity and experts to help provide care to those with mental illness who live on the street.\n\n— Cardinal-designate William Goh Seng Chye, 64, will be Singapore’s first cardinal.\n\nBorn June 25, 1957, in Singapore to Chinese parents and fluent in Mandarin, he will also be the only ethnic Chinese prelate among the cardinal electors; Cardinal John Tong Hon, retired bishop of Hong Kong, turned 80 in 2019.\n\nThe elevation of the archbishop of Singapore to the College of Cardinals reflects “the small but very active” role the church plays in a country where Catholics are a minority but are very much involved with the local and immigrant communities, according to AsiaNews. Catholics number about 300,000 out of a population of 5.6 million, it said.\n\nThe cardinal-designate is “deeply humbled by this new appointment of the Holy Father” and “is conscious that this honor and new responsibility conferred on him is also a recognition of the contribution of the faithful in the archdiocese for helping him to build a vibrant, evangelizing and missionary church,” the Archdiocese of Singapore said in a statement on its website May 29.\n\nThe cardinal-designate was ordained a priest in 1985 after completing his studies in Singapore and at the Pontifical Urbanian University in Rome, followed by studies in dogmatic theology at Rome’s Pontifical Gregorian University.\n\nBack in Singapore, he was a formator and lecturer at the St. Francis Xavier Major Seminary from 1992 to 2005. He became rector of the seminary in 2005 and spiritual director of the Catholic Spirituality Center.\n\nHe was named coadjutor archbishop of Singapore in 2012 and appointed archbishop in 2013.\n\nOne of his priorities has been engaging with young people to understand their aspirations and see how they can contribute to the life of the church, according to ucanews.com. He wants to broaden the scope and effectiveness of communication and understanding within church structures so people may grow in unity and peace, it added.\n\n— Cardinal-designate Adalberto Martínez Flores of Asunción, Paraguay, will be his country’s first cardinal. The 70-year-old prelate was ordained to the transitional diaconate and to the priesthood by now-Cardinal Seán P. O’Malley of Boston after having worked with him in the 1970s at the Spanish Catholic Center in Washington, D.C., while studying philosophy at Oblate College.\n\nBorn in Asunción July 8, 1951, he studied economics at the National University of Asunción, before traveling to the United States to perfect his English and begin philosophy studies. He then went to Rome, studying at the Pontifical Lateran University and living with a Focolare community, studying its spirituality and emphasis on promoting unity.\n\nHe was ordained to the priesthood in Asunción Aug. 24, 1985, for the Diocese of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands; then-Bishop O’Malley was the head of the diocese. Father Martínez served at parishes in St. Croix and in St. Thomas from 1985 to 1994.\n\nIncardinated into the Archdiocese of Asunción, he was a parish priest there for three years before St. John Paul II named him an auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese in 1997. He worked with the archdiocesan youth movement and served as secretary of the first archdiocesan synod.\n\nIn 2000, St. John Paul made him the first bishop of the new Diocese of San Lorenzo. He became bishop of San Pedro in 2007 and, in 2012, was named military ordinary for Paraguay. He served exclusively as the bishop for the armed forces until 2018 when Pope Francis named him bishop of Villarrica del Espíritu Santo.
