Westwood Studios, formerly known as Westwood Associates, was an American video game development company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. They merged with Virgin Interactive in 1992 but remained a separate entity, able to publish its own video games with the aid of Virgin's distribution network and established their fame with Command & Conquer, a milestone in the real-time strategy genre.

In 1998, Electronic Arts bought Westwood for $122.5 million USD. Reportedly not impressed with Westwood's 2003 PC game, Command & Conquer: Renegade, EA liquidated the company in 2003, and the Westwood brand now ceases to exist. Electronic Arts themselves would assume production over Westwood Studio's properties, namely Command & Conquer.
