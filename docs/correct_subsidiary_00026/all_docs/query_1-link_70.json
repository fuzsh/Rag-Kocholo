        "text": "Essays 26 August 2022, 16:48\n\nauthor: Darius Matusiak\n\nWestwood Studios. Iconic gamedev studios of the 90s that vanished\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWestwood was founded in 1985; first as Brelous Software, it quickly rebranded as Westwood Associates and later, in 1992, as Westwood Studios after being acquired by the publisher Virgin Games. Today, we mainly remember them for the wonderful Command & Conquer series of strategies, which launched the real-time strategy genre to the group of accessible, mainstream hits. Slightly older veterans still remember the predecessor of the C&C series, i.e. the extremely successful Dune II, in which the plot from Frank Herbert's books was neatly captured in the form of a strategy game.\n\nWestwood is not only an RTS, but also an excellent RPG. One of the studio's first successes was the 1991 Eye of the Beholder, licensed by Dungeons & Dragons. Another popular series is Lands of Lore, one of the studio's greatest commercial successes, and the adventure game The Legend of Kyrandia. Other well-known titles include The Lion King platformer, licensed from the famous Disney movie, and the well-received adventure game Blade Runner, which tells an original story that happens parallel to the events of Ridley Scott's movie.\n\nHow did the studio disappear?"
