        "text": "[Copied from the official C&C forums]\n\nLast updated 07/05 '13\n\nMost of this is meant for the First Decade and original versions but a lot of this should apply to The Ultimate Collection too.\n\nTO KEEP PLAYING THE OLD GAMES ONLINE SEE THIS POST HERE OR THIS POST HERE FOR INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO\n\nDO NOT REPLY TO THIS THREAD WITH YOUR PROBLEMS BUT MAKE A NEW THREAD\n\nWhen posting with a problem, remember to state your OS, which game your problem applies to and which version of the game you're running, ie. an original game, The First Decade version or The Ultimate Collection!\n\nCTRL+F to search for keywords is your friend! This around 8,000 words long so scrolling through all of it to search for your problem is not going to be a fun endeavor.\n\nAlso, if your problem is about the serial code or payment then contact EA customer support, we can't help you.\n\nMouse Pointer disappearing in the Ultimate Collection? Disable mouse trails in Windows to fix it.\n\nNote: Vista/7 Users should install the game in Admin mode, to do this run Windows Explorer then browse to your DVD drive,\n\nright click on Setup.exe -> Properties -> Compatibility > Tick \"Run This Program as an Administrator\". Also please install DrectX 9c for Windows Vista (32bit & 64bit)/Windows 7 (32bit) from the following link:\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/e...displaylang=en\n\nFor Windows 7 64bit download & install the DirectX SDK from March 2008:\n\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/download/en...ng=en&id=10568\n\nLoad up both the 32bit and 64bit DirectX Control Panels and enable Hardware Acceleration:\n\nStart -> All Programs -> Microsoft DirectX SDK (March 2008) -> DirectX Utilities -> DirectX Control Panel -> DirectDraw -> Tick \"Hardware Acceleration\" -> Click OK\n\nStart -> All Programs -> Microsoft DirectX SDK (March 2008) -> DirectX Utilities (64-Bit) -> DirectX Control Panel -> DirectDraw -> Tick \"Hardware Acceleration\" -> Click OK\n\nThis will mean that all the older versions of DirectX are correctly installed and should avoid problems (mainly with Renegade) of games loading and not showing anything but a black screen.\n\nThe methods and tools in this text are intended to fix problems and get the games running properly.\n\nNote that most of the fixes on this page are files you need to put in your game folder. The default TFD installation folder is:\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\EA Games\\Command & Conquer The First Decade\\\"\n\nIf it's not there, simply right-click on the TFD launcher link on your desktop, go to Properties and see which directory it launches from. That should be the sub-folder \"Launcher\"\n\nof the main TFD install folder. There should be a \"Find Target\" button to go right to that location. If you go one directory up from there you end up in the main install folder.\n\nIn there you will find a folder for each of the games, and a few more for the TFD launcher, patches and internet files.\n\nUnofficial 1.03 Patch\n\nThis patch contains most of the fixes listed in this thread, get it here:\n\nhttp://cnp.cncnz.com/tfd/\n\nor alternatively here:\n\nhttp://cnc-comm.com/community/index....a=view;down=16\n\nNote: This patch includes files which cause problems with Internet play in TS, RA2 & YR, please check those sections after installing for the solutions to these problems.\n\nNyerguds' guide to installing & patching TFD:\n\nhttp://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/...lling_tfd.html\n\n(note that this is mostly just the manual way of applying all fixes that are in patch 1.03)\n\nGeneral fixes:\n\nGames won't run in Vista/7: Vista/7 users should take ownership of the TFD main folder. To do this, right click on the \"Command & Conquer The First Decade\" folder,\n\ngo to Properties -> Security -> Advanced -> Owner -> Edit -> Select your username -> Tick \"Replace Owner\" box -> Apply.\n\nVista/7 users should also disable User Account Control:\n\nStart -> Control Panel -> User Accounts -> Turn User Account Control On Or Off -> Untick \"Use User Account Control\" -> OK -> Restart\n\nBusiness & Ultimate users:\n\nStart -> Control Panel -> Classic View -> Administrative Tools -> Local Security Policy -> Local Polices -> Security Options ->\n\nUser Account Control: Behaviour of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode -> Change to: Elevate without prompting\n\nUser Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode. Change to: Disable\n\n-> Restart\n\nGames won't install:\n\nCheck that your DVD-ROM supports dual-layered disc's - to do this, go to\n\nControl Panel > System > Device Manager (Vista/7)\n\nControl Panel > System > Hardware > Device Manager (XP)\n\ncopy the model name of the DVD-ROM into Google (or any other search engine) and look for a site that lists its specifications.\n\n\"Autorun.exe is not a valid Win32 Application\" errors can be fixed by removing InCd - it seems to cause conflicts with the security part of the DVD-ROM.\n\nCyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) errors can be solved by booting into safe mode and installing the game from there (log on as the administrator account).\n\nYou could also copy the entire disc contents to a folder on your HD and see if it'll install from there.\n\nIf you have 2 DVD-ROMs on the same Data cable that can be the problem, Put one of the DVD-ROMs onto the same data cable as you Hard Drive.\n\nThis only applies to IDE (PATA) devices where there is only one hard drive and two DVD-ROMS.\n\nIf you get An Error {-5004 : 0x80070002} has occurred or similar error then reinstall the InstallShield software:\n\nHold the windows key on your keyboard and press the r button > The Run dialogue should appear > Type C:\\Program Files\\Common Files into the text box and click OK\n\nRight-click the InstallShield folder, and select Rename > Change the name to InstallShieldOld > Start the game installation again to reinstall the InstallShield components with the newest version.\n\nIf the install succeeds after this then delete the InstallShieldOld folder.\n\n\"Incorrect CD-ROM\" errors - if you have emulation software like Demon Tools or Alcohol 120% then make sure you don't have more than 1 virtual drive.\n\nYou could also try removing the software too in \"Add/Remove Programs\" (XP) or \"Programs & Features\" (Vista/7) in control panel.\n\nNote: The TFD Launcher program can be the cause of these errors (especially on Vista/7) so try making shortcuts to the games instead. The xcc shortcut installer will do this for you:\n\nhttp://xhp.xwis.net/utilities/XCC_TF..._Installer.exe\n\nGames crash on dual core machines: If you have a dual core CPU, and games seem to crash for no reason, start the game\n\nand press CTRL ALT DEL (For XP Pro select Task Manager!), right click on the game's .exe process, click \"set affinity\", and deselect one CPU.\n\nForceCore is a small program that automates this process:\n\nhttp://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/.../forcecore.zip\n\nVideo's hang: On some systems Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert, Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 can hang with repeating sound in the first\n\nsecond of video, this often means it is impossible to get past the Westwood Studios logo. To fix this run Dxdiag and disable Sound acceleration\n\nStart > Run > type dxdiag > OK > Sound > Hardware Sound Acceleration Level - Move slider until on 'No Acceleration'\n\nPicture Guide: http://www.cncworld.org/?page=features/tutorials/tdhang\n\nSpecific game fixes:\n\nCommand & Conquer 1 (TD/C&C1/C&C95):\n\nC&C95 1.06 patch:\n\nA number of patches were made to fix errors in C&C95. This patch is a combination of all of these plus some extra fixes by Nyerguds:\n\nhttp://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/cnc95upd/cc95p106/\n\nOnline play:\n\nUse CnCNet to play online, it fully supports Nyerguds 1.06 patch & allows up to 6 players:\n\nhttp://cncnet.org/\n\nfast scrolling bug fix in C&C95:\n\nGo to your C&C1 directory, run ccsetup.exe and enable Back Buffer in Video Memory.\n\nIf that doesn't work or makes the game stutter, try CPU Grabber instead:\n\nhttp://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/...s.html#cpugrab\n\nDisplay problems (e.g.: \"Unable to set the video mode\"):\n\nGo to your C&C directory, run ccsetup.exe and set the screen resolution to 640x480 (or, with the 1.06 patch, 1024x768 )\n\nAlso try changing the refresh rate on your monitor to 60 Hertz:\n\nControl Panel > Display > Settings > Advanced > Monitor (XP)\n\nControl Panel > Personalization > Display Settings > Advanced Settings > Monitor (Vista)\n\nIf you have scrambled colours running the game on Windows 7 then try the following fix:\n\nDownload ddraw.dll from this location:\n\nhttp://hifi.iki.fi/cnc-ddraw/#download\n\nand place it in your 'Command & Conquer' folder (same folder as C&C95.exe).\n\nOther Solutions to the scrambled colours in Windows 7:\n\nYou need to be using Nyerguds's 1.06c for this, if you're not, you'll need to update the ID field on your own. Open Notepad and paste whichever one of these corresponds to the version of Windows 7 you're running:\n\n32-bit:\n\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\DirectDraw\\C ompatibility\\Command & Conquer Gold 1.06b r2]\n\n\"Flags\"=hex:00,08,00,00\n\n\"Name\"=\"C&C95.exe\"\n\n\"ID\"=hex:d5,83,dd,32\n\n64-bit:\n\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\ DirectDraw\\Compatibility\\Command & Conquer Gold 1.06b r2]\n\n\"Flags\"=hex:00,08,00,00\n\n\"Name\"=\"C&C95.exe\"\n\n\"ID\"=hex:d5,83,dd,32\n\nFile -> Save, choose All Files from the save as type pulldown menu, and save it with the extension .reg. Double click on it, confirm that you want to add the key, and give C&C a try. The Westwood intro video may still have the wrong colors (this seems random, sometimes it's fine, usually it's not), but the game and the rest of the videos will be fine. If you have your wallpaper set to slideshow, you'll still get messed up colors when your wallpaper changes. This will last until the end of any video that was playing, but will only cause a brief flicker in the actual game.\n\nIf you need to update the ID for whatever reason (new version of the C&C95 patch, fix for Red Alert or another game), run the game and then check this registry key:\n\n32-bit:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\DirectDraw\\M ostRecentApplication\n\n64-bit:\n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\ DirectDraw\\MostRecentApplication\n\nThe ID in that key is four bytes. Reverse their order, and place them between commas like in the keys above. 32dd83d5 becomes d5,83,dd,32. Use that in place of the ID in the keys I posted, change the filename to the correct one for whatever game you are trying to run, and give the key a unique name.\n\n1. Kill explorer.exe before running RA1, below is a batch file which does this for you:\n\ntaskkill /f /IM explorer.exe\n\nC:\\\"Program Files\"\\\"EA Games\"\\\"Command & Conquer The First Decade\"\\\"Command & Conquer(tm)\"\\\"C&C95.exe\"\n\nstart explorer.exe\n\nIf you're on 64-bit:\n\ntaskkill /f /IM explorer.exe\n\nC:\\\"Program Files (x86)\"\\\"EA Games\"\\\"Command & Conquer The First Decade\"\\\"Command & Conquer(tm)\"\\\"C&C95.exe\"\n\nstart explorer.exe\n\nYou may need to replace the install directory if it is not the default. To use the batch file, make a notepad document, paste in the text, and save it as a .bat file.\n\n2. Right click on your desktop and click on \"Screen Resolution\" and leave it open (do not minimise). Run the TFD\n\nlauncher and start the game, or click on the shortcut for RA1.\n\n3. Browse to your C&C1 directory, right click on C&C95.exe > Properties > Compatibility > Tick Run in 256 Colors, 640x480 Res, and use Win98/Me compat mode > OK.\n\nRed Alert 1 (RA1/RA95):\n\nRed Alert's v3.03 patch updates Red Alert to the most recent version:\n\nhttp://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/...ra303patch.exe\n\nSavegames for RA1 3.03:\n\nhttp://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/...s/svwra303.zip\n\nLAN Play patch for RA 3.03:\n\nhttp://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/...patch_1_00.zip\n\nOnline play:\n\nCnCNet is now also available for Redalert, for more information & download instructions visit:\n\nhttp://cncnet.org/\n\nfast scrolling bug fix in RA1:\n\nBrowse to your RA1 directory, run rasetup.exe and enable Back Buffer in Video Memory.\n\nIf that doesn't work or makes the game stutter, try CPU Grabber instead:\n\nhttp://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/...s.html#cpugrab\n\n\"Unable To Read Scenario\" error in the Giant Ant missions can be fixed with this patch:\n\nhttp://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/...ntmissions.rar\n\nAlternate version with mission briefing video for the first mission:\n\nhttp://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/...ntbriefing.rar\n\nRA1 dagger movie palette correction: only use if you notice the Dagger movie had weird coloured pixels in it.\n\nhttp://frankaz.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/cncfilez/bmap.cab\n\nDisplay problems (e.g.: \"Unable to set the video mode\"):\n\nGo to your C&C directory, run rasetup.exe and set the screen resolution to 640x480.\n\nAlso try changing the refresh rate on your monitor to 60 Hertz:\n\nControl Panel > Display > Settings > Advanced > Monitor (XP)\n\nControl Panel > Personalization > Display Settings > Advanced Settings > Monitor (Vista)\n\nIf you have scrambled colours running the game on Windows 7 then try the following fix:\n\nDownload ddraw.dll from this location:\n\nhttp://hifi.iki.fi/cnc-ddraw/#download\n\nand place it in your 'Command & Conquer Red Alert(tm)' folder (same folder as ra95.exe).\n\nOther Solutions to the scrambled colours in Windows 7:\n\nYou need to be using the 3.03 beta patch for this, if you're not, you'll need to update the ID field on your own.
