Westwood Studios has since been acquired by Electronic Arts and I would like to know if I could start a business selling the game without doing anything illegal.\n\nHow similar can the remake be to the original one? Can any copyright or trademark(s) be infringed, such as tank/structure designs or anything like that?\n\nNote: I am excluding soundtracks from the list of things that I'd like to remake.\n\nIdeas (methods of playing, game mechanics, strategy, goals) cannot be protected by copyright. But any part of a creative work can.\n\nSo, no copying of drawings, patterns, images, sounds, or the element. I suppose copying the software code is not an issue here, but it can, obviously, also not be copied. And nothing in your game can look like someone's else trademark.\n\nanswered Feb 27, 2016 at 20:20\n\nQuora FeansQuora Feans\n\n60644 silver badges1414 bronze badges"
