        "text": "Westwood Studios was founded in 1985 by Brett Sperry and Louis Castle. It became a prominent name in the video game industry through its innovative and genre-defining titles. One of their earliest successes was Eye of the Beholder, a first-person RPG that set the standard for dungeon crawlers. However, it was Dune II: The Battle For Arrakis in 1992 that truly made an impact, often considered the blueprint for modern real-time strategy (RTS) games due to its resource management and unit control mechanics.\n\nFollowing Dune II, Westwood released Command & Conquer in 1995, which further cemented their status in the RTS genre. This game introduced a gripping narrative, full-motion video cutscenes, and a choice between two distinct factions, the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod. The success of Command & Conquer led to numerous sequels and spin-offs, including Command & Conquer: Red Alert, which was praised for its alternate history storyline and multiplayer features.\n\nIn addition to their RTS successes, Westwood developed an RPG series that showcased their versatility: Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos was well-received for its engaging story and gameplay mechanics. Another notable title was Blade Runner, an adventure game based on the 1982 film, which stood out for its atmospheric graphics and non-linear story.\n\nWestwood also experimented with different genres, as seen in The Legend Of Kyrandia, a point-and-click adventure series known for its humor and puzzle design. Despite their varied portfolio, their RTS games defined Westwood's legacy.\n\nIn 1998, Electronic Arts acquired Westwood Studios, leading to increased production and eventual closure in 2003. Key team members later formed Petroglyph Games, continuing their influence in the industry."
