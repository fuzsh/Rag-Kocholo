        "text": "At the time of its liquidation, Westwood employed a third of the original Westwood Studios personnel, some of whom formed in April 2003. Another three (Brett Sperry,\n\nWe really like the “entertainment meets professional” character of Westwood CA (in L.A.) and the attraction of the area to teens and young adults felt like the perfect fit for a new company specializing in entertainment software. Even back then we recognized that it took a team of people to make great products so we appended the “Associates” to emphasize that aspect of product development. We were not really sure if we could make a go at game development so the original name “Westwood Associates” also gave us the ability to get into more traditional business software if necessary.\n\nOne of the company’s first great successes was Eye of the Beholder (1990), a real-time role-playing video game based on the Dungeons & Dragons license, developed for SSI. Other publishers of early Westwood games included Infocom and Disney. Their company was eventually acquired by Virgin Interactive in 1992.[4]\n\nThe company in the late 1980s was known for shipping products late, but by 1993 it had so improved that, Computer Gaming World reported, “many publishers would assure [us] that a project was going to be completed on time because Westwood was doing it”. The magazine added that it “not only has a solid reputation for getting product out on time, but a reputation for good product”, citing Eye of the Beholder, The Legend of Kyrandia, and Dune II as examples. By then Westwood had about 50 employees, including up to 20 artists.[3]Other well-known Westwood titles from the early 1990s include Lands of Lore and Westwood’s greatest commercial success, the 1995 real-time strategy game Command & Conquer. Building on the gameplay and interface ideas of Dune II, it added pre-rendered 3D graphics for gameplay sprites and video cinematics, an alternative pop/rock soundtrack with techno elements streamed from disk, and modem play. Command & Conquer, Kyrandia, and Lands of Lore all spawned multiple sequels.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nWestwood is best known for developing real-time strategy, adventure and role-playing genres. It was listed in Guinness World Recordsfor selling more than 10 million copies of Command & Conquer worldwide. The last former Westwood employee quit working for Electronic Arts after the release of Command & Conquer"
