        "text": "A VQA file is video used in a Westwood Studios video game. It contains a scene played within a game. VQA files were most notably used in early entries in the Command & Conquer video game series.\n\nFounded in 1985, Westwood Studios produced a number of successful video games before being acquired by Electronic Arts in 1998. Most notably, Westwood Studios published:\n\nThe Command & Conquer series\n\nMonopoly\n\nDune II\n\nBlade Runner\n\nThe Legend of Kyrandia series\n\nMany of these games used Vector Quantized Animation (VQA) videos for their in-game cutscenes. Different games used differently-formatted VQA files, as Westwood Studios updated the VQA format over time.\n\nBecause VQA files are uncommon, most popular media players cannot play them. However, you can play VQA files in VLC media player, and you can convert them to a more usable video format using FFmpeg."
