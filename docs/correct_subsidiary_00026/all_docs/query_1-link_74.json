        "text": "Westwood Studios presents Nox Quest\n\nCooperative adventuring enhancement to be released in July\n\nLAS VEGAS, June 9, 2000 - The fans demanded it, and now Westwood(tm) is delivering it. Nox Quest, the free enhancement for Nox(tm), will add cooperative multiplay to the best-selling action-RPG. Nox Quest will be available for free download from Westwood Online(sm) this July.\n\nThe enhancement will allow 1 to 6 players to adventure together through a variety of exotic settings, fighting a menagerie of bizarre creatures and collecting powerful magical items. The Nox Quest game never ends, but continues to challenge players with ever more difficult adventures. Once the party survives one quest, the next will contain tougher monsters who deal more damage than the last.\n\nPlayers will adventure through intricately designed maps such as the Castle of Pain, the Dark Crypts, the Bandit's Forest, the Underworld, the Dismal Swamp, the Mana Mines, the Land of the Dead, and the Ancient Ruins.\n\nEach of these maps contain many hidden and secret areas. In addition, all of the items found on these maps are randomly distributed, including spells, warrior skills, weapons, armor, and magical artifacts. Players will collect these items and become more powerful as they continue to adventure.\n\nPlayers make their way through Quest maps fighting hordes of monsters, avoiding hazards, solving puzzles, and searching for secret areas. In Nox Quest, the evil sorceress Hecubah has constructed Summoning Obelisks throughout the world, which spawn a ceaseless horde of fiendish beasts. Your group must destroy each obelisk to end the invasion of bloodthirsty creatures.\n\nAlso, Hecubah and her Necromancer minions may make cameo appearances from time to time, if she thinks the adventuring party is getting a little too confident.\n\nNox is a game of savage combat and sneaky tactics set in a mystical land filled with discovery and deceit. Nox's lightning-fast action is fueled by a combat system that's easy to use yet gives players tremendous gameplay depth and infinite possibilities. With more than 100 unique spells and weapons, players must use their wits to create devious combinations and tricky tactics.\n\nThe battle happens in the world of Nox, which Westwood's game designers have filled with intricate detail. The top down viewpoint gives players an expansive view of the world. True line of sight means never knowing what's around the next corner, creating an intense level of suspense.\n\nThe single player game will take gamers through the three lands of Nox, pitting you against vicious monsters and powerful wizards. Driven by an epic story, you'll progress up skill levels and learn three schools of combat: the way of the Warrior, the knowledge of Conjurer, and the disciplines of the Wizard.\n\nEven before the Nox Quest cooperative enhancement add-on, the game offered an intense multiplayer experience with five multiplayer options: death matches (teams and free-for all melees), Capture the Flag, King of the Realm and Flag Ball. Multiplay is supported through Westwood Online, an online gaming service with more than a million members.\n\nMuch more information about Nox can be found at www.westwood.com. The website is updated regularly with news, the latest art, and downloads.\n\nWestwood Studios is a prominent publisher of best-selling PC, and next-generation console games.
