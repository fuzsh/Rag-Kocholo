        "text": "In light of EA Partners' just-announced deal with Insomniac, we're revisiting a story from Game Informer Magazine that details the origins and philosophy of Electronic Arts' deal-sealing branch.\n\nBack in our August 2009 issue (#196), EA was more than happy to talk about all of the high-profile developers it had landed. In that issue I wrote a story on EA Partners and the game they were most proud of at the time, id Software's Rage. Obviously some things have changed since then. ZeniMax Media bought id and eventually obtained the rights to publish from EA. One of Starbreeze's two EA titles was canned. The Epic/People Can Fly project was revealed as Bulletstorm. But the huge deal with Insomniac confirms that EA Partners' momentum is still very much on track. Read on for a look at the state of EA Partners as of last year.\n\nAbove: EA Partners general manager David DeMartini (orange chair) and EA CEO John Riccitiello (far right) spearhead partnerships with some of the industry's best and brightest\n\nAltered Beast\n\nValve, id, Epic, Harmonix, Crytek, Starbreeze, Double Fine, Grasshopper. The list of top-tier developers working with Electronic Arts’ publishing branch EA Partners is impressive, and gamers reap the benefits of this partnership with a steady stream of great titles. But how did EA overcome its reputation as an IP-devouring corporate beast to become the champion of independence?\n\nWhether it’s acquiring shares of Ubisoft, buying up exclusive sports licenses, or attempting a hostile takeover of Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts certainly knows how to craft an image as a corporate monolith. But for over a decade the company has been working behind the scenes to cultivate talent in the little guys they’re supposed to be crushing.\n\nIt’s easy to assume that EA Partners has only been around for a few years. The third-party publishing wing of Electronic Arts didn’t really push the name all that much until promoting a string of top-tier games like Rock Band, The Orange Box, and Crysis in 2007. Now EAP takes its own slice of EA press conferences for big partner announcements and holds its own press events separate from the internal catalog. The division has actually been around in the background for quite some time under the former moniker of EA Distribution. To initially head the division, EA found someone with plenty of experience in the business of signing top talent.\n\nBy 1997, Tom Frisina had co-founded and left two game companies, Accolade and Three-Sixty. His list of big hits included Hardball, Mean 18, Test Drive, and Harpoon. But he bowed out of Accolade due to disagreements with the other owners and Three-Sixty “wound down” in 1994. Frisina worked as a consultant for three years following until he got a call from a business that had invested in Three-Sixty in the past: Electronic Arts.\n\n“’Why don’t you stop your consulting business and do for Electronic Arts what you were doing on the outside when you were running Accolade and Three-Sixty?’” Frisina recalls them asking. “Essentially forming relationships with successful developers around the world, and building and publishing games.”\n\nEA Redwood Shores, the home of EA Partners\n\nIt didn’t take long for Frisina to settle into his position at the subdivision called EA Distribution (EAD). “After being there for two or three weeks, I said, ‘I think what you guys really want me to do is to focus on product categories that EA Studios is not that successful at building,’” Frisina says. “Goldeneye had just come out shortly before that on the N64 and was a runaway global hit on that platform, but EA didn’t know how to build a first-person shooter at that point – or role-playing games. I said, ‘That’s where I think EAD ought to focus.’”\n\nHe signed his first deal with Looking Glass studios for two projects: Flight Unlimited III and Irrational Games’ System Shock 2. Not long after, he locked down the James Bond rights and teamed EA with MGM Interactive. After a few months of working with the studio, Frisina became familiar with the rest of MGM’s lineup and offered his professional opinion. “I encouraged David Bishop, the leader of MGM Interactive, to kill those four titles – because I and my cohorts at EA didn’t see any return on the investment of all the money they were putting in – and to focus all of their energy on building Tomorrow Never Dies.” MGM followed suit and appreciated the frank business advice. Frisina used the momentum to pursue more deals.\n\nEA had a previous deal running with Dreamworks Interactive, publishing The Lost World: Jurassic Park 1997 to modest success, but the two companies had a rough time agreeing on the next project. “EA wasn’t really very interested in carrying on a relationship with DreamWorks because they weren’t doing the kind of things the studio wanted to do,” Frisina recalls. “So they said, ‘Why don’t you take over the relationship with DreamWorks and see if you can create something bigger?’” Frisina kicked around some ideas with the developer until they hit a clear winner. “‘Steven Spielberg wants to make a video game version of Saving Private Ryan. What do you guys think about that?’” Frisina remembers. “Well I thought that was just a s--- hot idea.” Medal of Honor opened to tremendous success, and EA later bought DreamWorks Interactive.\n\nFrisina’s next big project came out of a meeting with Swedish developer DICE. “I saw what Battlefield 1942 was looking like in prototype form and I flipped out and thought that this was going to be the next great thing for the industry,” Frisina says. EAD signed a deal with DICE in 2000, releasing Battlefield 1942 and Battlefield Vietnam to huge sales before acquiring the developer outright in 2004.\n\nSeveral years and game deals later, then-President and COO of EA John Riccitiello pushed for a new name for EA Distribution. “It became apparent to John when I started reporting to him in 2003 that we needed to make this EAD thing a much more global entity, more than just an offshoot of the distribution business,” Frisina says. “We needed to call it something more appropriate. I talked to my cohorts in Europe, Australia, and Japan, and we came up with the name EA Partners.” The change was subtle, yet fitting as it more accurately reflected the business philosophy of creating partnerships with talented developers based on mutual interests. “We didn’t change anything in terms of the personnel, business model, or mission,” Frisina says. “We just changed the name.”\n\nIn 2003, John Riccitiello started making grand claims about EA Partners, stating he anticipated raising the revenue up to a billion dollars by leveraging relationships with huge independent developers normally wary of working with publishing juggernauts. But before he delivered on his promise, Riccitiello left the company in 2004 to create Elevation Partners, a private equity firm that invested in new intellectual properties in the entertainment space.\n\nCHANGING COURSE\n\nWith the main advocate of EA Partners gone, the company focus swung back to internal development, leaving many of the partners frustrated. “With EA, personally we found the situation unworkable,” said Oddworld Inhabitants co-founder and president Lorne Lanning in issue 194 of Game Informer. “We found that if the publishers don’t own your IP, they don’t have any incentive to push your game…That’s not a business relationship. That’s a master-slave relationship – one that we had no interest in continuing.”\n\nIn the same year Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath was released (2005), EAP landed a major coup, working out a distribution deal with Valve after the developer had a falling out with Vivendi Universal. The partnership continues to this day, with nearly a dozen games released. “EAP’s ability to work uniquely with third-party developers is perhaps its greatest strength,” says Valve marketing VP Doug Lombardi. “For every developer, the range of valuable services a publisher can offer from its global operation will vary. However, EAP is one of very few organizations inside of any leading publisher that is specifically designed to be extremely flexible in this regard and still able to leverage a worldwide and world-class organization.”"
