        "text": "Command & Conquer, real-time war strategy electronic game series first released in 1995 by the American game developer Westwood Studios. Initially using the engaging Dune II (1992) as its model, the groundbreaking Command & Conquer franchise has produced a number of primary spin-offs and sequels, setting a new standard for longevity and consistency in a gaming series.\n\nThe original release in the series, Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn, pitted the Global Defense Initiative of the United Nations against the rogue Brotherhood of Nod. Both factions were after Tiberium, an otherworldly resource that sucked up nutrients in the ground and formed large crystals that could be harvested. Players gathered Tiberium crystals to build various structures, allowing them to produce different types of soldiers and war vehicles. Using the terrain, unit matchups, and formations, opposing armies fought in a variety of scenarios. The game allowed a single player to progress through a series of missions or multiple players to wage war together online."
