        "text": "This short article is in need of work. You can help Sega Retro by adding to it.\n\nWestwood Studios, formerly known as Westwood Associates, was an American video game development company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. They merged with Virgin Interactive in 1992 but remained a separate entity, able to publish its own video games with the aid of Virgin's distribution network and established their fame with Command & Conquer, a milestone in the real-time strategy genre.\n\nIn 1998, Electronic Arts bought Westwood for $122.5 million USD. Reportedly not impressed with Westwood's 2003 PC game, Command & Conquer: Renegade, EA liquidated the company in 2003, and the Westwood brand now ceases to exist. Electronic Arts themselves would assume production over Westwood Studio's properties, namely Command & Conquer.\n\nSoftography\n\nReferences"
