It has the resources and vision to develop its version of the metaverse, which will be a mix of video games and a gamified social media experience.\n\nNintendo\n\nWhat more needs to be said about Nintendo? Their wide array of game franchises and loveable characters speak better to their track record than anyone could ever put into words.\n\nMost recently recorded, their revenue was $9.9 billion. Recent projects funded like the Nintendo Switch, Mario Odyssey, and Splatoon 2 have further solidified their valuable hold on gaming. Metacritic has them sitting at 76.4%. Things are only getting better for Nintendo at this point; they really can’t fail.\n\nSony\n\nSony is truly a powerhouse. With great sales with the PS4 and a recent earning of $16.5 billion, Sony is sitting pretty at the top of many lists.\n\nTheir recent release of God of War in 2018 was a major windfall for the publisher and further showed that they are a force to be reckoned with. Metacritic scoring is 71.8%.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft has, in the past, taking the blame for its somewhat clumsy approach to marketing the Xbox One and its catalog, but it didn’t make a dent in sales.\n\nMicrosoft is earning $10.4 billion and shows a determination and tenacity going into the future that other publishers better watch out for. The only negative of their year was disappointing reviews and sales of the then anticipated Sea of Thieves, which currently has a user score of 4.1—yikes.\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nEA has been a punching bag for some due to their blunders regarding Star Wars Battlefront and their DRM policy, but like Microsoft, it didn’t faze them at all. The finances speak for themselves—$5.2 billion.\n\nThey also have franchises like Madden, the FIFA series, and their own digital platform, Origin. EA has no worries about going into the future. Metacritic’s rating is 77.5%\n\nSega\n\nBeloved makers of Sonic have recently had great success in their recent PC title, Two Point Hospital. Their reach is wide, with them releasing many different titles this year not related to franchises like many other publishers. Metacritic has them at 78.5%\n\nActivision Blizzard\n\nWhat a doozy. With profits of $7.2 billion, the beloved publisher of modern classics of League of Legends and World of Warcraft is smooth sailing this year.\n\nProfits from the aforementioned games plus esports sponsorships have helped the company dominate the online gaming market. Metacritic has them at 77.4%.\n\nTencent Games\n\nTencent is always a surprise to me. You have all the well-known publishers like Nintendo, then Tencent sneaks up on you and surprises you with a revenue of $4.4. billion.\n\nTencent is one of the premier mobile gaming companies. Of course, they have PC titles, but their mobile gaming is what brings the real money in.\n\nBandai Namco\n\nI love Bandai Namco. Not only are they a game publisher, but they do so much more. They take advantage of the insane media properties they own like Dragonball Z and Gundam.\n\nThis team publishes classic franchise titles like Ace Combat Dark Souls and Tekken. They are a powerhouse in Japan particularly, receiving $3.6 billion in revenue. Metacritic rests at 71.8%.\n\nWhat Makes It Great\n\nDiverse Portfolio of Franchises: Bandai Namco owns several multi-million video game franchises like Pac-Man, Tekken, Soulcalibur, Tales, Ace Combat, and Dark Souls. Pac-Man serves as the official mascot of the company.\n\nMedia Licenses: The company owns the licenses to several popular Japanese media franchises, such as Shonen Jump, Gundam, Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, Sword Art Online, and the Ultra Series.\n\nSquare Enix\n\nThe developers and publishers of the Final Fantasy series have a reputation that precedes itself. Classics like Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts made this company a force to be reckoned with. 2018 was a more difficult year for them, however.\n\nSince they didn’t release another Final Fantasy title or something from deeper in their catalog, their sales were $2.2 billion—still nothing to smirk at! Hopefully, they’ve benefited greatly from the release of Kingdom Hearts III in early 2019. Their Metacritic score is 71.0%.\n\nUbisoft\n\nEveryone’s favorite developer of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry is right at home on the list. With a crisp $2 billion in 2018 revenue, the French company is dedicated to their franchises, constantly building on them, and making them into powerhouses.\n\nIt really shows too: recent titles like Far Cry 5 and Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey were amazing successes for them. Metacritic score is 73.7%.\n\nParadox Interactive\n\nA personal favorite publisher of mine, Paradox deals in many strategy titles for the PC. Their major success comes with their great game Cities: Skylines and its expansions. Metacritic has 75.2% for them.\n\nWhat Makes It Great\n\nParadox Interactive is known for publishing a wide range of historically themed strategy games, including grand strategy games, role-playing games, and management simulators. They are not limited to a single genre, which makes them versatile in the gaming industry.\n\nLong-Term Support: The company is known for its “long tail” approach, where they continue to develop and support their games for years after the initial release. This includes both free updates and paid downloadable content (DLC), enhancing the gaming experience and keeping the community engaged.\n\nBethesda Softworks\n\nBethesda is one of those publishers you can count on. Games like Skyrim, Fallout, Doom, and Wolfenstein have all gone through Bethesda’s hallowed halls. Metacritic score of 71.4%.\n\nWhat Makes It Great\n\nPioneering Role in RPGs: Bethesda is the creator of the iconic “The Elder Scrolls” series, which has set the standard for open-world RPGs.\n\nInnovative Game Engines: Bethesda developed XnGine, a 3D game engine, replacing the raycasting engine used for Arena. This engine was used in several games, showcasing their technical prowess.\n\nAcquisition and Revival of Fallout: Bethesda acquired the Fallout franchise and revitalized it with titles like Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76, adding a new dimension to their portfolio.\n\nWarner Bros. Interactive\n\nWarner Bros. has found recent success in publishing titles like Batman Arkham series, the Lego series, Shadow of Mordor and its sequel, Shadow of War.\n\nWith a total of 20 distinct products released during the year and a solid score of 73.3%, Warner Bros. Interactive is quickly on the rise.\n\nWhat Makes It Great\n\nDiverse Portfolio of Studios: WB Games manages a wide range of wholly-owned game development studios like TT Games, Rocksteady Studios, NetherRealm Studios, and Monolith Productions, among others. This allows them to produce a variety of games across different genres.\n\nInnovative Business Models: WB Games was one of the first to transition “The Lord of the Rings Online” to a free-to-play model, showing adaptability and a willingness to experiment with different revenue streams.\n\nStrong Intellectual Properties: WB Games has the rights to some of the most iconic franchises, including Batman, Mortal Kombat, and the Lego series, allowing them to create games that have a built-in fan base.\n\nTake-Two Interactive\n\nTake-Two had its publishing roots in helping games like the Grand Theft Auto series and the Borderlands franchise. They’re keeping bust today, releasing 9 distinct products, and averaging a score of 77.0%.\n\nTake-Two found their biggest success of the year in releasing a port of Sid Meier’s Civilization VI for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nFocus Home Interactive\n\nFocus recently published the story-driven game The Council for PC, Xbox, and PS4. This title helped the publisher achieve an average of 69.8%, with their lowest title, Space Hulk: Deathwing receiving mixed to poor reviews.\n\nNIS America\n\nNIS stands for Nippon Ichi Software and like the name states, it’s the American branch. This past year saw them publish 17 distinct titles to earn them an average score of 69.5%. Their biggest benefit was the release of Disgaea 1 Complete for the PS4.\n\nWhat Makes It Great\n\nInnovative Game Mechanics: NIS America is known for its Disgaea series, which introduced a unique setting and gameplay mechanics that have been carried through the series. The games are full of zest and original flavor.\n\nEmotional Storytelling: Games like “Phantom Brave” and “Soul Nomad & the World Eaters” offer emotional tales that captivate players.

They have been trusted with franchises like Zelda and Fire Emblem, which has elevated their standing in the industry.\n\nBalancing Original IPs and Collaborations: The company aims to release one major game each year based on their own IP. Their action role-playing title, Nioh, has sold three million copies, proving they can also succeed with original IPs.\n\nCultural Identity as a Strength: Unlike other Japanese companies that tried to westernize, Koei Tecmo embraced its Japanese identity. This has not only appealed to the western market’s growing interest in Japanese culture but has also given them a head start in the Chinese market.\n\nMobile Market Strategy: Koei Tecmo has adapted its mobile game monetization strategies to suit the tastes of different regional markets, showing a nuanced understanding of global player behavior.\n\nDevolver Digital\n\nDevolver is a unique publisher dealing with titles like Hotline Miami, The Talos Principle, and the insane Broforce. Devolver has a great track record for publishing, earning them an average of 75.5%.\n\nWhat Makes It Great\n\nSmall Team, Big Impact: Despite being a small team of just 16 people, Devolver Digital has published close to 100 games. They have no physical office and team members are scattered across the globe.\n\nIndie Developer Focus: The company’s primary goal is to help indie developers reach a larger audience. They have successfully turned unknown games into hits.\n\nDigital-First Strategy: Devolver made a strategic decision to focus solely on digital distribution, primarily through Steam. This freed them from the constraints of physical goods and allowed them to maintain control over the company.\n\nNo Corporate Backing: The team decided to avoid corporate backing to maintain their independence.

Dear Villagers aims for mid-market games and is described as having gameplay that is easy to learn but hard to master. PID Games, on the other hand, has “no rules” and focuses on publishing any interesting video games, regardless of genre or platform.\n\nAs you can see, this is merely scratching the surface. There are hundreds of other game publishers out there. Most likely, the top spots will remain where they are, maybe switching spots now and then over the next couple of years.\n\nBut who knows? Maybe one of the lesser-known studios could make a game that surpasses anything we have seen before.\n\nWarhorse Studios came out with the sleeper hit of 2018, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and ended up making a game, (although somewhat polarizing), make a big splash in gaming.\n\nCould something similar happen, making their way onto another top 20 list?
