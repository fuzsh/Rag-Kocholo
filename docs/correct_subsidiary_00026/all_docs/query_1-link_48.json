        "text": "QUICK_EDIT\n\nAttach signature (signatures can be changed in profile) close\n\nWestwood sold themselves. I don't consider very loyal to a franchise to sell it to the highest bidder. You know the only thing $perry ever cared about was making profit with C&C when he himself admits it. Also, don't forget this cutscene. Oh the in-house sarcasm/tongue-in-cheek humour.\n\n_________________\n\nQUICK_EDIT\n\nAttach signature (signatures can be changed in profile) close\n\nYeah, it's not quite like they sold the franchise. They sold the whole company. And that can be for many reasons, including financial stability. If they were always able to be independent and make enough money to survive and build bigger and better games I'm sure they wouldn't have done it. I don't know why anyone would, except as I said for survival or growth reasons.\n\nQUICK_EDIT\n\nAttach signature (signatures can be changed in profile) close\n\nSelling to EA isn't really the big deal to me. Making the exit as a startup when things become hard to manage is an action I can understand. However as EA closing the company instead of rehabilitating it, sounds like market condition. That is a valid tactic to eliminate competition. They just should not expect sympathy for it.\n\nQUICK_EDIT\n\nAttach signature (signatures can be changed in profile) close\n\nWestwood wasn't a startup in 1998 when they sold to EA. They had been around for 13 years by that point. (Since 1985) It wasn't the first time they sold, as previously mentioned they sold to Virgin Games in 1992.\n\nThey sold to EA because Virgin Interactive (Virgin Games changed name to Virgin Interactive in 1995) were selling off their assets in the US. They sold to EA as they said they usually do not interfere with the business of successful subsidiaries.\n\nAfter selling to EA structural changes happened in the company. The old flat structure was replaced with a more rigid one. Giving a lot of people roles and specific jobs rather than allowing them to flow between the jobs and roles they wanted as was the old ways. This is one of the many reasons why for instance TS had a troubled development and was released in the state it was missing a lot of \"promised\" features.\n\nWestwood was closed in 2003.\n\n_________________"
