        "text": "Background\n\nWestwood Studios was founded in 1985 by Brett Sperry and Louis Castle. In 1992, it became part of Virgin Interactive, but was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1997 for $122.5 million. EA closed the studio in 2003. Some of the staff were let to move into EA UK, while others went to create Petroglyph Studios.\n\n1st Logo (1988-1993)\n\nVisuals: There are the words \"Westwood ASSOCIATES\" on a gray screen. The second word is much smaller than the first word. The words cast a shadow on the screen.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Eye of the Beholder, the text is in red.\n\nOn DragonStrike, the text is in turquoise.\n\nSometimes, the logo shares the screen with other logos.\n\nSometimes, the background is blue.\n\nOn some platforms, like C64 and Apple II, the background is black.\n\nTechnique: A still, sprite-based graphic.\n\nAudio: None or the opening theme of the game. On the DOS version of Eye of the Beholder, an ascending synth theme that trails off into the SSI and Dungeons & Dragons logos.\n\nAvailability: Seen on early games like Circuit's Edge, BattleTech: The Crescent's Hawk's Inception, The Mars Saga (aka Mines of Titan), the C64 and DOS versions of A Nightmare on Elm Street, Ancient Glory and Dragonstrike, as well as Eye of the Beholder.\n\n2nd Logo (1992-1994)\n\nVisuals: There is a black screen with the word \"Westwood\" in a futuristic font. Below it is a blue bar with the word \"STUDIOS\" spread out in bronze. Everything is covered in a border of bronze. A few pings appear on the logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn The Legend of Kyrandia, the logo wipes in over the landscape of Kyrandia, followed by the title screen.\n\nOn Young Merlin, the logo is on a black-blue gradient background, and the Virgin Games logo is shown above the logo.\n\nOn the SNES version of The Lion King, the logo is shifted to the top, and the Walt Disney Feature Animation logo is shown at the bottom.\n\nTechnique: Shining effects.\n\nAudio: A choir theme with some sparkling sounds, composed by Frank Klepacki. On some games, the opening theme plays over.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nFor some reason, the SNES game Young Merlin used the logo's theme on the title screen, followed by the opening theme of the game when the logos appear.\n\nOn the CD-ROM version of Lands of Lore, the male announcer says \"The Westwood Studios production of...\" when the logo appears instead of the theme.\n\nAvailability: Seen on Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos, Dune II, the first two The Legend of Kyrandia games, Young Merlin and The Lion King.\n\n3rd Logo (1994)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a blue flash appears, revealing the same Westwood logo from before, in 3D with \"STUDIOS\" in black, without a bronze outline, and a light shines over the logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn The Legend of Kyrandia 3: Malcolm's Revenge, the logo is on a marble background.\n\nOn the Genesis version of Dune II, the logo is on a blue box, with the logo in white, and the Virgin Interactive logo hangs above.\n\nTechnique: Sprite-based animation.\n\nAudio: A whoosh, followed by a chime theme.\n\nAvailability: Seen on The Legend of Kyrandia 3: Malcolm's Revenge and the Alpha version of Command & Conquer.\n\n4th Logo (September 26, 1995-2002)\n\nVisuals: The green Westwood logo from before, but with \"STUDIOS\" in the same font as \"Westwood\" and without a bronze outline, is wiped by light.\n\nVariants:\n\nIn its first year of use, a special anniversary variant was presented. Rather than being wiped, it appeared through raindrops. On the first Command & Conquer game, there is a Virgin Interactive Entertainment byline.\n\nIn 2002, the byline \"Westwood Studios is an Electronic Arts brand\" is shown on the bottom right of the logo.\n\nThere are other animated variants as well.\n\nOn Command & Conquer: Red Alert, the logo flashes and turns white and disappears into the word \"proudly presents\", which also disappears.\n\nOn Dune 2000, the logo rises from the sand.\n\nOn Lands of Lore II, the logo is in black, wipes in on a orange map-like background, with \"presents\" below the logo.\n\nOn the Nintendo 64 version of Command & Conquer, the logo fades in on a grid background, with two camera pieces on the top left and bottom right.\n\nOn The Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat, the logo lies on a pirate ship.\n\nOn Command & Conquer: Renegade, the logo is shown on a reflection of a water.\n\nOn Earth & Beyond and Command & Conquer: Continuum, the logo is on a space background, with mechanics on top, and \"Westwood\" wipes in on the logo.\n\nOn Command & Conquer 2: Red Alert, the logo appears, but disappears into a blue flash, and the word \"PROUDLY PRESENTS\" fades in.\n\nTechnique: Sprite-based animation.\n\nAudio: A humming choir.\n\nAvailability: Seen on Command & Conquer and its sequels, on Monopoly from 1995, Lands of Lore II and III and Dune 2000.\n\n5th Logo (August 27, 1999-February 27, 2002)\n\nVisuals: A blue ball with electricity flowing through it comes down, along with the \"W\" from the 3rd logo and a sharp-edged \"S\" coming down and landing on the ball. In the bottom right corner appears the byline \"Westwood Studios is an Electronic Arts Company\". The ball also has 8 curves spinning around it. The ball and letters fly towards the screen and disappear via a switch-off effect.\n\nVariant: On Emperor: Battle for Dune, the byline instead reads \"Westwood Studios is an Electronic Arts brand\".\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: Humming sounds."
