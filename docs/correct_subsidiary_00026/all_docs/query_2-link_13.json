        "text": "When did they start? Well, that would be quite a while ago, actually. They began their career as something like the Jesus of game companies yet, over time they became...well, bigger. Even though people have pointed out Project 10$ as the start that's more like when they started peaking, actually - there have been shady things around EA from before that era, only it wasn't as prominent. When they acquired Westwood, for example, there were rumours and accounts of some people leaving because of EA and similar things but overall we still got RA2 and we were happy.\n\nBut that just shows that there were bad things surrounding EA from even before the Project 10$ thing - by the time that hit, EA had managed to fuck up more frequently and with greater magnitude, thus starting a very downward trend in public eyes. Since then they continued to flail around causing more mishap and thus reaffirming the picture they had painted of themselves.\n\nUntil relatively recently, they didn't really seem to care much about fixing that image, however, for roughly the last two years, they did put some work into actually becoming better. Probably winning worst company award two times in a row did strongly nudge them in that direction.\n\nsgy0003 said:\n\nI remember EA being a great publishers that gave me great games such as Dragon Age, Dead Space, Mass Effect, Mirror's Edge, and Mass Effect 2 (which is debatable).\n\nErm those would be games that were after EA was started to widely be considered bad. People lamented BioWare being bought by EA because they were just working on DA:O and ME at the time. I think ME might have been release just around the time EA got them, while DA:O was certainly in the works and heavily advanced. There were many that feared EA would meddle but the game turned out to be alright despite the fears. Yet, ME2 and DA2 didn't have such luck and many held them as examples why EA was being bad at the time. Mirror's Edge, in particular, is actually an infamous example of \"EA being bad\" as, while many like the game, even they admit that the fighting seems shoehorned. And indeed it is, as by many accounts it was explicitly requested by EA for there to be shooting mechanics. The bugs and other problems of the game are also chalked up to EA - partly because of the tacked on shooting and partly because the game was rushed. And I'm pretty sure that when Dead Space came out, critics did use it as an example that EA can still make good game, and as such, as a tool to criticise them for not actually doing it more often.\n\nPoint being, the games you point at proving EA being \"great publishers\" were actually the opposite - at the time, many were reminded of what EA was missing in the rest of their games. And indeed, sequels of these games did get quite criticised for going downhill.\n\nEA has always been bad. It is practically their business model (besides yearly releases of fifa, which I think are actually fine). Their basic pattern has always been to find excellent, highly acclaimed studios that make amazing games, buy that studio, and run it into the ground exploiting the good name of the acquired studio until gamers have lost all faith in the brand, at which they close the studio. They have been doing this for more than 20 years, the earliest examples of this that I experienced was EA acquiring and trashing the brilliant Bullfrog in 1995 and Westwood in 1998.\n\nMass Effect was not made by EA. Bioware was acquired by EA right about at the time Mass Effect was released, it was complete before EA bought them. Dragon Age was already deep in development at the time. Neither can be attributed to EA.\n\nNow, EA has made some decent games, like Dead Space. In fact, I would say they are better now than ever. They have done some stupid things recently, but they did far, far worse in the past.\n\nSome say Project Ten Dollar, but I say go deeper and look at the events of late 2004 and early 2005. You see, back at that time there was a strong competition between 2K and EA on the sports genre, and this competition was no stronger than the annual NFL-licensed game. Except, on this year, 2K's NFL 2K5 managed to beat EA's Madden 2005 on overall ratings in a time when critics were a definitive source of opinion for games. Now, given the competition, how could EA strike back? Would they try building a better game? Well, back then, the NFL games were made with permission and non-exclusive contract to use the NFL teams and players via the Players' Association. So what EA did was change the terms of that contract to be exclusive, and thus EA was the only one who could make officially-licensed and commercially sold NFL games. 2K, left with nothing, eventually had to cancel NFL 2K6. However, in a move to strike back, 2K pulled the same trick with the NBA and MLB, which is why you don't see basketball and baseball games made by EA anymore.\n\nThis is where EA's desire to not compete, or bend the market's rules to be more uncompetitive, begins.\n\nBut an earlier problem exists, and it's one few don't bring up. Back in 1991 EA entered the public market, meaning ownership could be traded off via shares, and thus the corporatizing of the company began. As the video game industry's revenue increased with each year, investment firms grew more interested in companies like EA, and thus chose to buy stock. Those shares grew, and these firms have little experience in the industry - Thus they have a large percentage of what goes and what doesn't, and if something doesn't show possible returns, they will not be in favor of it.\n\nSo it's not EA that's entirely bad, it's investment firms who don't understand what (nor want to) they're investing in that's bad.\n\nvalium said:\n\nEA was once good?\n\nnews to me.\n\nLet me tell you a story, albeit a not very exciting one..\n\nWhat if I told you there was a time when EA games came with little seals of guarantee in their manuals with the following sentence (more or less, im paraphrasing): We at EA are an association of electronic artists who are passionate about our craft strive to make the highest quality products and the best games around, we hope you greatly enjoy this product and that EA will continue to make the best games for gamers for many years to come and that when you see the EA title, you know you are guaranteed to the highest quality gaming experience.\n\nI butchered it but the sentiment was more or less like that. I only remember this because I was surprised to find see a company make such a passionate statement, and also these were the days when everyone still read the manuals because they were usually quite informative.\n\nGame in question was Road Rash for the genesis/megadrive if anyone is curious.\n\nThen at some point...Well let's just say at some point the idealistic small guy turned into an emotionless titan, but I couldn't tell you when it happened exactly. And that Titan got progressively more anti consumer and greedy as its importance swelled."
