        "meta_description": "From Wikipedia:\n\nElectronic Arts, Inc. (EA) (NASDAQ: ERTS) is an international developer, marketer, publisher and distributor of video games. Founded and incorporated on May 28, 1982 by Trip Hawkins, the company was a pioneer of the early home computer games industry and was notable for promoting the designers and programmers responsible for its games. Originally, EA was a home computing game publisher. In the late 1980s, the company began developing games in-house and supported consoles by the early 1990s. EA later grew via acquisition of several successful developers. By the early 2000s, EA had become one of the world's largest third-party publishers. In May 2008, the company reported net annual revenue of US$4.02 billion in fiscal year 2008. Currently, EA's most successful products are sports games published under its EA Sports label, games based on popular movie licenses such as Harry Potter and games from long-running franchises like Need for Speed, Medal of Honor, The Sims, Battlefield and the later games in the Burnout and Command &amp; Conquer series. They are also the distributors of the Rock Band and Left 4 Dead series. EA reported a $1.08 billion loss for the financial year ending March 2008. Revenue for the same period was up to $4.2 billion, a 15 percent rise from the previous year&rsquo;s $3.6 billion.\n\nSubsidiaries:\n\n\n     EA All Play - Founded ??\n         EA Mobile - Founded 2004\n         PopCap Games - Founded 2000\n    \n     EA Baton Rouge - Founded ??\n     EA Brazil - Founded ??\n     EA Casual Entertainment - Founded ??\n     EA China - Founded ??\n     EA Deutschland - Founded ??\n     EA France - Founded ??\n     EA India - Founded ??\n     EA Japan - Founded ??\n     EA Korea - Founded ??\n     EA Montreal - Founded 2004\n     EA Romania - Founded ??\n     EA Russia - Founded ??\n     EA Salt Lake - Founded 2006\n     EA San Francisco - Founded ??\n     EA Singapore - Founded ??\n     EA Games - Founded ??\n         BioWare - Founded 1995\n         Criterion Games - Founded 1993 \n         EA Digital Illusions CE AB - Founded ??\n             DICE Los Angeles - Founded ??\n        \n         Ghost Games - Founded 2011\n    \n     EA Maxis - Founded 1987\n         EA Redwood Shores - Founded ??\n             The Sims Studio - Founded 2006\n        \n         Maxis Salt Lake - Founded ??\n         Maxis Melbourne - Founded ??\n         Maxis Helsinki - Founded ??\n    \n     EA Sports - Founded 1991\n         EA Tiburon - Founded 1994\n         EA Canada - Founded 1983\n    \n     Easy Studios - Founded ??\n     European Integration Studio (EIS) - Founded ??\n     Motive Studios - Founded 2015\n     Respawn Entertainment - Founded 2010\n     Uprise - Founded 2012\n\n\nDefunct Subsidiaries:\n\n\n     Bullfrog Productions Ltd. - Founded 1987/Defunct 2001\n     Danger Close Games - Founded 2000/Defunct 2013\n     Digital Illusions CE AB - Founded 1998/Defunct 2006\n     EA Baltimore - Founded 1996/Defunct 2000\n     EA Black Box - Founded 1998/Defunct 2013\n     EA Bright Light - Founded ??/Defunct 2011\n     EA Chicago - Founded 1990/Defunct 2007\n     EA North Carolina - Founded ??/Defunct 2013\n     EA Pacific - Founded 1998/Defunct 2003\n     EA Phenomic - Founded 2006/Defunct 2013\n     EA Seattle - Founded 1982/Defunct 2002\n     EA UK - Founded ??/Defunct ??\n     Kesmai Corporation - Founded 1981/Defunct 2001\n     Maxis - Founded 1987/Defunct 2004\n     Mythic Entertainment - Founded 2006/Defunct 2014\n     Pandemic Studios - Founded 1998/Defunct 2009\n     Playfish - Founded 2009/Defunct 2013\n     Original HQ - Founded ??/Defunct 1998\n     Origin Systems Inc. - Founded 1983/Defunct 2004\n     Visceral Games - Founded 1998/Defunct 2017\n     Waystone Games - Founded ??/Defunct 2014\n     Westwood Studios - Founded 1987/Defunct 2003\n\n\nThe EA Partners co-publishing arm is dedicated to publishing and distributing games developed by third-party developers.
