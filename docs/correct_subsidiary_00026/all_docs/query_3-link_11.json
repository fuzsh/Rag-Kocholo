        "text": "If there’s an independent video game development studio with a unique creative vision that makes games that you love to play, you’d best hope the studio doesn’t attract the attention of Electronic Arts (EA). EA has overseen the development of some very good games and they’re very good at making money, but they also have a long history of acquiring and then shutting down successful and creative development studios. They’re a place where game development studios go to die.\n\nVisceral Games\n\nLast week the video game community mourned the closing of Visceral Games. Unlike the other studios described here, Visceral began its life as an EA property called EA Redwood Shores. The studio was renamed Visceral Games after Dead Space was released to critical and commercial success in 2008.\n\nVisceral created two Dead Space sequels, The Sims 3: Ambitions, Dante’s Inferno and Battlefield Hardline along with a number of other games between 2008 and 2015. The studio was working on a Star Wars game being written by Amy Henning (who wrote the first three Uncharted games for Naughty Dog) when EA shut them down.\n\nOrigin Systems\n\nOrigin Systems was co-founded by legendary game designer Richard Garriott (aka Lord British) as a home for his ground-breaking series of Ultima RPGs. Their first game was Ultima 3: Exodus in 1983. Along with Ultima III through VII: The Black Gate and several other games, Origin published Chris Roberts’ revolutionary space-flight action games Wing Commander I and Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi in 1990 and 1991, respectively.\n\nEA bought Origins in 1992. The first Ultima game that came out after the acquisition was Ultima VII Part Two: Serpent Isle in 1993. EA cancelled all further development in the Ultima universe after the release of Ultima IX: Ascension in 1999. Garriott left shortly thereafter in 2000. He had already lasted longer than Roberts who left in 1996. EA shut the studio down in 2004.\n\nBullfrog Productions\n\nBullfrog Productions was co-founded by controversial game designer Peter Molyneux in 1987. Their most well-known release was Populous which pioneered the god-game genre when it was published in 1989. They are also known for Syndicate (1993), Magic Carpet (1994) and Theme Park (1994) among others.\n\nEA bought Bullfrog in 1995. Molyneux left in 1997 after seeing Dungeon Keeper through to completion. EA shut Bullfrog down in 2001.\n\nWestwood Studios\n\nWestwood Studios breakthrough game was the Dungeons & Dragons licensed CRPG Eye of the Beholder published in 1991. They went on to create Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon (1991), Dune II (1992), The Legend of Kyrandia (1992) and Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos (1993). Their most well-known game is Command & Conquer (1995) which has been called the game that defined the real-time strategy genre.\n\nEA bought Westwood in 1998 and shut it down five years later in 2003.\n\nMythic Entertainment\n\nMythic Entertainment was co-founded in 1995 by Mark Jacobs and Rob Denton. Their most well-known game was the innovative MMORPG Dark Age of Camelot which introduced Realm vs Realm PvP to the world of online games when it was released in 2001. They released another well-known MMORPG Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning in 2008.\n\nIt was generally believed at the time that Mythic sold themselves to EA in 2006 in order to get the funding needed to finish Warhammer Online. EA subsumed Mythic under Bioware in 2009, the year after Warhammer Online was released. Jacobs left the company the day before EA announced the deal with Bioware. Denton left in 2013. EA dissolved Mythic in 2014.\n\nSpeaking of Bioware . . .\n\nBioware’s oft-copied Baldur’s Gate (1998) is generally credited as the game responsible for saving party-driven, tactical RPGs when it looked like the RPG genre was lost to clones of Diablo. Bioware followed up with a series of legendary games including Neverwinter Nights (2002), Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (2003) and Mass Effect (2007).\n\nEA bought Bioware in 2008. Bioware continued to make great story-driven games including Mass Effect 2 and 3, Dragon Age Origins, and Dragon Age: Inquisition but EA was working its destructive magic.\n\nBioware co-founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk were the guiding lights behind the company’s commitment to story-driven RPGs. They left in 2012. Drew Karpyshyn, who wrote Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, left the same year (he returned in 2015). The creator of the Mass Effect series, Casey Hudson, left in 2014 and returned in 2017 as EA tried to pick up the pieces after the Mass Effect: Andromeda debacle. David Gaider, the main Dragon Age writer left in 2016. Mike Laidlaw, the lead story developer for Dragon Age, left in 2017\n\nControversy followed the release of Mass Effect 3 in 2012 because devoted fans of the series thought the ending betrayed everything they had been led to believe about the choices they made having real consequences for the characters they had shepherded (heh) through the three games in the series. When the next game in the series, Mass Effect: Andromeda, was released in 2017 it met with ridicule and criticism because of it’s terrible facial animations, numerous bugs and weak plot. EA responded by putting the once-great Mass Effect series on hold and shutting down the Bioware Montreal Studio that created Andromeda.\n\nEA hasn’t killed Bioware – yet, but the studio is a pale shadow of what it used to be.\n\nMore of the same\n\nOrigin, Bullfrog, Westwood and Mythic are just a few of the studios EA has bought and then closed. Here are some others.\n\nMaxis. Instrumental in porting SimCity to the PC where it became legend. Bought by EA in 1997. Created The Sims (2000). Shut down in 2004.\n\nKesmai. Created the MMORPG forerunner Island of Kesmai (1985) and multiplayer online air-combat game Air Warrior (1987). Bought by EA in 1999 and shut down in 2001.\n\nPandemic Studios. Created Star Wars: Battlefront (2004), Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005), Full Spectrum Warrior (2004) and Destroy All Humans! (2005) among others. Bought by EA in 2008. Shut down in 2009.\n\nDreamWorks Interactive. Created Medal of Honor (1999). Bought by EA in 2000 and re-branded as EA Los Angeles. Re-branded again as Danger Close Games in 2010. Folded into Dice Los Angeles in 2013.\n\nThe EA way\n\nEA is a preeminent video game publisher and developer that owns some of the most successful franchises in gaming. They know how to make money from games. Unfortunately, they don't seem to know how to nurture and support the creative talent that makes the games that lead them to buy development studios in the first place.\n\nThere’s a two-stage pattern that emerges when you look at the studios EA has bought and closed. First, small development studios that have made great games are lured by EA’s money. Second, the creative and innovative people who made those games leave when they find out what it’s like to create the games that EA wants them to make within the company's corporate environment.\n\nRather than buy talented development studios and give them the freedom to do more of what they’re good at, EA buys the studio and demands that they churn out games that EA believes will make money. It’s as if EA bought the Los Angeles Dodgers and then demanded the entire pitching staff stopped working on pitching and shifted to becoming power hitters because they believe fans pay to see home runs.\n\nIt’s as likely to be true for game development studios as it is for anything else that all good things come to an end. The thing that sets the development studios apart is the end often begins when EA shows up at the door with checkbook in hand."
