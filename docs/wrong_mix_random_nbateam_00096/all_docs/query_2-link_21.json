        "text": "Pervasive Displays Research: What’s Next? We report on pervasive displays research covered during the 7th ACM International Symposium on Pervasive Displays (PerDis 2018), including interaction design for large displays, applications, interfaces, novel forms of displays, and augmented and virtual reality. PerDis 2018 took place from June 6-8 in Munich, Germany. The conference featured four tutorials, two keynotes, 22 pa- pers, nine posters and four demos. The general chair, Albrecht Schmidt from the Ludwig-Maxi- milians-Universität München (LMU), and the program co-chairs, Julie Rico Williamson (University of Glasgow) and Ivan Elhart (Università della Svizzera Italiana, USI), opened the con- ference by reporting the statistics of PerDis 2018. This year, the conference attracted 44 attendees from 10 different countries, showing a promising growing trend if compared with last year edition. PerDis strives to create a compelling environment for young and seasoned researchers alike. Thus, it recognizes outstanding contributions using awards for the best paper, demo and poster via at- tendees voting. RESEARCH TRENDS The conference programme included four paper sessions, namely: “Large Displays and Design Strategies,” “Display Applications and Interfaces,” “Novel Displays and Installations,” and “Aug- mented Reality, Virtual Reality and Display Awareness.” During the conference, 22 full papers were presented. Additionally, nine posters and four demos were presented in a subsequent session. Here, the contributions are clustered into thematic areas in order to highlight the main trends in pervasive displays research, which have been also summarized in Figure 1. Application Areas for Pervasive Displays Nine contributions presented applications for using displays. Wearable displays such as Aug- mented Reality (AR) glasses, Head-Mounted-Displays (HMDs), Virtual reality (VR) sets and vi- brotactile bands had the highest research momentum (four papers), followed by ambient displays such as wall tablets (two papers and one poster), and public displays (two papers and one poster).
