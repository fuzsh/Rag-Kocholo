After operating several businesses and non-profits involving educational and promotional programs, earth and biological sciences, and, renewable fuels, he is now studying human adaptation to coastal and marine environments. Holm has designed, built and operated mobile medical, research and rescue vehicles for automakers including General Motors, Ford, Mitsubishi, Kia and Mercedes-Benz. These vehicles, built under Holm’s EcoTrek Foundation, helped set new standards in “green technologies” and led GM to call him “a champion who is awakening mankind to alternatives in living and new methods to preserve our natural resources.” Added Mitsubishi: “Mr. Holm sets an amazingly high standard of integrity and performance.” Holm’s EcoTrek vehicles have been featured in TV shows, magazines, car shows and websites around the world. After running the Transcom firm for nearly two decades, Holm returned to college to earn a Master’s degree (with Honors) in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation from Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, hence his research focus on marine archaeology. Through his work, Holm identified cultural connections between California’s now-displaced island tribes and their mainland counterparts. His work was recognized in the U.S. Federal Register and led to the preservation of thousands of archaeological sites in California. Holm is now working with Dr. Levy through UCSD’s Center for Cyber-Archaeology and Sustainability on its flagship project – At-Risk Cultural Heritage and the Digital Humanities.
