It is not destructive, does not require crystalline long range order and it is sensitive to local structural and chemical details. Interpretation of spectra is however a complex matter and ab initio theoretical calculations of NMR spectra play an important role in NMR assisted structural determination of complex systems [1]. Ubiquitous in organic systems, van der Waals (vdW) interactions have long eluded proper treatment by first principle methods. Recently a new class [2] of exchange and correlation functionals in DFT has emerged that can account for dispersion forces at a fundamental level, avoiding semiempirical fitting or ad hoc corrections. The advent of these new theoretical tools has significantly enhanced the reliability of DFT calculations applied to organic systems. The combination of highly efficient NMR calculations via GIPAW method with the availability of this new class of functionals in the Quantum-ESPRESSO [3] suite of codes offers an unprecedented tool for the study of complex organic systems of great fundamental and medical interest. In this project we apply this general strategy to i) the search for candidate cholesterol crystal structures associated to different gallbladder diseases [4] by comparing experimental spectra with first principles NMR characterization, and ii) the ab-initio NMR study of proposed structural models of Abeta_40 amyloid fibril, which constitute the senile plaques, found in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson disease [5].\n\nPublications\n\nN.

Mainly responsible for this appearance are efflux systems belonging to the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) superfamily [9-16], which are the object of the present project. This emergency calls for new strategies to design new antibiotics and/or inhibitors, and an efficient path leading to the next generation of compounds will pass through the knowledge of the molecular processes governing resistance mechanisms. Our aim is to provide microscopically well-funded hints on the intrinsic structural and dynamical complexity associated with MDR that might be helpful for a more efficient drug design. With the same protocol (flexible docking, standard MD, and TMD) tested in previous studies [17-19], we will continue our investigation on the effects of point mutations in the binding pocket of AcrB, i.e., the transporter of E. coli RND efflux pump, in strong connection with experimental groups. Other techniques will be also used, such as metadynamics and SMD. The design of inhibitors and/or antibiotics able to escape efflux pumps requires gaining insights on the role of the residues in the crucial regions of the transporter (binding pocket, gate, etc.) and on the interaction patterns at the basis of an efficient extrusion. Thus, we will apply our protocol to unveil the determinants behind the molecular recognition of AcrB by a dozen of antibiotic substrates. It is a challenging task because of the sizes of the systems, the probable presence of multiple binding sites [20] and cooperativity effects [21,22], along with the scarcity of data on binding and kinetics. A second application of our computational strategy is related to the functioning of MexB, the transporter of P. aeruginosa. Although it bears high similarity to AcrB, MexB is very elusive, since only a crystal structure without a substrate is available [23]. A comparative study will allow the identification of the common features and differences when compared with AcrB, possibly paving the way to a better understanding of the functionality of these systems. A further issue associated with the comparative study of the two transporters is the identification of microscopic determinants of the action of efflux inhibitors. Some of them are known to be active against AcrB but never tested on P. aeruginosa. The comparative study will be extended to the investigation of the combination of different conformations of the transporter proposed as steps of the extrusion [21]. They will be simulated for AcrB and MexB and quantitatively evaluated in terms of the free energy costs of the transitions among the configurations. Additionally, examples of good and poor substrate for MexB will be investigated aiming at identifying the still largely unknown key aspects of an efficient and inefficient extrusion associated with structure-dynamics relationship and interactions with the solvent. This information might make feasible a preliminary screening of the compounds based on a microscopic picture.\n\nTheses\n\nFrancesca Collu, Molecular dynamics simulations of large systems: the case of multidrug efflux pumps in Gram-negative bacteria (University of Bern)\n\nTalks\n\nMiniworkshop in Molecular and Statistical Biophysics, Triest (Italy), October 11-12, 2012\n\nGordon Conference “Multi-drug efflux systems: Shared Molecular Mechanisms but Diverging Roles in Physiology and Medicine”, Ventura (USA), March 17-22, 2013\n\n541.

Correspondingly, kinase malfunction is related to an important number of human diseases. Protein kinases share a common canonical catalytic domain, consisting of a number of highly conserved motifs, which have to undergo distinct conformational changes to perform their catalytic activity. Most kinases also require other domains or proteins for full activation. The mechanism by which those protein-protein interactions activate the catalytic domain is not yet fully understood. The Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) is of special interest because of its importance as an anti-cancer drug target. The fusion protein Bcr-Abl leads to over-activation of Abl, causing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Currently, Abl inhibitors are the only pharmaceutical treatment for CML, but a significant proportion of patients develop resistance against currently known inhibitors. As most resistance mutants are located around the active site of the catalytic domain, the development of inhibitors that bind to allosteric sites may open the way towards new therapeutic approaches. A more detailed understanding of allosteric effects of other protein domains on the activation of Abl is, therefore, of paramount importance for the rational design of new drugs. In this project, we focus on the protein-protein interactions of the catalytic domain with the SH2 domain, an allosteric effector involved both in auto-inhibition and activation. As our preliminary calculations indicate, this effect stems mainly from a modification of important functional modes of the catalytic domain, as well as from the stabilization of certain catalytically relevant structural motifs. In order to obtain quantitative data on the thermodynamics and kinetics of Abl activation in the presence of the SH2 domain, we plan to reconstruct the free energy surface corresponding to those important modes. To this end, we plan to use metadynamics with parallel tempering (PTmetaD). PTmetaD is an extremely efficient and intrinsically parallel method for the calculation of the free energy as a function of one or more collective variables (CVs). In the second part of the project, the effect of the SH2 domain will be tested by introducing specific mutants, for which we will also calculate the corresponding free energy surfaces. These mutants are simultaneously studied experimentally in the group of Prof. Giulio Superti-Furga at CeMM in Viena. We aim at identifying hot spots of inter-domain interactions, which could serve as putative binding sites for new allosteric Abl inhibitors. Finally, we plan to expand our findings obtained for the Abl kinase to another, therapeutically relevant system, the FES kinase. FES, which has recently attracted attention as an important tumor suppressor, is also activated by interaction between the catalytic domain and the SH2 domain.\n\nPublications\n\nC. Herbert, …, F.L.

Antibacterial resistance constitutes nowadays a major concern for human health due to its social and economical implications. One of the main avenues for devising new strategies to overcome bacterial defenses without promoting resistance relies on a deeper understanding of the biophysical and biochemical properties of the bacterial membrane. This knowledge could be used to develop innovative therapies based on a synergic use of drugs inhibiting the activity of intracellular components, and substances increasing drug permeability of bacterial membrane. Great effort has therefore been invested to overcome resistance or to find possible alternative antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are produced by many tissues and cell types as part of their innate immune system, have attracted during the last years considerable interest as possible drug candidates acting as templates for the development of improved remedies. Despite the relevance of their mechanism of action, the fluid nature of the membrane coupled with the current resolution limitations of experimental techniques still prevents a detailed molecular understanding of AMP activity. For this reason, atomistic molecular simulations can play a pivotal role for unveiling their mechanism and can have a large impact to progress towards the development of innovative antibiotic remedies. We propose to perform a comprehensive set of large-scale simulations aimed at investigating for the first time the biochemical and biophysical properties of a realistic model of the bacterial membrane. Building on established molecular mechanics models of phospholipids along with recent models developed and tested in our lab of key anionic constituents of the bacterial membrane, i.e. cardiolipins, extended molecular simulations will be used to fully characterize the biophysical properties of the bacterial membrane and to dissect its interactions with natural and artificial cationic AMPs. To this purpose we will mainly use molecular dynamics (MD) sampling techniques within the molecular mechanics framework and will investigate model systems with different concentration of phospholipids, cations and AMPs. Importantly, this series of molecular simulations will be designed to consistently complement high-speed atomic force microscopy experiments on similar membrane templates in complex with the same AMPs. Thus, the interplay of state-of-the-art MD and AFM techniques will contribute to compensate their reciprocal spatial and temporal resolution limitations and will provide precious and unique insights into the molecular understanding of the structural and kinetic properties of the bacterial membrane and its response to environmental conditions and AMPs attack. These studies are ultimately intended to pave the way to the rational design of novel antibiotics mimicking the AMP mechanism of action.\n\nPublications\n\nT. Lemmin, C. Bovigny, D. Lancon and M.

Genomes contain a huge amount of information about how the diversity of life appeared and changed through time, and about how living systems work, from protein functions to ecological communities. However, this information is encrypted. One powerful approach to deciphering this information is to compare the genomes of different species in an evolutionary framework: genomes inform about species evolution, and in return evolution informs about the function of genes. The analysis of genomes requires dedicated algorithms and vast amounts of computation, but methods that are taylored to use all the information included in the genomes are just starting to appear. In particular the reconstruction of gene trees and species trees on a genomic scale is a critical step for evolutionary studies, but is a very complex and costly task. Fortunately, this reconstruction can easily be parallelized. We have developed a program to jointly infer gene trees and species tree by modelling events of gene duplication, loss, and transfer. Simulations and analyses on real genomic data show that our method accurately reconstructs the species tree and gene trees. In addition it can simultaneously infer other key features of the history of the genomes under study, such as ancestral gene contents and speciation times, more accurately than commonly-used methods. This program uses the Message Passing Interface to run on several processors simultaneously. Its scaling properties have been assessed on the supercomputer Jade at the CINES in 2011, and we now plan on using it on 100 to 200 genomes from the three domains of life. This will enable us to reconstruct a species tree based on all the genes present in the genomes under study, and to infer gene trees and events of duplication, transfer and losses for all gene families. In the process, we will obtain precise dates for speciation events billions of years old, at geological times where the lack of interpretable fossils renders commonly used dating methods inaccurate. We will also reconstruct ancestral gene contents over the entire tree of life, thus illuminating metabolism evolution and consequently the history of geochemical conditions on earth for the past 4 billion years. The results of these computations performed at an unprecedented scale will be the core data for a group of leading scientists in Evolution gathered in the context of the French ANR project ANCESTROME (funded from the 2011 call Bioinformatique, Investissements davenir). We will study the evolution of genome structure, metabolism, ecological communities, and we will create user-friendly databases to make the result of our computations available to the international scientific community.\n\nPublications\n\nSzollosi GJ, Rosikiewewicz W,Boussau B, Tannier E, Daubin V. “Efficient Exploration of the Space of Reconciled Gene Trees”.

Such effects will likely involve the interactions of nanomaterials with the protein arsenal of the body. On the other hands, nanoparticles have been proposed as the basis for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, applications which define the emerging field of theranostic (therapy + diagnostic) nanomedicine. Recent experimental works tackled the effect, in vitro, of nanoparticles on protein fibrillation. Protein fibrillation is involved in many human diseases, such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, Creutzfeld-Jacob’s, and dialysis-related amyloidosis. The nanoparticles may enhance or inhibit the rate of formation of fibrils, therefore they can potentially lead to novel mechanisms for amyloid diseases as well as to therapeutic opportunities for their treatment. Although these results are of broad relevance, how the nanoparticles interfere with the fibrillation process at the atomistic level is still poorly understood. The main goal of this project is to unravel microscopic mechanisms that modify the fibrillation propensity of an amyloidogenic peptide when contacting inorganic nanoparticles. To this end, we shall perform all-atom classical Molecular Dynamics simulations in explicit solvent exploiting the highly scalable Hamiltonian-Temperature Replica Exchange enhanced sampling technique. We will focus on an important prototypical system: the Amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42) peptide on gold nanoparticles. The Abeta42 is a peptide of 42 amino acids, whose inclination to aggregation triggers the formation of fibrills and neurotoxic plaques observed in the Alzheimers disease. Gold nanoparticles are among the most versatile and easy-to-use ones, and are currently being tested as imaging contrast agents, absorptive heating systems and as dual imaging and therapeutic agents. Our simulations will clarify how and why the interaction with gold modifies the conformational ensemble of Abeta42 and therefore will provide microscopic insights on the nanoparticle role in affecting its fibrillation propensity.\n\nTalks\n\nS.

Although a number of efficient methods have been already developed to oxidize alcohols; the search for new, cost-effective and environmentally begnin procedures attracts substantial interest in the scientific community. In this respect, the gold-supported TiO$_{2}$ catalyst in liquid water offers a sustainable, environmentally benign alternative to traditional processes that use expensive inorganic oxidants and harmful organic solvents. Experimental studies have indeed shown that gold nanoclusters supported on various metal oxides (MgO, CeO$_{2}$, TiO$_{2}$) are able to catalyze a number of reactions. The outstanding catalytic activities of the supported metal are related to the shape and size of the deposited nanoparticles, and the interplay between the gold and the oxide support. However, there is little consensus on the atomistic details of the reaction mechanisms and on the nature and the role played by the active sites. Computer simulations can offer detailed insight into alcohol oxidation on the gold-supported TiO$_{2}$ catalyst in liquid water. We propose to perform an extensive theoretical investigation of the oxidation of methanol on the gold-supported TiO$_{2}$ (110) liquid interface.\n\nPublications\n\nMatteo Farnesi Camellone and Dominik Marx “On the Impact of Solvation on a Au/TiO2 Nanocatalyst in Contact with Water”, J.

This project is dedicated to larger-scale simulation of millions of atoms in non-equilibrium crystal-liquid systems, to reduce substantially the artefact of periodic boundary conditions upon crystallisation. Representative systems to be studied would include ice-liquid water systems, and mechanisms of crystal growth therein based on seeds of differing geometry and size.

The equation of state of dense hydrogen and its heavier isotopes is important for technological reasons such as for experiments conducted at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. What phase transitions dense hydrogen undergoes is a long standing problem in condensed matter physics since Wigner in 1935 [6]. However, for pressures greater than about 300GPa, its properties and even the underlying structures are not well understood [7, 8, 9, 10]. Recently, we have suggested new crystal structures of hydrogen [11] and estimated the density and pressures of an unusual liquid-liquid transition of hydrogen [12]. Using the recently developed Coupled Electron Ion Quantum Monte Carlo method [13, 14], we propose to determine the ordering of the various crystal structures and their melting temperatures, and investigate whether liquid hydrogen could be stable at low temperatures. If so, it would have unusual properties due to the strong quantum effects of the ions [15, 16]. To definitively determine the ordering of the various phases we will perform precise free energy calculations, evaluate finite size effects and the quantum effects of both electrons and protons. These techniques require significant computational resources. In the same interesting region hydrogen has been predicted to be a superconductor with particularly high critical temperature (around or above room temperature) [17,18,19]. We will investigate the superconducting behavior of the detected structures. In particular we wish to study superconductivity by optimizing an highly correlated wave functions [20,21] that allows singlet pairing between electrons just like in a conventional superconductor. Although we will not consider electron-phonon coupling, unconventional superconductivity can show up due to strong electron correlation with a mechanism explained within the RVB theory of High-Temperature superconductors[22]. Using Path Integral Monte Carlo techniques we will also investigate the effect of quantum proton statistics on the detected superconducting behavior within the free-energy Born-Oppenheimer approximation[23]. Our calculations will establish benchmarks useful for approximate density functional theory simulations as well as develop a powerful new tool for investigating material properties.\n\nPublications\n\nM.A. Morales, J.M.

Among the most important inorganic materials, silica based ones play a key role, because they are chemically inert, structurally robust, easy to prepare and characterize. Considering this class of materials, ordered mesoporous structures have attracted a lot of interest in the last decades. They have found many applications in separation, catalysis, sensors and devices. Generally, they show a regular arrangement of either cylindrical pores or cages of mesoporous size (2-10 nm) with high surface area. As drug delivery systems they are compatible with the fundamental requirements of biodegradability and biocompatibility. MCM-41, a member of this family of materials, was first proposed for this use in 2001. Since then, a lot of investigations have been done in this area. Among drugs whose transportation in the body can be assisted by mesoporous silica, the most studied one is ibuprofen, a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The adsorption of drugs into the pores is a surface phenomenon that is governed mainly by interactions between silanol (SiOH) groups and the functional groups of the guest molecules, but also London type interactions can play an important role considering the hydrophobic nature of ibuprofen. An interesting point of debate in the study of ibuprofen confinement in mesoporous silica concerns the physical state of this molecule in the system. In particular, it is still not clear if the majority of the drug population is in interaction with pore walls or in a free state and, in this case, if it is as a free molecule or in a dimeric form. The aim of this project is to simulate by quantum mechanical methods the features of MCM-41 mesoporous silica material with respect to adsorption of ibuprofen drug as a single molecule and in its dimeric form. The adopted approach is based on well know quantum mechanical methods based on DFT plus a posteriori dispersion correction. The atomistic details provided by these accurate calculations would allow, for the first time in the literature, to understand the interaction energy of ibuprofen with a mesoporous silica material. This study will also try to compute the relative stability between ibuprofen adsorbed as a monomer vs. the dimer, a key point to understand its release in the body. We believe that the expected results, in particular the calculated interaction energies, may be useful to design new functionalized MCM-41 materials apt to modulate the strength of interaction with ibuprofen and similar drugs.\n\nPublications\n\nDelle Piane M., Corno M., Ugliengo P. “Does dispersion dominate over H-bonds in drug-surface interactions?

Indeed, not only most of biology happens in a wet environment but also nowadays chemicals production strongly relies on wet chemistry and chemical reactions in solutions are at the base of devices such as catalysts. The presence of a solvent induces important effects on the physical properties of a system with respect to the case when it is in the gas-phase. In particular, this happens when the solvent is water, which is a prototypical case due to the its relevance for biological systems and its wide frequency in technological realizations. One of the first steps for investigating, from an atomistic point of view, the physical properties of a solvated molecular system is the assessment of its electronic properties. Indeed, the relative position of energy levels determines the reactivity of simple chemical processes such as electron charge transfer. The theoretical study of electronic properties requires the use of first-principles methods. In contrast to the case of small molecules, for which very accurate quantum-chemistry schemes can be easily used, larger molecules comprising from tens to hundreds of atoms call for methods showing better scaling of the computational cost with respect to the size of the system. Indeed, most of the studies of solvated moelcules have been performed till now using approaches based on density functional theory (DFT). However, the accuracy of these methods is far to be completely satisfactory. Much more accurate methods based on the treatment of the many-body perturbation theory formalism with the GW approximation have proved successfully in describing electronic properties of large organic molecules [1-3] and of bulk aqueous systems [4]. Here, we propose to use a recently developed method for performing accurate GW calculations in large systems [5] for addressing the electronic properties of solvated molecules keeping an explicit quantum description of the solvent. We want to address three important cases: simple molecules solvated in water as the simplest prototypical realization, solvated DNA fragments, adsorbed organic dyes in water solution. In all these cases, we will first performed molecular dynamics runs at fixed temperature. Then, we will select a set of configurations for which we will performed GW calculations assuring in this way a good statistical average. The GW approach yields nice results for the electronic structure of isolated DNA bases [6] and it is interesting now to include in the simulation also the phosphate backbone together with the surrounding counter-ions and water molecules as their relevance has been highlighted in previous DFT studies[7]. In the final part of our proposed work, we will address the case of a solvated organic dye adsorbed on a titania surface. Systems of this kind are strongly investigated nowadays for building electrochemical solar-cell avoiding the use of Ru based dyes. In such systems, the inclusion of the modifications due to the presence of the water solvent has been shown to be the key for reproducing optical excitations[8].\n\nPublications\n\nP. Umari, L.

QMC is a powerful approach for solving the Schrödinger equation using random walks. One of the key aspects making QMC approaches very attractive is their ideal adaptation to massively parallel computers and High Performance Computing (HPC). The application proposed here concerns the Alzheimers disease (AD) which is the most prevalent cause of dementia in the elderly population affecting more than 20 million people world-wide. The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide seems to play a causative role in AD. Abeta is the major constituent of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. A large body of evidence suggests that metallic ions (copper, zinc, and iron) could play a role in the etiology of AD through their influence on this aggregation mechanism and in the case of copper and iron in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As an important consequence understanding and controlling Abeta/metallic ions interactions could lead to promising therapeutic strategies In this project we propose to study the energetics implied in the formation of complexes involving metallic ions and Abeta peptide using large-scale Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo simulations. More precisely, we propose to look at the difference of Cu-Abeta binding in the case of the human and the murine (mouse and rat). Indeed, quite remarkably the murine, whose peptide differs from the human Abeta peptide only by three point mutations, does not show amyloid deposition and does not develop the Alzheimer’s disease. To understand these remarkable facts and thus to eventually propose new therapeutic strategies we propose to study the distinct Cu(II) coordination to the human/murine Abeta and possibly to shed some light on the origin of the mechanisms inhibiting or not the aggregation. Last year, thanks to a PRACE preparatory access we have been able to check the optimal parallel efficiency of our QMC=Chem code up to 10000 cores on the Curie machine (TGCC, France). Very recently, using the new configuration of Curie this regime has been extended further to its 80000 compute cores for a first scientific application concerning the Abeta peptides involved in the Alzheimer’s disease. From a more general perspective, such a project is expected to illustrate the extremely favorable computational aspects of QMC algorithms and the new exciting scientific applications which can be envisioned in the near future on massively parallel platforms running at the petascale level and beyond (exascale horizon).\n\nPublications\n\n“Biochemistry with quantum Monte Carlo: Exploring the impact of the Fixed-Node approximation”, A.

The CC calculations are able to provide highly accurate molecular energies, nuclear forces, and all parameters needed for describing the interaction of a molecule with its surroundings, including perturbing fields. Molecular properties, such as harmonic frequencies, excitation energies nuclear shieldings, frequency-dependent polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities and a plethora of molecular spectra, are all within reach. Standard CC wave function calculations are expressed in the canonical Hartree-Fock (HF) basis, which is a highly delocalized basis. However, the main task of the correlated calculation is to describe short-range electron-electron interactions, which is a very local phenomenon. The discord in description of a local phenomenon using a nonlocal basis inherently leads to a scaling wall, e.g., the seventh power scaling of CCSD(T) calculations, rendering this highly accurate method limited to small molecules only. The computational scaling of existing CC methods represents a roadblock to progress.One challenge of the 21st century is to remove this roadblock. The ultimate goal is to obtain CC methods that scale linearly with system size, or even better, where calculations for small and large molecular systems have the same wall time, provided a sufficient number of processors is available. The key to progress in CC applicability is to express the CC wave function in a basis of local HF orbitals and exploit the inherently short range physics of electron correlation. In a breakthrough, we have recently shown how such a local HF basis may be obtained and shown how to take advantage of the local nature of electron correlation to obtain a linearly scaling CC formulation. We denote the new method DEC-CC (Divide-Expand-Consolidate Coupled Cluster). Using DEC-CC approach, the CC calculation may be split into number of calculations on small fragments of the molecular orbital space, while retaining both full control of the error in the total energy and the black-box character of the traditional CC methodology. Each of the fragment calculations can be carried out independently, making the method embarrassingly parallel. The number of these calculations scales linearly with molecule size. DEC-CC is entirely on par with standard CC except its scaling is linear with respect to molecule size and therefore DEC-CC is suitable for applications on large molecules The success of the DEC-CC approach will open a new era of accurate quantum calculations on large molecular systems such as nanoparticles and proteins. It holds potential to accelerate research, not only in chemistry and physics, but in molecular science in general.\n\nPublications\n\nJ. J. Eriksen, P. Ettenhuber, K. Kristensen, T Kjærgaard, and P.

The occurrence of these configurations is modulated by the molecular environment and crowding. As an emblematic example, the relationship between aging and neurodegenerative diseases (dementia, Parkinson, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.) is due to the impairing of the biological mechanisms involved in metal ions transport within cells and in intercellular space (like in synapsis) [1]. Metal ions like Zn and Cu are particularly abundant in the central nervous system of mammals, where both ionic currents and redox reactions occur more frequently than in other compartments. The same metal ions are found coprecipitated and associated in various forms in the protein aggregates that are hallmarks of neurodegeneration. The mostly investigated example is the structural role of Zn and Cu in the amyloid-beta peptides that form the stable fibrils characterizing the Alzheimer’s disease (dementia) [2]. The Zn and Cu pathways in neurons and in synapsis are coupled by two main processes. i) Zn and Cu ions, this latter in two possible oxidation states, compete in the weak interactions with the 42 aminoacids amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta(1-42)), that is the major component of the fibrils in Alzheimer’s disease; ii) when Cu is associated with the Abeta peptide, it may behave as a catalyst for the oxidation of other molecules. Accurate measures, via cyclic voltammetry [3], of the redox parameters (both thermodynamic, like the reduction potential, and kinetic) for the Cu2+/Cu+ reduction (usually coupled with oxidation of ascorbic acid, both in vitro and in vivo) show a strong dependence on the peptide environment, that is by the chance of pre-organizing the Cu2+ site into a reduction-prone (or redox-competent) center [4]. This pre-organization puts Cu2+ and Cu+ in metastable states, that may be otherwise silenced in the other conformations available to the Cu-Abeta complex. Oligomeric forms play active role in modulating the chance of these metastable Cu-Abeta forms. The structures of monomeric complexes of Abeta (the region 1-16 is that involved in metal binding) with Zn2+ and Cu+ have been studied via first-principle molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water models [5,6]. These simulations showed the importance of competition between protons and metal ions for the same peptide atoms, with metal ion coordination assisting deprotonation of groups with usually high pKa (like the backbone amidic N atoms). Simulations of the Cu2+ interactions with Abeta(1-16) is still in progress, but the collected data well fit with recent experimental results [7]. The combination of empirical simulations of monomeric Abeta(1-16), Cu and a sample of water with short first-principle molecular dynamics simulations (these latter performed in the Car-Parrinello scheme) provided affordable tests for hypothesis about the chance of reaching states possibly promoting or silencing redox activity. Nevertheless, resonable estimates of the redox parameters for these states were not possible because of the limited statistics collected. With this project we aim at combining several advances in first-principle simulations for identifying redox-competent forms: i) massively parallel simulations of peptide models in water samples within the density-functional theory approximation for interatomic forces [6]; ii) extended statistical sampling induced by external potentials [8]. The sampling of different coordinations for the Cu ion (in both oxidation states) allows, in theory, the calcualation of redox parameters [9] averaging over the many possibilities offered by the peptide flexibility and in a single multiple replica simulation. The Prace experiment performed for a single Cu ion in a small water sample showed that a simple empirical definition of coordination number greatly helps in describing the most efficient pathways for the reduction of the aqua complex of Cu. Structures for Cu-Abeta(1-16) complex have been already simulated (in both oxidation states) and will be used as starting conditions for this project. Even though a quantitative simulation of redox parameters requires a huge amount of computational resources, the identification of redox-competent states may be performed with less resources. This possibility will be exploited by this project.\n\nPublications\n\n“Identifying redox competent forms in the amyloid cascade of Alzheimer’s disease by first-principles simulations”, P. Faller, C.

To obtain a better handling of fundamental issues, we propose an approach where the turbulence self-diffusion is modeled by the interaction between two different isotropic turbulent fields. This simplifies the main mechanisms. In fact, it does not include the nonlinear production of turbulent energy. However, it retains two of the most important features present in real flows: inhomogeneity and anisotropy. Recent simulations in our group revealed the generation of small-scale anisotropy in turbulence self-diffusion. A long-term interaction must be active to transfer to small scale the information on the anisotropy of the initial and boundary conditions (PRL 2011). Data from direct numerical simulations show that there is a departure of the longitudinal velocity derivative moments from the values found in HIT and that the anisotropy induced by the presence of a kinetic energy gradient has a different pattern from the one generated by an homogeneous shear. Other results concern the relationship between the correlation length and intermittency. A variation of the correlation length is not necessary to depart from Gaussianity (PHYSD 2012, PRE 2008). However, if the correlation length variation is concurrent with that of the energy, the mixing is enhanced, if is opposite, the mixing is decreased (JFM 2006). The transport of a passive scalar or a stable stratification added to the system highlight other phenomenology. The dimensionality of the system is in particular of great relevance for some aspects (temporal mixing growth and vorticity suppression). We propose here to carry out a number of simulations to account for: a) the variation over two orders of magnitude of the parameters associated to the presence of a stable density stratification, b) the passive scalar transport across an interface, and c) an increase of the amount of statistics for the turbulence self-diffusion already studied. The results, including raw data, will be made available to the community by giving access to the web disks of our group and by posting the data to HPC repositories (e.g. i-cfd at CINECA, or web sites of international cooperations, like ICTR http://www.ictr.eu). The impact of this research is expected in all the fields where turbulence does matter and where a manifestation of the nonuniversal behavior of small scales is closely related to small-scale anisotropy. In this concern, the project is fully interdisciplinary. Potential applications of this research span from atmospheric science to astrophysics, but are ubiquitous also in engineering systems.\n\nPublications\n\nSmall-scale anisotropy in turbulent shearless mixing.

Growing complexity of ecosystem marine models increases their realism and usefulness, however uncertainty in model formulation and parameterization should be evaluated in order to increase the confidence in model results. Objective of the present project is the implementation of a global sensitivity analysis of a state-of-the-art 3D biogeochemical model of the Mediterranean Sea (OPATM-BFM) currently applied in the framework of both climatological and operational oceanographic applications. The OPATM-BFM biogeochemical model is a complex ecosystem model with more than 50 state variables, spanning from the microbial and inorganic compartments to the large zooplanktons. Kinetics of chemical and biological processes and relationships among variables are non-linear and controlled by more than 200 parameters. The model has been successfully used so far for short-term forecast (www.myocean.eu.org) and for hindcast and future climate related scenarios (Lazzari et al., 2010; Lazzari et al., 2011). The global sensitivity analysis uses the Morris method, which is based on a once-at-a-time design of independent runs, which enable for a high performance in parallelization. The method is based on the evaluation of a number of elementary effects of the model output. An elementary effect is defined as the difference of two consecutive runs that differ for an elementary variation of one parameter. A sequence is done by running elementary variations for all parameters. Multiple sequences are performed optimizing the efficiency in exploring the multidimensional parameters space. The sensitivity is given by computing statistics on the elementary effects. The analysis will require the computation of ad hoc synthetic output indexes subjected to the sensitivity analysis and the statistical analysis (PCA) of temporal-spatial distribution of sensitivity indexes. A relevant by-product of the analysis is a measure of the uncertainty of the model forecasts. This sensitivity method has been successfully used for zero-dimensional complex ecosystem model (Cossarini and Solidoro, 2008), but the computational burden for its implementation on a 3D model has represented the limiting factor till now. With the world class computational resources provided within the PRACE initiative, we intend to perform the sensitivity analysis of the 3D model, exploring the 200 parameters along 50 trajectories in the parameters space for a total of 10000 simulations. Results of the present project will allow to identify the most important model parameters and ecosystem processes. The results will provide also an estimation of the model uncertainty, which can be used to constrain future projections simulated by OPATM-BFM ecosystem model. Moreover, we expect that the results will have an impact on the understanding of the functioning of 3D complex marine ecosystem models. Results will be published into international journals and used in other EU projects.\n\n​Back to Top\n\nProject Title: Numerical simulation of air flow in the human large airways\n\nProject Leader: Dr Guillaume Houzeaux, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain\n\nResource Awarded\n\n20 000 000 core hours on FERMI hosted by CINECA, Italy\n\nResearch Field: Engineering\n\nCollaborators\n\nHadrien Calmet, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain\n\nRaul de la Cruz, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain\n\nMariano Vázquez, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Spain\n\nAlberto Gambaruto, CEMAT/IST, Portugal\n\nDenis Doorly, Imperial College, United Kingdom\n\nAbstract\n\nThe human upper airways (nasal cavity and trachea) function not merely as a flow conduit but perform essential air conditioning tasks such as temperature equilibration, humidification, filtration and defence. Moreover the airways incorporate the organs or voice production and olfaction. Detailed computational modelling of the airflow is extremely demanding, given factors such as: the complexity of the geometry, the range of length and timescales and the unstable or transitional nature of the flow. Including other processes such as heat and mass exchange, the transport and deposition of dilute particle mixtures, and the motion of the boundary (imposed by the mechanics of breathing or due to flow-structure interaction) increase computational cost and add more unknowns in terms of appropriate models and parameters. Computational modelling of the three dimensional flow in anatomically accurate models is unsurprisingly limited in scope up to the present time. The state of the art numerical simulations of the upper respiratory airways comprise in a number of assumptions including simplified boundary conditions (often steady state), a rigid wall assumption, and restriction of the spatial extent of the domain modelled (for example by including just the nasal airways, or only the portion from the nasopharynx down). Furthermore, rather than direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the full equations, commonly Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and more rarely Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approximations are used. Depending on the particular biomechanical question to be addressed, some of these restrictions and approximations may prove adequate. However their impact on predictions are as yet unclear. The scope of this project relies on performing DNS large-scale computations of the fluid mechanics for extensive portions of the upper respiratory airways of different subjects (including the exterior of the face, the nasal cavity, the trachea and primary bifurcations of the lungs) for a set of flow boundary conditions to simulate cyclic breathing and sniffing. These DNS simulations of large anatomically accurate models will provide a significant insight into the complex airflow and will help understand the physiological functions. Numerical simulations of a patient-specific model have already been performed using the Alya software [1]. A study of mesh convergence, boundary conditions and software scalability have all already been performed [2]. See e.g. PRACE project 2010PA0326 and the corresponding whitepapers: “Implementing a XDMF/HDF5 Parallel File System in Alya” and “Parallel Uniform Mesh Subdivision in Alya”. The need for extensive computational resources has arisen from this study, as well as the apparent complex nature of the fluid mechanics in the airways that justifies the need for such computationally intensive studies.\n\nPublications\n\nAlister Bates, Hadrien Calmet, Raul Cetto, Denis J.

In that context, the offshore migration of wind turbines is inevitable, given the superior wind resources and much reduced acoustic and visual disturbances. In parallel, economy of scales will cause wind turbines to grow much larger, e.g. up to 20MW. It is recognized today that a simple upscaling of existing designs will not be the answer, hence the interest in a promising alternative, the Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). VAWTs can be aerodynamically as efficient as the classical horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) and there are indications that they can be significantly more densely packed in farms because of the structure of their wakes. The wake of a wind turbine is the flow region downstream of the turbine which is characterized by turbulence and lower wind energy. It can extend over large distances and greatly deteriorate the performance of any downstream wind turbine. The region closest to the rotor, the near wake, is dominated by powerful coherent flow structures, i.e. vortices generated by the rotor blades. Further downstream, in the so-called far wake, the velocity deficit has been spread over a greater area and individual large-scale vortices cannot be easily identified. The dynamics of the whole wake, in particular the rate at which it decays, thus impose the separations between wind turbines, and therefore the energy extraction capability of a farm on a given geographical concession. This project aims at investigating the physics of the wakes of VAWTs at two levels: In a first step, we study the fundamental physics of the wake of a single wind turbine. The VAWT wake morphology should differ vastly from the classical swirling wake of a horizontal axis wind turbine. It is indeed expected to lose the axisymmetric character of a HAWT wake, and rather exhibit unsteadiness and a flux of transversal linear momentum, just as an aircraft wake. How and how fast the flow relaxes to such a canonical flow are questions that the present project aims to answer. The second part of this work considers multiple wind turbines, either as an isolated cluster or as a couple of rows in a wind farm. Simulating wake effects on downstream turbines will allow determining optimal wind turbine placement and verifying the above claim of a denser packing in VAWT wind farms. The contributions of this work are far-reaching. At a fundamental level, the outcome is a better understanding of VAWT wakes and interactions. At a higher level, this could pave the way to large-scale, highly efficient offshore wind farms, required for a paradigm change in offshore energy generation.\n\nTalks\n\nS. Backaert, P.

Therefore, much effort is invested to remove the last remaining obstacles on the way to efficient power plants. On the physics side, one of the key issues to be addressed is the understanding of plasma microturbulence as it causes anomalous transport which significantly reduces the characteristical energy confinement time. Over the last two decades, numerical implementations of the appropriate theoretical framework given by gyrokinetic theory as well as the high-end supercomputing hardware equipment have evolved in a stunning manner. Hence, computer resources as made available by PRACE allow for a so far unmatched realism of gyrokinetic simulations of anomalous transport in tokamaks. Using the state-of-the-art plasma turbulence code GENE (http://gene.rzg.mpg.de), comprehensive global computations of actual ASDEX Upgrade and JET discharges involving realistic MHD equilibria, finite-beta effects, collisions, etc. will be performed, using experimental data as input – and exploiting the full potential of the new HERMIT supercomputer. In an second step, the input parameters will be extrapolated to ITER–the upcoming flagship of the nuclear fusion experiments–therefore representing simulations unprecedented in their complexity. The present project will thus constitute a significant step (“milestone”) towards a “numerical tokamak,” demonstrating the rather impressive physical and computational capabilities of present-day gyrokinetic codes on modern state-of-the-art hardware. At the same time, the targeted GENE runs will shed light on key tokamak physics issues, including a better understanding of the multi-scale nature of plasma turbulence in actual high-performance discharges of ASDEX Upgrade and JET. Thanks to the possibility to run GENE also in the local limit, the global simulations can be systematically compared to flux-tube simulations, allowing to assess the degree of nonlocality under realistic experimental conditions. Finally, targeted extended-scale flux-tube simulations will help tackle the important question if and in which cases sub-ion-scale turbulence must be retained to match the experimentally observed fluxes. This is clearly a watershed issue for future modelling efforts.\n\nPublications\n\nD. Told, F. Jenko, T. Görler, F. J. Casson, E.

Basically, the main practical applications are: solid fuel combustion (circulating fluidized bed boiler, biomass pyrolysis, chemical looping combustion) and gas-particle chemical reactor (fluid catalytic cracking, polymerization reactor, uranium fluoration). An important challenge of such numerical simulations comes from the huge range of the involved scales. Indeed, the diameter of the industrial reactors is of the order of several meters, typically, whereas the solid particle diameter is less than 100 microns. In addition, in dense gas-particle flows, the particle-particle and fluid-particle interactions lead to particle accumulation under the form of unsteady meso-structures of a few centimeters which may have a drastic effect on the global flow behavior. The numerical simulation of dense reactive fluid-particle flows is generally based on the computation of separate Eulerian transport equations governing the gas and dispersed phase local averaged variables (volume fraction, velocity, temperature ) which are coupled through interphase transfer terms. The computed particle variables represent the first order moments of the velocity probability density function and the corresponding equations are derived directly from the Boltzmann-like kinetic equation in the frame of the kinetic theory of granular media. However, for most of the practical cases, sensitivity analysis shows that affordable industrial meshes (with a few millions of cells) are too coarse to predict accurately the effect of the meso-structures. In order to overcome this problem, by analogy with Large Eddy Simulation approach in single-phase turbulent flows, we have proposed to develop the modeling of subgrid models accounting for the meso-scale effects in the resolved transport equations. Since 2008, we have been performing numerical simulations on very simplified configurations (periodic boxes) in order to investigate and to model the effect of the subgrid contributions. The mesh is refined up to compute accurately the meso-scale structures, about 20 000 000 cells (using 512 cores). Then, by applying some spatial filtering, the subgrid contributions may be extracted and analyzed in details. Such an approach allowed us to propose effective models for the subgrid velocity variance and drag contributions which are found in the resolved filtered momentum equation. The implementation of the proposed models in an industrial multiphase flow CFD software (NEPTUNE_CFD) and the application to realistic flow configurations lead to satisfactory predictions. However, the proposed models are restricted to isothermal gas-solid flow mixture with a unique diameter for the dispersed phase. In 2012, we plan to extend the model to polydispersed solid mixture and to study the effect of the meso-structures on the heat and mass interphase transfers in reactive flows. So the mesh size should not change drastically in contrast with the needed number of cores due to the increasing number of equations to compute.\n\nPublications\n\nNeau, H., Fede, P., Laviéville, J., Simonin, O., High Performance Computing (Hpc) For The Fluidization Of Particle-Laden Reactive Flows, Fluidization XIV, May 26-31, 2013, Netherlands\n\nTheses\n\nNicolas Nouyrigat, 2012, “Hydrodynamic modeling of poly-solid reactive circulating fluidized beds: Application to Chemical Looping Combustion”\n\nGuillaume Moula, 2012, “Multi-scale analyze of gas-particle reactive flow in a dense fluidized bed”\n\nAli Ozel, 2011, “Development of Large Eddy Simulation Approach for Simulation of Circulating Fluidized Beds”\n\nJean-François Parmentier, 2010, “Extension of the Euler/Euler formalism for numerical simulations of fluidized beds of Geldart A particles\n\nTalks\n\nThe team has participated to the International Conference on Multiphase Flows (ICMF) 2013 in Jeju South Corea.

There has of course been work over the past decades on how to model and simulate complex turbulent flows, but the emphasis here is on working out rules for the design of multiscale objects so as to obtain desired flow effects beneficial for particular applications. The simplest cases of multiscale shapes are fractal, which is why they have been a good start. Multiscale/fractal generation/design is about using multiscale/fractal objects (grids, fences, profilers etc) to shape the nature of the resulting turbulent flow over a broad range of scales for a broad range of applications, such as: 1. Fractal mixers: fractal grids can be used to design turbulent flows with low power losses and high turbulence intensities for intense yet economic mixing over a region of designed length and location. 2. Fractal combustors: the fractal design of a long region of high turbulence intensity and its location are of great interest for premixed combustion and may pave the way for future fractal combustors particularly adept at operating at the lean premixed combustion regime where NOx emissions are the lowest. In fact results recently obtained at Imperial College ‘s Mechanical Engineering Department suggest that fractal design seems to generate turbulent flame speeds which increase by even more than the increase in turbulence intensities! 3. Fractal spoilers and airbrakes can have significantly reduced sound pressure levels without degrading the lift and drag characteristics of the wind system. 4. Fractal wind breakers and fractal fences: a fractal fence, for example, can have increased resistance, yet be an effective fence by modifying the momentum profiles in its lee and thereby forcing deposition of particulates, snow etc where desired. The next unavoidable step towards progress in this new field of research is to perform high-fidelity Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) (combined with a new raft of experiments currently underway at Imperial College London and elsewhere) to gain fundamental understanding of the spatial structure of these flows. This is necessary to understand the origins of the above-mentioned unique properties and find strategies to utilise these properties to create new industrial applications. Such multiscale-generated turbulent flows cannot be simulated without High Performance Computing (HPC) on Tier-0 systems. They pose a formidable challenge to researchers due to complex geometries and the presence of a multitude of imposed length scales in space and in time. This requires state-of-the art top-end parallel computing for high fidelity simulations to understand the origins of the unique properties of multiscale objects and propose new strategies for industrial applications.\n\nPublications\n\nLaizet S. & Vassilicos J.C., Stirring and mixing by grid-generated turbulence in the presence of a mean scalar gradient, 4th International Conference on Jets, Wakes and Separated Flows, Nagoya, Japan – 17/09-21/09 2013\n\nVassilicos J.C. & S.

The ‘Cluster of Excellence ”Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass”(TMFB)’ funded by the German federal and state governments adopts an interdisciplinary approach to research in the area of energy utilization from renewable resources: Through the application of optimized synthesis processes, new biomass-based synthetic fuels are created while modern combustion technologies are developed simultaneously. The tailor-made characteristics of the new fuels and their potential for efficient and clean combustion procedures for combustion engines are investigated. The central objective of this research project within the TMFB cluster is to analyze the flow field under real engine conditions. The small and large scales of the turbulent flow affect the mixing significantly and interact with the flame front, thus influencing flame area, propagation speed, and the stability of the flame. During the granted period of calculation resources the focus of the simulation lies on the cold flow field during the intake and compression strokes of a four-valve single-cylinder, optical demonstrator engine at realistic engine speeds. At first, a high resolution large eddy simulations (LES) with will be performed. To analyze cyclic variability 100 – 200 consecutive cycles will be computed. Based on these results, a detailed analysis of the turbulence structures, scales, and intensities will be carried out and compared to already obtained experimental results. Since a thorough analysis of the turbulent length scales in engine flows has not been given in the literature, such an analysis will be carried out by means of proper orthogonal decomposition methods. These results will allow a high fidelity analysis of the impact of the velocity fluctuations on turbulent flame fronts and on the stability properties of the flames and thus the extinction likelihood will be determined. The LES calculation should also serve as a baseline for a subsequent direct numerical simulation (DNS). To remove the necessity of any modeling a full DNS with an adequate mesh resolution to resolve all turbulent scales will be conducted next. To obtain statistical results, 5 to 10 cycles will be computed, which is a compromise between statistical requirements and the high computational costs of the DNS computations. Such DNS simulations in internal combustion engines at realistic operating conditions have not been reported in the literature yet. The results will provide meaningful initial conditions for the subsequent computations including combustion and will allow to analyze the small- and large-scales of the flow in great detail. In addition, from this analysis, the strengths and weaknesses of the LES can be identified. DNS computations of the flow with premixed combustion at full load operation and at partial load, including direct injection, spray formation and combustion will be conducted later stages of the TMFB.\n\nPublications\n\nM.

DNS is the simplest approach conceptually to investigate turbulence, featuring the highest temporal and spatial accuracy, but it requires extraordinary powerful resources Simple wall bounded flows, as periodic channel flows or zero pressure Boundary Layers, have been intensely studied by many researchers using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). In our team, we study turbulent by-pass transition of boundary layers in the entrance region of a plane channel. For DNS, very high accuracy of the numerical method is mandatory to obtain meaningful results. Furthermore, as the computational domain is very large in the stream-wise direction, we need to solve for billions of modes, and use massively parallel computers. We have thus developed a highly parallel, spectral Galerkin method, based on an orthogonal decomposition of the divergence free velocity field into 2 orthogonal solenoidal velocity fields (Buffat et al, Computer & fluids 2011) . We have implemented the method in an efficient numerical tool, NadiaSpectral (http://ufrmeca.univ-lyon1.fr/~buffat/NadiaSp"
