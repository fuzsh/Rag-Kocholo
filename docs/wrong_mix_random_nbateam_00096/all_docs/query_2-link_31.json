From being the lead author and project manager of the first National Cyber Security Assessment for the Netherlands (CSBN) to being involved in a number high profile incidents (not as the cause, mind you) he's pretty much traveled the kill chain. Yet in the face of all this, he has managed to stay positive and reject cynicism. After 10 years at Fox-IT and NCC Group, he is now with Securify, no less confused, but still a frequent speaker at conferences and he loves to keep his bio short and to the point so that we can just get on with it.\n\nBouncing between technical deep dives and board room chatter Francisco Dominguez has been involved with security (nowadays Cybersecurity) for the last 20 years and has kept track of some of it on his personal blog. Hacking and breaking different environments by combining technical knowledge and understanding of the surrounding process has always been his main passion. For example, he was involved in the investigation of the software and processes used to support the Dutch national elections. Unfortunately, those pesky commercial NDAs don't allow the naming of other fun jobs that involved social engineering people, jumping airgaps, fences or listening to hard disks to know if they are encrypted. Most of his offensive career he worked at Fox-IT and Securify, nowadays he is viewing security from the defense side while working at Hunt & Hackett.\n\nAllison Pytlak is the Program Lead of the Cyber Program at the Stimson Center.
