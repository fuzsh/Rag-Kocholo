        "text": "The focus of this workshop is on all aspects of cryptographic hardware and security in embedded systems. The workshop will be a forum of new results from the research community as well as from the industry. Of special interest are contributions that describe new methods for efficient hardware implementations and high-speed software for embedded systems, e.g., smart cards, microprocessors, DSPs, etc. We hope that the workshop will help to fill the gap between the cryptography research community and the application areas of cryptography. Consequently, we encourage submissions from academia, industry, and other organizations. All submitted papers will be reviewed. The topics of CHES 2005 include but are not limited to:\n\nComputer architectures for public-key and secret-key cryptosystems\n\nEfficient algorithms for embedded processors\n\nReconfigurable computing in cryptography\n\nCryptographic processors and co-processors\n\nCryptography in wireless applications (mobile phone, LANs, etc.)\n\nTrusted computing platforms\n\nSmart card attacks and architectures\n\nTamper resistance on the chip and board level\n\nTrue and pseudo random number generators\n\nSpecial-purpose hardware for cryptanalysis\n\nEmbedded security\n\nCryptography for pervasive computing (e.g., RFID, sensor networks)\n\nDevice identification\n\nNonclassical cryptographic technologies\n\nSide Channel Cryptanalysis\n\nRump Session\n\nFor the second time there will be a rump session at CHES. The rump session is an informal session in which participants give short presentations on recent results, work in progress, and other topics of interest to the CHES community. Presentations that are not purely technical in nature are also possible (we are not opposed to jokes and puns!)\n\nIf you'd like to present at the rump session please write a 1/2 page abstract and drop it off at registration desk by noon (12:00) on Tuesday (August 30). Depending on the submissions received, the chairs will select a program for the Rump Session. The decisions will be published at registration desk by 18:00 on Tuesday. The presentations will be short, 3 slides max, 5 minutes max. You can use a computer or overhead slides (transparencies at registration desk).\n\nBest Paper Award(s)\n\nFor the second time at CHES, Best Paper Award(s) will be given based on the written contribution in the proceedings. The selection committee is composed of the two program chairs.\n\nCHES Banquet\n\nThe banquet takes place on Wednesday evening in the National Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street. Map and directions can be found on the CHES Banquet page.\n\nInstructions for Authors\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original papers and are strongly encouraged to use our Electronic Paper Submission System .\n\nThe submission must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. It should begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords. The paper should be at most 12 pages (excluding the bibliography and clearly marked appendices), and at most 15 pages in total, using at least 11-point font and reasonable margins. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. All submissions will be blind-refereed.\n\nOnly original research contributions will be considered. Submissions which substantially duplicate work that any of the authors have published elsewhere, or have submitted in parallel to any other conferences or workshops that have proceedings, will be instantly rejected.\n\nThe submission deadline for CHES 2005 has passed.\n\nAll deadlines end on 23:59 Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the given date. Submission deadline: March 1st, 2005. Acceptance notification: April 29th, 2005. Final Version due: May 29th, 2005. Workshop: August 29th - September 1st, 2005\n\n(after CRYPTO 2005, August 14th - 18th).\n\nMailing List\n\nIf you want to receive subsequent Call for Papers and registration information, please register for news.\n\nProgram Committee\n\nRoss Anderson, Cambridge University, UK\n\nMohammed Benaissa, The University of Sheffield, UK\n\nSuresh Chari, IBM Thomas J.

CHES '99 and CHES 2000 were held at WPI. CHES 2001 was held in Paris, CHES 2002 in the San Francisco Bay Area, CHES 2003 in Cologne, and CHES 2004 in Boston. The number of participants has grown to more than 200, with attendees coming from industry, academia, and government organizations.\n\nWorkshop Proceedings\n\nThe proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series in time for distribution at the workshop. Accepted papers should be formatted according to the NCS default author instructions (see file \"typeinst.pdf\"). Notice that in order to be included in the proceedings, the authors of an accepted paper must guarantee to present their contribution at the workshop.\n\nVisa Information\n\nVery few conference attendees (if any) will need to obtain visas for entering the UK. A list of countries whose nationals are affected is given here. Some of the larger countries in the list are Turkey, India, Pakistan, China and Taiwan. The UK Home and Foreign Offices provide an anonymous on-line questionnaire here which will determine whether a visa is required. The process of obtaining the visa is usually fast and painless. Please contact the general chair if you need a letter of sponsorship to support an application."
