A marine coring project will take place with the University of Patras in the summer of 2016.\n\nThis project addresses issues that resonate with current teaching and research priorities at UC San Diego and the UCOP Catalyst project. The End of the Greek Bronze Age: Cyber and Marine Archaeology Around the Gulf of Corinth project is a land and marine study concerning climate change during the Holocene/Anthropocene, social evolutionary processes related to terrestrial and marine transport, and the history of the Eastern Mediterranean at a time when the major civilizations of the Late Bronze (ca. 1300 – 1190 BC) collapsed. One stimulus for initiating this project is the current UC San Diego-wide Understanding and Protecting the Planet (UPP) initiative that focuses on climate change impacts and adaptation. To fully understand how humans adapt to the dynamics of climate change, it is imperative to take a ‘deep-time’ perspective to this problem. Focusing on environmental trends over the past century is insufficient to understand the range and variety of both natural and human responses to climate and anthropogenic change. The only discipline that can provide the needed deep-time intertwined data concerning climate and human interaction is archaeology. The proposed project is the first part of a much larger interdisciplinary and transcontinental investigation of the Anthropocene over the past 10,000 years in coastal environments extending from the eastern Mediterranean to India and China (for which large external grants will be sought). The proposed project should be considered a ‘proof of concept’ whose results will help secure large grants.\n\nLocator map\n\nThe Anthropocene is a suggested geological epoch when human activities began to have global impacts on ecosystems and the earth’s geology. Anthropocene is not an internationally recognized term but it is extremely useful as a conceptual model for investigating when human modification of the global environment became significant enough to warrant a new geological epoch (Crutzen and Stoemer 2000; Smith and Zeder 2013). In many respects, the Anthropocene is co-terminus with the Holocene, the geological epoch that started at the end of the Pleistocene, ca. 11,700 BP (Before Present) and continues to the present. Accordingly the Anthropocene is co-terminus with major human/environmental transformations over the past 10,000 years from the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna (such as giant sloths, saber-toothed cats, mammoths, etc.) around 13,800 BP, to the Neolithic revolution (ca. 11,000 – 9,000 BP), all the way to the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries AD, to the impact of atomic detonations in the 20th century AD. Thus, investigations of the Anthropocene focus on when and how exactly humans attained dominance of earth’s microenvironments. The proposed project will address this problem by focusing on one part of the Eastern Mediterranean – and one time slice in the Holocene that has both culture-history and environmental resonance with the problem of deep-time studies of climate change. We will examine a topic of great interest to anthropologists, historians, climate scientists and other researchers: the collapse of Late Bronze Age (LBA - ca. mid-13th to mid-12th century BC) civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean, including the Mycenaean kingdom in Greece, the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and Syria, and the New Kingdom of Egypt that extended into the region of Syro-Palestine. This opened up new opportunities for small-scale societies to emerge on the historical scene such as the Israelites, the Sea Peoples, Edomites and many others in the Eastern Mediterranean. The possible causes for the collapse are varied and range from environmental (climate change, drought, volcanic eruptions) and cultural (migrations and warfare; new iron production technologies, multi-causal explanations). The proposed project will focus on the issue of the LBA collapse in Mycenaean Greece."
