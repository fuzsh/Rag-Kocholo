In other scenarios, mobile robot systems are used for public safety purposes in the case of disaster situations. Flying robot systems may be used to analyze a chemical plume on a wide area to get information used to predict the behavior of the plume after incidents to be able to alert the population. In most cases, not only one mobile robot system is used, but a couple of these systems to cooperatively support tasks like the ones mentioned before. For an efficient usage, these swarms of mobile robot systems build up a communication network to cover a wide area. Driven by the context of the scenarios, these mobile robot systems are used in, different requirements regarding their communication network exist and context-aware performance management becomes necessary. Context-aware performance management has many facets and, thus, tailored QoS schemes are required to provide an appropriate level of QoS for different types of scenarios, applications and services for mobile robot systems, considering different types of wireless technologies, multiple interface and more. This keynote will give an overview on different scenarios and their specific challenges regarding the performance in the communication networks of those mobile robot systems.\n\nBiosketch: Patrick-Benjamin Bök received his B.Sc.

Ammari, University of Michigan-Dearborn, USA\n\nAbstract: Indoor localization is often based on location fingerprinting. For good accuracy, the training set of sample fingerprints should be sufficiently large to be well-representative of the environment in terms of both spatial coverage and temporal coverage. As such, the computation required during the positioning phase can be expensive because we have to evaluate each new fingerprint against the training data repeatedly over time. It is desirable, therefore, to optimize computational efficiency, not just localization accuracy. Existing techniques are far from this goal due to their polarization toward only criterion. This talk introduces our recent findings on using spatially hierarchical learning and graph regularization methods to improve both accuracy and efficiency. Our results are better than the state of the art.\n\nBiosketch: Dr. Duc A.

In this talk, we provide some case studies of introduction of network coding at different layers and at different nodes in the network. We consider implementations of network coding at the transport layer and the MAC layer. Using these examples, we distill some possible architectural principles and posit that introduction of coding at several layers simultaneously may provide cumulative gains. We argue that coding at several layers and in several nodes can yield cumulative benefits without the need for explicit cross-layer or inter-node coordination.\n\nSpeaker Info: Muriel Médard is a Professor in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT.

A single Web search at a data center can involve hundreds of hosts, which makes it important to support fast, reliable, and secure intra-datacenter communications. A high bandwidth network is necessary to support large-scale MapReduce/Hadoop style (offline) data analysis computations. Commercial data center networks typically use Ethernet-switched and/or IP-routed networks, while InfiniBand is popular in scientific data centers for their lower latency. New technologies such as hybrid packet/circuit optical networks, research solutions such as VL2, and other approaches that go beyond 100G are being explored. In parallel, standardization efforts include IETF TRILL and IEEE 802.1Q shortest-path bridging.\n\nModerator Info: Malathi Veeraraghavan is a Professor in the Charles L.

But many of us spend up to 90% of our time indoors, often out of reach of satellite and macrocell signals. Despite the great utility and promise of context-aware, site-specific services and decades of research on localization technologies few indoor positioning systems are deployed today, even in heavily populated public spaces. I argue that the confluence of several technologies (e.g., smartphones, sensors, small cells) suggest that indoor positioning system deployments will now accelerate quickly. I will share our observations in developing indoor localization systems using enterprise Radio Access Networks, and discuss the challenges both researchers and practitioners face as conventional enterprise data networks are re-cast to embrace Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) and the increased presence of mobile network operators.\n\nSpeaker Info: Jack Brassil received the B.S. degree from the Polytechnic Institute of New York in 1981, the M.Eng. degree from Cornell University in 1982, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, San Diego, in 1991, all in electrical engineering.

This is mainly due to the proven practice to overprovision Internet links, - often up to seventy percent, thus allowing for accommodation of unpredictably large packet flows, while keeping the network stable and resilient against attacks and failures. Even with major operational benefits, the practice of overprovision is known for its high capital and operational expenses. At first glance, dynamic optical circuits can address the downsides of overprovision, as they can be setup to bypass any congested or faulty IP links and they are comparably less expensive. However, the two networks -optical and Internet, have evolved as two fundamentally different and separately managed ecosystems, and cannot easily operate in harmony. In this talk, I will discuss why past approaches to deploy dynamic optical circuits have not been widely adopted for IP routing, - from the point of view of network management, and present our research ideas on how Internet can effectively use optical circuits. I will talk about the importance of new systems research and present new directions in theoretical studies in this field, including an analysis of the effects of dynamic optical circuit setup on IP routing. Finally, I will give a practical outlook from our EU Project ONE (www.ict-one.eu), focusing on network management aspects of optical networks and the Internet coordination.\n\nSpeaker Info: Admela Jukan is Chair Professor of Communication Networks at the Technische Universität Carolo-Wilhelmina zu Braunschweig (Brunswick) in Germany.

SDN or Software Defined Networks present a separation between networking hardware and software, making a number of network functions, previously built into the network, explicitly programmable by an operator. This separation allows to view SDN as network virtualization mechanism. This panel will discuss the intersection of these two concepts and the mutual relationship between them from the perspective of SDN controllers, equipment vendors and transport networks.\n\nModerator Info: Ilya Baldin leads RENCI’s network research and infrastructure programs. He is a networking researcher with a wide range of interests, including high-speed optical network architectures, cross-layer interactions, novel signaling schemes and network security. Before coming to RENCI, Baldine was the principal scientist at the Center for Advanced Network Research at the Research Triangle Institute, and a network research engineer at the Advanced Network Research group at MCNC, where was a team member and a leader of a number of federally funded research efforts. He holds Ph.D. and MS degrees in computer science from North Carolina State University.\n\nPanelist Info:\n\nKristin Rauschenbach’s technical expertise is in the area of optical networking including wideband optical network systems and components as well as network management, control, and security. She has worked in both the government and commercial sectors in the area of data communications and telecommunications fiber optic networks. One of her current research interests is in control plane technology for optical transport SDN.\n\nGary Berger: Technology strategist with 23 years experience in systems and application development currently working in Cisco's Chief Strategy Office where he focuses on distributed computing and SDN.
