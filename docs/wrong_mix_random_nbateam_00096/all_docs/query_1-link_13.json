In this line, EATEL has initiated a Webinar series on “Transversal topics in Technology-Enhanced Learning”, which offers an space to discuss overarching aspects related to TEL research. These overarching aspects will consider important challenges for our field that are derived from its own nature (e.g. interdisciplinarity) and from key issues in Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). These RRI issues go from gender and diversity equality and inclusion, to public engagement, sustainability, ethics, and open science.\n\nWebinar 4 “What do we mean with Learning Engineering & Technology-Enhanced Learning?”\n\nJuly 9th, 2020, at 2pm CET\n\nDialog between Jim Goodell and Mikhail Fominykh,\n\nmoderated by Davinia Hernández-Leo and Christian Glahn\n\nThe fourth edition of the Webinar series is entitled “What do we mean with Learning Engineering & Technology-Enhanced Learning?”. An intersection of disciplines from educational/social sciences and technology/engineering domains has led to an interdisciplinary field of research and professional practice. Different names are being used to refer to this field, from educational and learning technologies to technology-enhanced learning and, more recently, learning engineering.\n\nTechnology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) was coined in the context of working groups initiated by the European Commission in 2000. The term is now broadly used to designate “a field of research aiming at improving learning by integrating current technologies and designing innovative ones” (Bourdeau & Balacheff, 2013) and has been adopted by the European Association in the field (EATEL), the well-established European Conference on Technology-Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL), or by the JTEL Summer School (JTELSS).\n\nAccording to (Blake-Plock, 2018) “the term Learning Engineer dates back to at least 1966 when it was used by Herbert Simon, professor of computer science and psychology at the Carnegie Institute of Technology to describe a class of professionals who would be experts in designing learning experiences.” However, the term has recently gained more attention given the initiative starting in late 2017 by the IEEE IC Industry Consortium on Learning Engineering (ICICLE) to develop a profession within the field of engineering focused on the application of technology and learning science.\n\nIn the first part of the dialog, Jim Goodle (ICICLE) will elaborate on the term “Learning Engineering” and the current efforts by ICICLE towards a definition of the profession. Mikhail Fominykh (EATEL) will explain what we mean by TEL and the current efforts in Europe towards the training of future TEL researchers and practitioners. The second part of the dialog will consist of a ‘questions & answers debate’ by the two speakers, with participation of the audience. The dialog will be moderated by Davinia Hernández-Leo and Christian Glahn, both involved in EATEL and ICICLE.\n\nJim Goodell is a member of the ICICLE steering committee. He is co-author of Student-Centered Learning: Functional Requirements for Integrated Systems to Optimize Learning. He is a nationally recognized expert on education data standards and leader of standards development for the Common Education Data Standards (ceds.ed.gov). His work has led to greater coordination among key national and international data standards organizations. He works with leaders at state and local education agencies, education service providers, post-secondary institutions, and federal program staff on data standards, next generation learning models, strategic planning, organizational development, policy development, process improvement, data systems architecture/policies, and technology implementation. He is a nationally recognized speaker and author on education data for personalized learning and formative assessment processes.\n\nMikhail Fominykh is the member of the EATEL board and the general chair of the EATEL Summer School on Technology-Enhanced Learning. Mikhail is also the coordinator of the Doctoral Education for Technology-Enhanced Learning DE-TEL project that aims to build a reference model for doctoral education in TEL. Mikhail holds a research position at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and an associate professor position at the Molde University College, Norway.\n\nBourdeau, J., & Balacheff, N.

Dordrecht: Springer\n\nWebinar 1 “Open Science in Technology-Enhanced Learning”, May 3rd 2018, at 3pm CET\n\nDialog between Justin Reich and Malte Elson, moderated by Davinia Hernández-Leo and Stian Håklev\n\nThe topic chosen for the first edition of the Webinar series is “Open Science as it applies to TEL”. Open Science is a critical issue considered by the research community at large. The ongoing phenomenon of Open Science promotes on the one hand, transparent and frequent open-access updates of research progress; and other other hand, reproducible, accurate and verifiable research, bringing benefits for the individual researchers, the research community and the society. Like other fields, TEL research suffers from problems such as challenges to replicate, validity, publication bias, and high costs of access to publications. There are several initiatives that aim to change closed and nontransparent approaches to research. This Webinar will discuss the benefits, challenges, recommendations and best practices of Open Science in TEL.\n\nMalte Elson is an assistant professor and head of the Psychology of Human Technology Interaction group at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany where he studies human learning.
