During this pivotal time at Rochester and through his work at the Institute and Laboratory for Laser Energetics, Kafka met many lifelong friends and colleagues, including several future OSA Presidents Susan Houde-Walter, Ian Walmsley and Donna Strickland, who was also awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1983, Kafka started as a Senior Scientist at Spectra-Physics Lasers, where he has held a series of positions with increasing responsibility including Chief Business Unit Technology Officer. He was recently named a Fellow of MKS, the parent company of Spectra-Physics. During the past 36 years, he designed several of the company’s most significant products, including the Tsunami, the first commercial ultrafast Ti:sapphire laser (1990), the Millennia X, the first commercial 10 W solid-state green laser (1997), and the InSight, the first broadly tunable ultrafast source for microscopy (2011). Kafka was recognized as a Spectra-Physics Fellow in 1987. He also received the Thermo Electron Corporate Award for Technical Innovation in 2002 and the first Newport Corporation Strategic Patent Award in 2007 for his patent of the first diode-pumped double-clad fiber laser. Kafka has over 40 United States patents and multiple foreign equivalents. He has more than 30 publications in refereed journals and has made more than 40 presentations at CLEO, OSA topical meetings, SPIE conferences and at major universities. Kafka recently presented a plenary talk at the 2018 IEEE Photonics Conference. Kafka has served the professional community as the Ultrafast Topical Editor for JOSA B (1994-1995), Lasers Technical Group Chair (1995-1997), and on a dozen conference organizing committees. He has served as the CLEO program chair (1999), CLEO general chair (2001) and on the CLEO Steering Committee (1997–2001). He completed a three-year sequence as the Program and General Chair of the Advanced Solid-State Photonics topical meeting (2009-2011). Kafka was named an OSA Fellow in 2005 and served as a Director at Large on the OSA Board of Directors from 2012 to 2014. He was a member (2015) and chair (2016) of the prestigious Charles Hard Townes Medal Committee. One of his favorite contributions to the optics community has been serving as a Distinguished Traveling Lecturer for the APS Division of Laser Science from 1999 to the present.\n\nClara Saraceno\n\nRuhr-Universität Bochum, Germany\n\nClara Saraceno was born in Argentina in 1983 and studied at the Institut d’Optique in Palaiseau, France. After completing her studies she first went into industry from 2007 to 2008, working for a laser manufacturer (Coherent Inc.) in the USA. She then continued her academic training in Switzerland, completing a doctorate in Physics at ETH Zurich in 2012 which brought her, amongst others, the 2013 QEOD Thesis Prize, awarded by the Electronics and Optics Division of the European Physical Society. After graduation, Saraceno has worked at ETH Zurich and the University of Neuchatel as a postdoctoral researcher. Most recently, her research work on high-power ultrafast lasers earned her the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (2015). In 2016, she was appointed as Professor in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology in the Ruhr University Bochum, where she currently works on ultrafast laser physics and terahertz technology.\n\nEric Van Stryland\n\nCREOL, USA\n\nEric Van Stryland received a PhD in Physics in 1976, from the Univ. of Arizona, Optical Sciences Center, where he worked on optical coherent transients and photon counting statistics. He worked in femtosecond pulse production, multiphoton absorption, and laser induced damage at the Center for Laser Studies, Univ. of Southern California. He joined the physics department at the Univ. of North Texas in l978 helping to form the Center for Applied Quantum Electronics. In l987 he joined the newly formed CREOL (Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers) at the Univ. of Central Florida. NSF and DoD have funded him for the past 30 years. His current research interests are in the characterization of the nonlinear optical properties of materials and their temporal response as well as the applications of these nonlinear materials properties for optical switching, beam control etc. He developed the Z-scan technique and established the methodology for applying Kramers-Kronig relations to ultrafast nonlinearities and developed the field of cascaded second-order effects. The JQE publication on Z-scan has been noted as the most highly cited paper in the journal’s 30 year history by a factor of 2. He is a fellow of the Optical Society of America (OSA), IEEE, SPIE and APS, a past member of the OSA and LIA Boards of Directors, former co-chair of the OSA Science and Engineering Council. He also served as a topical editor for Optics Letters. He was elected President of the OSA for 2006. He graduated 31 Ph.D.’s and published ~300 papers and is on the ISI ‘highly cited’ list. In 2003 he was awarded the highest honor UCF bestows, the Pegasus Award (earlier he was co-recipient of UNT’s highest award). He was Director of the School of Optics/CREOL from 1999 to 2004. With the elevation of the School to a College, he became its first Dean. In addition, Governor Jeb Bush established the Florida Photonics Center of Excellence (FPCE) in 2003 and he was the Director of that Center along with CREOL, both centers within the College. In a second round of centers of excellence, the College established the Townes Laser Institute named after the inventor of the maser and laser, Charles Hard Townes. In January, 2009 he retired as Dean but continues as a faculty member in the College, and he received UCF’s Researcher of the Year Award. He became a Trustee Chair in 2012, and was awarded the R.W. Wood Prize of the OSA in 2012.\n\nAgenda\n\nMonday, 19 July\n\nWelcome, Introductions and Ice Breaker\n\nChad Stark, OSA Foundation Executive Director\n\nLaser Spectroscopy Applied to the Environmental, Ecological, Agricultural and Food Safety Areas\n\nSune Svanberg, Lund University\n\nLaser-Based Spectroscopy To Meet Some Challenges in Medicine\n\nKatarina Svanberg, Lund University\n\nFacilitated Recap and End of Day 1\n\nTuesday, 20 July\n\nNew Perspective for Imaging at Depth\n\nKishan Dholakia, University of St. Andrews\n\nFacilitated Recap with Co-Hosts Eric Rosas and Jens Biegert\n\nBreak/Snack Time/Power Nap/Meditation\n\nOptical Micromanipulation on Nano and Microscale\n\nHalina Rubinsztein-Dunlop, University of Queensland\n\nFacilitated Recap with Co-Hosts Eric Rosas and Jens Biegert\n\nAdditional Programming\n\nAsk Me Anything Session with Halina Rubinsztein-Dunlop\n\nAsk Me Anything Session with Kishan Dholakia\n\nWednesday, 21 July\n\nMaking New Connections Networking Activity\n\nLaser Radar Sensing of Chemical Plumes and Atmospheric Trace Gases\n\nTim Carrig, Lockheed Martin\n\nFacilitated Recap with Co-Hosts Eric Rosas and Jens Biegert\n\nAdditonal Programming\n\nAsk Me Anything Session with Tim Carrig\n\nThursday, 22 July\n\nSilicon Photonics Turns Pervasive\n\nRoel Baets, Ghent University\n\nFacilitated Recap with Co-Hosts Eric Rosas and Jens Biegert\n\nAdditional Programming\n\nAsk Me Anything Session with Roel Baets\n\nFriday, 23 July\n\nMaking New Connections Networking Activity"
