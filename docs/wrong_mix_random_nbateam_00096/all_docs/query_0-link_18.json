        "text": "About\n\nHi, my name is Sebastian Ãsterlund. I currently work as an Offesive Security Researcher at Intel STORM/ SPEAR. Previously I was a PhD Candidate at the Systems and Network Security Group (VUsec) at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. My research was funded by Cisco. Before joining Intel STORM, I did an internship at Intel, working on Linux Kernel fuzzing for TDX guests.\n\nPreviously I have taught the university courses Project Application Development and Advanced Operating Systems.\n\nBefore joining the VUsec group I was a masterâs student at the same university, studying Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems.\n\nAt the VU I also worked as a Teaching-Assistant in the Department of Computer Science. Some of the courses for which I have been a TA/ am currently teaching:\n\nProject Application Development\n\nAlgorithm Engineering\n\nComputer Networks\n\nCompiler Construction\n\nEquational Programming\n\nIntroduction to Programming (Java)\n\nProgramming for Economists (Python)\n\nDatastructures and Algorithms\n\nPervasive Computing\n\nComputer Systems\n\nAdvanced Programming\n\nWeb Technologies\n\nDatabases\n\nFor more info you can have a look at my curriculum vitae.\n\nAfter finishing high-school at Katedralskolan in Turku, Finland, I decided to start studying in the Netherlands. I completed my bachelorâs in Computer Science at the VU in 2015.\n\nFor my Bachelor thesis I developed a defense against Just-in-Time Return-Oriented-Programming (JIT-ROP) attacks using execute-only memory: Strengthening diversification defenses by means of a non-readable code segment.\n\nFor my Masterâs thesis I developed a defense against kernel-level exploits: Detecting information leaks using kernel-level multi-variant execution . The ASPLOS 2019 paper on kMVX is titled kMVX: Detecting Kernel Information Leaks with Multi-variant Execution. Also available here: kMVX: Detecting Kernel Information Leaks with Multi-variant Execution.\n\nI did some work on speculative execution-based side-channels: RIDL: Rogue In-flight Data Load (S&P 2019) that got some significant media attention (Wired, Ars Technica, Engadget, Red Hat, New York Times).\n\nFields of interest:\n\nSystems security\n\nOperating Systems\n\nDistributed Systems\n\nGPU Programming\n\nBinary analysis\n\nCompilers\n\nFuzzing\n\nSide-channels\n\nHere is a list of some of the programming languages and technologies that I have experience with:\n\nRust\n\nC/ C++\n\nPython\n\nJava\n\nGo\n\nLLVM\n\nHaskell\n\nDocker, Kubernetes\n\nHadoop, Spark\n\nPublications\n\nTalks:\n\nLinux Security Summit North America 2023, Virtual, MPK/PKS Linux Kernel Compartmentalization\n\nIntel DTTC 2022, Virtual, TDX Guest Kernel Fuzzing\n\nInfoSecurity.dk Keynote 2020, Copenhagen, RIDL: Rogue In-Flight Data Load\n\nNLUUG Najaarsconferentie 2019, Utrecht, RIDL: Rogue In-Flight Data Load\n\nInfoSecurity.nl Jaarbeurs, Utrecht, RIDL: Rogue In-Flight Data Load\n\nHITB CyberWeek 2019, Abu Dhabi, RIDL: Rogue In-Flight Data Load\n\nOffzone 2019, Moscow, RIDL: Rogue In-Flight Data Load\n\nCySep 2019, Stockholm, kMVX: Detecting Kernel Information Leaks with Multi-variant Execution\n\nCisco internal talk, Knoxville, TN, kMVX: Detecting Kernel Information Leaks with Multi-variant Execution and RIDL: Rogue In-Flight Data Load\n\nOther work\n\nI was featured in LiveOverflowâs video How The RIDL CPU Vulnerability Was Found\n\nI did a radio interview on Intel CPU vulnerabilites on Dutch radio (NPO1).\n\nTogether with some colleagues we analysed the election software used in the Netherlands, and found it to be seriously vulnerable in multiple ways.\n\nAwards\n\n2022 Intel Security Leadership award for TDX Linux Guest kernel hardening and fuzzing\n\n2021 ASPLOS Distinguished Paper Award for our paper Whoâs Debugging the Debuggers? Exposing Debug Information Bugs in Optimized Binaries.\n\n2020 Dutch Cybersecurity Research Award (DCSRP) for RIDL: Rogue In-flight Data Load."
