        "text": "06/07/2022 - DTS achieves 2nd place at the Service Provider Award 2022 in the category IT System House & Value Added Reseller (VAR)\n\nNominated by an external jury of experts, we as DTS won the Service Provider Award 2022 for 2nd place in the IT System House & Value Added Reseller (VAR) category in an independent and free vote. The category had the most nominations listed. A big thank you therefore goes above all to our customers and generally to everyone who took part in the voting for us.\n\nThis year the addition of \"Value Added Reseller (VAR)\" was added to the category. So the nomination and the final 2nd place in this category show above all: We can be proud of the fact that we have established ourselves as a service or solution provider and that \"DTS\" is now associated with special managed services and important added values.\n\n05/12/2021 - workshop about digitalization with IPH and DTS Systeme\n\nThe digital transformation brings with it many opportunities, but also just as many questions. Our cooperation with IPH has set itself the task of answering these questions. Together, we designed a workshop last year that will finally take place in 2021. The workshop will last one day and is intended for managers and decision-makers from different areas of the company. In the process, we will not only show what opportunities industry 4.0 offers, but also the necessary solutions in the area of IT security. Of course, we also work out individual insights with you. Finally, we would like to define concrete, specific goals, e.g., which solutions really make sense for your company and how the digitalization project should be approached in concrete terms.\n\n11/20/2020 - SASE Partner of the Year & CYBERFORCE Partner SE of the Year\n\nHaving already been honored with the Elite Diamond partner of the year and Cortex partner of the year, we are now pleased to receive more awards from Palo Alto Networks!\n\nAs SASE partner of the year EMEA we have contributed the largest EMEA Prisma Access/SASE project of the year. Additionally, the honor relates to the integration of the technology into our managed services. We have also enabled several Prisma Access SEs to be able to conduct their own Prisma Access/SASE UTDs, demos and PoCs.\n\nAs EMEA CYBERFORCE partner SE of the year, our Head of Cyber Security Services, Markus Kohlmeier, was specifically honored. The spotlight is on his focus, commitment and support with Palo Alto Networks. He was also instrumental in the architectural design of the Prisma Access and Cortex solution for the above project. In addition, Markus Kohlmeier is fully certified for all technologies, a multiple Cyberforce Hero and a qualified trainer.\n\n02/19/2019 - DTS IT AG acquires majority in IT security software producer ISL\n\nDTS IT AG has acquired 66% of the shares in ISL Internet Sicherheitslösungen GmbH. ISL is a leading German software manufacturer in the field of IT security with a focus on network access control (NAC). Well-known companies from industry, trade, banks, public authorities and research institutes rely on ISL's ARP-GUARD software to protect their IT infrastructure against internal attacks as well as unnoticed intrusion of unauthorized devices.\n\nISL, with the support of DTS and its parent company MBB SE, aims to continue its growth path in the increasingly important IT security market. Within the market, the area of NAC is becoming increasingly important with an expected annual growth of over 30%. A major growth driver is the Internet of Things (IoT), which significantly increases the number of existing devices in the corporate network. ISL software products efficiently secure corporate networks, which are becoming more and more complex due to a multitude of different devices.\n\nISL was founded in 1999 by Dr. Andreas Rieke, who will remain a shareholder of ISL and continue to manage the company. As early as 2003, ISL was one of the first companies worldwide to develop and sell software solutions for network access control. In recent years, ISL has been able to significantly increase its turnover, which is currently in the single-digit million range, and grow very profitably. ISL will continue to develop IT security \"Made in Germany\" at its headquarters in Bochum, where the Max Planck Institute for Cyber Security was recently established. The trusting cooperation with the company's current partners is also to be continued under the umbrella of DTS and MBB SE.\n\nFor DTS IT AG, the acquisition of ISL is an important step towards further growth in the future market of IT security. In recent years, DTS has succeeded in becoming a leading partner of manufacturers of innovative IT security solutions. With its own cloud services as well as a Security Operations Center (SOC), in which security experts monitor customers' corporate networks around the clock, DTS was able to increase its revenue to more than €50 million in 2018 and also expects significant growth in the coming years. The future cooperation with ISL represents an important milestone in the company's history and will further raise the profile of DTS as a holistic IT security provider.\n\nDr. Andreas Rieke, Managing Director of ISL, is delighted about MBB's entry: \"With MBB, we have gained a strong partner who will support ISL's growth course. NAC software is currently gaining dramatically in importance for many companies and with ARP-GUARD we offer one of the technologically leading solutions in this market.\"\n\nKai Mallmann, CEO of DTS, emphasizes: \"ISL is a perfect fit for DTS as a software specialist in the growing IT security market. We are looking forward to growing further in this exciting area together with Dr. Rieke and the employees of ISL.\""
