S-parameter files, while useful, ubiquitous and very portable, only represent the way a specific device behaves in the test fixture environment and test conditions used for the characterization. Physically motivated equivalent circuit models, properly developed, can be setup to scale accurately with part value, substrate properties and other parameters, such as solder pad dimensions. This advance is a marked improvement and today used by many designers world-wide. Still sometimes circuit simulation is not sufficient for pre-build risk management for microwave/mm-wave designs involving compact topologies and dense circuit implementations.\n\nAccordingly, full-wave 3D Electromagnetic (EM) analysis has become a crucial step for radio frequency (RF) to account for possible electromagnetic coupling interactions between microwave components and between components and their surrounding shielding and interconnect environment. This unexpected coupling can result in performance degradation and, in turn, lead to costly and lengthened design cycles. Assembling the necessary geometry for completing full-wave analysis that includes representations of such passive devices as packaged and surface mount devices, packages and connectors, requires close collaboration, and in many cases reluctant sharing of manufacturing IP details, between vendors and customers of vendors and model providers. New technology, recently available in some simulators, such as ANSYS HFSS, allows for encrypting manufacturing IP that better enables 3D EM models to be shared with a wider design community. The wider availability of encrypted 3D EM component model libraries, such as being developed under a new partnership between Modelithics and ANSYS, is anticipated to lead to a paradigm shift in the industry. This paradigm shift is making it much easier for designers to perform comprehensive pre-build full-wave EM analyses that reduce design risk and re-work and improve time-to-market for today’s increasingly compact and complex product form factors.\n\nWorkshop Abstract:\n\nThis workshop will focus on the basic principles behind non-linear power amplifier design and simulation-based design methods utilizing Keysight Advanced Design System software. Examples will include a basic Class AB PA Design that addresses stability considerations and is designed against a specific set of gain, power, efficiency and VSWR considerations. Extensions to address other high-efficiency modes of operation such as Class F, Class J and Doherty amplifier configurations will be discussed briefly. PA design simulation demonstrations will be performed using state-of-the-art non-linear GaN models available from Modelithics for a range of Qorvo GaN power transistors. Examples of successfully completed PA designs will also be presented.\n\nYonina Eldar is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rechovot, Israel.

If the simulated solution is unstable, it will not be able to recover from the small perturbations that are always present in real life, so the solution measured for the same conditions will be different from the simulated one. Undesired behaviours include oscillations, frequency divisions, hysteresis and chaos. Their a posteriori correction is impossible in integrated technologies, whereas in hybrid technologies trial and error procedures turn out to be inefficient in most cases, since they are applied without an identification and understanding of the instability phenomenon causing malfunction. As a result, the problem will arise again in new prototypes, thus increasing the production cycles and the final cost.\n\nThe course will enable a good understanding of the stability concept and the causes of the most common types of instability phenomena, and will provide practical simulation tools for an efficient prediction of these phenomena at the design stage. The course will address the stability analysis in small- and large-signal regime. Different approaches will be presented, with emphasis on the Nyquist criterion and pole-zero identification. Qualitative changes in the circuit stability properties under variations of crucial parameters, such as input power or bias voltage, are predicted with a global stability analysis. A bifurcation is a qualitative change of stability of the circuit solution or in the number of steady-state solutions when the parameter is varied continuously. The bifurcations delimit the stable operation ranges of circuits that are not expected to oscillate, such as power amplifiers or frequency multipliers. On the other hand, they are essential in circuits of autonomous nature, such as free and injection-locked oscillators and frequency dividers, as they lead these circuits to the intended operation mode. In the course, the most common types of bifurcation will be presented and classified, so that the designer may indentify the bifurcation phenomena in measurement and simulation. It will present practical examples of instability and bifurcations in nonlinear circuits such as power amplifiers, frequency multipliers, frequency dividers and voltage controlled oscillators. The impact of instability on the circuit performance (for instance, in the measured spectrum or its response to parameter variations) will be shown, and systematic and efficient stabilization procedures will be presented.\n\nIndex of topics\n\nTypes of steady-state solutions of nonlinear circuits.\n\nFundamentals of harmonic-balance analysis.\n\n2.1 Comparison with time-domain simulations.\n\n2.2 Difficulties in the analysis of oscillatory solutions.\n\n2.3 Complementary techniques for the analysis of oscillations.\n\nStability.\n\n3.1 Concept.\n\n3.2 Fundamentals of the stability analysis of constant and periodic solutions.\n\n3.3 Rollet stability analysis.

The new topologies take advantage of the capability of oscillator circuits to combine the inherent signal generation with specific functions, such a mixing or phase shifting. However, this function integration comes at the cost of an increase in the complexity of the circuit operation, which must simultaneously fulfill a number of mathematical conditions in a system of autonomous nature. The talk focuses on realistic and easy-to-use analysis methodologies for these novel circuits. In self-injection locked radar, the oscillator signal is transmitted to the moving target and reinjected into the oscillator with a phase modulation, induced by the target movement. In compact and low-cost RFID readers the oscillator signal is controlled with a ramp generator and transmitted through an antenna, and the variations in the oscillator load impedance, induced by the tag resonators, give rise to a modulation of the oscillator frequency. The talk will present a new analysis methodology, which makes use of an oscillator model extracted from harmonic-balance simulations and insightful analytical expressions for the description of the oscillator interaction with the environment. As another example, super-regenerative oscillators are able to replace costly amplifier chains in receivers by taking advantage of the initial exponential growth of the oscillation signal. Here they will be analyzed through the extraction of a linear time-variant transfer function in the envelope domain, from which their response to any arbitrarily modulated input signal is efficiently derived. Finally, switchless reconfigurable oscillators, of practical interest in modern multiband communication systems, will be considered.\n\nMei Song Tong received the B.S. and M.S.

In 1974, together with his PhD thesis advisor at CALTECH – Amnon Yariv, he made pioneering contributions to the fundamental theory of FEL (full classical formulation including the high gain and collective operating regimes). In Tel-Aviv University, his FEL research group has developed an electrostatic accelerator FEL oscillator based on the Tandem accelerator of the Weizmann Institute and demonstrated lasing in 1999 with world record (at the time) narrow linewidth (10-6). This FEL was the basis of the present Israeli Center for Radiation Sources and Applications of Ariel and Tel-Aviv Universities (FEL Knowledge Center) that he heads. The center includes a long pulse mm-wave FEL oscillator and a Photo-cathode RF-Gun 6MeV accelerator that was constructed in collaboration with UCLA PBPL for demonstrating his preconceived scheme of a superradiant FEL THz radiation source.
