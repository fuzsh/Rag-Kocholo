A significant portion\n\nof these threats is attributed to the broadcast nature of wireless\n\ntransmissions. Using commodity radio hardware, unauthorized parties can easily\n\neavesdrop on over-the-air transmissions and breach the privacy of communicating\n\nusers by tracking their whereabouts and movements, and inferring their\n\nassociations, health state and preferences. Common (application-level)\n\ncryptographic mechanisms fail to provide adequate security and privacy, as they\n\nleave low-level transmission identifiers open to traffic analysis. In this\n\ntalk, I will present various examples of leaked transmission signatures and\n\ndiscuss how they have been used to breach user privacy and launch sophisticated\n\njamming attacks. I will then present various mitigation techniques for\n\nobfuscating wireless fingerprints and countering malicious eavesdropping over\n\nthe wireless medium.\n\nMarwan Krunz is a professor of ECE and CS at the University of Arizona.

PR non-maximally decimated analysis/synthesis chains are used for performing resampling, channelization and filtering in very wideband software defined radios. Digital wideband filtering is limited by the hardware clock speed, which constrains the maximum signal bandwidth that can be processed digitally. Cascade analysis and synthesis filter banks partition the high sample rate input signal into multiple low sample rate parallel processing paths that reduce the workload and cost to implement the prototype filter. We show how cascade multiple-tier PR analysis/synthesis channelizer chains efficiently implement, variable bandwidth digital filters and multi-resolution systems operating on very wideband signals. When an inner tier analysis channelizer is applied to band edge output channels of an outer tier analysis channelizer it decomposes this channel into multiple narrower sub-channels that enable finer resolution increments of the composite filter's bandwidth. This process, initially designed to enable DSP processing of wide-bandwidth signals offers an unexpected pleasant benefit: a ten-to-one saving in computational workload.\n\nFred Harris Professor Fred Harris\n\nholds the Signal Processing Chair of the Communication Systems and Signal\n\nProcessing Institute at San Diego State University.

This new paradigm will rather naturally\n\nlead to new and more sophisticated network topologies. For instance, in the IoT\n\nage, two or more nodes are interested in exchanging packets among themselves,\n\ni.e., some nodes may act both as a source and a destination simultaneously. In\n\naddition to this, some nodes may act as relays that support the transmission\n\nfrom the sources to the destinations. Thus, cooperation between sources and\n\nrelays is a key feature that can be exploited in such scenarios. As a\n\nconsequence there is an increasing need for the understanding of the\n\nfundamental characteristics of multi-way networks and of cooperation.\n\nThis tutorial will span both theoretical foundations and practical\n\nissues of the main aspects and functionalities of such future IoT networks.\n\nAbout the Presenters\n\nAydin Sezgin received the Dipl.-Ing. (MS) degree in communications engineering\n\nand the Dr.-Ing. (PhD) degree in electrical engineering from the TFH Berlin in\n\n2000 and the TU Berlin, in 2005, respectively. He is currently a professor at\n\nthe Department of EEIT at Ruhr-Universitaet Bochum, Germany. He is interested\n\nin signal processing, communication and information theory with focus on\n\nwireless networks.\n\nAnas Chaaban received his Maitrise-es-Sciences degree in electronics and his MS\n\ndegree in communications technology from the Lebanese University in 2006 and\n\nfrom the University of Ulm (Germany) in 2009, respectively. He received his PhD\n\nin electrical engineering and information technology from the Ruhr-University\n\nof Bochum, Germany, in 2013. He is currently a post-doc at the institute of\n\ndigital communication systems in the Ruhr-University of Bochum. His research\n\ninterests are in the area of network information theory with main focus on\n\nrelaying and interference management.\n\nTutorial 2\n\nDigital\n\nSignal Processing for Next Generation Software Defined Radio Receivers and\n\nTransmitters\n\nPresenters: Fred Harris, Cubic Signal Processing Chair, San Diego State\n\nUniversity, USA\n\nDate: Monday,\n\nFebruary 16, 2015, 13:00-16:00\n\nAbstract: There is an old maxim: \"If we keep on doing things the same way,\n\nwe will keep on getting the same results.\" This is very true in the design and\n\nimplementation of the next generation of DSP-based radios. Radios today are\n\nvery different from the radios of yesteryear. Today we do things in a receiver\n\nor transmitter we wouldn't or couldn't dream of in a previous generation. What\n\nis so different about them? One obvious difference is the pervasive use of DSP\n\nto perform many of the waveform processing tasks formerly accomplished with\n\nanalog components. These tasks include the traditional chores of modulation, of\n\nspectral shaping, of noise bandwidth control, of spectral translation, and of\n\nequalization. We are also using DSP to perform non-traditional tasks such as\n\nDSP-based timing and carrier recovery, I-Q balancing, DC-canceling, bit\n\nre-quantization, variable bandwidth filtering, arbitrary resampling,\n\npre-distortion and pre-equalization.\n\nThis tutorial will review the basic functions required of\n\nmodulators and demodulators in transmitters and receivers. We will explore the\n\nevolution of processing techniques as these functions migrated from early\n\narchitectures implemented by standard DSP techniques requiring synchronous\n\nsampling of the signal wave shape and external (analog) spectral translation\n\nthrough fourth generation architectures that operate asynchronously performing\n\ntiming recovery, spectral translation and bandwidth reduction by applications\n\nof multirate filters and algorithms.\n\nAbout the Presenter\n\nProfessor Fred Harris holds the Signal Processing Chair of the\n\nCommunication Systems and Signal Processing Institute at San Diego State\n\nUniversity. He holds 24 patents and lectures throughout the world on DSP\n\napplications. He consults for organizations requiring high- performance, cost-effective\n\nDSP solutions.\n\nHe has written over 240 journal\n\nand conference papers. He is the author of the textbook Multirate Signal\n\nProcessing for Communication Systems and has contributed to a number of\n\nother DSP and communication textbooks.\n\nDr. Harris became a Fellow of the\n\nIEEE in 2003, cited for contributions of DSP to communications systems. In\n\n2006, he received the Software Defined Radio Forum's Industry Achievement\n\nAward."
