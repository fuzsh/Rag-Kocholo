Billions of smart devices from different vendors, working together on the Internet and exchange information closely related to us, opens up new potentials for hackers.\n\nTo keep IoT devices secure, it is important to maintain an up-to-date understanding of their vulnerabilities. This is difficult for both vendors and end users as there are many technologies being used in IoT devices, such as OS, web servers, wireless communication, data storage, authentication to name a few. Threat intelligence in one way provides the technical data such as malicious IP addresses and malware identifier for IoT infrastructure security, it also enforces better transparency between vendors and end users, ultimately lead to higher standards. In this presentation, we explore threat intelligence for IoT security and its benefits to both vendors and end users.\n\nJason Cooper, DarkMatter Group’s Cryptographic Research & Development Division\n\nJason Cooper is the Principal Systems Architect at DarkMatter Group’s Cryptographic Research & Development Division.

He is predominantly focused on the security posture of “Infrastructure” code upon which we all rely. A majority of Jason’s work involves embedded, constrained systems: securing them, and maintaining strong cryptographic state throughout their life cycle.\n\nPresentation: Enforcing Dynamic Trust: Mimicking the Natural World\n\nHuman instinct guides each of us. Do I know this person? Does someone I trust vouch for them? Should I continue to trust someone who betrayed me? These trust models arise naturally and change over time in response to stimuli. Our trust takes on different levels over a variety of contexts. I might trust an app with my work emails, but I don’t necessarily trust it with photos of my family. We trust an online store with our banking details, until it gets hacked. We’d like to still do business with them, but without entrusting our bank information to them.\n\nThe world of machines is similar. The sensors, actuators, interfaces and servers that make up a system today are configured with static trust relationships. When the server gets hacked, our systems need to adapt to the changed behavior and alter trust on the fly. The systems we design and build must be a dynamic ecosystem tolerant of failures and changing environment. Compromise of one or a few components shouldn’t lead to catastrophic failure of the system.\n\nThe process of creating resilient systems evolves its own tools and techniques. In the development of Darkmatter’s DMLedger SDK, we’ve formulated many of our own. Crypto-algorithm Agility, Off-chain Asynchronous Authentication and Transaction Expiration are just a few. We’ll also discuss (and, time permitting, demo) open-source tools for stress-testing and fuzzing your code, as well as how to integrate such open-ended tests into your regression test cycle.\n\nDrew Van Duren​, OnBoard Security, Inc.\n\nDrew Van Duren is Technical Director of IoT Security at OnBoard Security, Inc., a cybersecurity company dedicated to the safe and secure deployment of transportation systems, advanced cryptography and hardware-enhanced trusted computing.

IoT is contributing to a massive proliferation of a variety of types of software-reliant, connected devices throughout critical infrastructure sectors. With IoT increasingly dependent upon third-party software of unknown provenance and pedigree, software composition analysis and other forms of testing are needed to determine ‘fitness for use’ and trustworthiness. Application vulnerability management should leverage automated means for detecting weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and exploits. Addressing supply chain dependencies enables enterprises to harden their attack surface by: comprehensively identifying exploit targets; understanding how assets are attacked, and providing more responsive mitigations. Security automation tools and services, and testing and certification programs now provide means upon which organizations can use to reduce risk exposures attributable to exploitable software in IoT devices.\n\nThomas P. Keenan, University of Calgary\n\nTHOMAS P. KEENAN is a popular professor at the University of Calgary as well as a best-selling author and frequent media commentator.

He combines a deep technical background (having worked as mainframe systems programmer in the 1970s) with a keen awareness of the social and privacy implications of building and implementing new technologies. He is a Fellow of the Canadian Information Processing Society, and a Research Fellow of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. His 2014 book, Technocreep: The Surrender of Privacy and the Capitalization of Intimacy, investigated some of the increasingly creepy ways data is being collected and monetized. He believes that IoT applications along with biological manipulations like Crispr/Cas9 will soon bring entirely new privacy and security challenges.\n\nPresentation: AVOIDING THE CREEP FACTOR IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS\n\nIf we could design the Internet again, from scratch, we’d do lots of things differently. There is a real risk that, in the race to bring products to market, IoT devices and applications will drag us into some very creepy uncharted waters. We’ve already seen IP cameras and baby monitors conscripted to form a botnet (the 2016 Dyn hack) and data leakage from an Internet connected sex toy (We-Vibe) resulted in a successful class action claim. Starting from a framework developed by the author for the 2014 best-seller Technocreep, we’ll explore some of the ways in which IoT devices can be creepy. We’ll also look at techniques, from data minimization to blockchain logging that can be used to ensure that the right data, and only the right data, goes to the right people.\n\nSoon Chia Lim, Cyber Security Agency\n\nMr. Soon Chia Lim is the Director (Technology) of Cyber Security Agency.

Modern vehicles are significantly different from conventional vehicles which are well-contained in an isolated network environment. As more communication technologies are deployed in vehicles to provide new applications, more external interfaces, such as DSRC (dedicated short-range communications), Bluetooth, 3/4G and OBD (on-board diagnostics) interfaces, expose vehicles in publicly accessible networks. As a result, there are multiple potential ways for attackers remotely getting access into vehicles to take control over them. Designing and deploying security mechanisms for connected vehicles is important for not only security but also safety reasons. This talk introduces the attack surface of connected vehicles and mitigation.\n\nUlf Lindqvist, SRI International\n\nUlf Lindqvist, is a program director in the Computer Science Laboratory at SRI International.

However, the more data we share and devices connected, the greater the risk of theft and manipulation. This has recently been shown by the early rollout of insufficiently secured first-generation IoT devices. The subsequent attacks and negative headlines could have been prevented by using adequate security design.\n\nTherefore, this talk raises the awareness of future IoT system designers and device manufacturers for the following fact: The success of smart homes, connected cars and smart factories hinges on user confidence in robust, easy-to-use, fail-safe security capabilities. Furthermore, solution providers need to envision a lifecycle management of IoT devices, including secured commissioning, re-configuration and updates. To address these challenges, this talk proposes the integration and proper use of hardware-based security in future IoT devices. To finally increase and combine IoT system security and usability, proper IoT application design is necessary. Therefore, this presentation discusses useful approaches derived from state of the art research and findings of our ongoing feasibility studies.\n\nJorge Guajardo Merchan, Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center North America\n\nDr. Jorge Guajardo Merchan is a principal scientist and the manager of the security and privacy group at the Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center in Pittsburgh, USA.

The IoT is envisioned as the enabling technology for smart cities, power grids, health care, and control systems for critical installments and public infrastructure. This diversity, increased control and interaction of devices, and the fact that IoT systems use public networks to transfer large amounts of data make them a prime target for cyber attacks. In addition, IoT devices are usually small, low cost and have limited resources. Therefore, any protocol designed for IoT systems should not only be secure but also efficient in terms of usage of chip area, energy, storage, and processing. This presentation will start by highlighting the unique security requirements of IoT devices and the inadequacy of existing security protocols and techniques of the Internet in the context to IoT systems. Next, we will focus on security solutions for the IoT, with special focus on protection against physical and side channel attacks. In particular, we will focus on mutual authentication protocols for IoT devices based on security primitives that exploit hardware level characteristics of IoT devices.\n\nSean Smith, Dartmouth College and Dartmouth’s Institute for Security, Technology and Society\n\nSean W. Smith is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth College and is the Director of Dartmouth’s Institute for Security, Technology and Society. He has been working in real-world information security—attacks and defenses, for industry and government—since before there was a Web. At IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, he designed the security architecture for (and helped code and test) the IBM 4758 secure coprocessor, and then led the formal modeling and verification work that earned it the world’s first FIPS 140-1 Level 4 security validation. His recent book “The Internet of Risky Things” (O’Reilly, 2017) explores the IoT security space.\n\nPresentation: Securing the IoT: Critical Research Challenges\n\nIn the current Internet of Computers (IoC), paradigms and techniques have emerged to manage security risks, at least somewhat. However, the Internet of Things is different from the IoC, and these differences cause many of these paradigms to stop working. With the deep embedding of the IoT in the physical world, the consequences may have significant physical impact.\n\nThis talk surveys some areas—zero days, authentication, lifetime mismatches, and connectivity complexity—where we need new research driven by academic and industrial partnerships. Vulnerabilities seem to be inevitable in software; in the IoT, how do we reduce and manage the risk of zero days? How do we manage good software hygiene when physical devices can outlive the “use-safely-by” date of software, and maybe even the software vendors themselves? (How do we keep zero-days from turning into forever-days?) As communication channels become more open, how do we secure them—and how do we establish a key infrastructure that captures operational requirements?\n\nAngelos Stavrou, George Mason University and Center for Assurance Research and Engineering (CARE) at GMU\n\nDr. Angelos Stavrou is a Professor at George Mason University and the Director of the Center for Assurance Research and Engineering (CARE) at GMU.

How does all of these function as a system when using commercially available components that can be purchased from anywhere and at a low cost, and with little or no component pedigree available? To provide some practical answers to the these questions, we purchased components and created a set of small use cases to see how it all interoperated.\n\nIn this talk, we will focus on use cases where the application of cryptography is not done properly or the cryptographic libraries employed exhibit security flaws. To that end, we demonstrate the need for mechanisms that will allow low-resource sensors to authenticate and exchange data in a way that does not rely on heavy cryptographic operations. We believe the need for group authentication and message integrity can be adequately satisfied using modified blockchain protocols that rely on proof-of-storage for some of the sensor operations creating groups of networked sensors that prove their membership not only using key material but also historical transactional data. Our work shows how blockchain protocols can be applied in IoT systems in a meaningful manner solving an actual need without the burden of complex operations that usually accompany the blockchain concept.\n\nVrizlynn Thing, Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)\n\nDr. Vrizlynn Thing leads the Cyber Security Cluster, which comprises the Data Security Department, the Network Security Department, and the Systems Security Department at the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR).

In this work, five core primitives belonging to most distributed systems are presented. These primitives form the basic building blocks for a Network of ‘Things’ (NoT) [NIST SP 800-183], including the Internet of Things (IoT). System primitives allow formalisms, reasoning, simulations, and reliability and security risk-tradeoffs to be formulated and argued. These primitives apply well to systems with large amounts of data, scalability concerns, heterogeneity concerns, temporal concerns, and elements of unknown pedigree with possible nefarious intent. The talk ends by suggesting 25 trust issues, that involve everything from 3rd party certification of 3rd party black-box services and products, to defective ‘things’, and to deliberate intentions to slow the flow of data in a IoT-based system.\n\nHaojie Zhuang, Cloud Security Alliance\n\nHaojie is Director of Research at the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) APAC, where his portfolio includes delivering initiatives from CSA Working Groups, CSA Corporate Members, SDO’s, governments, and other strategic partners.
