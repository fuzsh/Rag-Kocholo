        "text": "The Tsukada Laboratory will exhibit the latest research outcomes from the “Internet of Realities” project at Interop Tokyo 2024, held from June 12 to 14. This year’s exhibition will feature advanced augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, specifically showcasing vision AI co-processing with the Magic Leap 2 headset. This system streams camera data to an edge co-processor for AI model execution, such as object detection and pose estimation, and reprojects the results into the user’s 3D environment. Leveraging advancements in lightweight, untethered spatial computing hardware, this approach aims to enhance real-time computer vision capabilities in mixed-reality environments. Our booth is located at stand number 4B25. There is oneRead more\n\nWe are pleased to report on our participation in the 35th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IEEE IV 2024), held at Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, from June 2-5, 2024.

Addressing these challenges requires a delicate balance between optimizing for efficiency and maintaining high-performance computation, which is where dedicated hardware shines. With the emergence of co-processing solutions, highly integrated platforms for autonomous driving tasks that make effective use of limited computational resources are slowly but surely becoming reality. RockPi 5B & Hailo-8 Coprocessor In response these considerations, Tsukada laboratory has begun to explore the deployment of Hailo-8 AI coprocessors in conjunction with ARM-based RK3588 single board computers (SBCs) for AI vision offloading. The overall platform leveragesRead more\n\nFrom December 14th to 15th, 2023, at the National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, Yuze Jiang, an M2 student from our laboratory, was awarded the Best Paper Award (Silver) at the ACM International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications (ICEA 2023), despite it being his first participation in an international conference. The award-winning paper proposed a method of using LiDAR-equipped roadside units and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication to accurately estimate the position of connected vehicles and assist them when their self-localization is insufficient. The results of the simulation indicated that this method surpasses the traditional Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) scan matching-based approach in termsRead more\n\nThe “NTU-UTokyo Joint Conference 2023” was held on December 7th and 8th, 2023, at the National Taiwan University (NTU) campus in Taipei. This year’s conference theme was “Towards a Sustainable Future: Challenges and Resilience,” and it brought together a total of 300 professors from both the University of Tokyo and NTU.
