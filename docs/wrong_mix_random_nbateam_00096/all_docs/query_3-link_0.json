These systems need to elaborate increasingly amount of\n\ndata while featuring low-power operation, area efficiency, and ability to interact with the external\n\nworld in real time. Memristive technology, with its unique characteristics and capabilities, holds great\n\npromise for the design of such cognitive systems. The potential for energy-efficient and parallel\n\ncomputing, combined with the ability to integrate complex neural and synaptic dynamics within a\n\nsingle device, provides avenues for high-performance hardware implementations. Moreover, by\n\noffering volatile and non-volatile memory in a small footprint, enabling dense integration, and\n\nfacilitating in-memory computing, memristive technology presents advantages that, if correctly\n\ncombined with CMOS technology, can extend the functionality of current artificial intelligent systems.\n\nIn this talk, we discuss the challenges and the opportunities to realise memristive neuromorphic\n\ncomputing by developing novel hardware architectures and learning algorithms specifically tailored\n\nto best exploit the intrinsic properties of memristive technology. Indeed, we show that memristive\n\ntechnology offers vast potential, but its effective utilization relies on the synergetic development of\n\nmemristive devices, circuits, and algorithms to create performing hardware cognitive systems.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Erika Covi is Assistant Professor at the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials and the\n\nGroningen Cognitive Systems and Materials Centre, University of Groningen (the Netherlands).\n\nShe received her PhD in Microelectronics in 2014 from the University of Pavia (Italy), where she\n\nworked on designing integrated systems for the characterisation of memristive devices.

Our work addresses the challenge of effectively balancing the competing objectives of operational safety, volume optimization, and minimizing resource usage. A vanilla agent trained from scratch on these multiple criteria fails to solve the problem due to its inherent complexities. This problem is particularly difficult due to the environment's extremely delayed rewards with long time horizons and class (or action) imbalance, with important actions being infrequent in the optimal policy. This forces the agent to anticipate long-term action consequences and prioritize rare but rewarding behaviours, creating a non-trivial reinforcement learning task. Our five-stage CL approach tackles these challenges by gradually increasing the complexity of the environmental dynamics during policy transfer while simultaneously refining the reward mechanism. This iterative and adaptable process enables the agent to learn a desired optimal policy. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves inference-time safety, achieving near-zero safety violations in addition to enhancing waste sorting plant efficiency.\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn sequential decision-making problems, identifying a subset of alternatives\n\nthat guarantee the best outcome is challenging, especially when there is a\n\nstructural dependency among the rewards associated with each action. Besides\n\nthe individual action's reward, it is necessary to learn the causal\n\nrelationships to improve the decision-making strategy. To solve this two-fold\n\nlearning problem, we have developed the 'combinatorial semi-bandit framework\n\nwith causally related rewards'. In this framework, we model the causal\n\nrelationships among actions as a directed graph in a stationary structural\n\nequation model. To achieve this objective, we propose a policy that learns the\n\nnetwork's topology to determine the causal relationships and simultaneously\n\nuses this knowledge to optimize the decision-making process.\n\nIn this talk, I start with a brief explanation of sequential decision-making.\n\nAfter that, I describe our framework, explain its applications, and present\n\nour solution together with the results of the analysis. I conclude the talk by\n\ndiscussing the extensions of our framework into non-stationary settings and\n\ndelayed feedback.\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Laurenz Wiskott\n\nAbstract:\n\nMemories are typically studied only at encoding and retrieval. However, their life between these two bookends is essential, as it determines whether memories will be forgotten, remembered, or become disruptive and intrusive. In this presentation, I will share the findings of a multi-year project in which we applied a formal model of memory to infer and describe the trajectory of memories before they are accessed. The central parameter of the model, which determines the speed of forgetting, is remarkably stable within individuals and can be decoded by analyzing features of their resting-state brain activity. Moreover, the model can be successfully applied to clinical populations, successfully identifying individuals with amnestic cognitive impairment and accounting for changes in the hippocampus size in individuals suffering from PTSD.\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting:\n\nhttps://ruhr-uni-bochum.zoom.us/j/64423067014?pwd=VXA3MncxY3pyTURXLzNrcEtZSm9kZz09\n\nMeeting ID: 644 2306 7014\n\nPasscode: 246479\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Laurenz Wiskott\n\nAs DeepMind has revolutionized the AI side of planning in combinatorially large problems, our lack of understanding of how humans plan in such situations has come into stark focus. The cognitive science of chess, once promising, is now virtually extinct. Planning tasks widely used in the field nowadays don‚Äôt require much thinking ahead. I will show that it is possible to study human multi-step planning in tasks of intermediate complexity while maintaining experimental tractability and computational modelability. I will describe a series of experiments on a game that we call four-in-a-row -- a variant of tic-tac-toe or Go Moku (‰∫îÂ≠êÊ£ã). Inspired by best-first search, we built a heuristic computational model of human play in this game and fitted it to move-level data. The model predicts moves in unseen positions, decisions in unseen tasks, eye fixation patterns, mouse movements, and response times. Moreover, the model allows us to computationally characterize the effects of expertise and time pressure. Linking back to the chess literature, I will discuss how experts differ from novices in remembering game positions and move sequences. Finally, I will describe parallel results from a very large online data set, a project on the development of planning, and ongoing projects on the neural basis of multi-step planning.\n\nThis Colloquium will take place on Zoom.\n\nLink: https://ruhr-uni-bochum.zoom.us/j/68859099254?pwd=Ukgxc0gzZDB5MFhsQkJob2VveEVjUT09\n\nMeeting ID: 688 5909 9254\n\nPasscode: 057211\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Sen Cheng\n\nAbstract:\n\nFlexibly storing and updating memory content is a fundamental ability of animals in which prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to play a major role as its activity can reflect information that must be temporarily maintained to realize the current goal. However, in our flexible spatial working memory task, where rats were required to navigate from different starting points and via multiple routes to one of multiple possible goal locations, we found no evidence that the well-controlled delay period contained current-goal-specific memory. This suggests that under conditions where memory needs to be employed flexibly, alternative storage mechanisms exist, or other brain areas serve to store this information. PFC activity instead categorized important spatial locations according to their meaning in the task and displayed neural representations that reflected the geometry of the maze. Furthermore, we found that elapsed time was encoded at starts and goals and that this time code was invariant to different start and goal locations. Despite the tendency of individual neurons to show mixed selectivity, i.e. to be selective for multiple task-relevant variables, we found that subsets of neurons had functional preferences for time or space. This structured selectivity may facilitate complex behaviors by efficiently generating informative representations of multiple variables.\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Robert Schmidt\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe activity of a population of cells encodes instantaneous sensory, cognitive, and motor aspects of animal behavior. On the other hand, rules governing the behavior are likely encoded in the communication between cells/circuits. Addressing brain interactions is, however, hampered by recurrent connectivity (loops) and common inputs. For example, recurrent circuits reverberate previous activity states causing long-term correlations that undermine any mathematical scrutiny of underlying interactions. To quantify communication principles regardless of spurious correlations, I have developed a theoretical and experimental approach for estimating an \"impact function\" between populations of neurons. To realize this approach, I temporally fuse ultra-fast optogenetic suppression and simultaneous large-scale extracellular recordings in awake animals. In this presentation, I will describe the foundations of the approach followed by results from cell-type specific recurrent circuits in the primary visual cortex of the mouse\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Dirk Jancke\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe ability of the brain to represent the external world in real-time is impacted by the fact that neural processing takes time. Because neural delays accumulate as information progresses through the visual system, representations encoded at each hierarchical level are based upon input that is progressively outdated with respect to the external world. This is particularly relevant to the task of localizing a moving object ‚Äì because the object‚Äôs location changes with time, neural representations of its location potentially lag behind its true location. It has therefore been proposed that the visual system utilizes the predictive nature of motion to extrapolate moving objects along their trajectory. Burkitt and Hogendoorn (2021, https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2017-20.2021) showed how spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can achieve motion extrapolation in a two-layer, feedforward network of velocity-tuned neurons, by shifting the receptive-fields of second-layer neurons in the opposite direction to a moving stimulus.\n\nThe current study extends this work by implementing two changes to the network to bring it more into line with biology: expansion of the network to multiple higher layers to better reflect the depth of the visual hierarchy, and introduction of the time constants associated with biological neural processing. We examine the degree to which STDP can facilitate compensation of neural delays across six layers, showing that the relative contribution of the highest layers increases at higher velocities. We also explore the effect of additional delays imposed on the network by the integration time of the membrane potential.\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Dirk Jancke\n\nNowadays more and more data of moving entities such as cars, animals, and people is being collected. These data can be analysed for example to detect movement patterns, similarity, or type of movement. I will discuss geometric algorithms for doing so, in particular for computing similarity and segmentation.\n\nProf. Maike Buchin is our colleague in the Faculty of Computer Science at RUB. Her colloquium is part of a series of talks aimed at getting to know each other within our new Faculty\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Gregor Sch√∂ner\n\nThe cell assembly hypothesis postulates that neurons coordinate their activity through the formation and repetitive co-activation of groups. We assume that assembly activity is expressed by the occurrence of precisely timed spatio-temporal patterns (STPs) of spikes emitted by neurons that are members of the assembly. We developed a method that is capable to detect significant STPs in massively parallel spike trains (SPADE, Torre et al, 2016; Stella et al, 2019). SPADE identifies and counts repeating patterns using Frequent Itemset Mining. Then the detected patterns are evaluated for their significance through comparison to patterns found in surrogate data that contain the same changing firing rates of the neurons. Various surrogate techniques can be used to evaluate significance, and their correct choice is crucial to ensure that by-chance patterns are not classified as significant (Stella et al, under revision). Using SPADE we evaluated parallel spike data recorded (by a 100 electrode Utah array) in pre-/motor cortex of monkeys performing a reach- to-grasp task (Riehle et al, 2013). We indeed find significant STPs specific to behavioral context. Typically STPs are formed by 3-6 neurons, and have a maximal temporal extend of 60ms. Neurons involved in STPs are not clustered on the cortex, but may be far apart (up to 3.6mm). Often we find neurons that are involved in multiple STPs. Currently, we explore if a network model based on synfire chains (SFCs) is capable of explaining the patterns we find in experimental data.\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Sen Cheng\n\nCognition is the result of computations over representations in the brain to yield behavior. But what are the parts of the brain that perform those computations, and how do they relate to cognition? In this talk, I will outline two different views on those parts and their relationship to thought. The Sherringtonian view describes networks of neurons that individually perform computations for cognition. On this view, the representations are the spikes sent between neurons and the computations are the ways that individual neurons transform those signals. In contrast to the Sherringtonian's emphasis on single neurons and similar biophysical details, the Hopfieldian view describes dynamical objects like state spaces, manifolds, and trajectories for cognition. On this view, the representations are attractors in neural state spaces and the computations are the trajectories through or transitions between them. I will illustrate both views, discuss their relationship to levels of explanation and levels of analysis, and argue that the Hopfieldian view has greater promise for explaining the most challenging aspects of cognition.\n\nHosted by Eloy Parra Barrero, M.Sc.\n\nSoftware engineering is at an inflection point. The traditional and largely manual construction of software is challenged by novel trends and technologies -- including rapidly changing markets, artificial intelligence or continuous delivery (e.g., in-field updates of cars). Developers need to frequently experiment with new ideas and quickly customize software for different markets, environments or hardware platforms, while optimizing for non-functional properties, such as security, performance or energy consumption.\n\nIn this talk, I will present my group‚Äôs contributions towards automating the engineering of software systems. I will discuss how we combine foundational and applied research, often in collaboration with industry, to advance the scientific and engineering principles of software engineering. My focus will be on two application domains: variant-rich systems and robotics control systems.\n\nThorsten Berger is a Professor in Computer Science at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. His research focuses on automating software engineering for the next generation of intelligent, autonomous, and variant-rich software systems -- exploring new ways of software creation, analysis, and evolution.

We address this problem with a fully automatic close-to-life image-to-image translation technique for traffic sign substitution in natural images. The work is intended\n\nas data augmentation technique and allows for training rare or unavailable traffic sign classes, or otherwise uncommon cases in visual traffic sign detection and classification. To this end, we extend our previous data generation model and propose a rendering pipeline to create convincing traffic sign images with realistic background and camera recording artifacts.\n\nExperiments are conducted by exchanging traffic sign classes on different parts of the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). We demonstrate that the pipeline\n\nis well-suited for generating representative images of unseen traffic sign classes. A baseline image classification setup trained on real data shows an overall performance similar to being trained with a comparable number of artificial data samples.\n\nThis hands-on tutorial will give you a chance to try out concepts of neural dynamics in our software CEDAR.\n\nWe will host the tutorial in the robotics lab (NB 02/77).

As a result, most of humans can readily manipulate or learn quickly how to manipulate external objects and environments without a firm grip or without re-grasping for re-orientating or moving. Here one can think of grasping and moving a wet soap when cleaning hands, of controlled rolling basketball ball on a palm in throwing it to the goal, think of manipulating knife in cutting soft materials etc. We can learn how to handle various objects or media for the purpose even them can slide or roll being in contact.\n\nThe talk is focused on challenging problems in modern robotics with emphasis of the discussion shifted to model-based approaches for developing some of human-like functionalities for robots. The intentions are examined by developing a solution for performing a rolling of passive objects (disc) on a robotic hand. Necessary mathematical concepts and arguments for the task are presented. Importance, relevance and scalability of the reasoning are supported by successful experimental studies on the robot.\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Gregor Sch√∂ner\n\nThe cognitivist approach to cognition that emerged in the mid-1950's exploited the newly invented computer as a literal metaphor for cognitive functions and operation, using symbolic information processing as its core model for cognition. In spite of the later appearance of the so-called \"emergent\" approaches such as connectionism and embodied dynamicism, the main tenet of cognitivism, namely that features of the environment are represented by internal states within a cognitive agent, is still deeply entrenched in our mindset. Such pervasive \"representationism\" forces us to interpret the neural data in a certain way. For example, any correlation between internal (e.g. neural activity) and external (e.g. features of the environment) states are automatically interpreted as a \"code\". In this talk, I will try to use simple metaphors to stir the debate on the issue of representation.\n\nProf. Dr. Katharina Henke & Dr. Simon Ruch (University Bern) will give two talks in a joint Colloquium of the INI and of the SFB 874.\n\nTitles: Conscious versus unconscious memory for episodes (K.Henke) & Implicit relational vocabulary encoding during sleep is bound to slow-wave peaks (S. Ruch)\n\nTime: Monday, July 16th, 4-6pm\n\nVenue: NB 3/57\n\nHost: Sen Cheng\n\nAbstracts:\n\nK. Henke: Conscious versus unconscious memory for episodes\n\nEpisodic memory builds on the rapid encoding of flexible what-where-when associations. When we are aware of our episodic memories, they originate from consciously witnessed events. But episodic memories may also originate from an unconscious processing of subliminal or unattended events. I‚Äôll report experiments on the supraliminal (conscious) and subliminal (unconscious) encoding of movies that put the idea of unconscious episodic encoding to a critical test and that examine the hypothesis of a larger memory capacity for unconscious versus conscious episodic memory. Information load was manipulated in 3 steps with 1, 3 or 9 consecutive movies presented for encoding. Retention of movies was assessed using a two-alternative forced-choice task with accuracy as explicit and reaction time as implicit measure of memory. This task records the retention of relational inferences participants made while watching a movie. Reaction times revealed successful long-term retention of inferences made on both subliminal and supraliminal movies. These results support the notion of an unconscious form of episodic memory. Accuracy caught memory of supraliminal movies alone. Retrieval performance remained robust with high load in the subliminal condition but collapsed in the supraliminal condition both in terms of accuracy and reaction times. We assume that unconscious versus conscious episodic encoding yielded sparse and segregated memory representations with little overlap, which may provide for less interference and a larger capacity. Just as the strength of conscious episodic memories comes with a limited capacity, so the weakness of unconscious episodic memories appears to come with a large capacity. The hippocampus supported both the conscious and unconscious encoding and retrieval of flexible what-where-when associations.\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Sen Cheng\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis talk will cover two different areas of research on decoding non-invasive brain signals: (1) the use of big data neuroimaging and genetics resources for decoding brain disorders, and (2) the use of electroencephalographic recordings to control assistive technology devices by means of a Brain-Computer Interface.\n\nPsychiatric disorders are among the main contributors to morbidity and disability around the world, yet in contrast to other fields of medicine, clinical decision making in psychiatry still today largely relies on symptom descriptions rather than biology. The talk will discuss how novel big data resources of neuroimaging and genetics data may be utilized toward biology-informed precision medicine in psychiatry and how this can lead to an increased understanding of processes underlying brain maturation and dysfunction.\n\nAnother field of research ‚Äì Brain Computer Interfaces ‚Äì attempts to decode electroencephalographic signals from the brain of individuals with severe motor paralysis for controlling assistive technology devices. The talk will describe developments of such systems as an alternative communication channel as well as for wheelchair control.\n\nEach of the fields has progressively advanced over recent years, yet faces numerous challenges still. Can they learn from each other?\n\nTime: Wednesday, June 27th, 12-1pm\n\nVenue: NB 3/57\n\nHosts: Sen Cheng & Johannes Lederer (Fakult√§t f√ºr Mathematik)\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Sen Cheng\n\nIn this talk we analyze video signals and try to maximize micro movements in video signals to make them visible. These micro movement are typically undetectable and can‚Äôt be seen by human being. We utilize several frequency and transform domain tools to maximize difference in frame pixels and try to detect any minor change in frames and try to magnify this difference to yield video signals with movement maximization. This movement maximization is achieved by magnifying some specific frequency bands by a multiplication factor and reconstructing back the video signal after some manipulation and modification to make these micro movements seen and observable. These micro movements can later be utilized in different applications such as Medical Imaging, Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Physical Feature Analysis and Industrial Engineering. In our work we introduce our own model for micro movement magnification and compare it with very recent state of the art work (el. Freeman.) and show the tradeoffs.\n\nHosted by PD Dr. Rolf W√ºrtz\n\nSensory neural circuits are thought to efficiently encode incoming signals. Several mathematical theories of neural coding formalize this notion, but it is unclear how they relate to each other and whether they are even fully consistent. I will present a unified framework, based on the ‚ÄòInformation bottleneck‚Äô, that encompasses and extends previous proposals. With this framework, we can highlight key tradeoffs faced by sensory neurons. For example trading off future prediction versus efficiently encoding past inputs leads to qualitatively different predictions for neural responses to natural visual stimulation. Finally I will discuss how this approach could be used as a first step to theoretically explaining the observed diversity of neural responses. [see http://www.pnas.org/content/115/1/186.long, for related publication]. SFB 874\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Dirk Jancke\n\nAutonomous navigation is very active research area in robotics that is searching for alternative methods to provide intelligent ways to robots navigate in unknown environment, which defines the so called simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Outcomes provided by the neuroscience research indicates that hippocampus play a role in individuals‚Äô space navigation when sequences of movements episodes of an individual can be used to construct a map of an unknown environment, which at the end provides a good source of inspiration to design SLAM solutions (here called Biomorphic SLAM). On the other side, neuroscience can profit from biologically plausible robotic solutions to test the hypothesis about how the biological structures really work. Therefore, this loop interleaving robotics and neuroscience advancements benefits both fields of knowledge. From the robotics‚Äô perspective, the gain in using the Biomorphic SLAM becomes even more valuable when multi-robots systems are the target. Nowadays, Cloud-Robotics Systems are the state of the art in multi-robots systems, demanding solutions for a number of problems, in which the cooperative SLAM (C-SLAM) is a highlight. In C-SLAM, all robots perform SLAM in the same environment, but each of them just manages to cover a small portion of that environment. The goal of a C-SLAM solution is to provide a merge of their partial maps so that the system a whole manages to build a complete map. This talk discusses the application of the Biomorphic SLAM approach in the C-SLAM problem in the scope of Cloud-Robotics Systems. In this context, the state of the collaborative work between UFRGS and RUB will be presented.\n\nHosted by Prof. Dr. Sen Cheng"
