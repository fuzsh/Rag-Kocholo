We discuss a number of new perspectives on hypergraph analysis and visualization, at the intersection of topological data analysis, optimal transport, and data visualization. First, we discuss recent efforts in hypergraph simplification, using topological and optimization techniques. Second, we develop theoretical foundations for studying the space of hypergraphs using ingredients from optimal transport. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our framework through various examples.\n\nBio:\n\nDr. Bei Wang Phillips is an Associate Professor in the School of Computing and a faculty member in the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, University of Utah.

These user interfaces incorporate the visual presentation of information, virtual controls for the applications, and physical devices to enhance users' abilities to build a mental model that blends the physical world and the virtual world created for them. This is a very difficult problem to solve. Many smart scientists have investigated this problem for decades. This talk will investigate this research from the point of view of where we came from, where we are at the current moment, and possible future directions we could go. Part of this journey is a discussion of why this is a difficult problem. AR/VR/XR user interfaces are more difficult to design than traditional 2D desktops and handheld devices. While this user interfaces research is challenging, it is quite rewarding.\n\nBio:\n\nProfessor Thomas is currently Emeritus Professor at the University of South Australia.

Many academics ask themselves this question during the qualification phase.\n\nHow can I stay in academia?\n\nWhat are the requirements for academic careers (in Germany)?\n\nThe workshop supports participants in developing their individual qualification profile and creating a list of criteria from their personal values, preferences and skills that outlines their professional vision. Based on the qualification profile and list of criteria, you will define steps on the way to your next professional station. The identity as a professional scientist (and other professional roles) is also shaped by origin- and gender-specific expectations - this is also a topic of the seminar in order to enable the participants to strengthen their individual career-related self-efficacy.\n\nThe seminar is intended as an aid to consciously planning a career in science in particular, but also provides suggestions for the way out and for a \"Plan B\".\n\nThe aim of the workshop is not to provide a patent remedy for \"successful careers\", but to support the participants' individual career planning. In addition to imparting knowledge, there is above all room for reflection and systematically guided development of ideas and their gradual, concrete implementation.\n\nBio:\n\n- Coach, mediator, PhD in biology\n\n- Studied biology and several semesters of economics in Marburg an der Lahn\n\n- Diploma in biology\n\n- PhD in biology at Freie Universität, Berlin\n\n- 10 years conducting various research projects, teaching, co-ordinating projects and fostering junior staff\n\n- Work and research in various universities and research institutes in Germany, France, Croatia, Scotland and the Czech Republic.\n\n- Attendance of training courses for coaching, mediation, intercultural competence, diversity management, systemic organisational development\n\n- Freelance consultant for staff at universities and research institutes since 2011\n\n- Member of the Coaching Network for Science (Board Member 2017-2024), active involvement in the professional association Gender Diversity and the Federal Association for Mediation as well as in the ProFiL-Netzwerkverein (Professionalisation of women in research and teaching)\n\nRegistration:\n\nPlease register via email to elisabeth.hutter@uni-konstanz.de\n\nLocation:\n\nThe talk will be available via Zoom.

Time, as a unique dimension, possesses a rich semantic structure that goes beyond a simple linear sequence. This presentation highlights the need to appropriately model this structure to capture the irregularities and cyclic patterns inherent in time. Understanding these intricacies is crucial for the accurate visualization for time-oriented data. Examples will be given for why and how these characteristics matter. The presentation further explores currently pursued research topics such as visualization literacy, audio-visual analytics, situated visualization, and knowledge-assisted visual analytics.\n\nBio:\n\nWolfgang Aigner is a professor at the Institute of Creative\\Media/Technologies at the St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, Austria where he is responsible for the research area \"Data Visualization\" and currently, he holds a visiting professorship at the University of Bari Aldo Moro, Italy. He is also an adjunct professor at TU Wien, Austria where he received his habilitation in computer science for his work on \"Interactive Visualization and Data Analysis: Visual Analytics with a Focus on Time\" in 2013. Dr. Aigner is an expert in Information Visualization (InfoVis) and Visual Analytics (VA), particularly in the context of time-oriented data. He has authored and co-authored more than 150 peer-reviewed scientific publications and is an author of the book \"Visualization of Time-Oriented Data\" (Springer, 2011 and 2023) that is devoted to a systematic view of this topic.\n\nLocation:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, Room 00.012\n\nThe talk will be available via Webex.\n\nWebex Link\n\nMeeting-Kennnummer (Zugriffscode): 2733 820 8353\n\nMeeting-Passwort: 5BqZf4mr7WS\n\nJun 8th, 2024, 1 pm to 7 pm\n\nVisualization Research Center, University of Stuttgart\n\nParticipation in 'Tag der Wissenschaft' - 'Science Day'\n\nThe University of Stuttgart's Science Day takes place on June 8, 2024. At the Visualization Research Center (Allmandring 19, 70569 Stuttgart), the SFB-TRR 161 will give insights into the world of visualization research. Visitors are invited to discover how visualizations can help to extract the relevant information from data and how they make visible what would otherwise remain hidden.\n\nmore\n\nJun 3rd - 4th, 2024, full days\n\nTagungszentrum Blaubeuren\n\nInternal Status Seminar of the SFB-TRR 161\n\nSchedule:\n\nMonday, Jun 3rd, 2024\n\n09:30 Registration\n\n10:00 Opening\n\n10:15 SIG Dimension Reduction\n\n10:30 SIG Machine Learning\n\n10:45 SIG Uncertainty\n\n11:00 Ö\n\n11:15 Coffee Break\n\n11:45 Poster Session I\n\n12:45 Lunch\n\n14:15 Poster Session II\n\n15:15 Coffee Break\n\n15:30 Member Assembly / Doctoral Assembly\n\n18:00 Dinner Barbecue\n\nTuesday, Jun 4th, 2024\n\n09:00 Invited Talk by Martin Baumann\n\n10:00 Coffee Break\n\n10:30 Equal Opportunity and Diversity Measures\n\n10:45 Collaboration Meeting I\n\n12:30 Lunch\n\n13:30 Plenary Discussion\n\n15:00 Coffee Break\n\n15:15 Collaboration Meeting II\n\n16:15 Departure\n\nDownload Schedule\n\nInvited Talk | Psychological Challenges for Human-Technology Interaction\n\nHeld by Martin Baumann, University of Ulm\n\nAbstract:\n\nTechnological progress in recent decades has led to the development of human-machine systems in which the machine part is increasingly able to make decisions independently and also carry out the corresponding actions autonomously. The machine thus became an at least partially autonomous agent in this human-machine systems. While such systems are supposed to provide enormous potential to increase safety, efficiency and comfort, this potential can only be fully exploited if the human users use these systems in an appropriate manner. For this they must sufficiently understand these systems, which means that humans are able to predict the technical agents’ future behaviour and develop an appropriate level of trust in them. However, this can only be achieved if these systems not only act reliably but also possess the ability to act as a cooperative partner to the humans. Besides others, this requires that these system are able to support the generation of a shared situation representation with the human users and to support the development of a trust level that reflects the system capabilities.\n\nIn this talk, some results of recent research projects on different aspects of cooperative human-machine interaction are shown and their possible implications for the design of cooperative automation are shortly discussed.\n\nBio:\n\nMartin Baumann received his PhD in 2001 from Chemnitz University of Technology. He continued as assistant professor in Chemnitz until 2007. After finishing a post-doc project at the German Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) he joined the German Aerospace Center 2007 where he led the teams \"Driver Cognition and Modeling\" and \"System ergonomics and interaction design\" until 2014 when he got appointed as professor for Human Factors at Ulm University.. His main research interests are the cognitive processes underlying human behaviour in human-machine systems, such as the comprehension and anticipation of events in dynamic situations, attention allocation and multi-tasking, trust formation and calibration in human-machine interaction. The main application domains of his research are human-automated vehicle interaction, human-robot interaction and human-AI interaction. The goal is to develop and evaluate strategies for cooperative human-machine interaction based on psychological theories of human information processing.\n\nMay 6th, 2024, 4 pm\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, Visualization Research Center\n\nTalk | The Value of Overviews\n\nHeld by:\n\nRobert S. Laramee, University of Nottingham\n\nAbstract:\n\nI was reviewing a draft of a research paper written by a PhD candidate and I provided the following feedback, \"This paper would benefit greatly from an overview,\" referring to the method section. His reply was, \"I don't see the value of that.\" I was shocked by this response. \"How could he not see the value of an overview?\" I thought to myself. The PhD candidate's rebellious response ignited a train of thought that continues to this day. In this talk we will discuss the value of overviews offering the perspective that overviews are in fact a Holy Grail for visualization. We attempt to reason on this subject and gather evidence based on both observation and experience. We hope that the result inspires further discussion, new perspectives, and implications for visualization for the audience.\n\nBio:\n\nRobert S. Laramee received a bachelors degree in physics, cum laude, from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (ZooMass). He received a masters degree in computer science from the University of New Hampshire, Durham. He was awarded a PhD from the Vienna University of Technology (Gruess Gott), Austria at the Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms in 2005. From 2001 to 2006 he was a researcher at the VRVis Research Center and a software engineer at AVL in the department of Advanced Simulation Technologies. He was a Lecturer, then Associate Professor at Swansea University (Prifysgol Cymru Abertawe), Wales in the Department of Computer Science (Adran Gwyddor Cyfrifiadur). Currently he is a Professor at the University of Nottingham, UK in the School of Computer Science. His research interests are in the areas of scientific visualization, information visualization, and visual analytics. He has published around 200 peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals and conferences.\n\nLocation:\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart, Room 00.012\n\nThe talk will be available via Webex.\n\nWebex Link: https://unistuttgart.webex.com/unistuttgart/j.php?MTID=m43ffa7622293dd101b162187c0bb3224\n\nMeeting-ID (Zugriffscode): 2790 520 8544\n\nMeeting Password: ERtJYgKC624\n\nMay 2nd, 2024, 9.30 am - 4 pm\n\nUniversity of Konstanz, ZT1204 (Data Theatre)\n\nWorkshop | Graph Drawing - Theory and Applications\n\nHeld by:\n\nFranz Brandenburg, University of Passau\n\nGiuseppe Liotta, University of Perugia, IT\n\nUlrik Brandes, ETH Zurich, CH\n\nSchedule:\n\n09:30 Morning Coffee\n\n10:00 Keynote I, Franz Brandenburg: Book Embeddings of Planar, 1-Planar and Fan-Planar Graphs\n\n10:45 Presentation I, Niklas Gröne: CelticGraph: Drawing Graphs as Celtic Knots and Links\n\n11:15 Coffee break\n\n11:30 Keynote II, Ulrik Brandes: Proximity Networks and Football Teams’ Spatial Expressions\n\n12:15 Presentation II, Stefan Feyer: 2D, 2.5D, or 3D?

It is known that every planar graph has a 4-page book embedding and this bound is tight. We generalize Yannakakis algorithm for a 5-page book embedding of planar graphs to 1-planar, fan-planar graphs and k-framed multigraphs and improve the known bounds. A graph is 1-planar if each edge can be crossed at most once, fan-planar if an edge can only be crossed by adjacent edges, and a k-framed multigraph if it consists of a planar multigraph with faces of degree at most k that contain crossed edges.\n\nBio:\n\nProf. (Emeritus) Dr. Franz J. Brandenburg studied Mathematics and Informatics at the University of Bonn where he obtained his Ph.D. and Habilitation. In 1983 he took over the chair of Theoretical Computer Science at the University of Passau, which he held until his retirement in 2015. He had over 20 Ph.D students, two of them are professors in Computer Science today. He has contributed to various scientific fields, such as formal languages, complexity theory, graph grammars, graph drawing, and combinatorics. His primary focus remains in the field of graph drawing, where he continues to be actively engaged.\n\nKeynote II Ulrik Brandes: Proximity Networks and Football Teams’ Spatial Expressions\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe propose a class of proximity graphs for the instantaneous representation of spatial arrangements in association football (soccer). They are inspired by related applications in fingerprinting and facial expression detection, and intended to serve as a fundamental data structure with which various downstream tasks can be tackled flexibly, explainably, and in real time. As example use cases, we introduce position plots to capture the characteristic fluidity of player positions during a game and track corresponding changes in team formations.\n\nAcknowledgments: Hadi Sotudeh, Dogan Parlak, Paolo Laffranchi, Mert Erkul, and Sammy Jäger.\n\nBio:\n\nUlrik Brandes is professor for social networks at ETH Zürich. He is co-editor of Social Networks and recipient of the 2024 Simmel Award, the distinguished career award of the International Networks for Social Network Analysis (INSNA). His work revolves around method development for network analysis and visualization, and is increasingly utilizting the game of football as a model system.\n\nKeynote III Giuseppe Liotta: The Bend-Minimization Problem in Orthogonal Graph Drawing\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn the field of Graph Drawing, a classic and well-studied problem is computing orthogonal drawings of planar graphs with the minimum number of bends. This problem has been approached in two ways:\n\n- Fixed embedding setting: The input specifies a particular planar embedding of the graph, and the algorithm must find an orthogonal drawing that minimizes bends while respecting this embedding.\n\n- Variable embedding setting: The algorithm has the freedom to choose among all possible planar embeddings of the graph, aiming to find an embedding that allows for an orthogonal drawing with the minimum number of bends.\n\nIn this talk, I will provide a brief overview of the most important findings for both approaches and discuss some key directions for future research.\n\nBio:\n\nGiuseppe Liotta is a professor of computer science at the Department of Engineering of the University of Perugia, Italy. His research interests are mainly directed at the analysis and design of algorithms and systems that have applications in the fields of network science, information visualization, and graph drawing.

The variety of applications stretches from advanced scientific data visualization in life sciences to personal data visualization on mobile devices. The past decade has seen a growing research interest and demonstrated benefits in visualization environments beyond traditional desktop computers, often involving multimodal human-computer interaction. Immersive Analytics, an approach for spatial data analysis with (mostly) mixed reality technologies, is a particularly interesting research direction that is receiving a lot of attention and allowing unprecedented ways of diving into the data.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss such novel visualization environments, among them multi-device ensembles involving large visualization walls, (multiple) mobile devices, as well as immersive environments utilizing mixed reality technologies. Based on a discussion of several research examples of the Interactive Media Lab Dresden, we will introduce natural and appropriate ways of exploring data in such future environments. The talk will also outline important challenges associated with these research directions.\n\nBiography:\n\nRaimund Dachselt is a full professor of Computer Science and head of the Interactive Media Lab at Technische Universität Dresden, one of Germany’s Universities of Excellence. His research interests encompass natural human computer interaction (HCI), interactive information visualization, and Mixed Reality interaction. He worked extensively in the area of interactive surfaces from smartwatches over tablets and tabletops to wall-sized displays (also combined in multi-display environments) and combined interaction modalities (e.g., multi-touch and pen, tangible displays, gaze-supported interaction, body gestures). He and his team made pioneering contributions to the field of interactive data visualization beyond the desktop including solutions for mobile devices, ultra-large displays, multi-device environments, Augmented Reality, and other Immersive Analytics approaches. Contributions in the area of physical computing have recently extended the technology spectrum beyond commonly available devices.\n\nProf. Dachselt received his PhD in 2004 from TU Dresden and was professor for User Interface & Software Engineering at University of Magdeburg from 2007 to 2012.

Within the regular activities of the SFB TRR 161 DR SIG, several ideas related to DRs emerged and were discussed. They include proposing novel uncertainty-aware DRs, utilizing existing DRs, and developing DR visual analytics frameworks for quantifying and assessing image quality and making sense of eye-tracking (ET) data. The DR SIG then invited and worked with domain experts (from ET SIG, VISUS) and collaborators to write up several proposals related to the ideas, rooting the foundation for this DR for the ET data Hackathon.\n\nAround 20 participants expressed their interest and elected four out of the original six proposals for the Hackathon. The participants are researchers from groups revolving around SFB TRR 161 Project Leaders.\n\nWithin 48 hours, the participants will hack and build software solutions for the four proposals, which will be the foundations for potential future high-quality publications within SFB TRR 161 FP3.\n\nLocation:\n\nARENA2036, Pfaffenwaldring 19, 70569 Stuttgart\n\nDec 4th, 2023, 4 pm New date: Jan 29th, 2024, 4 pm\n\nUniversity of Stuttgart\n\nLecture | Attractive Guidance in Dynamic Visualizations\n\nHeld by:\n\nManuela Waldner, Institute of Visual Computing & Human-Centered Technology at TU Wien, Austria\n\nAbstract:\n\n3D animations are an effective method to learn about complex dynamic phenomena, such as mesoscale biological processes. The animators’ goals are to convey a sense of the scene’s overall complexity while, at the same time, visually guiding the user through a story of subsequent events embedded in the chaotic environment. In this talk, I will present and discuss two visual emphasis methods that solely manipulate dynamic scene parameters. The first method generates flicker to attract the attention to a focus element of the story. Since flicker can be highly disturbing, we conducted a series of experiments to find a trade-off between guidance effectiveness and subjective annoyance. The second method smooths the motion of contextual scene elements to attract the observers' attention to focus elements of the story exhibiting high-frequency motion. Our experiment showed that this approach can also be effective, but has an impact on the perceived speed of the animation.\n\nBiography:\n\nManuela Waldner is an assistant professor (tenure track) at the Institute of Visual Computing & Human-Centered Technology at TU Wien, Austria. She has a PhD in computer science from Graz University of Technology, Austria. Her main research interests cover scalable and interactive data analysis and visualization with the primary goal to make complex data and models better understandable for users.

At this, human abilities as well as users' needs and tasks are central issues to assist in situations where complex decisions need to be made. A mixed-initiative process is an approach where both humans/users and systems can “take the initiative” and both contribute to the process. Such a mixed-initiative process could be utilized for enhanced problem-solving and comprehensive understanding.\n\nIn this talk, I will illustrate the concepts of guidance-enriched and knowledge-assisted Visual Analytics seen as a mixed-initiative process. I will address three key questions: “what” is visualized, “why” is it visualized, and “how” it is visualized. Various examples (taken from health care/medicine, cultural heritage, art history, and financial sectors) will exemplify what has been achieved so far and show possible future directions and challenges. Data and information are a broad field – I will focus particularly on the temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal dimensions as well as networks and uncertainty.\n\nBiography:\n\nSilvia Miksch is a university professor and head of the research unit \"Visual Analytics\" (CVAST) at the Institute of Visual Computing and Human-Centered Technology, TU Wien, since 2015.

While immersive visualizations are usually implemented in VR, situated visualizations are grounded in the real world and, therefore, implemented in AR. With a mobile AR display, the user is freed from having to bring the data to the workplace and, instead, may go where the data belongs.\n\nFor situated visualization, referents are key. By extension, the same is true for situated analytics, i.e., analytic work supported by situated visualization. Situated analytics near referents is particularly relevant if referents actively provide data, such as via Internet of Things. Despite its promise to grant access to just the right data, anytime and anywhere, few works explore situated analytics for lengthy or complex tasks, such as visualization authoring or data exploration. In contrast to immersive analytics, which successfully capitalizes on providing unlimited virtual “space to think”, it appears that the benefits of situated analytics are harder to manifest.\n\nBiography:\n\nsee Workshop | Situated Analytics\n\nPlatform and Registration:\n\nThe talk is part of the Workshop | Situated Analytics that takes place in person at the University of Konstanz.\n\nYou can join in to the talk via Zoom.

This approach can provide evidence about basic sensory processes and assess the performance of an observer interacting with technological devices. Such methods can also help establish quantitative criteria for evaluating and designing novel technology.\n\nThe results of a psychophysical experiment are typically analyzed by fitting a psychometric function to each observer and then performing a second-level model for inferential statistics. Yet recent studies have shown that modelling data at the population level by means of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) also has many advantages, specifically in terms of a better estimation of goodness of fit and of a higher statistical power.\n\nIn this workshop, we will demonstrate the use of the open-source statistical software R for processing and analyzing typical psychophysical data, using popular R libraries such as Tidyverse and Lme4 together with our package MixedPsy.\n\nBiographies:\n\nAlessandro Moscatelli, M.D., Ph.D., is tenure track researcher (RTDb) at the Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome ‘Tor Vergata’ and junior group leader at the Department of Neuromotor Physiology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS, Rome, Italy.

However, robustly detecting shifts of attention during everyday mobile interactions is challenging. Encouraged by recent advances in automatic eye contact detection, we present a method to accurately and robustly detect eye contact in images captured with the front-facing camera of common mobile devices. Based on our evaluations, we show how eye contact is the fundamental building block for calculating higher-level attention metrics and, as such, enables studying visual attention in the wild. We then present the Everyday Mobile Visual Attention (EMVA) dataset and quantitative evaluations of visual attention of mobile device users in-situ, i.e. while they use their devices during their everyday routine. Using our proposed method for eye contact detection, we quantify the highly dynamic nature of everyday visual attention allocation across users, mobile applications, and usage contexts. Finally, we discuss our findings that highlight the potential and inform the design of future mobile attentive user interfaces.\n\nBiography:\n\nMihai Bâce is a post-doctoral researcher in the Perceptual User Interfaces group at the University of Stuttgart.

Given a data set, however, there are often too many possible visualization techniques, with each technique having many parameters to be tuned. Here, the question arises is if it is possible to automatically design a visualization that is best suited to pursue a given task on given input data. With my lab, we attempt to quantitatively model human perception of different visualization types and developed a number of automated visualization techniques to achieve this goal for different data sets such as time-series, bivariate, high-dimensional, and set data.\n\nBiography:\n\nYunhai Wang is a Professor at Shandong University, China. He leads the Interactive Data Exploration System (IDEAS) Lab at Shandong University with the mission to enhance people's ability for understanding and communicating data. His current research interests include perceptual and mathematical foundations of visualization, domain specific languages for authoring interactive data visualization and data structures for big data visualization. He has published more than 50 papers in top venues for visualization and computer graphics, such as IEEE VIS, IEEE TVCG, ACM SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH Asia, ACM TOG and ACM CHI. He has collaborated with many international researchers especially with professors from Konstanz and Stuttgart. He is the main organizer of the yearly Sino-German Visualization Workshop (2017-2019 – stopped by Covid-19).\n\n-\n\nTuesday, Jun 22nd, 2021, 9 am - 9.10 am\n\nResearch Presentation: XRgonomics: Facilitating the Creation of Ergonomic 3D Interfaces\n\nHeld by: Dr. Tiare Feuchtner, TU Wien and Aarhus University\n\nBiography:\n\nTiare Feuchtner will soon be joining the HCI group at the University of Konstanz as Junior Professor, where she will lead the new Multimodal Cross Reality Lab.

Many of the roadblocks related to performance and usability are now resolved. The commoditization of these technologies makes it interesting to consider them not only for entertainment, but also for visualization and analytics work. New research on immersive analytics considers how the infinite virtual space can benefit not only the visualization of spatial data, but also of abstract data. New research on situated analytics considers how immersive interfaces can be physically grounded and blended with a user's perception of the real world. This talk will give an overview of recent developments in immersive and situated analytics and describe results of an ongoing research collaboration between the speaker's team in Graz and the University of Stuttgart.\n\nBiography:\n\nDieter Schmalstieg is full professor and head of the Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision at Graz University of Technology, Austria. His current research interests are augmented reality, virtual reality, computer graphics, visualization and human-computer interaction. He received Dipl.-Ing. (1993), Dr. techn.

This is in stark contrast to the richness of how humans interact with the physical world. In my work, I study and build the interfaces for the next generation of computing systems by considering the humans' full physiology potential while respecting social and ergonomic constraints. I show how to go from simple interaction to hand- and body-aware interactions.\n\nBiography:\n\nSven Mayer is an assistant professor for HCI at the LMU Munich. In his research, he uses machine learning tools to design, build, and evaluate future human-centered interfaces. He focuses on hand- and body-aware interactions in contexts, such as large displays, augmented and virtual reality, and mobile scenarios.\n\nPlatform and Registration:\n\nThis is an online event only.

The just-noticeable-difference (JND) methodology has been proposed to measure subjective experience of the human visual system in recent years. In this talk, I will try to give a brief review on JND-based subjective quality measurement, objective quality assessment metrics, and applications to perceptual coding. Then, I will present our recent work that applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to develop objective quality metrics. To be specific, we have developed a Full-Reference metric that uses 2D convolutional layers to extract spatial features and Convolutional Neural Network with 3D kernels (C3D) to learn spatiotemporal features. C3DVQA combines feature learning and score pooling into one spatiotemporal feature learning process. What's more, I would share an on-going work that aims to develop a No-Reference IQA metric. It adopts a coarse-to-fine multi-task learning strategy to reconstruct objective error maps in two subtasks optimized with different loss functions. The network is designed to be nested such that discriminative features learned from subtasks are efficiently shared by the primary task. Experimental results are given to show the performance of the proposed methods.\n\nBiography:\n\nHaiqiang Wang received his Ph.D. degree in 2018 from the University of Southern California. From 2018 to 2019, he was a Sr. researcher at Tencent Inc., Shenzhen, China. He is currently a research assistant professor at Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China. His research interests include deep learning, image/video processing, as well as quality assessment.

I will first introduce low-dimensional semantic vector space models (VSMs) which dominate the task within the current evaluation framework. Then, I will distinguish between type- and token-based VSMs and discuss possible reasons for the apparent dominance of the simpler type-based models. I will show that token-based models can be tuned to reach similar performance as type-based models, while losing much of their expressiveness. Both model types then yield reasonable performance on current data sets. However, I will argue that this performance cannot be fully trusted, as these data sets are strongly biased towards polysemy. I will end by giving an outlook towards a formulation of semantic change detection as supervised learning task, which I consider to be the most promising direction of future research.\n\nBiography:\n\nI’m a last-year PhD student at the IMS (University of Stuttgart) working together with Sabine Schulte im Walde on automatic detection of lexical semantic change. I hold a Bachelor degree in Linguistics and English and a Master degree in Computational Linguistics. My interest is focused on the application of machine learning methods to solve problems involving the semantics of words.\n\nPlatform and Registration:\n\nThis is an online event only.

Emulating such ability has been studied for more than 80 years by neuroscientists and by computer vision researchers, while in the last few years, thanks to the large spread of deep learning, saliency prediction models have achieved considerable improvement. The first part of the talk will provide an overview of saliency prediction architectures and show the results on the most important benchmarks for the task. The use of multi-level features and recurrent attentive mechanisms will be discussed and their effectiveness in emulating human eye fixation mechanisms will be demonstrated. The last part of the talk will be focused on the application of saliency information to improve other computer vision problems, such as image captioning.\n\nBiography:\n\nMarcella Cornia received the M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering and the Ph.D. degree in Information and Communication Technologies from the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in 2016 and 2020, respectively. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. She works under the supervision of Prof. Rita Cucchiara on Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

However, in all of these cases, the underlying finding about brain function took many years to first consolidate and many more to transfer to AI. Moreover, all of these findings were made using invasive methods in non-human species. For many cognitive functions that are uniquely human, such as natural language processing, there is no suitable model organism and a mechanistic understanding is that much farther away.\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss two works that circumvent these limitations by establishing a direct connection between the brain and AI systems with two main goals: 1) to enable transfer of brain insight to AI and 2) to provide computational models that can be used to improve our mechanistic understanding of cognitive functions in the brain. Lastly, I will discuss future directions that build on these approaches to investigate the role of memory in meaning composition, both in the brain and in AI systems. My hope is that this investigation will lead to methods that can be applied to a wide range of AI domains, such as computer vision, multi-modal learning, and other areas in which it is important to adapt to new data distributions, continually learn to perform new tasks, and learn from few samples.\n\nBiography:\n\nMariya Toneva is a last-year PhD candidate in a joint program between Machine Learning and Neural Computation at Carnegie Mellon University, where she is advised by Tom Mitchell and Leila Wehbe. Her primary research is on building computational models of meaning composition during language processing in the brain that can both better predict neuroimaging recordings of people reading naturalistic text and improve on natural language processing systems.\n\nPlatform and Registration:\n\nThis is an online event only.

But the analysis of such data can be quite challenging as soon as classical experimental restrictions of interaction are removed. For many natural human-computer interactions, eye- and hand-movements are elemental.\n\nThe analyses of such data are challenging because we need statistical control for many continuous confounders, and we need deconvolution methods due to temporal overlap of brain potentials between gaze-fixations. To overcome these challenges, we recently introduced an integrated workflow based on encoding models and time-regression.\n\nThe visualizations of such encoding models are complex, mainly because the encoding model results reside in high-dimensional space (sensors x timepoints x subjects x predictors). This makes selection or discretization of the space necessary. In addition, the brain activity is non-stationary over time, complicating averaging over timepoints and subjects show high variability to each other, complicating averaging on the group level. Further, the experimental predictors are often not orthogonal but can potentially interact in surprising ways (e.g. suppressor effects, mediation).\n\nIn this talk I will give an introduction to the topic, intuit the logic of the analyses and discuss some problems in visualization.\n\nBiography:\n\n2018 - PhD in Cognitive Science, Osnabrück, Germany\n\n2018-2020: PostDoc in PredictiveBrainLab with Floris deLange at Donders Institute, Nijmegen, Netherlands\n\n2020: Tenure-Track Professor Computational Cognitive Science\n\nPlatform and Registration:\n\nThis is an online event only.

Most notably Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) allow the synthesis of visual data that can already now be indistinguishable to real visual data from a human observer point of view. While this opens up new applications, this has several serious consequences on trust in visual data and can even be used to manipulate public opinions. Hence, we seek understanding in which ways such technology can be used beyond the intended use case in order to inform the model creators about potential dual use scenario. Furthermore, we investigate possibilities to detect such deep fakes. Unfortunately, this often leads to an arms race which does not allow for a sustainable detection of such fake images. Therefore, our most recent research investigates different watermarking and fingerprinting techniques that support a responsible disclosure of such state of the art models in order to mitigate potential risks they pose.\n\nBiography:\n\nMario Fritz is faculty member at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, professor at the Saarland University, and founding member of the ELLIS unit Saarbruecken. Before, he was senior researcher and research group head at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics, and PostDoc at the International Computer Science Institute and UC Berkeley.

Current research at my department combines educational theory, psychological methodology, and intelligent algorithms to approach this question. Our ultimate goal is to create intelligent educational technologies that can support learning in the best possible way. These systems should recognize the level of learners’ knowledge, skills, and available cognitive resources. In addition, they should be able to encourage learners to stay focused on their tasks when they face distractions. In my talk, I will introduce selected research projects related to learner characteristics and context factors that pave the way to enhanced education.\n\nBiography:\n\nMaria Wirzberger holds the tenure-track assistant professorship „Teaching and learning with intelligent systems“ at the Institute of Educational Science since March 2020. During her interdisciplinary journey, she obtained degrees in Inclusive Education, Psychology and Human Factors in Bochum, Hagen and Berlin. Her PhD in the interdisciplinary Research Training Group \"CrossWorlds\" at Chemnitz University of Technology shed light on cognitive processes and mechanisms related to cognitive load in instructional scenarios. From 2018-2020, she was leading the development of the AI-based attention training ACTrain at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen. She is part of the Cyber Valley ecosystem, member of the associated faculty at the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS) and national affiliate at the LEAD Graduate School and Research Network (University of Tübingen).\n\nPlatform and Registration:\n\nThis is an online event only.

The ways we visualize data directly influence the conclusions we draw and decisions we make; however, our knowledge of how visualization design influences data analysis is largely grounded in heuristics and intuition. My research instead empirically models how people interpret visualized data to understand limitations in current visualization systems. We use these results to develop novel visualization systems that support accurate analysis of complex data and better scale to the needs of modern analytics challenges by incorporating interactive statistical analytics and novel display technologies to increase the accessibility, scalability, and pervasiveness of data-driven reasoning. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts towards improving exploratory data analysis tools across a variety of domains and how a range of modeling techniques can help improve visualization tools.\n\nBiography:\n\nDanielle Albers Szafir is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and a Fellow in the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is also an affiliate professor and member of the founding faculty of the Department of Information Science and Fellow in the Institute of Cognitive Science. Her research, which sits at the intersection of information visualization, data science, and cognitive science, has been integrated into leading tools such as D3 and Tableau, has received best paper awards at IEEE VIS and IS&T Color and Imaging, and led to her inclusion in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Class of 2018 for Science. She received a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Washington as a NASA Space Grant Scholar and a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nPlatform and Registration:\n\nThis is an online event only.

Relative to human observers, these measures are overly sensitive to resampling of texture regions (e.g., replacing one patch of grass with another). Here we develop the first full-reference image quality model with expli"
