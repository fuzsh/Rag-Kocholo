Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew 14%; EPS—excluding charges and credits—increased 62%; and pretax segment operating margin expanded 229 basis points (bps), led by Well Construction and Reservoir Performance. These results reflect the strength of our core services Divisions, the broad-based activity increase, and the continued realization of our improved operating leverage.\n\n“The quarter also marked the tragic start of the conflict in Ukraine, which is of grave concern. Accordingly, we established local and global crisis management teams to respond to the crisis and its effect on employees, business, and our operations. In addition to ensuring that our operations are compliant with developing sanctions, we took the step in the quarter to suspend new investment and technology deployment to our Russia operations. We urge the cessation of hostilities and are hopeful that peace will return to Ukraine and the entire region.\n\nShifting Trends in the Energy Landscape\n\n“Concurrently, a shift in focus is emerging in the energy landscape, exacerbating an already tightly supplied oil and gas market. The dislocation of supply flows from Russia will result in increased global investment across geographies and the entire energy value chain to ensure the diversification and security of the world’s energy supply.\n\n“The confluence of elevated commodity prices, demand-led activity growth, and energy security are resulting in one of the strongest outlooks for the energy services industry in recent times—reinforcing the market fundamentals for a stronger and longer multiyear upcycle—absent a global economic setback.\n\n“In this context, energy has never been more essential to the world. Schlumberger, which uniquely benefits from increasing E&P activity and digital transformation, provides the most comprehensive technology portfolio to help customers deliver diverse, cleaner, and more affordable energy.\n\nFirst-Quarter Growth Led by Well Construction and Reservoir Performance\n\n“Year-on-year revenue growth by Division was led by Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, our core services Divisions, both of which grew more than 20%—outperforming global rig count growth. Digital & Integration revenue grew 11%, while Production Systems revenue increased 1%. Our core services Divisions experienced double-digit revenue growth in drilling, evaluation, intervention, and stimulation services, both on land and offshore. In Digital & Integration, growth was driven by strong digital sales, increased exploration data license sales, and higher revenue from Asset Performance Solutions (APS) projects. In contrast, Production Systems growth was temporarily hampered by ongoing supply chain and logistics constraints, resulting in lower-than-expected product deliveries. However, we are confident that these constraints will gradually abate, enabling backlog conversion and accelerating revenue growth for Production Systems through the rest of 2022.\n\n“On a geographical basis, revenue growth compared to the same quarter last year was broad-based, with international revenue increasing 10% and North America growing 32%. International growth was widespread across all areas, led by Latin America, due to higher drilling in Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil. Europe/CIS/Africa grew primarily from higher Production Systems sales in Turkey and increased exploration drilling in offshore Africa—particularly in Angola, Namibia, Gabon, and Kenya. These increases, however, were partially offset by revenue decline in Russia & Central Asia. Middle East & Asia revenue increased due to higher drilling, stimulation, and intervention activity in Qatar, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Australia, and across Southeast Asia. In North America, growth was pervasive across drilling and completions activity, coupled with a strong contribution from our APS project in Canada.\n\n“Year-on-year, first-quarter pretax segment operating income margin expanded due to improved operating leverage from higher activity, favorable offshore activity mix, greater technology adoption, and an improving global pricing environment, which continues to evolve favorably in Well Construction and Reservoir Performance. Digital & Integration margin expanded further, while Production Systems margin was impacted by supply chain constraints.\n\n“Sequentially, the quarter’s revenue primarily reflects the typical seasonal activity decline in the Northern Hemisphere, with the decline in Europe/CIS/Africa more pronounced due to the depreciation of the ruble, as well as global supply chain constraints impacting Production Systems. In contrast, North America and Latin America revenue was essentially flat sequentially. By Division, Well Construction revenue was slightly higher than last quarter as strong drilling activity in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East more than offset the seasonal reductions in Europe/CIS/Africa and Asia. Reservoir Performance, Production Systems, and Digital & Integration were sequentially lower due to seasonal reductions in activity and sales.\n\n“First-quarter cash from operations was $131 million, including a first-quarter build-up of working capital above the usual level, ahead of the anticipated growth for the year. We expect free cash flow generation to accelerate throughout the year, consistent with our historical trend and still expect double-digit free cash flow margin on a full-year basis.\n\n“Moving forward, the outlook for the rest of the year—particularly in the second half—is shaping up very well with both short- and long-cycle investments accelerating. Notably, a number of FIDs for long-cycle development projects have been approved, new contracts were awarded, offshore exploration drilling is resuming, and several customers have announced a significant step-up in their spending plans for this year and over the next few years.\n\n“Consequently, it is our view that increased activity—both on land and offshore—higher technology adoption, and pricing momentum will drive simultaneous growth internationally and in North America. This will result in a sequential seasonal rebound in the second quarter followed by significant growth in the second half of the year, particularly in the international market.\n\n“With this backdrop and despite the uncertainty linked to Russia, we believe the current market dynamics should allow us to maintain our full-year ambitions of year-on-year revenue growth in the mid-teens and adjusted EBITDA margins exiting the year at least 200 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Our positive outlook extends further into 2023 and beyond as we anticipate successive years of market growth. As demand continues to strengthen and new investments are committed to diversify energy supply, the duration and scale of this upcycle may potentially prove higher than originally anticipated, absent a setback in the economic recovery.\n\n“Based on these strengthening fundamentals, we made the decision to initiate incremental return to shareholders with a 40% dividend increase. The trajectory of our cashflows affords us the flexibility to accelerate our return of capital program while continuing to deleverage the balance sheet and invest for long-term success.\n\n“At this pivotal moment in energy for the world, Schlumberger is well positioned. Our advantaged market position, technology leadership, and execution differentiation are aligned for significant returns potential throughout the cycle.”\n\nOther Events\n\nOn April 21, 2022, Schlumberger’s Board of Directors approved a 40% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.125 per share of outstanding common stock to $0.175 per share, beginning with the dividend payable on July 14, 2022, to stockholders of record on June 1, 2022.\n\nFirst-Quarter Revenue by Geographical Area\n\n(Stated in millions) Three Months Ended Change Mar. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Mar. 31, 2021 Sequential Year-on-year North America $1,282 $1,281 $972 - 32% Latin America 1,204 1,204 1,038 - 16% Europe/CIS/Africa 1,404 1,587 1,256 -12% 12% Middle East & Asia 2,024 2,107 1,917 -4% 6% Eliminations & other 48 46 40 n/m n/m $5,962 $6,225 $5,223 -4% 14% International $4,632 $4,898 $4,211 -5% 10% North America $1,282 $1,281 $972 - 32% n/m = not meaningful\n\nNorth America\n\nNorth America revenue of $1.3 billion was essentially flat sequentially, as growth on land was offset by seasonally lower sales of exploration data licenses and production systems in the US Gulf of Mexico. Land revenue was driven by the ramp-up of drilling in US land and increased APS revenue in Canada.\n\nCompared to the same quarter last year, North America revenue grew 32%. Growth was extensive across drilling and completions activity, coupled with a strong contribution from our APS project in Canada.\n\nInternational\n\nRevenue in Latin America of $1.2 billion was flat sequentially, as higher APS revenue in Ecuador and increased drilling activity in Mexico was offset by lower revenue in Guyana, Brazil, and Argentina due to reduced drilling, intervention, and completions activity as well as lower sales of production systems. Increased APS revenue in Ecuador was driven by the resumption of production following the pipeline disruptions in the previous quarter.\n\nYear-on-year, revenue grew 16% due to higher drilling activity in Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil.\n\nEurope/CIS/Africa revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 12% sequentially due to the seasonal activity reduction that impacted all Divisions and the depreciation of the ruble. The revenue decline was partially offset by higher revenue in Europe, particularly in Turkey, due to increased sales of production systems.\n\nYear-on-year, revenue grew 12%, primarily from higher sales of production systems in Turkey and higher exploration drilling in offshore Africa, particularly in Angola, Namibia, Gabon, and Kenya. These increases, however, were partially offset by the revenue decline in the Russia & Central Asia region.\n\nRevenue in the Middle East & Asia of $2.0 billion decreased 4% sequentially due to seasonally lower activity in China, Southeast Asia, and Australia, coupled with reduced sales of production systems in Saudi Arabia. This decline was partially offset by robust drilling activity in the rest of the Middle East, particularly in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nYear-on-year, revenue increased 6% due to higher drilling, stimulation, and intervention activity on new projects in Qatar, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and across Southeast Asia and Australia.\n\nFirst-Quarter Results by Division\n\nDigital & Integration\n\n(Stated in millions) Three Months Ended Change Mar. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Mar. 31, 2021 Sequential Year-on-year Revenue International $631 $624 $610 1% 3% North America 225 263 161 -14% 40% Other 1 2 1 n/m n/m $857 $889 $772 -4% 11% Pretax operating income $292 $335 $247 -13% 18% Pretax operating margin 34.0% 37.7% 32.0% -372 bps 201 bps\n\nn/m = not meaningful\n\nDigital & Integration revenue of $857 million decreased 4% sequentially due to seasonally lower sales of digital and exploration data licenses, primarily in North America and Europe/CIS/Africa, following the usual year-end sales.

Revenue was also impacted by the depreciation of the ruble. The decline was partially offset by strong activity in North America and in the Middle East.\n\nYear-on-year, double-digit revenue growth was broad across all regions, except for Russia & Central Asia. Double-digit growth was posted in evaluation, intervention, and stimulation services both on land and offshore, with more exploration-related activity during the quarter.\n\nReservoir Performance pretax operating margin of 13% contracted 232 bps sequentially due to reduced profitability from seasonally lower evaluation and stimulation activity, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere—partially offset by improved profitability in North America.\n\nYear-on-year, pretax operating margin expanded 299 bps with profitability improving in evaluation and intervention activity across all regions, except for Russia & Central Asia.\n\nWell Construction\n\n(Stated in millions) Three Months Ended Change Mar. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Mar. 31, 2021 Sequential Year-on-year Revenue International $1,865 $1,901 $1,577 -2% 18% North America 485 441 310 10% 56% Other 48 46 49 n/m n/m $2,398 $2,388 $1,936 - 24% Pretax operating income $388 $368 $210 5% 85% Pretax operating margin 16.2% 15.4% 10.8% 77 bps 534 bps\n\nn/m = not meaningful\n\nWell Construction revenue of $2.4 billion was slightly higher sequentially driven by increased integrated drilling activity and drilling fluids revenue, partially offset by reduced measurements and drilling equipment sales. Strong drilling activity in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East was partially offset by seasonal reductions in Europe/CIS/Africa and Asia, as well as the effects of the depreciation of the ruble.\n\nYear-on-year, double-digit revenue growth was across all regions, except for Russia & Central Asia. Double-digit growth was recorded in drilling fluids, measurements, and in integrated drilling activity—both on land and offshore.\n\nWell Construction pretax operating margin of 16% expanded 77 bps sequentially due to improved profitability in integrated drilling, impacting all areas, particularly in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East. This was partially offset by reduced margins in the Northern Hemisphere and Asia due to seasonality.\n\nYear-on-year, pretax operating margin expanded 534 bps with profitability improving in integrated drilling, equipment sales, and measurements services across most regions.\n\nProduction Systems\n\n(Stated in millions) Three Months Ended Change Mar. 31, 2022 Dec. 31, 2021 Mar. 31, 2021 Sequential Year-on-year Revenue International $1,127 $1,278 $1,161 -12% -3% North America 473 484 420 -2% 13% Other 4 3 9 n/m n/m $1,604 $1,765 $1,590 -9% 1% Pretax operating income $114 $159 $138 -28% -18% Pretax operating margin 7.1% 9.0% 8.7% -192 bps -159 bps\n\nn/m = not meaningful\n\nProduction Systems revenue of $1.6 billion declined 9% sequentially due to lower sales of well production systems across all areas and reduced revenue from subsea projects. Revenue was temporarily impacted by supply chain and logistics constraints, resulting in lower-than-expected product deliveries.\n\nYear-on-year, double-digit growth in North America and Europe & Africa was driven by new projects in contrast to reductions in Middle East & Asia and Latin America resulting from the end of projects and temporary supply chain constraints. As these constraints gradually abate, enabling backlog conversion, revenue growth for Production Systems will accelerate through the rest of 2022.\n\nProduction Systems pretax operating margin of 7% declined 192 bps sequentially and 159 bps year-on-year. The margin contraction was primarily due to reduced profitability in well production systems driven primarily by the impact of global supply chain and logistics constraints.\n\nQuarterly Highlights\n\nInvestment in oil and gas production continues to grow as Schlumberger customers invest to provide reliable energy to meet increasing and evolving demand.

Upon completion of the integration, ConocoPhillips reservoir engineers will have access to cloud-based, high-performance computing resources in the DELFI environment as well as Schlumberger’s reservoir engineering solutions—including the Petrel* E&P software platform's Petrel Reservoir Engineering, INTERSECT* high-resolution reservoir simulator, and ECLIPSE* industry-reference reservoir simulator.\n\nIn Malaysia, PETRONAS has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Schlumberger to jointly explore opportunities in the areas of sustainability, digital, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, as well as research and development projects. Under the MOU, PETRONAS and Schlumberger will create key sustainability initiatives, such as the setup of a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Centre of Excellence—which will comprise CO2 separation technologies, a competency development program, emissions management, and a cloud-based repository for carbon storage data. This collaboration aligns with PETRONAS’ efforts to establish Malaysia as a leading CCS solutions hub in the region. PETRONAS will leverage Schlumberger capabilities to develop reliable, safer, and ready-to-deploy technologies that reduce the carbon footprint in its upstream operations, while developing a capability framework and efficient data management. PETRONAS is taking deliberate steps to build a resilient and sustainable portfolio to support the transition towards low-to-zero carbon energy sources.\n\nSchlumberger expanded its INNOVATION FACTORI network with the opening of a new center in Houston, Texas, the first INNOVATION FACTORI center in North America. Through INNOVATION FACTORI, customers can turn promising concepts into fully-deployed, enterprise-scale AI and digital solutions that extract maximum value from data. Customers benefit from an agile approach by leveraging the DELFI cognitive E&P environment, which seamlessly integrates with Agora* edge AI and IoT solutions. Customers also have access to a powerful machine learning platform with unrivalled AI capabilities through Schlumberger’s partnership with Dataiku. Together with Dataiku, Schlumberger is enabling customers to leverage a single, centralized platform to design, deploy, govern, and manage AI and analytics applications—allowing everyday users to develop ‘low-code no-code’ AI solutions.\n\nIn Libya, Sirte Oil Company (SOC) began digitalizing operations with Agora edge Al and IoT solutions to increase production and electric submersible pump (ESP) reliability. Using secure satellite connectivity and solar power in the remote AI-Khair Field, SOC is now improving production and monitoring the first of multiple wells, with additional deployments slated for 2022. This first-of-a-kind implementation of a predictive ESP performance application in concert with Al-driven video analytics deployed via Agora solutions at the wellsite improves production, enhances site security, and can reduce required wellsite visits by more than 90%. SOC will remotely capture other information from analog gauges on subsequent wells using Al-powered digital vision and Agora solutions.\n\nDuring the quarter, Schlumberger introduced several new technologies and received recognition for industry-advancing innovation. Customers are leveraging our Transition Technologies* and digital solutions to improve operational performance and reduce carbon footprint.\n\nIn the Eagle Ford Shale, Ensign Natural Resources was able to reduce new well capital expenditure and well pad emissions using Vx Spectra* surface multiphase flowmeters. Previously, Ensign was using a three-phase separator for production monitoring on every well. By deploying Vx Spectra flowmeters—which measure without the need to separate components of production—Ensign is now able to use a single test separator per pad and a Vx Spectra flowmeter for real-time monitoring of individual well performance. This reduced capex by decreasing the number of required separators, lowering well pad emissions by 75%.\n\nThe first worldwide 6-in Ora* intelligent wireline formation testing platform implementation was performed in Kuwait in January 2022, with a 3D-focused radial probe on a deep drilling rig at 16,100 ft, enabling the first- ever downhole sampling in the Jurassic tight gas reservoir. KOC’s implementation was a great opportunity to prove Schlumberger technology leadership, and the Ora platform enabled a fourfold increase in sampling efficiency in one of the most complex reservoirs in Kuwait. This operation reduced KOC’s carbon footprint using one of our Transition Technologies, and paves the way for further deployment to realize the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) vision of KOC.\n\nSchlumberger technologies received several honors from the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC), the leading industry event dedicated to advancing scientific and technical knowledge for offshore resources and environmental matters. ReSOLVE iX* intelligent extreme wireline intervention service and Autonomous Directional Drilling have each won an OTC 2022 Spotlight on New Technology® Award, which recognizes companies that are revolutionizing the future of offshore energy through technological advancement and innovation. In addition, ProdOps* tuned production operations solution and the Optiq Seismic* fiber-optic borehole seismic solution each won an OTC Asia 2022 Spotlight on New Technology Award. These technologies are all being deployed by customers to improve operational performance.\n\nThe growth cycle continues to strengthen as customers increasingly invest to find and bring new supply to market. Well construction is a key part of that process, and Schlumberger continues to introduce technologies that not only drive well construction efficiency but provide deeper understanding of reservoirs, empowering customers to create more value. Drilling technology highlights during the quarter:\n\nSchlumberger announced the introduction of the GeoSphere 360* 3D reservoir mapping-while-drilling service, which leverages advanced cloud and digital solutions to deliver real-time 3D profiling of reservoir objects. Using GeoSphere 360 3D service, customers can now place fewer, higher-quality wells with greater certainty and confidence, improving returns from complex reservoirs and reducing the carbon intensity of field development. Unlike conventional technologies, 3D reservoir mapping while drilling identifies fluid bodies and faults—at reservoir scale—which is unique in the industry.\n\nIn the North Sea, Equinor used the new Schlumberger GeoSphere 360 3D service to provide a complete 3D structural understanding of a key section of a well, which led to the delivery of nearly 100 m of extra net pay interval. Subsurface insight from GeoSphere 360 3D service informed Equinor's high-angle well placement that optimized total hydrocarbon recovery. Geosteering support from the top of the reservoir to the main section of the horizontal interval resulted in Equinor electing to extend the well in the reservoir pay zone, improving project economics.\n\nOur industry must advance sustainability in its operations, reducing environmental impact while contributing to the stability of global energy supply. Schlumberger continues to create and apply technology to both reduce emissions from customer operations and support clean energy generation around the world.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company formally launched the Schlumberger End-to-end Emissions Solutions (SEES) business, which offers a comprehensive set of services and cutting-edge technologies designed to give operators a robust and scalable solution for measuring, monitoring, reporting, and—ultimately—eliminating methane and routine flare emissions from their operations. Methane and flare emissions currently account for more than 60% of operators’ direct—or Scope 1 and 2—greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. SEES delivers a holistic approach to enable operators to develop a successful methane emissions elimination strategy. The approach enables customers to plan, measure, and act using the industry’s first methane emissions digital platform, accessible in the DELFI environment, providing a comprehensive and differentiated path for operators to achieve their decarbonization objectives.\n\nIn Germany, Schlumberger performed a successful stimulation on a horizontal geothermal well for the Ruhr Universität Bochum, creating a model for rejuvenating geothermal wells across Germany and beyond, while meeting the highest environmental standards. Previous types of treatments were unsuccessful in this complex, high-temperature reservoir. Kinetix* reservoir-centric stimulation-to-production software was used to plan a treatment delivered with the BroadBand Precision* integrated completion service—including a customized formulation of the ThermaFRAC* shear-tolerant high-temperature fracturing fluid. This solution supported project permitting within the Bavarian Environment Agency, Bayerisches Landesamt für Umwelt (LfU Bayern), and Mining Office South Bavaria (Bergamt Südbayern) through compliance with Germany’s strict environmental requirements. This process can be used to renew productivity of geothermal wells around the world.\n\nVeitur Utilities PLC has made a direct award to Schlumberger for three high-temperature electric submersible REDA* pumps (ESP) for installation in geothermal water wells situated in and around Reykjavik, Iceland. This award is the result of a previous Schlumberger installation in 2020 of a REDA pump to replace a lineshaft pump (LSP) in Veitur’s district heating wells. The Schlumberger ESP can operate in higher temperature environments, increased depths, and higher deviation from vertical than LSPs, which are typical in geothermal applications. The REDA pump produces higher flow rates without the need for additional cooling, reducing energy consumption while meeting increasing demand for heating in the district heating network.\n\nIn New Zealand, Ballance Agri-Nutrients Ltd. has awarded Schlumberger a contract to use the Symmetry* process software platform to create a digital twin of the Kapuni ammonia-urea plant and use custom thermodynamic simulation to increase plant output. The thermodynamics engine of the Symmetry platform, coupled with bespoke urea modeling tools, will enable Ballance to combine this plant with a renewable energy farm that will not only produce green ammonia and urea for agriculture, but will also supply green hydrogen for transportation fuel.\n\nSupplemental Information\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n1) What is the capital investment guidance for the full-year 2022?\n\nCapital investment (comprised of capex, multiclient, and APS investments) for the full-year 2022 is expected to be between $1.9 and $2.0 billion.
