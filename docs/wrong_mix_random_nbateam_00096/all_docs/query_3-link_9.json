It’s easy to become lost in compliance and regulatory requirements soup. There are plenty of respected consultancies that will perform multi-month SOC assessments. A quick Internet search yields several SOC capability maturity models. And yet, a one-hour conversation with a SOC veteran will yield a gut sense of how a SOC is doing on its journey, and where investments are needed. What if SOCs had a lighter weight method that identifies key strengths and weaknesses: one can be done in an afternoon, or more than twice a year? In this talk, Carson Zimmerman will challenge your thinking about how to measure and drive SOC effectiveness. He will present 14 key indicators of performance, that survey not only how the SOC is doing at a given point of time, but also how well growth and improvement are baked into the SOC culture.\n\nTod Beardsley is employed at CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the US government.

Purple teaming, adversary simulation/emulation and automated red teaming are all intended to help defenders to be better prepared. The problem is that these are more initiatives that many of us don’t have the time to undergo with all of the other requirements thrown at us.At the heart of these initiatives is the desire to help organizations build better detections that can handle threats more effectively. Rather than tie ourselves into knots around questions like “is it better to emulate or simulate or run an automated red team”, we need to focus on determining the threats that we need to detect in our environments that align with the actors targeting us.This talk provides attendees with a methodology around testing and validating detections to drive rule development in security operations. Testing cannot take place in a vacuum and should be executed in a representative target environment that includes an organization’s telemetry (EDR/sysmon, NDR/Zeek, for example). We will also examine the role that threat intelligence plays in determining how to prioritize and focus our detection development to the most relevant threats for an organization.This methodology should evolve into an on-going cycle and we will discuss how this ensures rules will continue to function with an added bonus of identifying if data is being ingested and normalized as expected. Finally we will walk through an example that applies this methodology.\n\nMeghan Donohoe is a Security Software Engineer in Cisco’s incident response team.

Everyone has seen colleagues run out of steam from the stress of working one high-priority alert after another, leading many to ask, \"How can we overcome these challenges?\"This is where automation enters the conversation.The process of responding to MFA fraud reports during a live incident is put under the microscope in this comprehensive case study, enabling the audience to see the impact of automation on the incident lifecycle and the investigator's role. Unlike other presentations that solely focus on automating the detection stage, this case study includes multiple phases of incident response.Developers will learn about flexible coding practices and the fast-paced environment of an incident response event. Simultaneously, responders will gain insights into the advantages of automation. Everyone will be inspired to explore and embrace automation as a means to accelerate incident response.\n\nSatoshi Okada received B.E. and M.E. degrees in engineering from The University of Tokyo in 2020, 2022.

We first introduce AI technology and its social positive and negative impacts. For instance, AI technologies can be applied to cyber security areas such as predicting attacker behavior, Red/Blue teaming hands-on, and SOAR approach. Meanwhile, AI decisions and predictions can be subject to bias due to datasets and algorithms.AI is not always able to make fair and responsible decisions, as evidenced by the false arrests caused by AI-based facial recognition technology. Then, we emphasize the need for inclusive and diverse perspectives in AI governance and show the importance of multi-stakeholder approaches in achieving appropriate AI governance. We also highlight the challenges and opportunities in implementing such approaches by introducing best practices and case studies demonstrating successful examples . The session aims to provide attendees with a comprehensive overview of how multi-stakeholder collaboration can enhance AI safety, ethics, and societal benefits.\n\nI am a cyber security enthusiast and leader with a passion to bring a positive change to the information security & privacy landscape.

Showcasing how telecom threat landscape has changed since the introduction of GSM and how the defense needs to evolve accordingly. 20 years ago, targeting of telecom networks required specific skills, as shown in early reports of SS7 attacks. Due to convergence with IT and cloud technologies, threat actors now increasingly utilize the same tools and exploits against telecom as they use for other industries. Emergence of initial access broker market and online criminal communities have impact on telecom threat landscape. Telecom protocols are no longer ‘a mystery’ – one can build an IMSI catcher at home or get access to signaling network for subscriber tracking. Attackers are heavily using mobile spyware for espionage instead of wiretapping the networks so the defenders need to update their arsenal accordingly.\n\nKota Kino is Malware/Forensic Analyst at Incident Response Group, JPCERT/CC.

Cryptocurrency hackers target organizations in various countries, and their activities are revealed by many security vendors. When such hackers are described in detail, they are associated with Lazarus so often that all cryptocurrency hackers seem to be Lazarus. However, cases in which non-Lazarus attackers are involved have also been confirmed. It is problematic that there is insufficient attention to and information of non-Lazarus cryptocurrency hackers while Lazarus gains a lot of attention. This presentation shares recent attacks against cryptocurrency companies by Lazarus and other attackers.Specifically, the following attacks are presented:* Campaign MalDoc in PDF* Campaign CryptoParallax* Campaign JokerSpyThese attacks should be noted to discuss future security measures since they use new attack techniques and malware that had never been observed before. Although the presentation covers attack cases confirmed in Japan, there should have also been similar attacks in other countries since cryptocurrency hackers target organizations in various countries. This presentation helps the participants learn and understand recent attacks targeting cryptocurrency companies and improve their security against similar attacks.\n\nDirector of the National Security Laboratory at LAC.\n\nCISA (Certified Information Systems Auditor).\n\nI joined the Japan Air Self-Defense Force in 1984 and held various commanding positions, including the 23rd Aircraft Control and Warning Group, the Communications and Systems Management Group.

This presentation delves into the challenges posed by the adoption of AI technologies, particularly those leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), and emphasizes the potential risks if security measures are not diligently implemented. Our study aims to dissect and analyze threats, consolidating knowledge from sources like CVE, MITRE ATLAS, published case studies, and vulnerabilities outlined in OWASP that afflict AI systems, especially those employing generative AI.We present a comprehensive method for evaluating AI systems, focusing on identifying the Threat Critical Path (TCP). TCP is a kill chain formed by a set of less visible steps in which adversaries take to achieve their objectives within the ecosystem supporting these technologies. Throughout our research, numerous kill chains were scrutinized, forming a taxonomy of attack types and objectives against AI systems. We explore vulnerabilities from a systemic perspective, including issues with LLM models and plugins connecting internal information sources like documents, databases, and spreadsheets.The significance of our work is underscored by tangible outcomes, including a novel security evaluation method for AI systems, a detailed case study involving a kill chain against AI systems submitted to MITRE ATLAS, and the discovery and publication of a high-impact CVE related to a remotely exploitable SQL injection vulnerability. This vulnerability poses a severe risk to companies connecting AI systems with internal databases, potentially leading to sensitive information leaks or data destruction.\n\nMatthew R.

His career has focused on national cybersecurity policy, including strategy and operations oversight roles in CISA, the Department of Defense, and the United States Senate.\n\nCISA would like to introduce our new UN!TE Framework project and invite attendees to contribute to its development. UN!TE aims to be a reference tool for cyber defenders to work as a national or international team to detect and disrupt adversaries by highlighting key actions that defenders can take as part of a team of organizations against every step of an APT campaign.Cyber intrusions are often part of a broader campaign by the threat actor that involves operations targeting multiple organizations. Stopping the overarching campaign requires collective action as a team of network defenders within targeted organizations, cybersecurity service providers, government, and other partners. Like in any team sport, acting as a group is not easy. Cyber operational collaboration requires constant communication, planning, leadership, and adaptation. In order to fully mature our collective cyber defense operations, we need to better systematize and routinize the collaborative operations and tactics. UN!TE seeks to do this by laying out a framework of high-level potential actions that defensive partners can reference to ensure they are fulling their role in the national team. It aligns these key actions against every step of an APT campaign.CISA is beginning a collaborative effort to engage with the community to shape UN!TE into a useable public tool. Since the FIRSTCON audience works on these issues everyday, they are the ideal contributors to UN!TE.\n\nArtur Oleyarsh is a Security Researcher from Palo Alto Networks. Researching vulnerabilities related to Open Source Software, Vulnerability Management, and Cloud Native Technologies.\n\nOpen-source ecosystem based on trust relationship between package managers, package maintainers, and end users – The Holy Trinity!In the absence of standard security features for the reliability of packages being uploaded to package managers - Malicious packages exploit this middleware of “Open Source unwritten rule and concept”.A piece of a few lines of malicious code or entire module that uploaded into legit and trusted software can slip under the radar and bypass the security alerts and can be one of the links and sometimes even the first link of a Supply Chain attack.This is undoubtedly one of the biggest challenges in the open source ecosystem, mainly because of the increasing use and adoption of open source libraries and frameworks and lack of holistic solution for ensuring safe use of open-source packages.It was quite clear that as the number of attack attempts increased, there would also be an increase in copycats who would try to reuse the malicious code in order to carry out new or mimic other threat actors.In this talk Shaul and Artur will discuss about new research of Python packages that contained reused malicious code of famous threat actor in an attempt to launch an independent attack, which is an exploitation example of abusing the “Holy Trinity” in Open-Source ecosystem.They will analyze the rapid but inefficient solution of corporations that are almost helpless against new attack techniques.And talk about future solution and standardization that Open-Source community should adopt.\n\nI am a seasoned, results-driven leader with extensive experience in AI and cybersecurity.

Cloud logs serve a similar purpose as their on-premise counterparts, though differing significantly in format and granularity between cloud providers.While most cloud CLI tools provide a one-to-one correlation between an API being invoked and a single corresponding API event being generated in cloud log telemetry, browser-based interactive console sessions differ profoundly across cloud providers in ways that obfuscate the original actions taken by the user. For example, when a user clicks IAM->Users in an interactive AWS console session it produces 300+ CloudTrail events to support the numerous tiles and tables in the UI.Since March 2023 the presenters have developed a solution to this challenge and are proud to demo and release the open-source Cloud Console Cartographer framework (including a full CLI and supplemental GUI visualizer) as part of this presentation.The presenters will demonstrate the extent of the console logging problem and the technical challenges and capabilities required to solve it, showcasing the tool’s usefulness in translating real-world examples of malicious console sessions produced by notable cloud threat actors during first-hand incident response investigations.Come and learn how the open-source Cloud Console Cartographer framework can provide clarity for threat hunters and detection engineers alike, helping defenders stop slogging through logging while putting the “soul” back in “console.”\n\nPiotr is the CEO and a Member of the Board of Trustees at The Shadowserver Foundation, a non-profit organization with a mission of making the Internet a more secure environment.

Piotr is also a member of the Honeynet Project (where he has also served on the Board of Directors), a well-known and respected non-profit that is committed to the development of honeypot technologies and threat analysis.\n\nThe non-profit Shadowserver Foundation (https://shadowserver.org) has been active for over 15 years, delivering free daily cyber threat intelligence feeds to National CSIRTs (currently 201 National CSIRTs covering 175 countries and territories) and many other organizations that have an Internet presence (currently over 8000 organizations worldwide, including Sectoral CSIRTs, ISP/CSPs, hosting providers, enterprises, banks, academia, hospitals, SMEs, etc).This talk will tell the story of how The Shadowserver Foundation has responded to many recent high-profile critical vulnerabilities such as Citrix NetScaler (CVE-2023-3519 etc), Ivanti MobileIron (CVE-2023-35078), Cisco IOS XE device implants (CVE-2023-20198), and others affecting tens of thousands of organizations globally. This includes how we worked on new vulnerability scans on an Internet scale to be able to quickly detect exposed, vulnerable or compromised instances and understand the scale of each incident. It will also cover how we improved our attack detection signatures and utilized our global honeypot sensor network to be able to quickly detect exploitation attempts. All information gathered was then quickly disseminated to the affected parties and their National CSIRTs via our free remediation feeds. None of that would be possible without close collaboration with multiple partners who provided a lot of information observed “on-the-ground”, which we could combine with our own data collection mechanisms to maximize remediation effects. We will cover the lessons learned from this collaboration, which will hopefully allow for even more effective response from the community in future incidents.\n\nAfter getting his PhD in Mathematics, Dave spent the next 25 years consulting for the Australian Government, primarily working with Defence, Intel and Law Enforcement, before moving to CrowdStrike, and Gen Digital (which is formed from the merger of Avira, Avast and NortonLifelock).

The talk initially discusses forms of Intelligence that are valuable and worth promptly communicating. Examples of how this lack of sharing prevents rapid response to incidents and, in many cases, allows threat actors time to achieve their objectives.Common reasons that prevent sharing are discussed to highlight problems and to show how secure collaboration can help. For example, your organisation might have suffered a breach; you want to share pertinent lessons learned and even Intelligence to help others. However, doing so could expose your reputation. What can you do?Or your organisation might be attacked, and you want to ask for help - anonymously, without divulging where you work.We show how Intel sharing can be achieved in an Incident Responder community and provide step-by-step instructions on implementing with popular team messaging platforms like Slack, Mattermost, Discord and Microsoft Teams. The presentation will demonstrate how this can work in a trusted IR community like FIRST, other CERTs or Incident Response communities.\n\nRafael Lukas Maers has a Master's degree in Mathematics and has worked in mnemonic since 2013.

Her major achievement to date at CERT NZ is overseeing the launch of the new Own Your Online platform.\n\nCyber security is often portrayed as part of a shadowy world of hackers and international espionage.As a result, everyday humans find it hard to see it as relevant.In this case study, CERT NZ explains how it has re-branded its ‘front door’ for consumers and small businesses and organisations, to make cyber security more relevant and appealing.After a review of its communications approach and extensive market research, CERT NZ realised that a radical change was needed to engage New Zealanders in the vital task of improving their cyber security practices.This resulted in the birth of ‘Own Your Online’ (ownyouronline.govt.nz), a new platform for communicating with everyday audiences.In this presentation Engagement, Communications and Partnerships Manager Jane O’Loughlin will talk about CERT NZ’s journey in developing a new brand that is helping the agency better engage with consumers and businesses.\n\nHuiSeong Yang is a researcher in the Threat Analysis Team at S2W in Korea. He is in charge of analyzing various malware, including ransomware, and has recently been working on methodologies to analyze malware written in Go and Rust languages, which are often used to make analysis more difficult. His main research focuses on tracking ransomware groups operating as Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS).\n\nWhile many RaaS groups have come and gone in recent years, the LockBit group has been one of the most active. LockBit operates as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) and employs multiple affiliates, causing far more damage than any other ransomware group. As of 2023, it has inflicted 1,029 ransomware victims out of a total of 4,951 ransomware victims, and is aggressive enough to rank first in the number of victims among RaaS groups, at about 20%.the LockBit group has continued to grow their arsenal (which they refer to as a collection): LockBit Red, a 2.0 version of the original LockBit ransomware they developed in June 2021; LockBit Black, which cribbed code from the BlackMatter ransomware in June 2022; and the Conti-based LockBit Green, released this year... How far is the group willing to go to quote code from other ransomware? And then there's the rumored Babuk. As you can see, we've been tracking the LockBit group since its inception.\n\nMatt Hand is the Director of Security Research at Prelude where he conducts research and development with the goal of making endpoint protection products more effective.

This talk aims to delve deep into the layers of attack chains, emphasizing the need to decompose adversary tactics to enhance detection capabilities. Adversaries employ a diverse toolbox of techniques, and a breach merely represents a discreet manifestation of a fraction of these tactics. This presentation will underscore the importance of dissecting these tactics into actionable components. Using the MITRE ATT&CK framework as a foundation, we will explore how adversary procedures can be broken down further into variants, each comprising a series of discrete operations. By zooming in on these operations, security professionals can attain a granular understanding of the threat landscape, enabling the development of more effective detection mechanisms. The talk will provide insights into how focusing on the detection coverage of these operations can significantly bolster an organization's detection posture.\n\nAfter working as a customer engineer in the authentication and security field at an IT vendor, I am currently in charge of responding to and analyzing security incidents at ITOCHU Cyber & Intelligence.\n\nBusiness Email Compromise (BEC) poses a global threat, leading to substantial financial losses. Despite the widespread adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA), attackers have evolved their tactics, notably through Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) attacks, increasingly prevalent since 2021. The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) reports a doubling of phishing attacks between 2020 and 2022, indicating a persistent rise in BEC phishing.Microsoft 365 (M365), the world's most utilized webmail service, is a prime target for these attacks. However, available information on M365 account breaches lacks detailed insights into attackers' behaviors and intrusion trace deletion. The absence of comprehensive incident data hampers effective analysis and monitoring by company CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team).Current defense recommendations, scattered across various documents for different products (Microsoft Entra ID, Exchange, etc.), are not systematically organized. This complicates the work of CERT staff in investigating and responding to incident-related logs. Inadequate incident data may lead to ineffective responses, allowing intrusion risks to persist and potentially amplify damages.This presentation addresses the identified attacker techniques (email theft, app installation, and intrusion trace deletion) from actual M365 account breaches, offering insights for confirmation and response in case of incidents. Through real incident analyses, practical steps for incident handling will be shared to minimize the risk of account compromise and subsequent damage expansion.The goal is to enhance on-site staff response efficiency, disseminate appropriate countermeasures against intrusions and BEC risks, and ultimately contribute to safeguarding numerous companies.\n\nAlexandre Dulaunoy enjoys when humans are using machines in unexpected ways.

To this end, many are embracing the concept of playbook-driven workflow orchestration: fully or partially automated sequences of tasks carried out in response to a triggering event. Current proprietary formats for such playbooks limit interoperability and the ability to collaborate and exchange defensive tradecraft across organizational boundaries. The OASIS Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) standard overcomes this by providing a common framework and a machine-processable schema that caters for playbooks that are natively interoperable and can be shared and executed across technological and organizational boundaries. As a next step, TNO and University of Oslo developed open-source software tools that allow seamless creation and execution of CACAO security playbooks. This presentation will showcase these tools, demonstrate their use in a test environment and highlight practical learnings from adopting and promoting CACAO in national and pan-European projects.\n\nI’m Merisa Lee, a Security Professional with over 26 in technology, 14 of those years specifically in Security. I’ve been an engineer, a people manager, and a technical program manager during my career. I have commanded incidents at companies such as Amazon, Meta, Cisco Meraki, DoorDash, and Uber, and managed teams at Dell, Meta, and Cisco Meraki. I can be reached on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/merisalee/!\n\nLet’s tell a better story to your senior leadership. Incident Response team managers spend a lot of their time working on the technical side, but translating this to something for senior leadership or even a board can be difficult. While industry standard metrics are measured with metrics such as Time to Detect (TTD), Time to Acknowledge (TTA), Time to Mitigate (TTM), and Time to Resolve (TTR), none of this actually tells leaders how your program is doing or how mature your security stance is. Successfully telling a clear and concise story to your leadership and board with a measurable standard will effectively highlight where your Incident Response program is succeeding and where you need more budget or resourcing to improve your program.\n\nFernando is a software engineer at VirusTotal.

However, most models were not trained specifically for understanding CTI. We will present a custom LLM, fine-tuned for CTI purposes. But of course, that only makes sense with a CTI text benchmark dataset. Creating these two systems is a challenging journey. Set-backs guaranteed. We will share our findings. Comes with batteries and MISP-integration.\n\nThomas Proell has been working for Siemens in product security for 15 years. After five years of penetration testing he changed sides and is leading the incident handling and vulnerability response team for Siemens ProductCERT.\n\nHis goal is to push for more transparency in vulnerability handling to give affected stakeholders all necessary information about vulnerabilities to defend their systems.\n\nWhen vulnerabilities like Log4J show up in the supply chain, the reaction of many vendors is disappointing in speed and quality. It takes much too long to publicly disclose robust information which products and which versions are affected, and which are not. In most cases, this information is not released at all.The security community, customers and law makers have suspected this for some time now and approaches like VEX and SBOM are pushed for that reason. We see demands for this information in legislation on most continents.However, the impact of all these efforts will be limited in real life as long as we do not properly understand the key issues. This talk will give some insights of where the problems lie and how we need to adapt our tools and approaches.\n\nYuichi Kikuchi joined Panasonic in 2019 out of school and joined the vulnerability testing team at the Product Security Center as his first job in the cyber security field.\n\nHis daily work involves vulnerability testing various products and devices for Panasonic business units and alongside that work he thinks about better ways to score and classify vulnerabilities.\n\nAt the Product Security Center at Panasonic, we have a team dedicated to testing for vulnerabilities in products prior to shipment. The testing activities cover a wide range of products and has been ongoing for around 20 years. One of the main challenges the vulnerability testing team encounters is the need to provide easy to understand \"actionable\" vulnerability information to our internal developers.When providing vulnerability information and testing results to product developers, confusion arises when we just provide some technical information about the vulnerability alongside widely used classifications and scores (such as CWE and CVSS). With our goal being, to provide more secure products to our users, it is critical that we make vulnerability information easier to understand so it is ‘actionable’ for the developers.In this presentation, I will provide an overview into how we organized/classified years’ worth of vulnerability and testing data, and how we at Panasonic have devised a better way to effectively communicate with product developers about discovered vulnerabilities.\n\nMr Seet Lik Hau currently leads the Infocomm Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (ISG-CERT) which he manage a team of forensics and malware analysts.

This sharing highlights the vulnerability of these enterprises to cyberattacks, underscoring the crucial role played by frontline customer services. Moreover, there is a growing awareness of how Point of Sales (PoS) systems serve as potential entry points for threat actors into retail stores or dealers which in turn become a supply chain risk for a telecom business. Small and medium-sized telecom businesses often lack robust cybersecurity measures, making them prime targets for ransomware attacks. Frontline customer service teams, being the first line of defence, require increased awareness and preparedness to prevent potential breaches. It is essential to emphasize cybersecurity training and reinforce defences, particularly securing PoS systems, to safeguard the integrity of telecommunication operations in smaller entities.\n\nWorking as a vulnerability coordinator at JPCERT/CC for 8 years, Tomo currently leads the Global CVD project of the organization, which aims to contribute to the global CVD ecosystem stability through collaborations with the stakeholders from different parts of the world.\n\nCoordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) is a global challenge. In its process, vulnerability information flows through global supply chain. It is often complicated - many stakeholders are involved in many CVD cases. Asia Pacific region is no exception. There are many software product/component suppliers in the region. Several CERT organizations in the region conduct CVD or act as CNA individually, but there never has been a cooperative system built. Also, in the region there is so much CVD adoption space left. To start tackling the issues together, also aiming to create a cooperative framework in the region, CVD working group was created in APCERT - the CSIRT community of Asia Pacific. In this presentation, the motivation, background, activities and the challenges found, as well as the future aims of the working group will be explained.\n\nFabrice Kah is the PSIRT Operations Leader at Schneider Electric, based in France.

Learn how Schneider Electric has collected thousands of our product SBOMs and how we are leveraging the SBOMs as part of our corporate product CERT to quickly analyze and focus our attention when time is of importance. This presentation describes how we modified our policies and processes to collect, generate, and store thousands of SBOMs. You will hear how we have leveraged SBOMs during the Log4j and OpenSSL vulnerability events. Then we will conclude with key learnings, suggestions, and opportunities for improvement.\n\nThomas Geras is a Doctoral Candidate at HM Munich University of Applied Sciences.\n\nThere are many mysteries surrounding sharing communities, mainly due to their hidden workings and the complexity of joining. Nevertheless, these communities are critical to the security ecosystem, so a more profound understanding is necessary. In addition, they face challenges such as building trust, communicating effectively, and addressing social problems.This work aims to understand better the working methods, organizational structures, goals, benefits, and challenges of sharing communities to help improve their effectiveness and efficiency. To achieve this goal, we conducted video interviews with 25 experts from different countries worldwide who participate in various types of sharing communities. In addition, we applied socio-technical systems (STS) theory in our analysis process to elaborate on our findings from the interviews, identify correlations between them, and explore the interrelationships between social and technical elements of sharing communities.Our findings underscore the need for a holistic view of how sharing communities work. Instead of looking at individual aspects in isolation, considering the interrelationships between the different elements, especially the social, is crucial. This holistic perspective allows us to understand better the complexity and dynamics of sharing communities and how they can function effectively and efficiently. The findings of this study provide valuable impetus for the further development of sharing communities and can serve as a basis for future research.\n\nMathieu is a member of CERT-EU's Digital Forensics and Incident Response team.

While this free, open-source project is very active and offers a wide range of features, its implementation is challenging, and especially for MSSPs. At CERT-EU, we serve the 90 European Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies (Union entities) and we strive to deliver the best possible services to them. This is why we relentlessly try to enhance the detection capabilities of our Security Log Monitoring Service. To this endeavour, we created droid, a tool that we specifically built to introduce Detection-as-Code in our environment. In the spirit of fostering a culture of collective progress, we are very excited to share droid as our take to facilitate the ingestion of Sigma rules for any organisation. The tool unlocks the following use cases: detection content versioning, vendor agnostic approach, cross-tool detection content, testing and validating detection rules, by taking advantage of Atomic Red Team, automation of exporting the rules to multiple SIEMs and EDRs.\n\nMasato Ikegami is a malware analyst at Canon IT Solutions with 10 years of experience in cybersecurity.

When one of these countries is the one you are living in you might have a seriuos problem, specially if you work in cybersecurity. Luckily for us, we live in a connected world and you can find a colleague that is also facing the same problem in his country and work together with him, even if you are more than 10.000 Km away. This is the story and lessons learned of two researchers working together, facing several infostealer campaigns targeting Japan and Spain and how they started sharing information that helped them understand why the cybercriminals were so focused on their countries. This is also an example on how to create and maintain a collaboration channel between two distant countries that can be used as an example if you are facing similar problems.\n\nYutaro Ichimura is a Security Engineer at NTT Communications since 2022.

His job is streamlining security operations for incident response. He is a GIAC Incident Handler (GCIH).\n\nWe have been able to streamline our security operations with the SOAR/SIEM tool and the ITSM solution. Previously, we were responding manually to a high volume of alerts. We had to investigate each alert with a variety of security tools, which increased workload of us Also, we had problems with incident management too. Because we used multiple management tools for different operations Therefore, information was scattered and it caused delay in incident response. We used SOAR/SIEM tools and ITSM solution to automate incident response and to improve incident management. Specifically, by integrating Sentinel with various security tools, we automated generating tickets, investigation, removing false positive, removing threats, and remediation. We also standardized processes and unified management tools to ensure smooth coordination among the parties involved. Finally, we reduced security operations workload by 73%.\n\nEx-Police Officer and Cloud Incident Responder with 10+ years of IT experience.

Imagine what can go wrong when attackers get to own this power for themselves… you are right, lightspeed growth equals a lot of destruction power.\n\nIn this talk, we are going to analyze a real example of an AWS Kubernetes cluster infection through a software development supply chain compromise. The attackers were able to get AWS credentials from a DevOps workstation and use them to introduce a poisoned docker image into a kubernetes cluster. It allowed them to move laterally within the cluster and to the cloud provider, retrieving secrets, passwords, tokens, and a bunch of other data.\n\nLuckily, we were able to detect them just in time, as they had retrieved secrets that would have allowed them to move laterally to other companies or execute a new docker image with nastier results.\n\nWe are going to present the examples using a real-time lab, offering examples for incident responders and malware analysts to understand how to investigate these techniques, getting through the cyber kill chain and explaining what went wrong and what could have been done better.\n\nMathew is a Principal Threat Analyst on Mandiant Intelligence’s Advanced Practices team, he is based out of Adelaide, Australia.
