Hence, quality and reliability are rapidly becoming \"features\" just like performance, power-consumption and die size, for both computing and communication applications. Economic analysis shows that it is infeasible to achieve the high levels of quality and reliability expected by customers without designing in these features from very early stages of product development. Techniques for designing quality and reliability features will be described and the associated future challenges will be discussed. The tutorial will include discussions on the cost of quality, manufacturing defects and test methodologies, design for testability, test pattern generation, built-in-self-test, infant mortality of integrated circuits, impact of noise on test and reliability, soft errors, design techniques for soft error protection, concurrent error detection and self-repairing systems. Examples from actual products will be used to illustrate the applicability of these techniques. Subhasish Mitra is a Senior Staff Engineer at Intel where he works Design for Testability, Reliability, Manufacturability and Debug. He is also a Consulting Assistant Professor in Stanford University's EE Department. Previously, he was the leader of the DARPA-sponsored ROAR (Reliability Obtained by Adaptive Reconfiguration) project at Stanford, and a consultant for Agilent's System Chip Testing project. His research interests include digital testing, fault-tolerant computing, VLSI design and computer architecture. His recent awards includea Recognition Award at Intel for developing a break-through compaction methodology for test cost reduction, and a Best Panel Award at the VLSI Test Symposium. 12:00-1:30 Lunch 1:30-5:00 Afternoon Tutorial Chair: John Wawrzynek Past and Future of Cryptographic Engineering Christof Paar Ruhr-Universitaet Bochum Security has quickly evolved from a rather obscure niche area to an important aspect of todayB4s IT applications. The recent trend of pervasive computing will make it necessary to integrate security functionality in an extremely broad spectrum of applications, from traditional computers to household appliances. This application range will force many engineers (without training in cryptography) to think about efficient ways of implementing crypto functions, which are the core tools for providing IT security. This talk will give an overview of the field of IT security, with a strong focus on cryptographic engineering. After discussing the general objectives of IT security, we will introduce the types of practical crypto schemes , case studies that highlight both symmetric and asymmetric (public-key) algorithms and the challenges of implementing them in hardware and software, the architecture of a high performance public-key engine along with the interaction between implementation and security requirements, and an introduction to side channel attacks (perhaps the most important attacks against crypto schemes in the real world).The presentation will conclude with a discussion of future research challenges. Christof Paar has the chair for Communication Security (www.crypto.rub.de/index_eng.html) at the Horst Gortz Institute for IT Security at the University of Bochum in Germany. As faculty member at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, he founded the Cryptography and Information Security Labs and is co-founder of the CHES (Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems, www.chesworkshop.org) Workshop series. He has received an NSF CAREER award for research in cryptography and reconfigurable hardware. Christof Paar has been teaching cryptography courses inacademia and industry since 1995.
