        "text": "The Global Environmental Measurement and Monitoring (GEMM) Initiative Challenge\n\nIn partnership with the GEMM Initiative, the Optica Imaging Congress and Optica Sensing Congress will present panel discussions on two challenges related to global environmental measurement and monitoring. The organizers will select these two challenges based on interest from the community, as resulting from the paper submission process.\n\nGEMM Panel I: Water Quality and Pollution Monitoring for a Sustainable Future\n\nPresider: Anne-Pia Marty, University of Cambridge, UK\n\nGEMM Panel II: Sensing Air Quality, Greenhouse Gases, and Wildfires for a Sustainable Future\n\nPresiders: Roderik Krebbers, Radbound University, Netherlands and Michelle Bailey, National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA\n\nAbout the GEMM Initiative\n\nFounded through partnership of two international scientific societies, Optica and the American Geophysical Union (AGU), the GEMM Initiative aims to leverage existing and emerging measurement technology to address pervasive environmental and climate challenges impacting diverse communities across the globe.\n\nThrough the work of regional GEMM Centers, the Initiative pursues solutions for air and water quality, climate (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions and urban heat islands), environmental contaminants (e.g., microplastics, pathogens, and toxins) and resource management (e.g., water scarcity).\n\nGEMM brings together community leaders, researchers, technology developers and policy shapers to cultivate actionable solutions to community priorities."
