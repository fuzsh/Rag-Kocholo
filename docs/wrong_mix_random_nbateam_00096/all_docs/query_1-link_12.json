        "text": "We are pleased to report on our participation in the 35th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IEEE IV 2024), held at Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, from June 2-5, 2024. This prestigious conference, sponsored by the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS), brought together researchers, engineers, practitioners, and students from various sectors to discuss the latest advancements in intelligent vehicles and vehicle-infrastructure cooperation. Our laboratory was represented by Prof. Manabu Tsukada and Dr. Tao Ye presented his paper titled “Zero-Knowledge Proof of Distinct Identity: A Standard-Compatible Sybil-Resistant Pseudonym Extension for C-ITS.” The paper addresses the challenge of Sybil attacks in Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) by proposing a novel protocolRead more\n\nKengo Suzuki (M2) recently participated in the 2nd Workshop on Next-generation Open and Programmable Radio Access Networks (NG-OPERA), held alongside the IEEE INFOCOM 2024 conference in Vancouver, Canada. This workshop focused on the transformation of radio access networks (RAN) as we move towards 5G-Advanced and 6G technologies. Topics like the Open RAN movement, open-source software solutions, and AI’s role in network management were highlighted. Kengo presented his research paper titled “Toward B5G/6G Connected Autonomous Vehicles: O-RAN-Driven Millimeter-Wave Beam Management and Handover Management.” His work proposed a novel way to use O-RAN architecture to improve communication for autonomous vehicles, especially in challenging road scenarios. Notably, his presentation won the Best PaperRead more\n\nAssociate Professor Manabu Tsukada participated in the 6th International Workshop on Pervasive Computing for Vehicular Systems (PerVehicle 2024) held in Biarritz, France at 15th March 2024. This conference served as a platform for researchers and practitioners to discuss the evolving landscape of intelligent vehicular systems and the role of pervasive computing technologies in shaping their future. One of the highlights of the conference was Professor Tsukada’s presentation titled “V2X and Beyond: Integrating Roadside Units for Next-Level Cooperative Automated Driving.” The presentation explored the transformative potential of integrating Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and Roadside Perception Units (RSPUs) in enhancing autonomous driving capabilities. Through rigorous field tests and simulation experiments, Professor Tsukada showcasedRead more\n\nFrom December 14th to 15th, 2023, at the National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, Yuze Jiang, an M2 student from our laboratory, was awarded the Best Paper Award (Silver) at the ACM International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications (ICEA 2023), despite it being his first participation in an international conference. The award-winning paper proposed a method of using LiDAR-equipped roadside units and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication to accurately estimate the position of connected vehicles and assist them when their self-localization is insufficient. The results of the simulation indicated that this method surpasses the traditional Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) scan matching-based approach in termsRead more\n\nWe’re thrilled to share the exciting news that we’re set to make a significant impact at the upcoming 26th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2023). Five of our research submissions have been accepted for presentation at this prestigious event, taking place from 24th to 28th September in Bilbao, Spain. ITSC, sponsored by the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society, is an annual flagship event that brings together scholars, industry experts, and enthusiasts from around the world. The conference serves as a platform for presenting new developments in theory, analytical and numerical simulation and modeling, experimentation, advanced deployment, and case studies in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) domain. EachRead more\n\nThe research outcomes of the CREST Internet of Realities project will be exhibited at Interop Tokyo 2023, to be held at Makuhari Messe from June 14 to 16, 2023. Tsukada Laboratory team will exhibit the following two demonstrations. External Human-Machine Interface for self-driving cars using Augmented Reality Web viewer for Building Information Modeling Booth Info: 4T24 Here is the handout of the project.Read more\n\nAssociate Professor Tsukada will serve as session chair for the Vertical Track: Transportation at the IEEE 8th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT) 2022 to be held in Yokohama, Japan. Dr. Nakazato and Mr. Pengfei Lin will also give presentations.Read more"
