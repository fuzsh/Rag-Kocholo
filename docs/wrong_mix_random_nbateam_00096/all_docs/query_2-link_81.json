        "text": "Prof. Matt Bishop (University of California, Davis, USA)\n\nMatt Bishop received his Ph.D. in computer science from Purdue University, where he specialized in computer security, in 1984. He was a research scientist at the Research Institute of Advanced Computer Science and on the faculty at Dartmouth College before joining the Department of Computer Science at the University of California at Davis.\n\nHis main research area is the analysis of vulnerabilities in computer systems, including modeling them, building tools to detect vulnerabilities, and ameliorating or eliminating them. He works in network security, resilience, attribution, policy modeling, data sanitization, and formal modeling of access control. He also is interested in electronic voting, worked on numerous analyses of e-voting systems including the RABA study in Maryland, and was one of the two principle investigators of the California Top-to-Bottom Review, which performed a technical review of all electronic voting systems certified in the State of California.\n\nHe is active in information assurance education, and co-led the Joint Task Force that developed the ACM/IEEE/ASIS SIGSAC/IFIP WG11.8 Cybersecurity Curricular Guidelines. The second edition of his textbook, “Computer Security: Art and Science”, was published in November 2018 by Addison-Wesley Professional. He teaches introductory programming, software engineering, operating systems, and (of course) computer security.\n\nSeminar title: Is Practical Data Sanitization Possible?\n\nResearch in data sanitization (including anonymization) emphasizes ways to prevent an adversary from desanitizing data. Most work focuses on using mathematical mappings to sanitize data, or demonstrates that a sanitized data set can be desanitized. A few papers examine incorporation of privacy requirements, either in the guise of templates or prioritization. Essentially these approaches reduce the information that can be gleaned from a data set. In this talk, we will discuss ongoing work that considers conflicts between privacy requirements and the needs of analysts examining the redacted data. Our goal is to enable an informed decision about the effects of redacting, and failing to redact data. We begin with relationships among the data being examined, including relationships with a known data set and other, additional, external data. By capturing these relationships, desanitization techniques that exploit them can be identified, and what information must be concealed in order to thwart them (if possible) can be determined. Knowing that, a realistic assessment of whether the information and relationships are already widely known or available will enable the sanitizers to assess whether irreversible sanitization is possible, and if so, what to conceal to prevent desanitization.\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nProf. Yvo G.

In fact it was a logical thinking for people familiar with Earth. Similar mistakes were made in biology, were it was assumed that oxygen and sunshine were required to enable life. Access Control as implemented today is based on a model that predates the Internet, computer viruses and massive hackings. Should we be surprized that it is inadequate? An alternative to the Access Control Matrix is discussed in this context. Chaum's 1980's Dining Cryptographers and Chaum's MIX are very well known approaches towards anonymity. At that time it was not customary for cryptographers to model the security goal. So, Chaum never modeled anonymity. Afterwards researchers were building on top of Chaum's solution, but were not looking back at the foundations of anonymity. We show that there are message probabilities for which anonymity is completely impossible. Moreover, we show that sometimes Chaum's solutions are not optimal and leak information about the sender/receiver. The question will be raised whether after 45 years research on computer security and 40 years open research in cryptography, we should not systematically revisit the foundations we regard as facts. Part of the lecture is based on recent papers in IEEE Tr. on Inform. Th, and in \"From Database to Cyber Security\", Springer.\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nProf. Virgil D.

In this seminar I describe what a useful first rest stop might look like, and illustrate one possible place for it on the road to provable security. Specifically, I show that a simple verifier can establish software root of trust (RoT) on an untrusted system unconditionally; i.e., without secrets, trusted hardware modules, or bounds on the adversary power. I will illustrate the theory foundation for proving RoT establishment unconditionally, and show that the proofs require only the availability of randomness in nature and correct specifications for the untrusted system. The verifier is trustworthy as it requires only the off-line ability to construct nonces from strings of truly random bits and evaluate a new computation primitive â the randomized polynomials -- and then perform an on-line measurement of the untrusted system's evaluation of randomized polynomials and its response time. The optimal code for randomized polynomials on the instruction sets of real processors is discussed is some detail. I also illustrate why RoT establishment is useful for obtaining other basic properties unconditionally, such as secure initial state determination and verifiable boot -- a stronger notion than secure and trusted boot. Verifiable boot can be viewed as an instance of the FlipIt game between a defender and an adversary, where the defender wins the game by discovering the presence of malware surreptitiously inserted by the adversary into the system, unconditionally.\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nProf. Joseph Yehuda Halpern (Cornell University, NY, USA)\n\nJoseph Halpern received a B.Sc. in mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1975 and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard in 1981.

But it plays a key role in many other contexts, ranging from understanding conversations to the analysis of distributed computer algorithms. More recently, it has been shown to play a key role in understanding what a blockchain protocol provides. I'll start the talk by considering a number of well-known puzzles and paradoxes, which both illustrate the subtleties of reasoning about knowledge and the advantages of having a good framework in which to make this reasoning precise. These puzzles also turn out to be closely related to important problems in distributed computing and game theory. In particular, they emphasize the importance of the notion of common knowledge, which turns out to be essential for reaching agreements and coordinating action. Unfortunately, we can prove that in practical multi-agent systems, common knowledge is not attainable. This seems somewhat paradoxical. How can common knowledge be both necessary and unattainable? The paradox gets resolved (to some extent) by examining a number of variants of common knowledge that turn out to be both attainable and sufficient for many applications. In particular, I'll show that how that a variant of common knowledge characterizes the guarantees provided by blockchain protocols. The work on blockchain is joint with Rafael Pass. The earlier work is joint with Yoram Moses, Ron Fagin, and Moshe Vardi.\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nProf. Gernot Heiser (UNSW, Sydney, Australia)\n\nGernot Heiser is Scientia Professor and John Lions Chair of Operating Systems at UNSW Sydney and Chief Research Scientist at Data61, CSIRO.

It also has proofs of security enforcement, and is the only OS in the literature with a complete and sound worst-case execution-time analysis. In this lecture I will give an overview of seL4âs verification and what it means in practice, and discuss how seL4 is being used to build secure real-world systems and some of the lessons learned. I will also introduce some of the frameworks that enable the construction of high-assurance systems on seL4, including the CAmkES framework that enables security enforcement by architecture, and the Cogent framework, that aims at reducing the verification cost of critical user-level components.\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nDr. Herb Lin (Stanford University, CA, USA)\n\nHerb Lin is a senior research scholar for cyber policy and security at the Center for International Security and Cooperation and Hank J.

Mobile technology, Cloud, Big Data, Internet of things, services and technologies that are becoming more and more pervasive and conveniently accessible, towards to the realization of a 'smart' societyâ. At the heart of this evolution is the ability to collect, analyze, process and share an ever increasing amount of data, to extract knowledge for offering personalized and advanced services. A major concern, and potential obstacle, towards the full realization of such evolution is represented by security and privacy issues. As a matter of fact, the (actual or perceived) loss of control over data and potential compromise of their confidentiality can have a strong detrimental impact on the realization of an open framework for enabling collection, processing, and sharing of data, typically stored or processed by external cloud services. In this seminar, I will illustrate some security and privacy issues arising in emerging scenarios, focusing in particular on the problem of managing data while guaranteeing confidentiality and integrity of data stored or processed by external providers.\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nProf. Gene Tsudik (University of California, Irvine, USA)\n\nGene Tsudik is a Chancellor's Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine(UCI).

If correctly implemented, RA allows Vrf to remotely detect if Prv is in an illegal or compromised state. Although several RA architectures have been proposed, little attention has been devoted to their verifiability and security guarantees that can be derived through formal verification of RA architectures. In this talk we introduce VRASED: Verifiable Remote Attestation for Simple Embedded Devices. VRASED instantiates a hybrid (HW/SW) RA co-design aimed at low-end embedded systems, e.g., simple IoT devices. Since VRASED security properties must be jointly guaranteed by HW and SW, verification is a challenging task, which has never been attempted before in the context of RA. Besides being the first formally verified RA scheme, VRASED is the first formally verified HW/SW implementation of any security service. VRASEDâs publicly available implementation is realized on Basys3 FPGA and requires 16x fewer Look-Up Tables and 36x fewer registers than the cheapest pure HW-based RA design.\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nPROTASIS Speakers\n\nDr. Spiros Antonatos\n\nSpiros Antonatos is currently a research manager at Tenable.

The first one is the increasing adoption of encryption across communication channels (and predominantly Web). The second one is that OT and IoT networks converge with the traditional IT networks. One of the major questions that arise is how network monitoring can cope up with these two major trends. Is it still relevant? Shall it be considered as part of the security product investments? In this talk we will share some insights and techniques on how network monitoring can be used in today's landscape. We will deep dive into the security posture of OT and IoT networks, their interface with the IT world and the challenges we face for assessing their risk score. We will describe how we can tackle the encryption challenge and how we can detect threats on the wire even in the absence of clear-text traffic.\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nDr. Petros Efstathopoulos\n\nDr. Petros Efstathopoulos is currently the Global Head of Symantec Research Labs.

Personal data can affect our reputations, it can be used to exercise control over us and in the wrong hands, it can cause great harm. People need a partner to safeguard their identity and defend them from nefarious actors. They need help identifying the important elements of their digital life that need to be kept private and secure. Furthermore, enterprises, governments, and all organizations also have sensitive information that can be hacked. Businesses that operate utilizing sensitive data are at risk themselves of legal and financial repercussions. Enterprises must face their responsibilities to ensure business success while securing their assets and preserving privacy for customers and employees. In this talk we will explore some of the challenges that motivate privacy research and we will discuss a few possible directions to address such challenges.\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nProf. Thorsten Holz (Ruhr-UniversitÃ¤t Bochum, Germany)\n\nThorsten Holz is a professor in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany.

IoT devices, however, present many security risks and thus endanger patientâs right to privacy. As the GDPR (Regulation 2016/679) imposes enhanced responsibilities to data controllers and obligations for improving security of personal data processing, IoT devices should be designed to comply with the GDPR requirements, such as the principles of risk assessment and privacy by design and by default.\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nProf. Dr. Eleni Kosta\n\nProf. Dr. Eleni Kosta is full Professor of Technology Law and Human Rights at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology and Society (TILT, Tilburg University, the Netherlands).

The rationale behind data protection legislation is to condition interferences in order to legitimise the processing of personal data. The most relevant parts of the GDPR are discussed, in particular accountability (Article 5(2)), Data protection impact assessment (Articles 35-36), data protection by design and by default (Article 25), and security of processing (Article 32).\n\nVisit Homepage\n\nProf. Kaveh Razavi\n\nKaveh Razavi is an assistant professor of computer science at the VUSec group of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

A lot of this interest is driven by vulnerability research (often in the form of \"stunt hacking\"). While useful and frankly engaging and attractive, this research does not really help answer the fundamental question of how to embed security analysis in design. In this talk, we will use automotive security as a case study to try to outline a risk-based design methodology that can be used to deal with our hyper-connected future."
