Mia Zhong, a Postdoctoral Researcher at City, University of London, delivered a presentation entitled, \"The 'Studentness' Penalty: Opening up the Black Box of Student Employment\"\n\nTitle:The 'Studentness' Penalty: Opening up the Black Box of Student Employment\n\nAbstract:Students comprise approximately four per cent of the UK labour force and as much as 20 per cent in some occupations and jobs. Yet students' work is typically seen as marginal, secondary both to their current learning and future working biographies. Recent recognition that students face polycrises (austerity, inflation, rising housing and tuition costs) has focused public and media attention on students engaging in 'earning while learning' (EwL) and intensified narratives that emphasise the negative impacts of work for young people's education. Meanwhile, however, students' actual working conditions, occupations and employment experiences have received limited attention and constitute something of a 'black box'. We begin to open that box by focusing on the working lives of full-time students (aged 16-29) over the last 18 years. Data reveal small increases in the proportion currently engaged in paid work, but considerable consistency in rates of student work, job characteristics and occupational distribution over time. Gender is identified as a key variable in shaping student employment rates, with women considerably more likely than men to work while studying, especially at younger ages. We find no evidence of a gender pay gap in EwL but this is largely because most student workers are concentrated in two 'integrated' occupations, which are poorly paid but gender equitable - signalling the presence of a 'studentness' penalty. Older students are more likely to work in gender-segregated occupations, with both male and female gender pay advantages for gender-dominant employment, suggesting a possible early incentive for occupational gender segregation. In conclusion, we challenge the notion that education and work constitute two separate (temporally-ordered) spheres. To address the under-theorisation of EwL, we argue that these experiences may play an important role in setting expectations about the nature of work and, therefore, require greater attention and integration into conceptualisations of the 'working-life-course'.\n\nSpeaker:Mia Zhong is a postdoctoral researcher at City, University of London on the ESRS project: \"L-earning: Rethinking young Women's Working lives\". This project is a 3-year study exploring young women's early experiences of work - including work while studying - and how these experiences may contribute to gendered inequalities in later life. Mia is a Ph.D. candidate at the sociology and demography joint program at UC Berkeley. She is interested in family, work, gender, and social networks. Mia is also interested in studying young full-time mothers who establish their careers as social media influencers, and she has been a research member at the UC Berkeley Social Network Studies.\n\nWatch the recording here\n\nCPC-CG Webinar - Francesco Rampazzo (Seminars and lectures)\n\nOnline\n\nThursday, May 30th 2024\n\n13:00 UK Time\n\nThis CPC-CG Webinar will take place on Thursday 30 May 2024, at 13:00 UK Time. Francesco Rampazzo of the University of Oxford will be presenting, \"Exploring global family change through over a million family pictures\".\n\nTitle: Exploring global family change through over a million family pictures\n\nAbstract: In an era of rapid social change, our research delves into the evolving perceptions and representations of family dynamics worldwide. Using a vast dataset of over 1.5 million family images from Getty Images spanning 2005 to 2023, we investigate global trends in family portrayal through mass media. Our first study reveals Europe and North America as key producers and consumers of family images, with a notable preference for depictions featuring children and mothers. This preference persists across diverse cultural contexts, reflecting broader societal norms. Intriguing variations in family composition portrayal over time and across societies underscore the complex interplay between culture, demographics, and media representations, shedding light on evolving societal norms surrounding family and gender roles in commercial imagery.\n\nIn our second study, we explore the representation of LGBTQ+ families in global visual imagery and its implications for cultural globalisation. Despite legal advancements for LGBTQ+ rights worldwide, visual representations of these families remain understudied. Analysing sales data from Getty Images, we investigate the evolution of LGBTQ+ family representation and patterns of image sales. Preliminary findings indicate a notable increase in LGBTQ+ family depictions, particularly in countries with supportive legislation. However, these images are primarily produced and sold by Western countries, highlighting the influential role of visual representations in shaping social norms and emphasising the need for nuanced understandings within LGBTQ+ rights and recognition amidst cultural globalisation processes.\n\nRegistration: https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEqduyhrTsvGN0XnosNpp3mJFFJ5cEi-wID\n\nSpeaker: Dr Francesco Rampazzo is a Lecturer in Demography at the University of Oxford.

Professor Ann Berrington of the University of Southampton will be presenting \"Parental social background and reasons for intergenerational co-residence among young adults: New insights from the UK GGS\".\n\nTitle: Parental social background and reasons for intergenerational co-residence among young adults: New insights from the UK GGS\n\nAbstract: Young adults' transitions to residential independence have increasingly been delayed over the past few decades. Covid-19 and the cost-of-living crisis are likely to have accelerated this delay and changed norms regarding the acceptability of intergenerational co-residence. A previous lack of data means that hitherto it has been unclear whether co-residence represents a choice or constraint, and how this differs by gender and social background. For some young people co-residence is a positive choice, for example if they are living rent-free so that they can save up to afford rent or a deposit. Others will be living with their parent(s) because they simply cannot afford to live away. Experiences of leaving and returning to the parental home differ according to the resources available, and hence it is important to consider experiences according to parental socio-background. Using data collected within the 2022/23 UK Generations and Gender Survey we find that reasons given for co-residence vary by age. In comparison with those aged 25 and above, those aged 18-24 are more likely to give the response that they are happy living with their parent(s)/not ready to move out, or to cite the convenience of living at home. Those aged 25 and above are more likely to report economic reasons for co-residence. We find that the importance of economic reasons is similar according to parental socio-economic background, with roughly half of the sample of young adults saying that they are living with a parent either because they cannot afford to leave home, or are saving up for housing costs. Those from more advantaged backgrounds were, however, more likely to give \"convenience\" as a rationale for living with a parent. We consider these findings in terms of inequalities in transitions to adulthood.\n\nProfessor Ann Berrington is a Professor of Demography and Social Statistics, and directs the Fertility & Family strand of the ESRC Centre for Population Change at the University of Southampton.

When it comes to challenges posed by recent and future population dynamics, e.g. by migration, health impacts of climate change and population shrinking, how can demography contribute by improving understanding of these processes and by providing reliable population projections for more evidence-informed policy making? What are beneficial examples of linking data sources, e.g. by combining information from registers, surveys, social media, satellite or other data?\n\nC.

It is the first public exhibition as part of our 3-year academic project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council's Inclusive Ageing initiative, titled 'Promoting inclusivity in pension protection and other forms of saving among men and women from black and minority ethnic communities in the UK: a mixed methods study', and based in the Centre for Research on Ageing, Department of Gerontology and Winchester School of Art, in collaboration with the ESRC Centre for Population Change Connecting Generations in the University of Southampton. The exhibition delves into the profound impact that life experiences and accumulation of resources have on later life outcomes. Here, we confront a stark reality: while many older adults relish the rewards of their labour and care contributions in retirement, others face a higher risk of possessing low financial resources when they reach their later life. More specifically, research shows that women and members of certain minority ethnic groups can be particularly affected.\n\nThrough a fusion of visual mediums and thought-provoking narratives, we aim to unravel the complexities around this topic and ignite change in perceptions. Utilising an innovative approach of participant-captured photographs, we seek to amplify the multitude of experiences and voices from minority ethnic communities. By immersing ourselves in their real-life narratives and experiences, we not only deepen our understanding of ethnic differentials in pension provision and accumulation of financial resources, but also obtain a deeper understanding of nuanced ways of preparing for later life in different communities, and pave the way for greater inclusivity and equity in future pension policy planning. Join us on this visually stimulating journey as we improve our understanding, challenge the norms and strive for a future where every individual's retirement is secure and dignified.\n\nCPC-CG Webinar - Professor Tony Champion (Seminars and lectures)\n\nZoom\n\nThursday, April 18th 2024\n\n12:00 UK Time\n\nThis CPC-CG Webinar will take place on Thursday 18 April at 12:00 UK Time. Professor Tony Champion, Emeritus Professor of Population Geography at Newcastle University will be presenting, \"The spatial impacts of the HE-related migration of the UK's school leavers: evidence from two sources\"\n\nTitle: The spatial impacts of the HE-related migration of the UK's school leavers: evidence from two sources\n\nAbstract: The rise in higher-education participation rates and the tradition of 'going away to university' has resulted in HE-related migration becoming the single largest component of internal migration for the UK migration. It has inserted a new dimension into the life course of many school leavers, involving place-to-place flows that are considerably different from when the vast majority went straight into the labour market. This seminar reports on the findings of analysing this phenomenon using two separate datasets, neither of which is perfect but potentially allowing a degree of triangulation for checking the main features. The official mid-year population estimates allow comparison of the numbers of 16-18 with 19-21 year olds, revealing the local authorities which gain and lose most from 'going away to university' movement. Secondly, the Graduate Outcomes Survey (GOS) enables the tracking of UK school leavers to university and then onto the subregion where they are working 15 months after graduation, such that the spatial impacts can be gauged in terms of both the numbers involved and the quality of human capital as measured via students' secondary-education Tariff Score and their type of job post-graduation. Each GOS respondent can be classified on the basis of their migration trajectories between domicile and workplace, enabling a set of migration accounts to be produced for each subregion. These demonstrate how the different places fare as a result of the migration of students/graduates, with more sub-regions suffering the 'double whammy' of losing out in both quantitative and qualitative terms than gaining from this process, with challenging implications for central government's current 'levelling-up' agenda.\n\nSpeaker: Tony Champion is Emeritus Professor of Population Geography at Newcastle University. His research interests include migration and its impact on population distribution and composition, with particular reference to counter-urbanization in developed countries. He chaired the IBG Working Group on Migration in Britain, which led to the publication of Migration Processes and Patterns (1992) and the IUSSP Working Group on Urbanization, which led to New Forms of Urbanization: Beyond the Urban-Rural Dichotomy (2004). He was President of the British Society for Population Studies 2013-2015 and co-editor (with Jane Falkingham) of Population Change in the United Kingdom (2016). His more recent and current research topics include the 'escalator region' effect in England, the role of migration in shaping the socio-demographic profile of British cities, the relationship between migration and commuting in England, long-term trends in migration rates (including the effect of COVID-19) and the local impacts of the UK's university-related migration.\n\nThe webinar recording can be watched here.\n\nPopulation Association of America 2024 Annual Meeting (Conferences)\n\nColumbia, Ohio\n\nWednesday, April 17th 2024\n\nSaturday, April 20th 2024\n\nThe Population Association of America's annual meeting takes place in Columbus, Ohio from 17 - 20 April 2024.\n\nCPC Members will be presenting:\n\nMigration, Migrants, and Fertility and Reproductive Health | 18 April, 08:00 | Union B\n\nAnalyzing Different Fertility Levels Among Various UK Migrant Generations\n\nJ.Baek, H.

Political science helps us to explain why such conflicts occur and who gets involved. It is the task of social demographers to assess their ramifications for people's lives. Building on recent scholarly efforts to illuminate the demographic impact of conflict, this workshop is motivated by several overarching research questions: What are the challenges and solutions to collecting data in a conflict situation? How does conflict lead to demographic changes? Do these relationships vary by the type of conflict event and demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the location where the conflict takes place? Considering recent conflicts across the globe, we hope to enter a conversation about the various ways in which conflict events can influence population dynamics and how to use novel data sources for studying these questions.\n\nAs part of the activities of the IUSSP Scientific Panel on Population Dynamics under Global Conflict and Climate Change, the workshop aims at establishing and strengthening interdisciplinary networks among scholars working in the field of conflict and demography. This in-person workshop will be held at the University of Southampton, 7-9 March 2024.

The research discussed in this Connecting Generations Thought Leader Talk will show that family connections play a crucial role, influencing how individuals view the economy and government spending programs that may impact their relatives.\n\nSurveys have typically overlooked questions about the well-being of one's family members, focusing more on the household or individual. To address this gap, Dr Zack Grant with Professor Jane Green and Professor Geoffrey Evans at Nuffield College, University of Oxford, recently conducted a new survey called Intergenpol-GB, involving over 6,000 adults in Great Britain. Detailed questions were asked about close family members in different age groups, perceptions of financial well-being of family members (as well as individuals and households), expectations of supporting family members, and targeted questions about pro-young and pro-old policy preferences, alongside political variables and vote intentions.\n\nThe findings suggest that concerns for the well-being of family members can influence political views, potentially mitigating age-based political divides in Britain. For example, older adults with financially struggling young relatives may support increased investment in education and housing, while younger adults who are worried about caring for older relatives may favour policies related to pensions and adult social care. Overall, this research indicates that 'family matters' when it comes to shaping policy preferences and political outcomes.\n\nAbout the Speaker\n\nDr Zack Grant is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Nuffield Politics Research Centre at the University of Oxford. He conducts research into why different people think the way that they do about inequality, the welfare state, immigration, and the environment in Britain and other advanced democracies. He does this through the analysis of quantitative survey data and experiments. Zack was the recipient of a British Academy Innovation Fellowship for work on intergenerational political divides during 2022-23, and will be presenting work from that project in this talk.\n\nAbout the Panellists\n\nProfessor Jane Falkingham, Dr Dianna Smith and Dr Matt Ryan will be panellists at the event.\n\nProfessor Falkingham CBE, FAcSS, FRSA is Director of the ESRC Centre for Population Change and PI of Connecting Generations.

The social rights of third country nationals as workers and parents in the UK and the European Union (Seminars and lectures)\n\nHybrid; Kellogg College, Oxford & Zoom\n\nThursday, February 29th 2024\n\n15:45 - 16:45\n\nCPC Member, Dr Traute Meyer, will be giving this seminar as part of the COMPAS Seminar Series. The seminar will take place on Thursday 29 March 2024 at 3:45pm.\n\nAbstract: Governments in the UK and EU accept skilled workers from outside their territories to boost economic growth and reverse the trend of their ageing societies. At the same time, populations are sceptical about sharing welfare state rights with newcomers. To square this circle, governments have restricted social rights for new immigrants in many European countries. However, while EU governments must observe Treaty legislation, the UK is no longer bound by such constraint. Little research exists on how much the rights of working migrants born outside the EU and their dependents diverge between countries and between immigrants and citizens and how the difference can lead to inequality between the two groups and nations.\n\nThis paper will take stock of the rights of such third-country nationals (TCNs) who come to work in the EU and the UK and their dependants during their first five years. Analysing EU- and national legislation will show that the UK is now an outlier in Europe. While most EU governments are moving towards granting TCNs the same or similar rights as EU migrants and citizens in the UK, after Brexit, many more are now excluded from essential benefits. The paper will assess what this difference means for the income of a TCN household with a skilled worker, a partner and children compared with a citizen-household in the UK, Germany and Ireland as EU countries with a similarly large intake of TCNs.\n\nDr Traute Meyer is a professor of social policy at the Department of Sociology, Social Policy and Criminology at the University of Southampton. She has researched the social rights of immigrants in Europe, including in the UK after Brexit.\n\nSign up to attend:\n\nCPC-CG Webinar - Xing Zhang & Anna Hammersmith (Seminars and lectures)\n\nDr Xing Zhang & Professor Anna Hammersmith\n\nZoom\n\nThursday, February 22nd 2024\n\n15:00 UK Time\n\nThis CPC-CG Webinar took place on Thursday 22 February 2024 at 15:00 UK Time. Dr Xing Zhang and Professor Anna Hammersmith presented, \"Adult children's marital timing and their financial support to ageing parents: Variation across gender, race and ethnicity.\"\n\nTitle: Adult children's marital timing and their financial support to ageing parents: Variation across gender, race and ethnicity.\n\nSpeaker: Anna Hammersmith is an Associate Professor of Sociology in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Grand Valley State University. She earned her PhD in Sociology at Bowling Green State University in 2018. Her primary research interests focus on intergenerational relationships over the life course, health and well-being, late-life relationship formation and dissolution, and quantitative methodologies. Her research has appeared in The Journals of Gerontology, The Journal of Health and Social Behaviour, Demography, as well as The Gerontologist.\n\nXing Zhang is an Assistant Professor in the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University. She completed her PhD in Policy Analysis and Management at Cornell University and a postdoc at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her research focuses on how parent-child relationships shape young adults' transitions to adulthood and health, and variation across race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. She has published in journals such as Journal of Marriage and Family, Social Science and Medicine, and Sociological Forum. Her research has been recognized by the National Council on Family Relations, the National Science Foundation, and the Spencer Foundation.\n\nAbstract:Marriage is a key adult milestone, yet is also considered a greedy institution that monopolizes resources, reducing adult children's financial support to their aging parents. As young people today are more likely to marry later in life, this study asks whether marriage is still a greedy institution, considering the role of marital timing. Using the U.S. National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1994-2018), we examine whether marriage timing (never, early, on time, and late) is associated with adult children's financial support to their parents, accounting for variation across gender, race, and ethnicity. We find that adult children who never married were the largest group who gave financial support. Results suggest that marriage is a greedy institution among men, women, and white adults, but less so among Black, Hispanic, and Asian adults, suggesting that expectations surrounding financial exchanges play a strong role in family support.\n\nWatch the recording here\n\nGeneral Online Research Conference 2024 (Conferences)\n\nVogelsanger Str. 295, 50825 Köln, Germany\n\nWednesday, February 21st 2024\n\nFriday, February 23rd 2024\n\n09:00 - 20:00\n\nThis conference will take place from 21 - 23 February 2024.\n\nCPC Members, Dr Olga Maslovskaya, Dr Grace Chang, and Professor Brienna Perelli-Harris will be presenting \"Data quality in a long and complex online-only survey: The UK Generation and Gender Survey (GGS), on Thursday 22 February from 5:00 - 6:00pm.\n\nRelevance & Research Question\n\nLong surveys present high burden for respondents. For a long time the rule of thumb for length of self-completion surveys was not to exceed 15-20 minutes. More surveys are moving towards self-completion designs due to increasing survey costs and also due to high rates of device ownership and internet access in the UK and other countries. For some social surveys 20 minutes is not enough to continue collecting high quality data required. Some studies experimented with longer questionnaires and obtained reassuring results, for example, European Social Survey (ESS). However, more evidence is needed in this under-researched area. We collected the first wave of the UK Generations and Gender Survey (GGS) where only online mode of data collection was available to respondents. The median time spent on the questionnaire is around 40 minutes which is much higher than the advice given to survey practitioners in the past. It is important to assess different aspects of data quality of the long questionnaire. The main research question is: is long questionnaire associated with poorer data quality?\n\nMethods & Data\n\nWe analyse the GGS collected in the UK. The GGS is a part of a global data collection infrastructure focused on population and family dynamics. The GGS collects demographic, economic, and social attitude data on young and mid-life adults (18-59) as they enter into adulthood, form partnerships, and raise children. We assess different data quality indicators: break-off rate, item nonresponse, different response style behaviours, consent to participation in the second wave of the survey among other indicators. We first conduct descriptive analysis and then use different logistic regression models to investigate data quality in the UK GGS.\n\nResults\n\nThe results are reassuring and suggest that even though the GGS questionnaire is long and complex and interviewers are not there to guide the respondents through the process, the data quality is not poor.\n\nAdded Value\n\nThis study contributes to the under-researched area of long online questionnaires. This assessment suggests that, when carefully designed, long questionnaires do not represent risk to data quality and can be successfully implemented in self-completion surveys.\n\nLabFam Seminar | Family and Employment Trajectories among Immigrants and Their Descendants in Europe (Seminars and lectures)\n\nHill Kulu\n\nZoom\n\nTuesday, February 20th 2024\n\n13:00\n\nCPC-CG Member, Professor Hill Kulu will be delivering this talk as part of the LabFam Seminar series. The event will take place online on 20th February 2024 at 13:00.\n\nAbstract: Over the past decades, European countries have witnessed increasing immigration and ethnic heterogeneity of their populations. This presentation gives an overview of the results of the MigrantLife project. The focus is on family and employment trajectories among immigrants and their descendants in the UK, France, Germany and Sweden. Our research supports significant heterogeneity in family trajectories among immigrants and their descendants in Europe.\n\nThis heterogeneity is reduced among the descendants of immigrants, although some patterns observed for immigrants persist among the descendants' groups (e.g. preference for marriage), whereas others have almost vanished (e.g. large families). The results show that migrant background is strongly associated with partnership patterns, whereas the destination country context significantly influences childbearing behaviour. This suggests that while cultural-normative factors are important in shaping partnership behaviour of immigrants and their descendants, structural-economic factors may play a more important role in fertility decisions.\n\nThe study of employment trajectories shows that most immigrant men are in education or in full-time employment after arrival, whereas many women stay inactive, especially among family migrants.\n\nAlthough the differences are reduced among the descendants of immigrants, employment levels are low for women of some minority groups. Importantly, the gender differences are larger for immigrants and their descendants than for the native population (with two native-born parents).\n\nThe results suggest the lack of opportunities for migrant and minority women with children, although cultural preferences may also explain low employment levels among some groups. We discuss the results in the light of competing theories of immigrant and ethnic minority integration: the classical theory of assimilation vs the segmented assimilation theory.\n\nAbout the Speaker: Hill Kulu is Professor of Human Geography and Demography at the University of St Andrews. He was trained in Economic Geography at the University of Tartu (MSc in 1993). He received his PhD from the University of Helsinki in 1997. Over the years, Hill has worked at the University of Tartu (1997-2002), the University of Wisconsin-Madison (1999), the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (2003-2007) and the University of Liverpool (2008-2016).\n\nHill's substantive research interests lie in the field of migration, family and health studies; his methodological interests include the application of longitudinal models in demographic research. This research has advanced our understanding of how family changes and migration interact in people's lives and how residential context shapes childbearing, migration and health behaviour of individuals. He has published over eighty peer-reviewed articles in international journals and has edited six books or journal special issues.\n\nCurrently, he is leading two collaborative research projects.\n\nThe ERC funded MigrantLife project (2019-2025) investigates life trajectories of immigrants and their descendants in Europe and will project future trends. The FertilityTrends project (2019-2023) is funded by ESRC.\n\nThis project examines recent fertility trends in the UK and improves methodologies for fertility forecasting. Hill is President of the European Association for Population Studies, a Co-Director of the ESRC CPC-Connecting Generations Centre (2022-2027) and a Co-Editor of Population Studies. He is also a member of the Expert Advisory Group on Population and Migration at the Scottish Government.\n\nLast but not least, Hill enjoys teaching population and methods courses at the University of St Andrews and supervising an international team of research fellows and PhD students\n\nCPC-CG Webinar - Gemma Catney (Seminars and lectures)\n\nDr Gemma Catney\n\nZoom\n\nThursday, January 25th 2024\n\n13:00 UK Time\n\nThis CPC-CG Webinar took place on Thursday 25 January at 13:00 UK Time. Gemma Catney, Professor of Human Geography at Queen's University Belfast, presented, \"Geographies of Ethnic Diversity and Inequalities (GEDI): Insights from Census 2021\"\n\nDate: Thursday 25 January 2024\n\nTime: 13:00 - 14:00 UK Time\n\nSpeaker: Dr Gemma Catney, Queen's University Belfast\n\nTitle: Geographies of Ethnic Diversity and Inequalities (GEDI): Insights from Census 2021\n\nAbstract: This seminar will explore the first findings from the Geographies of Ethnic Diversity and Inequalities (GEDI) project, a large ESRC funded project which is providing timely insights from the 2021 Census. The first part of the presentation will focus on the changing geographies of ethnic diversity and segregation in England and Wales, using Census data from 1991 to 2021. The presentation will show how the growth of ethnic diversity at the national level is mirrored across residential neighbourhoods, and that this growing neighbourhood ethnic diversity has been spatially diffusing across all regions of England and Wales. We evidence how increasing ethnic diversity is matched by decreasing residential segregation, for all ethnic groups. The presentation will also explore changes in mixed ethnicity households in England and Wales, and the relationships between mixing within households and neighbourhoods. The final part of the presentation focuses on ethnic inequalities. We introduce a novel ethnic group-specific neighbourhood deprivation index (the EGDI). Most measures of deprivation summarise the aggregate level of deprivation across all people in a given area, and no account is taken of differences between people with differing characteristics, such as age, sex or ethnic group. The EGDI was developed using a custom cross-tabulated 2021 Census dataset on employment, housing tenure, education and health by ethnic group for Lower Layer Super Output Areas. The EGDI reveals the complex geographies of ethnic inequality and demonstrates that while one ethnic group in a neighbourhood may have high relative levels of deprivation, another ethnic group in that same neighbourhood may experience very low relative levels. The EGDI explores ethnic inequalities within and between neighbourhoods and can be used to help shape locally and culturally sensitive policy development and resource allocation. More information about the GEDI project can be found here.\n\nSpeaker: Dr Gemma Catney, Queens University Belfast, is a Population and Social Geographer with research interests in ethnic residential segregation and diversity, ethnic inequalities, and internal migration. Her main research focuses include the changing residential geographies of ethnic and racial diversity, mixing and segregation; socio-spatial inequalities between ethnic groups; and the multiple scales of neighbourhood identity and belonging. She has published widely in leading international journals including Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, Urban Studies and Population, Space and Place.\n\nBerlin Demography Days 2024: Overcoming crises: Shaping policy for an uncertain future (Conferences)\n\nProfessor Jane Falkingham CBE and Professor Hill Kulu\n\nOnline\n\nTuesday, January 23rd 2024\n\nThursday, January 25th 2024\n\nCPC-CG Director, Professor Jane Falkingham CBE and CPC-CG Co-Director Professor Hill Kulu will be speaking at the Population Europe Berlin Demography Days taking place online from 23-25 January 2024.\n\nThe Berlin Demography Days is a forum for different perspectives on current challenges of societal change. It provides a place for stakeholders from science, politics, civil society, business, and the media to come together to discuss the future of our population that will radically change in the next decades.\n\nThe theme of this year's event is Overcoming Crises - Shaping Policy for an Uncertain Future. The discussions are aimed equally at an international audience, decision-makers who are confronted with the challenges of crisis prevention and crisis management, and researchers who contribute evidence.\n\nThe three-day event will be held online - with the exception of the first evening panel, which will take place as a hybrid event both online and in-person.\n\nParticipation is free of charge, however, it is necessary to pre-register. The event will be held in German and English, with simultaneous translation provided. Full information and registration details: https://population-europe.eu/events/berlin-demography-days-berliner-demografie-tage/berlin-demography-days-2024-overcoming\n\nProgramme\n\nEach of the three days focuses on a different facet of the conference topic: Overcoming Crises. The afternoon sessions on each day will consist of one-hour panels (\"Policy Dialogue\"). Each day will conclude with an evening podium discussion (\"Policy Horizon\").\n\nAll times are Central European Time (CET).\n\nDay 1, 23 January 2024, Understanding crisis management\n\nSocietal shocks require rapid and decisive action on one hand, and prudent risk assessment on the other. On the first day, this \"paradox\" of crisis management will be examined using past and present crises as examples. The experts will analyse and discuss the following questions: How can cooperation be improved between actors from politics, civil society, the private sector, academia and the media? How can demographic research support effective crisis management?\n\nAfternoon panels\n\n12:00-12:15: Welcome | Video Greetings from the Organizers\n\n12:15-13:15: Our Successes, Our Failures: COVID-19 Management Put to the Test | Policy Dialogue\n\n13:30-14:30: Will Artificial Intelligence Help Us Better Prepare for Crises? | Policy Dialogue\n\n14:45-15:45: Who Can Cope, Who Can't?

How can such crises best be managed on a regional or local level? What can we learn from each other? When is cooperation across regions and at higher levels necessary, and how can it be made more efficient?\n\nGiven the diversity of decision-making levels and different conditions on the ground, there is no panacea or one-size-fits-all remedy for successful crisis management that can be transferred to other contexts. Rather, a variety of more or less successful and more or less coordinated strategies exists - from the local to the global level. How can we nevertheless learn from each other? To do this, we will focus on one of the following crises in each panel: COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, climate change, and aspects of demographic change. The focus will be on best practice examples of crisis responses at local and regional contexts. Are these responses tailored to individual populations? How transferable are they to other regions and contexts, and what role do political, socioeconomic and cultural factors play in shaping crisis responses?\n\nAfternoon panels\n\n13:00-13:15: Welcome\n\n13:15-14:15: The Pandemic and Access to Information | Policy Dialogue\n\n14:30-15:30: Adapting to Climate Change: Local Role Models | Policy Dialogue\n\n15:45-16:45: We are Aging - Now and Later: Health Care in the Face of Demographic Change | Policy Dialogue\n\nEvening event\n\n17.30-18:30 War and Health | Policy Horizon\n\nDay 3, 25 January 2024, How we can better prepare for crises\n\nGetting ahead of the wave: How can we use population data and demographic research findings to strengthen crisis resilience of society, its institutions and individuals?

And how can we face future crises with a new narrative that motivates us to also see them as opportunities?\n\nAfternoon panels\n\n13:00-13:15 | Welcome\n\n13:15-14:15: Building Back Better: After the \"shock\" and beyond | Policy Dialogue\n\n14:30-15:30: Visionary Institutions for Crisis Prevention | Policy Dialogue\n\n15:45-16:45: Fostering a Future with Intergenerational Solidarity | Policy Dialogue\n\nEvening event\n\n17:00 -18:00 A World Without Crises: is it Possible? | Policy Horizon\n\nWatch Professor Jane Falkingham's presentation here.\n\nLocal population change and policy challenges (Workshops)\n\nThe British Academy and online\n\nMonday, November 6th 2023\n\n14:00-17:00\n\nJoin us in London or online for this policy forum event to discuss the importance of local area demography for policy.\n\nSubmit event feedback\n\nExperts will discuss local population change and the challenges it presents for effective policy, particularly in relation to geographical inequality in the UK, and the resulting levelling-up agenda. Speakers will share the latest knowledge on local population variation and the value of quality data, raising the question of how far individual policies should be tailored to places' particular circumstances, and provide an opportunity for discussion between cross-sector experts. The event will include an open policy forum for questions from attendees, ending with a networking reception.\n\nSpeakers\n\nProfessor Jane Falkingham, Director of the ESRC Centre for Population Change and PI of Connecting Generations, VP International and Engagement, University of Southampton.\n\nProfessor Nicola Shelton, President of the British Society of Population Studies, Head of Health and Social Surveys Research Group, Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL.\n\nProfessor Tony Champion, Emeritus Professor of Population Geography Newcastle University.\n\nThis talk will highlight the complex dynamics of local population change, raising the question of how far individual policies should be tailored to places' particular circumstances. While the population nationally continues to grow, age and diversify, the local dimension presents a much more varied picture which poses a challenge for anticipating future trends and deciding how best to cater for them or possibly try and alter them. Overall change rates range widely, while any particular level of change can result from different combinations of rates of births, deaths and migration superimposed on profiles that differ in terms of gender, age, ethnicity and wealth among other features.\n\nRich Pereira, Deputy Director for Population Statistics and Head of the Centre for Ageing and Demography, Public Policy Analysis, Office for National Statistics.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics produces estimates of the population at the local level. The 'traditional' approach for this relies on a decennial population Census, adjusting annually to account for natural change and migration. This presentation will cover improvements that have been made in the population statistics system since the turn of the century to meet changes in policy information needs and to better reflect changing society. It will also cover the innovative research being carried out to make use of a wider selection of administrative data in population estimation, working with local policymakers, and how ONS is creating striking outputs that really help people understand and make proper use of the evidence provided.\n\nProfessor Grant Hill-Cawthorne, Managing Director of Research and Information and Librarian, House of Commons.\n\nThis presentation will introduce the different ways in which research evidence can impact policy within the UK Parliament and consider what we can all do to increase the degree to which policy is informed by evidence. It will also cover the multiple ways research evidence is used by the UK Parliament, for example, the Libraries use it to answer policy questions and analyse legislation, while the select committees use it as a foundation from which to launch inquiries. In addition, the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology ensures that research evidence is translated into accessible summaries of a body of knowledge for use by parliamentarians.\n\nDiscussions\n\nTrends in local population change\n\nInequality and vulnerable groups\n\nLocal data estimation to support policy\n\nPolicy challenges and opportunities\n\nThis event took place at The British Academy, London, and online via Slido: https://app.sli.do/event/gyseHdV79RNDhVWN6FH9Aa/live/questions\n\nThis event is organised in partnership between the British Society for Population Studies, the ESRC Centre for Population Change and ESRC Connecting Generations.

In the UK, SNPPs are published separately by the constituent countries, each with differing assumptions and variants. In this paper we develop a Bayesian SNFP model for the UK that borrows strength across the local authorities (LAs) within the four countries and appropriately quantifies uncertainty.\n\nAt the UK level, preliminary work has focused on clustering local schedules of age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) to identify groups of LAs with similar fertility patterns across age and year. It appears that around four clusters are required, corresponding to early and later ages of childbearing at varying intensities. The subsequent work on projections has concentrated on Scotland due to the long time series of ASFRs that is available. We apply Generalized Additive Models to estimate smooth effects of age and year which vary with cluster, and also investigate the addition of LA-specific random intercepts and age slopes. We find that in terms of predictive accuracy, our proposed model outperforms a simple extrapolation method as well as naive freezing of the local ASFRs, which are important baselines in the fertility projections literature.\n\nWe will implement this approach within a Bayesian context to obtain well-calibrated measures of uncertainty and to build in expert opinion regarding future national ASFRs. We will compare our SNFPs with existing methods from the literature and official projections for the constituent countries to further assess predictive performance. By unifying the projections for the four UK countries within a probabilistic framework, our proposed SNFP methodology has the potential to improve projection reliability and therefore aid local and national government planners in their decision-making.\n\nCPC-CG Member, Professor Peter Smith, will also be delivering a talk at this conference, entitled \"A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Estimating European Migration Flows\".\n\nAbstract:In many countries, migration patterns are the key determinant of population change. Accurate estimates of place-to-place population migration flows are essential for making population policy estimates or projections. However, there are many difficulties inherent to estimating migration flows: for example, countries may under-report migration, use different migration definitions, or have different data-collection systems.\n\nWe report on work undertaken as part of the Quantifying Migration Scenarios for Better Policy (QuantMig) project, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme. This work has extended the methodology developed in the Integrated Modelling of European Migration (IMEM) project to provide harmonised migration estimates for the flows within the 32-country EU+ system, and flows into and out of Europe, by origin, destination, age and sex, from 2009 to 2019 with a statistical assessment of their uncertainty. Furthermore, the flows have been disaggregated into migrants born in a country in or outside the EU, to enhance their utility to research and policy-making, given the different demographic and migration behaviour of these two groups and the associated channels of migration.\n\nThe estimation utilises a hierarchical Bayesian approach based on the IMEM model. We use migration flow data collated by Eurostat, and incorporate covariate information and information on the effects of undercount, measurement and accuracy of data collection systems. We specify a migration model to relate the true unknown flows to the covariates and a measurement model to relate the observed flows to the true unknown flows, correcting for the inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the observed migration flows.\n\nESRA Conference 2023 (Conferences)\n\nUniversity of Milan-Bicocca\n\nMonday, July 17th 2023\n\nFriday, July 21st 2023\n\nESRA hosts its main conference every two years to bring together applied survey researchers, methodologists and statisticians from Europe and beyond. The conference showcases the latest survey research and offers a number of professional development opportunities, including short courses and awards. It is traditionally hosted in university buildings to keep registration fees to a minimum. ESRA aims to be as inclusive as possible, promoting in particular the participation of doctoral students and early career researchers.\n\nThe ESRA 2023 Conference will take place from 17 July to 21 July at the University of Milan-Bicocca in Milan, Italy. The conference theme is 'Survey research in times of crisis: Challenges, opportunities, and new directions'.\n\nCPC Members Grace Chang, Olga Maslovskaya and Brienna Perelli-Harris will present the paper 'Representativeness of push-to-web Generations and Gender Survey (GGS) in the UK' on 19 July.\n\nAbstract: Using the first ever Generations and Gender (GGS) survey conducted in the UK, this study examines the representativeness of the survey in relation to the UK population, based on the UK Census 2022. The UK GGS is a push-to-web survey that uses a stratified random probability selection of addresses in the UK through postcodes. One of the challenges in the UK for online data collection is the absence of an individual-level sampling frame. We examine whether the UK GGS is representative of the 18 - 59 young adult population in the UK by gender, ethnicity, deprivation and fertility, among other demographic characteristics. Preliminary results for stage 1 of data collection has been conducted recently, but final results will be available by May 2023 when all data are collected for GGS in the UK. UK specific weights will be calculated and will also be used for this analysis. This study seeks to discuss the strengths and challenges with using a push-to-web survey design in the UK, which will provide useful insights for other countries which do not have population registers and desire to move to push-to-web data collection.\n\nVisit the conference website.\n\nTowards a resilient future of Europe (Workshops)\n\nProfessor Jakub Bijak\n\nOnline\n\nTuesday, June 27th 2023\n\n11:00-12:30 CEST\n\nWithin its key funding programme for research and innovation, Horizon Europe, the European Commission is supporting the project Towards a Resilient Future of Europe (FutuRes). The project is taking a close look at the meaning and implications of resilience for ageing populations, with a particular emphasis on life course, social networks and intergenerational links, with implications for policy. This high-level policy expert workshop will be organised around the following key questions:\n\n► What role does resilience play in individuals' life-course, considering the two-way interactions between uncontrollable events and the choices made by individuals?\n\n► What are the impacts of ageing populations on productivity and employment (by gender, sector, occupational group and skills), as well as on investment, economic security, social welfare systems, access to (digital) public services and public finance sustainability over the medium and long terms?\n\n► What is the role of fertility and childbearing decisions in a resilient life-course? How does this connect with family and friendship networks, welfare provision and wellbeing later in life?\n\n► How can migration act as a mitigating factor to ameliorate demographic changes? How can we predict the age structure of the migrant populations, thereby better forecasting the current and future impacts on dependency ratios across European states?\n\nEminent experts and decision-makers from research, politics, business and civil society will discuss these questions. Amongst others, these experts will include:\n\n► Arnstein Aassve | Professor in Demography at Bocconi University, Milan | Coordinator of the FutuRes Project\n\n► Jakub Bijak | Professor of Statistical Demography at the University of Southampton. QuantMig and CPC-CG\n\n► Agnieszka Chłoń-Domińczak | Director of the Institute of Statistics and Demography at WSE, Warsaw\n\n► Marlène de Saussure | Scientific Consultant at the Institute for Innovation and Technology, Berlin\n\n► Alexia Fürnkranz-Prskawetz | Executive Director of the Vienna Institute of Demography\n\n► Elizabeth Gosme | Director of COFACE Families Europe, Brussels\n\n► Philip Haywood | Policy Analyst and Senior Health Economist at the OECD, Paris\n\n► Anna Kwiatkiewicz | Senior Advisor at Business Europe, Brussels\n\n► Marina Manke | Chief of the Global Migration Data Analysis Centre at the IOM, Berlin\n\n►Christian Wehrmann | Senior Consultant at VDI/VDE Innovation + Technik GmbH, Berlin\n\nThe workshop will be followed by a public panel debate Work Better to Work Longer?

There is extensive research documenting a positive association between womens superiority and union dissolution, but several recent studies find that this association has been weakening. Existing studies have focused more on describing this association, but have paid relatively less attention to testing specific explanations. In this study, we use harmonized panel survey data for 29 high-income countries to examine three distinct mechanisms that can drive the association between womens economic superiority and separation risk: gender culture, the anticipation of divorce, and work-family conflict. Our analyses show that the association between womens economic superiority and union dissolution is positive and statistically significant. Contrary to expectations, we do not find evidence that this association is driven by gender culture, and we only find partial evidence about the anticipation of divorce and work-family conflict mechanisms.\n\nSpeaker bio: Allison Dunatchik is a dual PhD candidate in Sociology and Demography at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research interests center on gender, work and family, with a particular focus on how social policies affect gender inequalities inside and outside of the household. Allisons current research explores how gender inequality is produced and reproduced within different-sex couples in the context of changing gender norms and changing family demography across high-income countries. She is also currently working on a project analyzing how the gender division of household labor changes over time following major life course events, such as the transition to parenthood. Prior to attending the University of Pennsylvania, Allison was a policy evaluation analyst at the National Centre for Social Research in London. Allison holds an MPA in Social Policy from the London School of Economics and a BA in Political Science from American University.\n\nAssociated Downloads\n\n/docs/femquant.jpg\n\nCPC-CG Webinar - Kieron Barclay (Seminars and lectures)\n\nKieron Barclay\n\nZoom\n\nThursday, April 27th 2023\n\n13:00 UK Time\n\nThis CPC-CG webinar took place on 27 April 2023. Kieron Barclay of the University of Stockholm gave a talk entitled \"Birth spacing and the health of mothers and fathers: an analysis of physical and mental health using individual- and sibling-fixed effects\".\n\nAbstract: There is a large literature examining the relationship between birth spacing and subsequent health outcomes for parents, and particularly for mothers. However, research on this topic draws almost exclusively on observational research designs, and almost all studies have been limited to adjusting for observable factors that may confound the relationship between birth spacing and health outcomes. In this study we use Norwegian register data to examine the relationship between birth spacing and the number of general practitioner consultations for physical and mental health concerns for both mothers and fathers in both the period immediately after childbirth (1-5 and 6-11 months after the birth), as well as the long-term (10-11 years after the birth). To examine short-term health outcomes, we use individual-level fixed effects - examining only different births to the same parent - to hold constant factors that may influence the birth spacing behavior of mothers and fathers as well as their health. We apply sibling fixed effects in our analysis of long-term outcomes, holding constant the family background of the mothers and fathers that we study. The results from our analyses that do not apply individual or sibling fixed effects yield results consistent with much of the previous literature, where both shorter and longer birth intervals are associated with worse health outcomes than birth intervals approximately 2-3 years long. Estimates from individual fixed effects models suggest that particularly short intervals negatively affect maternal mental health in the short-term, with more ambiguous evidence that particularly short- or long-intervals may influence parental health outcomes in the short- and long-term, though some of these patterns may be consistent with selection processes.\n\nSpeaker: Kieron Barclay is a Pro Futura Scientia XIV Fellow at the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study; as well as an Associate Professor in Sociology at Stockholm University. He is also a Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. His research is in the field of social demography, and he primarily focuses on how family conditions are related to health and mortality, with a particular focus on the interrelationship between health and fertility.\n\nWatch the recording here.\n\nFuture Migration to Europe: Migration projections from international to local levels (Conferences)\n\nOnline and In Person (Green Room, U Residence, Bld General Jacques 271, 1050 Ixelles, Belgium)\n\nWednesday, April 26th 2023\n\nThursday, April 27th 2023\n\n09:00 - 17:30\n\nCPC-CG Members, Professor Jakub Bijak and Dr Valentina Di Iasio, will be speaking at the Future Migration to Europe Conference in Brussels on 26 & 27 April 2023.\n\nThe academic day gathers migration scholars and experts for in-depth discussions on academic challenges and opportunities for forecasting migration.
