        "text": "Overview\n\nCHI 2024 anticipates more than 3,000 Papers submissions. The review process needs to handle this load while also providing high-quality reviews, which requires that each submission is handled by an expert Associate Chair (AC) who can recruit expert reviewers. The organization of the CHI program committee into topical subcommittees helps achieve this. See the description of the Papers review process for a detailed explanation of the responsibilities of the ACs and Subcommittee Chairs (SCs).\n\nAuthors should examine what constitutes a contribution to CHI and recognize that there are many different types of contribution possible for a CHI paper.\n\nNotes on Composition of Subcommittees\n\nOnce abstracts are submitted, individual subcommittees may grow or shrink based on the number of probable papers for that subcommittee. As in previous years, the paper chairs will be undertaking a survey to detail the diversity for each subcommittee. Please see, for example, this blog post on Diversity of the Program Committee for CHI 2020 which was published in July 2019.\n\nAuthors are required to suggest a subcommittee to review your submission. This page provides guidance on choosing the appropriate subcommittees for your submission.\n\nSubcommittee Selection Process\n\nWhen you submit a Paper, you can designate up to two appropriate subcommittees for your submission and we recommend that you indicate two. In the vast majority of cases, the subcommittee that will review your submission is one of the two subcommittees that you proposed. In cases where the Papers Chairs and/or Subcommittee Chairs recognize that your submission will be reviewed more thoroughly in another subcommittee, a submission may be transferred from one subcommittee to another. If a submission is transferred to another subcommittee, this will happen in the first week of the process, before reviewers are assigned; i.e., transferring will not affect a submission’s review process, it will only ensure that it receives the most complete, fair set of reviews.\n\nBelow, you will see a list of subcommittees and descriptions of the topics they are covering, the name of each SC, and the names of the ACs serving on each subcommittee. It is your responsibility to select the subcommittee that best matches the expertise needed to assess your research and that you believe will most fully appreciate your contribution to the field of HCI.\n\nCHI has traditionally supported diverse and interdisciplinary work and continues to expand into new topics not previously explored. We recognize that as a result, you may find more than two subcommittees which are plausible matches for your work. However, for a number of reasons, it will be necessary for you to select no more than two target subcommittees, and you should strive to find the best matches based on what you think is the main contribution of your submission (examples of papers that are considered good matches are linked below for each subcommittee). You can also email the SCs for guidance if you are unsure (an email alias is provided below for each set of SCs).\n\nNote that the scope of each subcommittee is not rigidly defined. Each has a broad mandate, and most subcommittees cover a collection of different topics. Further, SCs and ACs are all seasoned researchers, experienced with program committee review work, and each is committed to a process which seeks to assign each paper reviewers who are true experts in whatever the subject matter of the paper is. ACs recognize that many papers, or perhaps even most papers, will not perfectly fit the definition of their subcommittee’s scope. Consequently, papers will not be penalized or downgraded because they do not align perfectly with a particular subcommittee. Interdisciplinary, multi-topic, and cross-topic papers are encouraged and will be carefully and professionally judged by all subcommittees.\n\nIn making a subcommittee choice you should make careful consideration of what the most central and salient contribution of your work is, even if there are several different contributions. As an example, let’s say you are writing a paper about Ergonomic Business Practices for the Elderly using Novel Input Devices. Perhaps this is a very new topic. It covers a lot of ground. It’s not an exact fit for any of the subcommittees, but several choices are plausible. To choose between them, you need to make a reasoned decision about the core contributions of your work. Should it be evaluated in terms of the usage context for the target user community? The novel methodology developed for your study? The system and interaction techniques you have developed? Each of these evaluation criteria may partially apply, but try to consider which is most central and which you most want to highlight for your readers. Also look at the subcommittees, the people who will serve on them, and the kind of work they have been associated with in the past. Even if there are several subcommittees that could offer fair and expert assessments of this work, go with the one that really fits the most important and novel contributions of your paper. That committee will be in the best position to offer constructive and expert review feedback on the contributions of your research.\n\nEach subcommittee description also links to several recent CHI papers that the SCs feel are good examples of papers that fit the scope of that subcommittee. Please look at these examples as a way to decide on the best subcommittee for your paper – but remember that these are just a few examples, and do not specify the full range of topics that would fit with any subcommittee.\n\nList of the Subcommittees\n\nFind a list of all subcommittees below.\n\nAccessibility and Aging\n\nThis subcommittee is suitable for contributions related to the design or study of technology for people with disabilities and/or older adults. Accessibility papers are those that deal with technology designed for or used by people with disabilities including sensory, motor, mobility, psychosocial or cognitive, intellectual or learning disabilities, or people who identify as neurodivergent. Aging papers are broadly categorized as those dealing with technology designed for or used by people in the later stages of life. Relationships with technology are complex and multifaceted; we welcome contributions across a range of topics aimed at benefiting relevant stakeholder groups and not solely limited to concerns of making technology accessible. Note that if your paper primarily concerns health outcomes or interactions with health data or with healthcare providers, then the Health subcommittee is probably a better fit, whereas papers reflecting on how technologies are used or designed for specific needs are a better fit for this subcommittee. Submissions to this subcommittee will be evaluated, in part, based on how they include and potentially target user groups and other stakeholders. This subcommittee balances the rigor required in all CHI submissions with awareness of the challenges of conducting research in these important areas. This subcommittee welcomes all contributions related to accessibility and aging, including empirical, theoretical, conceptual, methodological, design, and systems contributions.\n\nStrong submissions to this subcommittee will engage, as appropriate, with ongoing dialogues around ethical research praxis regarding representation of people from minoritized populations in the work. For example, papers that rely on data from non-disabled people should consider discussions around so-called “simulation studies” and how to avoid pitfalls of these methods. Your paper should also use inclusive language. Avoid characterizing an entire population using phrases that represent outlier positions for individuals, like “suffering from” (negative) or “inspirational” (positive). When comparing across characteristics or experiences, avoid referring to some people as “normal” implying others are not, or broadly characterizing one group’s experiences as categorically better or worse than others. We also recommend avoiding terms like “vulnerable,” “special needs,” and “X challenged.” We understand there may be exceptions (e.g., medical vision classification systems define a visual acuity as “normal”), but such usage should be footnoted for clarity, and these measures should be relevant to the described work. We expect that authors will review the language in their papers before each submission (initial submission, camera ready), and AC’s, SC’s, and other organizing committee members may request changes to language deemed to be non-inclusive as a condition of acceptance.\n\nSubcommittee Chairs\n\nKristen Shinohara, Rochester Institute of Technology, USA\n\nMingming Fan, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou, China\n\nStacy Branham, University of California, USA\n\nRobin Brewer, University of Michigan, USA\n\nAssociate Chairs\n\nDragan Ahmetovic, Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy\n\nGiulia Barbareschi, Keio University, Japan\n\nErin Brady, Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, USA\n\nDanielle Bragg, Microsoft Research, USA\n\nErin Buehler, Google, USA\n\nPatrick Carrington, Carnegie Mellon University, USA\n\nMichael Crabb, University of Dundee, UK\n\nJiamin (Carrie) Dai, University of British Columbia, Canada\n\nShital Desai, York University, Canada\n\nYao Du, University of Southern California, USA\n\nYasmine N.

Interactive systems combine multiple technical components of hardware, algorithms, human computation, and interaction techniques. Their contributions will be judged by how well they enable and demonstrate novel interactive capabilities. “Enabling” contributions include datasets, tools, libraries, infrastructure, and languages. These contributions will be judged by how well they support the construction, engineering or validation of interactive systems and how well they can be shared among the research community to design future interactive systems.\n\nSubcommittee Chairs\n\n​​Scott Bateman, University of New Brunswick, Canada\n\nAmy Zhang, University of Washington, USA\n\nCarl Gutwin, University of Saskatchewan, Canada\n\nSubcommittee Chair Assistants\n\nConnor Geddes, University of Guelph, Canada\n\nAssociate Chairs\n\n​​Ofra Amir, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Israel\n\n​​Michelle Annett, MishMashMakers, Canada\n\n​​Titus Barik, Apple, USA\n\n​​Andrea Bianchi, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), South Korea\n\n​​Jeffrey P.

Typical papers study or enhance interaction underpinned by, for instance, machine learning, optimization, statistical modeling, natural language processing, control theory, signal processing and computer vision. Beyond simply applying such methods, they seek new ways to describe, predict, and change interaction and guide the design of interactive systems that rely on computational methods or demonstrate applications of such systems. Core contributions typically take the form of novel theories, methods, techniques, and systems for computational approaches in HCI, as well as reports of rigorous empirical studies of interactive systems supported by computational approaches. Contributions will be judged by their rigor, significance, validity, and practical or theoretical impact.\n\nAccepted papers contribute to our understanding of computational methods in human use of computing. The subcommittee is not limited to algorithms but welcomes a broad range of contributions, including but not limited to:\n\nData set or analysis\n\nEmpirical study, including replication studies\n\nMethod\n\nTheory and modeling\n\nDesign\n\nCommentary or essay\n\nAn excellent paper advances knowledge of computational approaches in human-computer interaction. Even in algorithmic contributions, the human viewpoint is central and kept visible throughout. In particular, an excellent paper 1) addresses a well-scoped phenomenon in human use of computers; 2) rigorously introduces and argues for the chosen approach, including assumptions both about humans and the computational approach, as well as differences and similarities with previous work; 3) explicates the claimed contribution in terms of benefit or disadvantage to humans; 4) provides adequate evidence; and 5) offers a balanced discussion of the contribution, including generalizability and limitations. In addition, critical viewpoints and negative findings are welcome. For example, a critical commentary of social implications of machine intelligence, an empirical insight to algorithmic threats, or a failed replication study are valued as contributions in this subcommittee.\n\nSubcommittee Chairs\n\nSven Mayer, LMU Munich, Germany\n\nJohn Williamson, University of Glasgow, UK\n\nSubcommittee Chair Assistants\n\nThomas Weber, LMU Munich, Germany\n\nAssociate Chairs\n\nMihai Bace, KU Leuven, Belgium\n\nMiroslav Bachinski, University of Bergen, Norway\n\nNikola Banovic, University of Michigan, USA\n\nAndreas Bulling, University of Stuttgart, Germany\n\nDaniel Buschek, University of Bayreuth, Germany\n\nMinsuk Chang, Google Research, South Korea\n\nXiang ‘Anthony’ Chen, University of California, Los Angeles, USA\n\nDonald Degraen, Saarland University & German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Germany\n\nAnna Feit, Saarland University, Germany\n\nArthur Fleig, University of Bayreuth, Germany\n\nRebecca Fiebrink, Creative Computing Institute, University of the Arts London, UK\n\nChristoph Gebhardt, ETH Zürich, Switzerland\n\nJulien Gori, CNRS, Sorbonne Université, ISIR, Finland\n\nTakeo Igarashi, The University of Tokyo, Japan\n\nWeiwei Jiang, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China\n\nEnkelejda Kasneci, Technical University of Munich & TUM Center for Education Technologies, Germany\n\nPer Ola Kristensson, University of Cambridge, UK\n\nGierad Laput, Apple, USA\n\nLuis A.

Papers submitted here develop and probe at various concerns, shaping design practice. Contributions include detailed descriptions of and reflections on design processes, interactive products, services, and systems that advance the state of the art; explorations and insights gleaned from working with interactive design materials; suggestions and provocations exploring new design tools, processes, methods, or principles, including those that explore alternatives to scientistic ways of knowing; work that applies perspectives from other disciplines to inspire or to critique the design of interactive things; or work that advances knowledge on the human activity of design as it relates to HCI research or practice. We particularly encourage contributions of new work that engages and builds upon the legacies of design in HCI to broaden the boundaries of interaction design and promote new aesthetic and sociocultural possibilities.\n\nSubcommittee Chairs\n\nLaura Devendorf, University of Colorado Boulder, USA\n\nVasiliki Tsaknaki, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nHeekyoung Jung, University of Cincinnati, USA\n\nDaisy Yoo, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands\n\nSubcommittee Chair Assistants\n\nEldy Lazaro Vasquez, University of Colorado Boulder, USA\n\nDeanna Gelosi, University of Colorado Boulder, USA\n\nAssociate Chairs\n\nTeresa Almeida, ITI/LARSyS, IST – U.

Contributions will be judged based how well a proposed approach solves a significant existing problem or how well it opens new and compelling opportunities for interactions. The novelty of the interaction, its design rationale, and evaluations demonstrating improvements over existing interaction techniques are particularly well suited for this committee.\n\nIf the main contribution of a submission is novel hardware or a fabrication method, we ask authors to submit to the Developing Novel Devices subcommittee instead.\n\nSubcommittee Chairs\n\nDiego Martinez Plasencia, University College London, UK\n\nDavid Lindlbauer, Carnegie Mellon University, USA\n\nSubcommittee Chair Assistants\n\nHyunsung Cho, Carnegie Mellon University, USA\n\nZhouyang Shen, University College London, UK\n\nAssociate Chairs\n\nParastoo Abtahi, Princeton University, USA\n\nKaran Ahuja, Northwestern University, USA\n\nMayra Donaji Barrera Machuca, Dalhousie University, Canada\n\nFrederik Brudy, Autodesk Research, Canada\n\nDebaleena Chattopadhyay, University of Illinois Chicago, USA\n\nAndreas Fender, University of Freiburg, Germany\n\nTiare Feuchtner, University of Konstanz, Germany & Aarhus University, Denmark\n\nMauricio Fontana de Vargas, McGill University, Canada\n\nMike Fraser, University of Bristol, UK\n\nHans Gellersen, Lancaster University, UK & Aarhus University, Denmark\n\nJens Emil Grønbæk, The University of Melbourne, Australia\n\nTovi Grossman, University of Toronto, Canada\n\nJens Grubert, Coburg University, Germany\n\nJan Gugenheimer, TU-Darmstadt, Germany & Télécom Paris, France\n\nAakar Gupta, Fujitsu Research, USA\n\nKhalad Hasan, University of Manitoba, Canada\n\nRyuji Hirayama, University College London, United Kingdom\n\nSteven Houben, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands\n\nPourang Irani, UBC, Canada\n\nSandeep Kaur Kuttal, North Carolina State University, USA\n\nByungjoo Lee, Yonsei University, South Korea\n\nAsier Marzo, Public University of Navarre, Spain\n\nTimothy Merritt, Aalborg University, Denmark\n\nFlorian Müller, LMU Munich, Germany\n\nKen Pfeuffer, Aarhus University, Denmark\n\nDaniel Pires de Sa Medeiros, Télécom Paris & Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France\n\nHasti Seifi, Arizona State University, USA\n\nMarcos Serrano, IRIT – University of Toulouse 3, France\n\nMauricio Sousa, University of Toronto, Canada\n\nHariharan Subramonyam, Stanford University, USA\n\nChi Thanh Vi, International University, VNU-HCM, Vietnam, UK\n\nKashyap Todi, Meta Reality Labs, USA\n\nMadhan Kumar Vasudevan, University College London, United Kingdom\n\nJo Vermeulen, Autodesk Research, Canada\n\nDaniel Vogel, University of Waterloo, Canada\n\nQianwen Wang, University of Minnesota, USA\n\nYuntao Wang, Tsinghua University, China\n\nAndy Wilson, Microsoft Research, USA\n\nWenge Xu, Birmingham City University, United Kingdom\n\nXuhai “Orson” Xu, University of Washington & Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA\n\nShengdong Zhao, National University of Singapore, Singapore\n\nContact: inttech@chi2024.acm.org\n\nExample Papers\n\nObject-Oriented Drawing\n\nVideo Browsing by Direct Manipulation\n\nThe Effect of Visual Appearance on the Performance of Continuous Sliders and Visual Analogue Scales\n\nA Dose of Reality: Overcoming Usability Challenges in VR Head-Mounted Displays\n\nIllumiRoom: Peripheral Projected Illusions for Interactive Experiences\n\nDraco: Bringing Life to Illustrations with Kinetic Textures\n\nVelociTap: Investigating Fast Mobile Text Entry using Sentence-Based Decoding of Touchscreen Keyboard Input\n\nSmart Touch: Improving Touch Accuracy for People with Motor Impairments with Template Matching\n\nImpact of Task on Attentional Tunneling in Handheld Augmented Reality\n\nPinpointing: Precise Head- and Eye-Based Target Selection for Augmented Reality\n\nOne does not simply RSVP: mental workload to select speed reading parameters using electroencephalography\n\nIn-Depth Mouse: Integrating Desktop Mouse into Virtual Reality\n\nDesigning Visuo-Haptic Illusions with Proxies in Virtual Reality: Exploration of Grasp, Movement Trajectory and Object Mass\n\nFeeling colours: Crossmodal correspondences between tangible 3d objects, colours and emotions\n\nSensaBubble: A Chrono-Sensory Mid-Air Display of Sight and Smell\n\nCausality-preserving Asynchronous Reality\n\nInteraction Beyond the Individual\n\nThis subcommittee is suitable for papers that contribute to our understanding of collaborative technologies for groups, organizations, communities, and networks.

Most submissions are empirical in nature, but they can also be conceptual. For empirical papers, the research can use statistical and quantitative, qualitative, or mixed and alternative methods.\n\nSuitable topics for the subcommittee include, but are not limited to: individual behavior, human performance, as well as group, social, and collaborative behaviors and action. Core contributions typically take the form of insightful findings, evolved theories, models, concepts, or methods. Submissions may examine technology practices of diverse populations, and unique, understudied cultural, geographic, and socioeconomic contexts. Contributions will be evaluated for their rigor, significance, originality, validity, and practical or theoretical contributions.\n\nYou can submit directly to an Understanding People split depending on the primary method used. Choosing the appropriate method split will ensure the ACs and reviewers are suitable to evaluate your paper’s methods. The options are:\n\nStatistical and quantitative methods. For example, papers that use experimental manipulations and statistical methods to derive conclusions, or papers that use large datasets and (statistical, analytical) models to derive conclusions.\n\nQualitative methods. Papers whose contributions rest on methods such as interviews, observations, focus groups, diaries, (auto-)ethnography, specific document / content analysis, etc., where the implications of the work may not be generalizable, but add further insights to our understanding of human behavior.\n\nMixed and alternative methods: 1) a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods where the combination of the two approaches is significant; and 2) alternative or novel research methods, such as action research, first-person research, etc.\n\nUnderstanding People — Statistical and Quantitative Methods\n\nSubcommittee Chairs (Statistical and Quantitative Methods)\n\nChris Janssen, Utrecht University, Netherlands\n\nQ Vera Liao, Microsoft Research, Canada\n\nSubcommittee Chair Assistants\n\nFloor Bontje, Utrecht University, Netherlands\n\nTalha Özüdoğru, Utrecht University, Netherlands\n\nAssociate Chairs\n\nSultan A.
