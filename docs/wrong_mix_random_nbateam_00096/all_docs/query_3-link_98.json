        "text": "Brief Biosketch\n\nAdele Diamond, PhD, FRSC is the Canada Research Chair Tier I Professor of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience at University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, BC, Canada. A Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, she has been named one of the 2000 Outstanding Women of the 20th Century, has been listed as one the 15 most influential neuroscientists alive today, and her impact was recently ranked among the top 0.01% of all scientists across all fields. She received her BA from Swarthmore (Phi Beta Kappa), her PhD from Harvard, and was a postdoctoral fellow at Yale Medical School.\n\nProf. Diamond co-founded the field of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience and continues to be recognized as a world leader in both Psychology and Neuroscience as evidenced by her impact, awards, success in research funding, leadership roles, and abundant invitations to speak across disciplines, professions, and nations. She has held federal research grants continuously for over 40 years (since her graduate school days) and overseen over $24 million in research funding. She has given over 600 keynote addresses and invited talks, including at the White House and to the Dalai Lama as well as in 38 countries across 6 continents. Her work has been cited over 58,000 times and has an h-index of 74. She heads the Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Program at UBC, has served on over 25 external advisory boards and 10 editorial boards, including those of all 3 major journals in Developmental Psychology. Her many awards include the Award for Lifetime Contributions to Developmental Psychology in the Service of Science and Society from the American Psychological Association, the International Mind, Brain and Education Societys Translation Award (the highest award that society gives), election to Fellow of the American Psychology Association, Association for Psychological Science, and Society of Experimental Psychologists, as well as honorary doctorates from Swarthmore College and Ben-Gurion University.\n\nProf. Diamonds specialty is executive functions, which depend on the brains prefrontal cortex and interrelated neural regions. Executive functions enable us to resist temptations and automatic impulsive reactions, stay focused, mentally play with ideas, reason, problem-solve, flexibly adjust to changed demands or priorities, and see things from new and different perspectives. Prof. Diamonds lab studies how executive functions are affected by biological factors (such as genes and neurochemistry) and by environmental ones (for example, impaired by stress or improved by interventions).\n\nShe has demonstrated that executive functions emerge and can be assessed as early as the first year of life, and shown that interventions can improve executive functions even in very young children. Her work has demonstrated ways to help children grasp concepts and succeed at tasks long thought beyond their ability and has changed how people think about cognitive development in emphasizing the importance of inhibiting reactions that get in the way of demonstrating knowledge that is already present.\n\nHer work on the unusual properties of the dopamine system in prefrontal cortex led to her identifying the biological mechanism causing executive function deficits in children treated for phenylketonuria (PKU) and definitively documenting those deficits and their effect on the brain, resulting in guidelines for the medical treatment of PKU changing around the globe  an example of how changing behavior (diet) can affect neurochemistry and brain function. Global changes to clinical practice followed two other subsequent discoveries by her. Thus, on three separate occasions her discoveries have led to improvements in the treatment of medical disorders.\n\nMore recently, Prof. Diamond has derived new principles for how to improve executive functions and debunked previously-accepted ones. She offers a markedly different perspective from traditional medical practice in holding that treating physical health, without also addressing social and emotional health is less efficient or efficacious. Prof. Diamond also offers a markedly different perspective from mainstream education and has shown that focusing exclusively on training cognitive skills is less efficient, and ultimately less successful, than also addressing social, emotional, spiritual, and physical needs. She has shown that many issues are not simply education issues or health issues; they are both.\n\nProf. Diamond is also known as an exceptional communicator, both in writing and in speaking, making complicated concepts easily understandable across fields and to the lay public. She has been instrumental in bringing researchers and practitioners together across fields and in jump-starting countless collaborations. One of her many humanitarians projects was recently recognition by the establishment of the \"Adele Diamond Foundation\" in her honor to further efforts to help Maasai children receive a quality education.\n\nResearch Interests\n\nMy lab integrates developmental, cognitive science, neuroscience, and molecular genetic methods to study prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the most complex cognitive abilities ('executive functions' [EFs]) that rely on PFC and interrelated brain regions. EFs include being able to 'think outside the box' and see things from other perspectives (cognitive flexibility), mentally relating different ideas and facts to one another (working memory), and giving a considered response rather than an impulsive one, resisting temptations, and staying focused (inhibitory control, including selective attention). These abilities are crucial for problem-solving, creativity, and reasoning, and for success in all life's aspects.\n\nOne goal of the lab is to examine fundamental questions about how PFC and EFs are influenced by biological factors (such as genes and neurochemistry) and by environmental factors (including detrimental influences such as poverty or stress and facilitative ones such as interventions). For example, the lab examines ways in which unusual properties of PFC dopamine system contribute to the exceptional sensitivity and vulnerability of PFC and EFs to environmental and genetic variations that have little effect elsewhere in the brain, and how at least some of these effects are different in men and women.\n\nOne unusual aspect of the DA system in PFC is a relative dearth of DA transporter proteins, the best way for clearing away released DA. This has many interesting and practical consequences. One of those relates to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We predict, and are testing, that physicians prescribing the correct dose of psychostimulants for controlling hyperactivity in patients with ADHD are prescribing too high a dose for patients cognitive problems. Physicians decide on the optimal psychostimulant dose for a child with ADHD by asking the childs parent how the child is doing on different doses. The parent bases his/her answer on the childs behavior. No one tests the childs cognitive skills.\n\nAnother goal of the lab is to find practical ways to help children develop healthy EFs, and thus to help more children thrive. We offer a markedly different perspective from mainstream education in hypothesizing that focusing exclusively on training cognitive skills is less efficient, and ultimately less successful, than also addressing youths emotional, social, and physical needs. Our hypothesis is that besides training the skill(s) of interest, its important to support those skills by lessening things that impair them and enhancing things that support them.\n\nResearchers and educators tend to focus on one aspect of a person in isolation. For example, efforts to study or to improve cognitive skills (such as EFs) or academic performance are generally done ignoring whether participants are happy or sad, lonely or healthy. Yet sadness, stress, loneliness, or poor health causes ones EF performance to be worse and works against efforts to improve EFs or academic outcomes. Conversely, EFs are better when one feels emotionally and socially nourished and healthy. Social and/or emotional aspects of, or adjuncts to, a program to improve cognitive skills might be key to whether and/or how much that program succeeds.\n\nWe hope our research might fundamentally change the approach and underlying assumptions (i.e., shift the paradigm) of how to improve cognitive skills and how to educate children. We expect to show that focusing exclusively on training cognition might not be the best way to improve cognition; emotional and social factors might be key to whether cognition improves.\n\nTraditional activities that have been part of all cultures throughout time (e.g., dance, music-making, play and sports) address all these aspects of a person -- they challenge our EFs (requiring focus, concentration, and working memory), make us happy and proud, provide a sense of belonging, and help our bodies develop. Recently we have turned our attention to the possible roles of music, dance, storytelling, traditional martial arts, positive sports, yoga, mindfulness, and even circus for improving executive functions, academic outcomes and mental and physical health.\n\n[up] [home]\n\nSignificant Contributions\n\n1. In the 1980s, my work opened up a new field of inquiry, Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, which marked a milestone in the integration of developmental psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience.\n\nDevelopmental psychologists and neuroscientists used to know little of one anothers work. As a graduate student, I realized that for 50 years developmental psychologists and neuroscientists had been using essentially the same behavioral task without knowing it. Developmental psychologists called it A-not-B and used it to study cognitive development in infants; neuroscientists called it delayed response and used it to study the functions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in monkeys.\n\nBuilding on that insight, I undertook a systematic program of research to chart the developmental progression of human infants on A-not-B and delayed response plus a transparent barrier task (to obtain converging evidence from a very different paradigm), the developmental progression of infant monkeys on the 3 tasks, the effect of lesions on adult monkeys' performance of those tasks, and the effect of lesions on infant monkeys' performance of the tasks (see Table below).\n\nBehavioral Tasks:\n\nA-not-B\n\nDelayed Response\n\nObject Retrieval\n\nHuman infants show a clear developmental progression from 7½ -12 months. Diamond, 1985 Diamond & Doar, 1989 Diamond, 1988 Adult monkeys with lesions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex fail. Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1989 Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1989 Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1985 Adult monkeys with lesions of posterior parietal cortex succeed. Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1989 Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1989 Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1985 Adult monkeys with lesions of the hippo-campal formation succeed. Diamond, Zola-Morgan, & Squire, 1989 Squire & Zola-Morgan, 1983 Diamond, Zola-Morgan, & Squire, 1989 Infant monkeys show a clear developmental progression from 1½ -4 months. Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1986 Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1986 Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1986 5-month-old infant monkeys, who received lesions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 4 months, fail. Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1986 Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1986\n\nThis established the first strong link between early cognitive development and the functions of a specific brain region. That gave encouragement to others that rigorous experimental work addressing brain-behavior relations was possible in infants, which people at that time still thought was impossible until my work. It also fundamentally altered the scientific understanding of PFC early in development; clearly it was not silent as accepted wisdom had held. Even though PFC is very immature early in life and takes a very long time to develop, it can already subserve elementary versions of the highest cognitive functions during the first year of life.\n\nI went on to facilitate many of the earliest collaborations between developmental and cognitive scientists, on the one hand, and neuroscientists on the other beginning with the landmark conference I organized in 1989 (Development and Neural Bases of Higher Cognitive Functions) that brought together developmental scientists, cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists, using observable behaviors they were assessing in common paradigms to bridge the communication gap between disciplines. The NYAS volume that resulted from that meeting was so popular, it sold out in record time. The conference birthed over a half dozen new collaborations -- the earliest collaborations between developmental and cognitive scientists, on the one hand, and neuroscientists on the other. Throughout my career up to the present, I have actively connected people to one another and facilitated countless scientific collaborations and friendships.\n\n2. In the 1990s, my team made two discoveries that led to worldwide improvements in the medical treatment for phenylketonuria (PKU), improving the lives of thousands of children. I identified the biological mechanism causing EF deficits in children treated for PKU. I provided the first demonstration of a visual deficit in treated PKU children (which changed international guidelines for the age of treatment onset).\n\nsee: www.apa.org/research/action/pku.aspx\n\nAfter demonstrating that maturation of PFC played a role in early cognitive development, a natural next question was, Whats changing in PFC to make these cognitive advances possible? I hypothesized that at least part of the answer was increasing levels of dopamine in PFC. But how to study the role of dopamine in modulating PFC cognitive functions (executive functions [EFs]) in humans early in life? No one had ever done anything like that. Again, the answer lay in integrating two fields. Researchers and clinicians working on inborn errors of metabolism had noticed that children well-treated for phenylketonuria (PKU) seemed to show selective EF deficits, but no one could imagine a mechanism that could explain that, so reports of such deficits were largely ignored. Neuropharmacologists studying the mesocortical dopamine system in rats had shown that if there is only a modest reduction in the dopamine precursor, tyrosine, PFC is selectively affected. I realized that the latter might provide a mechanism to account for the former because children well-treated for PKU typically had slightly elevated blood levels of phenylalanine (Phe) and slightly reduced blood levels of tyrosine. Since Phe and tyrosine compete to enter the brain, a modest elevation in the Phe to tyrosine ratio in blood would result in a modest reduction in the amount of tyrosine reaching the brain  a reduction sufficient to impact PFC but too small to impact other brain regions.\n\nTo test that hypothesis, I again turned to work in both humans and animals. My team combine (a) neurochemical work in animals -- creating the first animal model of treated PKU along the way (Diamond et al., 1994) and the first genetic animal model of treated PKU (Zagreda et al., 1999) -- with (b) longitudinal testing of 5 groups (those with PKU, those with a related disorder [hyperphenyla-laninemia], siblings of the PKU patients, matched controls, and infants and children from the general population) at each of 3 age ranges (infants, toddlers, and children) using an extensive neurocognitive battery (Diamond et al., 1997). My team was thereby able to demonstrate the mechanism causing the deficits that had so confounded those working on inborn errors of metabolism and the team demonstrated how those deficits could be prevented. While the longitudinal study documented the extent and nature of the cognitive deficits and the levels of Phe and tyrosine associated with them, the animal models tested the hypothesized neural mechanism underlying the cognitive deficits (i.e., slightly too little tyrosine reaching the brain, which lowered DA levels in PFC but not in other brain regions because of unusual properties of the DA system in PFC [faster firing rate & faster DA turnover]). Diamonds team, thus, showed definitively that the then-accepted treatment for PKU left EF deficits, discovered the causal mechanism, and demonstrated what to do about the problem. The medical community swiftly acted on these findings, changing the guidelines around the world for the treatment of PKU.\n\nMidway through, I learned that the dopamine system in the retina shares the same unusual properties as those that cause PFC to be sensitive to reductions in available tyrosine too small to affect other brain regions. To be consistent, I had to predict that retinal function would also be adversely impacted in children treated for PKU, so I ventured into vision science to investigate that together with pediatric optometrist, Dr. Chaya Herzberg. Sure enough, my team identified the first visual deficit reported in children treated for PKU  impaired contrast sensitivity. Two superficially unrelated behavioral effects (a selective cognitive deficit and a selective visual deficit) were found to have same underlying cause.\n\nDiamond, A. (2001).

An animal model of early-treated PKU. Journal of Neuroscience, 14, 3072-3082\n\nMy team had found converging evidence from two very different domains, vision and cognition, in support of my hypothesis about the mechanism causing cognitive deficits in PKU children when their Phe levels were maintained at what had been thought to be safe levels (3-5 times normal; 360-600 μmol/L). One discrepancy troubled me, however. PFC cognitive deficits were closely related to childrens current levels of Phe. The visual deficits were not. The deficit in contrast sensitivity was closely related to what the childrens Phe levels had been during the first month of life.\n\nBy the time my team studied contrast sensitivity, we knew what range of Phe levels produced a deficit and so only sampled from within that range. Having a truncated range of current Phe levels could easily have accounted for the failure to find a relation between contrast sensitivity and current Phe levels. However, a child born with PKU is usually not started on treatment for the disorder until about 10 days of age. The visual system is maturing very rapidly during the days and weeks right after birth. Perhaps the excessively high levels of Phe reaching the brain during those first days after birth impairs the visual system.\n\nTo test that hypothesis I brought in pairs of siblings, both of whom had PKU, as well as children from the general population. The importance of the sibling pairs was that while PKU in the first child born with the disorder is not detected until the heel prick test after birth, amniocentesis is performed for all later-born children and so it is known if any of those children have PKU before birth. The first-born children started dietary treatment on average at 11 days of age, while the later-born children started the diet on average at 3 days of age. I found consistently that the first PKU sibling in a family had poorer contrast sensitivity at low levels of contrast than his or her younger PKU sibling and than children from the general population. The children whose brains were exposed to massive levels of Phe for the first 10 days of life showed no deficits in visual acuity or in determining form from texture, but they were impaired in contrast sensitivity at very low levels of contrast and in determining form from motion. These deficits were evident over 10 years later when we tested the children. This is in striking parallel to the findings of Daphne Maurer and Terri Lewis who have found that children exposed to very degraded visual input for only the first few weeks after birth (children born with congenital cataracts who received surgery to correct their eyesight within the first month of life). There is still a role for current Phe levels in the contrast sensitivity deficit of PKU children, as high Phe levels during the first 10 days of age are related to deficits only at very low contrast, but PKU children have impaired contrast sensitivity across all spatial frequencies and levels of contrast. Both neonatal and current Phe levels appear to matter.\n\nMy presentation of these data at the NIH Consensus Conference on PKU, led to the new recommendation for US national health policy. Based on this presentation, US national guidelines for when dietary treatment for PKU should begin changed from by 14-21 days of age to as soon as possible, and no later than 7-10 days after birth.\n\nDiamond, A. (2000). Recent research findings on the effects of age at diet initiation on the visual system. Invited presentation at the NIH Consensus Development Conference on Phenylketonuria (PKU): Screening and Management, Bethesda, MD, 16 October 2000.\n\nDiamond, A. (2007). Consequences of variations in genes that affect dopamine in prefrontal cortex. Cerebral Cortex, 17, 161-170.\n\nFrom 2000 to the present, I had continued to extend our understanding to how the unusual properties of prefrontal DA system contribute to PFCs vulnerability to environmental and genetic variations that have little effect elsewhere. One such discovery again changed medical practice:\n\n3. An unusual property of the DA system in PFC is a relative dearth of dopamine transporter protein. Dopamine transporter is abundant in the striatum but sparse in PFC. When you hear that stimulants like methylphenidate (MPH) aid ADHD by inhibiting reuptake, that is referring to inhibiting reuptake of DA by dopamine transporter proteins on presynaptic neurons. Clearly the mechanism by which stimulants remediate the cognitive deficits (the EF deficits) in ADHD had to be different.\n\nI demonstrated that ADHD without hyperactivity (ADHD-inattentive) is a fundamentally different disorder from the other forms of ADHD, which include hyperactivity. They differ in genetic and neural bases, cognitive profiles, responses to medication, and patterns of comorbidity. That demonstration resonated deeply, impacting clinical practice. Websites on ADHD-inattentive soared from 4 to 1,000s. The Founder and Head of the Dutch ADD Assoc. (Stichting ADD Nederland), Karin Windt, wrote: Dr. Diamond changed millions of lives . For the first time [those of us with the primarily inattentive form of ADHD] were heard and finally understood . Through my work we are now able to explain to others why ADD is so different from ADHD. This question remained unanswered until my article appeared in 2005.\n\nBased on the neurobiology, I next hypothesized that most children with ADHD are being over-medicated for optimal cognitive (EF) results. ADHD involves lower levels of DA in PFC and the striatum. PFC is most linked to cognitive deficits in ADHD and the striatum to behavioral problems. At the moderate-to-high doses often prescribed for ADHD, MPH inhibits re-uptake of DA by dopamine transporters, which primarily affects the striatum, where dopamine transporter protein is plentiful. Recent neuroscience findings, however, show MPH acts differently at low doses; at low doses it increases DA specifically in PFC.\n\nMost ADHD patients on MPH are getting a dose targeting their behavioral dysregulation (parents base feedback to doctors on the childs behavior; no one uses cognitive tests to determine dose). I hypothesized that the MPH dose for controlling hyperactivity in patients with ADHD is too high for aiding patients cognition. I predicted that ADHD patients would perform better on EF tests of attention and working memory, and tests of reading and math, when on half their dose. Indeed, my lab has largely confirmed that prediction in a double-blind crossover design. This has the strong potential to change the standard of care for ADHD.\n\nHalf of the ADHD patients (ages 6-18) have been tested first in the my lab on their current MPH dose and in their second session on half that; half the patients were tested on half their current dose first (order counter-balanced). Neither researchers nor patients knew who received which dose when (double blind). A pharmacy prepared identical-looking capsules of the childs current dose and half that.\n\nLing, D.

Also in the 2000s, my team made discoveries that are refining our understanding PFC DA system and the catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) gene:\n\nScientific results are rarely perfectly neat and clean. It is true that children with PKU whose Phe levels were mildly elevated were impaired on all six of the tasks that required working memory and inhibitory control, but they performed well on three other tasks that also tax working memory (two self-ordered pointing tasks and a temporal order memory task). Theres solid evidence that those tasks also depend on dorsolateral PFC. I had predicted that performance on all tasks dependent on dorsolateral PFC would be impaired in PKU children with mildly elevated Phe levels. Why on earth were they not impaired on these three tasks? I hadnt a clue. But again I was unwilling to let the inconsistency remain uninvestigated.\n\nAn opportunity arose to test whether self-ordered pointing was really insensitive to variations in PFC DA levels. The best way to clear released DA is with the dopamine transporter protein. PFC is unusual in having a relative dearth of dopamine transporter. Unlike other brain regions, PFC has to rely on the COMT enzyme to clear DA. For persons of European origin, they are as likely to have a version of the COMT gene that codes for a fast-acting COMT enzyme, leaving less DA in PFC (i.e., valine [Val] at codon 158) as they are to have a version of the COMT gene that codes for a sluggish COMT enzyme, leaving more DA around longer in PFC (i.e., methionine [Met] at codon 158). Thus, I predicted that COMT genotype would affect performance on tasks requiring working memory and inhibitory control (like my Hearts and Flowers task) but would not affect self-ordered pointing performance. To investigate this, I needed to add techniques in molecular genetics to my arsenal. The results confirmed my prediction that while self-ordered pointing depends on PFC, it is not sensitive to the level of DA in PFC. These results challenged accepted notions that since DA is important for some PFC-dependent cognitive functions, it is important for all. The differential sensitivity of distinct cognitive abilities to specific neurotransmitters opens up possibilities for targeted pharmacological interventions.\n\nMy team obtained the first evidence of the relation of polymorphisms of the COMT gene to EF performance in children, providing an existence proof that differences in genotype can be related to differences in cognition in normal children.\n\nMore recently, my team obtained the first evidence of the much-predicted double dissociation between the effect of stress on cognitive skills (EFs) dependent on PFC by COMT genotype. Many have predicted that mild stress, by raising PFC DA levels, should aid EFs of COMT-Vals (bringing their PFC DA levels up, closer to optimal) and impair EFs of COMT-Mets (raising their PFC DA levels past optimal). My team tested 140 men and women in a within-subject crossover design using extremely mild social evaluative stress. On trials requiring EFs (incongruent trials) of the Flanker/Reverse Flanker task, COMT-Val158 homozygotes performed better when mildly stressed than when calmer, while COMT-Met158 carriers performed worse when mildly stressed. Two other teams previously tried to obtain this, but only found stress impairing EFs of COMT-Mets, not improving EFs of COMT-Vals. It seems my team found both because we used a much milder stressor. That work shows that the bandwidth for stress having a facilitative effect on EFs is exceedingly narrow.\n\nMy team pioneered evidence of a sex difference in which polymorphism of the COMT gene is more beneficial for EFs. Estrogen down-regulates COMT gene transcription; the COMT enzyme is 30% less active in women than men (a less active COMT enzyme clears DA more slowly, leaving more DA around longer in PFC). I and my team have hypothesized that women have higher baseline levels of DA in PFC (a more optimum level) and males. That would be consistent with disorders of too little DA in PFC (e.g., ADHD) being more common in males and disorders of too much DA in PFC (e.g., anxiety and depression) being more common in females. With estrogen resulting in a slower COMT enzyme, further slowing of the enzyme by the COMT gene polymorphism with methionine at codon 158 could result in too much DA in PFC (too much or too little DA in PFC impairs EFs). Indeed, my team, led by graduate student Jeanette Evans, found that the COMT gene variant usually associated with better EFs for men (COMT-Met158) is not the variant associated with better EFs for women, at least when their estrogen levels are high (instead COMT-Val158 is).\n\nMy team was also the first to demonstrate that the COMT gene variant most beneficial for EFs varies with the menstrual cycle. Since the sex difference is estrogen-mediated, which variant of the COMT gene is most beneficial for women varies with the menstrual cycle. Within genotype, half the women were tested first when their estrogen levels were high (midluteal menstrual phase) and then when their estrogen levels were low (follicular phase), and half with the reverse order. Men were tested at comparable intervals. As predicted, when estrogen levels were high, women homozygous for the Val version of COMT showed better EF than females homozygous for Met; men showed the standard result (better EF with the Met-Met version of COMT). During the menstrual phase when estrogen levels are low, females showed the male pattern of better EF by those with the Met-Met COMT genotype.\n\nThis led to their most recent finding, which is that the classic Yerkes-Dodson curve that describes performance on any difficult cognitive task as being better under slight stress than when calm is not true of women when their estradiol levels are elevated. (Women, it seems, dont need stress to perform optimally.) This is consistent with many men often needing to put themselves under pressure (e.g., by procrastinating) or get themselves in dangerous or risky situations to perform at their best.\n\nZareyan, S., Zhang, H., Wang, J., Song, W., Hampson, E., Abbott, D., & Diamond, A.

For example, it is not possible to say which genotype of the COMT gene or the serotonin-regulatory gene (SLC6A4) is associated with better EFs without taking into account environmental factors (stress in the case of COMT and mothers mood in the case of SLC6A4). The COMT gene with methionine at codon 158 is associated with better EFs at baseline, but worse EFs in the face of stress. While the version of the COMT gene with valine at codon 158 is usually associated with not-as-good EFs at baseline, persons with this genotype are better able to tolerate stress and so show better EFs than COMT-Mets under stressful conditions.\n\nThe EFs of children with at least one short allele of the SLC6A4 gene look fine even if the childs mom reports many depressive symptoms (i.e., like COMT-Vals, they show resilience and relative insensitivity to environmental risk). The EFs of children with two long forms of the SLC6A4 gene, on the other hand, are very affected by mothers mood. If their mom is sadder, these children display worse EFs than any other group; but if their mom is happier, these childrens EFs are better than any group. Thus, given a sadder mother, children with one or more short allele of the SLC6A4 gene show the best EFs, but given a mom who is not sad, children with two long alleles of the gene show the best EFs. It is not possible to say which genotype of either gene (COMT or SLC6A4) is the best for EFs without also taking into account environmental factors.\n\nZareyan, S., Zhang, H., Wang, J., Song, W., Hampson, E., Abbott, D., & Diamond, A.

My team has obtained findings with direct and important implications for education. The Diamond et al. (2007) Science paper, showing that the early childhood school curriculum, Tools of the Mind, improves childrens executive functions (EFs) and that the better childrens EFs the better their performance on standardized academic measures, ignited worldwide interest in intervening early to improve EFs by researchers, educators, and funders by showing its possible to improve the EFs of 4-5 year-olds (many had thought that too early).\n\nDiamond et al. (2007) was the first study to show that EFs can be improved in regular public-school classes (without expensive, highly technical equipment, 1:1 attention, or specialists) and that play seems critical. It indicated that play may aid academic goals instead of taking time away from achieving them. Indeed, stronger results were found than in computerized training studies with young children. If throughout the school-day EFs were supported and progressively challenged, benefits generalized and transferred to new activities, different from anything the children had ever done before. Daily EF exercise may then aid EF development and mental health, much as physical exercise improves our bodies and our physical health.\n\nJames Griffin, Chief of the Child Development and Behavior Branch of NICHD, pronounced at a conference that the Diamond et al. (2007) study was responsible for an explosion of interest by funders and researchers in the possibility of intervening early to improve EFs to head off mental health problems and school failure and to give children a better chance in life. Indeed, the study has affected early education worldwide. As a direct result of that study, 4 countries (Chile, Ecuador, Indonesia, Peru), the Ktunaxa First Nation, and 3 US states (AZ, MD, WA) have started to reform their early education systems.\n\nThat first study was small (only 3 schools, 147 children). I followed that up with the first randomized control trial of Tools in Canada (Diamond et al., 2019). Though both groups of kindergarten children were comparable in the Fall, by Spring those in Tools exceeded control children in reading, writing, EFs, joy in coming to school, and instances of helping and being kind to others. Tools classes reported less bullying, refusals to be paired with another child, and stress. Tools teachers reported less burnout and more enthusiasm for teaching in the Spring than control teachers, though enthusiasm had been comparable in the Fall. The results were markedly better than the same teachers obtained the year before Tools started and than closely-matched comparison teachers had in the same year.\n\nI and my colleagues again used random assignment to investigate outcomes among 4th and 5th graders of an elementary school program (MindUp) that involves mindfulness and caring for others (social responsibility). Children who received training in mindfulness plus social-responsibility (1) improved more in mindfulness, EFs, stress regulation, empathy, optimism, & emotional control, (2) tended to have better math grades & less school absenteeism, (3) showed greater decreases in depression and aggression, and (4) were rated by peers as more trustworthy, kind, and helpful than children who received only the regular social-responsibility curriculum.\n\nDiamond, A., Lee, C., Senften, P., Lam, A., & Abbott, D.

My team has demonstrated ways to help children grasp concepts and succeed at tasks long thought beyond their ability. Each demonstration was theoretically motivated and involved either a novel application of a familiar theory or tested a new theoretical conceptualization. All the methods theyve piloted have been simple enough for parents and teachers to use, & have proven especially useful for those working with children with learning difficulties. Sometimes a child who cannot grasp something when it is taught one way can readily grasp it when it is presented a different way (thus educators should be wary about giving up and need to have faith in the potential of each child to succeed).\n\nFor example, my team cut by more than half the age at which infants can demonstrate the ability to deduce abstract rules with important implications for improving outcomes for children with autism. In doing so, they demonstrated that spatial and temporal proximity are less important than a physical connection between stimulus and reward. While most people had thought that infants could not succeed at the delayed nonmatching to sample (DNMS) task because of a maturing memory ability, I and my colleagues showed that the critical late-maturing competence required for infants success on DNMS is the ability to grasp the relation between stimulus and reward when there is no obvious physical connection between them (Diamond, Churchland et al. 1999; Diamond, Lee, & Hayden 2003; Diamond 2006).\n\nOn each DNMS trial, a new sample object is presented; the subject displaces it to retrieve a reward. After a delay, the sample and a novel object are presented; choice of the novel object is always rewarded. Hence, the subject needs to deduce the rule to always go to the new (non-matching) object. Children generally do not succeed at DNMS, even with delays of only 5 or 10 sec, until they are almost 2 years old (~20-21 months). In a Velcro condition, I and my colleagues attached the reward (still a separate object in its own right) to the base of the stimulus. The stimuli were still presented atop wells, and the rewards were still out-of-sight in the wells, but instead of the reward remaining in the well when a stimulus was displaced, the reward moved with the stimulus. In this condition, where the rewards were physically connected to (though detachable from) the stimuli, most infants of 9 or 12 months succeeded at the 5-sec training delay and continued to perform comparably at the longer delay (30 sec). Thus, when the reward and stimulus were physically connected, the task was easy for infants.\n\nI hypothesized that children with autism might have a similar problem in grasping the conceptual connections between physically unconnected things. I predicted that by physically connecting items that are meant to be conceptually connected, some children with autism would be able to grasp concepts and understand connections that had eluded them. Thus, I hypothesis was that children with autism (even preschoolers with mild developmental delays) are capable of deducing abstract rules (such as same or different) if there is a direct, physical connection between stimuli and rewards. Most behavioral training with children with autism or developmental delays has not considered whether it matters if cue and referent are physically connected. It would be wonderful if making such a simple change could enable these children to grasp concepts previously thought to be beyond their ability.\n\nMy team found, as predicted, that about twice as many children with autism succeed in the Velcro (physically attached) condition as in the standard DNMS condition. Further, if children are primed with pretest trials where no reward objects are used (as in Diamond, 1995), children with autism consistently pick the novel object on those pretest trials and then go on to succeed at the standard DNMS protocol where they are again always to pick the novel object.\n\nMore recently, I and my colleagues cut by over a year, the age at which children can demonstrate (a) conditional reasoning and (b) the ability to switch sorting criteria (Diamond et al., 1999; Ling et al., 2021). They did that by integrating color and shape in the stimuli for the former and separating color and shape in the stimuli for the latter, in both cases perceptually bootstrapping the relevant cognitive competence.\n\nLing, D.

Cognitive Development, 4, 223-249.\n\n8. My work has fundamentally changed the way people think about cognitive development. My awakened interest in the role of inhibitory control in development by the seminal discovery that cognitive development proceeds not only by acquiring new skills and knowledge but also by the increasing ability to inhibit habitual or reflexive reactions that get in the way of demonstrating what is already known. It is not enough to know the right thing to do, you must do it, and sometimes an inability to inhibit inappropriate reactions gets in the way. It had been widely assumed, until my work, that naturally if you knew what you should do you would do it. I demonstrated that between knowing the correct response and implementing it, another step, long ignored, is often required. When a strong competing response is present, inhibition of that response is needed. I demonstrated that the biggest challenge for young children is not recall or recognition memory (theyre excellent at that) but inhibiting prepotent responses.\n\nI and my colleagues went on to refine understanding of how responses become prepotent and how response prepotency is overcome. For example, when required to inhibit a dominant response, young children can succeed when they take their time or when some way can be found to cause them to delay responding for just a few seconds. Does that help because children need that additional time to compute the thoughtful response or does that help simply because the incorrect dominant response needs time to passively decay? Simpson et al. (2012) definitively demonstrated it is the latter.\n\nI had also elucidated how the characteristics of EF skills differ in children and adults on the one hand (Davidson et al., 2006), and, on the other hand, that EF errors typical of children are still present in adults, it is simply those errors are more subtle in adults (Diamond & Kirkham, 2005). Researchers have known since at least 1995 that while inhibiting a prepotent response is demanding, if that is required on all trials of a block, adults are as fast and as accurate at that as on the corresponding block where the prepotent response is correct on every trial. My team found this is not true of children. Children from 6 years of age through their teens are slower and less accurate on the block demanding inhibition on every trial (Davidson et al., 2006). Thus, just increasing demands on inhibitory control, without any additional demands on working memory or cognitive flexibility, takes a toll on childrens EF performance that is completely absent in adults. Indeed, increasing demands on inhibitory control is more difficult for young children (ages 4-9 years) than increasing demands on how much information they must hold in mind from two items to six. The opposite is true for adults.\n\nPeople tend to think of cognition as higher and later-maturing and of motor as lower and earlier-maturing. However, motor development shows as long a period of development as cognitive skills. In 2000, I published a seminal paper on close interrelations between the cerebellum and PFC and between motor development and cognitive development. I had demonstrated that sometimes the motor skills are the limiting factors and the later to mature, rather than the cognitive skills. Often a cognitive ability has assumed to be lacking based on task performance, but it has turned out that the motor requirements of the task caused the problem rather than the cognitive ability not being present (e.g., Diamond & Gilbert, 1989; Diamond & Lee, 2000). People had not realized until my work that motor development and cognitive development, far from being independent, are fundamentally intertwined. My work served to build bridges between two fields that had rarely talked, cognitive science and kinesiology.\n\nWright, A. & Diamond, A. (2014).

The reviews by me and my colleagues of which programs and interventions have been shown to improve EFs have revolutionized thinking about how to best improve EFs.\n\nDiamond & Ling (2020) is the first review to look at ALL the different methods employed to improve executive functions (not just cognitive training approaches, or just physical exercise approaches, but all methods tried thus far) and at ALL ages (not just in children or just in the elderly). To almost everyones great surprise, we found that a little-studied approach  Mindful Movement practices (such as taekwondo and tai chi)  shows by far the best results for improving EFs at all ages. Promising school programs come in second. Both approaches show better results than any Cognitive Training. Third best at improving EFs is non-computerized cognitive training. Might these three approaches show better results than any computerized training because they involve more in-person interaction between trainer and trainee? Despite many claims that aerobic-exercise improves EFs, we found that resistance-training interventions and aerobic-exercise interventions are the least effective at improving EFs. That probably reflects how physical-activity interventions have been structured rather than that physical activity does not benefit EFs.\n\nBased on these reviews, I derived several general principles concerning to how to improve EFs, such as: (a) EF training transfers, but the transfer is very narrow. People improve on the skills they practice and that transfers to other contexts where those same skills are needed, but people only improve on what they practice. To get diverse benefits, diverse skills must be practiced. (b) Those with initially poorest EFs consistently benefit the most (not due to ceiling effects or regression to the mean). Thus early EF training might be an excellent candidate for reducing inequality (because it should improve the EFs of the most needy children most). (c) Whether EF gains are seen depends on the way an activity is done. Thus it is critical to look at what actually happens in a program; programs nominally the same can obtain markedly different results because of how the programs were delivered. I predict that the way an activity is done, such as trainers ability to make the activity enjoyable and to communicate their unwavering faith in participants and the program, whether the activity is personally meaningful and relevant to the participants, inspiring a deep commitment and emotional investment to the activity and to one another, will likely prove more decisive than what the activity is.\n\nDiamond, A. & Ling, D.

I had deepened our understanding of interrelations between social and emotional functioning and EFs. Since 2000, I have shown that nowhere is the importance of social, emotional, and physical health for cognitive health more evident than with PFC and EFs, and that focusing exclusively on training cognitive skills is less efficient, and ultimately less successful, than also addressing emotion-al, social, and physical needs. While training and challenging EFs is needed for them to improve, indirectly supporting EFs by lessening things that impair them (like stress and sadness) and enhancing things that support them (like social support and physical vitality) is also critical. Most researchers studying how to improve EFs have focused almost exclusively on directly training EFs (or improving aerobic fitness to improve EFs), ignoring powerful emotional and social factors that affect EFs.\n\nMuch of my work has focused on the detrimental effects of stress, even mild stress, on EFs (e.g., Zareyan et al., 2021). Being stressed because youre worried about what others might think of you (social evaluative stress) or might think of your performance (performance anxiety) is not beneficial for EFs of most people, and for the those for whom a benefit can be found, the stress must be exceedingly mild. Diamond and Ling (2019a) found that by far the most efficacious approach to improving EFs is mindfulness that involves movement (e.g., tai chi and taekwondo). That is likely because of the role of mindful movement in reducing how stressed or anxious a person feels. Second in efficacy are (a) school programs that build community and reduce stress and (b) more sedentary mindfulness practices, which also reduces stress.\n\nZareyan, S., Zhang, H., Wang, J., Song, W., Hampson, E., Abbott, D., & Diamond, A.

The international translational conference series (called Brain Development and Learning) that I created in 2006 and continued to organize and host for 7 more years was deeply significant in educating the public about scientific findings and providing evidence to help people make informed decisions in caring for children. The series clearly tapped an important need. People found these conferences extremely valuable (most said the very best conference they had ever attended) and folks came from ALL over BC, every Canadian province and territory (except PEI), almost half of the US states, and scores of other countries, including 15-20 First Nations.\n\n(see: http://braindevelopmentandlearning.com/BDL2013/locations_2013.html )\n\nThe purpose of the conference series was to be of service to the community -- to highlight successful, innovative programs and present important scientific findings in neuroscience, child development, and mental health in ways that parents, doctors, teachers, social workers, and others could understand, see the immediate relevance of, and USE. It had a ripple effect, as those attending the meeting brought what they learned back to their communities and organizations and educated others.\n\nThese were not your typical scientific conferences, where scientists talk to scientists. I set a tone where learning went in both directions, not just from speakers to audience. The conferences were beloved in part because of their feel - a comfortable, grounded, relaxed atmosphere of mutual respect and feeling of community. One of the best aspects of the conferences was the informal interactions between presenters and conference attendees.\n\nComments from participants included: This conference is better than the best that I can imagine. The speakers are exceptional, the organization of the conference is supreme, the spirit of the whole conference is great; this is the best conference I ever attended. Attendance doubled in 2008 and doubled again in 2010; 99% of the 755 attendees at the 4th conference in 2013 rated it outstanding (as did 99% of the 638 attendees of the prior conference in this series)! Many attendees said the conferences are life-changing.\n\nI worked very hard with potential applicants from Third World countries to obtain a Canadian visitor visa so that they can attend. In the 2013 conference, 11 of the 12 people I helped were able to obtain visas. People from over 30 countries attended. My greatest success was making it possible for the only child and adolescent psychiatrist in Gaza, Dr. Sami Owaida, MD, to attend.

I have never seen any effort work as well as what you put together in Vancouver.\n\nI like the way it used basic science research to speak to clinical practice (I am a child psychiatrist).\n\nAs a teacher of special ed at the elementary level (age 4-14) for 30 years, I found this conference to be wonderful! Awesome organization! Awesome program! Helpful friendly people! A wonderful experience!!\"\n\nI spoke with many professionals who work with children in complementary ways to what I do; this isnt something I normally have an opportunity to do. Talking to and hearing from researchers directly is a way to narrow or collapse the time lag between research and implementation in the classroom. Very exciting for both sides.\n\nSample feedback on the 2008 meeting: braindevelopmentandlearning.com/oldbdl2008/bdl2008.html\n\nI think you guys may very well have achieved best practice in conference organization!\n\nExtremely well organized with attention to detail. Very friendly and welcoming.\n\nAs a Special Education Coordinator for my school board I can assure you that the information I received will be shared throughout the district - ripples in a pond.\n\nSample feedback on the 2010 meeting: braindevelopmentandlearning.com/oldbdl2010/bdl2010.htmlml\n\nHow powerful an experience it was! I came away charged up with renewed energy.\n\nCME doesnt get any better.\n\nOutstanding speakers! Outstanding organization! New research presented in clear, elegant and exciting manner. One of the most enjoyable conferences Ive attended.\n\nYou brought together classroom teachers, researchers, clinicians, nurses, etc. That mix rarely happens.\n\nThanks for one the best conference I have ever attended - it was inspiring. I came away with new ideas to work on and things to put directly into my pediatric practice.\n\nThis is an important conference that has vital information to inform public policy. This has been a tremendous learning experience. I have learned a lot and can leave with excellent resources.\n\nThank you for creating so many possibilities for collaboration and learning during the conference. Adele, the conference was an absolute revelation on so many levels. Your spirit pervaded the lectures, discussions and rest times  it was such an open and enriching conference. A chance to engage both intellectually and emotionally  something very rare in conferences these days.\n\nMost impressive was the comfortable, grounded, open atmosphere that had a feeling of community.\n\nI LOVED the science content. Practitioner conferences I can find all over the place, much harder for me to find and access science sessions.\n\nThere was a wonderful feeling of mutual respect. Open forums for discussion. People from so many different backgrounds with shared interests.\n\nIt felt like a marathon of many 'a-ha' and 'oh' moments. There were many new understandings and confirmations of my own experiences that will deepen and render more effective my practice as a teacher. What was most evident was the open, enthusiastic spirit of the event which appeared to be a reflection of yourself and your genuine way with people.\n\nSample feedback on the 2013 meeting: http://braindevelopmentandlearning.com/BDL2013/feedback_2013.html\n\n\"Literally the best conference I ever attended. Especially impressive aspects were seeing the respect and integration of the different areas of expertise.\"\n\n\"Thank you for this transformative experience! What a wonderful collection of people and what a moving set of presentations and connections that unfolded!\"\n\n\"You attracted and organized knowledgeable, passionate, and humble researchers. Thank you for motivating us to examine and expand our own clinical practices.\"\n\n\"No other conference brings together the neuroscience of mental health and child development with leading-edge program developers and practitioners. The intersection of science and practice was truly unique and incredibly thought-provoking and useful to my pediatric practice. The format of the conference allows for really in-depth presentations as well as lots of time to interact with speakers and other participants.\"\n\n\"Such an extraordinary conference. It was truly life-changing. Beyond my expectations.\"\n\n\"Enthused with applying what I have learned.\"\n\n\"A remarkable conference with profound implications.\"\n\nSee the very extensive online resources for attendees & others:\n\nhttp://braindevelopmentandlearning.com/BDL2013/online_resources_2013.html\n\n12.The 1-of-a-kind, interdisciplinary, translational, cross-cultural 4-day conference: A Joyous Celebration of Ideas, the Arts, Science, & Efforts to Make the World a Better Place (held July 17-20, 2023 in Vancouver), attended by >400 from 45 countries & most Canadian provinces (plus many more online) that I conceived of, organized, and hosted. The 90 speakers included a Nobel Laureate, Commander of the British Empire, National Medal of Honor recipient, 3 Members of the Order of Canada, & several indigenous persons (Ktunaxa, Canada; Zuni, USA: Marma, Bangladesh; Maasai, Kenya). Most who attended found it the best conference theyd ever been to, exceptionally beneficial/ unforgettable/ mind-expanding/ game-changing (a humbling, inspiring and priceless experience), and a new model for interdisciplinary creative processes (it set a standard for how we convene, how we share and learn from each other):\n\nI cannot express the magnitude of the gift you shared last week. The amazing collection of global leaders, scientists, artists, and practitioners assembling in Vancouver to present their work. Im still reveling in the experience, just beginning to share ideas and contacts with colleagues, and imagine the learning will continue to unfold in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nIll never forget the conference. It has transformed me. I'll be processing insights gained for many years to come. Such a life-changing experience.\n\nWriting with immense gratitude and a heart filled with warmth after attending the extraordinary conference you orchestrated. I cant begin to express how deeply moved and inspired I am by the incredible event, bringing together people from various fields, expertise, and ways of knowing to celebrate humanity and explore fascinating intersections of arts, science, and education.\n\nI was truly impressed by the audience's richness and diversity, as well as the collaborative spirit that permeated the event.\n\nMany new collaborations emerged from the meeting (from your conference I have had several projects pop up. I am still marinating in the joy you created, the connections that manifest; left me with an indelible impression and some wonderful new colleagues with whom I plan to collaborate; Im already following up with several people I met and hope we can find a way to collaborate going forward).\n\nMany developed new connections with folks from other countries and/or fields (The connections I made at the conference were very meaningful. It was an exceptional experience and I keep telling everyone about how special an event it was.)\n\nRipple effects: I am inspired, humbled, and excited about joyfully sharing with others what I have learned and the amazing resources I learned about. This was an event that is still reverberating and creating positive creative change in the world. This has planted seeds of greatness in the hearts of those who came and in those whose words and actions they will influence.\n\nWeb site: https://www.devcogneuro.com/Conf2023\n\n[up] [home]\n\nCurrent Research Projects — click here.\n\n[up] [home]\n\nArticle Reviews For H1 Connect (formerly Faculty Opinions; originally Faculty of 1000)\n\n— click here.\n\n[up] [home]\n\nPublications\n\n(as of 29 Feb. 2024: 58,600 citations; h-index: 74)\n\nsource: Google Scholar Citation\n\n(* = Student Co-Author; T = Res.

For the first time we were heard and finally understood The number of websites on ADD has increased from 4 to thousands . Many people with attention deficits have great talents, often a high IQ, and are innovative and creative. However, they are seen as daydreamers who cannot concentrate well. In the old days we would be called stupid or lazy .Through her work we are now able to explain to others why ADD is so different from ADHD.
