        "text": "The James F. Drane Bioethics Institute at PennWest Edinboro focuses on the relationship between biological and biomedical sciences, ethics, medicine and the humane treatment of patients. This institute is a place of open discussion and scholarly research on topics that impact our world, including medicine, science, technology and ethics.\n\nWelcome to a Place of Open Discussion and Scholarly Research\n\nThe Bioethics Institute is both an educational and research center in bioethics, reaching beyond the walls of PennWest Edinboro to touch like-minded individuals across the United States and around the world. It reflects the commitment of PennWest Edinboro to strengthen the bonds between medicine and morality, science and ethics.\n\nThe Bioethics Institute is grounded in tradition, founded in 1969 and built on the mission and vision of its founder, James F. Drane, to make medicine more humane.\n\nThe Bioethics Institute is interdisciplinary, welcoming faculty, students and staff from all disciplines who are interested in exploring the ethical aspects, dimensions and implications in their field.\n\nThe Bioethics Institute is organic, constantly growing and changing as it contributes to the currently thriving discipline of bioethics.\n\nThe Bioethics Institute is dynamic, offering various lectures, events and fellowship opportunities to further advance the field of bioethics.\n\nThe Bioethics Institute is unique, proudly standing as one of the few institutions of its kind in state universities.\n\nCurrent Research Interests\n\nThe James F. Drane Bioethics Institute gives concrete form to the relationship between biomedical sciences and ethics. It is dedicated to promoting this relationship in society and in university disciplines. Issues of biomedical ethics are related to diverse academic disciplines because health is a pervasive concern in today’s Western and global cultures.\n\nFor a university to focus on science, yet ignore the associated ethical concerns, would be academically irresponsible. For that reason, our current research interests include:\n\nGlobal Bioethics:\n\nBiopolitics and bio-power\n\nGlobal governance for health\n\nThe immigration of health professional\n\nInternational research ethics\n\nClinical Research Ethics:\n\nResearch on vulnerable populations\n\nAnimal research\n\nSocial value in clinical research\n\nScientific validity in clinical research\n\nClinical Ethics:\n\nVirtues of health care professionals\n\nTheoretical frameworks for case study\n\nPublic Health Ethics:\n\nEthics in resource allocation in health\n\nScience and Bioethics:\n\nScience versus pseudoscience debate\n\nEthical, social and legal implications of scientific advances and new technologies\n\nPast and Present Leadership\n\nJames F. Drane, Ph.D.\n\nFounder and Director, 1969-2018\n\nDr. James F. Drane took a circuitous route to PennWest Edinboro. It was a path that shaped him, both personally and professionally, and led to the establishment of one of the only centers for bioethics research in a state university in this country.\n\nThe oldest of 10 children in a poor family in Chester, Pa., Dr. Drane felt a calling to the priesthood. He received his religious education at St. John’s Seminary in Little Rock, Ark., and a Theology degree from the Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained a Catholic priest. He advanced his education at Middlebury College, where he received a degree in Romance Languages before earning his Ph.D. in Philosophy at the University of Madrid.\n\nHe studied under the world-renowned doctor of psychiatry, Karl Menninger, in Topeka, Kan., spent years in research at Yale University and made a trip around the world, researching public policies in different cultures on ethical issues in medicine.\n\nWhen he arrived at PennWest Edinboro in 1969, he collaborated with the then University President to establish the Bioethics Institute. Although no longer a cleric, Dr. Drane has never lost his passion for continuing his ministry in the area of bioethics. He traveled to Central and South America on behalf of the World Health Organization to monitor research being done on human subjects.\n\nIn 2002, he was named one of the founders of the discipline of Bioethics at The International Bioethics Conference in Brasilia, Brazil. Dr. Drane has authored 20 books on bioethics and the conflicts and issues that can arise when medicine collides with ethical issues. This most famous text, “More Humane Medicine: A Liberal Catholic Bioethics,” received the Outstanding Book of the Year Award in 2004 from Independent Publishers. It was named “Best Health Book.”\n\nDr. Drane remains on campus as the Russell B. Roth Professor of Bioethics at the James F. Drane Bioethics Institute.\n\nKiarash Aramesh, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nDirector and Fellowship Director, 2018-Present\n\nAs a young medical doctor in Tehran, Iran, Dr. Aramesh specialized in community medicine. But he soon found himself immersed in issues that extended beyond physical health and wellness. He became increasingly aware of the ethical issues surrounding clinical medicine and biomedical sciences.\n\nIn 2005, he started working as a faculty of Medical Ethics at his medical school alma mater, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. During the next eight years, he conducted and taught several courses and more than 40 workshops on Research Ethics and Essentials of Medical Ethics for faculty members of medical universities in Tehran and other cities of Iran.\n\nHe has served as a member of various committees, including the Specialized Research Ethics Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences and the National Committee of Ethics in Science and Technology and Bioethics at the National Commission of UNESCO in Iran. He also played a prominent role in the development of various institutions and activities related to biomedical ethics in Iran, including curriculum development for the first Ph.D. programs in medical ethics and the first national guidelines for ethics in biomedical research.\n\nDr. Aramesh has published several books and articles on various aspects of biomedical ethics in English and Persian and has delivered numerous presentations as invited lecturer in different international conferences. He served as visiting scholar at the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y., in 2012 and at the National Institutes of Health in 2013-2014.\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Aramesh was awarded a Ph.D. in Healthcare Ethics from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pa. In September 2018, he accepted the position of director of the James F. Drane Bioethics Institute at PennWest Edinboro, where he coordinates activities, teaches courses in Bioethics, and pursues his own scholarly research on topics such as global bioethics, global governance for health, clinical research ethics, and the science-pseudoscience debate and its ethical implications in biomedical research and practice.\n\nHis goal is to preserve the legacy created by Dr. James Drane and to create a more dynamic, global presence for the Bioethics Institute.\n\nDuquesne-PennWest biannual conference on global bioethics\n\nThe Inaugural Conference\n\nFellowships for Scholars and Researchers\n\nScholars and researchers from across the United States and around the world are invited to collaborate with the Bioethics Institute in searching for solutions for bioethical issues and answers to bioethical questions. The James F. Drane Bioethics Institute awards fellowship status to scholars (preferably with affiliation to academic centers) and graduate students (preferably Ph.D. candidates who are working on their dissertations) from the United States or abroad whose scholarly works or projects are related to bioethics.\n\nEach Fellow spends between one and six months at the Institute. During the time of fellowship, the Fellow resides at PennWest Edinboro, using the resources available at the Institute, working with University faculty and participating in University events and activities.\n\nThe Fellow may also participate in the events sponsored by other academic centers in the region, especially the Center for Healthcare Ethics at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe institute has a limited fund to cover the travel and accommodation expenses for Fellows each year.\n\nWhat we provide:\n\nStudy space and academic resources – Fellows will have study space at the Institute along with full access to the resources including the library and journals.\n\nMentorship – Fellows will spend time with an academic mentor to advance their projects.\n\nStudying and teaching experiences – Fellows take part in academic events and bioethics classes at PennWest Edinboro.
