        "text": "The list of the Top 100 Authors reveals three notable features: First, absence of virtually any author who was scientifically active during the first 50 years of JCPA’s existence; second, exclusive presence of authors who were born at least five decades ago; and third, severe gender imbalance.\n\nInvestigators who were research active during the first 50 years of JCPA’s existence are (almost) entirely absent from the Top 100 authors list\n\nThe vast majority of authors on the Top 100 list published in JCPA primarily during the second 50 years of its existence, i.e., between 1974 and 2023. The only exceptions are Karl von Frisch, who published all his papers in the first half of JCPA’s 100 years of history; Hansjochem Autrum, whose last original research paper appeared in 1974; and Kurt Hamdorf, who published of his 31 articles in JCPA 18 between 1960 and 1973, and 13 between 1976 and 1992.\n\nThe phenomenon that 97% of the Top 100 Authors published exclusively, or primarily, during the second half of the 100 years of JCPA’s history can be explained by two peculiarities that distinguish the ‘early’ investigators from the ‘modern’ investigators. First, the number of papers of the early investigators was much lower than the number of papers produced by scientists of comparable peer recognition during the last 50 years. This discrepancy, in turn, has resulted in a lower number of citations. The deficit in the number of articles published in JCPA is not compensated by the much longer time that the early publications have been available for attracting citations because papers typically are cited most frequently during the first few years after their publication. Even Karl von Frisch, who was considered a highly prolific author of journal articles and books during his lifetime, published just 9 papers in JCPA. He made it onto the Top 100 Authors list based on the mean citation rate only.\n\nA second feature that sets apart the early investigators from the modern ones is that they very rarely produced papers with more than two authors, and on most of their papers they appeared as single authors (for a detailed analysis of this phenomenon see Zupanc 2015). Since we scored authorship independently of the number of co-authors, our listing gives preference to individuals who have co-authored (as opposed to single-authored) articles. This bias is particularly extreme if the number of co-authors is large and the average contribution of a co-author to these papers is small, compared to the investments that a single author must make to conduct the entire research and write the paper.\n\nIt takes (almost) a lifetime to make it on the Top 100 Authors list\n\nBesides the absence of early investigators (with the exception of Karl von Frisch) on our list, a notable feature characteristic of each of the Top 100 Authors is that they were born at least five decades ago. Of those authors who are still alive, and we know the year of birth, Nathan Hart, born in 1973, is the youngest. In most cases, this reflects the significant amount of time it takes to produce enough papers and/or attract enough citations to be included in the Top 100 Authors list. Only four of the authors who were selected based on the total number of citations have published 10 or less papers in JCPA. They include Colin Stephenson Pittendrigh and Serge Daan who published 7 and 10 papers, respectively. Nevertheless, these two authors top the mean citation rate list with 531 and 371, respectively. Five of their papers, each jointly authored, appeared in a single issue of JCPA, in October1976 (Pittendrigh and Daan 1976a, b, c; Daan and Pittendrigh 1976a, b). Reflecting the enormous impact that these five articles have had, this issue is frequently referred to as the ‘Bible of Chronobiology.’\n\nWomen scientists are disturbingly underrepresented on the Top 100 Authors list\n\nAmong the Top 100 Authors, there are only 7 women (Almut Kelber, Hanna Mustaparta, Gerbera Nalbach, Andrea Megela Simmons, Marianne Vater, Dora Fix Ventura, Roswitha Wiltschko). This finding comes as no surprise, given the severe underrepresentation of women among biology faculty during the last 100 years. We hypothesize that this disturbingly low number of women on our list primarily reflects the lack of adequate opportunities that women have traditionally encountered for a long time as they tried to establish their own laboratories and research programs. Without this foundation, they were deprived of the essential instrument for making it to the Top 100 Author list—the production of a large number of papers that attract a large number of citations. Two women scientists who had the potential to become leading zoologists of their times were Ruth Beutler and Ingeborg Beling. Both are portrayed in this Special Issue (Zupanc 2023; Beer et al. 2024). Beutler was never considered for appointment to a faculty position that would have enabled her to establish her own laboratory. For many years, she was employed by Karl von Frisch only as a technician at his institute—after she had received her PhD and even the Habilitation. Beling made a breakthrough discovery—time memory in honeybees—during her thesis research and established an excellent publication record after she received her PhD under von Frisch’s mentorship. However, she left science when she married, presumably due to political and/or societal pressure that even forced highly qualified women (like her) into the role of housewives.\n\nIn our metanalysis, we also considered the possibility that even women who succeeded in establishing their own publication records were still disadvantaged by gender bias in citation practice. This issue was recently highlighted by Dworkin et al. (2020) who analyzed the papers of five neuroscience journals (Brain, Journal of Neuroscience, Nature Neuroscience, NeuroImage, and Neuron). They found that reference lists tended to include more papers with men as first and last authors than was expected if gender were unrelated to referencing. Prompted by this finding, we first compared the mean citation rates of the articles of the five women who qualified for inclusion in the Top 100 Authors list by number of publications in JCPA (i.e., independent of any citation record) with the mean citation rates of all 54 authors in this criterion list. The median values of these two groups were almost identical (41.8 for all 54 authors vs. 40.9 for the five women). The publications of two of these five women exhibited mean citation rates above the overall median, whereas the mean citation rates of the publication of the other three women were below the overall median. Then, we took a closer look at the mean citation rates of the papers in JCPA. Two of the seven women had been selected based on this criterion. The value of this performance indicator of one woman was higher (102.3) than the median of the mean citation rate of all 54 authors in this selection category (87.8), while the corresponding value of the other woman author was lower (71.8). Thus, while we would like to stress the limitation of our analysis due to the small sample size, we have not found an indication of pervasive gender imbalance in citation practice toward papers published in JCPA by women, compared to men.\n\nWe believe that the latter finding, together with the significant increase in the number of women principal investigators in neuroethology and related disciplines over the last few decades, gives reason for hope. If a list of top authors would be compiled, let’s say at the 125th anniversary of JCPA, the gender distribution among these individuals is likely to be more balanced than it is today.\n\nThe Top 100 Authors: their academic careers and major scientific achievements\n\nIn the following, we list the Top 100 Authors in alphabetical order. For each of them, we present biosketches that highlight milestones of their academic careers and scientific achievements. The main sources of the biographical information were autobiographies and obituaries, the authors themselves and/or collaborators, as well as public information from the Internet. In some instances, the amount of information available was rather limited, which has unfortunately resulted in imbalances in length of the biosketches. These differences should not be interpreted as differences in the significance of the contributions made by authors to scientific knowledge.\n\nTo indicate links between different authors, we have marked names of authors mentioned in biosketches other than their own with an asterisk.\n\nEdmund A. Arbas (1950–95) earned his PhD from the University of Oregon in 1980 studying the muscular and neural correlates of flight loss in a grasshopper, supervised by Graham Hoyle. His interest in pattern-generating networks led him to pursue postdoctoral training studying the neural mechanisms of heartbeat and its modulation in the leech with Ronald Calabrese at Harvard University. Following a second postdoctoral position with Barry Ache at the University of Florida, where he performed intracellular recordings from olfactory interneurons in the crayfish, he became assistant (1986) and later associate professor at the Arizona Research Laboratories, Division of Neurobiology at the University of Arizona. Here he continued research on muscle degeneration in grasshoppers but also became interested in insect olfactory coding. Five of his 10 papers in JCPA contributed significantly to research on moth olfactory behavior and central nervous coding of pheromone signals in the moth brain. In 1995, while on a sailing trip with his family in Mexico, he died in a tragic accident.\n\nKentaro Arikawa (1957-) was born in Tokyo. He is professor and executive director of the Research Center for Integrative Evolutionary Science at Sokendai, Japan. Arikawa studied natural science at Jiyu Gakuen College and received his PhD in behavioral biology (1986) from Sophia University, analyzing the unique photoreceptive system of butterfly genitalia. He continued to work on vision in butterflies as research assistant and later full professor at Yokohama City University, interrupted by research positions at Indiana University and the Australian National University in Canberra. In 2006, he moved to his current position at Sokendai. Arikawa has received several prestigious awards, including the National Medal with Purple Ribbon from the Emperor of Japan in 2022. His continuing interest (as he puts it himself) is “how do animals see the world”. His studies on color vision in insects, mostly in Papilio butterflies, are comprehensive and include anatomical, ultrastructural, physiological and behavioral techniques. He has served on the editorial board of JCPA since 2009 and has contributed 26 highly cited papers on the visual behavior and photoreceptor physiology of butterflies.\n\nHarold L. Atwood (1937-) was born in Montreal. His academic training was in biology and neurophysiology, and he studied at the University of Toronto (BA, 1959), the University of California Berkeley (MSc, 1960), and the University of Glasgow (PhD, 1963; DSc, 1979), where he worked with C.M. Yonge and Graham Hoyle. He conducted postdoctoral research with Graham Hoyle at the University of Oregon and with C.A.G. Wiersma at the California Institute of Technology. Atwood joined the faculty of the University of Toronto in 1965, and remained there until his retirement in 2002. He directed the Medical Research Council of Canada Research Group in Nerve Cells and Synapses. His many awards include a Guggenheim Fellowship (1972), Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1981), Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (1982), Distinguished Scientist of the Medical Research Council of Canada (1997), and Fry Medal of the Canadian Society of Zoologists (1997). Atwood’s 13 publications in JCPA concern the physiology of muscular contraction, motor control, synaptic transmission, and synaptic modification (long-term facilitation and low-frequency depression) in the nervous and neuromuscular systems of crustaceans and fruit flies.\n\nHansjochem Autrum (1907–2003) was a giant in the field of sensory physiology for most of the twentieth century. He was the editor-in-chief of JCPA from 1960–96 (he was also editor-in-chief of Naturwissenschaften in parallel). He studied mathematics and physics (with a minor in biology) at the Humboldt University in Berlin, and received a PhD under the supervision of Richard Hesse in 1931. After the Second World War, Autrum became adjunct professor at the University of Göttingen (1948), full professor at the University of Würzburg (1952), and Head of the Zoological Institute of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU Munich) (1958). He was also highly active in science politics and was instrumental in the foundation of three major German universities: University of Regensburg, University of Bayreuth, and University of Konstanz. He was elected as a member of the German National Academy of Science (Leopoldina) in 1957 and as a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1958. He received the Feldberg Foundation Prize in 1966, was admitted to the order Pour le Mérit for Sciences and the Arts in 1977, and received the Bavarian Maximillian Order for Science and Art in 1984. Autrum made groundbreaking foundational studies on the sensory systems of animals, including the discovery of the extraordinarily low vibrational sensitivity thresholds of bush crickets and cockroaches (with threshold amplitudes in the order of atomic diameters!). He also made seminal studies of the physiological properties of insect eyes, including their temporal and spectral sensitivities, and was a pioneer of intracellular recordings in photoreceptors.\n\nFriedrich G. Barth (1940-) was born in Munich. He attended LMU Munich for his undergraduate studies in zoology, botany, physics, chemistry, and human physiology from 1959–62. Subsequently, he went to the University of California Los Angeles, to join the laboratory of Theodore H. Bullock* as a Fulbright Scholar. After returning to LMU Munich, he obtained his PhD under the mentorship of Hansjochem Autrum* in 1967, followed by the Habilitation in 1971. Between 1974 and 1987, he served on the faculty of Goethe University Frankfurt, and from 1987–2008 he was professor and chair of the Department of Neurobiology at the University of Vienna. Since 2008, he has been emeritus professor. During his scientific career, Barth has addressed important biological questions, particularly in the context of social communication, by combining sensory physiology with physics and engineering; and by complementing laboratory experiments with field observations in search of matches between properties of sensors and behavior and ecology. One of his major research interests has been vibratory communication in spiders and the functional biomechanics of cuticular strain receptors (a class of sensors that includes the spider vibration receptor). Since the early 2000s, he has increasingly turned his attention to the analysis of the signals and cues used by stingless bees for recruitment of nestmates to food sources—research that was largely based on fieldwork in Brazil. Barth has been closely affiliated with JCPA as both author and editor. His first paper, a physiological characterization of a phasic-tonic proprioceptor in the telson of the crayfish, appeared 60 years ago (Barth 1964). His last papers, including the most frequently accessed article of the last 100 years (Dyer et al. 2021), were published in 2021. In total, Barth has authored 64 publications in JCPA, which distinguishes him as the most prolific JCPA author of all times. Perhaps even more impactful was his service as editor-in-chief, a responsibility he assumed in 1996 when Hansjochem Autrum* retired from this position. Barth carried out this task with great dedication over the following 25 years, during which he left his editorial mark on numerous articles published in JCPA.\n\nJoseph A. Bastian (1944-) was born in Mare Island, California. After completing his undergraduate education at Elmhurst College (1966), he went to the University of Notre Dame, where he studied, both as a graduate student and as a postdoctoral fellow, bee communication and flight muscle physiology in the laboratory of Harald Esch. Each of the four papers that resulted from this work was published in JCPA. In 1969, he joined the lab of Shigehiru Nakajima at Purdue University to continue postdoctoral training in muscle physiology but, at the same time, he changed organisms from invertebrates to vertebrates. During his third postdoctoral stint, from 1972–74, in the laboratory of Theodore H. Bullock* at the University of California San Diego, Bastian began to address the question that became central to the research program he subsequently established as a faculty member at the University of Oklahoma: how does the central nervous system process electrosensory information in weakly electric fish? In recognition of his accomplishments, he received several distinctions, including the Jacob Javits Neuroscience Investigator Award. He was also named the George Lynn Cross Research Professor by the University of Oklahoma. Currently, Bastian is emeritus professor. The impact of the papers that he published in JCPA is not only evident from their large number (21), but also the many citations they have attracted—over 1400 in total and nearly 70 on average.\n\nHorst Bleckmann (1948-) was born in Rietberg, Germany. After successful completion of an apprenticeship as a machinist, he earned the Abitur (the German high school diploma) through second-chance education. He then studied biology and chemistry at the University of Giessen, where he also received his PhD in 1979. Following his Habilitation in 1986, Bleckmann worked with Theodore H. Bullock* as a Heisenberg Fellow at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California San Diego, and at the University of Bielefeld. In 1994, he was appointed to a full professorship at the University of Bonn, where he served on the faculty until 2017. His research covered a wide range of topics within neurophysiology and sensory physiology, neuroethology, and bionics. However, he is best known for his studies exploring how sensory information perceived through the lateral line system of cartilaginous and bony fishes is processed by the central nervous system. Part of this research led to the development of bionic sensors. Bleckmann has been a prolific author, with 42 highly cited articles published in JCPA. He has also contributed an autobiographical essay to this Special Issue.\n\nReinhard Blickhan (1951-) was born in Eppertshausen, Germany. He studied physics at the University of Giessen and the Technical University Darmstadt and received his Diplom (master’s) degree in 1976. Over the following 40 years, he applied his training in physics to study phenomena in biomechanics. The foundation for this interdisciplinary career was laid during his PhD thesis research on ‘Strain in the exoskeleton of spiders’ in the laboratory of Friedrich G. Barth* at Goethe University Frankfurt, for which he was awarded a Dr. rer. nat. degree in 1983. Following postdoctoral training at Harvard University and the Habilitation at the University of Saarland, he was appointed professor of biomechanics at the University of Jena in 1993, where he served on the faculty until his retirement in 2016. By combining experimental studies with numerical simulation, a major focus of his research was on the biomechanics of terrestrial and aquatic locomotion. The impact of Blickhan’s work is evident, among other indicators, by the nearly 125 citations that each of his 6 papers published in JCPA have attracted on average.\n\nJames K. Bowmaker (1946-) is emeritus professor of ophthalmology at University College London (UCL). He was educated at Queen Mary University of London, receiving a bachelor’s degree (1967) and a PhD (1970) in zoology for his work on visual transduction. He then pursued postdoctoral work with Frederick Crescitelli at the University of California Los Angeles (1970–72) and with Herbert Dartnall at the Medical Research Council Vision Unit at the University of Sussex (1972). It was with Dartnall that he first began using microspectrophotometry to measure the absorption characteristics of visual pigments in humans and monkeys. Bowmaker took a faculty position first as lecturer (1977) and then as reader (1987) at Queen Mary College. He moved to the Institute of Ophthalmology at UCL in 1989, becoming professor of vision research in 1994. He was awarded the Rank Prize for optoelectronics (1988) and is an honorary member of the Colour Group (Great Britain). Bowmaker’s research interests focus on the evolution and functions of visual pigments and color vision in vertebrates. In eight papers in JCPA, he presented new data on photoreceptors and visual pigments in several species of birds, fishes, and chameleons. He found that birds and freshwater fish have four visual pigments, including an ultraviolet-sensitive pigment, thereby possessing tetrachromatic color vision.\n\nHeinz Breer (1946-) was born in Wieste, Germany. He studied biology and chemistry at the University of Münster from 1968–72 and received his PhD from the University of Hohenheim in 1974. After postdoctoral training at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen, he worked for 10 years as a scientific assistant at the University of Osnabrück, where he received the Habilitation in zoology in 1982. In 1987, he was appointed to a professorship in physiology at the University of Hohenheim. During the following three decades of his tenure, Breer also served as vice president of the University and dean of the College of Science. After his retirement in 2018, he was re-appointed to the University as its first senior professor. Breer’s research activities are mainly in neurochemistry, with an emphasis on olfaction and gustation. He published approximately 300 papers, of which six appeared in JCPA. On average, each of the latter publications has been cited nearly 90 times, underscoring the impact of his research.\n\nTheodore H. Bullock (1915–2005; for obituaries see Zupanc 2006; Zupanc and Zupanc 2008) was born to American Presbyterian missionaries in Nanking, China. His immersion in the Chinese culture over the first 13 years of his life laid the foundation for his lifelong cosmopolitan outlook. He received his undergraduate degree (1936) and then his PhD in zoology from the University of California Berkeley (1940), working with S.F. Light. He then spent four years at Yale University, with summers at the Marine Biology Laboratory at Woods Hole. There, the ample opportunity to work on a large variety of organisms had a major impact on the development of his interest in comparative physiology. Later, he would argue that examination of the different mechanisms used by various organisms is as important as the search for commonalities in understanding how the brain works. As a consequence, during his tenure as a faculty member at the University of California Los Angeles (1946–66), and the University of California San Diego (1966–2005), Bullock studied an enormous variety of taxa, including cnidarians, crustaceans, fish, amphibians, and reptiles. He was a member of the US National Academy of Sciences (elected 1963), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1961), and the American Philosophical Society (1970). He served as the first president of the International Society for Neuroethology (1984), the third president of the Society for Neuroscience (1973–74), president of the American Society of Zoologists (1965) and of the American Association of University Professors (1955–56). He was awarded the Ralph W. Gerard Prize from the Society for Neuroscience (1984) and the Karl Spencer Lashley Award from the American Philosophical Society (1968). Bullock’s research interests were diverse and included, among others, the study of physiological processes at chemical and electrical synapses, the anatomy and physiology of sense organs, the analysis of electrical brain activity associated with cognitive events, and the mathematical modelling of neurophysiological activity. His many ‘firsts’ include the discovery of two new senses in animals—the facial pits of pit vipers that act as thermal sensors, and electroreceptors in the skin of certain fish. Equally important, he inspired numerous students and co-workers all over the world to identify new research directions and to establish their own field of study—an influence that can be felt even today. His 21 articles published in JCPA have attracted nearly 1100 citations.\n\nJeffrey M. Camhi (1941-), born in New York, is professor emeritus of cell and developmental biology and founding director of ‘Nature Park and Galleries,’ an open-campus museum, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Camhi earned his bachelor’s degree at Tufts University and his PhD (1967) at Harvard University under the direction of Ian Cooke. His dissertation examined the operation of wind receptors in the locust. He joined the faculty in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Cornell University in 1967, where he trained Roy Ritzmann*. In 1982, Camhi accepted a faculty position in the Department of Cell and Animal Biology at Hebrew University Jerusalem, where he spent the rest of his academic career. His 1984 book, Neuroethology: Nerve Cells and the Natural Behavior of Animals (Sinauer) inspired many students to enter the field. Currently, he is actively involved in developing strategies to improve public outreach and education in science and nature. Camhi’s 35 papers in JCPA contribute a neuroethological analysis of the escape system of the cockroach. He determined the threshold wind velocity needed to evoke the escape response, how these responses are coded by in the nervous system, and developed a model of the escape system based on synaptic responses of different populations of interneurons.\n\nRobert R. Capranica (1931–2012) was born in Southern California and was a resident of Tucson, Arizona at the time of his death (see obituary by Adler et al. 2013). After service in the US Navy (1951–54), he received his BA in electrical engineering from the University of California Berkeley in 1958. Capranica then moved to New York University, where he received his MS, and then to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from which he received his ScD in electrical engineering in 1965. At MIT, he studied with Moise Goldstein, Lawrence Frishkopf, and Jerome Lettvin. It was Lettvin’s pioneering work on “what the frog’s eye tells the frog’s brain” that inspired Capranica to examine “what the frog’s ear tells the frog’s brain.” Capranica’s dissertation, published as a monograph titled The Evoked Vocal Response of the Bullfrog (MIT Press, 1965), remains a model of how to incorporate engineering and biology to answer questions about evolution and adaptation to the environment. His first position after MIT was at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey (1958–69). He was recruited to Cornell University in 1969, with appointments in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior and the Department of Electrical Engineering. At Cornell he built a large laboratory dedicated to the integrative study of the auditory system of anuran amphibians. Six of his trainees and collaborators are included among the Top 100 Authors listed here (Günther Ehret*, Albert Feng*, Howard Carl Gerhardt*, Peter Narins*, Gary Rose*, Andrea Megela Simmons*). Capranica served as an associate editor of JCPA from 1974–86, and is one of the founding members of the International Society for Neuroethology. He was an elected Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America (1974) and of the International Society for Neuroethology (2012). He and his spouse Patricia endowed the Capranica Fund at the International Society for Neuroethology to celebrate the achievements of young neuroethologists. Capranica retired from Cornell in 2012 and moved to Arizona. His 20 papers in JCPA integrated field studies and laboratory electrophysiological methods to decipher how species-specific advertisement calls are produced, recognized, and encoded in the brain. These papers quantify the frequency tuning of the frog’s inner ear and how it relates to the spectral content of the advertisement call; sex differences in the tuning of the inner ear; acoustic sensitivity of the frog’s midbrain and thalamus; mechanisms by which small frogs can localize sound sources; and the use of spectroscopy to measure the mechanics of the middle ear.\n\nLars Chittka (1963-, born in Bad Homburg, Germany) is professor of sensory and behavioral ecology at Queen Mary University of London. He was educated at the University of Göttingen and the Free University of Berlin, where he received his PhD under the mentorship of Randolf Menzel*. He is a member of the German National Academy of Science (Leopoldina), and Fellow of the Linnean Society, the Royal Society of Biology, and the Royal Entomological Society. In 2006, he received the latter’s Lesley Goodman Award. Chittka has made seminal contributions to our understanding of insect color vision and the interactions of insects with flowers, and his work on the cognitive abilities of bumblebees has changed the way we understand the evolution of animal cognition and its neural underpinnings. He is well known for his work exploring the behavior, cognition, and ecology of bees, a topic he summarized in his 2022 book The Mind of a Bee (Princeton University Press). He has collaborated in several musical and artistic compositions based on bee biology. Chittka’s 11 papers published in JCPA—nearly all of which deal with color vision in bees—have been highly cited. A good example is his 1992 analysis (with Randolf Menzel*) of 180 floral spectral reflection spectra showing that flower colors are well matched to the color vision of bees (Chittka and Menzel 1992, with 304 citations as of November 2023).\n\nThomas A. Christensen (1956-) was born in Queens, New York. He earned his BSc in biology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook and his PhD from the same institution in 1983 for research supervised by Albert Carlson on the neural control of luminescence in the firefly. For postdoctoral training, he joined the group of John Hildebrand* at Columbia University, and moved with him to the University of Arizona in late 1985 to become senior research scientist at the Arizona Research Laboratories, Division of Neurobiology. There, he performed groundbreaking work in analyzing the mechanisms of olfactory signal processing in the brain of the sphinx moths and, in collaboration with Hanna Mustaparta*, characterized the olfactory system of heliothine moths. Motivated by an increasing interest in human studies, in 2006 Christensen moved within the University of Arizona to the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences to perform MRI studies on attention and language representation in the human brain. In 2012, he left the University of Arizona to take on a teaching position at Pima Community College. In 11 highly cited articles in JCPA, he contributed significantly to our understanding of how pheromone signals are processed in the brain of sphinx moths and heliothine moths.\n\nFrançois Clarac is emeritus research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) Aix-Marseille. He continues to teach at Aix-Marseille and at Montpellier. He is a Member of the Academy of Europe (elected 1996) and the Académie de Marseille (elected 2006). He served as Chancellor of the Académie de Marseille in 2011, and as Director in 2012 and 2014. Clarac’s research focuses around cellular mechanisms of locomotion, neural bases of rhythmic behavior, and developmental plasticity of the spinal cord. He has collaborated with Douglas M. Neil* on comparative studies of the swimmeret system in crustaceans. Currently, Clarac continues to write and speak on the history of neuroscience and on the importance of neuroscience research. Together with Jean-Peirre Ternaux, he has authored two books, Encyclopédie historique des neurosciences: Du neurone à l'émergence de la pensée (Historical Encyclopedia of Neuroscience: From Neuron to the Emergence of Thought; de boeck, 2008) and Le Bestiaire cérébral (The Cerebral Bestiary, CNRS Editions, 2012).\n\nThomas S. Collett (born 1939 in London) is emeritus professor of neurobiology at the University of Sussex. He studied psychology and zoology at University College London, and received his PhD with David Blest working on visual behavior of moths. Inspired by Hubel and Wiesel’s work on the visual cortex, they pioneered physiological recordings from motion-sensitive interneurons in moths. In 1965, Collett was appointed assistant lecturer at the University of Sussex and later progressed to the rank of full professor. He is a Fellow of the Grass Foundation (1965). Collett has contributed significantly to the study of insect vision, spatial orientation, and navigation. His interests focus on behavioral studies of navigation, landmark learning, and spatial memory in flies, ants, and bees. His meticulous observations on landmark learning in bees and ants, as well as his studies on visual control of flight behavior in hoverflies, received record numbers of citations. Out of well over 170 papers, he published 32 highly cited articles on these topics in JCPA.\n\nThomas Cronin (1945-) is renowned for his decades of research on the visual systems of crustaceans, and particularly on the remarkable polarization and color vision of mantis shrimps. Educated at Dickinson College (BSc, 1967) and Duke University (MA, 1969; PhD, 1979), he studied crustacean visual pigments in the lab of Timothy Goldsmith at Yale University before joining the University of Maryland Baltimore in 1983, where he is now professor of biological sciences. Cronin’s chief interest is understanding how the visual systems of animals are matched to their habitats and lifestyles, a field known as ‘visual ecology.’ Together with Sönke Johnsen, Justin Marshall*, and Eric Warrant*, Cronin authored a book on this topic—Visual Ecology (Princeton University Press, 2014)—which is now the most important work in the field. For his many contributions to visual ecology, Cronin was elected as Fellow of the International Society of Neuroethology in 2014. Cronin’s many well-cited papers in JCPA deal with color and polarization vision in mantis shrimps, mysids, crayfish and insects, with notable contributions to our understanding of how visual pigments are spectrally tuned for vision in specific light environments (e.g., at different depths in the ocean) and for different tasks (e.g., for detecting specific colors of bioluminescence).\n\nSerge Daan (1940–2018; see obituary by Trillmich et al. 2018) was an inspiring scientist who contributed seminal work to the fields of chronobiology, sleep research, psychiatry, physiology, ecology, and behavioral biology. Daan studied biology at the University of Amsterdam and received his PhD on hibernation of bats and mice in 1973. In 1971, while still finishing his PhD thesis, he became a postdoctoral researcher with Jürgen Aschoff at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Erling-Andechs. The time with Aschoff founded his lifelong interest in the role of circadian clocks in seasonal timing and their significance in an ecological context. Through Aschoff, Daan met Colin Stephenson Pittendrigh* with whom he spent his second postdoctoral position at Stanford University. During his stay at Stanford, he wrote a series of five papers together with Pittendrigh (‘A functional analysis of circadian pacemakers in nocturnal rodents,’ Parts I-V), which appeared as a single issue of JCPA in 1976. This series of papers belongs to the highest cited research papers in JCPA and has become the ‘Bible of Chronobiology’ for hundreds of students and scientists. In 1975, Daan moved to the University of Groningen where he was appointed professor of ethology in 1996. In 2003, he was promoted to the prestigious Niko Tinbergen Chair in Behavioral Biology, which he held until his retirement in 2011. He was awarded several prizes and awards, including the International Prize for Biology (2006), conferred by the Emperor of Japan. He was appointed Knight in the Order of the Dutch Lion (2005) and was elected Foreign Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (2000). Daan (co-) supervised more than 40 PhD students. Most of them pursued successful careers in science. His work became more eco-physiologically oriented by focusing on kestrel-vole interactions in relation to energy expenditure. ‘Time and Energy’ was a central theme in his Chronobiology group. EEG recordings during sleep made together with Alex Borbély and Domien Beersma led to the development of the ‘Two Process Model’ of human sleep regulation, a model which still inspires many sleep researchers all over the world. He stayed active after retirement. His last publication, the biography of Jürgen Aschoff—Die Innere Uhr des Menschen: Jürgen Aschoff (1913–1998), Wissenschaftler in einem bewegten Jahrhundert (The Biological Clock of Humans: Jürgen Aschoff (1913–1998), Scientist in a Turbulent Century; Reichert, 2017), appeared two months before his death. He has published 10 highly-cited papers in JCPA.\n\nWilliam Jackson Davis is founder and executive director of the Environmental Studies Institute. He received his BA in zoology (1964) at the University of California Berkeley and his PhD in biology (1968) under the direction of Graham Hoyle at the University of Oregon. Davis pursued postdoctoral research with Melvin Cohen (University of Oregon, 1967–68) and with Donald Kennedy (Stanford University, 1968–70), where he investigated motor control in lobsters. He joined the Department of Biology at the University of California Santa Cruz in 1969, and remained there as professor of ecology and evolution and of environmental sciences until 2004. In 1981, Davis founded the non-profit Environmental Studies Institute. The mission of this institute is to research and consult on matters of importance to public policy, such as radioactive waste, nuclear proliferation, climate change, and biodiversity. Davis has published extensively in the areas of biological sciences, environmental sciences, health and fitness, and public policy. His 17 papers in JCPA analyze the hormonal and neural control of motor behavior in invertebrates, with an emphasis on the physiology of command neurons in the buccal ganglion of sea slugs; the role of internal states in controlling slug feeding behavior; and the neural and behavioral control of walking and swimmeret motion in lobsters.\n\nJohn Manuel De Souza (1930–2016) was professor at the Institute of Psychology at the University of São Paolo. He earned undergraduate degrees in civil and electrical engineering at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in Sao Pãolo (1955). After a career in business, in 1983 he returned to academia, enrolling in the University of São Paolo. He received his master's (1986) and PhD (1993) degrees in experimental psychology, working with Dora Fix Ventura* on the neural coding of visual cues in the retina and first visual ganglion of Hymenoptera. He continued to collaborate with Ventura throughout his career on projects related to the spectral sensitivity and morphology of insect compound eyes and the electrophysiology of the visual system. In 1984 and 1985, de Souza worked with Randolf Menzel* at the Free University of Berlin to characterize and compare color vision sensitivity of photoreceptors in closely related hymenopterans. His six publications in JCPA describe the use of intracellular recordings to elucidate the operation of photoreceptor cells and other retinal cells in multiple hymenopteran species; how the color vision system of these animals has evolved to adapt to different ecologies and behavioral demands; and to characterize the ultraviolet sensitivity of the goldfish retina.\n\nGünter Ehret (born 1949, Kaiserslautern, Germany) is professor emeritus for neurobiology at the University of Ulm, Germany. Ehret studied chemistry and biology at the Technical University of Darmstadt and received his doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) in 1975 for studies on the auditory system of mice, supervised by Hubert Markl. He moved as research assistant with Markl to the University of Konstanz, where he received his Habilitation (1981) followed by a Heisenberg Stipend (1982–85) from the German Science Foundation. As a visiting professor at Cornell University, he conducted behavioral and electrophysiological studies on hearing in frogs in conjunction with Robert R. Capranica*, and at the University of California San Francisco, he examined neural coding of complex sounds in the inferior colliculus of cats in collaboration with Michael Merzenich. In 1993, Ehret received the Merckle Research Award for Natural Science. In 1988, he became professor for neurobiology at the University of Ulm where he stayed until retirement in 2014. Ehret’s scientific interests focus on the auditory system and acoustic communication in mice, but he also contributed to studies in insects and frogs. In more recent years, his interest shifted to evolutionary and emotional aspects of auditory communication and the neural basis of awareness and consciousness. Out of well over 100 publications in peer-reviewed journals, numerous book chapters, and two books, he published 13 papers in JCPA and, together with Henning Scheich*, he edited an extremely well-received Special Issue on Auditory Cortex (Volume 181, Issue 6, 1997).\n\nJoachim Erber (1946-) was born in Wiesbaden, Germany. He studied electrical engineering at the Technical University of Darmstadt. In his Diplom (master’s) thesis he developed a model of photoreceptor function. He subsequently shifted further into the field of zoology and completed his dissertation, supervised by Randolf Menzel* and Hubert Markl, on learning dynamics in the honeybee. As a postdoctoral researcher in Menzel’s group, Erber performed electrophysiological studies on interneurons in the brain of bees and shore crabs, and spent a year at the Australian National University studying the visual interneurons of crayfish. In 1976, together with Menzel, he moved as assistant professor to the Free University of Berlin and continued behavioral and electrophysiological studies on olfactory learning in honeybees and visual signal processing in crabs. Following his Habilitation in 1978 and a research stay at the University of Sussex, Erber became professor of animal physiology at the Technical University of Berlin in 1982. There, he developed various learning paradigms for honeybees and studied the underlying neural mechanisms. In his later years, a focus of his research became the involvement of biogenic amines, and the identification of amine receptors, in the honeybee brain. In collaboration with Robert Page at Arizona State University, he analyzed the physiological basis of differences in honeybee foraging behavior. Erber retired in 2011. He published his data on learning assays, the effect of sensory thresholds on learning, and the role of biogenic amines on honeybee learning in 22 articles in JCPA.\n\nJörg-Peter Ewert (1938-) is one of the pioneers of neuroethology who unraveled the neurophysiological bases of visually controlled behavior in the toad. Ewert was born in Danzig and studied biology, chemistry and geography at the University of Göttingen. After graduation (1965), he worked as a scientific assistant at the Zoological Institute of the Technical University of Darmstadt until 1969, first under Wolfgang Luther and then under Hubert Markl. During a research visit at the Free University of Berlin, Ewert learned electrophysiological recordings and began to record from neurons in the visual system of the common toad. He obtained his Habilitation from the Technical University of Darmstadt in 1969. From 1970–71, he worked with David J. Ingle at the Harvard Medical School, and from 1971–72 as a university professor at the Zoological Institute of the Technical University of Darmstadt. In 1973, Ewert became the chair of zoology/physiology at the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Kassel, where he formed a neuroethology research team and where he remained until his retirement in 2006. In 1980, he published his book Neuroethology: An Introduction to the Neurophysiological Fundamentals of Behavior (Springer, 1980), which inspired many neuroethologists. He is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1983). Ewert’s 41 papers published in JCPA describe, analyze, and model the release of visual behaviors in prey-catching toads.\n\nAlbert S. Feng (1944–2021; for an obituary see Narins and Feng 2023) made fundamental discoveries in neuroethology and comparative physiology, probing acoustic communication in frogs, electroreception in electric fishes, and echolocation in bats. Feng was born in Bandung, Indonesia, and moved to the US to study electrical engineering at the University of Miami. He earned his BA in 1968 and his master’s in 1970. He received his PhD in electrical engineering (1975) at Cornell University under the mentorship of Robert R. Capranica*. Feng pursued postdoctoral studies on electroreception (1976) with Theodore H. Bullock* at University of California San Diego and on echolocation (1977) with James A. Simmons at Washington University. He joined the faculty at the University of Illinois in 1977, remaining there until his retirement in 2010. At Illinois, he served as department head of molecular and integrative physiology and as director of the neuroscience program at the Beckman Institute. He played an essential role in building and expanding Beckman’s neuroscience program, and was highly respected as a teacher and educator. He traveled extensively to conduct field work on vocalizing frogs and echolocating bats. Feng was an elected Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America (1997), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1993), and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (1988). His 26 papers in JCPA analyze perception and localization of advertisement calls by frogs, neural coding of these advertisement calls, and neural mechanisms of target ranging in echolocating bats. This work inspired his development of a novel hearing aid for canceling out background noise. Along with Peter M. Narins*, Feng was a member of the team that discovered the ability of some specialized frog species to hear ultrasound. A Special Issue devoted to him and his work (Neuroethology of Auditory Systems: Contributions in Memory of Albert S. Feng) was published in JCPA (Volume 209, Issue 1, 2023).\n\nRussell G. Foster (1959-) is the director of the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology, the Head of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, and a Nicholas Kurti Senior Fellow at Brasenose College at the University of Oxford. He studied at the University of Bristol, receiving his PhD in 1984 for a thesis on how extraretinal photoreceptors mediate photoperiodic induction in Japanese quail. Furthermore, he showed that the pineal eye of Xenopus can directly excite behavior, work that was published in JCPA in 1982. From 1988–95 he conducted postdoctoral work at the University of Virginia with Michael Menaker*. During this time, Foster, Martin Ralph, and Menaker carried out their impactful transplantation experiments that showed that the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus is sufficient and necessary for mammalian circadian rhythms. In addition, Foster found that mice with degenerated retinas can still synchronize their circadian rhythms to light–dark cycles, providing evidence that rods and cones are not necessary for circadian entrainment. This seminal paper appeared in JCPA in 1991 and was highly cited. Later he showed that melanopsin in the retinal ganglion cells works as a circadian photoreceptor. In 1995, Foster returned to the UK and started his own laboratory at Imperial College in London where he became chair of molecular neuroscience within the Faculty of Medicine. Later, he transferred his laboratory to the University of Oxford to engage in translational research, investigating the importance of circadian clocks and sleep for human health. He has been awarded many prizes, and his contribution to science has been recognized by his election as Fellow of the Royal Society and as Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, culminating in the 2015 New Year’s honors with the award of Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Foster has published more than 100 research articles, four popular science books and writes newspaper articles. He regularly contributes to radio and television.\n\nAndrew S. French (1943-) was born in Holbeton, UK. He studied chemistry at the Universities of Salford and Essex and received a PhD in chemistry from the University of Essex in 1968, supervised by John N. Bradley. For postdoctoral training he joined the laboratory of Richard Stein at the University of Alberta. There, he soon moved through the ranks to full professor of physiology in 1982, interrupted only by a sabbatical at the Australian National University. In 1993, he became professor and head of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at Dalhousie University, where he is (since 2022) professor emeritus. French’s research covers a wide range of topics related to sensory transduction and signal transmission in sensory systems, in particular the visual system of insects and mechanosensory system of insects and spiders. In his studies he characterizes ion channels involved in signal transduction, the role of neurotransmitters, as well as the information content of sensory channels. From 1989–90, he served as president of the Canadian Physiological Society and in 2009 received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oulu. Of his nearly 200 published journal articles and more than 20 book chapters, 21 papers on phototransduction in cockroaches and flies, and signal transduction in spider and cockroach mechanoreceptors, among other topics, appeared in JCPA.\n\nW. Otto Friesen (1942-) was born in Elbing, Germany. After immigrating to the United States, he received his BA from Bethel College in 1964, his MA from the University of California Berkeley in 1966, and his PhD from the University of California San Diego in 1974. From 1974–77, he worked as a postdoctoral research associate in the laboratory of Gunther S. Stent* at the University of California Berkeley, where he identified a network of bilaterally paired, rhythmically active interneurons as components of the central pattern generator (CPG) that controls the swimming rhythm in the medicinal leech. He and Stent showed that recurrent cyclic inhibition plays a key role in the generation of the rhythmic neural burst activity of this CPG. In 1977, Friesen established his own laboratory at the University of Virginia, where he progressed through the faculty ranks to full professor. There, he continued to study neural mechanisms underlying rhythmic locomotion in the medicinal leech, including how swimming is modulated by sensory input. Friesen retired in 2013. Out of the 56 original papers that he published during his career, 22 appeared in JCPA.\n\nJames Howard Fullard (1952–2010) was born in British Columbia. He was an undergraduate the University of Toronto (1971–75) where he worked with Glenn K. Morris on the biology of insect auditory systems. He then moved to Carleton University where he received his master’s (1976) and his PhD (1979) degrees, on the topic of sound production in tiger moths, under the mentorship of M. Brock Fenton. He conducted postdoctoral research with Morris at the University of Toronto and with James A. Simmons at the University of Oregon. Fullard joined the faculty at the University of Toronto (1980), where he rose through the ranks to full professor (1993) and where he remained until his death. The James H. Fullard Nature Trial, near the Queen’s University Biological Station, was named in his memory. Over his career, Fullard travelled extensively throughout the tropics to conduct field work on insects and bat-insect interactions. Among his approximately 100 original research articles, he published 19 papers in JCPA. These papers describe in detail the auditory sensitivity of insects (tympanate moths, crickets) on the basis of acoustic, behavioral, and physiological measurements, and the behavioral strategies that have evolved in these species to avoid predation by echolocating bats.\n\nHoward Carl Gerhardt (1945-) was born in Newport News, Virginia and grew up in Savannah, Georgia. He received his Bachelor of Science in zoology at the University of Georgia in 1966, and his PhD from the University of Texas at Austin in 1970. From 1970–71, he was a postdoctoral researcher with Robert R. Capranica* at Cornell University studying the neurobiology and behavior of amphibians. In 1971, he was appointed as an assistant professor at the University of Missouri, where he progressed through the faculty ranks to full professor. He is now a Curators’ Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Biological Sciences. Gerhardt received many honors and awards including the Senior Humboldt Award (1995), the Frank Beach Award (2001), the Distinguished Herpetologist Award from the Herpetologist League (2006), the Thomas Jefferson Award of the University of Missouri (2012), and the Quest Award from the Animal Behavior Society (2015). He is a Fellow of the Animal Behavior Society (elected 1991) and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1998). Gerhardt has contributed significantly to the understanding of the evolution and neurobiology of acoustic communication in amphibians. He identified the pertinent properties of male calls that are used by females for mate choice. By systematically varying the acoustic properties of synthetic sounds that mimic the stereotyped calls of males and by measuring the responses of females, he found that female grey treefrogs prefer the calls that are the most energetically expensive for the males to produce. This allows females to ensure that the male they select is not only in good physical condition, but also possibly genetically better than his neighbors. He co-authored with Franz Huber* the book Acoustic Communication in Insects and Anurans (Chicago University Press, 2002). Of the 207 publications (including books and book chapters) produced by Gerhardt, 20 highly cited papers appeared in JCPA.\n\nMartin Giurfa (1962-, born in Lima) is a well-known neuroethologist and a pioneer in the field of insect cognition, with a special interest in the cognitive abilities of bees. Following an undergraduate degree in biology at the University of Buenos Aires, Giurfa obtained a PhD at the same university under the supervision of Josué Núñez. In 1990, he joined the laboratory of Randolf Menzel* at the Free University in Berlin where he built a reputation for his studies on color vision of bees. He obtained the Habilitation from the Free University of Berlin in 1997, and became assistant professor in the Institute of Neurobiology there. In 2001, Giurfa became professor of neuroscience at Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse where he continued his research on insect cognition. Since 2023, he has been Exceptional-Class Professor of Neurosciences at the Sorbonne University. He has been the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships, among them membership of the German National Academy of Science (Leopoldina; 2007), the Royal Academies for Science and Arts of Belgium (2018), the Silver Medal of the French National Center for Scientific Research (2007), and the International Prize of Science & Technology \"Raices\" of the Argentinean Government (2013). He is an editor of the volume Honeybee Neurobiology and Behavior (2012) with C. Giovanni Galizia and Dorothea Eisenhardt. Giurfa is particularly interested in understanding the principles underlying learning, memory and decision-making in bees, employing both behavioral and neurophysiological methods in his investigations. Of his eight papers published in JCPA, one in particular—on the rich behavioral repertoire of honeybees, and their remarkable capacity for complex learning and memory (Giurfa 2007)—has had a major influence on the field of insect cognition.\n\nWulfila Gronenberg (born 1954 in Berlin) is professor in the Department of Neuroscience, University of Arizona. Gronenberg studied biology at the Free University of Berlin and received his Diplom (master’s degree) in 1979. In his PhD thesis research, supervised by Joachim Erber* at the Free University of Berlin, he characterized neurons innervating the mushroom body of the honeybee brain. After receiving his PhD in 1984, he held various research positions, first with Friedrich G. Barth* at Goethe University Frankfurt working on mechanoreceptors in spiders, and then with Nicholas Strausfeld* at the University of Arizona, characterizing descending neurons in flies. From 1991–99, he was assistant and later associate professor with Bert Hölldobler at the University of Würzburg, focusing on the analysis of trap-yaw mechanisms in ants. In 1999, he became associate professor at the Arizona Research Laboratories, Division of Neurobiology. Since 2016, he is full professor at the Department of Neuroscience of the University of Arizona. Here, Gronenberg continued research on hymenopteran mushroom bodies by characterizing their sensory (especially visual) inputs and multimodal convergence. More recently, his interests have shifted to questions concerning brain development, evolution and plasticity in social insects. Of more than 80 articles published in journals and as book chapters, Gronenberg has contributed six highly cited publications to JCPA.\n\nKurt Hamdorf (1929–2009) was born in Hamburg. He studied biology at the University of Hamburg and joined the group of the marine biologist Adolf Bückmann for a Diplom (master’s) and PhD thesis. In 1958, he received his doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) for studies on the role of light on the development of the rainbow trout. He then joined the group of Hansjochem Autrum* at LMU Munich and changed his focus of interest to study primary visual processes in insects. Following his Habilitation at LMU Munich, Hamdorf was appointed in 1969 as professor of visual physiology at the Ruhr-University of Bochum where he stayed until his retirement in 1994. Hamdorf contributed significantly to furthering our understanding of primary visual processes and the mechanisms of phototransduction in insects. In addition, he also contributed to research on visually triggered landing responses in flies. Hamdorf’s 31 publications in JCPA focus on absorption properties of visual pigments, mechanisms of phototransduction, visual adaptation, spectral sensitivity, pupil mechanisms, and photoregeneration in flies and moths.\n\nRoger Clayton Hardie (1953-) studied at the Australian National University with George Adrian Horridge*, and received his PhD in 1979 for studies on peripheral visual function in flies. After completing his PhD, he moved to the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen as a postdoctoral fellow. In 1986, he moved to the University of Cambridge, where he remains a professor today. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (2010) and was awarded the Rank Prize in Optoelectronics for his outstanding contributions to research on the physiology of insect vision. One of Hardie’s first papers, revealing common strategies for light adaptation in the peripheral visual systems of flies and dragonflies, was published in JCPA in 1978 and cited 329 times. In addition, a series of four highly cited papers, dating back to his dissertation, in which he characterized the fly retina electrophysiologically, were published in JCPA (1979). Hardie characterized the sex-specific photoreceptors in the anterior dorsal eye of male houseflies by microspectrophotometry and intracellular recordings, and he studied the pigment system of photoreceptor cell R7 in flies. Furthermore, he showed that histamine is the neurotransmitter released by photoreceptors and that it directly activates ion channels on adjacent cells in the visual pathway. Again, these articles were published in JCPA, and the histamine article alone is cited 344 times. He identified genes in fruit flies that encode transient receptor potential ion channels through which calcium flows in response to light, and he characterized the visual phototransduction cascade in flies, including the role of arrestin. In total, Hardie published 17 original research articles in JCPA (out of his approximately 200 articles).\n\nNathan Hart (1973-) is professor and head of the School of Natural Sciences at Macquarie University. Hart was educated during the 1990s at the University of Bristol (BSc and PhD), and moved to Australia in 1999, first as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Queensland and then as an associate professor at the University of Western Australia. He is particularly interested in the evolution of vertebrate color vision, and addresses this question in ‘early’ vertebrates such as lampreys and sharks. He also studies the color vision of birds to understand how this visual modality is used in their sexual and natural selection. His highly cited papers in JCPA all deal with the color vision of birds, and in particular how the absorption spectra of the visual pigments and the overlying oil droplets affect color perception and are related to the ecologies of different species. In more recent times, he has devoted his research efforts to developing methods that deter sharks and protect humans from shark bites.\n\nWalter Heiligenberg (1938–1994; for obituaries see Zupanc and Lamprecht 1994; Zupanc and Bullock 2006) was born in Berlin. After two years of undergraduate study in zoology and botany at the University of Münster, he conducted his PhD thesis research under the guidance of Konrad Lorenz and Hansjochem Autrum* at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Seewiesen from 1960–63. In this study, he analyzed the influence of motivational factors on the occurrence of behavioral patterns in cichlid fish. During the following nine years, he continued his behavioral studies at the same institute. A widely recognized achievement during this time was his quantitative demonstration of the phenomenon of heterogeneous summation. In 1972, he joined the Neurobiology Unit at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California San Diego, headed by Theodore H. Bullock*. One year later, he established his own laboratory there. His trainees include Gary Rose* and Günther Zupanc*. During the following two decades, Heiligenberg succeeded in what Rüdiger Wehner* once characterized as “one of the best, if not the best and most complete case study available in neuroethology” (Wehner 1994), namely his work on the jamming avoidance response in the weakly electric fish Eigenmannia. Together with his associates, he deciphered some of the key computational rules and many of the details of the neural network underlying this behavior. Heiligenberg had a very close relationship with JCPA—not only as an associate editor but also as one of its most prolific authors. Of the 170 publications (including books and book chapters) authored by himself and/or members of his lab, 59 appeared in JCPA. On 40 of them, Heiligenberg is listed as (co-)author. His book Neural Nets in Electric Fish (MIT Press, 1991) provides a comprehensive summary of his research on the jamming avoidance response and the underlying neural network. He died at the zenith of his scientific career when he was aboard an aircraft that crashed near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nMartin Heisenberg (1940-) was born in Göttingen and studied chemistry and molecular biology at the University of Tübingen. In 1966, at the age of 26, he completed his doctoral thesis on a topic concerning the genetics of bacteriophages. He then went to the California Institute of Technology (1966–68) as a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Max Delbrück, where he learned molecular biology methodologies. He returned to Germany in 1968 to assume an assistant professorship with Karl-Georg Götz at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen, where he began his research on the fruit fly. In 1975, Heisenberg took over the Chair of Genetics and Neurobiology (at that time still Chair of Genetics and Microbiology) at the University of Würzburg. He held this chair for almost 35 years until his retirement in 2009, when he accepted a senior professorship at the Rudolf Virchow Centre in Würzburg. Heisenberg was elected as a member of the German National Academy of Sciences (Leopoldina) in 1989, and of the Academia Europaea in 1988. Included among his many awards are the Karl Ritter von Frisch Medal (2006) and the Röntgen-Medal (2015). He was president of the Society for Neuroethology from 2007–10. During his many years at the University of Würzburg, Heisenberg, as one of the world’s leading neurobiologists and geneticists, made outstanding contributions to the field of visual behavior, and learning and memory. He was one of the first to use brain development mutants in fruit flies to study the relationship between brain structures and behavior, and is considered the founder of neurogenetics in Germany. Out of his approximately 182 research articles, 12 highly cited papers on visual behavior appeared in JCPA.\n\nRoland Hengstenberg (1940–2004) was born in Esslingen, Germany and studied biology, chemistry, geography, and philosophy at the Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, the University of Stuttgart, and the University of Tübingen. In 1963, he passed the first state examination for teaching at high schools but was clearly more inclined to research than to teaching. In 1971, he earned his PhD in zoology, botany, and chemistry at the University of Tübingen and then pursued postdoctoral training at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories. Consecutively, he worked as a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tübingen. From 1976–79 he was member of the Scientific Council of the Max Planck Society and from 1981–82 he visited the Australian National University. Hengstenberg devoted his research to gaze stabilization systems that have evolved during evolution in all animal groups with high mobility and good vision. He investigated the eye movements in flies that are necessary to reduce the image speed on the retina enabling acceptable vision even during faster body movements and identified the neurons that are responsible for extracting specific rotational movements from the optic flow field during flight as well as the mechanisms that keep flight stable. Furthermore, he worked with Gerbera Nalbach* on the halteres of the blowfly. These results were published in six highly cited articles in JCPA that appeared from 1982–94.\n\nHorst Hertel (1945-) was born in Groß-Gerau, Germany. From 1966–71, he studied biology at the Technical University of Darmstadt. For his diploma thesis and dissertation supervised by Randolf Menzel*, he studied the spectral sensitivity of a rotifer and characterized the compound eye of brine shrimps for which he received his Dr. rer. nat. in 1976. In 1976, together with Menzel, he moved to the Free University of Berlin and as research associate, and later assistant professor, focused on the mechanisms of color vision in honeybees using intracellular recordings. He received his Habilitation in 1988. In 1987, Hertel took a position at the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing in Berlin, while still remaining adjunct professor at the Free University. At the Federal Institute he became director of the Expert Group in Biology and was involved in developing tests for and protection measures against wood-destroying organisms such as termites, beetles and fungi. These activities included basic research, including behavioral studies on relevant species such as termites and the European house borer. Hertel retired in 2010. He has authored six highly cited articles in JCPA on peripheral and central mechanisms of color vision in honeybees.\n\nJohn G. Hildebrand (1942-), born in Boston, is the international secretary of the National Academy of Sciences (US) and Regents Professor Emeritus of Neuroscience and Honors Professor at the University of Arizona. He earned his BA in biology (1964) at Harvard University, mentored by John Law and Konrad Bloch, and his PhD in biochemistry (1969) at Rockefeller University, mentored by Leonard Spector and Fritz Lipmann. Hildebrand pursued postdoctoral work in neurobiology (1969–71) with Edward A. Kravitz at Harvard Medical School. There he studied the operation and distribution of neurotransmitters in the lobster nervous system. Hildebrand held faculty positions at Harvard Medical School (1976–80) and at Columbia University (1980–85) before joining the University of Arizona in 1985 as the founding Director of the Arizona Research Laboratories, Division of Neurobiology. Here, he created a unique and highly acclaimed center for neuroscience focusing on insect nervous systems. Two of his trainees (Thomas Christensen* and Uwe Homberg*) are included here among the Top 100 Authors. He remained at the University of Arizona as professor of neuroscience, chemistry & biochemistry, ecology & evolutionary biology, entomology, and molecular & cellular biology until his retirement in 2022. Hildebrand is an elected Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2001), American Association for the Advancement of Science (1986), American Philosophical Society (2014), Entomological Society of America (2008), International Society for Neuroethology (2012), and the Royal Entomological Society of London (2012). He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences (elected 2007) and the German National Academy of Sciences ‘Leopoldina’ (1998), and a foreign member of both the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (1999) and the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters (2011). He served as president of the International Society for Neuroethology (1995–98) and as an associate editor of JCPA (1990–2021). He is also known as an accomplished trombonist, and once considered a professional career in music. Hildebrand’s research program focuses on chemosensation in insects, particularly the giant sphinx moth. His work exploits and integrates anatomical, behavioral, chemical, molecular, and neurophysiological methodologies to elucidate the molecular biology, physiology, and function of olfactory behaviors. His 22 papers in JCPA present new findings on sex pheromones, chemical preferences, odorant receptors, interneuron diversity, and antennal lobe morphology in beetles and moths. A tribute to Hildebrand and his work, published in JCPA in form of a Special Issue entitled Insect Chemoreception (Volume 199, Issue 11, 2013), was edited by Wolfgang Rössler and Monika Stengl.\n\nUwe Homberg (1953-) was born in Wuppertal, Germany. From 1972–78, he studied biology, first at the Technical University of Hannover, then at the Free University of Berlin where he completed his Diplom (master’s) thesis in the lab of Randolf Menzel*, supervised by Joachim Erber*. He then stayed on at the Free University and performed his PhD thesis research under the mentorship of Erber. After the award of a PhD in 1982, Homberg assumed various academic positions at German and U.S.-American institutions, including the Technical University Berlin, Columbia University, the University of Arizona, the University of Konstanz (where he received his Habilitation in zoology in 1992), and the University of Regensburg. During these years, his work in the laboratory of John G. Hildebrand* was particularly formative. In 1997, Homberg was appointed to a professorship at the Philipps University of Marburg, from which he retired in 2021. Throughout his scientific career, his research was guided by the goal to decipher the general principles of the structure, function, and development of the insect brain. Major topics have included elucidation of sensory control of spatial orientation and navigation; neural analysis of polarization vision; exploration of mechanisms of circadian rhythms; investigations of structure and function in olfactory systems; and brain mapping of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. He has frequently addressed these aspects within a comparative framework. The success of his research program is reflected by more than 170 original papers, review articles, book chapters, and books, and by the over 12,000 citations that these publications have attracted. Homberg has been a member of the Editorial Board of JCPA since 2012. In addition to 19 journal articles, his contributions to JCPA include the editing of two Special Issues, one entitled Visual Circuits in Arthropod Brains (Volume 206, Issue 2, 2020) and a second, jointly edited with Keram Pfeiffer, titled Unravelling the Neural Basis of Spatial Orientation in Arthropods (Volume 209, Issue 4, 2023).\n\nGeorge Adrian Horridge (1927-, born in Sheffield, UK) is emeritus professor of neurobiology (Research School of Biological Sciences) at the Australian National University. Horridge is a foundational figure in the field of insect vision, and the research environment he created in Australia was the internationally leading center in this field for over three decades. Horridge was educated at the University of Cambridge, first as an undergraduate and then as a postgraduate (earning a PhD there in 1953). He was appointed a Fellow of St. John’s College Cambridge in the same year. From 1960–69, he was the director of the Gatty Marine Laboratory at the University of St. Andrews, before becoming a founding professor at the newly established Research School of Biological Sciences at the Australian National University in 1969. During his early years at the Gatty Marine Laboratory, Horridge teamed up with Theodore H. Bullock* to write the monumental two-volume “bible of invertebrate neurobiology”, Structure and Function in the Nervous System of Invertebrates (Freeman, 1965), which remains a classic today. Horridge has been the recipient of numerous honors, among these Fellowships of the Royal Society of London, the Australian Academy of Science (1971), and the Centenary Medal from the government of Australia (2001). He has also been awarded a Centenary Medal “for service to Australian society in the biological sciences”. The list of his trainees and collaborators comprises many distinguished scientists, including 10 of the Top 100 Authors—Roger Clayton Hardie*, Almut Kelber*, Michael Land*, Simon Laughlin*, Randolf Menzel*, Daniel Osorio*, David C. Sandeman*, Mandyam V. Srinivasan*, Doekele Stavenga*, and Eric J. Warrant*. After retirement, Horridge became interested in the visual system of the honeybee, and performed a large number of behavioral experiments on bees in his garden. This work has resulted in several papers in JCPA and three books: The Discovery of a Visual System: The Honeybee (CABI, 2019), Honeybees Vision: Recent Discoveries (Northern Bee Books, 2021) and How do Bees (and Humans) see Grey Levels? (Northern Bee Books, 2023).\n\nRonald R. Hoy (born 1939, Walla Walla, Washington) is Dr. David and Dorothy Joslovitz Merksamer Professor of Biological Science Emeritus at Cornell University. He received his undergraduate degree in zoology and psychology (1962) at Washington State University where he worked with Leonard Kirschner. His graduate training took place at Stanford University, where he received his PhD in biology (1968) under the direction of Donald Kennedy. Hoy’s dissertation research used neurophysiological techniques to examine degeneration and regeneration in crayfish motor neurons. He pursued postdoctoral studies with David Bentley at the University of California Berkeley (1969–71), studying the development of neural circuits in crickets and the neurobiology of cricket song. In 1973, Hoy joined the faculty at Cornell University (Department of Neurobiology and Behavior), where he spent the rest of his academic career. In 2002, he was named Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor, a position he held until 2006. Hoy’s laboratory exploited behavioral and electrophysiological techniques to analyze sensory processing and communication in insects, including several species of crickets, spiders, treehoppers, flies, and mosquitos. Based on this work, he designed and patented a directionally-sensitive miniature microphone with the potential to improve hearing aids for humans. Hoy is committed to teaching. Even after retiring from Cornell in 2021, he continues to offer courses such as ‘Music and the Brain’, drawing on his scientific expertise and his long-standing interest in music. He and his collaborators developed CRAWDAD, a series of laboratory exercises for undergraduate students using crayfish as a model system for teaching neurophysiology. For several years (1979–84), Hoy directed the Neural Systems and Behavior course at the Marine Biological Laboratory. He was honored with the Neuroscience Educator of the Year award (2004) from the Association of Neuroscience Departments and Programs, and a Lifetime Award for Contributions in Neuroscience Teaching (2006) from the Society for Neuroscience. Hoy is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1986) and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2010). He is a lifetime trustee of the Grass Foundation for Neurobiology and of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. His 20 publications in JCPA include behavioral and neurophysiological studies of ultrasound-induced acoustic startle in crickets as a countermeasure to predation by echolocating bats, the use of phonotaxis to examine acoustic cues necessary for species recognition, directional sensitivity of insect hearing and vibratory organs, temperature coupling in cricket communication, and the use and processing of visual signals by jumping spiders.\n\nFranz Huber (1925–2017; for an obituary see Barth 2017) was born in Nussdorf near Traunstein, Germany. He grew up on a farm, where animals were an integral part of his life. In 1947, he enrolled at LMU Munich to study biology, chemistry, and physics. Five years later, he completed his doctoral thesis under the mentorships of Werner Jacobs and Karl von Frisch*. In his thesis research, he succeeded in eliciting complex song patterns by applying lesions to specific, tiny areas of the brain in the field cricket— then a groundbreaking achievement. Subsequently, as a scientific assistant of Franz Peter Möhres at the University of Tübingen, he was the first to conduct focal brain stimulation experiments in insects. He had learned this rather novel technique during a research visit to the University of Zurich in 1956, where Walter Rudolf Hess had developed it for his famous studies of the functional organization of the feline diencephalon. Brain-stimulation and brain-lesioning experiments also formed the basis for Huber’s Habilitation at the University of Tübingen in 1960. Other scholars who had a lasting influence on Huber were Kenneth Roeder of Tufts University, who had paved the path to relating nervous system function to behavior in insects, and Theodore H. Bullock*, from whom he learned intracellular recording techniques during a visit to the University of California Los Angeles. In 1963, Huber was appointed to a full professorship at the University of Cologne, and in 1973 he became director at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Seewiesen, where he remained until his retirement in 1993. His accomplishments have been recognized by numerous awards, including the Karl Ritter von Frisch Medal of the German Zoological Society. He was a member of the German National Academy-Leopoldina, the Academia Europaea, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the German Zoological Society. In 2016, he was elected a Fellow of the International Society for Neuroethology. The integrative approach employed by Huber and his students pioneered the study of neural control of behavior at the level of single nerve cells and neural networks in insects. Several of his books have become must-reads for neuroethologists, including Cricket Behavior and Neurobiology (together with Thomas Edwin Moore and Werner Loher, Cornell University Press, 1989) and Acoustic Communication in Insects and Anurans (together with H. Carl Gerhardt*, Chicago University Press, 2002). Huber published 19 papers in JCPA; their impact is reflected by the well over 1600 citations they have attracted.\n\nPhilip H.-S. Jen is professor emeritus of biological sciences at the University of Missouri. Born in Taiwan, he moved to the US to study auditory neuroscience with Nobuo Suga at Washington University. Jen received his PhD in 1974. His graduate research examined the tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex in constant-frequency echolocating bats, and described how Doppler shifts are encoded in the bat’s peripheral and central auditory systems. From 1982 until his retirement in 2012, Jen was a faculty member in the Division of Biological Sciences at University of Missouri. He was also affiliated with Central China Normal University (2001–12) and National Taiwan Normal University (2008–09), and is currently conducting studies at Binzhou Medical University on hearing sensitivity in humans. Jen is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2001). He was an early investigator of descending input to the inferior colliculus from the cortex, which affected subsequent ascending signals. His 24 papers in JCPA describe the neurophysiology of hearing and echolocation in frequency-modulated echolocating bats. This work uncovered how the auditory midbrain and cortex code the direction, spatial position, frequency structure, and duration of complex echolocation signals, how these processes are affected by inhibition, and how the cortex modulates activity in the midbrain.\n\nWilliam T. Keeton (1933–1980) was born in Roanoke, Virginia (for an obituary see Emlen 1981). He attended the University of Chicago from which he received both bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees. He then pursued a master’s degree in entomology at Virginia Polytech Institute. In 1956, Keeton arrived at Cornell University, where he worked under Howard E. Evans on millipede systematics. Upon earning his PhD in 1958, he joined the faculty of the Department of Entomology at Cornell. During the following years, he established his reputation as a leading expert in milliped research. In 1965, he moved from the Department of Entomology into the Section of Neurobiology and Behavior, which he had helped create, and where he trained Melvin Kreithen*. Building upon his childhood hobby—keeping and racing homing pigeons—Keeton developed a vigorous research program for exploring the behavioral processes that enable pigeons to find their way home. As a milestone achievement, he discovered that under overcast skies, when celestial cues are no longer available for orientation, pigeons can still home. Keeton obtained experimental evidence that geomagnetism was involved in this ability. He demonstrated that test pigeons perform much more poorly than control pigeons in selecting the homeward direction when small bar magnets were attached to their bodies before they were released. This discovery not only opened new avenues for research into magnetoreception and magnetic orientation but also indicated the inherent difficulty of revealing orientation mechanisms in migrating and homing animals by the presence of multiple orientation systems with substantial redundancies. Besides his pioneering work on animal navigation, Keeton was also a popular teacher at Cornell. He spent several years of his career translating his profound expertise as a lecturer into a textbook, Biological Science (W.W. Norton). Between its first publication in 1967 and his death in 1980, this textbook appeared in three highly successful editions. The 10 papers that Keeton published in JCPA have attracted on average over 70 citations per article, underscoring the impact of his work on the research of his peers.\n\nAlmut Kelber (1962-) is currently director of Research Grants at the Human Frontiers Science Program in Strasbourg, and an adjunct professor of sensory biology at the Lund Vision Group at the University of Lund. After her education in Germany (at the University of Tübingen for both her undergraduate degree in 1989 and her PhD in 1993), Kelber pursued postdoctoral training with George Adrian Horridge* at the Australian National University (where she studied butterfly color vision). She then moved to the Lund Vision Group in Sweden to work on nocturnal vision in moths and bees with Eric Warrant* (in 1999). In Lund, Kelber soon established an independent group, eventually becoming professor and finally research dean at the Faculty of Science. She joined the Human Frontiers Science Program in 2020. She is very well known for her influential work in comparative color vision, particularly in butterflies, moths, amphibians and birds, in which she has combined quantitative behavioral experiments to elucidate the color vision abilities of the animals she studies, with rigorous modelling of the underlying visual signals generated in the different spectral classes of photoreceptors. Kelber is particularly well known for her work on color vision in dim light, and for discovering the first nocturnal animal known to have color vision (a nocturnal hawk moth). Her many well-cited papers in JCPA reveal the breadth of her research interests, with papers on color vision, spatial vision and temporal vision in both birds and insects, as well as papers on how visual and olfactory cues are used by insects during foraging.\n\nManfred Kössl (1958-), born in Munich, is Head of Neurobiology and Biological Sensors at Goethe University Frankfurt. He studied biology and physics at LMU Munich and the University of Tübingen from 1977–87. His doctoral thesis examined frequency processing in the peripheral auditory system of bats. With support from the German Research Foundation, he undertook postdoctoral training (1988–90) with Ian R. Russell at the University of Sussex, studying hair cell physiology. From 1990–97, Kössl worked as a research assistant at the Zoological Institute of LMU Munich. He completed his Habilitation in neurobiology in 1994. In 1997, he became Heisenberg Fellow of the German Research Foundation at the Zoological Institute of LMU Munich. From 1991–2006, he took yearly trips to Cuba and to Jamaica to study bats. Kössl became professor of neurobiology at the Zoological Institute of Goethe University Frankfurt in 2001. There he established a diverse and productive auditory research group that undertakes broad, comparative behavioral and neurobiological analyses of bat echolocation and of insect hearing. He served as director of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Neuroscience at Goethe University from 2012–18. Kössl’s 28 papers in JCPA describe cochlear organization and the acoustic fovea in constant-frequency bats, cochlear sensitivity and active hearing in insects (moths, crickets, locusts), the development of objective methods for quantification of auditory brainstem responses, evolutionary adaptations for echolocation and for insect countermeasures, and the functional organization of the central auditory system in several species of bats for processing spectral and temporal properties of echolocation sounds.\n\nMelvin L. Kreithen (1941–1997) was born in Philadelphia. He received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Maryland (1968) and, under the mentorship of William T. Keeton*, a PhD from Cornell University (1974). He remained at Cornell as a research associate (1974–80), then accepted a faculty position in biology at the University of Pittsburgh (1980), where he remained until his death. He was a member of the American Racing Pigeon Union (1992–97) and was on the advisory panel of United States Windpower (1992–97). Kreithen’s research focused on the identification and quantification of sensory cues used by pigeons and by monarch butterflies to control navigation, homing, orientation, and migration. He was involved in efforts to limit hazards to flying birds due to aircraft and wind turbines, and held a patent for a novel deterrent device. Kreithen published six papers in JCPA. Some of these used operant conditioning methods to demonstrate that homing pigeons detect polarized light, atmospheric infrasound, and changes in magnetic cues. He also examined the role of olfactory cues in pigeon homing behavior.\n\nMichael Land (1942–2020; for an obituary see Marshall and Cronin 2021) was a foundational figure in comparative physiological optics and the study of eye movements in animals. He was educated at the University of Cambridge (with a degree in zoology in 1963) and he completed a PhD at University College London in 1968. Following an assistant professorship at the University of California Berkeley, Land returned to the UK in 1971, helping John Maynard Smith establish a new Department of Neurobiology at the University of Sussex. Land eventually became a professor there in 1984, and trained, among others, Jochen Zeil*. He has received numerous honors, among these fellowships of the Royal Society of London (at the age of 39, one of the youngest elected in the Society’s history), and the Acadaemia Europaea (1998). He was awarded the Rank Prize ( 1998), and elected as Fellow of the International Society for Neuroethology (2012). Land’s work revealed the remarkable optical mechanisms that have evolved in animal eyes, and was responsible for describing several previously unknown eye types in nature. He worked mostly on invertebrates, discovering the concave mirror eyes of bivalve mollusks, the reflecting superposition eyes of decapod crustaceans, the unusual moveable retinas of jumping spider principal eyes, and the afocal optics of butterfly apposition eyes (with Dan-Eric Nilsson and Joe Howard). His work also revealed how the basic optical designs of eyes can be molded by evolution to match animals to their lifestyles and habitats, a field known as ‘visual ecology.’ Land’s work on the optical mechanisms of eyes—much of it published in a large number of highly cited papers in JCPA—was paradigm-shifting and revealed the stunning variety of eyes that have evolved on our planet. His work culminated in two classic books on the eyes of animals: Animal Eyes (with Dan-Eric Nilsson; Oxford University Press, 2012) and Eyes to See (Oxford University Press, 2018). His later work shifted to the mechanisms and functions of eye movements in animals (including humans), with this work also resulting in an acclaimed book on the subject: Looking and Acting: Vision and Eye Movements in Natural Behaviour (together with Benjamin Tatler; Oxford University Press, 2009).\n\nGerald D. Langner (1943–2016) graduated with a Diplom (master’s) degree in physics from the Technical University of Munich (1971). He received his PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen, under the direction of Otto Creutzfeldt. In 1975, he joined the laboratory of Henning Scheich* at the Technical University of Darmstadt. During a research visit to the Australian National University (1985), Langner and Scheich discovered that the bill of the platypus is an electroreceptive organ, and that these animals can locate objects by sensing electric fields. Langner was appointed to a professorship in neurobiology at the Technical University of Darmstadt in 1988, a position he held until his retirement in 2008. One year before his death, he published The Neural Code of Pitch and Harmony (Cambridge University Press, 2015), in which he proposed a temporal-based neural mechanism of music perception. Langner’s eight papers in JCPA quantify responses of central auditory neurons in chicks, guinea fowl, and gerbils to complex sounds including species-specific vocalizations. He also contributed a study of sound sensitivity in the human auditory cortex based on magnetoencephalography.\n\nSimon Laughlin (1947-) is emeritus professor of neurobiology, and professorial Fellow of Churchill College, University of Cambridge. He was educated at the University of Cambridge (undergraduate degree in zoology in 1967) and the Australian National University (PhD 1974), where he studied with George Adrian Horridge*. Laughlin stayed at the Australian National University until 1984, when he returned to the University of Cambridge. He became professor of neurobiology there in 2004. Laughlin was awarded a Rank Prize Research Professorship in Optoelectronics (1999–2004) for work on the biological processing of images, and a Distinguished Fellowship at the Sage Center for the Study of the Mind at the University of California Santa Barbara (2019). He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of London (2000). He is renowned for his work to uncovering the principles of early visual processing, particularly in insects, and how these principles are matched to the ecologies of insects. Throughout his career, he has been fascinated by how the acquisition of visual information is shaped by the statistical properties of natural scenes and constrained by the optical and neural designs of the eye and its visual cells (with several well-cited papers in JCPA on these topics). He was the first to ask how much visual information actually costs in terms of the number of ATP molecules expended to acquire it, and showed that this expenditure ultimately limits the size of the eye and thus plays a major role during the evolution of vision (and indeed of other senses). Many of these ideas were summarized in his acclaimed book, Principles of Neural Design (together with Peter Stirling; MIT Press, 2015).\n\nMartin Lindauer (1918–2008; see obituary by Wehner 2009 and a laudation on his 80th birthday by Barth 1999) was a leading light in the discovery of how honeybees communicate and learn, sense the world, find their way, and live in societies. He was born in a small village in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps as the 11th of 15 siblings. Shortly after his successful Matura (high school diploma) degree in 1939, the Second World War broke out and he had to join the army. In 1942, he was released from the army after suffering a severe injury and then started to study biology at LMU Munich. He became a PhD student of Karl von Frisch* from 1945–47 and then his scientific assistant, first in Graz and from 1950 onward in Munich until von Frisch retired in 1958. In 1963, Lindauer accepted an offer from Goethe University Frankfurt and worked there as a professor at the Zoological Institute until 1973, when he joined the University of Würzburg. He remained in Würzburg until his retirement in 1987. Lindauer has been awarded many honors, including honorary doctorates from the Universities of Zürich, Umeå, and Saarbrücken, the Order of the Federal Republic of Germany first class, and the Bavarian Maximilian Medal. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1962), the American Philosophical Society (1976), and the US National Academy of Sciences (1976). For many years, Lindauer had a close relationship to JCPA, not only as author but also as co-editor. He published 20 papers in JCPA. The topics of sensory and behavioral biology were always in the forefront of the journal and of his research interest, especially the topics of communication among bees and their orientation. Research on temperature regulation, water balance and division of labor in the bee colony, orientation with the help of the solar compass, visual perception of form, perception of the Earth's magnetic field, sense of smell, gravity perception, and the ability of the honeybee to learn and remember would be unthinkable without Lindauer's work.\n\nKlaus Lunau (1953-) is professor emeritus at the University of Düsseldorf. He studied biology at the University of Freiburg. Following projects in nature conservation, he joined the group of Günther Osche in Freiburg and received his doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) in 1988 studying innate preferences of bumblebees for optical flower signals. He then took a position as research and teaching associate with Dietrich Burkhardt at the University of Regensburg, focusing on insect flower interactions and eye specializations in flies. He received his Habilitation from the University of Regensburg in 1995. In 1997, Lunau was appointed full professor of zoology at the University of Düsseldorf. His interest continued to be the sensory ecology of insects, insect-plant interactions, and the evolution of floral traits in animal-pollinated plants, now with a focus on camouflage, mimicry, and odor collection by orchid bees. Lunau published several popular books on these topics as well as 13 highly cited articles on insect eye adaptations in JCPA.\n\nN. Justin Marshall (1962-) was educated at the University of St. Andrews (BSc 1985) and the University of Sussex (PhD 1991), where he studied with Michael Land*. He has been at the University of Queensland since 1996. He is a distinguished neuroethologist and Laureate Fellow of the Australian Research Council at the University of Queensland. Marshall has received a number of prizes and fellowships, including election as Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (2020), the L’Oreal Art and Science Award (2001), the ARC Discovery Outstanding Researcher Award (2012), an ARC Laureate Fellowship (2014), the IEEE Donald Fink award for bioinspired engineering (2016) and the Rank Prize for Optoelectronics (2020). He has made a reputation for his work on vision and visual ecology in the marine environment, and is particularly interested in how vision has been matched to different marine habitats (e.g., shallow and brightly lit colorful reefs or the dim blue featureless world of the deep sea), and to the different visual needs of animals (e.g., in the context of mating, defense and predation). He is best known for his discovery of the world’s most complicated color vision system—the 12-channel color vision of the mantis shrimp, an animal he has continued to study for his entire career. Marshall has also made major contributions to our understanding of color vision in fishes, cephalopods and birds and has made seminal discoveries in the use of polarized light in the marine environment, including the discovery of circularly polarized light sensitivity in the eyes of mantis shrimps. Much of this work is published in well-cited papers in JCPA. Apart from his research, Marshall has been a major advocate for the protection of coral reefs around the world, initiating a highly successful citizen science program (Coral Watch) devoted to monitoring reef health internationally.\n\nMichael Menaker (1934–2021) was born in Vienna and grew up in New York City. After graduating from Swarthmore College in 1955, he joined the laboratory of Colin Stephenson Pittendrigh* at Princeton University. There, he did his PhD on endogenous circadian rhythms of bats and subsequently studied hibernation patterns in bats as a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Donald R. Griffin (from 1959–62). In 1962, Menaker joined the University of Texas Austin and transitioned to studying circadian rhythms in the house sparrow and the golden hamster. In 1979, he moved to the University of Oregon, where he served as directo"
