        "text": "IMB researchers have unlocked crucial molecular secrets of ageing in cells, potentially paving the way to improve quality of life as people age.\n\nIMB is housing a UQ-led training centre to tackle the global crisis of antimicrobial-resistant infections.\n\nIMB researchers have generated transgenic quail embryos to see key developmental stages in real-time.\n\nBacterial biofilms have been linked to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but what exactly are they and how do we get rid of them?\n\nThe ‘electric caterpillar’ is a public menace to gardeners in Townsville and the North-East of Australia but IMB researchers are looking beyond their painful stings to their potential as sources for new medicines and insecticides.\n\nEmeritus Professor Peter Andrews has recognised for his efforts to create and foster the state’s knowledge economy.\n\nResearch into brain cells of mice shows that exercise reverses changes brought about by ageing.\n\nAnalysis of previously unstudied areas of the human genome suggests people with more copies of ribosomal DNA have higher risks of developing disease."
