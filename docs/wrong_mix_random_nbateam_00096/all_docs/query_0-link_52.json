        "text": "Co-authors: Arabella Kyprianides (University College London, UK), Will Andrews (Keele University, UK), Elizabeth Aston (Edinburgh Napier University, UK), Estelle Clayton (Edinburgh Napier University, UK), Megan O’Neill (University of Dundee, UK) and Helen Wells (Keele University, UK)\n\nDriven by social and technological change and the imperative to enhance efficiency, UK police forces have in recent years adopted various technologies to transform their interactions with the public. These initiatives often fall under \"transformation\" agendas with a significant technological focus, promoting \"channel choice\" strategy to facilitate public interactions through various technologically mediated platforms, such as reporting crimes online using form-based or chat functions. Reporting the results of an online vignette experiment, in this paper we consider how people ‘read’ policing interactions involving machines. Participants read a fictitious ‘chat’ between a victim of crime and a police operator identified as either a human or a chatbot. Although the chats, and outcomes, where identical, we find a consistent preference for human operators over chatbots across all scenarios. Human operators were thought to provide clearer explanations, although there were no significant differences in judgements of interpersonal treatment or decision neutrality between human and chatbot operators. Outcome satisfaction was higher when there was a human operator and a proactive outcome. These findings provide a springboard for wider exploration of the possible implications for trust and legitimacy of inserting machines – and potentially machine decision-makers – into police-public interactions.\n\nCo-authors: João Pedro Ramos, Pedro Barbosa and Marta Pinto (University of Porto, Portugal)\n\nDisseminating false or inaccurate information is not new, however, in recent years this phenomenon has reached a different threshold. The speed, scale and quantity of incorrect information being spread has been associated with an unprecedented impact on society and on social cohesion. In this systematic review we conceive misinformation as deceiving information disseminated without the intention of manipulating or causing harm; disinformation as the deliberate use of erroneous information to manipulate, cause harm or confuse people; and malinformation as the dissemination of correct information out of context with the intent to cause harm, manipulate and confuse. As such, the available scientific literature describes misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation (MDM) as being preferably disseminated or spread through social media platforms and those involved seem to be motivated by a wide range of factors. However, for this review, we will specifically focus on interventions that aim to prevent and counter MDM leading to violent extremism. So, this systematic review aims to answer to the following research question: what are the strategies and interventions that are effective in preventing and countering MDM leading to violent extremism? Also, this review aims to understand its impact on two primary outcomes: violent extremism and violent behaviour. Although this review is still in a preliminary stage, it will produce relevant findings at three levels: academia, practitioners and policymakers.\n\nViolent extremists exploit the outreach offered by online social media platforms, engaging with propaganda intended to radicalise and recruit adherents. In a data-driven reality, the creation and dissemination of propaganda become more sophisticated and, inherently, also forms of propaganda that lead to radicalisation and violent extremism. Through massive staging, dissemination, and consumption, violent extremist propaganda reaches more vulnerable individuals online, creating conditions for more radicalisation and recruitment. As a result, many extremist actors are radicalised, recruited, and mobilised online – a disruptive challenge to governments, security forces and civil society organisations. Tackling transnational online violent extremism is a complex and long-term challenge. A growing body of strategies to tackle this phenomenon is being put in place by governments and civil society, highlighting the need for a thorough and rigorous assessment of these types of propaganda. So, how effective are the interventions employed to counter online extremist propaganda? At what time points the interventions to counter online extremist propaganda are more effective? What are the primary outcomes of the interventions countering online extremist propaganda? This systematic review focuses on the effectiveness of interventions at preventing, countering, or responding to online extremist propaganda in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Scandinavian languages. As such, a systematic review needs to be included in research agendas to inform the work of practitioners and policymakers more effectively to prevent, deter, and, when necessary, prosecute those who spread violent extremist content and objectionable material online.\n\nEthnic minority women can be a particularly vulnerable to domestic violence. This vulnerability is linked to factors such as home-country norms, post-migration isolation, limited language skills and visa dependency. This paper discusses the challenges which can be related to ethnic minority women leaving abusive relationships. Drawing on interviews with ethnic minority victim-survivors as well as with relevant frontline personnel, the paper explores both the women’s paths to safety, and the (sometimes deficient) help received from Danish front-line workers. The article posits two reasons why the help may be wanting. First, the individual approach in Danish social work can be inadequate for women who are enmeshed in collective power dynamics. Some frontline workers, for example, do not understand how complex women’s situations are, when issues of “honor” make them threatened not just by husbands but also by natal kin. Likewise, a proposed safety-solution such as cutting all family ties to start living under a new name elsewhere in Denmark, can carry too high costs for women, socialized within collective family cultures. Second, Danish frontline support is national in scope, and thus unable to meet the women’s transnational challenges and needs. In some cases, for example, violence and abuse in countries of origin become part of divorce cases in Denmark. It can be a father being beaten up abroad in order to punish a woman for leaving her husband in Denmark; the ever-present fear of cross-border child abductions; or serious harm levelled at women, if they venture outside Denmark. While the Danish authorities do provide substantial and suitable help to some women, when they leave abusive relationships, other women have to struggle on their own and/or come to face considerable hardships due to a lack of fit between their specific needs and the available support.\n\nThe ban against female genital mutilation was instituted in Sweden in 1982. The implementation of the ban has been analyzed in the research project 'Societal Measures to Identify Suspected Female Genital Mutilation in Sweden: An Analysis of Proportionality in the Authorities' Handling of Suspected Cases' (Sara Johnsdotter & Lotta Wendel, Forte 2019-00657). Our result draws upon preparatory work, public policy documents, insights from 40 interviews with professionals within the police and social authorities, and our archive encompassing appr. 230 police files dating back to the implementation of the ban.\n\nThe analysis of the results is informed by Miranda Frickers concept of Epistemic Injustice (Fricker 2007). She focuses primarily on two injustices: testimonial justice where the credibility attributed to a speaker’s assertion is reduced by prejudice of some kind, and hermeneutical injustice which builds upon insufficient shared concepts or interpretive tropes, owing to hermeneutical marginalization. Epistemic injustice results in wrongs of different kind. Primarily, one is wronged in the capacity as an epistemic subject, e.g. not being noticed, heard or listened to; capacities essential to distinctly human value. Secondly, wrong results in practical disadvantages; failing to convince a public authority, losing benefits etc.\n\nOur empirical material shows that despite well-intented efforts, the evolution of laws and policies surrounding the ban on female genital mutilation has been influenced by bias rooted in outdated cultural perceptions, leading to the perpetuation of epistemic injustice. Professionals who apply these norms, balance conflicting legal principles and interests at the best of their ability, but the results still inflict harms to girls, women and certain migrant groups.\n\nGovernment action plans on violence against women include a focus on honor-related crimes, but for the past ten years there is limited research, and Swedish authorities receive only few reports. There is a large dark figure. In this study, we focus on the honor-related crimes, as defined by Swedish law, that do not pertain directly to violence, or female circumcision.\n\nIn Swedish law, the most important remnant categories pertain to forced marriages, underage marriage, and arranging travels abroad for these purposes. Many of these offenses do not come to the attention of police by victims reporting. Rather, for these offenses, the criminal justice process begins with social workers reporting a suspicion. There is an administrative recommendation for social workers to report suspicion of these offenses, but there is no requirement.\n\nUsing a sample of interviews with social workers, we examine arguments for and against reporting suspicion through a qualitative lens. Our theoretical framework derives from prior studies on reporting propensity and the Blackian concept of social distance and access to law. We present findings in relation to perceptions of costs and advantages of reporting, access to potential witnesses, completion of the criminal process, alternatives to criminal sanctioning.\n\nCo-authors: Anna Jonsson and Henrik Angerbrandt (The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, Sweden)\n\nIn recent years, the involvement of children and young people in criminal networks has become an important policy issue in Sweden. However, there is limited knowledge about how children and youths enter criminal networks and what motivates the recruitment of these young people. This paper is a novel study that addresses that question. It is based primarily on interviews with 28 individuals who have themselves been active members of criminal networks in different parts of Sweden. The majority of participants has experience of both entering networks as children and of themselves involving younger children in the networks.\n\nThe study also analyses age and career structures within criminal networks. One important contribution is that the study shows how the flow of children and youths into criminal networks occurs within the context of drug distribution systems, in which continuous recruitment constitutes part of an established business model. The study shows that children (aged 12–15) are primarily recruited into criminal networks by an older teenager (aged 15-20). This means that the majority of those involved in the lower levels of the network hierarchy engage in recruitment.\n\nCo-authors: Ingryd Silva, Franciane dos Santos, Sarah Menezes, Joaquim Araújo and Thiago de Holanda (Violence Prevention Committee of Ceará State, Brazil)\n\nLiving in a society - under the aegis of monopolistic capitalism that produces, and reinforces social abysses - requires creating survival strategies, especially because this scenario contributes to making peripheral, impoverished, and racialized youth the target audience of criminal groups' recruitment initiatives, which offer short-term financial returns, protection, status, or social recognition. This phenomenon was associated with local gangs, groups that showed a strong connection to their territory and the community and sought to build their self-image and independence. Presently, it is observed that some of these criminal groups, called factions, expand in a dual movement, nationalizing their areas of operation and branching out into small municipalities. It is worth noting that when discussing the affiliation or disaffiliation of young people with factions, it is necessary to consider that sometimes the real possibility of deciding on insertion is not offered, and there is an express prohibition on disaffiliation. This occurs because factions adopt intense strategies, such as taking over new territories, forcibly removing families from housing complexes, and continuously relocating young people themselves to operate in other territories controlled by the group. These groups constantly change their rules; absorb elements of conservative logic; are hierarchically structured; and use threat and torture to ensure the members' permanence. Thus, it is understood that the distribution of income, opportunities, and possibilities of a livable life are selective or limited. For young people who are or have been affiliated with factions, especially those who have already undergone juvenile justice, they become more susceptible to state violence, urban conflicts, and denial of social rights. When they try to break ties with criminal organizations, they end up having their lives interrupted. These are lives carried by the currents of invisibility and the necropolitics.\n\nCo-authors: Chris Devany, Charlie Lloyd and Kate Brown (University of York, UK), Laura Bainbridge (University of Leeds, UK), Ross Coomber (University of Liverpool, UK)\n\nThe emergence of the concept of Child Criminal Exploitation (CCE) has to some extent changed how the police perceive and handle young people that are involved in selling, transporting, or storing illicit drugs in the United Kingdom. Whereas these previously would be perceived as ‘offenders’, they are now, under certain circumstances, perceived as ‘victims of exploitation’, who have been coerced or groomed into drug dealing by organised crime groups.\n\nBased on interviews with senior officers across all 45 territorial police forces in the UK, representatives from national and regional policing bodies, front-line police officers and partner agencies in the statutory and voluntary sector (n=96), this paper explores how the police understand and respond to the involvement of young people in drug markets in the UK.\n\nThe findings point to several complexities in this potential recategorization of people involved in drug supply, and how the participants were engaged in ‘policing’ the boundaries around victimhood. The paper ends with reflections on how recognising victimhood and exploitation more broadly would potentially unsettle deep-seated assumptions within the criminal justice system about culpability and agency of perpetrators.\n\nCounty Lines, a form of drug trafficking prevalent in the UK, has garnered significant attention due to its exploitation of vulnerable individuals, particularly young people. Based on interviews with senior officers across all 45 territorial police forces in the UK, representatives from national and regional policing bodies, front-line police officers, partner agencies and people with lived experience (n=96), this paper explores the multiple pathways into County Lines criminal networks.\n\nRecruitment pathways into County Lines networks are often portrayed to be exploitative and predatory. Whilst this occurs, the analysis reveals that recruitment into County Lines is a complex interplay of social, economic, and psychological vulnerabilities. Factors such as poverty, lack of educational opportunities, family instability, and peer influence contribute to the formation of individual vulnerabilities and the susceptibility of young people to exploitation. Moreover, the allure of financial gain, status elevation, and a sense of belonging further incentivise youth involvement in county lines activities.\n\nRecognizing the nuanced pathways and vulnerabilities involved in recruitment is essential for developing effective safeguarding measures, early intervention programs, and educational initiatives aimed at deterring young people from involvement in criminal networks. This research underscores the importance of addressing structural inequalities that render young individuals susceptible to exploitation, offering insights into pathways for disrupting the cycle of county lines involvement and safeguarding vulnerable youth.\n\nMateus Renno Santos (University of South Florida, USA) and Gary LaFree (University of Maryland, USA)\n\nCross-national homicide researchers have traditionally relied on homicide data drawn from criminal justice records, medical records, or some combination of the two. However, there have been few studies that directly examine the methodological differences between homicide data sources and the consequences of these differences. In the current study we examine the gap in homicide rates for data compiled by the UNODC and WHO. We provide a set of theoretically grounded hypotheses aimed at explaining differences between criminal justice and medical sources of homicide data. Analyzing 1,597 cases for 82 countries from 1991 to 2020, results from ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicate that countries with a great deal of homicides have larger gaps than those with relatively few homicides. According to our quantile regression analysis for panel data models, the divide between criminal justice and medical sources of homicide data declines as medical and criminal justice systems grow more efficient. We also find that the gap in homicide rates narrows as countries globalize. Average marginal effects analysis indicates that health quality exerts the greatest reductions in the homicide gap. These findings remain robust when we use dynamic panel model as a robustness check. Implications for theory and policy are discussed.\n\nCo-authors: Gary LaFree and Yesenia Angelica Yanez (both University of Maryland, USA)\n\nAt the county level, the two primary U.S. homicide measures have historically been based on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports (now the National Incident Based Reporting System, NIBRS) and the Centers for Disease Control's National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). Each measurement approach has unique strengths and weaknesses, documented in previous literature. Among the most notable concerns are the incomplete coverage of the UCR county data (including the Supplemental Homicide Reports data), the distinction between place of residence and place of occurrence in the NVSS, and the differential handling of self-defense cases across both data sources. Researchers have also raised concerns about whether results for the impact of county-level independent variables on homicide outcomes using the two measures will differ. In this paper, we focus particularly on this latter set of concerns. In so doing, we examine the empirical link between several common county-level census variables and county-level homicides using both the UCR and the NVSS at several different time points. In order to provide useful information to homicide researchers, we analyze both data sets in terms of how best practices for researchers downloading data to begin a project. In providing systematic comparisons of the effects of independent variables on two sources of homicide data, we also address several key issues in the extant homicide literature including the: (1) very large number of zero-homicide counties; (2) highly skewed distribution of homicides among counties that have at least one homicide; and (3) widely disparate population sizes across counties. We conclude with implications for the use of counties and county-equivalents as a unit of analysis for homicides along with the measurement of aggregated homicide and its predictors.\n\nCo-author: Meghan L. Rogers (University of Iowa, USA)\n\nPoverty and inequality are frequently found to covary with national homicide rates. Multiple theoretical traditions equate this with the vagaries of market-oriented societies. A similar proposition suggests institutional imbalance resulting from market dominance over pro-social institutions results in higher crime rates. Some traditional theoretical claims and recent empirical findings, however, suggest market expansion may reduce crime and violence. Elias argued economic interconnectedness increases sensitivity to others and demands stable societies. Durkheim maintained that division of labor and greater integration require a dynamic equilibrium that produces fewer offenses against property and the person, especially with the concomitant development of a religion of humanity that privileges the sanctity of the individual. Recent empirical evidence from criminology and economics reveals that greater trade is associated with lower national homicide rates and that market-oriented societies are more averse to unethical behavior. We studied the criminal costs of markets by examining the association between market orientation and national homicide rates. We used data for 1990 to 2020, obtained national homicide rates from the World Health Organization’s Mortality Database, employed the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World index to measure market orientation, controlled for all common structural covariates of homicide rates, and employed pooled cross-sectional models with fixed effects to estimate effects. Contrary to popular discourse in criminology but consistent with the classic theoretical ideas and recent research outlined above, we found that as marketization increases in a nation its homicide rates decline. Our findings, together with prior theory and research, suggests market expansion may reduce violence via the production of state legitimacy and webs of mutual trust.\n\nNumerous studies indicate that legitimacy plays a significant role in shaping the public's response to law enforcement. The primary determinant of legitimacy is the perceived fairness of police procedures (SUNSHINE; TYLER 2003). However, this assertion is challenged, especially concerning lethal force in certain Brazilian regions where abuse is common, and incidents remain uninvestigated. How can legitimacy be maintained? With the Brazilian Constitution assigning the Public Prosecutor's Office (PPO) the responsibility for exercising what it terms \"external control of police practices,\" the question arises: How can this institution contribute to changing this situation? In normative terms, this control aims to shape police practices through an individual and repressive approach. However, its efficacy is debated, evidenced by complaints at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights against Brazil. I suggest that this framework lacks a comprehensive approach. In a previous study, I proposed PPO protocol standards, with guidelines addressing structural, methodological, and investigative aspects, aligning with the Minnesota Protocol and considering the multifaceted responsibilities of the Brazilian PPO. Regarding the perceived fairness of police procedures, there is room for improvement in key structural aspects, which can be addressed through external control. The PPO must advocate for administrative measures within police forces to prevent the abuse of lethal force, covering doctrines, operating procedures, recruitment, equipment, training, and internal supervision. Establishing non-disciplinary mechanisms is crucial for effectively monitoring this issue. These aspects reveal the limitations of traditional remedies for police misconduct, emphasizing the central role of occupational and organizational cultures of police agencies, which must be a central theme in the exercise of external control of police practices (ARMACOST, 2004).\n\nMusic and its significance both within cultures of crime and in penal rehabilitation is gaining increased attention within the fields of criminology and penal studies. This paper explores music therapy as an intervention for young offenders in a prison setting in Norway, with a particular focus on young inmates engaged in the production of rap and hiphop. Drawing on more than fourteen years of experience as a music therapy practitioner and researcher researcher in a variety of penal and forensic psychiatric settings, the author discusses how and why music interventions may be especially relevant in work with younger offenders. Building primarily on findings from a comprehensive ethnographic study of music therapy in a low secure prison in Norway, the paper illucidates the importance of music in everyday prison life with particular reference to issues of identity, relationship, networks and community. In line with a reflexive attitude to the practitioner researcher vantage point the paper adopts a critical perspective in the interrogation of music’s potentials in prison settings. Issues of how music therapy may reproduce stereotypes are discussed, as are the ethics of censorship and uses of music as a form of territorialization. Case examples and vignettes from music therapy practice are employed to illuminate the various ways in which music interacts with broader issues of power, agency, resistance and control. Uses of music in its many forms in prison settings is discussed in light of developments in cultural criminology and desistance research. In particular, the concept of tertiary desistance is linked to notions of musical community.\n\nBody-worn cameras (BWCs) have become a crucial tool in policing activities on a global scale. Despite their growing prevalence, there is a dearth of analyses in Brazil regarding the utilization of BWCs in public safety. Furthermore, certain police agencies have initiated BWC projects without considering the attitudes of officers towards the utilization of such equipment. Understanding variation in acceptance among different groups is crucial in guiding an organization's implementation of BWCs. This study examines the pre-BWC deployment perceptions of a large nationwide sample of police officers in Brazil. The survey engaged over 32,000 police officers nationwide, representing diverse regions across the country. Drawing upon previous research, we investigated officer’s perceptions of usefulness, internal procedural justice, social recognition, and social control. Overall, the results demonstrated a clear division over different regions regarding BWCs support. Police departments located in the Northeast and North regions tended to be more supportive to BWC compared to those in the South and Southeast. Also, the military police agencies were more aligned and demonstrated stronger support for the use of BWCs, comparing to civilian police agencies, which were more heterogeneous and resistant to the technology. Additionally, younger officers and those deployed in operational units have emerged as the primary cohort resistant to the adoption of BWCs. Conversely, positive perceptions of usefulness, internal procedural justice, and social recognition have shown a substantial impact on fostering acceptance of this technology. Finally, this study underscores the policy implications stemming from individual attitudinal shifts toward BWC acceptance across diverse social groups and within police agencies.\n\nSpecialism can be intended as any task that go beyond the traditional day-to-day duties of police officers and is routinely used to handle specific types of crimes, victims, and perpetrators. Despite this, there is lack of clarity around what police specialism should look like in England and Wales, contributing to a climate of shared organisational confusion. For instance, there is little evidence-based understanding of how police specialism affects officers' wellbeing, perceived competence, and performance. Improving the clarity around police specialism is becoming increasingly relevant, especially, as emerging needs for further professionalisation have been clashing with the localist structure of UK police forces - frequently resulting in diluted expertise, duplicated resources and negative effects on the legitimisation of police work. This research links together evidence from the literature and the first-hand experiences of specialism among police officers. The study's aim was to establish what police specialism looks like in practice, adding valuable insights towards academic and police knowledge on the topic, but most especially giving a voice to police officers. The findings highlighted some of the socio-cultural, policy-based information that contributed to the development of police specialism in its contemporary form. A scarcity of original studies published on the topic, showed a consistent lack of appropriate terminology of how specialism is defined in practice and implemented across forces. Overall, common patterns have been identified as for how and why specialist units have been instituted over time. There is also evidence that specialism might impact on police efficacy, and that the specialist knowledge of officers working for within specialist units is frequently inferred– rather than measured. Advantages and challenges of specialism within policing were investigated, to understand if and how specialism could be a tool to restore trust in the police.\n\nThe expectation placed on the police to combat and prevent crime is arguably higher than ever before. In 2022, the Swedish police introduced a crime prevention strategy that includes a definition of police crime prevention work. Previous studies have revealed a disparity between the official definition and how police officers perceive a method. Therefore, this study aimed to explore what police officers perceive to be police crime preventive work by researching how they define crime prevention. Semi-structured interviews with fifteen police officers formed the basis for a thematic analysis of their understanding of crime prevention work. The preliminary analysis revealed a heterogeneous understanding of crime prevention. However, trust was highlighted as one of the cornerstones that enables police crime prevention work. Firstly, trust between police officers and their collaborative partners facilitates the implementation of preventive actions. Secondly, the trust of citizens enables the police to engage in crime prevention activities. Trust facilitates the ability of the police to influence young people who are at risk of criminal behavior, as well as aiding in the acquisition of information necessary for crime prevention efforts. Police officers described trust as being cultivated through the establishment of relationships, accessibility, and justified actions. In conclusion, although the official definition of police crime prevention work may not explicitly prioritize trust, police officers perceive trust as a crucial tool in their crime prevention work.\n\nCo-authors: Lisa Öman Ekervhén (Luleå University of Technology, Sweden), Markus Nyström (Luleå University of Technology, Sweden), Tova Stenlund (Umeå University, Sweden), Martin Carlsson (Umeå University, Sweden) and Paul Davis (Umeå University, Sweden)\n\nA core component of criminal investigation is the investigative interview where investigators rely on an interviewee’s willingness to disclose information. This willingness to share can be heavily dependent on the interviewee’s trust in the interviewing officer and perceptions of law enforcement. Establishing and maintaining trust during an interview thus becomes a vital part of effective investigative interviewing. Swedish police are currently implementing a new model for investigative interviewing which utilizes building trust and maintaining conversational rapport with the interviewee. Previous research has highlighted that facilitating trust and rapport yields more detailed and truthful accounts than interviews using more dominant styles. However, rapport-focused interviewing has proven to be difficult to operationalize and teach to recruits. Our study aimed to understand what Swedish police teachers value as important interpersonal skills for investigative interviewing as well as what strategies and struggles these teachers face when teaching recruits. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six experienced interviewing teachers at Swedish police training programs. The teachers described that taking the interviewee's perspective, accepting responsibility to build rapport, as well as social and situational flexibility were important skills for interviewers to process. When describing their strategies and struggles in teaching, the teachers described the need to: bridge theory and practice; train flexibility through diverse scenarios; adjust to students’ social maturity and ability to self-reflect; and work with limited resources. This study also highlights how interviewing teachers express a need for adequate time and resources to help recruits develop the necessary skills for interviewing. This study contributes perspectives on building trust during information-gathering procedures and highlights what challenges instructors might face during training.\n\nProcedural justice research on policing can be mischaracterized as saying simply that promoting trust of police leads to better outcomes for all residents. Reasonable critics of this framing argue that trusting police does not, in and of itself, reduce racial, class, or other disparities in police behaviors. Further, framing trust as a normative expectation of communities takes on elements of victim blaming in many contexts. And yet, robust findings demonstrate that, where communities trust police, outcomes for most (if not all) greatly improve. How, then, should the field think about the relationship between trusting police and promoting equitable public safety systems? Using data from three experiments and field studies, I argue that trust does not operate only at the level of interpersonal exchanges, but across institutional and structural levels as well. Framed this way, trust can be conceptualized as a public good that must be earned through consistent procedurally just structuring of institutions, policies, and practices, not simply an interpersonal performance or individual opinion that should be promoted. I discuss implications for policy and the future of research in light of this framing.\n\nCo-authors: Adam Fine (Arizona State University, USA), Thiago Oliviera (University of Surray, UK), Ben Bradford (University College London, UK), Rick Trinkner (Arizona State University, USA)\n\nObjectives: The police killing of George Floyd energized the Black Lives Matter (BLM) social movement across the United States. In this paper, we test the impact on public perceptions of the fairness and legitimacy of the police and law. Methods: A four-state, three-wave longitudinal study (N = 1048; Arizona, Michigan, New York, and Texas) measured public perceptions of the police and law before and after the killing of Floyd. Using a novel difference-in-change design, we tested whether public attitudes changed. Results: Fielding multiple outcome markers for perceptions of the police and law, as well as multiple pseudo-placebo comparison variables, we found that perceptions of police procedural, distributive and boundary justice, and perceptions of the legitimacy of the police and law, declined following Floyd’s murder, but levels of trust in science, identification with healthcare workers and collective efficacy perceptions did not. The effects regarding the police and law were not uniform, but rather contingent on whether or not people were likely to vote for Donald Trump in the next presidential election. Follow-up analysis suggested that this was rooted in identification with the police and a denial of the issues that BLM campaigned against. Conclusions: The police killing and subsequent protests seemed to have damaged attitudes towards the fairness and legitimacy of the police and law, but only among non-Trump supporters. There was no effect among those who tended to push back against the idea that policing helps to maintain established racial hierarchies.\n\nIn June 2022, the Government gave the Swedish Centre for Preventing Violent Extremism (CVE) the assignment to develop a support model to strengthen schools’ preventive work against violent extremism and school attacks. This happened in the aftermath of the murder of two teachers by a student at Malmö Latin in March 2022. The support model is made up of a literature review and a conversation guide, providing structure, questions and recommendations how schools and other local authorities can work together to prevent young people from becoming radicalised and committing school attacks. In this paper, we explore the part of the support model that deals with multi-agency efforts. Multi-agency collaboration – whether that is internally between different professions in schools or between different local authorities (such as the social services and the police) – is critical for preventive work, but it is something that many experience as difficult and challenging. In the paper, we draw on experiences from interviews with school professionals during the development of the support model and the CVE’s experiences of working with schools and local authorities. We ask: what does professionals in schools need to prevent violent extremism and school attacks? How do they experience multi-agency collaboration, internally and externally? And what needs to be done – in schools and in society – to make this happen? We end the paper by reflecting on what this could mean for policy and research on how to prevent young people from becoming radicalised and/or committing school attacks.\n\nThe shooting rampage at the Albertville Realschule on March 11, 2009 fundamentally changed everyday life in the town of Winnenden and influenced prevention work at schools in Baden-Württemberg, particularly in the Rems-Murr district. The special committee of the state parliament \"Consequences of the shooting rampage in Winnenden and Wendlingen - youth endangerment and youth violence\" presented 39 recommendations for action in its final report. In addition, the district council of the Rems-Murr district adopted a comprehensive catalog of measures to prevent violence in schools. The presentation shows the measures already initiated by the police, schools and the district before the 2009 rampage and the associated progress in (police) prevention work at schools in the Rems-Murr district. It reflects on the implementation of the measures and their effects as well as the changes in response to the shooting rampage.The measures implemented before the rampage proved to be the right decisions in an emergency. They cannot prevent a lone perpetrator from attempting a rampage at a school, but despite the high number of victims, the good preparation of the police department led to rapid intervention, which definitely prevented an even higher number of victims in view of the ammunition the perpetrator was carrying.In addition, the preventative arrangements with the schools have a positive effect on the early identification of potential perpetrators.\n\nThe latest assessment of the threats against Sweden shows that the broader threat to democracy is becoming increasingly prominent, as (violent) Islamist extremists in various subversive ways such as the spread of disinformation on social media work to increase division in society to overturn Swedish society and democracy. In recent years we have seen several disinformation campaigns targeting Sweden in order to incite Islamist extremist milieus to mobilize (i.e., recruit, motivate, attract and sustain supporters): 1) the LVU-campaign in 2021-2022, 2) the campaign following the Swedish Qur’an burnings in the summer of 2023, and 3) the campaign in connection with the Swedish Prime Minister’s statement on a meeting regarding the Israel and Hamas conflict in 2023. The campaigns resulted in demonstrations and protests (both online and offline) characterized by heightened emotions. Based on an open social media study of accounts on mainstream social media belonging to central actors, groups and organizations propagating radical Islam and disseminating content relating to the recent disinformation campaigns against Sweden, this paper explores the emotive narratives in the campaigns deployed to incite Islamist extremist milieus to mobilize. To understand this the project draws on literature on radical Islam in different Islamist extremist movements (both violent and non-violent) describing their religious/ideological worldview, as well as insights from cultural criminology and narrative criminology. The project contributes significant and urgent knowledge for the research community, as well as practitioners in preventive work, relevant authorities, and the general public. Work in progress.\n\nThe topic of this presentation is an analysis of crime and migration in Poland on criminal and criminological knowledge. Speech will be divided into such layers like: 1. Introduction (terminological clarification: immigrant - emigrant - refugee - foreigner – foreign national); 2. Legal (application of the criminal code to a foreigner in Poland; application of the code of criminal procedure to a foreigner) 3. Statistical (structure of crime in Poland - general analysis; Foreigners in Poland; Structure of foreigners' crime in Poland); 3. Criminological (presentation of the causes of migration crime and tools for counteracting it); 4. Recommendations (presentation how to fight against crime in migration). Crime is a negative phenomenon that occurs in every country and poses a threat to the existing legal order. It encompasses a variety of behaviors, goals, motives and consequences of those involved in this phenomenon. The basis for crime is the social layer of the state, where people commit crimes by violating the existing legal order. Crime can be considered from various perspectives, such as the extent, intensity, variability, structure, dynamics, and the characteristics and background of those involved. Crime is a challenge for society, and effective prevention requires an understanding of the diversity of crimes and the different motivations of perpetrators. Research on foreigners' crime is particularly important in the context of increasing migration from Poland's eastern border. Knowledge of this topic can help develop appropriate migration management strategies and effective prevention and integration measures. It is important to continue research on crime to better understand its causes and effects and to develop effective methods to reduce and combat it.\n\nCo-authors: Dolores Pachecho-Romero and Izabela Zych (Universidad de Córdoba, Spain)\n\nThe inclusion of all children in education is essential for fostering equality and peace among societies. Within this framework, particular emphasis should be placed on ethnic-cultural minority groups. These groups might be more vulnerable to bullying and cyberbullying. Additionally, they might have lower levels of social and emotional competencies, which have been related to a higher involvement in these violent phenomena. The first objective of the present study was to find out possible differences in bullying and cyberbullying involvement between the majority and minority ethnic-cultural groups. The second objective was to find out the possible differences in the levels of social and emotional competencies between both groups. Finally, the study sought to determine whether the level of social and emotional competencies moderated the relationship between being part of a minority group and a higher involvement in bullying and cyberbullying. An ex post facto descriptive longitudinal study was carried out with a representative sample of adolescents in Compulsory Secondary Education in Andalusia (Spain). The self-report questionnaire was answered by 1498 students (51.3% girls) from 21 schools, of which 1195 (53% girls) could be followed up at the end of the academic year. Results showed higher levels of cyber-victimization in the minority group. Lower levels of self-motivation and self-management were also found in this group. Self-motivation and self-management moderated the relationship between belonging to the minority ethnic-cultural group and cyber victimization. These findings underscore the importance of developing diversity-sensitive prevention programs and intervening to promote social and emotional competencies within these populations.\n\nCo-authors: Daniele Negreiros, Mateus Torquato e Silva, Raimundo Madeira, Stella Maris (Violence Prevention Committee of Ceará State, Brazil)\n\nThe subjects of this research were 140 adolescents who had served time in juvenile detention. They are impoverished, racialized and vilified young people, most of whom are criminalized for surviving on the margins of the city. In terms of income, more than half of the participants earned up to a minimum wage (68.00%), with the mother (37.32%) or the young person themselves (32.39%) being the main breadwinners. Most of the young people interviewed had never had access to public policies, be it education, sports, housing, health, or employment, with the exception of government cash transfers, which a significant proportion received. And if they have access to these policies, it is in a precarious way, given the schooling of the young people interviewed, in which 73% did not finish primary school and only 20% finished high school. When we asked the adolescents if there had been any change in their support before and after internment, some said no, it remained the same. This shows that after hospitalization, youth are unable to reintegrate into society or access a support network, be it psychological, social, or economic. Participants answered the following questions on a 5-point Likert scale: \"When I left the detention center, my job opportunities decreased\" (M = 3.43; SD = 1.28; Min = 1; Max = 5), followed by \"Today I take more risks than before I entered the detention center (e.g. threat of death and other territorial conflicts)\" (M = 3.07; SD = 1.48; Min = 1; Max = 5). Therefore, these unsupported young people are sometimes drawn into other sociabilities that crime and its dynamics offer. In short, for our young people to follow paths of life opportunities, it is essential to strengthen policies for education, vocational training, paid internships and recruitment for the job market. To improve living conditions and break the cycle that leads thousands of families into social vulnerability.\n\nI will present a new handbook on criminal exploitation of children and young people. I elaborate on how the recruitment and exploitation of children and young people to commit criminal acts can constitute human trafficking, and what significance this has for children's rights and how we should meet children who commits crime. What significance does it have if others benefit from the child committing criminal acts, and if the child is exposed to grooming, pressure or coercion? What rights do children who are exposed to exploitation and human trafficking have? In order to provide the right help to children and young people who commit criminal acts, it is important to understand what lies behind it. If the crimes committed is not only caused by drug use, behavioral problems or the child’s own desire for profit, but also that it is difficult for the child to withdraw due to pressure, debt, violence or threats, the child may need other forms of protection and assistance. This is important both to safeguard the child's rights and to prevent further crime. Human trafficking is a relevant and important perspective to bear in mind when it comes to children and young people who commit crime.The book contains the results of acquired experience-based knowledge from professionals who work with children and young people involved in crime in Norway (survey with 190 respondents and workshop with 50 participants). Topics covered in the book:- Which recruitment and control means are used in child criminal exploitation?- Who is behind the exploitation?- Which criminal acts are the children exploited for?- How does the children experience their situation (voluntary or forced)?- Which young people are particularly at risk?- How can we prevent child criminal exploitation?- How can we identify victims of child criminal exploitation?- How can we help exploited children?\n\nCo-authors: Kiminori Nakamura and Raquel Hernandez (University of Maryland, USA)\n\nFirearm violence is a major policy concern in America, yet little is known about how criminal courts address these crimes or how their treatment of firearms offenders shapes future violence. The overwhelming majority of criminal cases are settled by plea bargaining, but little is understood about how plea deals impact sentencing and recidivism. Prior work suggests that plea deals can powerfully mitigate punishment, which may diminish deterrence and incapacitation. Conversely, though, imprisonment itself can have criminogenic effects on future offending. This project provides an empirical investigation of the impact that plea bargaining has on sentencing and recidivism outcomes for firearms-involved offenders. We compile judicial case processing and recidivism data from detailed criminal histories for a cohort of over 20,000 firearms offenders in the state of Maryland. The independent variable captures the “distance traveled” in plea bargaining, or the extent to which charge alterations reduce expected sentence severity. We then investigate how sentence reductions impact recidivism for future violent crimes and firearm offenses. Preliminary results indicate pleading guilty has large and consistent effects on sentence severity, significantly lowering expected punishments for firearms-involved offenders. Results for recidivism, however, are less consistent, suggesting the relationship between plea discounts and reoffending is nuanced and may vary across different types of firearms offenses. These findings raise important questions about the public safety implications of plea bargaining in firearms cases. On the one hand, short term incapacitation effects may be compromised by large discounts in prison time; on the other hand, this could be at least partially offset by the avoidance of criminogenic prison experiences. We conclude with a discussion of future research and policy consideration at the nexus of firearm offending, criminal punishment and public safety.\n\nCo-authors: Harley Williamson (Utrecht University, the Netherlands) and Kristina Murphy (Griffith University, Australia)\n\n“How” and “why” people come to obey the police, are persistent questions in criminal justice scholarship. The current paper extends the work of Tankebe (2009, 2013) and others (Akinlabi & Murphy, 2018; Bello & Matshaba, 2020) who have begun to explore the idea that the obligation to obey police can be coerced. In doing so, we compare the predictors of two types of obeyance: 1) the moral obligation to obey police; and 2) the dull compulsion to obey police. While police legitimacy research tends to explore the obligation to obey police more broadly (or the moral obligation to obey police more specifically) (see Jackson et al., 2012 for a discussion), few studies examine the antecedents of a dull compulsion to obey police specifically (for exceptions see Akinlabi & Murphy, 2018; Bello & Matshaba, 2020). We address this gap in the literature by comparing and contrasting predictors of both the moral obligation to obey and the dull compulsion to obey police in a sample of 791 immigrants. In doing so we incorporate concepts of procedural injustice and identity threat. We argue that procedural injustice will elicit feelings of dull compulsion through the mediating mechanism of identity threat. On the other hand, procedural injustice and identity threat will reduce the moral obligation to obey police. Examining these distinct pathways to \"obeyance\" further demonstrates the distinction between the moral obligation to obey police and dull compulsion.\n\nCo-author: Oleksii Serdiuk (Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs, Ukraine)\n\nTyler (2012) argues that legitimacy is a ‘highly desirable feature of social systems’. However, during times of national emergency, ‘the government both most needs the public’s support and is least able to either provide incentives or effectively enforce sanctions’ (Ibid.). Tyler further argues that it is important that ‘public order flows from a shared commitment to the law and the legitimacy of legal authorities’. In this presentation we discuss the issues of police legitimacy in the context of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. During the first year of the full-scale invasion the Ukrainian public afforded the authorities an exceptional degree of trust. For example, KIIS (2023) recorded that in December 2022, 58% of the population trusted the police (compared with 30% in December 2021), with such a high level of trust being unprecedented. It is against the challenging background of war, ongoing police reforms and higher public expectations that we considered the concept of police legitimacy and trust in Ukraine. Employing a cross-sectional sample (N = 15,127) of the residents of Kharkiv region (Eastern Ukraine), we analyse police legitimacy in pre-war and war-torn Ukraine using the four pillars of procedural justice (Tyler, 2011) and the Bottoms-Tankebe (2012) legitimacy model. We discuss both quantitative and qualitative indicators to understand the local crime and order problems as well as public expectations of police in pre-war and war-torn Ukraine.\n\nCo-author: Irit Aizik Inbar (MJB Research Institute, Israel)\n\nBackground: As part of the desire to increase trust and legitimacy police organizations have been concerned with the question of how public participation processes can be made part of police work. Is it desirable and feasible to enable communities to take part in shaping the police’s goals and means? What is the most effective way of creating partnerships? This research aims to inform the design and implementation of such processes.\n\nMethodology: (1) A review of the literature to identify relevant studies was carried out. A systematic search of articles in online databases was conducted. In addition, experts from academia and government worldwide were contacted to identify additional materials; (2) based on the data collected, public participation practices arising from robust studies were mapped and divided into categories.\n\nFindings: Based on the review we present the conceptual foundations of public participation in police organizations. We then identify, for the first time in the professional literature, a typology of ten categories of such interventions, noting the relevant levels of the ‘public participation ladder’ to each category as well as its potential and challenges.\n\nConclusions and Policy Implications: First, public participation processes have considerable normative value in the context of establishing democratic policing and increasing police legitimacy. Second, the review indicates that it is possible to implement these processes even in the context of low trust in the police and profound social crises. Some studies indicate they may be effective in increasing public trust and cooperation with the police and in reducing crime. Third, without appropriate investment of time and resources, these processes do not ensure certain success and may even be damaging in terms of reduced public trust and future collaboration. We identify the organizational and social context variables that should be considered when designing a public participation strategy.\n\nFormer military service personal comprise approximately 5% of the total prison population of England and Wales. When imprisoned, they are in the unusual position of having already experienced life within a Total Institution and may find familiarity in the male-dominated, structured, hierarchical and regimented regime of the prison.Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews conducted in five prison establishments, the study on which this paper is based explores the views, attitudes and experiences of approximately 40 former military service personnel serving prison sentences in England. In particular, it analyses how former military prisoners cope with imprisonment, how they build and maintain relationships with other prisoners and staff and how they perceive the power, authority and legitimacy of the state, all as they negotiate diminished social status and conflicting identities.This paper will present findings from this study which suggest that ex-military prisoners often retain a military identity, carried from the military through to civilian and eventually prison life. This includes a set of cultural norms, values and beliefs, or a “military mind-set”, that tends to promote self-control, self-restraint and an ability to cope with physical and mental hardships, thereby promoting compliance with the prison regime and assisting prisoners to cope with prison life. The findings discussed in this paper could have important implications for the management and rehabilitation of ex-military prisoners.\n\nCo-author: Britte van Tiem (University of Pennsylvania, USA)\n\nPrison climate is a multidimensional construct that incorporates elements of the built environment and the social, relational, and organizational dynamics that play out within prison walls. Recent efforts suggest that these measures have a particular utility in capturing shared, often unobserved, experiences that become meaningful at the prison or unit level. In this analysis, we rely on an administration of the Prison Climate Questionnaire (PCQ) in an American prison located in a large, American state. The facility houses approximately 1,200 men in 14 housing units that differ in terms of staffing, population, and design. We first compare the psychometric qualities of the Prison Climate Questionnaire (PCQ) based on its administration in this prison to previously published psychometric analyses from in 28 prisons in the Netherlands. Results show that the PCQ’s factor structure, reliability, and validity are strikingly similar across the two countries. We next turn our attention to the unit-level variation within the American correctional facility. Employing a single panel analysis, we compare the general population units to four specialized units: Therapeutic Community units, with mandatory, full-time drug treatment programmming; the honor block, that offers additional privileges that must be earned through a history free of misconduct; Little Scandinavia, a Scandinavian-inspired unit that also offers additional privileges but where program participants are drawn from the general population; and the Restrictive Housing Unit (RHU), which is a unit specifically used as a sanction or during an active investigation for serious rule violations. Meaningful differences emerge in this comparison, as in the international comparison, and the implications for both carceral policy and for the experience of living and working in the carceral environment are explored.\n\nCo-authors: Jordan Hyatt (Drexel University, USA) and Steven L. Chanenson (Villanova University, USA)\n\nPrison misconduct includes many behaviors that violate the rules of the correctional facilities in which incarcerated people are confined, and the nature and rates of misconduct are typically used as a proxy measure for institutional safety and the ability of staff to maintain order. In this analysis, we focus on a unique, Scandinavian-inspired living unit in a Pennsylvania prison in which several recent, structural changes – including access to single cells, groceries, stoves, cooking utensils, and unbolted furniture – are typically considered to be safety risks in prisons. Leveraging a causal research design, we assess the impact of these changes on the rate and nature of misconduct in the unit. Prison misconduct is typically explained using three theoretical perspectives: Deprivation theory, which highlights misconduct as manifestations of how incarcerated people respond to the “pains of imprisonment”; Importation theory, which emphasizes pre-institution characteristics, beliefs, and experiences; and Management perspectives, which emphasize prison administrative practices. Here, we consider these perspectives in more detail, with a focus on deprivation and management perspectives in particular. Analyses rely on administrative data from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections on adjudicated misconducts related to behaviors including violence and contraband. Preliminary results suggest that misconduct rates are down, relative to baseline, despite the potentially increased risk introduced to the in-prison environment. We employ qualitative interview data from the residents and staff on the unit to shed light on potential mechanisms behind this pattern.\n\nCo-authors: Ulla-Britt Lilleaas (Center for Gender Research, University of Oslo, Norway)\n\nThree quantitative surveys and one qualitative field study leave little doubt. Young policewomen in particular run and have run a rather high risk of being harassed or being the target of sexual abuse of power by older policemen. Female students at the Norwegian Police University College run the highest risk, along with temporary employed policewomen and women in the operative forces. Police officers will at times be in situations at the crime scene where trust in their close colleague is of vital importance. The situation is most complicated for those who work alongside colleagues that have harassed them or even abused their senior power in order to try to get a sexual relation. The situation is also complicated when your close colleague has witnessed the harassment or abuse of power without interfering; the so-called bystander syndrome. In Norway there has been a similar situation and discussion of harassment and abuse in the Armed Forces. Both categories of security personnel are relying on trust and cohesion in situations where your closest colleague is the one who can save your health or life. This discussion has often been about physical strength; is my female colleague able to carry my body out of the risk zone? Should the discussion also be about motivation and trust? In the Police, the harassment and abuse of power has also proved to be directed towards victims, witnesses and other persons in contact with the police. Needless to say, this also raises questions about trust.\n\nAugusta Zadow was a 19th Century factory inspector who investigated complaints about women's wages, work safety, and sanitary conditions and established the Working Women's Trades Union. In this paper we describe the work of the Magnolia Project, an unincorporated community organisation formed around the values of compassionate justice, to progress the work of Augusta Zadow in a project to support young women who are entering the criminal justice workforce in South Australia. Based on an analysis of the experiences of both prospective professionals and those who already experienced in the sector, this paper examines how people will often seek careers in justice to promote the well-being of others and yet may also experience adversity themselves. We focus on how stress and vicarious trauma may occur because of exposure to workplace hostility, work-related discrimination, and misogyny as part of the everyday role, as well as the impacts of a lack of support from supervisors and alienation from the wider community. These concerns are particularly salient for women in workplaces that are characterised by institutionalised and (hyper-) masculine cultural norms and practices.Our paper aligns with the conference theme in that it is concerned with trust and legitimacy in the criminal justice system – although our focus is on the ways in which new and prospective employees experience trust and legitimacy in their employers. It speaks to the need to ‘step up’ efforts to support young women to have successful and sustainable careers, as well as to develop the systems, policies, and structures that are needed to achieve this. It is only by supporting those who provide services to incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people that substantive cultural change within criminal justice agencies can be achieved.\n\nCo-author: Esther Flanagan (College of Policing, UK)\n\nThis article presents the development of an intervention designed to address sexism and misogyny within policing by leveraging a behavioral science approach. The intervention, known as the \"pulse check,\" employs short, frequent surveys administered to police officers and staff to systematically feedback organizational culture. Team-specific results are provided to supervisors with the aim to empower supervisors to address cultural issues within their teams. Grounded in the COM-B model, the pulse check intervention focuses on enhancing supervisors' capacity, motivation, and opportunity to address cultural problems. It achieves this by increasing awareness of cultural dynamics, both negative and positive, on their teams. Additionally, it seeks to elevate motivation by instilling a heightened sense of responsibility and accountability in supervisors for addressing cultural challenges. Moreover, the intervention aims to augment the opportunity to act by providing supervisors with regular reminders and prompts to take action. This article outlines the development process of the pulse check. This includes the careful selection of metrics to assess cultural dynamics, as well as the targeted communication strategies employed to promote sustained utilization of the pulse check, emphasizing the importance of creating a culture of continuous feedback while ensuring user anonymity. We also discuss the logistical and IT considerations required for effective implementation of the intervention. This article concludes with insights gleaned from a feasibility test, shedding light on the acceptability and practicality of implementation of the pulse check. The results offer valuable implications for the broader application of behavioural science interventions to address and mitigate issues of sexism and misogyny within law enforcement agencies.\n\nCo-author: Theodore Wilson (University at Albany/SUNY, USA)\n\nRecent research has unpacked important within-individual variation in perceptions of police legitimacy throughout the life-course, with particular emphasis upon the critical periods of adolescence and early adulthood (Fine et al., 2020, 2021). This work has both revealed a general decline in perceptions of police legitimacy during adolescence and strong racial variation in both levels and patterns of change in police legitimacy perceptions. What’s yet to be established is how perceptions of police legitimacy update in the wake of both positive and negative experiences with the police during these key developmental periods. We address this gap using data from the Pathways to Desistance Study, a longitudinal study of justice-involved youth in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona. Leveraging a racially diverse sample, we evaluate how legitimacy updates within-individual in response to no police contact, negative police contact, or positive police contact. We also consider to what extent do birth year cohorts moderate the effects of (un)just police experience on legitimacy updating. Preliminary results and implications for future longitudinal assessments of police legitimacy will be discussed.\n\nCo-author: Inmaculada Marín-López (Universidad de Cordoba, Spain)\n\nChild sexual abuse is an extremely harmful problem for individuals and societies including short and long-term detrimental consequences that negatively impact children´s mental, physical, and social outcomes. Nevertheless, there are pressing gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. Among them, it is still necessary to synthesize knowledge on risk and protective factors for child sexual abuse and to understand which interventions and intervention components are effective to prevent or reduce child sexual abuse. Currently available systematic reviews and meta-analyses are valuable to understand different parts of the problem, but it is still necessary to synthesize knowledge using a more comprehensive and broader approach to provide a global panorama of the field. This umbrella review aims to synthesize published and unpublished systematic reviews focused on risk and protective factors for child sexual abuse and effectiveness of interventions against child sexual abuse perpetration and victimization. Specific research questions are: i. What are the risk and protective factors for child sexual abuse victimization and offending? ii. Are the interventions aimed at reducing child sexual abuse and exploitation effective? ii. What are the most effective components of interventions against child sexual abuse? This will be the first umbrella review that includes comprehensive findings of the previous systematic reviews which all focus on some specific aspects related to risk and protective factors and interventions against child sexual abuse. Thus, policymakers will have the opportunity to design new prevention and intervention strategies based on a global panorama that has not been available before.\n\nYouth gangs represent a complex social phenomenon, exhibiting diverse manifestations across different regions and contexts. They engage in a broad spectrum of activities ranging from territorial disputes and organised crime to cultural identity formation. In many parts of the world, these gangs typically emerge as a response to social exclusion, limited opportunities and systemic inequalities, providing marginalised youth with a sense of belonging and solidarity. Their influence extends beyond local communities as their involvement in transnational criminal enterprises poses significant challenges to law enforcement and public safety, perpetuating cycles of violence and instability. In South Africa, gang activity predates the country's transition to democracy and has persisted as a pervasive social issue in the post-apartheid era. Moreover, certain gangs allegedly incorporate elements of the occult and African witchcraft into their practices, generating fear within affected communities. These so-called \"devil-worshipping\" gangs are believed to engage in spiritually motivated crimes, including blood sacrifices, ritualistic animal slaughter and purported communication with demonic entities. Departing from conventional understandings of youth gang behaviour, this paper delves into the unique intersection of spirituality, rebellion, vulnerability and subcultural identity within these groups. Drawing on qualitative data obtained from interviews with a sample of detained offenders and service providers within the criminal justice system, the paper aims to elucidate the enigmatic nature of these subcultural formations. Specifically, the paper will explore the risk factors motivating membership, the unconventional modus operandi of these groups, and their ritualistic practices. The paper seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding \"devil-worshipping\" youth gangs, shedding light on their underlying motivations and operational dynamics.\n\nSince the 1920s, scholars have studied gangs in America as a large-city phenomenon. The study seeks to address a significant gap in the field of gang studies by focusing on gangs and gang activity in rural areas. Based on in-depth interviews of 96 active youth gang members and gang associates in the three rural counties of California’s Central Valley, coupled with field research and data from agency records, this study investigates youths' socialization into street gangs: the pathways lead to gang life, the various rituals of gang initiation, and the impacts of gang membership on gang-related illegal activities. The study sheds light on the youths’ family lives, school experiences, and the ecology of the neighborhoods they live in. Youth gang affiliation escalates gang-related activity to the next level, and there are significant gender differences in gang initiation practices. The study also highlights the features that set rural gangs apart from those in urban areas. Limited social support resources in rural counties are major obstacles to youths' desistance from gangs and pose significant challenges to effective gang prevention programs. While the Central Valley of California serves as the research site for this work, the findings of this study and the implications of these findings in shaping policy are equally relevant to other rural areas in the U.S. and the larger global context.\n\nCo-authors: Renato Roseno, Evelyn Sá Barreto, Clarisse Lima and Rui Aguiar (Violence Prevention Committee of Ceará State, Brazil)\n\nAccording to UNODC, in 2021, Brazil recorded a homicide rate of 21.25, ranking as the 12th country with the highest homicide rate in the world. Amidst a context of high homicide rates, Brazil has experienced changes in the dynamics of victimization, with numbers decreasing in major urban centers and increasing in rural cities. In this scenario, this study aims to explore the dynamics of homicide rates in Ceará, understanding the processes of violence's spread to rural areas and the linking between the increase in deaths of young people. Data on homicides that occurred between 2010 and 2023 were extracted from the Public Security Department's website. The data were analyzed using R software, conducting descriptive analyses, rate calculations, and geospatial analyses. In total, 50,784 homicide cases were recorded, with the majority of victims being male (92.46%), aged between 20 and 29 years old (37.60%), killed by firearms (83.52%). From 2014, homicide rates among people aged between 10 and 19 years old began to increase in rural cities within the state, while receding in the Fortaleza Metropolitan Region by 2019. This dynamic is related to the agreements established between the criminal groups operating in the state, described in the literature as pacification. In 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, homicide rates resumed their increase, showing spatial concentrations in regions that had become routes to drug trafficking, as a result of interventions in the Southeast of the country that blocked access to certain drug export routes. New arrangements in drug trafficking routes lead to an increase in territorial control, especially in rural cities that are crossed by crucial routes. This has led to a substantial increase of violence, with these areas becoming points of conflict. The vulnerability of young people to being recruited by criminal groups further amplifies the risk of homicides for this segment of the population.\n\nCo-authors: Emily Gray and Stephen Farrall (University of Nottingham, UK)\n\nHomicide is undoubtedly the most serious form of violence, resulting in substantial and widespread social, financial, and economic harm. Not only does it result in the physical loss of life, but also in problems for surviving families and friends, the neighbourhoods and communities where the crime was committed, and broader society. Homicide rate in England and Wales had been on the rise since early 1970s (the beginning of the Home Office Homicide Index data). This trend was reversed between the early 2000s and 2014, after which it rose again till 2017 (ONS 2024).\n\nThe current presentation examines the patterns in rising and falling homicide rates in England and Wales across homicide subtypes over a period of four decades (1977-2019) to detect any leading subtypes that drive the overall trend and inform future homicide prevention. To this end, the aggregate homicide rate trends are disentangled across homicide subtypes defined by the following individual level characteristics: (i) demographic characteristics of victims and offenders involved in homicides (e.g. age, sex, and ethnicity); (ii) circumstantial characteristics of homicide incidents (e.g. location, weapon use, alcohol and substance abuse); and (iii) victim-offender relationship and motive. The analysis employs the Homicide Index dataset.\n\nThe study is part of a larger Economic and Social Research Council Secondary Data Analysis Initiative (ESRC SDAI) funded project examining “Contemporary Long-Term Homicide Trends in England and Wales in the Period 1977-2019 and a Comparison with Non- Lethal Violence Trends”.\n\nCo-author: Andy Newton (Nottingham Trent University, UK)\n\nCrime is spatially concentrated at the street segment level and in micro places. This can be explained by specific characteristics of these places at specific time points such as the built environment, pedestrian movement, levels of social cohesion and the greater presence of individuals/premises with enhanced victimisation risk characteristics. This type of spatio-temporal analysis has been applied to explain the crime context of, for example, specific neighbourhoods within cities, transport hubs, retail centres, schools, and the night-time economy. Whilst there is an extensive crime and place literature analysing the spatial patterning and drivers of violent and sexual offences, residential burglary, criminal damage, and vehicle crime, less attention has been paid to an exploration of the spatial dynamics of homicide and near-miss homicide (NMH).This paper seeks to address this relative gap in the literature by providing an analysis of homicide NMH across street segments in Nottinghamshire between 2018 and 2023. Drawing on police-recorded crime data, the paper identifies hot spot locations based on the volume and over-representation of homicide/NMH incidents. The spatial concentration of the homicide/NMH hot spots is then compared to other types of violent offence hot spot to determine the extent to which homicide/NMH incidents are in the same or different parts of cities and towns compared to other types of violent offence. Drawing on a range of open data sources, the paper then utilises elements of routine activities theory, geometric crime patterning, crime generators and crime attractors, and social disorganisation theory to identify the significant factors driving the presence or absence of homicides/NMH within different types of street segment.\n\nCo-authors: Maiju Tanskanen, Sofia Malinen, Anna Raeste, Janne Kivivuori (University of Helsinki, Finland) and Karoliina Karjalainen (Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland)\n\nDespite the established notion of Finland as a country with a relatively high homicide rate largely attributed to alcohol-related killings, it is possible that the current Finnish homicide scene is shifting. Recent research findings suggest that the conventional idea of a “typical Finnish homicide” as drinking-group violence between marginalized men may not fully apply to youth homicides. However, these findings, along with international research literature, demonstrate the significance of drug use in lethal violence involving young people. In order to effectively prevent youth homicide and to mitigate drug-related harms in the society, more research is needed on substance use patterns among young homicide offenders. The current study uses date from the Finnish Homicide Monitor (FHM) to examine patterns of substance use in lethal violence involving young (aged 15 to 29) offenders in Finland during the time frame of two decades, 2002–2022. We describe the use of various types of substances at the time of the offense, observe trends in the prevalence of different substances, and describe co-use of different substances among young homicide offenders. In particular, we create a data-driven classification of substance use patterns among homicide offenders, comprising also information on substance use of the victim, to describe the general view of the role of substance use in youth-perpetrated homicides in Finland, also in comparison to adult-perpetrated lethal violence. Due to the relative lack of prior research on the role of diverse types of substance use in Finnish homicides, the findings are of critical value in term of development of both crime prevention and drug harm reduction policies.\n\nCo-authors: Darrell Steffensmeier (The Pennsylvania State University, USA) and Gloria Yuxuan Gu, (The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China)\n\nAge is a complex social marker that has long intrigued social scientists due to its association with crime. Western scholars have observed a relatively stable age-crime relationship, where criminal activity tends to peak during adolescence or early adulthood and then decline throughout the life course. However, there are ongoing debates regarding the extent to which this relationship varies across historical periods, geographic locations, and crime types. While some argue for universality and invariancy, others contend that significant variation exists. Central to this debate is the impact of industrialization and development on the age-crime relationship. It is theorized that preindustrial societies facilitate a smoother transition from youth to adulthood, resulting in a smaller proportion of crime committed by young individuals. In contrast, industrialization and post-industrialization processes may exacerbate the stresses and ambiguities of youth, leading to increased juvenile criminality in developed nations. Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of research examining the age-crime relationship across population groups and historical periods, primarily due to the lack of appropriate data. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the age-crime relationship in both the United States and China. China offers a unique research site to do cross-cultural comparisons due to its distinct Eastern culture and ongoing development/modernization. Utilizing the national court judgements database from 2016 to 2018, including reliable homicide statistics, this study examined the age-homicide distribution in China and compared it with Hirschi and Gottfredson's inverted J-shaped curve observed in the United States (using FBI homicide statistics from 2016 to 2018). Through data mining techniques applied to large-scale textual data, this project first provides descriptive age-homicide curves. Further disparity tests revealed significant age-crime variations between the two societies: the age-homicide curve in China exhibits a greater dispersion compared to that of the United States; in China, middle-aged men are more likely to commit homicide, which contrasts with the higher prevalence of youth involvement in homicide observed in the United States. This study provides solid empirical evidence to support the theoretical argument against the universality and invariancy of the inverted J age-crime distribution.\n\nCo-authors: Maria Jung (Toronto Metropolitan University, Canada) and Carolyn Greene (Athabasca University, Canada)\n\nExisting research has found procedural justice to be an important predictor of trust, legitimacy, and cooperation with police across a number of contexts. However, research to date has not explored whether preconceived, non-normative expectations of police treatment prior to an encounter, or anticipatory justice, relate to procedural justice assessments. These expectations of justice are important to consider as they may shape how people interpret police treatment, depending on whether they anticipate fair or poor treatment. Drawing on a sample of 698 immigrants to Canada, we employ a vignette study to examine whether anticipatory justice moderates the effect of officer treatment (procedurally just or unjust) on assessments of specific procedural justice. We find that those who enter a hypothetical encounter with police anticipating greater injustice are more likely to rate the officer as less procedurally just than those who anticipate greater justice, even when they are randomly assigned to a scenario where the officer is described in a procedurally just manner. We further find that anticipatory justice moderates the effect of officer treatment (just or unjust) on perceptions of specific procedural justice. In this way, anticipatory justice appears to serve as a lens through which people view their encounters with police. As the first experimental test of anticipatory justice, the results of this study suggest that we need to better understand how differing expectations of treatment may impact on whether procedural justice, even when given, can be received.\n\nCo-authors: Ben Bradford (University College London, UK) and Clifford Stott (Keele University, UK)\n\nIn policing large-scale demonstrations, maintaining trust and legitimacy is paramount for law enforcement agencies to encourage compliance from the crowd. Failure to adequately justify the use of force could eventually escalate tensions and lead to more violent confrontations with protestors. Embedded within the recent Israel-Palestine conflict that has triggered various mass demonstrations in London, this study aims to explore the impact of social identity on individual’s perceptions of police actions and government response. By conducting an online survey with 150 participants in the UK, we seek to understand how social identification with the protestors can shape individuals' perception of procedural justice and legitimacy of the police actions, as well as satisfaction regarding the government’s response to the issue. Our findings show that social identification significantly influences how individuals perceive both police actions and government responses, with participants identified with the pro-Palestine side viewing police actions as less procedural fair and less legitimate, compared to their pro-Israel and neutral counterparts. Moreover, our path analysis suggests that police legitimacy is a significant factor in predicting and mediating the effect of their satisfaction with the government’s response. Not only do our findings support the Group Engagement Model that the relational identification with the police mediates the effect of procedural justice on legitimacy, but it also extends the theoretical framework to include individuals' perceptions of the government. While most policing research on procedural justice and legitimacy focuses on interpersonal interaction between the police and those being policed, this research contends that studying the wider socio-political context is critical for a comprehensive understanding of how contextual intergroup relations can influence individuals' perception of fairness and legitimacy.\n\nIn the early 1970s, US prisons largely abandoned their rehabilitative focus and entered an era of mass incarceration. Increasingly overcrowded prisons were transformed into dehumanized, punishment-oriented regimes plagued with violence. Facilities increasingly relied on long-term isolation (“solitary confinement”) for all manners of disruption in the general prison population despite its adverse health impact on both incarcerated people and prison staff. US correctional officers now have the lowest average life expectancy of all U.S. professions (~59 years) and are experiencing an epidemic of poor health, substance use disorders, and suicide. Amend, launched in 2015, is a public health and human rights partnership between the medical school at the University of California San Francisco and the Norwegian Correctional Service designed to adapt public health principles and international best practices for use in US prisons from maximum security through reentry units. We draw on public health, medical ethics, occupational health, and international best practices to inspire and train U.S. prison staff, leaders, and policy makers to transform US prisons for the better health and well-being of staff and incarcerated people. This presentation will describe Amend’s success in disrupting the use of long-term solitary confinement for people with histories of violence in 14 maximum security US prisons across 3 states using the “Resource Team” model, an approach adapted from the Norwegian Correctional service. We will (1) introduce the partnership between the Norwegian Correctional Service and Amend to reduce harm in US prisons; (2) describe the Resource Team approach to dramatically reducing isolation in restrictive housing units; (3) present the impact of the Resource team model on the health of incarcerated people and staff in 14 prisons across 3 states; and (4) discuss the importance of international collaboration in the transformation of prison cultures and our plans for adding new international partners.\n\nAs U.S. prison conditions worsen, policymakers, practitioners, and the public have called for greater accountability and evidence-based policies to enhance safety in prisons. Unfortunately, few empirical assessments comprehensively explore the full nature of prison safety, including the sources and consequences of violence and how various forms of prison contact shape safety and security within institutions. With the support of Arnold Ventures, researchers are collaborating with the Prison Violence Consortium to better understand prison safety by: (1) Creating a framework for reducing and preventing prison violence and (2) identifying a model of family engagement in prisons that enhances the safety for those who live and work in prisons. The Consortium is a partnership between multiple state prison systems and correctional experts dedicated to investigating the causes and consequences of prison violence among incarcerated persons and correctional staff. Consortium members include the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry, Colorado Department of Corrections, Massachusetts Department of Correction, Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, Oregon Department Corrections, Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Researchers are pursuing multiple methodologies, including analyses of administrative data, interviews with incarcerated persons, staff, and behavioral health professionals, and a systematic review of policy and training material. This presentation draws on select findings from this collaboration.\n\nSeeking and incorporating the participation of those being studied is essential to research that authentically understands and addresses the needs of those directly impacted. The Prison Research and Innovation Initiative (PRII) aims to both engage incarcerated people, staff, prison administration, state and local actors as partners in the research process and subsequently study the successes and challenges of this approach. This paper examines the structure, activities, and lessons learned when implementing participatory research within prisons. For example, how did incarcerated people and correctional staff develop climate survey questions? How did staff and incarcerated people differ in their perceptions of the same prison conditions? How did research partners work with these populations to develop data-driven innovations to improve wellness for both correctional staff and incarcerated people? This study reports on findings from three waves of climate surveys and stakeholder interviews with representatives from five sites. We share insights from correctional staff and leadership, incarcerated people, research partners, state and local advocates and legislators. The results from this study can be used to understand a participatory approach to research in prisons while also identifying strategies that can yield more credible findings and more impactful engagement with stakeholder partners when conducting research in correctional settings.\n\nCo-authors: Tom Wines, Bobur Rakhmatullaev and Brenda Russell (all The Pennsylvania State University, USA)\n\nThis qualitative research study investigates the persistent challenges and discrimination faced by sexual minority individuals within U.S. law enforcement agencies. Utilizing the Life Course Theory as a theoretical framework, the study examines how LGBT+ officers navigate a profession traditionally dominated by heteronormative values and hegemonic masculinity. The research highlights the chronological age, relationships, life events, cultural context, common life transitions, and social change as significant influencers on the lives of LGBT+ individuals within the police force. The historical context of the study outlines the evolution of the relationship between the LGBT+ community and law enforcement, marked by significant events such as the Stonewall riots and legislative milestones. Despite these societal shifts, the present research reveals that LGBT+ officers still encounter substantial barriers, including harassment, ostracization, promotional difficulties, and even wrongful termination. The study draws on semi-structured interviews conducted with 27 law enforcement officers to highlight these experiences, which are further complicated by factors such as location, department culture, and individual supervisors. The findings show that many LGBT+ officers choose law enforcement careers for the same reasons as their heterosexual counterparts, yet they must often conceal their sexual identity to avoid discrimination, leading to increased stress and disengagement. The police culture is highlighted for its entrenched masculine norms that marginalize and penalize those who deviate from heterosexuality, thus reinforcing the cycle of exclusion and prejudice. This study contributes to the understanding of minority experiences in law enforcement, suggesting that while societal attitudes towards the LGBT+ community have evolved, the policing institution lags behind in inclusivity. This study encourages law enforcement agencies to foster an environment of genuine equality.\n\nExperiencing sexual harassment at the workplace can have a variety of effects. Besides direct ones (e.g. job satisfaction or performance), the mental health can be influenced as well. Although it is known that certain organizational characteristics, which are typical for the police (e.g. toxic, hegemonic or military masculinity norms, gender ratio, power structures and (inadequate) handling of suspected cases of sexual harassment), increase the likelihood of the occurrence of sexual harassment, studies on these issues are still rare in police organizations in Europe. Using data from a quantitative study of 138 police officers of a German metropolitan police organization, hypotheses on the prevalence of sexual harassment in the police force and on the burden of psychological stress and burnout are examined. The descriptive statistics show that both female and male officers are strongly affected by sexual boundary violations (94.7%; 90.0%) within the scope of the one-year prevalence. Verbal forms were frequent (91.3%), but non-verbal (26.1%) and physical harassment (20.3%) also occurred. Female officers scored higher than male officers for every form of sexual transgression recorded. Incidents occurred primarily during daily work and at celebrations and were mostly committed by colleagues of equal hierarchical status. The burnout screening revealed high to very high values for 10% of respondents. Multiple regressions showed moderate positive effects of sexual harassment at work on indicators of psychological strain, with gender only explaining a significant amount of variance with regard to psychosomatic complaints. Sexual harassment at the workplace can therefore be discussed as part of the causal complex for burnout and mental health impairments. Despite the limitations of this study, the high prevalence of sexual harassment at the workplace found in this police organization suggests that this topic is a relevant problem for police officers.\n\nFamily or intimate visits in prison affect the physical and mental well-being of prisoners, the maintenance of family and social ties and, ultimately, their opportunities for social reintegration. Despite the importance of this practice in the well-being of prisoners, there are contrasts between the penitentiary authorities of the countries regarding their levels of permissiveness. The study goals are three: (1) to carry out a systematic literature review to understand the visit impacts on the well-being of prisoners and their social reintegration; (2) to do a comparative analysis of this practice in a sample of countries (Spain, Germany, Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland and the United States -California, New York, Texas and Florida) in order to identify whether: the visits take place at intervals of over one month and their requirements and execution conditions and; (3) to place the mentioned countries on a scale of social exclusion in the theoretical framework of the AP-RIMES+ project. The method used is based on a secondary sources review and an expert consultation. The main result findings show that most countries allow for family visits but not intimate visits, making it necessary to improve prison policies and programs favor visits given their positive effect on reintegration.\n\nThis study aimed to examine Japanese citizens’ attitudes toward sexual offenders and the measures pertaining to such perpetrators. Despite the presence of various policies in other developed countries, there is still no national policy in Japan regarding individuals convicted of sexual crimes. The draft of the Disclosure and Barring Service Act garnered attention in 2023; however, it was postponed until the next Diet session. At the local government level, a limited number of cities, including Osaka and Fukuoka, implemented measures for individuals with criminal records for sexual offenses. These laws require former sex offenders to register with local government offices to receive support for rehabilitation and re-entry, not for community notification purposes. In this study, 431 citizens were surveyed regarding their attitudes toward former sexual offenders in Japan. Participants were recruited via the internet, and demographic variables such as education, age, and family structure were collected. Additionally, participants were asked about their attitudes toward various aspects related to sex offenders, including awareness and agreement with the ordinances in Osaka and Fukuoka, opinions on sentence length, effectiveness of support, potential introduction of GPS monitoring, necessity of registering addresses for support, and necessity of making addresses public for citizens. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to explore the impact of each demographic variable on attitudes toward the measures of former sexual offenders. As results, awareness of measures already in place in Osaka and Fukuoka, specifically for sexual offenders, was found to be very low. Less than 20% of the respondents were aware of these issues. Gender, age, and educational status were found to influence attitudes toward each of the policies studied. The details are reported in the presentation.\n\nCo-authors: Mariano Núñez-Flores and Francisco Yuste-Hidalgo (University of Cordoba, Spain)\n\nCyberhate encompasses any expression on the Internet that deliberately damages the reputation of or instigates violence against a collective identity and its members, often targeting minorities. Cyberhate is present and prevalent globally among adolescents and has negative repercussions for individuals and societies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for empirical evidence regarding predictive factors for cyberhate (risk and protective factors). Recent studies have shown that adolescents’ social and emotional competencies can protect them against cyberhate. The developme"
