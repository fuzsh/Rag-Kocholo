        "text": "25th International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering\n\nAccepted papers\n\nFASE is concerned with the foundations on which software engineering is built. Submissions should make novel contributions to making software engineering a more mature and soundly-based discipline. Contributions should be supported by appropriate arguments and validation. Contributions that combine the development of conceptual and methodological advances with their formal foundations and tool support are particularly encouraged. We welcome contributions on all such fundamental approaches, including:\n\nsoftware engineering as an engineering discipline, including its interaction with and impact on society and economics;\n\nrequirements engineering: capture, consistency, and change management of software requirements;\n\nsoftware architectures: description and analysis of the architecture, e.g., SOA, microservice architectures, model-driven architectures, or software product lines;\n\nspecification, design, and implementation of particular classes of systems: (self-)adaptive, autonomous, collaborative, intelligent, embedded, distributed, mobile, pervasive, cyber-physical, data-centric, or service-oriented applications;\n\napplications of AI to software engineering, including search-based and learning-based approaches;\n\nsoftware engineering foundations for AI-based systems;\n\nsoftware quality: (static or run-time) validation and verification of functional and non-functional software properties (including security and data privacy) using techniques such as theorem proving, model checking, testing, analysis, simulation, refinement methods, metrics or visualization techniques;\n\nmodel-driven engineering: model transformation, meta-modelling, design and semantics of domain-specific languages, consistency and synchronization of models, generative architectures;\n\nsoftware processes: support for iterative, agile, and open source development;\n\nsoftware evolution: refactoring, reverse and re-engineering, configuration management and architectural change, or aspect-orientation.\n\nImportant dates, paper submission and review\n\nSee the ETAPS 2022 joint call for papers. Submit your paper via the FASE 2022 author interface of EasyChair.\n\nThe review process of FASE 2022 is double-blind, without a rebuttal phase. In your submission, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgements that might identify you.\n\nPaper categories\n\nFASE 2022 solicits four types of submissions: research papers, empirical evaluation papers, new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers and tool demonstration papers.\n\nResearch papers clearly identify and justify a principled advance to the fundamentals of software engineering. Research papers should clearly articulate their contribution, and provide sufficient evidence for the soundness and applicability of the proposed approach. Research papers are expected to be 15-18 pages llncs.cls (excluding bibliography). Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix.\n\nEmpirical evaluation papers evaluate existing software challenges or critically validate current proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e., by empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, simulations, etc. Scientific reflection on problems and practices in the software industry also falls into this category. Empirical evaluation papers can be 15-18 pp llncs.cls (excluding bibliography). Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix.\n\nNew Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) papers (new in 2022!) seek to disrupt the status quo with forward-looking, thought-provoking, innovative research on the foundations of software engineering, as well as lessons learned from the past. Our aim is to accelerate the exposure of the ETAPS community to early yet potentially ground-breaking research results, and to techniques and perspectives that challenge the status quo. To broadly capture this goal, the NIER track at FASE 2022 will publish the following types of papers:\n\nInnovative or groundbreaking new ideas at early stages of research, supported by promising initial results and intuitions;\n\nVisions of new directions: synergies with other fields or foundational approaches to problems that currently lack foundations in software engineering;\n\nLessons from the past: thoughtful observations on past or current research directions that may be somehow misguided or that let us see current research directions from a new perspective.\n\nNIER papers are expected to be 6-8 pp llncs.cls (excluding bibliography). NIER papers will be assessed primarily on their level of originality, relevance, and potential for impact on the field in terms of promoting innovative thinking. Hence, inadequacies in the state-of-the-art and the pertinence, correctness, and impact of the idea/vision/lesson must be described clearly. A full evaluation is not required for FASE NIER papers, but preliminary evaluation results may help the reviewers understand the scope of the work better.\n\nTool demonstration papers present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions to an existing tool. They should provide a short description of the theoretical foundations and emphasize the design and implementation concerns, including software architecture. The paper should give a clear account of the tool's functionality and discuss the tool's practical capabilities with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available, preferably on the web. Experimental evaluation is not required, however, a motivation as to why the tool is interesting and significant should be provided. Tool demonstration papers can have a maximum of 6 pp llncs.cls (excluding bibliography). They should have an appendix of up to 6 additional pages with details on the actual demonstration.\n\nArtifact submission and evaluation\n\nAuthors of accepted papers may submit an artifact after notification. The artifact will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee (AEC) independently of the paper according to the following criteria:\n\nconsistent with the paper;\n\nas complete as possible;\n\nwell-documented;\n\neasy to (re)use;\n\npublicly available and persisted.\n\nSubmission of an artifact is optional and the result of the evaluation will not alter the already made paper acceptance decision.\n\nPlease check the detailed artifact submission and evaluation guidelines.\n\nCompetition on Software Testing (Test-Comp)\n\nFASE 2022 hosts the 4th edition of the Competition on Software Testing (Test-Comp 2022).\n\nSpecial issues\n\nSpecial issues of the Springer journasl Formal Methods in System Design (FMSD) and Int. J. on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (STTT) are planned for FASE 2022. Authors of the best papers that fall within the scope of the journal will be invited to submit significantly extended papers for journal review.\n\nProgramme chairs\n\nEinar Broch Johnsen (University of Oslo, Norway)\n\nManuel Wimmer (Johannes Kepler UniversitÃ¤t Linz, Austria)\n\nProgramme committee\n\nErika ÃbrahÃ¡m (RWTH Aachen, Germany)\n\nShaukat Ali (Simula Research Lab, Norway)\n\nÃtienne AndrÃ© (UniversitÃ© de Lorraine, France)\n\nThorsten Berger (Ruhr-UniversitÃ¤t Bochum, Germany)\n\nTomÃ¡Å¡ BureÅ¡ (Charles University, Czechia)\n\nJane Cleland-Huang (University of Notre Dame, USA)\n\nCarlo Furia (UniversitÃ della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)\n\nStijn de Gouw (Open Universiteit, The Netherlands)\n\nEsther Guerra (Universidad AutÃ³noma de Madrid, Spain)\n\nIchiro Hasuo (National Institute of Informatics, Japan)\n\nRalf Huuck (Logilica, Australia)\n\nMarie-Christine Jacobs (Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt, Germany)\n\nGerti Kappel (Technische UniversitÃ¤t Wien, Austria)\n\nLeen Lambers (BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg, Germany)\n\nMartin Leucker (UniversitÃ¤t zu LÃ¼beck, Germany)\n\nYi Li (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore)\n\nAugusto Sampaio (Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil)\n\nIna Schaefer (Technische UniversitÃ¤t Braunschweig, Germany)\n\nMariÃ«lle Stoelinga (Universiteit Twente, The Netherlands)\n\nDaniel StrÃ¼ber (Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen, The Netherlands)\n\nGabriele Taentzer (Philipps-UniversitÃ¤t Marburg, Germany)\n\nSilvia Lizeth Tapia Tarifa (University of Oslo, Norway)\n\nSebastian Uchitel (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Imperial College London, UK)\n\nDÃ¡niel VarrÃ³ (McGill University, Canada)\n\nAndrzej Wasowski (IT University Copenhagen, Denmark)\n\nHeike Wehrheim (Carl von Ossietzky UniversitÃ¤t Oldenburg, Germany)\n\nGianluigi Zavattaro (UniversitÃ di Bologna, Italy)\n\nSteffen Zschaler (King's College London, UK)\n\nArtifact evaluation committee chairs\n\nMarie-Christine Jakobs (Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt, Germany)\n\nEduard Kamburjan (University of Oslo, Norway)\n\nArtifact evaluation committee\n\nChinmayi Baramashetru (University of Oslo, Norway)\n\nSaverio Giallorenzo (UniversitÃ di Bologna, Italy, and Inria, France)\n\nPablo GÃ³mez-Abajo (Universidad AutÃ³noma de Madrid, Spain)\n\nElena GÃ³mez-MartÃ­nez (Universidad AutÃ³noma de Madrid, Spain)\n\nJan Haltermann (Carl von Ossietzky UniversitÃ¤t Oldenburg, Germany)\n\nHannes Kallwies (UniversitÃ¤t zu LÃ¼beck, Germany)\n\nDylan Marinho (LORIA, UniversitÃ© de Lorraine, France)\n\nFelix Pauck (UniversitÃ¤t Paderborn, Germany)\n\nSven Peldszus (UniversitÃ¤t Koblenz-Landau, Germany)\n\nMohammad Rezaalipour (UniversitÃ della Svizzera italiana, Switzerland)\n\nCedric Richter (Carl von Ossietzky UniversitÃ¤t Oldenburg, Germany)\n\nMaya Retno Ayu Setyautami (Universitas Indonesia, Indonesia)\n\nAsmae Heydari Tabar (Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt, Germany)\n\nMatthias Volk (Universiteit Twente, The Netherlands)\n\nXiuheng Wu (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore)\n\nLiu Ye (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore)\n\nCompetition chair\n\nDirk Beyer (Ludwig-Maximilians-UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen, Germany)\n\nCompetition committee"
