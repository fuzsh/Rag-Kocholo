        "text": "‌‌‌‌Head of Division: Professor Huabing Yin\n\nThe Division Biomedical Engineering at the University of Glasgow brings together four important research themes in the areas of Advanced Medical Diagnostics, Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technologies, Biomaterials and Tissue engineering and Synthetic Biology.\n\nThe Division hosts research grants that support PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in fields as diverse as infectious disease diagnostics for low-resource settings, brain-computer interfaces, stem cell differentiation using nanotechnology, robots as orthotic aids, and the creation of artificial cells. Our research is supported by funding from the ERC, UKRI programme grants, the EU, charities and industry.\n\nOur Division benefits from strong links to industry as well as to the biomedical sciences and clinical medicine. For example, we lead the Scottish Centre for Innovation in Spinal Cord Injuries placed within the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. Our research groups have spun out companies in medical devices and lead clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products."
