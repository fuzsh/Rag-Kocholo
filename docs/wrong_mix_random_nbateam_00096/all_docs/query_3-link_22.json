Since 1994 to 1999, he held a research position at NTUA. He was the initiator and coordinator of the ESPRIT INNO Technology Transfer Node on High Performance Computing and Networking, and of the successful ESPRIT EROPPA project on the use of metacomputing and distributed supercomputing in the post-production industry. From 2001 until 2005 he was Technical Manager of Network Embedded Systems at Ellemedia Technologies, a Lucent product development partner. In January 2006 he joined inAccess Networks, as an R&D Manager. Mr. Meliones was the project manager of the ESA SATWAYS, Eurostars NetHomEra, HTCI/A2 and several national research activities, coordinator of the application of the Hellenic Semiconductor Industry Association in the framework of the Hellenic Technology Cluster Initiative and member of the Project Coordination Committee of ICT-FET ATRACO, Eurostars Z-Phone, CELTIC IMPULSE/GENIO, ENIAC END and AAL PeerAssist projects. He is currently the Project Manager of the T1RCI-593 MANTO R&D project developing innovative autonomous outdoor and indoor blind navigation applications using smartphones, and of the KALLIPOS+ open access coursebook 556 on Embedded Systems. Currently he is a Full Professor at the Department of Digital Systems, University of Piraeus, where he has been teaching since 2005. He has received the Bodosakis Foundation grant and State Scholarships Foundation awards for excellence in academics. He is the author of more than 90 papers in the areas of distributed systems, metacomputing, fault-tolerant supercomputing, total quality management of broadband networks, network embedded systems, telecommunication systems, audiovisual systems, real-time systems, industrial HPCN, satcom applications and pervasive computing. He is the developer of the open source MPC8260 Linux ATM device driver for the PowerQUICC-II family of communication processors which has been widely used worldwide."
