25th International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering

Accepted papers

FASE is concerned with the foundations on which software engineering is built. Submissions should make novel contributions to making software engineering a more mature and soundly-based discipline. Contributions should be supported by appropriate arguments and validation. Contributions that combine the development of conceptual and methodological advances with their formal foundations and tool support are particularly encouraged. We welcome contributions on all such fundamental approaches, including:

software engineering as an engineering discipline, including its interaction with and impact on society and economics;

requirements engineering: capture, consistency, and change management of software requirements;

software architectures: description and analysis of the architecture, e.g., SOA, microservice architectures, model-driven architectures, or software product lines;

specification, design, and implementation of particular classes of systems: (self-)adaptive, autonomous, collaborative, intelligent, embedded, distributed, mobile, pervasive, cyber-physical, data-centric, or service-oriented applications;

applications of AI to software engineering, including search-based and learning-based approaches;

software engineering foundations for AI-based systems;

software quality: (static or run-time) validation and verification of functional and non-functional software properties (including security and data privacy) using techniques such as theorem proving, model checking, testing, analysis, simulation, refinement methods, metrics or visualization techniques;

model-driven engineering: model transformation, meta-modelling, design and semantics of domain-specific languages, consistency and synchronization of models, generative architectures;

software processes: support for iterative, agile, and open source development;

software evolution: refactoring, reverse and re-engineering, configuration management and architectural change, or aspect-orientation.

Important dates, paper submission and review

See the ETAPS 2022 joint call for papers. Submit your paper via the FASE 2022 author interface of EasyChair.

The review process of FASE 2022 is double-blind, without a rebuttal phase. In your submission, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgements that might identify you.

Paper categories

FASE 2022 solicits four types of submissions: research papers, empirical evaluation papers, new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers and tool demonstration papers.

Research papers clearly identify and justify a principled advance to the fundamentals of software engineering. Research papers should clearly articulate their contribution, and provide sufficient evidence for the soundness and applicability of the proposed approach. Research papers are expected to be 15-18 pages llncs.cls (excluding bibliography). Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix.

Empirical evaluation papers evaluate existing software challenges or critically validate current proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e., by empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, simulations, etc. Scientific reflection on problems and practices in the software industry also falls into this category. Empirical evaluation papers can be 15-18 pp llncs.cls (excluding bibliography). Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix.

New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) papers (new in 2022!) seek to disrupt the status quo with forward-looking, thought-provoking, innovative research on the foundations of software engineering, as well as lessons learned from the past. Our aim is to accelerate the exposure of the ETAPS community to early yet potentially ground-breaking research results, and to techniques and perspectives that challenge the status quo. To broadly capture this goal, the NIER track at FASE 2022 will publish the following types of papers:

Innovative or groundbreaking new ideas at early stages of research, supported by promising initial results and intuitions;

Visions of new directions: synergies with other fields or foundational approaches to problems that currently lack foundations in software engineering;

Lessons from the past: thoughtful observations on past or current research directions that may be somehow misguided or that let us see current research directions from a new perspective.

NIER papers are expected to be 6-8 pp llncs.cls (excluding bibliography). NIER papers will be assessed primarily on their level of originality, relevance, and potential for impact on the field in terms of promoting innovative thinking. Hence, inadequacies in the state-of-the-art and the pertinence, correctness, and impact of the idea/vision/lesson must be described clearly. A full evaluation is not required for FASE NIER papers, but preliminary evaluation results may help the reviewers understand the scope of the work better.

Tool demonstration papers present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions to an existing tool. They should provide a short description of the theoretical foundations and emphasize the design and implementation concerns, including software architecture. The paper should give a clear account of the tool's functionality and discuss the tool's practical capabilities with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available, preferably on the web. Experimental evaluation is not required, however, a motivation as to why the tool is interesting and significant should be provided. Tool demonstration papers can have a maximum of 6 pp llncs.cls (excluding bibliography). They should have an appendix of up to 6 additional pages with details on the actual demonstration.

Artifact submission and evaluation

Authors of accepted papers may submit an artifact after notification. The artifact will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee (AEC) independently of the paper according to the following criteria:

consistent with the paper;

as complete as possible;

well-documented;

easy to (re)use;

publicly available and persisted.

Submission of an artifact is optional and the result of the evaluation will not alter the already made paper acceptance decision.

Please check the detailed artifact submission and evaluation guidelines.

Competition on Software Testing (Test-Comp)

FASE 2022 hosts the 4th edition of the Competition on Software Testing (Test-Comp 2022).

Special issues

Special issues of the Springer journasl Formal Methods in System Design (FMSD) and Int. J. on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (STTT) are planned for FASE 2022. Authors of the best papers that fall within the scope of the journal will be invited to submit significantly extended papers for journal review.
