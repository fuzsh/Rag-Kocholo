        "text": "1974 Rittenhouse ‘Five Years Old’\n\nStraight Rye Whiskey, Italian Export\n\n75cl, 43% ABV, 86pf\n\nproducer\n\nContinental Distilling Corporation\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nContinental Distilling Co. was a subsidiary of Publicker Industries, Inc. Publicker Industries began with Mr. Harry Publicker, who started off steaming old whiskey barrels and extracting from them the gallon or two of whiskey that had soaked into the charred wood. This he sold, and when the government tried to prosecute him for not paying the revenue tax on the whiskey, he became highly indignant. In 1912 he built and operated a distillery at the corner of Snyder Street and Swanson Avenue, and at the riverfront between Bigler Street and Packer Ave. After prohibition was repealed, it was only natural for them to apply that leverage of scale and their modern technologies to the production of potable spirits. In August of 1933 they spent what would be over $27 million dollars in today’s money to remodel their smaller distillery into what would become the Continental Distilling Corporation.\n\nThey introduced “Rittenhouse Square Rye” in 1934. It was named after Philadelphia’s famous Rittenhouse Square, which itself was named after David Rittenhouse, a renowned astronomer, inventor, and mathematician. The “Square” was dropped from the product’s name in 1948, and it’s remained known as Rittenhouse Rye ever since.\n\nBy the 1970s, whiskey had become less popular in America, as clear spirits—vodka in particular—grew in popularity. Bourbon sales were falling, and rye became nearly extinct. The few original rye makers that were still around in Pennsylvania (and elsewhere) struggled and began to close. Continental began to wane in the early 1980s. Heaven Hill Distillery swooped in and bought the rights to several rye brands, including Rittenhouse, as the original distilleries went out of business.\n\nHeaven Hill introduced their version of Rittenhouse Rye in the 1990s. Although Heaven Hill is, of course, famous for being a bourbon maker, the company deserves a lot of credit for keeping rye whiskey alive in the US. Even when bourbon started to become a popular drinking choice once again, rye was slower to reemerge. For many years, Heaven Hill spent only a single day per year distilling rye whiskey—the rest of the year was devoted to bourbon. But they kept it alive, even if only once a year.\n\nThis 1974 Italian Export bottling was distilled in 1969. In earlier iterations, some export bottles still read as “Bottled-In-Bond” even though the contents were under 100 proof, as the Bottled In Bond laws did not translate overseas. Rye whiskey was incredibly rare in the 1960s and 70s, making this beautiful example of a classic American brand, incredibly unique.\n\ncolor Mahogany and gold, incredibly clean and bright\n\nnose Dried apricot, dried cherry, sweet pepper, toffee\n\npalate Dark cacao, clean, rich, cinnamon, citrus, vanilla, nutmeg\n\nfinish Lingering maple, spice, white pepper, medium length"
