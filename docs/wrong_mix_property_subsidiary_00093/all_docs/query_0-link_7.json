        "text": "Organisation of school dinners\n\nWe have launched a new system from Jan 2024 for how children choose school dinners called School Grid. Some of the positives to using this system that we have seen so far are:\n\nThere has been far less food waste.\n\nThe children are spending far less time queuing because the kitchen staff know their choice of dinner immediately rather than having to find names on lists when children have lost their dinner band/sticker (which happens a lot!)\n\nBecause the children are spending less time queuing, they get their dinner faster and therefore more time to play out!\n\nGoing forward, if parents are able to choose school dinners at home using School Grid then you no longer need to stick to specific days e.g. your child has to have dinners on a Monday, Tuesday and Friday. You can now choose to have a dinner on any day you wish and this can change day to day, week to week. You must have made your choice by 9am on the day. If you do not make a choice on a particular day then you need to send your child with a packed lunch. Please remember it is your responsibility to cancel their lunch if they are absent from school, otherwise you may be charged.\n\nIf any parents are NOT able to use the School Grid system, but still want their child to have a school dinner, then please notify the office. We can ensure these children can choose a school dinner in school but they will have to stick to a set pattern/days as otherwise parents could find they are paying for more dinners than they want too.\n\nFor the time being, parents will choose school dinners on School Grid and pay for school dinner on ParentPay. The two systems link so everytime your child has a school dinner, it automatically sends the charge through to ParentPay.\n\nPacked Lunches\n\nChildren who do not choose to have a school dinner, bring a packed lunch. We have been awarded the Healthy Schools Award so whilst we do not want to be the 'Lunchtime Police', we do encourage healthy food in packed lunches such as fruit, brown bread, yogurts etc rather than sweets and biscuits.\n\nChildren on packed lunches can have a fruit drink at lunchtime but we ask that it is a flat drink not fizzy and that it is in a plastic bottle. No glass bottles or cans for safety reasons.\n\nWe appreciate parents and carers support with this.\n\nFor more information about packed lunches, please see Packed Lunch Guidance for Parents as the bottom of this page.\n\nChildren may, of course, go home for their dinner. Dinnertime is from 11.45am-12.15pm for Reception, 12pm-1pm for KS1 and 12.15-1.15pm for KS2. If you wish for your child to do this, please contact the headteacher, Miss Percival.\n\nFree Schools Meals\n\nFree school meals are available to some children according to family income. It’s important to register for entitlement to free school meals, even if your child has a packed lunch – this is so we can receive additional funding (called the pupil premium) which we can use to help your child.\n\nChildren are entitled to Free School Meals if their parents, carers or guardians receive any of the following:\n\nIncome support\n\nIncome based job seekers allowance\n\nIncome related employment and support allowance\n\nChild Tax Credit (provided you're not also entitled to Working Tax Credit and have an annual gross income of no more than £16,190)\n\nThe guaranteed element of the State Pension Credit\n\nThe guaranteed element of Pension credit\n\nSupport under part V1 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, or\n\nUniversal Credit with an annual income of less than £7,400 (after tax and not including any benefits you get)\n\nIf you get Working Tax Credit your child will not qualify for free school meals.\n\nIf your child is eligible for free school meals, they'll continue to receive them until they move to a new stage of school, such as from primary into secondary school. They will also be entitled to a free carton of milk each day.\n\nIf you think your child could be eligible for free school meals, refer to the Leeds City Council website https://www.leeds.gov.uk/schools-and-education/apply-for-free-school-meals\n\nIf you do qualify the school office will be notified directly by Leeds City Council and we will contact you to discuss your child's entitlement."
