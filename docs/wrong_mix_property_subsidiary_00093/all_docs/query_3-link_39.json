        "text": "I received a text message on 21 January from my GP surgery stating that I was on their priority list for a COVID vaccine. It advised the location as Hall 2, The Pavillions, Harrogate and if I wished to proceed to press the link. I was asked to confirm my date of birth to check identity, I was offered two dates - 26 January 2021 with a few times and 27 January 2021 with one time. I chose the first available at 15.40 on the 26th.\n\nMy reaction to the appointment amazed me; I was very emotional and cried, I felt “I matter” and this emotion lasted in various degrees until my vaccine. You may think it was part of my natural state with my life threatening condition, but that it not the case.\n\nI have been resolute and determined and have responded well with a positive outlook that has not had me resorting to an ongoing emotional response, beyond of course processing the initial diagnosis and preparing my plan of action. This was different ... it affected other people in my life.\n\nMy cancer does not stop me being part of my daughter’s and grandchildren’s lives, COVID-19 does. I have already missed much of the last year with them, missed being part of their learning and life experiences and the love and hugs. The vaccination may mean that there is hope, a light at the end of the dark tunnel and once again I can be an active part of my family’s lives.\n\nThe location of the vaccine was perfect. Only 20mins drive. It appeared well set out and overall I felt safe.\n\nThe system of the text message was very impressive in its simplicity but totally efficient and effective. I took only a minute to book my appointment. On the day before I received a reminder text. Excellent I would say.\n\nThe journey to the appointment was straightforward. I arrived at the site 15/20 mins before my appointment and was asked at the point of entry to the car park the time of my appointment and sent to park. The area had plenty of cars, clearly it was busy.\n\nAlthough I was early I was disciplined by my regular visits to Harrogate Hospital Robert Ogden MacMillan centre that for Covid safety reasons I should not enter until 5 minutes before my appointment time.\n\nIt was apparent that not everyone took the same approach as the queue to enter the hall had most people before me with appointments some 20+ mins after mine. We were admitted in the order of the queue I.e. folks with later appointments in front of me.. no doubt why they seemed very busy inside the hall.\n\nOnce inside no further questions were asked about appointment times and we were fed through to the registration desks and then referred to waiting areas. The seating was at suitable distance and I felt safe. The hall was busy but appeared to be running smoothly. After a while I was taken to my booth. A slight hold-up due a mistake being made at the registration point. A digit missed from my NHS number ... quickly sorted by the administration person. The nurse appeared and was friendly. I advised about my condition and my discussions with my Consultant. I double checked that it was not a live vaccine as this issue had featured on a radio programme some weeks earlier. I was reassured. The vaccination was not uncomfortable but yet again was an emotional experience.\n\nI received the AstraZeneca vaccine (the subject of the radio debate) and I must confess with the various other media scare stories I am mildly concerned that it is the best option for me.\n\nMy immune system at its best has two weeks to maximise the effects of the vaccine before my next chemotherapy which will result in a dip in my immune system ‘s capability. The unknown is the impact on the processing of my COVID vaccine hence my decision to fund an antibody test. I need to know. My usual approach to positively dealing with all matters is based on fact not emotion, hence the importance of dealing with the emotional side openly and not bottling such feelings so they become a negative influence.\n\nI came out of the Hall at The Pavilion Harrogate at 16.05, 25 minutes from my appointment time."
