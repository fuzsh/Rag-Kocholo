A steam train. Wagon rides, a carousel and a dairy barn. A trip to Heritage Park Historical Village is a step back in time — with plenty of appeal for modern-day visitors. The popular venue won two awards in this year’s Calgary Herald and Sun Readers’ Choice Awards: Gold for Favourite Wedding Venue and Silver in the Family Entertainment category. The awards are a sign to the Heritage Park team that they’re doing something right, says Dominic Terry, Heritage Park’s strategic communications manager. “It makes us extremely proud to know that we’re still one of those iconic destinations in Calgary — not just for Calgarians, but for visitors to the city, too,” he says. “When people come to Calgary, they come to Heritage Park.” Next year promises to be extra special. In 2024, the historical village will celebrate its 60th anniversary; the park officially opened its doors on July 1, 1964, with 12,000 visitors that first day. Plans to mark the anniversary are already underway. Watch for live music, a children’s festival, wedding vow renewals and partnerships with community and sports groups. “We’re part of the community,” Terry says. “But we’re also creating community.” For instance, there are more than 450 volunteers on the roster, and of that, at least 10 have been with the park for more than 30 years. More than half a million children have come through the gates in the past decade, and the park has been the location for hundreds of weddings, holiday gatherings and birthday parties, too. Visitors are invited to share their photos and other memories of the park at heritagepark.ca/memories. Those stories will be used to create an exhibition for the park’s Gasoline Alley in 2024.\n\nSHELLEY BOETTCHER Postmedia Content Works\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT\n\nHeritage Park Historical Village\n\nPete the Plumber\n\nCalgary Tutoring Centre\n\nCIR Realty\n\nCrowfoot Dodge\n\nDesert Sun Patios\n\nElegance Medispa\n\nGrizzly Paw Brewing Company\n\nHarding's Services\n\nItalian Centre Shop\n\nLegacy\n\nLexus of Royal Oak\n\nAfrican Restaurant Sultan's Tent Safari Grill Marathon Ethiopian Restaurant Bakery Glamorgan Bakery Lina's Italian Market Lakeview Bakery Banff Restaurant Grizzly House Park Distillery Restaurant & Bar Magpie & Stump Barbecue Restaurant Big T's BBQ & Smokehouse Hayden Block Smoke & Whiskey The Palomino Breakfast/Brunch Spot Red's Diner OEB Breakfast Co.

Moving your body not only keeps you in shape for a day of adventure but can also put you in the right frame of mind to enjoy all that awaits. Synapse Health and Fitness won the gold medal for Best Fitness Centre or Gym thanks to its holistic strategy and health-centred approach. Those looking for a different kind of workout might want to sweat it out at Calgary Hot Yoga, get their core in check at one of the city’s many Club Pilates locations, or scale their way up the wall at the Calgary Climbing Centre. With so many options, there’s no excuse not to have a little fun while staying fit.\n\n— Annie MacInnes, executive director of the Kensington Business Revitalization Zone\n\nHead to the gym to build the energy you need to start your day and get the blood flowing\n\n\"\n\nFollow the lead of our Readers’ Choice voters by visiting some of their favourite places\n\nELIZABETH CHORNEY-BOOTH\n\nTHIS YEAR'S\n\nMORE\n\nAdditional Winners\n\nGetty Images\n\nB\n\nEven if you don’t need or really intend to buy anything, there’s something soothing about wandering around the city’s best shops to check out what’s on the shelves. If fashion is your passion, our readers chose Bellissima, a shop full of smart and classic women’s clothing, as its top ladies’ boutique, with O’Connors taking the top spot for menswear. Shopping isn’t just about clothing — if hunting for used treasures is where you find your joy, Fair’s Fair Books is a haven for readers in search of used books, while Iron Crow Antiques and Objects of Intrigue is full of eclectic vintage finds. Shopping for a midday snack can also be a pleasure, especially if you stop at either of the Calgary Farmers’ Market locations: both the South and West locations won high praise from our readers.\n\nReaders' Choice was created by Content Works, Postmedia's commercial content divison.

A few hours at the spa is the best way to achieve maximum relaxation and our poll saw a tie for first place between the Oasis Wellness Centre and Spa in Mount Royal and the RnR Wellness Spas at the Fairmont Palliser Hotel and Hotel Le Germain, representing some of the most luxurious spa facilities in the city. If a massage or facial isn’t in the cards, something more practical like a haircut at Chatters, Diva Salon and Spa or Tommy Gun’s Original Barbershop may do the trick. Or, if you want to give yourself an esthetic treat that will last a lifetime, get some ink or a piercing at Atticus Tattoo, the top choice for local tattoo parlours.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThere's nothing like a day to just pamper yourself. It's almost a good as a vacation. Perhaps a day a the spa will hit the spot or maybe treat yourself to a tatoo.\n\nTO\n\nDine\n\nTHE\n\nDelicious food is a big part of any day out on the town and our list includes more than enough restaurants to keep urban explorers satisfied for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Good Earth is the perfect spot to stop for a morning coffee and muffin, while those with bigger morning appetites can sit down for a full hot breakfast at Red’s Diner. From there, the world is your oyster when it comes to restaurants in Calgary: we’ve got everything from the dim sum at Silver Dragon, the delectable barbecue at Korean Village and a full Moroccan experience at Sultan’s Tent. For more casual fare, some winners included burgers at Peters’ Drive-In and fried chicken at Chicken on the Way. For an elegant experience, visit our readers’ favourite patio at River Café (weather permitting, of course) or stop into any location of The Keg for an opulent steak dinner.\n\nON\n\nGroove\n\nGET YOUR\n\nFinish off your perfect day in Calgary with a night full of fun and frivolity. Experience local culture by taking in some live music at the King Eddy or a play at Stage West Dinner Theatre. If a casino atmosphere is more your speed, our readers’ top choice, the Grey Eagle Casino, also has an excellent dinner buffet and regularly hosts world-class concerts. Cowboys Casino is another fun option, coming in as the top nightclub on the list. For something a bit quieter, tuck into a top cocktail bar like Proof or the readers’ favourite pub, The Ship and Anchor, for a nightcap before calling it a day.\n\nThanks\n\nVOTING\n\nFOR\n\nAfrican Restaurant Safari Grill Marathon Ethiopian Restaurant Flavours Restaurant Bakery Glamorgan Bakery Moti Mahal Lina’s Italian Market; Sidewalk Citizen Bakery Banff Restaurant Grizzly House Magpie & Stump Park Distillery Restaurant & Bar Barbecue restaurant Big T’s BBQ & Smokehouse Hayden Block; Big Sky BBQ Breakfast/Brunch OEB Breakfast Co.

And he says there’s a good reason. Actually, two of them. “The two key words we live by are service and warranty,” Archdekin says. “We’re going to give you the best service and we’re going to warranty (the work) longer than anybody else.” Pete the Plumber won double Gold in the 2023-24 Calgary Herald and Calgary Sun Readers’ Choice Awards, taking top spot in the Plumbing category as well as in the Electrician category. The company offers 14-year warranties on its furnaces and will soon have the same deal in place for hot water tanks. “All of the parts cost a fortune now because they all come from overseas and transportation costs are through the roof. So, you have to back it up,” Archdekin says. “If someone doesn’t get satisfaction from my crew, they can always get to me. “I’ll straighten things out and get you the right answers. I’ll bend over backwards to make you happy.” Archdekin, who now has 56 trucks on the road, recently attended CIPHX — the Canadian Institute for Plumbing and Heating Exhibition. Some of his conversations there didn’t last too long. “All the major manufacturers come into town to razzle and dazzle all of the plumbers,” he says. “They want to show off all of their new softeners and filters and pumps, and show everyone how they’re the best. “The first question I ask is ‘What’s your warranty?’ I don’t ask about the price. I care about warranty. “If a company doesn’t have a good warranty, I don’t want it. Then they’ll say, ‘Why?’ I say, ‘Well, if you don’t believe in (the product), why should I?’ ” Go to petetheplumber.com to learn more.\n\nPete Archdekin’s company has been winning awards on a regular basis.

A steam train. Wagon rides, a carousel and a dairy barn. A trip to Heritage Park Historical Village is a step back in time — with plenty of appeal for modern-day visitors. The popular venue won two awards in this year’s Calgary Herald and Sun Readers’ Choice Awards: Gold for Favourite Wedding Venue and Silver in the Family Entertainment category. The awards are a sign to the Heritage Park team that they’re doing something right, says Dominic Terry, Heritage Park’s strategic communications manager. “It makes us extremely proud to know that we’re still one of those iconic destinations in Calgary — not just for Calgarians, but for visitors to the city, too,” he says. “When people come to Calgary, they come to Heritage Park.” Next year promises to be extra special. In 2024, the historical village will celebrate its 60th anniversary; the park officially opened its doors on July 1, 1964, with 12,000 visitors that first day. Plans to mark the anniversary are already underway. Watch for live music, a children’s festival, wedding vow renewals and partnerships with community and sports groups. “We’re part of the community,” Terry says. “But we’re also creating community.” For instance, there are more than 450 volunteers on the roster, and of that, at least 10 have been with the park for more than 30 years. More than half a million children have come through the gates in the past decade, and the park has been the location for hundreds of weddings, holiday gatherings and birthday parties, too. Visitors are invited to share their photos and other memories of the park at heritagepark.ca/memories. Those stories will be used to create an exhibition for the park’s Gasoline Alley in 2024.\n\nSHELLEY BOETTCHER Postmedia Content Works\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT\n\nThis story was created by Content Works, Postmedia’s commercial content division, on behalf of Pete the Plumber.\n\nCompany wins Gold in Plumbing and Electrician categories\n\nPete the Plumber\n\nPete Archdekin’s company has been winning awards on a regular basis.

Experience local culture by taking in some live music at the King Eddy or a play at Stage West Dinner Theatre. If a casino atmosphere is more your speed, our readers’ top choice, the Grey Eagle Casino, also has an excellent dinner buffet and regularly hosts world-class concerts. Cowboys Casino is another fun option, coming in as the top nightclub on the list. For something a bit quieter, tuck into a top cocktail bar like Proof or the readers’ favourite pub, The Ship and Anchor, for a nightcap before calling it a day.\n\nON\n\nGroove\n\nGET YOUR\n\nTO\n\nDine\n\nTHE\n\nDelicious food is a big part of any day out on the town and our list includes more than enough restaurants to keep urban explorers satisfied for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Good Earth is the perfect spot to stop for a morning coffee and muffin, while those with bigger morning appetites can sit down for a full hot breakfast at Red’s Diner. From there, the world is your oyster when it comes to restaurants in Calgary: we’ve got everything from the dim sum at Silver Dragon, the delectable barbecue at Korean Village and a full Moroccan experience at Sultan’s Tent. For more casual fare, some winners included burgers at Peters’ Drive-In and fried chicken at Chicken on the Way. For an elegant experience, visit our readers’ favourite patio at River Café (weather permitting, of course) or stop into any location of The Keg for an opulent steak dinner.\n\nPEXELS VIDEO\n\nThere's nothing like a day to just pamper yourself. It's almost a good as a vacation. Perhaps a day a the spa will hit the spot or maybe treat yourself to a tatoo.\n\nYourself\n\nTreat\n\nSOMETHING SPECIAL\n\nTO\n\n2023\n\nScroll for more\n\n01\n\nYOURSELF\n\nCare\n\nof\n\nA perfect day requires at least some time dedicated to pampering and self-care. A few hours at the spa is the best way to achieve maximum relaxation and our poll saw a tie for first place between the Oasis Wellness Centre and Spa in Mount Royal and the RnR Wellness Spas at the Fairmont Palliser Hotel and Hotel Le Germain, representing some of the most luxurious spa facilities in the city. If a massage or facial isn’t in the cards, something more practical like a haircut at Chatters, Diva Salon and Spa or Tommy Gun’s Original Barbershop may do the trick. Or, if you want to give yourself an esthetic treat that will last a lifetime, get some ink or a piercing at Atticus Tattoo, the top choice for local tattoo parlours.\n\nEven if you don’t need or really intend to buy anything, there’s something soothing about wandering around the city’s best shops to check out what’s on the shelves. If fashion is your passion, our readers chose Bellissima, a shop full of smart and classic women’s clothing, as its top ladies’ boutique, with O’Connors taking the top spot for menswear. Shopping isn’t just about clothing — if hunting for used treasures is where you find your joy, Fair’s Fair Books is a haven for readers in search of used books, while Iron Crow Antiques and Objects of Intrigue is full of eclectic vintage finds. Shopping for a midday snack can also be a pleasure, especially if you stop at either of the Calgary Farmers’ Market locations: both the South and West locations won high praise from our readers.\n\nSample the City is a two-week tour of the city’s extensive food and beverage industry, aimed at highlighting and supporting locally-owned and operated cafes, bakeries, breweries and restaurants.\n\nGetty Images\n\nHead to the gym to build the energy you need to start your day and get the blood flowing\n\n\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nuild up the energy to start your day by getting your blood flowing with a little bit of exercise. Moving your body not only keeps you in shape for a day of adventure but can also put you in the right frame of mind to enjoy all that awaits. Synapse Health and Fitness won the gold medal for Best Fitness Centre or Gym thanks to its holistic strategy and health-centred approach. Those looking for a different kind of workout might want to sweat it out at Calgary Hot Yoga, get their core in check at one of the city’s many Club Pilates locations, or scale their way up the wall at the Calgary Climbing Centre. With so many options, there’s no excuse not to have a little fun while staying fit.\n\nB\n\nFollow the lead of our Readers’ Choice voters by visiting some of their favourite places\n\nELIZABETH CHORNEY-BOOTH\n\nSpend a perfect day in\n\nCalgary\n\nPEXELS VIDEO"
