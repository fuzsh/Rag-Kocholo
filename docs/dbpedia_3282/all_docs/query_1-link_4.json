        "text": "Launched in October 2008, the RETROSPECTIVE label is a partnership between Nimbus Records and veteran nostalgia specialist Ray Crick, who has the job of selecting the repertoire, compiling the programmes, sourcing the highest quality transfers, and supplying biographies and informative notes for the booklets. “I am delighted to be involved with RETROSPECTIVE because it enables me to create CD programmes that bring alive the finest recordings by those wonderful vintage entertainers of yesteryear, both popular and jazz, for people to enjoy today.”\n\nNew releases are added every month, delivering the very best in musical nostalgia from music hall to rock ‘n’ roll – and everything in between! We hope you will relish these classic recordings from the past. Packaged with an iconic series design, and with booklets containing all the detailed information needed to enhance your pleasure, RETROSPECTIVE is a highly collectable range.\n\nRETROSPECTIVE is available from all good record shops or can be purchased directly from this site. A full printed catalogue is also available."
