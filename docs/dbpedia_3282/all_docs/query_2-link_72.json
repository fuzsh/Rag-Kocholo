        "text": "Douglas Roy Snider, of Manchester, passed away at the Henry Ford Hospice Home in Jackson, Michigan on May 27, 2024.\n\nHe was born the son of Roy H. and Evelyn F. (Van Worner) Snider on October 9, 1939 in Jackson, Michigan. On November 25, 1961, he married Faye Ann (Freed), and she survives. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his children, Scott D. Snider and Steve (Pamela) Snider; grandchildren, Corey (Meredith) Snider and Samantha (Gregg) Koebbe; great-grandchildren, Valerie, Scarlett, Parker and Maisyn.\n\nDoug was a wonderful provider for his family and worked for the Ford Motor Company for 34.5 years. In his younger years, he was an All-State football player. He enjoyed building things with his hands and even raced stock cars. He was very proud of his John Deere tractor.\n\nPer his wishes cremation has taken place, and a private service and burial will take place in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan at a later date.\n\nArrangements by Staffan-Mitchell Funeral Home, Chelsea."
