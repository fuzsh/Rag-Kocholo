Yokelson! I definitely got my money’s worth and highly, Highly, HIGHLY recommend anyone thinking about buying a session with you, they need to definitely do it. Thank you for steering me on the right course with my audio!\n\nJeff Geaghan\n\nYou know what’s fun? I unearthed a short video I shot of my very first Uncle Roy Bash – where the only people I knew were J. Michael Collins and Uncle Roy himself. Now, years later, after having met so many outstanding people, I recognize so many of these faces. So awesome to feel “part of”…. Thanks everyone!\n\nJim Cooper VO\n\nSo last week I worked with Roy B. Yokelson of Antland Productions to learn some amazing tricks with Adobe Audition.\n\nA fantastic investment, because a week later, I was able to bang out some SWEET Auditions that got me a Character Commercial!\n\nIan Fults\n\nI have been using Audacity for YEARS, a great piece of software, but even with my experience with Adobe products like Photoshop, After Effects and Premier, I was a tad daunted how that would translate to Adobe Audition.\n\nRoy B. Yokelson of Antland Productions not only showed me the tricks I can use with it, but literally set the program up with quick keys for me to make the workflow .. well . . FLOW!\n\nIan Fults\n\nYes! So much fun!!!Thank you Uncle Roy for my fabulous new Audio in my new space!!\n\nTara Langella\n\nMy life will never be the same.\n\nDarren Sapp\n\nNew house means new studio means new acoustics.\n\nRoy B. Yokelson hooked me up before and no one’s ever complained about my sound so OF COURSE I went back to him to make my audio shine. Went into the wee hours with this setup and it was well worth it! If you want to be the best you gotta work with the best. Thanks Uncle Roy!\n\nAndrew Lander\n\nOnce again, a big thank you to Roy B. Yokelson for a quick fix for a couple of AA 3.0 problems I was having. It’s amazing what 45 years of experience can do!\n\nMatt Craig\n\nThanks to Uncle Roy from @antland_productions for helping me get sound back into my recording session today! I’m happy.\n\nChristina Aguinaga\n\nThanks again for a great session, Uncle Roy!! I learned a lot – I’m feeling grateful, too! 🙏😊\n\nJoan Covino\n\nThanks Uncle Roy! I had a lot of fun doing my demo recording, especially with Dottie the cat providing calming purring noises!\n\nSean Mahan\n\nTeam, Roy B. Yokelson is pure class. More of him in the world please.\n\nTim Ratledge\n\nTell you what, Roy B. Yokelson: You’ve reformed my Adobe Audition ways. The two hours I spent with you will save me many, many hours of editing and production time. It was money well spent…no, make that money well invested…\n\nRay Hoffman\n\nLearned a lot and had fun at the same time! Thanks Uncle Roy!\n\nDeidre Ann Johnson\n\nIf you’ve been a social butterfly in the US voice over community, you know this man. In fact, he is your uncle. Uncle Roy Yokelson. Owner of Antland Studios, owner of a very rusty classic car. He’s a sound engineer, demo producer, voice over coach, and recording expert. But most of all, Roy is a true Mensch.\n\nPaul Strikwerda\n\nnethervoice\n\nUncle Roy set me up with his life-changing, Twisted Wave Editing Quick List, walking me through each step of the process… and being pretty darn entertaining the entire time. If you need tech help, there’s none better! Put your money where your mouth is… hire Uncle Roy!\n\nLorena Belcher\n\nYou are the best. I recorded 4 auditions this afternoon and followed your guidelines. Not only did you save me an incredible amount of time, but wow, I sound so much better. Hopefully I will move from being Shortlisted to Hired.\n\nEllen Press\n\nUncle Roy,\n\nI just wanted to thank you again for the time yesterday with everything. I practiced yesterday after our session with 5 different reads and edited each one as per the list. I was sent an audition today and cleaned it very nice for my agent. I feel much more confident editing and ready to take on the world!! Thank you\n\nPaul Hansen\n\nI have to say, your process has saved me HOURS of work already. Thank you again for everything you give and share to the community!\n\nHilary P. Buuck\n\nVoice Over Artist\n\nI appreciate the way you teach…customized for me. 🙂\n\nThanks again. The set up is indeed life-changing. 🙂\n\nBarbara H\n\nI cannot even start to tell you what your counsel has done for the efficiency and the quality with which I now do my work. Both parts of that process are now vastly improved. How did I ever enter this business without you?\n\nHere’s to many more happy and productive years for you.\n\nBarry Abrams\n\nThanks for this! And thanks again for the setup and training, I’m going to be spending a 10th of the time editing in the audition now. I’ll definitely be sending others your way!\n\nZack Sage\n\nWhat a wonderful set up session I had with you! You were kind and so wonderful to work with. Thank you so much for being so sweet to me it really made my day.\n\nSonia Torres\n\nI just wanted to thank you for all the help and extra time you spent helping me work out my workflow. I felt you went above and beyond to help me, and answered all my questions concerning mastering my audio.\n\nBecky Ray Carter\n\nHe did it again!\n\nRoy B. Yokelson, the “D.A.”- Doctor of Audio, helped me yesterday setting up Adobe Audition with Source Connect, creating a template, which makes it so easy to open SC, and then the AA template. He takes care of all the techie stuff that makes me hyperventilate.\n\nMarie Hoffman\n\nThe Doc is always in when you need help. You’re outstanding, Roy (and you make a very nice kugel.)\n\nUncle Roy, thank you so much for being there for me. I am soooo happy you came into my VoiceOver journey. I couldn’t imagine as I advance and move my career into a “higher” level doing this without you. I have already learned some things but my goal is not just to be a “great” VoiceOver artist but to also be a “great” engineer with my work and I know that with you by my side learning from you that will be attainable.\n\nLooking to keep working and learning from the best!\n\nSonia Torres\n\nUncle Roy, things are drastically improving in my setup and practical ability thanks to your advice. And to compliment that, I just bought a couple of proper mics and new interface. The world sounds better now!\n\nGabriel Porras\n\nHey Roy!\n\nJust wanted to say thanks again for the Adobe Audition course last week. I thought I would share with you the results of the first job “AUR” (After Uncle Roy). This is another job for the same defense industry client. I played an earlier trial take of it vs. the final for my wife, and her eyes popped at the difference (she’s very critical, so the reaction was appreciated). The client also commented on the warmer tone and clarity.\n\nJon\n\nHi Uncle Roy,\n\nQuick note to tell you I’ve done several auditions today and test drove your Twisted Wave Quick List 🌪 – worked like a charm!\n\nI💜it!\n\nThank you!\n\nBeth\n\nFirst, I want to say how grateful I am for your tutelage in mastering audiobooks. I’ve applied it to a podcast I’m doing. Your mastering chain has worked VERY well in getting things loud enough without sounding crunched. Thanks a TON.\n\nRob Reider Voice\n\nAfter spending most of the day moving the office computer to the studio and reconfiguring and downloading software ‘Uncle Roy’ Yokelson jumped online at 11pm. He worked with me for about 90 minutes to set all the shortcuts and key configurations in Adobe Audition so I can work on the weekend. Roy is amazing and a wonderful person.\n\nRichard Crossman\n\nTHANK YOU so much for today’s tech session! You’re the best! Can’t wait to see you when we move back east! Bagel party!!!!!! Woo hoo!!!!!!!!!\n\nChristine Brito\n\nI’m TOTALLY happy with what you’ve taught me and it’s working great!! I’ll be finishing up the book in the next 48 hours and moving on to another one right away. It is SO nice working with you!\n\nRob Reider Voice\n\nThis audio is so great now; I haven’t felt this good in a long time. But you also helped me fix it so quick, and that is so very much appreciated. Thanks.\n\nTony Cobb\n\nThank you so much Uncle Roy!!!\n\nI just booked the biggest job of my career so far – I am sure my audio being overhauled and upgraded was a huge part of that!!!!\n\nTHANK YOU!!!!! XO\n\nAngela Colville\n\nVoice Artist\n\nI didn’t expect you to get back to me until this morning, since I sent my request on a Saturday morning, but you were on top of it! You’re the best!\n\nThanks so much for helping with this–I think I have everything I need now.\n\nWarmly,\n\nAimee Ollman\n\nThanks so much for your help yesterday. You saved me.\n\nMy son is now a recurring character on a kids’ show “Super Wings” because of you!\n\nThanks so much.\n\nKaren❤️❤️❤️\n\nThanks, Uncle Roy.\n\nThanks so much for the time you spent with me on Audition training, and for suggesting RX. You gave me a great launch. I’ve gotten into the weeds (in a good way) with editing, and it’s become a fun part of the process… onward!\n\nPaul Vinger\n\nVoice Over Actor\n\nI wanted to say a BIG and hearty thank you for everything! You really know your stuff, sir. MUCH respect. I feel like I’m moving at warp speed in post, and my audio sounds better than ever!\n\nVesta Millard\n\nStop being so clever and creative, Uncle Roy!\n\nKarin Barth\n\nHome Studio Guidance\n\nUncle Roy is the 'Wonderland of Knowledge of Voiceover'\n\nAntland Productions offers FREE home studio evaluations!
