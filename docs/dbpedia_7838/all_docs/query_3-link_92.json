        "text": "LAND ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS\n\nThe National Committee on the Rural Code is the central decision-making body responsible for the implementation of the Rural Code. The Permanent Secretariat of the Rural Code is responsible for developing policies and laws that complement and support the Rural Code, create a resource center, and evaluate the work of the decentralized land commissions (Gnoumou and Bloch 2003).\n\nThe Rural Code establishes Land Commissions at three levels: department, commune, and village. Land Commission members include technical government departments at the local level, municipal departments, customary authorities, and civil society. Women are represented at every Land Commission level (AUC et al. 2008; Diarra and Monimart 2006).\n\nLand Commissions implement the Rural Code at the local level and are given responsibility to verify and confirm land rights and to record land and ownership rights. They are also responsible for educating the local public about the Rural Code. Local Land Commission membership includes the technical government land administrative departments at the local level, representatives of the municipal departments, customary leaders, and local civil society representatives. While Land Commissions have been established in all areas, many are not functioning (Gnoumou and Bloch 2003; AUC et al. 2008).\n\nLAND MARKETS AND INVESTMENTS\n\nAgricultural land is held communally in many areas of the country, and even where communal land is individualized and passed from generation to generation, customary law often precludes sale of the land. In the relatively prosperous agricultural zone of south-central Niger, political and economic elites obtained individualized ownership rights to land in the period following Independence, and an informal land sales market has developed (Hobbs 1998; Gnoumou and Bloch 2003; McCarthy et al. 2004; Land tenure.info n.d.).\n\nRegistering a formal property transaction in Niger requires four procedures, costs 11% of the property’s value, and takes an average of 35 days. Steps include: (1) checking the ownership of the property at the Land Registry; (2) requesting a notary to draft the sales deed; (3) registering the new ownership with the Tax Authorities; and (4) transferring the property title within the Land Registry. This process is faster and more streamlined than the sub-Saharan average, but costs slightly more than the sub-Saharan average of 9% of property value (World Bank 2008a).\n\nCOMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS BY GOVERNMENT\n\nArticle 21 of the Constitution provides that no one can be deprived of property except when taken for public use and when the landholder is fairly compensated in advance. The Rural Code narrowed the state’s ability to expropriate land for public use. Previous legislation had declared all unregistered land as property of the state and stated that such land could be appropriated at will with no compensation. The Rural Code strengthens individual and community property rights and requires the state to pay just compensation for land expropriated for a public use (Hobbs 1998; RON 1999).\n\nLAND DISPUTES AND CONFLICTS\n\nThe growing population, soil degradation, and competing land uses have increased the pressure on Niger’s agricultural and pasture land. Three types of land conflict are common: (1) intra-family conflicts; (2) conflicts between pastoralists and sedentary farmers; and (3) conflicts between villagers and traditional chiefs over access to and use of land (Gnoumou and Bloch 2003).\n\nThe enactment of the Rural Code in 1993 caused an increase in the number of land disputes. The Rural Code permits the registration of customary rights but is ambiguous about which rights can be registered and the priority for registration. The Rural Code repeals prior inconsistent legislation, but authorizes formalization of land rights based on land rights created by (or at least consistent with) prior legislation. To some extent, therefore, prior land policies continue to define land rights. The Land Commissions established to manage the identification of land rights and registration of land do not have authority or capacity to hear and address land disputes, yet require all competing claims to land to be resolved before land is registered. These circumstances increase the insecurity of land tenure and the number of land disputes (Gnoumou and Bloch 2003; RON 1993).\n\nKEY LAND ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS\n\nNiger’s 2003 Rural Development Strategy and 2006 Action Plan created a joint plan to promote improved use and production in the agricultural, livestock, forest and fisheries sectors. The policies seek to support the livestock and agricultural sectors by strengthening marketing channels, supporting infrastructure such as irrigation, strengthening management of natural resources, and fighting desertification (World Bank 2008b).\n\nIn the early 1990s, with financing from the European Union (EU), the Permanent Secretariat of the Rural Code undertook a pilot project to enforce land legislation and sustainable management of natural resources. The project required active participation of women as members of the Land Commissions, and is credited with the achievement of a high percentage of female participation in the governance of land matters through the Land Commissions and as land project participants (CILSS 2003).\n\nWith funding and technical support from the World Bank, the Government of Niger has implemented a US $40.3 million Community Action Program designed to improve rural communes’ capacity to design and implement, in a participatory manner, Communal Development Plans (CDP) and Annual Investment Plans (AIP), and ultimately to contribute to enhancing rural livelihoods. The five-year project (2008–2013) includes capacity-building and improving the legal and institutional frameworks for participatory local development by working with key national institutions responsible for promoting decentralization and local development. The project will also establish a Local Investment Fund (LIF), to stimulate local development and to empower communes and communities to provide a response to their priority needs (World Bank 2009b).\n\nDONOR INTERVENTIONS\n\nUSAID does not currently have a mission in Niger; support for Niger is managed through the West Africa regional office in Ghana. The West Africa Regional Program areas of focus are: (1) improving regional food security through better management of natural resources and agricultural growth; (2) promoting peace and stability; (3) improving health; and (4) fostering regional economic integration and trade. In response to the country’s food insecurity crisis, the US Government supplied stocks of food and humanitarian aid to the country (USAID 2005; USDOS 2008; USAID 2010; USAID 2010b).\n\nUSAID supported the process of drafting Niger’s 1993 Rural Code, and USAID is the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)’s implementing partner in a three-year (2008–2011) US $23 million program that focuses on improving rights and access to land as one of several components. Program goals include: implementing administrative and legal reforms to reduce the time and costs associated with land ownership, transfer, land valuation, building permitting and notarization; conducting a study on the institutional framework required to implement necessary reforms, with the recommendations to be implemented during the Program’s second year; organizing a public-awareness campaign to publicize land reform activities; and conducting a study on how to integrate Land Commission titles into Niger’s land registry, with the recommendations to be implemented in the medium-term as part of Niger’s broader rural development strategy (Hobbs 1998; MCC 2008).\n\nOxfam’s Regional Pastoral Programme, which includes Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, supports the emergence and strengthening of pastoral organizations, develops the capacity of pastoral organizations, supports initiatives to include pastoral organizations in national decision-making, supports improved access to services for pastoralists, and carries out research on the impact of climate change on pastoralists (Oxfam 2009)."
