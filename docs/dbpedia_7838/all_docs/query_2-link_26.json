        "text": "At first, the coup in Niger resembled others that have roiled West Africa in recent years. On July 26, soldiers detained Niger’s president at his home in the capital, Niamey. Hours later, they declared that they had seized power. Foreign powers condemned the putsch but did nothing.\n\nThen the coup took a different course.\n\nThe United States and France threatened to cut ties with Niger, endangering hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. The deposed president, Mohamed Bazoum, though detained, was at first able to speak with world leaders, receive visitors and post defiant messages on social media. (The guards keeping him under house arrest eventually confiscated his SIM cards.)\n\nNeighboring countries threatened to go to war — some to scuttle the coup, and others to ensure its success.\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States, a regional bloc of countries known as ECOWAS, issued an ultimatum to the junta on July 30: Restore Mr. Bazoum to power within one week or face the consequences, including possible military action.\n\nThat deadline expired on Sunday, and Niger’s future — and that of its 25 million people — hangs in the balance. The military leaders have closed Niger’s airspace, citing the potential threat of outside military intervention.\n\nThe neighboring countries of Mali and Burkina Faso have leaped to the junta’s defense, declaring that they would consider any foreign move against Niger as a “declaration of war” against them, too.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
