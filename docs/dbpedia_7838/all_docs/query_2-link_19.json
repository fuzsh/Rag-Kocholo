The three main policy objectives are the maintenance of national unity, the elevation of the living standards of the population, and the attainment of economic independence. The private sector of the economy consists partly of a multitude of small enterprises and partly of enterprises belonging to large French or international companies.\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and fishing\n\nOfficially:\n\nRepublic of Niger\n\nFrench:\n\nRépublique du Niger\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine (acting)1\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 26,292,000\n\nHead Of State :\n\nGen. Abdourahamane Tchiani1\n\nForm Of Government:\n\ntransitional military council1\n\nAgriculture and agricultural products constitute the largest sector of Niger’s economy in terms of the number of persons employed and the percentage of gross national product (GNP). Millet and sorghum, the main food crops, are grown in the south, as are cassava and sugarcane. Rice is grown in the Niger River valley.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 3:32 AM ET (Reuters)\n\nNiger soldiers kill 14 civilians mistaken for militants - official\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 3:18 AM ET (Reuters)\n\nNiger, Chad armies kill 38 Boko Haram fighters - Niger army\n\nAug. 6, 2024, 9:36 PM ET (AP)\n\nUS hands over its last military base in Niger to the ruling junta\n\nAug. 3, 2024, 3:19 PM ET (AP)\n\nTwo men who say they're Russian appear in hostage video from Niger released by al-Qaida-linked group\n\nLivestock is an important sector of the agricultural economy and is a major export. Cattle, sheep, and goats are raised for meat, milk, and hides.\n\nNiger’s ability to remain self-sufficient in food and livestock production is closely linked to rainfall, and periods of drought have resulted in shortfalls requiring imports and food aid. To increase production and avoid cereal shortfalls, the government has invested in irrigation projects and an “off-season growing program” of small-scale production and irrigation operations.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWhich Country Is Larger By Area? Quiz\n\nThe exploitation of plant resources has long been practiced but on a small scale. The doum palm and the palmyra palm provide wood for construction, while the palms of the Manga oasis produce dates. Small amounts of kapok (a silky down from the kapok tree, used for insulation, life jackets, and so forth) and of gum from the acacia gum tree are exported. Skins of ostriches, crocodiles, and snakes are used for handicrafts that are exported to Europe. Fish from the Niger River and Lake Chad are exported southward to the coastal countries.\n\nResources and power\n\nNiger’s known reserves of uranium rank among the most important in the world, and the country is one of the world’s top 10 leading producers of uranium. Deposits are found in central Niger, in the Aïr Massif area. Sites with mines that are active or in development include Arlit, Imouraren, and Dasa. Production fluctuates according to market demands.\n\nOther resources include salt, traditionally exploited in the Kaouar and Aïr regions as well as in the dallol and in the Manga district. Natron (hydrated sodium carbonate) is extracted locally. Cassiterite (an ore of tin) is mined at open workings in Aïr. Small quantities of gold are obtained by panning in the Sirba River. Limestone and an important deposit of gypsum have been located at Malbaza and in the Ader Doutchi and Majia region. Apart from tungsten in the Aïr region, traces of copper, lignite (a brownish black coal), molybdenum, zinc, phosphates, and titanium have been found and are the subject of further prospection. A reserve of iron ore, with an iron content of about 50 percent, has been located in the Say region, and petroleum deposits have been discovered and exploited in eastern and central Niger.\n\nPetroleum, supplemented by locally mined coal, is used to generate the vast majority of Niger’s electricity. Wood is the traditional domestic fuel.\n\nManufacturing\n\nManufacturing industries have been established, mostly at Niamey. They produce chemicals, food products, textiles, farm equipment, and metal furniture. Petroleum is refined in Zinder. There are many small craft industries in the principal towns.\n\nTrade\n\nNiger’s primary trading partners include Nigeria, France, and China. Niger encourages economic links between African countries. Apart from its membership in the African Union, Niger is also a member of the regional groups Conseil de l’Entente and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and a member of the African Continental Free Trade Area.\n\nTransportation\n\nWhile the economically active zone of Niger runs from east to west across the southern part of the country, the principal lines of communication run southward toward the coast. The two ports used by Niger—Cotonou in Benin and Lagos in Nigeria—are each more than 600 miles away, and Niger possesses no railroad. Traditional systems of transport and communication are still largely relied upon. These include camel caravans in the northern Sahel region, canoes on Lake Chad and the Niger, and individual travel on horseback or on foot. Only a small tonnage of goods is transported.\n\nTrucks maintain transport communications between Maradi and Zinder in Niger and Kano in Nigeria, and between Niamey and Parakou in Benin. A road completed in 1981 connects the uranium-producing centres of Arlit and Akouta to Nigerian transport links. The principal west–east road axis enters the country from Gao in Mali, runs on the banks of the Niger as far as Niamey, and then continues eastward to Nguigmi on Lake Chad. From this central route, roads branch off southward. Toward the north, routes running via Tahoua and Tânout converge near Agadez, linking Niger to Algeria via Tamanrasset.\n\nNiger Airlines provides domestic air services linking the country’s airports, including those of Maradi, Zinder, Agadez, and Dirkou. Niamey has an international airport."
