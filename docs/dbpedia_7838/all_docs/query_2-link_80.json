        "text": "The Africa-EU Partnership is the formal political channel for the EU’s relations with Africa. The African Union (AU), an inter-governmental organisation headquartered in Addis Ababa which brings together 55 African nations, is the EU’s political partner at continental level.\n\nBeyond the joint high-level meetings (i.e. Summits, Commission-to-Commission meetings and Ministerial meetings) that steer the relations, the EU engages in dialogues with various partners to advance on mutually agreed priorities.\n\nThe Africa-EU Partnership was established in 2000 at the first Africa-EU Summit in Cairo and continues to be guided by the Joint Africa-EU Strategy, which was adopted at the second EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in 2007.\n\nAt the last Summit held in Brussels on 17 and 18 February 2022, a Joint Vision for 2030 was adopted, with four deliverables at its heart: (i) Global Gateway Africa-Europe Investment Package - with EUR 150 billion worth of grants and investment supported by the EU budget (ii) renewed and enhanced cooperation for peace and security and (iii) on migration and mobility (iv) and a commitment to multilateralism within the rules-based international order, with the UN at its core.\n\nThe 11th meeting of the European Union and African Union Commissions took place on 28 November 2022 in Brussels. Both Commissions engaged on their strategic partnership and reviewed progress in the implementation of the joint commitments taken at the 6th EU-AU Summit in February 2022."
