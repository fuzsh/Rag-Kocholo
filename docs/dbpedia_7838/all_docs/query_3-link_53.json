        "text": "What the World Food Programme is doing in Niger\n\nEmergency preparedness and response\n\nWFP delivers life-saving food and nutritional assistance to crisis and shock-affected populations, including internally displaced people, refugees and host communities. Amid recurring crises, WFP also invests in anticipatory actions for extreme weather. These include providing climate information and cash transfers and involving communities in land restoration.\n\nAdaptative social protection\n\nWFP uses cash transfers to provide short-term relief in the aftermath of floods and droughts and enable households to invest in their livelihoods over time – which can reduce long-term dependency on humanitarian assistance.\n\nClimate sensitive livelihoods and asset creation\n\nWFP supports vulnerable communities in building resilient livelihoods through sustainable land and resource management. Participatory watershed planning and Food Assistance for Assets activities include regenerating land or restoring ponds.\n\nSupport for smallholder farmers\n\nSmallholder Agriculture Market Support is an integrated approach through which WFP supports smallholder farmers in producing and storing agricultural produce and helps connect these farmers to markets. This approach also sees WFP buying local produce to supply its own food and nutritional assistance. This helps to meet the food needs of the local population. while boosting farmers’ incomes.\n\nNutrition\n\nWFP’s nutrition prevention and treatment activities form part of our emergency response and integrated resilience programming, targeting especially children aged 6 to 59 months. WFP deploys community-based nutrition learning and rehabilitation centres Mothers and caregivers are placed in peer-support groups and can participate in awareness-raising and cooking demonstrations to learn how to prepare nutritious meals using locally available and affordable foods. The aim is to build community support, reduce travel time and dependency on imported specialized nutritional foods and boost local supply and demand.\n\nSchool meals\n\nWFP supports the Government of Niger in designing and implementing the national school-meal programme. WFP also promotes Home-Grown School Feeding, which links programmes to smallholder farmers. Particular attention is paid to female education, with a scholarship programme encouraging adolescent girls to stay at school.\n\nIn focus\n\nAs Niger’s men emigrate, women work to outwit a changing climate\n\nStory\n\nHunger and malnutrition surging across West and Central Africa, says report\n\nStory\n\nUNHAS at 20: Humanitarian response planes and helicopters touch down in tough places\n\nStory\n\nCOP28: Race is on to reel back hunger amid climate change\n\nStory\n\nAs political crisis rocks Niger, WFP stands firm with hunger and nutrition support\n\nStory\n\nNiger shows how WFP and partners can transform lives in Africa's harsh Sahel\n\nStory\n\nNiger news releases\n\nGo to page"
