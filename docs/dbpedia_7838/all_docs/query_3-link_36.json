        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nNiger became independent from France in 1960 and experienced single-party and military rule until 1991, when Gen. Ali SAIBOU was forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections, which resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999, BARE was killed in a counter coup by military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year. TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a constitutional amendment allowing him to extend his term as president. In February 2010, military officers led a coup that deposed TANDJA and suspended the constitution. ISSOUFOU Mahamadou was elected in April 2011 following the coup and reelected to a second term in early 2016. Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world with minimal government services and insufficient funds to develop its resource base, and is ranked last in the world on the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Index. The largely agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. The Nigerien Government continues its attempts to diversify the economy through increased oil production and mining projects. A Tuareg rebellion emerged in 2007 and ended in 2009. Niger is facing increased security concerns on its borders from various external threats including insecurity in Libya, spillover from the conflict in Mali, and violent extremism in northeastern Nigeria.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nWestern Africa, southeast of Algeria\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n16 00 N, 8 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 1.267 million sq km\n\nland: 1,266,700 sq km\n\nwater: 300 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 23\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly less than twice the size of Texas\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 5,834 km\n\nborder countries (7): Algeria 951 km, Benin 277 km, Burkina Faso 622 km, Chad 1196 km, Libya 342 km, Mali 838 km, Nigeria 1608 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km(landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\ndesert; mostly hot, dry, dusty; tropical in extreme south\n\nTerrain\n\npredominately desert plains and sand dunes; flat to rolling plains in south; hills in north\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 474 m\n\nlowest point: Niger River 200 m\n\nhighest point: Idoukal-n-Taghes 2,022 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nuranium, coal, iron ore, tin, phosphates, gold, molybdenum, gypsum, salt, petroleum\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 35.1% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 12.3% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 0.1% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 22.7% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 1% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 63.9% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n1,000 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmajority of the populace is located in the southernmost extreme of the country along the border with Nigeria and Benin\n\nNatural hazards\n\nrecurring droughts\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\novergrazing; soil erosion; deforestation; desertification; contaminated water; inadequate potable water; wildlife populations (such as elephant, hippopotamus, giraffe, and lion) threatened because of poaching and habitat destruction\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: Law of the Sea\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked; one of the hottest countries in the world; northern four-fifths is desert, southern one-fifth is savanna, suitable for livestock and limited agriculture\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n19,866,231 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 59\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Nigerien(s)\n\nadjective: Nigerien\n\nEthnic groups\n\nHausa 53.1%, Zarma/Songhai 21.2%, Tuareg 11%, Fulani (Peuhl) 6.5%, Kanuri 5.9%, Gurma 0.8%, Arab 0.4%, Tubu 0.4%, other/unavailable 0.9% (2006 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nFrench (official), Hausa, Djerma\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim 99.3%, Christian 0.3%, animist 0.2%, none 0.1% (2012 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nNiger has the highest total fertility rate (TFR) of any country in the world, averaging close to 7 children per woman in 2016. A slight decline in fertility over the last few decades has stalled. This leveling off of the high fertility rate is in large part a product of the continued desire for large families. In Niger, the TFR is lower than the desired fertility rate, which makes it unlikely that contraceptive use will increase. The high TFR sustains rapid population growth and a large youth population – almost 70% of the populace is under the age of 25. Gender inequality, including a lack of educational opportunities for women and early marriage and childbirth, also contributes to high population growth.Because of large family sizes, children are inheriting smaller and smaller parcels of land. The dependence of most Nigeriens on subsistence farming on increasingly small landholdings, coupled with declining rainfall and the resultant shrinkage of arable land, are all preventing food production from keeping up with population growth.For more than half a century, Niger's lack of economic development has led to steady net outmigration. In the 1960s, Nigeriens mainly migrated to coastal West African countries to work on a seasonal basis. Some headed to Libya and Algeria in the 1970s to work in the booming oil industry until its decline in the 1980s. Since the 1990s, the principal destinations for Nigerien labor migrants have been West African countries, especially Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire, while emigration to Europe and North America has remained modest. During the same period, Niger’s desert trade route town Agadez became a hub for West African and other sub-Saharan migrants crossing the Sahara to North Africa and sometimes onward to Europe.More than 60,000 Malian refugees have fled to Niger since violence between Malian government troops and armed rebels began in early 2012. Ongoing attacks by the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency, dating to 2013 in northern Nigeria and February 2015 in southeastern Niger, have pushed tens of thousands of Nigerian refugees and Nigerien returnees across the border to Niger and to displace thousands of locals in Niger’s already impoverished Diffa region.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 48.68%(male 4,878,031 /female 4,793,021)\n\n15-24 years: 19.36%(male 1,899,879 /female 1,945,806)\n\n25-54 years: 26.02%(male 2,581,597 /female 2,587,913)\n\n55-64 years: 3.3%(male 340,032 /female 315,142)\n\n65 years and over: 2.64%(male 268,072 /female 256,738) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 111.6 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 106.2 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 5.4 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 18.6 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 15.5 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 15.4 years\n\nfemale: 15.7 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 228\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n3.16% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 7\n\nBirth rate\n\n43.6 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 2\n\nDeath rate\n\n11.5 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 20\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-0.5 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 125\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmajority of the populace is located in the southernmost extreme of the country along the border with Nigeria and Benin\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 16.5% of total population(2019)\n\nrate of urbanization: 4.27% annual rate of change(2015-20 est.)\n\nMajor urban areas - population\n\n1.252 million NIAMEY (capital) (2019)\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\n0-14 years: 1.02 male(s)/female\n\n15-24 years: 0.98 male(s)/female\n\n25-54 years: 1 male(s)/female\n\n55-64 years: 1.08 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 1.04 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 1.01 male(s)/female (2018 est.)\n\nMother's mean age at first birth\n\n18.1 years (2012 est.)\n\nnote: median age at first birth among women 25-29\n\nMaternal mortality rate\n\n509 deaths/100,000 live births (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 20\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\ntotal: 79.4 deaths/1,000 live births (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 83.7 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 75 deaths/1,000 live births\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 5\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 56.3 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 55 years\n\nfemale: 57.7 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 216\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n6.35 children born/woman (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 1\n\nContraceptive prevalence rate\n\n11% (2018)\n\nDrinking water source\n\nimproved: urban: 100% of population\n\nrural: 48.6% of population\n\ntotal: 58.2% of population\n\nunimproved: urban: 0% of population\n\nrural: 51.4% of population\n\ntotal: 41.8% of population (2015 est.)\n\nCurrent Health Expenditure\n\n6.2% (2016)\n\nPhysicians density\n\n0.05 physicians/1,000 population (2014)\n\nSanitation facility access\n\nimproved: urban: 37.9% of population (2015 est.)\n\nrural: 4.6% of population (2015 est.)\n\ntotal: 10.9% of population (2015 est.)\n\nunimproved: urban: 62.1% of population (2015 est.)\n\nrural: 95.4% of population (2015 est.)\n\ntotal: 89.1% of population (2015 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate\n\n0.3% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 93\n\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS\n\n36,000 (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 70\n\nHIV/AIDS - deaths\n\n1,200 (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 58\n\nMajor infectious diseases\n\ndegree of risk: very high (2016)\n\nfood or waterborne diseases: bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever (2016)\n\nvectorborne diseases: malaria and dengue fever (2016)\n\nwater contact diseases: schistosomiasis (2016)\n\nanimal contact diseases: rabies (2016)\n\nrespiratory diseases: meningococcal meningitis (2016)\n\nObesity - adult prevalence rate\n\n5.5% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 177\n\nChildren under the age of 5 years underweight\n\n31.4% (2016)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 9\n\nEducation expenditures\n\n3.5% of GDP (2017)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 123\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 19.1%\n\nmale: 27.3%\n\nfemale: 11% (2015)\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)\n\ntotal: 6 years\n\nmale: 7 years\n\nfemale: 6 years (2017)\n\nUnemployment, youth ages 15-24\n\ntotal: 0.7%\n\nmale: 0.9%\n\nfemale: 0.4% (2014 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 180\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment\n\nCountry name\n\nconventional long form: Republic of Niger\n\nconventional short form: Niger\n\nlocal long form: Republique du Niger\n\nlocal short form: Niger\n\netymology: named for the Niger River that passes through the southwest of the country;

Agriculture contributes approximately 40% of GDP and provides livelihood for over 80% of the population. The UN ranked Niger as the second least developed country in the world in 2016 due to multiple factors such as food insecurity, lack of industry, high population growth, a weak educational sector, and few prospects for work outside of subsistence farming and herding.Since 2011 public debt has increased due to efforts to scale-up public investment, particularly that related to infrastructure, as well as due to increased security spending. The government relies on foreign donor resources for a large portion of its fiscal budget. The economy in recent years has been hurt by terrorist activity near its uranium mines and by instability in Mali and in the Diffa region of the country; concerns about security have resulted in increased support from regional and international partners on defense. Low uranium prices, demographics, and security expenditures may continue to put pressure on the government’s finances.The Government of Niger plans to exploit oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources to sustain future growth. Although Niger has sizable reserves of oil, the prolonged drop in oil prices has reduced profitability. Food insecurity and drought remain perennial problems for Niger, and the government plans to invest more in irrigation. Niger’s three-year $131 million IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF) agreement for the years 2012-15 was extended until the end of 2016. In February 2017, the IMF approved a new 3-year $134 million ECF. In June 2017, The World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) granted Niger $1 billion over three years for IDA18, a program to boost the country’s development and alleviate poverty. A $437 million Millennium Challenge Account compact for Niger, commencing in FY18, will focus on large-scale irrigation infrastructure development and community-based, climate-resilient agriculture, while promoting sustainable increases in agricultural productivity and sales.Formal private sector investment needed for economic diversification and growth remains a challenge, given the country’s limited domestic markets, access to credit, and competitiveness. Although President ISSOUFOU is courting foreign investors, including those from the US, as of April 2017, there were no US firms operating in Niger. In November 2017, the National Assembly passed the 2018 Finance Law that was geared towards raising government revenues and moving away from international support.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$21.86 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$20.84 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$19.87 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 146\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$8.224 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n4.9% (2017 est.)\n\n4.9% (2016 est.)\n\n4.3% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 55\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$1,200 (2017 est.)\n\n$1,100 (2016 est.)\n\n$1,100 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 224\n\nGross national saving\n\n22.4% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n20.6% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n21.2% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 80\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 70.2% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 9.4% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 38.6% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 16.4% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -34.6% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 41.6% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 19.5% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 38.7% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ncowpeas, cotton, peanuts, millet, sorghum, cassava (manioc, tapioca), rice;
