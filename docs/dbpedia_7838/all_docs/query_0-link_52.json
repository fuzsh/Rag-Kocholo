        "text": "by Jens Herpolsheimer\n\nIntroduction\n\nFollowing an intensification of normative contestation in the region, together with shifts in global politics and order, West Africa and the Sahel seem to be currently experiencing a redrawing and redefinition of regional spaces. On 28 January 2024, the military leaders of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger – who had recently formed the Alliance des Ètats du Sahel (AES) – declared their withdrawal from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), with immediate effect. While the ECOWAS statute does not allow for an immediate withdrawal, instead prescribing a one-year period, it nevertheless sent shockwaves across the political landscapes of West Africa and Africa more generally, and has put journalists, scholars and politicians before fundamental questions that indicate a critical crossroads for ECOWAS as a region and an organisation.[1] At this critical moment, this chapter takes stock of the evolution of ECOWAS, reflecting on its achievements, persistent challenges, as well as on the most recent series of military coups, and their entanglement in resurging geopolitics and global order.\n\nWho and what is ECOWAS?\n\nECOWAS was founded on 28 May 1975 in Lagos, Nigeria, by the heads of state of 15 West African: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Cabo Verde joined in 1977. Mauritania withdrew from the organisation in 1999/2000, as it wanted to join the Arab Maghreb Union instead, bringing ECOWAS membership back to fifteen. What becomes clear from this list of member states is that ECOWAS comprises a diverse membership, both with respect to economic strength, military capabilities, and political regimes. Although always careful not to alienate other members, subsequent Nigerian governments have played a crucial role both in the establishment of ECOWAS and in its operations. However, despite its economic strength and influential role in the region, Nigeria has not been able to impose its positions on other members, as most recently seen during the response to the military coup in Niger. From a normative perspective, Ghanaian governments have played an important role in recent efforts to reform ECOWAS and to lock in democratic gains. On the francophone side, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal have been the most influential member states in the organization, actively influencing regional positions, although this has sometimes led to disunity, pointing to the continued relevance of occasional divisions between anglophone and francophone states. This is, however, not to say that the other member states do not play important roles in the organization. For example, Togo has been instrumental in bringing ECOWAS together in the first place, helping the Nigerian government to bridge the gap between Anglophone and Francophone states in West Africa.[2] Likewise, president Umaro Sissoco Embaló of Guinea-Bissau has recently taken a very active leadership role during the presidency of his country from July 2022 to July 2023, and the same was the case for Liberia under president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf during her 2016-2017 mandate.\n\nAs the name suggests, ECOWAS was initially founded as an organisation primarily concerned with regional economic cooperation. However, West African leaders soon realised that this objective was impossible to separate from political and security concerns. This was reflected in subsequent protocols (i.e., the 1978 Protocol on Non-Aggression and the 1981 Protocol on Mutual Assistance on Defense), and eventually in the Revised ECOWAS Treaty of 1993 and the 1999 Protocol Relating to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution, Peace-keeping and Security (henceforth, the 1999 Mechanism).[3] With the adoption of the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community (AEC) in 1991 (3 June, Abuja, Nigeria), ECOWAS also became one of the so-called Regional Economic Communities (RECs), representing five African regions – i.e., North, East, South, Central, and West (the RECs are actually eight, however, with significant overlaps with some countries being members of more than one organization). In that capacity, ECOWAS has been the West African building block for continental economic integration, as well as for continental policies and international organisation in Africa more generally.[4]\n\nOperationally, ECOWAS is run by a complex combination of political and technical organs,[5] several community institutions,[6] the staff of the ECOWAS Commission (formerly Executive Secretariat), and the staff of a range of specialised agencies.[7] In addition, ECOWAS works closely with a few civil society organisations, for example including the West African Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP) and the West African Civil Society Initiative (WACSI). This non-conclusive list of different state and non-state actors that contribute to the agency of ECOWAS points to the organisation’s complex collective agency,[8] across a wide variety of policy fields. Although more and more of these policy areas have been related to security concerns (e.g., climate change, migration, health and energy), ECOWAS is about much more than just economic and security cooperation.[9] Nevertheless, governance, peace and security continue to be key dimensions,[10] and are, therefore, the main focus of this chapter.\n\nIn this context, the ECOWAS Commission is a key hub and actor, where the intricate dynamics of collective agency converge and are effectively managed on a daily basis.. Initially set up as the ECOWAS Executive Secretariat in Lagos in 1977, it steadily grew, expanding its portfolio and staff numbers. In 1998, the Secretariat relocated to Abuja to provide more adequate office space, and in 2006/07, the ECOWAS heads of state and government transformed it into the ECOWAS Commission. In 2017, research found a total of about 1,300 (short and long-term) staff members working at the Commission.[11] Since its very beginning, the body has engaged external donors and partners to mobilize resources for the implementation of regional programs. These actors have also played crucial roles in institutional capacity building. The most important in this respect were the European Union (EU) and some EU member states (e.g., Germany, Denmark).[12]\n\nAchievements\n\nSince its creation in 1975, ECOWAS has come a very long way and has constantly adapted itself to changing situations both regionally and globally.[13] ECOWAS actors have been innovators, and the organisation has been an example and inspiration for other African regional entities, including the African Union and other RECs. This has been the case both for practices and policies that have co-evolved. For example, ECOWAS has received particular recognition for its trailblazing role in regional conflict intervention, free movement of goods and people, and an outstanding degree of financial self-reliance based on its community levy. More recently, it has also been recognised for its important role during the Covid-19 pandemic.[14]\n\nStarting during the 1990s, ECOWAS heads of state and government ventured into active military (and police) interventions during several violent conflicts in West Africa, breaking with the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of member states.[15] Based on these experiences, ECOWAS actors began to develop a broad toolkit and set of practices for conflict intervention, subsequently institutionalised in the 1999 Mechanism. These turned out to be mainly “non-military” practices and were employed relatively consistently over time and in different conflicts. Despite mixed results with respect to conflict management and frequent criticism, they significantly contributed to regional identity building and the construction of a more coherent regional space.[16]\n\nIn addition, the development of a comprehensive set of normative and policy frameworks has been among the key achievements and continues to be one of ECOWAS’ most valued contributions by international partners. Following the 1999 Mechanism, ECOWAS heads of state and government set out to adopt a series of far reaching commitments, principles and rules, for example, codified in the 2001 Supplementary Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance, the 2008 ECOWAS Conflict Prevention Framework, and a range of policy guidelines (e.g., on defense and security sector reform, mediation, election observation and maritime affairs). Whatever the commitment by member states to them has been since, these frameworks stand and lay out a clear vision for the region. They also mark an important reference point for civil society and international players to make claims and call out political actors. Along African Union’s policy processes, they have changed the way in which conflicts in West Africa, including in the Sahel, were framed, and what responses were (in)acceptable – acting as key fora for dialogue, negotiation, and political thinking.[17]\n\nPersistent challenges and recent coups d’état in the Sahel\n\nDespite some commonalities, West African countries have been hosts to a significant variety of historical experiences, political systems, and difficult socio-economic conditions. Bringing them together has been a key challenge for ECOWAS as an organisation since its very inception.[18] Moreover, high rates of external dependency and external interference in regional economic and political affairs have often negatively affected politics in member states. Together, all these factors have contributed to recurring political instability in many West African states, often negatively impacting neighboring states, and carrying the potential to “spill-over” into the wider region (and beyond it).[19] Therefore, although among the strongest African regional organisations, ECOWAS finds itself in a particularly challenged geographical area.\n\nAt the same time, ECOWAS politics have been characterized by considerable internal contestation and recurring disunity on how to respond to critical situations or outright violent conflicts. While the comprehensive frameworks that came out of the “window of opportunity” during the late 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s still reflect a shared aspiration for the ECOWAS region, the specific interpretation of underlying norms and practices continues to be subject to intense debate and often controversy. As a result, the political will and buy-in by some member states have remained low, causing divisions, and hampering the organisation’s ability to act swiftly and decisively.[20] Most recently, this has been reflected in a drawn-out debate over a proposed revision of the 2001 Supplementary Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance, to address the contested issue of presidential term limits and constitutional manipulations, among other elements.[21] During the last ten years, these have led to recurring crises across several West African states, and at least in one case triggered a military coup (i.e., Guinea, September 2021). However, as things currently stand, a revision of the 2001 Protocol may also hold great risks, as it might fall back behind the achievements and provisions of the original protocol.\n\nWhile not being an entirely new phenomena, during the last 20 years, transnational organised crime and violent extremism have become key issues further compounding problems that ECOWAS is facing. To date, efforts by ECOWAS and the African Union, just as massive efforts by the international community at large (i.e., French, EU and UN missions, as well as US programs), have been unable to come any closer to solving these problems.[22] Insecurity particularly, although not exclusively, in the Sahel countries has remained high or even increased, which also contributed to the most recent series of military coups in those countries: in August 2020 and May 2021 in Mali, in April 2021 the unconstitutional transfer of power in Chad, in January and September 2022 in Burkina Faso and in July 2023 in Niger.[23]\n\nReflecting the challenges identified above, but also an inability of the international community more generally, ECOWAS actors have struggled (and effectively failed), not only to restore constitutional order and democratic regimes, but increasingly also to establish access and channels of communication with the coup makers and key political actors in those countries. ECOWAS responses have largely followed established practices (e.g., diplomatic contact and mediation, threats and sanctions). However, faced with a strategic counter-alliance among the coup makers, supported by external actors,[24] and disunity among ECOWAS member states, these measures have been largely ineffective. While the Sahelian states have long tried to distinguish themselves within ECOWAS,[25] this strong counterposition already indicated a growing divide and distancing from the community’s fundamental principles. This was powerfully underlined by the creation of the AES by the military leaders of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, on 16 September 2023,[26] and ultimately their withdrawal from ECOWAS, announced on 28 January 2024.[27] Faced with this new situation, ECOWAS has recently changed its strategy, lifting most of the sanctions on the AES states. This decision reflects both pragmatism, accepting realities on the ground and the very limited courses of action, as well as the accommodation of ECOWAS member states that were opposed to strong interventions especially in Niger all along, avoiding further internal contestation.\n\nPart of geopolitics and global ordering\n\nAt this point it is once again of essential importance to recognise West African politics – and notably politics in the Sahel – as part of and deeply embedded in resurging global geopolitics.[28] Strong anti-(neo)colonial rhetoric has translated into anti-European and in particular anti-French sentiments, leading to the withdrawal of French, EU and UN missions from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger (e.g., Operation Barkhane, EUTM Mali, EUMPM Niger, EUCAP Sahel Niger, MINUSMA). Moreover, despite ECOWAS’ history, emerging and evolving as a response to fend of external (in particular French) interference in West Africa, it is now being framed as an agent of French imperialism by the coup regimes.[29] This has coincided with a surge of activity by Russian actors in West Africa and Africa more generally. Most importantly, the Wagner Group, now rebranded “Africa Corps”, has become firmly embedded in Sahelian states, but at least in its response to the coup in Niger, ECOWAS has also been directly and publicly opposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.[30] In this way, Russian actors have helped to prop up an anti-ECOWAS stance, and lead the organisation back to one of its primary initial concerns: fending of external interference (and foreign mercenaries in particular), aiming to undermine and divide ECOWAS states and the region.\n\nWhat becomes clear from these events is that regionalism as a practice is not in question – i.e., the AES constitutes a new regional organisation and, for the time being, the three Sahel states continue to be members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) and the African Union. However, very much in question are the liberal core principles and normative underpinnings of ECOWAS. Therefore, the recent developments pose a critical challenge, but may also offer a new opportunity to re-define what ECOWAS should and wants to be about, and how the organisation positions itself in the international arena. So far, ECOWAS has acted as a frontier, mediating between liberal (Western) norms and imagined order, which it embraces in its foundational and framework documents, and newly (re)emerging anti-Western more authoritarian trends. As mentioned above, a community of practice of international bureaucrats has played critical roles in this respect. It is this function as a critical frontier that gives the organisation its relevance.\n\nThis is not to say that it has chosen any side, other than its own, which ECOWAS actors continue to contest, negotiate, and adapt. The options that come with “new” partners / alliances will increase the room for maneuver of African actors, but simultaneously also bear the risk of increasing fragmentation among them.[31] No matter what differences among Sahelian states and other West African states may exist, they all stand to lose if they cease their efforts to find common ground.\n\n[1] E.g., see N.
