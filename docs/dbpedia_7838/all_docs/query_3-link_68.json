        "text": "Since the 1980s, Niger has been ranked near the bottom of the Human Development Index. With one of the highest fertility rates placing chronic strain on basic services, the country is plagued by insecurity, disease outbreaks and violence against women. Frequent droughts and floods leave farmers struggling to feed millions.\n\nIn 2023, a coup shook Niger, triggering mass instability and accelerating the country’s ongoing humanitarian crisis. The coup caused a sharp deterioration in Niger’s relations with many regional and global partners. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) levied significant economic and financial sanctions on the country, including the freezing of foreign assets and suspension of financial assistance. The EU, U.S. and World Bank also cut financial support to Niger, while the country’s new military government reduced state spending by 40%.\n\nAlthough ECOWAS lifted some sanctions on Niger in February 2024, humanitarian needs in the country remain high.\n\nNow, civilians in Niger are bearing the brunt of climate shocks, international sanctions and financial restrictions, and the fallout of the conflict between the new central government and nonstate armed groups.\n\nLearn more about the crisis in Niger.\n\nAs violence spreads, people are forced to keep moving in search of safety and resources—some 4.3 million people are now in need of humanitarian support. The country is facing one of the world’s worst food insecurity crises due to the combined impact of conflict and climate change, with the upcoming El Niño season likely to deepen needs.\n\nMeanwhile, Niger’s government is primed to prioritize military spending over funding critical public services amidst a shortfall in international support, due in part to the 2023 coup."
