        "text": "Niger is a country in north-east West Africa that covers an area of 1,267,000 km², two-thirds of which is occupied by the Sahara Desert. It has an estimated population of 15.9 million composed of 50.1% women and 49.9% men; 79.6% of this population lives in rural areas. Due to its geographical location, the country is subject to climatic hazards linked to a hostile environmental context and prolonged periods of droughts resulting in a situation of chronic food insecurity that make Niger one of the poorest countries in the world. National statistics show a poverty rate of 60% for the country.\n\nUN Women in Niger\n\nUN Women in Niger is developing partnerships to achieve lasting social change in the following areas: Governance and decentralization; Economic development; Gender-responsive budgeting; Combating violence against women; Gender mainstreaming in policy; national strategies and programs; and Promotion of women's rights as part of its coordinating role.\n\nOngoing programs"
