        "text": "Niger: monthly report July 2024\n\nTensions grow between ECOWAS and members of the so-called Sahel Alliance. The early July summit in Niamey, held 24 hours after the assembly of the West African bloc in Abuja, saw Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso announce the formation of the Confederation of Sahel States. This new entity remains somewhat vague, with the document signed by the three heads of state, the so-called Niamey Charter, stating the three juntas' intention not to rejoin ECOWAS, rejecting any prospect of dialogue with its member countries. ECOWAS has appeared weaker in this instance and continues to seek dialogue with the juntas, with Senegal’s newly elected president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, tasked officially to reinstate the cooperation with the three breakaway countries. Also on the agenda at the Abuja summit were the creation of the organization's new anti-terrorism force and the adoption of the alternative currency to the CFA Franc, the Eco, both of which seem completely secondary compared to the organization’s current primary interest of mending relations with the juntas.\n\nParticularly significant were the developments regarding Niger. The break with ECOWAS, in fact, goes hand in hand with the process of revising alliances initiated by the junta led by General Tchiani, who this month added two new elements to this dynamic. The first is the break with Germany, marked by the announcement by Berlin's defense ministry of the withdrawal of its contingent stationed in Niamey by August 31. According to the German government, talks with the Nigerien generals stalled over the issue of immunities for Bundeswehr personnel, which needed to be renegotiated following the cancellation of the defense agreement by the transitional government after the July 2023 coup. Tchiani’s junta allegedly sought to impose an agreement that provided immunities only for the highest-ranking members of the contingent, clashing with Berlin's refusal. After the withdrawal announcement, the German government, through Foreign Minister Baerbock, stated that it is working on preparing a new deployment in West Africa, which will most likely take place in Ivory Coast, where American personnel recently relocated after withdrawing from Niger. Almost simultaneously with the German withdrawal announcement, a high-level Turkish delegation, led by Foreign Minister Fidan, landed in Niamey. the ministers of defense, energy, the head of MIT, Kalin, and the president of the Defense Industry, Gorgun were also present. Absolute secrecy surrounds the subject of the talks between the leaderships of Ankara and Niamey. However, everything points to a possible “uranium for safety” exchange , with Turkiye ready to step up its support for Niger’s counterinsurgency operations.\n\nIn the context of the dichotomy between dictatorships and democratic regimes, July was also the month of the presidential elections in Mauritania, which saw the re-election of the incumbent president Mohamed Ould Ghazouani. This is an excellent news for the Euro-Atlantic axis, which has forged important relations with the current Mauritanian president during his first term. Mauritania is now NATO's main ally for regional security and the last stronghold of the European Union in the central-western Sahel. The presidential competition largely confirmed the results of the 2023 parliamentary elections, with the crisis of the Islamist movement Tewassoul and the confirmation of anti-slavery activist Biram Dah Abeid as leader of the opposition. This electoral round was not without controversy, with Dah Abeid's party announcing appeals and peaceful demonstrations before validation by the Supreme Court. After the electoral confirmation, Ghazouani can now focus on his agenda commitments, primarily capitalizing on the country's energy resources in tandem with the new Senegalese administration and more extensive implementation of the anti-slavery law. However, the shadow of former President Ould Taya, still in prison after his corruption conviction, continues to loom over the new Mauritanian administration, as he is expected to make his influence in Mauritanian politics following the rejection of his presidential candidacy.\n\nDownload the July 2024 report"
