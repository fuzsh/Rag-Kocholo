        "text": "COUNTRY OVERVIEW\n\nLocated Located in the heart of the Sahel, Niger has a poorly diversified economy, dependent on agriculture for 40% of its GDP. The extreme poverty rate is expected to reach 52.0% in 2023 due to negative per capita growth and rising inflation, which, compared to 2022, will increase the extremely poor population by nearly 1.1 million bringing the total to 14.1 million people in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, UNOCHA reported 4.3 million people, or 17% of the population, requiring humanitarian assistance in Niger, compared to 3.7 million in 2022. By January 2024, according to UNHCR, Niger hosted almost 690,000 refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced people (IDPs), a majority of which are hosted in Tillaberi, Tahoua, and Diffa regions.\n\nPolitical background\n\nMohamed Bazoum was elected president in the December 2020 and February 2021 elections. He was the first to democratically succeed his predecessor. But on July 26, 2023, members of his presidential guard dismissed him, justifying their decision by saying they wanted to avoid further economic and security problems.\n\nFollowing this move, at an emergency summit held in Nigeria on July 30, 2023, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) strongly condemned the coup and imposed severe sanctions against the country. These included the closure of land and air borders with Niger, as well as financial sanctions such as the freezing of service transactions, including utilities and electricity, and the freezing of Nigerien assets at the regional central bank (BCEAO). These sanctions had a profoundly negative impact on the population, notably by increasing the cost of living and causing a lack of electricity due to Nigeria stopping its electricity service to Niger. The sanctions were lifted by ECOWAS on February 24, 2024, following the announcement by Niger and other countries of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), including Burkina Faso and Mali, of their withdrawal from ECOWAS.\n\nEconomic situation\n\nGrowth in 2023 is expected to be only 1.2% due to the combined effects of political, security, and climate crises. ECOWAS trade sanctions and border closures have reduced exports, including delaying crude oil exports through the new pipeline, which has now been completed and commissioned. Inadequate rainfall, crop pests, localized flooding, declining soil fertility, and insecurity in some key production areas have reduced agricultural production, despite a strong output from irrigated agriculture. The sanctions have also led to losses in the private sector, a liquidity crisis, and a deterioration of portfolios in the banking sector.\n\nAfter declining consecutively between January and July 2023, inflation has risen continuously since August 2023 due to low agricultural production and border closures. To counter inflation across WAEMU countries, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) raised policy interest rates by a cumulative 150 basis points since mid-2022 to 3.5% for liquidity calls and 5.5% for the marginal lending facility. However, inflation in the region (3.7% in 2023) was still above the 3% target and foreign exchange reserves have been on a downward trend, estimated at 3.5 months of imports at end-2023, down from 4.3 months at end-2022.\n\nThe rise in food prices is expected to increase the poverty rate and has led to a worrying level of food security, with 2.3 million people estimated to be severely food insecure during November-December 2023, according to The Cadre Harmonisé analysis.\n\nIn response to the sanctions and the disruption in external financing, the authorities revised the 2023 budget by cutting capital expenditures. The budget deficit for 2023 is expected to be 3.9% of GDP and public debt is expected to reach 58.2% of GDP. The government has accumulated domestic arrears, as well as arrears with regional and international development institutions.\n\nOutlook\n\nWith sanctions lifted at the end of February, growth is projected to rebound to 6.9% in 2024 under the following assumptions: (i) Niger - along with Burkina Faso and Mali- orderly exit ECOWAS in 2025 and remain part of WAEMU; (ii) large-scale oil production and exports is effective; (iii) international development financing resumes in H1-2024; (iv) agricultural campaign is not subject to climate shocks; and (v) there is no further deterioration of the security situation. However, GDP levels would be significantly lower in 2024 and 2025 compared to their pre-coup projected paths. Inflation is expected to moderate to 3.5% in 2024 following the lifting of the sanctions and moderating food prices following the resumption of large-scale imports.\n\nThe extreme poverty rate is projected to decrease by 2 percentage points to 50.0% by 2026 given solid growth in service and agriculture sectors and policies that uses increased oil revenues for the population. However, due to demographic growth, the number of extreme poor would increase by 1.9 million people avec the period 2023-2026.\n\nRevenue in 2024, including grants, is projected to be around 11.0% of GDP, lower than projected in the approved budget, which would likely lead to capital expenditure rationing. With limited access to financing, the budget deficit is projected to be 2.6% of GDP, including an accumulation of domestic arrears.\n\nLast Updated: Mar 19, 2024\n\nThe following are examples of progress made possible by World Bank financing:\n\nHealth:\n\nThe World Bank is contributing to Niger’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts by providing technical and financial support in the following areas:\n\nSupport for preparedness and response through the REDISSE and COVID-19 projects\n\nSupport with the implementation of the country’s COVID-19 response plan\n\nVaccine procurement and deployment\n\nIn parallel, the Bank is continuing its efforts to maintain access to quality and affordable basic services despite the emergency response to COVID-19, focusing in particular on maternal and child health services in order to help build the country’s resilience and support the economic recovery.\n\nAt the same time, the World Bank’s commitment to help Niger accelerate the demographic transition, improve health and nutrition, and empower women and girls is on track. The World Bank has made reducing gender inequalities a central focus of its support in Niger, including promoting girls’ access to education, reproductive health services, and economic opportunities as a key way to reduce child marriage and high fertility rates.\n\nKey results include the following:\n\n1. Nearly six million women of reproductive age and children under five use a range of basic reproductive health and nutrition services, 4.2 million children are vaccinated, nearly 1.6 million births are attended by skilled personnel, and 94 percent of facilities report their monthly results on time.\n\n2. Improvement in girls’ access to and retention through (i) the “All Girls in School” subproject; (ii) the financing of the subproject “Safe Spaces and Clubs for Future Husbands.”\n\n3. Improved supply chain of reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health products.\n\nEnergy\n\nThe World Bank’s efforts in Niger’s energy sector address four related challenges: (i) significantly increase access to electricity for all, improve the quality of access to electricity for current and future consumers by strengthening and developing the energy infrastructure; (ii) increase the availability of electricity to the population through the development of new and renewable energy sources; (iii) increase and diversify low-cost, low-emission electricity supply sources through domestic renewable energy sources and regional electricity interconnections; and (iv) ensure the financial viability of the energy sector for a sustainable, high-quality and affordable electricity supply for the population.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Niger and the World Bank have developed a partnership rich in commitments throughout the energy sector value chain, mobilizing significant financial resources. The World Bank’s current commitment to Niger stands at $1,207.5 million for the financing of three national projects and four regional projects in the power sector, including the Kandadji dam program. These projects are expected to provide access to electricity for more than 4.5 million persons.\n\nIn addition, the Bank is financing and assisting the government of Niger in the preparation of a low-cost renewable energy production plan that will be a key tool for future generation capacity.\n\nSocial Safety Nets\n\nThe World Bank has been providing support to the government for almost 10 years for the development of an effective social protection system. The aim is to support the poorest households by providing monthly cash transfers in conjunction with other measures to strengthen human capital and develop productive activities. This program also helps households improve resilience and cope with unexpected shocks, such as those associated with climate change.\n\nThe Adaptive Safety Net Project 2 “Wadata Talaka” (PFSA 2), which became effective on June 20, 2019, has directly benefited more than three million persons as follows:\n\n30,000 households (around 210,000 persons) have benefited from monthly transfers of CFAF 15,000[1] over 24 months, as part of the program of cash transfers to build resilience.\n\n13,200 households (about 92,000 persons) have benefited from the establishment of cash-for-work activities, which led in 2020 to the construction and/or rehabilitation of some 40 community assets.\n\nCash transfers in response to the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19: 400,000 urban and rural households (approximately 2,800,000 persons) each received a one-time transfer of CFAF 45,000, with a total value of $36 million.\n\n30,000 households participating in the cash transfer program benefited from the implementation of support and awareness-raising measures designed to encourage behavioral change to enhance their resilience and strengthen the human capital of their children.\n\n[1] On March 17, 2023, $1 was equal to CFAF 618.\n\nLast Updated: Mar 23, 2023"
