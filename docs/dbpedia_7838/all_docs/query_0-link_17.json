        "text": "In spite of experiencing its first transfer of power from one civilian government to another in March 2021, Niger’s political path remains highly uncertain and prone to volatility. While the exact nature of the 2020/2021 elections remains unclear due to the lack of a substantial team of election observers, significant concerns arose over potential electoral manipulation and the risk of electoral violence. Although the Bazoum administration publicly professes commitment to democratic principles, its approach to handling street protests and government critics closely mirrors that of its predecessor. Despite the government’s ongoing efforts to suppress dissenting voices, a resilient civil society and vocal media outlets continue to thrive. Consequently, Niger stands as a hybrid political regime, grappling with challenges to democratic norms and institutions.\n\nIn March 2021, an attempted coup by a small faction of soldiers failed disastrously. Nevertheless, this incident underscores the potential for political dynamics akin to those witnessed in Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad, and Guinea to reemerge in Niger.\n\nNiger persists in grappling with a complex economic landscape marked by a burgeoning debt crisis, an inefficient and corrupt state bureaucracy, stark divisions between the affluent minority and the impoverished majority, a political class unable to address economic hurdles, and Western donors prioritizing security and stability over economic advancement and democratic liberties.\n\nNiger continues to serve as a dependable diplomatic ally. Niamey has emerged as a vocal critic of junta-led governments in Mali and Burkina Faso, while simultaneously engaging in economic and military collaborations with both nations. It also seeks close ties with Chad, advocating for regional stability. Despite Nigeria’s unpredictable political climate, economic and diplomatic relations with Abuja remain harmonious. Niamey steadfastly supports intra-African economic cooperation and integration. On a global scale, Niger stands as the sole nation that participated in drafting a U.N. resolution opposing Russia’s intervention in Ukraine. In contrast to Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger isn’t pursuing improved relations with Moscow; instead, it has opted for closer connections with France and the United States.\n\nSince independence in 1960, Niger has endured lengthy periods of authoritarian, military-dominated rule. Since the onset of multiparty democracy in 1993, the country has had five constitutions and one interim civilian government (1991 – 1993), three periods of civilian governments (1993 – 1996, 2000 – 2009 and 2011 – present), one period of military rule (1996 – 1999), and two interim military governments (1999 and 2010 – 2011). Since the return of civilian rule, the country has seen two failed military coups, one in 2015, the other in 2021.\n\nThe most recent transition to civilian rule in 2011 (the Seventh Republic) saw the election of Mahamadou Issoufou and his party, PNDS-Tarayya, to power. In 2016, Issoufou secured a second term. The 2020/2021 presidential and legislative elections resulted in the country’s first peaceful handover of power from one civilian government to the next. Since 2013, Niger has experienced a gradual but ongoing democratic rollback. Under the administration of President Mohamed Bazoum, this trend continues.\n\nAuthoritarian rule began in 1958, two years before the country gained independence from France, when Hamani Diori established a repressive one-party regime. In 1974, the military, led by Seyni Kountché, toppled Diori amid an economic crisis and severe drought. Following Kountché’s death in 1987, the (civilian-led) Second Republic was established under the National Movement for the Development of Society-Nassara (MNSD-Nassara) party. Responding to regional and domestic pressure from trade unions, students and those behind the Tuareg rebellion, then-President Ali Saibou initiated democratic reforms in the early 1990s. Niger held a national conference in 1991 that resulted in a constitutional referendum and relatively free and fair elections in 1993 (the Third Republic).\n\nMahamane Ousmane of the Democratic and Social Convention (CDS-Rahama) party was the country’s first democratically elected president in 1993. He came, however, into conflict with parliament after opposition parties withdrew from the government coalition. Early parliamentary elections in 1994 forced Ousmane to appoint Hama Amadou (MNSD-Nassara) as prime minister. The subsequent paralysis of political institutions in this semi-presidential system ultimately provoked a military coup led by Colonel Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara on January 27, 1996. The coup reflected widespread dissatisfaction and persistent aspirations to power within the military. In response to foreign pressure, Maïnassara held new elections. Non-competitive conditions and a boycott by opposition parties allowed him to win the July 1996 presidential election and November 1996 legislative elections, which ushered in the Fourth Republic.\n\nThree years of superficially liberalized authoritarianism followed until Maïnassara was assassinated during a military coup launched in April 1999. The coup’s leader, Major Daouda Malam Wanké, relaunched the process of democratization. This process led to a constitutional referendum, and parliamentary and presidential elections in July, October and November 1999, respectively. President Mamadou Tandja governed with the help of a coalition between the MNSD-Nassara and CDS-Rahama. The Fifth Republic (2000 – 2009) marked a period of comparative stability. Until August 2009, the work of political institutions progressed relatively smoothly despite the potential for conflict in the semi-presidential system. The free and fair general elections at the end of 2004 confirmed Tandja and his governing coalition. This government was the first since 1992 to ensure that the public sector and military personnel received regular payments. In doing so, it prevented another vicious cycle of general strikes, which had crippled Niger’s economy throughout the 1990s and been a major source of political instability.\n\nStability was nonetheless threatened by a renewed Tuareg rebellion that lasted from 2007 to 2009. The rebellion had a negative impact on speech and press freedoms in Niger. Journalists reporting critically on the government’s activities regarding the Tuareg or on alleged government corruption were subjected to arbitrary arrests and police violence. Beginning in 2005, Tandja and then-Prime Minister Amadou (both from the MNSD-Nassara) began to fall out with each other. In June 2007, Amadou was forced to step down and was replaced by Seyni Oumarou. Tandja’s subsequent attempts to change the constitution to allow himself to remain in office beyond 2009 initially proved successful. However, Tandja was eventually ousted by the military in February 2010. The military organized a transition to democracy that resulted in a constitutional referendum, and free and fair elections being held in early 2011.\n\nBeginning in 2013, the Issoufou government used the security services to crack down on critical journalists, civil society organizations and opposition politicians. The most prominent politician subjected to such tactics, Hama Amadou, was accused of being involved in a baby-smuggling ring and was forced to contest the 2016 elections while in prison. He was not allowed to run in the 2020 presidential elections. Issoufou’s hand-picked successor Mohamed Bazoum continued Issoufou’s handling of the opposition and of street protest.\n\nThe appalling socioeconomic conditions in Niger account for many of the political upheavals of the last decades. Since the early 1970s, drought, desertification, government intervention and bad governance have aggravated a weak economic environment. The uranium boom of the late 1970s subsided rapidly in Niger, whose economy is dominated by agriculture. The considerable national debt incurred by the country between 1983 and 1986 necessitated an IMF structural adjustment program. Given the political instability of the era, there were several irregularities in implementing the IMF program, which led to its intermittent suspension. The implementation of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) between 1996 and 1999 met with the approval of international financial institutions. After a brief disruption, the transitional government and the Tandja government normalized relations with international donors, which paved the way for several subsequent Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) programs. In April 2004, Niger reached the completion point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), with debt relief totaling $663.1 million.\n\nNiger continues to receive extensive loans under the IMF’s extended credit facility. Despite a dramatic increase in donor funding over the last decade, Niger continues to be plagued by extreme poverty, unsustainable and inefficient public spending, widespread illiteracy, and a rapidly growing population, and it additionally remains dependent on uranium and oil revenues. Over the course of the last decade, Niger’s debt has worsened considerably with the debt burden now totaling around half of its GDP. This occurred despite solid and considerable annual GDP growth rates (between 3% and 5%) over the last 10 years. The encouraging growth rates did little to lift the country’s majority population out of poverty, although the Issoufou government made progress with regard to the fight against extreme poverty.\n\nThe vast majority of the Nigerien population views the nation-state as legitimate. According to survey data from Afrobarometer (data collected in 2022), three-quarters of the Nigerien population trust the police and the armed forces. Over 70% of all respondents stated that they trusted individuals from ethnic groups other than their own. In 2018/19 (no data for 2022), over half of all respondents stated that they viewed themselves first and foremost as Nigeriens rather than as members of a specific ethnic group. This is a very high value within the context of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHaving for decades perceived themselves as a marginalized group, the Tuareg – themselves a socially and politically heterogeneous group – have initiated several rebellions (1961 – 1964, 1990 – 1995, and 2007 – 2009). Their basic demands include improving their access to state services and political representation in Niamey. These demands have not been completely met, though their participation in local and national politics has improved over the last decade. The (secret) peace agreement between the former Tandja government and the Tuareg rebels called for improvements with regard to both. During the Issoufou presidency (2011 – 2021), a Tuareg, Brigi Rafini, held the position of prime minister. His tenure has had a positive effect on the relationship between the central government and the Tuareg in the north. However, there is little that indicates that the Nigerien Tuareg will take up arms against the central government now or in the near future.\n\nTraditionally, the government has sought to maintain a balanced representation of ethnicities among its employees and within the cabinet. This practice remains unchanged under President Bazoum. In fact, the ongoing war against Boko Haram in the Diffa region has prompted President Issoufou to call on all communities to stay united in the fight against terrorism. While there are ethnic and regional divisions in Nigerien politics, they have minimal impact on daily party politics.\n\nNational elections are regularly held in Niger. The constitution provides for universal suffrage with secret ballots, and free access for citizens to compete in elections.\n\nThe legislative elections and the first round of the presidential elections took place in December 2020. According to reports by international, regional, and domestic observers, the first round of the presidential elections and the legislative elections were held in a proper manner. The opposition had questioned the integrity of the electoral register and the independence of the electoral commission in the run-up to the election. Assessing these claims, which always arise before elections, proves challenging. There were also isolated reports of vote-buying.\n\nHowever, the outcome of the runoff of the presidential elections between Issoufou’s hand-picked successor Bazoum and former President Ousmane (1993 – 1996) led to three days of rioting in Niamey and other cities. Serious concerns arose regarding the accuracy of the presidential election results in the rural areas of the country’s interior. The lack of systematic and large-scale international or national election observation missions made it impossible to accurately assess the extent to which the presidential elections were free and fair.\n\nThis, however, is not a new situation for Niger, where any analysis of the electoral outcome is shaped by deepening partisanism. The riots are most likely an outcome of this partisanism. Given that the new government took over power and that the opposition grudgingly accepted the outcome, one can assume that, although the elections were far from perfect, the electoral outcome corresponded to the view of the majority.\n\nThe president’s main political opponent, former Prime Minister Hama Amadou, was not allowed to stand as a presidential candidate due to his controversial condemnation of baby smuggling. The Constitutional Court disqualified his candidacy.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic meant that political rallies could not take place, posing problems for all political parties. Some reports indicated that a few opposition rallies were disproportionately affected by the ban’s implementation.\n\nSince the return of multiparty democracy in 1993, democratically elected political representatives have had significant power to govern. However, there are several crucial groups that can undermine democratic procedures. Niger remains heavily reliant on the support of foreign donors and military aid, granting outside powers the ability to influence domestic decision-making. Though there is limited evidence of outside powers utilizing this influence, there is a valid reason to believe that their presence aided in stabilizing former President Issoufou’s semi-authoritarian government, particularly during his second term.\n\nThe armed forces represent a second potential veto player. Since 1993, the armed forces have overthrown three civilian governments (in 1996, 1999, and 2010). However, in 1999 and 2010, the armed forces handed power over to democratically elected civilians, indicating some commitment to the principle of civilian oversight in politics. The government quashed coup attempts in December 2015 and in March 2021. The coup attempt in March 2021 was plotted by officers within the Air and Land forces, who viewed Bazoum Mohamed as a non-Nigerien and thus unfit to lead the country. Some of them had also become frustrated by the growing number of soldiers who had lost their lives in the conflict with the various jihadi-Salafi organizations in the border areas with Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Mali. However, within the military, the coup enjoyed little to no support and failed dismally. There is no indication that the military at large is influencing or dictating civilian decision-making.\n\nConservative Islamic clerics represent a third and final veto player, as they have become increasingly influential since the early 1990s. Various governments have informally consulted with these clerics to avoid antagonizing them. In recent years, the close collaboration between Niger and France has led to protests led by Islamic clerics. Conservative clerics have also criticized the strict anti-Corona measures, including the temporary closure of mosques, in 2020.\n\nThe constitution explicitly highlights the importance of mutual checks and balances. Like several of its predecessors, the constitution foresees a semi-presidential system that provides for a distinct separation of powers between the president and the prime minister. In contrast to the previous constitution, the current constitution strengthens the rights of the legislative vis-à-vis the executive, especially regarding the legislature’s right to approve the prime minister, while the president can propose and dismiss the prime minister. Additionally, it outlines the respective rights of the president and the prime minister in cases of cohabitation (i.e., the majority of parliament can name the prime minister).\n\nThe constitution further specifies the judiciary’s control mechanisms, allowing it to scrutinize the president and the prime minister more carefully. The Constitutional Court cannot be dissolved by the president and is the only institution with the mandate to interpret the constitution. According to data from the Comparative Constitution Project, Niger has one of the strongest judicial branches worldwide on paper.\n\nAs in previous years, the Constitutional Court did not play a significant role in checking executive power during the period under review. President Bazoum’s tight grip over the legislative and executive renders the judiciary almost irrelevant and ensures the dominance of the executive in all political decision-making processes.\n\nAs in the past, opportunities to determine whether the separation of powers works in reality have been rare to nonexistent in 2021 and 2022. Despite government harassment and intimidation, the opposition parties are still capable of holding the government accountable in parliament. The curfews and other restrictions implemented to combat the coronavirus pandemic are no longer in effect.\n\nThe Diffa region has been under a state of emergency since 2015. Several districts in the Tahoua and Tillaberi regions have also been under a (more or less permanent) state of emergency since 2017. This response to the security threat is posed by the various jihadi-Salafi groups operating in the region. It is known that state security services utilize the situation to extract resources from the local populations for their own personal gain.\n\nThe judiciary comprises the Constitutional Court, the Court of Appeal (Cour de cassation), the State Council (Conseil d’état), the Court of Auditors (Cour des comptes), and the ordinary courts. There are no reports or reliable evidence indicating that the executive tries to influence the decision-making of the national courts. In the distant past, the Constitutional Court may have had the courage to overturn executive decisions; however, these rulings were often ignored. In the period under review, the Constitutional Court did not render any major rulings.\n\nAt the national level, the Nigerien law association chooses national judges, who are subsequently confirmed by the president. In the past, the executive did not openly interfere in that process, and as a result, a certain degree of judicial independence exists. There is no reliable information on how judges at the regional level are appointed.\n\nHigh-ranking politicians are not often subject to judicial action. If and when they are subject to investigation, cases are often abandoned or delayed indefinitely. During the period under review, a few high-ranking politicians, including a cabinet member, were arrested and jailed on accusations of corruption. However, generally, if politicians are prosecuted, it is usually an indication that they have fallen out of favor with whoever is in charge of the executive. The treatment of former opposition leader Hama Amadou provides a prominent example of this.\n\nA 2022 Afrobarometer survey shows that nearly two-thirds of the population trust the courts. However, in many parts of the country, courts and lawyers are absent, primarily due to an acute shortage of judges and lawyers. According to local estimates, there are as few as approximately one hundred trained lawyers in the country. Local media reports and conversations with those involved in the judicial system indicate that corruption hampers justice at the local level. However, verifying these reports is challenging. The lack of institutional capacity and manpower poses a much larger issue. This circumstance might explain why so many people do, in fact, trust the courts.\n\nAccording to Afrobarometer, slightly over two-thirds of the population also states that reporting corruption brings the risk of retaliation. Finally, 71% of the population states that some or most magistrates are corrupt. Fighting for one’s rights in a court of law can be expensive. Therefore, the vast majority of the population does not have access to the legal system, cannot afford the legal fees, or is forced to pay bribes to judges or magistrates.\n\nSince 1993, Niger has held eight presidential and 10 legislative elections. There are no reliable data on party membership. Most – if not all – parties have low or very low levels of organizational capacity outside of the capital and urban centers in the interior of the country (e.g., Diffa, Dosso and Zinder). The last three elections have seen the rise of several new parties, which are breakaways from older and more established parties such as the PNDS and MNSD. The December 2020 elections continued this trend. The newly elected National Assembly contains three more parties than previously (19 instead of 16 parties). However, the PNDS and, to a lesser extent, the MNSD are the political parties that can be seen as national forces. Overall, however, powerful individuals – and not political parties – structure political competition.\n\nClientelist and personalistic linkages, rather than ideological cohesion, are what unite parties with their followers. A significant share of members of parliament are entrepreneurs and normally do not serve more than one parliamentary cycle. Political alliances are fickle, which makes the political environment unstable and unpredictable. The ability of the party system to produce different alliances, however, also indicates a low level of ethnic and political polarization. The authoritarian reflexes of both the Issoufou and the Bazoum administrations have increased the polarization between the government and the parliamentary and non-parliamentary opposition forces. However, the salience of neo-patrimonialism and the high degree of discretion for powerful individuals ensure that polarization does not translate into large-scale violence.\n\nVoter turnout in the 2020 general election was 69%, higher than in earlier elections, yet there is little evidence suggesting that political parties enjoy deep roots in society. All parties have regional strongholds, and cooperation between parties and civil society organizations is ad hoc. However, cooperation between parties and trade unions or other interest groups has never been institutionalized.\n\nThere have been attempts by the Nigerien government to make access to the Nigerien markets easier for domestic and international investors. The Maison de l’Entreprise facilitates the start-up of new businesses through a single-window registration process. However, overall, market competition operates under a weak institutional framework with uneven rules for market participants.\n\nAs in previous periods, the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom rates Niger’s economic freedom status as mostly unfree. The country’s investment framework is outmoded and nontransparent. Informal rules determine entry and exit barriers. Access to bank credit is difficult for both domestic and foreign investors. The informal sector is considerably larger than the formal sector and operates independently of any framework. According to data from the International Labour Organisation, the share of informal employment in total employment stood at 73.6% in 2017. The vast majority of Nigeriens do not have access to the formal employment market. The formal labor market is largely confined to the state and state employees, though in recent years job opportunities in the private sector, including banking, telecommunications and NGOs, have increased. Enforcement of the tax code is highly uneven.\n\nThe government claims that it supports the establishment of a free and dynamic market, but this is not the case. Foreign capital and domestic capital are legally equal. The Investment Code, adopted in 2014, guarantees the reception and protection of foreign direct investment, as well as tax advantages available for investment projects. The Investment Code allows tax exemptions for a certain period, and according to the location and amount of the projects, to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis with the Ministry of Commerce. The code guarantees fair treatment of investors regardless of their origin. All sectors are open to investment. Small-scale domestic investors have virtually no access to credit. International investors face other constraints, such as corruption, nepotism, the absence of enforceable rules, and a weak domestic consumer base.\n\nNiger’s membership in the CFA currency allows for stable exchange rates with the eurozone but limits economic interactions with Nigeria, an important political and economic neighbor country.\n\nThe government encourages the formation and protection of private enterprises and has repeatedly pledged to take whatever steps are necessary to encourage the development of the private sector. The government has established an Institutional Framework for Improving Business Climate Indicators office (Dispositif Institutionnel d’Amélioration et de Suivi du Climat des Affaires) within the Ministry of Commerce. Its goal is to create a framework that enables the implementation of sustainable reforms. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry houses a specialized institution called the Investment Promotion Center, which supports domestic and foreign investors in business creation, extension, and rehabilitation.\n\nThe Investment Code adopted in 2014 guarantees the reception and protection of foreign direct investment, as well as tax advantages available for investment projects. The Investment Code allows tax exemptions for a certain period, based on the location and amount of the projects, to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis with the Ministry of Commerce. The code guarantees fair treatment of investors, irrespective of their origin.\n\nThe Investment Code guarantees that no business will be subject to nationalization or expropriation, except when deemed in the public interest. The code requires the government to compensate any expropriated business with a just and equitable payment. However, the law is not applied evenly – there have been a number of expropriations of commercial and personal property, most of which were not conducted in a manner consistent with Nigerien law. In fact, it is rare for property owners to be compensated by the government after property expropriations.\n\nMost sectors of the economy – with the exception of a few state-owned enterprises – have been privatized. The state-owned oil-distribution company SONIDEP no longer has a monopoly over oil exportation; exportation authority is now equally shared between SONIDEP and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation. Likewise, although the national electricity company, NIGELEC, continues to hold a virtual monopoly on electricity distribution, steps were taken to allow third-party access to the country’s electricity grid.\n\nThe way in which the runoff of the 2020/2021 presidential elections were conducted serves to underscore Niger’s gradual erosion of democratic values, a trend that began in 2013. Both national and international civic organizations express concerns over the government’s willingness to uphold freedom of speech and assembly. Consequently, the relationship between the state and society remains a significant political concern. The new administration should halt the ongoing practice of last-minute cancellations of public demonstrations, as well as the arrests of protest leaders and participants who defy these cancellations. The government also needs to refrain from labeling government critics as sympathizers of Boko Haram. While Western governments should continue their economic and military support for Niger, they should also prioritize scrutinizing the government’s interactions with its critics.\n\nNiger boasts one of the world’s fastest-growing populations, resulting in one of the youngest populations on the African continent. Paradoxically, youth are under-represented in both parliament and leadership positions within relevant political parties. This situation has the potential to alienate young people from political engagement. To rectify this, both the government and Western donors should work toward greater inclusivity for this dominant demographic group, as well as for women and minority groups.\n\nDespite anticipated increases in oil exports over the next few years, there’s little indication of imminent economic improvement in Niger. Environmental challenges are poised to intensify during this period. The country remains reliant on rainfall and agricultural production, showing little inclination toward economic diversification. While acknowledging some progress in extreme poverty reduction and basic education, the overall economic outlook is grim and concerning.\n\nCorruption and inefficiencies within the public sector represent significant economic hurdles for Niger. The influx of donor aid has yet to yield substantial improvements for the majority of the population. On one hand, the small state bureaucracy struggles to effectively manage the substantial inflow of external funds. On the other hand, a significant portion of these funds ends up in the hands of a powerful few who redirect these resources for personal or political gain. Survey data indicates that most Nigeriens believe corruption has markedly increased over the past two years. The presidency and state bureaucracy are predominantly held responsible for this rise in corruption. Moreover, the country now faces the looming prospect of another debt crisis, as public debt has escalated to an unsustainable level.\n\nOngoing attacks by jihadi-Salafi organizations on Nigerien territory necessitate close military coordination among the government, local governments in the region (G5 Sahel and ECOWAS), and international partners such as France, the EU, and the United States. While Niger has shown more adeptness in addressing jihadi activities compared to Mali, Burkina Faso, or Nigeria, the past two years have seen a slight decline in terrorist attacks. Nonetheless, jihadi-Salafi groups still retain the capacity to pose a significant security threat to the country."
