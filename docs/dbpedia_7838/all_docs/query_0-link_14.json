        "text": "How far will tensions escalate between Niger, where a junta seized power on Wednesday, July 26, and the countries of the region, led by Nigeria, which are threatening Niamey with military intervention to reinstate the elected president Mohamed Bazoum? As the expiry date of a regional ultimatum set for August 6 approaches, the situation is deteriorating. On July 31, countries also led by coup leaders took up the cause of the Nigerien junta.\n\nSpokespeople from Burkina Faso and Mali, whose governments are ruled by military juntas, warned that \"any military intervention against Niger would be tantamount to a declaration of war against Burkina Faso and Mali.\" Mali's Colonel Assimi Goïta and Burkina Faso's Captain Ibrahim Traoré expressed \"their solidarity\" with the \"people of Niger,\" and denounced \"the persistence of these regional organizations in imposing sanctions [...] jeopardizing the spirit of pan-Africanism\" on Monday, July 31. They were followed by Guinea's Mamadi Doumbouya, who spoke in similar terms.\n\nThere are two camps: the \"putschists\" versus the \"democrats.\" The former’s response was commensurate with the severity of the latter’s. On July 30, eleven countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) threatened \"recourse to force\" at the end of an extraordinary summit held in Abuja, the Nigerian capital. Since then, the idea of a ground military intervention, backed by air support and with a strong Nigerian contingent (the two countries are neighbors), has become less hypothetical. The head of the Nigerian armed forces, General Christopher Musa, declared on Monday that \"we are ready.\"\n\nIs this a form of psychological pressure? France, which supports the ECOWAS initiative to restore legitimate power in Niger, announced on Tuesday morning that, \"in light of the deteriorating security situation in Niger, and taking advantage of the relative calm in Niamey,\" an evacuation operation for its nationals by air was due to begin \"as of today.\"\n\nThis is the first time since the start of the series of coups in the region − two in Mali, two in Burkina Faso and one in Guinea since 2020 − that ECOWAS has been so severe. The regional group has given General Abdourahamane Tiani and his men seven days to reinstate the elected president of Niger.\n\nThese countries imposed an economic blockade on Niger and the \"immediate\" suspension of \"all commercial and financial transactions\" with the country, including the freezing of assets and a travel ban being placed on putschist officers. Upon expiration of the ultimatum, they warned that \"all necessary measures\" would be taken, which could \"include the use of force.\" \"Firmness, firmness, and more firmness, this demonic spiral must be stopped!\" affirmed a West African minister."
