        "text": "The history of colonization has had a big impact on African languages, but many local languages are still thriving. Africa is rich in different languages, showing its diverse cultures and complex history.\n\nRegardless, English is the third most spoken native language on the list. In many homes and schools in Africa, the first language is English, Businessday reported “The major challenge facing the Nigerian indigenous languages at the moment is not the official status of the English language in the country but the attitude of many Nigerians toward these indigenous languages”.\n\nExcept for many in the North, the major challenge facing indigenous languages in Nigeria is not merely the official status of English but rather the prevailing attitudes of many Nigerians toward their native languages. This raises questions about the impact of language choices in elite Western and Eastern homes, where languages like Yoruba and Igbo may not be as commonly spoken as one might expect.\n\nAccording to WorldData, here are the 10 most spoken native languages in Africa in 2023\n\nArabic\n\nArabic stands as the most widely spoken native language in Africa, with over 213.7 million speakers. Its prominence is largely attributed to its historical influence, as it was introduced through the spread of Islam across the continent. Arabic is not only the language of the Quran but also serves as a lingua franca in many North African countries like Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Sudan, and Mauritania.\n\nHausa\n\nHausa is a Chadic language spoken predominantly in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria, Niger, and parts of Chad. With 66.4 million speakers, Hausa plays a crucial role in trade, administration, and cultural exchange in the region.
