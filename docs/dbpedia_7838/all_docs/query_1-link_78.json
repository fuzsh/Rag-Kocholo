        "text": "The African continent is the second largest on earth, covering about 30 million square kilometres. About 1.2 billion people live in Africa and although about 2,000 indigenous languages exist, English, French or Arabic are spoken officially in many places. Africa's turbulent history with its colonisation is the reason for the use of European languages on official occasions. Nevertheless, people are now trying to cultivate their own language roots again, and in many regions they speak more than one language. The most widely spoken languages in Africa are:\n\n1st place: Swahili\n\nThe Bantu language Swahili is spoken by about 150 million people in Central and Southern Africa in the Great Lakes region. The origin of the word Swahili comes from Arabic and means coast. For the inhabitants along the coast from Somalia to Mozambique, Swahili is the mother tongue.\n\n2nd place: Arabic\n\nMore than 100 million Africans speak Arabic, illustrating the external influences that have shaped life on the continent for many centuries. In Ethiopia, Niger, Senegal, and also in Tanzania, Arabic is spoken mainly on official occasions.\n\n3rd place: French\n\nThe French language came to the African continent with colonisation and now about 90 million people speak French in 26 countries. The language is mostly spoken in Mauritius, Côte d'Ivoire, and Gabon.\n\n4th place: Hausa\n\nHausa, an Afro-African language, is taught in Nigeria and Niger alongside their respective official languages. About 80 million Africans speak Hausa and in France, in Issoudun, there is a radio station broadcasting in Hausa. Hausa is playing a growing role in West African regions, especially in trade and business, and the language is also taught at international universities.\n\n5th place: Yoruba and Oromo\n\n30 million people in Africa speak Yoruba. It is spoken in everyday life especially in Nigeria, Togo and Benin, but also in Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Just as many people in Africa speak Oromo. Oromo is especially widespread in Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Somalia.\n\nFrequently asked questions and answers about African languages"
