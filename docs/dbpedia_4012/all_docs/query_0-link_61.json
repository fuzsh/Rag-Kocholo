        "text": "CHAPEL HILL ó John Bunting's cabin in the woods of Maine was held up by rocks and a stump ó but, according to the North Carolina football coach, not very well.\n\nThe cabin, in the family since the 1940s, was worth saving. So with a bit of work and a new foundation, the structure's future is secure.\n\nBunting has returned from the cool Northeast nights to face North Carolina's heat and humidity, and his first Division I-A camp in less than two weeks. He's still thinking about a foundation and the future ó only this time with the Tar Heels.\n\n\"It's time to go to work,\" Bunting said. \"I'm recharged, I'm refreshed.\"\n\nBunting, a former NFL linebacker with the Philadelphia Eagles and longtime pro assistant, took over in December for Carl Torbush, who was fired following a lackluster 17-18 record in three seasons.\n\nBunting has worked mostly on non-football issues the last few weeks, trying to organize things before his freshmen report July 30.\n\n\"It's important to me to get the players on the right schedule and I've been agonizing with this,\" he said. \"I've talked with other coaches about how they've set their schedules up. What's best for the players to learn and be fresh to play in the opening game?\n\nBunting, a former assistant with the Kansas City Chiefs, St. Louis Rams and New Orleans Saints, has been used to an NFL routine in July, in which 80 about players report to camp.\n\nIn the first week of August, he'll be dealing with 105 in Chapel Hill. He said he plans several night practices to beat the heat and get all the work in that's needed prior to the season opener against national champion Oklahoma Aug. 25.\n\nBunting will also spend the next month building the Tar Heels up emotionally.\n\n, then tearing them down on the field with physical workouts aimed at making the team tougher in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat's where the Tar Heels lost consecutive home games to Georgia Tech, N.C. State and Clemson in the middle of last season, and how Torbush lost his job.\n\n\"I want to impact the character of this football team and if you can't hack it then you've got to pack, you've got to go,\" Bunting said.\n\n\"I think the team looks at me as being honest, as being hard-nosed when it comes to the game of football and the game of life. You've got to be tough.\"\n\nBunting has already made some tough decisions. He kicked wide receiver Jamal Jones ó the fastest player on the team ó off the squad. And he plans to meet with quarterback Ronald Curry to chat about increasing his leadership skills.\n\n\"You've got to set some standards and you've got to draw that line in the sand,\" Bunting said, refusing to elaborate on why Jones was let go. \"I'm not going to back off on certain issues and the way we deal with behavior on the field and off the field. I am big on that. I won't have a bad kid on this team. It's just not worth it to me.\"\n\nCurry came to North Carolina as the nation's No. 1 high school recruit, but while former Virginia prep rival Michael Vick was the top pick in this past NFL draft, Curry enters his senior season with just 20 touchdown passes and 29 interceptions.\n\n\"I want Ronald to demonstrate a little more leadership,\" Bunting said. \"He doesn't have to yell at a guy or scream at a guy, but it's a matter of being real upbeat in the huddle, being upbeat in the locker room, being upbeat in meetings.\n\n\"If he wants to play at the next level he needs to do that. Hey, you've got to be ready to go. This is not a laid-back game ó at any position.\"\n\nNo backup QB has impressed Bunting so far, but he is drawing up running plays for Curry and will use all of his offensive skills despite the risk of injury.\n\n\"I've got to let him go,\" Bunting said. \"Ronald wouldn't want anything different.\"\n\nBunting isn't cringing at an opening schedule that includes road games at Oklahoma, Maryland and Texas.\n\n\"I will be real disappointed if I can't keep this team upbeat through the difficult schedule,\" he said. \"I'm not concerned with what other people say about what we're doing. We asked for that extra game (with Oklahoma) to help us learn how to compete at the highest level.\"\n\nBunting said he would much rather play one of the best teams in the country than a lesser opponent such as Furman, a I-AA team that routed the Tar Heels at home two seasons ago. It was a game that most North Carolina supporters wouldn't let Torbush ever forget.\n\n\"I don't like playing a I-AA team. That I-AA team is going to get fired up for you and you might not be fired up for them and then all of the sudden you're in a dog fight,\" Bunting said. \"That is a bad feeling on the sideline. I would much rather play teams that are recognized as being powerhouses because that's where we want to be.\""
