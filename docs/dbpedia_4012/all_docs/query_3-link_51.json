        "text": "Super Bowl Sunday is upon us, which means the 2017 NFL draft is right around the corner. The Eagles will either hold the No. 14 or 15 overall pick (the pick will be decided via coin flip) thanks to their trade with the Minnesota Vikings for quarterback Sam Bradford. Here is Paul Hudrick's mock draft 1.0 to get you ready for the 2017 NFL draft, which takes place April 27-29 in Philadelphia.\n\n*Denotes junior\n\n** Denotes redshirt sophomore\n\n1. Cleveland Browns - *DE Myles Garrett, Texas A&M, 6-5/270\n\nGarrett is going to be a disruptive player in the NFL for a long time. He should fit just fine in Gregg Williams' 4-3 scheme.\n\n2. San Francisco 49ers - DE Jonathan Allen, Alabama, 6-3/291\n\nIf Allen had come out as a junior last season - like Garrett this year - he likely would've been picked in the teens. Allen gives the 49ers another young, talented piece in their front seven. New GM John Lynch will opt for defense and look to get new head coach Kyle Shanahan a veteran quarterback.\n\n3. Chicago Bears - *QB Mitch Trubisky, North Carolina, 6-3/220\n\nTrubisky has the best arm talent of any quarterback in the draft. Then again, the arm talent of the current Bears' quarterback has never been questioned. Trubisky's tools will be too much for the Bears to pass up.\n\n4. Jacksonville Jaguars - *RB Leonard Fournette, LSU, 6-1/235\n\nFournette has the best strength and speed combo I've seen since Adrian Peterson. He battled a nagging ankle sprain all season, but when he did play, he was scary. He'll add a dynamic playmaker and a physical aspect to the Jaguars' offense.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n\nComplete coverage of the Philadelphia Eagles and their NFL rivals from NBC Sports Philadelphia.\n\n5. Tennessee Titans - **CB Marshon Lattimore, Ohio State, 6-1/192\n\nLattimore has elite size and athleticism. Jason McCourty has one year left on his deal and there's not a ton of depth at that position. Lattimore has the potential to become a No. 1 corner.\n\n6. New York Jets - *S Jamal Adams, LSU, 6-1/213\n\nCalvin Pryor has struggled. So has the entire Jets' secondary. Enter Jamal Adams, a special safety with the ability to disrupt against the run and the pass. The best part of his game is his calmness. He dissects plays and plays under control.\n\n7. Los Angeles Chargers - **S Malik Hooker, Ohio State, 6-2/205\n\nHooker is an elite centerfielder with crazy range and ball skills. He's been compared to future HOF safety Ed Reed. He adds to a Chargers defense that could be a decent unit if healthy.\n\n8. Carolina Panthers - *DE Derek Barnett, Tennessee, 6-3/265\n\nAfter Garrett, Barnett is probably the best pure pass rusher in this draft. The Panthers desperately need a strong outside rusher to complement their depth at tackle and linebacker.\n\n9. Cincinnati Bengals - LB Reuben Foster, Alabama, 6-1/228\n\nA pick that just makes a ton of sense. Foster has been (fairly) compared to the Panthers' Luke Kuechly. He forms a scary tandem with Vontaze Burfict playing on the weakside.\n\n10. Buffalo Bills - *QB DeShone Kizer, Notre Dame, 6-4/230\n\nThe Tyrod Taylor situation was a mess. So was Rex Ryan's firing. Welcome to Buffalo, DeShone! From watching the three likely first-round quarterbacks, Kizer is the one I actually like the most. I see a lot of Steve McNair in him.\n\n11. New Orleans Saints - *DL Solomon Thomas, Stanford, 6-3/273\n\nYou could really project any defensive player to the Saints here. Thomas teams up with last year's first-round pick, Sheldon Rankins, and veteran Cameron Jordan. That has the makings of a solid unit.\n\n12. Cleveland Browns - *QB Deshaun Watson, Clemson, 6-3/215\n\nThis would work out pretty well for Cleveland. They'd get arguably the best player in the draft and the best quarterback in college football last season. Watson's intangibles are off the charts. His decision making waned at times during the year, but his National Championship performance was one for the ages.\n\n13. Arizona Cardinals - *WR Mike Williams, Clemson, 6-3/225\n\nSorry, Eagles fans, but I just don't see a way Williams gets to No. 14 or 15. He could easily go in the top 10. Williams is a perfect fit for Arizona. He can learn under future HOFer Larry Fitzgerald.\n\n14/15. Indianapolis Colts - DE/OLB Tim Williams, Alabama, 6-4/252\n\nLike the Saints, you could throw any defensive player here and it would be a solid pick. Williams isn't just a pass rusher, either. He's instinctive and disruptive in the run game as well. He's a perfect replacement for the retiring Robert Mathis.\n\n14/15. Philadelphia Eagles - *CB Sidney Jones, Washington, 6-0/181\n\nJones isn't the sexiest name available, but he's been an outstanding football player for Washington. After starting 25 of 26 games and racking up six interceptions in his freshman and sophomore seasons, teams stayed away from Jones in 2016.\n\nBefore the Peach Bowl, Alabama head coach Nick Saban compared Washington's secondary to the Seattle Seahawks' Legion of Boom. If that's the case, Jones was the Huskies' Richard Sherman. Jones lined up on the left and locked down that side of the field. According to PFF, Jones only saw 48 targets, 199th in the nation. Opposing quarterbacks had a rating of 42.2 when targeting him.\n\nHe'd fit in Jim Schwartz's scheme. He excels in both man and zone coverage and plays the game with a ton of confidence. He's fluid in his movements and may be the most technically sound corner in this draft. He's got long arms and is extremely physical at the line of scrimmage. Jones can start right away and make an impact in the Eagles' secondary.\n\nSure, receiver is a huge need as well. At this point, Western Michigan's Corey Davis would be the best on the board. As good as Davis is (I profiled him relentlessly this season), a player like Jones, with the potential to become a shutdown corner, is more valuable. Florida's Teez Tabor will be brought up in this range as well. He's another very good prospect, but Jones is a more consistent player and the one the Eagles should take.\n\n16. Baltimore Ravens - WR Corey Davis, Western Michigan, 6-3/213\n\nIf the Eagles take Davis, I wouldn't be surprised. Davis is a precise route runner who is physical and fast. He's been my draft crush all year and worthy of top-10 consideration. A minor ankle procedure will cause him to miss pre-draft workouts, but it shouldn't affect his draft status.\n\n17. Washington Redskins - *WR John Ross, Washington, 5-11/190\n\nThe Redskins will likely lose DeSean Jackson and possibly Pierre Garcon this offseason. If they're looking for replacements with similar skills, they could take the lightning fast Ross to pair with last year's first-round pick Josh Doctson.\n\n18. Tennessee Titans - *CB Teez Tabor, Florida, 6-0/201\n\nTabor has impressed with his ball skills and his swagger, something people have noted as a trait Schwartz will appreciate. I wouldn't fault the Eagles for taking Tabor instead of Jones. I just see Jones as the more reliable of the two. Tabor and Lattimore could be a formidable duo for the Titans.\n\n19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers - *RB Dalvin Cook, Florida State, 5-11/213\n\nWith Doug Martin's future uncertain, Cook is a legitimate playmaker and a three-down back. Martin finished second in the league in rushing in 2015 in Dirk Koetter's offense. Cook should be able to have similar success.\n\n20. Denver Broncos - *OT Cam Robinson, Alabama, 6-6/310\n\nThe Broncos need to establish themselves as a run-first offense and protect whoever is under center. Robinson has been a hotly debated prospect, but I still consider him the No. 1 offensive lineman on the board.\n\n21. Detroit Lions - **CB Marlon Humphrey, Alabama, 6-1/196\n\nBefore struggling in the College Football Playoff, many experts considered Humphrey the best corner in the draft. He has world-class speed. He's also got great size and is a physical player.\n\n22. Miami Dolphins - TE O.J. Howard, Alabama, 6-6/251\n\nThe run on Alabama players continues. Jarvis Landry is a model of consistency while Devante Parker had a decent sophomore campaign. The Dolphins also saw running back Jay Ajayi emerge as a bell cow back. Howard gives Ryan Tannehill a serious threat at tight end as head coach Adam Gase continues to get more pieces for his offense.\n\n23. New York Giants - *LB Zach Cunningham, Vanderbilt, 6-4/230\n\nFor as strong as the Giants' defense was, they were still missing a playmaking linebacker. Cunningham fits that bill. He's likely more of a 4-3 outside linebacker at the next level, but spent his time on the inside at Vandy. With his athleticism, he never has to come off the field.\n\n24. Oakland Raiders - *TE David Njoku, Miami, 6-4/245\n\nDerek Carr has two outside threats in Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree and the team would be wise to bring back free-agent running back Latavius Murray. In Njoku, Carr gets a dynamic tight end who can expose the middle of the defense and stretch the field.\n\n25. Houston Texans - *OT, Ryan Ramczyk, Wisconsin, 6-6/314\n\nCould the Texans use this pick in an attempt to get a quarterback? After watching Brock Osweiler this year, they probably should. But Ramczyk could fill a similar hole as Lane Johnson did for the Eagles. He could start his career at right tackle before taking over on the left for a former All-Pro in Duane Brown.\n\n26. Seattle Seahawks - *OT Garett Bolles, Utah, 6-5/300\n\nThe Seahawks just miss out on Ramczyk but get a decent consolation prize in Bolles. While Ramczyk may fit better in the run game, Bolles is very long and athletic. He needs to add some strength, but Bolles has potential.\n\n27. Kansas City Chiefs - *RB Christian McCaffrey, Stanford, 6-0/200\n\nJamaal Charles has likely played his last game with the Chiefs and perhaps his last game ever. Spencer Ware had a good season, but McCaffrey offers more. Give McCaffrey Charcandrick West's touches, and Ware and McCaffrey could form a nice one-two punch in Andy Reid's offense.\n\n28. Dallas Cowboys - DE Taco Charlton, Michigan, 6-6/272\n\nCharlton is a perfect fit for Rod Marinelli and the Cowboys. Dallas hasn't had a player register double-digit sacks since 2013. Charlton may not reach that mark in 2017, but certainly has the potential to do it in the future.\n\n29. Green Bay Packers - DE Takkarist McKinley, UCLA, 6-2/265\n\nBoth Charlton and McKinley could end up going earlier. This a great draft for edge rushers, especially in the first round. What stands out most about McKinley is his length. His hands almost touch the ground in a two-point stance. With Julius Peppers and Nick Perry set to hit free agency, McKinley may be the best player available and fit a need.\n\n30. Pittsburgh Steelers - *DE Charles Harris, Missouri, 6-3/260\n\nHarris played primarily with his hand in the dirt, but I thought some of his better pass rushes came out of a two-point stance. James Harrison isn't immortal (I don't think), so the Steelers need to groom someone on the other side of the promising Bud Dupree. The disappointing Jarvis Jones is also a free agent.\n\n31. Atlanta Falcons - *S Jabrill Peppers, Michigan, 6-1/205\n\nPeppers is a weird prospect because nobody is quite sure where he fits and he only had one career interception. There's clearly talent there, but it's tough to define him as either a safety or linebacker (or a running back?). I bet on Dan Quinn to find a use for Peppers as he continues to build his defense around dynamic athletes."
