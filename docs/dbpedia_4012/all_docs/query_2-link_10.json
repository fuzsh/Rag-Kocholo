        "text": "On Sunday, Sept. 7, the Philadelphia Eagles will begin the 2008 season. 53 players will take the field for the Eagles, and several questions remain as to which players will make up the 53-man roster.\n\nCurrently, the roster stands at 80 players after last week’s cuts. Looking at the positions below, and current roster numbers, some of the cuts could be tricky.\n\nQuarterbacks (Three): Donovan McNabb, Kevin Kolb, A.J. Feeley\n\n- The Eagles will carry three quarterbacks into the season.\n\nRunning backs (Five): Brian Westbrook, Lorenzo Booker, Correll Buckhalter, Tony Hunt, Ryan Moats\n\n- The Eagles will carry four running backs into the season. The previous struggles of Moats will make him the odd man out.\n\nFullbacks (Three): Jason Davis, Luke Lawton, Jed Collins\n\n- The Eagles will carry one fullback into the season. Jason Davis’s experience in the system makes him the leading candidate.\n\nWide receivers (10): Reggie Brown, Kevin Curtis, Jason Avant, Hank Baskett, Greg Lewis, Bam Childress, Frantz Hardy, DeSean Jackson, Jamal Jones, Shaheer McBride\n\n- The Eagles will carry six receivers into the season. Brown, Curtis, Avant, Baskett, Lewis, and Jackson should make the cut.\n\nTight ends (Five): L.J. Smith, Brent Celek, Matt Schobel, Michael Gasperson, Kris Wilson\n\n- The Eagles will carry three tight ends into the season. Smith, Celek, and Schobel make the cut. Wilson’s inability to consistently catch passes will be his downfall.\n\nOffensive tackles (Five): Tra Thomas, Jon Runyan, Winston Justice, Franklin Dunbar, King Dunlap\n\n- The Eagles will carry three tackles into the season. Dunbar and Dunlap's best opportunity will be spots on the practice squad. Having Justice learn and practice the guard position gives him the nod.\n\nGuards (Seven): Shawn Andrews, Todd Herremans, Max Jean-Gilles, Scott Young, Mike Gibson, Mike McGlynn, Stefan Rodgers\n\n- The Eagles will carry four guards into the season. Andrews, Herremans, Jean-Gilles, and McGlynn make the cut. McGlynn’s versatility at the tackle position gives him the nod.\n\nCenters (Two): Jamal Jackson, Nick Cole\n\n- The Eagles will carry two centers into the season. Cole is a dependable backup behind Jackson.\n\nDefensive ends (Seven): Trent Cole, Darren Howard, Victor Abiamiri, Chris Clemons, Jerome McDougle, Juqua Parker, Bryan Smith\n\n- The Eagles will carry five defensive ends into the season. Cole, Howard, Abiamiri, Clemons, and Parker are your pass-rushing threats. Howard’s versatility in playing the tackle position allows him to stick around. A year on the practice squad will allow Smith to bulk up and learn the DE and LB positions.\n\nDefensive tackles (Six): Brodrick Bunkley, Mike Patterson, Montae Reagor, Dan Klecko, Trevor Laws, Kimo von Oelhoffen\n\n- The Eagles will carry five defensive tackles into the season. Klecko is too undersized to contribute at the tackle position.\n\nLinebackers (Nine): Chris Gocong, Omar Gaither, Stewart Bradley, Akeem Jordan, Justin Roland, Andy Studebaker, Rocky Boiman, Joe Mays, Pogo Togafu\n\n- The Eagles will carry five linebackers into the season. Cocong, Gaither, Bradley, Jordan, and Boiman make the cut.\n\nCornerbacks (Eight): Sheldon Brown, Asante Samuel, Lito Sheppard, Joselio Hanson, Nick Graham, Kyle Arrington, Therrian Fontenot, Jack Ikegwuono\n\n- The Eagles will carry five cornerbacks into the season. Arrington and Fontenot will be searching for work, while Ikegwuono will spend the season on injured reserve.\n\nSafeties (Six): Brian Dawkins, Sean Considine, Quintin Mikell, Quintin Demps, Marcus Paschal, J.R. Reed\n\n- The Eagles will carry four safeties into the season. Dawkins, Mikell, Demps, and Reed make the cut. Considine’s injury history will make him the final roster cut.\n\nSpecialists (Four): David Akers, Sav Rocca, Richmond McGee, Jon Dorenbos\n\n- The Eagles will carry three specialists into the season. The easiest roster decisions for the Eagles to make. McGee will hope to catch on with another team"
