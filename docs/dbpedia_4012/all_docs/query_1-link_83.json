Hope to see that happen, would be cool. But maybe Gore’s time is done considering he’s currently unsigned. Regardless, we’ll look back on his Eagles career fondly.\n\nYet another year where the AFC East leads all divisions in former Eagles.\n\nThe Football Team (!), Browns, and 49ers are tied for first when it comes to having the most former Eagles.\n\nNot surprising to see former Eagles continue to land with the Jets (Joe Douglas) and Browns (Andrew Berry).\n\nThe Bucs, Vikings, and Steelers are the only three teams without a former Eagle.\n\nDerek Carrier, a 2012 undrafted rookie free agent signing, is still hanging around the NFL. Totally justifying my irrational training camp crush on him back in 2013. Also cool to see Damion Square still hanging on.\n\nIf the Eagles could reacquire one former Eagles player that’s currently under contract, who would you pick? Maybe you still believe in Wentz but that’s an easy no for me. Some seem interested in bringing Hicks back via an Ertz trade. I used to love Hicks but I think he’s kinda cooked; he hasn’t been good in coverage. If you’re looking to fill the biggest need, plugging Ronald Darby in at CB2 could help. He played well for Washington last season. Some people would probably say Sidney Jones, even though he wasn’t nearly as good as he was made out to be in Jacksonville (103.2 passer rating when targeted). Jordan Poyer might be the best bet if we’re talking about long-term value? That’s where my mind is at, not just thinking about 2021. Chandon Sullivan would be worth bringing back if you’re set on a corner. Or L.J. Fort if you really want a linebacker, though he turns 32 this season.\n\nRuling out the big names, who’s one lesser-known player you’d like to have back? I’d take Daeshon Hall. I still believe!\n\nMost obscure names this year include: Jordan Franks, Alex Brown, Devin Ross.\n\nAs you can see, I added the CFL to my former Eagles tracker this year. If you’re looking for a CFL team, you might wanna go with the Stampeders or Blue Bombers.\n\nNext Up In NFL"
