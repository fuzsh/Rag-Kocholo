        "text": "2016 second-round pick Deion Jones used to be one of the game’s better linebackers, but the eight-year veteran is now a cut candidate. After spending the 2023 season in a rotational role with the Carolina Panthers, Jones signed a cheap contract with the Buffalo Bills to provide cost-effective depth for the AFC contender. Unfortunately, one report indicates he may not live up to that promise and could miss the Week 1 roster altogether.\n\nAccording to Ryan O’Halloran of the Buffalo News, Deion Jones does not have a secured roster spot and the Bills could cut him if he doesn’t impress in training camp. While injuries decimated the unit last year, Buffalo currently has a talented group of playmakers. Matt Milano and Terrel Bernard are set to start with former third-round pick Dorian Williams as the top depth option. This leaves Jones battling with Nicholas Morrow, Edefuan Ulofoshio, and Baylor Spector, and there’s no guarantee he wins that fight.\n\nDeion Jones isn’t the player he used to be, but the one-time Pro Bowler should find work if the Bills cut him. According to Pro Football Focus, Jones finished the 2023 season with a solid 76.7 coverage grade and a 72.8 pass rush grade. While his subpar play against the run will prevent him from being a three-down player, he’d be an ideal fit for teams like the Baltimore Ravens or Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nBills Could Cut Deion Jones – Ravens, Chargers Could Be Interested\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens lost several key players in free agency, including former first-round pick Patrick Queen. After a bumpy start to his career, the LSU product thrived as the second fiddle to superstar linebacker Roquan Smith. Now that Queen is in Pittsburgh, someone must step up opposite Smith, and Deion Jones could be the perfect choice for the job if the Bills cut him.\n\nCurrently armed with just $5.9 million in salary cap space, Baltimore lacks the financial resources to go after big-name players, especially if the Ravens sign Jamal Adams or another safety. Roquan Smith is more than capable of being the top linebacker on the depth chart, which should allow Jones to play a smaller role more suited to his strengths. Seeing as the Ravens share a division with the Cincinnati Bengals and their high-flying passing attack, Baltimore could use a low-risk depth option like Deion Jones to see the field on passing downs.\n\nBuilding Jim Harbaugh’s Defense\n\nJim Harbaugh is an old-school coach who believes in winning games with defense and a strong running game. The former Michigan head coach has his work cut out for him, as the Chargers defense was one of the worst in the league last year. While head coach Brandon Staley’s poor scheme certainly didn’t help matters, Harbaugh must find more talent, and Deion Jones could be a perfect fit if the Bills cut him.\n\nHarbaugh loves linebackers, and he’ll need to improve the coverage unit if he wants this team to compete in a crowded AFC. The Kansas City Chiefs, Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, and Baltimore Ravens should all have high-flying passing attacks and someone like Jones could see the field a decent amount in those high-stakes matchups.\n\nMain Photo: Corey Perrine – USA Today Sports"
