        "text": "Jeffrey Phelps/Associated Press\n\nGreen Bay Packers running back Jamaal Williams was stretchered off the field during Thursday night's game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWilliams, 24, went down after being tackled by multiple Philadelphia defenders on Green Bay's first offensive play, and Eagles defensive end Derek Barnett was flagged for unnecessary roughness. Williams was able to give a thumbs up as he was taken off the field.\n\nThe team later announced he was being evaluated for head and neck injuries, noting he had feeling and movement in his extremities.\n\nWith Williams out, Jones should continue to serve as the primary back in Green Bay. He has rushed for 174 yards and three touchdowns through the first three weeks, also adding six receptions for 38 yards.\n\nEven with Williams available, Jones had been among the most used running backs in the league early on this season:\n\nJones will be leaned upon even more heavily for the remainder of the contest especially, as the only other running back on the roster—rookie Dexter Williams—is inactive.\n\nJones has been bothered by a shoulder injury recently, but as long as he is healthy enough to play, he will handle the vast majority of the workload in the backfield for as long as Williams is out. After all, it was just Week 2 that he ran for 116 yards and one score, proving he can flourish in first-year coach Matt LaFleur's system.\n\nFor fantasy owners in PPR leagues, Jones has yet to establish himself as a consistent pass-catcher. Though he grabbed the starting job by rushing for 728 yards on 5.1 yards per carry last season, he hauled in just 26 passes. He entered Thursday night averaging just 1.5 catches per game for his career.\n\nOn the other hand, Dexter Williams managed just 22 receptions during his four-year career at Notre Dame. In other words, the Packers will be looking for one of their running backs to emerge as a pass-catcher out of the backfield in Jamaal Williams' absence.\n\nWith Green Bay relying on two-time MVP Aaron Rodgers' arm, Packers running backs may not put up points as consistently as others at the position. However, given Jones' status atop the depth chart, he figures to be a quality RB2 option moving forward.\n\nNeed more help with your fantasy football lineup?
