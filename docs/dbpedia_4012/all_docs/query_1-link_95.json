        "text": "It was a frantic Friday for the Chicago Bears, who had to pivot quickly on the defensive line. After defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi failed his physical, they quickly signed former Los Angeles Chargers defensive tackle Justin Jones to a two-year deal.\n\nWhile the Ogunjobi deal wasn’t a good look for Poles, his swift reaction to choose to move on from him and target Jones was a solid response. It’s a good thing, too, considering Jones almost signed with another team.\n\nJones told Chicago reporters on Friday that he was close to signing with the Indianapolis Colts. But after talking to Bears head coach and former Colts defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, he signed with Chicago instead.\n\nJones is coming off an impressive season with the Chargers, where he had career highs in tackles (37), sacks (3.0) and QB hits (5). He added five tackles for loss, two fumble recoveries and one pass breakup in 11 games.\n\nJones will serve the three-technique role in Eberflus’ defense, where his impressive run-stopping abilities will certainly be appreciated. Given Jones played under new Colts defensive coordinator Gus Bradley with the Chargers from 2018-20, it’s a good fit for Jones.\n\nList\n\nGrading the Bears' signing of DT Justin Jones\n\nView 1 items\n\nList\n\nUpdated look at Bears defensive line depth after recent free agency moves"
