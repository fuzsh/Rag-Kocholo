        "text": "PHILADEPHIA – Ryan Moats knew he was on the way out when the Eagles raved about their draft day trade for running back Lorenzo Booker.\n\nThe Eagles confirmed it Friday.\n\nMoats topped the eight-man list of players released by the Eagles, who must get rid of 14 more players before 6 p.m. today.\n\nThe group includes cornerback Nick Graham, who played in 15 games last season, linebacker Pago Togafau, who appeared in seven games and offensive lineman Stefan Rodgers, who spent the year on injured reserve.\n\nThe Eagles reached an injury settlement with Moats, a third-round pick out of Louisiana Tech in 2005, who injured his ankle late in the third preseason game against the New England Patriots.\n\nThe club also appeared on the verge of announcing an injury settlement with veteran defensive tackle Montae Reagor (knee), but it hasn’t been announced. Unless Reagor strikes a deal elsewhere, don’t be surprised if he resurfaces with Eagles. There are just four defensive tackles on the roster including Dan Klecko, who has a wrist contusion.\n\nThe 5-8, 210-pound Moats rushed for three touchdowns and 278 yards in seven games as a rookie, including a 114-yard effort against the St. Louis Rams. But he appeared in just eight games the following season while Westbrook produced the first of back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons.\n\nThe Eagles drafted Moats partly because of their health concerns for Westbrook. That also was an age in which Westbrook was upset with his contract and wound up holding out of training camp.\n\nMoats proved to be one-dimensional. Too small to pick up blitzes and not nearly as fluid a receiver as the other backs, he was in the game for one reason – to run the ball. And he may have lost a step coming back from the fractured fibula sustained in the 2007 preseason.\n\nThe Eagles also released wide receivers Bam Childress and Jamal Jones, cornerback Therrian Fontenot, and safety Marcus Paschal.\n\nThe 67-man roster must be reduced 53 today.\n\nChildress caught four passes for 37 yards and a touchdown in the Eagles preseason finale, a 27-20 loss to the New York Jets at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nFontenot had an interception nullified by illegal contact by rookie Quintin Demps, who ironically will make the team.\n\n“It’s still on tape,” Fontenot said. “It was funny because the referee asked me who picked it off. He said that was nice. It’s not frustrating at all. It’s football. Things happen. My boy was being aggressive. He’s being real aggressive, and they hit him with a ticky-tacky call. It’s no big deal.”\n\nWith the next wave of cuts just hours away, it will be an anxious weekend for some players.\n\n“You kind of know the situation when you’re in it,” said rookie wide receiver Shaheer McBride, the Chester High and Delaware State product on the bubble. “I knew how this would go, that it would pretty much be a waiting game at the end. Pretty much you just have to go about it like it’s a regular day and just prepare as if you’ve made the team until they tell you otherwise.”\n\nTony Hunt, the tailback switched to fullback, isn’t certain which position gives him the best chance of sticking with the Eagles. The same could be said of the Eagles, who played the 2006 third round pick at both positions against the Jets.\n\n“I’ll be fine tomorrow and the day after,” Hunt said. “There’s nothing I can do about it. If I sit at home and worry about it, it’s not going to change anything. I’m going to hang out with family a little bit.”"
