        "text": "This week has brought back a flood of memories for me about the New Orleans Saints.\n\nIn my 22 years in this business, I have never been requested to appear on local and national radio shows to talk about the Saints as I have this past week. And it has been great.\n\nI know this has been said already but I must say it again, tonight’s NFC divisional playoff game against the Philadelphia Eagles is the biggest game in Saints history.\n\nYes, the Saints have played in the second round of the playoffs before, but that game wasn’t at home and the table has never been more set for them to make a real Super Bowl run.\n\nThere is no dominant team in the NFC like the San Francisco 49ers back of the 1980s or the Dallas Cowboys of the 90s. And as I see it, the Saints have as good a shot as anyone in the conference to play on the biggest Sunday in pro football.\n\nI have been asked numerous times about following the Saints while growing up and how it felt to be a Saints fan first and a beat writer second.\n\nThe answer, it hasn’t been easy.\n\nI will always recall racing to get the newspaper with the list of players the Saints acquired through the veteran expansion draft in 1967 and seeing the names of Paul Hornung, Steve Stonebreaker, Bill Kilmer, Mike Tilleman, Earl Leggett and Dave Whitsell on it.\n\nI vividly recall reading weeks later about the Saints trading for Green Bay Packers All-Pro fullback Jim Taylor, Baltimore Colts quarterback Gary Cuozzo and Chicago Bears All-Pro defensive end Doug Atkins.\n\nMy brother and I stayed up late one night in August, 1967 to listen to the radio for the Saints’ first preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams. While the Saints lost 16-7, we were finally on the NFL map.\n\nThe Saints followed that loss to the Rams with five straight preseason wins and on Sept. 17, 1967 the Saints played their first regular season game in old Tulane Stadium against the Rams.\n\nTwo quick memories come to mind about that game. The first was the ovation given to Taylor, a former LSU star and eventual Hall of Famer, before the game. The standing ovation seemed to last nearly two minutes, but the best moment was yet to come as the Saints’ John Gilliam returned the opening kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. Even NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, who died 10 years ago, jumped out of his seat to applaud the play.\n\nAfter Gilliam hit the end zone, trumpeter Al Hirt, who was also a minority owner of the club, grabbed a field microphone and belted out \"When the Saints Come Marching In,\" as if the song was written for that moment.\n\nI remember at that time telling my brother that the Saints were well on their way to the playoffs.\n\nMy youthfulness and excitement for pro football was quickly put to the test.\n\nThe memories and the events of the past 40 years stick in my mind.\n\nIn quick order, it was Danny Abramowicz’s pass-catching skills, the Stonebreaker led fight in New York, Billy Kilmer’s toughness, the craziness of Joe Don Looney, the firing of coach Tom Fears, trading away Mike Tilleman, Dave Rowe, John Gilliam and Ken Burrough. It’s Tom Dempsey’s 63-yard, game-winning field goal, drafting Archie Manning, hiring former astronaut Dick Gordon as their general manager and trading the second overall pick in the 1973 draft to the Baltimore Colts for journeyman defensive end Billy Newsome and outside linebacker Jim Merlo, Tommy Myers and Howard Stevens. The Colts used that pick on LSU star quarterback and 1976 league MVP Bert Jones.\n\nIt’s hearing a 22-minute \"boo\" that stopped play in the Saints-Eagles game in 1974, the opening of the Louisiana Superdome in 1975, Hank Stram, Chuck Muncie and Tony Galbreath, Wes Chandler coming to town, followed by the dirtiest player in the game -- Conrad Dobler. Former coach Dick Nolan, dancing on the tables at Pat O’Brien’s, \"Big Ben,\" Russell \"Blunderfoot\" Erxleben, watching the Oakland Raiders and Ken Stabler on Monday Night Football come back from a three-touchdown deficit to defeat the Saints 42-35. The \"Aints,\" \"Faith, Hope and Bum,\" George Rogers, Rickey Jackson (what a football player he was!), Archie going to Houston and Stabler taking over at quarterback, Morten Anderson’s kicking leg, Rams kicker Mike Lansford hitting a 42-yard field goal that kept the Saints from clinching their first winning season and earning their first playoff berth in 1983. The \"Cajun Cannon\" Bobby Hebert, John Mecom selling the team.\n\nTom Benson’s \"We are Working to Win\", Jim Finks and Jim Mora, The Dome Patrol linebacking corps of Pat Swilling, Rickey Jackson, Vaughn Johnson and Sam Mills, \"Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda,\" that first winning season and playoff berth in 1987, those damn 49ers, Dalton Hilliard and Eric Martin, \" I Believe\", the Steve Walsh trade, \"Cha-Ching,\" their first division championship in 1991 as members of the NFC West, \"Who Dat,\" watching Willie Roaf, the best football player to ever put on a Saints uniform, \"Oh no, \"Iron\" Mike Ditka takes over,\" Heath Shuler, \"That seals the deal! Ricky Williams is now a member of the New Orleans Saints!\"\n\nRandy Mueller and Jim Haslett, the defensive line tandem of Joe Johnson and La’Roi Glover, Joe Horn comes to town and so does Aaron Brooks, \"Hakim drops the ball!\" and that first playoff win, Deuce, Mueller fired and Mickey Loomis takes over as general manager, Kyle Turley’s prime-time meltdown, not playing backup quarterback Jake Delhomme when Brooks was injured, drafting Georgia defensive tackle Johnathan Sullivan and signing veteran safety Tebucky Jones in the same year. Four straight wins to end the 2004 season, Hurricane Katrina and the San Antonio Saints -- at least for a little while.\n\nHaslett out and Sean Payton in, Drew Brees shocks the football world and becomes a Saint, Scott Fujita, Reg-gie! Reg-gie! Reg-gie!, a brutal training camp in Mississippi, shocking the football world again by going 10-6 and winning their first NFC South title.\n\nAnd now comes tonight.\n\nI always believe the best teams wins at playoff time, and right now, the Saints are a better team than the Eagles. I truly believe tonight’s winner will represent the NFC in Super Bowl XLI in Miami on Feb. 4.\n\nIn my opinion, the Eagles and the Saints are the two best teams in the NFC. The Eagles have the experience of being in big games, but the Saints have that special something, that \"X-factor\" that championship clubs have.\n\nThat \"X\" factor is great team chemistry and tremendous coaching.\n\nFor everything that has been said about the team’s personnel this season, it really comes down to Payton and his staff’s ability to find the right players, put them in the best position to make plays and piece together some of the most imaginative game plans I have seen this season.\n\nI know Hebert, my radio partner, will say tonight’s game will come down to who makes the least amount of turnovers and the Saints’ defense’s ability to avoid giving up big plays.\n\nI certainly agree with Bobby, but I always believe that late in the season, games are won in the trenches.\n\nFor all the big-play exploits of guys like Reggie Bush, Deuce McAllister, Marques Colston and Devery Henderson for the Saints, and Jeff Garcia, L.J. Smith, Brian Westbrook and ex-Saint Donté Stallworth for the Eagles, the game will be won by the team that protects its quarterback the best and pressures the opposing quarterback the most.\n\nYears ago in an interview I did with former San Francisco 49ers coach and Hall of Famer Bill Walsh, he told me the biggest determining factor late in the season is how much pressure a team can put on opposing quarterbacks.\n\n\"This league is built around quarterback play,\" Walsh said. \"So, if you are going to win you must disrupt a team’s ability to throw the ball effectively. Late in the season, no other factor weighs as much on a team’s success as their ability to pressure a quarterback. When I was in San Francisco, we did everything we could to protect Joe Montana and Steve Young and give them opportunities to make plays downfield. Long passing plays take the heart out of a defense, just like pressuring a quarterback and getting them off rhythm takes the life out of an offense. Watch games late in the year, real meaningful games and see the huge amount of games that are affected by a team’s ability to rush the quarterback.\"\n\nProtecting Brees and putting some heat on Garcia seems to be the key to victory for the Saints and maybe, just maybe, we will all get to live long enough to see this team play in an NFC championship game.\n\nIt has been a long, 40-year wait, but the wait for this moment is almost over.\n\nGo Saints and give prime-time viewers another great moment!\n\nAnd for all those Saints fans who have lived the Saints life like I have, enjoy the moment and celebrate just how special this season has been. And just consider that maybe my old radio partner and friend, the late Buddy Diliberto, has them in his football pool in Heaven, and there is more to come.\n\nMIKE D’S TOP PROSPECTS\n\nWith some recent additions to the draft class of 2007, here is my list of the top 10 rated players available for the April draft:\n\n1. Calvin Johnson, wide receiver, Georgia Tech\n\n2. JaMarcus Russell, quarterback, LSU\n\n3. Brady Quinn, quarterback, Notre Dame\n\n4. Joe Thomas, offensive tackle, Wisconsin\n\n5. Gaines Adams, defensive end, Clemson\n\n6. Marshawn Lynch, running back, California\n\n7. Leon Hall, cornerback, Michigan\n\n8. Jamaal Anderson, defensive end, Arkansas\n\n9. Alan Branch, defensive tackle, Michigan\n\n10. LaRon Landry, free safety, LSU\n\nWe are still waiting on decisions from Oklahoma running back Adrian Peterson, LSU defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey, Ohio State wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr. and Hawaii quarterback Colt Brennan, and these four juniors could have a major influence on the top 10, if they declare early.\n\nRUSSELL HEADING FOR RARIFIED AIR\n\nSince the NFL-AFL merger in 1967 brought us one unified college draft, only two LSU players have been selected in the top 10.\n\nQuarterback Bert Jones was the second pick in the 1973 draft by the Baltimore Colts and the Phoenix Cardinals selected Tiger linebacker Eric Hill with the 10th pick in 1989.\n\nWith the Oakland Raiders holding the No. 1 overall pick this year, don’t be surprised to see them select JaMarcus Russell.\n\nRussell’s has the deep-passing skills that Raiders owner Al Davis covets in a quarterback.\n\nNotre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn’s passing skills better fits the profile Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Mike Martz likes in a quarterback.\n\nWith those two teams having the first two choices, the quarterbacks who opposed each other in the Sugar Bowl should come off the board quickly.\n\nNFL analyst Mike Detillier is based in Raceland."
