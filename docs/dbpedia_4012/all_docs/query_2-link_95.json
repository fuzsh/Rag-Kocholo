        "text": "Training camp is approaching steadily, those dog days of summer when roster spots and starting positions are battled out under the unforgiving mid-summer sun. There will be several focuses at the 2008 training camp, recurring themes that pop up every year around this time.\n\nAside from the usual starting position battles, which inevitably take place, training camp will also give us an in-depth look at the rookies. This includes the much-heralded DeSean Jackson, a look at the Eagles' 2008 wide receiver unit, and overall a general outlook on the team we will be rooting for this upcoming 2008 season.\n\nLater next week, as camps begin, I will provide continual updates (which you can check out in the \"Latest News\" section), but for now I will provide elaborate analysis on the upcoming roster units. These articles will come in installments, all the way until training camp begins.\n\nToday I will start with the most anticipated position of all: Wide receiver.\n\nUnlike most of the other positions on this roster, it seems to me right now that the Eagles have two locks. These locks won't have to worry about their starting positions any time soon.\n\nFirst, there's Kevin Curtis, the Eagles' featured receiver who is coming into his fifth year as a starter. Proving his effectiveness in his first year using the West Coast Offense last year, an offense that is sometimes hard to adapt to. Curtis put up solid numbers (1,110 yards with 6 TDs), and looks to build on that this upcoming season.\n\nWhat many people do not put into perspective is that Curtis gained more receiving yards last season than Giants' celebrated wide receiver Plaxico Burress (1,025 to Curtis's 1,110). The discrepancy in TDs (Burress' 12 to Curtis's 6) is due largely in part to the fact that Curtis was not used as often in the red zone.\n\nThis gives Curtis the second most yards of any wide receiver in the NFC East—only behind the infamous Terrel Owens.\n\nNext up is Reggie Brown, a wide receiver who showed flashes of brilliance in 2006, when he recorded 816 yards for 8 TDs. However, after a disappointing 2007 campaign in which he scored only 4 TDs, hopes of his becoming an established wide receiver with the Eagles fell dramatically.\n\nThere's no concrete reason why he shouldn't make huge gains again this year—this said from an optimist's perspective—and hopes are high on him once again.\n\nAfter Reggie Brown, the third wide receiver position is still up for grabs. Last season, Jason Avant took it (267 yards and 2 TDs) while showing considerable toughness and will to succeed. Nevertheless it really is still any man's position for the taking.\n\nDeSean Jackson and Hank Baskett are other likely prospects of taking it. Greg Lewis and Brandon Childress (previously on New England's training squad), as well as Jamal Jones (previously with the Saints) are going to have trouble making the team, let alone see much starting time.\n\nLastly, will the Eagles keep all six receivers (Greg Lewis, Brandon Childress, and Jamal Jones fight it out for that sixth spot), or just go with five (Greg Lewis and other backups likely don't make the team)?\n\nThese answers and more coming up next week as Eagles fans finally get to see everyone in action. Everything will come down to raw talent, stamina, and willingness to play as hard as they possibly can to make the 53-man roster.\n\nIf one thing in the past tells us anything about next week's training camp, it is that until the pads come on, every roster spot is still up for grabs.\n\nShould be exciting!"
