        "text": "DEC 18 SEAHAWKS INACTIVES The Seattle Seahawks have revealed their inactives for Monday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nA surprise to many, Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith (groin) is active after there was a ton of doubt surrounding his availability. However, Seattle is dressing all three of its quarterbacks, indicating he's not 100 percent.\n\nDevon Witherspoon and Jamal Adams are both out for Seattle.\n\nHere's who's out for the Seahawks:\n\n- WR Dee Eskridge\n\n- CB Devon Witherspoon\n\n- S Jamal Adams\n\n- RB Kenny McIntosh\n\n- OT McClendon Curtis\n\n- OT Raiqwon O'Neal\n\n- DE Myles Adams\n\nHere's who's out for the Eagles:\n\n- QB Tanner McKee\n\n- CB Darius Slay\n\n- RB Rashaad Penny\n\n- OG Cam Jurgens\n\n- LB Zach Cunningham\n\n- TE Albert Okwuegbunam\n\nDEC 14 WAGNER FOR ART ROONEY AWARD Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner is one of eight finalists for the 2023 Art Rooney Sportsmanship Award, per an announcement Thursday.\n\nThe other seven finalists include Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, New York Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley, Arizona Cardinals safety Budda Baker, Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Max Crosby, Baltimore Ravens offensive guard Kevin Zeitler, San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk and Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Khalil Mack.\n\nDEC 10 SPOON INJURED Seattle Seahawks rookie cornerback Devon Witherspoon is questionable to return to Sunday's game against the San Francisco 49ers due to a lower back injury, the team announced.\n\nWitherspoon had to be evaluated for a concussion in the blue medical tent on the sideline after making a hard hit on 49ers tight end George Kittle. However, it appears he injured his back on the play.\n\nThe Seahawks lead 10-7 in the second quarter.\n\nDEC 9 SEAHAWKS ROSTER MOVES The Seattle Seahawks are providing themselves some insurance at quarterback headed into Sunday's meeting with the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium.\n\nWith Geno Smith questionable due to a groin injury, the Seahawks are elevating newly-signed veteran quarterback Sean Mannion from the practice squad to serve as the potential backup to Drew Lock if Smith is out.\n\n\"We'll see,\" Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said Friday when asked if Smith will play. \"We rested him today.\"\n\nThe Seahawks also elevated linebacker Patrick O'Connell as part of Saturday's transactions.\n\nNOV 30 JORDYN BROOKS INJURED Seattle Seahawks linebacker Jordyn Brooks suffered an ankle injury in the first half of Thursday night's meeting with the Dallas Cowboys and is doubtful to return.\n\nUpon exiting the game, Brooks was listed as questionable to return but has now had his status downgraded.\n\nBrooks had an early sack on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.\n\nThe Seahawks lead the Cowboys 28-20 in the third quarter.\n\nOCT 30 SEAHAWKS TRADE FOR LEONARD WILLIAMS The Seattle Seahawks are making a big move just over 24 hours before the NFL trade deadline.\n\nAccording to NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero, the New York Giants are trading Pro Bowl defensive lineman Leonard Williams to the Seahawks for a 2024 second-round pick and a 2025 fifth-round pick.\n\nThe trade boosts Seattle's front seven as the team looks to fight for a playoff spot in the second half of the season.\n\nOCT 21 ON KYLER AND BUDDA Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray this week declared that he is \"back'' after missing the first six weeks of the season with a knee injury he suffered last year. But he's not all the way \"back.'' ... and he will not be in the Cardinals' lineup for Week 7 against the Seahawks.\n\nOn Friday the Cardinals officially ruled Murray \"OUT\" for Sunday's game against their NFC West rivals. ... with obviously hurts the Cards' ability to be competitive, as that 1-5 team has gone just 1-9 in his absence.\n\nIt could be argued that Arizona, with a shot at the No. 1 overall pick in next year's NFL Draft, should keep Kyler in mothballs.\n\nMeanwhile, star safety Budda Baker (hamstring) is a candidate to play on Sunday. He's listed as \"questionable.''\n\nOCT 18 CARDINALS BACK TO FULL STRENGTH? The Seattle Seahawks could face a full-strength Arizona Cardinals team on Sunday after their NFC West division rival designated both quarterback Kyler Murray and safety Budda Baker for return from the injured reserve on Wednesday, according to a report from Ari Meirov.\n\nAfter starting the season with Josh Dobbs under center, whom they acquired via a trade with the Cleveland Browns prior to the start of the regular season, Murray could be set to make his return in Seattle.\n\nMurray, the former first-round draft pick, started the season on the injured reserve as he recovered from the torn ACL he suffered in last season's Week 12 game versus the New England Patriots.\n\nMeanwhile, Baker could also see a return on Sunday after missing the last five games due to a hamstring injury.\n\nOCT. 16 SEAHAWKS ROOKIE LOCKS DOWN BENGALS' STAR RECEIVER - The Seahawks didn't get the win Sunday in Cincinnati, but DK Metcalf did get his prediction to come true. Seattle's star said last week that he believed \"Spoon will get the best of him,\" and that's exactly what happened.\n\nComing off a game in which he caught 15 passes for 192 yards and three touchdowns, the Bengals' Ja'Marr Chase was held in check by Seattle's defense and in particular, rookie cornerback Devon Witherspoon.\n\nChase managed only six catches for 80 yards on 13 targets in Cincy's 17-13 win, and failed to make a reception on two targets with Witherspoon shadowing him.\n\nTypical of the rookie's boisterous character, he seemed to let Chase know about it as well.\n\nOCT. 11 SEAHAWKS INJURY REPORT The Seattle Seahawks have revealed their Wednesday injury report ahead of Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Paycor Stadium.\n\nAt first glance, there's some concern since Seahawks receiver DK Metcalf was listed as a DNP on Wednesday due to a ribs issue, but he's had an entire bye week of rest and played in Week 4's win against the New York Giant. As our Corbin Smith reports, the Seahawks are likely just being cautious with him.\n\nHere's the full injury report:\n\nOCT 2 GENO INJURED Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith has returned to Monday's game against the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium.\n\nSmith landed awkwardly after being tackled on the sideline in the first half. After chirping with the Giants defense, he entered the medical tent to be evaluated. Drew Lock entered at quarterback for the Seahawks.\n\nThe Seahawks had originally announced that Smith was questionable to return with a knee injury, but he was back out there to open third quarter. He led Seattle on its first drive of the second half while holding a 14-3 lead.\n\nSEPT 26 SEAHAWKS TO SIGN TAVON? Amid all their injury issues, the Seattle Seahawks could be showing interest in making some additions to the roster via free agency.\n\nPer Aaron Wilson of KPRC2, the Seahawks hosted workouts Tuesday for veteran receiver Tavon Austin and running back Darrell Henderson along with former Baltimore Ravens quarterback Anthony Brown, former New England Patriots running back J.J. Taylor and former Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Cody White.\n\nAustin and Henderson are the most significant names among the group. Austin, a former first-round pick by the then-St. Louis Rams in 2013, played against the Seahawks multiple times in the NFC West.\n\nThe same goes for Henderson, who the Rams took in the third-round of the 2019 draft. He won a Super Bowl with L.A. in 2021.\n\nThe Seahawks could add a few of these players to the practice squad or the active roster ahead of Monday's game against the New York Giants, but that remains to be seen.\n\nSEPT 24 TRE BROWN OUT The Seattle Seahawks entered Sunday's home matchup with the Carolina Panthers already dealing with injuries in the secondary.\n\nThose problems continued in the second quarter as Seattle led 6-3. Cornerback Tre Brown had to exit after taking a hard hit in a tackle scrum. His helmet collided with the elbow of Seahawks rookie Derick Hall, which caused him to take a tough-looking fall to the turf.\n\nPer Gregg Bell of The News Tribune, Brown \"needed help standing\" after being helped over to the sideline. The Seahawks have announced that Brown is out for the game with a concussion\n\nSEPT 20 SEAHAWKS MAKING MOVES The Seattle Seahawks have made some notable roster moves ahead of Sunday's Week 3 tilt against the Carolina Panthers at Lumen Field.\n\nThe Seahawks announced Wednesday that they've placed rookie defensive end Mike Morris on IR due to a shoulder injury, waived linebacker Tyreke Smith and signed tight end Brady Russell.\n\nIt's unclear as of now if Morris has landed on short-term or season-ending IR.\n\nSmith, a fifth-round pick by Seattle last season, missed his entire rookie year due to injury. In Sunday's 37-31 overtime win over the Detroit Lions, he posted one tackle.\n\nSEPT 17 WOOLEN INJURED The Seattle Seahawks can't catch a break in Sunday's meeting with the Detroit Lions at Ford Field.\n\nStar second-year cornerback Tariq Woolen is questionable to return with a chest injury after making a hard tackle in the first half. The Seahawks are already with safety Jamal Adams in the secondary, meaning rookie cornerback Devon Witherspoon will have to step up in his NFL debut.\n\nSEPT 16 SEAHAWKS ELEVATE TWO FOR SUNDAY The Seattle Seahawks have elevated two defensive players from their practice squad ahead of Sunday's meeting with the Detroit Lions at Ford Field, the team announced Saturday.\n\nThe Seahawks are elevating cornerback Artie Burns and linebacker Jon Rhattigan. Both guys played in the Week 1 loss to the Los Angeles Rams and could now see action for the second straight week.\n\nThe Seahawks and Lions kickoff from Ford Field on Sunday at 10 a.m. PT.\n\nSEPT 10 LOCKETT INJURED Seattle Seahawks receiver Tyler Lockett had to exit Sunday's season opener against the Los Angeles Rams after taking a hard hit in the third quarter.\n\nPer our Corbin K. Smith, Lockett is being evaluated for a concussion. He exited the medical tent and was walking on the sidelines at the start of the fourth quarter, but it's unclear if he will return to Sunday's contest.\n\nSEPT 9 KUPP TO IR The Seattle Seahawks already knew that they wouldn't have to face Los Angeles Rams star receiver Cooper Kupp in Sunday's season opener at Lumen Field. Kupp is out with a hamstring injury.\n\nBut now, the Rams have placed Kupp on injured reserve, which will keep him out for at least the first four games of the season.\n\nWith Kupp's absence, the Seahawks will be catching a bit of a break. Now, the Rams' opponents in the coming weeks will as well.\n\nSEPT 7 LIONS BEAT CHIEFS BEFORE SEAHAWKS MATCHUP The Seattle Seahawks got an early look at their Week 2 opponent on Thursday night, as the Detroit Lions pulled off the road upset over the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs in a 21-20 win at Arrowhead.\n\nDetroit’s defense held Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs offense to just six points in the second half, which was highlighted by a 50-yard pick-six from rookie safety Brian Branch at the start of the third quarter.\n\nThe Seahawks will hit the road to face the Lions at Ford Field in Week 2.\n\nSEPT. 4 SEAHAWKS CLIMB TO NO. 12 IN POWER RANKINGS - Coming off their surprising trip to the NFC playoffs a year ago, expectations have risen for Pete Carroll and the Seattle Seahawks. Picked around the middle of the pack in the NFL before training camp, the team has risen a couple of notches in the last power rankings before the regular seasons starts Sunday.\n\nSeattle is ranked 12th - with a bullet - according to Touchdown Wire's latest rankings.\n\n\"The Seahawks could very well win the NFC West this season,\" the site writes. \"Their roster is full of talent at every position, and they don’t have uncertainties over their quarterback like another team we haven’t mentioned yet in their division. Adding Jaxon Smith-Njigba to put in the slot while Tyler Lockett and D.K. Metcalf eat on the perimeter really takes this offense to another level. The same can be said about the addition of Devon Witherspoon in the secondary. The Seahawks will be very fun this season, and are a dark horse team to make it to the NFC Championship Game.\"\n\nAUG. 25 TREY LANCE TO DALLAS The Seattle Seahawks' NFC West rival San Francisco 49ers have traded quarterback Trey Lance to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a 2024 fourth-round pick, per reports Friday.\n\nLance, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 draft out of North Dakota State, was recently announced as the third quarterback on the depth chart in San Francisco. He started last season as the 49ers' starter but suffered a season-ending injury in Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks. Regardless, the Niners advanced to the NFC Championship but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn eight career games, Lance has gone 56 of 102 passing for 797 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions. Known for his dual-threat ability, he's added 54 carries for 235 yards and one touchdown.\n\nAUG 22 SEAHAWKS MAKING MOVES The Seattle Seahawks have made two more roster moves on Tuesday, the team announced.\n\nJust two days after signing former New England Patriots defensive end/linebacker DaMarcus Mitchell, the Seahawks released him in order to make room for undrafted rookie receiver Malik Flowers.\n\nFlowers, who originally signed with the New Orleans Saints in May after going undrafted out of Montana, was an electric return man during his four-year college career. As a returner, he was named a second-team FCS All-American three times. For his career, he tied the D-I record with seven kickoff returns for touchdowns.\n\nAs a receiver, he totaled 52 catches for 716 yards and four touchdowns while adding 16 carries for 251 rushing yards and one score.\n\nThe move comes after it was announced Tuesday that first-round rookie receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba will be undergoing wrist surgery.\n\nAUG 12 CADE OUT OF HOSPITAL Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Cade Johnson seems to be doing OK after he sustained a concussion during Thursday night's preseason game against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nJohnson's injury resulted in him being taken off the field on a stretcher before he was transported to Seattle's Harborview Medical Center for further evaluation. Coach Pete Carroll is saying that Johnson remains in the concussion protocol, but that he has full movement, with tests having shown \"no findings\" of further issues.\n\nAnd what does the player himself say? \"Thanks for all the Prayers,\" Johnson tweeted.\n\nAUG 7 SEAHAWKS SIGN DE\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks have signed former Middle Tennessee State defender Jordan Ferguson to a contract after hosting him for a workout on Monday, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.\n\nFerguson played five season at MTSU, posting 212 total tackles, 22 sacks, five forced fumbles, two interceptions and seven passes defended.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks have signed\n\nAUG 5 RUSSELL REVIEW Sean Payton has been on the attack in Denver, most recently with his wildly out-of-line roasting of his Broncos predecessor as coach Nathaniel Hackett, suggesting Hackett's work with QB Russell Wilson and the rest of that team is a worst-ever effort.\n\nIn a way, that seems a way to boost and shield Wilson, traded to Denver a year ago by the Seahawks. So - after a flop of a 2022 for Wilson, what is his new coach saying after a week in camp?\n\n“I think he’s doing well. I like what I’ve seen,\" Payton said. \"There are times when you’re not seeing a clean picture and he’s scrambling. In a game-type mode, though, where we’re running the ball more and with the installations that we’re doing—I think he’s doing well. I like where he’s at.”\n\nIt is Payton's stated intention to have Wilson start in preseason Game 1 for Denver, something some might call an unusual move. But we get it, we suppose ... if the coach truly wants a \"clean picture'' of what he's got in Russ.\n\nAUG 1 SEAHAWKS SIGN NEW OT The Seattle Seahawks continue to make some smaller signings as training camp moves along, the latest being 2022 undrafted free agent offensive tackle Liam Ryan.\n\nThe Seahawks made the announcement on Monday for Ryan, who originally signed with the team prior to last season before being waived and landing on the practice squad.\n\nA former standout at Washington State where he played with current Seahawks offensive tackle Abraham Lucas, Ryan started 42 consecutive games for the Cougars and 29 straight as a left tackle.\n\nJULY 30 GODWIN SIGNS WITH ATL Former Seattle Seahawks running back and kick returner Godwin Igwebuike has found a new home in the NFL. Per reports Sunday from ESPN's Adam Schefter, Igwebuike is signing with the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nIgwebuike was released from Seattle's practice squad in October of last season after running back Travis Homer returned from injured reserve. However, he was signed back to the practice squad in November.\n\nAfter being elevated to the active roster, Igwebuike was electric as Seattle's primary kick-return man at the end of the season. Despite having just three carries for four yards and one catch for three yards, he had 17 kick returns for 458 yards across the final five games of the regular season and one playoff game.\n\nJULY 25 JIMMY GRAHAM SIGNS Former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jimmy Graham is making a surprising return to the NFL, as he's signing a one-year deal with the New Orleans Saints, per reports.\n\nGraham was a third-round pick by New Orleans in 2010 and became known as one of the best tight ends in the league after leading the NFL with 16 receiving touchdowns in 2013. He was traded to Seattle in 2015 and made the Pro Bowl in two of his three seasons with the Seahawks.\n\nGraham last played in the NFL in 2021 with the Chicago Bears.\n\nJULY 24 SEAHAWKS BRING IN QB FOR WORKOUT It would be more \"training camp arm\" than Geno Smith competition, but the Seattle Seahawks are bringing in former Dolphins and Eagles quarterback Reid Sinnett for a workout.\n\nBehind Smith on the quarterback depth chart, the Seahawks already have Drew Lock and Holton Ahlers, so Sinnett would be, at best, a long-shot to make the final 53-man roster. Sinnett spent the 2022 season on the Dolphins practice squad after being released by Philadelphia, and most recently, he spent time with the XFL’s San Antonio Brahmas before suffering an injury.\n\nThe 26-year-old has never attempted a pass in the NFL.\n\nJULY 9 WAGNER ALL-STAR GAME WATCH Bobby Wagner is soaking in his return back to Seattle, and the legendary Seahawks linebacker is being welcomed back with open arms and then some.\n\nSome fans are so blinded by the excitement of his return to the Emerald City that they forgot to bring something for him to sign during the MLB All-Star Celebrity Softball Game on Saturday at T-Mobile Park.\n\nWagner was one of many notable participants, and went to greet fans near the third-base dugout to take pictures and sign autographs. One fan had nothing for Wagner to sign except his forehead, and the Seahawks linebacker obliged, creating a hilarious moment.\n\nThe 2023 MLB All-Star Game is set to begin at 5 p.m. PT at T-Mobile Park on Tuesday.\n\nJUNE 28 PELLUER PASSES Scott Pelluer - part of what many consider Washington State's \"first family'' of football - died late Monday. He was 64.\n\nPelluer’s brother Steve, the former NFL quarterback, told the Seattle Times that Scott Pelluer was placed in a medically induced coma at a Seattle hospital following a cardiac arrest late last week.\n\n“There was just something about him — a vibrancy, a passion,” Steve Pelluer, a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys and Chiefs, told the newspaper on Tuesday. “He was a man’s man.”\n\nScott Pelluer was a standout at Washington State from 1977 to 1980. He was drafted by the Cowboys in 1981 but then played for the New Orleans Saints for six years before eventually going into coaching.\n\nScott is survived by wife Kimberly, mother Jodee and daughter Jordan, along with his sons Tyler, Cooper and Peyton and brothers Steve and Arnie, all of whom played college football, as did his father and grandfather.\n\nSaid brother Steve: “He had great friends. He cared for people well. And his players enjoyed playing for him.”\n\nJUNE 9 'EAT CROW' The Broncos are rallying around Russell Wilson, with offensive lineman Garett Bolles predicting big success in 2023 from the former Seattle quarterback.\n\nHe's a great dude, he's the same guy every single day, he works his butt off,'' Bolles said after a recent Denver workout. \"And I'm ready for that stuff to go away and when it goes, everyone's going to eat crow.''\n\nSeahawks fans are of course aware of Wilson's ceiling, all of which came tumbling down in Denver after last offseason's blockbuster trade. He was good for just 16 touchdowns and 11 interceptions last year. There is nowhere to go but up now ... and the Broncos hope \"up'' is so high that the critics will shut down.\n\nJUNE 5 MANNING'S PREDICTION FOR RUSS Legendary quarterback Peyton Manning is a resident of the Mile High City and a fan of the Broncos team he once played for. And the retired five-time NFL MVP is also a fan of how Russell Wilson - a flop since last summer's trade from Seattle - is going to get it right now that coach Sean Payton is in Denver.\n\n\"Sean has brought some new juice here. He's going to get the best out of Russell,\" Manning told Stephen A. Smith during an NBA Finals visit on ESPN. \"Russell feels rejuvenated as well. I like my Broncos.''\n\nThe wry Manning also offered a respectful joke on the champions from Kansas City, who of course are in the AFC West with Denver, saying he wished \"the Chiefs would get out of the division.\"\n\nMAY 13: SHAQUILL GRIFFIN SIGNS WITH TEXANS\n\nFormer Seattle Seahawks cornerback Shaquill Griffin has found a new home in the AFC South after spending the past two seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nGriffin has signed a one-year deal worth up to $4.5 million with the Houston Texans, per multiple reports Saturday. He was released by the Jacksonville Jaguars in March despite signing a three-year, $40 million deal with them in 2021.\n\nGriffin was a third-round pick by the Seahawks in 2017. In his Seattle career, he appeared in 57 games (53 starts) and totaled 249 tackles, one sack, six interceptions and 48 passes defended.\n\nAPRIL 14: NFC WEST TRADE REQUEST\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks could have one less thing to worry about in the NFC West.\n\nArizona Cardinals safety Budda Baker has requested a trade from the team, per multiple reports Friday. The Cardinals went 4-13 this past season and are going through coaching and front office changes.\n\nNow, they could lose Baker as well, who's a star in his own right with five Pro Bowl appearances and two All-Pro selections in his six-year career.\n\nIn 2022, he posted 111 total tackles, one forced fumble, two interceptions and seven pass breakups in 15 games.\n\nAPRIL 13 HANG ON! The Philadelphia Eagles surely have no regrets. The Washington Commanders? Maybe they'd like another shot.\n\nAnd most of all, when it comes to last year's trade of QB Russell Wilson?\n\nThe Seahawks are good with it. Thanks for asking.\n\nIn an ppearance on Joey Mulinaro's podcast, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network said that during the 2022 NFL Combine, there were points where he believed either the Eagles or Commanders would trade for Wilson.\n\nSaid Rapoport: \"That was one where you kinda stop everything and you're like, 'Hang on.' ... It shook my brain.''\n\nIt seems, though, that Russell wanted to go to Denver.\n\nThe Eagles ended up significantly better off just moving forward with Jalen Hurts. The Commanders botched everything, starting with Carson Wentz as the \"savior'' and going downhill from there.\n\nWilson, meanwhile, had the worst season of his career, and the Broncos - having given up the farm to Seattle to get him - are now stuck with the five-year, $245.58 million deal that they signed him to before he ever played a game in Denver.\n\nRegrets? Not in Seattle.\n\nMARCH 25 MORE SAFETY INTEREST The Seahawks have already hosted University of Minnesota prospect Jordan Howden for a Top 30 NFL Draft visit. And now they're preparing for an in-house interview with New Mexico's Jerrick Reed II. Granted, Seattle is determined this offseason to repair what was one of the NFL's worst defenses in 2022. But it makes us wonder what will come of veteran Jamal Adams? Seattle has signed former New York Giant Julian Love and tendered an offer to Ryan Neal. If nothing else, all the attention to safety has probably gotten the attention of their best safety.\n\nMARCH 21 NEXT MOVE The Seahawks now stand at $12 million under the cap even after spending on Geno Smith, Dre’Mont Jones, Jarran Reed, Evan Brown and Drew Lock, per OverTheCap.com.\n\nSo, what's next? The first issue is that the calculation doesn't include deals on Devin Bush and Julian Love. ... so to do more business outside the building, the club needs to do some more bookkeeping inside the building.\n\nSeattle has been pretty open about the idea of adding talent to the defensive front seven. Pass-rusher? Run-stopper? Bobby Wagner Reunion Tour? There are holes to fill even on a playoff-worthy roster ... and there is still a bit of money left to help accomplish that.\n\nMARCH 16 NEW LINEMAN The Seahawks have agreed to terms with Detroit Lions center/guard Evan Brown, per an NFL Network report.\n\nThe versatile offensive lineman, 26, was helpful in Detroit as in interior swing guy in 2022 but the former undrafted SMU product (6-3, 320) ended up starting some games at guard due to injury … Just as he did the season before when he ended up starting some games at center.\n\nMARCH 14 PENNY TO PHILLY Rashaad Penny, when healthy, has been a top-notch back for the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAnd now he will try to do the same in Philadelphia, on Tuesday jumping to the Eagles via free agency.\n\nPenny, 27, has spent his entire five-year career with the Seahawks after being selected in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Seahawks will of course rely on Kenneth Walker III, who rushed for 1,050 yards and nine touchdowns in 15 games in his rookie 2022 season.\n\nFEB 21 DISRESPECT? The short answer is, the oddsmakers think the 2022 Seattle Seahawks were a fluke.\n\nThe longer answer includes more nuance ... but a certain level of disrespect regardless.\n\nThe offseason is mere days underway, and the opinion of the Seattle Seahawks is nearly identical to what it was one year ago.\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook currently has the Seahawks at +7000 to win. (ht FieldGulls.) That essentially means there is a 1.4-percent chance of Seattle winning the Super Bowl.\n\nHow low-down insulting is that?\n\nThee are only six teams ranked below the Seahawks - who, by the way, made the playoffs last year - and all of those teams were non-playoff have-nots.\n\nIs the \"insult'' about Geno Smith? About his unsettled contract situation? About the 49ers representing too large an NFC West obstacle?\n\nNo matter the reasoning, the odds are the odds ... and soon, Seattle will work for the second straight year to prove the \"haters'' wrong.\n\nFEB 18 DK JUMP 'INSANE!' DK Metcalf can do some otherworldy things as an athlete.\n\nHe is showing that during NBA All-Star Weekend ...\n\nAnd he is showing it in this video that demonstrates his vertical leap when chasing a football ... in a way that has his contemporaries wondering if the video is fake.\n\n“Nah this is insane,” Dallas cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons tweeted.\n\nAnd from Arizona Cardinals safety Budda Baker: “S**t looks fake but it’s D.K. So can’t rule nothing out.''\n\nRECOMMENDEDSeahawks star DK Metcalf backs up viral jumping video with massive slam at Celebrity GameQuinn Allen ·\n\n5 sneaky good NFL free agents Seahawks must signReese Nasser ·\n\n1 Seahawks player who could be a surprise roster cut in the 2023 offseasonJonathan Alfano ·\n\nStill, if the video is real, DK Metcalf must consider a career change right away. His powers are much too great for football. Every man, woman and child is depending on him. Someone find that man a phone booth.\n\nXX\n\nFEB 14 NEW HEAD MAN IN NFC WEST\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals announced Tuesday that Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon will be their next head coach. The news was first reported by NFL Network.\n\nGannon will receive a five-year contract, per reports from ESPN. He'll now join the NFC West and face the Seattle Seahawks twice a year.\n\nThe Seahawks swept the season series with the Cardinals this past season, as the now-fired Kliff Kingsbury was at the coaching helm for Arizona.\n\nFEB 4 SCHOTT IS BACK Mike McCarthy is going back to the future with his Dallas Cowboys offense ... and with his hire of a new offensive coordinator.\n\nAs expected, the Cowboys are hiring Brian Schottenheimer, promoting him in-house from his 2022 job as a special assistant on McCarthy's staff, to replace the departed Kellen Moore.\n\nSchottenheimer of course is the former Seattle coordinator.\n\nFor background on the Cowboys move and quotes from those involved, click here.\n\nFEB 2 RICHARD OUT The Saints have \"parted ways'' with coach Kris Richard, who has the unusual setup in New Orleans as a \"co-defensive coordinator.''\n\nThe Saints’ other \"co-defensive coordinator,'' Ryan Nielsen, was just hired for the Atlanta defensive coordinator job.\n\nRichard, who spent three seasons as the Seahawks’ defensive coordinator from 2015-17 and was a coach and player here before that, drew some interest from the Dolphins, but the former top assistant with the Cowboys is now looking for work.\n\nJAN 14 FIGHT! The 49ers and the Seahawks?\n\nIt's tight.\n\nAnd it's a fight.\n\nThe 49ers have taken a third-quarter lead, 23-17, in this playoff matchup ... with things getting chippy during the drive when the 49ers appeared to take issue with Seattle safety Johnathan Abram \"putting a twist'' on the ankle of star Deebo Samuel after a 21-yard gain.\n\nThe 49ers scored five plays later. ...\n\nWith the chippiness likely to continue ...\n\nJAN 12 BAD WEATHER? Saturday's playoff game between the Seahawks and the 49ers might very well include inclement weather as a factor.\n\nRain in the Bay? AccuWeather predicts a 98-percent chance of that.\n\nWind in the Bay? Yes, maybe even 29-MPH winds.\n\nDoes that mean this meeting might have to be a run-to-win contest? If so, Christian McCaffrey of the Niners is probably fine with that ... and award-winning rookie Ken Walker III of the Seahawks probably is as well.\n\nJAN 3 BILLS VS. BENGALS REMAINS POSTPONED\n\nThe Week 17 matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals will not be played this week in wake of the on-field collapse of Bills safety Damar Hamlin, the league announced Tuesday.\n\nHere's the full statement:\n\nThe NFL continues to be in regular contact with the medical team caring for Damar Hamlin, and also the Bills and Bengals organizations and the NFL Players Association.\n\nAfter speaking with both teams and NFLPA leadership, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell informed the clubs today that the Bills-Bengals game will not be resumed this week.\n\nThe NFL has made no decision regarding the possible resumption of the game at a later date.\n\nThe league has not made any changes to the Week 18 regular-season schedule.\n\nWe will continue to provide additional information as it becomes available.\n\nHamlin, 24, collapsed on the field during the first quarter of Monday's game and was administered medical attention after it was later revealed that he had suffered cardiac arrest. He remained in critical condition at the ICU at University of Cincinnati Medical Center.\n\nDEC 25 RUSSELL'S THE WORST? The Los Angeles Rams' 51-14 Christmas crushing of Russell Wilson's Denver Broncos reduced the former Seattle QB's new team to 4-11. But in some ways, this marked a new low.\n\nWilson didn't belong on the same field with Baker Mayfield. ... causing our guys at Rams Digest SI, covering the game, to suggest that Russ is \"the crummiest QB in the NFL.''\n\nMayfield, remember, was dumped outright by Carolina but now, off waivers, continues to climb from the scrapheap to offer promise, here finishing a wildly efficient 24 of 28 for 230 yards and two TD tosses.\n\nAnd Wilson? He was part of a Broncos offense that gave up four interceptions and six sacks. ('Hawk-turned-Ram bobby Wagner had one of each on his unfortunate old pal Wilson.)\n\nWrites Rams SI: \"Wilson's Broncos are going nowhere in a painfully plodding manner, making this humiliation largely watchable in the way of a slow-motion train wreck.''\n\nOK, maybe Wilson isn't \"the crummiest.'' But the Broncos' trade for him?\n\nYeah. To the delight of Seahawks fans ... the crummiest.\n\nDEC 24 HOMER QUESTIONABLE Seattle Seahawks backup running Travis Homer is questionable to return vs. the Chiefs on Sunday afternoon with an ankle injury.\n\nHomer's injury occurred in the first quarter at Arrowhead Stadium, with the Seahawks trailing 7-0.\n\nDeeJay Dallas will fill in for Homer as the No. 2 running back until Homer is able to return.\n\nDEC 21 FOUR TO PRO BOWL The Seattle Seahawks will be represented in the 2023 Pro Bowl by four players, the NFL announced. Quandre Diggs and Jason Myers will be going back, and a pair of first-timers - the vet QB Geno Smith and the rookie corner Tariq Woolen - will be joining them.\n\nDEC 21 FRANCO PASSES AWAY Franco Harris, the former Steelers all-time great who finished his Hall of Fame career with the Seahawks, has passed away at the age of 72.\n\nHarris, the running back known in the football world for “The Immaculate Reception,'' was part of four Steelers Super Bowl winners. Harris played 13 years in the NFL – 12 with the Steelers and one with the Seahawks in 1984 before the nine-time Pro Bowler retired.\n\nHarris' death comes on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the play that marked Pittsburgh jump to title contention NFL’s elite and just before this weekend's plan to retire his No. 32 during a ceremony at halftime of the Steelers game against the Las Vegas Raiders - the same team he victimized with the wild carom-catch for a winning TD in a playoff game against Oakland in 1972.\n\nDEC 20 TREADWELL SIGNED\n\nWide receiver Laquon Treadwell has been elevated from the practice squad to the Seahawks roster three times this season, meaning a decision is due: Call him up again and he's eventually subjected to waivers. Or ...\n\nSign Treadwell to the active roster, which ESPN reports is now in the works on Tuesday.\n\nTreadwell, Minnesota's first-round pick in 2016, has one catch for one yard in his three appearances this year and has helped on special teams.\n\nDEC 15 LOCKET INJURED\n\nDuring their crushing defeat to the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday night, the Seattle Seahawks may have also suffered a devastating personnel loss, with wideout Tyler Lockett being forced to leave the game with a broken index finger.\n\nPete Carroll updated the media on Lockett's status following the game.\n\nCarroll expects Lockett to miss time due to the injury.\n\n\"I can't even fathom it,\" Carrol said. \"I can't fathom playing without Tyler.\"\n\nDEC 13 MISSING DEEBO The San Francisco 49ers are 9-4 and in the driver's seat in the NFC West as they approach Thursday's visit to Seattle. It's all feel-good ... maybe even eventually for do-it-all star Deebo Samuel.\n\nHe left Sunday's 35-7 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the second quarter with what looked like a leg injury. ... and the famously tough and talented Samuel was carted away in tears.\n\nBut now it's possible that Samuel - who has issues with his knee and ankle - may make it back sometime before the end of the season.\n\nThe 49ers have some breathing room in the division, with Seattle at 7-6 chasing. Samuel will be watching on Thursday, but as the playoffs approach? Deebo - who has caught 54 passes for 612 yards and two touchdowns this season while also rushing 41 times for 228 yards and three scores - will merit watching.\n\nDEC 11 WILSON CONCUSSION Russell Wilson was knocked out of the game against the Chiefs with a concussion on Sunday, all part of the Broncos' 34-28 loss.\n\nWilson has experienced a dismal season for the 3-10 Broncos since orchestrating his way out of Seattle via a blockbuster trade.\n\nFirst-year Broncos coach Nathaniel Hackett said Wilson is now entered into the concussion protocol. His status for the game next Sunday against Arizona is uncertain.\n\n“He was fighting the whole game. I give him so much credit,” Hackett said of Wilson. “He was playing really well.”\n\nDEC 11 WOODS OUT The Seattle Seahawks appear to be without one of their best defensive linemen for the rest of their Sunday matchup with the Carolina Panthers, with Al Woods listed as doubtful to return with a heel injury, per Seahawks Public Relations.\n\nThe Seahawks trailed 20-14 at the time of the injury.\n\nDEC 10 LAQUON UP The Seattle Seahawks have made a trio of roster moves in advance of Sunday's game against the Carolina Panthers, including the elevation of receiver Laquon Treadwell from the practice squad.\n\nWith injuries to Ken Walker and DeeJay Dallas, Travis Homer, Tony Jones and elevated Godwin Igwebuike are in play at running back,\n\nAdditionally, Jon Rhattigan has been activated off the PUP list.\n\nDEC. 6 SEAHAWKS SIGN WAYNE GALLMAN\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks reportedly added some running depth to their offense on Tuesday, signing veteran running back Wayne Gallman to the practice squad.\n\nGallman comes in at a position of need for the Seahawks, who are already short at the position. Not to mention that starting running back Ken Walker III is currently battling an ankle injury.\n\nOriginally drafted by the Giants in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft out of Clemson, Gallman spent four seasons in New York rushing 338 times for 1,444 yards (4.3 yards per carry) and nine touchdowns in 43 games, with 14 starts.\n\nLast season, Gallman spent time on both the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings playing in eight games and rushing 28 times 104 yards.\n\nHe was also briefly on the Kansas City Chiefs practice squad earlier this season.\n\nDEC. 4 JIMMY GAROPPOLO CARTED OFF In a matchup against the Miami Dolphins, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo was carted to the locker room with an ankle injury after their opening drive.\n\nLabeled as questionable to return, if Garoppolo remains out and misses significant time it will have a big impact on the NFC West race.\n\nFor the Seahawks, who currently find themselves on the outside looking in of the playoffs, the 49ers being forced to rely on rookie quarterback Brock Purdy could be a boost that they need to win the division.\n\nNOV 30 RUSS LOSES IT Russell Wilson has the trade he wanted and he has a $250 million contract.\n\nWhat he does not have with the 3-8 Denver Broncos? The locker room.\n\n“Russ has lost some people around that team. He has lost some people in that locker room,\" NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero reports.\n\nIt's worth noting that Pelissero isn't in the business of gossip, nor is he \"anti-Wilson.'' That makes this a real problem for Wilson - who has just eight touchdowns and five interceptions through 10 games this season - and for the Broncos, who gave up a gold mine in trade but team has now lost each of its last three games.\n\nNOV 26 TREADWELL ELEVATED\n\nLooking for additional wide receiver depth, the Seattle Seahawks have elevated former Jaguars and Vikings pass catcher Laquon Treadwell to the active roster.\n\nLast season in Jacksonville, Treadwell has 33 catches on 51 targets for 434 yards and a touchdown in 12 games, with seven starts.\n\nNOV 20 DK FINED Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf has been fined $29,785 by the NFL for \"unsportsmanlike conduct'' penalty in last week's loss to the Bucs in Germany.\n\nMetcalf was flagged in that game for \"arguing with an official'' (if you could call it that) over an uncalled defensive pass interference penalty in the end zone.\n\nMetcalf finished with a team high 71 receiving yards on six catches. ... and now during the team's bye has to cough up almost $30,000 for a finger-point.\n\nNOV 9 'NEVER MORE WRONG' The At least Curt Menefee is admitting it.\n\n“I’m not afraid to say I don’t think I’ve ever been more wrong about a team coming out of training camp than I was this Seahawks team,” Menefee told Seattle Sports’ Brock and Salk on Tuesday.\n\nThe Seahawks are 6-3 and Menefee, host of \"FOX NFL Sunday'' and the Seahawks preseason TV play-by-play announcer, said he thought they might be lucky to win six games total.\n\nMenefee specifically mentioned coach Pete Carroll, saying \"He was excited about this team'' at camp and that maybe we all should have picked up on that. And he mentioned Geno Smith, a surprise MVP candidate.\n\n“I’m happy for him, I genuinely am because I think it’s a great comeback story,” Menefee said of the QB.\n\nNOVEMBER 1 SEAHAWKS WAIVE SIDNEY JONES\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks have waived veteran cornerback Sidney Jones, after the conclusion of Tuesday's NFL Trade Deadline.\n\nThe Seahawks had attempted to move Jones before the deadline, but were unable to do so.\n\nIn two seasons with the Seahawks, Jones played in 19 games, starting 11, with 66 tackles, and 10 pass deflections.\n\nOCTOBER 25 SEAHAWKS RELEASE TWO FROM PRACTICE SQUAD\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks announced Tuesday that they have released running back Godwin Igwebuike and linebacker Christian Jones from the practice squad.\n\nIgwebuike emerged as an underrated depth piece at running back for the Detroit Lions. Last season, he rushed 18 times for 118 yards and a touchdown while catching seven passes for 60 yards.\n\nJones appeared in three games this season after three elevations from the practice squad.\n\nOCTOBER 20 STAR RB HEADING TO NFC WEST\n\nThe Carolina Panthers have found a trade partner for star running back, Christian McCaffrey - the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, the Panthers will be sending McCaffrey to the Seahawks' NFC West rivals in exchange for multiple second-day picks.\n\nThe Rams and Bills were also said to be in the running for McCaffrey\n\nJust last week against the Rams, McCaffrey had 158 yards from scrimmage in 20 total touches. And for the season, the Stanford product has 670 yards from scrimmage on 118 touches, with three touchdowns, in an otherwise anemic offense.\n\nOCT 19 PRACTICE SQUAD MOVES The Seahawks made two practice squad moves on Wednesday. Seattle signed former WSU standout WR Easop Winston to their practice squad and released Kevin Kassis to make room for Winston.\n\nWinston caught 137 balls for 1,624 yards and 19 touchdowns for the Cougars over 26 games and spent time with the Rams and Saints before arriving in Seattle.\n\nOCT 18 SEATTLE SIGNING The Seahawks on Tuesday had in for a visit veteran defensive tackle Vernon Butler and provided workouts to Notre Dame QB Jack Coan, receivers Dai'Jean Dixon, Dazz Newsome and Easop Winston (of Washington State) and have decided to sign Winston to the practice squad.\n\nOCT 17 NFC WEST TRADE\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals have acquired wide receiver Robbie Anderson from the Carolina Panthers via trade.\n\nAnderson, who played in Los Angeles against the Rams on Sunday, was kicked out of the game by his own head coach, Steve Wilks.\n\n\"I was honestly confused,\" Anderson said after the game. \"I wanted to be in the game. I've never had somebody yell to get out of the game. So I was honestly confused and upset by that. I should be. I don't see nobody that is a true competitor, that knows the value they bring and has true passion for the game, that will be OK with being told not to do something or being taken out of something when they didn't do nothing wrong.\"\n\nOCT 12 MARINERS/SEAHAWKS GAMEPLAN SET\n\nThe contingency plans for the Seattle Seahawks and the Arizona Cardinals' kick-off time have now officially been set.\n\nIn the event that the Seattle Mariners American League Divisional Playoffs Series vs. the Houston Astros goes to four games, the kickoff time will be moved from 1:05 pm PT, to 2:30 PM PT, according to reports.\n\nHouston currently leads the series 1-0 and could sweep the five-game series by winning the next two games, negating the necessity of the time change.\n\nShould the Mariners win one of the next two games, the first pitch for Game 4 of their series will be at 1:07 pm PT.\n\nOCT 10 GAME TIME MOVED?\n\nAccording to Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll, the Seattle Seahawks are in discussions to move the kickoff time of their Sunday matchup with the Arizona Cardinals, so as not to conflict with Game 4 of the Seattle Mariners MLB Divisional series against the Houston Astros.\n\nCarroll says Seahawks are discussing all options, should the times' conflict with one another.\n\nOCT 9 WALKER HOUSE CALL\n\nIn relief of his injured teammate Rashaad Penny, Seahawks rookie running back Kenneth Walker has already made a major impact in the game thus far against the Saints, breaking free for a 69-yard touchdown run to give Seattle a brief 32-31 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nUnfortunately for the Seahawks, the Saints responded with a long Taysom Hill touchdown run of their own on the very next drive, and moved up 39-32 after the two point conversion.\n\nOCT 9 PENNY OUT The Seattle Seahawks are down a running back in their game against the New Orleans Saints as running back Rashaad Penny sustained a lower leg injury in the game and was carted off.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks may be down a running back in their game against the New Orleans Saints today. Running back Rashaad Penny potentially suffered a lower leg injury in the game. He was able to make it to the sideline but had to be helped to the bench by teammates to get checked out by trainers.\n\nPenny had eight carries for 54 yards before getting hurt and now gives way to at least in part the rookie Kenneth Walker III.\n\nOCTOBER 7 SAINTS NAME ANDY DALTON STARTING QB VS. SEAHAWKS\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are set to face Andy Dalton and the New Orleans Saints this weekend after starter Jameis Winston was ruled out for the second straight week with a back and hip injury.\n\nDalton made his Saints debut last week in London against the Minnesota Vikings.
