        "text": "Let’s get to the Philadelphia Eagles links ...\n\nBest trade fits for Jamal Adams, and what the New York Jets safety is worth - ESPN+\n\nMike Clay, fantasy writer: Eagles. Philadelphia currently ranks among the league leaders in cap space and has a major need at safety following the offseason departure of Malcolm Jenkins. Linebacker and edge rush depth are also weak spots, which makes Adams’ versatility very intriguing. The Eagles are also in need of guard help following Brandon Brooks’ injury, so perhaps a deal including Adams and Brian Winters could be in the cards. [...] Aaron Schatz, editor of Football Outsiders: Eagles. Moving Jalen Mills to safety seems like a good idea, but let’s make no mistake, Adams would be a major upgrade as a playmaker who could do everything Jenkins has done for the Eagles’ defense in the past. And their weakness at linebacker makes them a team likely to mix in some three-safety packages.\n\nJamal Adams was seen in a social media video saying he is trying to get to Dallas - Blogging The Boys\n\nWhether you are on Instagram or not, it is likely that you saw what Jamal Adams did there over the weekend. The All-Pro safety threw some “likes” onto posts that featured him in various non-Jets jerseys, and he happened to like multiple examples of him wearing the silver and blue. What’s more is that on Sunday evening a video of Adams surfaced online and in it he can be seen driving. Somebody shouts at him and asks if he’s going to “come to Dallas” to which he responds that he is trying.\n\nTalking through the Eagles’ potential trade for Jamal Adams - BGN\n\nLike Jenkins, Adams took a healthy amount of snaps at every alignment imaginable: 97 on the defensive line, 400 in the box, 131 at slot corner, and 297 at free safety. Like Jenkins, Adams is a bigger body (6’1, 215 pounds) suited for playing in the second level and winning one-on-one against blockers. Like Jenkins, Adams’ leadership is renowned in his locker room and on the field. Unlike Jenkins, Adams is coming off of an All-Pro season and is just 25 years old. Adams, a wicked competitor, is interested in playing for competitive teams — teams with a Super Bowl shot this year. As was the case with Jenkins in Philly, he’s looking for a new landing spot because the Jets won’t engage with him on a contract extension — but Adams has given the Jets a list of teams he would like to be traded to, and would potentially play for without an extension. The Eagles are reportedly on that list.\n\nEagles 2020 Over/Unders - BGN Radio\n\nJimmy Kempski and Brandon Lee Gowton debate Eagles over/unders for 2020 with thoughts on the potential Jamal Adams trade AND thoughts on production for Wentz/Sanders/Alshon/Reagor/Barnett and more! Powered by SB Nation and Bleeding Green Nation.\n\nFive NFL Coaches Share What They Learned From the Virtual Offseason Program - MMQB\n\nThe Eagles’ guard situation bears watching in the wake of Brandon Brooks’s injury. We went over this in the GamePlan Thursday—Howie Roseman values linemen, on both sides of the ball, and while they trust line coach Jeff Stoutland to bring guys along, like where Matt Pryor and Nate Herbig are, and drafted Jack Driscoll at the position, they won’t leave anything to chance here. So this could go a couple of ways. One, they could address it now and pursue a veteran immediately. Two, they could wait, see what they have in camp, and then decide on whether to go with one of the young guys or to add someone. Either way, there are options there, especially since, as of Sunday, the Eagles have the fourth most cap space in the league ($24.6 million). They could call New England, and try to pry either Joe Thuney or Shaq Mason (the two combine for over $23 million against the cap this year, and the Patriots are less than $1 million under). Or maybe they try and coax Kyle Long out of retirement, given the overwhelmingly positive experience his brother Chris had as an Eagle. Either way, I don’t see Roseman allowing the position to be a problem in Brooks’s absence.\n\nWhat to make of the Joe Thuney-to-the-Eagles trade speculation - Pats Pulpit\n\nPutting all those arguments as well as the Patriots’ current personnel and long-term team building perspective into account, it seems as if the team has more incentive trying to work out a long-term deal with Thuney — as was stated in the official statement accompanying the decision to use the tag on him — than to trade him to Philadelphia. That does not eliminate a move as a possibility, in particular if Eagles general manager Howie Roseman offers a quality asset in return, but it does make it seem unlikely.\n\nJohn Hightower’s secret weapon and more in Roob’s random Eagles observations - NBCSP\n\nIt’s pretty wild that the Eagles have reached the playoffs the last two years despite just 10 interceptions in 2018 and 11 this past year. That made them only the second team in NFL history with back-to-back playoff seasons with 11 or fewer interceptions (along with the 2010 and 2011 Saints). Only four teams had fewer interceptions the last two years than the Eagles, and that’s a tough way to play defense. Amazing that they’ve been as good as they’ve been without those impact plays that shift field position. Darius Slay is supposed to remedy that, but although he led the NFL with eight INTs in 2017, he’s only had five the last two years — tied for 31st-most in the NFL. Now, I understand that opposing quarterbacks weren’t throwing his way that much and I understand that a big part of interceptions is pass pressure. But the Eagles haven’t had a ballhawk in the secondary since Asante Samuel a decade ago. They need interceptions from Slay. Not two or three. Lots of ‘em.\n\nEagles landed 3 potential contributors from minor midseason trade - NJ.com\n\nGoodwin is expected to provide important depth at wide receiver this season. He can stretch the field as an outside receiver and be effective in the slot as well. Goodwin can team with Jackson and first-round pick Jalen Reagor to provide the Eagles with world-class speed in the passing game. In addition to Riley and Goodwin, the Eagles used the 210th overall pick, acquired in the sixth-round swap, to select Auburn offensive tackle Prince Tega Wanogho. The sixth-round lineman has been lauded as a draft-weekend steal by several pundits, including Senior Bowl director Jim Nagy.\n\nJosh Gordon applies for reinstatement: Five potential landing spots for former Seahawks WR - CBS Sports\n\nNew York Giants — New coach Joe Judge carries a no-nonsense attitude, but he was part of the Patriots team that welcomed Gordon to town in 2018. Fellow Giants staffers Jerry Schuplinski and Brett Bielema, a former Bill Belichick consultant, also witnessed Gordon’s brief revival in New England. More importantly, the Giants could stand to improve their depth behind Golden Tate, Sterling Shepard and Darius Slayton, especially with Daniel Jones entering a critical Year Two. Would the G-Men want to invite Gordon and his history of availability issues to the New York market? Maybe not. But from a football perspective, the idea of adding another big body to that offense has merit.\n\nGuest: Front-Line Workers On How Sports Helped Them Prepare - FMIA\n\nEvery morning at Jefferson Health, the leaders on our team meet in a virtual conference room for a one-hour meeting we call our Daily Huddle. There, we review a daily scorecard about the COVID-19 numbers at our facilities—how many positive tests, how many hospital admissions and discharges, ventilator usage, PPE usage, how much PPE is stocked at each hospital, things like that. For instance, we typically use 14,000 gowns and 5,000 masks in a day. We have a horizontal structure. We force accountability, but everyone’s voice is heard. The PPE usage is an interesting story. We did disaster planning—what would happen if there was a bomb that exploded at a Phillies or Eagles game, and we had to treat thousands? We realized we needed to really lay in the supplies for PPE, because we might have to prepare to treat a lot of people in an emergency situation for weeks. We overstocked, basically. No one in our hospitals would ever work without proper protective equipment. So in the second week of March, before the virus took hold, we went to an all-mask environment at every one of our facilities. So far, we have cared for more than 10,000 people with COVID-19, and more than 700 patients in our hospitals on a given day—and we have had only 25 of more than 25,000 of our people on the front lines hospitalized with COVID-19, and only two deaths.\n\nNFLPA recommends that players stop private group workouts - NFL.com\n\nThe NFL Players Association is advising its players to cease private group workouts. NFLPA medical director Dr. Thom Mayer released a statement Saturday recommending players to stop “practicing together” until the start of training camps in late July. “Please be advised that it is our consensus medical opinion that in light of the increase in COVID-19 cases in certain states that no players should be engaged in practicing together in private workouts,” Mayer wrote. “Our goal is to have all players and your families as healthy as possible in the coming months.”\n\n...\n\nSocial Media Information:\n\nBGN Facebook Page: Click here to like our page\n\nBGN Twitter: Follow @BleedingGreen\n\nBGN Instagram: Follow @BleedingGreenInsta\n\nBGN Manager: Brandon Lee Gowton: Follow @BrandonGowton"
