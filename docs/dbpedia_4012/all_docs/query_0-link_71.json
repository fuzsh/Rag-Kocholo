        "text": "Tim Jones knew his place in the hierarchy of an NFL team last year when the Jaguars signed him as an undrafted free-agent rookie wide receiver from Southern Mississippi.\n\n\"The bottom of the bottom,\" Jones said on Tuesday after the Jaguars practiced at TIAA Bank Field. \"I had to work my way into the system.\"\n\nJones overcame a training-camp injury, was waived, brought back to the practice squad and like all of the players weathered the Urban Meyer fiasco.\n\n• Listen Now! Can Jaguars go from laughing stock to respectability in one year? It's possible\n\n• Best for both parties: Jaguars brass explains decision to trade WR Laviska Shenault Jr.\n\nWhen Doug Pederson took over as coach, those from last year's team who were in a battle for their jobs were all given an equal chance.\n\nJones is one who maximized it. He was the offensive star of the four preseason games, toiled on special teams with no complaints and when the Jaguars cut their roster down to 53 players, he had made it.\n\nJones caught 14 passes for 219 yards in the preseason games (15.6 yards per catch), including two receptions of 49 and 51 yards. His performance in those games and in practice made Jags management comfortable enough to part ways with two veterans, cutting Laquon Treadwell and trading Laviska Shenault, and waiving Kevin Austin Jr., Willie Johnson and Jeff Cotton Jr.\n\nAs of this week, Jones is the fifth wide receiver, behind Marvin Jones, Zay Jones, Christian Kirk and Jamal Agnew.\n\n\"I was antsy ... hoping for the best,\" Jones said of the time between last Saturday's preseason game in Atlanta when he caught three passes for 103 yards. \"I can't control what the coaches do ... anything can happen in the league.\"\n\nBut the coaches had good news for the native of Biloxi, Miss., and a second-team All-Conference USA player in 2019 who caught 150 passes for 2,011 yards and nine touchdowns during his college career.\n\n\"He took advantage of his opportunities,\" Pederson said. \"That has been my message since I got here. Everyone gets an opportunity and the ones that grasp it get chances in this league. He did a nice job on special teams for us ... and he showed us the other day – some of the plays he made during the Atlanta game really stood out to us.\"\n\nSmith said the transition from Southern Miss to the NFL hasn't been easy. After getting hurt in camp last year he was waived with an injury designation and released in August.\n\nHe cleared waivers and was brought back and put on injured reserve. Jones was re-signed to the practice squad on Sept. 27 on the same day the team traded cornerback C.J. Henderson to Carolina for Dan Arnold and a third-round draft pick.\n\nThrough it all, Jones was learning of NFL 101, especially the speed of the pro game and how much it differs from college.\n\n\"Last year, coming in, I was not nervous but new to everything,\" he said. \"The playbook in the NFL vs. in college is definitely way more broad. It was hard for me last year. I'm not going to lie to you. Picking up new plays, the speed of the game, how they were calling stuff.\"\n\nJones said the injury was a bit of a blessing, giving him time to absorb an NFL system.\n\n\"It was not setting me back but giving me time to learn everything from guys like Marvin Jones and everybody,\" he said of the Jags veteran. \"Getting the flow of the NFL instead of college, dealing with the game speed. This year I had a whole new mindset.\"\n\nMarvin Jones said the difference between seasons for Tim Jones has been night and day.\n\n\"It's been amazing,\" he said. \"He didn't really get a lot of reps last year because he was hurt but he's been here, throughout the spring and camp and he's taken a great leap in his overall understanding of the game. It's great to see him evolve into what he is now and he's still working. He had an amazing camp and now's the time to work harder.\"\n\nContact Garry Smits at gsmits@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter @GSmitter"
