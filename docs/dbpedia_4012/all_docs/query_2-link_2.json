        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nPHILADELPHIA — The Philadelphia Eagles signed wide receiver Jamal Jones and defensive ends Xzavie Jackson and A.J. Schable to multi-year contracts on Tuesday.\n\nJones and Jackson each got three-year deals and Schable received a two-year contract. None of the players played in an NFL game this season.\n\nJones played in 14 games, including playoffs, for New Orleans in 2006. He caught six passes for 108 yards and one touchdown. Jackson was added to the Eagles’ practice squad in November. Schable appeared in 11 games for Arizona as a defensive end and fullback in 2006.\n\nThe Eagles also announced tight end Brent Celek underwent successful surgery to repair the labrum in his right shoulder."
