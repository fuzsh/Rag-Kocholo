        "text": "Fresno State: Steady player who has overcome injuries and made a contribution to the team last season ... a hard-working walk-on player .... should see action again in his senior season. (2008) Played in eight games ... proved to be a reliable and sturdy threat out of the backfield ... rushed 35 attempts for 153 yards for an average of 19.1 yards per game and 4.4 yards per carry ... longest rush went for 15 yards. Glendale College: In 2005, rushed for 1200 yards and registered 250 receiving yards ... served as team captain, most valuable player ... named all-conference. High School: Lettered in 2003 and 2004 ... named three-time team Most Valuable Player and Captain from 2002-04 ... earned all-league honors in 2004 to help Granada Hills to 9-1 record. Personal: Born December 8, 1987 in Los Angeles ... the only child of Erik Rashad and Cathy Letzia ... his cousin Alex Barton played football for Florida State and another cousin Freddy Michelle played football for the Philadelphia Eagles ... lists Walter Payton as favorite athlete because he was relentless in the way he ran the ball despite his size and proved to be a hard worker ... lists biggest athletic thrill as seeing results that I am pleased with due to his hard week ... most admires his mother, Cathy ... also recruited by Arizona, Nevada, Minnesota and Oregon State ... chose to attend Fresno State because it is a great program."
