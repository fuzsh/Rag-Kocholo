        "text": "USC running back Ronald Jones II is one of the best fits for the Eagles’ rushing attack. Jones said he has a meeting scheduled with Philadelphia on Thursday night at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis.\n\nDoug Pederson brought a lot of the run scheme concepts from the Chiefs to Philadelphia when he became the head coach. Former Chiefs back Jamaal Charles was the primary back for two of Pederson’s three seasons as offensive coordinator. Charles rushed for over 1,000 yards in the two seasons with Pederson and scored 21 touchdowns on the ground.\n\nGrowing up in Texas, Ronald Jones II was a big fan of Charles since he was a standout back for the Longhorns. There are plenty of similarities between the two players. That doesn’t happen to be an accident.\n\n“Jamaal Charles, I love his game. He was one of my idols growing up. I’ve been a fan. Back in his days at Texas and with the Chiefs,” Jones said on Thursday at the NFL Combine. “Even with the Denver Broncos now, I’ve always been a fan of his game. He is the reason why I wear No. 25. We both had dreadlocks at the time so it’s just stuff like that and he’s from Texas!”\n\nLike Charles, Jones is a threat to score anytime he touches the football. He has the acceleration ability to eat up chunks of yards in a hurry.\n\nJones described himself as a ‘quick, north and south runner, a decisive three-down back. He feels he is at his best when running in between the tackles and on outside zone.\n\nThe Eagles like to use a lot of outside zone runs that get their offensive linemen on the move to escort the backs to the second level of the defense. The idea of playing in that type of scheme brought a smile to Jones’ face when he was asked how it fits his skill set.\n\n“I believe it matches a lot. You look at a lot of teams and what they like to do, certain teams, they use the ‘pin and pull’ which is like a lot of the stuff that we did at USC,” Jones said.\n\nThe backs are given an opportunity to cut back against the flow of the defense on the outside zone runs. Being able to see those lanes and make the decisive cuts up the field leads to significant gains.\n\nIt requires vision, footwork, and timing. All of which come easily to Jones.\n\n“I think it is something that comes naturally and also deals with timing,” Jones explained. “Depending on what the blocking scheme is. You have to hit the hole with acceleration, so you don’t get caught from behind.”\n\nJones said he is looking forward to adding more weight. He currently weighs in at 205 pounds but expects to be in the 210-pound range. While the added weight may slow down other backs, Jones doesn’t expect it to be an issue for him."
