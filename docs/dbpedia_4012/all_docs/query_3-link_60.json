        "text": "Matthew Stafford threw a touchdown pass to Marvin Jones, Jamal Agnew returned a kickoff 100 yards for a score and the Detroit Lions held on for a 27-24 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.\n\nThe Eagles had a chance after Malcolm Jenkins blocked Matt Prater's 46-yard field goal try with 1:53 left. Rasul Douglas returned it to the Lions 22, but an illegal block on Jenkins pushed it back to midfield.\n\nOn fourth-and-5, Darren Sproles caught a pass for a first down but got called for Philadelphia's third offensive pass interference. Wentz's deep pass to J.J. Arcega-Whiteside fell incomplete with 41 seconds left.\n\nThe Lions (2-0-1) remain undefeated and the Eagles (1-2) have lost two in a row.\n\nJones had six catches for 116 yards, including a 12-yard TD reception that extended Detroit's lead to 27-17 on the first play of the fourth quarter.\n\nCarson Wentz threw a pair of touchdown passes to Nelson Agholor, but came up yards short on a scramble on fourth-and-8 late in the fourth.\n\nThe Eagles' injury-depleted offense missing its top two receivers was sloppy.\n\nMiles Sanders and Agholor lost fumbles, there were a few drops, and wideout Mack Hollins committed two pass-interference penalties.\n\nWentz clearly missed DeSean Jackson and Alshon Jeffery as receivers struggled to get open. Jackson didn't play because of an abdomen injury and Jeffery has a calf strain.\n\nThe Eagles cut it to 27-24 when Wentz threw a 2-yard TD pass to Agholor with 6:59 left. Penalties cost the Lions on that drive.\n\nA late hit on Wentz against Trey Flowers extended it and an unnecessary roughness call on Jarrad Davis moved the ball to the 5.\n\nWentz threw a 20-yard TD pass to Agholor in the third quarter. But the Lions answered with Stafford's TD to Jones.\n\nKerryon Johnson's 1-yard TD run gave the Lions a 14-10 lead early in the second quarter.\n\nSanders fumbled twice on one drive and Detroit recovered his second one. That led to Prater's 25-yard field goal and a 17-10 lead.\n\nThe Lions recovered another fumble on the ensuing series when Agholor lost the ball after a short catch.\n\nDarius Slay returned it 38 yards to the Eagles 22 as Wentz dove to make the tackle. The defense held and Prater kicked a 33-yarder to make it 20-10.\n\nJordan Howard ran in from the 1 after Wentz scrambled 19 yards on third-and-6, giving the Eagles a 10-7 lead in the first quarter.\n\nThe Eagles used a no-huddle approach to get their slow-starting offense going on the opening drive and it resulted in a 25-yard field goal by Jake Elliott.\n\nThe Lions answered quickly when Agnew went the distance.\n\nMISSED CALL\n\nSanders had his helmet ripped off on a kickoff return when he was clotheslined by Miles Killebrew, who also grabbed the facemask and spun it around.\n\nThere was no penalty called.\n\nThe blatant miss was nearly as obvious as the non-call on the pass interference in the Rams-Saints NFC championship game. Todd Prukop was the back judge for both games.\n\nINJURIES\n\nLions: DT Mike Daniels (foot) left in the first quarter and didn't return and Slay (hamstring) exited in the third quarter.\n\nEagles: CB Ronald Darby (hamstring) and LT Andre Dillard (knee) left in the first half.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLions: Host Kansas City next Sunday. The Chiefs won the previous matchup 45-10 on Nov. 1, 2015, but the Lions have won the past two times at home.\n\nEagles: At Green Bay on Thursday night. The Packers have won five of the past six meetings, including a 53-20 rout at Lambeau Field on Nov. 16, 2014."
