        "text": "FEB 11 BIG DOM, LURIE MEET REID AT SUPER BOWL Despite entering the 2023 season looking to repeat as NFC champs, the Philadelphia Eagles aren't playing in Super Bowl 58 in Vegas on Sunday night.\n\nEagles owner Jeffrey Lurie and chief security chief Dom DiSandro still made their way to the big game to watch the Kansas City Chiefs take on the San Francisco 49ers. Former Eagles coach Andy Reid is looking to capture his third Lombardi with K.C., and he met up with Lurie and DiSandro during pregame at Allegiant Stadium.\n\nTake a look:\n\nJAN 15 JULIO JONES RULED OUT Philadelphia Eagles receiver Julio Jones had to be taken off the field to be evaluated for a concussion in the first half of Monday night's playoff matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nHe's now been ruled out for the rest of the game.\n\nJones took a hard hit while making a 14-yard grab near the end of the second quarter. He appeared shaken up and was escorted to the sidelines.\n\nThe Eagles made an official announcement:\n\n\"Injury Update: WR Julio Jones has been ruled out.\"\n\nPhilly trails 16-9 as the third quarter gets underway.\n\nDEC 31 INACTIVES The Eagles will be without linebacker Zach Cunningham (knee) as they face the Cardinals on Sunday, the linebacker having been downgraded from questionable to doubtful to out. Here’s the full list of Eagles’ inactives:\n\nCB Darius Slay (knee)\n\nLB Zach Cunningham (knee)\n\nCB Bradley Roby\n\nQB Tanner McKee\n\nDT Marlon Tuipulotu\n\nOL Tyler Steen\n\nAll of that means Rashaad Penny gets a uniform today. And for the Cardinals, quarterback Kyler Murray (illness) is active.\n\nDEC 22 EAGLES FRIDAY INJURY REPORT The Philadelphia Eagles have revealed their Friday injury report, and some key names remained sidelined in advance of Monday's meeting with the New York Giants on Christmas Day.\n\nFive players were listed as DNP on Friday, as receiver DeVonta Smith (knee), cornerback Darius Slay (knee), linebacker Zach Cunningham (knee), guard Landon Dickerson (thumb) and linebacker Nicholas Morrow (abdomen) all sat out.\n\nHere's the full injury report:\n\nDEC 18 EAGLES INACTIVES, HURTS OFFICIALLY IN The Philadelphia Eagles and Seattle Seahawks have both revealed their inactives for Monday night's game at Lumen Field.\n\nJalen Hurts (illness) and Geno Smith (groin) are both officially active after there was doubt if both would be playing.\n\nHere's who's out for the Eagles:\n\n- QB Tanner McKee\n\n- CB Darius Slay\n\n- RB Rashaad Penny\n\n- OG Cam Jurgens\n\n- LB Zach Cunningham\n\n- TE Albert Okwuegbunam\n\nHere's who's out for the Seahawks:\n\n- WR Dee Eskridge\n\n- CB Devon Witherspoon\n\n- S Jamal Adams\n\n- RB Kenny McIntosh\n\n- OT McClendon Curtis\n\n- OT Raiqwon O'Neal\n\n- DE Myles Adams\n\nDEC 17 EAGLES CLINCH PLAYOFF BERTH With the San Francisco 49ers' 45-29 win over the Arizona Cardinals, the Philadelphia Eagles have officially clinched a playoff berth. They join the 49ers and Dallas Cowboys as the only three teams to clinch a postseason spot so far.\n\nThe Cowboys were throttled by the Buffalo Bills in a 31-10 loss at Highmark Stadium on Sunday, which puts the Eagles even further into driver's seat to win the NFC East.\n\nThe Eagles will close out Week 15 on Monday night against the Seattle Seahawks at Lumen Field.\n\nDEC 16 SLAY OUT VS SEAHAWKS Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Darius Slay is out for Monday night's game against the Seattle Seahawks after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery this week, per reports from ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nHe is expected to return before the regular season concludes, per the report.\n\nThis season, Slay has posted 57 total tackles, 15 passes defended, two interceptions and one touchdown.\n\nDEC 10 BLANKENSHIP INJURED Philadelphia Eagles safety Reed Blankenship had to exit in the first half of Sunday night's game against the Dallas Cowboys, and the team later announced that he is being evaluated for a concussion.\n\nThe team has now ruled him out for the game.\n\nBlankenship has dealt with injuries this season, including a notable rib issue early in the year.\n\nHere's Philly's official injury announcement:\n\nDEC 8 ELLIS TO NEW ENGLAND The Philadelphia Eagles waived linebacker Christian Elliss on Wednesday, but he's quickly found a new home.\n\nThe New England Patriots claimed Elliss off of waiver Thursday, adding him to coach Bill Belichick's defense hours before the Patriots completed a 21-18 road upset over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Elliss didn't play of course, but he could likely be active for the first time when the Patriots take on the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 15.\n\nESPN's Field Yates reported that many other teams attempted to claim Elliss.\n\n\"New Patriots LB Christian Elliss was an extremely popular player on waivers, as six teams put in a claim on him, per source: Patriots Cardinals Titans Falcons Broncos Dolphins,\" Yates tweeted.\n\nDEC 6 NFL MEMO The NFL released a memo Wednesday addressing sideline conduct in light of Sunday's altercation between San Francisco 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw and Philadelphia Eagles security chief Dom DiSandro.\n\nThe memo addresses all 32 teams, stating that staff personnel are prohibited from “being involved with game day altercations and that they must refrain from such involvement.”\n\nPer ESPN's Adam Schefter, the situation \"remains under review by the league office.\" Greenlaw poked DiSandro in the eye area after the Eagles' security chief got in the middle of some back-and-forth jawing following an unnecessary roughness flag on Greenlaw.\n\nHere's the full memo:\n\nDEC 4 DOM VS DRE Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, the NFL is set to review video from the sideline incident that occurred between Philadelphia Eagles security chief Dom DiSandro and San Francisco during the third quarter of Sunday's game at Lincoln Financial Field. The Niners won 42-19.\n\nThis process could determine whether or not DiSandro and Greenlaw receive punishment from the league, who were both ejected after the incident. Per the report, the league is expected to follow up with the Eagles later in the week.\n\nAfter Greenlaw drew an unnecessary roughness flag on the Eagles sideline, DiSandro got in the middle of Greenlaw and Philly receiver DeVonta Smith. Greenlaw then poked DiSandro near his eye area before walking away.\n\nDEC 3 EAGLES INACTIVES The Philadelphia Eagles have revealed their inactives for today’s game against the San Francisco 49ers at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nDespite not practicing during the week due to the groin injury he suffered in the win over the Buffalo Bills in Week 12, Eagles defensive tackle Fletcher Cox is active against the 49ers.\n\nHere’s the full inactives list:\n\nDEC 1 EAGLES RULE OUT TWO VS NINERS The Philadelphia Eagles have ruled out two players for Sunday's showdown with the San Francisco 49ers at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nLinebacker Zach Cunningham (hamstring) and safety Justin Evans (knee) are both out while tight end Dallas Goedert (forearm) is doubtful. Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox (groin) and tight end Grant Calcaterra (ankle) are both questionable.\n\nHere's the full injury report:\n\nNOV 30 EAGLES ROSTER MOVES The Philadelphia Eagles are making some key roster moves ahead of Sunday's meeting with the San Francisco 49ers at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nThe Eagles announced these moves via social media on Thursday:\n\n\"We've signed LB Ben VanSumeren to the active roster, signed DB Josiah Scott and WR Cam Sims to the Practice Squad, and released WR Greg Ward from the Practice Squad.\"\n\nEagles fans will now be waiting to see if Shaquille Leonard is the next piece to fall into place after the former Indianapolis Colts linebacker arrived in Philadelphia on Wednesday for his free-agency visit.\n\nNOV 29 EAGLES WEDNESDAY INJURY REPORT The Philadelphia Eagles have revealed their injury report following Wednesday's walk-through practice session as they prepare for Sunday's meeting with the San Francisco 49ers at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nThe Eagles had five players listed as DNP.\n\n- TE Grant Calcaterra (ankle)\n\n- DT Fletcher Cox (groin)\n\n- LB Zach Cunningham (hamstring)\n\n- S Justin Evans (knee)\n\n- TE Dallas Goedert (forearm)\n\nHere's the rest of the injury report:\n\nNOV 26 HURTS SETS RECORD Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts set an NFL record on Sunday against the Buffalo Bills thanks to his latest Brotherly Shove rushing touchdown.\n\nHurts scored from one yard out to give the Eagles a 7-0 lead, but simultaneously became the first quarterback in NFL history to have 10 or more rushing touchdowns in three straight seasons.\n\nTake a look:\n\nNOV 25 EAGLES ROSTER MOVES The Philadelphia Eagles have made a pair of notable roster move ahead of their matchup with the Buffalo Bills at home on Sunday.\n\nThe Eagles announced that they've activated receiver Quez Watkins off of injured reserve and have elevated linebacker Ben VanSumeren and tight end Noah Togiai from the practice squad ahead of Sunday's marquee matchup.\n\nWatkins, who is listed as questionable for Sunday, had been on IR for the past four games due to a hamstring injury.\n\nNOV 20 MILTON WILLIAMS OUT Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Milton Williams took an incidental hit to the helmet from teammate and Eagles linebacker Nicholas Morrow in the third quarter of Monday night's meeting with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nHe appeared shaken up afterwards, and the Eagles announced at the start of the fourth quarter that Williams is being evaluated for a concussion. The team announced shortly after that Williams is now out for the rest of the game.\n\nWilliams exited the game with five total tackles and one tackle for loss.\n\nNOV 8 'YOU CAN'T BREATHE!' We know what the “Tush Push” does to Eagles opponents; it's 4,000 pounds of muscle shoving them backward for another Philly first down or touchdown.\n\nAnd beyond those \"grunts,'' we know what is does for the NFL glamor guy, the quarterback; Jalen Hurts gets the stats.\n\nBut what about the guy who is sort of caught in the middle of the muddle?\n\nSaid 170-pound receiver DeVonta Smith on the “This Is Football Podcast,” describing his thoughts and involvement on the \"Tush Push'': “You can’t breathe. Everybody’s on top of you, you can’t breathe. No matter how hard you try to breathe, it doesn’t work.”\n\nAnd therefore? \"I'm going to push a little bit,'' Smith added, \"but I'm not going to get up in that pile.''\n\nNOV 5 JALEN HURTS INJURY SCARE Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts had an injury scare at the end of the first half of Sunday's meeting with the Dallas Cowboys at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nHurts, who has been dealing with a bone bruise in his knee, took a hard hit to his lower body while standing in the pocket as the Eagles were driving with under a minute. He was in visible pain on the ground before limping off slowly.\n\nLuckily for Philly, he returned to the field to begin the third quarter. Still, there's no doubt that all Eagles fans were holding their breath.\n\nCameras caught him heading to the locker room right before halftime. He finished the first half 10 of 13 passing for 120 yards and one rushing touchdown.\n\nNOV. 2 JERRY JONES NERVOUS ABOUT SUNDAY SHOWDOWN IN PHILLY - Though his team is confident after consecutive wins over the Chargers and Rams, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said this week he realizes the difficulty his team faces Sunday against the Eagles in Philly.\n\n\"This is serious (bleep) that we're dealing with up here Sunday, man,\" Jones said during his weekly radio appearance on 105.3 The Fan. \"We've got to really have our game face on. We're playing the No. 1 team in the NFL in my view. We played San Francisco when they were No. 1, and got it handed to us.\"\n\nThe Eagles beat the Cowboys - with Cooper Rush playing quarterback - 26-17 at Lincoln Financial Field in October of last season on their way to the NFC East title and, eventually, the Super Bowl.\n\nOCT. 26 JERRY JONES ADMITS EAGLES' SUPERIORITY - Despite his team's 4-2 record and believing it is in the \"upper echelon\" of the NFL, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones admitted this week that Dallas currently \"doesn't belong on the same field\" with elite teams including the Eagles.\n\nThe Cowboys' humbling 42-10 beatdown in San Francisco Oct. 8 has apparently given Jones some perspective on his team's standing in the NFL power grid.\n\n\"We're in the upper echelon,\" he said. \"But to say we're right there with San Francisco or right there with the Eagles with how they've played ... I'm not going to go that far.\"\n\nThe Eagles host the Cowboys Nov. 5 at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nOCT 25 EAGLES WEDNESDAY INJURY REPORT The Philadelphia Eagles released their Wednesday injury report ahead of Sunday's road game against the Washington Commanders. Philly fans will be happy to see that it's much shorter than it's been in recent weeks, but most importantly, that quarterback Jalen Hurts isn't listed.\n\nHurts, who sported a knee brace in the second half of Sunday's 31-17 win over the Miami Dolphins, said after that the game that he'd be \"fine.\" That is now officially the case, as Hurts won't carry an injury designation headed into the NFC East meeting with Washington.\n\nThe Eagles are looking a lot healthier, as only three names are on the list this time around.\n\nCB Bradley Roby (shoulder) - DNP\n\nDT Milton Williams (heel) - LIMITED\n\nS Reed Blankenship (ribs) - FULL\n\nOCT 19 INTERNATIONAL FLAGS You'll see some changes to some NFL helmets around the league for Weeks 7 and 8. Hundreds of players will add flag decals to their helmets representing the countries of their heritage.\n\nThe league has announced more than 330 players have committed to participate, representing 72 nations, with Nigeria being the most-represented foreign country, with 80 players committing to wear the Nigerian flag.\n\nOCT 15 JALEN HURTS HIGHLIGHT Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is going viral for a highlight play he made during the first quarter of Sunday's game against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium.\n\nAfter avoiding a sack in the pocket, Hurts scrambled right and was chased down by Jets defensive back Michael Carter. But instead of throwing it away or being tripped up, Hurts hardly let Carter's presence bother him, stiff-arming him with ease while making an accurate throw to A.J. Brown for a 10-yard completion on 3rd and 8.\n\nMultiple big sports-themed accounts on X and many more reposted Hurts' highlight. Take a look:\n\nOCT 14 SAUCE OUT VS PHILLY New York Jets star second-year star cornerback Sauce Gardner has officially been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles at MetLife Stadium due to a concussion.\n\nGardner was listed on the end-of-week injury report as questionable against the Eagles, but it's clear the Jets didn't want to make him a game-time decision and instead ruled him out Saturday.\n\nGardner took to X to display his confusion with being ruled out.\n\n\"I feel perfectly fine. That's the crazy part about it,\" he wrote.\n\nThe 2022 Defensive Rookie of the Year will now miss the first game of his career. This season, he's posted 20 total tackles, one forced fumble and three passes defended.\n\nOCT 1 EAGLES VS COMMANDERS INACTIVES The Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Commanders have both revealed their inactives for Sunday's meeting at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nHere's who's out for the Eagles:\n\n- WR Quez Watkins\n\n- QB Tanner McKee\n\n- S Sydney Brown\n\n- RB Rashaad Penny\n\n- S Justin Evans\n\n- OL Tyler Steen\n\n- DT Moro Ojomo\n\nHere's who's out for the Commanders:\n\nRB Chris Rodriguez Jr.\n\nDE KJ Henry\n\nT Trent Scott\n\nG Chris Paul\n\nTE Curtis Hodges\n\nWR Mitchell Tinsley\n\nSEPT 28 EAGLES THURSDAY INJURY REPORT The Philadelphia Eagles have revealed their Thursday injury report ahead of Sunday's meeting with the Washington Commanders at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nEagles receiver DeVonta Smith sat out due to illness. Here's the complete report:\n\nS Sydney Brown (hamstring) - DNP\n\nS Justin Evans (neck) - DNP\n\nWR DeVonta Smith (illness) - DNP\n\nDT Fletcher Cox (knee) - Limited\n\nG Cam Jurgens (groin) - Limited\n\nWR Quez Watkins (hamstring) - Limited\n\nWR Britain Covey (hamstring) - FULL\n\nLB Zach Cunningham (ribs) - FULL\n\nG Landon Dickerson (knee) - FULL\n\nRB Boston Scott (concussion) - FULL\n\nSEPT 24 NFC EAST 0-3 SO FAR IN WEEK 3 The Philadelphia Eagles will go into Monday Night Football with a chance to claim first place in the NFC East.\n\nThe Washington Commanders and Dallas Cowboys both lost their games on Sunday and are now 2-1 while the New York Giants' lost to the San Francisco Giants on Thursday.\n\nThe Eagles play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday at 7:15 p.m.\n\nSEPT 19 TREY SERMON FINDS NEW HOME Former Philadelphia Eagles running back Trey Sermon has signed with the Indianapolis Colts practice squad, per an announcement from the team on Tuesday.\n\nSermon now becomes another former Eagle to join the Colts, as he'll potentially be called up to an offense that already features former Philly offensive coordinator Shane Steichen and former Eagles quarterback Gardner Minshew.\n\nSermon was cut by the Eagles during roster cutdowns last month. In 11 careers regular-season games, he's posted 43 carries for 186 yards and one touchdown.\n\nSEPT 17 NFC EAST SWEEPS WEEK 2 The Philadelphia Eagles are enjoying their Sunday off after a hard-fought win on Thursday night at home against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nHowever, the Eagles failed to build a lead in the NFC East as the Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants and Washington Commanders were all victorious on Sunday.\n\nThe Cowboys easily took care of the New York Jets in a 30-10 win.\n\nThe Giants came back after trailing by 21 points to beat the Arizona Cardinals in a 31-28 victory.\n\nThe Commanders also came back from a big deficit, trailing by 18, to beat the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Eagles are at Tampa Bay to face the undefeated Buccaneers next week on Monday Night Football, but then they will start their NFC East schedule in Week 4 when they host the Commanders.\n\nSEPT 12 RAMBO CUT The Philadelphia Eagles announced on Twitter Tuesday that they have waived second-year receiver Charleston Rambo from the injured reserve list.\n\nRambo, the former Oklahoma and Miami product, went undrafted in the 2022 NFL Draft before signing with the Carolina Panthers and spending last season on their practice squad.\n\nFrom there, Rambo was drafted into the XFL by Orlando Guardians, where he played nine games this past spring, totaling 403 yards and three touchdowns on 31 receptions before he signed with the Eagles in May.\n\nSEPT 11 DEAN HURT The Eagles got their 25-20 win at the Patriots in Week 1, but an injury sustained by Eagles linebacker Nakobe Dean figures to be a problem. Our Ed Kracz reported that Dean left the locker room wearing a boot and that Nakobe, said mentioned that the trainers didn’t want him walking on the foot.\n\nAnd now the bad news: NFL Network reports Dean is likely to \"miss multiple'' weeks with the injury ... but that \"he should be back with plenty of time this season.'' No surgery is apparently required ... but this is nevertheless a blow to the Philly defense.\n\nSEPT 9 EAGLES MAKE CALL-UPS The Philadelphia Eagles have called up punter Arryn Siposs and receiver/returner Britain Covey from the practice squad on Saturday ahead of Sunday's opener against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium, per reports from Aaron Wilson of KPRC2.\n\nThe Eagles cut both players while finalizing the 53-man roster, but have yet to sign a punter to replace Siposs. Philadelphia could add a punter at a later date, but will be going with Siposs to begin the season against the Patriots.\n\nThe Eagles and Pats kickoff from Gillette at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday.\n\nSEPT 4 FOUR MOVES Proving that there is really no such thing as a “final roster,” the Eagles on Monday announced a quartet of practice-squad moves.\n\nOn the way in? Philly is signing linebacker Nicholas Morrow and offensive lineman Tyre Phillips.\n\nAnd on the way out? The Eagles are releasing cornerback Tiawan Mullen and linebacker Kyron Johnson\n\nAUG 25 EAGLES' RIVAL COWBOYS TRADE FOR QB HELP - In a shocking move on Friday evening, the Dallas Cowboys have traded for San Francisco 49ers quarterback Trey Lance, as first reported by ESPN's Adam Schefter. In exchange for the former first-round pick, the Cowboys will give up a 2024 fourth-round pick. .\n\nLance, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, started in just four games for the Niners in his two seasons in the Bay Area, where he completed 54.9 percent of his passes for 797 yards with five touchdowns and three interceptions in the eight games he played in.\n\nAfter missing all but two games last season due to an ankle injury, Lance fell behind Brock Purdy and Sam Darnold on the depth chart in San Francisco prior to being traded to the Cowboys, where he'll presumably have the opportunity to serve as a backup to Dak Prescott.\n\nAUG 24 EAGLES' RIVAL GIANTS MAKE TRADE - The New York Giants have traded a seventh-round pick to the Arizona Cardinals in exchange for former first-round linebacker/safety Isaiah Simmons, per reports Thursday from ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nSimmons, who was set to make a transition to the secondary this season in Arizona, was selected with the No. 8 overall pick by the Cardinals in 2020 out of Clemson.\n\nIn 50 career games, he's posted 258 total tackles, 7.5 sacks, seven forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries, four interceptions, 16 passes defended, and one touchdown.\n\nAUG 18 ONE MORE RIDE FOR PETERS?\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Schefter, veteran offensive tackle Jason Peters is hopeful to play in 2023.\n\nA nine-time Pro Bowler, Peters was named to the Hall of Fame's All-2010s team and has likely already secured his place in Canton. Now 41 years old, it's a bit remarkable that that the 18-year veteran is looking to suit up for another season.\n\nPeters spent the first five years of his career with the Buffalo Bills, but will be most remembered for his 11 years as the pillar of the Philadelphia Eagles offensive line. He was an All-Pro with the Eagles in both 2011 and 2013. After spending 2021 with the Chicago Bears, Peters appeared in 10 games for the Cowboys in 2022, starting one.\n\nAUG 17 REDDICK UNDERGOING SURGERY As reported on Wednesday by Eagles Today, the Philadelphia Eagles will be without their star edge rusher Haason Reddick due to a thumb injury.\n\nBut despite there never being a doubt about his odds of making it back for the start of the regular season, a new report from NFL.com's Ian Rapoport confirms that Reddick will undergo surgery in order to make it back in time for the Eagles' regular-season opener against the New England Patriots on Sunday, Sept. 10.\n\nWhile the Eagles would love to have their 28-year-old pass-rusher healthy and participating in the lead-up to facing the Patriots, his injury will give the coaching staff extra time to work with rookie first-round pick Nolan Smith.\n\nSmith, the No. 30 overall pick in this year's NFL Draft out of the University of Georgia, has drawn comparisons to Reddick because of their speed and power off the edge combined with both being considered undersized pass-rushers.\n\nAUG 16 REDDICK OUT? The Eagles are going to be without Haason Reddick for a time after he suffered a thumb injury. Via our John McMullen on Tuesday: \"Philadelphia is adding star edge rusher Reddick to their injury list with a thumb issue. The All-Pro edge rusher is going to miss significant time for the rest of the summer as the Eagles play it cautious, but the team does not expect Reddick to miss any regular season action.\n\nReddick, including the playoffs last year, totaled 19.5 sacks. ... and he will now be saved for the games that matter, with Nolan Smith - \"Baby Haason'' likely to get more reps in his spot.\n\nAUG 12 RICKS PRESEASON PICK-SIX The Philadelphia Eagles needed a spark in the second half of Saturday's preseason opener against the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium after failing to put up any points since the second quarter.\n\nLuckily, undrafted rookie cornerback Eli Ricks came out of nowhere to provide that momentum. He picked off Ravens quarterback Anthony Brown and returned it back 31 yards to cut Baltimore's lead to 20-19 in the fourth quarter.\n\nAUG 8 EAGLES RELEASE ROOKIE OL: The Eagles made a roster move Monday, releasing rookie free-agent offensive lineman Trevor Reid. A standout at Louisville, Reid turned heads at the NFL Scouting Combine with a broad jump and vertical leap that were No. 1 among offensive linemen. That athleticism, however, didn't transfer to the practice field. Reid's camp contract was $110,000 guaranteed.\n\nAUG 4 SILLS CLEARED A jury acquitted Philadelphia Eagles offensive guard Josh Sills of raping and kidnapping a former high school classmate in 2019.\n\nJurors started deliberating shortly after noon on Friday and returned the verdict nearly three hours later at 2:45 p.m.\n\n“I have done nothing wrong,” Sills said in court after thanking the jury for its decision.\n\nThe not-guilty verdict came after Sills’ attorney terms the accuser “the girl who cries wolf.”\n\nSills was indicted on both first-degree felony charges on Feb. 1, 2023 - right before the Eagles headed to Arizona to play the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Eagles announced Friday that Sills has been removed from the NFL's Commissioner's Exempt List and will return to the active roster.\n\nJULY 24 GARDNER-JOHNSON DOWN Veteran defensive back C.J. Gardner-Johnson, the former Eagles standout, went down with a right leg injury during Monday's training camp with his new team the Detroit Lions and was carted off the field.\n\nReporters on the scene labeled him \"visibly upset,'' and noted that Lions team captains, including QB Jared Goff, spent time with C.J. in an effort to comfort him.\n\nGardner-Johnson recently made some controversial and NSFW remarks about Philadelphia fans being his \"least favorite thing'' about his Eagles experience, calling \"the people ... obnoxious.''\n\nJULY 20 SNYDER OUT The Eagles have enjoyed some prosperity thanks to the leadership of Dan Snyder. But now, finally, the Washington Commanders have been sold.\n\nThe Commanders' sale to Josh Harris - owner of the Sixers - is for an NFL-record $6.05 billion. It was unanimously approved by the other NFL owners.\n\nThe move comes after years of vitriol and controversy from Snyder, who was then pressured to sell the team after scandals in recent years. … and who is ordered by the NFL to pay a $60 million fine for those misdeeds.\n\nJULY 3 JORDAN MAILATA SINGS AT HIS OWN WEDDING - Jordan Mailata has already proven he's a real keeper, as the Philadelphia Eagles offensive tackle and former seventh-round pick signed a life-changing four-year, $64 million deal in 2021 that was seemingly a stroke of good luck for someone that is still relatively new to the game of football.\n\nHis life changed in even more ways over the weekend, as his newly-wed wife might be just as lucky.\n\nMailata just got married on Saturday, and showed that he's more than just a elite protector of quarterback Jalen Hurts, who was in attendance. Mailata stole the show with an impressive singing performance of Stevie Wonder's \"Isn't She Lovely\" as his bride took the dance floor for what we presume was the dad-daughter dance.\n\nTake a look:\n\nThis isn't the first time he's showed off the musical lungs, as Mailata has previously competed on FOX's The Masked Singer last year.\n\nMailata is now a certified keeper for more reasons than one. Who on the Eagles would dare to challenge him to a singing competition?\n\nJUNE 28 EAGLES TRAINING CAMP DATES: The Philadelphia Eagles will be one of seven teams to have both veterans and rookies report for training camp on the same day, as the league announced that Philly will begin its training camp festivities on Tuesday, July 25.\n\nThe Eagles will hold camp at the NovaCare Complex and will have an open practice for fans to attend on Sunday, Aug. 6 at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nJUNE 23 FORMER EAGLE CARSON WENTZ TAKES DOWN A BEAR\n\nFormer Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz has some free time on his hands this offseason since he remains a free agent. He's making the most of it by exploring nature and the hunting scene, but is facing some fan criticism as a result.\n\nWentz posted a photo of himself posing next to a black bear that he killed with a bow and arrow during a trip to the Alaskan wilderness, which sparked some passionate comments.\n\n\"Bucket list!'' Wentz wrote on social media. \"Got the opportunity to spot and stalk black bear in one of our new favorite places on earth - Alaska! Incredible trip and an incredible animal!''\n\nDespite the legality of his actions, some fans - as chronicled by our partners at TheSpun - are upset to see that Wentz had killed the animal.\n\n\"Bringing death on defenseless animal living it’s life,\" one commenter said on Instagram.\n\n\"Incredible animal so you kill it?? Makes sense,\" another commenter said.\n\n\"Wow not just a terrible QB but also a horrible human,\" one commenter said. \"Hunting is not a sport, just because you failed in football doesn’t mean go kill a bear.\"\n\nWentz, the No. 2 overall pick by the Eagles in 2016, continues to try and \"hunt\" down his next opportunity in the NFL.\n\n***\n\nWant the latest in breaking news and insider information on the Philadelphia Eagles?
