        "text": "The Miami Dolphins brought back a familiar name to their practice squad and added some needed depth in the secondary. They signed defensive back Jamal Perry on Tuesday, according to his agent, David Canter, and as the team later announced.\n\nPerry was last seen when he suffered a knee injury in Miami’s win at the New York Jets in November 2021, causing him to go on injured reserve. It was a torn anterior cruciate ligament, according to Canter, and Perry was not with a team in training camp ahead of this season, still recovering.\n\nPerry has played in 31 games with seven starts while also contributing on special teams over the past three seasons with the Dolphins, seeing most of his action in 2019 and 2020. He totaled 86 tackles with seven pass deflections and an interception in 2019, when he went by Jomal Wiltz before a March 2020 name change.\n\nAhead of the 2021 season, Perry was waived by the Dolphins when the team claimed fellow defensive back and special teamer Elijah Campbell off waivers from the Jets. Perry then signed to the Dolphins practice squad and played in four games in 2021, first as a practice-squad elevation multiple times before he was signed to Miami’s active roster days before his season-ending injury at MetLife Stadium.\n\nPerry initially entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent from Iowa State in 2017 with the Philadelphia Eagles but did not make the team. Before landing with the Dolphins, he spent time on the New England Patriots’ practice squad in 2017 and 2018. There, he worked with former Dolphins coach Brian Flores and current Dolphins defensive coordinator Josh Boyer before reuniting with them in Miami.\n\nThe Dolphins have been devastated by injuries in the secondary. In Sunday’s win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, safety Brandon Jones went down. He was expected to go on injured reserve. A week earlier, cornerback Nik Needham’s Achilles tear ended his season. Miami also has cornerbacks Kader Kohou (oblique) and Keion Crossen (knee) working to return after missing last Sunday’s game, and Byron Jones has not yet begun practicing after starting the season on the physically-unable-to-perform list due to offseason lower left leg surgery.\n\nBrandon Jones was officially placed on IR on Tuesday, as coach Mike McDaniel said he expected on Monday.\n\nThe Dolphins also signed wide receiver Calvin Jackson to the practice squad Tuesday while placing fellow wideout Freddie Swain, a former Florida Gator, on the practice squad’s injured list.\n\nJackson is the son of the former Dolphins safety by the same name, who played in 75 games with 57 starts from 1994 to 1999. The younger Jackson is a Fort Lauderdale native who played high school football at Coral Springs Charter. He’s an undrafted rookie out of Washington State who spent the offseason program and training camp with the Jets.\n\n()"
