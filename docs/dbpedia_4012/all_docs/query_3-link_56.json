        "text": "AdThe 26-year-old Godchaux gets $16 million for two years, with $9 million guaranteed. His three-year deal with the Browns reportedly is valued at $33.75 million, with $24 million guaranteed. He has been a rare steady performer on a weak defense in Detroit and got a three-year deal. Ad— Jacksonville added Bears defensive lineman Roy Robertson-Harris with a three-year, $24.4 million deal that includes $14 million guaranteed. Elflein received a three-year, $13.5 million deal with $6 million guaranteed, while Erving agreed to a two-year, $10 million contract with $8 million guaranteed.\n\nDetroit Lions interim head coach Robert Prince on the sidelines during the second half of an NFL football game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Saturday, Dec. 26, 2020, in Detroit. On the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' first possession, they faced third-and-9 from their 19. Chase Daniel completed 13 of 18 passes, but for only 86 yards and never got the Lions past midfield. After a touchback on the kickoff to start the half, Lions running back D'Andre Swift fumbled on first down. That wasn't much fun.”The Lions allowed 588 yards, the second-highest total in team history and the highest in a regulation game.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady (12) throws during the first half of an NFL football game against the Detroit Lions, Saturday, Dec. 26, 2020, in Detroit. The Bucs (10-5) set a franchise record with 588 yards and snapped the NFL’s second-longest postseason drought behind Cleveland’s 18-year run that can end Sunday. RECORD WATCHBrady has thrown a franchise-record 36 touchdowns and set a personal record with 348 yards passing by halftime. Tampa Bay set team records in points (34) and yards (410) in the first half. Lions: Stafford left the game with an ankle injury after he was 2 of 3 for 17 yards on his only possession.\n\nDETROIT – The Detroit Lions announced Monday the team fired special teams coordinator Brayden Coombs. The Detroit Lions announced today that Brayden Coombs has been relieved of his duties as Special Teams Coordinator. — Detroit Lions (@Lions) December 21, 2020Coombs joined the Lions this year. General manager Bob Quinn and coach Matt Patricia were fired after the Thanksgiving game loss. Reports: Lions to interview Thomas Dimitroff, Louis Riddick for GM jobMore: Detroit Lions news\n\nThe Detroit Lions will hold out hope as long as they can that Matthew Stafford can play at Tennessee with banged-up ribs. Stafford stayed in the game to hand off to Kerryon Johnson for a touchdown on the next play, but was evaluated by the team's medical staff on the sideline. Stafford went toward the locker room, returned to throw passes near the benches before going back out of sight. “That guy loves to play football and it’s going to take a lot to keep him out,\" Bevell said. STOCK UPThe Lions have missed on a lot of draft picks, but T.J. Hockenson is not one of them.\n\nThe NFC East-leading Philadelphia Eagles have gotten healthier on offense in time for another division game. Wide receiver Alshon Jeffery is back in Philadelphia’s lineup against the New York Giants, his first action since foot surgery last year. Running back Miles Sanders, the Eagles' leading rusher, is also back after missing three games with a knee injury. Okung will miss his fifth game this season because of injury, so Dennis Daley starts, protecting Teddy Bridgewater’s blindside. The Buccaneers are playing without left guard Ali Marpet, who will miss his second consecutive game with a concussion.\n\nIndianapolis Colts quarterback Philip Rivers (17) throws during the first half of an NFL football game against the Detroit Lions, Sunday, Nov. 1, 2020, in Detroit. Rivers threw three touchdown passes in the second quarter to help the Colts surge past Detroit for a 41-21 victory Sunday following a first quarter in which they averaged a little more than 1 yard rushing on 10 carries. Rivers threw passes to 11 teammates. Hines had so much energy he celebrated each of his two touchdowns in the second quarter with moves that would make a gymnast proud, pulling off roundoffs into full twists in the end zone. Three plays later, Rivers threw a 7-yard, tiebreaking touchdown pass to Jack Doyle.\n\nDETROIT – The Detroit Lions are 0-2 after two bad losses to start the season. Comparing the first two games of this year to last season show Stafford’s stats have dropped off. The Lions are still running deeper patterns, Stafford just isn’t throwing the ball deep as much as last year. Finally, Jamal Agnew lost the Lions 20 yards of field position when he committed a personal foul on a punt return. Getting rid of those mistakes is a good start to helping the Lions try to avoid starting 0-3 this year.\n\nJamal Agnew #39 of the Lions celebrates is 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown with teammates Miles Killebrew #35 and Mike Ford #38.
