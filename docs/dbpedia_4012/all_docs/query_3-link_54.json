        "text": "by Brandon Langlois, Associate Director/Communications\n\nSTARKVILLE – On Friday, The Associated Press revealed its 2018 NFL All-Pro teams, and Mississippi State was well-represented.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles interior defensive lineman Fletcher Cox was named to the first team and Kansas City Chiefs defensive end Chris Jones, meanwhile, earned a spot on the second team. The honor is a first for Jones, while it is Cox's fourth straight season on the team but only time on the first team.\n\nThe AP NFL All-Pro team is based on voting from a nationwide panel of 50 media members.\n\nCox eclipsed double-digit sacks for the first time with a career-best 10.5 in 2018 to lead the Eagles. He also had 12 tackles for loss, his most since 2015, and 74 combined quarterback pressures and hits, nearly as many as the past three seasons combined (87). He was named to the NFC's Pro Bowl squad for the fourth time in his seven seasons with the Eagles. After a three-sack effort in Sunday's win over Washington, Cox was named the NFC Defensive Player of the Week on Wednesday.\n\nIt was a breakout season for Jones, a third-year lineman who totaled the third-most sacks in the NFL (15.5). Only fellow All-Pro selections J.J. Watt and Von Miller got after the quarterback more than Jones, who tallied a sack in an NFL-record 11-straight games from early October until late December. Jones also returned an interception for a touchdown and forced a pair of fumbles.\n\nCox is the third-highest graded defender in the NFL (92.6) according to Pro Football Focus, while Jones' grade of 90.5 is tied for 16th. Cox (29) and Jones (24) finished first and third, respectively, in the league in total pressures over the final four weeks of the season.\n\nBoth Cox and Jones were All-Americans at MSU. During Cox's three-year college career, he finished with 114 tackles (53 solo), 24.5 TFL and 8.5 sacks in 36 games (27 starts) and also blocked five field-goal attempts. Jones played in 39 games with 16 starts during his time with the Bulldogs. He totaled 102 tackles, 18 tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks in his three-year career.\n\nFor more information on the Bulldogs, follow the MSU football team on Twitter, like them on Facebook and join them on Instagram by searching for \"HailStateFB.\"\n\nThe full list of first- and second-team selections is below.\n\nFIRST TEAM\n\nOFFENSE\n\nQuarterback: Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs\n\nRunning Back: Todd Gurley, Los Angeles Rams\n\nFlex: Tyreek Hill, Kansas City Chiefs\n\nTight End: Travis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs\n\nWide Receivers: Michael Thomas, New Orleans Saints; DeAndre Hopkins, Houston Texans\n\nLeft Tackle: David Bakhtiari, Green Bay Packers\n\nRight Tackle: Mitchell Schwartz, Kansas City Chiefs\n\nLeft Guard: Quenton Nelson, Indianapolis Colts\n\nRight Guard: Zack Martin, Dallas Cowboys\n\nCenter: Jason Kelce, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nDEFENSE\n\nEdge Rushers: J.J.
