        "text": "• Miles Sanders: 27 carries, 134 yards, 2 touchdowns, 2 receptions, 22 receiving yards\n\n• Jamal Agnew: 4 receptions, 50 yards, 2 touchdowns\n\n• For all fantasy football game recaps from Week 4, click here.\n\nClick to jump to a fantasy football game recap:\n\nMIA@CIN | MIN@NO | CLE@ATL | BUF@BAL | SEA@DET\n\nLAC@HOU | TEN@IND | CHI@NYG | JAX@PHI | NYJ@PIT | ARZ@CAR\n\nDEN@LVR | KC@TB |\n\nJamal Agnew’s big game: Zay Jones was inactive, leading to Agnew putting up his best numbers of the season.\n\nJones showed up on the injury report on Thursday with an ankle injury. He was questionable heading into the game but was made inactive.\n\nMarvin Jones Jr. moved up to second on the depth chart. Jacksonville has largely stayed in 11 personnel this season, so there wasn’t a huge difference for his playing time.\n\nTim Jones and Agnew split snaps in the third spot. Jones saw more playing time largely from run plays, while Agnew ran more routes and saw significantly more targets.\n\nAgnew can be left on the waiver wire, as his playing time wasn’t enough to make him a reliable fantasy starter, even if Zay Jones misses more time.\n\nDrop Kenneth Gainwell: Gainwell may have scored a touchdown, but he wasn’t used nearly enough despite Boston Scott missing this game.\n\nScott missed the game with a ribs injury. He didn’t practice all week and could miss additional time.\n\nGainwell’s playing time actually went down rather than up, partially because Miles Sanders was playing so well.\n\nHe only ran five times in a game where the Eagles ran 47 times, which isn’t nearly enough considering another back was injured.\n\nThe Eagles opted to give Trey Sermon some plays on early downs rather than increase Gainwell’s playing time in those situations. Scott had consistently played more on early downs than Gainwell.\n\nHe continued to be used on third downs and likely would have been their two-minute drill back had they been in that situation.\n\nHis playing time would likely increase if Sanders were to get hurt, but it seems like he would at best split early-down work unless both Sanders and Scott are injured."
