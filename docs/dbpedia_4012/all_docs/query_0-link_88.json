        "text": "Every NFL team can longingly look through its draft history and wonder what could've been. The Cowboys are no exception. Since the turn of the century, Jerry Jones & Co. have made some draft-day decisions likely to leave Cowboys fans slapping their foreheads in hindsight.\n\nHere's a look at the Cowboys' 10 biggest draft blunders since 2000:\n\n2008: Felix Jones over Chris Johnson\n\nIn '08, the Cowboys wanted a running back to complement Marion Barber's bruising style, so they used the 22nd overall pick on Arkansas' Felix Jones. But Johnson, who flew up draft boards after a blistering performance at the NFL Combine, went two picks later to Tennessee.\n\nJohnson eclipsed 1,000 yards in each of his six seasons, even reaching the 2,000-yard plateau and taking home the rushing title with the Titans in 2009. He has 9,651 career rushing yards and 55 career rushing touchdowns plus another nine in the air.\n\nJones had just 2,728 career yards in five years with the Cowboys, and has never topped 800 yards in a season. He had 184 yards and no touchdowns in his last season, 2013, with the Steelers.\n\n2004: Bruce Thornton over Jared Allen\n\nAfter going offensive with their first three picks, the Cowboys finally addressed the defense by taking Thornton, a CB out of Georgia, in the fourth round. But Thornton made just one appearance with the Cowboys and lasted only two years in the NFL.\n\nThe Vikings snagged Allen five picks later, while the Cowboys, who were still playing in a 4-3 base defense at the time, stuck with a 29-year-old Greg Ellis and a 30-year-old Marcellus Wiley as their DEs.\n\nAllen went on to rack up 136 career sacks in 12 season, 11th best ever. He was named to five Pro Bowls, receiving All-Pro honors four of those years.\n\n2006: Bobby Carpenter over Tamba Hali\n\nLinebacker Bobby Carpenter, the 18th overall pick in 2006, might qualify as the worst of the Cowboys' first-round picks in this century. He was ill-equipped to play inside as planned and made only three starts in four years with the Cowboys.\n\nHali went to Kansas City two picks later. His career? Well, he started at least 14 games for 10 consecutive seasons with the Chiefs, racking up 89.5 sacks in his career since 2010 and earning five straight Pro Bowl trips from 2011-15.\n\n2001: Tony Dixon over Adrian Wilson\n\nThe 2001 draft might go down as one of the worst in Cowboys history.\n\nMost remember the infamous Quincy Carter pick at No. 53, but fewer remember that Alabama S Tony Dixon came to the Cowboys just three picks later. Dixon made 15 starts in four seasons with the Cowboys before being shown the door.\n\nThe next safety came off the board just eight picks later when the Cardinals took Adrian Wilson, who went on to become a cornerstone of the Arizona defense for 12 years. He had nearly 900 career tackles, five Pro Bowl appearances, and played in at least 14 games in 10 of his 12 seasons.\n\n2007: James Marten over Marshal Yanda\n\nLooking to add depth to their O-line, the Cowboys picked tackle James Marten from Boston College with the 67th overall pick in '07. He never appeared in a game with the Cowboys, and made all of one appearance in five years before retiring.\n\nLater in the third round, Baltimore took Iowa tackle Marshal Yanda No. 86 overall. The Ravens moved Yanda inside to guard, where he became one of the NFL's best. Yanda was a stalwart on the Baltimore line and notched six straight Pro Bowl berths.\n\n2008: Martellus Bennett over Jamaal Charles\n\nIn 2008, the Cowboys wanted more weapons to plug into then-OC Jason Garrett's gameplan. With the 61st pick, the Cowboys opted for Bennett, who never had more than 283 receiving yards in a season with Dallas and didn't account for a touchdown in his final three as a Cowboy.\n\nTwelve picks later, the Chiefs landed Charles, a four-time Pro Bowl running back who's rushed for 7,556 yards and 44 touchdowns in his career.\n\nAnd while we could point out that the Cowboys had already picked a RB in this draft (Felix Jones in the first), Dallas used the pick after Bennett on another back -- Tashard Choice -- so Charles doesn't seem like a ridiculous choice.\n\n2006: Anthony Fasano over Devin Hester\n\nFasano, No. 53 overall, was a Bill Parcells pick all the way. He was supposed to fill a substantial role as an H-back, but Fasano made all of 28 catches in two years before the Cowboys shipped him to Miami.\n\nHester, who went just four picks later to the Bears, was the most electric return man in NFL history and has had an underrated career as a receiver, too.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the Cowboys tried to draft a kick returner two rounds later -- LSU's Skyler Green -- but he didn't even make the active roster until October and was cut under two months after the promotion.\n\n2003: Terence Newman over Troy Polamalu\n\nA bowl-game hamstring injury may have scared teams off Polamalu, who went to Pittsburgh in the first round with the 16th overall pick. The Cowboys passed early, taking cornerback Terence Newman with the fifth choice. It's hard to knock Newman's performance with the Cowboys, but Polamalu was an eight-time Pro Bowler, the 2010 Defensive Player of the Year and a member of the NFL's 2000s All-Decade Team.\n\n2006: Skyler Green over Elvis Dumervil\n\nThe Cowboys took Green out of LSU 125th overall, hoping he could be a deep threat at receiver and a star as a kick returner. Dumervil, who was tremendously productive in college but was thought to be undersized, went to Denver with the very next pick. He's accrued 105.5 sacks since joining the league in 2006 -- the fourth-most in the NFL over that span -- while Green couldn't even make the Cowboys' roster at preseason's end.\n\n2009: Robert Brewster over Louis Vasquez\n\nThe 2009 draft has had more misses than hits for the Cowboys. The choice of OT Robert Brewster (75th overall) typifies this draft. Brewster made one appearance in two years before he was cut. San Diego used the 78th pick on guard Louis Vasquez, of Corsicana. He started 101 of 102 games he was healthy in seven seasons, including 15 of 16 in the Bronco' 2015 Super Bowl year. Vasquez allowed just 15.5 sacks in the 102 career games."
