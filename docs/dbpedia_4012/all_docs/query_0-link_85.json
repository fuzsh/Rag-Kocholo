        "text": "Let’s get to the Philadelphia Eagles links ...\n\nWhy Chris Long says he’d want to officially retire as a Philadelphia Eagle - NBCSP\n\nCHRIS: Honestly I would’ve retired a Ram, but they moved to L.A. I’m not an L.A. Ram. I’m a St. Louis Ram, and to be honest, the team that I most associate with now? Boston, I was there for a year, I loved a lot about that, but I didn’t live in the city, I wasn’t a big part of the community there. Fans were super supportive. But I didn’t get to know them the way I knew them in Philly. And a lot of that was geography, putting my head down, I was there for one reason. In Philly, it was like the city just got a hold of me. So if I ever do the official retirement, something, I’ll probably do it as an Eagle. But then I might just want to go back to St. Louis, pick my favorite dive bar, and retire as a St. Louis Ram.\n\nWhat can the Eagles expect out of Sidney Jones in 2020? - BGN\n\nAs the Eagles seek to return to Super Bowl form following two underwhelming seasons, it’s no secret that massive improvements in the secondary will be necessary. Among the stats that could be used to make the Philadelphia secondary look bad, the Eagles allowed seven passing touchdowns of 50+ yards in 2019 (incl. playoffs), while no other team in the NFL gave up more than three. Phrased most simply by Howie Roseman in March 2020, “It’s hard when you’re watching games and the ball is getting thrown over your head.” The Eagles’ moves to address their Achilles’ heel have been well-documented. But no matter how well the Darius Slay acquisition pans out, the Eagles will need both starting outside cornerbacks to surpass last season’s level of production to return to title contention. Thus begs the question that fans and media alike in Philadelphia have been asking for years: is there hope for Sidney Jones?\n\nThe Best of The Kist & Solak Show Recaps: 2019 Week 17-WC - BGN Radio\n\nRelive the 2019 Eagles season with Michael Kist & Benjamin Solak in this compilation of the best breakdowns & moments with the 5th installation covering Weeks 17 & the Wild Card Round! Powered by SB Nation and Bleeding Green Nation.\n\n10 reasons the Giants will be a dumpster fire this season - PhillyVoice\n\nForget the fact that he drafted a running back second overall. That’s the least of his transgressions. Gettleman hasn’t even been the general manager for 30 months yet, and the amount of money that he has flushed down the toilet on players who were either not worth their pay, or old (and thus useless for a rebuilding team) is unreal. Eli Manning. Nate Solder. Jonathan Stewart. Golden Tate. Patrick Omameh. Alec Ogletree. Antoine Bethea. And coming soon, Leonard Williams and Blake Martinez. And then the dead money he was willing to take on when trading guys like Odell Beckham, Olivier Vernon, and Jason Pierre-Paul. I could go on.\n\nMake It Count - Iggles Blitz\n\nDallas has had a star QB and star RB duo for the past four years. Dak Prescott has started 64 straight games, while Zeke Elliott has started 56 games in that span. We can debate how good Prescott is, but there shouldn’t be any doubt that he’s an above average player who has some great moments. That duo combined with Amari Cooper, Jaylon Smith, a very good OL, DeMarcus Lawrence, Byron Jones and some other talented players to win two division titles and one playoff game (Wild Card round at that). Talk about a waste of talent. How on earth did Jason Garrett keep his job that long? Think about the Eagles from back in the Reid era. They had a star QB in Donovan McNabb and a star RB in Brian Westbrook. Unfortunately those two guys had trouble staying healthy at the same time.\n\nA six-pack of Eagles news, notes, and this and that - PE.com\n\nJosh Sweat. Shareef Miller. Daeshon Hall. Genard Avery. Joe Ostman. Casey Toohill. Those are the defensive ends on the current roster slated to back up starters Brandon Graham and Derek Barnett. Is there enough depth here? In 2017, the Eagles’ defensive ends contributed 23.5 quarterback sacks in the Super Bowl-winning season. In 2018, the total was 22 quarterback sacks. Last year, the number was 25 sacks. Vinny Curry contributed five sacks mostly in a reserve role. Sweat made a nice jump in his second season with four sacks. There is some good talent here. The Eagles need this young group to take a leap. They need Sweat to continue to develop. They need production from Miller. They need to find a role for Avery. They need to see if what Ostman, who is coming off a knee injury, showed in Training Camp last year is real. They need to get Hall, also rehabbing a knee injury, healthy and stronger.\n\nRanking how all 32 NFL teams draft quarterbacks, from Tom Brady’s Patriots to Brady Quinn’s Browns - ESPN+\n\n17. Philadelphia Eagles. And we’re into the negatives. Every franchise from here on out drafted quarterbacks who, in sum, did not reach the collective value of their draft picks. Donovan McNabb and Cunningham’s weighted career AV were actually identical, but because the latter was a second-round pick and the former was a second overall pick, Cunningham was the clear superior value. Carson Wentz, also a No. 2 overall pick, has been a slight positive value over expectation but actually trails Nick Foles in that department. Reaves started seven games for the Eagles, all in 1972. Philadelphia lost all seven games. He went on to pick up a handful of career wins with other franchises.\n\nEagles, Cowboys among top trade fits for N.Y. Jets’ Jamal Adams - NFL.com\n\n1) General manager Howie Roseman — who employed Jets GM Joe Douglas as his vice president of player personnel for three seasons — isn’t afraid to make bold moves, and the Eagles could use safety help. Malcolm Jenkins left in free agency, leaving converted corner Jalen Mills, veteran free agent Will Parks and fourth-round pick K’Von Wallace to attempt to fill his shoes. Adding Adams to a secondary that upgraded at corner via the trade for Darius Slay would take Philadelphia to another level. The only caveat is that salary cap considerations could make this one tough to pull off.\n\nWhich Team Is the Best Fit for Jamal Adams? - The Ringer\n\nThe Eagles need Adams as much as any team on this list except Dallas, their main competition for the NFC East title. This offseason the Eagles front office ousted safety Malcolm Jenkins, who led the team in tackles for five of the past six seasons. Rather than replacing Jenkins, the team traded a third-rounder for Lions cornerback Darius Slay, made him the league’s highest-paid cornerback, and planned to move cornerback Jalen Mills to safety. But adding Slay while losing Jenkins doesn’t change the fact that Philadelphia has lacked secondary depth for the last three seasons, including during their title run, when New England accrued a Super Bowl record 613 yards and did not punt. Adams would fit well in defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz’s system as a versatile chess piece that can play in multiple spots, which is something the Eagles desperately need.\n\nWhat Dak Prescott signing his franchise tag could have to do with a Jamal Adams trade - Blogging The Boys\n\nThis situation has reached just about the 10th hour and Dak Prescott has obviously been very patient which again brings up the question of why he would sign the franchise tag now. Up until this news broke all that had been going on with the Cowboys was speculation about them potentially trading for safety Jamal Adams, but many people dismissed that possibility as they feel like it is not financially possible given the constraints that the team is facing with their other contracts. What if the Cowboys had less money tied up and therefore more room to go out and acquire Jamal Adams (and hand him his own big-time deal in the aftermath)? That’s what Yahoo’s Charles Robinson tossed out as one possible explanation for Dak signing his tag now.\n\nDak Prescott Just Called Jerry Jones’ Bluff, Because He Holds All the Cards - B/R\n\nWhat’s remarkable is that the normally shrewd Jones doesn’t realize he has spent the last year being rope-a-doped. He has stuck to a five-year contract since last summer, mostly because the free-spending Cowboys need to prorate each signing bonus and guarantee over as many years as possible so they can afford to pay the next signing bonus and guarantee. Players, particularly quarterbacks, prefer shorter contracts because they allow them to renegotiate whenever their market value goes up, which is always. If Jones had just capitulated and agreed to a four-year contract last summer, he’d have already paid Prescott a chunk of money and stuffed some of the cap hit into the 2019 budget. Instead, he’ll write a $31.4 million check to Prescott and get no benefits from it beyond one year of the quarterback’s services and the privilege of doing the same thing next year. If the Cowboys eventually get their five-year, cap-friendly contract, it will only come after multiple one-year, cap-unfriendly contracts, which of course defeats the whole purpose.\n\nWho are the best and worst head coaches in the NFC East in 2020? - Hogs Haven\n\nPederson’s four-year head coaching career has been mixed, with records of 7-9, 13-3, 9-7, 9-7 finishing 4th, 1st, 2nd and 1st in the division, but winning a super bowl in 2017, and going 1-2 in the playoffs since. So far, his tenure has seen more success than failure, but for Philly fans, the incredible 2017 championship season is starting to fade into the distance in the rearview mirror. Looking ahead to 2020, Pederson appears to be facing the challenge of accomplishing a lot with probably the weakest roster he has had to start a season in his tenure. Now that Carson Wentz is no longer on a rookie contract, Howie Roseman’s “quarterback factory” is approaching a crossroads, and a poor season from Philly in a weak division could see fans begin to get restless. If Pederson can muster the troops to another division title, however, he may set himself up for an Andy Reid-like tenure with the Eagles, as the owner has shown a propensity to reward success with loyalty.\n\nGiants hope Dion Lewis gives them capable caddy for Saquon Barkley - Big Blue View\n\nSaquon Barkley is, arguably, the best running back on the planet. Even Superman, though, sometimes needs backup — as the New York Giants found out all too well a season ago. Problem is, the Giants have not had a backup they seemed to truly feel comfortable with during Barkley’s two seasons. Jonathan Stewart got hurt, and seemingly had nothing left in the tank, anyway. Wayne Gallman never really seemed to have the full confidence of the coaching staff. Jon Hilliman couldn’t capitalize on his opportunity. Buck Allen got signed too late and sat too much to have any real chance to help. Can veteran Dion Lewis, signed to a one-year deal this offseason, caddy for Barkley in a reliable way no one has yet been able to? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nFauci: Coronavirus vaccine could be available by end of 2020 - Vox\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told Congress Tuesday that he’s “cautiously optimistic” about the development of a coronavirus vaccine, saying that he believes one could be available as soon as the end of this year, or the beginning of 2021. Fauci’s update came during a House Energy and Commerce Committee on the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Fauci testified along with other top officials leading the nation’s efforts against the coronavirus, specifically Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Steven Hahn, and Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir.\n\n...\n\nSocial Media Information:\n\nBGN Facebook Page: Click here to like our page\n\nBGN Twitter: Follow @BleedingGreen\n\nBGN Instagram: Follow @BleedingGreenInsta\n\nBGN Manager: Brandon Lee Gowton: Follow @BrandonGowton"
