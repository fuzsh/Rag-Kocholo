The 10 draft picks tied for the third-highest among all programs nationally in 2024 and were four more than the second-place ACC team. FSU was one of six teams nationally with three top-40 selections, and its six top-100 picks tied for the third-highest total among all collegiate programs. The Seminoles extended their streak of having at least one former player taken to 41 straight years, the eighth-longest active streak in the country.\n\nShowcasing the balance of last year’s squad, Florida State had five offensive players and five defensive players selected. It was the fifth time in program history with five offensive players taken in the same year and first time since 2015. The last time Florida State had five defensive players off the board in the same year was 2013, and 2024 marked the ninth time with at least five FSU defenders taken. FSU had multiple defensive linemen drafted for the 14th time in program history. The Seminoles also had their 14th year with multiple defensive backs taken in the same draft and have produced 37 defensive back picks in the last 37 NFL Drafts.
