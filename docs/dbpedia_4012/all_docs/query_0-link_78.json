        "text": "For the second straight week, the Philadelphia Eagles used a big second-half comeback to pull off a win and improve to 2-0.\n\nThe comebacks have been sparked by the Eagles' explosive offense, which is led by six-time Pro Bowl left tackle Jason Peters.\n\nThe former Arkansas tight end helped protect quarterback Nick Foles, who threw for 331 yards in the Eagles' 30-27 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Monday Night Football, and paved the way for running backs LeSean McCoy and Darren Sproles, who averaged 4.4 yards per carry.\n\nPeters' play prompted some high praise from ESPN's Jon Gruden, a former Super Bowl Champion head coach and current Monday Night Football analyst.\n\n\"How would you like to play quarterback with Jason Peters as your left tackle?\" Gruden said. \"I just don’t see Peters getting any trouble ever in pass protection. He’s better than everybody he blocks every week. He’s a great run blocker and he is outstanding in pass protection.”\n\nPeters was one of 13 former Arkansas football players on an NFL 53-man roster during Week 2, after the Jacksonville Jaguars waived defensive end Chris Smith and signed him to their practice squad.\n\nHere is a look at how the other 12 performed.\n\nAlvin Bailey - Seattle Seahawks\n\nBailey played, but did not start in the Seahawks' 30-21 loss to the San Diego Chargers. He helped the Seattle offense gain 288 yards while playing as a reserve offensive lineman.\n\nKnile Davis - Kansas City Chiefs\n\nStarting running back Jamaal Charles went down early in the Chiefs' 24-17 loss to the Denver Broncos, giving Davis the majority of the carries in the game. He finished with 79 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries and 26 yards on six receptions, but he did have one fumble.\n\nJerry Franklin - Kansas City Chiefs\n\nFranklin made his Chiefs debut Sunday, but did not register any stats in Kansas City's 24-17 loss to the Broncos.\n\nNate Garner - Miami Dolphins\n\nGarner played, but did not start in the Dolphins' 29-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills. During the game, starting offensive guard Shelley Smith went down with a sprained knee injury that could cause him to miss 2-4 weeks. That could mean more playing time for Garner.\n\nBrett Goode - Green Bay Packers\n\nThe Packers made three field goals and two extra points in their 31-24 win over the New York Jets. They also punted four times, meaning Goode saw the field nine times as the Packers' long snapper.\n\nChris Gragg - Buffalo Bills\n\nIn the Bills' 29-10 win over the Miami Dolphins, Gragg caught his first pass of the 2014 season. The reception went for 14 yards.\n\nPeyton Hillis - New York Giants\n\nFor the second straight week, Hillis played, but did not start in the Giants' 25-14 loss to the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nRyan Mallett - Houston Texans\n\nMallett remains the second-team quarterback for the Texans, as Ryan Fitzpatrick has led Houston to a 2-0 start, including a 30-14 win over the Oakland Raiders in which he had a Total QBR score of 92.0.\n\nDarren McFadden - Oakland Raiders\n\nMaking his first start of the season in the place of starting running back Maurice Jones-Drew, McFadden had 37 yards and one touchdown on 12 carries and two receptions for 31 yards in the Raiders' 30-14 loss to the Houston Texans.\n\nTravis Swanson - Detroit Lions\n\nFor the second straight week, Swanson did not play on offense, but he had nine snaps on special teams, including kickoff return, in the Lions' 24-7 loss to the Carolina Panthers.\n\nGeorge Wilson - Tennessee Titans\n\nMaking his first start of the 2014 season, Wilson made two solo tackles in the Titans' 26-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nJarius Wright - Minnesota Vikings\n\nIn the Vikings' 30-7 loss to the New England Patriots, Wright caught one pass for 12 yards and one carry for minus-five yards."
