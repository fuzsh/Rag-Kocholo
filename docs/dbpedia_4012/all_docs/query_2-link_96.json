Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy said the team wants the veteran speedster back as soon as possible but expressed confidence that \"we've got the guys to do it\" until Brown is ready to play. The first guy who will be getting a chance to play more is Justin Watson and Nagy said that the team doesn't feel a need to change much due to the injury. Watson had 42 catches for 775 yards and five touchdowns in 33 regular season games for the Chiefs the last two years. He added nine catches for 120 yards in the postseason.\n\nLink to story\n\nMarquise Brown player page\n\nGiants | Tyrone Tracy may have avoided serious injury Tue Aug 13, 02:58 PM\n\nUpdating a previous report, New York Giants RB Tyrone Tracy Jr. (leg) was already back in meetings hours after his right leg was placed in an aircast and he was carted off the field on Tuesday, Aug. 13.\n\nFootballguys view: NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reports the same. We'll see how long the rookie is sidelined, but given how it initially looked, this would be a positive outcome.\n\nLink to story\n\nBengals | Ja'Marr Chase Absent From Practice Field Tuesday Tue Aug 13, 02:48 PM\n\nWhile Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase has not been practicing during training camp -- ostensibly due to him seeking a new contract -- he has been present as the team's worked on the field. That is not the case on Tuesday, as multiple reporters on the scene have noted Chase is absent from Tuesday's session.\n\nFootballguys view: While Chase's absence is a change, Jay Morrison of ProFootballNetwork.com said it appears to be a lighter practice focused more on special teams. The Bengals are traveling to Chicago to practice with the Bears later this week. As Profootballtalk.com notes, neither Chase nor the team have confirmed that the receiver is indeed staging a hold-in, but that's what appears to be going on with the receiver. Chase has two years remaining on his rookie contract after the Bengals picked up his fifth-year option in the spring. Head coach Zac Taylor repeated what he's been saying when asked about Chase on Monday, saying that he and the receiver have had \"good conversations\" and that the club will take things day-by-day. The rest of us will follow suit -- whether we want to or not.\n\nLink to story\n\nJa'Marr Chase player page\n\nSaints | Alvin Kamara limited Tuesday Tue Aug 13, 02:47 PM\n\nNew Orleans Saints RB Alvin Kamara (back) only participated in walk-throughs due to back tightness on Tuesday, Aug. 13.\n\nFootballguys view: After participating in the pre-practice walk-through, Kamara left the field when individual sessions began. Head coach Dennis Allen said the injury isn't considered serious. \"It's just something he's dealt with before, so I don't anticipate it being a bigger deal,\" Allen said. We'll assume that's the case until evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nLink to story\n\nAlvin Kamara player page\n\nJaguars | Arik Armstead ready for action Tue Aug 13, 02:40 PM\n\nJacksonville Jaguars DT Arik Armstead (knee) was activated from the Active/Physically Unable to Perform list on Tuesday, Aug. 13.\n\nLink to story\n\nArik Armstead player page"
