While he explores his home and the wreckage...\n\nHe encounteres the passenger's ghosts. One of the crew mentions that they were forced to take off too soon, because there was a vehicle on the runway...\n\nHe then comes across the body of a little blonde girl, that has a robotic talking bear, which is repeating a part of the story about the \"THREE BEARS\"... Earl is then startled awake!\n\nEarl then explores his house, and discoveres that it was just a dream... or was it?... It seemed so real to him, that he begins to wonder if maybe, the dream was a premonition... Eventually he goes to the airport near his home, in his pajamas & robe, to look around...\n\nAs he starts to recognize the passengers, as being some of the ghosts he encountered in his dream...\n\n...From a distance, he hears an earily familiar robotic talking bear, telling a story about the \"THREE BEARS\"... When he tracks the bear down, his worst fears are confirmed, when he learns it belongs to a little blonde girl...\n\nNow convinced his dream, was in fact a premonition... Earl now tries to prevent the accident...\n\nBut, as one might expect... \"people won't believe him\"!\n\nCan Earl Save The Day?"
