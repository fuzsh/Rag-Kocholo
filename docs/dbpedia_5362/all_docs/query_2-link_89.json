        "text": "Charles Durning will be best remembered for his role as a corrupt governor in the musical \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\" in 1982, which earned him his first Oscar nomination, as a Nazi officer in the comedy \"To Be or Not to Be\" by Mel Brooks, for which the year after won a second nomination, as well as for his performances in \"Dog Afternoon\" (nomination for the Golden Globe), the film \"Žaoka\" and the comedy in \"Tootsie\".\n\nFour years ago, Derning received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild of America. In his career, he won all American acting awards except the Oscar.\n\nBorn in 1923 in an Irish family with ten children, Derning was seriously wounded in World War II during the Normandy landings, and was awarded three Purple Hearts and a Silver Star for his wartime merits. A few years ago, his colleague Bart Reynolds stated that Durning was probably the most decorated (then) living war veteran.\n\nHe started acting after the war in New York theaters. The turning point in his film career was his role in the film \"Žaoka\" (Sting) in 1973 alongside Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Hundreds of notable roles on the big and small screens followed, among others, he played Santa Claus four times and the Pope once (John XXIII in the TV movie). As a dance instructor, he was often called to act in musicals as well.\n\n\"I've never turned down a role and I've never argued with producers and directors,\" he said in 2008 when he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \"If I'm not acting, I drive my wife crazy. I constantly go out into the yard and look at the mailbox, and when I come back I ask if someone called me,\" he added.\n\nIn 1990, he received a Tony Award for his role in the Broadway remake of Cats on a Hot Tin Roof.\n\nGallery"
