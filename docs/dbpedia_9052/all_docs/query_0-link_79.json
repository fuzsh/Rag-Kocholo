From the time he was six or seven; his father told him he was to become a lawyer.

Gray was born on August 25, 1945, the youngest of Alma (Holman) and Oakley Gray’s nine children; Genelle, Doris, Harold, Earl, Norma, Frank, Carol, Shelby and Robert “Bobby”. Alma was a homemaker and Oakley was a police officer in Marengo for many years. Bob’s three older brothers all proudly served their country in the U.S. Air Force. Bob graduated from Marengo Community High School in 1963 and enlisted in the Navy in 1964.\n\nHe served on the USS Gridley prior to a leave in the summer of 1967. While on leave he became engaged with plans to marry when he returned from a final tour of duty. When returning to duty he had chosen to go on river duty. This duty saw him stationed on YRBM-16 (yard repair, berthing and messing). YRBM are large un-propelled barges used by the “Brown Water Navy”. They are known by this term due to the fact that they are capable of military operations in rivers or “brown water” especially near shorelines. They were used as bases for specialized river boats.\n\nAt the time of the explosion that ultimately was the cause of Bob’s death, the barge was between Ben Tre Canal and Ham Luong River in southern Vietnam which was about a mile wide.\n\nThe explosion took place on November 24, 1967 at 1:12 a.m., the day after Thanksgiving. The explosion ripped a 17’ x 18’ x 9’ hole below the water line, this tore into sleeping quarters throwing men from their “racks” which also ruptured oil and fuel tanks. Bob went to his battle station in the crow’s nest but could not see through the smoke and the flames. The crew was ordered to abandon ship but Bob was unable to come down from the crow’s nest. The metal post was too hot for him to descent so he leaped through the flames where a canopy broke his fall. In spite of the canopy the burns on his body were horrific. A crewmate picked him up and attempted to carry him to safety. While carrying him another explosion ripped through causing shrapnel to become embedded in the crewmate’s leg. Upon waking up in the hospital, his crewmate found out that Bob had been evacuated to Yokohama, Japan with severe burns over most of his body.\n\nSadly, Robert “Bobby” succumbed to his injuries on November 27, 1967.\n\nSteven Skeels, nephew of Robert “Bobby” Gray, states that his mom was Genelle, the oldest of Alma and Oakley’s children and Bob was only seven years older than him. Steven still holds fond memories of Uncle Bobby, like fighting over who got to drink the pickle juice. Uncle Bobby took Steven to see his first movie at the Marengo Colonial Theater in which they say the original 13 Ghosts in 3D, where they had to wear the silly cardboard glasses to see the ghosts. Steven recalls so many good memories, yet so many opportunities lost to make new memories with his uncle.\n\nBobby’s death changed the family in so many ways. When the Naval Commander presented Bob’s medals to Alma and Oakley, the look in Oakley’s eyes was heartbreaking. Oakley was never the same after that, the light in his eyes was extinguished. He lost a son, his youngest child. Like so many other loved ones, Oakley was as much a victim of the Vietnam War as Bobby was. Oakley passed away just two and a half years later at the age of 66.\n\nIn recognition to his service to his country Bob was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal for counteroffensive Phase I-VI, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Metal, the Combat Action bar, the National Defense Medal and a Purple Heart.\n\nStories and firsthand accounts can be found online at: https://brownwater-navy.com/vietnam/YRBM16ds.htm and in the book “War in the Shallows” by John Darrell Sherwood.\n\nSergeant Gerald Havens – USMC – Vietnam\n\nGerald “Jerry” Havens – Sergeant – USMC\n\nJerry was born on December 29, 1948, to George and Loretta Havens, the youngest in a family of 12 children, three girls and nine boys.

Her mother Margaret fled Poland during turmoil and despair of communistic rule in hopes of a better life. She had to leave Anna behind with her grandmother and sister. It was not easy but after some time in Austria her mother arrived in the United States. She settled in Chicago. Anna arrived in the United States at the age of almost 9 and became a naturalized US citizen. She attended Falconer Elementary and Steinmetz Academic Center. She received good grades, took A.P. and honors courses but her dream was to be a dancer and artist… and neuro surgeon. She also attended Foreman high school during 7th and 8th grades for math. She was active in art club, track, cross country, and was senior class secretary. In her junior year she had enough credits to graduate but without direction and knowing how to pay for college she signed up for the Army reserves although she trained weekly with the Marines and poolees. She decided to finish her senior year and at the MEPS station she scratched off Army and signed up for Marine Corps active duty.\n\nThe recruiter was livid but she knew it in her heart it was the best decision especially since the Marines training wasn’t any shorter just because she was female. Anna arrived at Paris Island South Carolina on Father’s Day 1992 at the age of 17. It was a difficult training yet it seemed like it was right where she belonged. It was definitely a test not for the faint of heart. She graduated with a meritorious promotion.\n\nImmediately after that she did a TAD for recruiting duty for several months And then attended MOS School as an 0411 in Little Creek Virginia. She did another 30 days on TAD for recruiting duty. This eventually earned her another meritorious promotion. Anna finally arrived at MCAGCC at 29 palms California.

After the return of her unit she received a meritorious mast and was promoted to Cpl. Her units commanding officer was none other than Gen.”MadDog” Mattis.\n\nAnna held several billets during her time in the Marine Corps as well as cross training as an ammo tech. She also began classes with the Marine Corps Institute as well as a junior college on base. Unfortunately what seemed like a career turned short by an 5-ton truck accident, and she was honorably discharged. She considers earning that Eagle Globe and Anchor as one of the proudest moments in her life.\n\nAnna returned to Illinois in 1995 and lived in Hoffman Estates while attending college and working as a waitress full-time. She attended Harper College and Northeastern Illinois University. She worked in accounting in the construction field for over 20+ years. She also worked part-time as a certified peer support specialist at TLS Veterans and assisting the healthy mind healthy body’s program for NISRA.\n\nShe loves art and continues to do it as much as possible.

He was the youngest of three children and the only son. Victor’s parents farmed on shares and moved several times during his childhood in and around the Marengo area. Victor graduated from Marengo Community High School at the age of 16 and went to work for a local contractor and had the benefit of working alongside his cousin Donald Krueger as a carpenter until duty called and he was drafted into the Army to serve in the Korean Conflict.\n\nThe following is a timeline of his time of service in his words: “On October 1, 1951 I was inducted into the Army at Fort Sheridan in Chicago, IL. From there I was sent to Camp Chaffee, Arkansas where I spent the next four days until I was transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. While at Fort Sill I took infantry basic training for eight weeks and then went through eight more weeks of artillery training and fire direction school. The next stop was Fort Lawton, Washington where I boarded a boat to Camp Drake, Japan where I spent three days, drew supplies, and boarded the same boat to Incheon, Korea. I arrived at Incheon on April 1, 1952 and was assigned to Baker Battery 17th Field Artillery Battalion.”\n\n“While at Fort Sill we trained on 105 Howitzers which at that time I thought was heavy artillery. When I arrived at Baker Battery 17th Field Artillery and while waiting to be assigned, the weapon closest to where I was being processed received a fire mission. When that round was fired I had my first taste of heavy artillery and believe me, I was ready to rotate. After being reviewed by the commanding officer I was assigned to #4 Gun Section where I remained until I rotated. Having a farm and construction background, I was assigned as an Assistant Prime Mover Operator. Approximately one month later, the regular operator rotated and I became the operator.”\n\n“The Prime Mover Operator stayed with the gun crew rather than in the motor pool. The Prime Mover was a M4 18 ton all track vehicle. When living with the gun crew I was filling in all the duties with the cannoneers when I wasn’t driving or pulling maintenance on the vehicle. The gun crew was happy to have the extra body so they would let me fill in any position. Consequently, during fire missions I filled in mostly as the telephone operator and the number one man whose duty was to fire the weapon. Later in my tour of duty I would fill in as the assistant gunner or the gunner. All of these positions kept me in close proximity to the weapon. As the number one man, the only protection for the ears was to put the muscle of your right arm over your right ear and reach over the top of your head and put your middle finger in your left ear. The noise and the back blast and concussion were terrific. When we fell out for fire missions, most of the time our fatigues were bloused in our boots and by the time you had fired 2 or 3 rounds your boots were untied. We were always warned to keep our mouths open to help prevent concussion. I did my best, but I still suffered hearing loss in both of my ears that plagues me to this day. Our unit was fortunate that we were only hit by incoming artillery about 10 times and only suffered a few injuries to some of our unit and no fatalities. When we fired counter battery it was very short. Two or three rounds and all would be quiet.”\n\n“I entered the Army as a Private First Class and by the time I left Korea I had been promoted to the rank of Staff Sergeant. I was rotated from Korea to Fort Mason, California on the 28th day of May, 1953 and transferred to Camp Crowder, Missouri. On July 15, 1953 I was separated from active duty with a total active time of 21 months and 15 days.”\n\nWhen Victor returned from service, his parents decided to sell all of their equipment and retire from farming. Due to suffering from severe allergies, Victor supported their decision and took a job at Arnold Engineering as a machine operator. At the time of his retirement 38 years later he was the 1st shift foreman for Production Machine Shop and Finish Grind. He also worked part time for several years at Perkin’s Shell Station.\n\nOn September 14, 1956 Victor married Carol Driver. They have lived in the same home on E. Washington St. since 1965 and have raised three children (Sheryl, Scott and Steven). Through their children they have seven grandchildren and one great grandchild Melissa and Matthew Vogel, Kristin (Mortensen) Talac, Eric Mortensen, Tanner Mortensen, Parker Mortensen, Mackenna Mortensen and Houston Vogel.\n\nChief Warrant Officer Danny J Rudy – US Army – Vietnam\n\nDan Rudy was born on May 2, 1945.
