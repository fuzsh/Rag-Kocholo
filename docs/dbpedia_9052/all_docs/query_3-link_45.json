        "text": "This post was updated in January 2024\n\nThe most frequently asked question on our Gaudí Free Tour is this one: “Which Gaudí house is better, Casa Milà or Casa Batlló?”. The easiest answer is to visit both if you can as each one is a masterpiece in its own right. However, not everyone has enough time in Barcelona or maybe they prefer to see other attractions to make their visit more varied.\n\nLet me explain the pros and cons of each of these UNESCO World Heritage buildings so you can make an informed decision. At the end of the article, I will also tell you which one is my personal favourite and how you can book official tickets and skip the queues. Don’t forget that Casa Milà has a nickname: La Pedrera.\n\nCasa Milà vs Casa Batlló: a comparative\n\nThe architecture\n\nMany people love the colourful ornate facade of Casa Batlló. It is full of eye-catching tiles that make the house impossible to miss when strolling past. With its bone-like balconies and curvy reptile roof, this facade is usually preferred to that of La Pedrera. While Casa Batlló certainly followed the fashions of the time, it is not strictly 100 per cent Gaudí. The architect was commissioned to remodel this 1870s building in keeping with the Art Nouveau fashion of the day.\n\nI always ask guests on my tours to dig a little deeper to see the genius in Casa Milà too. This apartment block was designed from the ground up and Gaudí abandoned colour for form. It is so original and unlike any construction from this period. You will either love or hate the recycled welded iron balconies on its wavy limestone front.\n\nBoth masterpieces can be seen from the outside, so, no agonising choices here. However, as regards layout, ingenuity, new construction methods and importance, La Pedrera would get the critics thumbs up.\n\nOUR TIP: Looking at both houses from the outside? Decided on which to enter? Get online and book. It is also cheaper than paying at the entrance.\n\nBOOK CASA MILÀ/LA PEDRERA TICKETS\n\nBOOK CASA BATLLÓ TICKETS\n\nThe interior\n\nLet’s discuss the interiors. What do you get to visit? Which one is better?\n\nEntrances, courtyards and patios\n\nIn both houses, you see the inside patio (two in la Pedrera), the stairway, an individual apartment, the attic and the roof terrace. I prefer the entranceway to Casa Batlló by far. It is like entering a jewelry box and the carved wooden staircase up to the apartment will blow you away. If you are a tile person the interior patio is all about decoration. It is beautifully done in shades of blue giving the atmosphere of submergence in the ocean depths.\n\nCasa Milà’s entranceway starts at a modern-looking ticket office where you put your belongings through a security check. But once through to the first patio, you can breathe a sigh of relief as it is round and spacious, catering to larger numbers. While the patios are a lot plainer inside, there are some eye-catching painted frescoes around.\n\nOUR TIP: If the queue for the lift to the roof terrace in La Pedrera looks long, ask the staff to show you the stairway off the patio (servants used it in the olden days). It is 8 floors up so make sure you are fit and ready for the climb.\n\nLiving quarters\n\nThe living quarters of Casa Batlló are not furnished and a lot of rooms (kitchen, servants’ quarters and bathroom) are missing so it lacks that sense of a real lived-in apartment. Despite this, some people do prefer the interior. Sculpted wooden doors, colourful stained glass windows and rounded plaster ceilings transport guests to a fairy wonderland. The family terrace is open to visitors affording a view of the back part of the house, a feature which is not available in Casa Milà.\n\nLa Pedrera’s apartment is furnished, giving a great insight into how people lived and decorated their abodes in this era. Wandering from room to room disorientates most as the layout follows the curve of the round patio which is so unusual in any construction. Subtle and brilliant, it does, however, miss that immediate first impression, the wow factor of Casa Batlló.\n\nOUR TIP: Both living quarters exhibition spaces can feel quite cramped when busy so try to catch the late evening visits (about 1.5 hours before closing time).\n\nThe Attic\n\nThe white plastered, ribbed walls of the attic in Casa Batlló make you feel the nickname House of Bones is very fitting for this dwelling. In parts, it can be narrow and if crowded a bit claustrophobic, but this impressive passageway must be walked to arrive at the roof terrace. Look out for a mesmerising art installation by Refik Anadol. Enchanting as the piece is, I feel it takes away from the original characteristics of the house.\n\nCasa Milà’s loft has bare ribbed walls and ceilings made from red brick, immediately creating a warm and relaxed atmosphere. It’s an enormous space and is dotted with small windows so one does not feel boxed in or stuffy. Excellent models, videos, charts, furniture and more give the visitor a fantastic insight into all of Gaudi’s work, a display that Casa Batlló lacks.\n\nOUR TIP: One exhibit not to be missed in Casa Milà’s rafters is the hanging chain model of Colonia Güell. It explains Gaudí’s genius by looking in the mirror below.\n\nThe roof terrace\n\nThe terrace of Casa Batlló is not as promising as you might think by looking at the roof from below. It houses chimneys, the skylight and the water storage room.\n\nFancy a cool drink? Seats and tables surround a little mini bar, a cramped and recent addition to this housetop.\n\nWhile still imaginative and, no mistaking, a Gaudí rooftop, I get the feeling that, after completion, the architect thought to himself: “I can definitely do better in my next house“. And that, my friends, would be La Pedrera.\n\nThe terrace of Casa Milà is one of the most magical places in Barcelona and a sculptural masterpiece. Stairwells, ventilation towers and chimneys are the 3 main elements that combine to make a highly original and wonderful space. It is not a flat surface (like casa Batlló) and you will be climbing up and downstairs to see the sights so those with bad knees, be aware.\n\nAs a plus, you can actually enjoy beautiful views of Barcelona from La Pedrera’s roof terrace (a classic photopic is the one of Sagrada Familia framed by one of the arches). Even famous film directors like Michelangelo Antonioni found the place irresistible enough to use it as a backdrop for a movie. Check out this scene of his 1975 film “The Passenger” with Jack Nicholson and Maria Schneider wandering around Gaudí’s rooftop in a very grimy Casa Milà (things are quite different now).\n\nThe only disadvantage of La Pedrera’s roof terrace compared to Casa Batlló’s is that it will be closed when it rains. So check the weather forecast beforehand so you don’t leave Barcelona without experiencing it.\n\nOUR TIP: On Summer nights both La Pedrera and Casa Batlló offer night shows on their roof terraces. Both are great and I can’t think of a better way to enjoy the atmosphere of these special places accompanied by great music and surrounded by Gaudí’s endless imagination.\n\nThe price\n\nThere is no way out here: both houses are quite expensive (especially Casa Batlló with the new interactive experiences), although there are some discounts for seniors and students. Families, don’t despair. Casa Batllo allows children under 12 in for free and are all given interactive mini-tablets to keep them occupied. La Pedrera, unfortunately, gives discounts but charges for 7-year-olds and up. The good news is that the price always includes the audio-guide which, especially in the case of Casa Batlló, is quite helpful.\n\nBear in mind that there is a surcharge of €4 to €12 in Casa Batlló and €2 in La Pedrera if you decide to buy your ticket at the entrance. This is one of the reasons why it is advisable to pre-book online. The main one is that you will skip the lines at both attractions (only with the Gold Ticket at Casa Batlló).\n\nOne word of warning: nowadays, there are many websites selling tickets to the Gaudí attractions. Most of them will charge an extra booking fee so you will end up paying more than you should. Even worse, there are even some scamming sites selling fake tickets that, of course, won’t be valid. If you want to pay the official price, always book through an official site. These are the official sites where you can purchase tickets to both buildings with no surprises:\n\nBook tickets to Casa Milà / La Pedrera\n\nBook tickets to Casa Batlló\n\nWHAT TYPE OF TICKET TO BUY FOR CASA BATLLÓ AND LA PEDRERA\n\nBoth houses have a large choice of tickets. They vary in price depending on what experience you choose. It can be very confusing when you land on the ticket page. Some entrances include more spaces in the house, some virtual experiences, night experiences and early morning experiences. Let’s break it simply down for you.\n\nThe Basic must-see tickets!\n\nLet’s start with the basic visit without frills or expensive hikes in price (the areas explained above in the blog). These are the classic visits offered before the houses decided on creative ways to make more of a profit on their tickets.\n\nLa Pedrera Essential\n\nThis informative audio-guided tour includes all the important and impressive locations of the building: courtyards, tenant’s apartment, whale attic and warrior roof terrace. In all honesty, there is a wealth of things to see in this visit.\n\nPrice: €28 (discounts available for seniors, children, students, etc).\n\nCasa Batlló General visit: BLUE TICKET\n\nThis audio-guided tour includes all the main areas of the building: entrance, apartment, interior & exterior patios, attic and roof terrace. A new addition is to go down a back stairway decorated by the architect Kengo Kuma. An installation of tactile aluminian chains surrounds you until you reach the 360-degree experience Gaudi cube located in the basement.\n\nPrice: €25 to €35 (discounts available for seniors, children, students, etc. Free for children under 12).\n\nThe price difference is because the booking system shows different entrance fees depending on the time of the year and demand.\n\nUpgrade on basic must-see tickets\n\nLa Pedrera Full experience\n\nThis includes the above basic visit plus the virtual visit to the mezzanine on a lower floor. Prepare to put on a bulky pair of mixed-reality glasses that show holograms giving you an immersive experience. Great for families with kids and teenagers, but not recommended for children under 10 as the headpiece is too big for the little heads.\n\nPrice: €38 (discounts available for seniors, children, students, etc).\n\nCasa Batlló General ticket: SILVER and GOLD options\n\nOnce you click to confirm your general ticket, you can choose between Blue (basic ticket), Silver or Gold.\n\nThe SILVER TICKET gives you everything in the basic ticket and more. It includes an interactive mini-tablet that you twirl around showing period photos of the decoration in each room. At other locations, little animations pop up. Access is given also to see the dome, an immersive area giving you insight into Gaudí’s inspirations from nature. It’s very gimmicky but in all fairness, kids and teenagers love it.\n\nPrice: €5 extra on top of the Basic Ticket\n\nThe GOLD TICKET gives you everything that is included in the silver and more. Skip the line, free cancellation, flexibility when to visit… Also, you get access to a first-floor dwelling (Batlló’s private residence) that is furnished with Art Nouveau pieces. It is a small space but jaw-dropping beautiful and a far cry from the modern tech going on in other parts of the building.\n\nPrice: €10 extra on top of the Basic Ticket\n\nNight visits\n\nBoth Houses offer special nighttime visits which are more expensive but offer a very different experience!\n\nLa Pedrera Night Experience\n\nThis is a more personal experience as they limit the number of people per group, led by a helpful guide answering queries. You will see the wonderfully lit courtyards without the crowds, and the eerily quiet attic. The roof terrace takes on a magical dimension by moonlight. You will be treated to a light-projected show and round off with a glass of cava. Unfortunately, a visit to the apartment is not included, but I felt this did not take away from what is ideally a night show.\n\nPrice: €39 (discounts available for seniors, children, students, etc).\n\nCasa Batlló: A Winter Night (only until February 18th)\n\nThis is showbiz at its best. The apartment is lit up in the most magical fantasy-like colours. There is no private tour leader here but the audio guide is different from the daytime one. The narrator guides you from one room to the next, recounting his childhood memories. You see different parts of the house depending on your Blue, Silver or Gold ticket. Unfortunately, no glass of cava unless you pay the inflated prices for one at their bar on the roof!\n\nPrice: €39 to €49 (discounts available for seniors, children, students, etc).\n\nEarly Morning visits\n\nLa Pedrera sunrise\n\nPrice: €39 (discounts available for seniors, children, students, etc).\n\nCasa Batlló: Be the first\n\nPrice: €45 (discounts available for seniors, children, students, etc).\n\nBoth houses have the option of touring the house before the official opening time. The idea is that visitors can beat the crowds and have the house to themselves, but in all honesty, this is not the case during high season and it is not that busy in low season.\n\nMy advice is to book a basic ticket about an hour and a half before closing time. At that stage of the day, the masses have melted away. It is less hectic and saves you the extra hefty fee that both houses charge.\n\nThe queues and crowds\n\nCasa Batlló is a smaller building and in the high season feels very squashed. Sometimes it is hard to appreciate the interior as there are way too many people inside. A few times on my Gaudí private tours we got caught in a human traffic jam through the narrow attic that leads to the roof terrace.\n\nThe queues are always long to get into this house also, maybe because it is more popular or because it moves slower. I always advise clients to go early in the evening when most people have finished sightseeing and are heading off for dinner.\n\nCasa Milà is a larger space and more able to cater to a larger number of people. Even in the high season, the queues are manageable. However, because of this, tour groups are regularly brought here and it is not unusual to see a tour bus or two parked around the corner. The group entrance is a separate one from the individual travellers so it will not affect the line to get in.\n\nOrganised groups whisk through the building as they are on a schedule so hold back, they will move on quickly. Just don’t get caught in the living quarters on show with a large tour as this is the smallest space on show and can feel cramped if crowded.\n\nCasa Milà or Casa Batlló? My personal choice\n\nCasa Milà\n\nMy personal favourite is Casa Milà. As a tour guide bringing people around, there is so much more to dig your teeth into. The building is a leap forward in construction methods. Maybe its modern front is not to everyone’s taste but it is uniquely original for its time. The roof terrace is a winner in everyone’s book while the attic is amazing and has a more complete exhibition space. The apartment on view has a unique layout being cleverly designed by Gaudí and all rooms are present and furnished. If you are in any way interested in architecture, this is the one to pick.\n\nCasa Batlló\n\nHowever, one can not dismiss Casa Batlló, even though it was only been remodelled by Gaudí. It is a masterpiece of craftwork and, if not a bit over the top, fuels the imagination. Many clients I have had on my tours, preferred Casa Batlló for this reason, especially families with kids. The mini-tablet guide keeps the children well-occupied and fires up their interest.\n\nIn Casa Batlló there is a new 360-Degree Experience that started in May 2021. Bear in mind that this is not designed by Gaudí. It consists of a series of eye-catching art installations placed outside the rooms mentioned above. At the moment this is the only option available if you want to see the house. This has pushed up the price of the visit by a whopping 40%! We will keep you informed here if options without this new feature are available again at some point.\n\nMy advice is to study this post, look at the photos of both houses, think about what you want from the visit and decide from there.\n\nCasa Milà a.k.a.
