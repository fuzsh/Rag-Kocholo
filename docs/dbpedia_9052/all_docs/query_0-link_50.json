        "text": "Greetings from New York City. I hope you’re settling in to the season. I was recently reminded of something my daughter said to me during another period of strife in our world, particularly in the States.It’s ok for each of us to come up with how we contribute, small or big. Each of us can make a contribution, as Marion Anderson once said.\n\nI’ve had some wonderful shows, including April at City Winery Boston, performing the Reimagining Cole Porter concert. On June 9th I joined my old friend Kenny White at the very special Club Passim in Cambridge. Always a join to play there. We were joined that night by Kevin Barry, Marty Ballou, and Eugene Ruffolo, with a surprise song from Peter Wolf. A joyful night with old friends.\n\nI released two albums in 2023, my proudest endeavors to date. “Under My Skin: Reimagining Cole Porter” and “But Longing is Primal” – an album of very personal songs with a wish list of musicians I am so grateful to.\n\nI hope to see you on down the road. I hope you are creating meaningful days for yourselves and that you have love and light in your life. JB\n\nWhy do we do engage in our arts, our sports, our household projects, our secret novels, our late night baking obsessions? To brag about it on Instagram, with a perfectly posed picture? It’s very gratifying when you share a project of any kind (hey, I brought this orange cheesecake I’m trying out!) but if we’re living right, we’re doing these things privately to express some deep love for the thing. Over the years, it becomes more and more private, and yet as we perfect the thing we sure as hell want to share it.\n\nThen, as the world explodes, implodes, radiates, sobs…all those things seem oddly silly. I have decided we need the arts, and we need to do private things that express our joy and pain and above all, our stories. And sometimes we should share.\n\nFor the expression of the art, and the care for the world’s story, I chose to book another show of musical stories, and to raise funds and awareness for voting rights issues. I can’t go to war zones, but I have a daughter whose future in America in small part depends on a free and fair election process, inviting millions of young people registering to vote and making their voices known. Join us at The Bitter End on Nov 13th, 7pm, for a night of song featuring myself, James Maddock, Kenny White, Bette Sussman, Eugene Ruffolo, Larry Saltzman, Richard Hammond, Frank Vilardi, and Angela Reed. Your ticket purchase will go towards the Campus Vote Project, registering young students for their next expression of individual rights.\n\nHow are you?\n\nI’m sincerely looking to the fall for renewed energy and some kind of turning of the corner. My guru (not officially) Tania just told me I have reason to believe that’s coming. My mother raised me to be a fighter! She also raised me to make nice and always put others before myself, something I’ve decided isn’t always the healthiest way to go. I think The Chicks would agree. By the way, were you fortunate enough to see them on tour this past season, and did you see my friend Keith Sewell rocking it in their band?\n\nAnyhow…I hope you too are planning new ways to embrace change, love emphatically and without boundaries. My new favorite phrase is “we have a nuanced relationship.”\n\nI invite you to join us at the iconic Bitter End on Nov 13th for a night of music to raise funds for the Campus Vote Project. Young people coming in to their voting power! Lots of friends and surprises!\n\nMark your holiday calendars as well for our now annual alt-Cole Porter show at the beloved City Winery NYC on Dec 17th. My friend Steve Conte has signed on to sing with us. More invited guests to come!\n\nAnd please take a look at our new Music Shop on this site. Finally! By mid October I’ll have Under My Skin: Reimagining Cole Porter album as well as a new JB album of compositions, which I’ve cheekily entitled but longing is primal. You do a great service when you lean in to the gesture of supporting art through commerce, and we thank you.\n\nThe world has been, and continues to be, in a sort of conflagration, if you ask me. But we push back, we must. Let’s keep striving, my friends.\n\nGreetings from the heat-and-thunderstorm-beleagured planet. I’ve taken on two heavy-duty books: “The Myth of Normal” and the old standby “The Body Keeps The Score.” Just a little light reading for the summer! Why bring this up on the music news page? Well, hell, it’s fodder for all sorts of brand new raging OR healing AND certainly a bunch of new songs. Let’s all read and write together this intense summer of ’23. An unexamined life ain’t worth living. That Socrates fella knew a few things.\n\nJeez, what an extraordinary afternoon we had at City Winery on Jun 11th! I can honestly say it was among the top 5 shows of, well, my whole career. For real. Finally had the perfectly harmonious personnel on stage, all in flow together and having a great time. And the audience – you guys were extraordinary. We forgot it was summertime and we might not get the sold-out status we’re used to on this show, but the mighty group who did come were hollering in that good juju way, the minute we walked on stage. The CW staff, who had 100 kid rockers downstairs at some kid thing, were so good to us, and we got the head honcho sound fella doing the best sound I’ve ever had at the joint. We captured it all with a video team – working on the post production now. Let me please just say a very grateful thank you to all y’all who came and made for a magnificent and memorable fellowship.\n\nWe’re in the midst of setting up the new store on this site, offering the ready to go Under My Skin: Reimagining Cole Porter album, on CD or as a download, as well as my 2016 release You See This River. By September I hope to have all the new JB songs from the pandemic years released and on the site for purchase as well, and for listening of all releases on Spotify. As always, we art-makers always encourage you to support through purchasing music for your home listening. See more on this site about the Cole Porter project and view videos from past shows. I could not be more proud of this project, and the very special all-star musicians who’ve given their talents to my arrangements of the great Mr. Porter’s catalogue. I want you all to have these songs in your homes, your cars, your ear buds.\n\nTaking the summer to dig in to some writing, solo as well as with extraordinary writing partners. Very VERY excited about the writing life and looking forward to sending some of those tracks out to opportunities.\n\nGearing up for the Fall 23 and 2024 season of probable fundraiser shows towards groups around the country fighting voter suppression, supporting young voter registration, and building grass roots political engagement. Look for fun solo and group shows to come. Let’s get engaged, my friends!\n\nFor listening, and watching, check out all the music that’s been featured on this site, on my Youtube channel, and on Spotify. So..in case you need reminding…The Cole Porter project! The maestro’s songbook wrapped in the loving arms of fiddle, mando, my old Gibson, classic upright piano, and the lusting and longing of that dobro. ONE MORE duet partner to secure and this thing is done. We let a small number of cuts out of the protective vault, as well as a few JB tracks that will be on that next album, so wander over to Spotify and check them out, and yup, click to be a monthly listener/follower. Go to the Cole Porter page on this site to read more about the project.\n\nIt’s a privilege to have this life, and the life I have mentoring rising songwriters at Berklee College of Music. I’m grateful for this time in my life, even as I struggle like all of us, to make sense of the chaos we see and sometimes directly experience.I will continue to look for ways to channel musical endeavors into causes that need support.If you are not on the mailing list and would like to be kept in the loop, do sign up on this site. If I become annoying, you can always unsubscribe lol!\n\nWe hold our collective breath, metaphorically, for the times they are a-changing. Get thee to your vaccine center if you are due for your next shot! And let us open our hearts to the world that continues to right its ship. Patience, like never before. Let us proceed with hope, with patience, with love and gratitude for what we have, what we may have, and what we may yet achieve, never forgetting the many thousands we have lost, and the challenging work ahead to reach across divides, face our historic faults and fears and rise up in brave new ways. Head stays clear. Heart stays open. Driven by love, not fear.\n\n–JB\n\nAre we ready for a new year? I know I am. There’s been a lot of joy this year as it feels perhaps we’ve turned a corner on handling the pandemic. And yet we are not quite right in this world, wrestling with what it feels like to NOT be tucked away at home all the time. For many of us there was a weird pleasure in hibernation. I miss a few of the things I was able to do, and the people I hibernated with. But let’s all agree we are searching for new ways to be in the world and reach out for connection.\n\nI’m listening to my favorite singer-songwriters and discovering new ones – new to me. During 2021 I listened, at my friend Eugene Ruffolo’s suggestion, on repeat to Mary Chapin Carpenter’s “The Dirt and the Stars.” I couldn’t stop. A very brave collection of lyrics. Now I have listened maybe 500 times to Rose Cousins’ “Natural Conclusion” album. It’s not new, but new to me. She wrote “…stabbed in the back with my own knife….” Ok, right. Let’s pay attention to this one.\n\nI’m very excited to bring the gang back to City Winery a week before Christmas for more Cole Porter, and I’m mixing in some Django Reinhardt (gonna sing that one in French), some Carter Family. Why? All part of the stars alligning in the 40s to produce some truly wondrous moments of music. Cole wrote Kiss Me Kate in that decade. 30 years later I learned my first Carter Family song, my first Cole song, and heard my first gypsy jazz at the American Folklife Festival.\n\nWhat is your heritage, your origin story? Tell it to yourself, and remind yourself that you have something to tell, something to know of yourself, and to re-imagine.\n\nSee you out there. Write me anytime. JB\n\nTrusting in the renewal of fall, folks. I hope you’re catching a wave of energy and hope for liasons that lift us and endeavors that feed our souls. The early spring gave my little creative troupe a boost when we brought the Cole Porter Re-imagined project to City Winery NYC. It was our first time in the “new” CWNYC and the room is just beautiful. So were you. The show was sold out and there was, to draw upon the cliche, magic in the room. I’m so grateful to all of you for sharing that day with us, and for my band and special guests, Steve Conte, Nicki Richards, Eugene Ruffolo, and James Maddock.\n\nWe’ll start the fall with a group show at the Cutting Room NYC, an intimate format for singers and songwriters. We’ll relish the opportunity to play with each other and see all of you in our NYC family, while raising funds for groups around the country who are working on the ground to defend our voting rights, register new voters and preserve our liberties.\n\nI’ll finish the fall in December back at City Winery with the Cole project. I’ve just started creating the album package for that project and talking to folks who could help us bring the songs to venues around the country.\n\nIn every season of our lives we ride the waves up and down and sideways. In the past few years there has been an awful lot of sideways, personally and globally. I don’t know about you, but me, I talk to myself out loud a fair amount these days. Little encouragements, little bit of cussing, little bit of incredulousness. “Really..?” “Are you serious…?” Yup. We can’t control everything, or anyone. But we keep striving; it seems my message to myself never changes. Just keep trying. And with all of our ambitions, our love of our endeavors, it turns out JT was right – everyone knows that love is the only road.\n\nSo let us keep our heads on straight, and our hearts stay open. See you out there. JB\n\nWe’re halfway through winter, apparently. Angie says so. So that’s good news. And the Omicron numbers are heading down, so that’s good news. I’m reminding myself of a few good thoughts I had back in 2017. Looking for quality experiences. Don’t need to mourn history, don’t need to regret anything or push back on the truth. Just time to create quality experiences. And, as that piece of paper on my studio wall reads: Do not be driven by fear; only love.\n\nThat goes for knuckleheads that have made mistakes right in front of you, sometimes in regards to you. There cannot be villains in this story, only sad turns, that can turn into better insights.\n\nRecently someone took very good care of me when I needed help. Another friend said, ok, remember that and manifest only that kind of immeasurable goodness and love. I got kind of fed up with “manifestations” a while back, but then there was that piece of paper on my studio wall.\n\nOk ok.\n\nSo believe it or not, all this lead to booking a livestream show at Euphoria Studios here in NYC.March 3rd, 7pm, on my FB page. I’ll be making some sounds with my pals Larry Saltzman, Ben Stivers, and Richard Hammond. I hope you’ll bring your favorite beverage and snack and join us. Fairy lights including. Requests welcome.\n\nPlease take good care of yourselves. A nice cuppa, something sweet.\n\nObviously, I started putting our news on the front page of this site, but I’ve recently wandered over here and it was quite fun to read the news from the past. So to that end….\n\nThere’s been many shows, and many recording sessions, and many gigs cancelled due to the giant worldwide catastrophe called Covid-19. And we’re still in it. But live shows are happening, and our shows are joyous, for folks who’ve gotten their vaccines!\n\nThe re-imagining of Cole Porter has been an incredible thrill – I created my wish-list of players, some I knew personally but many I simply admired. And most of them said yes! I think they were intrigued by this adventure and surely were delighted to collaborate with each other!\n\nWe’re gearing up for our show at City Winery Loft on Jan 23rd. Special guest duet partners, and extraordinary musicians. And a bit of a showcase, as we look for a label home for this project. In the meantime there are videos and tracks from the upcoming release, right here on the site. Enjoy. Write me! Share with folks. Wander over to Spotify and become a follower/listener.\n\nAs I secured the recording commitments from these world-class players, I often said to these folks, “hey, how about playing on one of my tunes as well.” Cuz that album coming too. And they did. Some tracks being shared on this site and on Spotify as well. Please share!\n\nI send you all my hopes and prayers for a soulful, healthy, gratifying 2022, and I’ll hope to see you out there on the road, in the cafe, conversing with humanity as we well should. JB\n\nIt’s been great conversing with so many of you over the emails. Thank you so much for reaching out. Both albums are coming along nicely, and to that end, I went to Nashville recently and recorded the one and only Jerry Douglas on two songs, “Jetty” and what has been called “When The Snow Comes” but which Jerry and Carmella insisted should really be called “We Ain’t Dead Yet.” And we ain’t, right, kids?\n\nOn April 25th I’ll participate in the remarkable Monica Passim’s Harmony Swap Musicals Edition at the Treehouse. I’ll take a crack at “So In Love.” The recorded version is almost done, featuring Ben Stivers(piano), Richard Hammond(upright), Gary Schreiner (accordion) and Larry Saltzman(mandolin). There will be a monumental number of beautiful singers and songs on this Treehouse evening. Bring your lawn chair and settle in for theatrical bliss.\n\nWe are very excited about the festival coming up at the Schimmel Center on May 10th and 11th: The first annual Crossing Bridges Music Fest, curated by extraordinary artist/producer Paul Guzzone. Our set will be on Friday night the 10th, along with Vance Gilbert, The Kennedys, and Jonathan Coulton. On Saturday at noon I’ll participate in a songwriters in the round, hosted by WFUV’s John Platt, along with Abbie Gardner, the Kennedys, and Dom Flemons. Saturday night May 11th, please don’t miss Dom Flemons, Adam Ezra Group, Abbie Gardner and Paula Cole. I’ll no doubt be making an appearance onstage that evening as well.\n\nI sincerely hope you’re having a great start to the warm season, and that our paths cross very soon. Humanity and humility, and then reach out and touch somebody’s hand.\n\nIt’s been some time since we’ve updated the site with news; how are we doing? Breaking news occurs daily! My DC/Virginia roots have me reeling with what’s going on both in Congress and in the Virginia statehouse. Whether you are glued to the television, out advocating, or holding your hands to your ears, let’s hope we can all make sense of, and stay standing, throughout this tumultuous time in our country.\n\nOn the Blue Room front, we hope you’ll join us on Sunday March 3rd up in the City Winery Loft. I’ll be curating a Night of Obsession. Yes, I know a thing or two about that. I’ll bet my ’57 Gibson Country Western you do too. Hate those wankers who tell me to “snap out of it!” Guests on the night include (so far) Cindy Mizelle, Russ Valazquez, Frank Simms, Terry Radigan, James Maddock, Eugene Ruffalo, John McCurry, Gary Schreiner. Let’s see who else I can cram on the stage.\n\nWe’ve begun work on two new records: New songs written over the last year, and a collection of my favorite Cole Porter songs, given Americana instrumentation and love. Cole, the ultimate obsessive American songwriter. Passion, desire, wit, trouble…\n\nI hope you’ll also join me and several other amazing artists for a wonderful festival in May at the Schimmel Center at Pace University. This is the Crossing Bridges Music Fest, celebrating American songwriters and roots music performers. This is a 2-day festival curated by the multi-talented producer/performer Paul Guzzone, and will take place on May 10th and 11th. I am proud to participate in this festival with Paula Cole, Dom Flemons, Vance Gilbert, The Kennedys, Abbie Gardner, Adam Ezra Group, and Jonathan Coulton. Visit http://schimmelcenter.org/event/crossing-bridges-music-fest for tickets and information.\n\nPlease visit us at http://www.janiebarnett.com for information on other shows, to purchase music, and to say hello.\n\nThank you for keeping the faith, for keeping the arts alive, for staying strong and staying engaged in these challenging times. If you’re having a hard time, remind those close to you that you need some help. We all need help, and we all need to offer it too.\n\nWe are thrilled the new video for “Sweet Thursday” premiered in late February on the all-things-Americana site Mother Church Pew. Thank you to Susan Hubbard for your excitement and support. Please check out the video – we hope it will put a smile on your face! And all y’all should check out this great site for Americana music makers and music lovers.\n\nFrom the site:\n\nVirginia native Janie Barnett cut her teeth on bluegrass festivals, church coffeehouses, and the American Folklife Festival. When she met iconic Americana barnstormer and newgrass pioneer John Hartford at Folklife, so began her love affair with the alternate roots movement. Always dancing along outside-of-the-box boundaries, Barnett found her place in New York City, making a name for herself as a smart, precise, and professional chameleon musician, singing on countless film, television, and commercial projects, as well as singing backup for iconic stars like Linda Ronstadt, Celine Dion, and Rickie Lee Jones.\n\nBarnett has released several collections of music through the years but felt none had fully captured her authentic voice as a writer or musician; her latest album, You See This River, is the culmination of Barnett’s years of searching and exploring, and living a life that many of us find ourselves living.\n\nToday, she unveils the video for album track “Sweet Thursday,” an homage to two of her favorite creations—Steinbeck’s wonderful little novel of the same name, and its companion novel, Canary Row. “The stories are whimsical, full of love and street heroes,” she explains. “The music is a tribute to Neil Young’s ‘Harvest Moon.’ That lilting piece of perfection is so simple, like a love story to all the small notes of music that can make life sweet.” The video features footage captured on cell phones and reflects these sentiments—the sweetness of life in the everyday moments, spending time connecting with friends and loved ones over wine and music and plenty of laughter. “In this life,” she says, “we get to choose our friends.”\n\nWithout further ado, Mother Church Pew proudly presents “Sweet Thursday,” the new video from Janie Barnett ft. Blue Room:\n\nhttp://wp.me/p6GjUh-3xb"
