Peter framed the shot per his brother’s instructions - with the couple offset to the right, Paul’s flourishing garden in the background, and the summer sun shining with approval on the faces of a young couple in love.\n\nPeter pressed the shutter release … and time stood still …\n\nAs a young boy growing up in northern Virginia, Will Garvey was drafted to help with his father’s hobby of beekeeping. “I didn’t like it,” he recalls. “I got stung a lot.” Now, nearly five decades later, Will is the Volunteer Beekeeper for The Park at Flat Rock and a vocal advocate for the many ways individuals can help care pollinators and for the natural world around us.\n\nFifty years ago this month, a healthy baby boy was born to Stephen and Paula Wiesenfeld in Edison, NJ. Within hours, however, the celebration of birth turned into unimaginable tragedy when Paula suffered an amniotic embolism and died on the same day her son was born. It was June 5th, 1972.\n\nAlthough he had no way of knowing, Stephen Wiesenfeld was about to embark on an amazing legal journey that involved confronting an archaic statute of federal law. It also led him into a lifelong friendship with perhaps the most iconic female jurist in our country’s history - Ruth Bader Ginsberg.\n\nCenturies after Native Americans first met on the “great flat rock”, the current-day residents of the village name for that same landmark gathered to celebrate their community, their history, and their good fortune to live in such a beautiful place with the revival of the Village of Flat Rock Ice Cream Social.\n\nWhen Robin Hawkins Anderson arrived in Henderson County in 2015, she was still recovering from the upheaval caused by the dissolution of her marriage. A friend recommended spending time on the trails of the Carl Sandburg Home to find perspective and perhaps discover a new path forward. Seven years and over 7000 photographs later, Robin has published her first book, Uncommon Sanctuary, a photographic diary featuring Carl and Lillian Sandburg’s Connemara home in the mountains of western North Carolina.\n\nDuring a recent Blue Ridge Center for Lifelong Learning course, instructor Paula Withrow did more than just teach history. She brought it to life. Dressed as Mata Hari, Withrow recounted the life and exploits of one of the most famous female spies in history. Her mastery of the subject material was captivating and her sartorial commitment to the topic gave additional life to an already fascinating subject.\n\nAs I stepped into the small Oakland Cemetery on the easternmost edge of Flat Rock, I could see her recent grave still adorned with memorial flowers. It was a cool, gray Saturday morning and the only sounds were the birds chirping in trees that border the modest cemetery on three sides. The grass was wet. The red clay, unearthed to prepare for her internment, still visible around the gravesite.\n\nI’d come to this hallowed ground to pay my respects to a woman that I never met. To honor and reflect on a woman whose life was more intricately bound to the history of Flat Rock than perhaps almost any other living soul in the Village.\n\nBy the time John Burton was 11 years old, he had dislocated his left elbow six times and undergone three surgeries in an attempt to repair the problematic joint. John’s early medical misfortunes, however, turned out to be a bit of fortuitous fate that helped launch him on a course from the waters of Lake Summit in Tuxedo, NC to the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich, Germany.\n\nGrowing up in Flat Rock wasn’t the most “kid-friendly” place. There was no late-night hang-out spot (because everything closed by 8 pm), there wasn’t a park at that time, and most of the church community was above the age of 65. However, there was one location that brought children of all ages together. A place that inspired and encouraged creativity. A place that drew people in not only from Flat Rock, but Asheville, Hendersonville, Greenville, etc. This place is the great Flat Rock Playhouse, the State Theatre of North Carolina.\n\nBeginning in the 1830s, Flat Rock became a flourishing summer colony as a number of prominent families made an annual trek from the low country of the South Carolina coast to the elevation and cooler temperatures of the mountains of western North Carolina. The tradition of spending summers in Flat Rock has continued for multiple generations and stories of those earlier summers live on in the memories and recollections of Flat Rock residents today.\n\nOne of the more dramatic and violent moments in the history of Flat Rock occurred during the Civil War. Beaumont, owned by Andrew Johnstone of Georgetown, SC, was one of the earliest grand homes in Flat Rock and during the final chaotic year of the war, a band of “bushwhackers” descended upon the estate on a warm June day in 1864 - with tragic consequence.\n\nIn the space of approximately seven years, what started as a dream has become arguably the crown jewel of parks in our region. The Park at Flat Rock is the perfect place to park your cares and lift your spirits. The story of a vision made real, here…\n\nSomewhere along the way, I started paying attention to the rhythm of how the forest turns green and then eventually red, yellow, and orange in Autumn. Every year the wildflowers would return in abundance. They were like brief, annual visits from old friends. By Tim Jones\n\n.\n\nThe history of the Green River people includes many stories of moonlight entrepreneurs amidst exceedingly tough circumstances. As the Depression emerged, the mill-working farmers were forced to turn to moonshining and bootlegging, which thrived in spite of legal and religious condemnation and was a good way to make extra money in a cash-poor economy.\n\nAt a time when it is easy to question the future of humanity, we appreciate this hopeful story of Lilian and Carl Sandburg’s faith in people whose lives were uprooted by racial discrimination and the fear rampant in a county suddenly thrust into World War II.\n\nThe Rosenwald Schools are the inspiring story of two hardworking, successful men who gave back to the country in which they prospered. Conceived by African American educator Booker T. Washington, the Rosenwald School project was a massive effort to improve black rural schooling in the Jim Crow-era South when minority students received vastly inferior education and sometimes no education at all. An effort that eventually reached all the way to East Flat Rock …\n\nAs he stood on the Heidelberg Garden terrace in August of 1921, Robert Galloway placed himself squarely at the intersection of two extraordinary chapters in the history of Flat Rock. Behind him, and representing the past, stood the magnificent structure and intriguing history of Heidelberg House. Stretching out before him was the future … his dream of a spectacular new home for the summer Bible conference of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church.\n\nDave Workman, co-owner of the iconic Flat Rock Village Bakery, maintains a surprisingly low profile at one of the Village’s most high-profile businesses. Despite an unassuming demeanor, he’s quietly building a burgeoning bakery business. And Flat Rock is a primary beneficiary of his passion for serving exceptional food.\n\nHis story here…\n\nThe story begins with an unusual request received at Flat Rock Together from an amateur metal detectorist living in North Carolina. Rebekah wrote. “A fellow metal detectorist acquaintance of mine found a class ring from 1943. Based on the engraved initials and history he believes it may have belonged to someone who lived in Flat Rock. Maybe you can bridge the gap in locating him or a family member.”\n\nBuilt in the mid-19th century, Farmer Hotel was the first summer hotel intended primarily for the accommodation of tourists and vacationists in Henderson County. Through its long and fascinating history, the hotel has served as North Carolina's longest operating inn for 170 years.\n\nThose of us who live in Flat Rock drive past the property on Greenville Highway frequently ... but few of us know its full history. Author, Missy Schneck, tells that story here.\n\nWhen we set out to write this recap of our favorite stories from 2021, it seemed a rather simple enterprise. But as we stroll back through 52 weeks of stories about fascinating people, places, and events in Flat Rock, we came to realize that it is an almost impossible - a perhaps rather arbitrary exercise to choose among so many deserving posts. Nonetheless, here is our list for 2021. Five great stories for another great year of bringing you Flat Rock Together. We hope you enjoy this look back into our archives.\n\nIn 1915 Eleanor Vance and Charlotte Yale, co-founders of Biltmore Estate Industries, left Asheville, N.C. and resettled in Tryon, a small mountain community just 40 miles southeast on the South Carolina border. Already a center for arts and crafts, Tryon became the new home for Vance and Yale’s little non-profit business, the famous Tryon Toy Makers and Wood Carvers. The company focused on two operations; the toy makers created small, painted wooden figurines based on classic nursery rhymes, while the carvers created mantles, furniture, church altars and other specialized wooden pieces.\n\nPacking only what was necessary, Oleksandr and Halyna left Kyiv and headed 30 miles east of central Kyiv and away from the heaviest shelling, seeking refuge at her parent’s home. Although they did not know it at the time, that short journey of just 30 miles was to be the first step on a much longer odyssey leading them to a small village in the mountains of North Carolina - 5,246 miles away.\n\nMountain Lodge — considered to be the first house built by Charlestonians in the Flat Rock settlement — was purchased out of bankruptcy by Historic Flat Rock, Inc. The house was in extremely poor condition due to its age, lack of maintenance, and vandalism. The preservation group submitted an offer from a revolving fund it uses to buy and resell endangered historic properties. Their purpose was to stabilize the house and find a preservation-conscious person to buy it.\n\nThe story of Mountain Lodge’s origin and its ultimate return to glory …\n\nNorth Carolina poet laureate and Henderson County native Robert Morgan wrote of Louise Howe Bailey, “No one has taught us more about our heritage than Louise. She has served as our essential guide to the past, reminding us of our achievements with humor and respect. She has reminded us of who we are, and what she has told us is what we will pass on to our children and future generations.”\n\nThose of us who live in Flat Rock drive past Blue Ridge Fire and Rescue’s Station #2 almost daily. Sitting adjacent to Village Hall and atop “the Great Flat Rock” that gives the village its name, the old substation was renovated last year to add living quarters. As of February 2022, Station 2 is now the home away from home for the dedicated men and women who are committed to keeping area residents safe, healthy, and protected.\n\nThe year 1933 was a very good year for dinosaurs. The movie, King Kong, was released and featured a giant ape captured on an uncharted island inhabited by long-lost dinosaurs. It was also the year of the Chicago World’s Fair which featured animatronic, roaring dinosaurs. The prehistoric creatures even found their way into newspapers around the country via a cartoon strip about a Stone Age caveman and his pet dinosaur, Dinny. The strip was called Alley Oop.\n\nImprobably, that same caveman would later find a home in Flat Rock, NC.\n\nThe character of communities is often shaped and defined by the presence of a handful of seminal figures who have the ability to transform the world around them by sheer force of will and tenacity. For Flat Rock, Robroy Farquhar was clearly one of those individuals.\n\nWhen John Quinley moved to Henderson County in 2006, it was a reunion of sorts. John grew up in Maywood, Illinois just a few blocks from where a young reporter named Carl Sandburg had lived for five years. Half a century later, John found himself once again living close to a Sandburg home. Destiny, one might argue, was calling the life-long educator to revive and retell the story of Carl Sandburg.\n\nFor nearly two centuries the Episcopal Church of St. John in the Wilderness has rested on a wooded knoll in the Village of Flat Rock. What most people likely don’t know is that the building they see today sitting on the corner of Greenville Highway and Rutledge Road is actually the third place of worship to stand on that site.\n\nFor years, the lure of Lake Summit has been water activities and improvising a whole lot of fun. Days were and still are spent in and around the boathouse; a treasured waterfront structure that functions as a building to keep boats and to provide a home base for playing on the lake.\n\nThis Sunday is the final day of one of Flat Rock’s most gracious and beautiful events of the year. The Gallery at Flat Rock is hosting its 7th Annual Art in Bloom - a celebration of ephemeral beauty that pairs professional floral designers with fine artists. The resulting imaginative interpretations of juried artworks result in a spectacular exhibition of creative talent and natural beauty.\n\nIn the summer of 1971, a young college student attended an evening presentation offered by the National Park Service at a campground in the Badlands of South Dakota. During that presentation, she realized that she wanted to be a Park Ranger … and a dream was born.\n\nTwenty-three years later, that student would follow that dream all the way to the job as the Park Superintendent at the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site in Flat Rock North Carolina. It was a position that Connie Hudson Backlund would hold - and cherish - for the next 18 years.\n\nWhen Lance Hiatt and Tim Parks first decided to step away from their professional careers in architecture and luxury retail to pursue their dream of creating a vineyard and winery, it was a daunting proposition to admit. “It was almost embarrassing to tell people that we were going to start a winery in a vineyard,” Lance recalls with a laugh “I couldn't even say it.”\n\nWhen Flat Rock artist Kate Thayer thinks about her painting, she is always mindful of a favorite quote from Andrew Wyeth:\n\n“I can’t work completely out of my imagination. I must put my foot in a bit of truth; and then I can fly free.” — Andrew Wyeth\n\nFor Kate, that foot in a bit of truth involves spending time in the solitude of the woods of western North Carolina. It is in those woods that she encounters the muse that inspires her captivating landscapes.\n\nAs a very young child, Cole Lindsey was working in a commercial kitchen, helping his father at the Highland Lake Restaurant in Flat Rock. Although one might assume that a child would find this work boring and more punishment than opportunity, that was not the case for Cole. He loved being in his father’s kitchen and now, more than three decades later, Cole Lindsey is still happily ensconced in the kitchen.\n\nToday, however, it is his own kitchen where he pursues his passion.\n\nMeagan Lucas’s debut novel, Songbirds & Stray Dogs, tells the story of a young woman named Jolene who arrives in Flat Rock as an outsider and struggles to find her place in her new home.\n\nAlthough the heroine of the book has challenges and struggles her author has never experienced firsthand, Meagan Lucas, who grew up in Canada, certainly understands the feeling of trying to make a new home in the mountains of Western North Carolina.\n\nIn 2020, Luke Hunter was working as property manager for Susie Rindal’s home in Flat Rock. As he helped clear scrub brush in the woods that surrounded her home, Luke noticed something about the contours of the land that evoked memories from his childhood days spent roaming the abandoned rice fields on his grandmother’s land just south of Charleston, SC.\n\nFrom the time she was born, Marty Whaley Adams had a foot in two very different worlds. The first was her Charleston home where she was immersed in a life of gracious creativity by a mother who was an accomplished painter, gardener, and author. The second was at her extended family’s summer home in Flat Rock where her grandmother’s advice to a young granddaughter was simple and direct. “Marty, if you want it, make it.”\n\nReading the playbill for West Side Story at Friday night’s opening, I glance over a listing of the men and women who are the beating heart and soul of Flat Rock Playhouse. They are uniformly talented and dedicated to their craft. Together, they have built the iconic musical from the ground up. And, with few exceptions, they are virtually unknown by the audiences they so routinely thrill, amaze, make laugh, and move to tears.\n\nThis is their story …\n\nPaige walks into the studio 20 seconds before The Breakfast Show goes live. She slides into her studio chair, adjusts the microphone hanging in front of her, and picks up the notes Mark has placed on the counter where she sits. With 5 seconds to spare, she is ready to go. Mark flips on the mic and cues the show’s opener.\n\nAnnouncer: Wake up Sleepy Heads! It’s time for the Breakfast Club … with Mark and Paige!\n\nMark: Good morning, Good morning! It’s 11 minutes after seven in the morning on a fabulous Friday. Good morning, Paige!\n\nPaige: Good morning, my love.\n\nAt a time of day when most of us are fumbling with coffee makers and struggling to formulate anything other than single-syllable sentences, Mark Warwick and Paige Posey are providing their listeners with news, announcements, local interviews, music, trivia, and delightful energy to start a new day in the mountains of western North Carolina.\n\nActors often tell stories of the “big break” that altered the course of their lives and careers. Stories typically involve one last casting call before giving up on their dream, or a chance meeting while struggling to make ends meet as a waiter at a local bistro. For Flat Rock Playhouse Vagabond legend, Scott Treadway, his big moment transpired in a place familiar to anyone that’s ever been to the Playhouse - during the organized chaos of Playhouse parking.\n\nWhen Priscilla Casanova first met her husband Al in Denver, CO, he enjoyed going to the dog tracks to bet on Greyhound races. But while Al was enjoying the races, Priscilla could only think about what became of the dogs when their racing careers were finished.\n\nThat question, her passion for animals, and a long winding road to Flat Rock ultimately resulted in a new local business for Flat Rock …\n\n“St. John in the Wilderness and Flat Rock have stories that are intertwined from their earliest days. Over the decades, both parish and village have grown up and changed, but the connection between St. John and Flat Rock is undeniable. As a parish community, we are overwhelmed with gratitude at the beauty and wonder of this place when we look at Flat Rock and the people who call it home.“\n\nFamily was everything to my father and he lived for us to be together. He promised us that one day we would thank him for his words of wisdom and family rules. He did it for love …. And I loved him for it.\n\nSpend just a couple of minutes chatting with John Wilkerson, Park Ranger for The Park at Flat Rock, and it’s impossible not to come away with one primary impression. He is a good guy. And, to the great benefit of the Village for the past three years, John has been the smiling face and affable presence welcoming thousands of visitors to one of the crown jewels of Flat Rock, NC.\n\nSince the early 1900s, thousands of children have packed their trunks for an annual pilgrimage to summer camps in North Carolina. Camps play a large role in Henderson County and the arrival of camp season draws many families to Flat Rock. Tucked away in the mountains of Western North Carolina are more than 70 summer camps. Flat Rock is home to some of the oldest ones.\n\nMeredith Ward started in the wine business long before she was old enough to purchase a bottle of her family’s signature Saint Paul Mountain Vineyards wine. A little over a decade later, she could not only legally purchase the product but also found herself managing the Saint Paul wine tasting room in Flat Rock, NC.\n\nFlat Rock artist Miriam Hughes is colorful in many ways. She is an artist known for whimsical and vibrant multicolored paintings. She wears bright clothes that complement her shock of wild and curly red hair. And Miriam has a commanding and colorful personality seldom constrained by norms.\n\nPut all those elements together and you have an artist who adds a lot to the kaleidoscope of life in the Village.\n\n“For as long as I can remember just the lights going dark and the overture starting would make all the hairs on my arm stand up. It was like, ‘I don't know where I’m going, and I don't care. But I'm ready!’”\n\nThat magical feeling still keeps Lisa Bryant going, even during challenging times.\n\nMy mother was a genius! When other mothers were fighting the child-war on vegetables, she was working on strategies. Her quick wit coupled with her creative brilliance fed her “think outside of the box” tactics. Somehow my siblings and I did not die from eating these vegetables …\n\nDavid Lawrence Dethero came to Flat Rock in 1971 by way of a family friend, I’on Lowndes. He was born and raised in Cleveland, Tennessee, where I’on also resided and worked with the Park Service. The two were members of St. Luke Episcopal Church and began chatting one day about places to live and opportunities to buy land. I’on’s family had a long history with Flat Rock, NC, and he recommended David give Flat Rock a try – so he did.\n\nSandy Hunter Jones was born with a needle and thread in her hand. When Sandy was only three, her mother spotted her mending Elfie, her stuffed elephant. This young creative prodigy had remarkable dexterity, and she in time developed a lifelong passion for smocking and heirloom sewing. Her story here …\n\nIn December of 2003, Howard Molton was delivering a Christmas gift at WTZQ when he ran into local radio legend, Frank “Hollywood” Johnson. At that time, Hollywood was manager of the Skyland Arts Cinema in Downtown Hendersonville and Howard told him how much he and his wife Barbara loved the cinema. He casually added that he would enjoy doing something like that someday. Hollywood suggested he call the owner and inquire about the possibility of buying the theater…\n\nActors often tell stories of the “big break” that altered the course of their lives and careers. Stories typically involve one last casting call before giving up on their dream, or a chance meeting while struggling to make ends meet as a waiter at a local bistro. For Flat Rock Playhouse Vagabond legend, Scott Treadway, his big moment transpired in a place familiar to anyone that’s ever been to the Playhouse - during the organized chaos of Playhouse parking.\n\nWhen I was in the first grade, I volunteered my mother to be in charge of our class Valentine Party. She was clever and creative – holidays and parties were her forte. They brought to the surface a breed of woman not to be believed …\n\nA Valentine’s Day story from Missy Izard Schenck\n\nAs the original group of about 50 former slaves traveled northward through Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, news of their crusade spread, and their numbers grew to about 200 people. Upon reaching S.C., the entourage met with freed slaves who spoke of families from the “Lowcountry” who made annual pilgrimages to the high country where miles of uninhabited mountain wilderness existed. Led by a dream, the caravan of former slaves set out on the Buncombe Turnpike for North Carolina — the possible end to their questing pilgrimage.\n\nTheir quest was to take them to an intersection in history with the family of John Davis, one of Henderson County’s earliest settlers.\n\nIn a few short weeks, spring will arrive once again at the Carl Sandburg Home here in Flat Rock. Forsythia will begin blooming on the bushes near the house. Daffodils will dance in the grass, and baby goats will start emerging from the barn sporting jaunty colorful sweaters. We can thank Lilian Steichen, Carl’s wife, for this annual spring treat.\n\nIn the last decade, the data has been piling up, revealing a Native American culture over 10,000 years old. The evidence of Native Americans at Green River Preserve is extensive. There are petroglyphs on Long Rock, bivouacs throughout GRP, a fault line where an ancient rock quarry is located, many lithic scatters on the surface from flint knapping, and points dating from 10,000 BC to 500 years ago. Additionally, there is Native American pottery, a 5000-year-old Native American fire ring 2 feet below the surface, dwelling sites along the Green River, evidence of long-distance trade, and more.\n\nAfter just a few moments of talking to Anna Kimmell about her new job as Director of Education at Flat Rock Playhouse, it becomes readily apparent that, to the extent that enthusiasm, energy, and a positive outlook are predictors of success, the Playhouse has the right woman on the job.\n\nWhen I asked them about 2022, Annika spoke of her new life and career in Spartanburg and the chance to nurture blossoming friendships. I turned to Chris and asked him if he thought 2022 would be a good year for him. He sat in silence for a moment and then flashed a smile that presaged the coming surprise.\n\nElaine Thompson loves Christmas. It was her mother’s favorite holiday and a decorating feast every year for her family. It is a tradition Elaine happily carries on at Dunroy, the historic home she and her husband, Michael, own in Flat Rock. Elaine’s mother had a saying in their childhood home when the Christmas season began: “If you don’t move quickly enough, you’ll be decorated too.”\n\nChristmas 1993 will always go down in history as one of the best in our family. The path that was set almost thirty years ago remains at the core of Christmas for all of us – out of hand, out of heart.\n\nAs it turns out, the onset of a pandemic can be an opportune time to launch a new ministry. When St. John in the Wilderness struggled to find ways for church members to stay connected during the lockdown, parish member Cynthia Easterling and Father Josh Stephens discussed the possibility of doing something outdoors. The result was an unconventional way to do church and to honor the historic church's wilderness legacy.\n\nA person’s true legacy is much more than the outward trappings of success traditionally celebrated in our culture. There is a case to be made for defining a person’s legacy as “acts of kindness done well, and without expectation of reward or recognition, that find a special place in people's hearts and that are the most important.”\n\nBy this latter definition, Mike Sollum and Don Hubbs left a legacy both impressive and transformational.\n\nSunday night, November 28, 2021 was a wake-up call for the Village of Flat Rock. A fire that erupted early that evening on one of the historic properties of the community could easily have destroyed the entire estate had it not been for neighbors and the prompt response of the Blue Ridge Fire Department.\n\nThanks to the dedication and passion of four women entrepreneurs, our small village of Flat Rock is blessed with unusually diverse and intriguing options for holiday shopping. Within the space of a short walk in downtown Flat Rock, shoppers will find an enchanting assortment of crafts, apparel, jewelry, gifts, fine art, and warm smiles as they seek out that perfect gift for the special people in their lives.\n\nMuch of the early religious significance of Thanksgiving has been lost and it now centers on cooking and sharing a bountiful meal with family and friends. Over the years most families have developed some traditions associated with Turkey Day, from the food served to the pre and post-feast activities. My personal favorite is the pine cone turkey with colored construction paper feathers … by Missy Izard Schenck\n\nThe community of East Flat Rock is east of the Flat Rock community; therefore, it was named East Flat Rock in the early 1900s. It is and was an area of bogs and wetlands, with numerous small creeks flowing into Bat Fork Creek. Bat Fork Creek then flows into Mud Creek. East Flat Rock was one of the earliest towns in the county.\n\nThe community was sparsely settled prior to the late 1800s and early 1900s. Until machinery was invented and purchased that could drain the bogs, making much of the area suitable for farming, early settlers found farming in the area difficult. In the first 100 or so years of county settlement, the community was considered a part of Flat Rock and the Upward community.\n\nWhen the antique beauty of Flat Rock was threatened in the 1960s with the demolition of two historic properties and the burning of another, a nonprofit organization was formed with the purpose of helping to protect as much as possible of the community’s unique character and the preservation of the area’s historic sites and values. This organization was named Historic Flat Rock, Inc.\n\nAlthough still a relatively young man, Michael Dages has managed to cram an impressive volume of experience with parks and outdoor activities into his 27 years.

More often than not, what qualified for a road was a single-track Native American footpath, a “trace,” or paths left by wildlife. Passible by nothing more than a horse and rider, these primitive roads were treacherous trails cutting through gorges and across mountain peaks. As time passed, many of these early pathways evolved into wagon roads, paved roads and even highways, some of which survive today, at least in part, along their original courses.\n\nLabor Day beckons those feelings that wash over me when another summer nears its end. I’ve tasted the saudade of life; the yearning for my childhood when the days would merge into one another and the passing of time was of no consequence. Labor Day reminds me that it’s time for school to begin and camp to be over. The Peter Pan in me is tormented by the exit from my favorite season that allows me to never grow up.\n\nSuzanne was in the middle of nowhere, with no cell service, and no idea on how to extricate her vehicle from the ditch. As she stood by the side of the road contemplating her dilemma, an emaciated brown puppy suddenly appeared out of the nearby woods. The young dog clearly needed help, and it seemed the puppy had decided that Suzanne was just the person for the job.\n\nAlexander Campbell King III related wonderful stories of growing up at Argyle, a family home with the distinction of having the longest continuous possession in the same family of any place in Flat Rock, perhaps in all of Western North Carolina. His people have owned it since 1830. The house felt alive with history. I could almost hear it humming as Mr. King told tales of family picnics, fishing at the dam, and swinging on the porch with his grandmother…\n\nLocal artist, Marsha Hammel, has spent a lifetime capturing the essence of life that swirls and dances around each of us, in moments both exceptional and ordinary.

A life of art and music.\n\nOn any given Monday morning, you are likely to find Wendy Beville and Gina Moffitt happily digging in the dirt, pulling out uninvited weeds, and gently pruning a riot of colorful plants which populate the garden. Wendy and Gina are the Master Gardener Group Co-Chairs for the Pollinator Garden at The Park at Flat Rock. To put it another way - and much more succinctly - they and their compatriots work hard and the results are spectacular.\n\nWhen Cam Boyd’s family purchased Flat Rock’s historic Saluda Cottages in 1955, Cam was just 11 years old and not particularly pleased with the move. His life of riding bikes and playing sports with a crowd of neighborhood kids was no longer in the cards. But as is so often the case, change can be both good and bad. “Growing up in Flat Rock was a mixed blessing,” Cam recalls now. “I did not realize how lucky I was until later in life.”\n\nA very common question from visitors to Flat Rock concerns the exact location of the expanse of rock for which the Village is named. If they are standing anywhere near the intersection of Little River Road and Greenville Highway, you might just suggest they look under their feet for the answer.\n\nThe origin of the Village’s name has been addressed by several notable Flat Rock and Henderson County historians through the years.\n\nThe very best part of writing the Good News posts for Flat Rock Together is the opportunity to learn more about the most interesting people, places, and events in Flat Rock.\n\nHere is a look back at five of our favorite stories from 2020.

Ultimately, we came up with these five and hope you enjoy reliving some of the very best moments from Flat Rock Together in 2020…\n\nMy great grandmother’s recipe haunts our family. It’s not exactly comfort food. You either like it or you don’t. It’s loaded with whiskey and ferments in the basement until it is ripe. The historic Christmas cake is actually edible for up to 25 years after it is made!\n\nJosh Stephens did not grow up in the mountains. As a child, he was raised by surfing parents and spent a significant portion of his youth with an eye towards the sea. “The ocean was where we might lose ourselves” he explains. “Riding waves or simply being humbled by the ocean's beauty and power. I still have this deep need to get outside in one way or another and to be in beautiful and wild places.”\n\nNow that we have finished with Thanksgiving, many of us will start to think about our Holiday shopping. Fortunately, Flat Rock is replete with wonderful options for purchasing gifts for family and friends. Here are some ideas to help you get started.\n\nBack when European settlers first came to Southern Appalachia, wild turkeys were plentiful. By the early 1900s, however, only a few were left, a decline that continued into the mid-century. The restoration of this iconic species is considered one of the greatest conservation success stories in the world.\n\nWhen Tom Fisch was 10 years old, he won a guitar in a raffle at a local high school bazaar. That guitar became the first stepping stone on a long and winding musical path that led him from his hometown of Albany, NY, to Nashville in pursuit of a childhood dream, and ultimately to Flat Rock and a career as a modern-day minstrel bringing entertainment and smiles to the mountains of western North Carolina. His story here …\n\nOn Friday night at 7:01, Grace stepped out of the kitchen and handed me the year’s very last order from the Hubba Hubba Smokehouse kitchen.

Spherical Trigonometry and Organic Chemistry helped convinced me that I didn't want to be an engineer.” Fifty years on from that hard life lesson, Cornell’s loss has turned out to be a significant gain for Flat Rock, NC.\n\nThe alarm goes off at 2:45 am. I crawl out of bed and stumbled around in the dark bedroom trying to get dressed without waking my wife. No dice. “You’re crazy,” she mutters as she pulled the sheets closer and turns over. “At least bring home something tasty.”\n\nFate - as it is often want to do - soon stepped in and opened a door to Karen’s dream. While driving through “downtown” Flat Rock one day, Mike and Karen noticed that there was a commercial space available for rent next to the Flat Rock Post Office. They immediately made an appointment to see the space and the rest is, as they say, history.\n\nThe program started small with just eight children at Flat Rock Middle School. Originally, the group would literally pack the children’s backpacks with food.

Both children of immigrants, Polly and Carl struck out on life-changing odysseys as young adults after relatively cloistered childhoods. They experienced the breadth and majesty of America and witnessed first-hand the tapestry of the human condition.\n\nA chance encounter with a historic marker started the creative wheels turning in his head and Sullivan’s creative focus turned back to something that had fascinated him since he was a boy. At this point, his early fascination with the Civil War, his interest in wargaming, his corporate experience helping individuals and groups resolve thorny issues, and his relocation to Henderson County all coalesced into a remarkable premise for a new book. An idea that could only be called, “Audacious.”\n\nIn 2010, life served up a bowl of lemons to Flat Rock resident Bill Moss. After 12 award-winning years as Executive Editor of the Hendersonville Times-News, Bill found himself as the central character and most prominent casualty in a story about corporate downsizing at the county’s largest paper.\n\nTwo years later Bill picked himself up off the floor from an unexpected career detour …\n\nLauna’s great-grandmother Marie brought her gift for pasta making to the United States, and she lived long enough to have a profound effect on her great-grandaughter. “My earliest memory of my great-grandma was running into her kitchen to find noodles hanging from wooden sticks,” says Launa. “I thought it was the most beautiful and magical thing in the world. Today if I close my eyes, that memory is just as vibrant.”\n\nIf you happen to be new to our beautiful village, you may be wondering where on earth some of these odd names came from.

And the fire of that passion was fueled with wood. During that time Starr attended a French Classical cooking school in Paris.

I was free to leave St. Louis!”\n\nAt the end of the day, no one is getting rich at the Flat Rock Farmers Market.
