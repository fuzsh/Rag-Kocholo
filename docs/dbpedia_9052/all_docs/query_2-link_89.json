        "text": "American singer (born 1968)\n\nFor the actress, see Paula Cale.\n\nMusical artist\n\nPaula Dorothy Cole (born April 5, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter and producer.[2] After gaining attention for her performances as a vocalist on Peter Gabriel's 1993â€“1994 Secret World Tour, she released her first album, Harbinger, which suffered from a lack of promotion when the label, Imago Records, folded shortly after its release. Her second album, This Fire (1996), brought her worldwide acclaim, peaking at number 20 on the Billboard 200 album chart and producing two hit singles, the triple-Grammy nominated \"Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?\", which reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1997, and \"I Don't Want to Wait\", which was used as the theme song of the television show Dawson's Creek. Cole was a featured performer in the 1996 prototype mini-tour for Lilith Fair,[3] and also was a headliner for Lilith Fair in 1997[4] and 1998.[5] She won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1998, and also became the first woman ever to be nominated for \"Producer of the Year\" in her own right in that same year.[2]"
