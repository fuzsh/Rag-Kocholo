        "text": "Graham Lienhart\n\nARNOLD'S\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nVenus Mission (Cincinnati)\n\nPop/Rock\n\nVenus Mission resurfaced last year with their newest album, Love Me Back Alive, produced by Ric Hordinski (formerly of Over the Rhine) and engineered by John Curley (ex-Afghan Whigs) and featuring local artists such as Abiyah and Swift (4-Track Allstars). In 2003 they were nominated for three local Cammy awards for work on their first release, Midwestern Soul.\n\nYou'll Dig It If You Dig: Suzanne Vega partnered with sexy. (Daniele Pfarr)\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nLeslie Clemmons (New York, N.Y.)\n\nAdult Alternative/Pop\n\nHailing from New Orleans and now based in the Big Apple, Clemmons has such versatility as a singer it's hard to pin her down from one song to the next. Sometimes jazzy, sometimes poppy, sometimes folksy, sometimes almost Neo Soul-like, Clemmons' debut, Stop the World, had a strong run at AAA radio; her recently released follow-up, Waiting for My Conviction (out earlier this year and co-created with her husband) has had similar success, garnering airplay from over 80 stations across the country.\n\nDig It: The idea of Norah Jones, India.Arie and Paula Cole starting a supergroup. (Mike Breen)\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nDave Hawkins (Cincinnati)\n\nAmericana\n\nOver the past quarter century, Hawkins has been a bandleader (primarily with Celtic Core) and solo artist, contributing to over a dozen recordings and five solo albums, including his latest, Manchester Mornings. His mastery of a number of diverse styles, including Celtic, Folk and Rock, has allowed him to open for everyone from Tom Rush to Ian Anderson to Peter Yarrow.\n\nDig It: John Prine conjuring the spirits of Harry Chapin and Steve Goodman for a storytelling Folk s√©ance. (Brian Baker)\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nThe Muses (Jamestown, Colo.)\n\nCeltic/Folk\n\nThe Muses consists of Tanya Brody and Matthew Gumsey, two great vocalists who, between them, can play just about any traditional Celtic musical instrument you can imagine (concertina, bowed psaltery, bodhran, hammered dulcimer, harp, etc.).\n\nThe duo's vibrant reinterpretation of old songs (mixed with a handful of originals) has landed them gigs all over the country, playing everywhere from pubs and weddings to libraries and festivals.\n\nDig It: Well-played traditional Irish/Scottish Folk songs, dudes in kilts. (MB)\n\nBLUE WISP\n\n9 p.m.\n\nCarolynn Black (Madison, Wisc.)\n\nFolk/Rock\n\nBlack's gritty, everything-on-the-table vocal style hasn't come without a cost; she recently announced that she'll need surgery to remove some polyps on her vocal chords (don't worry: Steven Tyler from Aerosmith recently had similar surgery and it was a success). After playing in various bands in the New York City area, Black moved to Wisconsin a couple of years ago and got deep into the local music scene, playing Blues, R&B, Funk and Neo Soul with local luminaries. She now has her own Carolynn Black Band, which brings together all of her influences for a rockin', self-described \"chicken-fried Folk\" sound.\n\nDig It: The ballsiness of Janis Joplin, Bonnie Raitt, Joss Stone without the gloss. (MB)\n\n10 p.m.\n\nBlue News (Terre Haute, Ind.)\n\nAlternative/Blues\n\nBlue News is a fairly young band, but its members are no strangers to the music scene. Lead singer and guitarist Brent Orndorff has 13 years of involvement with bands and he studied Classical Guitar Performance and Music History at Indiana State. Their debut album was released by Statue Records Hollywood earlier this year, and they're currently working on a follow-up EP.\n\nDig It: Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's Howl, Jack Johnson covering The White Stripes. (DP)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nKim Monroe (Syracuse, N.Y.)\n\nPop\n\nThis small-town girl is singing about things she's discovered after leaving home to venture into the big world. She's getting quite a lot of press lately with her 2006 release, New Reality (which she'll be promoting at MPMF). She received an honorable mention in the Billboard Songwriter's Contest for her song \"Where is the Man\" from her debut disc, and she won a 2005 SAMMY (Syracuse Area Music Award) for best R&B recording.\n\nDig It: Jessica Simpson singing about things that matter. (DP)\n\n12 a.m.\n\nSonny Moorman Group (Cincinnati)\n\nBlues/Rock\n\nOne of the area's most popular and hardest working bands, the Sonny Moorman Group has been rocking the regional Blues scene for a dozen years now. Nominated for multiple local music awards and accolades (and winning several), the virtuosic trio has also drawn attention outside of the region with several CD releases, including last year's rock-solid Crossroads Motel. Moorman and bandmates show an intense versatility, as the songwriting encompasses everything from soulful balladry to gruff, rip-roaring rumblers, all performed with equal intensity and personalized flair.\n\nDig It: Early ZZTop, Allman Brothers, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers. (MB)\n\nCHAMBER'S\n\n9 p.m.\n\nThe Wankers (Covington)\n\nRock/Punk\n\nThis band's sound is the epitome of genre mixing. It's really got a bit of everything, infused with a sensational take on what a stage show is really about. \"Fun\" will sum it up nicely. Their 2004 release, No Need for a Solo ... It's Back to Basics, is 15 tracks of high-energy Rock & Roll.\n\nDig It: Operation Ivy and Mustard Plug on a surfboard with a strand of hay sticking out of their mouths. (DP)\n\n10 p.m.\n\nLuxury Pushers (Dayton, Ohio)\n\nRock\n\nRock? Punk? Both? Huh? Whatever you decide, you'll be thrashing your head around and chanting with the band. Their debut EP, Eat It, earned an Adult Video News Award \"Best Soundtrack\" nomination for its use in Guy Capo's adult film, Sex, Drugs & Rock-n-Roll. Now that's Punk Rock.\n\nDig It: Dillinger Four, Screeching Weasel. (DP)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nThe Senate (Detroit)\n\nRock/Punk\n\nWell, with everything going on in the world and this country right now, I don't see why The Senate would take time out of its busy schedule to come to Cincinnati for a freakin' music festival. I mean, it's election season and all, but ... oh, wait. This Senate rocks! With a ragged, scruffy Punk edge devoid of the wussy trappings of Emo, they're a trio from the Motor City who released an EP earlier this year that's available for free download on their Web site. Would your elected state official ever do that?\n\nDig It: DC Punk, Post-Hardcore, a Senate that actually gets shit done. (MB)\n\n12 a.m.\n\nEighty Sixed (Hamilton, Ohio)\n\nPunk\n\nFor the past four years, Eighty Sixed has been playing blistering Punk while roaringly drunk or a good approximation thereof. In the tradition of mid '70s British Punks who changed the world a pint and a piss at a time, they storm the stage, drink the joint dry and play loud until the cops show up. Convert or suffer the consequences.\n\nDig It: Black Flag on Black Label, Samhain on Sam Adams, Fear on Foster's (punk and alcohol, get it?). (BB)\n\nCLUB DREAM\n\n9 p.m.\n\nEVER-G (Hampton, Va.)\n\nReggae\n\nEVER-G (born Everett G. Streete) is a Reggae singer/songwriter/guitarist, but he's no yankee-come-lately. He was raised in Jamaica listening to local heroes like Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. After doing his first recording session (at Marley's Tuff Gong studio), EVER-G relocated to the U.S., fronting the Reggae outfit Children of Jah. His music isn't weighted down with modern day concessions; refreshingly, it's a pure throwback to old-school, socially conscious Roots Reggae and Lover's Rock, with supple rhythms, strong lead vocals and perfect background harmonies.\n\nDig It: Skatalites, The Wailers, Jah. (MB)\n\n10 p.m.\n\nBroadcast Live (Albany, N.Y.)\n\nHip Hop/Rap\n\nYou know you're in for a good ride when a band namechecks influences like the Last Poets, Public Enemy and Rage Against the Machine and follows them with Emma Goldman, Malcolm X and Steve Biko. Broadcast Live is a Hip Hop collective out of Albany with a social agenda every bit as impassioned and revolutionary as their musical imperative. Dance and think.\n\nDig It: The far left editorial page as read by The Coup and Michael Franti. (BB)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nThe Lab Rats (Columbus, Ohio)\n\nHip Hop/Indie Rock\n\nTalk about your cool hybrids. The Lab Rats work an amazing groove informed by the jammed-out Riff Rock of MC Brian Brown on electric guitar and the mad breakbeats and electronic touches of DJ Kelly Warner, a multi-instrumentalist with two turntables and a microphone (and a pedal steel and keys and congas). With Brown's suburban-weary songs of everyday frustration and Warner's broadly whacked musical accompaniment, the Lab Rats will be your new favorite experiment, particularly with their about-to-be-released new album, Half Full Ashtrays, Half Empty Glasses.\n\nDig It: Local H and the Beasties kickin' it with Jay-Z and Eminem. (Brian Baker)\n\n12 a.m.\n\nIll Phil Carnage (New York, N.Y.)\n\nRap/Rock\n\nInspired by equal parts Hard Rock and early '90s Hip Hop, Brooklyn-born/Staten Island-based MC Ill Phil Carnage is out to show that the hybrid wasn't forever destroyed by Fred Durst. With his crew, The Suga' Shack (named for the label Carnage started after college), the MC is looking for the kind of crossover success experienced by Cypress Hill and House of Pain. With pounding, powerhouse beats (blended with plenty of blazing guitar riffs), Carnage and crew regularly give the kind of performances that command full audience participation, no matter what the crowd members' musical tastes are.\n\nDig It: Biohazard, Onyx, the Judgment Night soundtrack, Kid Rock when he was a rapper. (MB)\n\nCOOPER'S ON MAIN\n\n9 p.m.\n\nShades of Day (Ojai, Calif.)\n\nRock\n\nShades of Day began in 2000 as an unnamed pick-up band, gigged the SoCal college scene and got their chops together. From 2002 to 2004, SOD converted bassist Micha McCabe's family barn into a rehearsal space/studio and then worked for two years on their debut album, Mayday! Fun fact: SOD lead vocalist Brendan James' father, Bob James, replaced Sammy Hagar when he left Montrose for a solo career.\n\nDig It: The thunder of Led Zeppelin, the lightning of Pearl Jam, the rain of Pink Floyd, the wind of Neil Young. (BB)\n\n10 p.m.\n\nEmerson Rose (Indianapolis)\n\nRock\n\nIn much the same way that the Black Crowes took the root influence of The Faces and then contemporized and colored it through their own unique filter, Indianapolis' Emerson Rose channels the blazing riffage and cloudbusting vocals of classic era Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith and Thin Lizzy into their own dynamic presentation. Emerson Rose's frenetic live shows have earned the quintet a slavish following at home, and now they're taking their Rock on the road.\n\nDig It: Neo Classic Rock and amps that go to 11. (BB)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nJohn Evans Band (Houston)\n\nRock\n\nProudly playing \"straight-up Rock & Roll,\" the John Evans Band recently released an album where, they say, no two songs sound alike. That makes it pretty far from \"straight-up,\" in my book, but who the hell am I? Evans counts influences ranging from Queen to The Ramones and it must be working for him, because he's scored several songwriting and vocalist awards from the Houston Press.\n\nDig It: Heavy Metal Country? Punk Rockabilly? The sound of a random spin of the radio dial in a town with 50 really cool radio stations. (MB)\n\n12 a.m.\n\nLavender Drags (Cincinnati)\n\nRock\n\nLavender Drags (formerly greatmodern) have honed in on a '70s vibe. They even look the part. After recently moving from a basement studio space to a real life practice space, the band is ready to start recording the demos that are long overdue. It's a classic sound with haunting harmonies that rock and will have you wondering if you stepped back in time.\n\nDig It: An on-key Neil Young without the politics. (DP)\n\nCOURTYARD CAFE\n\n9 p.m.\n\nPeal (Indianapolis)\n\nPop/Rock\n\nWith an acoustic base and a knack for compact, direct Pop songs, this Indy quartet formed in 2003 out of the ashes of two bands that were on their last legs. The groups were doing gigs at Ball State when the future bandmates bumped into each other and the idea for Peal was hatched. The band admits they don't break any unexcavated ground with their debut release, Beautiful Baby Elephant, but their directness has helped them start to build a loyal fanbase, which they add to with numerous regional tour dates. The disc was recently chosen by Paste Magazine to be a part of their \"Paste Recommends\" program, which put Elephant in listening stations all across the country.\n\nDig It: Gin Blossoms, Sister Hazel, Toad the Wet Sprocket. (MB)\n\n10 p.m.\n\nKelp (Cincinnati)\n\nRock\n\nThe five members of Kelp had their own thing going, all very different things, when fate did her twisted thing and the band was formed. Their backgrounds stem from Rock, Cabaret, Jazz, cover groups and Jam bands. Their influences are distinct, ranging from Cheap Trick to Nick Cave to Talking Heads. They're out to get the crowd jumpin' and see no other reason to play music.\n\nDig It: Pat Benatar, Blondie, Cheap Trick. (DP)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nTracy Walker (Cincinnati)\n\nSinger/Songwriter\n\nWith a slew of awards and accomplishments under her belt, Tracy Walker has proven herself an established musician in the city of Cincinnati. She has won two Cincinnati Entertainment Awards, was voted Best Local Musician in CityBeat's \"Best Of Cincinnati\" issue and received another CEA nomination in 2002. Walker has released several albums' worth of soulful, acoustic-based Folk/Pop.\n\nDig It: Tracy Chapman, Ani DiFranco. (DP)\n\n12 a.m.\n\nCommon Shiner (Grand Rapids, Mich.)\n\nAcoustic Rock\n\nNamed for a plentiful species of fish indigenous to the Midwest and Northeast, Common Shiner plays a hybridized style that begins with Morgan Foster's acoustic guitar out front then folds in elements of Rock, Punk, Folk, Pop and Jazz for good measure. Lyrically and musically, Common Shiner can be smirkingly humorous or heartbreakingly melancholy; either way, the fun they're having is plainly evident.\n\nDig It: Dave Matthews and Pearl Jam partying with Barenaked Ladies (the band, not the unclothed noun). (BB)\n\nCRUSH\n\n9 p.m.\n\notis (Erie, Pa.)\n\nFunk/Prog\n\nThe whole Rock duo thing got a little redundant after the White Stripes make a boatload of cash on it. But, to their credit, new duos are popping up all the time with varying instrumentation and approaches. Perhaps none are as unique as otis, a Prog two-piece from Pennsylvania that's making its third trip to MidPoint this year. As noted previously, they're world's smallest Prog band, but they fill the space inventively, with explosive percussion and flamboyant, string-rattling bass playing, topped with the quirkiest of vocals and song structures that keep you guessing at every turn.\n\nDig It: Les Claypool, dizzying bass-playing pyro-techniques and equally captivating drumming. (MB)\n\n10 p.m.\n\nLonely the Seabird (Cincinnati)\n\nIndie Rock\n\nWhat if Munch's paintings were actually photographs? What if factories just made other factories? What if your knees bent the other way? What if everyone knew the Colonel's secret recipe? What if there really is a Book of Love? What if everyone's 15 minutes of fame included a Devo soundtrack? What if trees made the wind blow? What if tinfoil hats really worked?\n\nDig It: The artful melodicism of Pere Ubu, the dissonant Pop of Talking Heads. (BB)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nThe Villains (Dayton, Ohio)\n\nAlternative Rock\n\nThey just released their first full-length album, Six Volt Glow, in April and lead singer and guitarist John Weimer probably has angels and the Rat Pack in his tears right now. He channels the crooners flawlessly, while Jack Wiley (bass), Thomas Salvatierra (organ) and Paul Kennedy (drums) back him up with that Indie Rock vibe the kids are lovin' today.\n\nDig It: Frank Sinatra replaces Chris Martin in Coldplay. (DP)\n\n12 a.m.\n\nHierophant (Cincinnati)\n\nProgressive/Indie/Rock\n\nThe origins of this quartet of Cincinnati music vets involves aliens and barbecue chicken. What more do you need to know? Well, Hierophant are \"Progressive,\" but not in the bloated, \"look-how-big-my-drum-kit-is\" way the term might infer. The band's full-length debut, Popular Astronomy, features wandering, epic song structures, but they never meander, infusing a wide-range of Post-Punk, Hard Rock, Indie Pop, Glam, Blues, Electronica and whatever style that's within arm's reach, but never sounding distractingly over-the-top or Mr. Bungle-esque. Come for the barbecue, stay for the uncategorizable Rock!\n\nDig It: Bands who can unannoyingly sound like a totally different entity on practically every other song. (MB)\n\nTHE EXCHANGE\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nPhilpot (Dugger, Ind.)\n\nRock\n\nIndiana sextet Philpot, whose average ages nearly match the current drinking age, comes from the same rural area that spawned young Axl Rose a few years ago, so perhaps it's no surprise that Zink Magazine hailed Philpot vocalist Kentz Ward as the greatest frontman since Rose (they threw in Kurt Cobain as well). Heady praise indeed. Is Philpot sowing the seeds of the new Classic Rock? See for yourself.\n\nDig It: The classicism of The Beatles, Doors and Led Zeppelin and the neo-classicism of Blur, R.E.M. and Oasis. (BB)\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nNoctaluca (Cincinnati)\n\nAlternative Rock\n\nGrand AltRock with a Prog bent, Noctaluca was formed by singer/songwriter/guitarist Jason Ludwig, who desired a full-band experience after releasing his solo album, PeLL MeLL in 2003. Ludwig's passionate, unpredictable yet charismatic writing style fit well in the new full-band format, as the top-notch players (bassist Donovan Schlunt, drummer Brandon Schlunt and guitarist Jay Aronoff) showed the versatility and creative input to flow perfectly within Ludwig's entrancing, unique style. The band released its first album, Towering the Sum, several months ago.\n\nDig It: The more hypnotic side of Zeppelin, Jam bands that don't meander without purpose. (MB).\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nAether (Columbus, Ohio)\n\nRock\n\nAether's (pronounced \"ether\") 2005 EP release Apart includes tracks featured in an independent short film and a \"Best of Columbus\" compilation album. During their live shows, there are video loops projected behind the band while they are playing, all compiled by the band members themselves. Aether is very aesthetically pleasing. Yeah, I went there.\n\nDig It: A less schizophrenic Radiohead calmed by The Cure. (DP)\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nBel Auburn (Ashland, Ohio)\n\nAlternative/Pop\n\nThis Indie rockin' five-piece have been kicking it for the past three or so years, releasing the LP Cathedrals in 2004 and earning some fans through on-line critical praise. The band is currently pimping a \"double EP\" (or, as I like to call it, an album) called Lullabies in A & C.\n\nDig It: Snow Patrol, pre-insanity Radiohead, Muse. (MB)\n\nGUIDO'S CORNER TAP\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nFire on Your Sleeve (Milwaukee)\n\nIndie\n\nLead singer Ryan Matzen has a voice that will intrigue, and the sounds that are produced can't be pinpointed to one particular genre. If you want to hear kick-ass guitar riffs, yell for them to play \"Coast to Coast\" and see what the fuss is about. Their sound is a fusion that ranges from Folk, Country, Rock and, least of all, Alternative. They're a get-your-drink-on band, for sure. Perfect to start off the night.\n\nDig It: Tom Waits before he lost his vocal chords. (DP)\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nSpielerfrau (Brooklyn, N.Y.)\n\nIndie\n\nGetting online Indie 'zine Pitchfork to say an album is great is about as rare as getting George Bush to admit he's made mistakes. But even the black hearts at Pitchfork couldn't resist Spielerfrau's recently released, The Sad Part, which they recently compared to the moody, deep-soul masterworks of Nick Cave and Scott Walker. The band was formed just a couple of years ago, when Russian expat Michael Idov recorded a five-song demo with Martin Bisi, known for his work with Swans and The Dresden Dolls. Idov formed a band around the demo, and they went to work on The Sad Part, a smoky, smoldering collection of woozy, darkly sexy ballads and low-key anthems that recall Leonard Cohen in both their poetry and tone. The album's first review came from none other than The New Yorker and more critical fawning began pouring in. Spielerfrau, whose name means \"trophy wife,\" hit the road in support of the album and will take it international next month when Idov returns to Russia, playing shows in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\nDig It: Tindersticks, The National, Pulp. (Mike Breen)\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nSide Show! (Dayton, Ohio)\n\nFunk/Rock\n\nIf you're coming to MidPoint to dance, make sure you check out this trio, which mixes progressive, turbo-charged Punk with a deep, wild-eyed groove. The Dayton press has noted the group's crazed, party-starting musical antics, but the band seems more proud of how their fans describe them ‚Äî in lieu of a \"bio,\" the group offers testimonials from their Side Show! freaks, including claims that the band is \"punky, funky but not junky.\" Another fan says they \"heave your hospitable body in ways that would make a hardcore pornographer blush.\" As long as they want to cuddle afterwards, we're in.\n\nDig It: Chili Peppers getting back to their Punk and drugs roots, Funkadelic jamming with The Cramps. (MB)\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nOxymoronatron (Dayton, Ohio)\n\nSynth Pop\n\nIf Devo's philosophy was based on the de-evolution of man, the Oxymoronatron manifesto is rooted in the idea that man and robot can live and rock side by side (and sometimes within the same body) as one. Their bios are more about when they were built than born, and there's a whole back story concerning Mad Robots and government conspiracies and ninja assassins and robotic limbs and the Subway diet. Bring your oil can to the show ... I'll bet they'd appreciate it.\n\nDig It: Kraftwerk retooled with 12 Rods. (BB)\n\nJ HALL\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nYellow Delicious (Cleveland)\n\nRetro Rock\n\nCleveland's Yellow Delicious has been playing full throttle '70s/'80s-fueled Rock without a shred of irony for the past eight years. For proof, there's the fact that Little Steven handpicked YD as one of the entries for the Cleveland installment of his Underground Garage Battle of the Bands competition. For further evidence, there's YD's infectious and raucous Get Some album and the breathless state it inspires in fans.\n\nDig It: A connect-the-dots drawing that shows The Beatles having drinks with Elvis Costello and The Cars. (BB)\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nalmost free (Sterling Heights, Mich.)\n\nRock\n\nMaking slinky, sunshiney Pop and grinding Rock with an emphasis on groove, this Michigan foursome claims a love of everything from Pixies and The Mars Volta to Miles Davis and Yes. Someone called them \"Expressionistic Pop,\" and they must've liked that because it's on their Web sites. The band has been playing for about a year and has one self-titled EP under its belt.\n\nDig It: Apples In Stereo do a Grateful Dead set. (MB)\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nThe Big Tease (Knoxville, Tenn.)\n\nPop/Rock\n\nI can't resist including this line from the bio of these Knoxville Post Punk hipsters: \"(They) are much more interested in the farmer's daughter than the farm.\" Well, you just might get lucky, ya big flirts, but for reasons you might not expect. It's not your bedhead-meets-suitcoat style (although we admit that's cute). It's because your tireless genre-jumping and catchy Dream Pop (with horns!) are downright infectious. It reminds us of when Rock was fun. Makes us wanna break curfew.\n\nDig It: Yellowcard, Jimmy Eat World and some Quentin Tarantino. (Hannah Roberts)\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nChaselounge (Cincinnati)\n\nPop/Rock\n\nTouring in support of their 2005 release, Black Plastic Ordinary (produced by Erwin Musper), these boys have a very distinct sound that's grabbing college students everywhere. They signed with Yes Yeah Productions and have two records under their belt, with their debut release (Mayday, Roger the Radio) being in the Top 200 on the CMJ charts for several weeks. Their extensive touring and radioplay over the past few years has garnered the attention of many fans beyond the Midwest.\n\nDig It: Elvis Presley singing with Alkaline Trio as his backup band. (DP)\n\nJEKYLL & HYDE'S 2ND FLOOR\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nRed Dahlia (Athens, Ohio)\n\nIndie Garage Rock\n\nRed Dahlia features the haunting vocals of frontwoman Jodi Toledo drifting through the powerful yet ephemeral sonic landscape provided by her guitarist/husband Matt Toledo and the rest of her moodily inspired bandmates. Red Dahlia's emotional live presentation has been described as \"three people undergoing therapy.\" They agree.\n\nDig It: Josh Homme and P.J. Harvey reinventing Rilo Kiley in their own images. (BB)\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nThe Audiologues (Columbus, Ohio)\n\nAlternative\n\nBritish music is being made right here in the good ol' USA ... and it's just as good, if not better. These collegiate musicians took everything they learned and meshed it into a sound that's truly Indie Rock, but their classical training is also evident. Cartel, their new EP, is due soon and was recorded with Nic Hard (The Bravery, The Church and Aberdeen City).\n\nDig It: Keane, Aqualung, Coldplay. (Daniele Pfarr)\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nJiva (Detroit)\n\nAlternative/Hard Rock\n\nWith Zep-worthy riffs and a charismatic frontwoman, Motown's five-year-old foursome Jiva has pile-driven its way to the forefront of the Detroit Rock scene, drawing large crowds to their frequent headlining shows. But the word has spread beyond their hometown's city limits. In 2002 the band was featured on Mitch Albom's nationally-broadcast radio show, and they've done several high-profile gigs in Southern California. The band is currently hitting the road to support its most recent CD, Masquerade.\n\nDig It: Soundgarden, Lacuna Coil, Aerosmith. (MB)\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nViva la Venus (Raleigh, N.C.)\n\nAlternative/Hard Rock\n\nWith sexy, impassioned vocals and a chugging Rock & Roll grind, this North Carolina-foursome has released two albums, including last year's acclaimed Forget the Fairy Tale, and toured extensively. Viva la Venus' music has been featured on TV shows, including The Tonight Show and two episodes of the Lifetime series, Strong Medicine.\n\nDig It: The thought of a young Madonna starting a (mostly) all-girl Rock band. (MB)\n\nJEKYLL & HYDE'S 3RD FLOOR\n\n9 p.m.\n\nMadras Lounge (Cincinnati)\n\nRock\n\nStill a very young band here in Cincy, Madras Lounge is working their arses off to get their first album out and to the masses. They describe their sound as Led Zeppelin, Mars Volta, Incubus and Smashing Pumpkins, all peppered with Latin beats. With all of those influences, how can they go wrong?\n\nDig It: The Mars Volta, Incubus (DP)\n\n10 p.m.\n\nThe Flouride Program (Detroit)\n\nIndie Pop\n\nThe Flouride Program has only been in circulation for a little over a year, and the Detroit quartet has already released a pair of acclaimed CDs (their debut EP, Bastion, and their latest full-length, Roadside Flowers) and generated a ton of positive press. Combining pure Pop/Rock with more experimental sonic textures and atmospheres, they've already built an impressive and dedicated following at home.\n\nDig It: Hook-laden Pop summit between Matthew Sweet, Sloan and Velvet Crush, with Wilco and Television piped into the conference room. (BB)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nJosh Aran (Minneapolis)\n\nAlternative Rock\n\nMinneapolis native Josh Aran has degrees in English and Art History but prefers to Rock the Midwest, fronting his own band or as a solo act. Aran has released three albums in the past six years; 2000's Sun Up, 2003's Between Us There Arose Happiness and his latest work, Water to Wash Away Water. Aran is a favorite around Minneapolis's cool venues for his expansive and sincere presentation.\n\nDig It: Jeff Tweedy dreaming of Led Zeppelin and waking up next to Radiohead. (BB)\n\n12 a.m.\n\nKohai (Cincinnati)\n\nAlternative Rock\n\nThere aren't many Hard Rock bands that understand the benefits of balancing their volume and energy with the subtleties of ambient atmospherics and melodic delicacy, but Kohai doesn't mind being in the minority. Originally begun as an acoustic duo, Kohai soon acquired the members needed to produce their eclectic and powerful debut album, What We Are Waiting For.\n\nDig It: A high tea with Smashing Pumpkins and Portishead. (BB)\n\nKALDI'S\n\n9 p.m.\n\nLori O'Connor (Lexington, Ky.)\n\nAcoustic/Singer/Songwriter\n\nMixing Folk, Pop, Rock and Country influences (along with inspiration from Emmylou Harris, Fleetwood Mac, Kate Bush and Lucinda Williams), Maysville, Ky. native O'Connor took her lifelong love of poetry and songwriting to the next level in high school, when she picked up guitar and started writing songs of her own. In college, she hit various coffeehouses, open mics and restaurants around Kentucky, and in 2004 she released her first CD, for which she received a grant from the Kentucky Foundation For Women to record.\n\nDig It: Nanci Griffith, Emmylou Harris and smart, introspective lyricists. (MB)\n\n9:40 p.m.\n\nAbby Lappen (Hudson Valley, N.Y.)\n\nAcoustic/Folk/Jazz\n\nLappen is a dynamic performer, mixing jazzy vocal phrasings into the Folk and Blues idiom for an engaging, soulful and fluidly organic end result. Her background in dance explains the interesting rhythmic nuances in her sound, which add an element of intrigue to the sometimes-staid singer/songwriter model. Lappen's lyrics are also above par; her song \"Beef Queen\" humorously recounts life as a vegetarian in a meat-crazy world.\n\nDig It: Veggie Big Macs, a less snoozy Norah Jones with a Folk/Americana bent and acoustic guitar. (MB)\n\n10:20 p.m.\n\nBob Cushing (Cincinnati)\n\nAcoustic/Rock\n\nLocals remember Cushing as that cool old guy from the small room at the Blue Note who would happily pick his guitar and accept kamikaze shots from the kids taking a break from Denial on the big stage. Apparently those nights kept him young, because Bob's still at it, penning jangly Honky Tonk gems that address everything from President Bush to nagging women to midday boozing.\n\nDig It: Brooks & Dunn, Goshorn Brothers, Bob & Tom Show musical guests. (HR)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nStephen Moore (Cincinnati)\n\nSinger/Songwriter\n\nMoore is a Connecticut native who moved to Cincinnati and has been playing the local music scene ever since. Last year he released his first CD, a three-song EP featuring his jangly, emotive acoustic-based Pop songs.\n\nDig It: Catchy, uncomplicated Pop with an acoustic grounding. (MB)\n\n11:40 p.m.\n\nJenny Madison (Nashville)\n\nPop/Rock\n\nMadison dove into music as a small child growing up in Louisville. Lured by a writing deal with Acuff-Rose, Madison is now in the songwriter capitol of America, but she quickly realized she wanted to make her own music instead of writing solely for others. Last year, she issued her self-released debut, Conversations With Myself, which shows her to be a versatile, multidimensional performer who can deliver soft, intimate ballads and rhythmically-charged rockers with equal aplomb, made cohesive by her gorgeous, stirring vocal prowess.\n\nDig It: KT Tunstall, Sheryl Crow, Shawn Colvin. (MB)\n\n12:20 a.m.\n\nRoger Yeardley (Cincinnati)\n\nAmericana\n\nYeardley is a Cincy scene vet whose music is playful and versatile, incorporating elements of Jazz, Blues, Rockabilly, Country and other Americana forms. His strength as an adaptable writer was made evident on his first CD, Sheepless in Cincinnati, which featured luminaries from the local Blues and Rock scene performing his songs. Yeardley has played bass with numerous local bands and regularly performs in the clubs as a solo performer, with a duo partner or with his band, Roger Y & the Quick Replies. His music has also found its way onto movie soundtracks ‚Äî next month, his track \"Rise & Fall of the Blues\" is featured in NewLine Cinema's Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning.\n\nDig It: Lyle Lovett, timeless Roots music in general. (MB)\n\nKNOW THEATRE DOWNSTAIRS\n\n9 p.m.\n\nKatie Trotta (Indianapolis)\n\nSinger/Songwriter\n\nTrotta is a classically trained pianist who finished recording her debut album, Release, during her senior year of high school and two months after her 18th birthday. Quite an accomplishment considering most of us were worried about how we were going to finish that last history class with a passing grade. Her recent addition of a backing band has added more soul to her usually solo-charged performances.\n\nDig It: Tori Amos' piano with Joss Stone's bluesy, deep voice. (DP)\n\n10 p.m.\n\nLeerone (Los Angeles)\n\nIndie Pop\n\nImaginative and emotive singer/songwriter Leerone released her debut CD, In This Life, On This Road, in 2003. With swirling, electro-tinged atmospherics, inventive melodies, big beats and remarkable, personal lyrics, the EP drew strong reviews, but the Israeli-born vocalist went in an entirely new direction on her follow-up, Hail to the Queen, stripping away the full-band sound to just her voice and keys. It's to her great credit as a songwriter and performer that the songs are still deep, radiant and captivating, sounding a bit like a gene splice of Tori Amos and PJ Harvey.\n\nDig It: Bj√∂rk, Regina Spektor, a less exuberant-sounding Lily Allen. (MB)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nChris Collier (Cincinnati)\n\nAcoustic/Folk\n\nCollier is a veteran of the local original music scene, with over 20 years of performing experience in the Midwest. Her personal stories are extended through her music, which has garnered her much attention, evidenced by a local Cammy award for Best Folk Vocalist in 2002.\n\nDig It: Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Joan Armatrading. (DP)\n\n12 a.m.\n\nThe Iry (Columbus, Ohio)\n\nAlternative\n\nThis five-piece act rarely ventures out of Ohio, but they should. The music is driven by piano and percussion, which makes it distinct in an field of music that usually arranges its music around vocals and guitars. Earlier this year, the band was selected to appear on a compilation CD put together by Decent Xposure, a music marketing company that has promoted independent and emerging artists such as O.A.R., Citizen Cope and Ari Hest, to name a few.\n\nDig It: Funky Ben Folds with a passion for bongo drums. (DP)\n\nKNOW THEATRE UPSTAIRS\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nWin With Willard (Indianapolis)\n\nRock\n\nWin With Willard doesn't rely on flashy arrangements or fleeting trends to make their musical point. The Indianapolis quartet keeps their presentation fairly traditional with just the right amount of edge to keep things engaging, as shown on their latest album, Remember the Alamo.\n\nDig It: The Rock, the whole Rock and nothing but the Rock, so help you God. (BB)\n\n10:15pm\n\nTBA\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nMarcato (Des Moines, Iowa)\n\nProgressive Metal\n\nBy powerfully connecting the line between melodic Metal and the music's more adventurous practitioners, this Iowan foursome couldn't have picked a better name. (Marcato is a musical term used to describe the technique of \"attacking\" a note). With songs that rage against racism, intolerance and other injustices, their textured music never follows the cookie-cutter \"rules\" of Hard Rock, sounding at times like Deftones or a more masculine, Metal version of Jane's Addiction, where the melodies never get buried in the aggressive songwriting experimentation. Should be a powder-keg live show.\n\nDig It: System of a Down, Nothingface, Deftones. (Mike Breen)\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nKamikaze Saucers (Cincinnati)\n\nAlternative\n\nAs fans of unreleased Atari games (they're named after one) and little plastic aliens that come in those little bubbles out of quarter machines, Kamikaze Saucers have a distinct sound that musters up memories of the '80s when video game characters were large pixel blocks and MTV videos were cool. They've shared a stage with The Ike Reilly Assassination and are currently working on a follow-up to their Floppy EP.\n\nDig It: Talking Heads playing Nintendo's Dragon Warrior. (DP)\n\nMR. PITIFUL'S\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nREDHILL (Detroit)\n\nCountry/Pop\n\nThis six-member band likes to call its music \"Detroit Country\" due to the influence of the music oozing from their hometown, long known more for its Rock and R&B bands than anything close to Country music. But the overriding sound of REDHILL is Country ‚Äî slick, polished and radio-ready but not devoid of some of the traditional soul of the music's forbearers. The group of experienced musicians is having a good year so far. In August, they released their debut LP, You Get What You Get, they scored two Detroit Music Awards nominations, Chuck Eddy of The Village Voice raved about their earlier four-song EP and this fall they'll open for Clint Black and Dwight Yoakam.\n\nDig It: Classic Rock meets Classic Country meets Classic R&B. (MB)\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nMatt Reed (Chicago)\n\nIndie Rock\n\nReed is sort of an \"√ºbermusician,\" playing accordion, harmonica, drums, bass, guitar, clarinet and Farfisa, to name a few of his specialties. Those abilities have earned him gigs backing up Paul K and Chris Mills, as well as Jazz gigs at weddings and parties. Reed, who also writes and performs music for film and theater, took the party money and invested it in the recording of his first solo album, Where the Pale Girls Go, a collection of organic, acoustic-based Pop songs with an energetic Indie slant.\n\nDig It: Wilco, Chris Mills, the guy who can play everything and actually write good songs too. (MB)\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nNorthern Whiskey Syndicate (Detroit)\n\nAmericana\n\nThey named one of their albums after the repeal of the act that ended Prohibition (Volstead '33) and, together with their other album (self-titled), The Northern Whiskey Syndicate strives to tell stories that will have you reminiscing about the bar fights that occurred as weeds tumbled through an old ghost town. Slowly sip your whiskey, sirs and madams.\n\nDig It: Darker Jason and Scorchers telling timeless stories. (DP)\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nWojo (Cincinnati)\n\nRock\n\nWojo had their start when guitarist/vocalist Justin Lynch and bassist Aaron Zlatkin combined forces in the early '90s to form a Folk duo. With the additions of Matt Retherford on drums, Mike Fair on guitar and Luke Alquizola on keyboards, Wojo morphed into a legitimate contender, garnering fans all over the Midwest with their strong songwriting, included on their particularly excellent second album, How to Try Without Succeeding. Their third album is due out next month.\n\nDig It: A dash of Rock in your Folk, a kinder, gentler, less hallucinatory Wilco. (BB)\n\nNEON'S\n\n9 p.m.\n\nSohio (Seven Mile, Ohio)\n\nRock\n\nThe only thing dated about Sohio is the reference to Standard Oil of Ohio in their name. The quintet has a contemporary, vibrant and diverse vibe, as evidenced by the band's much-lauded debut CD, Money and Love. And no less than Dane Cook used a track from the album on his HBO show Tourgasm. How much more cred do you need? (See a full interview with the band on page 47.)\n\nDig It: Wilco reading bedtime stories about The Stones to Robert Pollard before he drifts off and dreams of R.E.M. (BB)\n\n10 p.m.\n\nGhostMonster (Cincinnati)\n\nPop/Rock\n\nThis \"Indie-fused Rock/Pop power trio\" began when Dayton-based producer Rob Fugate caught a solo set by Cincy singer/songwriter Mike Goetz, who'd been playing acoustically all over the area on a consistent basis. After some acoustic sessions, Goetz offered up some shelved full-band tracks he'd abandoned. The sharp, catchy-as-hell Power Pop songs were completed after extensive tweaking and tracking and Goetz released the GhostMonster debut, Hair-Raising Adventure. He sought out a backing band to promote the release with shows, enlisting drummer Rory Sandhage (who had actually played on those initial band tracks but moved to L.A. shortly after) and bassist/longtime friend Jeremy Singer.\n\nDig It: Cheap Trick, Material Issue, classic Power Pop. (MB)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nRick Nease (Toledo, Ohio)\n\nPop/Rock\n\nRick Nease is a Northern Ohio Rock & Roll veteran who's played in the Toledo/Detroit scene for a number of years, most recently with the regionally successful BadMonkey. When they split up, Nease did side work for a while before striking out on his own, releasing his solo debut, Love + Consequence, this year. The EP's six songs display strong, classic Pop songcraft, without any gimmicks or extraneous concessions to current tastes or trends.\n\nDig It: Tom Petty, Neil Young, Richard Thompson. (MB)\n\n12 a.m.\n\nRic Hickey and the Loose Wrecks (Cincinnati)\n\nRock\n\nIt doesn't seem possible that Cincinnatians have been staring slack-jawed at Hickey's magnificent guitar ministrations for two decades now. After wonderously shambling stints with the Speed Hickeys, Sawney Bean and Telegram Sam, Hickey assembled the Loose Wrecks with the influential triumvirate of Frank Zappa, Willie Nelson and The Stones firmly in his consciously diverse frontal lobe (with side glances at Dylan and Cheap Trick). Hickey and the Wrecks are world-class local treasures.\n\nDig It: The humor and finesse of Zappa, the laidback intensity of Willie Nelson, the enormity of Rock history in a single sonic book report. (BB)\n\nNEON'S COURTYARD\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nNo Other Name (Owosso, Mich.)\n\nChristian Rock\n\nNo Other Name has the distinction of being one of the only truly Christian Rock bands playing MidPoint. There's no light-under-a-bushel symbolism with No Other Name, who take their name from Acts 4:12, coincidentally the title of their debut album. The quintet's live shows are calls to worship, and their message is not about spirituality ‚Äî it's about the Spirit.\n\nDig It: Church and Classic Rock, in that order. (BB)\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nVoodoo Loons (Cincinnati)\n\nAlternative\n\nWorking two fronts, one here in the Queen City and the other in Donegal, Ireland, Voodoo Loons have managed to attract a fervent audience on two continents. With an appealing mix of visceral Punk energy and cerebral psychedelia, they find the right balance between frenetic chaos and studied control.\n\nDig It: The Grateful Dead teach the Pogues how to jam, who teach World Party how to drink, who teach The Stones how to relax, and everyone gets their degrees from Professors Zappa, Waits and Dylan. (BB)\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nShaking Tree (Lawrence, Kan.)\n\nRoots/Pop/Rock\n\nThis largely acoustic-based quartet came up in the late '90s and presented itself as an alternative to the mangy post-Grunge hysteria. Initially overlooked by the local press due to their mandolin and violin-laced earthiness, the group took their case straight to the people, distributing hundreds of free CDs, which led to packed shows. Regional tours, solid promotion, a management deal and eventual indie record deal helped them spread the word further and the band began racking up endorsements, TV appearances and a big-time gig at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. The usual sad tale of industry failings pushed the band to go back to being totally DIY, but their experiences have made them more than capable of handling their business on their own.\n\nDig It: Acoustic R.E.M., Ryan Adams, Guster. (MB)\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nKatie Reider (Columbus, Ohio)\n\nAdult Contemporary/Pop\n\nReider is a Cincinnati native who now calls Columbus home. Her charismatic live presence and hooky, folksy Pop/Rock songs have helped her build a legion of dedicated fans, who have snatched up over 10,000 copies of her various independently released albums. Reider has landed some songs on TV spots on ABC and has performed with like-minded acts like Antigone Rising, Michelle Malone, Shawn Mullins and Catie Curtis. When you see Katie and her band live ‚Äî to paraphrase her bio ‚Äî you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss 10 bucks goodbye (when you just have to buy one of her CDs).\n\nDig It: Shawn Colvin, Melissa Ferrick, charming and hilarious between-song banter in concert. (MB)\n\nNEON'S UPSTAIRS\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nChris Bryan (Chicago)\n\nSinger/Songwriter\n\nWith jazzy chords and gentle but memorable Pop hooks delivered with a groovy, rhythmic phrasing, Bryan constructed his second album, The Sum of My Habits, while going to school and being a student teacher, fitting in songwriting and recording sessions between bouts of grading papers and studying. With an easy-breeze glide, Bryan's songs have entranced audiences and critics; one writer in the UK even said Sum has the potential to be one of the best-selling albums of the year. That'll, of course, depend on a bigger record deal, but his songs are perfectly in line with the current Pop singer/songwriter craze, so don't be surprised to see him land one soon.\n\nDig It: John Mayer, Martin Sexton, Jason Mraz. (MB)\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nellen cherry (Baltimore)\n\nSinger/Songwriter\n\nellen cherry is sort of a band and sort of a woman. When Kristin Putchinski was in college pursuing a BA in military history (a what?), she stumbled across a guitar and never looked back. Nearly a decade ago, she began performing as ellen cherry, which is sometimes her band but sometimes just her. Kristin/ellen has produced all her own recordings and scored indie films, and her side projects include a Simon and Garfunkel tribute, an alternative Celtic cover band and a Roots Rock outfit.\n\nDig It: Suzanne Vega, Aimee Mann and Liz Phair telling fairy tales to Bj√∂rk's swan dress. (BB)\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nHailey Wojcik (Kalamazoo, Mich.)\n\nSinger/Songwriter\n\nWojcik has released four CDs in the past six years, the latest being the acclaimed Jealous Sees, an album that made Performing Songwriter magazine's January/February 2006 \"Top 12 DIY\" list, where she was lauded as being \"somewhere between Liz Phair and Nick Drake.\" This is all the more impressive considering Wojcik's first album, 2000's Hairy Woodchuck, came when she was just 14 years old.\n\nDig It: The gravity of Liz Phair, the comedy of Todd Snider, the multi-instrumental expertise of Jackson Browne. (BB)\n\n12:15 a.m.\n\nJeff Rolka (Alameda, Calif.)\n\nIndie Acoustic Rock\n\nDetroit native/Cali resident Jeff Rolka has grown immeasurably between the release of his two albums, 2004's Dandelion and last year's Somewhere in the Fade. Employing a sound he calls \"English Rock made in America,\" Rolka makes his point acoustically and electrically with equal aplomb and passion.\n\nDig It: Neil Young and Sting having a drink at a Beatles tribute listening party. (BB)\n\nRED CHEETAH COURTYARD\n\n9 p.m.\n\n8KOunt (Dayton, Ohio)\n\nHard Rock\n\nWith professional, well-put-together Rock highlighted by the kind of melodies that beg for commercial radio airplay, this highly-charged quartet recorded its recently-released debut full-length, Cornered, with Russ-T Cobb, who has worked with artists like Sevendust and Avril Lavigne. 8KOunt songs like \"Insanity Defense\" have some of the strut and wallop of old Cr√ºe or GNR, but its filtered through a contemporary Rock sensibility, cutting through the highly slick production with a passionate, edgy powerfulness. Those who have seen them say 8KOunt's live show is not to be missed.\n\nDig It: Hinder, Shinedown, \"New Rock\" radio playlists. (MB)\n\n10 p.m.\n\nKrescent 4 (Ann Arbor, Mich.)\n\nAlternative/Hard Rock\n\nFerociously rhythmic and exploding with brash, muscular riffs, this quartet has released several CDs since 2001 and toured everywhere between New York to Hollywood. The band's music has been heard on Spike TV and Sirius Radio and they've also charted on CMJ. Besides their knack for melody, the band's greatest asset is that they seem to understand the power of the groove, as their songs are all pushed along by big beats. Zep would be proud.\n\nDig It: Audioslave, Nickelback with a groove, The Killers minus New Wave, plus Metal. (MB)\n\n11 p.m.\n\nSubvinyl (Cincinnati)\n\nAlternative Rock\n\nSubvinyl was assembled in 1998 as a Funk/Groove side project for guitarist Tony Gentry but wound up front and center when Bootsy Collins dug what Gentry was doing. The band ultimately broke up, then was revived with new members and a new Modern Rock direction. With Gentry and Robyn Bromwell on male/female lead vocals and a solid band around them, Subvinyl has been reinvented as a unique AltRock outfit.\n\nDig It: Darkness on the edge of Sheryl Crow, Jewel and X. (BB)\n\n12 a.m.\n\nBASTION (Cincinnati)\n\nRock\n\nBastion has been around the scene since 2001, and their debut album, The Honey Sacrifice, earned them two Cincinnati Entertainment Award nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rock Band of the Year in 2005. Their live performances are highly energized, and they're earning fans across the nation. An upcoming tour is slated for early 2007."
