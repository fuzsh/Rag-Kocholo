        "text": "If you've ever wanted to see a late-night talk show in person but didn't want to travel to New York City or Hollywood, here's your chance. The Nite Show with Danny Cashman is returning to the Westbrook Performing Arts Center on March 29.\n\nThe Nite Show first went on the air in Bangor in 1997 on a small WB affiliate. While the show went off the air for several years before returning to TV on CBS, FOX, and NBC affiliates statewide, it has now been in existence for 27 years.\n\nDan is planning to tape two big shows, as he returns one last time to the Westbrook Performing Arts Center. Dan has announced that there would be only one more season of The Nite Show, and this would be the final time it is taken on the road to Southern Maine.\n\nHe wrote this on the Nite Show Facebook page:\n\nTo my Southern Maine friends - we are bringing The Nite Show down to Westbrook just one more time. That means this will be your final chance to see the show live and in person before we wrap it up unless you travel to Bangor. It's at 6 p.m. THIS Friday at the beautiful Westbrook Performing Arts Center. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that I'd be hosting a show that is welcoming one of my favorite singers of all time in Paula Cole, and a guy who has been so instrumental (in every sense of the word) with some of my favorite showbiz bands like The Blues Brothers, The CBS Orchestra, and the SNL Band: Tom \"Bones\" Malone. I certainly never imagined they'd be on the show the same night, and they're both making a return visit to our show. It's going to be a special night. Brian Nadeau & The Nite Show Band will be there, my friend Jeff Parsons from 94.9 WHOM will be filling in for Christie, and we've got some fun surprises in store for our very last on the road taping.\n\nI have to say that I'm super excited to be guest hosting with Dan. We've already put some fun stuff together for this show, and having Paula Cole there to perform is the icing on the Nite Show cake.\n\nTickets are free, but you need to get yours online by clicking here.
