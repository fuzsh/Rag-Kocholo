        "text": "For extra spice, sing the title to the tune of “Where Have All The Cowboys Gone?” by Paula Cole.\n\nFor a time in college, I was on a mission to find out which fast food restaurant sold the best chicken sandwich. I could have googled it and let it go, but that was way too easy. I had to try them all.\n\nMy hometown, Grand Junction, Colorado, was filled to the brim with chain restaurants, so it wasn’t like I didn’t have a good sampling of sandwiches. So, about once a week, normally Thursday for some reason, I would buy a different one. After trying a bunch of spots, I found that Popeyes was the best. (Sorry, Chick-fil-a.)\n\nSince then, I’ll admit I’m not a fan of fast food. Sure, it’s quick and what I order is cheap, but I feel sluggish and kind of sick after eating it.\n\nWhen the craving does hit, I’ll either hit up Cook Out or Taco Bell. But one day, I was really craving chicken. Since there’s a Popeyes in Perry, I made my way down Sam Nunn, ready to reunite with my long lost college love.\n\nImagine my surprise when I found nobody at the store. Curious, I searched up Popeyes and found all locations in middle Georgia were closed! Apparently, the only one that’s open is on Robins Air Force Base.\n\nImagine that interaction with security:\n\n“ID?”\n\n“Hi, yes, I’d like one admission into Robins Air Force Base, please. I don’t work here, but I have a good reason, promise.”\n\n“And what would that be, ma’am?”\n\n“All the Popeyes are closed, and I’m really craving a chicken sandwich.”\n\n“Go home, ma’am.”\n\n“Okay…”\n\nYou know how you don’t miss things until they’re gone? Now I have found myself in that predicament. I can’t stop thinking about the goodness that is Popeyes chicken sandwiches. I’m entering a poultry psychosis. A chicken-induced coma. I quit smoking, and those cravings were easier to deal with than this.\n\nSo, what’s a hungry journalist to do? I’m going to do what I do best — write. In this case, a strongly worded letter to corporate:"
