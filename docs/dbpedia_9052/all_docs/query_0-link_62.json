        "text": "Dean O’Leary was born in Sydney, Australia and moved to Los Angeles to be part of a lifelong musical dream.\n\nComing from an entertainment family, it was hard not to pick up a musical instrument and ‘jam’ for family and friends. So, by 15 years old, he had his first paying gig on the big stage playing guitar all over Australia for his father, Jack O’Leary.\n\nWinning the Australian Club Entertainment Awards (ACE Awards) in 2007, 2008 and 2009, was a big highlight in his career -- a prestigious award that recognizes Australian talent; the winner is carefully selected and nominated by elite industry agents, fellow talents, the public and venues annually. Dean took home several awards from there: Best Solo Guitarist & Vocalist of the Year (2007, 2009) and Best Duo & Trio Covers Band of the Year (2008, 2009).\n\nFollowing the success of his work around Australia and Internationally for major artistes, Dean finally had a break in his schedule and re-released his single, ‘Time For Changing’ from his self-titled debut album,‘Dean O’Leary’ in August 2009. He continued to showcase his music at festivals and perform with numerous Australian and International music icons.\n\nNow living in Los Angeles, he continues to be a sought after guitarist and vocalist, working with such noteworthy solo artists as Connie Stevens, Maxine Nightingale, Eartha, Kim O'Leary, Pops Fernandez, Kai Brown and Hudson Thames."
