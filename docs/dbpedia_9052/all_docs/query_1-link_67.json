For the entirely self-produced album, This Fire, she was the first woman in history to be solely nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Producer. Released in 1996, This Fire presents a deep dive into the multi-faceted, confessional songwriting style that Cole is revered for. Paula Cole opened cultural confines and broke glass ceilings, demonstrating an unparalleled talent for blending elements of pop, rock, folk, and jazz to create her intricate sound. This Vinyl reissue captures that dynamic sound incredibly - although the original recording is digital - this pressing allows for that warm, analog sound! With hit singles like 'Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?' and 'I Don't Want to Wait,' This Fire resonates with the same authenticity, rawness, and energy that it did upon it's original release, and is more relevant today than ever.\n\nReleased on vinyl for the first time ever\n\nCelebrating the 25th Anniversary of this 90's groundbreaking masterpiece\n\nNominated for 7 Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Album in 1998 - Grammy Winner 1998 - Best New Artist\n\nOriginally Mastered by: Bob Ludwig\n\nVinyl Mastering by: Kevin Gray Vinyl Pressing by: R.T.I."
