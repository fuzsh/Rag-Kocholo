        "text": "It would be easy to describe Paula Cole as ‘just another 90s singer-songwriter’. Every biography mentions her association with the Lilith Fair festivals, that zeitgeist of 90s new wave feminism that faded as quickly as it came (attempts to re-create the Lilith Fair hype only a few years ago fell embarrassingly limp). And of course, we can’t forget that this is the woman whose voice opened up every episode of the 90s cultural phenomenon (might be a bit strong a word, but it was certainly popular) that was Dawson’s Creek. While her ambitious creativity was rarely met with commercial success (Where Have All the Cowboys Gone and I Don’t Want to Wait remain her sole Top 10 singles in the States), Cole is an artist in the truest sense. Over the course of her 20 years in the music industry Cole has followed her muse before all else. Where her contemporaries have often chosen to play it safe (Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow) rather than tip the applecart, Cole has proven herself a true successor to the likes of Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon, and Kate Bush in her willingness to eschew convention for creative growth. 2014 marks the 20 year anniversary of Cole’s debut album ‘Harbinger’, and with this milestone comes a much deserved look at the body of work that Cole has crafted.\n\nBethlehem\n\nGrowing up in the small town of Rockport, Massachusetts, Paula Cole was the youngest daughter of a elementary school teacher and a scientist. Cole’s family were musical, her father playing in a polka band and family sing alongs encouraged. After surviving the angst of adolescence and high school, Cole followed her musical dreams to the Berklee College of Music studying jazz singing and improvisation. However, studying the works of great composers like Gershwin was paralleled by Cole’s own burgeoning songwriting. Cole found herself at a crossroads: a record contract with a jazz label or pursue her own craft and musical vision. Cole took the plunge, and in 1993 signed with Imago records to begin recording her debut album. While Cole wanted to produce her own album from the get-go, the record label felt it better for her to work alongside someone more ‘experienced’ and the reigns were handed to Kevin Killen. Killen had had a hand in many a great record (and continues to), and was a good fit for the restless and introspective Cole. ‘Harbinger’ was truly a departure from Cole’s jazz studies although remnants of her training would emerge briefly in song structures. Like it’s stark album cover depicting a huddled Cole in a too-big trench coat (this is the better known cover anyway – there were two), ‘Harbinger’ is an album of shadow, introspection, and emotional catharsis. Often touching on her small-town experiences growing up, Cole’s lyrics are a poignant reflection of interpersonal dynamics (Bethlehem, Happy Home) and the darker sides of humanity (Hitler’s Brothers).\n\nAlready, Cole was demonstrating her fearlessness in telling things as they were and foreshadowed her plunge into themes of social justice and inequality on her later records. That said, Cole is at times naïve in her assessments of human kind, and a song like Black Boots, while obviously meaningful to the Cole of that time, does come off as rather self-indulgent. The album itself is a lush and nuanced work and Killen’s production is dynamic throughout. Dreamy synths are backed by a rock band on the single-worthy Saturn Girl, which demonstrated Cole’s capacity for accessible material, while strings are employed to dramatic effect on the likes of Chiaroscuro and Our Revenge. Cole’s vocals are the real showstopper though and transcend anything she sings to new heights. On ‘Harbinger’, Cole is vocally restrained compared to later projects, but this is understandable for a new artist probably feeling some pressure to remain accessible and finding her legs. Yet this does not mar the sheer beauty of her voice, which is at once delicate and dizzying (She Can’t Feel Anything Anymore) and ominous (Our Revenge). While the album had all the makings of being an alternative radio hit, it’s lead single I Am So Ordinary, a heartbreaking paean to being the other woman, failed to spark interest and soon after the album’s release Imago records collapsed and its artists were picked up by Warner Brothers. ‘Harbinger’ was re-released in 1995 to coincide with this move, however promotion was limited and the album ultimately fell through the cracks. Cole, however, was beginning to be recognised as a burgeoning young singer-songwriter and appearances with the likes of Melissa Etheridge on VH1 did help to boost her profile. The best was yet to come though.\n\nWhere do I put this fire…\n\nFollowing the demise of Imago records and her move to Warner Brothers, Cole was commissioned to make another album. This time though, Cole was given free reign and a minimal budget – it seemed Warner Brothers were simply going through the motions and did not expect Cole to justify her place on their roster. Cole took the opportunity gladly and after the catharsis that ‘Harbinger’ represented, found herself carrying a new energy. She poured this newfound confidence into making her second album, ‘This Fire’ and the record signified a shift away from the Kate Bush-lite tones of ‘Harbinger’ and into a new, exciting, and wholly individual musical vision. Cole not only helmed production, vocal, and songwriting duties but was also responsible for most of the album’s instrumentation, playing everything from piano to didjeridu! Listening to the album, it is clear how much Cole revelled in having complete creative control. After all, the precocious young artist had wanted full control over her product even as a novice. Also apparent is Cole’s preference for a starker approach compared to the slightly heavy-handed production on ‘Harbinger’. Where ‘Harbinger’ was painted in dark shadows and blinding light with little middle ground, ‘This Fire’ brought colour to Cole’s musical vocabulary and expanded on her vision while also paying tribute to her past.\n\nFrom the opening seconds of Tiger, Cole’s voice conveys a ferocity and passion otherwise subdued in the introspection of ‘Harbinger’. Fittingly though, this opening track references Cole’s newfound freedom (I’ve left Bethlehem / and I feel free / I’ve left the girl I was supposed to be) and sets her on the road to living in the moment. ‘This Fire’ is a rollercoaster of a record and a snapshot of a woman finding her identity. Where ‘Harbinger’ was keen-eyed in its judgment on others, this emancipated Cole is fierce and rips her opponents\n\nto shreds (Throwing Stones, Road to Dead). There are still accessible moments here, such as the hit single Where Have All the Cowboys Gone, all country twang and jaded nostalgia. Or there’s Me, the album’s third single and most overtly introspective moment, unfortunately not having the same success as its predecessors yet containing Cole’s most blatant hooks and melodies. The darker moments are where the album truly shines though, and Cole’s stark storytelling comes into its own when backed by fittingly stripped-back instrumentation. The intensity of Nietzsche’s Eyes – dealing with the realisation of an admired figure’s true colours – is almost unsettling, as Cole unravels into a throat-shredding vocal outro. Similarly, the eerie and foreboding Mississippi is a fitting tribute to the river, and Cole crafts a dark fairytale around its banks. Juxtaposing these darker moments though are the album’s more sentimental, such as the heart-wrenching tale of a man dying from AIDS in Hush, Hush, Hush (featuring an appearance by the inimitable Peter Gabriel) or the tale of love through the ages in I Don’t Want to Wait. While the album is certainly a mixed bag of styles and tones, it is Cole’s most accomplished release to date and even today is a thrilling, invigorating and touching listen – a seminal album of the 90s even if it’s not recognised as such by a wider audience.\n\nThe album remains Cole’s most commercially successful – despite stalling at #20 on the Billboard Charts, it was a steady seller and eventually certified 2x Platinum. The album and Cole were also nominated for seven Grammy Awards, with Cole winning for ‘Best New Artist’ (ironic, since this was her second album). As a female producer though, the honour lay in being nominated for ‘Best Producer’, the first solo female producer to be so at that point. Not having grown up in the United States, and with their being only minimal video archiving of Cole’s career, it’s hard for me to establish exactly how successful she was at this point. Nevertheless, it is obvious that Cole became synonymous with the wave of female singer-songwriters that emerged in the 90s and became a figurehead due to her involvement with the Lilith Fair festival. Cole experienced a wave of success, yet it suddenly vanished with her next project.\n\nStanding at the edge of the precipice\n\nComing off the success of ‘This Fire’, Cole was once again given free reign to create her next record – this time however, Warner Brothers were much more invested in the project being a commercial success. Cole had different plans though. Ever the restless artist, Cole was not content to traipse out another ‘This Fire’, and given that album’s lightning-in-a-bottle magic, it was unlikely that Cole would be able to (or want to, for that matter) tap into that same reservoir. Not succumbing to pressure, Cole began work on her most ambitious and misunderstood record that would eventually become known as ‘Amen’. Cole’s inherent restlessness and insecurity is all over the project – from redundant name changes (to the Paula Cole Band), to longer song times – yet do not ultimately compromise the album’s quality. A concept record of sorts, the album is Cole at her most socially aware and contains many a commentary of the oppression of women, the social inequalities of racial minorities, the use of religion as an subjugating force, and the quest for spirituality. While Cole had previously nodded towards such themes on her previous records, ‘Amen’ was much more overt in its messages and wore its heart on its sleeve, so to speak. To the casual observer, Cole’s albums seemed to be getting shorter, with each having successively fewer tracks, however ‘Amen’ was an album of longer tracks which allowed Cole the flexibility to experiment and craft more complex sonic stories.\n\nIn contrast to the piano- and acoustic guitar-based alternative rock of ‘This Fire’, the new album showcased Cole’s love of urban sounds, incorporating R&B and Hip Hop elements into its soundscapes. On Rhythm of Life, Cole even raps the verses, a brave move but one that showed her commitment to spreading her creative wings. The album’s opener, I Believe In Love, is a lush R&B-meets-disco stomper showcasing Cole’s nimble vocals and aptitude for narrative lyrics. The song screams ‘hit single’, but unfortunately suffered from a lack of promotion. I Believe In Love is one of the album’s few uptempo moments, with many midtempos and ballads creating a more subdued\n\ntone. Where ‘This Fire’ was, well, fiery ‘Amen’ was Cole channeling Mother Earth in the album’s quietly demanding moments. Pearl and La Tonya (the former a reflection on commitment in relationships and the latter an account of a Latina girl experiencing prostitution and drug abuse) are slow in their buildup, but are testament to Cole’s ability to create epic and nuanced songs with a distinct message. Anyone who felt Cole had lost her ‘edge’ though need only listen to Suwannee Jo, a track composed in the ‘Harbinger’ days, but given a dark, rumbling energy complete with vocal callisthenics to amaze even the diehard fan. Cole may have been embodying the Gaia image, but she could be as biting in her commentary as she had been in emasculating men on ‘This Fire’. The album’s title track, earmarked to be a single but eventually cancelled, is a sarcastic yet searching view of religion and faith, and has Paula praising everyone from Kavorkian to Gandhi to ‘the drivers in their garbage trucks’.\n\nPaula had let her ambitions run wild with ‘Amen’ and crafted a deliciously warm, yet thought provoking album. Of course by 1999, the music industry had again shifted and female singer-songwriters with something to say were again passé. Cole’s record company, wanting a hit single, found nothing to their liking and refused to promote the album. Critics seized on what they saw as naïve social commentary and lambasted Cole for her attempt to sing about experiences she had never had. So much for storytelling in song. If Dylan had released this album it would have been critically acclaimed. Alas, this was not the case for Cole and the album sold poorly.\n\nFinding courage\n\nWarner Brothers refused to promote ‘Amen’, and the album soon vanished from the lower ends of the charts. Cole went on to record a fourth album collaborating with producer Hugh Padgham, but the record label refused to release it and the album was never released (many a Paula Cole fan would kill to hear it. The only track to have leaked is Singing Out My Life). In 2003, Cole and Warner Brothers went their separate ways, and three years later a ‘greatest hits’ (in inverted commas since Cole only had two hits) was released, containing tracks from her first three albums, the jazzy soundtrack contribution Autumn Leaves, and two divine ‘Amen’ outtakes, Postcards From East Oceanside and Tomorrow I Will Be Yours. In her personal life, Cole got married and had a child, but this too soon turned sour and the combination of having to care for a sick child and a long, messy divorce from a controlling ex-husband broke Cole and stripped her of the will to commit to music. It wasn’t until 2007 when Cole, approached by Bobby Columby of Decca records, ventured back into the studio with the goal of making a new album. For the first time in 12 years, Cole did not produce her own album and left the majority of the instrumentation to session musicians. Even the songwriting was a shared process this time around. In talking about the album, Cole described the need to ease herself back into the process and the insecurity she faced after having been through so much in her own life. The word she would keep coming back to was ‘Courage’ – nearly every song on the album has the word ‘Courage’ in its lyrics, and it acts a mantra to tie the album together.\n\n‘Courage’ is somewhat of an anomaly in Cole’s catalogue. After the ferocity of ‘This Fire’ and the experimental ‘Amen’, you can feel Cole’s reticence in the makeup of ‘Courage’. Cole’s jazz roots finally come to the fore (Lovelight, Lonely Town, Hard to be Soft) and make for much lighter and romantic fare than Cole was known for at this point. There are some tracks that feel more familiar, such as 14 with its tense build-up and crescendoing vocals; or the chilled, downtempo groove of It’s My Life which wouldn’t feel out of place on ‘Amen’. Yet overall, this record serves purely to make Cole comfortable as a recording artist again. Cole sounds largely defeated and resigned on much of the record, which does add a certain charm and intrigue, but ultimately waters down the material and makes the album her least memorable. The return of Paula Cole was however met with good favour (even if the sales were still poor) and there was some appreciation shown for her 90s work. ‘Courage’ brought Paula Cole back to life, and her next release would see her re-discover her fire.\n\nIthaca\n\nStill signed to Decca records and feeling more confident in her ability after ‘Courage’ was well received by fans and critics alike, Cole went on to work on her fifth studio album. Coming to terms with her past and making peace with the many parts of her life she had fought against in the past, Cole named the album ‘Ithaca’ after the Greek myth of Odysseus. Returning to her hometown of Rockport, Massachusetts Cole likened her life’s journey to that of Odysseus finally returning to his home of Ithaca. Cole had this to say about the album:\n\nI … got really beat up in the world. So I’ve come to a quiet place of acceptance in my family and my hometown. That’s why I called the album ‘Ithaca’ … That’s the tone of the album, that there is both darkness and light to this story. My journey has healed me, and in that healing process I’ve been able to work again.\n\nThe album was a return in more ways than one and while Paula continued to collaborate (even bringing back Kevin Killen to co-produce) it felt a more organic progression from ‘Amen’ than the jazzy ‘Courage’ had been. It seemed that Cole had rediscovered her fire and her newfound ferocity was on show, seemingly channelled towards her ex (The Hard Way, Music In Me). While less experimental than ‘Amen’ or ‘This Fire’ had been, Cole still slipped into a style that was undoubtedly her own by now, and was more angsty and edgy than the softer curves of ‘Courage’. ‘Ithaca’ showcased a more subtle approach to her typically insightful and acerbic lyrics – Waiting on a Miracle, throws barbs at her ex but also has a hopeful message. The funky P.R.E.N.U.P. is a sassy kiss off as well as a warning to avoid to other newlyweds. That said, the album is not all bitterness – true to its theme, Paula had moved on and this is evident in the sexy slowjam aptly named Sex, the romantic 2 Lifetimes, and the cathartic Elegy. Embarking on her first tour in 15 years, Cole was well and truly back and enjoying her craft again. ‘Ithaca’ was well received by critics, who harked it as her return to form, and they were right to say so.\n\nFlying like a raven\n\nAfter nearly 20 years of jumping through the hoops of various record labels and seeing diminishing returns, Cole decided to strike out on her own. After the critical success of ‘Ithaca’, Cole parted ways with Decca and recorded her next album without the budget or expectations of a major label. Turning to her fans to finance the mixing, mastering, and manufacturing of the album, Cole created a successful Kickstarter campaign to create her sixth album, ‘Raven’. The Kickstarter campaign proved that Cole’s fans were still with her and willing to support her through any shift in direction and format of release. Luckily, the fans didn’t have anything to worry about when it came to the quality of the music on offer. ‘Raven’ is a natural culmination of Cole’s influences while also stretching into new musical territory. Sparser and more intimate than any previous album, ‘Raven’ moves the focus to Cole’s lyrical and compositional skills and is her first sole production effort since ‘Amen’.\n\nCole dabbles in country and folk to a greater extent and the sound on the whole is much rootsier than any of her previous efforts. Yet the stylistic shift once again fits her voice like a glove, and tales of love and loss like Eloise are given a pathos and subtlety other artists might not achieve. The album has an unnerving quietness about it. There are no tracks as bombastic as Throwing Stones, as dramatic as Our Revenge, or as overtly smutty as Feelin’ Love. It is this quietude that a mature Cole brings to her music, and while there are certainly moments of release (the soaring chorus of Imaginary Man; the transcendent crescendo of Manitoba; the climactic exhalation in Secretary) the record as a whole feels a more peaceful reflection on life, love, and self-belief. Strong Beautiful Woman feels like Cole’s manifesto to her younger self – its certainly a message the Cole of ‘Harbinger’ seemed to be searching for in all of her angst and frustration. On ‘Raven’, Cole has well and truly found inner peace and as such her music has also found an inner calm that only serves to refine it. The tag of ‘adult contemporary’ is often thrown at female singer-songwriters over 35, yet boxing ‘Raven’ into the genre would be a disservice to the pure, unadulterated creativity on show here. Cole may not be warring with herself or the world as much, yet her lyrics remain as insightful as ever and her voice still commands the attention it did 20 years ago.\n\n‘Raven’ was critically acclaimed and well received by fans. Cole seems to be relishing the freedom of being an independent recording artist and has already made moves to record her next album. Record company or not though, Cole has always proven herself an independent spirit and unwilling to compromise her vision no matter how misunderstood or underappreciated. Here’s hoping the next 20 years are as fruitful and dynamic."
