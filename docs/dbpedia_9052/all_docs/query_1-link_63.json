        "text": "Released on Vinyl for the First Time Ever\n\nRelease date September 22, 2023\n\nReissue Supervision: Grover for Slow Down Sounds\n\nLP Mastering: Kevin Gray at Cohearent Audio\n\nPlating: Dorin Sauerbier (R.T.I.)\n\nPressing: Record Technology Inc. (R.T.I.)\n\nAudio Source: 1630 Original Master\n\nPrint & Paper: Dorado Music Packaging\n\nLP Layout: J Bonner\n\nVinyl Compound: Casey Gibson (TPC)\n\nOriginal Master: Bob Ludwig\n\nOriginal Release Date: October 1996\n\n140g Translucent Red Vinyl\n\nCelebrating the 25th Anniversary of this 90's groundbreaking masterpiece\n\nIncludes the theme song for the hit TV series Dawson's Creek, 'I Don't Want to Wait'\n\nNominated for 7 Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Album in 1998\n\nGrammy Winner 1998 - Best New Artist\n\nIncludes hits such as 'Where Have All the Cowboys Gone,' 'I Don't Want to Wait,' 'Me,' and more\n\nAhead of her time, Paula Cole was a boundary-breaker. For the entirely self-produced album, This Fire, she was the first woman in history to be solely nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Producer.\n\nReleased in 1996, This Fire presents a deep dive into the multi-faceted, confessional songwriting style that Cole is revered for. Paula Cole opened cultural confines and broke glass ceilings, demonstrating an unparalleled talent for blending elements of pop, rock, folk, and jazz to create her intricate sound.\n\nThis vinyl reissue captures that dynamic sound incredibly - although the original recording is digital - this pressing allows for that warm analog sound!\n\nWith streaming hits like 'Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?' and 'I Don't Want to Wait,' This Fire resonates with the same authenticity, rawness, and energy that it did upon its original release, and is more relevant today than ever.\n\nTRACK LISTING\n\n1. Tiger\n\n2. Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?\n\n3. Throwing Stones\n\n4. Carmen\n\n5. Mississippi\n\n6. Nietzsche's Eyes\n\n7. Road To Dead\n\n8. Me\n\n9. Feelin' Love\n\n10. Hush, Hush, Hush.\n\n11.
