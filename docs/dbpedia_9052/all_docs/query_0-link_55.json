        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nAs spring comes into bloom, Livermore Valley Arts is set to captivate audiences with an array of scheduled performances at the Bankhead Theater. From country classics to a folk-rock legend to Grammy-recognized artists and a local favorite, the upcoming schedule aims to cater to a wide range of tastes and preferences.\n\nKicking off the series next Wednesday (April 10) is Pam Tillis and her acoustic trio. The daughter of famed country music artist Mel Tillis, she inherited her father’s talent and passion for music. Raised in Nashville, Tillis honed her craft through various avenues, from talent shows to church performances.\n\nShe has written for a number of large names in the music industry, including for Chaka Khan, Gloria Gaynor and Conway Twitty. With three Country Music Awards under her belt, she promises an evening of soul-stirring melodies and heartfelt lyrics.\n\nFollowing closely next Friday (April 12) is “Songs and Stories” with Roger McGuinn, frontman of the legendary band the Byrds.\n\nMcGuinn has been regarded as one of the most influential artists in modern music history, as he pioneered the fusion of rock and folk with the Byrds in the 1960s.\n\n“McGuinn didn’t just make music – he made history. He was on the leading edge, combining the rock beat of the Beatles with the folk sensibilities of Bob Dylan to create the genre known as folk-rock,” LVA officials said. “We are honored to get to present an enduring music legend.”\n\nThen on April 20, “An Evening with Paula Cole” brings a blend of blues, jazz, folk and pop to the Bankhead stage. A Grammy-winning artist, Cole’s music often dives into complex topics of social justice and revolution.\n\nLVA representatives said Cole’s latest album “Lo” is a testament to her talent and unapologetic honesty.\n\nOn May 10, Roy Rogers and The Delta Rhythm Kings take the stage with their blend of blues and rock.\n\nDescribed as smooth yet powerful, Rogers’ mastery of the slide guitar and his band’s performances have earned them eight Grammy nominations. From studio recordings to live shows, Rogers and his band promise an unforgettable experience for fans of blues-infused music.\n\nClosing out the season on May 12 is Livermore’s own Jason Lyle Black with “From Blockbusters to Broadway 100 Hits”.\n\nLVA described him as a hometown hero.\n\n“In his live shows, Black takes audiences on a journey through numerous musical styles, from Broadway classics to iconic movies and classical masterpieces, all interwoven with Black’s comedic stories,” LVA reps said. “Jason Lyle Black is an award-winning piano entertainer whose clever arrangements, fun stories, and onstage charm have won countless fans throughout the world.”\n\nFor tickets and more information about upcoming shows, visit livermorearts.org or call 925-373-6800."
