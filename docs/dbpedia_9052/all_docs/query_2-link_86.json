        "text": "Paula Cole Jones\n\n“We Choose the Future: Beloved Community “\n\nOn Sunday, May 7th, we will commemorate the delivery of a sermon that was a turning point for Unitarians in the United States. The sermon delivered by William Ellery Channing on May 5, 1819 at the ordination of Rev. Jared Sparks, from the pulpit of the First Independent Church (now our First Unitarian Church of Baltimore), helped to define the future of a new Unitarian religion. Today, we are at another historic turning point as we give a new voice to the shared values and covenants that will help to define the future of Unitarian Universalism. How do the words of William Ellery Channing echo from 204 years ago to inspire us today?\n\nOrder of Service\n\nMusic and Service Notes\n\nPaula Cole Jones, a lifelong Unitarian Universalist, innovator of institutional change, and founder of ADORE, A Dialogue on Race & Ethnicity, has been a leader in developing and advancing the 8th Principle and the Community of Communities as practices of the Beloved Community.

Miller (choristersguild.org)\n\nDuke Ellington (1899-1974), a major figure in the history of jazz music, created one of the most distinctive ensemble sounds in Western music. Raised by two talented, musical parents in a middle-class neighborhood of Washington, D.C., he began studying piano at the age of seven, and earned the nickname “Duke” for his gentlemanly ways. Despite being awarded an art scholarship to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, Ellington followed his passion for ragtime and began to play professionally at age 17. In the 1920s, Ellington performed in Broadway nightclubs as a bandleader. He made hundreds of recordings with his bands, appeared in films and on radio, and toured Europe in the 1930s. Ellington’s fame rose to the rafters in the 1940s. His blend of melodies, rhythms and subtle sonic movements gave audiences a new experience—complex yet accessible jazz that made the heart swing. He earned 12 Grammy awards from 1959 to 2000, nine while he was alive. In 1958 he was presented to HM Queen Elizabeth II at a private reception, a meeting of such impact that he promised to compose a suite in her honor. Inspired by the beauty and majesty of nature, The Queen’s Suite remained hidden from the public until after his death when it received its premiere in 1998. (Adapted from: Biography.com\n\nHarry Belafonte (1927-2023) was born to immigrant parents in Harlem, but spent much of his youth in his mother’s home country of Jamaica. After being honorably discharged from the Navy, he went back to New York, where he worked odd jobs until earning his first leading role at the American Negro Theatre. He made his film debut in 1953 and a year later won a Tony. At the same time, Belafonte developed his singing talents, having parlayed a series of nightclub performances into a record contract. His third album, Calypso, topped the charts for thirty-one consecutive weeks and was the first record to sell more than 1 million copies. Belafonte also secured a television outlet with his hour-long special, Tonight with Belafonte, which won him an Emmy. He became the first African American TV producer. Belafonte worked tirelessly to mobilize artists in support of the civil rights movement. In 1985, he again rallied the global artistic community to raise awareness of the famines, wars and droughts plaguing many African nations. USA for Africa raised more than $60 million with “We Are the World” and Hands Across America. He was a longtime anti-apartheid activist and maintained his commitment to service as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.\n\nBrad Montague is a writer and director on a mission to create meaningful things for kids and former kids.
