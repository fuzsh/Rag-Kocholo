        "text": "Week of 03/31/2024\n\nWhere Have All the Cowboys Gone? – Lola Kirke, Kaitlin Butts Written By Brandon Iozzo\n\nCovering Paula Cole’s 1997 hit, Lola Kirke and Kaitlin Butts put a fresh, Texas country spin on this forgotten gem. Originally written and recorded by Cole, the track was initially intended as a pop record, though it had a folk and Americana-like production. Together, Kirke and Butts create a haunting folk and twang sound with stripped-down production that gives new meaning to the song’s lyrics, mixing in an added nod to modern dating and relationships. The verses have some pockets of emptiness due to lacking production quality, but the female duo provides uplifting harmonies to build a solid hook. Though many country music fans are familiar with Butts’s sound, especially in Texas and Oklahoma, the single serves as a welcome introduction for emerging artist Lola Kirke.\n\n8.1\n\nLife Had Plans For Me – HARDY, HIXTAPE, Joe Diffie (feat. Parker Diffie) Written By Creed Miller\n\nAfter the initial taste of HIXTAPE Vol. 3: DIFFTAPE we got in November, it seemed like they used their big-ticket features for the promotional singles. Now that the rest of the collection is out, we’ve learned there was much to be excited about, including the all-star cast of country icons represented. Despite the tracklist being filled with hits, one of the biggest highlights is “Life Had Plans For Me,” the only song from DIFFTAPE that wasn’t previously released in Diffie’s life. It is recorded by HARDY, Parker Diffie (Diffie’s oldest son), and features vocals from the late Joe Diffie. Parker Diffie was heavily involved in developing the third edition of HIXTAPE to ensure his dad was appropriately honored. “Life Had Plans For Me” is about how life doesn’t always go as planned; there are bumps in the road that force you to take unexpected turns, but they usually all work out for the best. It’s particularly emotional as Parker got to sing a song with his dad one final time that reflects on life. One standout aspect is HARDY’S vocals. He takes on the chorus and helps take the track to the next level. We’ve begun to get used to his rock side, so it was refreshing to hear that country’s voice from the cross-genre star. All of the artist’s voices pair beautifully with one another, creating smooth transitions between the three singers. HIXTAPE Vol. 3 was a pleasant surprise, and the closing track may be the best tribute to the late great star here.\n\n9.0\n\nWorst Way – Riley Green Written By Creed Miller\n\nRiley Green shared a new tease of his forthcoming EP with the lustful single “Worst Way.” The self-penned track carries themes similar to some of his other songs, such as “When She Comes Home Tonight.” Green has always been an excellent songwriter and has never strayed away from attacking the topic of intimacy head-on. He doesn’t beat around the bush whatsoever; nay, he makes his desires overwhelmingly clear. Overall, it’s a good single, but it could be better. The production is downright excellent, as the band keeps things cool with a bluesy rhythm. Still, Riley Green has set a high bar for himself through the years, and there could’ve been more done to reach it, especially lyrically, given the thematic similarities to “When She Comes Home Tonight.” Even so, it’s not a bad song, and Green continues to prove why he’s one of the most consistent artists in country music with more music on the way.\n\n7.8\n\nWhy In the World – Carson Jeffrey Written By Cam Greene\n\nCarson Jeffrey’s “Why In the World” is a foot-tapping tune full of life and strong personality. It’s a groovy heartbreak song that flows like a car down an open highway. Jeffrey describes a girl with nearly every perfection a man could ever ask for, but she’s now left him heartbroken, and he’s asking God why He made her. Like many of Jeffrey’s tracks, it’s instrumentally strong, with a good amount of twists and turns that take this single to another level. Written with David Philip Whitbeck, the lyrics are simple, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that it’s got a deceptively deep story to tell. It’s easy to picture the man in the story pleading to God while at church about why He would do this to him. Jeffrey has been putting together quite a string of great tracks lately, with an uncommon groove and a southern twang. It’s not a stretch to say he’s on the precipice of something great.\n\n8.0\n\nTexas Hold ‘Em – Grace Tyler Written By Adam Delahoussaye\n\nAt face value, this track is about a woman stealing a man from another woman, but if you look a little deeper into Grace Tyler’s “Texas Hold ‘Em,” you realize she’s stealing the man from the state of Texas. The creative writing, penned with Tori Tullier and Kyle Schlienger, is such a breath of fresh air in country music. Tyler plays the role of a woman with some immense power over the man she describes in the song, being able to strip him away from his home state. “Texas Hold ‘Em” also has some great wordplay, and the double-meanings that tribute the Lone Star State while wistfully wishing she could be with this guy are certainly fun. It plays with the typical gender roles of country music pretty well, and brings some life to what could’ve easily been a flat single about a sad girl chasing a guy.\n\n7.6\n\nWind Up Missin’ You – Tucker Wetmore Written By Max Buondonno\n\nMost of Tucker Wetmore’s appeal may stem from the fact that he sounds a lot like a particular Sneedville native, but his sophomore single, “Wind Up Missin’ You,” has plenty of charm all its own. Leaning into the snarls and southern drawl that gave Morgan Wallen his signature sound, Wetmore sings to a woman he met at a bar and fantasizes about life if he doesn’t wind up with her for the rest of his life. The song, written by Wetmore, Chris LaCorte, and Thomas Archer, has gone viral on TikTok in anticipation of its release, primarily thanks to the infectious chorus that caught the attention of romantics everywhere. Many have questioned whether the snippets could live up to the full version of the track, but it’s easy to say that it does. Its modern-day Nashville production, blended with a solid vocal performance from Wetmore, makes this one of the most replayable songs of 2024 so far, as evidenced by the fact it’s accumulated over 1,000,000 streams in its first weekend on Spotify. If Wetmore’s first full-length project (in whatever shape it takes) is anything like this, he could easily be more than just a viral sensation.\n\n8.0"
