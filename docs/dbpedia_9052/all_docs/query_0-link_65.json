        "text": "Chick Corea (born June 12, 1941, Chelsea, Massachusetts, U.S.—died February 9, 2021) was a classically trained American jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader whose piano style and tunes were extensively imitated.\n\nDuring the mid-1960s Corea played with Blue Mitchell, Willie Bobo, Cal Tjader, and Herbie Mann and in the late 1960s with Stan Getz and Miles Davis. Corea led his own groups called Circle and Return to Forever during the 1970s. With a piano style developed from those of Bill Evans, Horace Silver, and McCoy Tyner (with a touch of Paul Hindemith), he became the principal model for most young jazz pianists of the 1970s. The interval of a fourth is prominent in his left-hand figures. A Spanish flavour is common in much of his composing and improvising, the pieces “Spain” and “La Fiesta” being especially popular. His “Windows” became a jazz standard."
