Jann Arden: “Run Like Mad”

Modern streaming services have replaced Cole’s tune with a stand-in song (equally as good IMO) called “Run Like Mad” by Jann Arden, but true die-hard fans will always recognize the former as the “real” theme song. I’m including “Run Like Mad” here because it deserves some attention (however there don’t seem to be any full versions of the song).
