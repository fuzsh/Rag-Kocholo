I have been preparing for around 20 years in one form or another for this work, and then spent more than 25 years working on it directly, collecting facts and evidence piecemeal and sometimes in handfuls, reflecting on the past, discussing it with friends and like-thinkers and arguing with opponents. I met and spoke with Old Bolsheviks who went through the Stalin prisons and camps, including a few surviving supporters of various sorts of opposition as well as certain miraculously sur¬ viving former SRs, Mensheviks and anarchists, with nonparty technical specialists, with former military and priests, with party leaders and regular workers, with former “kulaks” and those who “dekulakized” them, with former Chekists, with emigrees returning to the USSR as well as those who were endeavoring to emi¬ grate. I began writing the book in 1962. The real threat of Stalin’s rehabilitation which arose in 1969 led me to a decision to publish my work about him (“For the Court of History”) abroad. The first edition came out in 1971-1972 in the United States, England and a majority of the European countries as well as in Japan; the second edition was in Russian in 1974 in the United States and in 1981, in Chinese in Beijing. I continued collecting materials. In the 1970’s, there was an opportunity to become familiar with virtually all the books about Stalin and Stalinism published in various countries as well as accumulate facts and evidence. Thus, gradually a new more extensive book of around 80 printer’s pages was prepared. It was published in the United States by Columbia University. Speaking frankly, with this I would have preferred ending my work on the subject “Stalin and Stalinism.” However, since the end of 1986, our nation has begun a new stage of revelations and criticisms of Stalinism and Stalin’s crimes were dis¬ cussed at the Central Committee Plenums and at the 19th All-Union CPSU Conference. I was unable to remain indifferent from this important purgative work of restoring the historical truth, all the more as there was an opportunity to publish my articles and books in the Soviet press. I had to take up my pen. In my essays the reader will find a number of facts and materials already known to him from other publications of the last 3 years. I cannot, however, fully exclude these materials in order not to violate the logic of exposition. These essays are a magazine version of the book based both on previous and new materials concerning Stalin and Stalinism. A separate work will appear on the accomplices of Stalin’s crimes. I have also decided to make a separate book of the analysis of events of the Patriotic War and the postwar times. I would like to take this occasion to voice my gratitude to all of those who helped me in the work. These essays as, incidentally, my other books, are a private investigation, and I have not consulted with anyone on either the times of their completion, their conclusions or their ideas. I have not employed any archives, any “special repositories,” any secret materials and am not acquainted with them. I have not resorted to arty conspiracy, as this would have excluded the possi¬ bility of discussing the manuscript with friends. I have not requested nor received any assistance from officials institutions, nor have I encountered any major obstacles in my work. Part 1: The Rise of Stalinism Stalin at the Head of the VKP(h) 1 Stalin was born on 9 (21) December 1879 in the small Georgian town of Gori in the family of a poor cobbler Vissarion Ivanovich Dzhugashvili, an uneducated and rough man. Soon after the birth of Soso (Stalin’s name in childhood), he abandoned the family and moved to Tiflis (Tbilisi) where for a certain time he worked at a shoe mill, he lived in poverty, took sick and died, when Stalin was still a juvenile. Stalin’s mother, Yekaterina Georgiyevna, nee Geladze, like her husband, came from a peasant family. She worked all her life as a seamstress and laundress. She had no time for raising her son and Soso spent a large part of the day out on the street. In childhood he contracted smallpox, leaving marks on his face. Among the various nicknames under which Stalin would later figure in the police documents was that of “pockface.” In a road accident, the 12-year-old Stalin injured his left arm and in time this was shorter and weaker than the right one. Stalin carefully concealed his partial withering of the arm, he avoided undressing in front of others and rarely showed it even to physicians. He did not like to swim and did not learn how. When resting on the Black Sea, he usually walked along the beach without undressing. From childhood Stalin stood out in his stubbornness and desire to surpass contemporaries and he read a good deal. Short and physically weak, he could not hope for success in boyish fights and was afraid of being beaten. From his adolescence he became secretive and vengeful and all his life disliked tall and physically strong persons. A desire for glory early on possessed the minds and feelings of Stalin. But he was poor, he was a “non- Russian” and realized that a poor Georgian youth from JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 2 a small provincial town could not achieve much in Tsarist Russia. The young Stalin was strongly impressed by the books of the Georgian writer A. Kazbegi, partic¬ ularly the novel “Ottseubiytsa” [Patricide] dealing with the struggle of the peasant mountaineers for their inde¬ pendence and freedom. One of the heroes in the novel, the intrepid Koba, became a hero also for the young Stalin, and he even began to call himself Koba. This name was his party alias; the Old Bolsheviks in the 1930’s (and Molotov and Mikoyan even later), in talking to Stalin, frequently called him Koba. Stalin had a number of party aliases such as “Ivanovich,” “Vasiliy” and “Vasilyev.” But the name Koba and the pseudonym last name of Stalin remained. When the boy was 8 years old, his mother sent him to the Gori Parochial School. Stalin took 6 years for the 4-year course at the school. It was difficult for him, as instruc¬ tion was predominantly in Russian. Stalin wrote Russian well, however he did not learn to speak it freely; he spoke Russian slowly, quietly and with a strong Georgian accent. In 1894, Stalin was admitted to the Tiflis Semi¬ nary. In the parochial school and particularly in the seminary there reigned a situation of obscurantism, hypocrisy, constant petty supervision and reciproeal denunciations. Here there were strict order and almost military discipline. It is not surprising that the seminar¬ ies in Russia produced not only faithful servants of the regime and the Church but also revolutionaries. The seminary undoubtedly influenced Stalin in another regard as well: it also developed his previously inherent craftiness, cleverness and coarseness. Dogmatism and intolerance as well as a catechismic style inherent to his articles and speeches were also formed, indisputably, under the influence of a clerical education. From early youth Stalin was eompletely devoid of a sense of humor. “That strange Georgian,” his seminary friends were to say later. “He did not know how to joke at all. He did not understand jokes and responded with swearing and threats to the most innocent ones.” While a seminarist, Stalin came into contact not only with the first Marxist circles but also with the first worker groups who had organized at the Tiflis enter¬ prises. He beeame a member of the Mesame-dasi, the first Georgian Social Democratic organization. He read many books of the Russian artistic classics and also took a liking for reading underground literature. It was at this time that he became familiar with the works of K. Marx and F. Engels. According to the official version, in May 1 899, Stalin was expelled from the seminary preeisely for reading banned literature and for establishing a Social Democratic circle. He was hired by the Tiflis Geophysics Observatory. In 1900, Stalin became acquainted with the 32-year-old professional revolutionary Viktor Kurnatovskiy who had arrived in Tiflis and was later arrested here. Not long before his arrival in Georgia, the exiled Kurnatovskiy met Lenin in Minusinsk. Acquaintanee with Kurnatovskiy, the reading of the works of V.I. Lenin and later the newspaper ISKRA which began appearing in the Transeaucasus in 1 90 1 made the young Stalin a supporter of Lenin. After the split of the Russian Social Democratic Movement into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Stalin decisively took the side of the Bolsheviks. It should be pointed out, however, that the influence of the Menshevik faction was predominant precisely in Georgia. In the spring of 1901, Stalin went underground. He took part in organizing strikes and demonstrations, including the well-known Batumi Demonstration in March 1 902. Here, in Batumi, Stalin was arrested and exiled to Eastern Siberia where he spent around 2 years. Even then Stalin was not only a practicing revolutionary but also claimed the role of a theoretician, in any event on the level of the Transeaucasus. In 1900-1910, Stalin wrote many articles and pamphlets, virtually all in Georgian, and published them in the Georgian Social Democratic press. The works of this period make up the first two volumes in the complete collected works of Stalin, and a large portion of them was translated from Georgian only in 1945-1946. Of course, the publications by Stalin from the beginning of the century neither in terms of number nor quality can be put on the same footing as the creativity of many other leaders of Russian Social Democracy. But it would be wrong to speak about the creative sterility of the young Stalin. The Revolution of 1 905-1907 made it possible for Stalin to evidence certain other of his abilities. It was precisely he who was assigned to carry out several major terroristic acts or, as they were termed them, “exes,” that is, expropriations. These were basically armed robberies of banks, postal coaches and steamships. At that time the Bolsheviks permitted this as a means for replenishing the party finances and purchasing weapons as well as for influencing the Tsarist Administration. The armed rob¬ bery of the Tiflis Treasury gained particularly great renown as this brought the Bolshevik cash reserves more than 300,000 rubles. This “ex” was conducted by a group of fighters including Kamo (S.A. Ter-Petrosyan), how¬ ever participating in its organization and planning were Stalin and L.B. Krasin, the leader of the “fighting technical group under the Central Committee.” In 1907, Stalin went to work on the Baku organization of the RSDRP [Russian Social Democratic Workers Party]. Involvement in the “exes” made his presence in Tiflis unsafe. Moreover, the Mensheviks prevailed in the Georgian Social Democratic Movement and they were decisive opponents of terror. Stalin participated in orga¬ nizing the largest actions of the Baku working class in those times, attracting the attention of V.I. Lenin. Sev¬ eral times Stalin was arrested and exiled but each time he succeeded in escaping the resuming his illegal work in the Caucasus. From Stalin’s personal life during this period we must point out the death of his first wife, Yekaterina JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 3 Svanidze, after several years of marriage. Stalin was very attached to his young wife and her death did not con¬ tribute to a softening of his character. Stalin’s son, Yakov, remained a ward of relatives, and his father was little concerned and thought little about him. In 1911-1912, Stalin lived largely in St. Petersburg and Moskov. His articles frequently appeared in the St. Petersburg newspaper ZVEZDA and later in the news¬ papers PRAVDA and SOTSIAL-DEMOKRAT. At the Sixth (Prague) All-Russian Conference of the RSDRP held in January 1912, Stalin was coopted into the membership of the party Central Committee as well as included in the membership of the Central Committee Russian Buro. The rather strong self-assurance and at the same time the independence of Stalin can be seen from the fact that he agreed with Lenin on far from everything, although he was part of the Bolshevik faction. In 1910-1912, Stalin was not inclined, like Lenin, to heighten and deepen the struggle between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. Prior to the Prague Conference in a letter to M. Tskhakaya, he described Lenin’s struggle to restore the party organization as a “tempest in a teacup.” After the Prague Conference, he demanded, in contrast to Lenin, concessions for the so-called “liquidators.” In Stalin’s first article for PRAVDA, he spoke of the unity of the Social Democrats “at whatever the cost,” and “without the difference of factions.” Stalin met Lenin for the first at the Tammerfors Confer¬ ence of the Bolsheviks in 1 905, and then met him at the Fourth and Fifth RSDRP Congresses. These meetings left a deep impression in his memory. A closer personal acquaintance came about only at the end of 1 9 1 2, when Koba, who had taken an active part in the organization and editing of the first legal Bolshevik newspaper PRAVDA, traveled to Krakow to see Lenin at a Central Committee conference with party workers. Here, in Poland, Stalin wrote his work “Marxism and the Nation¬ ality Question” which was commented on positively by Lenin. At that time, Stalin made the best impression on Lenin. In one of the letters to Gorky, Lenin wrote, “we have a miraculous Georgian who came in and wrote a major article for PROSVESHCHENIYE, having col¬ lected all the Austrian and other materials.”' In line with the work of editing PRAVDA, Lenin several times wrote to Stalin himself then. However, these ties were so tentative that Lenin soon forgot Stalin’s last name. “Do you remember of Koba?” Lenin asked G. Zinovyev in July 1915.^ Zinovyev did not recall and in November 1915, Lenin wrote V.A. Karpinskiy: “A major favor: learn (from Stepko or Mikha and so forth) the last name of ‘Koba’ (Iosif D...?? We have forgotten). This is very important!!”^ The problem was that Lenin had received a letter from Stalin from his Turukhansk exile and could not reply without remembering the last name. Stalin spent 4 years in the remote Turukhansk area. In the small colony of exiles he behaved far from the best. For example, the wife of the Bolshevik Filipp Zakharov, R.G. Zakharova, in her memoirs about her husband related the following about Stalin’s arrival in exile in 1913. “Filipp told me about meeting with Stalin there, in Turukhansk.... According to an unwritten law it was accepted that each comrade newly arriving in exile would give information on the situation in Russia. From whom could one expect a more interesting, profound examination of all that was happening if not from a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee? The group of exiles which included Ya.M. Sverdlov and Filipp at this time was working in the village of Monastyrskoye.... Stalin was also to arrive there. Dubrovinskiy was no longer alive. Filipp who by nature was not inclined to set up idols for himself and in addition had heard from Dubrovinskiy a dispassionate assessment of all the then prominent leaders of the revolution, was awaiting Sta¬ lin’s arrival without any particular anticipation. This was in contrast to Sverdlov who endeavored to do everything possible under those conditions to receive Stalin ceremoniously. A separate room was prepared for him and some comestibles were stored up from our very meager supplies. He had arrived!! He went into the room prepared for him and...was not seen anymore! He did not make any report on the situation in Russia. Sverdlov was very embarrassed.... Stalin was dispatched to the village assigned to him and soon thereafter it was learned that he had seized and taken with him all the books of Dubrovinskiy. At the same time the exiles before his arrival had decided upon general agreement that Dubrovinskiy’s library, as a memorial to him, would be considered general property, like a traveling library. By what right had one man taken possession of it? Hot¬ headed Filipp set off for an explanation. Stalin ”received“ him like some Tsarist general would receive a rank-and-file soldier who dared report to him with some demand. Indignant Filipp (everyone was indignant!) for his entire life kept a feeling of resentment from this conversation and never altered his unflattering opinion of Stalin which he formed then....” Stalin did not behave any better in the village of Kureyka which had been assigned for him to serve out his exile. He quarreled with virtually all the exiled Bolsheviks, including with Ya.M. Sverdlov. “There are two of us,” Sverdlov wrote to his wife in 1913. “With me is the Georgian Dzhugashvili, an old acquaintance. A good fellow but too great an individualist in everyday life.” Having lived next to Stalin for a certain time, Sverdlov commented about him in more critical terms. In May 1 9 1 4, he wrote: “A comrade is with me (in Kureyka). But we know each other too well. And the most lamentable of all is that under the conditions of exile and prison, a person reveals himself to us and shows all his petty details.... The comrade now has a different apartment and we rarely see one another.” Exile, particularly exile to the Turukhansk area was a harsh punishment. But this still was not forced labor and JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 4 many of the “politicals” used the enforced idleness for adding to their knowledge, for creative work and for exchanging opinions. But Stalin as unable to work in captivity. His last work published in the second volume of the Collected Works is dated January-February 1913, while the first work in the third volume is March 1917. It cannot be said that Stalin took no part in party life. In the summer of 1915, he was present at a meeting of the members of the Central Committee Russian Buro and the Bolshevik faction of the State Duma and which had been deprived of its powers and exiled to Siberia. In 1916, together with a group of Bolsheviks, he signed a letter of request to the journal VOPROSY STRAKHOVANIYA. However, most of the time Stalin spent in idleness. 2 The beginning of 1917 found Stalin in Krasnoyarsk. Inducted together with a group of exiles into the army, he did not pass the medical commission as he was consid¬ ered unfit for service because of his weak left arm. Exile was coming to an end and Stalin was permitted to serve the rest of it in Krasnoyarsk. He established contact with certain of the Krasnoyarsk Bolsheviks and spent a large portion of the evenings with L.B. Kamenev who also had been exiled to Siberia. For a majority of the population and for the politicians, the revolution was a surprise, although many were expecting it. The complete and rapid collapse of the entire repressive system of Tsarism was one of the first results of the February Revolution. The policemen took off their uniforms and hid. The gates of the prisons were opened and the Tsarist forced labor and exile ceased functioning. Not only the political prisoners but also a predominant majority of the common criminals were given their freedom. On 3 March 1917, a soviet was organized in Krasnoy¬ arsk. It immediately assumed power and decreed the arrest of the Tsarist authorities. A special train was dispatched to return the exiles to Moscow and Petrograd. Stalin together with Kamenev and M.K. Muranov immediately set off for the capital. During the very first days of March 1 9 1 7, in Petrograd the Bolsheviks emerged from underground and took measures to publish PRAVDA as well as form a party leadership. All the member of the Central Committee Russian Buro which had been established at the Prague Conference during these days were either in exile or in emigration. For this reason, during the war years a new buro had been orga¬ nized and of its membership A.G. Shlyapnikov, P.A. Zalutskiy and V.M. Molotov were in Petrograd. On 7-8 March, the Russian Buro coopted into its membership several persons including M.I. Kalinin, V.N. Zalezhskiy, M.I. Ulyanov and M.S. Olminskiy. The first issue of PRAVDA came out on 5 March and it was edited by K.S. Yeremeyev, M.I. Kalinin and V.M. Molotov. Naturally, with the arrival of the Bolshevik exiles from Siberia, the question arose of including them as members of the new party centers. Difficulties and frictions were inevitable. For example, on 1 2 March 1917, on the day that Stalin, Kamenev and Muranov arrived in Petrograd, there was a session of the Central Committee Buro. The minutes of this session record the following: “Then the question was settled of Comrades Muranov, Stalin and Kamenev. The first was invited unanimously. As for Stalin, it was reported that he had been a Central Committee agent in 1912 and for this reason it was desirable to have as a member of the BTsK [Central Committee Buro], but due to certain personal traits inherent to him, the BTsK was in favor of including him with a consultative vote.” We do not know the details of the clash between Stalin and the new BTsK members. The Bolsheviks returning from exile were more experienced and older. Stalin, in addition, had not merely been the “Central Committee agent,” but the only Central Committee member in Petrograd and elected at the RSDRP Prague Conference. Naturally, on the next day he was included in the membership of the BTsK. On the same day, a new editorial staff of PRAVDA was approved including M.S. Olminskiy, I. Stalin, K.S. Yeremeyev, M.I. Kalinin and M.I. Ulyanov. But Stalin actually took control of the newspaper. Already on 15 March, issue No. 9 of PRAVDA stated that Stalin, Kamenev and Muranov were members of the editorial personnel. No mention was even made of the remaining editorial members approved by the BTsK. Stalin’s conduct evoked a protest from the Petrograd Bolsheviks. Here it was not merely a question of the membership of PRAVDA’s editors but also its political and tactical concepts. In its very first issues, PRAVDA urged a struggle against the Provisional Government as well as against the policy of the Menshevik and SR parties which were endeavoring to come to terms with the bourgeois parties and the Provisional Government. This corresponded to those first recommendations which had arrived in Russia from Lenin. However, from issue No. 9 of the newspaper, both the tone and the content of the main articles changed. PRAVDA came out in support of the Provisional Government “to the degree that the actions of this government assist the development of the revolution.” PRAVDA was quite definitely in favor of uniting with the Mensheviks into a single party within which both factions could overcome their differences. In favoring peace, PRAVDA urged the Russian soldiers to firmly hold the front until peace would be concluded. The Petrograd Bolshevik organization could protest, however the articles in PRAVDA were a guide for all the party organizations in the nation. Before the appearance of Lenin in Petrograd, Stalin actually headed not only the editorial staff of PRAVDA but also for a short time the entire party. JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 5 Undoubtedly, Kamenev played the leading role in shap¬ ing the new line of PRAVDA. But Stalin fully supported him both as the actual editor of the newspaper and the author of a number of articles. Their line stemmed from the party slogans from the times of the 1905-1907 Revolution, when the question of stages of revolution was not linked to the question of war and actual dual power which had come into being in Russia in the spring of 1917. Kamenev and Stalin did not understand those new opportunities which had now opened up for the working class and the Bolsheviks. Only Lenin initially understood them and he had a difficult time persuading the party. It must be printed out that PRAVDA printed the first series of Lenin’s founding letters in an abridged form, and the next three letters were not published at all. Stalin and Kamenev defended their position at the All-Russian Conference of Party Workers held in Petrograd on 27 March — 2 April 1917. Even after Lenin’s arrival, when his famous “April Theses” were published in PRAVDA, Kamenev, with Stalin’s support, on the following day published an article with a harsh criticism of these theses. Only by the end of April after hot polemics did Lenin succeed in turning both the line of the Central Committee as well as the line of PRAVDA, having convinced a majority of the Central Committee of his rectitude. Stalin sided with Lenin while Kamenev did not agree with him on many ques¬ tions concerning the development of the revolution. Later on Stalin was repeatedly forced to admit the erroneousness of the position held by him in March 1917. “...This was a profoundly mistaken position,” he said in one of the speeches, “for it fostered pacifist illusions, it played into the hands of defensism and impeded the revolutionary education of the masses. I shared this erroneous position then with other party comrades....” At the Seventh (April) All-Russian Conference of the RSDRP (Bolshevik), a party Central Committee was elected consisting of just 12 members and candidate members. Both Stalin and Kamenev were included in this Central Committee. In the spring and summer of 1917, infinite meetings were held throughout Russia. All parties and the Bolshe¬ vik party in particular were fighting for influence on the masses of people. For the Bolsheviks it was important not only to work out political slogans which were close to the feelings of the people but also send skillful agitators, orators and propagandists to the enterprises and troop units. Stalin was little suitable for this. From March through October 1917, he took the floor at public meet¬ ings only three times. He had no qualities for becoming a tribune of the revolution and even his later apologists recognized this. Not having any oratorial gifts, Stalin undoubtedly possessed an extraordinary organizational talent. The size of the Bolshevik party was growing month by month with unusual speed and Stalin along with Ya.M. Sverdlov reduced the party ranks to a military order. Precisely Stalin and Sverdlov carried out the main portion of the work involving the preparations and holding of the Sixth Bolshevik Party Congress. Precisely Stalin gave the political report on behalf of the Central Committee at this congress. We should note the insufficient clarity of Stalin’s position on the question of the appearance of V.I. Lenin before the court of the Provisional Government. Stalin admitted the possibility of Lenin’s appearance before the authorities with certain guarantees. The Sixth Party Congress elected a larger and more representative Central Committee membership. For the first time, L.D. Trotsky was elected a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee. In the absence of Lenin and Zinovyev, Stalin’s role in the leadership of the party organizations increased. During these months he was the actual leader of the party central newspaper which came out under various names. The opinions of Lenin leading the party from underground and Stalin who was in a legal position coincided far from always. In this instance Stalin subjected Lenin’s articles to arbitra^ editing and this caused dissatisfaction with Vladimir Ilich. He was in a hurry to overthrow the Provisional Government and was extremely dissatisfied with the Central Committee’s slowness: “To slow down is a crime. To wait for the congress of soviets is a child’s game of formalism, a disgraceful game of formalism and betrayal of the revo¬ lution.” “There is no middle ground. We cannot wait. The revolution will perish.” “The Bolsheviks have an incorrect attitude toward parliamentarianism at moments of revolutionary crises.” “There can be no doubt that in the ‘upper reaches’ of the party there are vacillations which can become fatal.” “Not everything is going alright in the ‘parliamentary’ upper reaches of the party.” “In seeing that the Central Committee has left my urgings even unanswered..., and that the Central Organ is deleting from my articles instructions on such flagrant errors by the Bolsheviks as the disgraceful deci¬ sion to participate in the parliament..., seeing this, I should view this ‘delicate’ hint.. .of shutting my mouth and as a proposal to remove me. “I must submit a request to withdraw from the Central Committee and that I am doing and leave for myself the freedom of agitation in the grass roots of the party and at the party congress.””* The disagreements with the Central Committee led Lenin to a decision to return to Petrograd to take over preparations for the armed insurrection. Stalin participated in the decisive sessions of the RSDRP(b) Central Committee on 10 (23) and 16 (29) October and at which upon Lenin’s reports a decision was taken for an armed insurrection. Only L. Kamenev and G. Zinovyev voted against this decision and they in violation of all rules of conspiracy published their argu¬ ments in the non-Bolshevik newspaper NOVAYA ZHIZN. As is known, Lenin demanded that Zinovyev I JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 6 and Kamenev be expelled from the party. Stalin was the only Central Committee member who argued against Lenin on this question. What was Stalin doing on 24-26 October 1917, that is, during the crucial days and hours of the October Armed Insurrection in Petrograd? Well known is the role in organizing and preparing this insurrection of the Petrograd Soviet which during these days was headed by L. Trotsky. Upon Lenin’s proposal, under the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, in mid-October a Military Revolutionary Committee (VRK) was founded and this was put in charge of working out all the details of the insurrection. V. Antonov-Ovseyenko and N. Podvoyskiy carried out par¬ ticularly extensive work in the leading Buro of the VRK. During these days, also very significant was the role of such Bolshevik party leaders as Ya. Sverdlov, P. Dybenko, V. Bolodarskiy, N. Krylenko, F. Raskolnikov, A. Bubnov, F. Dzerzhinskiy, G. Bokiy, V. Avanesov, K. Veremeyev and others. As for Stalin, during this time he was chiefly concerned with publishing the newspaper RABOCHIY PUT. He did not directly lead the actions of the Red Guard, the sailors and soldiers on the streets of Petrograd. In essence, the entire version of some particular role played by Stalin in organizing the October Armed Insur¬ rection hangs on the very delicate thread, on the decision of the Bolshevik Party Central Committee of 1 6 October to organize a “Party Center” or “Military-Revolutionary Center” for leading the insurrection and with a member¬ ship of Sverdlov, Stalin, Dzerzhinskiy, Bubnov and Uritskiy. It was assumed that this center would exist under the VRK and direct its work. However, events in Petrograd developed so quickly that the formally estab¬ lished “Party Center” actually had not met and did not function as a special body for directing the insurrection. Also remaining just on paper was the decision of the Party Central Committee to organize a certain “Political Buro” consisting of seven men; this was adopted at a session on 10 October 1917. It is no surprise that in his book on the October Revolution, the American commu¬ nist John Reed, an eyewitness to the events described by him, gave virtually no attention to Stalin.® In all the articles, pamphlets and letters written by V.I. Lenin and published in Vol. 34 of his Complete Collected Works (July-October 1917), Stalin’s name is mentioned once and in the context of one of the errors made by Stalin, Sokolonikov and Dzerzhinskiy. From the minutes of the RSDRP(b) Central Committee we can learn that in the morning of 24 October, assembling at Smolnyy was a new session of the Central Committee at which duties were assigned to the Central Committee members for leading the insurrection. Stalin was not present at this session, and he was not given any assignment. As one can judge from other documents, Stalin spent 24 and 25 October at the editorial offices of the newspaper RAB¬ OCHIY PUT as well as among delegates of the Bolshevik faction of the Second Congress of Soviets. A transition of power into the hands of the soviets was the result of the victorious armed insurrection in Petrograd. The Provisional Government was over¬ thrown. It was replaced by a worker-peasant govern¬ ment, the Council of People’s Commissars of the Rus¬ sian Republic, which had been elected by the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets. V.I. Lenin became the chairman of the Soviet government and 14 Bolsheviks became its members or people’s commissars. 1. Stalin was among these and he was entrusted to head the People’s Commissariat for Nationality Affairs which was formed for the first time. One of the most important slogans of the October Revolution was the slogan of the liberation and equal rights of all nations and nationalities in the former Tsarist Russia. This determined the importance of the new Commissariat for Nationality Affairs. Stalin became its first leader with good reason. He was not only one of the leading figures in the Bolshevik Party, but he was also a Georgian, that is, “non-Russian.” The appoint¬ ment hence should have increased confidence in the Council of People’s Commissars in the nationality areas and regions of Russia. Moreover, after a series of articles on the nationality question published in 1913, Stalin began to be considered an expert in nationality problems within the party. On 2 November 1917, Stalin along with Lenin signed the “Declaration of the Rights of the Russian Peoples.” This declaration the draft of which had been written by Lenin proclaimed the basic principles of Soviet nationality policy: the lifting of all nationality and religious restric¬ tions or privileges, equality of all peoples, free develop¬ ment of all nationality and ethnic groups, and the right to self-determination even including the separation and formation of independent states. 3 For a majority of the people’s commissars making up the first Soviet government, the chief difficulty was to bring a halt to the sabotage by officials from virtually all the institutions inherited from the Provisional and Tsarist governments. Stalin had no such difficulties, as in Tsa¬ rist Russia there were no institutions analogous to the People’s Commissariat for Nationality Affairs. For this reason it was essential to set up some minimum apparatus. The Polish revolutionary S. Piestkowsky became one of the first figures of the Narkomnats [People’s Commissariat for Nationality Affairs] and the organizer of its miniscule apparatus. Stalin’s entire com¬ missariat was located in one of the rooms at Smolnyy, not far from the office of V.I. Lenin. Certainly there still was no well conceived work plan for the Narkomnats for an extended period. Questions, and often the most unexpected and difficult, arose spontaneously. For example, from November 1917 through January 1918, Stalin was participating in talks with the Central Rada, an association of several nationalistic petty bourgeois JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 7 parties organized in the Ukraine. At that time, S.V. Petlyura headed the Central Rada. Initially the Ukrai¬ nian People’s Republic declared itself to be a federative part of Russia, but at the end of January 1918, it proclaimed the complete independence of the Ukraine. Talks with the Rada were broken off. As a counterweight to the Central Rada, the Bolsheviks and leftist SRs established the First All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets in Kharkov and proclaimed the establishing of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. After the Second All-Ukrai¬ nian Congress of Soviets at Yekaterinoslav in March 1918, the Bolshevik N.A. Skrypnik became the head of the People’s Secretariat of the Ukraine. At that time virtually the entire Ukraine was occupied by German troops and in Kiev they had organized a promonarchical government of Hetman Skoropadskiy. Nevertheless, Lenin, learning of the decisions of the Second All- Ukrainian Congress of Soviets, drew up a letter of greetings from the RSFSR Sovnarkom [Soviet of Peo¬ ple’s Commissars] to the Soviet Ukraine. This letter expressed “ecstatic sympathy for the heroic struggle of the workers and exploited masses of the Ukraine who are at present one of the leading detachments of the world¬ wide social revolution.’’ At the same time, Stalin on 4 April telegraphed the Soviet Government of the Ukraine; “Enough playing at government and republic, it seems enough, it is time to abandon the game.’’ In response to this message which was inacceptable in tone and content, N.A. Skrypnik sent off a telegram to Mos¬ cow on 6 April: “We would voice the most decisive protest against the action of People’s Commissar Stalin. We should state that the TsIK [Central Executive Committee] of the Ukrainian Soviets and the People’s Secretariat do not base their actions on one or another attitude by one or another people’s commissar of the Russian Federation but rather on the will of the Ukrainian working masses.... Statements similar to the one made by People’s Com¬ missar Stalin are aimed at exploding Soviet power in the Ukraine. ...and contribute directly to the enemies of the working masses.” The Bolsheviks had come out in favor of self-determina¬ tion of nations up to the point of their complete state separation from Russia. However, this in no way meant that the Bolsheviks themselves were ready to welcome the cession of the nationality areas from Russia and assist in this. They were working for the victory of a socialist revolution on all Russian territory and the formation of an union of free peoples and nations here. This would be, in their opinion, the first step toward developing a world proletarian revolution. It must also not be forgotten that the RKP(b) [Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)] was not a Russian party but an all-Russian party. An exception was made only for Poland and Finland where there were independent Social Democratic parties which had been founded sev¬ eral years prior to the RSDRP. Moreover, the movement for independence from Russia in Finland and Poland had gained great scope and support long before 1917. The elections held in October 1917 for the Finnish Parliament provided a majority for the bourgeois par¬ ties, and on 6 December, the Parliament declared Fin¬ land to be an independent state. On 3 1 December 1917, the RSFSR SNK [Council of People’s Commissars] recognized the independence of Finland. The SNK decree was signed by V.I. Lenin and 1. Stalin. Several days later upon Stalin’s report, this decree was also approved by the RSFSR VTsIK [All-Russian Central Executive Committee]. As the people’s commissar for nationality affairs, Stalin made a number of statements and reports at the sessions of the SNK and the VTsIK concerning the situation in Turkestan, in the Caucasus, in the Urals area, on the Don, in Turkish Armenia as well as on the autonomy of the Tatars and the federative institutions of the RSFSR. As a Central Committee member, Stalin participated in all its sessions where the question was discussed of concluding the Brest Peace and the withdrawal of Russia from the imperialist war. The minutes of the RSDRP (b) Central Committee clearly show that Stalin steadily supported the viewpoint of V.I. Lenin, although in the early stages of the discussion, Lenin was in the minority. Only at the session of 1 February, in urging an end to the differences, did Stalin state: “We must put an end to this.... The way out of the difficult situation has been provided for us by a middle way, the position of Trotsky.” However, at the Central Committee Stalin always voted for Lenin’s proposals. The acuteness of the struggle can be seen from the fact that the proposal for an immediate concluding of a peace with Germany was adopted by the Central Committee only on 1 8 February 1918 with a majority of one vote (voting “for” were: Lenin, Smilga, Stalin, Sverdlov, Sokolnikov, Trotsky, Zinovyev; “against”: Uritskiy, Ioffe, Lomov, Bukharin, Krestinskiy and Dzerzhinskiy). 4 Even by the end of the 1 920’s, Stalin was often called the “general of the revolution.” Later on, when a large portion of the Civil War commanders and commissars had been destroyed, they began writing about Stalin as the “immediate inspirer and organizer of the most important victories of the Red Army” and whom the party sent “everywhere that the fate of the revolution was being decided on the fronts.” This myth was destroyed by Soviet historical science even at the beginning of the 1960’s. Let us therefore take up only certain episodes in Stalin’s military activities. Even on 29 May 1918, in line with the aggrevated food situation in Moscow and in the central provinces of Russia, the RSFSR SNK appointed Stalin the overall leader of food affairs in the south of Russia, granting him extraordinary rights. In line with this, Stalin left for Tsaritsyn on 4 June. Here he found disorder and chaos JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 both on food and military matters, in the area of trans¬ port, finances and so forth. In employing his powers, Stalin assumed all authority in the Tsaritsyn area. There is no doubt that in Tsaritsyn he carried out extensive work to instill order in the rear and on the front and in supplying food to the industrial centers of Russia. How¬ ever, Stalin even then chose mass terror as the basic means for instilling this order. He wrote to Lenin: “I drive and curse everyone who must be and I hope that 1 will soon restore [the situation]. You can be confident that we will spare no one, either ourselves or others, and we will provide the grain.” And Stalin actually did not spare anyone. He did not stop, not only from executing scores of actual enemies of Soviet power but even destroying all of those who were merely suspected of ties with the counterrevolution. At one time, K. Ye. Voroshilov wrote about this without any condemnation. Gradually Stalin assumed all the main military functions in the Northern Caucasus. One of his first victims was the military specialists whom he not only removed from their job but also executed. Stalin also showed extreme hostility and mistrust in the military leader of the Northern Caucasus Military Dis¬ trict, A. Ye. Snesarev. A general from the Tsarist Army and a prominent orientalist, A. Ye. Snesarev was one of the first to volun¬ teer for the Red Army. In energetically leading the troops, he had helped organize the defense of Tsaritsyn and halt the White Cossacks. Nevertheless, precisely during this time, Stalin sent off a telegram to Moscow accusing Snesarev of sabotage. The plan for the defense of the city as proposed by Snesarev was considered by Stalin to be treachery. Ultimately, he arbitrarily not only removed but also arrested Snesarev. Upon Stalin’s orders, virtually the entire military district staff made up of military specialists had been arrested. A floating prison was established on one of the barges in the Volga and this sank together with a majority of the prisoners under unclear circumstances. Upon Stalin’s insistence, a new plan for the defense of Tsaritsyn was worked out. A portion of the troops was removed from the northern sector of the front for an offensive to the west and south of Tsaritsyn. As military historians V. Dudnik and D. Smirnov have shown, “this disrupted the stability of the defenses organized with such difficulty.... On 1 August, this unsupported offensive began and by 4 August, contact with the south was broken and the city was cut off from the center. Immediately units had to be shifted to the northern combat sector.” Stalin heaped the blame for the unsuccessful offensive on the former military leader Snesarev from whom he had sup¬ posedly inherited a completely disordered system. The situation of Tsaritsyn in mid-August 1918 was particularly severe as the White Cossacks had reached 8 the near-approaches to the city. However, the Red Army by the end of August was able to break the ring of encirclement and push the enemy behind the Don. On 11 September 1918, the Southern Front was estab¬ lished (commander, P.P. Sytin, Military Council mem¬ bers I.V. Stalin, K.Ye. Voroshilov and K.A. Mekhon- ishin). Sharp differences of opinion arose between Stalin, Voroshilov and Minin as “old Tsaritsyners,” on the one hand, and Sytin and Mekhonishin, on the other. The Tsaritsyn workers as before did not want to trust the military specialists and endeavored to introduce collec¬ tive troop command which had been repudiated by the party. Upon Stalin’s insistence, the RVS [Revolutionary- Military Council] of the Southern Front repealed the first operation orders of Sytin and then removed him from the command of the front. At precisely this time, the enemy began a new offensive against Tsaritsyn and squeezed the weakened Red Army units. The situation was saved by the Steel Division of D.B. Zhloba which had arrived from the Northern Caucasus and surprise attacked the enemy in the rear. Stalin as before had not given too much consideration to the orders of the Narkomvoyenmor [People’s Commis¬ sariat of Military and Naval Affairs] and the Republic RVS. On one of the orders from Trotsky, he applied the resolution: “Do not take into account.” The arising conflict told negatively upon the battleworthiness of the Southern Front. Upon the insistence of L. Trotsky, Stalin was removed from the RVS of the Southern Front and sent to Moscow, but, with the approval of Trotsky, he was appointed a member of the Republic RVS. At the end of 1918, Stalin in Moscow as concerned chiefly with the affairs of the Narkomnats. He was present at the First Congress of Moslem Communists in Moscow, he drew up a draft decree on the independence of Estonia and participated in organizing the Belorussian Soviet Repub¬ lic. On 1 January 1919, Stalin and F.E. Dzerzhinskiy were sent to the Eastern Front for studying the setbacks of the Red Army and the reasons for the surrender of Perm. After the situation on the Eastern Front had improved, Stalin and Dzerzhinskiy returned to Moscow. At the Eighth Party Congress, Stalin was reelected to the membership of the RKP(b) Central Committee. Although the Party Central Committee at that time was too numerous, for taking day-to-day decisions on impor¬ tant political questions, it was decided to create a nar¬ rower leading body from it, the Politburo. The first membership of the Politburo included V.I. Lenin, L.B. Kamenev, M.M. Krestinskiy, I.V. Stalin and L.D. Trotsky. N.l. Bukharin, M.I. Kalinin and G.Ye. Zinovyev became Politburo candidate members. Also organized was the Orgburo [Organizational Bureau] of the RKP(b) Central Committee for directing the current organizational work of the party. It also included five JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 9 men: A.G. Beloborodov, N.N. Krestinskiy, L.P. Serebry¬ akov, I.V. Stalin and Ye.D. Stasova. Several days later, by a VTsIK decree, Stalin was also appointed people’s commissar of state control. We will not dwell on the various assignments which Stalin carried out as a representative of the RKP(b) Central Committee and the RVS on the Petrograd, Western and Southern Fronts. These assignments were not “third-rate,” as A. Antonov-Ovseyenko assumes, however they were not as significant as was represented later by Stalin’s apologists. However, we must take up in greater detail the activities of Stalin in 1920 on the Southwestern Front where he had been sent at the end of May as a member of the Military Council. At this time the advancing Polish armies had already been halted; heavy fighting had broken out on the territory of the Ukraine and Belorus- sia, and as a result of this Kiev and Minsk had been liberated. The basic portion of the reinforcements initially had been sent to the Southwestern Front. By the end of July a situation had developed which required an urgent regrouping of the forces. The Western Front which had a total of 60,000 soldiers was being opposed by twice the number of Poles. At the same time, just three Polish divisions and demoralized Petlyura units were operating opposite the Southwestern Front. At the same time, in the South a new threat had arisen to the Soviet republic: the troops of Gen Wrangel in June 1 920 had broken out of the Crimea and had captured a significant part of Northern Tauria. On 20 August 1920, the RKP(b) Central Committee Politburo adopted a decision to unite all the armies fighting against Poland as the Western Front (com¬ mander, M. Tukhachevskiy). At the same time, it was decided to establish an independent Southern Front. Stalin was instructed to organize the new front’s RVS and Lenin sent him the following telegram about this: “Urgent, in code. To Stalin: The Politburo has just split the fronts so that you can be exclusively concerned with Wrangel. In line with the uprisings, particularly in the Kuban and later in Siberia, the danger of Wrangel is becoming enormous and within the Central Committee there is a growing desire to immediately conclude a peace with bourgeois Poland. I would like you to discuss very closely the situation with Wrangel and submit your conclusion.”® At the same time, the Commander-in-Chief S. Kamenev, on the basis of the Central Committee directive, pro¬ posed that in the next few days the 1st Horse Army and the 12th Army of the Southwestern Front be put under the command of the Western Front in order to reinforce the troops on the main, Warsaw axis. Stalin refused to carry out the instructions of Lenin and S. Kamenev. In the evening of the same day he tele¬ graphed back: “I received your note on the splitting of the fronts and the Politburo should not be concerned with minor details. I can work for the front the maximum of another 2 weeks before a vacation so search for a deputy. I do not believe the promises of the commander-in-chief for an instant and he only gives his promises. As for the attitude of the Central Committee in favor of a peace with Poland, one cannot help but notice that our diplomacy is being very successful in undermining the results of our military successes.” On 3 August, Lenin sent Stalin a new telegram, insisting on the splitting of the fronts: “Our diplomacy is subordinate to the Central Commit¬ tee and will never undermine our successes, if the danger of Wrangel does not cause hesitation with the Central Committee.”^ Here Lenin did not argue against Stalin’s leave but asked him to be concerned about a deputy. On 5 August, the Central Committee affirmed the deci¬ sion to split the fronts and ordered that the 1 4th Army also be transferred to the Western Front. The com- mander-in-chief issued the necessary orders for this. But Stalin and the commander of the Southwestern Front, A.I. Yegorov, who was under his influence, did not carry out this directive. The Commander-in-Chief S. Kamenev repeated his order. “The Western Front,” he wrote, “is beginning to launch a decisive thrust to defeat the enemy and capture the Warsaw area; because of this we must temporarily give up the immediate possession of the Lwow area on your sector.” But Stalin and Yegorov did not obey. On the contrary, they issued an order to the 1 st Horse Army “in the shortest period of time by a powerful thrust to destroy the enemy on the right bank of the Bug, to cross the river and on the heels of the fleeing remnants of the 3d and 6th Polish Armies to take the city of Lwow.” The 1st Horse Army was unable to carry out this order. But the Western Front also suffered a setback in the offensive against Warsaw. Of course, the failure of the Warsaw Operation can also be explained by several fac¬ tors. However, Stalin’s arbitrariness certainly is not in last place among them. In possessing strong forces he did not want the laurels of victory to go to the Western Front. Clearly he himself was endeavoring to enter Warsaw from the rear after the taking of Lwow. “But who was marching on Warsaw via Lwow,” commented Lenin on this matter when V.D. Bonch-Bruyevich reported on the setbacks on the Polish Front.® JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 10 Since Stalin had not obeyed the orders of the com- mander-in-chief, the Central Committee Secretariat sent him the following telegram on 14 August: “The friction between you and the commander-in-chief has reached such a point. ..that there must be an expla¬ nation by a joint discussion in a personal meeting and for this reason we request your quickest possible departure for Moscow.” On 1 7 August, Stalin left for Moscow and requested from the Politburo that he be released from military affairs. On 1 September his request was granted. 5 It might be asked: how could Stalin so easily get away with arbitrariness and coarseness? In the first place, in 1918-1920, Stalin was a rather strong figure in the party leadership and knew how to stand up for himself. Not only Stalin but also many other representatives of the Central Committee on the Civil War fronts at times acted with excessive harshness. There were numerous complaints about the RVS representative Trotsky. But Lenin usually came to his defense. In the struggle of the party groupings of those times, Stalin was on the side of Lenin and Lenin valued this. Under the conditions of the Civil War, in the critical situation Lenin had to consider and utilize any real force which was on the side of the revolution. Frequently Lenin directly supported Stalin, as was the case in Krakow when the latter was writing articles on the nationality question, in being coopted into the mem¬ bership of the RSDRP(b) Central Committee and in being appointed to the Central Committee Russian Buro. It was precisely upon Lenin’s proposal that Stalin was appointed the people’s commissar for nationality affairs and the people’s commissar of state control which was later reorganized into the People’s Commissariat of Worker-Peasant Inspection. Trotsky repeatedly demanded that Stalin be removed from military work, however Lenin was in no hurry to do this and at times was more supportive of Stalin than Trotsky. Stalin left military work almost at the very end of the Civil War. This was neither a reduction in rank nor retirement. He had to focus his attention on the work in the Narkomnats; Soviet power had been established in virtually all the nationality areas. Several times Stalin had traveled to the Northern Caucasus and Azerbaijan, and had received delegations from different nationali¬ ties. He gave much less attention to the People’s Com¬ missariat of Worker-Peasant Inspection. He also had to participate in the work of not only the Politburo and Orgburo but also several permanent commissions of the RKP(b) Central Committee as well as the VTsIK. During the period when the party was beset by the so-called trade union debate, Stalin supported Lenin’s platform and came out against the theses of Bukharin and Trotsky, but was not very active. At the Tenth RKP(b) Congress, Stalin gave a report on the nationality question. Soon after the Red Army entered Georgia and Menshevik power had been overthrown in this republic, Stalin traveled to Tiflis. With his participation, a Bol¬ shevik leadership was organized for Georgia and the entire Transcaucasus. However, Stalin’s attempt to speak to the workers ended lamentably: he was whistled down at a meeting of Georgian railroad workers. He left the meeting under the guard of Russian Chekists. Instead, the prominent Menshevik Isidor Ramishvili spoke and he was enthusiastically welcomed by the workers. This failure strengthened Stalin’s distaste for Georgia and subsequently he almost never visited there. At the 11th Party Congress, Ye. A. Preobrazhenskiy proposed that Stalin’s powers be somewhat curtailed. He said: “Or, comrades, let us take, for example. Comrade Stalin, a Politburo member, who is at the same time the people’s commissar of two people’s commissariats. Is it conceivable that a person is able to be responsible for the work of two commissariats and, in addition, the work on the Politburo, the Orgburo and a score Central Committee commis¬ sions?” To this Lenin replied: “Here Preobrazhenskiy has flippantly remarked that Stalin has two commissariats. But who of us has not erred? Who has not taken several duties all at once? And how else could we do it? What could we now do to support the existing situation in the Narkomnats in order to work out all the Turkestan, Caucasian and other questions? Certainly these are political questions! And they must be solved, these are questions which have concerned European states for hundreds of years and which have been resolved only to a miniscule amount in the democratic republics. We are resolving them and we must have a man who could be approached by any of the representatives of the nations and told what the matter is. Where to find him? I feel that Preobrazhenskiy could not name another candidate aside from Comrade Stalin. “As for the Rabkrin [Worker-Peasant Inspection]. The undertaking is gigantic. But in order to be able to handle the check, it is essential that at the head there be a man with authority, otherwise we become mired down and drown in petty intrigues.”^ Lenin was so predisposed to Stalin in 1918-1921 that he himself was concerned for finding a peaceful apartment for Stalin in the Kremlin. He rebuked G. Ordzhonikidze for the fact that the latter had cut short Stalin’s vacation in the Northern Caucasus. Lenin requested that they locate the physician who had treated Stalin and send him [Lenin] a report on the patient’s state. Once, half-joking. JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 11 Lenin proposed that Stalin marry his younger sister Mariya Ilinichna. He was certain that Stalin was still a bachelor and was surprised when Stalin said that he was married and his wife was working on the Central Com¬ mittee Secretariat. Later, however, Lenin’s attitude toward Stalin changed. 6 The 1 1th RKP(b) Congress did not reduce Stalin’s pow¬ ers and he was again elected to membership of the Central Committee. At the Central Committee Plenum of 3 April 1922, Stalin was elected to the Politburo and Orgburo. The Plenum resolved to establish a new posi¬ tion of Central Committee General Secretary and appoint I.V. Stalin to this position. In Stalin’s “Kratkaya biografiya” [Short Biography] one can read that the Plenum elected Stalin the Central Committee General Secretary precisely upon Lenin’s proposal. At the opening of the Central Committee Plenum, L.B. Kamenev was presiding and he proposed that a new membership be elected for the Central Committee Sec¬ retariat. It is impossible to assume that the membership of the Politburo, Orgburo and Secretariat had not been first approved by Lenin. In the “Biograficheskaya khron- ika” [Biographic Chronicle] of V.I. Lenin for 1922, we read: “April 3d. “Lenin participates in a session of the RKP(b) Central Committee Plenum, he is elected a member of the Central Committee Politburo and is approved as a candidate for the RKP(b) delegation to the Comintern. “In the course of the session, Lenin examines the agenda, fills it out with a number of points and makes comments and emphases.... He introduces a draft decree written by him on organizing the work of the Central Committee Secretariat. “The Plenum adopted a decision to institute the position of General Secretary and two Central Committee secre¬ taries. I.V. Stalin was appointed the General Secretary with V.M. Molotov and V.V. Kuybyshev the secretar¬ ies.” I am not saying that all the personnel assignments were taken by open voting at the Central Committee Plenums and there are no data that Lenin or Trotsky himself refrained in approving the new Central Committee Sec¬ retariat. Of course, it must be pointed out that the post of General Secretary was at that time in no way conceived of as the main or even very important post in the party hierarchy. The Secretariat was subordinate both to the Politburo and the Orgburo and the functions of the secretaries were limited. The Secretariat was basically concerned with technical and internal party matters and did not inter¬ vene into the main areas of state administration. The Army, the VChK— GPU [All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counterrevolution and Sab¬ otage and State Political Directorate], the VSNKh [All- Russian Council of the National Economy], and public education were under the control of the Central Com¬ mittee Secretariat. The main people’s commissariats were headed by prominent Central Committee members and their activities were discussed at the Politburo and the Central Committee Plenums. The Secretariat was not concerned with the problems of foreign policy and the Comintern. In April 1922, Lenin was the recognized leader of the revolutionary masses of Russia and stood at the head of the party and the government. For this reason the election of Stalin to the post of General Secretary did not have the character of promot¬ ing a new leader or a successor for Lenin. The situation was changed, however, because of Lenin’s illness and which kept him more and more frequently away from leadership. Stalin was not only the Central Committee General Secretary but was also a member of the Central Committee Orgburo and Politburo and was simultaneously the people’s commissar for nationality affairs and the people’s commissar of the Rabkrin. He had been turned into a key figure in the developing party apparatus the reelections of party committees on the spot were earned out under his supervision and this made it possible for him to implement a mass relocation of cadres in the gubkoms [provincial committees], obkoms and the central committees of the national communist parties. At the head of the most important sections of the RKP(b) Central Committee were Stalin’s supporters of L. Kaganovich, S. Syrtsov and A. Bubnov and the members of the Central Committee Secretariat and Orgburo — V. Molotov, Ya. Rudzutak and A. Andreyev — were also subordinate to Stalin’s influence. Stalin was also actively supported by the Central Com¬ mittee members V. Kuybyshev, S. Ordzhonikidze and A. Mikoyan. I. Tovstukha, L. Mekhlis and G. Malenkov were part of Stalin’s working “staff.” In the meanwhile, Lenin’s illness was progressing and he could not help but think about his successor. He could have had in mind one or another Central Committee member but only not Stalin about whom he began to respond more and more negatively precisely in 1922. Lenin was extremely dissatisfied with the attempt by Stalin, Bukharin and Sokolnikov to weaken the for¬ eign trade monopoly. Lenin also sharply criticized Sta¬ lin’s policy on the nationality question. The problem was that precisely during Lenin’s illness Stalin through the Central Committee commissions carried out his pro¬ posal of “autonomization,” that is, the incorporation of the national republics in the RSFSR on principles of autonomy. According to Stalin’s plans, they would estab¬ lish not the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics but JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 12 rather the Russian Federative Republic which would include all the other nationality formations. Lenin had condemned these preliminary decisions and proposed something else: the creation of a new state — the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics — on the basis of the equality of the RSFSR, the Ukraine, Belorussia and other republics. Precisely this decision was adopted by the party. Stalin did not hold a correct position also on the conflict between Ordzhonikidze and the leadership of the Geor¬ gian CP(b) [Communist Party (Bolshevik)] Central Com¬ mittee on the questions of economic policy of the Tran- scaucasus Kraykom and the rights of the Georgian Soviet Republic. Lenin was greatly alarmed by this conflict and under its impression he dictated at the end of 1 922 his notes “On the Question of Nationalities or ‘Autonomiza- tion’.” In these we read: “That Georgian who is negligent to this aspect of the matter negligently bandies about the accusation of ‘social nationalism’ (while he himself is a real and true not only ‘social national’ but also a coarse great-Russian chauvinist), that Georgian, in essence, violates the inter¬ ests of proletarian class solidarity.... Of course, Stalin and Dzerzhinskiy should be made politically responsible for this entire truly great-Russian nationalistic campaign. In January 1923, Lenin repeatedly returned to an eval¬ uation of this conflict. As can be judged from the notes of his secretaries on duty, Stalin prevented the ailing Lenin from receiving materials requested by him. Stalin so zealously was carrying out the instructions of the Politburo to supervise the conditions for the treat¬ ment of Lenin that he even wanted to remove N.K. Krupskaya from the patient. On 23 December 1922, Krupskaya turned to L.B. Kamenev with a complaint about Stalin’s impoliteness. Lenin learned about this conflict only on 5 March, probably from Kamenev. Indignant to the depth of his soul, although more than 2 months had gone by since the conflict, Lenin summoned a secretary and dictated a note to Stalin with the demand that he apologize to N.K. Krupskaya.” Of course, Stalin immediately, although reticently, apol¬ ogized to Krupskaya and took his words back. He did not dare break with Lenin. On the following day in the morning Lenin dictated one other letter: “To Comrades Mdivani, Makharadze and others. Copy to Comrades Trotsky and Kamenev. “Respected comrades! “I am following your question with all my heart. I am indignant over the coarseness of Ordzhonikidze and the connivances of Stalin and Dzerzhinskiy. I am preparing notes and a speech for you. With respect, Lenin. 6 March 1923.’’'2 The letters of 5 and 6 March 1923 were the last docu¬ ments of Lenin. In the summer and autumn of 1923, Lenin’s health again improved, he began to receive people and walked about, but he never met with Stalin again. At the end of 1922 and in the first half of 1923, as General Secretary, Stalin was concerned with many matters, without forgetting here to strengthen his per¬ sonal positions in the party. He had his own view of party construction and this he set out in a sketch for the pamphlet “On Political Strategy and Tactics of the Russian Communists” written in July 1921 and pub¬ lished for the first time only in 1952. This sketch is of a great deal of importance for understanding both the views and the claims of Stalin. Already the very words “the party is the command personnel and staff of the proletariat” can evoke a number of arguments as the concepts of “vanguard” and “command personnel” are far from identical. But Stalin went even farther: “The Communist Party is a sort of an order of sword bearers within the Soviet state directing the bodies of the latter and inspiring their activities. “The importance of the Old Guard within this mighty order. The replenishment of the Old Guard with new tempered. . .workers. ” The comparison of the Communist Party with the cler¬ ical knightly order “Brotherhood of Christian Army” is no accident. Stalin was impressed by the strictly hierar¬ chical structure of the order of sword bearers. The fact that his note was published only in 1952 indicates that the notion of turning the party into something like a religious order and then setting up within the party and state apparatus some secret elite order, a special caste of “initiates,” never left Stalin. 7 In the broad sense, Lenin’s “Testament” should be understood as all those letters, articles and notes which he dictated at the end of 1 922 and the beginning of 1 923. However, in the narrower sense, Lenin’s “Testament” includes only several letters in which Vladimir Ilich speaks about the work of the Central Committee and provides personal descriptions for certain Central Com¬ mittee members. The basic portion of Lenin’s “Testament,” including the personal characteristics of the Central Committee mem¬ bers, was not promulgated. The next, 12th Party Con¬ gress did not discuss the question of shifting Stalin from the post of General Secretary. The membership of the Central Committee was increased, however among the 17 new members and 13 candidate members of the JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 13 Central Committee, there was not a single peasant or worker as Lenin had insisted. They were all leaders of major soviet and party institutions. Why did they not read the letter from Lenin directed to the congress? Here there was no foul play. The sealed and strictly secret documents could be opened only by Lenin himself and he was paralyzed and unable to speak. N. Krupskaya could open these letters only after Lenin’s death. Thus, a situation developed which had not been envisaged by Vladimir Ilich. Why did Lenin restrict himself to describing only six of the Central Committee members and said nothing about A. Rykov, M. Kalinin and others? I feel that Lenin was perfectly aware that in the event of his death, precisely these six persons would comprise the nucleus of the party leadership and the struggle within it could threaten a split in the party. A particular feature of Lenin’s docu¬ ment was that he pointed out not only the positive qualities of the Central Committee leaders but also their essential shortcomings. In his letter Lenin proposed that Stalin be removed from the post of General Secretary but did not doubt the possibility and necessity of keeping Stalin in the leadership. Hence the use of the word “transfer” and not “remove.” Lenin also did not propose any new candidate for the post of General Secretary. Among the party leaders listed by him, Lenin did not see anyone who could replace him in the post of party and state leader. In endeavoring to allocate all of the main posts more evenly between these persons (and hence the proposal to transfer Stalin), Lenin assumed that only together and under the strong supervision of the Central Committee and the TsKK [Central Control Commis¬ sion] could they further lead the party under the difficult conditions of those times. This is the true sense of Lenin’s document. In his “Testament,” Lenin in fact carefully weighed each word. Here there is not his customary sharpness in assessments. However, with the externally mild phrases, the seemingly innocent expres¬ sions contain a sharp political thought. Lenin said some¬ thing extremely flattering about each of his associates. Stalin is an “outstanding leader of today’s Central Com¬ mittee.” Trotsky is “the most capable person on the current Central Committee.” Bukharin is the most valuable and most important party theorist.” Pyatakov is “a person of undoubtedly outstanding willpower and outstanding abilities.” But at the same time, for each of these, Lenin also provides a political description which is belittling in sense but not in form. Could one really entrust the sole leadership of the party to the impolite, impatient, unloyal and capricious Stalin or to Trotsky who is extremely self-confident and excessively involved with the purely administrative side of things with Lenin considering somewhat accidental Trotsky’s non-Bolshe¬ vism, like the “October episode” of Kamenev and Zinovyev? Of course, one could not entrust leadership of the party to Bukharin whose theoretical views “only with a great deal of doubt could be considered as completely Marxist” or to Pyatakov on whom it is generally difficult to rely in a “serious political question.” Lenin realized the importance of his judgments. He understood that these could help the party hold the political ambitions and desires of its most prominent leaders within definite limits. It was felt that Lenin’s description of the party leaders became known only in May 1 924, when N.K. Krupskaya turned over Lenin’s papers to the Central Committee commission. However recently, one of the leading asso¬ ciates at the Marxism-Leninism Institute Under the CPSU Central Committee, V.P. Naumov, in PRAVDA published a major documented article from which one can see that Lenin’s secretary L. Fotiyeva had informed Stalin and certain other Politburo members about the basic content of Lenin’s notes. On the statement concerning the turning over of Lenin’s documents to the Central Committee commission, N.K. Krupskaya wrote: “Vladimir Ilich expressed the firm desire that these notes of his after his death be made public at the next party congress.” Kamenev, Zinovyev and Stalin, however, resolved not to read Lenin’s letter at the official congress sessions. It was initially read at a meeting of the “elders.” Here Kamenev proposed that no notes be made. Only at this meeting did Trotsky and his supporters on the RKP(b) Central Committee learn about Lenin’s “Testament.” Later, Lenin’s document was read at closed sessions for the individual delegations and no one was to take notes and refer to this document at the congress sessions. In the largest delegations, Zinovyev and Kamenev provided explanations on the question of Lenin’s letter. The information on these closed meetings and Lenin’s letter were not included m the congress minutes. In the forming of the leading party bodies ^fter the congress, Stalin, referring to Lenin’s “Testament,” pre¬ tended to give up the post of General Secretary. But Zinovyev and Kamenev and then a majority of the other Central Committee members persuaded him to take back his retirement. Most probably, before the congress there had been an unique agreement between Zinovyev and Stalin. Stalin approved the promotion of Zinovyev as the main speaker at the 1 3th Congress and thus seemingly promoted this ambitious and unprincipled man to the role of party leader. In turn, Zinovyev and Kamenev were to defend the post of General Secretap' for Stalin at the congress. At that time, Stalin was still unable to act independently of the opinion of other VKP(b) [All-Union Communist Party (Bolshevik)] Cen¬ tral Committee members, and this excluded, seemingly, the possibility of any tyranny. There could be no ques¬ tion of a personal dictatorship of stalin as, on the contrary, Stalin was the herald of “collective leader¬ ship.” He accused Trotsky of a desire for one-man leadership and defended Zinovyev and Kamenev against Trotsky’s attacks. Under the conditions of the fierce struggle against Trotsky and his numerous supporters, the question of Stalin’s coarseness and capriciousness, with Stalin actively working against Trotsky, seemed a JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 14 minor detail to many Central Committee members. They did not see what Lenin had seen. Footnotes 1. V.l. Lenin, PSS [Complete Collected Works], Vol 48, p 162. 2. Ibid., Vol 49, p 101. 3. Ibid., p 161. 4. Ibid., Vol 34, pp 280-282. 5.

He demanded caution and attention to the nationalism of the previously suppressed nations and considered great- power chauvinism as a much greater danger. The Struggle Against the Opposition 1 It is impossible to understand the history of the rise and development of Stalinism without becoming acquainted at least briefly with the history of the internal party struggle in 1923-1930. It must be said that few such questions in our history have been subjected to such outright falsification as the question of the opposition. Even in the publications of the 1920’s, many episodes, facts and the very direction of the occurring struggle were set out in an extremely tendentious manner. Here each of the parties endeavored to show up his opponents in the most unattractive light, various statements were distorted while errors and inaccuracies were exaggerated. Crudeness and a lack of loyalty were not only not thwarted but were encouraged by either side and this from the very outset gave the internal party struggle an extremely sharp nature. In the 1930’s, the leaders of the opposition began to be depicted as traitors and spies of foreign states recruited by imperialist intelligence agents from the very first years of Soviet power. As is known, all the active participants in the opposition movements were later physically exterminated by Stalin. Only a few of the rank-and-file participants of these oppositions returned after the 20th CPSU Congress to their families. Some of them in their memoirs wrote apologetically about the various leaders of the opposi¬ tion. It is possible to understand them but not agree with them. From the fact that Stalin, ending up the winner in the struggle against the opposition, then usurped all power in the nation and in the party, it no way follows that precisely Stalin in his fight against the opposition was completely in the wrong while his opponents were totally correct. It would also be wrong to depict the struggle of the various groupings in the party after Lenin’s death merely as an unprecedented fight for power concealed for appearance’s sake by various sorts of theoretical argu¬ ments. No, in the 1920s, there were serious theoretical and practical differences in the party, and there was an ideological struggle partieularly over the question of the possibilities, ways and methods of building socialism in the Soviet Union. However, it is correct that for Stalin the main thing in this struggle was precisely the question of power. In skillfully maneuvering between all sorts of currents and platforms, Stalin used the struggle of vari¬ ous factions in the party to weaken all his competitors and increase his own power and influence. A characteristic trait of Lenin was the complete absence of any personal motives in the internal party struggle. Completely alien to him was a feeling of vengeance and even insult. For him the main thing was to persuade the party, the workers and, if possible, also his opponents of his correctness. And when agreement was reached in views, any sharpness disappeared in being replaced by benevolence, attention and friendly support. This can be seen from the example of the relations between Lenin and T rotsky in 1912-1913 and 1 9 1 7- 1 9 1 9. Also generally known is the harshness with which Lenin attacked Zinovyev and Kamenev in October 1917 when these members of the Bolshevik Central Committee came out against armed insurrection. But immediately after the victory of the October Revolution, when Zinovyev and Kamenev had admitted their error, they assumed prom¬ inent posts in the Soviet bodies. It would be possible to give many examples of Lenin’s similar attitude toward recent opponents. Thus, in 1921, at the 10th Party Congress, Lenin said that the accom¬ plishments of the “worker opposition” in the struggle JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 15 against bureaucracy had been recognized in the resolu¬ tion on unity, and proposed including its leader, A.G. Shlyapnikov, in the Central Committee membership. “When the Central Committee,” said Lenin, “includes a comrade from the ‘worker opposition,’ this is an expres¬ sion of comradely trust.... This is a manifestation of the higher trust and which cannot be greater in the party.”' “As a special assignment for the Control Commission,” Lenin wrote in October 1920 in a draft Politburo decree, “we must recommend an attentive individualizing atti¬ tude, often even a direct sort of treatment for the representatives of the so-called opposition who have undergone a psychological crisis because of the setbacks in their soviet or party career. We must endeavor to pacify them, to explain things to them in a comradely manner, seek out for them (without any sense of punish¬ ment) work suitable for their psychological features, at this point give them advice and instructions from the Central Committee Orgburo and so forth.”'^ Stalin took a different attitude toward his opponents. Even during the period of the internal party struggle of 1918-1923, he stood out in excessive harshness, crude¬ ness and lack of loyalty. Stalin was little concerned with persuading his opponents and involving them in joint work. He endeavored to subordinate them to his will and break their resistance. Moreover, Stalin was extremely unforgiving and vengeful. For him his opponents remained personal enemies even when the matter of the dispute had disappeared and the need had arisen of joint close work. In truth, Stalin was able to conceal his feelings well. 2 During the first months of 1923, the political and economic situation in the young Soviet Republic was still very difficult. Industry and transport had taken only their first steps, in breaking out of the harsh clutches of chaos. Agriculture was slowly recovering from the con¬ sequences of the two wars and the drought. The material situation of the workers and peasants was extrernely difficult. Particularly tragic was the plight of the millions of orphaned children and juveniles and the millions of unemployed proletarians and white collar personnel. But during this time, NEP [New Economic Policy] was coming into its own. Private trade was developing both in the city and in the countryside, private industrial enterprises, stores, printing plants, restaurants, middle¬ man offices and so forth had begun to appear. Small entrepreneurs, craftsmen, tradesmen and rich peasants had begun to recover from the shock caused by the revolution, by the food requisitioning and by the policy of “war communism.” The development of private entrepreneurship helped to improve the overall eco¬ nomic situation and facilitated the solving of immediate economic problems. But this also created many political complications and difficulties for the party. In January and February 1923, Lenin, already severely ill, continued to dictate his last articles and letters and asked that literature be read to him on international relations, on cooperation and on the scientific organiza¬ tion of labor. Reading with alarm the government announcement on the significant deterioration in Lenin’s health, the party functionaries and activists realized perfectly well that there was no and could not be any replacement for Lenin as the creator and leader of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state. However, as an army during a militai^ campaign needs a new commander, if the previous one is seriously wounded, as the Church needs a new high priest if the former has gone to his Maker, so a political party, particularly under difficult conditions, needs not only a collective of leaders but also a new single leader. Only three persons eould contend for the role of the new party leader: Stalin, Trotsky and Zinovyev who was supported by Kamenev. In truth, Stalin was carefully concealing his claims and kept humbly in the shadow of Zinovyev and Kamenev within the formed triumvirate, or “troyka” of Zinovyev, Kamenev and Stalin. Zinovyev’s claims were based upon his old closeness to Lenin as the leader of the Bolshevik Party. Trotsky’s claims were based on an awareness of his accomplish¬ ments in preparing and conducting the October Armed Insurrection, during the leadership of the Red Army during the years of the Civil War and on his seemingly obvious popularity for all. Foreign observers usually gave preference to precisely Trotsky in their forecasts. However, on the Politburo, Trotsky was alone and he did not have so many supporters in crucial posts in the party apparatus. This greatly weakened his positions and made it impossible to move automatically into the role of party leader. A struggle for power was looming and this strug¬ gle actually began at the start of 1923. On 14 March 1923, PRAVDA published an article by K. Radek titled “Lev Trotsky — Organizer of Victory.” But at the same time, anonymous pamphlets against Trotsky began to be disseminated among the party members and these recalled above all his “non-Bolshevik” past. A. Luna- charskiy was one of the first to begin increasing Zinovyev’s authority. Ye. Yaroslavskiy in a number of publications emphasized Stalin’s important role in the revolution and Civil War. All these literary doings were the external manifestation of that behind-the-scenes struggle which was going on in the party apparatus. At the end of April 1923, the regular 10th Party Congress should have been held. Lenin had been recovering with difficulty from the consequences of the attack and it was obvious that he would be unable to participate in the work of the congress. The question arose of who should give the political report from the RKP(b) Central Com¬ mittee at the congress. Trotsky still remained the most authoritative figure in the Central Committee. For this reason it was quite natural that at a Politburo session, Stalin proposed that Trotsky take over the preparations of this report. Stalin was supported by Kalinin, Rykov JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 16 and even Kamenev. But Trotsky refused, resorting to confused arguments that “the party would not be itself (?), if one of us endeavored to somehow personally replace the ailing Lenin.” He proposed that the party congress be held completely without a political account¬ ability report. This silly proposal was, of course, rejected. At one of the next sessions, the Politburo adopted a decision to assign the preparation of the political report to G. Zinovyev who had just returned from vacation. Trotsky took on the report on industry. In explaining his conduct and position in the first half of 1923, Trotsky later wrote: “Until the very last opportunity I avoided the struggle, since in its first stages it had the nature of an unprece¬ dented conspiracy aimed against me personally. It was clear to me that such a struggle, having once burst out, would inevitably assume exceptional acuteness and under the conditions of a revolutionary dictatorship could lead to threatening consequences.” These arguments are not persuasive for a politician. A struggle for power and influence is not something dis¬ graceful for a professional politician, for this is a part of his life and his profession. In the struggle in the Politburo in the spring of 1 923 and which was unnoticed for the outside observer, Trotsky showed a complete passivity and thereby doomed himself to defeat. This defeat actually opened up new paths and prospects but for.. .the elevation of Stalin who was not only less punctilious but also clearer, smarter and more adroit than it had seemed to Trotsky. The 12th RKP(b) Congress went off relatively calmly. The congress delegates were acquainted with certain of Lenin’s documents, including his letter “On the Ques¬ tion of Nationalities and on ‘Autonomization’” only on a confidential basis. The attempt by B. Mdivani to quote individual points of this letter was stopped by the presiding L.B. Kamenev. The congress, of course, could satisfy Trotsky’s vain glory. The delegates gave him the most extended ovation and in many greetings to the congress, Trotsky’s name was mentioned next to the name of Lenin. However, from the political and organizational viewpoint, the congress strengthened the position of the “troyka” headed by Zinovyev. Stalin was reelected the General Secretary of the RKP(b) Central Committee. The report on industry which was given by Trotsky before the 12th Party Congress was probably the most interesting of all the reports although not indisputable. However, during the first months after the congress, Trotsky spent most of his time involved with questions which were not too pressing. He suddenly published a series of articles on the standards of conduct of a “educated man,” the article “Vodka, the Church and the Cinematographer,” as well as several articles on the Russian language and its degradation in the press. In other words, he demonstrated his erudition in every possible way but nothing more. At the same time, the economic situation in the country had been improving very slowly. The peasants were dissatisfied with the high prices for industrial goods, while the workers complained of low wages and which were not always paid too regularly. In July and August 1923, in many of the major industrial centers (Moscow, Kharkov, Sormovo and elsewhere) there was a wave of worker strikes which greatly disconcerted the party lead¬ ership. It was essential to thoroughly discuss the eco¬ nomic situation and the party’s economic policy. How¬ ever, the lack of internal party democracy and the dominance of the bureaucratic apparatus greatly impeded a broad and profound discussion. The question of democracy, of course, not in its citizen-wide but still in its narrow party significance was in the forefront. F.E. Dzerzhinskiy was one of the first to very decisively pose this question in a number of his speeches. In September 1923, in line with the worker disturbances and the activities of the opposition “Worker Group” which had formed in the party and trade unions and was headed by G.I. Myasnikov, the RKP(b) Central Com¬ mittee Plenum was convened. In his speech at this Plenum, Dzerzhinskiy pointed to the stagnation in inter¬ nal party life. He also said that the replacing of the elective principal by the “appointing” of party secretar¬ ies was becoming a politically dangerous and paralyzing the party. The Central Committee Plenum established a commission headed by Dzerzhinskiy to examine the situation within the party. Trotsky and his supporter Ye. Preobrazhenskiy refused to become a member of Dzerzhinskiy’s commission. By the autumn of 1923, several still semilegal opposition groups basically favoring leftist viewpoints had formed in the party, including in its leading circles. There was an intensive exchange of opinions between these groups and a single platform was worked out. The only thing missing was an authoritative leader. Trotsky was to become the leader of the forming leftist opposition. He finally aban¬ doned his months-long hesitations and decided to head an opposition against Stalin and the entire “troyka.” Undoubtedly, Trotsky’s decision was influenced not only by the pressure of many of his friends and support¬ ers. Trotsky was certain that he was gradually being squeezed out of power. Even in the military commissar¬ iat where he considered himself the complete master, his positions had been weakened. The membership of the Republic RVS and the Defense Council now included two old opponents of Trotsky, K.Ye. Voroshilov and M.M. Lashevich, upon the decision of the Politburo. On 8 October 1 923, T rotsky sent a letter to the members of the Central Committee and the TsKK with a harsh criticism of the party leadership. A majority of Trotsky’s comments on the bureaucratization of the party appara¬ tus and the curtailing of party democracy was completely JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 17 valid. However, the letter contained a number of exag¬ gerations, if one bears in mind the situation in 1 923. “That regime,” wrote Trotsky, “which basically had come into being prior to the 12th Congress and after it gained its complete reinforcement and shaping is much farther from worker democracy than the regime of the harshest periods of war communism.” Trotsky’s letter contained numerous hints of the need for changes in the party leadership. Nevertheless he stated that he aimed merely at changing the erroneous policy and not “attacking” the existing leadership. He also emphasized that he considered this letter an internal document of the Central Committee and the TsKK and did not propose to set out his views before the entire party. The letter, however, became known in copies to many of Trotsky’s supporters and was published in 1924 by the Menshevik emigree newspaper SOTSIALIS- TICHESKIY VESTNIK. Even sharper comments were to be found in the “Statement” received by the RKP(b) Central Committee on 1 5 October and which was signed by 46 prominent party members. Undoubtedly, Trotsky had been acquainted ahead of time with its content. “The regime established in the party,” stated this State¬ ment, “is completely intolerable. It has killed party independence, replacing the party by a hand-picked official apparatus which operates without problem in normal times but which inevitably produces hitches at moments of crisis and threatens to become completely unworkable when confronted by the approaching serious events.” The activities of the RKP(b) Central Committee were criticized just as sharply in the economic area and it was asserted that precisely because of incompetence, unsys¬ tematicness and the arbitrariness of the Central Com¬ mittee decisions, instead of successes and accomplish¬ ments the economy had arrived at a major crisis. This “Statement” also was not published but was dissemi¬ nated to party members in many party organizations. The fact that precisely Trotsky was at the center of the struggle for party democracy might seem even more strange to many party activists than the concern for internal party democracy shown by the head of the VChK and OGPU [United State Political Administra¬ tion], Dzerzhinskiy. Trotsky had never been known in party and state circles as a democrat, and his work methods, for example, in the army and in transportation had been marked by extreme authoritarianism. It was precisely Trotsky who recently had insisted upon the militarizing of labor at the enterprises and the “shaking up” of the trade unions and their complete subordina¬ tion to the state. Combined with this authoritarianism was Trotsky’s extreme individualism and conceit and this provided grounds for even his closest associates to call him a “lord.” In one way or another it was finally Trotsky who headed the leftist opposition in the party and this subsequently determined both many of its successes and setbacks. Trotsky’s letter to the Central Committee and the “Statement of 46” were documents which the party leadership could not overlook. On 25-27 October 1923, in Moscow, a joint Plenum of the Central Committee and the TsKK was convened together with representa¬ tives from ten party organizations. The Plenum con¬ demned these documents as a step toward the splitting of the party and as an example of fractional activity. However, the Plenum’s resolution was published only several months later. The party leadership realized that it was now impossible to avoid a new major discussion. But it did not want to base the discussion on Trotsky’s letter of the “Statement of 46.” The Politburo was endeavoring to take the initiative of the discussion in its own hands. On 7 November 1923, PRAVDA published a major article by G. Zinovyev “New Tasks of the Party and which was restrained in its critical and self-critical spirit. Zinovyev, in particular, asserted that “in intra¬ party life recently one can note an excessive calm, and in places even outright stagnation.... Our main misfortune is often that all the most important questions for us are predetermined from the top downward. This restricts the creativity of the entire mass of party members and reduces the independence of the low-level party cells....” PRAVDA urged the party members to initiate an exten¬ sive debate about Zinovyev’s article both in the press and in the party organizations. From 13 November PRAVDA began to regularly print as a point of depar¬ ture for debate diverse materials and articles on the problems of internal party democracy. This debate evoked enormous interest in the party. Articles were published both by the supporters and opponents of Trotsky. However, in many ways these articles did not differ excessively. Both sides recognized the abnormality of the situation existing in the party and urged an all-out development of internal party democracy. Here a num¬ ber of intelligent proposals and considerations was voiced and many of these have not lost their pertinence even now. As a whole, the debate was of a constructive nature and this opened up the possibility of a compro¬ mise. And, such a compromise was reached. On 5 December 1 923, a joint session was held of the Central Committee Politburo and the TsKK Presidium. Here after protracted and difficult disputes, a resolution was approved unanimously and this was published by PRAVDA on 7 December. The resolution stated; “Only a constant, alive ideological life can keep the party as it has developed before and during the revolution, with a constant critical study of its past, with the rectification of its errors and collective discussion of major questions. Only these work methods are capable of providing effective guarantees against the turning of the sporadic differences of opinion into fractional group¬ ings. For preventing this, it is essential that the leading party bodies heed the voice of the broad party masses. i JPRS-UPA-89-042 5 July 1989 18 that they do not consider any criticism as a manifesta¬ tion of factionalism and do not thereby impel conscien¬ tious and disciplined party members into a path of exclusiveness and factionalism.... It is essential to broaden the network of party debating clubs, not to resort to incorrect references to ’’party discipline,\" when it is a question of the rights and duties of party members to discuss questions of interest to them and to submit decisions....” Voting in favor of the resolution, among others, were Trotsky, Stalin, Zinovyev and Kamenev. But the una¬ nimity was not too strong. For Stalin and Zinovyev, the resolution of 5 December was a certain concession to pressure from the opposition. In any event, they did have to recognize the presence of essential elements of bureau¬ cracy in the party apparatus and even urge the par"
