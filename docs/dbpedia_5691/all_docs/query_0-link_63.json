        "text": "Waking up this morning and turning on Twitter I am usually looking for something good to get my day going. However, today was not the case…not at all.\n\nThe Russian Kontinental Hockey League team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl’s plane was taking off in route to their opening game when, due to reasons that I am sure will be uncovered, the plane did not get high enough off the ground and crashed. The entire team basically gone in an instant.\n\nMany players and personnel from the hockey world are flooding Twitter and the news wires with this information and condolences to the families of all of those involved. But really, what is there to say? As many have said, everyone is just in shock. No one knows how to react to such a tragedy.\n\nThe hockey world has endured the worst offseason in its history. With the passings of Derek Boogaard, Rick Rypien, and Wade Belak this summer, this tragedy just adds to the pile of terrible tragedies. Knowing just how connected the hockey world is internally just about everyone has been affected personally by all of these tragedies. And while getting back on the ice as quickly as possible is something everyone wants, no one is ever going to forget how tragic this summer was.\n\nFor the Rangers many have been touched personally by this tragedy. As Steve Zipay has reported from Artem Anisimov, “I knew half the team. I didn’t believe it at first…then I felt sick.”Anisimov played in the Lokomotiv system before coming to North America and the NHL.\n\nRangers forward Marian Gaborik has lost two of his best friends this summer which is an unimaginable loss to anyone. The loss of one friend is tough enough but something like this just compounds it. Pavol Demitra was known as one of Gaborik’s best friends.\n\nRangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist was a teammate of Stefan Liv’s during the 2006 Swedish Gold Medal run at the Olympics and had become close friends since then.\n\nOnly two from the plane itself are still alive including Alexander Galimov who has supposedly suffered burns to 80% of his body. The kid is still fighting and hopefully he pulls through. The other is a crew member who is fighting to stay alive as well.\n\nBut the damage has been done and many have been lost. I still can’t believe it and its been about a few hours. There is really nothing else to say.\n\nHere is a list of the confirmed dead. Not everyone has been accounted for as of right now though (courtesy of Sovietsky Sport in Russia):\n\n1.Anikeenko Vitaly\n\n2.Bahvalov Yuri\n\n3.Belyaev Alexander\n\n4.Balandin Mikhail\n\n5.Vasyunov Alexander\n\n6.Vashichek Joseph\n\n7.Vyuhin Alexander E.\n\n8.Ditrih Robert Genrikhovich\n\n9. Pavol Demitra\n\n10.Zimin Andrey\n\n11.Kalimulin Marat Natfullovich\n\n12.Karpovtsev Alexander G.\n\n13.Kalyanin Alexander I.\n\n14.Kiryuhin Andrey\n\n15.Klyukin Nikita\n\n16.Korolev Igor Borisovich\n\n17.Krivonosov Nikolai\n\n18.Kunnov Evgeny\n\n19.Kuznetsov Vyacheslav Mikhailovich\n\n20.Liv Stephen Daniel Patrick\n\nJan 21.Marek\n\n22.MakKrimmon Brad Byron\n\n23.Ostapchuk Sergey I.\n\n24.Piskunov Vladimir Leonidovich\n\n25.Rahunek Karel\n\n26.Sidorov Evgeny\n\n27.Skrastinsh Karlis Martinovic\n\n28.Snurnitsyn Pavel\n\n29.Daniel E. Sobchenko\n\n30.Tkachenko Ivan Leonidovich\n\n31.Trahanov Pavel\n\n32.Yuri O.Urychev\n\n33.Churilov Gennady S.\n\n34.Shuvalov Maxim A.\n\n35.Yarchuk Artem Nikolaevich\n\n36. Ruslan Salei\n\nCrew:\n\n36.Solomentsev Andrey, Commander\n\n37.Zhivelov Igor Konstantinovich, second pilot\n\n38.Zhuravlev Sergey, bortmehanih\n\n39.Sarmatova Elena, flight attendant\n\n40.Maksumova Hope Murzafarovna, flight attendant\n\n41.Shavina Elena, flight attendant\n\n42.Matyushin Vladimir Yurevich, flight engineer\n\nCondolences to the friends and families of all of these people. It doesn’t get worse than this folks. If anything the hockey community will have to get together once again and offer support and comfort because everyone knows they need it."
