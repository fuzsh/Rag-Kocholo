        "text": "Jean Francois Jomphe\n\nJF Jomphe was born on December 28th, 1972 in Havre Saint-Pierre, Quebec. He would move on to play his youth hockey in Rosemère and Granby before jumping to Shawinigan of the QMJHL.\n\n\"I had tons of fun in Shawinigan,\" Jomphe told interviewer Frederic Lavallee. \"In my second season there, we made it far in the playoffs. In my third year, I was traded to Sherbrooke. They were the best team in the League, but we lost in the Finals against a Laval team with the likes of Martin Lapointe, Philippe Boucher and Manny Fernandez in their roster.\"\n\nDespite his play in the QMJHL, Jomphe was never drafted by a NHL team.\n\n\"I was not really worried,\" he continued with Lavallee. \"In 1992, the Pittsburgh Penguins offered me an invitation to go to their training camp and try to sign me to an ECHL contract, but I went back to Shawinigan. In 1993, five teams gave me a try, including the Quebec Nordiques who offered me $33,000 in the minors or $235,000 in the NHL for three full years!\"\n\nJomphe opted to sign with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, one of two expansion franchises. He hoped that would give him his best shot at making it to the NHL.\n\nIt did not work out quite like Jomphe had hoped. He struggled in the minor leagues for the first two seasons, and then joined the Canadian national team program for the 1994-95 season.\n\n\"The Ducks organization thought it would be better for my development to play with Team Canada during the lock-out shortened season (1994-95) and I got to learn to play a more defensive game under Pierre Page,\" he told Lavallee.\n\nIt was one of his favorite seasons in hockey.\n\n\"I traveled around the world. I didn’t have the chance to play for Team Canada before, and to wear this jersey was very special for me. I grew up a lot that season!\"\n\nJomphe returned to the minor leagues as a different player. He was having an excellent season in Baltimore, scoring 55 points in 47 games. It was his ticket to the NHL, playing 31 games in Anaheim, scoring twice and adding 12 assists.\"\n\nThe 1996-97 season will be Jomphe’s only complete one in the NHL. He played 64 games with Anaheim, scoring 7 goals and 21 points. But an abdomen injury prevented Jomphe from completing the season and participating in the playoffs.\n\nDespite being reunited with coach Pierre Page in 1997-98, Jomphe was demoted to the minor leagues after just nine games. A knee injury prevented any chance of returning.\n\nIn June of 1998 Jomphe was traded to Phoenix for Jim McKenzie. He would only play one game in Phoenix. He was farmed out but later would be acquired by the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nPlaying for Montreal was a dream come true, albeit a brief one. He would only play in six games for the Habs.\n\n\"The Canadiens treated me very well. Seeing the Habs dressing room at the Molson Centre ( became the Bell Center in 2002 ) was impressive. On April 7th, we were playing Boston in Montreal. My parents were celebrating their 30th year of marriage and I wore number 30. During the game, a message appeared on the scoreboard, telling the crowd about my parents anniversary.\"\n\nJomphe would extend his career for four years, playing in Germany and Switzerland.\n\n\"Playing in Switzerland was great. We had cars for our families, an apartment, a good salary. Fans are great there and the ambiance during games is a fun experience as a player. We won the championship in my first season there, but I injured my knee. After my second season with Biel, the doctors advice was to stop playing, and so I retired, this time for good, to be able to walk after my hockey career!\"\n\nDisappointment Lingers\n\nIn talking with a number of Vancouver Canucks fans of late, I definitely get the feeling that 2011-12 season promises to be a very different season. Not necessarily for the team, but more-so for the fans.\n\nPrior to the playoffs, and especially prior to last season's Stanley Cup final, I had a definite suspicion that the 2011 playoffs would change me somehow. I had no real idea how at the time. But I guess part of me knew I had to take a break from hockey, at least for some period of time.\n\nI was really hoping the 2011 playoffs would be the culmination of my fandom. I was truly cemented as a Canucks fan forever following their terrific 1994 Stanley Cup final run. Even though that team, too, lost in game 7, I would never go back and change a thing. However, I was really hoping the 2011 team would complete the saga, finally winning the Stanley Cup and ending the story. That would allow me to move on with a great deal of satisfaction.\n\nOf course, the 2011 team did not win. Despite being a superior team to that of 1994, these Canucks, felled by injuries, questionable refereeing and Boston's penalty kill, also lost the Stanley Cup in game 7. But this time, despite an incredible season, the only lasting feeling is that of disappointment.\n\nEven had the Canucks actually won that damn Stanley Cup, the lasting feeling would have been relief, not joy. I guess that has left me feeling so disillusioned. The 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs were not fun for me. With each victory I rarely felt the joy and anticipation that I felt I should have. I wanted my team to win so that I could feel relief, not euphoria. That is not how it is supposed to be.\n\nThe 2011 Stanley Cup changed me as a fan. All summer I rarely worked on hockey projects, which I had always done in the past. I turned away jobs. I skipped the draft and free agency. I read the headlines regularly, but rarely got too involved in most stories. I pursued other things in life - like family time, vacationing, camping and my other serious passion - hiking.\n\nEven though the summer was a short one for Canucks fans, I remain in no hurry for a return to the ice. I needed time away. It makes me wonder how the players deal with such issues, and the long term effects on them and the team.\n\nIt still remains to be seen how the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs has changed me long term. I suspect I will take the upcoming season a little less seriously than I usually do, at least in the beginning. Maybe I will not watch every game. Maybe I can find something else to do on game night.\n\nCanada Cup '87 - The Greatest Hockey Ever Played\n\nThere is little doubt that the 1972 Summit Series between Canada and the Soviet Union is the single greatest hockey tournament, perhaps sporting event, ever. Due to the political and cultural differences, and the dramatic ending, it is unforeseeable that anything could rival 1972. However the 1987 Canada Cup did rival it. While the Cold War was thawing, the drama was almost equal to 1972. And unlike 1972, the tournament was filled with great play on the ice. In fact most will agree that the 1987 Canada Cup highlighted perhaps the greatest hockey ever played.\n\n\"I don't think you'll ever see better hockey than what was played in that series,\" said Wayne Gretzky. \"For me, it was probably the best hockey I've ever played.\"\n\nThe 1987 Cup not only had the greatest player of all time in his prime, but many others as well. Grant Fuhr, Paul Coffey, Viacheslav Fetisov, Vladimir Krutov, Sergei Makarov also were at the highest points of their incredible careers. The series also saw the rise to prominence of a young Dominik Hasek, as well as the elevation of Mario Lemieux to Gretzky's stratosphere.\n\nThe round robin went pretty much as expected. Canada and the Soviets finished 1-2 with Sweden and CSSR narrowly edging out the Americans for the final playoff spots. The Soviets handed Sweden a 4-2 loss and Canada downed the Czechs 5-3 to set up the greatest showdown in history.\n\nThe best of three series went the distance and thrilled fans world wide. All three games ended with the same score, 6-5, which was the identical score of the final game of the eight-game 1972 Summit Series, which saw Paul Henderson win the game for Canada with just 34 seconds left.\n\n1987 was the longest series since 1972 between the two nations. The three games dripped with intrigue and drama. The Soviets shocked the Canadians with a 6-5 overtime win in game one in Montreal.\n\nIn the second game in Hamilton, Ontario, the Canadians assumed a 3-1 lead but watched it vanish. The game went into overtime which required a Mario Lemieux tally in the second over time period to force a third and deciding game. Some have called that second game the best game ever played.\n\nIn the third game, which was also played in Hamilton, the Canadians fell behind early 3-0 and 4-2. But, by using grit, determination and skill, they rallied in the second period to take a 5-4 lead, which the Soviets would erase in the third period, setting up the last minute heroics.\n\nLate in the third period, Dale Hawerchuk was out to take an important faceoff in his own zone. Hawerchuk won the draw from Valeri Kamensky and tied up the Soviet center. Mario Lemieux got the puck and pushed it ahead to Wayne Gretzky at the blueline. Breaking across center ice with Lemieux and Larry Murphy trailing, Gretzky swooped in on Igor Kravchuk, and goaltender Sergei Mylnikov.\n\nGretzky, who led all tournament scorers, fed a perfect pass back to Lemieux, who led all tournament snipers, at the top of the faceoff circle. \"I had lots of time,\" said Lemieux, \"more than a second. The top shelf was open and I just put it there.\" For the next minute and 26 seconds, Team Canada would kill time by defending their zone, knowing they were seconds away from being crowned winners of the greatest series in hockey history.\n\n\"There is a generation of hockey fans who have grown up not having seen the 1972 Summit Series,\" said tournament head Alan Eagleson. \"But the 1987 tournament bridged that generation gap. It was that good. To a new generation it will be their 1972 series.\"\n\nRemembering Ace Bailey and Mark Bavis\n\nCheck out this photo of a teenage Wayne Gretzky:\n\nGretzky and Bailey held a special relationship. The veteran Bailey was a bit of a cross between a big brother and a father figure for the teenage phenom. As you will read below, he once saved the rookie's butt from the wrath of their coach.\n\nOutside of that special relationship, Bailey was likely destined to be a forgotten footnote in the history of hockey. He was a run of the mill role player with the Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings and Washington Capitals back in the 1970s. He moved on to become a long time scout.\n\nThen the unthinkable happened on September 11, 2001. Terrorists hijacked commercial airplanes and inconceivably crashed them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The most dramatic footage was of United Airlines Flight 175. Caught on several amateur and professional cameras, the plane zoomed in on the second of the WTC Twin Towers, resulting in a fiery collision followed by shortly by the horrific collapse of the 110 story structure.\n\nSuch sickening events puts things such as the insignificance of such things as hockey in proper prospective. But the hockey world quickly learned that two of there own were among the victims on that particular flight. Los Angeles Kings scouts Mark Bavis and Garnet \"Ace\" Bailey were leaving Boston to attend the Kings training camp. They never made it.\n\nBavis was a former minor leaguer and Boston University alumni, but was largely unknown in the hockey community. Quietly he was an up and comer in the scouting ranks and had a promising future in the game off the ice.\n\nBailey was a well known hockeyist, both in the internal community and among the fans and media - and not just because he shared the same name as the old Hall of Famer.\n\nBailey was a wonderful man to be around. He was a popular teammate when he played, and popular in retirement. He had an infectious love of life and of hockey, and it was well received by players, media and fans.\n\nGarnet Bailey, who inherited the nickname Ace from unrelated hockey Hall of Famer Irvine \"Ace\" Bailey, was best known as a nice utility player who specialized as a defensive left winger. He also specialized in intangibles, both on and off the ice.\n\nBorn in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, Bailey was a junior hockey star with the Edmonton Oil Kings from 1965 through 1967. He was drafted by the Boston Bruins 13th overall in the limited 1966 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nBailey spent the next two years apprenticing in the minors as the Bruins were quickly becoming a powerhouse, and a spot on the roster was not easy to acquire. However by 1969-70 Bailey found his niche as a defensive role player. It was good timing as the Bruins were on their way to the Stanley Cup championship, although Bailey did not play in the playoffs because of a broken ankle.\n\nInjuries plagued Bailey for the 1970-71 season but he returned to full time duty in 1971-72, and again helped the Bruins win the Stanley Cup. This time Bailey played in 13 post season games and contributed 6 points.\n\nThe Bruins traded Bailey late in the 1972-73 season to Detroit, and Detroit traded Bailey midway into the 1973-74 season to St. Louis. Despite getting off to his best start in his NHL career ( 41 points in the first 49 games easily eclipsed all of his career highs with 1/3rd of the season left to go) Bailey's stay with the Blues was again short as he was traded part way through the 1974-75 season to the awful Washington Capitals.\n\nWhile the 1970s Capitals were perhaps one of the worst teams in hockey history, it was a good fit for Bailey, who got to play a lot more than he did with Boston.\n\nThe fact that the Capitals General Manager at the time was Milt Schmidt, the former Boston Bruin legend who Bailey had worked with before during the two Stanley Cup championships in the early 1970s.\n\n\"Ace is the kind of player you need when you're building a team,\" Schmidt said. \"He's a good checker, a hard working digger and he can play center or the wing, whichever you want.\"\n\nBailey played with the Capitals until 1978 when he signed on with the Edmonton Oilers with the WHA. He played just 38 games in Edmonton, but has some good stories to tell.\n\nAn interesting story about Bailey occurred in the WHA where the likable veteran made a great impression on a young Wayne Gretzky.\n\nThe two were roommates and on one occasion overslept their pre-game nap. They woke up with just minutes before game time.\n\nGretzky, just a rookie, was in a natural panic, but the wily veteran Bailey seemed not too worried. He helped Gretzky get going and told him to go ahead and not worry about me.\n\nGretzky frantically made his way to the rink and got there just in time for the pre-game warm-up. The team skated for approximately 45 minutes, yet Bailey never showed up, much to Gretzky's dismay.\n\nWhen the team left the ice, Gretzky walked back into the dressing room and was shocked to see Bailey sitting in his stall - fully equipped and sweating like he was out on the ice with the rest of them.\n\nGretz whispered into his ear \"Ace, I didn't see you on the ice. Where were you?\"\n\nEven quieter, Bailey whispered back \"I didn't get here until 5 minutes ago. So I put on my equipment and went into the shower and got all wet. They never even missed me!\"\n\nGretzky has lots of stories about Bailey, who still a very good friend of his.\n\nLike the time Bailey had rented a house in Edmonton without seeing it. After a few drinks with the guys,\n\nBailey and some others went to see the house, although they were all half inebriated. The key just wouldn't work. Bailey was using all his might to pry the garage door open while Cowboy Flett was on the roof trying to get in through a skylight. Next thing you know the cops showed up. It turned out to be the wrong house! Its pretty funny, but the elderly couple inside probably weren't amused.\n\nBailey certainly had his effect on a young Gretzky off the ice, but also served as an on ice protector as well. He was always the first player to step in if the teenage sensation was being abused. Ace wasn't a heavyweight by any means, but he always showed up.\n\nBailey played for brief stints in the Central Hockey League up until 1981 when he retired for good. All in all he had 107 goals, 171 assists and 278 points in 568 NHL games. He was a useful player and a great dressing room guy. He was real free spirit which probably angered his coaches at times.\n\nNo coach would admit to that now though. They, like anyone whoever had the immense pleasure of even a short visit with the jovial Ace, have dozens of great stories. It is those memories which we must remember and cherish.\n\n\"Ace was one of the most popular guys in the NHL, and he was a friend to all of us,\" former teammate Kevin Lowe said. \"You will be hard-pressed to find anyone who hasn't been touched by his incredible personality, and words simply can't express how we feel right now.\"\n\n\"Ace may not have been the greatest hockey player to play in the NHL but he taught many players how to win championships and more importantly, he was a winner as a person. We will all miss him greatly,\" said Gretzky\n\nGarnet \"Ace\" Bailey died horrifically, as did 1000s of other innocent people. He is survived by his wife Kathy and a grown son. It is important the we do not forget Ace, the other victims, or the incidents themselves. We must not let their deaths go for not, we must reach for world peace."
