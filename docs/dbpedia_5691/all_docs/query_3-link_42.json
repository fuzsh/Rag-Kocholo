        "text": "In the 1940s, Torino was the grandeur of Italian football. Best of that confirmation - three championship titles\"Squadra pomegranate\" from 1946 to 1948. On May 4, 1949, on a three-engine Fiat plane, the Torino footballers were returning from the away match against Portuguese Benfica to Turin. The plane made a stopover in Barcelona for refueling, during which the Torino players talked to the Milan players who were taking a flight to Madrid. The Rossoneri were the last to select the Turin people alive.\n\nCloser to five in the evening, when only a few kilometers remained to Turin, the airliner entered a dense strip of fog. The pilot lost his orientation, the plane descended and with his left wing touched the fence of the Superga Basilica located on the hill. The car turned around, and it crashed into the ground at high speed. The crash killed all 18 players on board, including Italy's captain Valentino Mazzola. Fate favored only one Torino player - Lauro Toma. Due to injury, he was forced to stay at home. By the way, \"Torino\" with its youth squad retained the first line of the tournament table.\n\n\"Manchester United\". February 6, 1958\n\nOn that fateful day, British European Airways' charter flight BE609 from Belgrade to Manchester stopped in Munich for refueling. On board were 21 representatives of the English football club \"Manchester United\", returning home after the return quarterfinal match of the Cup European champions from Belgrade \"Crvena Zvezda\".\n\nThe pilots made two attempts to take off, but both times they stopped due to engine problems. However, not wanting to be behind schedule, they decided to try again. Could not stop them and started snowfall. Irish striker Liam Whelan reacted to the pilots' zeal like this: \"It may be death, but I'm ready for it.\"\n\nThe pilots desperately tried to get the plane off the ground, but it, having driven its wheels into the snow, continued to rush along the runway. At a speed of almost 200 km / h, the plane rammed the fence and crashed into a private house.\n\nResidents by a lucky chance were not injured, and of the 44 people on board the plane, 23 were killed and another 19 were injured. Manchester United have lost eight players (including Liam Whelan) and three coaching staff in the crash. Among the survivors was Bobby Charlton, a future star English football, - at the time of the accident, he was thrown out of the passenger compartment along with the seat.\n\nThe Strongest. September 26, 1969\n\nOn the evening of Friday 26 September 1969, the Strongest of Bolivia was returning by plane to La Paz after a friendly game. It was the best period in the history of one of the oldest football clubs Bolivia.\n\nAfter a few hours of flight, the Douglas crew stopped communicating. At this time, a snow front fell on the Andes, and dispatchers rushed to declare an emergency. Only a day later, in the very heart of the Andes, not far from the village of Viloko on the slope of Mount Choquetanga, a group of miners discovered the wreckage of an aircraft, and a day later a search team arrived there.\n\nIt was not possible to establish the cause of the disaster. But it is worth noting that the tragedy happened on the day the military coup took place in the country. All 74 people on board were killed, 19 of them were players and coaches of the Strongest club. Five years later, the renewed Strongest won the Bolivian championship again.\n\n\"Pakhtakor\". August 11, 1979\n\nOne of the worst disasters in the history of Soviet aviation occurred in the skies over the Ukrainian Dneprodzerzhinsk on August 11, 1979. On that day, through the fault of the air traffic controllers (however, the version of the hit by a training missile is also tenacious), two Tu-134 passenger aircraft of the Aeroflot company collided. One of the planes was flying Voronezh - Chisinau, the other - Tashkent - Minsk. In the latter, the football team “Pakhtakor”, popular in the USSR, flew for the next match of the national championship with Minsk “Dynamo”.\n\nNone of the 178 people on both airliners survived. If the board, heading to Chisinau, immediately collapsed in the air, then the plane flying to Minsk, having lost the tail, part of the right wing and one of the engines still tried to make an emergency landing, but at an altitude of 4 kilometers entered a steep dive and crashed to the ground. There were 14 players and three representatives of the coaching staff of the Tashkent Pakhtakor in it.\n\nThe Yak-42 plane with the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey team on board crashed a few kilometers from Yaroslavl a few minutes after takeoff, barely managing to rise to an altitude of about 10 meters.\n\nAccording to representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, during the crash, the Yak-42 broke into two parts: the bow collapsed in the Toksha stream, and the tail remained on land. The liner flew to the capital of Belarus - Minsk. The plane disappeared from the radar screens at 15.50, almost immediately after takeoff.\n\nP.S. The post is updated regularly!\n\n(13 photos + 3 videos)\n\nThe Yak-42D aircraft, registration number RA-42434, made its maiden flight on October 1, 1993. It was operated by the following companies: Orel-avia (93-97g), Bykovo-avia (97-2005), Aero-rent (2005-2009) and Yak-Service 2009 - 2011. manufacturer - Saratov Aviation Plant (SAZ), serial number: 4520424305017.\n\n1. The aircraft was assigned a resource: 15,000 flight hours (used by 42%), 7,000 landings (used by 43%). The airworthiness period is 18 years (until October 1, 2011) (100%). Accordingly, after October, the aircraft had to extend its service life, which means that it should be sent for repairs. The plane did not even fly half of its resource, therefore it had to be in good technical condition. The aircraft was approved for international flights (international airlines) and equipped with all modern systems BRNAV, TCAS, GPWS, RVSM.\n\n2. Two people survived the crash of the Yak-42 near Yaroslavl, a representative of the information department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation told RIA Novosti.\n\n“In the crash, according to the specified data, two people survived,” said the agency's interlocutor. According to a source in the security forces, the pilot and one of the hockey players of the Yaroslavl Lokomotiv survived. There were 45 people on board in total.\n\n3. The forward of the Russian national ice hockey team, 26-year-old Alexander Galimov, was taken to the intensive care unit of the Yaroslavl city hospital with burns and fractures. Alexander Galimov has been playing for Lokomotiv in the Super League since 2004, and then in the KHL: silver medalist in 2008 and 2009, bronze medalist in 2005 and 2011.\n\n4. Athletes from Germany, Latvia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Belarus and Sweden played for the hockey club Lokomotiv. The team was coached by a Canadian citizen, Brad McCrimmon.\n\n5. Embassies and confirm the death of their hockey players who were part of the Lokomotiv club. According to Interfax, the deaths of the captain of the Slovak national ice hockey team Pavol Demitra and three Czech players - Josef Vasicek, Jan Marek and Karel Rachunek - have been confirmed.\n\nPavol Demitra has been called an icon of Slovak ice hockey. “Everyone knows him, he was almost like a hero ... For us, this is a huge tragedy,” said Rastislav Moito, third secretary of the Slovak Embassy.\n\n6. The site is temporarily closed hockey club\"Locomotive\"\n\nOn the main page of the site there is an inscription: “Dear users! The site is temporarily shutting down due to an emergency. \"\n\n7. The list of those killed in the Yak-42 plane crash near Yaroslavl has been published. As of 20.00 Moscow time, rescuers removed 36 bodies from the wreckage of the liner. According to Life News, the updated list of victims includes:\n\nSolomentsev Andrey Anatolyevich, commander\n\nZhivelov Igor Konstantinovich, 2nd pilot\n\nZhuravlev Sergey Vasilievich, flight mechanic\n\nElena A.

President of the FHR Vladislav Tretyak expressed condolences to the families and friends of those killed in the plane crash near Yaroslavl, in which the Yak-42 crashed with the hockey players of the Yaroslavl Lokomotiv on board.\n\n9. “We express our condolences to both the families of the victims and the club. In the hockey world of Russia, this is a very strong loss, because a lot of strong hockey players played in Yaroslavl. We will do our best to understand the causes of the tragedy, and, of course, we will support families so that hockey Yaroslavl does not die, ”Tretyak said.\n\nYou will remain in our memory forever. Rest in peace 🙁\n\nFive years ago, on September 7, 2011, hockey Lokomotiv crashed. The official results of the investigation into the plane crash that killed 44 people were announced in October 2014. Vadim Timofeev, Deputy Director General of Yak-Service Airlines, was found guilty. Immediately after the verdict was announced, he was amnestied. The relatives of the victims believe that the true cause of the tragedy has not yet been established.\n\nThe pilot hit the brakes\n\nThe investigation lasted about a year. According to the conclusions of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), the aircraft commander or the co-pilot unknowingly pressed the brake pedals during the takeoff run, and the speed at the final stage of takeoff was lower than required.\n\nList of representatives of HC Lokomotiv who died in the plane crash\n\n1.

Kuznetsov Vyacheslav Mikhailovich (masseur)\n\n37. Piskunov Vladimir Leonidovich (administrator)\n\nSerious shortcomings in the retraining of crew members on the Yak-42 aircraft were indicated as concomitant reasons (in the emergency flight, there was a negative transfer of control skills of the Yak-40 to the Yak-42 on takeoff, expressed in the wrong position of the feet on the pedals during the takeoff run); lack of control by the airline over the level of crew training; errors and non-fulfillment of technological procedures made by the crew during the preparation and calculation of take-off parameters, as well as during the takeoff run; uncoordinated, uncoordinated actions of the crew in the final phase of the takeoff run.\n\nIn addition, phenobarbital, a sedative that is essentially a sleeping pill, was found in the blood of one of the pilots. Flights under the influence of this drug, as well as in the presence of diseases in the co-pilot (problems with the sensitivity of the legs), noted based on the analysis of medical records, is prohibited by Russian aviation legislation.\n\nThe only defendant in the case was Vadim Timofeev, who was the responsible person who controlled the crew's access to the flight. In particular, he was responsible for organizing flight work, maintaining the qualifications of flight personnel, improving their professional level, conducting training and testing of pilots.\n\nHaving studied all the circumstances and facts that preceded the tragedy, the investigators established that it was Timofeev who allowed the crew to fly, which had no right to do so, since he had not completed retraining to operate the Yak-42 ship. In addition, the admission of the ship's captain was issued on the basis of falsified documents.\n\nThe accused had previously violated safety rules - he did not control the passage of professional training for the pilots, regularly withdrew them from training events and, despite the unfinished program, illegally allowed them to fly.\n\nDuring the investigation, it turned out that the commander, who died in the plane crash, made serious mistakes during other flights. At the same time, according to the Investigative Committee, Timofeev practically did not analyze the data of the flight recorders, which recorded these errors, and did not take any measures. In addition, the two pilots and the flight mechanic of the deceased crew performed only the third flight together.\n\n\"The causes of the disaster have not been established.\"\n\nIn October Timofeev was sentenced to five years in prison, but he was amnestied in the courtroom. He never admitted his guilt. “I believe that the main reason for the crash was misalignment (the location of passengers and luggage - approx. \"Lenta.ru\"). The crew was high class, but the situation was superior. I'm not sure if the other crew would have handled this situation. The flight geography of these guys can be the envy of many professional pilots, ”Timofeev said.\n\nTimofeev rejects the explanation of the catastrophe by involuntary pressing on the brake. “I don’t believe the pilots have pressed the brakes for such a long time, and none of the pilots believes,” he says. According to him, the dead crew was well prepared and before the crash the pilots on the same plane had flown at least 60 hours, making flights to Makhachkala, Tomsk, Riga, Aktyubinsk.\n\nThe relatives of those killed in the plane crash also consider Timofeev innocent and petitioned to send the case for further investigation. In September 2015, the mothers of the deceased hockey players Artem Yarchuk, Alexander Vasyunov and Ivan Tkachenko announced their intention to seek justice. “The main case of the death of our children has not yet been completed by the Investigative Committee,” said Angelica Yarchuk. “We will apply for the appointment of new examinations, since, in our opinion, the causes of the disaster have not been established,” added Lyubov Vasyunova.\n\nThey demanded a re-examination of the audio negotiations of the deceased crew, video recording at Tunoshna airport on September 7, 2011, an examination of the runway in Yaroslavl and the front landing gear of the crashed Yak-42. They also do not believe in the version of the IAC about involuntary pressing on the brakes. “So far, the Investigative Committee has not informed us about how the investigation is going and when it can be brought to court,” Yarchuk said.\n\nThe victims did not achieve adequate compensation either. In December 2015, the Moscow City Court left the same amount of insurance compensation to the relatives of the hockey team that died in the plane crash.\n\nThe main volume of payments fell on the insurance company \"Lexgarant\", which insured the aircraft hull insurance and the airline's liability in the amount of approximately $ 1 million. The amount of payments for each deceased passenger was 2 million rubles.\n\nIn addition, all hockey players were insured against accidents in the SOGAZ insurance company as part of the insurance of the Continental Hockey League teams. The total amount of payments under the package exceeded 90.5 million rubles. Additional accident insurance for the players of this team was carried out in the UralSib company, the insured amount was 100 thousand rubles for each.\n\nAccording to the results of an independent investigation into the causes of the plane crash, it was not the actions of one of the pilots that led to the tragedy, but the design flaws of the crashed liner and disruptions in the operation of the Yak-Service airline. At the request of the relatives of the deceased hockey players and crew members, an analysis of the tragedy was carried out by test pilot, 1st class pilot Vladimir Gerasimov, Russia's leading expert on plane crashes Valentin Dudin and 1st class test pilot Alexander Akimenkov.\n\nExperts concluded that the crash was caused by structural and aerodynamic deficiencies of the Yak-42 aircraft. According to experts, one of the pilots could really press the brake pedal, but the reason for this should be sought in the imperfect design of the pedals, as well as in the absence of recommendations for correct position pilots' feet on the pedals of these liners.\n\nThe authors of the investigation believe that since the pilots managed to lift the plane into the air, then initially there was no catastrophic or even emergency situation. Gerasimov said that the immediate cause of the crash was the lack of lateral controllability of the aircraft, that is, the Yak-42 in the air simply fell on its side.\n\nFor almost 23 years sports world did not declare mourning for the plane crashes that killed the members football teams... Brazilian club Chapecoense, which was supposed to bring team members and journalists to the match with Atlético Nacional in the framework of the South American Cup. There were 72 passengers and 9 crew members on board. Rescue operations are currently underway at the crash site. According to preliminary information, six passengers survived. The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) has suspended all matches under its auspices. We recall other cases of disasters in the air that affected the world of football.\n\n1.May 4, 1949 \"Torino\"\n\nAt the end of the 40s of the last century, Torino was one of the top clubs in Italy, ahead of its neighbors from Juventus in terms of fame and popularity. From 1946 to 1948, the \"bulls\" took the championship three times under the captaincy Valentino Mazzola, the father of the legendary Sandro Mazzola.\n\nOn May 3, 1949, Torino played a match with Benfica in Lisbon, which ended in a defeat - 3: 4. The football players' mood was raised by the meeting with friends from Milan in Barcelona. The plane of the Turin people landed at the local airport for refueling, while the Milanese were transferring to a flight to Madrid. As it turned out, the Rossoneri were the last to see the Torino players alive. The plane of the team got into a zone of increased nebula, the pilot lost his orientation in space and with his left wing touched the fence of the basilica built on the hill. The plane turned around and hit the ground with force. Everyone on board died. Of the players, only Lauro Toma remained, who did not fly to the match due to injury.\n\n2.February 6, 1958 \"Manchester United\"\n\nOne of the most resonant disasters in the history of world sports. The Busby Babes have forever entered the annals of English football and left an indelible mark on the hearts of fans around the world. All the more terrible was the tragedy that occurred on February 6, 1958 at the Munich airport. Despite the fact that air travel was in the high-risk category at the time, Manchester United flew across Europe, combining weekend performances in England and European Cup matches on weekdays. The club ordered a charter flight for the match with Crvena Zvezda in Belgrade. Problems began in Munich, where the aircraft landed for refueling. After two unsuccessful takeoff attempts, the crew was ready to postpone the flight, but in the end a third attempt was made, which ended in tragedy. The plane did not manage to take off in time and rammed a house with a hangar in which a car with fuel was parked. 21 people died on the spot, including eight United players. In 1960, a clock was installed on the southeast stand of Old Trafford with the date \"February 6, 1958\" at the top and the inscription \"Munich\" at the bottom, which remains there to this day. Every year on February 6, when their arrows show the time of the plane crash - 3:40 pm, a minute of silence is announced at Old Trafford in memory of the victims of the Munich disaster.\n\nBlack date in the history of Manchester United\n\n51 years ago, the plane crashed at Munich-Riem airport, on which the footballers of the English club “Manchester United” were returning home from the away match of the European Cup.\n\n3.16 July 1960 Denmark squad\n\nIn the early 60s, there was no professional football in Denmark as such. Players were even forbidden to play for foreign clubs under threat of non-recruitment to the national team. Nevertheless, the Danes were diligently preparing to fight for getting to Olympic Games in Rome. Copenhagen Airport to Herning for a match national team eight players were eliminated. The board crashed 50 meters from the coast due to bad weather conditions. Only the pilot and the footballer survived Sig Windel, which fishermen found near the coast. Lucky for another player too - Eric Dureborg, who was removed from the flight due to disgusting behavior at the airport. The Danish national team was seriously considering withdrawing from the tournament, but in the end they won silver medals in Rome.\n\n4.April 3, 1961. Green Cross\n\nA year later, another football team crashed in a plane crash. Playing in the first division of the Chilean championship, \"Green Cross\" flew from Santiago airport for the match of the next round. The footballers were not destined to get to the place - the entire crew and passengers died after the plane collided with the Las Lastimas mountain range in the Cordillera.\n\n5.September 26, 1969 \"Strongest\"\n\nOn September 26, 1969, a military coup took place in Bolivia. However, this event also faded into the background when the largest plane crash in the history of the country took place on the same day. A passenger liner collided with a mountain in the Cordillera massif. All 74 passengers, including 16 players on board and the coaching staff best team the Strongest countries were killed. The South American Football Federation declared mourning and allocated $ 20,000 to the club. Many footballers who had previously played for the Strongest returned to the club at a reduced rate. Five years later, the club won the Bolivian championship again.\n\n6.December 31, 1970 Air Liquid\n\nA few months later, the plane carrying the Algerian Air Liquid team to Spain for a friendly tournament did not reach its destination. All passengers and crew members were killed.\n\n7.August 11, 1979 \"Pakhtakor\"\n\nIn the late 70s, one of the most terrible sports tragedies in history Soviet football... Tashkent \"Pakhtakor\", flying to the match in Minsk, got into a plane crash, which became one of the largest in the history of the country. Two planes collided in the sky over Dneprodzerzhinsk - none of the passengers of both aircraft survived. Among the dead 178 people were 17 members of \"Pakhtakor\". Due to the fact that the team was popular in the country, it was not possible to remain silent about the tragedy. All members of the football team were buried in Tashkent at the Botkin cemetery of the city, where a monument was erected to them. And \"Pakhtakor\" itself, according to the rule introduced in the regulations, for three years retained its place in elite division THE USSR.\n\nThe first Russian football publication and Dick Advocaat's debut in the Russian national team. What else do you remember on August 11 in the history of football?\n\n8.December 8, 1987 Alliance Lima\n\nIn December 1987, 43 people - football players, managers, coaches and fans of the Peruvian Alliance Lima team - died in a plane crash. Their plane, carrying passengers home after a national championship match, crashed into the sea six miles north of the capital, Lima.\n\n9.June 7, 1989. Dutch footballers\n\nThe football world could have lost Frank Rykard and Ruud Gullita at the height of their football fame. Fortunately, both stars did not travel to their historic homeland in Suriname to participate in a tournament with three local clubs. Rijkaard, Gullit, Aron Winter and Brian Roy refused to fly, citing a desire to properly prepare for the new season. This decision saved their lives. The pilots of the plane taking off from Amsterdam, while landing in Paramaribo, made a mistake and caught a tree with their wing. As a result of the crash, 11 out of 187 people survived. All 15 players on board died.\n\n10.April 27, 1993 Zambia squad\n\nThe Zambian Air Force organized a special flight to take the national team of their country to Dakar, where it was to play a qualifying match for the 1994 World Cup with a team from Senegal. During the first refueling, problems were discovered with one of the engines. However, the pilot made a decision to continue the flight. As a result, a few minutes after takeoff, the engine caught fire, and the plane fell into the water 500 meters from the coast. All passengers were killed. From the national team of Zambia, only one who traveled independently from the Netherlands survived Kalusha Bvalya and the injured goalkeeper Charles Musonda.\n\nIt's hard to remember this. But fate cannot be changed. Six years ago, at 16.00, a Yak-42D airliner crashed into the banks of the Tunoshonka River. So perished hockey team\"Locomotive\".\n\nI remember that day as it is now.\n\nThe season opened in Ufa, where the match for the Opening Cup between Salavat Yulaev and Atlant took place. An hour before the game, a press conference of the KHL president and sponsors took place. Everyone was in high spirits, as we gathered for the holiday.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour before the throw-in, they went to their places. Buried in computers ...\n\nAnd suddenly the terrible news began to spread like spilled ink on a white sheet of paper.\n\n- Have you seen? The plane with Lokomotiv crashed ...\n\n- Are you kidding! How…\n\n- What if a mistake? Someone started a duck?\n\n- There are no such ducks ...\n\n- Call someone from the team!\n\nBut the telephones were muffled. And the news fell. Details, facts. It was very painful.\n\n\"At 16.00 near Yaroslavl, during takeoff from the Tunoshna airport ...\"\n\nAll this was happening in the room where the commentators are sitting. And below there was a game on the ice. Salavat Yulaev's defender Andrei Kuteikin shot from the blue line with a beautiful snap, scoring the first goal of the season.\n\nThere, behind the glass, life was still in full swing. There was hockey. Maybe, after all, we were ridiculously played?\n\nBut a cold whisper was already creeping across the stands. The match was stopped. A pale Alexander Medvedev appeared near the owners' shop. I will never forget his speech. And I can't imagine how difficult it was to announce this to the whole world.\n\n“A terrible grief happened today. The plane crashed with Lokomotiv hockey players, club administrators and coaches on board. Of the 37 people, only one survived. Whether to continue the match or not, we will decide during the break. I ask you to honor the memory of the victims with a minute of silence.\n\nEverything inside finally turned upside down, flew down somewhere. Many hockey players cried like children. They were taken to the dressing rooms.\n\nThe Atlanta players drove to the church. They crashed Jan Marek, who played in the final of last season. So hastily moved to Lokomotiv that they did not manage to present him with a silver medal.\n\nThe Swedes sobbed Fernholm, Zakrisson, Andersson - their friend Stefan Liv was killed. Slovak Radivojevic lost Pavol Demitra. Alexey Kovalev was left without Alexander Karpovtsev, Igor Korolev. Konstantin Rudenko played for Lokomotiv, but moved to Mytishchi in the offseason. It saved him ...\n\nIt was scary in Ufa, and Yaroslavl was generally blackened by trouble. Colleagues who ended up there are forever engraved in the memory of the pouring rain in the middle of the night. And the flashing lights of cars near the morgue of the Solovyov hospital, where the burnt bodies of players were brought, who were taken out of the river. Identification was in progress ...\n\nAnd next to the \"Arena-2000\" hills of flowers have grown. Photos of the guys, burning candles. No rainstorm could extinguish them.\n\nThere was a glimmer of hope that Alexander Galimov would survive. He was terribly burned, doctors tried to save him. Transportation to Moscow. But the miracle did not happen. Sasha left after five days ...\n\nThat plane crash hooked everyone, broke the lives of families, very many people with a spreading crack. Citizens of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Sweden, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia, Canada were killed in that plane. Nine countries. And everyone was united by a common grief.\n\nWe must remember September 7th. So, in detail. Come to the Leontief cemetery in Yaroslavl. To other places where the guys found their last peace.\n\nWhat can we give them now? Only memory. And respect. So, I cannot imagine why the school named after Ivan Tkachenko, over which the poor father of the captain of Lokomotiv has been beating for many years, has not yet been built in Yaroslavl. The results of the investigation into why the plane crashed also raise questions. The tragedy was overgrown with rumors that turned into myths. But there is no clear answer ...\n\nLive for the living. And don't forget the crew crashed on takeoff on that black Wednesday.\n\nEverlasting memory.\n\nLokomotiv -2011\n\nGoalkeepers: Alexander Vyukhin, Stefan Liv.\n\nDefenders: Vitaly Anikeenko, Mikhail Balandin, Robert Dietrich, Marat Kalimulin, Karel Rakhunek, Ruslan Salei, Karlis Skrastinsh, Pavel Trakhanov, Yuri Urychev, Maxim Shuvalov.\n\nForwards: Alexander Vasyunov, Joseph Vasychek, Alexander Galimov, Pavol Demitra, Alexander Kalyanin, Andrey Kiryukhin, Nikita Klyukin, Yan Marek, Sergey Ostapchuk, Pavel Snurnitsyn, Daniil Sobchenko, Ivan Tkachenko, Gennady Churilov, Artem Yarchuk.\n\nTrainers: Brad McCrimmon, Alexander Karpovtsev, Igor Korolev, Nikolai Krivonosov.\n\nStaff: Yuri Bakhvalov, Alexander Belyaev, Andrey Zimin, Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, Evgeny Kunnov, Vladimir Piskunov, Evgeny Sidorov.\n\nOn September 7, 2011 Yaroslavl Lokomotiv was heading to Minsk for the Kontinental Hockey League regular championship match with the local Dynamo. The game, scheduled for September 8, was supposed to be the first for Yaroslavl in the new season.\n\nThe Yak-42 plane was taking off at the Tunoshna airport in Yaroslavl.

There were 45 people on board, 43 died on the spot.\n\nThree Belarusians were among the dead: hockey players Ruslan Salei and Sergey Ostapchuk and also a fitness coach Nikolay Krivonosov.\n\nThe Minsk publishing house \"Medison\" in September 2012 published a book sports journalist Sergey Olekhnovich about the Belarusian hockey player Ruslan Salei “Simply the best. Simply the Best \". True, its author did not live to see the release of the work, leaving this world on July 27, 2012 at the age of 45.

He died five days later.\n\nSizov was hospitalized with burns of 15 percent of his body, fractures of both hips, vault of the skull, ribs and injuries chest... On the day of the tragedy, he, along with Galimov, was transported to Moscow on an emergency plane. At the Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine, the victim was put into a drug-induced sleep so that he could avoid a state of shock. Sizov recovered and after that worked as an aircraft technician at the Yakovlev Design Bureau in Zhukovsky."
