        "text": "“An hour before the match, Alexander Medvedev held a press conference, at which the head of the league spoke about the KHL’s plans. Hockey officials and journalists smiled and joked a lot. The beginning of the season is a holiday.\n\nWe went to work. And 10 minutes before the first face-off (16.50 Moscow time), black news appeared on the websites that at 16.02 a plane carrying the Lokomotiv team crashed near Yaroslavl.\n\nOnly those who were at the computers knew about it right away. And even then they didn’t believe it, they stared dumbfounded at the screens. The hockey players started the game. Salavat Yulaev defender Andrey Kuteikin even scored the first goal of the championship, shooting beautifully from the blue line...\n\nBut the information was already spreading around the stadium and began to reach people. Medvedev appeared near the Ufa team’s bench with a pale face. Five minutes before the end of the first period, he entered the ice. He raised his hand to attract the attention of the players, to stop them - the hockey players did not understand what was happening.\n\n“Today a terrible tragedy happened,” said the KHL president, finding it difficult to find words. – A plane carrying Lokomotiv hockey players, administrators and coaches of the club crashed. Of the 37 people, only one survived. We will decide whether to continue the match or not during the break of the hockey match. I ask you to honor the memory of the victims with a minute of silence.\n\nThere was a pause in the stadium. The captain of the Salavat Yulaev, Viktor Kozlov, began to cry. The hockey players were taken to the locker rooms...\"\n\nA year ago, on September 7, 2011, a Yak-42D passenger aircraft with tail number RA-42434 of JSC Aviation Company Yak Service, performing an irregular international flight to transport passengers on the route Yaroslavl (Tunosha) - Minsk, from Tunosha airport in Yaroslavskaya areas.\n\nThere were 45 people on board the plane: the team of the Yaroslavl hockey club \"Lokomotiv\" - 37 passengers - and eight crew members. The players of the main team of the hockey team were heading to Minsk, where the next day a game was scheduled with the Dynamo hockey club - Lokomotiv's first match of the Continental Hockey League (KHL) season.\n\nYaroslav Neelov\n\nHockey club \"Lokomotiv\" (Yaroslavl)\n\nIn normal weather conditions, the plane began its takeoff run on the runway at Tunoshna airport.\n\nThe plane gained an altitude of no more than five to six meters, then collided with the localizer antenna system (LOB), located 435 meters from the end of the runway and having a height of about three meters, with the LOC container, then with an intense left roll collided with the base of the approach lights ( airfield lighting system) and trees, hit the ground approximately 600 meters from the end of the runway, on the bank of the Tunoshonka River, and collapsed. The bulk of the plane's fragments were scattered at a distance of 800-900 meters from the end of the runway.\n\n43 people died immediately (39 people - from instant mechanical injuries to the body, three people - due to drowning, one person died due to thermal injuries to the body).\n\nOnly two survived - hockey player Alexander Galimov and flight engineer Alexander Sizov. Both ended up in the river after the plane crashed. Galimov was conscious, was able to walk away from the burning plane himself and gave his name to the police.\n\nThe survivors were hospitalized.\n\nThe athlete, who received burns to 90% of his body, was taken to the burn department of the Vishnevsky Institute of Surgery in Moscow, where he died on September 12.\n\nSizov the day after the disaster at the Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Medicine in Moscow with multiple fractures of the ribs, a comminuted fracture of the femur, a penetrating head wound with brain damage and burns to 15% of the body. The patient's condition was extremely serious.\n\nThe forward of the Lokomotiv team, 20-year-old Maxim Zyuzyakin, and the Finnish goalkeeper coach Jorma Valtonen, who worked at the Yaroslavl club, survived for the match in Minsk.\n\nOn September 7, the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) formed a commission to investigate the causes and circumstances of the disaster.\n\nA criminal case was initiated into the disaster under Part 3 of Article 263 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. An investigation into a technical malfunction of the aircraft and a pilot error.\n\nDue to the death of the main team, the Lokomotiv team joined the Continental Hockey League (KHL) in the 2011-2012 season.\n\nSeptember 10 at the Yaroslavl Ice Sports Palace. 14 people were buried directly in Yaroslavl, the bodies of the remaining victims were transported to other cities and countries. Among the dead were citizens of Ukraine, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Sweden and Latvia.\n\nRIA News. Vladimir Terentyev\n\n\"Lokomotiv\" as we will remember it\n\nBy September 15, Rostransnadzor had inspected all 15 airlines operating Yak-42 aircraft. As a result of the inspection, three aircraft were suspended from flights, and a total of 28 Yak-42 aircraft were inspected.\n\nOn September 22, Alexander Sizov, a ground engineer for aviation and radio-electronic equipment who survived the crash, was interrogated by Georgy Yachmenev, Deputy Chairman of the MAK for Aircraft Accident Investigation, Honored Pilot of the USSR. According to Alexander Sizov, there were no comments on the operation of the aircraft either during preparation for the flight or during takeoff. Sizov noted that he did not see who was flying the plane during takeoff. Sizov did not remember the moment of the disaster itself; he only remembered how the liner took off, and the next moment he woke up in the water, where spilled kerosene was burning.\n\nAccording to Sizov’s testimony, the IAC clarified the actual placement of passengers and luggage: the team’s management and coaches were in the front cabin, the team was in the second cabin, and the bulk of the luggage was loaded into the rear trunk. This means that the plane was unable to take off normally due to a misalignment, since the bulk of the passengers were allegedly in the front cabin.\n\nAt the beginning of October 2011, flight engineer Alexander Sizov successfully underwent plastic surgery on his face and neck.\n\nRIA News. Yaroslav Neelov\n\nMemorial complex to the members of the Lokomotiv hockey club who died in a plane crash on September 7, 2011, at the Leontyevskoye cemetery in Yaroslavl.\n\nThe material was prepared based on information from RIA Novosti and open sources\n\nIt's hard to remember this. But fate cannot be changed. Six years ago, at 16.00, a Yak-42D airliner crashed into the bank of the Tunoshonka River. This is how the Lokomotiv hockey team died.\n\nI remember that day as if it were now.\n\nThe season opened in Ufa, where the match for the Opening Cup took place between Salavat Yulaev and Atlant. An hour before the game, a press conference was held by the KHL president and sponsors. Everyone was in high spirits, because we had gathered for the holiday.\n\nA quarter of an hour before the throw-in, we went to our places. Bumped into computers...\n\nAnd suddenly the terrible news began to spread like spilled ink on a white sheet of paper.\n\n-Have you seen it? The plane carrying Lokomotiv crashed...\n\n- Are you kidding! How…\n\n— What if there’s a mistake? Did someone launch a duck?\n\n- There are no such ducks...\n\n- Call someone from the team!\n\nBut the phones were silent. And the news was falling. Details, facts. It was very painful.\n\n“At 16.00 near Yaroslavl, during takeoff from Tunoshna airport...”\n\nAll this happened in the room where the commentators sit. And below on the ice there was a game going on. Salavat Yulaev defender Andrey Kuteikin fired a beautiful shot from the blue line and scored the first goal of the season.\n\nThere, behind the glass, life was still in full swing. It was hockey. Maybe we were being played ridiculously after all?\n\nBut a cold whisper had already spread through the stands. The match was stopped. A pale Alexander Medvedev appeared near the owners’ shop. I will never forget his speech. And I can’t imagine how difficult it was to announce this to the whole world.\n\n“Today a terrible tragedy happened. A plane carrying Lokomotiv hockey players, administrators and coaches of the club crashed. Of the 37 people, only one survived. We will decide whether to continue the match or not during the break. I ask you to honor the memory of the victims with a minute of silence.\n\nEverything inside completely turned upside down and flew down somewhere. Many hockey players cried like children. They were taken to the locker rooms.\n\nThe Atlanta players went to church. Jan Marek, who competed in the final of last season, crashed. He moved to Lokomotiv so quickly that they did not have time to award him a silver medal.\n\nThe Swedes Fernholm, Zakrisson, Andersson cried - their friend Stefan Liv died. Slovakian Radivojevic lost Pavol Demitra. Alexey Kovalev was left without Alexander Karpovtsev and Igor Korolev. Konstantin Rudenko played for Lokomotiv, but in the off-season he moved to Mytishchi. This saved him...\n\nIt was terrible in Ufa, and Yaroslavl generally turned black from disaster. The torrential rain late at night was forever etched in the memory of the colleagues who were there. And the flashing lights of cars near the morgue of the Solovyov hospital, where the charred bodies of the players who were taken out of the river were brought. Identification was underway...\n\nAnd hills of flowers grew next to Arena 2000. Photos of the guys, burning candles. No amount of rain could extinguish them.\n\nThere was a glimmer of hope that Alexander Galimov would survive. He was terribly burned and doctors tried to save him. Transportation to Moscow. But the miracle did not happen. Sasha left five days later...\n\nThat plane crash affected everyone, split the lives of families and many people into a spreading crack. Citizens of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Sweden, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia, and Canada died on that plane. Nine countries. And everyone was united by a common grief.\n\nWe need to remember September 7th. That's it, in detail. Come to the Leontievskoe cemetery in Yaroslavl. To other places where the guys found their final rest.\n\nWhat can we give them now? Only memory. And respect. So, I can’t imagine why a school named after Ivan Tkachenko has not yet been built in Yaroslavl, over which the poor father of the Lokomotiv captain has been struggling for many years. The results of the investigation into why the plane crashed also raise questions. The tragedy was overgrown with rumors that turned into myths. But there is no clear answer...\n\nLive for the sake of the living. And don’t forget the team that crashed on takeoff on that black Wednesday.\n\nEverlasting memory.\n\n\"Lokomotiv\" -2011\n\nGoalkeepers: Alexander Vyukhin, Stefan Liv.\n\nDefenders: Vitaly Anikeenko, Mikhail Balandin, Robert Dietrich, Marat Kalimulin, Karel Rakhunek, Ruslan Salei, Karlis Skrastins, Pavel Trakhanov, Yuri Urychev, Maxim Shuvalov.\n\nForwards: Alexander Vasyunov, Josef Vashichek, Alexander Galimov, Pavol Demitra, Alexander Kalyanin, Andrey Kiryukhin, Nikita Klyukin, Jan Marek, Sergey Ostapchuk, Pavel Snurnitsyn, Daniil Sobchenko, Ivan Tkachenko, Gennady Churilov, Artem Yarchuk.\n\nTrainers: Brad McCrimmon, Alexander Karpovtsev, Igor Korolev, Nikolai Krivonosov.\n\nStaff: Yuri Bakhvalov, Alexander Belyaev, Andrey Zimin, Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, Evgeny Kunnov, Vladimir Piskunov, Evgeny Sidorov.\n\nOn September 7, 2011, Yaroslavl Lokomotiv was heading to Minsk for a match of the regular championship of the Kontinental Hockey League with the local Dynamo. The game, scheduled for September 8, was supposed to be the first for the Yaroslavl team in the new season.\n\nThe Yak-42 aircraft took off at Yaroslavl Tunoshna airport. The airliner was unable to reach a safe altitude (it rose 5-6 meters), crashed into a lighthouse antenna 435 meters from the runway and crashed to the ground. There were 45 people on board the plane, 43 died on the spot.\n\nAmong the dead were three Belarusians: hockey players Ruslan Salei And Sergey Ostapchuk and also a physical trainer Nikolay Krivonosov.\n\nIn September 2012, the Minsk publishing house Medisont published a book by sports journalist Sergei Olekhnovich about the Belarusian hockey player Ruslan Salei, “Simply the best. Simply the Best.\" True, its author did not live to see the publication of the work, leaving this world on July 27, 2012 at the 45th year of his life. He managed to submit the book for printing and receive an advance copy.\n\nOn May 25, 2014, during the 2014 World Hockey Championship in Minsk, the former captain of the Belarusian national team Ruslan Salei was (IIHF).\n\nSergei Ostapchuk and Nikolai Krivonosov were buried on September 11, 2011 at the capital's Kalvariyskoe cemetery. In memory of Sergei Ostapchuk, a youth hockey tournament is held annually in his homeland in Novopolotsk.\n\nSitting in the back of the cabin were 26-year-old railway striker Alexander Galimov and aviation and radio-electronic equipment engineer Alexander Sizov. Both were not wearing seat belts, and during the crash they were thrown into the Tunoshonka River. When the athlete was found, he was conscious and was able to give his name to the police. He was hospitalized at the A.V. Vishnevsky Research Institute with burns to 90 percent of his body. Five days later he died.\n\nSizov was hospitalized with burns to 15 percent of his body, fractures of both hips, the calvarium, ribs and injuries to the chest. On the day of the tragedy, he and Galimov were transported to Moscow on an Emergencies Ministry plane. At the Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Medicine, the victim was put into medicated sleep to avoid shock. Sizov recovered and then worked as an aircraft technician at the Yakovlev Design Bureau in Zhukovsky.\n\nLokomotiv was forced to spend one season in the Major Hockey League (VHL), after which they returned to the KHL.\n\n“We have learned to love what we have” On September 7, 2011, Yaroslavl “Lokomotiv” died in a plane crash\n\nOn September 7, a march of silence will be held in ancient Yaroslavl in memory of the tragically killed Lokomotiv hockey players. Thousands of fans will take part in it.\n\nOn September 7, a march of silence will be held in ancient Yaroslavl in memory of the tragically killed Lokomotiv hockey players. Thousands of fans will take part in it.\n\nAs Soviet Sport found out, this popular initiative has an author. This is a modest Yaroslavl girl Ekaterina Kozhan. How can you not kiss such a hand?..\n\nKatya has been a fan of Lokomotiv since 2005. Since moving to Yaroslavl from Karelia as a student...\n\n– There is no official fan club in Yaroslavl. But what loyal fans the team is! And I gradually joined this family... - Ekaterina recalls. – In general, I don’t go on trips for Lokomotiv very often. But I’m proud that in December I went with our team to Chelyabinsk for the VHL championship match.\n\n– Have you seen the game of the new Lokomotiv, which is about to start in the KHL championship?\n\n- Yes. Two matches during pre-season. In Moscow with CSKA and in Yaroslavl with the St. Petersburg army team. It was important to see not only the new names of the players, but also how the guys in the hockey jerseys of our beloved Lokomotiv play.\n\n– Did you like the game?\n\n– It was obvious that many young guys literally left their teeth on the ice! This is how they wanted to prove themselves, to get into the main team. Well, they bounced balls off seasoned opponents. It was nice that our adults stood up for them. Alexey Kalyuzhny rushed into the fray... It’s immediately clear that the team is united.\n\n“I SEE KOZLOV AS CAPTAIN”\n\n– Who, in your opinion, is the leader of the new Lokomotiv?\n\n– I can’t determine yet. I would like it to be defender Vitaly Vishnevsky. He played for Lokomotiv after all. And, therefore, it can convey to newcomers the special spirit of our team.\n\n- And what is this spirit like?\n\n– Lokomotiv has always been a family team. Our guys didn't just play together. They were friends throughout life. I noticed that people with rottenness did not stay long at Lokomotiv... The players often got together. The whole team could go out of town and have a heartfelt and warm conversation with the fans. That’s why we, the fans, considered ourselves and the fans to be one family.\n\n– You spoke about the leader. Who would you like to see as the captain of the new Lokomotiv? Or are the captain and the leader the same person?\n\n– Viktor Kozlov deserves to be captain. I know that all the players treat him with respect. And he himself is a very open person.\n\nEMIL GALIMOV WAS WARMLY RECEIVED...\n\n– How did Yaroslavl fans react to the fact that Alexander Galimov’s namesake, Emil, appeared in Lokomotiv?\n\n- When Emil scored the first goal in Yaroslavl in December at the tower, and the announcer announced: Emil scored the goal... people shouted the name Galimov so much that tears flowed from my eyes. This newcomer was received very warmly by the fans.\n\n– What do you think, will the team’s long-time fans generally accept the new Lokomotiv?\n\n– For some, of course, it’s more difficult than, for example, for me to accept new players. But they will perform in our “classic” uniform. A year without a team taught us, fans, to appreciate and love what we have here and now. You can't live in the past all the time...\n\nHOW IT WAS\n\nWHAT HAPPENED NEAR YAROSLAVL A YEAR AGO\n\nOn September 7 at 15.58, the Yak-42 aircraft with Lokomotiv on board received permission to take off at Yaroslavl Tunoshna airport. The charter flight was supposed to take the team to Minsk. In the capital of Belarus, a meeting of the KHL regular championship with the local Dynamo was scheduled for the next day.\n\nA minute and a half after takeoff, having flown about 120 meters, the Yak-42 fell on the left wing. Almost immediately there was a kerosene explosion...\n\nOn board was the entire main staff of the Yaroslavl team - 37 hockey players, coaches and staff, as well as 8 crew members.\n\nOnly two passengers survived the crash: team striker Alexander Galimov, who had 90 percent of his body burns, and flight engineer Alexander Sizov, with 15 percent of burns.\n\nOn September 12, Alexander Galimov, who struggled with death for five days after the disaster, died at the capital’s Vishnevsky Institute of Surgery. Later, experts will say that it is almost impossible to survive with such a percentage of burns.\n\n“90 percent of burns... How can I explain to you what such an extensive burn is,” the doctors said. – Well, to be very approximate... It’s like throwing a naked person out into the bitter forty-degree frost for several hours. In such a situation, one could only hope for a miracle. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen...”\n\nAlexander Sizov was discharged from the hospital after some time.\n\nOn November 12, the Interstate Aviation Committee published the results of the investigation into the Yak-42 crash, which led to the death of Lokomotiv. The plane crash, according to the commission, was provoked by the actions of one of the pilots, who mistakenly used the brakes instead of “pressing the gas”...\n\nWhere can I get cartridges that don't blow away?

Chairman of the commission Morozov A.N., Deputy Chairman Kashirsky L.A.\n\nThe commission leaves for the scene of the accident.\n\nSeptember 7, 2011\n\nThe technical commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee continues to work at the site of the accident with the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft of the Yak Service airline, which occurred on September 7, 2011 in the area of ​​the Yaroslavl airfield.\n\nThe main area of ​​work is compiling a map of the scene of the incident and lifting the tail section of the aircraft in order to detect the flight recorders located there, the so-called “black boxes”.\n\nSeptember 8, 2011\n\nAt the scene of the accident with the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft, protected parametric and audio flight information recorders were found.\n\nInspection, autopsy and work to determine the presence of a recording of the accident flight will be carried out in the laboratory of the Interstate Aviation Committee.\n\nThe commission continues to work at the scene of the accident in the area of ​​the Yaroslavl airfield.\n\nSeptember 8, 2011\n\nThe on-board recorders of parametric and sound information discovered at the site of the Yak-42 RA-42434 crash were transferred to the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC).\n\nThe recorders were sent to the IAC laboratory, where they will be inspected, dried, opened, the recorders will be determined, the presence of records of the accident flight will be determined, and the records will be copied for analysis in order to identify the factors and causes of the occurrence and development of the emergency.\n\nSeptember 9, 2011\n\nIn the laboratory of the Interstate Aviation Committee, where the flight recorders (the so-called “black boxes”) of the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft that crashed near the Yaroslavl airfield were delivered at night, they were examined and opened.\n\nThe appearance of the recorders and storage media (magnetic tape) is satisfactory. Magnetic tapes are wet.\n\nAfter the tapes had dried, processing of the existing recordings began.\n\nThere is a recording of the accident flight on media.\n\nSeptember 9, 2011\n\nIn the laboratory of the Interstate Aviation Committee, in order to further carry out work on processing and decoding records of parametric and audio information recorded by the flight recorders of the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft of YakService airlines during the emergency flight, this information was copied.\n\nPre-processing of the recorded parametric information allows us to determine that, before the aircraft took off, the stabilizer was set to the “pitch up” position of 8.7 degrees and the aircraft flaps were set to the take-off position of 20 degrees. The engines were running until the collision with obstacles.\n\nSeptember 12, 2011\n\nThe technical commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) to investigate the crash of the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft with the participation of the Federal Air Transport Agency and the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia has almost completed work on the field stage of the investigation (collection of surviving fragments and assemblies of the aircraft, establishing the location of the accident, collection and analysis flight and technical documentation of the aircraft, airfield and its services and other necessary work).\n\nThe IAC Scientific and Technical Center is completing the processing and decoding of on-board parametric and sound recorders.\n\nFlight, scientific and technical experts were involved in the analysis of available information about the accident flight.\n\nBased on the preliminary results of decoding and analyzing the available data and submitted documentation, it was established:\n\n1. The Yak-42 aircraft, tail number RA-42434, produced in 1993, has a total flight time of about 6500 hours, which is 2 times less than the assigned resource - 12000 hours.\n\n2. The take-off weight of the aircraft was less than the maximum permissible for take-off.\n\n3. According to the parametric recorder, there were about 14 tons of fuel on board, of which 8 tons were refueled at the Yaroslavl airfield (fuel analysis is underway).\n\n4. Before takeoff, the crew checked all aircraft control channels, including the elevator channel. The rudders deflected as normal.\n\n5. Weather conditions at the airfield, incl. the magnitude of the side wind did not interfere with the flight.\n\n6. The engines were running until the moment of impact with the ground.\n\n7. Before takeoff, the stabilizer and flaps were set to the takeoff position.\n\n8. No one-time commands indicating aircraft failures were recorded on the parametric recorder record. At the same time, the surviving elements of the systems are sent for research to specialized research centers.\n\nThe technical commission does not exclude the possibility of conducting a full-scale experiment on an analogue aircraft.\n\nThe IAC Technical Commission established contact with the aviation accident investigation authorities of those states whose citizens were on board the aircraft - the Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia, Sweden, Latvia and Canada, with which the IAC previously had constant working contacts. State experts may, if necessary and in agreement with the IAC, take part in the investigation of this aviation accident.\n\nThe technical commission continues its work.\n\nSeptember 17, 2011\n\nBased on the results of the field stage of the investigation into the crash of the Yak-42 RA 42434 aircraft in the area of ​​the Yaroslavl airfield and in accordance with the preliminary analysis of the available documentation and decoding data of objective control means, the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) established:\n\nThe take-off weight and balance of the aircraft were within acceptable limits.\n\nBefore the start of the take-off run, the flaps were set to 20 degrees (take-off position), the stabilizer was set to 8.7 degrees for pitching up, which corresponds to the calculated alignment of 24-25% of the MAR.\n\nBefore takeoff, the crew checked all aircraft control channels twice, including the elevator channel; the elevator deflected normally. The maximum recorded deflection of the elevator for pitching up is 21 degrees, which corresponds to the structural stop. The last check was performed 1 minute 40 seconds before the start of the takeoff run.\n\nMeteorological conditions at the time of the accident: wind 360 – 3 m/s, visibility 10 km, cloud cover significant stratocumulus lower limit 990 m, temperature +17.8, pressure 747.9 mm Hg. Art., adhesion coefficient 0.6.\n\nThe takeoff was carried out from runway 23. The aircraft was taxied for takeoff along taxiway 5. The distance from taxiway 5 to the entrance end of runway 23 was approximately 300 meters. The total length of the runway is 3000 meters.\n\nThe crew decided to take off at nominal engine operating mode. Preliminary modeling showed that up to a speed of ~165 km/h, the aircraft's acceleration rate corresponded to the actual installed engine thrust.\n\nThe crew began lifting the nose wheel at a speed of approximately 185 km/h. The elevator was deflected to pitch up to 9-10 degrees (approximately half the travel), but the pitch angle did not increase. After 6 seconds, the engines were set to takeoff operation. Subsequently, despite the engines reaching takeoff mode, the rate of speed growth slowed down significantly, which can be explained by the appearance of additional braking force. The actual value of the additional braking force will be determined based on the results of mathematical modeling and a full-scale experiment, which is planned to be carried out on an analogue aircraft at the Flight Research Institute named after. MM. Gromova. With the participation of the Design Bureau, a flight program for its implementation is being prepared. The surviving elements of the aircraft's braking system have been sent to a specialized institute for research. Research on the brake system began on September 16.\n\nThe maximum speed reached by the aircraft is approximately 230 km/h. Despite the continued deflection of the elevator to pitch up, the aircraft did not lift off onto the runway. According to the accident scene, the actual take-off of the aircraft occurred at a distance of 400 meters behind the exit end of Runway-23 after the elevator was deflected by 13-14 degrees and the stabilizer was adjusted to pitch up to 9.5 degrees. After the aircraft took off from the ground, it collided with the localizer antenna system, as well as an intensive increase in the pitch angle to 20 degrees in 2-3 seconds. The maximum altitude the plane reached was 5-6 meters.\n\nThis was followed by an intense roll of the aircraft to the left and its collision with obstacles and the ground.\n\nBased on the results of laying out fragments of the aircraft, it was established that at the time of the accident the flaps and slats were set to the take-off position, the spoilers were retracted, and the stabilizer was in a pitch-up position of about 10 degrees. Layout of the elevator control wiring showed that there was no wiring disconnection at the time of the accident.\n\nThe technical commission is working through all possible versions of the appearance of additional braking force during the takeoff run and the reasons why the aircraft was unable to lift off from the runway in a timely manner.\n\nIn connection with numerous “versions” appearing in the media about the causes of the accident with the Yak-42D RA-42434 aircraft, with reference to “experts” close to the investigation, the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee states that official information about the investigation is contained only on MAK website. Links to any other sources, publication of unofficial materials and “replication” of various versions about the causes of the accident are contrary to moral and ethical standards, international and Russian rules for investigating aviation accidents.\n\nSeptember 22, 2011\n\nRepresentatives of the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee to investigate the crash of the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft conducted a survey of an aviation and radio-electronic equipment engineer who survived the accident. In his opinion, there were no comments on the operation of the aircraft in the previous flight, during preparation for the emergency flight and during the emergency flight. From his words, the actual placement of passengers and luggage was clarified: the team’s management staff and coaches were in the front cabin, the team was in the second cabin, and the bulk of the luggage was loaded into the rear trunk.\n\nOctober 7, 2011\n\nIn accordance with the decision of the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee for the investigation of the Yak-42D crash RA-42434 of JSC Aviation Company YAK SERVICE, specialists of OJSC Irkut Corporation, OJSC OKB im. A.S. Yakovlev\", FSUE \"LII named after. MM. Gromov\" and the State Research Institute of Civil Aviation prepared, agreed upon and approved a full-scale experiment program for reconstructing the emergency take-off of the Yak-42D aircraft on September 07, 2001 at the Tunoshna airport in Yaroslavl.\n\nFlight research will be carried out at the Flight Research Institute. MM. Gromov on an aircraft similar to the Yak-42 RA-42412 with a crew consisting of test pilots from the LII and the OKB named after. A.S. Yakovleva. Work will be carried out to equip the aircraft with additional recording equipment.\n\nDuring the full-scale experiment, it is planned to perform a normal takeoff, repeating the actions of the crew in the emergency flight, but without creating additional braking force. Next, a series of aborted takeoffs will be performed to assess the consistency of the results of mathematical modeling on the occurrence of additional braking force at various stages of the aircraft takeoff and to assess its influence on the creation of a diving moment that prevents the nose wheel from lifting and achieving the takeoff pitch angle, that is, the conditions for the aircraft to take off.\n\nSubject to weather conditions (a dry runway with a friction coefficient of 0.6 and no strong wind is required), work is planned to begin on October 10 this year.\n\nOctober 10, 2011\n\nThe Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee informs that today, during the course of the events that began at the Flight Research Institute named after. MM. Gromov flight research carried out as part of the investigation into the Yak-42D crash RA-42434, the first flight was carried out.\n\nThe purpose of the flight was to replicate the actual actions of the crew in the accident flight, but without subjecting the aircraft to additional braking force.\n\nAfter landing the aircraft, specialists began the initial processing of recorded data from objective monitoring equipment to compare the test and emergency flights.\n\nOctober 20, 2011\n\nThe technical commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee to investigate the crash of the Yak-42D aircraft, no. 42434, which occurred on 09/07/11 in Yaroslavl, guided by the provisions of Appendix 13 to the ICAO Chicago Convention and international practice, draws attention to the inadmissibility of publications and statements of various versions of the cause of this aviation accidents with reference to the materials and work of the Technical Commission or specialized aviation research, flight testing institutes and centers involved in carrying out the necessary research\n\nThe technical commission analyzes aviation accidents, including crashes, of the Yak-42 aircraft over the entire period of its operation. According to the data available to the Technical Commission, during the period of operation of the Yak-42 aircraft there was not a single aviation accident, including a disaster, for reasons related to the ergonomics of the cabin.\n\nDuring the period of operation since 1980, the operating time of the entire fleet of Yak-42 aircraft, which is operated not only in Russia, but also in a number of other countries, amounted to more than 2,346,000 flight hours and 1,230,000 flights.\n\nThe investigation continues, all aspects, facts and circumstances of the Yak-42 plane crash are being considered.\n\nThe IAC Technical Commission considers the above statements as an attempt to exert unacceptable pressure on its work, which is carried out in order to establish the causes and all circumstances of this disaster.\n\nOctober 21, 2011\n\nThe Chairman of the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee informs that the necessary stages of work to investigate the crash of the Yak-42D aircraft no. 42434, which occurred on September 7, 2011 in Yaroslavl, have been completed, including:\n\nspecial studies of wheel drums, brakes and braking system units, as well as the technical condition of aircraft tires. According to the conclusion of the FAA State Center for Flight Safety in Air Transport, no failures in the operation of the specified units were identified;\n\nprocessing and analysis of objective control means have been completed, including analysis of the state of engines, on-board systems and equipment of the aircraft, crew actions, identification of crew members’ voices;\n\nmathematical modeling of the emergency flight was performed;\n\nA flight experiment was conducted at the LII named after. MM. Gromov with the participation of experienced test pilots according to a program agreed upon by the State Scientific Research Institute of Civil Aviation and the Flight Research Institute, approved by the Flight Methodology Council of the Flight Research Institute. The data obtained during the experiment confirmed the results of mathematical modeling of the emergency flight;\n\nall submitted documentation for the Yak-Service airline was analyzed, including the organization of flight work, crew training, medical documentation and the results of inspections of the airline by Rostransnadzor and Rosaviation after the accident;\n\nAn analysis of aviation accidents and catastrophes of Yak-42 type aircraft over the entire period of their operation was carried out with the calculation of probabilistic assessments of safety failures of systems and assemblies, etc. According to the data available to the Technical Commission, during the period of operation of the Yak-42 aircraft there was not a single aviation accident, including a disaster, for reasons related to the ergonomics of the cabin.\n\nThe technical commission has all the necessary materials, the results of studies conducted by research institutes and centers, flight and technical experts to establish the systemic and immediate causes, all associated factors and circumstances of this disaster, as well as the development of a set of necessary flight safety measures.\n\nThe work will be completed within the next 2 weeks.\n\nNovember 2, 2011\n\nThe IAC published the results of the investigation into the crash of the Yak-42D RA-42434 aircraft near Yaroslavl, and also held a press conference explaining and commenting on the details of the accident. According to the commission's conclusions, the immediate cause of the disaster was the erroneous actions of the aircraft commander or co-pilot (it was not possible to establish for certain), who involuntarily pressed the brake pedals during the take-off run. This led to the emergence of a diving moment, which did not allow the aircraft to raise its nose wheel at the right time and begin lifting off the runway. Despite the emergency situation, the crew did not attempt to abort the takeoff, but continued to gain speed, setting the engine to takeoff mode, and increasing the rudder angle, trying to lift the aircraft into the air. As a result, the plane rolled off the runway 450 meters and took off from the ground only after the elevator deflection angle was about 13 degrees (twice as much as during a normal takeoff) and the stabilizer was moved to the 10-degree position. From the report on the results of flight experiments it follows that at the moment of lift-off, the force applied to the control column could reach up to 70 kgf, and to create such a force the pilots needed to press their feet even harder on the brake pedals. After lifting off the ground, the diving moment disappeared, the plane reached supercritical angles of attack (the pitch angle increased from 7 to 19 degrees in 2 seconds), rose to a height of 5-6 meters and began to fall to the left. The collision with the ground occurred 120 meters later, almost along the extended axis of the runway.\n\nThe IAC also notes that traces of phenobarbital, which has an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system, were found in the co-pilot’s body. Pilots taking this drug are not allowed to fly. In addition, from the medical documentation it follows that the co-pilot developed polyneuropathic syndrome, which manifests itself in impaired coordination of the legs and control of their spatial position. Flights with this disease are also prohibited.\n\nThe IAC identifies the following factors that contributed to the disaster:\n\nSerious shortcomings in the retraining of crew members for the Yak-42 aircraft, which was not completed in full and with long interruptions. This led to a negative experience in transferring skills when piloting Yak-40 aircraft to the Yak-42, which was expressed in the incorrect position of the feet on the pedals.\n\nLack of control on the part of the airline's flight crew over the actual level of crew training.\n\nErrors and failure to follow technological procedures made by the crew during preparation and calculation of take-off parameters, as well as during the take-off run. In particular, the value of the decision speed was incorrectly stated (190 km/h instead of 210 km/h). Also, the take-off weight, centering, and required take-off distance were not calculated.\n\nUncoordinated, uncoordinated actions of the crew in the final phase of the take-off run. At the moment the plane left the runway and shifted the stabilizer to the position of ~10 degrees, the PIC probably tried to stop the takeoff by tilting the control column away from himself, but after the co-pilot’s phrase: “What are you doing?” returned the steering wheel to its previous position. Almost at the same time, the flight mechanic, probably reacting to the actions of the PIC, but without his command, removed all the throttles to low throttle, but the co-pilot’s reaction immediately followed: “On (tszr) you!” and the “Vzlyotny” PIC team and ores were returned to their previous position. However, due to the throttle response of the engines, takeoff speed was restored only after 6 seconds. All this led to a decrease in speed. IAC notes that the actions of the co-pilot did not correspond to his actual job responsibilities. Essentially, there were two leaders in the crew, with the co-pilot having higher authority.\n\nThe final conclusion of the IAC following the investigation of the plane crash on September 7, 2011\n\nMAK investigation materials\n\nVideo reconstruction of the flight\n\nSpeech by the head of the IAC T.
