        "text": "45 Players and Staff From KHL Lokomotiv Yaroslavl Perished in a Plane Crash 5 Years Ago Today, Marking One of the Darkest Days in Hockey History\n\nTeam Russia’s World Cup of Hockey squad paid tribute to KHL Lokomotiv Yaroslavl today with a moment of silence at center ice during practice to honor the fallen. It was five years ago when we lost 45 players and staff in a deadly plane crash that sent shock-waves through the hockey world.\n\nThe KHL has made it a tradition since the tragedy not to schedule games on September 7th, and according to the league, there never will be. It’s a classy way for the Kontinental Hockey League to ensure we never forget the devastating event that took place a half decade ago.\n\nThere were initially two survivors from the plane crash, but unfortunately one of them died a few days later in hospital. Here is a full list of those 45 players and staff (list courtesy of Sportsnet.ca):\n\nKHL Lokomotiv Yaroslavl: List of 45 Players/Team Staff\n\nPLAYERS\n\nVitaly Anikeyenko\n\nYOB: 1987 NAT: Ukraine – 3rd round (70th overall) in 2005 by Ottawa\n\nMikhail Balandin\n\nYOB: 1980 NAT: Russia – Russian League Defender\n\nGennady Churilov\n\nYOB: 1987 NAT: Russia – Russian League Center, Spent One Year (2004-05) With QMJHL Quebec\n\nPavol Demitra\n\nYOB: 1974 NAT: Slovakia – 16-Year NHL Veteran (Ottawa, St.Louis, Los Angeles, Minnesota, Vancouver) 848 games played – 304 goals – 464 assists – 768 points\n\nThis loss was particularly devastating since Pavol Demitra was a favorite player of mine growing up as a kid.
