        "text": "Five years ago, on September 7, 2011, the hockey “Lokomotiv” crashed. The official results of the investigation into the plane crash, which killed 44 people, were announced in October 2014. Deputy General Director of Yak-Service Airlines Vadim Timofeev was found guilty. Immediately after the verdict was announced, he was amnestied. Relatives of the victims believe that the true cause of the tragedy has not yet been established.\n\nThe pilot hit the brakes\n\nThe investigation lasted about a year. According to the findings of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), the aircraft commander or co-pilot unknowingly pressed the brake pedals during the takeoff run, and the speed during the final stage of takeoff was lower than necessary.\n\nList of representatives of HC Lokomotiv killed in the plane crash\n\n1.

Zimin Andrey Valerievich (doctor)\n\n35. Kunnov Evgeniy Gennadievich (masseur)\n\n36. Kuznetsov Vyacheslav Mikhailovich (massage therapist)\n\n37. Piskunov Vladimir Leonidovich (administrator)\n\nSerious shortcomings in the retraining of crew members on the Yak-42 aircraft were indicated as related reasons (in the emergency flight, there was a negative transfer of Yak-40 control skills to the Yak-42 on takeoff, expressed in the incorrect position of the feet on the pedals during the take-off run); lack of control on the part of the airline over the level of crew training; errors and failure to follow technological procedures made by the crew during preparation and calculation of take-off parameters, as well as during the take-off run; uncoordinated, uncoordinated actions of the crew in the final phase of the take-off run.\n\nIn addition, phenobarbital, a sedative drug that is essentially a sleeping pill, was found in the blood of one of the pilots. Flights under the influence of this drug, as well as in the presence of diseases in the co-pilot (problems with sensitivity in the legs), noted based on the results of the analysis of medical documentation, are prohibited by Russian aviation legislation.\n\nThe only defendant in the case was Vadim Timofeev, who was the person in charge who controlled the crew’s admission to the flight. In particular, he was responsible for organizing flight work, maintaining the qualifications of flight personnel, increasing their professional level, conducting training and testing of pilots.\n\nHaving studied all the circumstances and facts that preceded the tragedy, investigators established that it was Timofeev who allowed the crew to fly, who did not have the right to do so, since they had not completed retraining to fly the Yak-42. In addition, the ship's commander's clearance was issued on the basis of falsified documents.\n\nThe accused had previously violated safety rules - he did not monitor the professional training of pilots, regularly recalled them from training events and, despite the unfinished program, illegally allowed them to fly.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the commander who died in the crash had made serious mistakes during other flights. At the same time, according to the Investigative Committee, Timofeev practically did not analyze the data from the flight recorders that recorded these errors, and did not take any measures. In addition, the two pilots and the flight mechanic of the deceased crew were only performing their third flight together.\n\n“The causes of the disaster have not been established”\n\nIn October, Timofeev was sentenced to five years in prison, but was given amnesty in the courtroom. He never admitted his guilt. “I believe that the main cause of the plane crash was a violation of the alignment (position of passengers and luggage - approx. \"Tapes.ru\"). The crew was highly qualified, but the situation was beyond them. I'm not sure that another crew would have handled this situation. The geography of these guys’ flights can be the envy of many professional pilots,” Timofeev said.\n\nTimofeev rejects the explanation of the disaster as an involuntary pressing of the brake. \"I don't believe the pilots slammed on the brakes for that long, and none of the pilots do,\" he says. According to him, the deceased crew was well trained and before the disaster the pilots had flown at least 60 hours on the same plane, making flights to Makhachkala, Tomsk, Riga, Aktyubinsk.\n\nRelatives of those killed in the plane crash also consider Timofeev innocent and petitioned to send the case for further investigation. In September 2015, the mothers of deceased hockey players Artem Yarchuk, Alexander Vasyunov and Ivan Tkachenko announced their intention to seek justice. “The main case of the death of our children has not yet been completed by the Investigative Committee,” said Anzhelika Yarchuk. “We will apply for the appointment of new examinations, since, in our opinion, the causes of the disaster have not been established,” added Lyubov Vasyunova.\n\nThey demanded repeated examinations of the audio conversations of the deceased crew, video recordings at Tunoshna airport on September 7, 2011, examination of the runway in Yaroslavl and the front landing gear of the crashed Yak-42. They also don’t believe in the IAC version of involuntary pressing of the brakes. “So far, the Investigative Committee has not informed us about how the investigation is going and when it may be brought to court,” Yarchuk noted.\n\nThe victims did not receive adequate compensation. In December 2015, the Moscow City Court upheld the amount of insurance compensation for the relatives of the hockey team that died in the plane crash.\n\nThe bulk of the payments came from the Lexgarant insurance company, which insured the aircraft's comprehensive insurance and air carrier liability for approximately $1 million. The amount of payments for each deceased passenger amounted to 2 million rubles.\n\nIn addition, all hockey players were insured against accidents by the SOGAZ insurance company as part of the insurance of the Kontinental Hockey League teams. The total amount of payments under the package exceeded 90.5 million rubles. Additional accident insurance for the players of this team was provided by the UralSib company, the insured amount was 100 thousand rubles for each.\n\nAccording to the results of an independent investigation into the causes of the plane crash, the tragedy was not caused by the actions of one of the pilots, but by design flaws of the crashed airliner and disruptions in the work of the Yak-Service airline. At the request of the relatives of the deceased hockey players and crew members, an analysis of the tragedy was carried out by test pilot, pilot 1st class Vladimir Gerasimov, leading Russian expert on air crashes Valentin Dudin and test pilot 1st class Alexander Akimenkov.\n\nExperts came to the conclusion that the crash was caused by the design and aerodynamic shortcomings of the Yak-42 aircraft. According to experts, one of the pilots could indeed press the brake pedal, but the reason for this should be sought in the imperfect design of the pedals, as well as in the lack of recommendations for the correct position of the pilots’ feet on the pedals of these airliners.\n\nThe authors of the investigation believe that since the pilots managed to lift the plane into the air, then initially there was no catastrophic or even emergency situation. Gerasimov stated that the immediate cause of the disaster was the lack of lateral control of the aircraft, that is, the Yak-42 simply fell on its side in the air.\n\nOn the anniversary of the Lokomotiv plane crash, the site invites our readers to remember the dead hockey players. Everyone has some kind of story. No one will forget that day - September 7, 2011...\n\n“On that day, September 7, 2011, I sat at work and waited all day for the decision of the CDC to disqualify Welliton (the meeting with Akinfeev).\n\nI waited........\n\nSuddenly I receive an email from my former boss: “HC Lokomotiv has died.”\n\nShe ran out into the corridor and ran to his department:\n\n- Kolya, what are you saying?\n\nHe turns the monitor towards me and shows information about the tragedy.\n\nI went into the smoking room all in tears...\n\nFriends saw the tears and said: “Marinka, why are you so upset? Just think, Velika had a disk soldered in. Why cry?\n\nI answer:\n\n- Guys, HC Lokomotiv died. Big has nothing to do with it...”\n\n“An hour before the match, Alexander Medvedev held a press conference, at which the head of the league spoke about the KHL’s plans. Hockey officials and journalists smiled and joked a lot. The beginning of the season is a holiday.\n\nWe went to work. And 10 minutes before the first face-off (16.50 Moscow time), black news appeared on the websites that at 16.02 a plane carrying the Lokomotiv team crashed near Yaroslavl.\n\nOnly those who were at the computers knew about it right away. And even then they didn’t believe it, they stared dumbfounded at the screens. The hockey players started the game. Salavat Yulaev defender Andrey Kuteikin even scored the first goal of the championship, shooting beautifully from the blue line...\n\nBut the information was already spreading around the stadium and began to reach people. Medvedev appeared near the Ufa team’s bench with a pale face. Five minutes before the end of the first period, he entered the ice. He raised his hand to attract the attention of the players, to stop them - the hockey players did not understand what was happening.\n\n“Today a terrible tragedy happened,” said the KHL president, finding it difficult to find words. – A plane carrying Lokomotiv hockey players, administrators and coaches of the club crashed. Of the 37 people, only one survived. We will decide whether to continue the match or not during the break of the hockey match. I ask you to honor the memory of the victims with a minute of silence.\n\nThere was a pause in the stadium. The captain of “Salavat Yulaev” Viktor Kozlov began to cry. The hockey players were taken to the locker rooms...\"\n\nMemory is the main thing we can give now. If you have any personal story about Lokomotiv and the dead players, if you clearly remember that day of September 7, 2011 - those first seconds when you learned this shocking news - share it in the comments.\n\nThis is Lokomotiv Memorial Day.\n\nAnd we will remember.\n\nAccording to preliminary information received, an accident occurred in the area of ​​the Yaroslavl airfield with a Yak-42 aircraft No. RA-42434 of the Yak Service airline; there were fatalities.\n\nIn accordance with Russian air legislation, the Interstate Aviation Committee has formed a commission to investigate the causes and circumstances of this disaster. Chairman of the commission Morozov A.N., Deputy Chairman Kashirsky L.A.\n\nThe commission leaves for the scene of the accident.\n\nSeptember 7, 2011\n\nThe technical commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee continues to work at the site of the accident with the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft of the Yak Service airline, which occurred on September 7, 2011 in the area of ​​the Yaroslavl airfield.\n\nThe main area of ​​work is compiling a map of the scene of the incident and lifting the tail section of the aircraft in order to detect the flight recorders located there, the so-called “black boxes”.\n\nSeptember 8, 2011\n\nAt the scene of the accident with the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft, protected parametric and audio flight information recorders were found.\n\nInspection, autopsy and work to determine the presence of a recording of the accident flight will be carried out in the laboratory of the Interstate Aviation Committee.\n\nThe commission continues to work at the scene of the accident in the area of ​​the Yaroslavl airfield.\n\nSeptember 8, 2011\n\nThe on-board recorders of parametric and sound information discovered at the site of the Yak-42 RA-42434 crash were transferred to the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC).\n\nThe recorders were sent to the IAC laboratory, where they will be inspected, dried, opened, the recorders will be determined, the presence of records of the accident flight will be determined, and the records will be copied for analysis in order to identify the factors and causes of the occurrence and development of the emergency.\n\nSeptember 9, 2011\n\nIn the laboratory of the Interstate Aviation Committee, where the flight recorders (the so-called “black boxes”) of the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft that crashed near the Yaroslavl airfield were delivered at night, they were examined and opened.\n\nThe appearance of the recorders and storage media (magnetic tape) is satisfactory. Magnetic tapes are wet.\n\nAfter the tapes had dried, processing of the existing recordings began.\n\nThere is a recording of the accident flight on media.\n\nSeptember 9, 2011\n\nIn the laboratory of the Interstate Aviation Committee, in order to further carry out work on processing and decoding records of parametric and audio information recorded by the flight recorders of the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft of YakService airlines during the emergency flight, this information was copied.\n\nPre-processing of the recorded parametric information allows us to determine that, before the aircraft took off, the stabilizer was set to the “pitch up” position of 8.7 degrees and the aircraft flaps were set to the take-off position of 20 degrees. The engines were running until the collision with obstacles.\n\nSeptember 12, 2011\n\nThe technical commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) to investigate the crash of the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft with the participation of the Federal Air Transport Agency and the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia has almost completed work on the field stage of the investigation (collection of surviving fragments and assemblies of the aircraft, establishing the location of the accident, collection and analysis flight and technical documentation of the aircraft, airfield and its services and other necessary work).\n\nThe IAC Scientific and Technical Center is completing the processing and decoding of on-board parametric and sound recorders.\n\nFlight, scientific and technical experts were involved in the analysis of available information about the accident flight.\n\nBased on the preliminary results of decoding and analyzing the available data and submitted documentation, it was established:\n\n1. The Yak-42 aircraft, tail number RA-42434, produced in 1993, has a total flight time of about 6500 hours, which is 2 times less than the assigned resource - 12000 hours.\n\n2. The take-off weight of the aircraft was less than the maximum permissible for take-off.\n\n3. According to the parametric recorder, there were about 14 tons of fuel on board, of which 8 tons were refueled at the Yaroslavl airfield (fuel analysis is underway).\n\n4. Before takeoff, the crew checked all aircraft control channels, including the elevator channel. The rudders were deflected as normal.\n\n5. Weather conditions at the airfield, incl. the magnitude of the side wind did not interfere with the flight.\n\n6. The engines were running until the moment of impact with the ground.\n\n7. Before takeoff, the stabilizer and flaps were set to the takeoff position.\n\n8. No one-time commands indicating aircraft failures were recorded on the parametric recorder record. At the same time, the surviving elements of the systems are sent for research to specialized research centers.\n\nThe technical commission does not exclude the possibility of conducting a full-scale experiment on an analogue aircraft.\n\nThe IAC Technical Commission established contact with the aviation accident investigation authorities of those states whose citizens were on board the aircraft - the Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia, Sweden, Latvia and Canada, with which the IAC previously had constant working contacts. State experts may, if necessary and in agreement with the IAC, take part in the investigation of this aviation accident.\n\nThe technical commission continues its work.\n\nSeptember 17, 2011\n\nBased on the results of the field stage of the investigation into the crash of the Yak-42 RA 42434 aircraft in the area of ​​the Yaroslavl airfield and in accordance with the preliminary analysis of the available documentation and decoding data of objective control means, the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) established:\n\nThe take-off weight and balance of the aircraft did not exceed permissible limits.\n\nBefore the start of the take-off run, the flaps were set to 20 degrees (take-off position), the stabilizer was set to 8.7 degrees for pitching up, which corresponds to the calculated alignment of 24-25% of the MAR.\n\nBefore takeoff, the crew checked all aircraft control channels twice, including the elevator channel; the elevator deflected normally. The maximum recorded deflection of the elevator for pitching up is 21 degrees, which corresponds to the structural stop. The last check was performed 1 minute 40 seconds before the start of the takeoff run.\n\nMeteorological conditions at the time of the accident: wind 360 – 3 m/s, visibility 10 km, cloud cover significant stratocumulus lower limit 990 m, temperature +17.8, pressure 747.9 mm Hg. Art., adhesion coefficient 0.6.\n\nThe takeoff was carried out from runway 23. The aircraft was taxied for takeoff along taxiway 5. The distance from taxiway 5 to the entrance end of runway 23 was approximately 300 meters. The total length of the runway is 3000 meters.\n\nThe crew decided to take off at nominal engine operating mode. Preliminary modeling showed that up to a speed of ~165 km/h, the aircraft's acceleration rate corresponded to the actual installed engine thrust.\n\nThe crew began lifting the nose wheel at a speed of approximately 185 km/h. The elevator was deflected to pitch up to 9-10 degrees (approximately half the travel), but the pitch angle did not increase. After 6 seconds, the engines were set to takeoff operation. Subsequently, despite the engines reaching takeoff mode, the rate of speed growth slowed down significantly, which can be explained by the appearance of additional braking force. The actual value of the additional braking force will be determined based on the results of mathematical modeling and a full-scale experiment, which is planned to be carried out on an analogue aircraft at the Flight Research Institute. MM. Gromova. With the participation of the Design Bureau, a flight program for its implementation is being prepared. The surviving elements of the aircraft's braking system have been sent to a specialized institute for research. Research on the brake system began on September 16.\n\nThe maximum speed reached by the aircraft is approximately 230 km/h. Despite the continued deflection of the elevator to pitch up, the aircraft did not lift off onto the runway. According to the accident scene, the actual take-off of the aircraft occurred at a distance of 400 meters behind the exit end of Runway-23 after the elevator was deflected by 13-14 degrees and the stabilizer was adjusted to pitch up to 9.5 degrees. After the aircraft took off from the ground, it collided with the localizer antenna system, as well as an intensive increase in the pitch angle to 20 degrees in 2-3 seconds. The maximum altitude the plane reached was 5-6 meters.\n\nThis was followed by an intense roll of the aircraft to the left and its collision with obstacles and the ground.\n\nBased on the results of laying out fragments of the aircraft, it was established that at the time of the accident the flaps and slats were set to the take-off position, the spoilers were retracted, and the stabilizer was in a pitch-up position of about 10 degrees. Layout of the elevator control wiring showed that there was no wiring disconnection at the time of the accident.\n\nThe technical commission is working through all possible versions of the appearance of additional braking force during the takeoff run and the reasons why the aircraft was unable to lift off from the runway in a timely manner.\n\nIn connection with numerous “versions” appearing in the media about the causes of the accident with the Yak-42D RA-42434 aircraft, with reference to “experts” close to the investigation, the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee states that official information about the investigation is contained only on MAK website. Links to any other sources, publication of unofficial materials and “replication” of various versions about the causes of the accident are contrary to moral and ethical standards, international and Russian rules for investigating aviation accidents.\n\nSeptember 22, 2011\n\nRepresentatives of the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee to investigate the crash of the Yak-42 RA-42434 aircraft conducted a survey of an aviation and radio-electronic equipment engineer who survived the accident. In his opinion, there were no comments on the operation of the aircraft in the previous flight, during preparation for the emergency flight and during the emergency flight. From his words, the actual placement of passengers and luggage was clarified: the team’s management staff and coaches were in the front cabin, the team was in the second cabin, and the bulk of the luggage was loaded into the rear trunk.\n\nOctober 7, 2011\n\nIn accordance with the decision of the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee for the investigation of the Yak-42D crash RA-42434 of JSC Aviation Company YAK SERVICE, specialists of OJSC Irkut Corporation, OJSC OKB im. A.S. Yakovlev\", FSUE \"LII named after. MM. Gromov\" and the State Research Institute of Civil Aviation prepared, agreed upon and approved a full-scale experiment program for reconstructing the emergency take-off of the Yak-42D aircraft on September 07, 2001 at the Tunoshna airport in Yaroslavl.\n\nFlight research will be carried out at the Flight Research Institute. MM. Gromov on an aircraft similar to the Yak-42 RA-42412 with a crew consisting of test pilots from the LII and the OKB named after. A.S. Yakovleva. Work will be carried out to equip the aircraft with additional recording equipment.\n\nDuring the full-scale experiment, it is planned to perform a normal takeoff, repeating the actions of the crew in the emergency flight, but without creating additional braking force. Next, a series of aborted takeoffs will be performed to assess the consistency of the results of mathematical modeling on the occurrence of additional braking force at various stages of the aircraft takeoff and to assess its influence on the creation of a diving moment that prevents the nose wheel from lifting and achieving the takeoff pitch angle, that is, the conditions for the aircraft to take off.\n\nSubject to weather conditions (a dry runway with a friction coefficient of 0.6 and no strong wind is required), work is planned to begin on October 10 this year.\n\nOctober 10, 2011\n\nThe Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee informs that today, during the course of the events that began at the Flight Research Institute named after. MM. Gromov flight research carried out as part of the investigation into the Yak-42D crash RA-42434, the first flight was carried out.\n\nThe purpose of the flight was to replicate the actual actions of the crew on the accident flight, but without subjecting the aircraft to additional braking force.\n\nAfter landing the aircraft, specialists began the initial processing of recorded data from objective monitoring equipment to compare the test and emergency flights.\n\nOctober 20, 2011\n\nThe technical commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee to investigate the crash of the Yak-42D aircraft, no. 42434, which occurred on 09/07/11 in Yaroslavl, guided by the provisions of Appendix 13 to the ICAO Chicago Convention and international practice, draws attention to the inadmissibility of publications and statements of various versions of the cause of this aviation accidents with reference to the materials and work of the Technical Commission or specialized aviation research, flight testing institutes and centers involved in carrying out the necessary research\n\nThe technical commission analyzes aviation accidents, including crashes, of the Yak-42 aircraft over the entire period of its operation. According to the data available to the Technical Commission, during the period of operation of the Yak-42 aircraft there was not a single aviation accident, including a disaster, for reasons related to the ergonomics of the cabin.\n\nDuring the period of operation since 1980, the operating time of the entire fleet of Yak-42 aircraft, which is operated not only in Russia, but also in a number of other countries, amounted to more than 2,346,000 flight hours and 1,230,000 flights.\n\nThe investigation continues, all aspects, facts and circumstances of the Yak-42 plane crash are being considered.\n\nThe IAC Technical Commission considers the above statements as an attempt to exert unacceptable pressure on its work, which is carried out in order to establish the causes and all circumstances of this disaster.\n\nOctober 21, 2011\n\nThe Chairman of the Technical Commission of the Interstate Aviation Committee informs that the necessary stages of work to investigate the crash of the Yak-42D aircraft no. 42434, which occurred on September 7, 2011 in Yaroslavl, have been completed, including:\n\nspecial studies of wheel drums, brakes and braking system units, as well as the technical condition of aircraft tires. According to the conclusion of the FAA State Center for Flight Safety in Air Transport, no failures in the operation of the specified units were identified;\n\nprocessing and analysis of objective control means have been completed, including analysis of the state of engines, on-board systems and equipment of the aircraft, crew actions, identification of crew members’ voices;\n\nmathematical modeling of the emergency flight was performed;\n\nA flight experiment was conducted at the LII named after. MM. Gromov with the participation of experienced test pilots according to a program agreed upon by the State Scientific Research Institute of Civil Aviation and the Flight Research Institute, approved by the Flight Methodology Council of the Flight Research Institute. The data obtained during the experiment confirmed the results of mathematical modeling of the emergency flight;\n\nall submitted documentation for the Yak-Service airline was analyzed, including the organization of flight work, crew training, medical documentation and the results of inspections of the airline by Rostransnadzor and Rosaviation after the accident;\n\nAn analysis of aviation accidents and catastrophes of Yak-42 type aircraft over the entire period of their operation was carried out with the calculation of probabilistic assessments of safety failures of systems and assemblies, etc. According to the data available to the Technical Commission, during the period of operation of the Yak-42 aircraft there was not a single aviation accident, including a disaster, for reasons related to the ergonomics of the cabin.\n\nThe technical commission has all the necessary materials, the results of studies conducted by research institutes and centers, flight and technical experts to establish the systemic and immediate causes, all associated factors and circumstances of this disaster, as well as the development of a set of necessary flight safety measures.\n\nThe work will be completed within the next 2 weeks.\n\nNovember 2, 2011\n\nThe IAC published the results of the investigation into the crash of the Yak-42D RA-42434 aircraft near Yaroslavl, and also held a press conference explaining and commenting on the details of the accident. According to the commission's conclusions, the immediate cause of the disaster was the erroneous actions of the aircraft commander or co-pilot (it was not possible to establish for certain), who involuntarily pressed the brake pedals during the take-off run. This led to the emergence of a diving moment, which did not allow the aircraft to raise its nose wheel at the right time and begin lifting off the runway. Despite the emergency situation, the crew did not attempt to abort the takeoff, but continued to gain speed, setting the engine to takeoff mode, and increasing the rudder angle, trying to lift the aircraft into the air. As a result, the plane rolled off the runway 450 meters and took off from the ground only after the elevator deflection angle was about 13 degrees (twice as much as during a normal takeoff) and the stabilizer was moved to the 10-degree position. From the report on the results of flight experiments it follows that at the moment of lift-off, the force applied to the control column could reach up to 70 kgf, and to create such a force the pilots needed to press their feet even harder on the brake pedals. After lifting off the ground, the diving moment disappeared, the plane reached supercritical angles of attack (the pitch angle increased from 7 to 19 degrees in 2 seconds), rose to a height of 5-6 meters and began to fall to the left. The collision with the ground occurred 120 meters later, almost along the extended axis of the runway.\n\nThe IAC also notes that traces of phenobarbital, which has an inhibitory effect on the central nervous system, were found in the co-pilot’s body. Pilots taking this drug are not allowed to fly. In addition, from the medical documentation it follows that the co-pilot developed polyneuropathic syndrome, which manifests itself in impaired coordination of the legs and control of their spatial position. Flights with this disease are also prohibited.\n\nThe IAC identifies the following factors that contributed to the disaster:\n\nSerious shortcomings in the retraining of crew members for the Yak-42 aircraft, which was not completed in full and with long interruptions. This led to a negative experience in transferring skills when piloting Yak-40 aircraft to the Yak-42, which was expressed in the incorrect position of the feet on the pedals.\n\nLack of control on the part of the airline's flight crew over the actual level of crew training.\n\nErrors and failure to follow technological procedures made by the crew during preparation and calculation of take-off parameters, as well as during the take-off run. In particular, the value of the decision speed was incorrectly stated (190 km/h instead of 210 km/h). Also, the take-off weight, centering, and required take-off distance were not calculated.\n\nUncoordinated, uncoordinated actions of the crew in the final phase of the take-off run. At the moment the plane left the runway and shifted the stabilizer to the position of ~10 degrees, the PIC probably tried to stop the takeoff by tilting the control column away from himself, but after the co-pilot’s phrase: “What are you doing?” returned the steering wheel to its previous position. Almost at the same time, the flight mechanic, probably reacting to the actions of the PIC, but without his command, removed all the throttles to low throttle, but the co-pilot’s reaction immediately followed: “On (tszr) you!” and the “Vzlyotny” PIC team and ores were returned to their previous position. However, due to the throttle response of the engines, takeoff speed was restored only after 6 seconds. All this led to a decrease in speed. IAC notes that the actions of the co-pilot did not correspond to his actual job responsibilities. Essentially, there were two leaders in the crew, with the co-pilot having higher authority.\n\nThe final conclusion of the IAC following the investigation of the plane crash on September 7, 2011\n\nMAK investigation materials\n\nVideo reconstruction of the flight\n\nSpeech by the head of the IAC T. Anodina at the final press conference\n\nLokomotiv was flying to Minsk for a match with local Dynamo, which was supposed to take place on Thursday as part of the first round of the Kontinental Hockey League championship. In total there were 45 people on board. Flight attendant Alexander Sizov and hockey player Alexander Galimov managed to escape. A few hours later, information appeared in the media that Galimov died in intensive care, but this was later refuted by doctors.\n\nForward Alexander Galimov, who survived the plane crash.\n\nThe Yak-42 belonged to the Yak Service airline. The disaster occurred near Tunoshna airport. According to one version, the Yak-42 crashed due to a collision with a lighthouse antenna located outside the runway. For unknown reasons, the aircraft was unable to reach a safe altitude during takeoff, which led to the collision. As a result, the plane broke into two parts, one of which crashed into the Volga.\n\nThe plane crash has already been reported to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who sent the head of the Ministry of Transport, Igor Levitin, to the crash site. Also, the management of FC Lokomotiv, including the general manager of the railway workers, Yuri Lukin, went to the scene of the emergency.\n\nA criminal case has been initiated into the crash under Article 263 of the Criminal Code of Russia - “Violation of air transport safety rules.”\n\nYaroslavl \"Lokomotiv\"- one of the most titled hockey clubs in the modern history of Russia.

The media wrote that he was not on the plane, supposedly Salei was waiting for the team in Minsk. Later, the Ministry of Emergency Situations reported that the hockey player was on the list of dead. The name Salei does not appear in the published lists.\n\nPlane crashes in which athletes died\n\nOne of the most tragic was the plane crash in the sky over Dneprodzerzhinsk on August 11, 1979. On that day, two Tu-134 scheduled passenger aircraft collided. In one of them, the Pakhtakor team flew from Tashkent to the USSR championship match in Minsk. Along with 17 club members, 172 people died in that plane crash.\n\nAnother plane crash claimed the lives of 11 of the most talented CSK Air Force hockey players, their coach, doctor and massage therapist. On January 7, 1950, a Li-2 (Douglas) plane crashed at the Sverdlovsk Koltsovo airport, on which the hockey players flew to Chelyabinsk for a match with the Dzerzhinets team (the current Traktor). Only Vsevolod Bobrov, who was late for the flight, survived. The CSK Air Force team was assembled by Vasily Stalin himself.\n\nOn February 6, 1958, 8 Manchester United football players, 3 team managers, 8 journalists and 2 crew members were killed in a plane crash.\n\nAlready in 2006, as a result of the A310 crash in Irkutsk, the general director of the Moscow hockey club Spartak, Vadim Melkov, died. He was appointed to the position of general director of the club a month before his death.\n\nAs a result of a plane crash in 2011 near Petrozavodsk, FIFA referee Vladimir Pettai died. His last match at the national level as a referee was the hundredth in his career, and he was able to become the 22nd “centurion” of the Russian championships. It was the game of the 13th round of the Russian championship between Rubin and Dynamo.\n\nWhat is the Yak-42\n\nThe Yak-42 is a medium-range three-engine passenger aircraft developed in the USSR in the mid-1970s to replace the Tu-134. The first flight took place in March 1975. Start of operation - December 22, 1980. Produced until 2002. A total of 188 aircraft were produced. Cruising speed - 810 km/h. Flight range - 2900 km. Number of passengers - 120.\n\nToday, the wear and tear of the Russian Yak-42 fleet is approximately 50%, which is much better than that of a number of other Russian aircraft produced in the USSR.\n\nAs of September 7, 2011, 9 Yak-42 aircraft were lost and 562 people died.\n\nPhoto:\n\nEight years have passed since the terrible plane crash in the village of Tunoshna near Yaroslavl. On September 7, 2011, the Yak-42, which in addition to the crew included coaches and players of the Lokomotiv hockey team, crashed during takeoff. But, no matter how difficult it was, that day we carefully followed the emerging information from the scene of the tragedy. A year after the disaster, the chief specialist expert of the Cultural Center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Yaroslavl Region, Alexander Shikhanov (at that time he headed the press service of the regional police) published a chronicle of how that day went for him - he was one of those who were allowed into the place crashes. We are publishing this chronicle today:\n\nSeptember 7, 2011 started out well. On this day, the International Political Forum officially opened in Yaroslavl under the patronage of the President of Russia. Most of the forum participants arrived and flew to Yaroslavl the day before, and already in the morning speeches and discussions by politicians started at Arena-2000. We held a press conference with the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs dedicated to the protection of law and order during the forum, prepared articles in the media, and stories on television. The only thing left to do was to prepare publications about police work directly on the forum. Together with my colleague Anton Smirnov we went to the Arena. We took several photographs of police officers near Arena 2000 and filmed a video. Time flew by quickly.\n\nSomewhere after 14:00 I decided to go to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The weather was beautiful, the sun was shining brightly. Walking along Institutskaya Street up to Moskovsky Prospekt, I met Lokomotiv’s commercial director Evgeny Chuev. We exchanged a few words with him about the forum and about the prospects for Lokomotiv in the beginning season. I remember the feeling of joy and peace that I had then.\n\nThings got busy in the office, as always. Time flies quickly at work. At the beginning of five o'clock the phone rang, which sharply divided this whole day, and life, into before and after.\n\n16:02\n\nThe crash of a Yak-42 plane near Tunoshna airport.\n\nThe correspondent of the NTM TV channel Seryozha Afonichev called. He asked me if it was true that a plane on which Lokomotiv seemed to be flying crashed in Tunoshna. The first reaction is disbelief. Here in Yaroslavl? Did a plane crash? Can't be. And what about with Lokomotiv?! I'm calling the duty desk.\n\n16:09\n\nThe duty unit of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region received a message that a Yak-42 plane crashed during takeoff from Tunoshna airport.\n\nThe duty officer says that a plane actually crashed in Tunoshna. Whether Lokomotiv was there is still unknown. There is no information about casualties in the disaster.\n\n16:15\n\nThe emergency was reported to First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Gorovoy, the leadership of law enforcement agencies in the Yaroslavl region.\n\n16:17\n\nThe emergency incident was reported to the duty station of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nWe decide to go to Tunoshna. We're going with Anton. He's driving, I'm on the phone. There are constant calls. There is no certainty. I am reporting what happened to the public relations department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. I say that there are no details yet, that I will report later.\n\nI’m calling the department of communications and public relations of the regional government. They don't have the information yet either. We are traveling along with several ambulances. We are clearly speeding, but the traffic police officers, who were all along the route from the center to the airport that day, only watched us go.\n\n16:20\n\nThe officer on duty at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in a telephone conversation with the head of the aviation security service, clarifies the circumstances of the crash of the Yak-42 aircraft and the number of passengers and crew members.\n\nThe airport is located three kilometers beyond the village of Tunoshna. We are almost flying through the village when a traffic police inspector slows us down and says that we need to go towards the Volga through the village - the plane crashed there.\n\nWe turn not far from the Tunoshi school and drive deeper into the village, past the church. We stop near some two-story non-residential building. You can’t go any further: there are police officers standing around the area. We take a camera and a camera and walk between some fences and vegetable gardens.\n\n16:25\n\nEmployees of the special forces detachment, private security, dog handlers, and investigative teams were sent to Tunoshna airport.\n\n16:30\n\n20 experts from the forensic department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, an explosion-technical and fire-technical laboratory were sent to the scene of the incident.\n\nThe crash site is a little less than a kilometer away. The paths are narrow and broken. We arrive at the place. I take some photos, Anton takes a video. Rescuers from the Ministry of Emergency Situations are working at the scene of the disaster, and riot police are standing in a cordon. They arrived here from the airport and immediately cordoned off the area.\n\nThe outermost houses of the village are literally 50 meters away. I remember thinking that the falling plane miraculously did not hit the houses. The entire crash site is smoking, plowed up, and debris is strewn everywhere. Some of the fragments lie on the foundation of a house under construction. The tail of the plane is in the water of the Tunoshonka River, and firefighters are still pouring fire on it. A little higher along the shore there are fragments of the bow. Large parts of the aircraft are scattered over about a hundred meters. Closer to the airport, on a hillock you can see a birch tree, literally cut off by the plane’s wing when it fell, and a rickety power line pole, looking like a burnt cross. Under the hillock, in the ravine through which the stream flows to Tunoshonka, there are more fragments.\n\nPhoto: archive of the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region\n\n16:45\n\nA Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs helicopter located in Yaroslavl was lifted into the air.\n\n16:50\n\nSix medical experts, three boats, and additional police squads for the second cordon were sent to the scene.\n\nThe phone rings incessantly. I am beginning to confirm the fact of the disaster. Nothing is known yet about the dead and wounded. On the spot, EMERCOM employees are organizing an operational headquarters, and the head of the main department of the Russian EMERCOM for the Yaroslavl region, General Pavel Baryshev, is already there.\n\nBoats of the Ministry of Emergency Situations and police are moving along Tunoshonka and Volga. Rescuers and law enforcement officers are scurrying among the rubble. The discovered bodies of the dead are taken to a hollow slightly to the side of the fall site. There are about ten people lying there. The bodies are almost undamaged, they only wear underwear and socks - all other clothes (apparently made of synthetics) were burned.\n\nIt's almost physically painful to look at them. It also hurts because without clothes it is clearly visible that all the dead were young men, tall, well-developed, athletic. Faces are unrecognizable under a layer of soot.\n\nHere and there, white Lokomotiv hockey jerseys are visible among the rubble. It seems that they simply flew out of the athletes' bags. But after walking around the scene of the accident a little, I understand that it was the rescuers who covered the remains of the victims with sweaters. Some are severely crippled and burned.\n\nI force myself to push my emotions deep, to detach myself from what I see. Not now. Now it's work.\n\nI understand that journalists will soon arrive at the scene of the disaster. I ask the riot police commanders not to let anyone through the cordon without me. I call up the girls from the department. I say that we confirm the fact of the disaster, but there are no details yet. They say that the phone is ringing off the hook, everyone is waiting for some official message. We agree that they say that a briefing will soon take place, at which the initial version of the disaster will be announced. I know that this needs to be done, and I am ready to convince management that they cannot delay this.\n\nOf course, a plane crash is far from my competence. The Investigative Committee and special commissions will investigate the accident. But it's not that. Lokomotiv is very important for Yaroslavl. After the disaster, various rumors will arise, people may take to the streets, which will lead to unpredictable consequences, especially during an international forum, when there are many foreign delegations in the city. The faster truthful information is conveyed, the fewer rumors there will be, and the easier it will be to maintain law and order. That's pretty much what I thought at the time. That's how I continue to think now.\n\n16:57\n\nFirst Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs A.V. Gorovoy, Head of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl Region N.I. Trifonov arrived at Tunoshna airport. In addition, the Governor of the Yaroslavl Region S.A. Vakhrukov, the head of the Investigative Directorate of the Russian Investigative Committee for the Yaroslavl Region Major General of Justice O.I. Lipatov, the Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Central Federal District O.M. Govorun, the Minister of Transport of the Russian Federation went to the scene of the incident. Federation I. E. Levitin.\n\n17:00\n\nThe emergency situation was reported to the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.\n\nThere are more and more people at the operational headquarters near the disaster site. Representatives of the presidential administration are coming from Arena 2000. No one yet has a complete understanding of what is happening. But the version of a terrorist attack disappears almost immediately. Obviously, the reasons for the accident are different.\n\nOlga Aleksandrovna Lileeva, head of the communications and public relations department of the regional government, arrives with the governor. We step aside with her, and I say that we need to quickly conduct a briefing in order to convey information to people about what is happening through journalists. She promises to talk to the governor.\n\nOn the radio from the border of the cordon, where Anton and I left the car, they report that several television film crews have arrived. Time is compressed, I feel with my whole body that I need to make a decision faster. I am ready to go out to journalists and tell them about what is happening at the scene of the disaster. But still, now it’s not me who should do it.\n\n17:09\n\nThe duty department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Yaroslavl region received information from the main directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia for the Yaroslavl region that 37 people were flying on the plane, and 22 corpses were found.\n\nAt the operational headquarters, after long discussions, they decide that the briefing should be conducted by Governor Sergei Alekseevich Vakhrukov, the highest official of the Yaroslavl region. We agree with Olga Alexandrovna that she will lead the governor outside the inner cordon line, where he will wait for the media right on the road, and Anton and I will bring the journalists.\n\nWe go beyond the stretched red and white signal tapes. A tall man in a dark blue T-shirt stands near the riot police squad and, holding his head with his hands, looks towards the wreckage. Friends of the riot police say that this is Galimov’s father. At the time of the accident, he was at his friends’ dacha near Tunoshna, and upon hearing about the tragedy, he immediately ran here.\n\nWe go to the outer cordon line. While we are walking, we see film crews from Yaroslavl TV channels. Local journalists managed to infiltrate through the still loose outer cordon line and use the gardens to make their way almost to the inner line, which is held by riot police.\n\nI especially remember one journalist, a tall guy who, clumsily crouching, tried to sneak along a rather sparse picket fence unnoticed. On his face, the horror of the realization of the disaster was mixed with almost jackal joy at how close he had gotten to his goal. It was unpleasant to see him.\n\nThey explained that it was better to go out onto the road, where the governor’s briefing would soon be held, and that no one would be allowed into the place right now anyway, because this could interfere with the dismantling of the wreckage and the investigative actions that had already begun.\n\nPhoto: archive of the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region\n\n17:20\n\nTo act at the scene of an emergency situation, a group of forces and assets of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region was deployed - 518 people, 58 units of equipment. In addition, 117 police officers from the Northern Line Directorate of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for Transport were sent to cordon off the area of ​​the plane crash and carry out initial operational and investigative actions. A double cordon of the emergency site was organized, the movement of unauthorized vehicles was excluded, public order was ensured and assistance was provided in carrying out emergency rescue operations.\n\nAt least 60 journalists gathered at the outer cordon line. Many of those who worked at the international forum have already arrived in Tunoshna. Not far, but the topic is so hot that it’s already splashing. Film crews from Japan, Sweden, Poland, Great Britain. There are many Muscovites from almost all leading publications. And, of course, our Yaroslavl newspapermen and photographers.\n\nHe explained that there would now be a briefing by the governor of the Yaroslavl region, at which all the information known at that time would be communicated. In addition, he promised that cameramen and photographers would be able to photograph the crash site at least from a distance (on the way, I spotted a point behind the inner ring of the cordon, from which the tail of the plane lying in the water and part of the shore with the wreckage were visible).\n\nSurprisingly, this is where obstacles began. The police, of course, with my escort, let the journalists through, but an employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations stood in our way as a wall, who certainly wanted his immediate superior to give him the order to let us through. We lost about seven minutes trying to call those who could give orders. Finally they contacted the governor, who asked the head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations to give instructions to let the journalists through.\n\n17:25\n\nRiot police officers (Yaroslavl) secured the morgue where it was planned to place the bodies of the dead.\n\nThey moved along the road in a huge crowd. Looking back, I think it was a rather surreal picture - several dozen well-dressed people (after all, they were at a parquet event - an international political forum) making their way along broken roads among fences and vegetable gardens. I felt like Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt. Especially when we missed the road and had to turn the entire crowd back to the right turn.\n\nWhile we were wasting time on negotiations with the Ministry of Emergency Situations and wandering along the Tunoshino paths, the governor had already made a statement for three Yaroslavl channels. I had to convince him again through Olga Lileeva that it was necessary to tell him again about everything that was known at that moment.\n\nJournalists quickly surrounded Sergei Vakhrukov in a semicircle and began asking questions. Sergei Alekseevich confirmed that the plane carrying Lokomotiv had crashed, that there were 37 passengers on the plane, that rescue operations were underway, that 22 corpses had been found, that the version of a terrorist attack had been practically ruled out, and that the causes of the tragedy were being clarified.\n\nThe briefing took about 7–9 minutes. At the end of it, Anton and I led cameramen and photojournalists to a small cape on the shore of Tunoshonka, from which traces of the accident could be removed without interfering with the work of rescuers and investigators. Almost all the photographs of the disaster that went around the world that day were taken from this very place. There you can see the tail lying in the water, debris on the shore and working specialists.\n\n19:00\n\nInformation has been received about a gathering in the area of ​​Arena 2000 of groups of citizens who are fans of the Lokomotiv hockey club - more than 500 people.\n\n19:05\n\n31 employees of the Uglich department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and 60 riot policemen were redeployed to the Arena-2000 area from the Volzhskaya embankment.\n\nAfter the shooting, Anton and I again led all the journalists outside the cordon in an organized manner. The first, most important information was given.\n\nWe decided to go to Yaroslavl, to the Arena, to assess what was happening there and, if necessary, prepare information for the media. The problem was that Arena 2000, in connection with the international political forum, was cordoned off by employees of the internal affairs bodies and the Federal Security Service, and I was afraid that conflicts might arise there.\n\nOn the way, they stopped at my house and took my wife and son. They also wanted to visit the Arena, where all the Yaroslavl residents rushed with their hearts that evening. We left the car near Institutskaya Street, which was blocked by traffic police. To approach the Arena, you had to go to Gagarin Street. My wife wanted to buy flowers, but there was nothing in the stalls - all the flowers were bought before us. People walked in an endless stream. We walked with them to the Arena. The police removed the turnstiles from Gagarin Street, and the wall of the complex closest to the bus stop spontaneously became a wall of memory.\n\nMountains of flowers, scarves, hockey sweaters, handwritten posters, photographs, burning candles. There are practically no drunks. There are a lot of crying people - men, women. Grief united everyone. I understand from the mood of the fans that there should be no incidents.\n\nWe leave the crowd. My wife and son go home, and Anton and I go to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. We need to create information for our site.\n\nPhoto: archive of the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region\n\n20:00\n\nPreliminary information has been received about the passengers and crew members who were on the plane that crashed (45 people). Two survivors were found at the scene: plane flight engineer Alexander Sizov and Lokomotiv player Alexander Galimov, both were taken to Solovyov Hospital in serious condition.\n\nIn my office, I quickly start writing text for the website. I will update it until the next morning. I check all the known information with the duty officer and with my colleagues from the Ministry of Emergency Situations and write.\n\n20:45\n\nThe removal of the bodies of the victims has begun from the site of the plane crash.\n\nThe first version of the press release appears around nine in the evening. I wrote there everything that was known at that time about the disaster, about the work of the police, expressed condolences on behalf of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the families of the victims and asked fans not to try to enter the scene of the accident, so as not to interfere with the work of rescuers and investigators.\n\nI send information to the public relations department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, and constantly keep in touch with the head of the public relations department.\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs, despite the late hour, is crowded. At about 22:00, First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of Russia Alexander Gorovoy held a meeting with the leadership of the Yaroslavl internal affairs bodies. The discussion was about connecting additional reserves. Significant forces were deployed to maintain law and order at the forum, and after the disaster the operational situation became more complicated.\n\n20:55\n\nInformation was received that the previously gathered group of HC Lokomotiv fans, which had grown to three thousand people, attempted to march through the streets of Yaroslavl.\n\n21:26\n\nA column of Lokomotiv fans - about two thousand people - from Arena 2000 moved along the roadway along Gagarin Street to Moskovsky Prospekt. In order to prevent illegal actions, escort by riot police and police officers was organized, and road safety was ensured by six traffic police squads.\n\nCloser to midnight, I add a paragraph to the text stating that the morgues and the hospital where Alexander Sizov and Alexander Galimov are lying are under guard. I am writing about the procession of fans through Yaroslavl. I am writing that the police understand the grief of people and do not take administrative measures against them, but only ensure order. My task is to make it clear to readers that in this situation (as in most others) the police are together with the people.\n\nAt the same time I receive phone calls. On the recommendation of the Public Relations Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, Channel One correspondents call and ask to arrange for them to broadcast directly from the scene of the accident. We are going to Tunoshna again.\n\nTraffic police officers allow a Channel One car with a “plate” into the village. The cordon there has been strengthened. There is a checkpoint at the building where we left the car during the day. Correspondents from news agencies and photojournalists are also on duty there. We leave the PTS at the cordon and go closer to the scene of the accident: me, Anton, the correspondent and cameraman of Channel One and another Yaroslavl photographer (I thought that the events of that day would never be erased from my memory, but I don’t remember who it was). We illuminate the road with camera light. Compared to what it was during the day, the road is changing before our eyes: gravel is being brought in, turns are being straightened. This is necessary so that heavy equipment can travel to the accident site.\n\nWe reach the inner cordon line. We film a little of the work of investigators and rescuers. It doesn't stop at night either. Near the site, tents are set up and lanterns are placed on masts to illuminate the scene of the disaster.\n\n0:30 September 8\n\nThe correspondent goes live and talks about what is happening behind his back. The broadcast goes smoothly and we return to our cars. It's starting to rain. We say goodbye to the journalists and go to the city.\n\nAfter getting some sleep, I go to work. During the night the situation changed little. Groups of Lokomotiv fans wandered around the city almost until the morning; investigators and rescuers worked at the scene of the disaster.\n\n10:00 September 8\n\nThe bodies of 43 dead passengers and crew members of the crashed plane have been discovered.\n\nThe commander of the Rybinsk OMON Viktor Voronin tells me that his employees were among the first at the scene of the plane crash and took Alexander Galimov to the hospital.\n\nPhoto: archive of the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region\n\nHere is the press release. I present it in the form in which it was published on the website of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on September 8, 2011:\n\n09/07/2011 at about 16.00 hours during takeoff at the Tunoshna airport, located in the Yaroslavl district of the Yaroslavl region near the village of Bechevino, a Yak-42 aircraft belonging to the Yak-Service airline (Moscow) crashed on the Yaroslavl flight -Minsk\", on board which was the main team of the hockey club \"Lokomotiv\" (Yaroslavl) in the amount of 37 people and 8 crew members.\n\nAfter takeoff, the plane, without gaining altitude, tilted, hit the locator and fell to the ground outside the airport in the area of ​​the Tunoshenka River, 200 meters from the confluence with the Volga River. During the fall, an explosion occurred, as a result of which the tail section of the aircraft separated, and the nose section collapsed into small fragments. The tail part fell into the Tunoshenka River, the fragments of the front part are on the shore.\n\nThe first at the scene of the disaster were employees of the special purpose detachment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Yaroslavl region (dislocation in Rybinsk), who were patrolling the glide path zone on a boat. They pulled one victim out of the water. The second was pulled out by transport police.\n\nThe survivors, flight engineer Alexander Sizov, and player of the Lokomotiv hockey club (Yaroslavl) Alexander Galimov, were taken to the hospital. Solovyov, Yaroslavl, in serious condition.\n\nThe First Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Police Lieutenant General A. V. Gorovoy, the Governor of the Yaroslavl Region S. A. Vakhrukov, the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Yaroslavl Region, Police Major General N. I. Trifonov, the Head of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia went to the scene of the incident. for the Yaroslavl Region, Major General P. F. Baryshev, Head of the Investigative Directorate of the Russian Federation for the Yaroslavl Region, Major General of Justice O. I. Lipatov, Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Central Federal District O. M. Govorun, Minister of Transport of the Russian Federation I. E. Levitin.\n\nBased on the fact of the plane crash, the Yaroslavl Transport Investigation Department of the North-Western Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened a criminal case on the grounds of a crime under Part 3 of Art. 263 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation “Violation of traffic safety rules and operation of railway, air or water transport.”\n\nA group of forces and assets of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region in the amount of more than 500 people was involved in actions at the scene of the incident.\n\nPolice officers carried out a double cordon of the emergency site, organized road traffic, excluded the access of outside vehicles to the area where special events were taking place, and ensured public order in full.\n\nAt the scene of the incident, an investigative and operational group of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Yaroslavl Region, operational groups of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia for the Yaroslavl Region, the Investigation Department of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Yaroslavl Region and the prosecutor's office of the Yaroslavl Region worked.\n\nAn Operational Headquarters was created on the basis of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia for the Yaroslavl Region.\n\nPhoto: archive of the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region\n\nThe hospital where the two victims are located, as well as the morgue, are under 24-hour police protection.\n\nThe tragic events that took place caused a great public outcry. In the period from 19.00 o'clock. 07.09. until 01.00 o'clock. On September 8, 2011, groups of young people totaling about 10 thousand people spontaneously gathered in the city of Yaroslavl. The largest number of fans gathered at the Arena-2000-Lokomotiv Sports Complex - more than 5 thousand people, in the Red Square area - 2 thousand people. Subsequently, the fans marched along Moskovsky Prospekt in the direction of Red Square.\n\nThe movement of these groups was accompanied by police officers, who carried out preventive conversations and informed citizens about the planned services on 09/08/2011 in 10 churches in Yaroslavl and the Yaroslavl region. No administrative measures were taken against citizens.\n\nThere were no violations of public order in the regional center or other cities in the region.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl Region expresses condolences to the families and friends of the deceased hockey players of the Lokomotiv team and members of the aircraft crew.\n\nWe ask fans of the hockey club not to try to enter the scene of the plane crash and not to interfere with the work of specialist experts and investigators.\n\nWe are shocked by what happened and mourn together with all the residents of Yaroslavl.\n\nAgain we are going with Anton Smirnov to Tunoshna. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is scheduled to visit the accident site.\n\nAt the scene of the accident, everything is no longer the same as the day before. As far as can be seen from the signal tapes (and the investigators, who took control into their own hands, did not let us in behind them), many of the wreckage had already been removed there, and, of course, there were no bodies of the dead. A small area on the river bank was prepared for laying flowers.\n\nYaroslavl journalists, who had been waiting for several hours near the police cordon, were not allowed in by visiting presidential administration officials. Dmitry Medvedev brought with him his pool of fifteen journalists from central publications. Only they filmed the laying of flowers and wrote about it.\n\nFrom Tunoshna we go to Yaroslavl. We are catching up with the car of the City TV Channel. Both the correspondent and the cameraman sleep in it, tired and on the move.\n\nThe Rossiya TV channel asks us to organize an interview with Rybinsk riot police about yesterday. There is great interest in this. We decide that we will write down the police officers’ story for ourselves, so that we can use it later.\n\nWe are going to the base of the Yaroslavl riot police in the village of Sokol, where Rybinsk residents live. There we meet with Rossiya journalists and together with them we write a 10-minute interview with Dmitry Konoplev and Oleg Smirnov.\n\nHaving returned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, I write a press release about this and post it on the website:\n\nThe names of the police officers who were the first to arrive at the scene of the plane crash in which the Lokomotiv team died and provided first aid to the victims have become known.\n\nPolice lieutenant Dmitry Konoplev and police warrant officer Oleg Smirnov, employees of the special forces detachment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Yaroslavl region (dislocation in Rybinsk) served on the Volga near the Tunoshna airport on a police boat. Their task was to protect the water part of the airport's glide path area.\n\nPhoto: archive of the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region\n\nAt about 4 p.m., police saw a plane trying to take off from the airfield. “He barely got off the ground, caught the locator, went to the left and collapsed behind the trees,” says Dmitry. “We immediately weighed anchor and swam to the crash site. It was no more than 300 meters from us. Oleg steered the boat, and I reported to the management about the disaster. Literally a minute and a half later we were there. Part of the plane lay in the water, the rest was burning on the shore. A man tried to walk to the shore in chest-deep water. At first we decided that it was a fisherman who happened to be at the scene of the accident, but then we realized that it was the victim.”\n\nThe police could not immediately bring the boat to the shore (it was shallow there). They shouted to the man to move a little to the side. At this time, a man in a pilot's uniform appeared from the wreckage of the plane. He tried to pull out another man, also in uniform, by the shoulders. From the direction of the airfield, the vehicles of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, police, and ambulance quickly arrived at the crash site. They took care of the man in uniform. Alexander Sizov was pulled out of the water by transport police.\n\nUN MIA officers returned to the first victim. The man was conscious, speaking and moving confidently, but was badly burned. The police carefully helped him get into the boat. “He was badly burned,” says Dmitry Konoplev, “and we didn’t even know how to help him, but then we grabbed him by the elbows and wrists and dragged him on board. He was very cold and asked to be covered. Having contacted the doctors by phone, we went to Yaroslavl. We talked to him the entire way to prevent him from losing consciousness. He behaved very courageously and adequately assessed what was happening. Just before loading into the ambulance\"we asked his name. “Brothers, I’m Galimov,” he said.”\n\nDmitry Konoplev and Oleg Smirnov have been serving in the internal affairs bodies for about 10 years. During this time, their service included repeated business trips to the North Caucasus, performing difficult tasks in Yaroslavl and other regions of the country. The police do not see anything unusual in their action. “First of all, we must help people,” they say.\n\nSeveral NTV programs, Channel One, Rossiya, the Zvezda channel, and others are asking to film the story. I upload the video to a file hosting service. I send a link to those in Moscow, those in Yaroslavl come for videos with flash drives. I was surprised that different programs from the same channel came to me one after another. They explained that it was easier for them than trying to take a video from another program on their own channel.\n\n9th of September\n\nThe funeral of the deceased members of the Lokomotiv hockey team took place in Yaroslavl. The farewell took place in the Arena. I was there, helping employees of the communications and public relations department of the regional government work with the media. I had to accompany the journalists, resolve issues with the police cordon, and make sure that the correspondents did not go beyond the fence to the relatives of the victims.\n\nThen I accompanied the Russian Minister of Internal Affairs, Rashid Nurgaliev, who, being a big hockey fan, came to Yaroslavl to say goodbye to Lokomotiv.\n\nThe Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Army General Rashid Nurgaliev, took part in the farewell ceremony for the deceased players and employees of the Lokomotiv hockey club.\n\nRashid Gumarovich walked along with the Yaroslavl players along the mourning ice rink and laid flowers at the portraits of hockey players and team personnel.\n\n“The crash of the plane on which Lokomotiv was flying is a tragedy for the entire hockey world,” said R. G. Nurgaliev. “I express my condolences to the relatives and friends of the hockey players, club employees and the crew of the plane.”\n\nAt least 100 thousand people came to the Arena that day. People stood in the rain for hours to walk past the coffins of their favorite players and place flowers on their portraits. I still remember the sea of ​​umbrellas in front of the main entrance of the complex. This is one of the most powerful impressions of my life.\n\nAll the days after the plane crash in Yaroslavl there are gloomy gray skies and rain, nature is crying along with people. It is still impossible to get rid of the feeling of complete unreality of what is happening. I want to wake up... But, unfortunately, this is not a dream... It hurts, irreparably... The bitterness of loss is irreparable.\n\nThere is mourning in Yaroslavl.\n\n10 September\n\nMore than 100 thousand people came to Arena 2000 to say goodbye to the dead.\n\nFrom 8:30, despite the pouring rain, people in an endless stream with flowers went to the Arena to pay their last respects to their loved ones and share grief with the relatives and friends of the victims.\n\nThe farewell ceremony was attended by Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Army General Rashid Nurgaliev, and many other officials and famous athletes. The farewell ceremony had to be extended until 14:30 and still not everyone was able to get into Arena 2000.\n\n14 members of the Lokomotiv team were buried at the Leontyevskoye cemetery. Those who were unable to say goodbye to those killed in the Arena laid flowers on the graves of the athletes.\n\nPhoto: archive of the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region\n\nOn this tragic day, September 10, public order was protected in Yaroslavl by more than 2,500 police officers. Including 30 canine specialists with dogs and more than 500 employees of special forces units.\n\nPhoto: archive of the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Yaroslavl region\n\nThe K-229 helicopter of the special purpose aviation detachment of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for Moscow took part in ensuring law and order. On board the helicopter there is a modern video surveillance system, the image from which is transmitted to the ground in real time. A crew of two people monitors the situation, tracking what is happening in the city.\n\nPolice officers, along with all Yaroslavl residents, are grieving what happened and mourning the death of the hockey players, team personnel and plane crew. These days they tried to support their fellow countrymen. No administrative measures were taken against fans who expressed their feelings on the street.\n\nThere were no violations of public order. The mourning day passed without incident.\n\nOn this sad note I will end the story about September 2011. Sometimes it seems like it was just yesterday, and sometimes it seems like a lot of time has passed since then. Something is remembered, something is forgotten. But we will never forget our guys from Lokomotiv.\n\nIf you notice an error, select a piece of text and press Ctrl+Enter"
