        "text": "In late June, as the NHL draft approached, there was speculation that the Blues might do some wheeling and dealing. As it turned out, the only trade they made was with the New York Rangers for a Russian forward.\n\nThe Blues acquired Evgeny Grachev, the Rangers' third-round pick in 2008, in exchange for a third-round pick in the 2011 draft.\n\nGrachev, now 21, came to North America immediately after his draft, spending one season in the Ontario Hockey League before playing the bulk of the past two seasons in the American Hockey League. In 153 games with the Hartford Wolf Pack in the AHL, he registered 28 goals and 66 points.\n\nGrachev dressed in eight games with the Rangers last season and went pointless with a -3 plus-minus mark. When the trade was made, both the Rangers and Grachev thought that it was time for a change of scenery. So now the 6-foot-4, 225-pound winger is in St. Louis and will be attempting to make the Blues' roster in the upcoming camp.\n\nRecently, Grachev flew back to Russia for the funeral of many friends and ex-teammates who played for Lokomotiv and were killed in a plane crash Sept. 7. Grachev played one game for Lokomotiv in 2007-08 but spent 28 games with the organization at a lower level the previous year. Here's my interview with Evgeny Grachev...\n\nJR: Probably the person most excited to see you here in St. Louis is fellow Russian Nikitin Nikitin, who didn't have anyone to communicate with last year...\n\nEG: \"Yeah, he told me last year he pretty much spent time with his wife (at home) ... then on the road he would go for dinner and just sit there and eat, don't understand much what the guys were talking about. But his English has gotten better, the guys have told me. It's a good to have a Russian guy with you.\"\n\nJR: How did you make the transition to North America so smoothly, especially learning to speak English so well?\n\nEG: \"I learned English when I was about 4 years old, but it was just pronunciation. Then in school, it was words. Here, I've just tried to pick it up. My first year in Juniors, I didn't talk much. But you have to make an effort to learn the language. I watched cartoons or some TV shows. I messed up the words and guys made fun of me, but they helped me a lot. The last two years, I've been pretty comfortable with my English. It's not perfect, but I get along with it.\"\n\nJR: You're a big guy and get a lot of fans excited because of your size. When did you begin to notice that you were bigger than most players and would be able to use it to your advantage?\n\nEG: \"Growing up, I was always the tallest guy on the team. Now the game is so much faster, with all the (rule) changes. Now it doesn't matter what your size is. It's about how quick you can skate, how fast, and changing direction. But yes, if you're big and you can skate, it's an advantage. I'm trying to use it to protect the puck in the corners and drive the net. I can't say I'm a big hitter, but for sure, if there's an opportunity to finish a check, I'm sure I'll do that.\"\n\nJR: When you found out about the trade, did you feel like it was the best thing for your career, getting a new change of scenery?\n\nEG: \"Yeah, I think so. I've been part of the Rangers' organization for three years. I guess it didn't work out for me the way I would have wanted it to be. But they drafted me and I just want to thank them for the opportunity they gave me. I'm just going to move on and hopefully be a part of this team. I don't think (the Blues traded for) me just as an AHL trade. So hopefully they have some expectations for me and I expect they're going to give me a shot in training camp and see what happens.\"\n\nJR: You just returned from Yaroslavl, where you played earlier in your career and knew so many people that were killed in the plane crash. What were your emotions, returning for the funeral?\n\nEG: \"I had a lot of friends on that plane. I thought I'd go back and support the families and say goodbye to all of those guys that were on the plane. I knew all the trainers and half of the team ... three or four were my good friends and one guy (Artem Yarchuk) was my best friend in the hockey world. We played together since we were 13. It wasn't fun. The city was dead for a few days. People wouldn't smile. There was no music in the restaurants. It changed a lot in the city. They don't have a team anymore. It's something you don't want to experience in your life. I can't even explain the emotions...\"\n\nGet in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
