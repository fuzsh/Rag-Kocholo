        "text": "One year ago today, the unthinkable happened.\n\nOn Wednesday, September 7, 2011 at 16:05 Moscow Time, a YAK-42 carrying the 37 players and staff of the Yaroslavl Lokomotiv KHL hockey team struck a beacon tower shortly after liftoff. Upon striking the tower, the plane sputtered a few hundred meters before crashing and bursting into flames on the banks of the Tunosha River. The plane was departing the Yaroslav airport on its way to Minsk, Belarus for the commencement of the KHL season.\n\nOnly one member of the flight crew survived.\n\nIt was an incident that shocked the league. It shocked the nation. And it shocked international hockey fans to the core.\n\nToday, we take a moment to honor the lives of those who were lost in the accident.\n\nSoon after the event, Lokomotiv was in an unfamiliar situation, unsure if they would compete during the 2011-12 season. They were inundated by offers from opposing clubs and players, willing loan their rites to Lokomotiv should they choose to participate in regular season play. In the end, it was decided the best tact would be to honour those who perished by forgoing their KHL season.\n\nIn August 2012, the Russian Hockey Federation along with Hockey Canada collaborated on the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the '72 Summit Series, creating the Canada Russia Challenge which featured prominent junior hockey players from both nations.\n\nRussia was on board, provided Yaroslavl would host Russia's home games.\n\nHere began the healing process.\n\nFor families and friends of the deceased, nothing truly heals the emotions of losing a loved one other than time. For fans, the love and passion for sport can often be a release where people can unite in grief and mourning and share in the healing process that comes thereafter.\n\nStep two of said process took place yesterday, when fans packed the Arena 2000 in Yaroslavl to witness the rebirth of their beloved Lokomotiv squad.\n\nThey defeated Sibir Novosibirsk by a final score of 5-2 for their first home win in over a year.\n\nThere are some notable names on this years Lokomotiv roster. Former Winnipeg Jets defenseman Mark Flood signed with the team this summer, as did notable NHLers Sami Lepisto, Curtis Sanford and Nicklas Hagman. Viktor Kozlov has played in Ufa the past three seasons since leaving the NHL and he too has signed with Lokomotiv.\n\nAs time continues to heal the wounds which marked us one year ago, we still must take pause — at least for a moment — to remember one of the greatest hockey tragedies known to mankind.\n\nHere is a list of those we mourn.\n\nForever in our hearts.\n\nPlayers\n\nVitaly Anikeyenko – 24 – Defenseman\n\nMikahil Baladin – 31 – Defenseman\n\nGennady Churilov – 24- Centre\n\nPavol Demitra – 36 – Centre\n\nRobert Dietrich – 25 – Defenseman\n\nAlexander Galimov – 26 – Left Wing\n\nMarat Kalimulin – 23 – Defenseman\n\nAlexander Kalyanin – 23 – Right Wing\n\nAndrei Kiryukhin – 24 – Right Wing\n\nNikita Klyukin – 21 – Centre\n\nStefan Liv – 30 – Goaltender\n\nJan Marek – 31 – Centre\n\nSergei Ostapchuk – 21 – Left Wing\n\nKarel Rachunek – 32- Defenseman\n\nRuslan Salei – 36 – Defenseman\n\nMaxim Shuvalov – 18 – Defenseman\n\nKarlis Skrastins – 37 – Defenseman\n\nPavel Snurnitsyn – 19 – Forward\n\nDanill Sobchenko – 20 – Centre\n\nIvan Tkachenko – 31 – Left Wing\n\nPavel Trakhanov – 33 – Defenseman\n\nYuri Urychev – 20 – Russia\n\nJosef Vasicek – 30 – Centre\n\nAlexander Vasyunov – 23 – Left Wing\n\nAlexander Vyukhin – 38 – Goaltender\n\nArtem Yarchuk – 21 – Left Wing\n\nCoaches\n\nBrad McCrimmon – Head Coach\n\nAlexander Karpovtsev – Assistant Coach\n\nIgor Korolev – Assistant Coach\n\nYuri Bakhvalov – Physician\n\nAleksandr Belyaev – Equipment Manager\n\nNikolai Krivonosov – Fitness Coach\n\nYevgeni Kunnov – Massage Therapist\n\nVyacheslav Kuznetsov – Massage Therapist\n\nVladimir Piskunov – Administrator\n\nYevgeni Sidorov – Coach/Analyst\n\nAndrei Zimin – Team Doctor"
