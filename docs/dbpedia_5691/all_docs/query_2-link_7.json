        "text": "The 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash occurred on September 7, 2011, at 16:02 local time, when a Yak-Service Yakovlev Yak-42 passenger aircraft, carrying the professional ice hockey team and coaching staff of Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), crashed near Yaroslavl, Russia. The team was on its way to Minsk, Belarus to start the 2011–12 KHL season.[1][2]\n\nAll players from the main roster plus four from the youth team were on board the aircraft, which caught fire and crashed shortly after take-off, 2.5 km from Tunoshna Airport. Preliminary reports say that all but two people who were on board are confirmed dead.[3]\n\nPlayers on board were from Russia, Belarus, Latvia, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine and Sweden. Despite earlier reports it appears defenseman Ruslan Salei was in fact not on the flight as he took and earlier flight to Belarus, seperate from the rest of the team. </ref>Russian jet carrying hockey team crashes (English).

Retrieved on 2011-09-07.</ref> On September 12, Alexander Galimov, despite continuing therapy using all possible contemporary treatment, passed away.[4]\n\nAircraft[]\n\nThe aircraft, a Yakovlev Yak-42D, construction number 4520421301017, was first flown by Tatarstan Airlines in 1993, and was later sold to charter airline Yak-Service, who was the operator of the plane when it crashed. The aircraft, whilst being operated by Tatarstan Airlines, had been banned from making flights to the European Community in 2009, following airworthiness and air safety concerns.[5]\n\nAccident[]\n\nThe Yak-Service aircraft struck a tower mast at Tunoshna Airport as it was taking off. The plane then listed to the right and crashed into the Volga River beyond the airport, catching fire.\n\nRussian President Dmitry Medvedev, who had been on his way to Yaroslavl for the Global Policy Forum, sent his condolences to the families of those killed in the crash,[6] and will visit the crash site.[1]\n\nUpon hearing the news, KHL officials stopped and postponed the Salavat Yulaev Ufa–Atlant Moscow Oblast game already in progress.[7]\n\nInvestigation[]\n\nThe Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK), in accordance with Russian legislation, have opened an investigation into the circumstances and causes of the accident.[8]\n\nPeople on board[]\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the aircraft manifest saw 8 crew members and 37 passengers being listed as being present on the flight, including:[9]\n\nHockey players killed[]\n\nTwenty-six players of the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl ice hockey team were killed:[10]\n\nPlayer Age Country Position Vitali Anikienko[lower-alpha 1] 24 Russia D Mikhail Balandin 31 Russia D Gennady Churilov 24 Russia C Pavol Demitra 36 Slovakia C Robert Dietrich 25 Germany D Alexander Galimov[12][13] 26 Russia LW Marat Kalimulin 23 Russia D Alexander Kalyanin 23 Russia RW Andrei Kiryukhin 24 Russia RW Nikita Klyukin 21 Russia C Stefan Liv 30 Sweden G Jan Marek 31 Czech Republic C Sergei Ostapchuk 21 Belarus LW Karel Rachůnek 32 Czech Republic D Ruslan Salei[14] 36 Belarus D Maxim Shuvalov 18 Russia D Kārlis Skrastiņš[15] 37 Latvia D Pavel Snurnitsyn 19 Russia F Daniil Sobchenko[lower-alpha 1] 20 Russia C Ivan Tkachenko 31 Russia LW Pavel Trakhanov 33 Russia D Yuri Urychev[lower-alpha 2] 20 Russia D Josef Vašíček 30 Czech Republic C Alexander Vasyunov[17] 23 Russia LW Alexander Vyukhin[lower-alpha 1] 38 Ukraine G Artem Yarchuk 21 Russia LW\n\nTeam staff[]\n\nHead coach Brad McCrimmon, 52 (Canada)[18] (1989 Stanley Cup champion)\n\nAssistant coach Alexander Karpovtsev, 41 (Russia)[19] (1994 Stanley Cup champion)\n\nAssistant coach Igor Korolev, 41 (Russia)[19]\n\nYuri Bakhvalov, video operator\n\nAleksandr Belyayev, equipment manager/massage therapist\n\nNikolai Krivonosov, fitness coach\n\nYevgeni Kunnov, massage therapist\n\nVyacheslav Kuznetsov, massage therapist\n\nVladimir Piskunov, administrator\n\nYevgeni Sidorov, coach-analyst\n\nAndrei Zimin, team doctor\n\nFlight crew[]\n\nAndrei Solomentsev — pilot\n\nIgor Zhivelov — copilot\n\nNadezhda Maksumova — flight attendant\n\nVladimir Matyushin — flight engineer\n\nElena Sarmatova — flight attendant\n\nElena Shavina — flight attendant\n\nSergey Zhuravlev — mechanic\n\nAlexander Sizov — flight engineer – survived[20]\n\nReferences[]\n\nThis page uses content from Wikipedia.
