        "text": "Two years ago this morning many of us woke up to the stunning news that the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey team out of the Kontinental Hockey League was involved in a plane crash, amongst the 45 players, coaches, trainers, and airline staff on board only 1 survived – a flight engineer.\n\nNaturally what made this airline crash so much more impactful amongst the general populace compared to other aviation incidents was we were so familiar with many of those who died that day. Growing up, following, cheering on these players for years and years and suddenly many of them were gone in an instant.\n\nI too had memories of watching several of these players over the years, going through my archives I found photos I took at hockey games of some of those who died that day: Ruslan Salei, Stefan Liv, Karel Rachunek, Brad McCrimmon to name a few. I got the chance to meet accident victim Igor Korolev about ten years before his death at an autograph signing and he was nice enough to pose for a photo with me (even though the autograph warden protested quite loudly as they’re known to do):\n\nThe tributes on this side of the Atlantic that poured in were plentiful, every NHL team held a moment of silence before their first games played after the accident. Some teams held special pre-game ceremonies once the season began to honour former players who had died, inviting family members down to ice level to let them share their memories and show their appreciation for the support from the team and fans.\n\nBelow is a collection of photos showing the various patches and helmet decals teams in the NHL, AHL, and KHL wore in memory of those who lost their lives that day, September 7, 2011.\n\nIn a non-uniform related tribute, the Kontinental League renamed their annual Opening Cup trophy as the Lokomotiv Cup – a game played between the previous seasons champion and runner-up.\n\nAs for Lokomotiv, they were forced to suspend their 2011-12 KHL season. The team re-joined the league for the 2012-13 season and finished a respectable 4th out of 14 teams in the KHL’s Western Conference. Good for them.\n\nA full list of those who died in the crash (former NHL players in bold):\n\nPlayers\n\nVitaly Anikeyenko, 24\n\nMikhail Balandin, 31\n\nGennady Churilov, 24\n\nPavol Demitra, 36\n\nRobert Dietrich, 25\n\nAlexander Galimov, 26\n\nMarat Kalimulin, 23\n\nAlexander Kalyanin, 23\n\nAndrei Kiryukhin, 24\n\nNikita Klyukin, 21\n\nStefan Liv, 30\n\nJan Marek, 31\n\nSergei Ostapchuk, 21\n\nKarel Rachůnek, 32\n\nRuslan Salei, 36\n\nMaxim Shuvalov, 18\n\nKārlis Skrastiņš, 37\n\nPavel Snurnitsyn, 19\n\nDaniil Sobchenko, 20\n\nIvan Tkachenko, 31\n\nPavel Trakhanov, 33\n\nYuri Urychev, 20\n\nJosef Vašíček, 30\n\nAlexander Vasyunov, 23\n\nAlexander Vyukhin, 38\n\nArtem Yarchuk, 21\n\nCoaches/Team Staff\n\nYuri Bakhvalov, Physician/Massage Therapist\n\nAleksandr Belyaev, Equipment Manager/Massage Therapist\n\nAlexander Karpovtsev, Assistant Coach\n\nIgor Korolev, Assistant Coach\n\nNikolai Krivonosov, Fitness Coach\n\nYevgeni Kunnov, Massage Therapist\n\nVyacheslav Kuznetsov, Massage Therapist\n\nBrad McCrimmon, Head Coach\n\nVladimir Piskunov, Administrator\n\nYevgeni Sidorov, Coach-Analyst\n\nAndrei Zimin, Team Doctor"
