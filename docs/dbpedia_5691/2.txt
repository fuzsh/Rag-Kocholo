It was exactly one year ago today when a plane carrying the KHL team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl crashed, taking the lives of everyone on board. Please take a moment out of your day to think about the victims and their families and send a prayer their way. I know theyâ€™re looking down on us from their ice rink in the sky. We love you boys!
