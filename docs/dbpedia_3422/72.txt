Queen of the night (Peniocereus greggii) is a desert cactus native to Texas, Arizona and northern Mexico. Its nickname evokes its elite status, a result of its beautiful, night-blooming, fragrant white flower. The flower is rarely seen in the wild, however, because it only survives for a few hours.

Queen of the night is also known by a variety of vernacular or common names. One of the most common names encountered is night-blooming cereus, a reference to the genera to which the plant belongs. Similarly, due to its habitat and flowering habit, it is sometimes called desert night-blooming cereus or Arizona queen of the night. The name Reina de la Noche, which is simply Spanish for “queen of the night,” is also used.
