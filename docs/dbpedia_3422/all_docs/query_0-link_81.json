        "text": "Tonight (Tuesday) is the annual “National Night Out,” or “Night to Unite,” throughout Wright County, and across the country.\n\nNo matter the name, tonight is the night where neighborhoods are encouraged to gather together to strengthen neighborhood bonds, in order to watch out for one another in neighborhood safety and policing programs.\n\nEstablished in 1984 by the U-S Department of Justice, the night is also designed to build a partnership between communities and law enforcement – putting names and faces to the men and women who police the streets and the communities they serve. According to DOJ estimates, more than 40 million people and 15,000 law enforcement agencies take part nationally.\n\nAmong the events in our area, the City of Buffalo and the Buffalo Police Department will visit a number of block parties and other gatherings throughout the evening, and in Monticello, a community cookout is planned at the St. Peter’s Lutheran Church.\n\nMost all communities and some townships in our area will mark “National Night Out.” Check with your local community for details on the many events that are scheduled."
