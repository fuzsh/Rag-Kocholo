        "text": "Every great work done and milestone achieved by an employee deserves the utmost appreciation and respect. And nothing is better than giving out creative employee award titles for extending your gratitude.\n\nIn this blog, I'll discuss the importance of employee awards and their types. Also, I’ll be sharing some example creative award titles which are meaningful as well that you can consider.\n\nLet’s begin!\n\nGiving out a lucrative salary package may attract some really good and talented employees to work for you. Having such employees by your side may make you believe that everything is on track. Initially, it is true; everyone is working hard, punctual, disciplined, and most essentially motivated.\n\nHowever, the same qualities of those employees and their level of motivation often tend to fade away in the long run. And the sole reason for this is none other than disengagement at work.\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll, actively disengaged employees cause U.S. companies between $450 – $550 billion in lost productivity per year.\n\nA disengaged workforce is the direct result of poor employee engagement practices followed by employers at their workplaces.\n\nHowever, adopting good employee engagement policies make sure that the employees stay engaged and motivated. Moreover, it also helps to bring down the employee turnover rates, workplace dissatisfaction and at the same time strengthen workplace relationships.\n\nThough there are many elements and ways for practicing employee engagement. One among them is bestowing your employees with awards and titles every time they achieve a milestone or complete a challenge.\n\nImportance of Employee Awards Titles\n\nModern-day employees can seldom say they had an easy day. With the ever-increasing workload, the level of efforts and hardships endured at the job are also rising. And these hardships deserve appreciation more than anything.\n\nThis is where the need for \"Employee Award Titles\" or hosting “Employee Award Programs” comes into the picture.\n\nEmployee award titles are the formal or sometimes creative terms that employers bestow on their employees who outperform the workforce.\n\nThese titles convey what the employee has achieved and carries the message of motivation for the other team members. Likewise, it also makes the employee stand out from the rest of the workforce as someone who is diligent and has done their job with dedication.\n\nMoreover, giving out employee awards is an integral part of employee recognition programs. These awards are often given out at the end of the month or a year based on the employer's convenience.\n\nHere are 3 Types of Employee Award Titles along with examples\n\nPERFORMANCE AWARDS\n\nPerformance awards are primarily based on an employees' efficiency in the workplace.\n\nMost employee recognition awards given out by employers are based on their employees' overall performance.\n\nEvery time you acknowledge an employee for their efforts, it raises the bar for others to achieve. Thus, promoting healthy competition within the workplace.\n\nAlso Read: 41 Perfect Christmas Gifts for Employees You Can Give This Year\n\nRecognizing employees based on their performance is also the fairest way to acknowledge their efforts.
