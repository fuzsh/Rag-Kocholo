I know he only married her for political reasons, but I totally hate that he is married with other woman and the fl is the concubine, so i wanted to know what happens in the end, he divorces the other woman and ONLY marry the FL with no concubine or second wife? Or he is still married in the end to the other woman and FL is his second wife or something like that?"
