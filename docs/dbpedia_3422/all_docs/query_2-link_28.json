        "text": "Jet lag affects people when they travel by air across multiple time zones. With jet lag, you may not feel well overall and you may have disturbed sleep, daytime tiredness, impaired functioning, and digestive problems.\n\nResearch suggests that melatonin supplements may help with jet lag. This is based on medium-sized reviews from 2010 and 2014.\n\nFour studies that included a total of 142 travelers showed that melatonin may be better than a placebo (an inactive substance) in reducing overall symptoms of jet lag after eastward flights. Another study of 234 travelers on eastward flights looked at only sleep quality and found low-quality evidence that melatonin may be better than placebo for improving sleep quality.\n\nTwo studies that included a total of 90 travelers showed that melatonin may be better than a placebo in reducing symptoms of jet lag after westward flights.\n\nPeople with DSWPD have trouble falling asleep at the usual times and waking up in the morning. They typically have difficulty getting to sleep before 2 to 6 a.m. and would prefer to wake up between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.\n\nMelatonin supplements appear to help with sleep in people with DSWPD, but itâs uncertain whether the benefits outweigh the possible harms. This is based on a clinical practice guideline, a small review, and a more recent study.\n\nIn 2015, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommended melatonin supplements given at specific times for DSWPD. The recommendation was a weak one, and it came with uncertainty about whether the benefits of melatonin outweigh its potential harms.\n\nA 2016 review that looked at a small number of people (52) from two studies showed that melatonin supplements reduced the time it took for people with DSWPD to fall asleep when compared to placebo. On average, it took about 22 minutes less for them to fall asleep.\n\nA 2018 randomized controlled trial that lasted 4 weeks and included 307 people with DSWPD found that taking melatonin 1 hour before the desired bedtime combined with going to bed at a set time led to several improvements. Those improvements included falling asleep an average of 34 minutes earlier, better sleep during the first third of the night, and better daytime functioning.\n\nSleep problems in children can have undesirable effects on their behavior, daytime functioning, and quality of life. Children with certain conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are more prone to sleep problems than other children.\n\nThere are no overall guidelines on the best approach to improving sleep in children. However, guidelines for specific conditions recommend behavioral treatments, such as good bedtime habits and parent education, as an initial treatment that may be supplemented with medicines.\n\nA 2019 review looked at 18 studies of melatonin supplements that included a total of 1,021 children. Most of the studies were small, and all were relatively brief (1 to 13 weeks). Overall, the studies showed that melatonin was better than placebo for improving both the time to fall asleep and total sleep. The effects of melatonin on behavior and daytime functioning, however, werenât clear because the studies used different ways to measure these outcomes.\n\nThe list below shows the reviewâs results on melatoninâs short-term effects for children with specific conditions.\n\nChildren with ASD fell asleep 37 minutes earlier and slept 48 minutes longer.\n\nChildren with ADHD fell asleep 20 minutes earlier and slept 33 minutes longer.\n\nChildren with atopic dermatitis fell asleep 6.8 minutes earlier and slept 35 minutes longer.\n\nChildren with chronic sleep-onset insomnia fell asleep 24 minutes earlier and slept 25 minutes longer.\n\nBecause there arenât many studies on children and melatonin supplements, there is a lot we donât know about the use of melatonin in children. For example, there are uncertainties about what dose to use and when to give it, the effects of melatonin use over long periods of time, and whether melatoninâs benefits outweigh its possible risks. Because melatonin is a hormone, itâs possible that melatonin supplements could affect hormonal development, including puberty, menstrual cycles, and overproduction of the hormone prolactin, but we donât know for sure.\n\nBecause of these uncertainties, itâs best to work with a health care provider if youâre considering giving a child melatonin for sleep problems."
