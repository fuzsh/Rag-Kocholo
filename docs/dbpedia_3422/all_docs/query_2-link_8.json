        "text": "It’s tempting to wonder about all the sights and experiences that have been made under the midnight sun through the ages – by people who lived off the sea in the Lofoten and Vesterålen archipelagos, or the Sami reindeer herders of the far north.\n\nThe phenomenon has at least made a lasting impression on several Norwegian artists and writers. This excerpt is from Knut Hamsun’s Pan (1894): “Night was coming on again; the sun just dipped into the sea and rose again, red, refreshed, as if it had been down to drink. I could feel more strangely on those nights than anyone would believe.”\n\nTravel to the areas above the Arctic Circle in Norway and live these moments yourself. Doing a whale safari or exploring the wilderness inland takes on a new dimension at night in the summer months, when you literally get to see the nature and wildlife in a different light.\n\nIf you’re not afraid of the sometimes chilly summer nights in the north, you could try a midnight swim or pitch your tent in the wild. Many sights and activities are open at night during these weeks’ endless days, so you can go midnight golfing, cycling, river paddling, or sea kayaking – or maybe just find a quiet spot to fish.\n\nIf you travel to the Arctic islands of Svalbard, the sun stays up from April to late August. Here, you can do a midnight hike on a glacier (with a guide, of course) or watch the reddish sky from a moving dog sledge in the unique climate and nature near the North Pole.\n\nFind more activities under the midnight sun.\n\nWhere to find the midnight sun\n\n76 days of midnight sun between May and July greets travelers in Northern Norway. The further north you go, the more nights of midnight sun you get.\n\nDuring the summer months, you can experience up to 24 hours of sunlight above the Arctic Circle, which means more time to enjoy the sights and make new discoveries. When you plan your midnight sun adventure, think of Northern Norway as divided into six main areas as you travel north.\n\nHelgeland\n\nThe southernmost part of Northern Norway is called Helgeland and is situated just below the Arctic Circle. The whole area is an undiscovered gem. Follow the Kystriksveien Coastal Route, rated as one of the most beautiful road trips in the world, to secret white beach coves, small towns like Brønnøysund and Mosjøen, and wonderful hikes in mountain ranges like De syv søstre and Okstindan. Bring your bike on the local ferries and go island hopping between small islands like Træna, Lovund, and Myken – no car needed.\n\nBodø and Salten\n\nThe Coastal Route continues across the Arctic Circle into the region of Salten, and all the way to Bodø. Not only is the city a major transport hub – Bodø is also an interesting place to explore in itself. Check out exiting museums, marvel at the world’s strongest maelstrom Saltstraumen, travel back in time in Norway’s best-preserved seaside trading post at Kjerringøy, and hike the Børvasstindan mountain range. Then, you can jump on a boat to explore the magical islands of Salten, like Steigen, Hamarøy, Støtt, Bolga, and Rødøy. A visit to the Svartisen glacier just south of Bodø is also a must.\n\nLofoten and Vesterålen\n\nIf you travel on to the northwest across the sea, you will reach the islands of Lofoten and Vesterålen – areas of outstanding natural beauty characterized by dramatic, rocky peaks that rise up from the sea and coastal flatlands where sheep graze. The landscape is also dotted by beautiful white beaches and picturesque fishing villages. Experience the Viking culture at Lofotr Viking Museum, go on a day cruise to the extremely narrow Trollfjord (you will probably spot Sea eagles on the voyage), and join a whale safari from Andenes.\n\nTroms\n\nThe vibrant city of Tromsø in Troms county is often called “the Paris of the north” and has sun around the clock for a whole month. The midnight sun experience might be even better on the dramatic islands of Senja, Ringvassøya, Kvaløya, though. Or why not travel to tiny Sommarøy, where the locals want to introduce a “time-free zone” during summer – as there is daylight at all hours, people don’t abide by the clock anyway (this goes for all of Northern Norway in the summer, really). The alpine Lyngenfjord region close to Tromsø is a paradise for hiking, fishing, and cycling in the middle of the bright night.\n\nFinnmark\n\nThis is the furthest north you can get in mainland Norway. Midnight sun chasers usually head to the North Cape, the northernmost point you can drive to in Europe. But Finnmark county, the kingdom of the king crab, is a massive area with plenty of untouched nature. Along the coast, you can explore glaciers, fjords, and large islands such as Sørøya and Seiland. In the far east, the Varanger area is known for its world-class birdwatching. Inland, you can travel across Finnmarksvidda, which is Norway’s largest mountain plateau and inhabited by far more reindeer than people. This is also the cradle of the Sami culture, which is especially visible in Karasjok and Kautokeino.\n\nSvalbard\n\nHalfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole, you’ll find the Svalbard Islands where the polar bears reside. Here, you can really talk about an endless day – the sun patrols the sky in almost uniform circles all summer. From the modern town Longyearbyen, which offers a wide range of cultural activities, restaurants, and bars, you can venture into the wild (always with an armed guide) to explore the islands’ Arctic nature, rich wildlife, and old mining towns."
