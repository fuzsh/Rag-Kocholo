        "text": "BOTTOM\n\nThat will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms. I will condole in some measure. To the rest. Yet my chief humor is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in to make all split. The raging rocks And shivering shocks Shall break the locks Of prison gates. And Phoebus' car Shall shine from far And make and mar The foolish Fates. This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant’s vein. A lover is more condoling.\n\nBOTTOM\n\nThat role will require some tears from me if I am to perform it well. If I perform it, the audience better check their own eyes. I’ll make tears fall like rainstorms. I’ll make them weep. I'll express grief—just the right amount of grief, of course. Okay, now list the other actors. But, actually, my first choice would be to play a tyrant. I'd make a wonderful Hercules, or any other part that requires ranting and raving that will bring the house down.\n\nThe raging rocks\n\nAnd shivering shocks\n\nWill break the locks\n\nOf prison gates.\n\nAnd Phoebus' cart\n\nWill shine from afar\n\nAnd make and mar\n\nThe foolish Fates.\n\nThat was high art! Now say who the other actors are. That speech was in the style of Hercules, the tyrant's style. A lover would be more weepy.\n\nBOTTOM\n\nLet me play the lion too. I will roar, that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar, that I will make the duke say, “Let him roar again. Let him roar again.”\n\nBOTTOM\n\nI grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us. But I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove. I will roaryou an ’twere any nightingale.\n\nQUINCE\n\nSome of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play barefaced. But masters, here are yourparts. And I am to entreat you, request you, and desireyou to con them by tomorrow night and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight. There will we rehearse, for if we meet in the city we shall be dogged with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not.\n\nQUINCE\n\nSome French heads have no hair at all, so maybe you could play the role clean-shaven. But, gentlemen, here are your scripts. I beg you, ask you, and desire you to please learn your lines by tomorrow night. Then meet me by moonlight in the duke’s forest a mile outside of town. There we will rehearse, because if we do it in the city, we’ll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know what we're going to perform. In the meantime, I’ll make a list of props that we’ll need for the play. Now, I beg you, don't miss the rehearsal."
