        "text": "Day and Night\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day. The day is divided into day(time) and night(-time). Daytime is from sunrise (this varies, but we can say approximately 6am) to sunset (we can say approximately 6pm). Night-time is from sunset to sunrise.\n\nEvery day starts precisely at midnight. AM (ante-meridiem = before noon) starts just after midnight. PM (post-meridiem=after noon) starts just after midday. This means that 12am and 12pm have no meaning.\n\nThis diagram shows the cycle of a 24-hour day and the words we use to describe its parts. The day starts at midnight (at the bottom of the diagram)."
