        "text": "About The RIDE\n\nThe RIDE paratransit service provides door-to-door, shared-ride public transportation to people who can’t use the subway, bus, or trolley all or some of the time due to temporary or permanent disability.\n\nThe RIDE is available year-round in 58 cities and towns in the greater Boston area, with similar operating hours to the MBTA—generally from 5 AM to 1 AM daily. Customers schedule their trips on The RIDE one to five days in advance and are given a pick-up window for their ride’s arrival. Travel times are comparable to the same trip taken on fixed-route transit (bus, subway, or trolley) plus an additional 20 minutes. Like other public transit services, The RIDE is a shared service, so you’ll travel with other customers going in the same general direction.\n\nParatransit, like other public transportation services, may not meet all the needs of people with disabilities, and it does not function as medical or human service transportation. For information about alternative transportation options, please contact the Mobility Center.\n\nDownload a map of The RIDE service area\n\nThe RIDE serves these cities and towns:\n\nArlington\n\nBedford\n\nBelmont\n\nBeverly\n\nBoston\n\nBraintree\n\nBrookline\n\nBurlington\n\nCambridge\n\nCanton\n\nChelsea\n\nCohasset\n\nConcord\n\nDanvers\n\nDedham\n\nEverett\n\nHingham\n\nHolbrook\n\nHull\n\nLexington\n\nLincoln\n\nLynn\n\nLynnfield\n\nMalden\n\nMarblehead\n\nMedfield\n\nMedford\n\nMelrose\n\nMiddleton\n\nMilton\n\nNahant\n\nNeedham\n\nNewton\n\nNorwood\n\nPeabody\n\nQuincy\n\nRandolph\n\nReading\n\nRevere\n\nSalem\n\nSaugus\n\nSharon\n\nSomerville\n\nStoneham\n\nSwampscott\n\nTopsfield\n\nWakefield\n\nWalpole\n\nWaltham\n\nWatertown\n\nWenham\n\nWeston\n\nWestwood\n\nWeymouth\n\nWilmington\n\nWinchester\n\nWinthrop\n\nWoburn\n\nThe RIDE also serves portions of Abington, Avon, Billerica, Brockton, Stoughton, and Wellesley.\n\nText The RIDE\n\nRIDE customers can text 781-980-RIDE (7433) to check the arrival time for their trip, see a list of upcoming trips, check their account balance, or cancel a trip without having to call The RIDE Access Center (TRAC).\n\nIf you text from a number associated with your RIDE account, you’ll automatically get information. If you text from a different number, you will be prompted to log in by responding with your RIDE ID and birth date (MM/DD/YYYY).\n\nReceive Text Messages About Your Trip\n\nYou can also now receive your night before and day-of trip notifications by text message. Text “Subscribe” to 781-980-RIDE (7433) from a phone number in your RIDE account to sign up.
