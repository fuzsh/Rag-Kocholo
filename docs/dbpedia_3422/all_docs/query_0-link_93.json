        "text": "What are the lyrics to ‘O Holy Night’, in French and English?\n\nFrom its original French lyrics to the most popular renditions of this Christmas classic, here’s everything you need to know about ‘O Holy Night’.\n\n‘O Holy Night’ is a timeless Christmas carol, and a long-running favourite in The Nation’s Favourite Carol on Classic FM.\n\nComposed by Adolphe Adam in 1847, the carol’s music was originally set to a French poem, ‘Minuit, chrétiens’ (Midnight, Christians) and released under the name ‘Cantique de Noël’.\n\nAdam was a French composer and music critic who wrote mostly operas and ballets. Alongside the opera Giselle (1841), ‘O Holy Night’ is one of his best known works.\n\nPlacide Cappeau, the author of the French lyrics, was a wine merchant and poet. Although he was never particularly religious, Cappeau was asked in 1843 to write a Christmas poem to celebrate the recent renovation of the church organ in his home town. He obliged and, soon after, Adolphe Adam composed the accompanying music.\n\nAlmost a decade after ‘O Holy Night’ was composed, the lyrics were translated into English. Minister John Sullivan Dwight translated the French original into the lyrics we sing today in 1855.\n\nRead more: The 30 greatest Christmas carols of all time\n\nWhat are the lyrics to ‘O Holy Night’?\n\nO holy night, the stars are brightly shining,\n\nIt is the night of the dear Saviour’s birth;\n\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining,\n\n'Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.\n\nA thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,\n\nFor yonder breaks a new and glorious morn;\n\nChorus\n\nFall on your knees, Oh hear the angel voices!\n\nO night divine! O night when Christ was born.\n\nO night, O holy night, O night divine.\n\nLed by the light of Faith serenely beaming;\n\nWith glowing hearts by his cradle we stand:\n\nSo, led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,\n\nHere come the wise men from Orient land,\n\nThe King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger,\n\nIn all our trials born to be our friend;\n\nChorus\n\nHe knows our need, To our weakness no stranger!\n\nBehold your King! Before Him lowly bend!\n\nBehold your King! your King! before him bend!\n\nTruly He taught us to love one another;\n\nHis law is Love and His gospel is Peace;\n\nChains shall he break, for the slave is our brother,\n\nAnd in his name all oppression shall cease,\n\nSweet hymns of joy in grateful Chorus raise we;\n\nLet all within us praise his Holy name!\n\nChorus\n\nChrist is the Lord, then ever! ever praise we!\n\nHis pow'r and glory, evermore proclaim!\n\nHis pow'r and glory, evermore proclaim!\n\nRead more: What is the carol ‘O Come, O Come, Emmanuel’ really about?\n\nWhat are the original French lyrics to ‘O Holy Night’?\n\nMinuit, chrétiens,\n\nC'est l'heure solennelle\n\nOu l'Homme Dieu descendit jusqu'à nous\n\nPour effacer la tache originelle\n\nEt de Son Père arrêter le courroux.\n\nLe monde entier tressaille d'espérance\n\nEn cette nuit qui lui donne un Sauveur.\n\nPeuple a genoux, attends ta délivrance!\n\nNoel! Noel! Voici le Rédempteur!\n\nNoel! Noel! Voici le Rédempteur!\n\nLe Rédempteur\n\nA brise toute entrave:\n\nLa terre est libre et le ciel est ouvert.\n\nIl voit un Frère ou n'était qu'un esclave,\n\nL'amour unit ceux qu'enchainait le fer.\n\nQui Lui dira notre reconnaissance?\n\nC'est pour nous tous qu'Il nait,\n\nQu'Il souffre et meurt.\n\nPeuple debout, chante ta délivrance!\n\nNoel! Noel! Chantons le Rédempteur!\n\nNoel! Noel! Chantons le Rédempteur!\n\nWho has performed ‘O Holy Night’?\n\nAs well as the popular annual performances by The Choir of King’s College, Cambridge, many pop and classical music stars have put their own spin on the carol.\n\nThese include the classical crossover artists Josh Groban and Andrea Bocelli – who featured the original French version on his My Christmas album.\n\nMariah Carey released a cover of the song alongside her chart-topper 'All I Want For Christmas is You' on her Merry Christmas album.\n\nThe Motown blues singer Nat King Cole also recorded the song in 1960, giving the vocals a looser metre and rhythmic structure.\n\nIn Christmas 2022, baritone Aled Jones and young treble Malakai Bayoh went viral singing a magical duet rendition of the carol, with more than 25 million people watching their performance on social media."
