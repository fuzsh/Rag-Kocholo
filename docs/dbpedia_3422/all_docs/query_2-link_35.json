        "text": "It’s five answers to five questions. Here we go…\n\n1. Survey asked how my boss communicates about her mental health\n\nMy supervisor at work is participating in a company-run training program aimed at helping managers improve their management skills. As one of her direct reports, I’ve been invited to take an (anonymous) survey to provide feedback on her managing style. I get along with her and generally think she’s a good supervisor, so I figured it’d be an easy survey — but then I came to the question where I was told to rate how well she “communicates about her own mental health and wellness in an authentic way.”\n\nThis is weird, right? I’m not totally off-base on this? We have a good relationship and chat about things in our lives, but I wouldn’t want to share details of my mental health with my supervisor, and would probably be pretty uncomfortable if she started sharing hers with me. It feels more like it would foster bad boundaries than a professional relationship. But how do I respond to a survey where it seems clear that that’s an important metric to evaluate her performance? I do think she’s a good supervisor and want to reflect that — and I also don’t want her to be told she has to talk more about her mental health because I don’t want that to become a part of our meetings. Do I give a middle of the road response? A “not applicable”? Should I mention in the free response section that I don’t think it should be part of the survey?\n\nYes, that’s a weird and inappropriate question. I would either give her the highest rating (because for you, the way she is handling the topic is working well) or a N/A. And then yes, explain in the free response section that you believe everyone deserves privacy around their health at work and appreciate your manager for respecting appropriate boundaries.\n\nUnfortunately, employers keep going off the rails with this. Yes, it is healthy to acknowledge that we’re humans with a range of emotions, and it is good to destigmatize mental health issues. But expecting managers to communicate about their personal mental health is invasive and inappropriate, and many people really don’t want to be on the receiving end of those communications. Employers who want to promote mental health have lots of non-invasive ways they can do that: offering good mental health coverage as part of their insurance plans, being flexible with time off, building awareness of what types of accommodations are available, offering strong employee assistance programs, and being thoughtful about much stress employees are expected to take on. But that takes real resources, whereas a survey question like this doesn’t.\n\nRelated:\n\nforcing employees to talk about their feelings isn’t good for our mental health\n\n2. Can I wear a brace to avoid handshakes?\n\nIn a few weeks, I’ll be attending an in-person meeting with my company’s founder and former CEO. I’ve met him twice before and both times, he’s shaken my hand so hard that it hurts. The second time it reactivated a minor hand injury I was dealing with, which had been from another handshake a few weeks prior. (As an aside, why do people ever shake someone’s hand that hard?)\n\nHe’s a nice guy, and I’m a woman, and I don’t get the vibe that it’s a power play. It just feels like the legacy of the “firm handshake” advice and a dude not knowing his own strength. I don’t feel like I have the standing to pull the founder aside and ask him not to shake my hand so hard. Plus, he hasn’t remembered me twice, and I’m very low-level at the company — I’m pretty sure he’ll want to re-meet me and shake my hand immediately, before any aside-pulling can happen. But when I was dealing with my handshake injury before, people reacted weirdly to me not shaking their hand when they went offered it. I got puzzled looks, and people weren’t sure what to do with their outstretched hand. Can I wear a hand brace to make it more visible why I might not be shaking? And what’s a good alternative gesture to do when people try to shake my hand?\n\nYou can indeed wear a hand brace if you want to! But it’s also fine to just say, “I’d shake your hand but I’m recovering from a hand injury.” If people look a little puzzled, it’s probably not because they think you’re breaking the social contract in some way; it’s likely just their faces processing “oops, I’ve got my hand out and now need to retract it.”\n\nYou’re fine! People have hand injuries. Or they’re sick and doing everyone a favor by not shaking hands. It’s not a big deal as long as you’re matter-of-fact about it and make a point of being otherwise reasonably warm.\n\nRelated:\n\nchill out with the bone-crushing handshakes\n\n3. I end up doing more work than my less organized coworker\n\nI work in a team of four. My workmate Lucy and I are both part-time, have the same job description, and are paid the same; the other two are full-time and do different jobs.\n\nOur manager, Sarah, often allocates work to me and Lucy without specifying who will do what, e.g., “can the llama groomers pick this up?”\n\nLucy is a great person and we’re friends outside of work. However, she really struggles with organizational skills (she has ADHD and is very open about it) and I have strong organizational skills. So in practice, when something is assigned to the two of us, I usually end up making it happen. I’ll often ask Lucy to contribute to it in specific ways (“can you order more llama shampoo before Friday?”), but even then I usually have to remind her, sometimes several times. On occasion I’ve just done her part myself (checking with her if that’s okay) because it’s less stressful that way and means the job will happen on time.\n\nI find myself getting resentful of the situation. I’m paid the same as Lucy but organize much of our work. Sometimes I feel like I’m her de facto manager, but I’m not her manager and I’m not paid to be her manager. Meanwhile, our actual manager is quite hands-off once she’s assigned a job to us (I’m sure she’s aware that so much of it ends up falling to me, but this is never explicitly acknowledged). I think I’m taking on too much responsibility for things, both in terms of work and emotionally. How can I change this?\n\nIs the work usually something where an entire assignment can be handled by one of you rather than each person taking different parts of it? If so, it would be a lot easier for the two of you to switch off who takes the full assignments, rather than splitting them into multiple tasks (which you then end up organizing). Ideally when new tasks come in, you’d be able to reply, “I’ll take this one” or “Lucy will take this one” and then wash your hands of the latter entirely. (Even more ideally, Lucy would be speaking up and say “I’ll take this one” half the time, and you can ask her to do that — but if realistically that won’t happen, ask her if you can coordinate this type of system so it’s clear who’s taking what.)\n\nIf that doesn’t work, you should talk to Sarah and ask her to assign projects to one or the other of you but not both. Explain that under the current system, you end up feeling responsible for all the work rather than only your share of it.\n\nIf that doesn’t work, make the case that you should be paid for the role you’re playing in managing the work (and ideally given a title that recognizes that too).\n\n4. My coworkers want me to tell them why a colleague was fired\n\nI work in the financial services industry, which is highly regulated by multiple self-regulatory and government bodies.\n\nRecently, a senior teammate was let go for gross misconduct with regard to compliance with regulations, in part because I had to report them. I feel terrible because I don’t want anyone to lose their job, but I am legally required to report the misconduct or I could also be fired plus face criminal and civil penalties, including being barred from the industry.\n\nI’m now responsible for telling clients that this person is no longer with the company (without any details, obviously). That’s tough but manageable, and I’m able to navigate that with minimal management-level interaction, save the occasional client that needs a call from my grandboss, who is expecting and willing to take on those difficult clients as part of the transition process as we replace the former coworker.\n\nThe problem I’m facing is that coworkers on other teams are … perhaps too curious and, in some cases, active shit-disturbers, and have attempted to corner me into telling them in detail what happened. I cannot, and would not, tell them any details, and have directed them back to management with any questions they may have. Most have taken the hint but several (more than six) have not and have been calling, emailing, sending IM messages, etc., even calling my personal cell phone after hours to ask invasive and inappropriate questions.\n\nI let my manager know about this and they are taking it seriously. However, it’s only been a week but the questions haven’t stopped and I received a text message on my personal phone at midnight on Saturday asking me for “the hot goss.” Should I also go to HR about this, as well? I’m not responding to these messages at all on my personal devices, and I’m continuing to redirect to management for questions, but what in the world?! Any advice is appreciated.\n\nYou don’t need to go to HR, unless you want more back-up. You could! It wouldn’t be weird to. But it would also be fine to ignore the messages that people shouldn’t be sending in the first place, or to respond with, “I’m not allowed to discuss it and you’re putting me in a difficult position by continuing to ask. Please stop.”\n\n5. Candidates say I didn’t call for our schedule phone interview, but I did\n\nI am at my wits’ end. Some of the recruiting I do is high volume. Lately, I have been experiencing an increase in candidates claiming that I did not call them for our scheduled phone interview. When I call, if it goes to voicemail I always leave a message. In the past week or two, I have had several candidates state they did not receive a call or voicemail. I feel like it is an argument. How do I handle this? Sometimes it is the second call I’ve made after we rescheduled and they still do not answer.\n\nFirst, when multiple people are telling you that an odd technical thing is happening, especially in a short amount of time, it’s always smart to confirm that there’s not actually a problem on your end (including checking your call history for the possibility that you’ve called the wrong person, especially since you’re dealing with lots of calls). But assuming you check and it’s definitely not you, you don’t need to argue with people. You can say, “I’m sorry to hear that! I did log a call to you at 4:30 pm yesterday, but voicemail can be strange. In any case…” What comes next is up to you. If you’re still willing to interview them, suggest a time to reschedule for. If you’ve moved on (or if they’re handling the call in an unprofessional way that leaves you uninterested in rescheduling), you can say, “We’re no longer interviewing for that role, but I’ll reach out if that changes.”\n\nAlso, when you confirm a phone interview time, you could include language like: “If you haven’t heard from me by five minutes past the scheduled time, please call me directly at (number).” Or you can ask that they email you, or so forth — just something that lets them know how to handle it if they don’t hear from you when they expect to. That will put a rest to the debate about whether you called or not, since it will move the ball into their court with a clear action and timeline for them to take that action. And if they’re just forgetting about the call, that will make it clear. That might be more complicated than you want or need; if so, just stick with the advice in the first paragraph and ignore this one.\n\nA reader writes:\n\nI currently have an offer for an internal transfer to a different division in my company — same level but new team and scope of work. I’m planning on negotiating the salary offered (using some of your advice from prior letters!) which I would obviously want in writing, but I’m wondering if some of my other asks (number of days in the office, specific hours in the office) should also be in writing?\n\nUltimately, with an at-will job in which case the employer can always change the scope/requirements whenever they want, is there even a point to getting certain flexibilities in writing? For an exempt, salaried position, I’ve never seen work arrangements specified, so would it be reasonable to ask for it to be written as part of the offer?\n\nYou should get it in writing.\n\nThat’s not because putting it in writing will make it legally binding. In most cases in the U.S., it won’t. As you noted, employers can still change the terms of your employment at any time (unless you have a contract, which most U.S. workers don’t).\n\nBut putting it in writing still significantly increases the likelihood that the terms of your employment will be what you agreed to.\n\nFirst and foremost, it protects you against misunderstandings and miscommunications (like you think you’re agreeing to two WFH days a week, but they think it’s up to two WFH days per week, subject to manager approval) or even people just forgetting details down the road. It’s also useful to have a record of the agreement if there are personnel changes — like if a decision-maker promises you a salary review in six months but leaves the company after three months and no one else knows anything about that conversation. They still might not ultimately abide by it, but having documentation of what was agreed to makes it more likely.\n\nSecond, the act of writing this stuff down can bring misunderstandings to the surface before anything is finalized. For example, if you said X but they understood it as Y, putting it in writing is likely to make everyone realize that you’re not on the same page, thus giving you the opportunity to iron it out before it’s too late.\n\nThird, getting it written down can sometimes signal to an employer, “Oh wait, we had better really think this through.” People shouldn’t make promises off the cuff without fully thinking them through, but sometimes they do — which is how you end up starting a job thinking they agreed you could bring your parrot in but then find out it’s a no-go once after they actually check with someone. Just the act of asking to put something in writing can nudge people to make sure they really have all the sign-off’s they’ll need.\n\nSome companies are very rigid about what they will and won’t put in an offer letter and won’t budge from their normal boilerplate to add in additional details, even when they’re sincere about whatever they’re agreeing to. If you’re dealing with an employer like that, try simply summarizing the agreement in an email yourself — framing it as, “I wanted to summarize the details we’ve discussed. Would you look this over and confirm this looks right to you?” (And if they won’t even do that much, take that as a sign that the agreement may not be as firm as you thought.)\n\nA reader writes:\n\nI work freelance in an industry which is notorious for bad work-life balance. I have another job alongside my freelance work to top up my income. It’s seasonal, over a busy summer period for an organization that’s related to my freelance work, and I work 10 hours a week.\n\nMy role is an organizational/admin one, and a project had been getting into difficulties recently, with a lot of decisions being pushed back and then made last minute, and some very unclear communication. I am expected to be on call to a reasonable degree (or so I thought) over the summer, between 9 am and 9 pm, and this is with the understanding (I assumed) that I may well be out and about doing other things. There is nothing in my contract about extra renumeration for this, and my contract is very vague about my actual role and responsibilities (red flag, I know).\n\nThis past weekend there was a last-minute difficulty with a piece of equipment on Saturday, about 9:30 pm. I tried to help sort it until around 10:30 pm, but there was little I could do from a remote position, and around 11 pm I went to bed on the assumption that we could pick things up the next day, having heard nothing over work chat/phone call since 10:30.\n\nIt turns out that what I should have done is stayed awake for a phone call at 11:50 pm, which I am now in serious trouble for missing (because I was … asleep). A ten to midnight phone call, from someone I will refer to as Lady Macbeth. To clarify, this was about a piece of equipment — no one had died, no one was in the emergency room, and I’m not in a child protection role, so there is no way this was necessary. I put my phone on do not disturb at night and the only exceptions to that are immediate family and two very close friends.\n\nThe issue is now resolved, but I’m completely blindsided by how inappropriate it was. Lady Macbeth (LM henceforth) is a raging workaholic and expects everyone else to be — staff turnover among junior employees is very high, and I’m the only seasonal worker still here … from March.\n\nMy manager is in a work clique with LM and they are best pals (they’re both bad managers but LM is worse) so I’m very wary of approaching her about it. She’s almost definitely already heard about it from LM, as I know they gossip about staff members. HR is also in the work clique with them (it’s a gang of three in a small office) so no recourse there. There’s a lot of passive aggression and indirect exclusion of employees, but it’s all under a very nice facade so it can be tricky to spot.\n\nI accept that perhaps I should have communicated my intention to turn in for the night but surely the phone call is still completely out of line? I’m considering handing in my notice as the culture is very unhealthy and it’s seasonal so drawing to a close anyway. Is there anything else I can/should do? I told my mum and she was flabbergasted, and the opinion of my housemates is that I should just quit (I’ve actually got an interview this afternoon for another part-time role where I won’t have to take work home).\n\nEh, I do think that if you’re in the middle of helping to sort out an equipment issue at night and you need to go sleep, ideally you’d say that so people know you’re no longer working on it and no longer available. It can just be a simple “I’m heading to sleep for the night but I’ll check back in tomorrow.”\n\nThey don’t have a claim on your sleeping hours and your on-call availability apparently was only set for 9-9, but when you’re actively engaged in troubleshooting a problem, it’s reasonable to expect you’ll tell them if you’re now done for the night.\n\nThat’s said, it’s also true that sometimes when it’s past 10:30 pm, sometimes people simply fall asleep, especially when conversation on an issue has fallen off.\n\nCalling you at 11:50 pm (80 minutes past the last time there had been any communication) was out of line. Text or email to ask if you were available, sure. Calling, no.\n\nRegardless, “in serious trouble” isn’t an appropriate response to any of this. At most it should be, “Hey, when we’re actively troubleshooting something, would you let us know if you’re about to be unavailable, so that we’re not assuming you’re still working on it?” Message delivered, expectations clarified, done. That should also be paired with, “And thanks for staying up to help with that as late as you did; I know you didn’t have to.”\n\nSo what does “in serious trouble” for missing the phone call mean? If it just means LM was crabby with you but nothing else is going to happen … well, that sounds consistent with what you already know about LM and not necessarily a big deal. On the other hand, if it means something like she’s implying her trust in you is broken, they’re rethinking your work for them, or anything along those lines, that would be a wild overreaction. But since your manager hasn’t spoken to you about it and you’re not sure you even want to raise it with her, I’m guessing it might be more the former than the latter? If so, you should just figure you already knew LM was a jerk with unrealistic expectations and this is more of the same, and just move on … while also considering being more of a stickler about being unavailable after 9 pm, per your contract.\n\nHowever, that’s just for this incident. More broadly, this job sounds like a clusterfudge of problems, and your reaction is likely being colored by the fact that you have a bunch of other legitimate grievances (probably more than anyone should put up with for a 10-hour-a-week job). If you want to quit because this made you realize you just want to be done with dealing with them, go for it.\n\nIt’s five answers to five questions. Here we go…\n\n1. Is the term “junior” derogatory?\n\nI recently had a minor dust-up at work that surprised me. I had a contract service scheduled to happen on-site at a vendor. Two of my coworkers expressed interest in attending in person with me to learn how it is done. These two coworkers are relatively new grads, about 10 years less experienced than me, and have job titles below mine, though I don’t supervise them. I sent a note to the vendor requesting permission for them to attend and in doing so referred to the two coworkers as “junior colleagues” of mine.\n\nThe coworkers were hurt. One brought it up to me.\n\nI apologized for any hurt feelings and explained, sincerely, that I didn’t have or intend any negative associations with the word “junior.” I had used the word because I needed the vendor to be prepared for inexperienced people on the job site (they need physical monitoring). I also wanted the vendor to be prepared to answer more than the usual number of questions, and though I doubted they’d refuse the visitors, I wanted to give them a polite out if they didn’t want this particular job to be used as a learning opportunity. I also needed the vendor to understand that I still was the point of contact on the project and to some degree (by virtue of being there) was responsible for the conduct of my colleagues in a sensitive location not accessible to the public. I wasn’t just mentioning rank for funsies; it was relevant.\n\nI spent a long time in academia, and there “junior” and “senior” were very normal words to describe grad students, postdocs, researchers, fellows, etc., of varying levels of experience. Usually, you literally were just referring to how long that person had been there. It was also very common for informal mentoring and teaching relationships to exist between “junior” and “senior” people within a level; I guess I thought that was part of what was being asked of me in having these coworkers attend this service site with me.\n\nI certainly won’t use the word again now that I know these coworkers have a sore spot with it. Is this just them, or does this term have a broader connotation I’m not aware of? Is there a better way I could phrase things when I need to communicate a difference in seniority—oops!—I mean, in title, level of responsibility within the organization, or experience?\n\nIt’s completely normal to use terms like “junior” and “senior” in a work context! Sometimes it refers to how long someone has been there (particularly with “senior”) but more often it’s a reflection of the level of the position and responsibility the person holds or their amount of experience in the field overall. Sometimes, too, it’s a description of relationships relative to each other; you could be senior to me/my position but still junior to your boss.\n\nAssuming “relatively new grads” means your colleagues graduated a year or two ago, they are junior; you’re not required to pretend that they’re not, and you had relevant reasons for mentioning it. (And in some fields they’d be considered junior far longer than that; it’s pretty field-dependent.)\n\nIf they weren’t actually junior, it would be understandable for them to feel like you minimized their expertise and competence, but that doesn’t sound like the case. You used a normal term in a normal way.\n\nRelated:\n\nmy coworkers say I should hold back because I’m early-career … but am I?\n\n2. All-female staff at women’s health offices\n\nI was recently at a gynecologist appointment, and noticed yet again that all of the staff who work there are women. This has been the case at several different OB-GYN offices I’ve been to, as well as at the women’s center where I’ve had my mammograms done.\n\nWhile male OB-GYNs do exist, there haven’t been any at any of the practices I’ve been a patient at. But even beyond the doctors themselves, all nurses, medical assistants, ultrasound techs, phlebotomists, and even the receptionists have all been women. I know why they do this — many women don’t want men in the room during a pelvic exam or a mammogram. But how can they legally get away with only hiring women? Especially for non-clinical roles? I doubt the law prohibiting hiring discrimination based on sex has an exception for female-target health care. Is it really that men just tend not to apply at gyn offices?\n\nThe law prohibiting gender discrimination includes an exception for what’s called “bona fide occupational qualifications,” which allows employers to make a job single-sex-only if it’s truly necessary to the work. The law recognizes this exception in three circumstances: privacy (for example, you can preference women when hiring a women’s locker room attendant), “authenticity in the arts” (like in casting for movies or TV), and when the qualification “relates to the normal operation or essence of the business” (like the mandatory retirement age for pilots for safety reasons).\n\nHowever, customer preference for men or women in a particular role doesn’t normally qualify.\n\nI suspect what you’re seeing is largely self-selecting — for example, men tend not to go into mammography at all, and I suspect they apply for other jobs at women’s health centers in lower numbers too — but it’s probably mixed in with at least a bit of the people who are hiring giving preference to female candidates and no one having challenged that.\n\n3. Can I address my struggling employee’s use of PTO?\n\nMy office has a generous time-off benefit, with about five weeks of vacation and 2.5 weeks of sick time, plus all the usual holidays and a two-week winter closure (paid). Most people end up needing to take 1-2 days a month just to stay under the vacation cap, but I have one employee who has the opposite problem and often uses up his accruals immediately. He takes many vacations each year, and needs additional time off for external commitments. This means he usually hovers around a balance of 2-3 days banked (compared to most other people who have 15-20 days available at any given time).\n\nI’ve always believed that a person’s PTO is a compensation benefit and wouldn’t make anyone feel guilty for taking the time they are owed. But lately this person’s performance is starting to dip, and a few balls are being dropped because he’s overwhelmed. Would it be reasonable as a manager to say that he may have an easier time staying on top of things if he was around more often? It feels unfair that I may need to adjust projects and reassign work to others in the office to make up for his extensive travel schedule.\n\nYes, it’s reasonable to say, “The expectation is that you’ll manage your time off in a way that ensures balls aren’t dropped and doesn’t require others to regularly cover for you.” It’s also reasonable to point out that an especially demanding period isn’t the right time for optional time-off (that’s why some teams have vacation black-out dates or all-hands-on-deck periods) or to say, “I can’t approve a week off next month because it’s right before the major event you’re responsible for / you just came back from a week off and you have an accumulating backlog that needs to be processed by October 1 / or so forth.”\n\nIt wouldn’t be reasonable to say either of these things if they meant a responsible person would have a tough time ever taking vacation; if the guy’s workload is such that he’s never going to get time off without you adjusting projects and reassigning work, then adjusting projects and reassigning work is what you do … but otherwise, yeah, you can say this. But look at his workload first to make sure.\n\nIt’s also pretty common for companies not to permit unpaid time off at all, or to put limits on it. If you offer 7.5 weeks off per year, you presumably hired assuming the position would be staffed 44.5 weeks a year and it’s reasonable to require that (with flexibility for extenuating circumstances). So you might take a look at how the additional unpaid time off is playing into this.\n\nNote: I’m assuming you know these are actual vacations and he’s not using the time off for medical reasons, which would be a different thing.\n\n4. Stuck in the middle of a conflict with my employee and my manager\n\nOne of my staff members and my direct supervisor recently had a bad interaction on the public floor (both seem to be at fault). Both reached out to me after the incident. My supervisor asked me to bring my staff member in to have a meeting with the three of us. Is this appropriate?\n\nIt’s not inappropriate. But if at all possible, you should talk to them each individually beforehand and hear about what happened from their perspectives, plus find out what your manager’s goals are for the meeting so that you’re not walking in unprepared. Your manager should be willing to to prep you for what the point of the meeting is and, since you manage the staff member, should be open to hearing your input on the best way to handle it.\n\nIdeally, if they were really both at fault, your role would be something like a translator — “Jane’s concerns were X, which is why she said Y / Rupert was coming from a place of concern about Z / here’s my take on how we can move forward.” But that won’t work in every situation; it depends on exactly what happened.\n\n5. Still no photos on resumes?\n\nI was wondering if your “no photos on resumes” (in the U.S.) ruling has changed at all since 2012? I’m curious because my friend asked me to review her resume, which she had created with a snazzy online tool. It looked nice, but it had a spot for a photo, which I always thought was a no-no. Have norms on this changed since most people have photos on LinkedIn or other easily-findable places?\n\nNope, it’s still the rule. Photos do not belong on resumes.\n\nWhat’s happened, though, is that there are a number of truly terrible resume templates online created by people who know a lot about design and absolutely nothing about resumes, and so you end up with awful templates that don’t suit their purpose at all. (See not only photos, but also templates with hardly any room for the stuff employers care about most, like job history and accomplishments.)"
