        "text": "A bloodthirsty Bigfoot, which kills without warning, is on a rampage. A strong, beautiful, woman shows up claiming to represent the Government and pushes the local Sheriff into hunting this creature.\n\nA photographer is haunted by nightmares of his mother's murder at the hands of a werewolf-type creature, but soon realizes it's more than just his memories that are rising to the surface.\n\nA surviving amnesiac victim of a serial killer is terrorized while the police works with a psychiatrist to bring him to justice and stop the crime wave.\n\nArchie is a \"brain\" at a small town high school who works part-time at his uncle's mortuary and is harassed by a few of the popular kids because of it. His harassers die in an automobile accident, and the bodies are taken to his uncle's mortuary. Archie is pulling a late night at the mortuary when he sees a storm brewing. Lighting strikes! They're alive! The preppie bullies continue to torment him - as zombies.\n\nA football star throws a party for his friends. Two insane killers escape from a nearby asylum on that same night, and in their efforts to elude authorities, wind up at the party.\n\nA womanizing reality-TV producer (Spencer) unwittingly sleeps with a mysterious woman (Alison), who turns out to be his own stalker. Alison then kidnaps Spencer and holds him hostage while she humiliates and abuses him, recording every moment on camera for her own twisted reality-TV show.\n\nFour friends are stranded on what was once an old civil war battle ground and are haunted by the souls of those who died there.\n\nA doctor tries to save his son's life through a complicated heart transplant operation, the involuntary donor being a gorilla. Eventually, the young man turns into a violent hybrid beast.\n\nWhen an alien being crash lands on the remote location of the latest \"reality\" show, sinister agents from the reconstituted Project Blue Book arrive to restore order by any means necessary. But they don't anticipate a small town sheriff who will desperately fight to extricate his wife & son from the web in which they have been ensnared. Night of the Chupacabra is an action packed, thrill ride parody of the sci-fi/action film genre.\n\nTen teenagers party at an abandoned funeral parlor on Halloween night. When an evil force awakens, demonic spirits keep them from leaving and turn their gathering into a living Hell."
