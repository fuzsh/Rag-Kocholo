Reference in Act 1 Scene 2 to courtiers being afraid of a strange lion may allude to an incident in Scotland in 1594\n\nRomeo and Juliet Astrological allusions and earthquake reference may suggest composition in 1595-96\n\nRichard II Typically dated 1595-96. Described in 1601 as 'old and long out of use'\n\nKing John Written between 1595 and 1597; an anonymous two-part King John was published in 1591 but Shakespeare's version is stylistically close to later histories\n\nThe Merchant of Venice Registered for publication in 1598, reference to a ship Andrew suggests late 1596 or early 1597 as a Spanish ship of the name was captured around that time\n\nHenry IV Part I Probably written and first performed 1596-97, registered for publication in 1598\n\nHenry IV Part II Written around 1597-98 and registered for publication in 1600, both parts are based on Holinshed's Chronicles\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing Late 1598, not mentioned in Francis Meres's 1598 list of Shakespeare's plays but included the role Dogberry for Will Kemp, a comic actor who left the company in early 1599\n\nHenry V Written in 1599, mentions a 'general... from Ireland coming', could be referring to the Earl of Essex's Irish expedition in 1599\n\nAs You Like It Typically dated late 1599. Not mentioned in Francis Meres's 1598 list of Shakespeare's plays, unless originally called Love's Labour's Won\n\nJulius Caesar 1599. Not mentioned in Meres's 1598 list of plays, seen at the Globe by Swiss visitor Thomas Platter in 1599\n\n1600 - 1610\n\nHamlet Dated around 1600, registered for publication in summer 1602. There are allusions to Julius Caesar, which was written in 1599\n\nThe Merry Wives of Windsor Estimated 1597 - 1601, though an allusion to the Order of the Garter might indicate that it was performed at the Garter Feast in 1597\n\nTwelfth Night 1601. Not mentioned in Meres's 1598 list of plays and alludes to a map first published in 1599\n\nTroilus and Cressida Dated 1601-02, registered for publication early 1603 and alludes to the play Thomas Lord Cromwell, which was registered for publication in 1602\n\nOthello Dated 1604 though some argue for a slightly earlier date. It is recorded to have been performed in court in November 1604\n\nMeasure for Measure Performed at court for Christmas 1604, probably written earlier the same year\n\nAll's Well That Ends Well No strong evidence for date written or first performed, but it is usually dated 1603-06 on stylistic grounds\n\nTimon of Athens Estimated 1604-06 based on stylistic similarity to King Lear\n\nKing Lear Dated 1605-06. Performed at court December 1606 and seems to refer to eclipses of September and October 1605\n\nMacbeth 1606. Certainly more Jacobean than Elizabethan based on the play's several compliments to King James\n\nAntony and Cleopatra Dated 1606-07, registered for publication in 1608 and perhaps performed at court in 1606 or 1607\n\nCoriolanus Perhaps written in 1608. Allusion to 'coal of fire upon ice' in Act 1 could refer to the great frost of winter in 1607/08\n\nPericles 1608. Registered for publication in 1608; Wilkin's novel The Painful Adventures of Pericles, cashing in on the success of the play, was published in 1608\n\nCymbeline 1610. A performance in 1611 is recorded. Theatres were reopened in spring 1610 after a long closure due to the plague\n\nAfter 1610\n\nThe Winter's Tale 1611. Performed at the Globe May 1611; dance of satyrs apparently borrows from a court entertainment of January 1611\n\nThe Tempest 1611. Performed at court in November 1611; uses source material not available before autumn 1610\n\nHenry VIII 1613. The first Globe theatre burnt down in a fire that started during a performance of the play on 29 June 1613\n\nThe Two Noble Kinsmen 1613-14; 'our loss' in the Prologue probably refers to the Globe fire of 1613\n\nYou are in: About Shakespeare"
