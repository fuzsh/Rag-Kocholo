        "text": "From the day of the Sun to the day of the Moon\n\nToday the week starts with the day of the moon, Monday and ends with the day of the sun, Sunday. Previously, Sunday, was the first day of the week and the 'washing day' - Saturday - ended the week.\n\nRoman gods become Nordic weekday names\n\nThe Romans named the days of the week after the Sun and the Moon and five planets, which were also the names of their gods.\n\nThe gods and planets were Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn.\n\nIn the Nordic countries, the Sun (Sunday) and the Moon (Monday) also became the first two days of the week, and the Roman gods became four of the Nordic gods with similarities:\n\nMars became Tyr (Tuesday), Mercury became Odin (Wednesday), Jupiter became Thor (Thursday) and Venus became Frigg (Friday). Saturday came outside the system: The Norse form 'Saturday' means 'hot water day' - which can be translated as 'washing day' or 'washing water day'.\n\nSunnudagr – Sunday, the day of the Sun\n\nSól is a goddess in Norse mythology. 'Sol' means Sun. Over time, the day of the sun became Sunday.\n\nIn the runic alphabet, the rune-S name is Sun.\n\nMánadagr – Monday\n\nThe name Monday is related to the moon. The Latin name for moon is 'Luna', and in French Monday is still called 'Lundí'.\n\nIn the Nordic areas, the moon was called \"Mani\", and in time Mánadagr became Monday.\n\nIn Norse mythology, a distinction is made between two different meanings of the name 'Maní', meaning moon.\n\nOne is the cosmic phenomenon 'the moon', and in the other sense it referes to a mythical person. Monday was the day of the moon, and is named after the mythical person 'Maní'.\n\nTysdagr - Tuesday\n\nMars is a god of war, and so is the Nordic god 'Tyr' or 'Tír'.\n\nIt is Týr who has given his name to Tuesday.\n\nIn Norse mythology, Týr is one of the Aesir. He is primarily known as the god of justice and war, but is also described as wise and brave.\n\nThe T-rune was associated with Tyr.\n\nÓðinsdagr – Wednesday\n\nOdin can be compared to the Roman god Mercury, so in the Nordic tradition Odin (also known as 'Woden') gave his name to Wednesday.\n\nOdin is the most prominent god in traditional Norse mythology.\n\nHe is particularly associated with war luck, royal power, rune power and wisdom.\n\nOdin is the most powerful and eldest of the Æsir. He rules all things, and is mightier than the other gods, they all serve him as children obey a father. Frigg is his wife, and she knows all the fates of men, though she speaks no prophecy.\n\nOdin is called All father because he is father of all the gods. He is also called father of the Slain, because all those that fall in battle are the sons of his adopt on, for them he appoints Valhal.\n\nÞórsdagr - Thursday\n\nThor is reminiscent of Jupiter, as they both deal with lightning and thunder. So this day of the week became Thursday.\n\nThor is in Nordic mythology Sif's husband and was the god of thunder.\n\nThe name Þórr (Thor) is related to the word 'thunder'.\n\nThor controlled the weather, and fought the enemies of civilization, who at that time were giants and trolls.\n\nHe is associated with strength, aggression and reliability.\n\nThor is strongest of all the gods and men. He has his realm in the place called Thrúdvangar, and his hall is called Bilskirnir, in that hall are five hundred rooms and forty.\n\nThor has two he-goats, that are called Tooth-Gnasher and Tooth-Gritter, and a chariot draen by the he-goats.\n\nFrjádagr - Friday\n\nVenus is the goddess of love, and so is Frigg (and maybe also Freya, as they may have originally been the same goddess).\n\nFrígg gave the name to Friday.\n\nFrigg is Odin's wife in Norse mythology. She was perceived as the goddess of marriage.\n\nShe was also a protector and helper in traditional women's work, such as weaving, sewing and cooking.\n\nFrigg has a farmstead called Fensalir, and it is most glorious.\n\nLaugardagr (sunnunótt) – Saturday\n\nMost inexplicable among the Old Norse day-names is laugardagr.\n\n'Laug' mean bath or hot water and 'dagr' means day. So you can translate the Nordic word for Saturday into 'the day of the hot water' or 'bathing dag'\n\nSaturday was also known as Sunnunótt - the night before Sunday and can be recognized - in some parts of Germany - often used words for Saturday: 'Sonnabend'\n\nIn Latin the day was named after Saturn (Saturni), and we can recognize it in the English language; Saturday."
