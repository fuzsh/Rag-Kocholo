        "text": "“With tinges of magic realism and beautifully rendered descriptions of birds flitting in and out of characters’ lives…The Thirty Names of Night stands out for its lyrical quality.\"\n\n– The New York Times Book Review\n\n\"The Thirty Names of Night is a multifaceted jewel of a novel and each facet is brilliant in its own way....Joukhadar is a richly poetic writer…This incredibly courageous novel, full of suspense and discoveries, reminds us of the dignity we all deserve and the pain suffered by those who still feel the need to hide themselves.”\n\n– Washington Post\n\n“Joukhadar’s prose is poetic and painterly, mirroring the artistic bent of its narrator, and the book is ultimately a joyful one”.\"\n\n– San Francisco Chronicle\n\n\"Zeyn Joukhadar’s new book is a vivid exploration of loss, art, queer and trans communities, and the persistence of history. Often tender, always engrossing, The Thirty Names of Night is a feat.\"\n\n– R.O. Kwon, author of The Incendiaries\n\n“Evocative and beautifully written, reading this is like opening a treasure trove of memories and images that shimmer both with light and the darkness of our times. It addresses important issues of migration, belonging, sexuality and love.”\n\n– Christy Lefteri, author of The Beekeeper of Aleppo\n\n\"Long after the story ended, I remain haunted by Zeyn Joukhadar’s novel, The Thirty Names of Night: part ghost story, part history, part art, all magic. Using gorgeous prose, Joukhadar deftly takes the reader on a journey of migration and belonging, explores the price of silence and of secrets, and tells an exquisite tale of family and love.\"\n\n– Devi S. Laskar, author of The Atlas of Reds and Blues\n\n“The Thirty Names of Night crafts a gorgeous new subgenre of poetic-reality. In Joukhadar's intensely atmospheric New York, the portal to a universe of information is not technology, but ornithology. A lush, passionate eco-urban fable, and a truly glorious book.”\n\n– Jordy Rosenberg, author of Confessions of the Fox\n\n\"A fable of being and belonging....Joukhadar's prose style--folkloric, lyrical, and emotionally intense--creates its own atmosphere. Gorgeous and alive.\"\n\n– Kirkus Reviews, starred review\n\n\"Stunning...vivid, visceral, and urgent....This clarifying and moving tale has far-reaching significance and appeal.\"\n\n– Booklist, starred review"
