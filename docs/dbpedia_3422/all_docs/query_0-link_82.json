        "text": "We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process.\n\nMedical News Today only shows you brands and products that we stand behind.\n\nOur team thoroughly researches and evaluates the recommendations we make on our site. To establish that the product manufacturers addressed safety and efficacy standards, we:\n\nEvaluate ingredients and composition: Do they have the potential to cause harm?\n\nFact-check all health claims: Do they align with the current body of scientific evidence?\n\nAssess the brand: Does it operate with integrity and adhere to industry best practices?\n\nWe do the research so you can find trusted products for your health and wellness.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nWhen a person has night sweats they may wake up with drenched pajamas and sheets. Management strategies, such as creating a cool sleeping environment, can help stop night sweats.\n\nThere are various causes of night sweats, which doctors call “sleep hyperhidrosis.” The issue is often not serious, but it sometimes shows that a person needs medical attention.\n\nSweating is the body’s natural cooling system, a way to prevent overheating. A region in the brain called the hypothalamus regulates body temperature. It works with more than 2 million sweat glands to keep the body at the right temperature.\n\nSweat glands release water and other substances through the skin. As the water evaporates, it releases heat energy. This is how sweating cools the body.\n\nIn this article, we describe common causes of night sweats and how to treat or manage them.\n\nHot days and workouts, for example, heat the body and trigger sweating as a way to cool down.\n\nPerspiration also occurs during sleep and in other situations. It may be a response to:\n\nCertain substances: Consuming alcohol or taking some medications or drugs can cause night sweats.\n\nInfections: Tuberculosis, influenza, and other illnesses that involve a fever can lead to night sweats.\n\nHypoglycemia: This is another name for low blood sugar.\n\nHormone imbalances: These can occur due to menopause, diabetes, thyroid problems, puberty, and pregnancy.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease: Though this typically causes heartburn, night sweats are a common feature.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea: This restricts breathing during sleep, and a person with untreated sleep apnea is three times as likely to have night sweats as someone without the condition.\n\nStress and anxiety: These can cause additional sweating during the day and at night, particularly in people who experience night terrors or panic disorder.\n\nAutoimmune disease: Some examples include rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell arteritis.\n\nSurgery that affects hormone levels: One that commonly results in night sweats is the removal of female reproductive organs.\n\nCardiovascular diseases: Some examples include aortic dissection and nocturnal angina.\n\nNeurological disorders: For example, strokes and autonomic neuropathy may cause night sweats.\n\nCancer: Night sweats can also be an early indication of cancer, especially lymphoma or leukemia, though other initial symptoms may be more noticeable.\n\nTransgender people often have difficulty sleeping, according to 2017 research. One reason can be night sweats as a result of hormone treatment.\n\nIn a person going through menopause, doctors consider night sweats to be a vasomotor symptom, because the issue affects blood flow. Also, research points to a link between night sweats and the risk of coronary heart disease in midlife.\n\nObesity may also aggravate night sweats during menopause, according to another study.\n\nMedications\n\nNight sweats can be a side effect of some medications, including:\n\nantidepressants\n\nmedications for other mental health issues\n\nhormone therapies\n\ndiabetes medications\n\nsome drugs to lower fevers, such as aspirin and acetaminophen\n\nsteroids\n\nAnyone who wonders whether a medication may be responsible for this issue should check the drug’s packaging or ask a pharmacist or another healthcare provider.\n\nSome people sweat excessively throughout the day and night. This is called hyperhidrosis, and it appears to affect almost 3% of the United States population.\n\nSome research has pointed to a link between excessive sweating and social anxiety disorder, and some experts believe that a problem with the central nervous system may underlie both issues.\n\nMany people with hyperhidrosis avoid bringing it up with doctors out of embarrassment, but treatments and management strategies can help.\n\nThe right approach to night sweats depends on the underlying cause. Treating the issue may involve correcting hormone irregularities or adjusting dosages of medications.\n\nIn some other situations, a doctor may recommend management strategies, such as:\n\ncreating a cool sleeping environment\n\nusing light, breathable, pajamas and sheets made from natural fabrics\n\nsleeping with air-conditioning or a fan on\n\ndrinking plenty of water to prevent dehydration\n\npracticing relaxation techniques or breathing exercises before bed and after waking up with a night sweat\n\nusing clinical-strength antiperspirant on areas such as the underarms, hands, feet, hairline, back, chest, or groin before bed\n\nlimiting the intake of alcohol, caffeine, and spicy foods\n\nnot eating 2–3 hours before bed\n\ngetting regular exercise, but not too close to bedtime\n\nmaintaining a healthy weight\n\nhaving a healthful diet that is low in fat and sugar\n\nreceiving treatment for any underlying health issues\n\nCotton sheets are available for purchase online — so are various antiperspirants.\n\nAlso, medications called anticholinergic agents can help reduce sweating, but a person should only take them if a doctor recommends it.\n\nThe causes listed in an earlier section can all lead to night sweats in females. The issue usually occurs during times when hormones are changing, such as:\n\nmenopause, which commonly causes night sweats and hot flashes\n\npregnancy\n\njust after giving birth, in which case the doctor may refer to “postpartum night sweats“\n\nIt is an especially good idea to bring up night sweats with a doctor if the sweating:\n\nis severe\n\nchanges in frequency\n\naffects sleep and the quality of life\n\nis not sufficiently addressed with management strategies\n\nThe causes listed in an earlier section can also affect males.\n\nIn addition, older research suggests that males experience a type of menopause, during which testosterone levels fall around midlife.\n\nExcessive sweating is a feature of low testosterone levels, or hypogonadism. Around 39% of males aged 45 and above may experience this drop in testosterone. They may also experience night sweats as a result. However, there appears to be little evidence to support this idea.\n\nA doctor may suggest hormone treatment or perform tests to identify the cause of the sweating.\n\nNight sweats affect many people. They are sometimes no cause for concern, but they can interrupt sleep and so reduce the quality of life. Also, in some cases, night sweats are a sign of a health issue that requires attention.\n\nSleeping in a cool room with bedding and pajamas made from light natural fabrics may help. If not, a doctor can recommend other approaches, which may include medication.\n\nIf sweating is a side effect of a medication, the doctor may change the drug or the dosage.\n\nSeek medical advice if sweating is severe, concerning, or if it accompanies other symptoms."
