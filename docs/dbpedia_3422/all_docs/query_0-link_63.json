Help me to put You first in every area of my life. Help me to live one day at a time. Help me to not worry about tomorrow but instead focus on what You’re doing in my life right now. I want to trust in your promise to take care of every one of my needs — financial, relational, physical, social, spiritual, and emotional. Help me to trust You more and worry less. I pray in Jesus’ name. Amen.\n\nEvening Prayer to Dispel Fear\n\nYou may be long past your fear of the dark, but the quiet of night can still bring about worries and fears.

Asking God to guide children and give them an eternal perspective is important. And if kids have made a mistake, turning to God to ask Him to instill wisdom in them is also important.\n\n“Dear Lord, please help my children as they learn and grow. Please grant them an eternal perspective that helps them to see beyond the here and now. Please help foster this worldview and use me as a parent to plant the right seeds — seeds that will grow and flourish throughout their lives. Please grant my children the wisdom to know right from wrong and to discern what Your divine will is for their lives. And, if and when they fall, please grant me the peace and wisdom to help them get back up. Thank You for the blessing of children, Lord. In the name of Your son Jesus I pray, Amen.”\n\nPsalms to Pray Over Your Children at Night\n\nAuthor and blogger Luke Gilkerson wrote about the importance of praying over your children before bed. It teaches them to rely on God, sets a good example, and protects them as they sleep. Prayers from the heart or recited prayers are great, but even better? The Bible itself. Psalms is full of great passages and prayers. Here are three Gilkerson recommends:\n\nPsalm 121 (NIV)\n\nA song of ascents. I lift up my eyes to the mountains — where does my help come from? My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth. He will not let your foot slip — he who watches over you will not slumber; indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord watches over you — the Lord is your shade at your right hand; the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord will keep you from all harm — he will watch over your life; the Lord will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.\n\nPsalm 139: 7-12 (NIV)\n\nWhere can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast. If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,” even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.\n\nPsalm 63:5-8 (NIV)\n\nI will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you. On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night. Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings. I cling to you; your right hand upholds me.\n\nRead Also: 10 Bedtime Prayers For Children\n\nEven More Night Prayer Options\n\nWe added even more bedtime prayers to provide a total guide to nighttime prayers and Bible verses. Here are 15 more prayers:\n\nThe Lord’s Prayer\n\nLuke 11:2-4 (NIV)\n\nThe Lord’s Prayer is one of the most popular invocations in the Christian world. Luke 11:2-4 (NIV) offers up a shorter version, which could be integrated into bedtime and night prayer routines. The structure, alone, offers a helpful template. The Lord’s Prayer encourages Christians to cling to God’s will, to seek forgiveness, to seek God’s help in avoiding temptation and to ask for protection against Satan:\n\nWhen you pray, say: ‘Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread. Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.’\n\nRead Also: What is the Meaning and History Behind the Lord's Prayer?\n\nMatthew 6:9-13 (NIV)\n\nBible readers are given a bit of an expanded version of this prayer in Matthew 6:9-13 (NIV) when Jesus proclaims that this is how people should pray. Christ proclaims:\n\nThis, then, is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’\n\nRead Also: 5 Powerful Prayers For Healing And Life Transformation\n\n1 Chronicles 4:10 (NIV)\n\nJabez’s prayer in 1 Chronicles 4:10 can be applied to our own lives. It’s a wonderful pattern to follow when saying night prayers for protection and God’s hand on your life:\n\nJabez cried out to the God of Israel, “Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain.” And God granted his request.\n\nPsalm 136:1-3;25-26 (NIV)\n\nAnother Psalm to focus on is Psalm 136, specifically verses 1-3 and 25-26. This, too, can be used as a night prayer reflection to help keep the focus on all God has done. From food to basic resources, the Lord’s provision is worth focusing on at the end of each and every day.\n\nGive thanks to the Lord, for he is good. His love endures forever.\n\nGive thanks to the God of gods. His love endures forever.\n\nGive thanks to the Lord of lords: His love endures forever.\n\nHe gives food to every creature. His love endures forever.\n\nGive thanks to the God of heaven. His love endures forever.\n\n1 John 1:9 (NIV)\n\n1 John 1:9 is a wonderful verse to focus on during night prayers, as it keeps the heart of the gospel in mind. It is essential to ask God for forgiveness, and to remember that He can help us no matter what happens. Mistakes happen, but Christ is there to cleanse us — and we can return to Him at any time.\n\nIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\n\nPsalm 25:5 (NIV)\n\nPsalm 25:5 reminds us to seek truth and to rely on God in the process. It’s another excellent scripture to integrate into bedtime prayers, as you seek to keep the Lord at the center of your life.\n\nGuide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my Savior, and my hope is in you all day long.\n\nIsaiah 41:10 (NIV)\n\nIsaiah 41:10 helps us to focus on God’s plan for our lives, and it affirms the fact that the Lord is there for us no matter what. Rather than falling prey to fear, the verse reminds us to turn to Christ in praise and reliance. It’s a wonderful addition to consider in your night prayers.\n\nSo do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."
