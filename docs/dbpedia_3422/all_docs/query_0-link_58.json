        "text": "Night refers to the time of day between sunset and sunrise. The word night can also refer to the darkness that accompanies this period or an evening reserved for a certain event. Night can also be used as an adjective to describe something that happens at night. Night has a few other senses as a noun and an adjective.\n\nGenerally speaking, night doesn’t begin or end at any specific times. We usually consider it to be night when the sun has set completely and all sunlight is gone. Night ends when the sun rises and illuminates the sky again.\n\nReal-life examples: In the northern hemisphere, nights are longer during the winter and shorter during the summer. Most people go to sleep at night.\n\nUsed in a sentence: The kids aren’t allowed outside at night because it’s too dark to see well.\n\nNight also refers to the darkness that falls after the sun sets.\n\nUsed in a sentence: To gaze at the stars, you need to let your eyes adjust to the night.\n\nNight can also refer to an evening where some specific event happens or has significance.\n\nReal-life examples: Children go trick-or-treating on Halloween Night. A TV show might be aired every Friday night. A couple may decide to schedule a date night.\n\nUsed in a sentence: My mom makes us go to bed early on school nights.\n\nNight is also used to describe something that is related to night or happens during the night."
