        "text": "Diabetes insipidus is a rare condition where you pee a lot and often feel thirsty.\n\nDiabetes insipidus is not related to type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes (also known as diabetes mellitus), but it does share some of the same signs and symptoms.\n\nThe 2 main symptoms of diabetes insipidus are:\n\nextreme thirst (polydipsia)\n\npeeing a lot, even at night (polyuria)\n\nIn very severe cases of diabetes insipidus, a person can pee up to 20 litres of urine in a day.\n\nFind out more about the symptoms of diabetes insipidus\n\nWhen to seek medical advice\n\nYou should always see your GP if you're feeling thirsty all the time.\n\nAlthough it may not be diabetes insipidus, it should be investigated.\n\nAlso see your GP if you're:\n\npeeing more than normal – most healthy adults pass urine 4 to 7 times in a 24-hour period\n\nneeding to pee small amounts at frequent intervals – sometimes this can occur along with the feeling that you need to pee immediately\n\nChildren tend to pee more frequently because they have smaller bladders.\n\nBut seek medical advice if your child pees more than 10 times a day.\n\nYour GP will be able to carry out a number of tests to help determine what's causing the problem.\n\nFind out more about diagnosing diabetes insipidus\n\nWhat causes diabetes insipidus\n\nDiabetes insipidus is caused by problems with a hormone called arginine vasopressin (AVP), also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH).\n\nAVP plays a key role in regulating the amount of fluid in the body.\n\nIt's produced by specialist nerve cells in a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus.\n\nAVP passes from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland, where it's stored until needed.\n\nThe pituitary gland releases AVP when the amount of water in the body becomes too low.\n\nIt helps retain water in the body by reducing the amount of water lost through the kidneys, making the kidneys produce more concentrated urine.\n\nIn most cases of diabetes insipidus, the lack of production of AVP means the kidneys cannot make enough concentrated urine and too much water is passed from the body. This is called AVP deficiency (previously called cranial diabetes insipidus).\n\nIn rare cases, the kidneys do not respond to AVP. This causes a specific form of diabetes insipidus called AVP resistance (formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus).\n\nPeople feel thirsty as the body tries to compensate for the increased loss of water by increasing the amount of water taken in.\n\nFind out more about the causes of diabetes insipidus\n\nWho's affected by diabetes insipidus\n\nDiabetes insipidus affects about 1 in 25,000 people in the general population.\n\nAdults are more likely to develop the condition, but it can occur at any age.\n\nIn rarer cases, diabetes insipidus can develop during pregnancy, known as gestational diabetes insipidus.\n\nTypes of diabetes insipidus\n\nThere are 2 main types of diabetes insipidus:\n\nAVP deficiency (formerly cranial diabetes insipidus)\n\nAVP resistance (formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus)\n\nArginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D)\n\nArginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D) occurs when there's not enough AVP in the body to regulate urine production.\n\nAVP-D is the most common type of diabetes insipidus.\n\nIt can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland – for example, after an infection, operation, brain tumour or head injury.\n\nIn about 1 in 3 cases of AVP-D there's no obvious reason why the hypothalamus stops making enough AVP.\n\nArginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R)\n\nArginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R) occurs when there's enough AVP in the body but the kidneys fail to respond to it.\n\nIt can be caused by kidney damage or, in some cases, inherited as a problem on its own.\n\nSome medications, particularly lithium (used to help stabilise mood in some people with specific mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder), can cause AVP-R.\n\nTreating diabetes insipidus\n\nTreatment is not always needed for mild cases of AVP-D.\n\nYou just need to increase the amount of water you drink to compensate for the fluid lost through urination.\n\nIf necessary, a medication called desmopressin can be used to replicate the functions of AVP.\n\nAVP-R is often treated with medications called thiazide diuretics, which reduce the amount of urine the kidneys produce.\n\nFind out more about treating diabetes insipidus"
