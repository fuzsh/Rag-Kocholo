About oxybutynin\n\nOxybutynin is a medicine used to treat symptoms of an overactive bladder. These can include:\n\na sudden and urgent need to pee (urinary urgency)\n\nneeding to pee more often than usual (urinary frequency)\n\nwetting yourself if you cannot make it to the loo in time (urinary incontinence)\n\nIt's also used to treat bedwetting in children (nocturnal enuresis).\n\nOxybutynin works by relaxing the muscles around your bladder. This means your bladder can hold more liquid and you do not need to pee as often or as urgently.\n\nOxybutynin is only available on prescription.\n\nIt comes as standard tablets for immediate release, or slow-release tablets (also called prolonged release), a liquid to swallow, or as patches.\n\n2. Key facts\n\nOxybutynin may take up to 4 weeks to reach its full effect. If the symptoms do not improve after 1 to 2 weeks, talk to your doctor.\n\nYour doctor will do a review after 4 weeks to check oxybutynin is still working and is the best treatment for you.\n\nYour doctor will also check that your treatment is still needed every 6 to 12 months .\n\nCommon side effects of oxybutynin include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and feeling dizzy or sleepy.\n\nIt's best not to drink alcohol when you first start taking oxybutynin, as it can make you very sleepy.\n\n3. Who can and cannot take oxybutynin\n\nOxybutynin can be taken by adults and children aged 5 years or over.\n\nOxybutynin is not suitable for some people. To make sure it's safe for you, tell your doctor before starting oxybutynin if you have:\n\never had an allergic reaction to oxybutynin, any of its ingredients or any other medicine\n\nmyasthenia gravis, a rare long-term condition that causes muscle weakness\n\nan eye problem called glaucoma\n\ndifficulty peeing, or an enlarged prostate\n\nulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease\n\nheart problems, including a very fast heart rate or high blood pressure\n\nthyroid, kidney or liver problems\n\n4. How and when to take oxybutynin\n\nAlways read the information that comes with your medicine.\n\nDosage and strength of standard tablets\n\nStandard tablets come as either 2.5mg, 3mg or 5mg.\n\nThe usual starting dose of 2.5mg is 1 tablet, taken twice a day, in the morning or evening, or 1 tablet, taken 3 times a day.\n\nIf you take 3 doses a day, space each dose evenly throughout the day. You could take it first thing in the morning, in the middle of the afternoon and at bedtime.\n\nDosage and strength of slow-release tablets\n\nSlow-release tablets come in 2 strengths, 5mg and 10mg. The usual starting dose is 5mg once a day.\n\nDosage and strength of liquid\n\nOxybutynin is available as a liquid for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets. It comes in 2 strengths:\n\n2.5mg of oxybutynin in a 5ml spoonful\n\n5mg in oxybutynin in a 5ml spoonful\n\nThe usual starting dose for an adult is 5mg, taken twice a day (12 hours apart), or 5mg, taken 3 times a day.\n\nThe dose will usually be lower for adults over 65 and children.\n\nIf you take 3 doses a day, space each dose evenly throughout the day. You could take it first thing in the morning, in the middle of the afternoon and at bedtime.\n\nHow to take standard tablets\n\nSwallow the tablets whole with a drink of water. You can take tablets with or without food.\n\nHow to take slow-release tablets\n\nSlow-release tablets release oxybutynin slowly and evenly throughout the day.\n\nSwallow these tablets whole with a drink of water. Do not break, crush or chew them.\n\nTry to take your tablet at the same time each day. This will help you to remember to take them.\n\nPart of the tablet can pass through your body and you might see it in your poo. Do not worry, this is normal and does not affect the way the medicine works.\n\nHow to take liquid\n\nIf you are giving this medicine to a child to help stop them wetting the bed, give the last dose just before bedtime.\n\nOxybutynin liquid will come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you do not have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount of medicine.\n\nHow to use patches\n\nOxybutynin patches are applied twice a week.\n\nThey work like a plaster., you stick them to your skin.\n\nFollow the instructions that come with the patches.\n\nStick a patch to clean, dry skin on your stomach, hip or bottom twice a week (every 3 or 4 days).\n\nChange the patch on the same 2 days every week, such as every Sunday and Wednesday, or Monday and Thursday.\n\nRemove the old patch before sticking on the new one.\n\nStick the new patch to a different area of your stomach, hips or bottom. Using the same area may irritate your skin. Do not stick the patch in the same place for at least 1 week.\n\nWill my dose go up or down?\n\nYour doctor may increase your dose depending on how the medicine works for you.\n\nWhat if I forget to take it?\n\nIf you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's almost time for your next dose. In this case, just skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.\n\nNever take 2 doses at the same time. Never take an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\nIf you often forget doses, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to remember to take your medicine.\n\nWhat if I take too much?\n\nTaking 1 extra dose of oxybutynin is unlikely to harm you.\n\nHowever, you may get more side effects, such as a dry mouth or headache.\n\nThe amount of oxybutynin that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person, and too much oxybutynin can be dangerous.\n\nUrgent advice: Contact 111 for advice now if:\n\nYou take 2 or more extra doses of oxybutynin and you:\n\nhave hallucinations\n\nfeel very restless or excited\n\nhave dilated pupils in your eyes\n\nare not able to pee\n\nCall 111 or go to 111.nhs.uk\n\nIf you need to go to hospital, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you, or to call you an ambulance.\n\nTake the oxybutynin packet with you, or the leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine.\n\nImmediate action required: Call 999 or go to A&E if:\n\nYou take more than your usual dose of oxybutynin and you have:\n\na fast heartbeat\n\nbreathing problems\n\n5.

For a full list, see the leaflet inside your medicines packet.\n\nInformation:\n\nYou can report any suspected side effect using the Yellow Card safety scheme.\n\nVisit Yellow Card for further information.\n\n6. How to cope with side effects of oxybutynin\n\nWhat to do about:\n\ndry mouth – try sugar-free gum or having sugar-free sweets. Having a dry mouth can cause tooth decay or a fungal infection. It also might stop medicine that you put under your tongue from dissolving properly, such as medicine for angina.\n\nheadaches – make sure you rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid alcohol. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a painkiller. Talk to your doctor if your headache is severe or lasts longer than 1 or 2 days.\n\nfeeling dizzy, sleepy or a spinning sensation – do not drive, cycle, use tools, or operate machinery. Avoid drinking alcohol, as this may make your symptoms worse. Talk to your doctor if the dizziness or sleepiness bothers you or lasts more than a few days.\n\ndiarrhoea or being sick – drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash, to avoid dehydration. Take small, frequent sips if you're being sick. Signs of dehydration include peeing less than usual or having dark, strong-smelling pee. Do not take any other medicines without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor, if the effects last more than 1 or 2 days.\n\nconstipation – eat more high-fibre foods, such as fresh fruit and vegetables and cereals, and drink plenty of water. Try to exercise more regularly, for example, by going for a daily walk or run. If this does not help, talk to a pharmacist or doctor. Watch this short video about how to treat constipation.\n\nfarting and burping – eat less foods that cause wind, like lentils, peas, beans and onions. It might also help to eat smaller and more frequent meals, eat and drink slowly, and exercise regularly. Ask your pharmacist about remedies you can buy to help with trapped wind.\n\nstomach pain – try to rest and relax. It can help to eat and drink slowly and have smaller and more frequent meals. Try putting a heat pad or a covered hot water bottle on your stomach to help. If you have episodes of severe, griping pain, speak to your pharmacist or doctor.\n\ndry eyes – ask your pharmacist or optician to recommend some eye drops. If you wear contact lenses and these become uncomfortable, you might have to wear glasses instead while you're taking this medicine.\n\nblurred vision – do not drive or cycle until you can see clearly again. Do not take your next dose of oxybutynin if your vision is still blurred. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist if your vision has not returned to normal a day after taking your last dose.\n\nproblems or pain when peeing – try to relax when you pee. Do not try to force the flow of urine. If it does not happen, try again later. Talk to a doctor urgently if you cannot pee at all.\n\n7. Pregnancy and breastfeeding\n\nOxybutynin and pregnancy\n\nOxybutynin is occasionally used in pregnancy when bladder symptoms are severe and cannot be controlled any other way.\n\nIf you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, talk to your doctor about whether taking oxybutynin is right for you.\n\nOxybutynin and breastfeeding\n\nOxybutynin is not usually recommended while breastfeeding. However, you may still need to take it.\n\nIt's not known how much oxybutynin gets into breast milk, but it's likely to be small.\n\nIf your doctor says it's OK for you to keep taking oxybutynin, monitor your baby for possible side effects, such as constipation, peeing less and colic.\n\nTalk to your doctor, midwife, or health visitor if you have any concerns about your baby, or you do not think your baby is putting on enough weight.\n\nNon-urgent advice: Tell your doctor if you're:\n\ntrying to get pregnant\n\npregnant\n\nbreastfeeding\n\nFor more information about treating bladder problems (urinary incontinence) during pregnancy, read this leaflet on the Best Use of Medicines in Pregnancy (BUMPs) website.\n\n8. Cautions with other medicines\n\nOxybutynin may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how oxybutynin works.\n\nTell your pharmacist or doctor if you're taking:\n\namantadine, a medicine used for Parkinson's disease or for infections\n\nlevodopa, used to treat Parkinson's disease\n\nphenothiazines, clozapine, haloperidol or benperidol, medicines for mental health problems\n\ndonepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine or tacrine, medicines used for dementia\n\namitriptyline, imipramine or dosulepin (tricyclic antidepressants), medicines for depression\n\nmedicines used to make you feel sleepy (sedatives)\n\nanti-sickness medicines like prochlorperazine\n\nmedicines for stomach and bowel-related problems like domperidone and metoclopramide\n\ndigoxin, quinidine or disopyramide, medicines used to treat heart problems\n\ndipyridamole, used to treat blood problems\n\nchlorphenamine or diphenhydramine, medicines used to treat allergies\n\nany medicines used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, incontinence, motion sickness or movement disorders related to Parkinson's disease, that work in a similar way to oxybutynin\n\nMixing oxybutynin with herbal remedies and supplements\n\nThere's very little information about taking oxybutynin with herbal remedies and supplements. These remedies are not tested in the same way as medicines.\n\nSome herbal medicines can make you feel sleepy, cause a dry mouth, or make it difficult to pee. Their effect is similar to oxybutynin. This can increase your risk of getting side effects or make your side effects worse.\n\nImportant: Medicine safety\n\nTell your doctor or pharmacist if you're taking any other medicines, including herbal medicines, vitamins or supplements.\n\n9. Common questions about oxybutynin\n\nHow does oxybutynin work?\n\nOxybutynin is a type of medicine called an antimuscarinic (or anticholinergic) muscle relaxant.\n\nIt works by relaxing the muscle that is found in the wall of the bladder. This helps to increase the volume of pee your bladder can hold and control the release of pee.\n\nHow long does it take to work?\n\nOxybutynin starts to work after about 3 to 4 hours to relax the muscle surrounding your bladder.\n\nHowever it may take up to 4 weeks before it works fully.\n\nIf your symptoms do not start to get better after 7 days talk to your doctor.\n\nTalk to your doctor if your symptoms get worse at any time.\n\nHow long will I take it for?\n\nUsually, you'll need to take oxybutynin for a long time.\n\nAfter 4 weeks your doctor will check that oxybutynin is helping your symptoms. They'll also do a review every 6 to 12 months after that to check it's still working for you.\n\nTake oxybutynin until your doctor tells you to stop. Do not stop taking it just because you feel better.\n\nIs it safe to take for a long time?\n\nThere may be an increased risk of confusion and possibly dementia in people taking oxybutynin, but more study needs to be done. If you're worried about this, talk to your doctor.\n\nDo not take oxybutynin for longer than you need to. Your doctor will check every 6 to 12 months that your treatment is still needed.\n\nIs it safe to take with painkillers?\n\nIt's safe to take oxybutynin with everyday painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen.\n\nWhat will happen if I stop taking it?\n\nIf you've been taking oxybutynin for at least 6 months your doctor may suggest that you stop taking the medicine for up to 4 weeks to see how your symptoms change without it.\n\nSome people find that the improvement in their symptoms continues after the medicine has been stopped. Talk to your doctor if you're thinking about stopping your medicine.\n\nDo not stop taking oxybutynin without talking to your doctor first.\n\nAre there other medicines for urinary incontinence and overactive bladder?\n\nOxybutynin belongs to a group of medicines called antimuscarinics. There are other antimuscarinics that can be used for overactive bladder:\n\nsolifenacin\n\ntolterodine\n\ndarifenacin\n\nfesoterodine\n\npropiverine\n\ntrospium\n\nThey all seem to work just as well as oxybutynin. However, if you get side effects with one antimuscarinic a different one may suit you better.\n\nIf antimuscarinics are unsuitable for you, they have not helped your overactive bladder, or you have had side effects, you may be offered a medicine called mirabegron, which works in a slightly different way.\n\nCan I drink alcohol with it?\n\nTry to avoid drinking alcohol when you first start taking oxybutynin, or if your dose is increased, to see how you feel. Oxybutynin combined with alcohol can make you feel very sleepy.\n\nDrinking alcohol may make you more likely to need to get up in the night to pee.\n\nIs there any food or drink I need to avoid?\n\nYou can eat normally while taking oxybutynin. If you have urinary incontinence, cut down on alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola.\n\nWill I gain or lose weight?\n\nOxybutynin can make you feel less hungry, so you may lose weight.\n\nIf you start to have problems with your weight while taking oxybutynin, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nWill it affect my contraception?\n\nOxybutynin does not stop contraceptive pills working, including the combined pill or emergency contraception.\n\nHowever, if oxybutynin makes you sick or have severe diarrhoea for more than 24 hours, your contraceptive pills may not protect you from pregnancy. Look on the pill packet to find out what to do.\n\nRead more about what to do if you're on the pill and you're being sick or have diarrhoea.\n\nWill it affect my fertility?\n\nThere's no clear evidence to suggest that taking oxybutynin will reduce fertility in either men or women.\n\nHowever, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor before taking it if you're trying to get pregnant.\n\nCan I drive or ride a bike?\n\nDo not drive a car, ride a bike, use tools or operate machinery if oxybutynin makes you sleepy, gives you blurred vision, or makes you feel dizzy, clumsy or unable to concentrate or make decisions.\n\nThis may be more likely when you first start taking it, but it could happen at any time, such as when you increase the dose or start another medicine.\n\nTalk to a doctor or pharmacist if you're not sure whether it's safe for you to drive while taking oxybutynin.\n\nAre there lifestyle changes that can help overactive bladder?\n\nThere are a number of lifestyle changes that may help your symptoms. It's a good idea to:\n\ncut back on drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola, as caffeine can increase how much you pee\n\nnot drink too much or too little fluid during the day, as this can make incontinence worse\n\nlose weight if you are overweight or obese, as being overweight can increase your risk of urinary incontinence – use the BMI healthy weight calculator to find out if you're a healthy weight for your height\n\ntry pelvic floor muscle training (Kegel exercises)\n\ntry bladder training\n\ndiscuss other options for urinary incontinence with your doctor, such as surgery and procedures"
