        "text": "LOW COST GLOBAL DATA FOR IOT\n\nSwarm provides low-bandwidth satellite connectivity for only $5/month using ultra-small satellites in a low orbit. Swarm satellites cover every point on Earth, enabling IoT devices to affordably operate in any location.\n\nSWARM’S SATELLITE CONSTELLATION\n\nSwarm’s satellites orbit at 450-550 km altitude, providing fully global coverage. The satellites are spread out like strings of pearls into a series of distributed sun-synchronous orbital planes. This configuration allows the satellites to maintain reliable global network coverage.\n\nUNIQUELY SMALL SATELLITES\n\nSwarm has the smallest operational satellites in space, at just ¼U (11 x 11 x 2.8 cm). Because of their small size, they cost much less to launch than most satellites, and we pass these savings along to our customers.\n\nVERTICAL INTEGRATION\n\nSwarm designs and builds all the hardware, software, and protocols for our satellites and user modems in-house. Controlling the manufacturing chain end to end allows us to maintain the highest quality service and devices."
