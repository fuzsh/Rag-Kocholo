        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nNeedronix developed a new miniature transceiver for cubesat/smallsat missions [*4]. It allows the use of ham radio (radio amateur) frequencies in VHF 145 MHz and UHF 440 MHz bands. Therefore benefits for radio amateurs were accentuated so that these could participate. The radio is versatile and platform-independent, it is deployable using a standard PC104 Bus, as well as other buses - e.g. Backplain (CSID - Prof. Dr. Klaus Schilling, UNISEC Europe [*5]). The mainboard (as seen in Figure 1 - VHF and UHF transceiver) serves only as an interconnection to different buses thus other satellite on-board systems.\n\nCormorant transceiver utilizes Cubesat Space Protocol [*2] to forward messages to and to communicate with other subsystems, as well as for its own management and configuration. CSP Protocol description is not within a scope of this document. See Wikipedia for basic information on CSP [*1].\n\nPurpose of this document is to provide a brief guide to radio amateurs on satellite identification, operation parameters monitoring and use of digipeater.\n\n2. Transmission description\n\nThe highest priority of the Cormorant Transceiver is the receive mode. It is necessary for the satellite mission that the radio is able to receive under any circumstances. This prevailing mode is only interrupted by a transmit request, which can happen in user-configurable regular intervals, bi-directional communication with the Ground Segment or on-demand from external subsystems within the satellite.\n\nThere are three types of transmit requests:\n\nInternal - Cormorant telemetry, command and data\n\nInternal - Digipeater\n\nExternal - External telemetry, command and data\n\nThe type of request is traceable inside of the message body. More detailed description in chapter 4.\n\nPackets (messages) are encapsulated into higher level AX.25[*3] protocol for ham radio enthusiasts or into CSP Protocol for the service purposes and maintenance. There is a simple rule: if the packet is not AX.25, it is CSP then.\n\nDefault AX.25 telemetric packet interval: 30 s.\n\nDefault morse interval: 90 s.\n\nAny of these timing settings can be changed in-flight by the satellite operators without notice.\n\nDigipeater is always on. It might be turned off exceptionally for the sake of a demanding experiment.\n\nIf your receiver is not set up to display strictly AX.25 messages only, you will see the CSP packets as well.\n\nNote that according to Figure 2, a CSP or a telemetry packet can show up between your AX.25 digipeater packet and a digipeater response to you.\n\n3. Satellite radio link setup\n\nModulation: GFSK,\n\nEncoding: G3RUH compatible, 9600 bps, 8bit\n\nOutput power: max 1W (30dBm)\n\nOnboard antenna: Dipole\n\nAntenna polarisation: Linear\n\n4. AX.25 Basic Cormorant Telemetry\n\nSystem message is a CSV formatted text with a comma as a separator followed by a part identifier (U, R, V, etc.). Messages can be stored, imported and comfortably processed in any spreadsheet.\n\nSystem Status Message Example (this is a real packet captured via radio transmission):\n\nAll numbers represented here are decimal. No other format (oct, hex) is used. COMd - fixed length 4 bytes consisting of 3 bytes device name acronym followed by one additional byte - e.g. OBC1, OBC2, COMd (‘d’ as downlink), COMu (‘u’ as uplink), GPS1 etc.\n\nData packet doesn’t have a fixed structure - the packet is divided by the comma separator to 15 parts - see table below.\n\nMessage items detailed description:\n\nExample from TNC:\n\n5. Subsystem AX.25 telemetry\n\nA subsystem might request its packet to be sent while only the obligatory parameter is a subsystem identifier (e.g. OBC2, PAY1 etc.). Content of these messages is closely subsystem related, for more info search for the specific mission details.\n\n6. Morse telemetry\n\nEvery basic Morse system status message is preceded by its digital copy transmitted in AX.25 protocol:\n\nMYCALL:\n\nis a callsign (OM9GRB for example)\n\nAAAX:\n\nis an identifier of a device/subsystem sending the data\n\nnum1 to num6:\n\nin AX.25 message: uint32_t number in decimal format (i.e. 0 to 4,294,967,295) in Morse message: decimal format of 6 uint32_t numbers (i.e. 0 to 4,294,967,295), but in order to save some transmitting time for the digits, every digit is translated into a less time consuming Morse code (see Appendix I. table - Morse effective digit conversion )\n\nMorse WPS (speed): 20 - can be changed in flight by the satellite operators without notice.\n\nExample of AX.25 message (copy of morse message):\n\nExample of the same message in Morse:\n\nIf the device/subsystem identifier is “COMd” or “COMu”, it is a message originating in the Cormorant radio and num1 to num6 represent:\n\nFor other subsystems identifiers search for the specific mission details.\n\n7. Digipeater mode\n\nA valid Ax25 packet is retransmitted by the digipeater while complying to the Ax.25 digipeater standard of adding the satellite callsign into the Ax.25 header. A delay between receiving and retransmitting of the message is configured to 1300ms and can be reconfigured during flight by the satellite operator without notice. SSID of digipeater is 7.\n\nExample of QSO via digipeater\n\nAppendix I. - morse number conversion table\n\nMorse conversion table - the purpose of this conversion is to minimize the dash ‘-’ count in the transmitted number in order to minimize the transmission time.\n\n9. Appendix II. - NTC temperature conversion table\n\nTable below provides conversion from NTC ADC reading to temperature [°C]\n\nIf you want to use information from this user guide, provide link to this page."
