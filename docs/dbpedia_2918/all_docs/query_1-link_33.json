        "text": "The work performed in this project is part of the Test Satellite student project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Setting up a ground station for CubeSats is a complex task requiring considerable resources and knowledge in several fields. Extensive work and time is required if all modules and parts of the base station are developed from scratch. This work is an effort to simplify the development process by creating a module/building block for receiving, sending and displaying CubeSat data. Communication with the satellites is achieved through a software defined radio. A network protocol called CubeSat Space Protocol is used. The protocol unwrapping software will run as a background process on a web server, continuously listening for data transmissions from the satellite. Communication between the software defined radio framework and the server will use User Datagram Protocol or Transmission Control Protocol. Whenever a packet is received its content should be written to the server, either to a database or to a text file, ensuring a persistent data structure. The data stored to the server shall be accessed through a graphical user interface taking the form of a web page. It is written in Python using the Django web framework, making it easy to extend and maintain. The GUI will also have the ability to send simple commands to the satellite, requesting data transfers or in other ways command the satellite. The commands will be stored as a time tag list and transferred when the satellite is in range. Commands, defined through Django’s administrative pages, are given via a text field. Even though the project is part of the NTNU Test Satellite project the framework is developed to be accessible and allow for uncomplicated integration into other projects. The only required protocols are CubeSat Space Protocol and User Datagram Protocol or Transmission Control Protocol. Our goal is that a module of this kind, if user-friendly in its interface and implementation, may boost the motivation for creating a global network of base stations. Such a network which would ensure continuous contact with CubeSats through their orbits.\n\nhttps://www.ijert.org/satellite-telemetry-tracking-and-control-system-for-nigerian-made-satellite https://www.ijert.org/research/satellite-telemetry-tracking-and-control-system-for-nigerian-made-satellite-IJERTV3IS20156.pdf Satellite Telemetry, Tracking and Control (STT&C) is the brain and operating system of all Satellite or Spacecraft missions. The Centre for Satellite Technology Development (CSTD) in Nigeria has initiated a program known as SPIRE (Satellites to Promote Instructional and Research Experiments) for the purpose of developing an engineering model of a micro-satellite as a prototype to an indigenous development and launch of made in Nigeria Satellite.This study reviews the progress made and necessary components for the design and implementation of STT&C including the important components of the Satellite. Also presented are the design overview and the programming procedure ofTT&C subsystems, while the functions and relationships between various subsystems are discussed.\n\nThe space industry is one of today’s major growth markets and a very interesting business sector for innovation, science, and technology. In the last century, the space industry has dramatically changed and undergone strong commercialization referred to as “New Space”. In addition to the commercialization, the concept of CubeSats has become well established in the market during the last decade. The European Space Agency (ESA) has acknowledged this trend and uses CubeSat nanosatellites for projects like the OPS-SAT mission. OPS-SAT uses state-of-the-art embedded systems for various tasks. These embedded systems are the key for the great mission success of OPS-SAT and provide outstanding computational power for various experiments conducted with the OPS-SAT flying laboratory. This paper describes the fundamental design of these embedded systems and discusses some of the related achievements during the OPS-SAT mission.\n\nIn recent years, nanosatellites have experienced rapid development in light of the launch of hundreds of them in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). As part of the research investigations conducted in spacecraft operations, the Sharjah Academy for Astronomy, Space Sciences, and Technology (SAASST) is currently developing Sharjah-Sat-1. The 3U X-ray Detector CubeSat is set to launch in the second quarter of 2021. A Ground Station control system is essential for communicating with Sharjah-Sat-1 to facilitate receiving telemetry and sending commands. In support of such a mission and future ones, a full-fledged ground station has been built, which can be useful for multiple satellite missions. The ground station is currently operating on UHF/VHF frequency bands with high gain. An S-band dish antenna system is planned to be installed soon to augment ground station capability to support ongoing CubeSat operations. The Ground Station's hardware is composed of several components, i.e., UHF/VHF antennas, a Software Defined Radio (SDR) transceiver, a suitable Rotator with Elevation-Azimuth dual controller, and a Rotator control interface. As for the software employed, it is mainly the Ham Radio Deluxe package that consists of a Ham Radio Deluxe (HRD) satellite tracking, HRD rotator control, and an HRD rig, along with a custom-designed ground station console software for Sharjah-Sat-1 related data and commands. With the implementation of this system, the ground station is fully automated while tracking and can also be remotely controlled. Besides its satellite tracking use, the ground station will provide practical training for university students in anticipation of future small satellite operations.\n\nThis paper discusses in-house designed and developed scale-down DVB-RCS hub along with the performance of the realized hub. This development is intended to support the Satellite Based e-Learning initiative in India. The scale-down DVB-RCS HUB is implemented around a single PC with other subsystems making it very cost effective and unique of its kind. This realization will drastically reduce the total cost of Satellite based Education Networks as very low cost commercially available Satellite Interactive Terminals (SITs) complying to open standard could be used at remote locations. The system is successfully tested to work with a commercial SIT using a GEO satellite EDUSAT which is especially dedicated for satellite based e-Learning. The internal detail of the DVB-RCS Forward and Return Link Organization and how it manages the Satellite Interactive Terminals access to the satellite channel using MF-TDMA approach has been described.
