        "text": "Director:\n\nClarence Brown\n\nA Good Close-up of the Depression\n\nAuthor: aimless-46 from Kentucky\n\n29 April 2006\n\nTaking advantage of Hollywood’s ample supply of British actors in the 1930’s, MGM set this depression-era film in an English department store. But the two stars are American actors Lewis Stone (best known for his appearances as Judge Hardy) and Lionel Barrymore. Barrymore received top billing on the titles although Stone’s part is considerably larger. Both are a treat to watch, especially their scenes together, and the script (adapted from a play) is high brow enough that the mix of British and American accents is not that disruptive.\n\nStone is excellent as Gabriel Service, the owner of a financially troubled up-scale department store headed toward bankruptcy as a result of the depression. A competitor offers to buy the store but will not promise to retain the staff. Service is a very paternalistic owner and wants to do what is best for his employees, but he knows that declining the offer puts the long- term financial security of his family at considerable risk.\n\nBarrymore plays Tim Benton, a 40 year employee of the store who is among the first group of laid off employees. At this stage of his career Barrymore’s standard character was a version of his grumpy and overbearing Mr. Potter from “It’s a Wonderful Life”; the main variation being whether he was a good guy or a bad guy. But in “Looking Forward” he gets to play a meek accountant with total loyalty to Mr. Service and his store. It’s a refreshing change of pace and this unusual performance is a good reason to watch the film.\n\nBoth men have families who for the first time feel the impact of the depression on their life styles. Service has remarried and his new wife Isobel (Benita Hume) is much younger. She is carrying on not so discreetly with another man and obviously just married Service for his money. For some reason the gold-digging younger wife was a staple of the films during this era.\n\nThe title of the film, from a speech made by FDR during the depths of the depression, is explained by the opening credits. The theme is how economic pressures impact personal relationships and aspirations. The early narrative establishes the domino effect of the depression as Benton’s layoff also causes the layoff of a struggling mother who helps his wife on a part-time basis. The upbeat ending illustrates the somewhat “Pollyanna” notion that adversity causes people to rise to the occasion and find new ways to be productive.\n\nThis pleasant little film is well crafted but nothing spectacular. It is a nice time capsule of the depression era, historically interesting not just because Hollywood felt the need to make an uplifting film, but because viewers flocked to the theatre seeking the comforting and motivational messages delivered by this type of entertainment.\n\nUnderrated…\n\nAuthor: planktonrules from Bradenton, Florida\n\n9 November 2010\n\nThis is one of the better Depression era films I have seen, as it not only encapsulated what this period was like but had exceptional writing that avoided clichés. And, thanks to exceptional acting, it’s well worth seeking out the next time it appears on Turner Classic Movies.\n\nLionel Barrymore.\n\nThe film is the story of two men who work at the same old family department store–the boss (Lewis Stone) and a lowly career employee (Lionel Barrymore). Both men are in trouble at work. Barrymore is reluctantly let go after 40 years on the job. No matter how sentimental and loyal his boss (Stone) is, the company is in serious trouble and cutbacks must take place. And, when Stone realizes his company is about to go bankrupt, he, too, is seriously affected. However, what really makes the movie exciting is how their families react to the crisis. While it seemed less surprising how Barrymore’s family responded, Stone’s family was exciting to watch. I could say a lot more–but I just don’t want to spoil it for you.\n\nThe bottom line is that the movie is exquisitely written and acted. It’s also a nice film to offer some hope to Depression-weary audiences–and not in a phoney or formulaic manner. If you enjoy this film, also try “Sweepings–another Barrymore film that is about a company in crisis.\n\nL Barrymore lesser known work\n\nAuthor: ksf-2 from southwest US\n\n28 April 2009\n\nSet in Great Britain, everyone except Barrymore has a British accent. He is a bookkeeper for a large firm, and is let go by the president of the firm. Filmed in 1933, its a statement on the depression, and the lack of available jobs. How timely that Turner Classics shows this now, as this is occurring today all over the U.S. Barrymore is Tim Benton, father to Elsie (Viva Tattersall) and the dashing Willie ( Douglas Walton). Viewers will recognize Lewis Stone as Mr. Service, the head of the firm that fired Benton. Stone and Barrymore had been in Grand Hotel together in 1932. We see the contrast between Service’s family and Benton’s family, and how they are all forced to cut back. The actresses playing the wives, Mrs. Benton ( Doris Lloyd) and Mrs. Service ( Benita Hume) were both from England, and came by their accents naturally. Everyone does a fine job, although it DOES run like a play (on which it is based)…. we don’t really see any character development or emotions… it’s all action-based, and moves right along. Directed and produced by Clarence Brown, who had worked several times with Greta Garbo and Barrymore. Garbo was ALSO in Grand Hotel, which may explain the connection to Stone and Barrymore. One of Barrymore’s lesser known works…. he made Dinner at Eight (and SIX other films) the same year!\n\nStrong Performances by Barrymore and Stone\n\nAuthor: Michael_Elliott from Louisville, KY\n\n27 November 2009\n\nLooking Forward (1933)\n\n*** (out of 4)\n\nExtremely well-acted drama from MGM is a rather depressing tale during its first half only to pour too much sugar during the second part. The film takes place during the Depression as Lewis Stone is forced with the fact that his department store is losing too much money and he is forced to lay off several people including one (Lionel Barrymore) who has been with the company for over forty-years. Soon things are getting even worse and Lewis finds himself nearly broke when someone makes an offer for his store. Barrymore gets top-billing and his name over the title but he’s got a rather small role and only appears at the start and end of the film. The movie clearly belongs to Stone who turns in a marvelous performance and really makes this film worth seeking. The Depression-era tone of the film certainly fits in well today and one can’t help but feel a lot of the messages being said in this movie could be said today. There are some truly depressing moments in this film including the start where Lewis has to lay off Barrymore.\n\nThe acting these two give during this sequence is certainly spell bounding as they both perfectly nail the situation and really make you feel everything their characters are saying. Barrymore perfectly captures the depression of his character early on and then matches the happiness that would later follow. Colin Clive of FRANKENSTEIN fame has a small role here that doesn’t give him too much to do but fans of the horror genre will still enjoy seeing him. The films title was taken from a speech given by F.D.R. and there’s no question that the heart was in the right place even though the final third has way too much sugar than what was really needed. Considering a real Depression was going on, it’s understandable that the studio wanted to say something with this film so I’m sure it worked better back when it was released. Fans of the two actors will certainly want to check this one out as both men give wonderful performances.\n\nDirected by William Dieterle\n\nCinematography Robert Kurrle\n\nLawyer Man is a 1932 American Pre-Code drama film directed by William Dieterle, based on the novel by Max Trell. The film stars William Powell and Joan Blondell. It was produced by Warner Bros. By the time of the release, several actors were credited in the studio, but were not seen in the film. These include Edward Arnold, Harold Huber and Henry Armetta.\n\nPlot\n\nAnton Adam is a lawyer who has just got a client acquitted against the uptown New York lawyer Granville Bentley. Granville offers the poor lawyer partnership and he accepts. Anton’s faithful secretary Olga Michaels isn’t delighted to see Anton disrespecting the law. His downfall comes when he meets the beautiful Virginia, an actress who is introduced as a woman whose doctor has abandoned her and now seeks help.\n\nHelen Vinson\n\nAnton sues Dr. Gresham, but Virginia soon calls him she wants to drop the charges. He responds with anger, which Virginia records. Now, Anton is sued for blackmail and must face a tough jury. He loses his partnership with Bentley and he decides to become ruthless. With only his secretary on his side, Anton returns to his old neighbourhood to set up an honest legal practice.\n\nThe opening of Lawyer Man is uninspiring. What’s this, the great William Powell looking unfashionable? Playing a lawyer named Anton Adam who’s street smart but poor? Outrageous!\n\nAt least he’s got Joan Blondell hanging around, though she’s playing both a nag and a woman named Olga, two of the worst things that could happen to poor Joan. And poor Olga just wants what any good 1930’s secretary wants– her boss’s hand in marriage.\n\nAnton’s got a roving eye, though, and that’s the first thing you notice about the character: he’s got flaws. Big ones. While I’m used to something where men drop their jaws whenever a pretty woman enters the room (see Safe in Hell for all this and more), but watching Anton being so dumbstruck by the female figure is surprising, especially coming from Powell. It’s one of many details that makes Anton worth following for the film, as his joyful naivete comes crashing down around him.\n\nWhat makes Lawyer Man’s rags-to-riches-back to rags story structure interesting is that the ‘back to rags’ section is dictated by Anton’s own methods. After winning a big court case, his opposing council offers to split his office space. This moves Anton and Olga from the poorer sections of New York City and onto the 49th floor of a skyscraper, meaning he both figuratively and literally is moving up in the world.\n\nIn the process, though, he runs up against political boss Gilmurry, who offers Anton the chance to either join in or be destroyed. Anton refuses, and when a beautiful women suddenly starts paying him a lot of mind, he doesn’t think twice about it.\n\nOnly the girl is using him to try and get even with her corrupt boyfriend, Dr. Gresham. When the boyfriend rekindles the affair, he uses her to setting him up. After she uses an amorous phone call to make him sound like a swindler, he finds his reputation in court destroyed.\n\nNow, post 1934, this is where a lot of movies would end. The lawyer gained humility, learned not to chase skirts, etc, etc. Or, heck, sometimes he might retain his dignity and win a victory against the boss, while staying true to his roots and honesty.\n\nNot so fast there, though, as Lawyer Man takes scoffs at that hayseed version of justice and instead has hero decide to be as dirty as the men who brought him down. His reputation in tatters, he rebuilds it by taking on every scumbag client and overcharging the lot of them. This keeps him financially solvent until the prime opportunity to take Gilmurry on presents itself.\n\nUsing intimidation, he not only gets money out of Gilmurry, but a position as the Assistant District Attorney. As soon as he’s appointed, though, he refuses to play ball, and and instead destroys the corrupt Gresham family out of revenge. As soon as he’s finished, he resigns, and returns to his tiny office in the poor part of town. Oh, and he finally gives Olga that ring she’s been eying since act one.\n\nGood, Bad, I’m The One in the Courtroom\n\n“You’re part of the machine yourself!”\n\n“Yeah. I’m the monkey wrench in the works!”\n\nThe main notion behind the second half of Lawyer Man is that doing evil is acceptable in the name of doing good. And, of course, to what extent ‘good’ crosses into ‘satisfying revenge.’\n\nThe film gleefully ignores that line. Powell’s character’s flaws only lie in his roving eye, with Blondell sitting off to the side to needle him about it. After he loses the court case that leaves him as an outcast, they’re sitting in his vacant office, looking out the window when Powell begins his grand speech. What follows is an evisceration of everyone, including us in the audience, as Powell looks directly out from his perch at the window.\n\n“A lot of dirty politicians giving me the bird because they scared me out of their end of town? Not me. Look down there. People. Millions. Every guy for himself. Pushing, shoving, trampling each other, sure. City full of them. Crooked streets– and crooks. Fight, cheat, deal from the bottom. Boost the guy that’s riding high and kick the guy that’s down. That’s what it takes to make good here, and that’s what I’ll give ’em. When they kick you, kick back, only harder. Sock em, and if they can’t take it, that’s their problem. They made a shyster out of me. Okay, I’ll be the biggest, busiest shyster that ever hit this town. If they want rats, I’ll be a rat. The daddy of all rats. That’ll show ’em!”\n\nClaire Dodd\n\nPowell turns to Blondell, and she shoots him this look, which can only be described as ‘cheekily condemning’:\n\nPowell adds, “That’s a long speech on an empty stomach.” Blondell shoots back, “That’s a long speech on a nine course dinner.”\n\nThis scene encapsulates two of the more interesting things here, as we have a movie that lays out how powerful and pervasive corruption is and how it’s the public at fault… but also a film that has a really fun streak of black humor running under the surface.\n\nPowell’s character is ultimately subversive in his actions, and you somehow end up with moments like when he gives a pair of men sent to kill him cake and ice cream. He even wraps up an extra piece for them to take home! Powell sells it all with charm and coolness, and his character is much darker and more human than we’re used to seeing. It’s off-putting at first, but impressive by the end.\n\nLawyer Man is ultimately a playful concoction, where the blind statue of Justice dutifully follows Powell around even when the concept eludes him. Whileit drags at times, it’s worth sticking through to get a great sense of just how bad things seemed at the time.\n\nNot that they seem a whole lot better now. (And we don’t even have Joan Blondell!\n\nDirected by Roy Del Ruth\n\nCinematography Tony Gaudio\n\nA rich railroad tycoon, bored with his marriage (his wife has no time for him she’s too busy giving parties and sailing on yachts) starts seeing a showgirl. This are going OK until the girl’s manager/boyfriend, seeing his chance to make some big money, decides to blackmail him.\n\nUpperworld: Taking It From the Top\n\nI’ve watched a number of movies from 1934 now, but it still surprises me how completely schizoid many of them are. A few months ago I talked about Search for Beauty, a film that painfully embodied both the sleazier aspects of the Pre-Code era as well as the holier-than-though moral attitude that came to define the films in the last half of the decade.\n\nUpperworld manages much of the same feat, but whereas Search for Beauty blended the two elements into one frightening cocktail of madness, Upperworld is a different breed: one half pure Pre-Code immorality and salaciousness, one half prim and proper.\n\nIn fact, the disparity is so jarring that it wouldn’t surprise me if enforcement of the Production Code simply happened halfway through its running time.\n\nWell noted scoundrel of the Pre-Code era Warren William stars as locomotive tycoon Alexander Stream. He sleeps in late, stays up late, and still manages to make deals that changes the course of nations. He feels a little left out by his wife, Hattie, and her burgeoning social life, but he’s still got a darling son and an obscene amount of money to play with.\n\nThis goes in the crapper once he meets Lilly, a beautiful chorus girl who swam out too far from shore. He rescues her, and soon the seduction is on. He visits a burlesque to watch her perform, and then flies her around in his airplane– a pretty impressive trip for the early 1930’s.\n\nUnfortunately, she has a scummy manager named Lou who wants to force Lilly into blackmailing Stream for all he’s worth. Lilly resists, and when he’s confronted by Stream, he shoots Lilly and Stream shoots him.\n\nThe title, Upperworld, is a play on the common idea of the ‘underworld’. It sounds goofy, but you quickly see how it plays into the film at large. While the crime film output of the 1930’s focused on the gangsters and the thugs, as we all know, the people with all of the money make the rules.\n\nUp until Stream pulls the trigger is the first half of the picture, which plays with a lot of ideas of the rich and lazy and a number of interesting nods towards looking at how libertarianism defines Stream’s lackadaisical moral code. His boat’s captain rallies against public beaches, Stream complains about taxes, and he even has a police officer fired for daring to pull him over, etc. While he’s a butterball whenever Lilly shows up, one can’t shake the impression that there’s something nastier that’s going to emerge.\n\nThere’s even one boisterous scene where Warren William dons the disguise of the Big Bad Wolf and sings along to Lilly’s excited piano playing. “Here he is,” the movie says. “One sadistic immoral bastard!”\n\nThen the gunfight. And then we’re in a different film. Nothing set up in the first half pays off, and, in fact, rarely does it make sense.\n\nSpoilers begin.\n\nImmediately after the murder, the film switches gears and becomes about the cop that Stream had fired trying to pin the murder on him. Stream bungles things almost immediately, switching ammunition between guns and trying to make it look like an inexplicable murder suicide. The cop has his number, and even has proof that Stream is covering it up.\n\nAlex Stream is arrested. He turns to his wife, who had recently repledged her love to him… and Alex squarely puts all of the blame on her.\n\nSuddenly, the film is no longer about how childish Alex is. It’s not about him carrying the affair on behind his wife’s back, or the man he killed. He puts the blame for all of his actions at Hattie’s feet because she was too busy to have time for him, and, outrageously, the movie seems to go along with it.\n\nSidney Toler\n\nThis is an extremely Code enforced sensibility muscling into the film. The brief early 1930’s era of liberated women was quickly coming to a close, and the films shift from blaming Stream’s uncomplicated and unsavory personality to Hattie’s desire for fun comes across as reductionist. Especially since Hattie had suffered no moral lapses in the course of the picture!\n\nWorse, the film’s premise about corruption and power is also quickly jettisoned. Police Officer Moran’s investigation is clearly based on getting revenge on Stream for getting him demoted and essentially ruining his life, but since the point of his revenge is to prove the man guilty of murder which the audience knows Stream did commit, it becomes simply aggravating when the film ends with the officer in a jail cell and Stream contently going on his way as if nothing had happened.\n\nEven worse yet, the film’s themes of power and corruption going hand in hand absolutely dispels by this point, so when Moran’s commanding officer accidentally destroys the evidence needed to prove Stream’s coverup, it’s not the film furthering the themes of collusion, but lacks any overt indication one way or another.\n\n“You’re as much of a child as Tommy is!” Stream is told in the film. What Upperworld ends up being about is neither a bully getting his comeuppance nor an adolescent growing up. It’s a kid getting smacked on the hands for stealing a cookie, him claiming he never wanted the cookie in the first place, and everyone praising him for it.\n\nSpoilers end.\n\nEven if Upperworld is schizophrenic, there is some enjoyment to be had. Ginger Rogers, in one of her earliest roles, is fun as the carefree but loving Lilly. She never comes across as cheap or disingenuous, and her enthusiasm is infectious. Warren William also manages the best he can, and could certainly play a cad with a heart of gold in his sleep by this point.\n\nThe other actors are game too, with Andy Devine as the inept chauffeur getting a couple of fun moments. He becomes Stream’s confidant, and explains his theory of picking up women at libraries; there they read too many romance novels and it goes to their head.\n\nAgain, all of that being said, the movie is just a mess. If the movie were a joke, the first half would encompass, “Guess what?” and the second half would proudly announce, “Chicken butt.” That’s what you get from Upperworld.\n\nMary Astor: Most Certainly in This Film\n\nI picked this movie to discuss for the Mary Astor Blog-A-Thon hosted by R.A. at Silver Screeningsand Dorian at Tales for the Easily Distracted. Astor is second listed in the cast, and even gets a number of fun outfits\n\nAnd that’s about all I’ve got for her. She plays the dutiful but frivolous wife, and does about the best that can be done with such an undercooked part. She’s sweet when she wants to be but mostly just an obstacle and hindrance here, shocking considering she preoccupies so little of the movie’s attentions. She probably has less than ten minutes of screen time in the 73 minute film, with Ginger Rogers and her bubbly enthusiasm running away with the film’s best parts.\n\nI’ve seen Astor in other parts– Red Dust and Other Men’s Women come immediately to mind– and she’s always a reliable presence, someone who embodies grace and generosity in her roles.\n\nWhen Upperworld was made, her personal life was preparing for a turbulent change of course. She was a year away from being sued for divorce by her second husband, whom she had met when he had been the therapist attending her after the death of her first husband. This would result in a huge scandal as many of her affairs would be publicly revealed, but the publicity also helped promote her next picture (and one of her best remembered), Dodsworth.\n\nDodsworth is also worth mentioning here as it follows the same plot outline as Upperworld, though in that case Astor is playing the woman who makes the rich man sit up and appreciate life. If you want a studied measure in contrasts between intelligent and sloppy film making, it may be worth to put the these two films together.\n\nProof That It’s Pre-Code\n\nA very blatant extramarital affair is at the center of the story.\n\nThe murders in the film aren’t gory or horrific, though showing how Stream tried to get away with it would be a no-no later on.\n\nSkeezy Lou smacks Lilly around when she pulls a gun on him. From my readings, Ginger Rogers fans don’t seem to like this very much.\n\nLastly, the Burlesque show is really… burlesque-y. Here they are rocking out to “Shake Your Powder Puff”:\n\nManhattan Melodrama is a 1934 American pre-Code crime melodrama film, produced by MGM, directed by W. S. Van Dyke, and starring Clark Gable, William Powell, and Myrna Loy. The movie also provided one of the earliest film roles for Mickey Rooney, who played Gable’s character as a child. The film is based on a story by Arthur Caesar, who won the Academy Award for Best Story for this film.\n\nNotorious criminal John Dillinger attended a showing of the film at Chicago‘s Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934. After leaving the theater, he was shot to death by federal agents. Myrna Loy was among those who expressed distaste at the studio’s willingness to exploit this event for the financial benefit of the film. Scenes from Manhattan Melodrama, in addition to Dillinger’s death, are depicted in the 2009 film Public Enemies..\n\nOn June 15, 1904, the ship General Slocum catches fire and sinks in New York’s East River. Two boys, Blackie Gallagher (Mickey Rooney) and Jim Wade (Jimmy Butler), are rescued by a priest, Father Joe (Leo Carrillo), but are orphaned by the disaster. They are taken in by another survivor, Poppa Rosen (George Sidney), who lost his young son in the sinking. The boys live with Poppa Rosen for a short while; then Rosen, a Russian Jew, is trampled to death by a policeman’s horse after he heckles Leon Trotsky at a Communist rally and a melee breaks out.\n\nThe boys remain close friends, though their lives diverge. Studious from the very beginning, Jim (played as an adult by William Powell) gets his law degree and eventually becomes the assistant district attorney. Blackie is a cheerful, happy-go-lucky kid who loves to throw dice and trick other kids out of their money; he (Clark Gable) becomes the owner of a fancy, if illegal, casino. Though his casino is regularly “raided”, the cops have been paid off and business resumes immediately after they leave. Blackie’s girlfriend Eleanor (Myrna Loy) loves him, but pleads with him in vain to marry her and give up his dangerous life.\n\nJim is appointed district attorney. Blackie, always a supporter and admirer of Jim’s (knowing he is incorruptible), arranges to meet him for a celebration, but something comes up, and he sends Eleanor to keep Jim company at the Cotton Club until he can join them. Jim and Eleanor talk the night away. Afterward, she gives Blackie one last chance to marry her and settle down. When Blackie refuses, she leaves him.\n\nMonths later, Jim and Eleanor meet by chance and start keeping company (she informs Jim that she has not seen Blackie for months). Meanwhile, Blackie kills Manny Arnold (Noel Madison) for not paying his gambling debts. Jim summons him to his office, where he tells him that he and Eleanor are going to get married. Blackie is sincerely happy for both of them. Jim also informs his friend that he is a suspect in the Arnold murder. However, there is no real evidence, so the crime goes unsolved.\n\nThough Jim invites him to be the best man at his wedding, Blackie discreetly turns him down. After returning from his honeymoon, Jim runs for governor of New York. Snow (Thomas E. Jackson), who had been his chief assistant until Jim fired him for corruption, threatens to tell reporters that Jim covered up for Blackie in the Arnold case. Though untrue, this would lose Jim a close race for the governorship. By chance, Blackie and Eleanor meet at the horse track. Eleanor tells Blackie about Snow. Blackie shoots Snow dead in a washroom of Madison Square Garden during a hockey game. A beggar who pretends to be blind sees him leave the scene of the crime. Jim has no choice but to prosecute Blackie. Blackie is convicted and sentenced to death.\n\nJim wins the election, partly because the public knows that Jim is so honest he prosecuted his childhood friend. Eleanor tries to get him to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, revealing Blackie’s selfless motive for killing Snow, but that only makes things worse. When Jim remains steadfast, Eleanor leaves him. At the last moment, Jim hurries to Sing Sing Prison and meets Blackie, together with Father Joe, who is now the prison’s chaplain. Jim finally offers to commute the death sentence, but Blackie turns him down. Father Joe leads Blackie to the electric chair while saying last rites.\n\nA few days later Jim calls a special joint session of the New York Legislature. He reveals how the murder helped him win the election and how at the end he compromised his principles and was willing to commute his friend’s sentence. He then tenders his resignation. When he leaves, Eleanor is waiting for him. She tells him that she was wrong about him, and they leave together to start a new life.\n\nReception\n\nFilmed relatively quickly and with a modest budget, it was expected to return a profit but not to capture the imagination of the public. The picture’s smash hit success surprised the studio and made major stars of screen veterans Myrna Loy and William Powell in the first of their fourteen screen pairings, and also solidified the success of MGM’s most popular male lead, Clark Gable. The film has a Harlem nightclub scene featuring Shirley Ross singing a song called “The Bad in Every Man.” After the film’s release, the lyrics were rewritten by Lorenz Hart as the retitled “Blue Moon“.\n\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $735,000 in the US and Canada and $498,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $415,000.The crowd at Chicago’s Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934, shortly after John Dillinger was killed there by law enforcement officers.\n\nJohn Dillinger Died For This Film\n\nAuthor: bkoganbing from Buffalo, New York\n\n3 November 2006\n\n** This review may contain spoilers **\n\nManhattan Melodrama is a trivial pursuit game all in itself. Consider the number of things it’s known for. 1. The only teaming of Clark Gable and William Powell. 2. The first teaming of William Powell and Myrna Loy. 3. A popular song that didn’t get popular from this film. 4. A famous gangster being shot to death because he wanted to see this. 5. William Powell’s first film under the MGM banner. And I’m sure I might think of a few more later on.\n\nIt’s a very dated piece, but made enjoyable because of the skill of its three leads. Two kids, Mickey Rooney and Jimmy Butler who later become Clark Gable and William Powell, are left orphaned as a result of the famous General Slocum disaster in the first years of the 20th century. One works hard, studies hard, and becomes a successful lawyer and prosecutor. The other works hard becoming the kind of man the first one makes a living prosecuting.\n\nGable’s the gambler and his girl friend is Myrna Loy. Gable is his usual charming self, but with a streak of toughness and nobody crosses him. He runs into Powell at the famous Dempsey-Firpo fight and later Powell runs into Loy. She gets a taste of respectability through him and she likes it. Gable would probably be sore about losing her to anyone, but Powell.\n\nPowell rises to become governor of the state and Gable gets to the top of his profession, the death house at Sing Sing. This is where the film truly turns into melodrama. Powell is a person of exacting moral standards a bit too exacting for my taste. I can’t see how today’s audience could accept the course of action he pursues, for just being TEMPTED to commute Gable’s sentence.\n\nManhattan Melodrama features a song sung by Shirley Ross, The Bad in Every Man. It’s a familiar tune, but didn’t do anything for the film. Composer Richard Rodgers had faith in his melody however and persuaded his partner Lorenz Hart to try another lyric. He did and Connee Boswell recorded it and made Blue Moon a big hit.\n\nOf course the legend of the film is that John Dillinger wanted so much to see the film that he came out of hiding. As soon as it was over he got betrayed by one of the women accompanying him and the FBI gunned him down in the streets of Chicago. Manhattan Melodrama entered into American folklore after that.\n\nI’m not sure today’s audience would feel this film was worth even John Dillinger’s life. If he wanted to see Gable, Powell, and Loy so badly, he should have waited later in the year for It Happened One Night or The Thin Man.\n\nDirected by Roy Del Ruth\n\nPre-Code\n\nCinematography Barney McGill\n\nPlot\n\nKurt Anderson is the ruthless, hard-driving general manager of the Monroe department store. The store is a financial powerhouse because of Anderson’s brutally efficient strategies and autocratic leadership.\n\nWhen a new clothing supplier, Garfinkle, tells Anderson that part of the large first order will be delayed three days because of labor trouble, Anderson cancels the order and instructs his secretary to sue for damages. Garfinkle is ruined, but Anderson doesn’t care.\n\nAfter closing, Anderson discovers Madeline Walters hiding in the store. Broke and unemployed, she is going to apply to work at Monroe’s first thing in the morning. When she finds out who he is, she lets him take advantage of her to ensure she gets a job as a model in the clothing department.\n\nWith the Great Depression cutting into the store’s business, Anderson demands new ideas from his department heads. When Martin West comes up with an innovative idea, Higgins, the longtime head of men’s clothing does not approve, but Anderson is impressed. He promptly tells Martin to go ahead, and fires Higgins. Seeing promise in West, Anderson makes him his assistant. He tells his new protégé that he must devote himself completely to business and nothing else if he is to get ahead; he asks if Martin is married, and is relieved when the answer is no. Anderson, a compulsive philanderer, holds women in contempt, believing that all they seek is financial security and control over their husbands. He views marital commitment as incompatible with running a successful business. However, unbeknownst to Anderson, Martin and Madeleine have fallen in love. He tells her that he cannot marry until his position is more secure, but, on an impulse, does so anyway, though he keeps it a secret from Anderson. This puts a strain on the marriage.\n\nAnderson doubles the salary of employee Polly Dale (Alice White) to keep his nominal overseer, Denton Ross, occupied, leaving him a free hand to manage the store without interference. Higgins tries repeatedly to see Anderson to ask for his job back, but fails. Finally Higgins commits suicide by jumping out of a ninth floor window of the store. Martin is dismayed when Anderson is unperturbed by the news.\n\nAfter the Wests quarrel at a company party, Anderson finds a vulnerable Madeleine alone and gets her drunk on champagne. When she decides to leave, he offers the inebriated Madeleine his upstairs hotel suite to rest and clear her head. After she falls asleep on the bed, he enters the room and rapes her. The next day, an embarrassed Madeleine insists that Anderson leave her alone. During their heated conversation, she lets slip that she is married to Martin. After she quits and threatens to take her husband with her, Anderson tries to get Polly to seduce Martin, but she refuses. He then has Martin eavesdrop on the intercom while he summons Madeleine to his office. Martin learns of the times Madeleine slept with Anderson.\n\nMadeleine unsuccessfully attempts suicide with pills, prompting a furious Martin to confront and threaten to kill his boss. Anderson, facing his own dismissal by cautious bankers afraid of his ambitious plans, dares him to do it, even providing a gun. Martin shoots, but only inflicts a minor wound. When employees dash in, Anderson acts as if nothing had happened. Martin quits.\n\nRoss manages to contact the store’s frequently absent owner, Commodore Franklin Monroe, and gets his proxy just in time for the vote of the board of 40 directors. Anderson keeps his job. He promptly promotes Garfinkle, embittered and now just as ruthless, to be his new assistant.\n\nProduction\n\nWarren William was not originally cast in the lead role, he replaced Hale Hamilton, who ended up playing a smaller part, but Edward G. Robinson had also been offered the lead The film took 23 days for principal photography. Although Alice White had been a major star for Warners at the time that silent films were giving way to sound pictures, but by the time of Employees’ Entrance her star had faded when the flapper craze abated. Her supporting role here garnered good reviews and sent her onto the comeback trail, but a scandal later in 1933 returned her to being a supporting actor.\n\nEmployee’s Entrance: Sorting the Successful From the Failures\n\nI think our antiheroes nowadays have gotten a little too clean under their collars. When I mention the phrase, your mind probably turns to Disney cartoons where the parrot Iago starts to team up with Aladdin, or you race back to The Fast and the Furious series which follows car thieves who live glamorous lives but almost coincidentally end up doing the right thing.\n\nAnd, sure, the 1930’s had their share of gentlemen thieves, with William Powell taking loot and women’s hearts as he pleased, but when the men and women of the 1930’s got nasty, the film’s often followed along. To modern audience’s, Warren William’s Kurt Anderson is a monster, an almost physical embodiment of the tyrannical power of capitalism. He exploits, he destroys, and, at the end of the day, he continues to do so because it makes everyone more money.\n\nThat damns a lot of people along the way naturally. Anderson is the manager of a department store– one of those high class, high prestige places that existed in New York back in the day. In a decade under his reign, the store’s sales have increased more than ten times. He’s ruthless, dismissing senior employees without a shrug and noting, after one jumps out of the store’s ninth floor window, that all men should kill themselves after outliving their usefulness\n\nIf you think Anderson sounds like a bit of a crotchety man, don’t let that fool you. He’s a man of power, and since he’s in charge of hiring, he knows the best way to relax is to trade work for sexual favors. From the female employees, at least. And the male ones… well, we can talk about that more below.\n\nWhen he discovers Madeline (Loretta Young), a starving girl who has tried to spend the night in the store’s model house (one of the movie’s many moments mocking traditional domesticity). He treats her to a feast and, when she tries to make her way to his apartment’s door, he stops her and demands payment for one brand shiny new job.\n\nMadeline begins working as a model for the store, but the incident clearly unnerved her. While she had been flirtatious to Anderson, it’s quite apparent that she fears ever running into him again. Luckily for her, he’s got other matters on his mind for the moment.\n\nWhere the film turns Anderson purely into an anti-hero rather than a unsympathetic creature is by showing us the people he works for. The store’s owner is Franklin Monroe, who descended from the gene pools of James Monroe and Ben Franklin; again, presumably, these two themselves didn’t procreate on their own. He controls the board of directors along with a portly cousin, and Monroe stays mostly concerned with attending ceremonies and vacationing in the Mediterranean. The rest of the board are a number of bloated bankers, who are only happy when there’s plenty of profit for them to roll in.\n\nThe film loves to subvert things, and the American revolution is one of its prime targets. Besides Monroe’s lineage, the often-absent owner continues to send telegrams to the store’s employee’s full of thundering speech and encouragement. He relies on Thomas Paines’ “These are the times that try men’s souls” to refer to the Depression, but it instead reveals an executive who merely continues to buy into the platitudes of the American way with no substantial interest in its actualities. American history is a punchline for the new reality.\n\nAnderson is the epitome of the Depression’s new paradigm, a ruthless businessman who is willing to fight for every dollar. Early in the film we see a bust of Napoleon that fades into Anderson’s hurried face. He’s cruel and heartless, and encourages the same traits in his employees. This is the fate that befalls young Martin (Wallace Ford), an eager to please ideas guy. Anderson promotes him to assistant and demands that every waking moment is spent in service of the company.\n\nBut, wouldn’t you know it, Martin meets Madeline, and after a quick flirtation involving sheet music, they’re married. Unfortunately, Martin’s complete obedience to Anderson, the man who coerced Madeline into sex, kind of puts a damper on the whole thing. Martin keeps his marriage a secret, and things come to a head at a company party. Martin gets trashed and starts singing “Sweet Adeline” and Madeline runs into Anderson again in a side room.\n\nHe gets her completely wasted, and offers her his room key so that she can sleep it off. Promising to be a gentleman, he instead waits for her to fall asleep before moving in. And fade out.\n\nI’ve read a quite a few reviews (check out below if you don’t believe me), and I’ve seen the word ‘seduced’ thrown out a surprising number of times. For the 1930’s, that may have been what this was, but taking advantage of a sleeping woman nowadays is far more taboo. And, yes, this Pre-Code film may end with Anderson left virtually unpunished for committing rape.\n\nAnd, after saying all of this, I did want to note that the film does often delve into comedy… Yes, comedy! There are different vignettes about the usual assortment of funny customers (a Jewish man recoils at a ‘pigskin’ football, a woman asks which floor the basement is on) and Anderson’s antics can sometimes be hilariously nasty. When he pays Polly to practice seduction Monroe’s cousin for his benefit, the two trade barbs with a cruel glee.\n\nThere’s some really clever direction throughout, too. If you go all the way back up to the profiles of the characters near the top of this review, you’ll notice in two of them we’re treated to a hearty side view of Warren William’s wonderful nose. Many of the scenes just gravitate towards William, so most of the movie’s lengthy scenes in his office will either be a full shot of him, or him in the foreground as the person he’s talking to responds. He’s a constant presence here.\n\nAnd it works because Warren William is so good at being able to play just so bad. Every ounce of conscience he claims to have here can be attributed to other ulterior motives, but every joke he makes lands and every bit of egotism he displays seems genuine and earned. He’s a self-made son of a bitch, and I can’t imagine another actor successfully blending such a despicable, angry creature with such understated sadness."
