She was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on May 31, 1929, to Frederick Curtis and D Frances (Cooper) Wasson. Norma was raised in Hartsville, Indiana and was the oldest of four girls. Norma attended Butler University and Minnesota Bible College where she met the love of her life, Robert Stanley Morse, whom she married on August 5, 1950, in Columbus, Indiana. After raising three children, Norma worked as a substitute teacher and later retired from the Marion County Health Department. She was a devoted mother and wife, serving tirelessly in the church alongside her husband. Norma sang, played the piano, taught Bible classes, and cooked at church camp. She was considered \"Mama Morse\" by several who benefited from her compassion, teaching, and encouragement. She showed hospitality to all. In short, Norma loved her family and she loved the Lord.

Joanne Ogilvie of Macon, GA, and Donna Louise (Robert) Torrence, and her children, Paul Stephen (Becca) Morse of Granger, Indiana, Rhoda Elizabeth Elrod of Longmont, CO, and Julia Wasson (Ken) Toler of Littleton, CO.
