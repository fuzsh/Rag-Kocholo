And thank you, Michelle, for bringing it to our attention.\n\nMy husband and I have watched a number of Sidney Toler's \"Charlie Chan\" movies, as well as a couple of westerns he was in. We have enjoyed all of what we've seen, but especially liked his portrayals of characters in \"Heritage of the Desert\" and \"The Mysterious Rider\" both based on Zane Grey novels."
