        "text": "Welcome. It’s been quite a while since I posted a new subject (November 2019). I’ve done a bunch of research on many subjects since then but just lost interest in them at some point and deleted them. In Gloria’s case I managed to stay interested all the way through, so here we are.\n\nI discovered Gloria in Find-A-Grave’s Necrology Page. Her story was interesting enough to make me do some exploratory research. In this process I found that there were many unknowns and many errors. So with that, I got started. I should also mention that I don’t generally get too involved with the careers of my blog subjects if they were actors or actresses. That’s because you can find tons of places online that will comprehensively cover that. I am more interested in their personal lives, not their make-believe lives.\n\nThe phrase I used at the top of the blog, The Luckiest Girl in the World, came from her Wikipedia page. However, I never saw a single thing proving she was ever called that. It was supposedly used in magazine articles about her. If it really was from magazines I’d be a lot less likely to find it than if it was in the newspapers. Update 7 June 2021: I was contacted by Elizabeth over at ClassicActresses.Org and she informed me that the Wikipedia page was incorrect. The phrase was The Luckiest Girl in Hollywood and it came from this magazine article. Thank you, Elizabeth!\n\nGloria Dickson was born as Thais Lelia Dickerson in Pocatello, Idaho on 13 August 1917 to Fred Winfield Dickerson and his wife Emma L Starrett. If you look at Gloria’s name on her birth certificate you’ll see that her middle name is listed as Lelia, not Alalia, like most of the websites and old newspapers say. I’m not sure where or when this started but if you look at her death certificate you’ll also see that her middle name is listed as Lelia and that the informant was her mother. I’ll go out on a limb here and assume that her mother knew her real name. For the rest of the blog I’ll refer to her as Gloria.\n\nGloria’s father was born in Ohio in 1875 and by 1894 he was living in Kansas. He would sell insurance and become a teacher. This was the occupation he listed when he did his 1900 census. It shows him as lodging with a family named Comstock. The young lady directly above Fred in the census will become his first wife. In 1901 he married that young lady, Alberta M Comstock, and they then moved to Denver, Colorado. For the first year or two there he worked as a salesman for a wood-preserving company but by 1903 he had moved into the mining business, and with some success. In fact, Alberta’s father ended up managing the mine. Fred never had any children with this wife and in Denver, on 24 October 1911, he and Alberta divorced. Within the next 2 years he was selling insurance in Pocatello, Idaho. Somewhere during this time he married Emma L Starrett (Gloria’s mother) and in June of 1914, Dorris Starrett Dickerson (Gloria’s sister) was born. Dorris and Gloria would be their only children.\n\nEmma was born in Missouri in 1883. The only evidence of her that I could find anywhere prior to Emma giving birth to Dorris was the 1900 census. This was with her family in Gomer, Missouri. You’ll find the family beginning on line 27. Whenever I write a blog I still end up doing some last-minute research. I was never able to find a marriage for Fred and Emma, but in the process looking for it I discovered Emma living in Denver in 1911 as a clerk at a store. This is the same year that Fred and Alberta divorced. So, was Emma the reason for the divorce or did he meet her afterwards? Regardless, the following year both Fred and Emma were missing from the Denver city directory. They then showed up in 1913 in Pocatello, Idaho.\n\nLet’s get back to Fred for a moment. After his mining business he got into real estate for a bank. This was about 1909/1910 and he only did it for about a year. In later interviews with Gloria she would mention her father, the banker. Well, he was out of banking work well before Gloria was even born. By the 1910 census he had become an insurance agent again, and it was this job that he kept for the rest of his life. If you look at that census you’ll find him at line 53. Also notice that he is still married but his wife, Alberta isn’t there. She is actually living with her father for that census. So apparently they had already separated by this time. You’ll find Alberta at line 91.\n\nSo lets get to the first census with Fred and Emma together. That would be the 1920 census, which they filled out on January 26th. You’ll find them at the top of the page. They are living at 1014 N Arthur Avenue in Pocatello, Idaho. This is where they’ll live until 1926, when they buy a new home just built. Fred says that he owns the house and that he is an insurance agent. After that is Emma, Dorris and Gloria. Yes, it does look like it says that Gloria is 25 years old but it’s really saying she is 2-1/2 years old. After this, I found Fred in the city directories in Pocatello every single year until he died, which wasn’t much later. Fred died on 25 November 1926, the same year they bought that brand new home. When Gloria discussed her father there were a couple of different versions of how he died, like in a car accident. The truth is that he died from syphilis and malnutrition. Fred was buried in Pocatello in the Mountain View Cemetery two days later.\n\nI found Emma in the Pocatello city directories through 1929 and still at the new house they bought in 1926. Sometime between then and April of 1930 they moved to 1030 Elm Avenue in Long Beach, California. This is when they show up in the 1930 census. You’ll find Emma and Dorris at the bottom of the first page and Gloria at the top of the second page. This census shows Emma renting a place for $25 a month ($400 today). Dorris is 16 and Gloria is now 12. The 1931 city directory shows that they’ve moved down the street to 1068 Elm Avenue. In 1932 they’ve moved again. They are still in Long beach but now at 424A E 16th Street. Within two years they moved yet again. This time to 410 E State Street. In 1936 we find them at the same address but now the city directory shows Emma is working as a saleswoman at the R N Hirson’s Women’s Clothing Store. This takes us up to Emma’s 1940 census. You’ll find them at line 45. They are now living at 6626 Franklin Avenue. This is in Los Angeles, not Long Beach. It shows that Emma is not working and that Gloria is an actress and has made over $5000 during the past year. That’s over $95,000 today. She wasn’t rich but she sure wasn’t hurting. Notice also that Dorris is not there. She had gotten married sometime in 1936 but we’ll get to that next.\n\nSo lets go back a bit. After moving to California both girls attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School. This school has been around since 1895 and has graduated a large amount of celebrities, the most famous probably being Cameron Diaz. Dorris graduated in 1932 and became a dental assistant. From 1933 to 1935 she was still living with Emma and Gloria at the 410 E State Street address. Sometime during 1935 or 1936 she married Kenneth J Martinson. They went on to have a daughter in 1944 who later gave them two grandchildren. Ken passed away in 1995 and Dorris in 2006. They are buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park and this is her page at Find A Grave. This news item is a funny story about a really bad day Dorris had back in 1965.\n\nNow let’s get back to Gloria. During high school, Gloria concentrated on acting and after graduating in 1935 she joined a repertory company in Long Beach. Sometimes she made as much as $3 a week! This is about $58 today. The following year, partly to make a little more money, she went to a Federal Theatre Project audition and got the lead in a play. After doing this for a while she was spotted by Warner Brothers talent scout, Irving R Kumin. She was offered a screen test, which she passed beautifully. Two days later she was offered a long-term contract. Rather than get all verbose about this time-frame for Gloria I’m just going to give you links to various news stories about her amazing year of 1937. The numbers of the links are the dates of the articles in year/month/day order. 19361106 19361129 19370118 19370121 19370123 19370209 19370222 19370314 19370323 19370331 19370410 19370610 19370627 19370715 19370729 19370806 19370820 19370821 19371024 19371223\n\nThis brings us up to 1938, but first, one quick trip back to 1937. Gloria had fallen in love with her make-up man at the studio and by July of 1937 they had become engaged. His name was Perc Westmore and he was part of a dynasty of very talented make-up artists, which included all of his five brothers. His father was a wigmaker in England and had created the first ever movie studio make-up department back in 1917. Perc was born Percival Harry Westmore on 29 October 1904 in Canterbury, Kent, England. His parents were George Henry Westmore and Ada Florence Savage. Perc’s brothers were Monte, Ernest, Wally, Bud and Frank. Ernest was Perc’s twin. The first four boys were born in England and the last two in the United States.\n\nPerc had married Virginia A Thomas in 1924 and they had one daughter and then adopted another. Perc and Virginia divorced on 2 June 1937. California issued interlocutory divorce decrees back then, which meant it would become final one year later. As I said earlier, he got engaged to Gloria the month after the divorce (July 1937) and then they just had to wait for the divorce decree to become final. They then married on 18 June 1938 in Santa Barbara, California. Here is a picture from the reception:\n\nWe could spend hours covering Perc and the Westmore family but we need to move on. Two things before we leave 1938 though. First, you might enjoy this blurb about Gloria catching a 632 pound shark and you might be interested in this site about the “House of Westmore”. Lots of good photos there, too.\n\n1939 brought a busy year to Gloria. She had six movies come out and she did some clothes modeling. The movies though were starting to drop in quality. At least there wasn’t any scandals for her that year. I’m not going to get into her movies but since it was a quiet year I’ll put up some news items that you may find interesting: 19390101 19390105 19390123 19390124 19390217 19390420 19390713 19390719 19390813 19390926 19391008 19391016 19391120 19391217\n\nFor 1940, Gloria started the year by separating from Perc. He followed up with a claim that Gloria had gotten lost and was missing. Gloria shrugged it off by saying that he had known all along where she was. By April she had moved in with her mother at 6626 Franklin Avenue in Los Angeles. This was just in time for that 1940 census that we covered earlier. On 17 May Gloria filed for a divorce from Perc, which was granted on 21 June. The irony was that while this was going on she was filming her next movie, I Want A Divorce, which was directed by her soon to be second husband. As for her career, Gloria had four movies come out in 1940. I’ll end this part with this article that sheds more light on Perc and his brothers.\n\nAt some of the websites I saw were claims that Gloria and her next husband, director Ralph Murphy, had gotten married before her interlocutory divorce was final and because of this they had to get remarried. I dug into it and never saw a single document or news story about them getting married before the divorce was final. They did get legally married though on 10 October 1941. Notice that the article states that Ralph claimed he was never married before. Ralph Francis Murphy was born in Rockville, Connecticut in 1895 to John Francis Murphy and Mary J Brazil, so he was 22 years older than Gloria. As far as his never being married, he got married in 1915 in Syracuse, New York to Christine Elizabeth Callahan. They had three children together, the youngest of which was only 13 when Ralph married Gloria. Newspapers showed Ralph and Christine in divorce proceedings as early as June 1938 but I never saw a conclusion. Could it be that maybe it was Ralph’s divorce, not Gloria’s, that wasn’t final when he and Gloria supposedly had to get remarried? As for Gloria, she only had two movies come out in 1941.\n\nGloria only had one movie come out in 1942 and it appears to have been a quiet year for her, but in February 1943 she and Ralph separated. She filed for divorce in February 1944 and received it in April 1944 in Los Angeles. Some websites and news items say they divorced in Reno, Nevada. This isn’t true. Her judge in this news item was a Superior Court Judge in Los Angeles. I assume that the long separation removed the normal interlocutory requirement because one month later, May 1944, she supposedly married her third and final husband in Acapulco, Mexico. This was William Fitzgerald, a former wounded Marine, boxer, and former bodyguard to Jean Harlow. He and Gloria had been seeing each other as early as January 1944. I’m not convinced they ever got married but more on that later. About this time Gloria rented a home at 1930 Haslam Terrace in West Hollywood from actor Sidney Toler. Gloria only had one movie in 1944, and this was a bit part. It would also be her last movie.\n\nLet’s dig into Mr. Fitzgerald a bit. William Antony Fitzgerald was born 18 October 1911 in San Francisco, California to Harry Armour Fitzgerald and Mary Claire Kelly. William grew up in San Francisco until the family moved to San Jose about 1921. The first thing of any note that I found, not counting the censuses, was a marriage license notice in a Los Angeles newspaper. He and his first wife, Janice Meredith Thaxton, got married in Los Angeles on 12 August 1933. The marriage record is in two parts; Page1 Page2. Notice in the marriage record that it shows him as being in the Marines and stationed on the USS Augusta (CA-31). I saw on some sites and family trees that he served on the USS Saratoga (CV-3). I never saw any proof of this. If he was supposedly wounded on Gavutu in 1942 then he wasn’t stationed on the Saratoga. However, if he WAS on the USS Saratoga it’s possible that he was wounded on the ship while it was supporting the invasion of Gavutu or he could have been wounded later near Gavutu.\n\nHis wife Janice was born in 1904 in Brooksville, Florida and was a beautician. Their marriage was apparently breaking down by 1939. I base that off of this story from 1940. It’s a weird story but entertaining. They divorced sometime between 1940 and 1942. William’s 1940 census shows his occupation as a boxer so at least that part of his story is true, however it doesn’t say how good he was. According to some websites he fought under the name of Billy Ryan. This probably started because of this news item from May 1944 announcing that Gloria and William were going to get married. He did fight under the name of Willie Fitzgerald but he wasn’t very good. I found him fighting in multiple states, mostly during the mid-1930’s. Here is a few news items about it: 19341205 19341207 19350111 19351222 19351225 19351226 19351227 19351228 As far as William being a bodyguard for Jean Harlow, there’s no way of proving it that I know of. I did pursue it from the newspaper angle but never found anything.\n\nBefore we get into Gloria’s death I need to give you a synopsis of the lives of the other players in our story.\n\nGloria’s mother, Emma: Emma lived on in Los Angeles and then back to Long Beach before moving some time later to Orange County, which is where she died. She lived to be 92 and got to see her grandchild and two great-grandchildren. She died 5 December 1975. She is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Here is a link to her Find A Grave page.\n\nGloria’s first husband, Perc Westmore: After he and Gloria got divorced it was only one week before he married again. This was to Emma Julietta Burnett. They divorced a year later. The year after that he married Margaret Valetta Davison. Eight years later, in 1951, they divorced. The following year he married Ola Mayme Carroll. This marriage lasted until his death, which was 30 September 1970 in Los Angeles. He was 65. He is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park.\n\nGloria’s second husband, Ralph Murphy: Three days after he and Gloria divorced he married Maryon Curtis in Ensenada, Mexico. They remained married until his death on 10 February 1967 at the age of 71. When I followed him out in the newspapers the appearance of his name trickled to a crawl throughout the 1950s. Here is the link to his Find A Grave page.\n\nIt’s time now to get to Gloria’s death. The last two years of her career had been almost nonexistent but things were looking up. After gaining some weight during the last couple of years, she had been losing much of it. The night before she died she had a conversation with her landlord’s wife, former English actress Viva Tattersall, telling her that she had never been as happy as she was with her new husband. The best news was that she and her agent, Leon Lance, had an appointment the next afternoon (10 April) at a studio for a part in an upcoming movie.\n\nThe following morning she apparently took a nap before the appointment. The fire is believed to have started with a cigarette or match on an overstuffed chair downstairs. Gloria either woke up from the smoke or by her dog, a boxer. She found the escape route blocked by fire. Investigators figured she tried to get to a small bathroom window before being overcome. It was a horrible way to die. William arrived before the fire department and attempted to get to Gloria but the fire was too much to get through. The dog was found in an upstairs bedroom. Gloria was found in the upstairs bathroom and she was basically unidentifiable, except for the blonde hair on the crown of her head. Regardless, Mrs. Toler was able to confirm that it was Gloria. When William was told she was dead he collapsed. The autopsy showed that she died from the flames in her lungs, causing asphyxiation.\n\nWilliam recovered from his collapse and went directly to Gloria’s mother to give her the bad news. Emma became hysterical and was bedridden until the next day. She was then escorted by police to the burned out house to look for any keepsakes of her daughter’s. In case you didn’t look at Gloria’s death certificate early on in this blog, here it is again. One important thing to notice in it is that Emma was the informant and she stated that Gloria was divorced and that Ralph Murphy was her previous husband. Why didn’t she mention William? Was it because they weren’t really married? That would be my conclusion. Of course it could be that she just didn’t like him. Emma went on to arrange for Gloria’s burial and if look at her burial card you’ll see that the total cost was $1241. This would be $18,000 today. Gloria was then buried on 15 April 1945 in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Notice in the obit I just posted that William is listed as her husband. Of course, we don’t know who actually submitted the obit. Here is the link to her Find A Grave page.\n\nSo whatever happened to William? There are several versions and claims out there but what can be confirmed is that he was wounded in the war, met Gloria in 1943 or 1944 and had been a boxer at one time. It’s also definite that on 8 February 1957 he was sentenced in Douglas County, Nebraska to prison for five years for writing a bad $30 check. Sounds pretty severe for $30 but that’s $277 today. He had gotten married to a young lady from Nebraska in Reno, Nevada about a month before he was arrested for the bad check. Apparently he used her bank account. He had written it to the Castle Hotel in Omaha, which was well known at the time for prostitution. The Castle hotel had been around since 1914 and was demolished in the 1970s. William didn’t live long enough to appreciate the irony of this because it was destroyed to build the Douglas County Correctional facility on the site.\n\nPart of William’s story involves serving time for desertion in the brig at Plattsmouth, New Hampshire. Well, the brig location is Portsmouth, New Hampshire. There is a Plattsmouth in Nebraska though. This is part of the problem with William. What little we do know is all muddled. Anyway, he was very ill in March of 1958 and asked for a commutation of his sentence because he was dying from bone marrow cancer. They gave it to him and released him to the hospital. There is also a version that he died from a venereal disease, which ties into the prostitution thing at the Castle Hotel. William died three months later on 30 June 1958. Here is the link to his Find A Grave page. There is a photo of him there but I’m not convinced that’s him so I didn’t post it here. This takes us back to Gloria.\n\nThe newspapers all over the country were loaded with many versions of her death news. I am going to leave you with six different news clippings. Together they pretty much cover all the aspects of the news stories. I’m also going to leave a few more links to other photos of her. The first photo will be a high school photo, which I believe was from her junior year. Enjoy.
