        "text": "Lady Henderson, who has died aged 98, worked with the French Resistance during the Second World War and survived incarceration in a concentration camp after being betrayed to the Gestapo in 1944.\n\nShortly afterwards, both Emmy and Mario Nikis, along with a number of employees of the local Laboratoires Radioélectriques which Mario Nikis ran, were arrested for their work with the Resistance. All were sent to concentration camps; few of them survived.\n\nIn January 1944, Mario Nikis, on the recommendation of the Director of the Ecole Supérieure de l'Electricité in Paris, had been asked by the Maquis to produce transmission posts needed by the Resistance for the D-day landings. With Emmy's full support, he agreed.\n\nSubsequently, when the link-man between the Maquis and Mario Nikis, a Belgian named Claude, was too ill to travel to Paris with important information, Emmy went in his place. She met one contact, but another failed to keep the rendezvous (she later discovered that he had been betrayed and shot). She missed the train back to Clermont-Ferrand and, breaking the curfew, spent a night hiding in a private garden close to the Champs Elysées.\n\nAfter the war, Claude was found to have been the Gestapo informer responsible for the arrests in Clermont-Ferrand, and was duly tried and shot.\n\nFrom Royat the prisoners were moved to military barracks, where they were subjected to further torture and interrogation. Emmy and Mario were kept in rooms on opposite sides of a courtyard, and could see each other through the windows. Every morning she would sing one of his favourite songs to let him know that she was still in good spirits.\n\nAfter D-Day, she was hopeful of early release; but three weeks later all the prisoners were herded into trucks and put on a train for Paris. Emmy met Mario on the train and they were able to speak briefly. He asked her forgiveness for exposing her to such danger. It was the last time they saw one another.\n\nFrom Paris, Emmy Nikis was taken to Ravensbruck, a concentration camp for women in Germany. Here any remaining personal possessions were taken away, and clothes exchanged for striped dresses. Subsequently, she was moved to two other camps, and when liberated by the Allies weighed less than 30 kilos. Desperate for news of her husband, she made her way back to Paris; but Mario Nikis, she discovered, had died on the train to a camp.\n\nIn recognition of wartime conduct, Emmy Nikis was awarded the Médaille Militaire and appointed a Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur.\n\nEmma Lilian Tattersall was born in London on March 9 1905, one of five girls and two boys. Their father, Hugh Tattersall, was a Merchant Navy captain who, after being blamed for the loss of his ship, never worked again; his wife, Lilian, kept the family through her skill as a dressmaker and her flair for playing the stock market.\n\nBy the time Emmy arrived, Viva had met a Russian emigré. Finding herself de trop, Emmy had to fend for herself. She found herself a room and a job, earning enough to keep herself and pay for singing lessons; her dream was a career in light opera.\n\nWithin two years, however, Emmy married a wealthy businessman 10 years her senior. For a time she enjoyed entertaining in their apartment, but by the early 1930s the novelty had faded. Finally accepting that her voice was not strong enough for professional engagements, she left New York and enrolled in a fine arts course at the Sorbonne in Paris.\n\nIt was through a fellow student that she met Mario Nikis. Each found in the other a rare combination of passion and grace. Emmy divorced her first husband and married Mario in 1934.\n\nMario Nikis was the founder and managing director of Laboratoires Radioélectriques, which made electronic equipment for aerodromes. His offices were close to the Eiffel Tower, and he and Emmy lived in an apartment nearby. When the Germans marched into Paris, the factory moved to Clermont-Ferrand; in 1942, when that area too was occupied, the factory's output was diverted to meet German demands.\n\nAfter the war, Emmy Nikis re-established Laboratoires Radioélectriques in Paris, and under her direction the company produced the first radar equipment in France. To achieve this she went to England to buy the necessary parts and was helped by the pioneer of radar, Sir Robert Watson-Watt, whom she and Mario had befriended before the war, when he was sent by the British government to find out if Laboratoires Radioélectriques' transmission posts were in fact radar facilities (they were not).\n\nEmmy Nikis had to grapple with liquidity problems, and at one stage she could not pay the wages. In typical style, she took a taxi to visit a Jewish banker who, partly because of her war record, agreed to advance the cash needed.\n\nShe eventually sold the business, and in 1964 married Sir Charles Henderson, an English businessman living in Paris, who, among his other interests, owned a 30 per cent stake in Maxim's restaurant. Henderson had courted Emmy assiduously for many years, visiting her Paris flat in the morning with a bunch of flowers and staying till the evening; Emmy was chaperoned by her mother who was living with her at the time.\n\nEventually, and only after the death of Henderson's first wife, Emmy agreed to marry him. They moved to Cannes, where their villa in Avenue Vallauris was famous for its social gatherings. Among their friends were Florence Gould, Maria Gulbenkian, Eve Price, Dolly Burns (the great hostess and daughter of Lord Duveen) and the scientist Lord Bowden.\n\nThe Hendersons travelled extensively, and enjoyed welcoming friends and relatives to stay with them in Cannes. They were active in charity work - Sir Charles was for many years chairman of the British American hospital in Nice. Unable to have children, Emmy poured her strong nurturing instincts into caring for others, including her elderly mother, whom she nursed lovingly to the end; she did the same for Sir Charles, who died in 1974.\n\nFor many years Lady Henderson never spoke about her wartime experiences; but a bust of Mario Nikis stood in the hall of her villa, with his medals - posthumously, he had been awarded a Croix de Guerre and the Légion d'honneur - lying beside it with hers.\n\nWhen the BBC invited her to appear in a television programme about four English people who had spent the war years in France, they took her back to Clermont-Ferrand; as she revisited the places associated with her ordeal, she gave an account on camera of her experience. She told the interviewer that, although one could never forget, one should learn to forgive.\n\nUntil her mid-nineties, she led a busy life, continuing to travel widely. In Cannes she was a familiar sight at the wheel of her red Mercedes sports car. She played bridge and golf, and began each day with a swim in the Mediterranean."
