        "text": "Names are one of the simplest means of distinguishing between two individuals. They can be considered near universal, and provide a robust means for indirect interaction. Heritable surnames serve both commercial and state based interests. They are a means to enforce primogeniture, and have historically been associated with the inheritance of property. They also act as a tool of the state to enforce actions against particular ethnic or familial groups, while ensuring obligations and entitlements are limited to those eligible. Within the scholarly tradition of the new institutional economics of history, along with the property rights literature exemplified respectively by Demsetz (1964, 1967) as well as Riker and Sened (1991), this paper examines the proliferation of heritable surnames after the Norman invasion of 1066, to determine their commercial and administrative origins. In the English example, surnames were adopted rapidly by major landholders, seeking to bolster their ability to pass on property to heirs in the face of often arbitrary actions by the king. The process was substantially slower for lower classes, with the calculation and enforcement of taxation obligations playing a major role in their use by these groups.\n\nThe colonies of York, VA, Plymouth Colony, and Port Royal, Jamaica in the late seventeenth century had very different economies and populations. The probate inventories of the time reflected the diversity between these three settlements. As we study the emergence of gentility into colonial life, it is of interest to see if the genteel items that became so popular in the colonies during the eighteenth century had begun to make their way into the colonies as early as the late seventeenth century. It is also of interest that those of a more middle class income level during the eighteenth century became enamored with having the air of gentility and the acquisition of items that helped give this impression of gentility became quite popular among them. However, gentility in some form may have begun its emergence into the middle class as early as the late seventeenth century. With this in mind, I will compare and contrast middle class probates from each of these three colonies of Plymouth, York, and Port Royal during the 1680s in an attempt to discover if the acquisition of items making one seem more refined into this class had begun in any way and what role the location may have had."
