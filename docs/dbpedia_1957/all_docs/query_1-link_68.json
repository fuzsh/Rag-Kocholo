He lived his life and raised his family with his loving wife, Reneau, by his side in Statesboro. Born May 22, 1949, in Electra, Texas, his parents, the Reverend Warren and Bessie Tompkins, raised him to have a sincere love for the Lord.\n\nOn the day of his birth, there was a terrible storm raging. His mother was ushered to the hospital's basement and as the tornado alarms sounded, David entered this world. At the early age of two weeks, his mother and daddy took him fishing and this joy continued throughout his entire life. He spent many wonderful hours on the Ogeechee River and the Savannah River, spending good times with family and friends. He loved the world God created, appreciating all that the Lord had given him, and spent his life letting God's light shine through him.\n\nIn March of 1958, the Reverend W. F. Tompkins was called to Bible Baptist Church in Statesboro, where he served as pastor for 36 years. David grew up knowing and serving the Lord from a very young age. At the age of 15, he started leading the choir and congregation in singing and this continued throughout his life, ending at Temple Baptist Church, where he served in many capacities, including being a deacon. David's strong faith continued even in his long illness.\n\nIn the same month and year that the Tompkins family moved to Statesboro, Reneau's family moved to Statesboro as well. Their lives touched many times over the years, but in high school, they really got to know one another and eventually fell in love. They married the year after graduation on January 10, 1971, because they just could not wait to start their life together. They celebrated everything and through David's success at Liberty National Insurance Company, they enjoyed many trips and awards.\n\nTogether they raised three children, Farris, who married Diana Currin; Luci, who married Chris Harvey of Hiawassee; and Abbi, who married Clay Barker of Suwanee. They were blessed with five grandchildren, Emerson and Olivia Tompkins and Emmaleigh, Annabelle and Sierra Harvey.\n\nIn addition to his immediate family, David is survived by his brother-in-law and sister-in-law, David and Paulette Blankenship of Eastman; niece, Amanda Payne of Dublin; aunt, Mrs. Nell Hall of Green Cove Springs, Fla.; and many nieces, nephews and cousins.\n\nDavid was preceded in death by his parents, two sisters and his father-in-law and mother-in-law, Carroll and Mozelle Blankenship.\n\nThe funeral service will be held 11 a.m. Wednesday, January 11, 2017, at Temple Baptist Church with the Reverend Jim Creel officiating.
