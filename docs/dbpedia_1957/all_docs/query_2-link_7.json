        "text": "Jeanette MacDonald said:\n\n\"I've been told I have an Irish temper, I know I have Scottish thrift, and, like the English, I love a good show.\"\n\n\"I can't believe how blessed I am! I'm married to the most wonderful man, Gene Raymond, whom I'm deeply in love with, and, my career is right where I want it to be. I can live like this forever!\" (1943)\n\n\"I must have had rocks in my head,\" when asked by friend Samuel Griffin in the 1950s why she married Gene Raymond instead of Nelson Eddy.\n\n---------------------\n\nGene Raymond said:\n\nOn Jeanette MacDonald and their marriage (1972): \"We had 28 glorious years. Jeanette and I respected and loved each other, very deeply. We put one another before anyone or anything. I am blessed to have known her, loved her and been loved by her - absolutely, an incredible lady!\"\n\n\"Gene, is the most wonderful man I've ever known. He's warm, sensitive, loving, funny and very handsome. Being Mrs. Gene Raymond, I admit I'm biased!\" - Jeanette MacDonald (1947)\n\nNelson Eddy said:\n\n\"I don't know why people still want to believe that Jeanette MacDonald and I were a couple off the set. There's no truth to that rumor, at all. She's happily married to Gene Raymond and I'm happily married to Anne. I guess people want to believe that what they see on the screen is reality while in actuality, it's just a movie!\" (1957)\n\nWhat was it about his movies that he didn't watch them: \"Simply because I was too ashamed of them.\"\n\nCommented during a nightclub tour: \"I want to keep going till I drop.\" (1960s)\n\n********************************\n\nJane Powell said:\n\nHer role model and favorite actress is the lyrical soprano/actress, Jeanette MacDonald\n\n\"I didn't quit movies. They quit me.\"\n\n\"The only thing I knew was MGM, where I had worked since I was 14. Unions were not even a part of my vocabulary. SAG meant a gravity problem. EQUITY meant owning a house.\"\n\nWilliam Holden said:\n\nFor me, acting is not an all-consuming thing, except for the moment when I am actually doing it.\n\nTake any picture you can. One out of four will be good, one out of ten will be very good, and one out of 15 will get you an Academy Award.\n\nMovie acting may not have a certain kind of glory as true art, but it is damn hard work.\n\nI don't really know why, but danger has always been an important thing in my life - to see how far I could lean without falling, how fast I could go without cracking up.\n\nI'm a whore, all actors are whores. We sell our bodies to the highest bidder.\n\n[on Barbara Stanwyck] Thirty-nine years ago this month, we were working in a film together called Golden Boy (1939). It wasn't going so well and I was going to be replaced. But due to this lovely human being and her encouragement and above all her generosity, I'm here tonight.\n\n[on working with Clint Eastwood on Breezy (1973)] He's even-tempered -- a personality trait not much in evidence among directors. The crew is totally behind him and that really helps things go smoothly.\n\nI found the jungle a beautiful and fascinating place to be, I like to come here because I want to stay away from the jungle as much as I can.\n\nRandolph Scott said:\n\nThey have been the mainstay of the industry ever since its beginning. And they have been good to me. Westerns are a type of picture which everybody can see and enjoy. Westerns always make money. And they always increase a star's fan following.\n\n[in 1962] All the old movies are turning up on television, and frankly, making pictures doesn't interest me too much any more.\n\nFrankly, I don't like publicity. I always remember something that David Belasco said and had incorporated in the contracts of his stars. His theory was, \"Never let yourself be seen in public unless they pay for it\". To me, that makes sense. The most glamorous, the most fascinating star our business ever had was Garbo [Greta Garbo]. Why? Because she kept herself from the public. Each member of the audience had his own idea of what she was really like. But take the other stars of today. There is no mystery about them. The public knows what kind of toothpaste they use, whether they sleep in men's pajamas and every intimate fact of their lives. When I read publicity about them, I can tell just which press agent they employ.\n\nJack Hawkins said:\n\n\"I adored it from the first moment. The excitement, the thrill, the smell of the theatre went right down to one's toes.\"\n\n\"Above all, I was taught to love and respect words. Each word had to be the right word; and each had to be spoken in a way that its weight and importance demanded.\"\n\n\"I think that no actor should take Hollywood too seriously; but at the same time it would be wrong to underestimate its professionalism. Really, Hollywood is a caricature of itself, and in particular this is true of the front-office types at the studios. Their enthusiasm towards you is measured precisely to match the success of your last film.\"\n\nJean Arthur said:\n\nI guess I became an actress because I didn't want to be myself.\n\nI am not an adult, that's my explanation of myself. Except when I am working on a set, I have all the inhibitions and shyness of the bashful, backward child . . . unless I have something very much in common with a person, I am lost. I am swallowed up in my own silence.\n\nThe fact that I did not marry George Bernard Shaw is the only real disappointment I've had.\n\n[on Hollywood] I hated the place - not the work, but the lack of privacy, those terrible prying fan magazine writers and all the surrounding exploitation.\n\nIf people don't like your work, all the still pictures in the world can't help you and nothing written about you, even oceans of it, will make you popular.\n\n(on doing interviews) Quite frankly, I'd rather have my throat slit.\n\nI bumped into every kind of disappointment, and was frustrated at every turn. Roles promised me were given to other players, pictures that offered me a chance were shelved, no one was particularly interested in me, and I had not developed a strength of personality to make anyone believe I had special talents. I wanted so desperately to succeed that I drove myself relentlessly, taking no time off for pleasures, or for friendships - yet aiming at the stars, I was still floundering.\n\nFirst I played ingénues and western heroines; then I played western heroines and ingénues. That diet of roles became as monotonous as a diet of spinach. The studio wouldn't trust me with any other kind of role, because I had no experience in any other kind. And I didn't see how I was ever going to acquire any other experience if I couldn't get any other kind of role. It was a vicious circle.\n\nIt's hardly fair for women to do the same things at the same hours every day of their lives, while men have new experiences, meet new people every day. I felt that way as a little girl, with two older brothers around the house. It seemed to me that they led adventurous lives, compared with mine. I felt cheated and frustrated. I became a tomboy in self-defense. I decided that I was going to do things that were exciting, or at least interesting.\n\n[speaking in in the 1930s] I've never had a single close intimate girlfriend in all my life. I never had a chum to whom I could confide my secrets. I suppose that accounts for the fact that now it is so painfully difficult for me to open my heart and confide in people who are, so often, almost strangers. You have to learn so very young to open your heart.\n\n[on her early acting days] My very \"naturalness\" was my undoing. I had to learn that to appear natural on the screen requires a vast amount of training, that is the test of an actor's art. It would be more spectacular if I could say that out of the hurt and humiliation of that failure was born a determination to success, to prove I had the makings of an actress. But it wouldn't be true. That urge came later.\n\n[on her first marriage, which only lasted a day] Julian [Julian Anckner] looked a lot like Abraham Lincoln, and that's probably why I fell in love with him. One day we were out driving and he suddenly said, \"Hey, why don't we get married?\" So we lied about our ages and got married in a sheriff's office. You should have heard our families' reactions - all sorts of screaming and shouting and carrying on about suicide. Well, neither Julian nor I had enough income to make it possible for us to live together, so our marriage lasted one day.\n\n[on making Only Angels Have Wings (1939)] I loved sinking my head into Cary Grant's chest.\"\n\nJoseph Cotton said:\n\n\"I didn't care about the movies really. I was tall. I could talk. It was easy to do\".\n\n\"Orson Welles lists Citizen Kane (1941) as his best film, Alfred Hitchcock opts for Shadow of a Doubt (1943) and Sir Carol Reed chose The Third Man (1949) - and I'm in all of them.\"\n\n[on Orson Welles] \"I know a little about Orson's childhood and seriously doubt if he ever was a child.\"\n\n\"My wife told me one of the sweetest things one could hear - 'I am not jealous. But I am truly sad for all the actresses who embrace you and kiss you while acting, for with them, you are only pretending.'\"\n\nLoretta Young said:\n\n\"Every time she 'sins,' she builds a church. That's why there are so many Catholic churches in Hollywood.\" - Marlene Dietrich\n\n\"Wearing the correct dress for any occasion is a matter of good manners.\"\n\n\"I believe that if we have lived our lives fully and well, and have accomplished, at least in part, the things we were put here to do, we will be prepared - mentally, physically and spiritually - for our separation from this world.\"\n\n\"Our human connections are guided by God, and ultimately all of us are linked through His love. Thus, we have all already met, not as actress and fan but as His children, and we can never be lost to each other.\"\n\n\"What you don't know intrigues you more than what you do know. I believed all those love stories - the hero was the hero - because that's what I grew up with. I loved the romance and the roses, but when it came to a more realistic life, I would back away.\"\n\n\"If you want a place in the sun, you have to expect a few blisters.\"\n\n\"The easiest way to crush your laurels is to lean on them.\"\n\nA charming woman is a busy woman\n\nA charming woman... doesn't follow the crowd. She is herself.\n\nA face is like the outside of a house, and most faces, like most houses, give us an idea of what we can expect to find inside.\n\nA face that is really lovely in repose can fall apart if, when its owner stars to talk, she distorts every feature.\n\nA pleasant voice, which has to include clear enunciation, is not only attractive to those who hear it... its appeal is permanent.\n\nRosalind Russell said:\n\n\"Acting is standing up naked and turning around very slowly.\"\n\n\"Success is a public affair. Failure is a private funeral.\"\n\n\"At MGM there was a first wave of top stars, and a second wave to replace them in case they got difficult. I was second in line of deference, behind Myrna Loy.\"\n\n\"Flops are part of a life's menu and I've never been a girl to miss out on any of the courses.\"\n\n\"In all those types of films I wore a tan suit, a grey suit, a beige suit and then a negligee for the seventh reel near the end when I would admit to my best friend on the telephone that what I really wanted was to become a little housewife.\"\n\n\"Taste. You cannot buy such a rare and wonderful thing. You can't send away for it in a catalogue. And I'm afraid it's becoming obsolete.\"\n\n\"Taking joy in life is a woman's best cosmetic.\"\n\nIrene Dunne Said:\n\n\"No triumph of either my stage or screen career has ever rivaled the excitement of trips down the Mississippi on the river boats with my father.\"\n\n\"[Comedy] demands more timing, pace, shading and subtlety of emphasis. It is difficult to learn but once it is acquired it can be easily slowed down and becomes an excellent foundation for dramatic acting.\"\n\n\"Whenever I have to weep for the cameras, I prefer to cry real tears..., provided I have enough time to recover my emotions before I make the 'take'. But if I have to do another and greatly different scene afterward...it frequently is easier on my emotions just to put glycerine or some other tear substitute in my eyes.\"\n\n\"When we have learned to love our neighbor, not just ourselves, no matter where we come from, then America will be perfect.\"\n\n\"Trying to build the brotherhood of man without the Fatherhood of God is like having the spokes of a wheel without the hub.\"\n\n\"I don't know why the public took a liking me so fast. Popularity is a curious thing. The public responds to a dimple, a smile, a giggle, a hairstyle, an attitude. Acting talent has less to do with it than personality.\"\n\n\"I appeared with many leading men. But working with Cary Grant was different from working with other actors - he was much more fun! I think we were a successful team because we enjoyed working together tremendously, and that pleasure must have shown through onto the screen ... I will always remember two compliments he made me. He said I had perfect timing in comedy and that I was the sweetest-smelling actress he ever worked with.\"\n\n\"I love beautiful things, but a woman who considers herself best dressed usually spends all of her time at it.\"\n\nJames Garner Said:\n\n\"About everything I ever have done, in the way of lawsuits against studios, I've won them all, because I was right every time.\"\n\n\"Marriage is like the Army; everyone complains, but you'd be surprised at the large number of people who re-enlist.\"\n\n[Asked if he would ever do a nude scene] \"I don't do horror films.\"\n\n\"They really stuck it to me. I was young and dumb. I said a couple things about being under contract that they didn't like, like that I felt like a ham in a smokehouse. They were waiting to get back at me by laying me off. We went to court and got out of my contract. I didn't want somebody in an office guiding my career. If I had a failure, I wanted it to be my failure. If I had a success, I wanted it to be my success.\" [on his conflicts with Warner Brothers, in relation to his contractual obligations to the \"Bret Maverick\" (1981) TV series]\n\n\"I'm a Spencer Tracy-type actor. His idea was to be on time, know your words, hit your marks and tell the truth. Most every actor tries to make it something it isn't [or] looks for the easy way out. I don't think acting is that difficult if you can put yourself aside and do what the writer wrote.\"\n\n\"I don't like to speak in public. It scares the devil out of me.\"\n\n\"I got into the business to put a roof over my head. I wasn't looking for star status. I just wanted to keep working.\"\n\n\"I came from Oklahoma. I was born and raised in the Depression. Now, you want to put some pressure on somebody, well, live through the Depression. In Oklahoma. In the dust. And then the flood followed... So studio executives don't bother me at all.\"\n\nJoan Hackett Said:\n\nShe always loved to sleep, and her tombstone carries an admonition not to wake her while she's getting her beauty sleep; \"Go Away - I'm Asleep\"\n\nAnn Todd said:\n\n\"I don't really consider myself an actress. I don't think I ever act. The parts I have played in my career that have come off best have usually been a continuation of myself.\"\n\nJames Mason said:\n\n\"How do I wish to be remembered, if at all? I think perhaps just as a fairly desirable sort of character actor.\"\n\n\"I'm a character actor: the public never knows what it's getting by way of a Mason performance from one film to the next. I therefore represent thoroughly insecure investment.\"\n\nGreta Garbo said:\n\n\"There is no one who would have me...I can't cook.\"\n\n\"Being a movie star, and this applies to all of them, means being looked at from every possible direction. You are never left at peace, you're just fair game.\"\n\n\"You don't have to be married to have a good friend as your partner for life.\"\n\n\"I wish I were supernaturally strong so I could put right everything that is wrong.\"\n\n\"Life would be so wonderful if we only knew what to do with it.\"\n\n\"Anyone who has a continuous smile on his face conceals a toughness that is almost frightening.\"\n\n\"I never said, 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be left alone.' There is a whole world of difference.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be a silly temptress. I cannot see any sense in getting dressed up and doing nothing but tempting men in pictures.\"\n\n\"The story of my life is about back entrances, side doors, secrets elevators and other ways of getting in and out of places so that people won't bother me.\"\n\n\"If only those who dream about Hollywood knew how difficult it all is.\"\n\n\"Your joys and sorrows. You can never tell them. You cheapen the inside of yourself if you do.\" \"There are some who want to get married and others who don't. I have never had an impulse to go to the altar. I am a difficult person to lead.\"\n\n[When asked in her later years by a fan if she is Greta Garbo]: \"I * was* Greta Garbo.\"\n\n\"Gimme a whiskey with ginger ale on the side and don't be stingy, baby.\" -- Garbo's classic opening line from her very first talking film \"Anna Christie\"\n\n\"If you're going to die on screen, you've got to be strong and in good health.\"\n\n\"There are many things in your heart you can never tell another person. They are you, your private joys and sorrows, and you can never tell them. You cheapen yourself, the inside of yourself, when you tell them.\"\n\n\"What, when drunk, one sees in other women, one sees in Garbo sober.\"\n\n\"I live like a monk: with one toothbrush, one cake of soap, and a pot of cream.\"\n\nSidney (Charlie Chan II) Toler did:\n\nHe and wife Viva Tattersall co-wrote a Broadway play entitled \"Ritzy\" in 1930, years before they married. Toler also directed.\n\nBasil Rathbone said:\n\n\"When you become the character you portray, it's the end of your career as an actor.\"\n\n\"Never regret anything you have done with a sincere affection; nothing is lost that is born of the heart.\"\n\nAnn Sheridan said:\n\n\"I used to go to Grauman's Chinese or Pantages and sit there waiting to see my faceless body on the screen. Texas began to look awfully near and awfully good, and 'Clara Lou' had a sweet sound to my ears.\"\n\n\"I can whistle through my fingers, bulldog a steer, light a fire with two sticks, shoot a pistol with fair accuracy, set type, and teach school...\"\n\n\"They nicknamed me the Oomph Girl, and I loathe that nickname! Just being known by a nickname indicates that you're not thought of as a true actress....It's just crap! If you call an actress by her looks or a reaction, then that's all she'll ever be thought of as.\"\n\nGene Kelly said:\n\n\"I wasn't nice to Debbie. It's a wonder she still speaks to me.\" - On his working experience with Debbie Reynolds while filming Singin' in the Rain (1952)\n\n\"There was no model for what I tried to do with dance...And the thing Fred Astaire and I used to bitch about was that critics didn't know how to categorize us. They called us tap dancers because that was considered the American style. But neither of us were basically tap dancers.\"\n\nThe contract system at Hollywood studios like MGM \"was a very efficient system in that because we were at the studio all the time we could rehearse a lot. But it also really repressed people. There were no union regulations yet and we were all indentured servants -- you can call us slaves if you want -- like ball players before free agency. We had seven-year contracts but every six months the studio could decide to fire you if your picture wasn't a hit. And if you turned down a role, they cut off your salary and simply added the time to your contract.\"\n\n\"Kids talk to me and say they want to do musicals again because they've studied the tapes of the old films. We didn't have that. We thought once we had made it, even on film, it was gone except for the archives.\"\n\n\"I arrived in Hollywood twenty pounds overweight and as strong as an ox. But if I put on a white tails and tux like Astaire, I still looked like a truck driver\".\n\n\"If Fred Astaire is the Cary Grant of dance, I'm the Marlon Brando\".\n\n\"I never wanted to be a dancer. It's true! I wanted to be a shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates.\"\n\n\"Fred Astaire represented the aristocracy, I represented the proletariat.\"\n\n\"There is a strange sort of reasoning in Hollywood that musicals are less worthy of Academy consideration than dramas. It's a form of snobbism, the same sort that perpetuates the idea that drama is more deserving of Awards than comedy.\"\n\n\"I took it as it came and it happened to be very nice.\"\n\nClaire Trevor said:\n\n\"Using one's imagination to the fullest is necessary for a happy life.\"\n\n\"Don't fall in love with your leading man. Of course, that's just what I did.\"\n\n\"I don't know what they call Hollywood anymore. The whole meaning of the town has changed.\"\n\n\"What a holler would ensue if people had to pay the minister as much to marry them as they have to pay a lawyer to get them a divorce.\"\n\n************************\n\nGlenn Ford said:\n\n\"When I'm on camera, I have to do things pretty much the way I do things in everyday life. It gives the audience someone real to identify with.\"\n\n\"People laugh when I say I'm not an actor, but I'm not, I play myself.\"\n\n\"The Western is a man's world and I love it.\"\n\n\"I've never played anyone but myself on screen.\"\n\n\"If they tried to rush me, I'd always say I've only got one other speed, and it's slower.\"\n\n************************\n\nMary Astor said:\n\n\"A painter paints, a musician plays, a writer writes - but a movie actor waits.\"\n\n\"I was never totally involved in movies. I was just making my father's dream come true.\"\n\n\"It's not good to make sentimental journeys. You see the differences instesd of the sameness.\"\n\n\"I was as two-dimensional as the screen itself: cool, indifferent, looking lovely in close ups. Period. Period. Period. When was I ever going to learn to act? You can't learn if you can't experiment and find out what works and doesn't work. But the hours are long, the schedule rigid, so I did what I was told and saved time and money for the front office. And got a lot of jobs that way.\"\n\n\"Once you start asking questions, innocence is gone.\"\n\n\"A person without memory is either a child or an amnesiac. A country without memory is neither a child nor an amnesiac, but neither is it a country.\"\n\n\"George S. Kaufman was the kind of man I'd go over a cliff for.\"\n\n\"There are five stages in the life of an actor: Who's Mary Astor? Get me Mary Astor. Get me a Mary Astor Type. Get me a young Mary Astor. Who's Mary Astor?\"\n\n\"At Metro, you practically had to go to the front office if you wanted something as real as having your hair mussed. . . All automobiles were shiny, a picture never hung crooked, a door never squeaked, stocking seams were always straight and no actress ever had a shiny nose.\"\n\n************************\n\nBen Johnson said:\n\n\"Everybody in town's a better actor than I am, but none of them can play Ben Johnson.\"\n\n\"You know, I'd say that aside from Mr. Ford's help in my career, I'd lay any success I've had to not expecting too much. I never expected to become a star and was always content to stay two or three rungs down the ladder and last awhile. When I do get a little ahead, I see what I can do to help others.\"\n\n[On leaving Oklahoma for Hollywood, where he became a horse wrangler for Howard Hawks on \"The Outlaw\" (1943)] \"I'd been making a dollar a day as a cowboy, and my first check in Hollywood was for $300. After that, you couldn't have driven me back to Oklahoma with a club.\"\n\nWallace Berry said:\n\n\"I never let anyone sucker me, not even for a nickel.\"\n\n\"Like my dear old friend Marie Dressler, my ugly mug has been my fortune.\"\n\n************************\n\nGene Kelly said:\n\n\"I wasn't nice to Debbie.

There is a strong Fonda look.\"\n\n************************\n\nJames Steward said:\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'm doing a Jimmy Stewart imitation myself.\n\n\"I'd like people to remember me as someone who was good at his job and seemed to mean what he said.\" (in 1983)\n\n\"There ought to be a law against any man who doesn't want to marry Myrna Loy.\"\n\n************************\n\nShirley Jones said:\n\n\"After I won the Oscar, my salary doubled, my friends tripled, my children became more popular at school, my butcher made a pass at me, and my maid hit me up for a raise.\"\n\n\"Jack had a breakdown. A real mental breakdown. He was manic depressive. But he was the one that wanted the divorce. He thought it was better for me and the kids. I never did. I would have hung in there. I felt in many ways he was acting strangely and doing strange things and he felt perhaps it was better for all of us.\" - on the end of her marriage to Jack Cassidy\n\n\"You don't throw away 27 years. You just don't.\" - on why she withdrew her divorce petition against Marty Ingels.\n\n************************\n\nJoan Crawford said:\n\n\"I need sex for a clear complexion, but I'd rather do it for love.\"\n\n\"If you want to see the girl next door, go next door\"\n\n\"[Of The Women (1939)] Norma Shearer made me change my costume sixteen times because every one was prettier than hers. I love to play bitches and she _helped_ me in this part.\"\n\n\"If you have an ounce of common sense and one good friend you don't need an analyst.\"\n\n\"If you start watching the oldies, you're in trouble. I feel ancient if Grand Hotel (1932) or The Bride Wore Red (1937) comes on. I have a sneaking regard for _Mildred Pierce (1945)_ , but the others do nothing for me.\"\n\n\"They were all terrible, even the few I thought might be good. I made them because I needed the money or because I was bored or both. I hope they have been exhibited and withdrawn and are never heard from again.\" - regarding her films that followed \"Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?\"\n\n************************\n\nJennifer Connelly said:\n\n\"Acting is great. When it works it is so fulfilling. You do the research and work with other talented people who are creative and compassionate and use all your faculties. The ability to express yourself completely is the most wonderful feeling in the world. Each film is a chapter in my life wherein I learn so much more about myself.\"\n\n\"I so much enjoy being able to completely allow myself to be consumed by a role, and really grow in the process, once you've done that, it's hard to go back working on things you don't care about.\n\n************************\n\nJames Cagney said:\n\n\"There's not much to say about acting but this. Never settle back on your heels. Never relax. If you relax, the audience relaxes. And always mean everything you say.\"\n\n\"All I try to do is to realize the man I'm playing fully, then put as much into my acting as I know how. To do it, I draw upon all that I've ever known, heard, seen or remember.\"\n\n\"My biggest concern is that doing a rough-and-tumble scene I might hurt someone accidentally.\"\n\n\"They need you. Without you, they have an empty screen. So, when you get on there, just do what you think is right and stick with it.\"\n\n\"Where I come from, if there's a buck to be made, you don't ask questions, you go ahead and make it.\"\n\n\"With me, a career was the simple matter of putting groceries on the table.\"\n\n\"Once a song and dance man, always a song and dance man. Those few words tell as much about me professionally as there is to tell.\"\n\n\"I hate the word \"superstar\". I have never been able to think in those terms. They are overstatements. You don't hear them speak of Shakespeare as a superpoet. You don't hear them call Michelangelo a superpainter. They only apply the word to this mundane market.\""
