Charlie Goetshius and the culvert plate from O & W, which is now on display in the museum.

The Mamakating Historical Society was formed on June 1st, 2000 by a group of people who are interested in saving the history of our town. You will find many pictures and artifacts of Mamakating from past years. You will also find many histories of all the hamlets in our town. Walk around the museum and enjoy models of the lead mines, Indian villages, and canal that ran through our town. We just added a collection of photos which were enlarged from O&W postcards.

We are always looking for new members, so please join us!
