        "text": "NEVER did I imagine calling myself a canal nut, but that is what I became after researching and retracing the largely forgotten Delaware and Hudson Canal, an astounding feat of engineering performed in the 1820's to ferry coal from northeastern Pennsylvania to the Hudson River. Who knew that an old ditch could be so fascinating, and so beautiful?\n\nIt turns out that thousands of inhabitants along the canal's route (and beyond) are equally enchanted by its story. I met many people who are passionately dedicated to preserving the memory of the canal, which closed in 1898 and now lies in ruins, and restoring the D & H to its place in American economic and social history.\n\nThe 160-mile journey from Carbondale, Pa., where anthracite coal was mined, to Kingston, N.Y., where it was loaded onto boats for New York City and elsewhere, is an odyssey into another America, when time was measured more in months than minutes, and when transportation technology was based largely on mules and gravity.\n\nI traveled on a cold weekend last April with my friend Jay, who lives in High Falls, N.Y., an important canal town about 20 miles northwest of Poughkeepsie. We made the trip in three days, driving about five hours a day on fine roads with endlessly scenic vistas. The journey is not just for history buffs. Many canal towns offer high-end dining, antiquing, shops and galleries with local artists. Between towns are hiking, biking, fishing, swimming, kayaking and birding. But it was the D & H we found the most beguiling.\n\nCarbondale is the site of America's first underground anthracite mine, started not long after the end of the War of 1812 when ''black diamonds'' were mined here by two brothers from Philadelphia, William and Maurice Wurts. The war had ended with heavy restrictions on the export of British coal to America and, in 1824, the enterprising brothers brought anthracite to New York, where they heated a Wall Street coffeehouse with the newfangled fuel. Investors were so impressed, they bought out the million-dollar stock offer that day.\n\nThe company built an ingenious way to convey coal from mine to market. A ''gravity railroad'' was built to carry anthracite over Moosic Mountain and other ridges from Carbondale to Honesdale, Pa., where the canal began. Cars were hauled up a series of inclined planes by stationary steam engines at the head of each plane; they then were lowered down a series of planes on the other side of the mountain with an ingenious system of pulleys that brought the empty cars back up as the full ones glided into Honesdale.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
