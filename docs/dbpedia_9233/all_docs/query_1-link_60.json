        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Sullivan O&W Trail runs for 20.65 miles in Sullivan County in 7 distinct sections along the NY O&W Railroad Main Line and Port Jervis-Kingston Branch rights-of-way.\n\nThe Sullivan O&W Rail Trail should not be confused with the nearby O&W Rail Trail (Ulster County).\n\nParksville Rail Trail (1.33 miles):\n\nThe northernmost section of the Sullivan O&W Rail Trail runs for 1.33 miles between Rte. 17 and the hamlet of Parksville.\n\nThe trail here is entirely unpaved. At the trailhead located in the Parksville business district, there is informational signage.\n\nLiberty Rail Trail (2.4 miles):\n\nThe Liberty Rail Trail section of the Sullivan O&W Rail Trail runs for 2.4 miles through the business district of Liberty, connecting trail users to dining and recreation opportunities and connecting trail users to the nearby Walnut Mountain Park, which offers additional mountain biking and hiking trails.\n\nHurleyville Rail Trail (5.4 miles):\n\nOne of the longest uninterrupted sections of the Sullivan O&W Rail Trail, the Hurleyville Rail Trail runs between a dead end just short of NY 17 north of Hurleyville and connects the villages of Hurleyville and South Fallsburg.\n\nOften called the \"Milk Train Trail\" locally, the northern 2 miles of trail is a paved route, before a short on-road connection through the downtown business district and a 1.9 miles gravel path connecting Hurleyville and South Fallsburg.\n\nWoodridge Rail Trail (1.7 miles):\n\nThe Woodridge Rail Trail section runs between the hamlet of Woodridge and a dead end near River Rd. This section is unpaved.\n\nThe northeastern endpoint offers options for dining and re-supply in Woodridge. The Mountain Dale Rail Trail is a stone's throw away.\n\nMountain Dale Rail Trail (2.6 miles):\n\nThe Mountain Dale Rail Trails runs for a short 2.6 miles between Mountain Dale and Woodridge. At the Mountain Dale trailhead, there are historical photos, a replica depot, a basketball court and restrooms.\n\nThis section of trail is entirely unpaved, but smooth-packed and ada-compliant.\n\nMamakating Rail Trail (3.19 miles):\n\nThe Mamakating section of the Sullivan O&W Rail Trail leaves off from the old O&W Main Line and follows the old Port Jervis O&W branch instead.\n\nHere the old O&W line and the old D&H Canal Path converge and run nearly side by side. The Mamakating Rail Trail runs between Ferguson Rd. and Summitville Rd., with a portion in the middle between Mcdonald Rd. and a dead end near the Wurtsboro Airport that is owned by the NY DEC that is composed of a rougher gravel surface.\n\nBasha Kill Rail Trail (Long Path/Shawangunk Ridge Trail) (5.49 miles):\n\nThe Basha Kill Rail Trail is a short section of both the Long Path and Shawangunk Ridge Trail, both of which are much longer hiking routes.\n\nGiven that the rail trail shares its route with two much longer hiking routes, this rail trail is much more suited to hiking and mountain biking.\n\nThe trail's northern endpoint is located in Wurtsboro, and the trail heads south from there and enters the Basha Kill Wildlife Management Area and follows alongside the Basha Kill Marsh.\n\nConnections\n\nThe D&H Canal Linear Park connects to the Mamakating Rail Trail.\n\nThe D&H Canal Trail (Bashakill Wildlife Management Area) traverses the opposite side of the Bashakill Marsh of the Bashakill Rail Trail.\n\nParking and Trail Access\n\nThe Sullivan O&W Rail Trail runs between Old Rte. 17 (Parksville) and Indian Orchard Rd. (Sullivan/Orange County Line).\n\nParking is available at:\n\n20 Water St. (South Fallsburg)\n\n10 Greenfield Rd. (Fallsburg)\n\n11 Railroad Ave. (Mountain Dale)\n\nThere are numerous parking options along this route, please see TrailLink Map for all parking options and detailed directions."
