All have left their mark. I invite you to learn about some of the amazing history that surrounds us and attend some of the many great events being held by many of our amazing organizations in Ulster County!\n\nCounty Executive Hein invites you to participate in the following events during\n\nUlster County’s 8th Annual Cultural Heritage Week\n\nNina Postupack, Ulster County Clerk Hosts Heritage Week Activities http://ulstercountyny.gov/archives/\n\n(Exhibits Available at Various Locations)\n\n“To Build A Courthouse”: An Exhibit of Ulster County Courthouse History through the Records of the County Clerk’s Archives\n\nThe year 2018 marks the 200th anniversary of the rebuilding of the Ulster County Courthouse. In celebration of this anniversary, this exhibit chronicles the Courthouse from its founding in 1661, to its present-day form. In the exhibit, you will see biographies highlighting prominent local and national figures in law and politics, Dutch Records of the first courthouse, a timeline of Ulster County courts, and the New York State Constitution, which was drafted and read aloud at the Courthouse. On display at the Ulster County Clerk’s Archives Gallery on the 2nd Floor of the County Office Building, 244 Fair Street, Kingston, NY. Weekdays during Cultural Heritage Week and until 12/31 from 9:00am-4:45pm.\n\n“Coming Full Circle: Celebrating the 360th Anniversary of the Dutch Records”\n\nThis year marks the 360th anniversary of the 1658 Order to Build the Stockade, the oldest record on file at the County Clerk’s Office. In commemoration of this important piece of our shared history, the County Clerk’s Office is featuring an exhibit showcasing the records surrounding this momentous event. This exhibit focuses on the origins of the Ulster County Clerk’s oldest record series, The Dutch Records Collection. On May 31, 1658, Director-General Peter Stuyvesant ordered the settlers to abandon their scattered dwellings and move to a central, defensible location surrounded by palisades (also known as a Stockade). This record not only marks the origin of the Dutch Records Collection, but it also marks the origin of the “Stockade District” in uptown Kingston. The records on display will bring you on a journey back through time to an era when Kingston was a quaint farming village bustling with European settlers. Available to view at the Ulster County Records Center, 300 Foxhall Ave., Kingston, NY. Weekdays during Cultural Heritage Week and until 12/31 from 9:00am-4:45pm.\n\n“From the Ashes: Kingston After the Burning”\n\nThe Ulster County Clerk’s Office presents an exhibit at the Matthewis Persen House Museum titled From the Ashes: Kingston After the Burning.

The house sits on Kingston’s historic “four corners” and was originally owned by Gysbert Van Imbroch. An inventory listing Gysbert’s possessions at the time of his death in 1665 is brought to life through illustrations of clothing, kitchen items, and other articles used in 17th century daily life. The inventory also depicts items Gysbert used in his profession as a barber-surgeon as well as his book collection, one of the largest book collections in the New World. Step back in time with Gysbert’s Inventory. This exhibit was made possible through a grant from the New York State Archives Records Management Improvement Fund in the 2015-2016 grant cycle.
