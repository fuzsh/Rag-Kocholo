After 0.9 miles turn left on Tobacco Rd into the park.\n\nTo start from Ellenville for the O&W Rail Trail [Central Section]; From Routes 52 & 209 in Ellenville travel east on Route 52 (Canal St not Center St) across Sandburg Creek and take your first left on Edwards Pl. A sharp right, then left takes you along Sewer Plant Rd, past the Ellenville Little League fields (more parking). Come to the end of the road next to the Ellenville Wastewater Treatment Plant and park here next to the trailhead.\n\nTo start from Phillipsport/Summitville for the O&W Rail Trail-D&H Canal Trail[Southern Section]; From Route 17 take exit 113 to Route 209 north and after 5.8 miles look for Bova Rd on your left and the entrance to D&H Canal Interpretive Center.\n\nTo start from Wurstboro for the O&W Rail Trail-D&H Canal Trail[Southern Section]; From Route 17 take exit 113 to Route 209 north into the village of Wurstboro. Then take a right down Sullivan St (Route 171) and you'll see a small pavilion on your left between Canal St and Burger Lane. This is where the D&H Canal Trail crosses. Continuing along Sullivan St, just as you start to leave town, on your left will be the start of the Mamakating O&W Rail Trail.\n\nFor the Bashakill Wildlife Management Area for the O&W Rail Trail-D&H Canal Trail[Southern End]; From Route 17 take exit 113 to Route 209 south. Travel 1.9 miles, ignoring the first sign you see for Bashakill on your left, until you come to Haven Rd on your left. Your first right on Towpath Rd brings you to the D&H Canal. Continuing on Haven Road across the Bashakill you'll cross the O&W Rail Trail. Take a left along the gravel road to the parking lot.\n\nThe D&H Canal Trail-O&W Rail Trail Corridor follows the Delaware & Hudson Canal [See; D&H Canal Historical MAP] and New York, Ontario & Western Railroad [See; O&W Historical MAP] route from Kingston South to Spring Glen in Ulster County and Phillipsport (Hamlet of Mamakating) South to Wurtsboro in Sullivan County. Another section of the D&H Canal Trail can be found in Port Jervis, near the Pennsylvania border in Orange County. See; D&H Canal; Port Jervis .\n\nThe D&H Canal Trail-O&W Rail Trail Corridor begins in Kingston in Ulster County [See; Kingston Historical RR Map] .\n\nHeading West: From Kingston, along the old Ulster and Delaware RR, will be the planned Catskill Mt Rail Trail , alongside the Catskill Mt RR. This will connect to the Ashokan Rail Trail which continues West alongside Ashokan Reservoir.\n\nHeading South: From Midtown Kingston, the Greenkill Ave Path & Greenville Ave 2-Way SEPARATED BIKE LANE travels Southwest through the city. A future trail will connect South to the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail , all part of the Empire State Trail .\n\nHeading East: From the Northern End of the Hurly Rail Trail, the O&W Connector travels East into Kingston. In Kingston, several different trails are combined into the KINGSTON GREENLINE . The Catskill Mt Rail Trail will travel East, alongside the CATSKILL MOUNTAIN RR , which utilizes part of the rail bed in Kingston, in the future. This will connect to the Kingston Midtown Linear Trail, which continues East and connects to the Kingston Point Rail Trail, which travels North to the Hudson River Brickyard Trail.\n\nHeading South: From the Northern End of the Hurley Rail Trail, this trail connects to the Marbletown O&W Rail Trail to Accord. From Accord South to Spring Glen, the Northern O&W Rail Trail contains numerous gaps in development. South of Spring Glen you enter Sullivan County with a gap to Phillipsport. Here the Central O&W Rail Trail-D&H Canal Trail, locally known as the D&H Canal Liner Park, continues South to Wurstboro. The main trail is along the D&H Canal Trail, with segments currently being developed along the O&W Rail Trail. South of Wurstboro sections of both the D&H Canal Trail and O&W Rail Trail travel through the Bashakill Wildlife Management Area. For more information visit; THE O&W RAIL TRAIL .\n\nAlong the Delaware & Hudson Canal remains of the original Locks, dry-dock & waste weirs are visible from the towpath trail. As a result of the War of 1812 Americans were faced with an energy shortage due to the blockade of shipments of soft (bituminous) coal from England. Designed as a system of transportation between the coal fields of Pennsylvania and the ports of New York along the Hudson River, the Delaware & Hudson Canal was one of many towpathCanals constructed in the early years of the nineteenth century. The coal passed over a gravity railroad to haul coal from the mines to the Canal terminus at Honesdale, PA. From its opening in 1828 to its demise in 1898, the D&H Canal transported millions of tons of anthracite coal. The Canal was 108 miles long (Honesdale, PA to Kingston, NY) and contained 108 Locks, 22 aqueducts, 136 bridges, 22 reservoirs, 16 dams and 14 feeders. See; D&H CANAL LINEAR PARK for more information.\n\nTwo sections of the old O&W RR intersect in Summitville. For more information visit; O&W Rail Trail (Sullivan County).\n\nHeading Northwest the old rail bed is undeveloped until Mountaindale, where the O&W Rail Trail (with gaps) continues to Hurleyville. Another gap exists between the next section in Liberty and the Liberty Rail Trail. Another large gap exists up to Parksville and the Parksville Rail Trail.\n\nHeading Southeast the old rail bed is undeveloped to Middletown, where it connects to the Orange Heritage Trail , which travels Southeast through Goshen, Chester & Monroe to Harriman.\n\nO&W Rail Trail, including the D&H Canal (Regional Trail Plan)\n\nNorthern Section:\n\nHurley Rail Trail-Marbletown O&W Rail Trail:\n\n[Hurley to Town of Rochester/Accord]\n\nStarting from the Route 209 parking lot in Hurley [Northern End]; The paved Hurley Rail Trail follows the old rail bed of the former O&W Railroad South. A Map Board is located here and there are informational signs scattered along the trail. The trail parallels Route 209. However, a nice buffer of plantings helps separate you from the road. Cross over a culvert (tunnel allowed farm animals to pass underneath Route 209) before coming to a Map Board and Spur Trail on your left at 0.3 miles.\n\nNote; This is the Western End of the paved O&W Connector , which travels 1.8 miles Northeast to Washington Ave in Kingston and is part of the KINGSTON GREENLINE .\n\nContinuing South along the trail, you'll travel underneath the Main St bridge at 0.8 miles, and pass by a spur on your left.\n\nNote; This spur leads to Depot St. Left will take you up to Main St. Heading right, Southeast, on-road along Main St, will bring you to Historic Hurley. Main St has the oldest concentration of privately owned Stone Houses in the United States, dating back to 1680.See; HURLEY HERITAGE SOCIETY .\n\nOne mile brings you to a signboard and the Russell Road parking lot. Keep an eye out to your left at 1.4 miles to spot an old RR Mileage Marker that reads E24/K3, meaning 3 miles to Kingston & 24 miles to Ellenville. These RR Mileage Marker were located every mile along the trail. The paved trail then heads into the woods and ends after 2.2 miles at the Marbletown parking lot. This is the start of the stone-dust section of trail along the Marbletown O&W Rail Trail. A Map Board is located here. The trail here is wide as you cross a wooden bridge and head South into the woods. Continuing along the trail youll pass by a ½ Mile Marker on your right. These Mileage Markers start from the parking lot and continue every ½ mile, although they eventually disappear. The trail travels along a ridgeline with a steep drop along your right. You travel alongside a large marsh with several beaver lodges at 4.4 miles. You reach the Marcott Road parking lot after 5.6 miles. Here youll find a Map Board and bench. After crossing the road, the trail gets a bit narrower. Keep an eye to your right at 6.4 miles after crossing a wooden bridge and spot an old cement railroad Whistle Marker. This let the train conductor know a road crossing was approaching so he could blow the trains whistle. The trail soon veers to the left off the old rail bed and brings you around the Cottekill Firehouse parking lot and past the old Cottekill Train Station, now a private residence. You next cross Cottekill Road where you'll find another parking lot and Map Board. You come to an old bridge abutment at 7.1 miles and have to head downhill to a wooden bridge across Cottekill Brook and then head back up the other side. Very scenic area. Must have been a long railroad bridge at one time. You cross another wooden bridge at 8.1 miles and come to the Leggett Road parking lot at 8.6 miles. Here youll find another Map Board and picnic tables. The trail continues across the road and consists of a hard packed gravel & grass surface with some root issues. Mountain bike is recommended. You cross a couple of wooden bridges before the trail turns to single track as it passes by the old High Falls Train Station which is now a residential home. This brings you to Route 213 in High Falls after 9.2 miles.\n\nNote; A quick ½ mile detour from here to visit a section of the D&H Canal is highly recommended. If you head left, on-road, down Route 213, youll first cross Lucas Turnpike (Route 1) and then Rondout Creek. Soon youll come to High Falls. The D&H Canalpassed through here and you can take a short ½ mile trail along the old Locks. You can also visit the D&H CANAL MUSEUM . The trail starts just off of 2nd Street, next to the old Depuy Canal House which was built in 1797. A sign indicates the start of the stone-dust trail that takes you up to a wooden bridge and over one of the Locks. The trail then takes you past 3 more Locks and ends after just a ½ mile. Directly across from the old Canal House is a platform overlooking an 1825 stone aqueduct. If you continue up Route 213 and take a right onto Mohonk Rd, this will bring you to the museum.\n\nThe trail continues across Route 213. No crosswalk. Head left to access a cross-light. Travel up a short berm to rejoin the rail trail where you'll find a Map Board. This section has been partially developed with a narrow, hard packed cinder & grass surface. Travel through a rock cut, along a berm and across a small bridge at 9.8 miles before you follow a ridge line above a stream. You'll cross a bridge over Rest Plaus Road at 10.9 miles where you'll find a Map Board and parking lot below left. Wide, crushed gravel surface. You'll come alongside Kripplebush Creek where you will spot the scenic Rest Plaus Grist Mill with waterwheel across the creek, as well as, a small dam and waterfall. Informational signs. You cross a bridge after 11.5 miles above Kripplebush Creek where the trail crosses into the Town of Rochester/Accord.\n\nNote; As of Aug 2021 they were still upgrading part of this section.\n\nPass by an old RR Mileage Marker E14/K13 (Kingston 13 miles to Ellenville 14 miles) on your left. The trail then bears left, then right past Williams Lumber and out to Kyserike Rd at 12.3 miles.\n\nNote; Plans are to continue the trail another 1.2 miles to Lucas Tnpk. Not started as of 2023.\n\nNote; Another 2 mile gap exists from Lucas Tnpk South to the Town of Rochester Park in Accord. Need to acquire land.\n\nCentral Section:\n\nO&W Rail Trail:\n\n[Town of Rochester/Accord to Napanoch]\n\nNote; A 3.2-mile corridor of Ontario & Western (O&W) Rail Trail connecting the hamlets of Accord in the Town of Rochester and the hamlet of Kerhonkson within the Town of Wawarsing is being upgraded (trailhead parking area improvements, drainage improvements and full trail resurfacing). I believe this section has been completed.\n\nStarting from Town of Rochester Park in Accord [Northern End]; There is a picnic pavilion and playground here. The trail begins next to a Map Board by the Park entrance. The hard packed dirt, gravel & grass O&W Rail Trail travels South into the woods following the rail bed of the former O&W Railroad. You pass through a rock cut. After about 1.5 miles look right to spot a dirt path that leads to a picnic table overlooking Rondout Creek. Continuing along the trail, you'll pass by the Berme Road parking lot at 2.2 miles on your left before crossing a wooden bridge. Cross a small bridge at 3.1 miles. The D&H Canal crossed somewhere along this section, but I couldn't spot where. Come to Main St at 3.3 miles and continue on-road (residential) before coming to the Main Street parking lot across from the Kerhonkson Fire Dept after 3.5 miles in Kerhonkson.\n\nNote; A gap exists South to Foordmore Road in Kerhonkson. Need to acquire land as of 2021.\n\nFrom Foordmore Road in Kerhonkson; I Haven't checked out this section. The trail has been cleared and deemed ridable (don't know the conditions) South to the NYS Dept of Corrections Facility in Napanoch (don't know the mileage). I believe it utilizes Towpath Rd, South, to the old O&W Railroad Station at Port Ben in Wawarsing. Not sure if the trail has been cleared South to the NYS Dept of Corrections Facility in Napanoch.\n\nCentral Section:\n\nO&W Rail Trail:\n\n[Napanoch to Ellenville]\n\nNote; A 2 mile corridor of Ontario & Western (O&W) Rail Trail connecting the hamlet of Napanoch, South to the Village of Ellenville, is being upgraded (drainage improvements and full trail resurfacing). I believe this section has been completed.\n\nStarting from the Sewer Plant Road parking lot in Ellenville [Southern End]; The parking lot is next to the Ellenville Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nNote; The old D&H Canal, which still exists alongside Berme Rd, travels North from Lower Berme Road Park and eventually combines with the O&W Rail Trail, but it has not been developed. See; D&H/O&W Rail Trail on Map Above (light orange route). Plans are to crate a connection from Berme Road Park to Sewer Plant Rd.\n\nHeading North, the O&W Rail Trail passes by the Ellenville Wastewater Treatment Plant before entering the woods. The surface varies and consists of hard packed dirt, gravel and grass. Some sections are easy, while others are a bit bumpy. After 0.7 miles you cross a bridge over Sandburg Creek. Here the trail combines with the old D&H Canal. Notice the old stonework. You then follow a berm before coming alongside Rondout Creek along your left. Scenic section. Smoother except for some occasional tree roots. You then cross a driveway at 1.3 miles. Berme Rd is on your right. Continue straight along a grassy section past a house and pond before entering the woods again. Here you'll find a stone section of the old D&H Canal (old Lock 27?). Travel above the creek and you'll soon come to a split rail fence on your right, across which sits the old 1902 NY, O&W RR Napanoch Station , which now houses a museum. An old caboose resides next to it along with an old Freight House? Come to a gate at 1.8 miles on your right. This will give you access to check out the old Depot. Great views of the stone Eastern Correctional Facility. Impressive structure.\n\nThe prison first opened as the \"Eastern New York Reformatory\". Its imposing main building, with medieval-style turrets and long green copper roof, was designed by architect John Rochester Thomas. The site was chosen partly for its easily available stone, and the transport provided by the adjacent Delaware & Hudson Canal. The state's Ulster Correctional Facility was built on the grounds in 1990.\n\nContinue along the creek via a short cement trail, passing a small gazebo, which brings you to Institution Rd in Napanochat 2 miles. Cross the road where a gravel road continues alongside the creek. You travel past the prison cemetery (notice the inmate numbers on the headstones) and come to a grassy berm. Continue straight along this berm to the wooden Decker's Crossing Bridge which crosses the old D&H Canal out to Berme Rd at 2.6 miles. Informational sign. The next section continues North alongside Rondout Creek, but has not yet been improved. If you look North, you can see where the D&H Canal started off the river. Lock 26 located North somewhere.\n\nCentral Section:\n\nO&W Rail Trail:\n\n[Ellenville to Spring Glen]\n\nA 5 mile section of the old rail bed has been acquired South from Ellenville to Spring Glen with plans to convert it to a rail trail. No known progress as of 2024.\n\nSouthern Section:\n\nD&H Canal Linear Park:\n\n[Phillipsport to Wurstboro]\n\nStarting from Phillipsport [Northern End]; Located here off Bova Rd is the D&H Canal Interpretive Center. Lock 50 of the D&H Canal is located here (there were a total of 108 Locks between Hornsdale, PA and Kingston, NY) as well as informational signs and wooden Mileage posts. This is a grass lined trail that follows alongside the old D&H Canal (called Basher Kill).\n\nNote; Heading North, the D&H Canal Trail ends at Route 209. See the Map Below for directions to visit Locks 42-45 nearby. I have been unable to locate these Locks.\n\nHeading South, the D&H Canal Trail follows the old D&H Canal, along your right and a marsh along your left. After a mile you come to Summitville Rd. Turn right and cross the bridge You'll pick up a gravel trail on your left which takes you up to the old O&W RR bed. Information signs (D&H Canal/O&W RR) and picnic tables here lead to an overlook of Route 209 and the old canal across the road. A trail leads down to the Route 209 parking lot in Summitville at 1.1 miles. Cross over Route 209 where the D&H Canal Trail continues. USE CAUTION AS THIS IS A HIGH SPEED ROAD AND THERE IS NO CROSS-WALK.\n\nNote; To access the Mamakating O&W Rail Trail; Northern Section. Head left, North, from the D&H Canal Trail along Route 209 and take a quick right on Ferguson Rd. A small incline takes you past a yellow gate on your right. Continue around a bend to spot the trailhead and the start of the Mamakating O&W Rail Trail; Northern Section.\n\nContinuing South, the D&H Canal Trail follows the old D&H Canal, along your right The Canal is wider and more open along this section with a marsh along your left side. The trail is double-track grass and gravel, but contains multiple wooden culverts that you must cross over. Can be annoying on a bike. There is also a picnic table and Porto-Potty here. Soon you enter the woods. This was as far as I traveled. Somewhere the Mamakating O&W Rail Trail; Northern Section joins from your left. You come to Leadmine Rd which brings you to McDonald Road after 3.5 miles.\n\nNote; To access the Mamakating O&W Rail Trail; Southern Section, head left along the gravel McDonald Rd. You'll come to a gate & Map Board on your right after 0.1 miles and the trailhead.\n\nHead right along McDonald Rd over the canal where the wide dirt, grass & gravel D&H Canal Trail continues South through the woods. Cross an iron bridge over the canal before traveling past open fields. Re-enter the woods and come to an intersection at 4.2 miles.\n\nNote; Right leads to the Hornbeck's Basin parking lot which has a Porto-Potty.\n\nContinuing along the trail you cross Ferguson Lane after 4.7 miles in Wurstboro. Kiosk here. Cross an iron bridge over Willsey Brook, pass by a Map Board and cross Pine St bearing right. This brings you to a pavilion with benches, a picnic table and an informational sign next to Sullivan St in Wurstboro at 5.1 miles. The D&H Canal Trail crosses over Sullivan St and goes around a sub-station. Here the trail is hard packed dirt and grass. The trail crosses Pennsylvania Ave to a Map Board at 5.3 miles and continues South past the Emma Chase School. Here the grass trail follows a berm along a power line before coming to a gravel road at 5.6 miles. Continue along the gravel road before coming to a stone-dust trail on your right after 6 miles.\n\nNote; Heading right, West, up this wide stone-dust trail brings you to the Mamakating Town Court parking lot after 0.3 miles.\n\nThe D&H Canal Trail continues straight as a hard packed dirt, grass & gravel trail South through the Bashakill Wildlife Management Area. This was as far as I traveled.\n\nSouthern Section:\n\nMamakating O&W Rail Trail:\n\n[Wurstboro]\n\nStarting from the Sullivan Street parking lot in Wurstboro [Southern End]; A Map Board & paper maps are located here.\n\nNote; Across Sullivan St is the old Wurstboro RR Station, but the old station and RR bed is not accessible heading south to S Rd. You can access the old rail bed off S Rd (See Map) but the trail is only partially developed (hard packed dirt, grass and tree roots) as it travels South through the Bashakill Wildlife Management Area.\n\nThe Mamakating O&W Rail Trail; Southern Section heads North into the woods consisting of a hard packed dirt, grass and gravel surface. Cross an old RR bridge over Basher Kill at 0.4 miles where a causeway takes you through a marsh. Pass a gate and come to McDonald Rd after 1.4 miles. Map Board.\n\nNote; From here you may access the D&H Canal Trail by heading left along the gravel McDonald Rd. Come to Leadmine Rd and a bridge over the D&H Canal at 1.5 miles. Here you can continue North along the D&H Canal Trail by heading right, up Leadmine Rd, where you'll pick up the trail or you can cross the bridge and head left, South, along the D&H Canal Trail back to Sullivan St. Then travel left on-road back to the Sullivan Street parking lot creating a nice Loop. See; D&H Canal Linear Park Above.\n\nSouthern Section:\n\nBashakill Wildlife Management Area:\n\n[Wurstboro in Mamakating]\n\nThe Bashakill Wildlife Management Area consists of 2,175 acres and is the largest freshwater wetland in Southeastern NY.
