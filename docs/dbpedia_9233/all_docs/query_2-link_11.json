        "text": "In Sullivan County, as elsewhere, names of places tend to change as the years, decades, and centuries go by. It's a fact of life for local historians and genealogists -- that person so clearly identified as living in \"Sandburgh\" in 1873 is found, a century later, to have lived in \"Mountaindale\", yet the foundation of their dwelling in the Town of Fallsburgh (or Fallsburg) has not moved one inch!\n\nThere are many reasons place names change over time. Economic development (or lack thereof), international relations, a new industry (or industrialist) leaving a permanent mark, ethnic migrations into or out of the area, the desire to be \"modern\", governmental fiat, and just plain whim are some of them. Quite a few road names particularly have changed in recent years to support the 911 emergency system -- if two roads in a general area had the same name, one was changed to something different. Behind every place name change there is a story, and in the stories there are people. To the extent we can capture those changes now, before the backgrounds are lost, we will help those who are puzzling over that question 50 or 100 years from now.\n\nRemember, the fact that a name changed recently does NOT make it ineligible for this page. In fact, because more people know that road by the old name, it makes it especially eligible. Please provide input!\n\nThere have been many name changes in Sullivan County over the years, and this page will try to provide information about all of them we find out about. If we have additional information about any of these name changes, including the year (approximate) in which they happened, we'll be very happy to include that too. If you know about place names in Sullivan County that have changed over the years that don't appear here yet, you can help us make this page better by letting us know about it. We will credit all contributors by name right on this page. (Just go to the \"contacting us\" page, and be sure to say in your message that it's about the name changes page for Sullivan County).\n\nPerhaps the best place to start is with Sullivan County itself. Sullivan was created from Ulster County, one of New York State's original counties, in 1809. Thus, to the extent that they existed at all before 1809, pretty much all the locations listed in the sections below were, at the onset, part of Ulster County.\n\nAs the townships in Sullivan County were created from other, preexisting townships, some of the locations below also changed the township to which they belonged. For each township, we identify the township from which they were separated, as well as any townships that were subsequently taken from them. While there has been some minor adjustment of boundaries between townships within the County, other than those noted below they have not been substantial and we have made no particular effort to address them here.\n\nBetween the Lakes Group has a download available republishing Child's Gazetteer and Business Directory of Sullivan County, NY, for 1872-73.\n\nWe've also republished (and indexed) Quinlan's legendary History of Sullivan County. to read about that project! Finally, as a free download, we offer the Sullivan County chapter of French's Gazetteer of Sullivan County (1860). You can find it via the \"Free research tools\" tab in the left margin (and why not check our catalog while you're at it? We've got a whole lot of Sullivan County material available, with more to come.)"
