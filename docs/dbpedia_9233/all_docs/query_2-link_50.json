General Conditions Extends northerly and westerly from a point 1500'+/- from the intersection of New York State Route 10 approximately 7 miles to the D & O Station in Oneonta.\n\nThe ROW for the most of its length approximates 66' in width.\n\nSince this line has been in the hands of the railroad until approximately three years ago nothing has been done to it with the exception of removing ties and rails for most of its length. We might state, however, that the ties and rails are in place from a point approximately one mile from its end in Oneonta. All bridges and culverts are still in place. The roadbed is in good condition, although in some places it has grown up with small trees and brush.\n\nThis road runs through agricultural country primarily and since it has been in the ownership of the railroad the local farmers have not appropriated any part of it, for their farms. However, it would seem that this would be the best use for the line unless it is going to be used for some special purpose for the State of New York.\n\nThe station at East Meredith is still intact and has been boarded up and remains idle. All other buildings along the ROW have been purchased and being used for commercial purposes with the exception of the station in Oneonta which was in use by the D & O R.R. until recently when it was appropriated by the State of New York for the building of interstate 88. There is reasonable access to this road from adjoining State and County highways.\n\nThis railroad and all its appurtenances were sold by the Ulster and Delaware R. R. Co. to the N.Y. Central R.R. Co. many years ago and the N.Y. Central recently sold this section of the road to two owners: One to Kenneth Kelso, March 31, 1967 from Station 4567 + 20 to Station 5509 + 11, recorded in Delaware County Clerk's Office 4/6/67 at Liber 477, Page 730 and Otsego County Clerk's Office 4/21/67 in Liber 579, Page 495. (2) From Station 5509 + 11 to its end sold March 29, 1966 to the Delaware and Otsego R.R. and recorded in Otsego County Clerk's Office 4/1/66 in Liber 568 at Page 410.\n\nCooperstown-Charlotte Valley\n\nTermini: West Davenport-Cooperstown Junction Location Map Code: 9-2\n\nA. Approximate length 4 miles\n\nB. Approximate width 50 to 60'\n\nC. General Conditions\n\nExtends northerly from West Davenport at its junction with the U & D Railroad at Cooperstown Junction where it connects with the Delaware and Otsego R.R. This is a short spur of approximately 2 miles.\n\nWe were unable to find a valuation map of this railroad so cannot indicate actual ROW widths. But from observation it appears that it would be approximately 50 to SO feet in width throughout.\n\nThis roadbed was abandoned many years ago and much of it has been obliterated by the adjoining owners. What does remain intact is very heavily overgrown. All bridges and appurtenances of the railroad, tracks and ties have been removed. The stone abutments of the bridge across the Susquehanna River, at Cooperstown Junction, are still in place.\n\nThis course runs through agricultural and residential areas with exception of one portion which passes through a gravel pit.\n\nThere is reasonable access to portions of this road with nearby County and Town highways.\n\nListed below are sales of various portions of the ROW and we assume that the balance have gone back to the heirs or assigns of the original owners through reversionary clauses in the deeds.

General Conditions\n\nWhile the roadbed is discernible as it traverses the countryside, it has been so used and obliterated by the adjoining property owners as to render it practically useless for our purposes. This road was abandoned in 1933 and the road has not been maintained since that date. A considerable amount of the railroad is within the area of the Pepacton Reservoir and thus all traces have been removed.\n\nAll appurtenances of the railroad have been removed with the exception of the station at Andes which, while still intact, is being used for storage purposes only and is in a poor state of repair.\n\nThere is reasonable access to this road from nearby county and town roads.\n\nListed below are names and deed references of the sale of this property as recorded in the Delaware County Clerk's Office:\n\nNAME BOOK PAGE Walter Liddle 251 657 J.

The roadbed has not been used in some time and because of this, much of it has grown up to small trees and brush. Tracks have been removed throughout and with the exception of some very small areas, the ties have been removed as well. All other appurtenances of the railroad have been removed with the exception of a bridge across New York State Route 20, all bridges have been removed. There are also several areas where the present owners, being farmers, have plowed over the ROW and completely obliterated it.\n\n4. This road traverses mainly agricultural land but there are areas where its only use could be recreational because of the deep woods through which it travels.\n\n5. All buildings have either been moved or have been converted to private ownership and use, for one reason or another.\n\n6. There is reasonable access to this ROW at several points with local Town and County as well as State highways. 7, The entire ROW was sold to Hudson River Estates, Inc., and the deeds were recorded in Otsego County Clerk's Office in Liber 475 at Page 95 and in Schoharie County Clerk's Office in Liber 278 at Page 192.\n\nDelaware & Hudson\n\nTermini: Schenevus to East Worcester Location Map Code: 9-5\n\nA. Approximate length 12 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies\n\n1. This line runs from a point where County Road 41 crosses the ROW in Schenevus and extends eastward approximately 12 miles to the point where NYS Route 7 crosses the main line.\n\n2. Listed below are the distances and ROW widths:\n\nDistance Width l0,100+' 150' 2,600+ 175'\n\nWorcester Town Line\n\nDistance Width 1,500+ 175' 2,550+ 130' 900+ 100' 550+ 130' 1,075+ l00' 1,800+ 150' 2,025+ Various 1,250+ 130' 800+ 115' 1,600+ 130' 4,000+ 100' 275+ l50' 1,550+ l10' 1,050+ 120' 3,700+ 110' 6,375+ Incl.

The roadbed is in excellent condition, not having been used in some time and the general public kept from its use. All of the ties and rails have been removed as have the other appurtenances of the railroad. However, all bridges and culverts are intact and in such condition as to be usable.\n\n4. The road runs between agricultural and recreational type of terrain with the agricultural on the north and recreational on the south. Also along this ROW is a fairly large pond or lake, known as Hudson Pond, which is within the subject ROW, lying between this line and the main line. Since the road lies against a range of hills on the south side it is our opinion that the best use would be for recreational purposes or possibly a roadway. We might mention that in the area of Hudson's Pond, a portion of this ROW is within the proposed alignment of the new Interstate 88. Also, the section from County Road 38A to its juncture with the main line has a large section which is included in this new Interstate Highway.\n\n5. There are no buildings along this ROW.\n\n6. Access to this portion of the R.R. is limited pretty much to the extreme ends since in order to get on it, private property would have to be crossed.\n\n7. This section of ROW still remains in the ownership of the Delaware St Hudson R.R. Co. and other than adjoining portions, none of it has been sold off, at least none of the track area.\n\nMiddleburg & Schoharie & Schoharie Valley\n\nTermini: Middleburg to Schoharie Junction Location Map Code: 9-6 A Approximate length 12 miles\n\nB. Approximate width 40-50'\n\nC. General Conditions\n\nWe have joined these two railroads together since they form a continuous line from Middleburg to Schoharie Junction although they are two separate railroads.\n\nThis ROW extends northerly from Middleburg through Schoharie to Schoharie Junction where it joins the main line of the Delaware & Hudson Railroad. The total distance is 12 miles.\n\nWe were unable to find valuation maps for these two railroads but have determined the ROW widths range between 40 and 50 feet.\n\nAll evidence of the railroad have been removed from the Village of Middleburg and as it leaves the village it proceeds through farmland that has been plowed over and the only evidence is a power line which traverses the ROW. About 2 or 3 miles outside of Middleburg you can discern the ROW which is completely grown over and appears in spots because farmers have plowed parts of it over. Upon entering the Village of Schoharie it goes through a nursery property and again has been obliterated. A station in Schoharie is now used as a private residence. There are other buildings along the ROW now being used by private parties.\n\nUpon leaving Schoharie a road, although visible, has been either grown over heavily or obliterated by farmers. After crossing N.Y.S. Route 7, the roadbed is somewhat visible but again heavily overgrown and at one place, a mobile home has been placed on the ROW.\n\nAs stated above, the road runs through primarily farmland and has been taken over by the present owners as part of their cropland.\n\nThere is reasonable access at several points to nearby county and State highways.\n\nA Middleburg and Schoharie R.R. was transferred to the ownership of the New York Power and Light Co. (Later Niagara Mohawk) through foreclosure of a mortgage and transfer recorded in Schoharie County Clerk***<'s Office at Book 221, Page 535. Listed below are the names and book and page references of the sales of the Schoharie Valley Railroad.\n\nNAME BOOK PAGE County of Schoharie 233 453 John Fain 233 494 Mary L.

Ontario and Western\n\nTermini: Orange County border at West Brookville to the abandoned Station at Summitville Location Map Code: 9-7\n\nA. Approximate length 9 miles\n\nB. Approximate width 66'\n\nC. General Conditions\n\nExtends north approximately 9-1/2 miles from the Orange County border at West Brookville to the abandoned Station at Summitville.\n\nThe Right of Way is 66 feet wide throughout most of its length with the exception of 2100 feet when it enters the yards at Summitville and meets the main line of the O. & W. Railroad. At this point it becomes 100 feet wide,\n\nThe roadbed is in reasonably good condition throughout its length with all bridges intact. The rails and ties have been removed but the ties still remain within the right of way.\n\nThe road from the Orange County Line to the point where N.Y.S. Route 17 crosses, abuts a large swamp on its western side and in many places the right of way runs through the swamp area. From Route 17 to the Village of Wurtsboro, it traverses mainly scrub land. North of Wurtsboro it traverses an area of second growth timber until it reaches the outskirts of the yards at Summitville where it encounters a large gravel excavation area. With the exception of the Village of Wurtsboro and the above mentioned highway, the area through which this road passes is used primarily as hunting and fishing preserves.\n\nThere are two stations remaining in this section, the one at Wurtsboro which is now being used for storage purposes by the D. B. Adams Lumber & Building Supply Co. which abuts the right of way and the station at Summitville which is abandoned and, although has been boarded up, it has apparently been broken into and doors and windows knocked out.\n\nThere is reasonable access to county highways at several points along this right of way.\n\nThis section of the railroad was deeded to Sidney G. Rose and Phillip L. Moskowitz on November 17, 1958 and recorded in Sullivan County Court House in Liber 576 at Page 444. See deed copy attached.\n\nThere was a permanent easement taken of 430 feet under Map 114 R-1, S.H. 5510, Bloomingburg-Monticello, Part 1, recorded in Sullivan County Clerk's Office on August 7, 1956 of the NYS Route 17.\n\nKingston Branch:\n\nThis section was appropriated by the State of New York in the rebuilding of U.S. Route 109, S.H. 8080 and the maps affecting this appropriation where 82 and 83, There are very small sections still remaining in private ownership but to all intents and purposes it is owned by the State of New York.\n\nNew York - Ontario and Western\n\nTermini: Oakland to Monticello Location Map Code: 9-8\n\nA. Approximate length 9 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies\n\n1. Extends north approximately 9 miles from the Orange County Line near Oakland in the Village of Monticello.\n\n2. Right of Way widths are as follows:\n\nFrom the starting point:\n\n2200+' 70 feet wide 1050+' 150 feet wide 4300+' 100 feet wide 800+' 130 feet wide 2200+' 100 feet wide 364604-' 70 feet wide 2710+' to its end varies because of the yards\n\n3. The roadbed is in good condition throughout its length and the rails and ties have been removed although the ties still may remain within the right of way. All bridges are still intact. The roadbed for the most part had a running surface of approximately 25 feet wide.\n\n4. The road runs through second growth timber for most of its part, however, a short distance traverses a swampy area. Throughout its length the area is used primarily for hunting and fishing preserves.\n\n5. The Station at St. Joseph's Crossing is still intact and being used by the present owner for rental purposes. The stone base of the turntable is still intact, the freight house is now being used as a warehouse by a construction company and the old depot at Monticello is being used by the VanEtten Oil Co. for storage and office space, in fact the whole area from the start of the yards is used pretty much for commercial purposes.\n\n6. There is reasonable access to various parts of the right of way from county highways in the area.\n\n7. Title to the entire line was deeded to Sidney G. Rose and Phillip L. Moskowitz on November 17, 1958 and recorded in Sullivan County Clerk's Office in Liber 576, Page 444.\n\nNew York Ontario & Western\n\nTermini: New Berlin to Edmeston Location Map Code: 9-9\n\nA. Approximate length 5 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies\n\n1. This section extends northeasterly from the center of New Berlin to the Village of Edmeston, a distance of approximately 5 miles.\n\n2. Listed below are the distances and widths of the ROW:\n\n3100+' 66' wide 7000+ 100' 900+ 66' 1000+ Various 300+ 100' 400+ 150' 1000+ 100' 3900+ 66' 550+ 100' 1300+ 66' 1300+ 100' 2100+ 66' 800+ Edmeston Yards Various\n\n3. This roadbed is in reasonably good condition with the rails and ties removed. All bridges have been removed over Warton Creek. Some of the present owners have plowed under the ROW and all traces have been obliterated and are now being used for cropland. Where this is not the case the roadbed is in its original state although some of it has grown up to small trees and brush.\n\n4. All traces of the ROW in the Village of New Berlin have been obliterated and any buildings are now being used for commercial purposes or have been removed. The same applies in the Village of Edmeston. There are no other appurtenances of the railroad between these two points.\n\n5. There is reasonable access to this section from adjoining town roads.\n\n6. Attached is a listing of the sales by the railroad since abandonment.\n\nGRANTEE LIBER PAGE Ray E.

Approximate width varies\n\n1. Extends northerly from the Orange County Line near Winterton and extends north approximately 7 miles to the Station in Summitville.\n\n2. At its beginning point on the Orange County Line the width of the right of way is 230+'. This then runs 875'+ tapering down to 100'. From this point the distances and widths are as follows:\n\nDistance Width 600t' 100' 1050+' 200' 1300t' 130' 450+' 120' 1050+' 110' 550+' 100' 550+' 110' 7950+' 100' l575+' 130' 3600+' 100' 550+' 230' 975+' 100' 450+' 240' 15850+' 100'\n\nThe remainder 4100+' widens out to the yards its farthest point approximately 2900'.\n\n3. The roadbed is in reasonably good condition and the rails have been removed throughout. However, in most cases, at least on one track lane the ties are still in place. Most of the culverts and bridges have been removed.\n\n4. A road runs through a second growth timber area throughout its length and is used, primarily, for hunting and fishing.\n\n5. There are 3 stations in this section of the railroad; one at Bloomingburg Station which appears to have been abandoned and in a somewhat dilapidated condition; a second one the Highview Station has been purchased by a VFW Club and is being used for summer recreation purposes, and of course the one at Summitville which although it was boarded up at one time has been broken into and has been vandalized somewhat but it is vacant. Also within this section of the railroad there is the so-called Bloomingsburg Tunnel which extends some 3800+' through the Shawanga Mountains. Although this investigator did not go through the tunnel, it appears to be open on both ends so we assume that it is clear all the way through.\n\n6. There is reasonable access to nearby county roads along this right of way.\n\n7. This railroad and all its appurtenances are deeded to Herman Caro on November 26, 1957 and recorded in Sullivan County Court House in Book 556 at Page 43. Prior to the above sale, the People of the State of New York took a permanent easement for reconstruction of Route 17 under Map 118 R-1, Parcel 193 and recorded in Sullivan County Clerk's Office on August 8, 1956 in Liber 534, Page 370. This easement appropriates approximately 600' along the center line of the railroad right of way at the northern end of the aforementioned tunnel.\n\nN.Y. Ontario & Western\n\nTermini: Summitville to Mountaindale Location Map Code: 9-11 A Approximate length 8-1/2 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies\n\n1. Extends north and west, approximately 8-1/2 miles from the Mt. Vernon Road to the western limits of Mountaindale.\n\n2. The area between the abandoned station and the Mt. Vernon Road was appropriated for SH 8080, Map 82 and 83.\n\n3. The ROW widths are as follows:\n\nDistance Width Distance Width 9950' 100' 1900' 130' 425' 75' 1450' 100' 775' 100' 725' 150' 1000' 130' 750' 100' 5675' 100' 350' 125' 1100' 130' 125' 100' 125' 100' 400' Former Bridge 250' 575' Tapering up to 160' 1500' 100' 625' Tapering down to 100' 475' 125' 7100' 100' 1175' 100' 350' 130' 275' Tapering up to 150' 650' 100' 1050' 100' 850' 130' 1850' Various 475' 150' 1150' 100' 650' 100' 1150' Mountaindale 160'\n\n4. The roadbed is in good condition throughout its length. This is a two track line and the rails and ties have both been removed from one track and the ties still remain in the other track. The area where the ties are still in place has grown up to small trees and brush.\n\n5. The road runs through a hilly area and in fact a steep hillside, heavily wooded. This of course limits its use to recreational purposes. However, there has been a house built across the tracks at one point and a Post Office built across the track or ROW as it enters the Village of Mountaindale. The remainder of the area through Mountaindale has just been graded and smoothed off and the ties removed. Other than that nothing has been done with it.\n\n6. The long bridge outside Mountaindale has been removed, also the overpass of the main road from Spring Glen to Mountaindale. However, culverts remain intact and the concrete arch bridge over the road at Phillipsport also is still intact.\n\n7. There is access to this ROW at several points, from adjoining town and county roads.\n\n8. This railroad and its appurtenances were deeded to Herman Caro on November 26, 1957 and recorded in Sullivan County Court House in Book 556 at Page 43.\n\nN.Y. Ontario and Western\n\nTermini: Mountaindale-Hurleyville Location Map Code: 9-12\n\nA. Approximate length 8 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies\n\n1. This section extends westerly approximately 8 miles from the westerly line of Mountaindale through Woodridge, South Fallsburg, to the easterly line of Hurleyville.\n\n2. Listed below are the distances and widths of the ROW:\n\nMountaindale\n\n4100+ 100' wide 1725+ Woodridge 100' 8200+ 100' 550+ 150' 600+ Bridge 100' 7225+ Includes 1000 foot long tunnel 100' 2000+ South Fallsburg Various 9350' 100' 400+ 120' 2450+ 100' 600+ 140' 2875+ 100'\n\n3. The roadbed is in reasonably good condition and the rails have been removed throughout. This is a two track line and the ties have been removed from one track. The area in which the ties are still intact has been grown up to small trees and brush.\n\n4. The road runs through various types of terrain, some wooded areas and some through developed areas. However, the right of way itself still remains in its original state and it can be observed that most of the area through which it passes is used for recreational purposes.\n\n5. The station at Woodridge has been removed and a Police Station has been built on its site. The ROW area through Woodridge has now been paved over and is used as a public street. There was a bridge over the Neversink River which has been removed. The area from this point to the western end of the Fallsburg Tunnel was inaccessible to this investigator so we have no knowledge of the situation on that section of the ROW. The freight house at South Fallsburg is still in use and the railroad station has been converted to a town hall and police station. The ROW through the village has been paved over and is used primarily as a village street.\n\n6. There is a reasonable access at several points along the right of way to county and town roads.\n\n7. This railroad and all its appurtenances were deeded to Herman Caro on November 26, 1957, and recorded in Sullivan County Court House in Book 556 at Page 43.\n\nN.Y. Ontario and Western\n\nTermini: Hurleyville to Liberty Location Map Code: 9-13\n\nA. Approximate length 5 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies\n\n1. Extends westerly approximately 5 miles from the easterly line of Hurleyville to the easterly line of Liberty and extends through Ferndale.\n\n2. Listed below are the distances and ROW widths for this course: Eastern edge of Hurleyville\n\n250+ 150' wide 775+ 125' 9700+ 100' 200+ 83' 9150+ 100' 875+ 150' 1475+ 100' 1400+ 66' 1050+ 110' 1350+ 100' 1725+ Ferndale Various 675+ Bridge (removed) 75' 150+ 200' 1075+ 100' 1600+ 80' 3950+ 100' 500+ Liberty 150'\n\nLiberty Village Line\n\n3. The roadbed is in reasonably good condition throughout the route and the rails and ties have been removed over most of the area. Some ties are still intact. All bridges have been removed.\n\n4. The road runs through an area of brush and small trees for the most part, the surrounding area being used for resort and recreational purposes.\n\n5. There are two stations within this route, the first at Hurleyville, has apparently been abandoned, or at least vacated, but is in good condition. The one at Ferndale has been taken over and is being used by the Esso Oil Co. The present owner of the property at Hurleyville has constructed a gas station and Post Office across the right of way.\n\nWe might state that, from the point where the ROW is bisected by Route 17 through the westerly end of the bridge the ROW is virtually unusable as it is presently being used by a junk dealer for the storage of wrecked cars and the like. The area west of the bridge to the Liberty County Line is usable but it is of such a short distance that would be valuable to only the adjoining owners.\n\n6. There is reasonable access to nearby County and State highways along the ROW.\n\n7. This railroad and all its appurtenances were deeded to Herman Caro on November 26, 1957 and recorded in Sullivan County Court House in Book 556 at Page 43.\n\nThe People of the State of New York appropriated a portion of this section of the ROW for SH 5322 (Route 17) under Map 212.\n\nN.Y. Ontario and Western\n\nTermini: Liberty-Livingston Manor Location Map Code: 9-14 A Approximate length 10 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies\n\n1. Extends northerly from the east Village line of Liberty to the south village line of Livingston Manor, a distance of approximately 10 miles and passing through Parksville.\n\n2. Listed below are the distances and widths of the ROW:\n\nLiberty-East Line\n\nDistance Width Distance Width 725+' 100' wide 625+ Various 275+ 150' 400+ 120' 1800+ 200' 1300+ 100' 7600+ 100' 500+ 150' 1000+ Bridge (removed) 200' 850+ 120' 8600+ 100' 6600+ 100' 1150' Various 2250+ 80' 7450+ 100' 1225+ Includes four bridges Various 1925+ Parksville Various 525+ 100' 500+ 50' 775+ 80' 975+ 130' 4600+ 100' 2200+ 100'\n\nLivingston Manor South Line\n\n3. The roadbed is in reasonably good condition for most of its length in this section although there are a few places where there has been some washout. The rails have all been removed and for the most part so have the ties. There are a few areas where ties still remain intact. All bridges have been removed with the exception of culverts and highway bridges and one bridge over old Route 17 and a bridge across another small stream.\n\n4. The road runs through second growth brush and trees and resort areas. With the exception of the communities of Liberty and Parksville the ROW is used primarily for recreational purposes.\n\n5. The station at Liberty is now being used as a restaurant, and the other satellite buildings within the yards are still in use for their original function, i.e., warehouse, creamery, mills.\n\nA portion of the ROW north from the station in Liberty is now paved and is used as a public street. There is another section which has been taken over by the School District and all traces of the ROW have been obliterated. This is the area just south of the upper Liberty trestle. The station at Parksville has been removed as has the Ralston-Purina warehouse. At present there are no structures in the ROW at this point.\n\n6. There is fairly reasonable access to this section of the road from adjoining County and State highways.\n\n7. This railroad and all its appurtenances were deeded to Herman Caro on November 26, 1957 and recorded in Sullivan County Court House in Book 556 at Page 43.\n\nN.Y.

Extends northerly from the south line of Livingston Manor to the station at Cadosia. The distance is approximately 30 miles and extends through Cooks Falls, Trout Brook, East Branch and Fishes Eddy.\n\n2. Listed below are the distances and ROW widths for this section: Livingston Manor South Line\n\n1575+' Livingston Manor Yards 220' wide 850+ Livingston Manor Yards 150' 3100+ 100' 1425+ 105' 2000+ Various 650+ 100' 700+ 125' 475+ 150' 13850+ 100' 550+ 130' 625+ 50' 2500+ 100' 200+ 150' 3550+ 100' 1500+ 80' 950+ Roscoe 125' 8125+ 100'\n\nDelaware County Line\n\n4550+ 100' 3875+ 150' 1275+ 100' 1750+ 150' 675+ 200' 3150+ 150' 2075+ 100' 6375+ Cooks Falls 150' 3200+ 100' 4300+ 125' 1400+ 100' 2275+ 100' 22325+ 125' 6050+ 150' 1150+ 100' 750+ 66' 1950+ East Branch Various 5275+ 66' 6575+ 100' 9875+ 150' 7525+ 100' 1626+ 133' 1550+ 80' 5350+ 100' 2000+ 125' 4200+ Incl.

All bridges except one, which is outside Cooks Falls, have been removed. However, culverts still remain intact. The roadbed from Trout Brook through East Branch to Fishes Eddy has been converted to a town road having been cleared and graded. There are other small segments of the ROW which have also been graded and are being used for public roads. Within the village of Livingston Manor the roadbed is covered by a Post Office and a large lumber mill and building supply company. The State of New York has appropriated several sections of this portion of the ROW and we are listing below the SH number and maps with the starting and ending points:\n\nSH 5234 Map 230 OS 2017 + 43-OS 2169 + 96 Map 231 OS 2169 + 96-OS 2353 + 44 SH 5340 Map 75 OS 1900 + 22-OS 1914 + 25 SH 5383 Map 63 OS 1871 + 25-OS 1900 + 22 SH 5456 Map 36 OS 1065 + 50-OS 1125 + 75\n\nAll traces of the railroad and its appurtenances through Roscoe have been removed under Maps 230 & 231, SH 5234.\n\n4. The remaining road runs through second and third growth timber area and summer resorts and is used primarily for recreational purposes.\n\n5. The station at Livingston Manor seems to have been abandoned and is falling apart due to lack of maintenance. The station at Cooks Falls has been converted to a private residence and the station at East Branch also appears to be abandoned and allowed to disintegrate. All other appurtenances of the railroad seem to have been removed.\n\n6. There are reasonable means of access to this area from local roads with the exception of one short course which lies between the river and Route 17.\n\n7. This railroad and all its appurtenances were deeded to Herman Caro on November 26, 1957 and recorded in Sullivan County Court House in Book 556 at Page 43.\n\nN.Y.

However, much of it, because of lack of use, has grown up to small trees and brush. Also there is a section approximately 1 to 2 miles south of Rockrift which has several large washout areas. The roadbed, for the most part, has been cleared with both ties and rails removed from place. Most of the culverts are still in place.\n\nFrom an area near Rockrift through Beerston the ROW has been appropriated by the City of New York for the Cannonsville Reservoir. All bridges have been removed.\n\n4. The road runs through second growth timber area through most of its length with the exception of the above mentioned Cannonsville Reservoir area and from Apex to Rockrift it runs through a mountainous region characterized by steep slopes and it is our opinion, that its present use, recreation, is its best use. 5 Other than the station at Cadosia, we could find no appurtenances of the railroad remaining. We might state that the Cadosia Station is being used by the State of New York for storage purposes. 6 There is reasonable access to nearby county and towns road along this ROW. 7 This portion of the railroad and all its appurtenances were deeded to Sidney G. Rose and Phillip Moskowitz on 17 November 1958 and recorded in the Delaware County Court House in Book 389 at Page 285.\n\nN.Y. Ontario and Western\n\nTermini: Walton to Sidney Location Map Code: 9-17 A Approximate length 20 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies We have not included the ROW areas within the villages of either Walton or Sidney. Both have been converted, mainly, to commercial and industrial areas and all evidence of the original ROW has been lost. We therefore are starting on the north edge of Walton and finishing on the south edge of Sidney. l. Extends north from the north line of the Village of Walton, approximately 20 miles to the south line of the Village of Sidney. It extends through Westbrook, Northfield, Merrickville, Franklin Station, Sidney Center and South Unadilla.\n\n2. Listed below are the distances and ROW widths for the section:\n\nDistance Width Burton Street 100' wide 22,150+ 100' 350+ Westbrook 190' 600+ 100' 1,525+ 150' 5,275+ 100' 2,075+ 150' 5,575+ 100' 700+ 200' 1,625+ Northfield Tunnel 100' 3,200+ Merrickville 165' 2,125+ 100' 800+ 150' 850+ 100' 3,400+ 150' 2,650+ 100' 2,975+ 150' 1,400+ 100' 5,050+ 150' 1,450+ 100' 5,850+ 150' 700+ Sidney Center Various 1,300+ 150' 2,500+ 100' 3,325+ 150' 2,675+ 100' 2,050+ 150' 3,800+ 100' 875+ 150' 2,000+ 100' 350' 120' 900+ 150' 13,925+ 100'\n\nVillage of Sidney\n\n3. The roadbed is in reasonably good condition for most of its length. The rails have been removed and most of the ties are also removed. All bridges and trestles have been removed but most culverts and cattle passes are still intact. Just north of Walton there are two sections which have apparently been used for borrow pits because large chunks of the ROW have been dug out. Although this investigator did not traverse the distance of the Northfield Tunnel, he was able to see from one end to the other and it appears to be in a reasonably good condition. Since it goes through a cut and is in a low spot, the ROW has now been taken over by surface water and used as a drainage channel.\n\nIn the section between Sidney Center and South Unadilla there has been a great deal of scraping of the cinders into large piles, presumably by some Government Agency for highway purposes. This area seems to be a storage place for these cinders. Overall, however, the roadbed appears to be in very good condition.\n\n4. This road runs through areas of farming and much of it is being used by adjoining property owners as part of their acreage (pasture and etc.), Also, much of it runs through steep hillside areas of heavy second and third growth timber and is grown up to small brush and trees which would create no problem in clearance. With the exception of those areas being used by local farmers, most of it appears to be usable only for recreational purposes.\n\n5. The only station still remaining intact in this portion is the one at Sidney Center which apparently is being used by either the town or the State for storage purposes. All other appurtenances of the railroad have been removed.\n\n6. There are reasonable means of access to this segment from local roads in the adjoining area.\n\n7. This railroad and all its appurtenances were deeded to Sidney G. Rose and Philip Moskowitz and recorded in Delaware County Court House in Book 389 at Page 285.\n\nROW SALES OF UNADILLA VALLEY RAILROAD\n\nLIBER PAGE GRANTEE VILLAGE TOWN 381 40 New York State Columbus 432 532 Harry B.

The rest of the roadbed remains in good condition. All rails and ties have been removed and all bridges have been removed. However, culverts remain intact. There are some places where the present owners, farmers, have plowed right over the right of way area and are using this as part of their acreage for crops or grazing.\n\nThere is a section from just northeast of Frazier into the outskirts of Delhi which has been cleared and portions of the road graded, apparently to be used for some road purposes. The yards in the village of Delhi are completely obliterated and there is no evidence of them.\n\n4. This road runs through farmland basically, although there are some areas of brush and trees. Suffice to say that its best use, at present time, is for farm purposes.\n\n5. There are no buildings nor appurtenances remaining in this section.\n\n6. There is reasonable access to all sections of this strip of ROW.\n\n7. This road and all its appurtenances were deeded to Sidney Rose and Phillip Moskowitz on November 25, 1957 and recorded in the Delaware County Clerk's Office at Liber 396 at Page 191.\n\nN.Y. Ontario and Western\n\nTermini: New York State Route 7 to Oxford Station Location Map Code: 9-19\n\nA. Approximate length 17 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies We have started this course on the north side of the existing Route 7 since all the land between Route 7 and the Village of Sidney is bounded by the river and inaccessible land.\n\n1. This section extends north and west from NYS Route 7 to Oxford Station which is on the outskirts of the Village of Oxford. The distance is approximately 17 miles and extends through East Guilford, Guilford Center and Guilford.\n\n2.

This roadbed is in reasonably good condition throughout, the rails have been removed and also most of the ties. All bridges have been removed. However, culverts and cattle passes still remain intact. While the roadbed itself is in good condition, it has grown up through lack of use, with brush and small trees pretty much throughout its length. However, we do not feel this would be any impediment to clearing for any use. There is a stretch approximately 2500' in length, running from the western edge of Guilford out past Guilford Lake which has been appropriated by Chenango County for the rebuilding of County Road 35. Other than this there has been no other appropriation within this area.\n\n4. This section runs through an area of second and third growth timber and for the most part runs along the side of a hill through wooded area. There are some places, however, which had been utilized by local farmers as part of their pasture area. Mainly, however, because of the nature of the terrain and the area through which it passes this section is being used for recreational purposes.\n\n5. There is only one station still remaining in this section and that is the station at East Guilford although it is boarded up and apparently not being used for any useful purpose.\n\n6. Although there are long stretches with no access to this section, there is reasonable access within 3 and 4 mile spaces. This access is, of course, to town and county highways in the area.\n\n7. This section of the railroad and all its appurtenances were deeded to Sidney G. Rose and Phillip L. Moskowitz on the 25th of November 1957 and recorded in Chenango County Clerk's Office at Liber 415 of deeds at Page 72.\n\nN.Y. Ontario and Western\n\nTermini: Oxford Station to City of Norwich Location Map Code: 9-20\n\nA. Approximate length 13 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies\n\n1. This section extends northerly from Oxford Station to a point where it crosses the road from Norwich to Polkville on the outskirts of the City of Norwich. This distance is approximately 13 miles. We did not go beyond Polkville Road because from there to the City of Norwich most of the ROW has been appropriated for other purposes and is completely obliterated.\n\n2. Listed below are the distances and ROW widths for this section:\n\nOxford Station - City of Norwich\n\n15,000+' 100' 1,650+ Trestle Various 1,800+ Various 34,400+ 100'\n\nPolkville Road\n\n3. This roadbed is in reasonably good condition, the rails and most of the ties have been removed. All bridges also have been removed but culverts and cattle passes are still intact, also several small bridges. While the roadbed itself, for the most part is in good condition, because of lack of use due to lack of access, it has grown up pretty heavily with small trees and brush.\n\n4. This road runs along the side of rather steep hill and is through a rather heavily wooded area of second and third growth timber. Its only use at present is for recreational purposes.\n\n5. There were no appurtenances of the railroad left in this ROW.\n\n6. Because of the type of terrain through which this section passes there would only be access at each end of the course. This access would be with county and town roads. There was a very high trestle in the middle of this course also which eliminates its use for a through road or trail without the rebuilding of some kind of bridge.\n\n7. This section of the railroad was deeded to Sidney G. Rose and Phillip L. Moskowitz on the 25th day of November 1957 and recorded in the Chenango County Clerk's Office in Liber 415 of deeds at Page 72.\n\nN.Y. Ontario and Western\n\nTermini: Norwich-Madison County Line Location Map Code: 9-21\n\nA. Approximate length 15 miles\n\nB. Approximate width varies As in the previous report of the course, we did not include the City of Norwich in this report which, to all intents and purposes, is unavailable for any use by the State.\n\n1. This section runs north from Norwich approximately 15 miles to the Main St. of Earlville which is also the line between Chenango County and Madison County. This course runs through North Norwich, Sherburne Four Corners, Smyrna and Earlville.\n\n2. Listed below are the distances and ROW widths for this section:\n\nDistance Width Distance Width 500+ 80' wide 950+ ll0' 800+ 100' 350+ ll0' 750+ 100' 12,050+ 80' 15,000' 80' 1,250+ 100' 950+ l30' 22,150+ 80' 500+ 80' 2,250+ 100' 200+ Bridge removed 100' 5,700+ 80' 1,450+ l00' 1,700+ 100' 12,300+ 80' l,500+ 90'\n\nMain St., Earlville\n\n3. From Norwich to North Norwich and perhaps a mile or two beyond, this section is pretty heavily overgrown with brush and small trees and we might note that it parallels a few feet east of the present active Erie Lackawanna Line. From Sherburne Four Corners North to Earlville most of the roadbed has been graded over and incorporated into the fields and pastures of the farmers who presently own it and in many, many cases is completely obliterated, and no evidence remains. However, what roadbed is in existence, in this section, is in reasonably good condition.\n\n4. As stated above, there are no appurtenances of the railroad remaining. All bridges have been removed, however, where a road does exist culverts and cattle passes are still in place.\n\n5. There is reasonable access to this section in several places with local roads.\n\n6. This section of the railroad and all its appurtenances were deeded to Sidney G. Rose and Phillip L. Moskowitz on November 25, 1957 and recorded in the Chenango County Clerk's Office Liber 415 of deeds at Page 72.\n\nAfter traversing the length of this, the main line of the New York-Ontario and Western Railroad from the Orange County Line to the Madison County Line, this inspector feels it incumbent to make some comment about the overall route and its possible utilization.\n\nFirst of all it should be noted that this railroad stopped operating in the year of 1955 which is fairly recent considering most abandoned railroads and because of this the roadbed and ROW has not had as much chance to deteriorate as it might if it had been abandoned at an earlier date. Also because of the very nature of the terrain through which this railroad passed, much of it is not easily accessible, not easily usable, and, therefore, still remains in good condition.\n\nIt is, therefore, our recommendation that those areas which can be utilized for recreation purposes (motorcycle trails, snowmobile trails, bridle paths, hiking trails and nature routes) should be used if at all possible. It would be unfortunate to let this beautiful route become completely lost through neglect.\n\nN.Y. Ontario and Western\n\nTermini: Oneonta to Richfield Springs Location Map Code: 9-22 A Approximate length 27.50 miles\n\nB. Approximate width 50 feet\n\n1. This railroad runs approximately 27 1/2 miles northerly from the Oneonta yards through West Oneonta, Laurens, Hartwick, Index and ends at a point near Flichfield Springs.\n\n2. We were unable to obtain a valuation map of this road, so cannot indicate the ROW widths accurately but, observation indicates that the ROW is approximately 50 feet in width.\n\n3. This road has been, until recently, active from the yards to Oneonta West Side, serving the local industries as a transfer carrier and the rails and ties were intact as far as West Oneonta. From that point northerly to its terminus, all appurtenances of the line have been removed and much of the roadbed has been obliterated by present owners, incorporating the land into farms, residences, etc. The remaining roadway is in poor condition and is inaccessible without going across private property and it has grown quite heavily with brush and small trees. There also is quite a bit of erosion. Appurtenances in the active area of the railroad were a store, Engine House, and shed as well as rails and ties. The station at West Oneonta is vacant and abandoned. All other buildings are either in the hands of private owners or are torn down.\n\n4. The road runs through agricultural and residential land from Oneonta West side to its end and it is our opinion that its only value is to adjoining property owners as part of their properties.\n\n5. We have been advised by an officer of the company that a contract of sale has been completed for all the area between the yards and West Oneonta except that being appropriated by the State of New York under Map 34, Parcel 207, SH 1302, Morris-Oneonta. Listed below are sales to private parties along the ROW. Since this does not cover the full course of the ROW, we assume that the balance has been returned to the heirs and assigns of the original grantors through deed reversionary clauses.\n\nSales of Southern New York Railroad ROW\n\nGrantee Book Page Otsego County 358 265 West-Nesbitt 365 124 S.

The roadbed is in reasonably good condition, rails and ties have been removed most of the way, However, the area from South Edmeston to Sweets still has the ties in place and this section has apparently not been used for any purpose since abandonment and, therefore, has grown up quite heavily with brush and small trees. Much of the ROW passes through agricultural land and the present farmer owners have plowed over and obliterated the ROW for either grazing or cropland. All bridges have been removed. However, culverts and cattle passes, for the most part, remain intact. 4 As stated above, the road runs through agricultural land and it would appear that this would be the highest and best use with the exception of small areas which run through second and third growth timber areas, which could be used for recreation purposes.\n\n5. All buildings on this right of way have now been used by private interests either as residence; or as commercial buildings\n\n6. There is reasonable access; at many points to State, County and Town roads.\n\n7. Attached is a listing of sales to private buyers from the railroad.\n\nDelaware and Northern Railway Company\n\nTermini: East Branch to Arkville Location Map Code: 9-24\n\nA. Approximate length 38 miles\n\nB. Approximate width 66 feet\n\nC. General Conditions:\n\nThis roadbed has been abandoned since 1942 and therefore is not in real good condition. From East Branch across the river and for a distance of approximately l/2 mile all evidence of the railroad has been removed with the construction of the interchange at N.Y.S. Route l7. At this point to Downsville, the roadbed is discernible but not in very good condition. Between Harvard and Shinhopple the ROW is being used for part of its distance for a power line ROW, the remainder is intact with the exception of the removal of a bridge. From Shinhopple to Corbett the roadbed is extremely overgrown and in places has been washed out, making it very difficult to traverse. From Corbett to Downsville it runs pretty much through farmlands and brushland. From Downsville to Dunraven the roadbed has been appropriated for a distance of 22 miles by the New York City Board of Water Supply for the Pepaction Reservoir. From Dunraven to Margaretville the roadbed has been obliterated by the construction of Route 28. (Andes, Margaretville SH 8017) There is a short section from Margaretville to Arkville which, although still exists, is completely overrun with trees and brush.\n\nAll the appurtenances of the R.R. have been removed and the only buildings remaining are the station at Harvard, which is now a private club, and the station at Downsville, which appears to be a private residence.\n\nAccess would be very difficult except at Harvard, Shinhopple, Corbett and Downsville.\n\nListed below are names and deed references of sales of this R.R. as recorded in Delaware County Clerk's Office:\n\nName Book Page Walter Liddle 251 657 J.

Approximate length 20 miles\n\nB. Approximate width 75'\n\nC. General Conditions This hue was completed and opened in 1871. It was known as the Auburn Branch. The New York and Oswego Midland Railroad entered receivership in 1873. It was purchased by the New York, Ontario & Western Railroad in 1879. Incorporation followed in 1880. This branch line was subsequently abandoned. Inspection of the former right of way discloses the following.\n\n1. City of Norwich. All ties and rail have been removed. One area has become a street (Midland Drive} while buildings have been constructed on some of the other parcels.\n\n2. Norwich to Plymouth to Otselic to the Madison County Line. All ties, rail, culverts, bridges and highway crossings have been removed. In some areas the roadbed is well defined, while in other areas there is no evidence that a railroad ever existed. The fill has either been leveled to expand farming land or eroded by adjacent streams.\n\nIn conclusion, it was found that all of the right of way of the Auburn branch is now privately owned or owned by Chenango County or possibly the Towns of Norwich, Plymouth, Smyrna and Otselic."
