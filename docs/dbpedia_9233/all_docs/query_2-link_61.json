The story begins with an overview of the development of the anthracite mining industry in Pennsylvania. Increase in the demand for coal led to the development of nine, class one railroads that depended on coal hauling for a significant portion of their revenue. Karig then describes how and why the O&W initially entered the anthracite market and how its business evolved and developed. This background sets the stage for the author's comprehensive discussion of the history of coal cars. The detailed presentation includes not only the history of the cars themselves but also the related technology and appliances. This intensively researched and well-documented book contains a complete illustrated history of O&W coal cars and concludes with a comprehensive coal car identification section. This book is not just for those interested in the New York, Ontario & Western Railway, but for anyone interested in the history of coal cars the important roll the railroads played in the history of Pennsylvania's rich anthracite coal fields.\n\nHard Cover, Color dust jacket, 81/2 X 11 vertical format, 222 pages, over 200 black & white photos on glossy paper stock.
