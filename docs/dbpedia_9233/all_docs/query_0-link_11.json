        "text": "Summitville got its name because it was the summit of the D&H Canal. Additionally, the O&W Rail line had a major junction here, where the main line and the Port Jervis to Kingston line crossed. There are two parking areas to access the D&H Canal Towpath, which connects to the Mamakating O&W section of the Sullivan O&W Rail trail.\n\nMountain Dale’s trailhead is located next to the hamlet’s basketball courts and Train Station-turned-Visitor Center, adjacent to the bicycle shop. The trail leads trail users into the Village of Woodridge next to Krieger Park- passing a small waterfall and large lake on the way. Mountain Dale has recently experienced a well-deserved renaissance and now offers multiple eateries, entertainment, and shops. During the summer season, the opportunity to visit or camp at Mountain Dale Park has been favored since the early 70’s.\n\nThe Village of Woodridge has two trail heads; one in the Village center, another located next to Krieger Park. The Village center trail leads toward South Fallsburg and ends at the Neversink River. The trail next to Krieger Park ends at the Mountain Dale trailhead. Although Woodridge is mainly a residential village, there is natural beauty throughout, eateries open year-round, as well as grocery stores.\n\nhttp://townoffallsburg.com/woodridge/\n\nHurleyville is a thriving hamlet with plenty of shops, eateries, arts, and entertainment to offer. Hurleyville offers two sections of fully paved, handicap accessible trails; one heading toward Liberty and one heading toward South Fallsburg. One trailhead is located next to the Hurleyville Arts Center in town; it leads toward Liberty and brings the trail user over a lake via bridge and through dense woods. The other trailhead is located near the hamlets basketball courts, tennis courts and playgrounds, it heads toward South Fallsburg and brings the trail user along a lake with active wild life.\n\nhttps://visithurleyville.org/\n\nFerndale is a hamlet in the Town of Liberty. The area was originally known as Liberty Falls before its name was changed to Ferndale by the O&W Railway due to the mail getting mixed up. During the Civil War, the area was best known for its thriving tanneries. Along with its surrounding counties, the area produced a significant amount of leather for the United States during the early- to mid-19th century. The area had an abundance of animal hide and hemlocks which were needed for their tanning acid. One of the largest Borscht Belt resorts named the Grossinger’s Hotel was located nearby in Liberty. Grossinger’s thrived during the early 20th century and has been considered an inspiration for the movie “Dirty Dancing.” Ferndale is the current terminus of one end of the Hurleyville section of the Sullivan O&W Rail Trail, also called the Milk Train Trail. Due to the loss of a very large trestle, an on-road section (not yet marked) will connect this end to the Liberty Rail Trail section of the Sullivan O&W Rail Trail.\n\nLocated in the Town of the same name, the Village features a large downtown historic district. Liberty is the most urbanized of all the Villages and hamlets along the Sullivan O&W Rail Trail Main Line. The Village boasts a number of restaurants, stores, art galleries and a museum, all located on Main Street, easily accessible from the O&W Rail Trail. A short walk or ride from the trail, Walnut Mountain Park offers miles of hiking and biking trails that will offer trail users an additional recreation experience.\n\nhttp://www.libertyvillageny.org/\n\nThe hamlet of Parksville is in the town of Liberty, located north of the Village of Liberty off of Route 17. Parksville shares its resort-based background with much of the area. The Little Beaver Kill runs through Parksville, along with the O&W rail bed which comprises the Parksville Rail Trail section of the Sullivan O&W Rail Trail. The trail runs parallel to the hamlet’s main street area and highlights the picturesque surroundings. There are two buildings in Parksville listed on the historic register. The buildings are the Parksville Baptist Church, built in 1898, and the Tefereth Israel Anshei Parksville Synagogue, built in 1907. Local businesses include restaurants and lodging. Other attractions include a maple syrup company and a film studio. Camping is also available at a nearby Hunter Lake Campground."
