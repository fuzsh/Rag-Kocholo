        "text": "Welcome to the Village of Maybrook!\n\nWhether you expect to be here for a short time or for the rest of your life, we hope you find the Village of Maybrook to be a friendly, caring and supportive community where everyone is received warmly. Over the years we have gained an even greater appreciation for our community and its spirit. The community we have does not happen by accident. Positive accomplishments are realized by the constant efforts of your Village Board, community organizations, residents and village employees. Together we will continue to make Maybrook a better place to live, work and play. Our Village of Maybrook Website was created to improve communication and to inform residents of current events. Please visit and “LIKE” our Village of Maybrook Facebook and Instagram pages as well!\n\nSincerely,\n\nMayor Dennis K. Leahy\n\nPlease be advised: Prospect Avenue residents south of Clark Place ONLY.\n\nThe Village of Maybrook has received verbal communication from Pace Laboratories and approval from the Orange County Board of Health that there is NO bacteria present in the samples provided from the water main repair on Thursday. A copy of the test results will be posted on the Village of Maybrook website as soon as received.\n\nContact the Maybrook DPW Superintendent Matt Thorp at 845 656 3122 or the Orange County Department of Health at 291 2331 for questions or concerns.\n\nLoss of pressure in Village of Maybrook.\n\nBOIL YOUR WATER BEFORE USING\n\nBring tap water to a rolling boil, boil for one minute, and cool before using. Or use bottled water certified for sale by the New York State Department of Health. Boiled or bottled water should be used for drinking, making ice, washing dishes, brushing teeth, and preparing food until further notice.\n\nThis Boil Water Notice applies to residents on Prospect Avenue from the water storage tank to the end of Prospect Ave.\n\nWhat Happened ?\n\nAt about 1:40pm on Thursday 4/18/24, the water system lost pressure due to a leak in the watermain that requires a section of the main to be replaced. When water mains lose pressure it increases the chance that untreated water and harmful microbes can enter your water.\n\nHarmful microbes in drinking water can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms and may pose a special health risk for infants, some elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems. But these symptoms are not just caused by microbes in drinking water. If you experience any of these symptoms and they persist, you should seek medical advice.\n\nWhat is being done ?\n\nThe section of the 6” watermain is being replaced.\n\nIt is likely that you will need to boil water for the next several days until the problem is fixed. You will be informed when tests show that you no longer need to boil your water.\n\nFor more information about boil water events and using water for bathing, cooking, cleaning and other uses during these times see: www.health.ny.gov/environmental/water/drinking/boilwater/\n\nIf you have additional questions, please contact:\n\nMatt Thorp, Chief Operator at 845-427-2222.\n\nor the Orange County Department of Health at __845-291-2331_____.\n\nThe Village of Maybrook Department of Public Works will be hand delivering this notice to residents on Prospect Avenue.\n\nMayor Dennis K. Leahy"
