        "text": "On October 6th a Town of Mamakating candidates' forum was once again held at the Phillipsport Community Center.\n\nUnfortunately, this year the dais of candidates was missing the entire Republican slate: John Moul (running for town supervisor), Regina Saunders and Michael Robbins (running for town council), Vince Lamendola (running for highway superintendent), and Marcelle Matthews (who is seeking another term as town justice). This level of absenteeism is unprecedented for this event — a half-century tradition for the nineteenth century former one room schoolhouse and the only opportunity this election year for the voters to seriously engage with the candidates in a formal public venue concerning pressing issues.\n\nHealthy dialogue did take place nonetheless. But, as we voters were not able to question them on that important autumn day, I have a question to pose to the Republican slate of candidates now: If you don't answer to the voters, who do you answer to?\n\nI advise my fellow voters not to be fooled by the glossy literature in your mailboxes. They were probably paid for by the very people the no-show Republican candidates actually do answer to.\n\nAndrew B. Weil\n\nSummitville\n\nNational Friends of Libraries Week!\n\nOctober 20-26, 2013, is the sixth annual celebration of National Friends of Libraries week making it a good time for the Library Trustees to publicly recognize and thank the Friends of the Rosendale Library who contribute so much of their time and expertise to significantly enhance our services. Our Friends group was reactivated in 2006. In the last 13 years our friends group raised money for: a bi-annual newsletter, replacement of our slate roof, adult and children's programming, an annual $750 scholarship for one of Rosendale's graduating high-school seniors, and many other projects that enrich the lives of the people in Rosendale.\n\nI know that the Rosendale Library is a source of pride for our community. Our Friends group is a source of pride as well. I hope this week everyone will call us at 845-658-9013, or visit us in person or online at www.rosendalelibrary.org to find out how they can join and support this outstanding group of volunteers.\n\nMichael Thomas\n\nLibrary Trustee\n\nSupports Scott Carlsen For Supervisor\n\nAs Election Day approaches, I feel it is important to express my feelings relative to the two candidates for Supervisor of the Town of Wawarsing. Leonard Distel has held elected positions on and off for a number of years, and he believes he has done a good job, hence his seeking to become our town supervisor once more. In reality, he has not performed well. In 2010, after being sorely disappointed at his handling of a complaint I had, I told him: \"When you're in politics, not everyone is going to like you, but it is very important that they respect you\". I like and respect Scott Carlsen.\n\nOur township has suffered economically for many years; that is changing. Walmart is here; casino gambling is a real possibility. Much still needs to be done, but we are on our way! With change comes challenges. We need someone with the skills to lead us and resolve issues. We have that in Scott Carlsen; let's not mess that up by voting for someone who is solicitous to the public for their vote.\n\nBase your choice of candidate on his accomplishments, not promises. Simple as that.\n\nLinda Geiselhart\n\nNapanoch\n\nIn Support Of Distel In Wawarsing\n\nI am supporting Lennie Distel for supervisor for many reasons. First, when Distel was supervisor he was always willing to listen to the concerns of his fellow Wawarsingers. And not just listen, but personally make a difference. Second, he was against fracking from the beginning even though I feel it has never been an issue here anyway.\n\nHe is one of us, having graduated from Ellenville High and staying in the neighborhood. He also had a plan to televise our town meetings which would enable more citizens to be involved.\n\nDistel does care about the environment and the huge need for jobs as well. After all, you cannot live on a beautiful vista alone.\n\nWhen there is a debate in Cragsmoor between the candidates, an impartial, outside moderator is the only fair way to go; not someone who supports one candidate over another.\n\nLucy Muller\n\nCragsmoor\n\nIn Support Of Rochester's Tony Spano...\n\nNovember 5th is just around the corner. I'm writing in support of Democratic candidate Tony Spano. Mr. Spano is a deputy police chief, a father, husband, and all-around good guy. He' s lived in the Town of Rochester for most of his life. He graduated from Rondout Valley High School and rather than move out of the area, decided to stay and raise a family.\n\nMr. Spano has served several terms on the town board with praise coming from both sides of the aisle. Tony Spano is very thorough in studying any proposal coming before the town board. He researches each and every proposal introduced to the town board so that his votes will be based upon facts and not guesswork.\n\nMr. Spano is not afraid to tackle tough problems; he seems to thrive on them. He has a knack for figuring out how to make a possible volatile situation move to a win-win compromise for both parties. Maybe this is his police training, but whatever it is, it has proven beneficial in his role as a board member. During his term, he has acted as liaison to the Accord fire commissioners, a responsibility which used to be fraught with difficulties, but which now operates smoothly... in no small part thanks to Tony. As a former firefighter in the Kerhonkson Fire Department, he is able to empathize with those with whom he works. He did deep research into the fracking industry in order to inform himself and his fellow board members of the dangers of fracking.\n\nIn short, Mr. Tony Spano has proved himself a most capable town councilman. On election day, re-elect him. Our town deserves such a distinguished, experienced, service-minded person as their representative.\n\nMargaret Bonner\n\nKerhonkson\n\nMany Deserve Kudos For Wawarsing Progress\n\nAs a resident of Kerhonkson I am happy to see the progress being made. As a retired town employee I know during previous administrations several grants were applied for. After years of paperwork being submitted, studies being done, and meetings with officials, denials were forthcoming in most cases since we didn't meet the criteria even in an emergency situation due to the two devastating floods. Some projects were too big and had to be submitted in phases. Maybe now since the bridge has been replaced we can finally continue the sidewalk project.\n\nWhile we are giving Scott Carlsen credit for his good deeds, we need to also give credit to the previous supervisors who tried to revitalize the hamlet. Without their efforts many of the projects would never have been started. So let's also thank Joe Stoeckeler, Jr, Gerry DePew, Doc Craft, James Dolaway, Ed Jennings and Lenny Distel.\n\nWalmart is no longer Joe Tso's dream. Scott, you have the honor of cutting the ribbon. Several of the former supervisors hoped for that honor.\n\nThe Kerhonkson to Napanoch rail trail is still in design. The hopes of this corridor connection has been in the works since Joe Stoeckler Jr. and work on the trail has been ongoing by the locals for over 20 years. It is not a new or recent concept.\n\nPatti Motzer\n\nKerhonkson\n\nLet The DEC Be Lead Agency On China City!\n\nI'd like to add my voice to the comments of our neighbors regarding the impact of the proposed China City development on the Towns of Thompson and Mamakating. A year-round amusement park, museum, school, warehouse, hotel and 1500 housing units, with no information on sewage disposal, new roads, storm water runoff? All this new construction requires a major infrastructure at great cost to taxpayers with few available jobs for a local workforce. In addition to the consequences of new taxes, it will disrupt the rural lifestyle that our residents currently enjoy.\n\nI join my neighbors in urging that the Town of Thompson recognize the role of the DEC a lead agency for the environmental impact study (SEQRA) for this new development.\n\nJack Weiser\n\nPhillipsport\n\nManna Jo Greene For Ulster County\n\nManna Jo Greene is my pick for Ulster County Legislature. She holds a vision for Ulster County that includes economic growth and sustainability, especially, development of a new economy which focuses on Green technologies. Manna Jo Greene is an experienced leader who has worked hard to make Ulster County a desirable community for people and their families. Already she has done so much for our community. She has served on the Rosendale Town Board for the past 8 years. She was instrumental in the Rosendale Recreation Center's move to acquire sustainable energy with geothermal and solar power. Through her grant writing she helped secure funds that were needed to equip our community center with green energy that continues to save money for the residents of the Town of Rosendale. She also wholeheartedly believes and fights for sustainable economic development. This is evident through her work and advocacy of the Hudson Valley Buy Local movement and her active participation in the Mid-Hudson Regional Sustainability Plan Energy Working Group which is helping Ulster County transition to Green Energy.\n\nDeirdre Ourso\n\nRosendale\n\nTerry Bernardo Went Out Of Her Way...\n\nAt this time last year we contacted Terry Bernardo in an effort to resolve an ongoing problem with a neighborhood sewer. While we had previously reported the sewer to the Department of Health, over a period of years it continued to bubble up through the ground creating an unpleasant and unhealthy situation.\n\nTerry listened carefully and acted quickly. She contacted the correct people at the Department of Health and her office received periodic updates. We appreciated the follow up phone calls we received from her office which kept us informed during the process.\n\nWe can't remember a time when someone in a political office offered this level of continuous support until our problem was resolved.\n\nWe're extending our sincere thanks to Terry and we're looking forward to November when we'll be voting for her re-election.\n\nRickey and Piper Caruso\n\nKerhonkson\n\nIn Support Of Archer For Legislature\n\nI would like to tell Shawangunk Journal readers why, on November 5th, I'm voting for Lynn Archer for Ulster County Legislator (District 21). The quick answer is because she has been an amazing town councilperson for six years.\n\nThe longer answer is because Lynn Archer distinguished herself as a public servant truly concerned with serving the public. She has no agenda other than to seek solutions to the problems faced. She has, over her time in office, been able to bring out the very best in board members with opposing viewpoints. I have witnessed her people skills as time and time again she brought common sense to the table when the board was involved with negotiations over pending legislation.\n\nLynn's background includes a corporate career in human resources which was primarily concerned with conflict resolution between diverse personnel. She is now a successful business owner.\n\nDuring her terms in office, Lynn many times was able to bring reason into discussions about what the town should be doing and about what direction it should be headed. Even those members with Tea Party leanings were impressed with her ability to find common ground in order to leave partisan politics aside and concentrate on doing what's best for the township and its residents.\n\nLynn Archer is fully committed to bringing high-speed internet access to every corner of Ulster County. She is committed to keeping taxes as low as possible while striving to maintain necessary services. She understands that government MUST be about getting the peoples' business done and not about partisan bickering and finger-pointing.\n\nI am absolutely confident that Lynn Archer will bring much needed common sense to the Ulster County legislature. I am likewise confident that Lynn will be able to influence the \"other side\" (be they Republican or Democrat) with her intelligence, work ethic and knowledge so that decisions will be about what's best for Ulster County residents and not what's best for Republicans or Democrats.\n\nOn election day, choose to cast your vote for Lynn Archer so that we will be represented by someone who shuns appealing to fringe elements within her party in order to gain support. Let us choose to send someone to Kingston who has the ability to reach consensus among disparate viewpoints so that the peoples' work actually gets done.\n\nRemember, the 5th of November, Lynn Archer for Ulster County Legislator.\n\nSteven L. Fornal\n\nAccord\n\nWhere Have All the Signs Gone?\n\nAren't politicians required to remove their signs AFTER the election? Most of the signs for Roxanne that were out weeks ago have disappeared. Why would Roxanne Donnery remove them BEFORE the election? Or is someone else taking them?\n\nYou can take away all of her political signs, but you can't take away all that she has done for Orange County in her current position. She has fought hard to save Valley View, the Government Center, and against the KJ Pipeline. She is always thinking of what's best for her constituents. She is a woman of strong conviction for what is right!\n\nLet's put Roxanne in the County Executive seat, and have someone in county government who is on our team.\n\nRoxanne Donnery is anything BUT politics as usual... we've had enough of that.\n\nCarole Ann Curtis\n\nHighland Mills\n\nBlasts Cuomo For His Casino Support Antics\n\nFollow the money and you see why Cuomo is acting as he is. The money trail is finally seeing the light of day, and surprise, surprise ?Gov. Cuomo has been one of the gambling industry's major beneficiaries. According to a NY Times article by Thomas Kaplan, since 2005 Cuomo has collected more campaign donations from gambling and horse racing interests — over $1 million — than any other elected official or candidate in the state.\n\nAnd apparently Cuomo is following the gaming industries operational model of the \"house always wins\" by the legal criminality route that he has taken in getting this legislation to the ballot box. His most recent egregious act is to have the Board of Elections frame the wording as an advertisement for the glorious benefits of gambling money. By this rosy language he has stacked the deck and violated the sanctity of the ballot.\n\nThey say prostitution is the oldest profession and gambling the second — surely Cuomo's action indicates he has learnt from both \"professions.\" Fellow voters: Are we going to let him get away with that? Vote NO to proposition ONE.\n\nSusan Puretz\n\nSaugerties\n\nBelieves That Rosendale Needs Jen Metzger!\n\nI serve on the Rosendale Environmental Commission under the chairmanship of Jen Metzger and can truly say she is one of the most intelligent, kind, honest and hard-working people I know. Through my experience working with her, I can vouch for her ability to patiently listen to all sides of an issue, find consensus and use that balance to come up with unbiased solutions to issues confronting our town. Although I would be sad to see her leave the environmental commission, I would love to see how our town could benefit from her positive vision, tireless energy and commitment to Rosendale. In the interest of fair, democratic government please come out and vote for Jen Metzger for town board.\n\nNaja Kraus\n\nRosendale\n\nWants Roxanne Donnery For County Executive\n\nAfter attending the two debates for county executive it is clear Steve Neuhaus refuses to accept the proven facts regarding the Orange County government center. The Republican candidate has rejected the virtues of this iconic Mid-20th. century building's structural soundness, solid foundation and superior construction that is built to the highest building code classification. All the arguments making a case for demolition are false and have been proven by the Physical Condition Assessment Report submitted to the Department of Public Works in May, 2013. Mr. Neuhaus has assumed the same position as the current county executive that will create an additional $20 plus million of unneeded & unnecessary construction as payback for partisan political support costing you the taxpayer more money. All because of a lack of maintenance in order to achieve a preconceived notion that it should be torn down and replaced.\n\nIt is obvious Orange County is better than this. We need to restore integrity, ethics, transparency, fiscal responsibility and good old common sense to the office of county executive. Roxanne Donnery's untiring determination has allowed her to never waiver from her positions on the O.C.G.C., Valley View, the K.J. Pipeline just to name a few issues. She is unbought and unbossed and will be there to protect your hard earned tax dollars from being squandered by careless, uncaring politicians. I urge you to support and vote for the more experienced candidate. On November 5th. please vote for Roxanne Donnery as our next Orange County Executive.\n\nSteve Brander\n\nCentral Valley\n\nSuggests Voting For Lynn Archer For Legislature\n\nI'm writing to support Lynn Archer's candidacy for county legislator. Lynn has served on Rochester's town board for five years. During that time, there has been a huge improvement in our town government's ability to work together to find solutions to the challenges that our town faces. Tax increases have been kept at a minimum, while other municipalities are suffering. Lynn and the town board have worked together to adopt sensible zoning laws that provide a balance between important quality of life issues and promoting economic growth. Most importantly, the level of animosity in town has fallen significantly so that everyone in our community can talk about issues without being shouted down. I think that this is one positive attribute that Rochester can export to the county legislature.\n\nI hope that our town government continues to work towards consensus driven decisions that respect the varying viewpoints of our residents. The challenges that we continue to face require our elected officials to devote their fullest energies to finding sensible solutions and I know that as Lynn leaves the town board, Tony Spano and Sherry Chachkin will work hard to continue these efforts.\n\nPat Rosenberg\n\nAccord\n\nUrges A NO Vote On Casino Gambling...\n\nThis November 5th there is a referendum to vote for or against more gambling casinos from coming to NY State. I urge everyone to come out and vote NO, against gambling that day. Here's why: although gambling casinos tout themselves as \"engines of economic development\" they are exactly the opposite. Oh yes, some tax money will flow into Albany, but billions will flow out of our state and into the pockets of international gambling interests, in Hong Kong, S. Korea, South Africa, The Arab Emirates, Russia and Japan. Locally, buses filled with senior citizens will clog Rte 17 and Rte 209, taking their small savings and spending it on gambling slots, black jack tables and racino, only to lose 95% of their money. Once inside, the money never gets out to the local businesses. Casinos typically have gas stations on their property, offer free meals in multiple restaurants and have mall-type retail stores to shop in. Casinos are a money pit and are not good neighbors, bringing property values down, bringing in immigrant labor for construction and daily operations, and stressing out local schools and public services such as the police, hospitals and mental health services. Gambling is not economic development. It's the quickest way to win the race to the bottom. Vote NO to Proposition One on Nov. 5th.\n\nSteven London\n\nDix Hills\n\nAn Open Letter To Congressman Gibson...\n\nYou must know that much in your newsletter, to put it generously, twists the truth. Republicans brag that they got subsidy verifications written into the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Of course, verification requirements for subsidies were written into the ACA from the start; it is so obvious as to be laughable. Clearly Republicans \"agreed\" to this provision in order to save face for holding hostage the US government — costing taxpayers $24 billion — and the world economy. Turns out that Americans like their government to function, after all.\n\nYou can repeat Republican talking points in lockstep with your colleagues but you know that Democrats \"unwillingness to negotiate\" was not what shut down the government. Americans know that, in fact the entire world knows that. What you fail to mention in your newsletter is that Republicans, having voted 42 times to repeal \"Obamacare\" and failed, insisted on negotiating it with the President and the Senate and both fortunately stood their ground. The ACA is the law; it is here to stay and it will benefit millions of Americans, which is clearly what Republicans are afraid of. Your party practiced blackmail diplomacy and lost. Admit it, take responsibility like grown-ups and promise the American people that you will never to do it again.\n\nClearly, Mr. Gibson, you are not a bad guy, but you are a member of a party that is willing to put people's lives at risk for its radical ideology. It has voted 42 times to dismantle \"Obamacare\" but passed no legislation that would benefit the vast majority of US citizens. Indeed, as you wrote in your newsletter \"finding an agreement is not that difficult when we come to the table.\" It's time we saw more of that from Republicans. For the next debt ceiling (i.e. debt payment) vote we urge you to be on the side of sanity which will probably mean not voting with your party.\n\nJudith Simon\n\nSaugerties\n\nAn Unexpected Benefit To The New Walmart...\n\nI for one have found some great advantages in having the new Walmart on Route 209. When their new traffic light turns red, I can now gaze across the fields to the beautiful Shawangunk range in relaxation, knowing I won't crash into another car.\n\nAnonymous"
