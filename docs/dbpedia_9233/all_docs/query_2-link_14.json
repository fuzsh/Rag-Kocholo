        "text": "Not to be confused with Sullivan, New York.\n\nSullivan County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 78,624. The county seat is Monticello. The county's name honors Major General John Sullivan, who was labeled at the time as a hero in the American Revolutionary War in part due to his successful campaign of genocide against the Iroquois (see Sullivan Expedition).\n\nThe county was the site of hundreds of Borscht Belt hotels and resorts, which had their heyday from the 1920s through the 1970s.\n\nIn 2010, the state's center of population was at the southern edge of Sullivan County.\n\nHistory\n\nWhen the colony that is now New York State established its first twelve counties in 1683, the present Sullivan County was part of Ulster County. In 1809, Sullivan County was split from Ulster County.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the advent of factories driven by water power along the streams and rivers led to an increase in population attracted to the jobs. Hamlets enlarged into towns. As industry restructured, many of those jobs left before the middle of the twentieth century. The economy changed again after that, shifting to a more tourist-based variety and benefiting from resorts established by European Jewish immigrants and their descendants in what became called the Borscht Belt of the 20th century. Resort hotels featured a wide variety of entertainers, some nationally known. At the beginning of this period, visitors traveled to the area by train, and later by automobile. The area's natural resources also provided a setting for numerous summer camps frequented by the children of immigrants and their descendants.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 997 square miles (2,580 km2), of which 968 square miles (2,510 km2) is land and 29 square miles (75 km2) (2.9%) is water.\n\nSullivan County is in the southern part of New York State, southeast of Binghamton and southwest of Albany. It is separated from Pennsylvania along its southwest boundary by the Delaware River.\n\nThe county, which starts about 70 miles northwest of New York City, is in the Catskill Mountains. Its northeastern corner is within the Catskill Park.\n\nThe highest point in the county is a 3,118-foot (950 m) peak unofficially known as Beech Mountain, near Hodge Pond, a subsidiary summit to Mongaup Mountain across the Ulster County line. The lowest point is along the Delaware River.\n\nAdjacent counties\n\nDelaware County - north\n\nUlster County - northeast\n\nOrange County - southeast\n\nPike County, Pennsylvania - southwest\n\nWayne County, Pennsylvania - west\n\nNational protected area\n\nUpper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River (part)\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1810 6,108 — 1820 8,900 45.7% 1830 12,364 38.9% 1840 15,629 26.4% 1850 25,088 60.5% 1860 32,385 29.1% 1870 34,550 6.7% 1880 32,491 −6.0% 1890 31,031 −4.5% 1900 32,306 4.1% 1910 33,808 4.6% 1920 33,163 −1.9% 1930 35,272 6.4% 1940 37,901 7.5% 1950 40,731 7.5% 1960 45,272 11.1% 1970 52,580 16.1% 1980 65,155 23.9% 1990 69,277 6.3% 2000 73,966 6.8% 2010 77,547 4.8% 2020 78,624 1.4% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n1790-1960 1900-1990\n\n1990-2000 2010-2020\n\nAs of the 2000 Census, there were 73,966 people, 27,661 households, and 18,311 families residing in the county.

It was the site of the hundreds of resort complexes of the Borscht Belt (with their golf courses, social events, and entertainers), between the 1920s and 1970s. It was the site of the 1969 Woodstock Festival.\n\nMany famous comedians tested their material and performed regularly at Borscht Belt hotels, including Milton Berle, Mel Brooks and Henny Youngman. Eddie Fisher performed often at Grossinger's, where in 1955 he married Debbie Reynolds.\n\nDuring the period August 15–18, 1969, some 500,000 people gathered in Sullivan County's Town of Bethel at Max Yasgur's farm to attend the Woodstock Festival.
