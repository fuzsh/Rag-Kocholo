        "text": "Our Journey started as a Father and Son duo since 2000; We provided fun, magical, chic, and stylistic destination and local Wedding Photography for couples that just wanted to enjoy their day. Period. Now in 2024 and beyond, we have expanded our expertise and added A-Team members to bring you the very best Photo and Cinematic Video Wedding creation and documentation in the North East. Together our merry band of crusading wedding creators will do what no one else can. What is that you ask? Simply put. We want to let you be you… and help to bring out the very best of who you are in Camera.\n\nHey, I'm Mary! It's nice to meet you. Summing up who I am in an \"about me\" is always difficult. What you must know: (1) I'm a nerd. If you want to talk video games, LOTR or Doctor Who, we HAVE to sit down for a bourbon or a coffee. (2) Yes, I will be out on that dance floor with you snapping away while joining in on the fun. And (3), while I'm a photographer first, supporting you during the planning process feels crucial to me - from building a timeline to having your back any way I can.\n\nMy name is Stephanie and I am a Photographer that leads with intention. You can find me following you around on your wedding day crying at how beautiful you are and getting giddy as we get the shot. I am dying to do the HOTTOGO dance with one of my couples on the dance floor. Fireside Sparrow leaned into weddings in 2020, so you can trust me, I've been through it, seen it, and promise you that I have GOT YOU on your wedding day.\n\nYou know that all encompassing feeling when you’re revisiting a vivid memory? You can smell the fresh air, feel the way the sun hits your face just so, hear the voice of the loved one next to you, remember the joke that they delivered and instantly you’re laughing all over again. That magic is what I hope to capture as your photographer. It’s my job to hold those moments in time so that they don’t have to fade. You’ll forever be able to revisit the moment, see the exact way they smiled, revisit that incredible sunset, relive the memory and turn back time.\n\nI believe love is love and happily photograph couples of all backgrounds, orientations, religions and gender expressions. I aim to create authentic and emotive images for my clients and edit true to color so the work will be timeless. My personality is friendly and warm, which helps make my couples feel at ease and open up in front of the camera. I donate $100 from every wedding day package to a non profit organization (either the ACLU, End the Backlog or the Triple Negative Breast Cancer Foundation) because I believe paying it forward in honor of love is an excellent first step into marriage.\n\nHello!! My name is Lyn! I am a long time wedding photographer who’s also a wife, mom of three, a soldier in the US Army, and an EMT! I love my passion for photography and it’s made me a stay at home mom for quite some time now! I look forward to connecting with all of you beautiful brides planning your magical day!\n\nWhen I’m not photographing freaking awesome people, you can find me sitting on the couch in my husband's pajama pants, drinking coffee, snuggling my pets, and editing. Coffee and snuggles are my two primary love languages. My favorite Netflix binges are The Office, Shameless, and Friday Night Lights. Clear eyes, full heart. Speed date: I’m obsessed with Vermont, avocados, dark chocolate, and cats. Pinterest is only my friend for recipes. My favorite fair food is fried dough but I’m allergic to it - what kind of cruel joke is that? I didn’t study photography in college (gasp), but I did study music, and that kind of relates...right?\n\nI'm Carroll, a photographer for those who love to live a happy, fun life! I'm married to the most amazing man and together we hike, travel, eat a lot of Chinese food, and watch WAY too many Friends reruns (which explains my crazy love for coffee). I'm also a fur-mom to the two most adorable (and spoiled) little fur-babies, Levi and Chloe. The more you get to know me, you’ll realize how much I love the simple moments of life and to make the most of it all!\n\nI began shooting weddings in 2011 and have shot over 300 weddings from coast to coast, north and south, and in Europe. I was born on a dirt road in Texas but raised in New York. The Hudson Valley has been my home for over 30 years. I have a passion for riding my motorcycle Betty, travel, hiking, my 2 huskies, my rescue cats, and my 100+ thriving houseplants. I have a bachelors degree in Fine Art Photography and a minor in Art History. My approach to photography is deeply rooted in my love an appreciation for art and the human form. As someone who loves love, I know how special your day is. My goal is to capture that magic.\n\nIf you're looking for someone to preserve your memories in a candid and true-to-life style, then let's talk! I love capturing all aspects of your wedding day from fun portraits of you and your partner to candid moments among your guests. I'm going to work with you to figure out what package fits your needs and what exactly you want to capture on your wedding day.

I am also recently engaged! In case we haven't met before, let me tell you a little bit about myself! My favorite band is Panic! At The Disco, my favorite show in the world right now is Schitt’s Creek, and I have a cat named Cricket, who is my entire world! I am known for my candid, romantic, and artistic photography with a hint of modernity. My ultimate goal is to show the, love, beauty, strength and enthusiasm of people through my photos. I feel so fortunate to be located in the Hudson Valley. It’s truly one of the the best places to get married!\n\nI have been photographing weddings for 12 years and I love every second of it! I live in the Hudson Valley, but I travel all over the world for weddings. I started photographing weddings in college on the side and once I graduated I knew I wanted to continue to pursue weddings! If you'd like to inquire, please do so through my website!\n\nI grew up in Amagansett, NY, one town away from Montauk, hanging out at the ocean, riding horses, and photographing my plastic Breyer horse models in different scenarios with my little crappy film camera, always searching for the perfect light. I have since moved on to photographing people with better equipment and I still always search for that perfect light. I now live in the lovely Hudson Valley after a long stint in NYC and Brooklyn where I trained under fashion and editorial photographers before starting my own photography business almost 20 years ago. Full disclosure, I'm a little scared of the ocean.\n\nHello, my name is Luis Pauta ,I started working since 2000 in a photography studio which offered photography and video services, in my native country Ecuador especial thanks to my mentor my friend J bravo. Then I came to the United States in 2014.

Wedding albums & Prints are also available!\n\nTwo Upper West Siders. Twenty blocks apart. How had we not crossed paths before? Or did we? Well, after finally matching on Hinge we made that happen and the rest is history! We have combined families and now as a family of 7 (three dogs, two cats) we have become an unstoppable force. We both share the same passion for photography, capturing the beauty all around us and making magic happen. Our dog Lucy, embodies love, kindness and poise. We couldn’t imagine naming our business after anyone but her. That’s how Love, Lucy Photography came to be.\n\nWell hello. I'm Kristen, the owner and lead photographer at Little But Fierce Photography. I have been in business since 2016 and have photographed over 200 weddings and elopements in that time and numerous other couples and events. I have my master's degree in photography, gadgets and gizmos a plenty, and am prepared for all situations.\n\nIf I have a camera in my hands, then I am most definitely smiling. Photography has been my passion since I was a teenager and I love bringing that passion to weddings. I strive to capture all the intimate details that make a wedding truly personal. Don't be surprised if you see me crying during the parent dances, it's one of my favorite moments :)\n\nIt’s Katie if you haven’t guessed already! I’m a photographer in the Hudson Valley. My goal is to give you the newest best friend you didn’t ask for and an incredible memory you get to keep forever. I live for the giggles, full heart felt moments and even shed a tear or two at almost every wedding I attend (just because I am so freaking happy). I can’t help but be so deeply intertwined in the moment that I get lost in the love and magic of it all.\n\nHi there! I'm Sandi, a Hudson Valley wedding photographer, musician, and yoga teacher! I have over 6 years of photography experience and a Certification in digital photography from Cornell University! I also have over 20 years of flute and voice experience and I studied both in college. Recently, I've also received my 200 hour yoga teacher certification and am now offering wedding day yoga! I just adore weddings and I adore being a part of people's most special memories! There is nothing I love more than the joy that sharing in someone's special day! Congratulations on your engagement, I can wait to make memories together!\n\nI’m the self-declared winner of “most likely to hear someone’s life story in unexpected places.” Whether it’s an antique shop owner telling me about her and her late husband’s favorite meal from their Italian vacation 40 years ago, or a fellow TJ Maxx customer recalling how she met her best friend of 17 years in a shared hospital room, I listen. And not a polite listen, but an I really give a shit listen. At the core of my being, I’m story obsessed. It’s why I was an English major in college and why I fell in love with photography. If there is a story to be heard, I will listen. And if there's a story to be told, I'll tell it.\n\nAfter being around weddings for years, I've found my place in specializing in intimate weddings, where I aim to encapsulate the distinct essence of every couple's love story through my lens.

I'm Nina. I'm a pretty energetic and charismatic person that loves love and enjoys life. Documenting through photo is my favorite thing on this planet. I've been a professional photographer since 2016 but really I've been invested in photography since I was 15 years old. My love for documenting moments came from a desire to capture my own life and that of my friends using disposable cameras to using flip phone cameras and point and shoot digital cameras on beach trips with friends. I have used writing, art, and photo to document my life and it is an incredibly special thing to be able to share that with my clients.\n\nSearching for a Catskills wedding photographer who combines expertise and imagination?

I started this business 6 years ago with the hope that I would be able to have a career based around things I love, which happen to be pretty dresses, sweet vows, and long veils. 6 years later I have been published, traveled all over, and have shot well over 175 stunning weddings!\n\nRebecca has been working as a professional photographer for over 10 years.

Here's my photography short story: 2017, after 13 years of teaching, I said goodbye to the classroom and pursued Olympic weightlifting photography- my company was Everyday Lifters. Shortly after, I launched my wedding business. The Long Version: Weightlifting has taken me to places like Turkmenistan, Germany, & across the country! The weightlifters started getting married, and along the way, I received training to advocate for diverse bodies as a photographer. During this time of transition, I started taking documenting courses through the International Center of Photography and work on documenting local stories.\n\nWelcome! I'm Anita. I aim to freeze moments in time, ensuring they never fade away. Picture this: the exact curve of a smile, the hues of an unforgettable sunset, the ability to relive a cherished memory and rewind time. I value creating a safe haven for every facet of your humanity. Whether you're camera-shy or uncertain about interacting with a stranger, I strive to make the process comfortable. Let's not just capture moments; let's craft an experience where, perhaps, we'll both discover a new friend in the making.\n\nAhh you made it this far and I am so happy that you are here. Come get to know me a little bit better… I am a Hudson Valley photographer who occasionally dips their toes in NJ too. Having fun and capturing special moment with your loved ones and families is what makes my day. I am a girl mom to my favorite tiny human RyRy and a fire fighters’ wife and when you don’t see me behind a camera or working my full-time job as a graphic designer, I am usually soaking up the sun at the beach or outdoors doing something fun with my family.\n\nI’m Cass, and I truly LOVE what I do! Everyone has a story; my lifelong love for creativity and background in the Arts have played a huge role in developing my own personal photography style and it's made me who I am today! Born and raised in the gorgeous Hudson Valley, I've always loved being outdoors. Incorporating the beauty of nature and landscapes into my work is one of my favorite things!\n\nAs a photographer, I want to capture your happiest moments and your greatest achievements. I absolutely love working with people and creating long-lasting relationships. Making people laugh and have fun is something that comes naturally to me. I want to create authentic moments, bring magic to adventures, and make beautiful memories that will last a lifetime. So, can I help you capture your story?\n\nHi, I'm Jen -- a semi-awkward, nice person and a wedding photographer based out of the Catskills of New York. I am a huge fan of dogs. I love to tell stories -- even more so, I love to tell side stories, so rambling - I guess I just love rambling. I'm down to earth - easy going - and always intimated by writing descriptions about myself.\n\nI am incredibly passionate about capturing real-life emotions. I utilize warm, earthy tones to portray the special intimate moments between couples. I also like to think I'm pretty easy to get along with, usually hilarious, and will be your ultimate cheerleader. I also like cake. And parties, so... I've found my true calling with weddings for sure.\n\nI like to find beauty in the balance between the shadows and the light. They are rarely inseparable. They are complex and totally opposite and yet they can not live without the other. Just like real connection. What is real is beautiful. Only love is real. Your wedding day is important. To you. To your families. To me. And I don’t take it lightly. I understand that you’ve never done this before and you may not even know where to start! Don’t worry- I got you!\n\nRaquel Reis Photography is woman-owned and operated. We are LGBTQ+ friendly, affirming, and experienced.

What I do involves the best thing in the world and that's to captivate cherishable moments of life, love, and memories through photography. During this new transition in my life, I learned that photography isn't something you \"do\", it's something you grow into and boy did it grow! Each day I learned new techniques, researched any information on photography, and took part in classes to strengthen my skills. As a result, this new insight was birthed off of how I visualize the world's most intimate moments and turn it into art.\n\nI'm Alex. I spend my free time with my husband and our dogs Conor & Belle. I'm lucky to live in the Hudson Valley surrounded by amazing nature and upstate lifestyle. Art is something that I fell in love with at a young age and has always carried me through life- it lead me to photography. The mixture of art and emotion is one of the things I love most about wedding photography. When you look through your collection of photos I want you to feel and see the emotion, love and fun you had on your best day ever.\n\nHi! I'm Maria! I am a New York based fine-art wedding photographer that longs to capture real and authentic love anywhere and everywhere. I say Fine Art because I actually have a fine arts degree in photography. I am a happy wife who mar­ried her high-school sweetheart, an art book hoarder and slightly dog obsessed. I have loved photographing for as long as I can remember.\n\nOur names are Erica & Rachel and we make up EricaLee Photography. Best friends for 17 years, sisters-in-law for 13.

It is the natural way of our brains to make space for the presence - that is why photographs are some of our most cherished and irreplaceable possessions. In my teens, I got my first film SLR and fell in love with visualizing emotions & documenting life on this incredible planet.\n\nIf there is anything I'd love for you to know the most about me, it's this: I will show up for you with compassion, courage and patience (and a little unconventional when inspired). My superhero strength is to see things that you don't; capturing significant moments or your 'perfect side.' I will transform your misconceptions about how you look on camera. It's empowering. I want to do that for you. I received my BFA in fine-arts from Pratt Institute and shot my first wedding in 1992. Photomuse was founded in 2002 and has gone on to become an award-winning photography studio.\n\nHey there love! I’m Malyssa, the onewoman circus behind M Quay Photography. I fell in love with photography one morning while I was waiting at the bus stop. Since then I've been seeing the beauty in everything. I want to be the person who helps you see your inner beauty.

And maybe take some photos of you in the process.\n\nAs a natural light photographer, I have a deep love for capturing the most beautiful moments that life presents. My passion lies in preserving these precious memories through my lens. I strive to showcase the magic and authenticity found in everyday moments. Through my photography, I aim to create images that inspire and evoke emotions in those who view them.\n\nWhen I’m not photographing amazing people, you'll find me hiking in the Hudson Valley with my family, brunching with my girlfriends, or planning my next vacation (mostly likely on a beach somewhere). I'm obsessed with warm weather, family gatherings, and sunsets. When it's chilly out, you'll find me with a hot cocoa in hand. If there's music on, it's likely country or throwback 80s jams. ALL people and love stories are welcome here!\n\nHi! We're Jeremiah & Cody. We met working in a music store in 2009 and instantly became like brothers (\"Did we just become best friends?\" \"YUP!\"). In 2011, Jeremiah's wife volunteered him to shoot her sister's wedding and he genuinely enjoyed it. So, he began shooting weddings. In 2016, Cody graduated RIT with a Visual Arts degree and was looking for his next move. Luckily for all of us, Jeremiah talked Cody into relocating to the Hudson Valley to help him with his weddings. And here we are! The two of us get really excited to take really cool pictures.\n\nI am a Hudson Valley, NY based wedding photographer with a focus on a Photojournalistic shooting style.

We'll capture the day's vibe, allowing you to look back and relive it like a movie.\n\nI am a wedding photographer with 8+ years experience in the business, although my photographic journey began years before that. For as long as I can remember, I have had a passion for travel and landscape photography. Today my wedding photography is deeply influenced by the natural beauty found in the scenery around us, as well as the important moments between a couple. I am also a science and math teacher, and I have a background in Marine Biology. I think one reason I am a good wedding photographer is my keen sense of observation and attention to detail! Whenever I have free time I love to cook and travel with my wife, brew beer, and run.\n\nMy passion for photography started at a very young age. Polaroid,Kodak, disposable cameras anything I could get my hands on for as long as I can remember. After working for several years in photojournalism and editing I decided to make the switch to a full time wedding photographer in 2010. I haven’t looked back since. I love the rush and excitement of the wedding day. The ability to meet new people and travel new places. Every weekend I get to experience different families, friends, foods and cultures. It’s not a job it’s a gift. My gift in return to you is images I pour my heart and soul into.\n\nI’m known for documenting candid moments in a bright and vibrant way. I love capturing and creating narratives from start to finish - being a wedding photographer and videographer is the ultimate storytelling experience, and it’s one of my greatest joys. Weddings feel like home to me. I’ve found that it’s hard for me to stop smiling throughout the day, and even afterward, during the editing process. There’s just something about weddings that gets my heart all aflutter.\n\nConsidered one of the best wedding photographers in the Hudson Valley, Allan Levine has worked as a professional photographer and photojournalist photographing weddings full-time since 2004.

My parents, photographers Wendy & Charlie McCarthy began Weefan Photography in 2001. At 11, I started watching them photograph events and weddings, and the first wedding I photographed, just as I remember my first day of school. For the past fourteen years, I have mastered each and every job related to the wedding photography business. After graduating from Siena college in 2019, I was invited by my parents to manage our family's business of professional photography, and assume the duties of managing our New York Office. ​\n\nHi, I'm Brea- a wedding photographer based out of New York's Hudson Valley, but will gladly travel wherever your love story takes you. My goal is for you to not just 'see' your images, but to really feel them too. That is why building a connection with my clients is so important to me. I care so much about the couples I get to work with and get so excited to be able to visually tell their story in a way that is unique to them.\n\nWe know you're probably feeling some pressure to select a wonderful photographer to document your wedding since your photographs are the only part of your wedding that are remaining once the wedding day itself is over. Selecting the photographer for you is fairly easy… you should feel a connection straight away after reviewing our portfolio, and know that we’ll capture the both of you, your wedding, your family and friends in a wonderful truthful and beautiful way that will last forever. Sometimes, it’s as simple as that…feeling it!\n\nIn addition to Wedding Photography, I'm a contract photographer for ZUMA Press and Everett Collection. I've been published in numerous publications and was a winner in PDN Magazine’s Ultimate Music Photo Contest – “Performance.” I have the experience and the passion that enables me to get the best photos. I try to capture the perfect moments of the wedding.\n\nIn the early years of my photography career, I learned very fast that what is most important is not me, but you. It sounds so simple but most photographers/artists think differently. You should hire someone who has exceptional talent, who listens, who works as hard as possible and of course, is fun to be around. It may sound cliche, but I really use my passion and skill to the fullest and all you have to do is have a great time! Through good planning and a passion for photographing people, I will capture the very best of you while making sure you enjoy your friends, family, and of course, your first day as a married couple.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am a husband and a father. My wife, Erin, son, Alfie, daughter, Millie and our two dogs, Archie and Betty, are my source of inspiration. They are the reason that I am able to do what I love to do, and that is to tell love stories. My first art medium was music. I spent a decade touring with my band Steel Train before seamlessly transitioning into a camera. I was quickly taken over by the emotion and power a camera can hold and I became obsessed with the ability to capture moments. After I photographed my first wedding, I simply fell in love with capturing people in love.\n\nMy style is all about getting the most kick-ass wedding photos in the most candid way possible. No need to worry about where to stand, where to put your hands, or how to smile on command. I've got you covered with cues and prompts to keep you comfortable, confident, and looking fuckin' amazing!\n\nI am not a photoshop effect photographer doing tricks after the actual event, nor am I a Pinterest copycat. I strive to document real moments, all the joy and tears, hugs and cheers. while creating portraits that remind you of all the feels of your wedding day. My years of experience working with tight deadlines under pressure has given me the ability to create art no matter what. Be there rain or snow or fog or a sunny beautiful day, I will be prepared. you will get to experience joy and love and not feel like anything is contrived. And we will laugh together - a lot! So let me tell your story. I promise I will tell it beautifully\n\nMy style is warm, edgy, authentic & documentary. I am energetic, a true romantic, fun & your biggest cheerleader.

My style is all about photographing your authentic selves & who you are as a couple, I use fun prompts and lots of movement, which makes for a fun experience and captures you naturally. No stiff posing or fake smiles here!\n\nThe most joyful day of your life is made up of infinite infinitesimal moments. They can be fleeting, yet so incredibly significant. Mom's split-second tear, barely formed, before getting wiped away. That inimitable look in his eyes, the very first time he sees you in your dress. I guarantee you that 100% of my energy will be put forth into capturing them in a way you will absolutely never forget. We promise not to nickel-and-dime you. We promise not to make the day about us.\n\nHi! I’m Lin Pernille (pur-NIL), the photographer & videographer behind Lin Pernille LLC. I’m based in Hudson Valley, NY but I’ll travel just about anywhere for a wedding! I fell in love with wedding photography when I shot my first wedding at 18 years old. I quickly realized that weddings combined every genre of photography that I loved: photojournalism, still life, portraiture, fashion, and beauty. When I was 20 years old, during my junior year in college, I knew that I had found my passion and decided to officially incorporate my photography business.\n\nI've been a professional wedding and portrait photographer since 2007. My favorite thing about weddings??? It's THAT moment. It's different at every single wedding. But it's the moment when a tingle runs down my spine because I know I just caught a photo that is epically special. And I know that my clients are going to absolutely melt when they see *that* photo. When I'm not taking photos, you'll find me wandering through the woods or thrift stores (my two favorite places), eating way too much dark chocolate (my greatest love), or tending to my ever-increasingly large family of plants (I may have a real problem).\n\nWhen I don't have a camera in my hands, you can find me obsessing over the Moon, day-dreaming about eating eat ice cream and pizza for every meal, and I will 100% try to fit astrology or quotes from The Office into any conversation (see: \"that's what she said\").\n\nHi. I'm Steve. I have found my passion in photographing weddings. After shooting my first wedding (which was a last minute, three day notice, emergency for a co-worker) I realized this is what I want to do with my life. Maybe I'm a romantic, I'm not sure, but here I am. I work with several other photographers in the area. I felt it was important to do my best to create a large network of wedding professionals so I have plenty of photographers to bring in as second shooters or back-ups.\n\nI'm Gill!! So nice to meet ya. Telling stories through photographs is kinda my thing! I love capturing the raw emotions and true relationships between families and couples. I am a golden hour LOVER - the light that it brings to the photos are always so beautiful. And each golden hour is so different from each other which makes it so unique! Every couple, every family is different and has their own story. Let me tell yours.\n\nI have photographed hundreds of weddings all over the Hudson Valley since 2008 and have made some life long friends and clients over the years. My goal is to not just hand over digital files at the end of the day, but to leave with a connection to the bride and groom, one that will not only be reflected in the images from the day, but also possibly bring us back together for all the future milestones in your life together.\n\nI look at the world through the lens of a camera and have always appreciated everything it has to offer. I make sure to capture the defining moments at your special celebration, where each photograph is timeless and unforgettable. My photographers and I don't miss a single moment on your wedding day…our obsession with detail is what helps us ensure every single moment captured!\n\nI have a very photojournalistic approach to a wedding day — I want to capture all of the beautiful, loving, silly and fun moments as they unfold with warmth and honesty. When it comes to portraits, I love to get more editorial and incorporate bits of what makes you, you (as a couple) with the surrounding light, nature and architecture. Most importantly, when you look back at your photos I want you to remember how it felt.\n\nMoments. Details. Emotions. These are the things that define you, your life and your most important events. How do you want to remember them? My approach is to be as non-invasive and invisible as possible. The less you know I am there, the more reality I am able to capture. I do not want to be a director. I want to be an observer; a documentarian; most importantly, a story teller. Each moment in your life builds a story. That story deserves to be relived and passed on. i want to help you remember those moments, those details, those emotions that make up your life.\n\nI´m so excited you are here. I’m a wedding and portrait photographer located in Warwick, New York. I photograph weddings in the Hudson Valley, NYC tri-state area and beyond.

I've been photographing weddings for 5 years now and never get tired of capturing the joy and beauty surrounding a couple at the start of their marriage. I consider what I do an immense privilege and find true joy in serving my couples on one of the most important days of their lives.\n\nHi! I'm a former Washington DC native, now residing in the Hudson Valley. I found work in weddings while I was in college and I fell in love and never looked back. I've been making photographs for eight years, and have been photographing weddings for four years.\n\nI was born and partially raised in Southern California. After a few years + an exceptionally long cross country road trip - my parents decided to move us to the east coast. We've been complaining about the beaches ever since. My sister was always the artistic one. She sold her first piece while she was still in middle school, it took me a lot longer to figure out what I wanted to do. When I started doing photography - I honestly didn't realize how much I'd love it. It's not just about the lighting, filter, or the pursuit of the perfect Instagram feed. Sometimes it means going into the ocean to get the perfect shot.\n\nArmed with a BFA Degree in Photography from Carson Newman College, Scott has produced an impressive portfolio in his 17 years working as a full-time photographer in the industry.

My name is Marilyn and I'm so glad you're here ♡ I am a couples + wedding photographer based in New York City, and happy to travel to wherever your day is at! I've had pink hair for the last 6 years so at this point it has become a personality trait and I'm 100% okay with it. I love the outdoors, pat every dog I can, and thrive on ben and jerry's. My ideal place to be would likely be frolicking in wildflowers in a dress that's way too long, but the longer the better. The patio of my NYC apartment with a good book is a close second favorite though, for sure.\n\nHey there, my name is Bailey!
