        "text": "Lt. Paul Adam - Obituary\n\nFriday, September 11, 2015\n\nPaul C. Adam, age 54, resident of Pulaski since 1988, formerly of Fair Haven, passed away Tuesday at Crouse Hospital in Syracuse.\n\nPaul was born November 28, 1960 in Callicoon, NY, the son of Richard and Mary Louise McGrath Adam. He graduated from Callicoon High School in 1978 and C.W. Post College on Long Island with a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice. Paul married Cynthia R. Johnson on June 4, 1988. He was employed by the Department of Environmental Conservation as an ECO for 26 years, retiring in 2013 as a Lieutenant in charge of the training facility for the DEC in Pulaski. He was previously employed by the NYS University Police at SUNY Oswego for 4 years. Paul was a member of the Christ Our Light Parish in Pulaski, NYS DEC Retired Officers Association, the Fraternal Order of Police and various conservation related associations. Paul received during his tenure as an ECO, the Director's Commendation for Service to the Department of Law Enforcement, and he briefly served for the DEC at Ground Zero post 9/11.\n\nPaul not only was a dedicated husband and father, he was also an outdoor enthusiast, spending many happy hours on the St. Lawrence River and will truly be missed.\n\nSurviving are his wife, Cynthia; one son, Nathan B. Adam of Pulaski; and one daughter, Lauren A. Adam of Pulaski; two brothers, John (Sharyn) Adam of Redcreek and Kurt Adam of Jamesville; two sisters, Jane Houck of Wolcott and Nora (John) Bartholomew of Oswego; and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nFuneral Services will be held 11 a.m., Monday September 14, at Christ Our Light Parish, 23 Niagara Street, Pulaski with burial at the convenience of the family. Calling hours will be held from 3 to 6 p.m. Sunday at the Foster-Hax Funeral Home, 52 Park Street, Pulaski.\n\nfosterhaxfuneralhome.com\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Paul C.

The school also trains officers from other agencies — including two of the graduates on who are members of the Saratoga Springs force.\n\nNew York City, Buffalo and Rochester are among the police agencies in New York that also have their own certified mounted police, said Lt. Walter Schedel, zone commander for the State Park Police Hudson Valley District / Saratoga Zone.\n\nA mounted officer is worth 10 to 20 officers, said State Park Police Officer Zachary Voegler.\n\nThe horse's height allows officers to see farther, and for people to see them, Voegler said.\n\nOfficers on horseback can access more areas than they can with patrol cars, and at about eight feet long, the animals themselves are a movable barrier for crowd control, Pelzer said. People also are more inclined to speak with police who are on a horse rather than in a car.\n\nTraining begins with getting the right horse.\n\nAll of the horses are donated; some are retired racing thoroughbreds, others were logging horses, and one used to be a jousting horse, Pelzer said.\n\nDuring a 90-day trial period, trainers look at the horse's temperament, physical condition and ability to take direction, he said, noting, \"More go back than stay.\"\n\nOne who passed the test is named King, now 24. He came to the State Park Police at age 2 after pulling carriages, so he was used to interacting with the public.\n\n\"King caught right on,\" Pelzer said.\n\nIt was clear to see King was a favorite in the unit, though he has to be kept away from confiscated alcohol during DWI checks because, officers said, he has a liking for beer.\n\nUnlike police dogs, the horses are not certified. It's their riders who are. The officers must learn how to ride, condition and take care of the horses. The mounted police learn to break up fights, put tickets on car windshields and even take people into custody all without getting off the horse.\n\nThe most difficult part is the sensitivity training for the horses, Barney said.\n\nOn duty, the horses will face barriers, surfaces they're uncomfortable walking on and loud noises. Pelzer sprayed a fire extinguisher at random giving off a loud sound. The horses and their riders gave a startled jump. The second time, they didn't flinch.\n\n\"They may jump as you would, but they don't spin around and run away,\" Pelzer said.\n\nFrisbees, umbrellas and even footballs are used to get the horses used to moving objects that would normally frighten them.\n\n\"The horse needs to learn that it can trust its rider and it's not going to be hurt,\" Pelzer said. The officers switch horses frequently so they can get accustomed to different animals and the horses get to know different handlers.\n\nSunday's Lady Antebellum concert at SPAC was the first event for the mounted unit beginning a season of fireworks, concerts, festivals and fairs.\n\nMounted officers catch the attention of people, especially children, Pelzer said.\n\n\"People respond to police in a positive manner when they're on a horse, and those who don't — respond anyway,\" he said. \"Nobody ever wanted to pet my patrol car.\"\n\nArticle by kclukey@timesunion.com • 518-454-5467 • @KClukey_TU\n\nPBA of NYS to Gov. Cuomo: Don’t ‘Discount’ Patrons’ Right to Safe State Parks\n\nThursday, May 21, 2015\n\nPlease view the following press release issued by the PBA today\n\nPBA of NYS to Gov. Cuomo: Don’t ‘Discount’ Patrons’ Right to Safe State Parks\n\nLimited park police staffing is creating potential hazard.\n\nAs Gov. Cuomo welcomed vacationers ahead of the Memorial Day weekend, the union representing New York State Park Police urged his administration to address law enforcement staffing levels at state parks.\n\nResponding to the governor’s announced month-long discount at many state-owned campgrounds, the Police Benevolent Association of New York State Law Enforcement (PBA of NYS) renewed its warning that many of the state’s parks and campgrounds are understaffed, affecting emergency response times and rendering parks more vulnerable to crime.\n\n“We acknowledge and understand the administration’s desire to draw patrons to the state’s beautiful parks, campgrounds and historic sites, but discounts are designed to draw more people. Larger crowds will statistically lead to a greater need for increased police presence,” said Manny Vilar, PBA of NYS president. “We do not want the administration to ‘discount’ the fact that the Park Police are understaffed, creating situations where crimes of opportunity increase and the public is not as well protected.”\n\nThe PBA of NYS recently proposed legislation that would set minimum law enforcement staffing levels at state parks based on five-year attendance averages. Based on national law enforcement standards, the state Park Police force should have at least 385 members. There are 263 today. The bill would help ensure that trend is reversed and that parks have the proper policing levels.\n\nThere are more than 8,500 campsites in New York parks, including several around Niagara Falls, as well as major parks such as Allegany State Park in Cattaraugus County and Letchworth State Park in Western New York. The governor is promoting discounts at 31 of them.\n\nNew York drew roughly 63 million visitors to the 180 parks, concert venues, beaches and to its 35 historic sites last year. Since 2001 State Park policing has changed dramatically. State parks are regularly identified as soft targets, requiring highly trained police professionals. The PBA of NYS for years has asked the state to adopt a better system of staffing state parks.\n\n“Campgrounds in the Saratoga and Central New York regions are booked solid for the Memorial Day weekend,” said Troy Caupain, Park Police Officers director. “However, it is routine for a Park Police officer to be pulled from a campground to respond to a call many miles away, often leaving a site without an on-site police presence.”\n\nThe PBA of NYS continues to commend the state for authorizing new candidate academies for state Park Police – 35 recruits graduated in April. Due to attrition rates, membership has no overall net growth.\n\n“Whether a patron or family is enjoying Hither Hills State Park on the east end of Long Island or Lake Taghkanic State Park in Columbia County – a park designated for discounted camping rates – we don’t want a weekend of enjoyment to turn into a tragedy because a Park Police officer was not able to be there and assist,” Vilar said.\n\nThe PBA of New York State is the exclusive bargaining agent for the New York State University (SUNY) Police, the New York State Environmental Conservation Police, the New York State Park Police, and the New York State Forest Rangers. Our members police and protect New York State’s public universities and colleges; state parks and historic sites; and they enforce state laws and protect our lands and forests and ensure environmental safety and quality throughout the state.\n\n-30-\n\nMedia Advisory: Park Police and Forest Rangers in the press\n\nThursday, May 21, 2015\n\nLast week the PBA was active in the press on behalf of our State Park Police members when we highlighted how severe staffing shortages left many of our state parks with minimal or even no park police presence. It is a very important function for the PBA to use the media to inform the public of issues affecting both them and PBA members. See Media Coverage and other news postings on the home page from this week.\n\nWe also use the press to highlight PBA members’ value to NYS residents, visitors, and students. Yesterday the PBA sent out the attached advisory to several media outlets to alert them to the fact that our NY State Forest Rangers would be conducting swift water training exercises on the Black River near Watertown. The PBA’s proactive efforts in these regards are important because it gives the media notice of the training which allows them to inform the public of just how well trained our members are and how critical that training and responsiveness is when someone is in peril and needs to be rescued. This public support is important because everything the PBA tries obtaining for the members in Albany requires political power that comes with the public’s knowledge and backing of our importance.\n\nIf you know of other opportunities to highlight PBA members’ training, hard work, or proficiency, please contact the PBA and we will do our best to ensure the public is informed of these good deeds.\n\nPlease click on the link to the document below.\n\nSullivan County forest fire continues to burn\n\nMonday, May 04, 2015\n\nSUMMITVILLE - Fire companies will return to Shawangunk Ridge State Forest on Monday to fight the massive, five-alarm forest fire that is continuing to burn across the ridge.\n\nIt began as a stubborn brush fire near the Mamakating hamlet of Summitville around noon on Sunday. By nightfall about 30 acres of forest in the mountains above Summitville had been destroyed, according to Lori Severino, spokeswoman for the State Department of Environmental Conservation.\n\n\"There are six DEC forest rangers working on the fire along with five area fire departments,\" said Severino.\n\nA State Police helicopter dropped water over the burning forest, said Summitville First Assistant Chief Robert Hufcut.\n\nOfficials suspect the blaze was started by a homeowner who was burning rubbish outdoors in violation of the statewide burn ban. Towns with fewer than 20,000 residents are prohibited from burning brush from March 16 to May 14 in order to reduce the risk of brush fires during the dry season.\n\nMore than a dozen fire companies in the counties of Sullivan, Orange and Ulster also provided mutual aid.\n\nClick this link to view the Times-Herald Record post online.\n\nUpdate reported by Captain Drew Cavanagh (5/4/15 1:30 p.m.)\n\nFire is over 500 acres now with red flag conditions expected to continue. It will probably double in size by nightfall. 17 Forest Rangers there now and we are sending more. They have 2 helicopters there now and are bringing in more heavy equipment to construct fire lines. OEM has brought in a NY State Incident Management Team to oversee these efforts.\n\nUpdate reported by Captain Drew Cavanagh (5/4/15 2:40 p.m.)\n\nThe fire has now spread to over 825 acres. It is uncontained and growing.\n\nUpdated reported by Jim Hay (5/5/15 10:49 a.m.)\n\nof the state Incident Management Team says they have the wildfire 75 percent contained.\n\nclick here to view the Times Herald- Record post online.\n\nUpdate (5/6/15 4:40 p.m.)\n\nShawangunk Ridge Wildfire Nearing Containment\n\nOrange County-based state NYS Forest Ranger Scott Sabo monitors the Shawangunk Ridge wildfire from a perch along the ridge. Forest rangers from across the state have been deployed to fight the blaze, which has consumed more than four square miles this week.\n\nView stories and more photos here.\n\nPBA of New York Congratulates 35 State Park Police Academy Graduates\n\nThursday, April 02, 2015\n\nPBA of New York State Law Enforcement (PBA of NYS) offered congratulations to 35 of State Park Police Academy graduates of the 12th Basic School who successfully completed six months of training.\n\nThe officers today were joined by state officials, family members and instructors at a 1 p.m. graduation ceremony at the NYS Park Police Academy in Rensselaerville, Albany County.\n\n“We are proud and pleased to welcome 32 young men and three women to the ranks of the New York State Park Police,” said Manuel Vilar, PBA of NYS President and Park Police Sergeants Director. “They have undergone a rigorous physical and academic academy experience and proven themselves worthy to join a police force responsible for the protection and safety of 63 million annual state park visitors.”\n\nThe Park Police Academy is a paramilitary environment where cadets earn municipal police training certificates (MPTC). Cadets learn penal law; criminal procedures law (CPL); vehicle traffic law (VTL); public law; firearms and first-responder training, including CPR and defensive tactics. They also take an emergency vehicle operations course (EVOC); and receive training in taser use: radar and lidar detection, and learn to administer standardized field sobriety tests. They also receive specialized training in rope rescues, ice rescue, ATV use, snowmobile law enforcement and crowd control.\n\nWhile the PBA of NYS is grateful to have a new class of officers, union officials warned that ranks remain flat due to attrition and promotions. With these new officers, the staffing level will be 263. Of this number, there are 191 police officers statewide. The Park Police force patrols 180 state parks and 36 historic sites throughout the state.\n\nVisitors have long flock to New York’s most popular state parks, including Niagara Falls, Jones Beach on Long Island, Saratoga Spa State Park and Letchworth State Park in Livingston and Wyoming counties. On Long Island over the Memorial Day weekend, for example, park-goers could number more than 600,000, while 1.8 million total visitors will enjoy all of the state’s parks and historic sites over the same weekend.\n\n“These numbers do not add up to optimal standards for safety and crime prevention,” said Troy Caupain, the PBA of NYS’s Park Police Officers Director. “While we offer congratulations to a new class of professionals, we also urge the state to continue hosting academies and restoring the Park Police to levels that are appropriate for the protection and safety of all NYS residents and visitors to NYS Parks”.\n\nThe SUNY Police Pension Equity Bill\n\nMonday, February 09, 2015\n\nPlease select Read More for a summary of the History, Facts and Fallout.\n\nHistory:\n\nIn 1998, Governor George Pataki signed the SUNY Police bill which gave full police authority and responsibility to SUNY police officers. The passage of this bill however, did not authorize SUNY police officers to join the NYS Police & Fire Pension System.\n\nIn 2009, the New York State Tier 5 Retirement bill required all newly hired SUNY police officers to work until age 62 before retirement.\n\nIn 2010, the New York State Tier 6 Retirement bill required all newly hired SUNY police officers to work until age 63 before retirement.\n\nIn 2013, the State University of New York submits the SUNY Police Pension Equity bill to the New York State Legislature, but does not fund it.\n\nIn 2014, Governor Andrew Cuomo vetoed the SUNY Police Pension Equity bill saying, in part, this bill must be passed via the state’s legislative budgetary process.\n\nFacts:\n\nThe New York State Police & Fire Retirement System offers police officers a 20 or 25 year service retirement benefit.\n\n563 of New York’s police departments authorize their police officers to join the NYS Police & Fire Retirement System.\n\nThe only police department in the state that does not authorize their police officers to join the NYS Police & Fire Retirement System is the New York State University Police Department.\n\nFallout:\n\nNewly hired SUNY police officers are leaving SUNY, taking their training and police certification to police departments which offer a 20-25 retirement benefit, rather than having to work at SUNY Police until age 63 before retirement.\n\nSince the enactment of the Tier 5 Retirement bill, SUNY has lost more than 4 million dollars due to police officer attrition, and they project to lose more than double that in the next 5 years.\n\nSUNY Police Departments are having difficulty hiring and retaining female and minority police officers because other police departments are able to offer better retirement benefits.\n\nUnpredictable staffing levels caused by constant police officer attrition is making it more difficult for SUNY Police Departments to provide safe campus communities.\n\nRather than recruiting, hiring and training new police officers candidates, SUNY Police Departments are aggressively “recruiting” veteran SUNY police officers from other campuses.\n\nPotential SUNY police officer candidates are declining the hiring process upon learning they must work till age 63 before retirement.\n\nSupport the 2015-16 SUNY Pension Equity Bill - S.3221/A.4519 (click link to view the complete bill online)\n\nEmpire Blue Cross Email Scam Alert\n\nFriday, February 06, 2015\n\nThere is a scam email campaign targeting current and former Empire BCBS members asking members to click here for credit monitoring.

What Chancellor Zimpher failed to mention was the millions of dollars SUNY is losing as a result of an attrition crisis among its own police force.\n\nThis attrition crisis has been brewing since the state legislature passed the Tier 5 & 6 Retirement bills which, in part, raised the age of retirement for SUNY police officers to 62 and 63 years of age. As a result, newly hired SUNY police officers are waiting for their first job offer to take their training and experience to an agency that allows them to join the Police and Fire Retirement System, and retire after 20-25 years of service.\n\nChancellor Zimpher has recognized the crisis caused by the lack of pension equity among SUNY police officers, and submitted a bill which would have equalized pension and disability benefits for SUNY police with virtually all of the other 563 police departments in the state. But for unknown reasons, Chancellor Zimpher has refused to insert the bill into the state budget?\n\nInclusion of parity legislation for SUNY police officers in the budget would put an end to an enormous amount of fiscal waste at an already under-funded SUNY system. It costs SUNY more than $85,000 per officer to recruit, train and equip officers who are staying on the job for only a few years. More importantly, the measure would mitigate the increasingly untenable campus safety issue created by fewer officers being able to staff shifts.\n\n“This is not college level calculus – it’s grade school arithmetic. Do my police officers work 40 years at SUNY or 20-25 years at another police department?” said James McCartney, Director of the SUNY Officers Association.\n\nDuring her address, Chancellor Zimpher highlighted the positive impact the Governor’s Start-Up program is having on SUNY, saying, “Forty four schools have been approved for the program that is creating 310 new tax free areas on or near SUNY campuses.” What wasn’t mentioned was the impact the program would have on University Police resources; and how SUNY police departments can deliver the needed police services in the midst of an attrition crisis.\n\nThe Chancellor, however, has shown that she clearly believes in the strength and ability of the men and women policing SUNY campuses. In recent years she has pushed for attainment of the prestigious New York State Department of Criminal Justice Services Accreditation recognition for all SUNY Police Departments. She has added an expanded role in fighting the heroin epidemic, new sexual assault reporting measures, mandatory active shooter training and the deployment of SUNY officers to respond to natural disasters.\n\nChancellor Zimpher also mentioned the importance of diversity saying “with a more diverse system the better SUNY will be able to deliver the educational process.” Unfortunately, due to the lack of pension equity SUNY Police Departments are finding it increasing difficult to attract and retain female and minority officers, this matters when dealing with the sensitivity of a campus sexual assault, attempted suicide, mental illness and racial tensions on campus.\n\n“They simply can’t compete with the benefits package other police agencies offer, and the result is SUNY loses police officers who would make a great long-term impact with their diverse populations,” said Dan DeFedericis, Executive Director of the PBA of NYS.\n\nGovernor Cuomo Misses Opportunity to Fully Address SUNY Campus Crime\n\nWednesday, January 21, 2015\n\nThe Police Benevolent Association of New York State (PBANYS), the Union which represents nearly 600 New York State University Police Officers, Investigators and Lieutenants stationed throughout 29 SUNY campuses across New York State, was deeply disappointed the Administration failed to deal with the employment crisis plaguing the SUNY Police as part of his Opportunity Agenda and proposed Executive Budget.\n\nDuring his State of the State address, Governor Cuomo expressed his desire to see his SUNY sexual assault policy codified into state law. What Governor Cuomo failed to address was the crisis of SUNY's Police Department and its direct impact on the force’s ability to respond to incidents of sexual assault.\n\nThis is the second time in a month that the Governor did not take action to ensure the stability of the police workforce. In late December, the Governor vetoed a bill which would have equalized pension and disability benefits for SUNY police with virtually all of the other 563 police departments in the state. The indefensible discrepancy is the main contributing factor to turnover with SUNY police officers.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what policies the Governor wants. My officers are leaving SUNY to take jobs with police agencies that offer a better retirement and SUNY campuses are less safe as a result,” said James McCartney, Director of the SUNY Police Officers Association.\n\nThe crisis is so bad on SUNY campuses, SUNY administration officials have fully supported legislative efforts to create pension and disability parity for their officers. SUNY is currently losing millions of dollars due to recruiting, hiring and training police officers who quickly leave for other police employment around the state.\n\nMeanwhile, the Governor has shown that he clearly believes in the strength and ability of the men and women policing SUNY campuses. In recent years he’s not only added the new sexual assault policy but has added many new responsibilities to the force including the creation of Start-Up New York, an expanded role in fighting the heroin epidemic, new sexual assault reporting measures, mandatory active shooter training and the deployment of SUNY officers to respond to natural disasters.\n\nThe Governor also mentioned the importance of diversity in law enforcement. It is particularly important on SUNY’s multi-cultural campuses. The University Police Department strives for diversity in its ranks so the force reflects the population they serve. This matters when dealing with the sensitivity of a campus sexual assault, attempted suicide, mental illness and racial tensions on campus.\n\nHowever, many Police Departments are seeking qualified women and minority officers and SUNY Police Officers are often targeted for recruitment by municipalities because they are well trained and angered by the lack of parity with their fellow officers.\n\nFurthermore, inclusion of parity legislation for SUNY police officers in the budget would put an end to an enormous amount of fiscal waste at an already under-funded SUNY system. It costs SUNY more than $85,000 per officer to recruit, train and equip officers who are staying on the job for only a few years.\n\nMore importantly, the measure would mitigate the increasingly untenable campus safety issue created by fewer offers being able to staff shifts. It is a simple fact that campuses are much safer with a stable police force. Our officers are highly and uniquely trained for their environment.\n\n\"What's so heartbreaking is that both SUNY and SUNY police went to the Governor, explained how SUNY's police attrition crisis compromised our ability to respond to incidents of sexual assaults on SUNY campuses and he still hasn’t taken affirmation action to correct the problem,” said Dan De Federicis, Executive Director of the PBANYS."
