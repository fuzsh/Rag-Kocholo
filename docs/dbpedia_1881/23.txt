Havoc also expressed his opinion over the opportunity stating, “We would like to thank ESPN for choosing our record and for making it the anthem of one of the most important U.S. sports events of the year. We were absolutely excited to deliver a remix version of this classic and a visual to accompany the opening of ’NBA Countdown.’”

Affectionately known for their extensive knowledge of 90’s hip hop melodies, “NBA Countdown” will be a perfect spot for Mobb Deep’s classic song to live.
