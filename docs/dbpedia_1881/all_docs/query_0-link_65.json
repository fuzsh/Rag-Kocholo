        "text": "Eminem recently unveiled his new track, “Survival,” through a trailer for the upcoming video game Call of Duty: Ghosts, but his sudden return wasn’t the only thing that turned heads. The song featured a captivating refrain of “This is survival of the fittest/ This is do or die” from an unknown vocalist.\n\nThe 10 Wildest Rap Beefs of All Time, From Eminem to Kanye West\n\nTrending\n\nNow that singer has been unmasked and is getting her fair share of attention, including from MTV. Her name is Liz Rodrigues, and she sings in the band New Royales. The group has released just one track so far, a reimagining of Jefferson Airplane’s “Today,” but they’ve already been reportedly christened as “the new crack” by collaborator Dr. Dre and have worked with 50 Cent, Jay Electronica and Clipse."
