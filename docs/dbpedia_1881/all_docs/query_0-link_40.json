        "text": "What is another saying of the survival of the fittest?\n\n&quot;Natural selection&quot; is another saying that refers to the survival of the fittest, as individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits on to future generations.\n\nWhy is the statement survival of the fittest often misunderstood?\n\nThe term \"fittest\" is not actually \"fittest to survive\" but rather \"fittest to survive long enough to reproduce\". If one animal lives 20 years, but has 15 offspring, and another lives on 5 years, but manages to have 50 offspring, the latter example would be considered fore \"fit\" by the standards of Darwin's statement."
