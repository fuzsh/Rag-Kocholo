        "text": "This morning, I commenced my second read of \"We the Living,” a book by noted writer Ayn Rand that you’ll find to be an existential wake-up call. Set in the grim reality of post-revolutionary Russia, it follows Kira Argounova, a fierce young woman fighting tooth and nail to live life on her terms amidst the suffocating grip of Soviet communism. Rand's first novel is a raw, unfiltered look at what happens when a government puts the power elite above the everyday individual. It’s a story that offers a searing indictment of how totalitarian regimes crush human spirit and creativity. Kira’s defiance is a blazing torch in the dark, a reminder of the power of the individual against the monolith of the state. Fast forward to today’s America, and you can’t help but feel a chill down your spine. The themes in \"We the Living\" are more relevant than ever, echoing ominously in our current climate. Look around – polarization is off the charts, surveillance is tightening, and free speech is under siege. Rand’s narrative is a flashing red light, warning us of the creeping encroachment of totalitarian ideologies. The novel’s depiction of life under a regime that demands conformity and suppresses dissent should make us all sit up and take notice. The erosion of freedoms starts subtly, but if left unchecked, it can lead to a full-blown loss of autonomy and self-determination. Reading \"We the Living\" is essential if we want to grasp the existential threat of totalitarianism and authoritarianism lurking in America today. Rand doesn’t just tell a story – she screams a sobering warning like a howling jackal. The novel’s stark portrayal of a society where the state dictates every move is a gut punch, reminding us what’s at stake when power concentrates in the hands of a few. Folks, we need to wake up and smell the authoritarian coffee. This book is a call to arms for defending our freedoms and standing firm against authoritarian overreach. By diving into this raw and powerful narrative, we can reignite our commitment to preserving a free and open society before it’s too late. Stay tuned for my full review of Rand’s book and message in coming weeks by subscribing to my “Great Books, Great Minds” digital newsletter, a link of which is provided in my profile. #authoritarian #democracy\n\n𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐩, 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐞, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐨𝐜𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐛𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐭-𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐥𝐚𝐮𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐞𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐞𝐜𝐝𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐲 Gad Saad 𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐬 𝐢𝐭. Amplifying the \"must read “ness of this book is the core message of this book, fight for truth. In the current, caustic climate of deniers of objective truths, this book should serve as an antidote for all those ostriches who are willing to bring their heads out of the ground. If you are an ardent follower of Dr. Gad Saad, you might have come across most of the ideas discussed in this book already, however, getting this book is in a way immortalizing the ideas, and not being dependent on social media's existence for his contents. It takes courage to write a book like “𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐝” nowadays. It shouldn’t be the case that we congratulate each other whenever one of us has the guts to publicly address ideas that feeble minds deem unpleasant or upsetting, but here we all are in the 2020s. A time when simply exercising one’s freedom of thought and freedom of speech may land a person in the middle of a storm of threats and other forms of incredibly aggressive harassment, produced by none other than those claiming to protect civil rights and bring about social progress. The Parasitic Mind is a concept introduced by Gad Saad, a professor of evolutionary behavioral sciences and Darwinian consumption, in his book “The Parasitic Mind: How Infectious Ideas Are Killing Common Sense”. The idea revolves around the notion that certain ideas, which Saad calls “idea pathogens,” are spreading rapidly and harming society by undermining critical thinking, free speech, and intellectual freedom.

Full Review: https://lnkd.in/dHJHhyrH\n\n\"I face up to death but then I flip back into denial. Surely that's what it's like? I lie in bed in the small hours of the morning, absolutely terrified by the apprehension of my own dissolution...And then I go to sleep and wake up the morning and make toast.” - Will Self. I penned a few thoughts on dissonance this morning, and also explained why I prefer not to include the adjective 'cognitive'. The post was prompted by an image from Gaza, in which it appears both bombs and aid packages are falling from the sky. But the issue is not Gaza-specific. I believe we are living in an age of dissonance. What dissonance highlights that concepts like alienation, false consciousness and dislocation do not is the idea that our experience is defined by a lack or loss of agreement, *the sense that things that should fit together do not*. Our maps do not describe our territory. Dissonance is a relational idea at its heart, but the relationship in question is the most fundamental relationship of all, between the subject of experience and the object of inquiry; between ourselves and the world. In evolutionary theory, the Darwinian expression ‘survival of the fittest’ is often misunderstood to mean the survival of *the most fit*, as if it was about carrying the most coconuts or outrunning the fastest tigers. But the theory is really about the survival of *the most fitting*; those who survive are those whose physical traits, mental models and patterns of cooperation combine to best fit their context, niche or milieu, and who are protean enough to adapt to changes in those environments through heightened awareness and skilful sense-making. In the 21st century, our species will struggle to survive because it will struggle to fit. Perhaps the most pervasive source of dissonance arises in those who enjoy day-to-day life, know that the world has made extraordinary progress, and want to carry on with life as it is, and yet sense that everything has to change, and probably will. I share the following on technological dissonance, as a central feature of our time: \"Technology should be a force for good, but we don’t live in a world of wise elders who release it gradually to keep pace with our maturity as a species. Dissonance arises from the desire to believe in technology as a shared human endeavour for the greater good, while knowing that most world-changing technologies are injected into society’s bloodstream by commercially motivated private actors conducting simultaneous unsupervised experiments on a planetary scale.\" I think widespread dissonance is a sign that the world is becoming less intelligible. I also believe Jean Gebser's prophetic vision of the mental/rational function entering its 'deficient phase' feels truer than ever. The full reflection is here: https://lnkd.in/eQCfDdx9 🙏 JR\n\nFuture Crunch put language around what I've been feeling this week. On one hand, women's leadership, inclusive leadership and social innovations programs are moving forward, Claudia Goldin wins the Nobel Prize in economics because of her work on women's economics. This is what if feels like to be in hope. Possibility. But Israel and Palestine? \"The news is a lot right now. Israel is still reeling from the deadliest single day in its 75-year history, an indiscriminate massacre that killed over a thousand civilians in the most brutal manner imaginable. Two million people are now under siege in Gaza without food, water, medicine or power, and over a thousand are already dead. The horror of it all is compounded by the collective fear of what might yet be to come. Cynicism is easy because you're never wrong. If you keep on insisting the world is an awful place, and that it's only going to get worse, eventually a week like this comes along and proves you right. There was talk of peace in recent months, hope that something was changing. Overnight, that's been replaced by despair, and the familiar moral darkness that seems to hang so heavily over this part of the world. In the choice between barbarism and civilisation nobody should waffle, but what the past few days have also revealed is that a lot of people will mourn for dead Israeli civilians but not dead Palestinian ones, and a lot of people will mourn for dead Palestinian civilians but not dead Israeli ones. What has happened to our collective humanity? In times like this it feels strange to be writing a newsletter that celebrates progress. Disrespectful even. This is not a kumbaya though. Our aim isn't to say \"Look over here! There's good stuff too!\" Suffering isn't relative, there's no Benthamesque, cosmic scale weighing things up and pronouncing its verdict on world events. There are moments when the world feels like it hangs by a thread. This is one of them. We're feeling it intensely too, that sense of worry and fear. This week, our goal is just to stop you from going numb. The global media is chasing ambulances right now, and some point it's going to become too much. When you feel that, try to remember there's a big planet out there, and a lot of other stories surrounding the Israel-Gaza one. People in power on both sides want war. But they don’t speak for all. What we can do is keep showing up with our attention and our humanity. Don't switch off, stay with it.\" We are stronger together. Thank you, Future Crunch.\n\nThe book I want everyone to read: Naomi Klein, who’s written well-known tracts on climate change and the insane and psychopathic system that is capitalism, has just published another important and surprisingly beautiful book. It’s called Doppelgänger: A Trip into the Mirror World, and it investigates the political and social strangeness that covid unleashed. I read it in a whirl over the last two days, and there’s so much in it, but these are first thoughts on what landed strongly for me. Her book reminded me of the hope that came along with the virus; that it could be a reset (don’t go back to normal! - remember that?). The hope that we could all come together to cooperate on big, complex global issues that would require sacrifice for transformation. The excitement galvanised in all working together to meet a threat, working together in the service of the vulnerable. But it wasn’t long before that fractured, and suspicion crept in, and a sense of unity faded. And with it, my hopes for a real response to the far bigger issues approaching us fell. I know I can’t know what large, collective steps could truly work to save what we love. But I do know how small, collective work is changing me, and for that I am deeply grateful. And it’s here where, for me, Doppelgänger is such a profound read, with topics close to my passions and my work. The concept of the Doppelgänger - the secret double, the shadow, the one who carries all that we disown - is explored in a shattering, stunning way. There are many ways a culture hides what it cannot face, or is captured by unconsciousness. So I’m moved that she writes extensively about Indigenous dispossession of land and attempts at cultural annihilation, and her feeling that these facts are haunting contemporary culture, revealing themselves in the fantastical stories conspiracy communities create. Conspiracies are always telling some kind of truth. This is why it is important to give space and respect for all voices - hidden, shadowed things will be revealed. They can show us how to use the past - to understand what has been lost, and how we might integrate what we have repressed. I'm grateful I am that such a thoughtful, intelligent person has woven together many of the big questions I’ve been grappling with, and brought some sort of clarity to the complexity of the last few years. In the mix of the year-long course we’ll be beginning soon, I am excited to be including this book as suggested reading. There’s just a couple of spaces left, if you are interested in joining with us. https://lnkd.in/gw34n8u5\n\nEileen: “So, based on the trends that the social drinkers and the Dead Viziers have presented, and absent any unexpected global shocks – which by the way is a big assumption, are we concluding that classical, liberal democracies are being replaced inexorably by de facto autocracies?” Hayek: “I think yes – our personal sovereignty is being eroded as we travel down the road to economic serfdom. “You better stop, look around Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown.” [1] Eileen: “What about game-changing, global shocks: what do you think the odds are of armed civil or inter-nation conflicts?” Slow Pint: “Sadly, while I hope wiser heads will prevail or a remarkable leader will emerge, it seems to me that the possibility of conflict is increasing day by day as societal and geopolitical divisiveness intensifies. “Ah, the wars they will be fought again The holy dove, she will be caught again Bought and sold, and bought again The dove is never free. Ring the bells that still can ring Forget your perfect offering There is a crack, a crack in everything That's how the light gets in.” [2] Publican: “These scenarios reinforce our decision to abscond to Mayo. There, we can continue our work solving problems on behalf of what’s left of humankind. We are: “Blackbirds singing in the dead of night We’ll take our broken wings and learn to fly With our lives. We were only waiting for this moment to be free. Blackbirds will fly, blackbirds will fly, Into the light from a dark black night. [3] “To boot, we really like Mayo’s unique, live-and-let-live, Guided Communitarian Democracy governance model [4]. We can ensure that our children and grandchildren do not have to assume debts that we never agreed to incur. “We who are on the road must have a code that we can live by. The past is just a goodbye. We’ll teach our children well...and feed them on our dreams.” [5] Tbc… [1] “19th Nervous Breakdown”, Rolling Stones, 1966 [2] “Anthem”, Leonard Cohen, 1992 [3] “Blackbird”, Beatles, 1968 (adapted) [4] See: “Sumerian Vortex: Music from a Lost Civilization”, 2020 [5] “Teach Your Children”, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, 1969 (adapted)\n\nThank you Jesús Martín González for pointing this out and in fact there are two aspects I find highly commendable: a) Pay attention. Do not look away. Sharpen your senses for the problems around us and widen your circle of concern. b) It is not enough to steer clear from doing wrong - much more important would be to actively generate something good. But I am suspicious about effective altruism, particularly when it it is paired with long-termism. And there are many reasons for my suspicion - the difficulty to compare \"goods\", the underlying measurement biases, the abstractification...yet most of all it is the longtermism. This seems to give a lot of Silicon Valley moguls formidable excuses to act without compassion today and most importantly to upheld a \"technology will save us all, eventually\" picture which is highly problematic in the world of fundamental uncertainty we are in (where problems are created by us and our technologies). And yes - but that is not the problem of the initial idea - it also lends itself to authoritarian implementation, great man who decide now how mankind will live in Utopia in 300 years accepting collatoral damage on the way towards. https://lnkd.in/ePgbk8fc https://lnkd.in/ej-hjbtP\n\nI am supporting a new novelist who is also a friend and I am thrilled that the photo I took is now Jo McCarty's author photo! Here's the link to pre-order her book which is being released on April 1st! Here's the author's Amazon profile: https://lnkd.in/g3JdXdj7 Here's the book description: In a rural Michigan town, in a post-Covid world on the brink of a new disaster, Louie discovers an extraordinary ability—he can’t die. Fortuitous, if not for the small catch that he doesn’t want to live. While everyone else is desperately fighting to survive a global biotic crisis, Louie constantly seeks death only to be resurrected time and time again. Louie is the town nothing. If life was a school yard pick, he would be the last one on the team. Immortality is a burden, a cruel twist of fate, even as he wonders why him and what is he meant to do. But everything changes when Louie meets Katherine, a smart New York City woman determined to survive in this post-apocalyptic world. Finally, Louie has a reason to live, which is good timing because with each death he becomes weaker. It would be a love story if not for all the death and dying. Katherine and Louie aren’t living in utopia. There are other survivors who have their own ideas about the future. Ones they’re willing to kill for. Louie and Katherine must not only defend themselves and their resources from outsiders but fight against their own darker natures before Louie’s strange gift fades away. Amidst the chaos and despair, their story is one of hope, resilience, and redemption. Louie and Katherine, an unlikely modern-day Adam and Eve, will prove that even in the darkest of times, an ending can be a new beginning.

Bullshit isn't lying, its UNRELATED to truth. Understanding bullshit, is to really understand truth. This is a brilliant book. It's improved my science, business practices, meditation, and personal relationships. I've returned to it again and again over the years and each time I've discovered something new about how I was deceiving myself or other people. Barry Silverberg, a nonprofit expert gave it to me years ago when I founded my first nonprofit. He said it was the only thing I really needed to know about charities. Not in an unkind way, in a \"get this right\" kind of way. And its one piece of advice I profoundly appreciate years later. I think of #charities like #innovation for #government. They handle social problems governments haven't prepared to handle yet or missed. In that capacity, they are very similar to #startups and now #climate industries. Innovation involves uncertainty, and a lot of people respond to uncertainty with vague feelings of unease, and concealment in the form of bullshit. We all do it. Bullshit I mean. And once I realized what IT was, not lying but really avoiding clarification, it helped me a lot with gaining people's trust and being more productive in my personal life and relationships. It's fine to bullshit, as long as everyone knows you're bullshitting. Tall tales, myths, joking, all the things we do with our friends that allow us to let down our hair and creatively wander can open up creative insights and crack us up. But we need to have conscious control over bullshitting. Climate people don't bullshit on purpose, they bullshit by DEFAULT. We don't know what we're doing yet, there are no real experts, all our systems are built for extraction, and we made some real mistakes when we hurt Indigenous Peoples. Honestly, nothing we're doing now is truly working that well. And understanding that makes it a lot easier to be compassionate about problems. It's embarrassing and shameful to admit that the emperor has no clothes and you're a little bit lost. But it's also really freeing. Because then you can actually do something about it. ##climatechange #climateclock #actintime #climatecrisis #sustainability #climateactivism #activism #climatechange #ecoanxiety #lateristoolate #climatejustice #fairtrade #esg #environment #sustainability #sdg #savimbo https://lnkd.in/eJXFkWyk"
