        "text": "False Claims of Colonial Thieves is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nWhy Is Context Important?\n\nWhen studying a text, it is very important to comprehend its context. Context will help you to understand what the text is about and what the authorâs point of view is - key components of doing well in VCE English! Context is especially important for False Claims of Colonial Thieves because the authors frequently reference Australiaâs history. Even the title is a nod to its context - it is all about the âfalse claimsâ made by Australiaâs âcolonial thievesâ, or in other words, Australiaâs colonial settlers. Understanding what these false claims are will help you better understand the context and therefore, do significantly better in your English essays and assessments.\n\nTreat this blog as a starting point only. There is so much to learn about these topics, and I recommend you do your own research in addition to reading this blog. To help you do so, I have provided a reliable external source for each topic, so you can start exploring these claims in more depth.\n\nTerra Nullius\n\nOne of the biggest âfalse claimsâ that Papertalk Green and Kinsella refer to throughout their collaboration is the colonisersâ claim of Australia being terra nullius. When the British came to Australia, they claimed that the country was âno manâs landâ, denying that the Indigenous Australians had actually lived here for thousands of years. By pretending that no one lived in Australia, this supposedly gave the British âlegitimacyâ to assume control over the land and those already living on it - i.e. Australiaâs First Nations Peoples.\n\nTerra Nullius was used against the Indigenous peoples for many years to justify their horrific treatment. The principle was only overturned in 1992 when an Indigenous man, Eddie Mabo, challenged this claim in the High Court of Australia. Nowadays, we recognise that the Indigenous people were here significantly earlier than the colonisers and that their sovereignty (i.e. their power over the land) was never ceded.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://australian.museum/learn/first-nations/unsettled/recognising-invasions/terra-nullius/Â\n\nThe Stolen Generation\n\nAnother false claim was that the Indigenous people were inferior to white people. This claim led to the forcible removal of Indigenous children from their families, so they could be raised by âsuperiorâ white people and taught white cultures/languages - these children are referred to as the âStolen Generationâ because they were taken away from their families without their consent.\n\nIt was thought that placing Aboriginal children (especially mixed-race Aboriginal children) with white families would make it easier to teach Aboriginal children the âproperâ (British) way of living. They were either placed in institutions or adopted by white families, and often faced terrible treatment, including violence, neglect and assault. Neither the children who were removed nor their families have fully recovered from this appalling policy that continued until the 1970s.\n\nIndeed, the effects of the Stolen Generation can still be felt today. One of the major consequences discussed by Papertalk Green and Kinsella is that a lot of Indigenous culture was lost. Many of the children who were taken away were forbidden from practising their cultural traditions or from speaking their Indigenous languages. This ban led to many traditions going extinct and is a tragic effect of this heinous false claim.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/stolen-generationsÂ\n\nMissions and ReservesÂ\n\nAnother claim explored in the text is the idea that Indigenous peoples could not look after themselves and would be better off with white people âprotectingâ them. This led to the government forcing Aboriginal people to leave their ancestral lands and relocate to newer, smaller areas - a process known as land alienation. There were two types of this land - missions and reserves - and Aboriginal people faced poor treatment on both.\n\nMissions were usually run by Christian groups so they could convert the Indigenous people to their religion. There was a strong degree of control exercised over these Indigenous people, who were expected to learn the skills required for menial jobs (such as cooking and cleaning). Contrastingly, those living on reserves were not typically subject to as much control. These people were sometimes provided with rations from the government, but there were not usually officials to oversee them.\n\nBoth missions and reserves are referred to in False Claims of Colonial Thieves, so it is important to understand the difference between the two.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/missions-stations-and-reservesÂ\n\nNow that weâve examined some of the more historical context, letâs take a closer look at the contemporary and modern background that Kinsella and Papertalk Green write about.\n\nClose the Gap Campaign and Black Deaths in Custody\n\nA key section of the text (particularly the latter third) explores current issues which Indigenous peoples face today. Two of these major concerns lie within the health and justice systems, so it is important to understand why Kinsella and Papertalk Green focus so heavily on these matters.\n\nThe Close the Gap Campaign (launched in 2007) aims to reduce the inequality in health and education that many Indigenous peoples face. It was created because the life expectancy is much lower for Indigenous than non-Indigenous peoples, and there is a significant difference between their expected levels of education. Unfortunately, many of these concerns have not been addressed today, and Papertalk Green discusses how her family is constantly dealing with death - a key theme in False Claims of Colonial Thieves that can be explained by this contextual understanding.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/reports/closing-the-gap-2018/executive-summary.htmlÂ\n\nSimilarly, there are a lot of concerns with the number of Aboriginal people in prison, and how many of them die while in police custody. There was even a Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (i.e. a governmental inquiry) handed down in 1987, however, many of its recommendations have not been implemented to this day. This idea of unfair policing and laws that target Indigenous peoples is a key idea in the text, and Kinsella dedicates a poem to Ms Dhu, an Indigenous woman killed while in custody.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/09/the-facts-about-australias-rising-toll-of-indigenous-deaths-in-custodyÂ\n\nMining\n\nA key theme of False Claims of Colonial Thieves is mining, which refers to the practice of removing valuable materials from the Earth. Many of these resources are found on traditional Aboriginal lands, which are destroyed by the mining process. This is especially offensive to many Indigenous groups because many Indigenous cultures have a strong spiritual connection to their land (often known as Country). There is consequently a lot of tension between the Indigenous populations and governments, especially in Western Australia, where both of the authors live.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Former_Committees/uranium/report/d07Â\n\nHow Can You Use This in Your Essays?\n\nUnderstanding a textâs context is very important in being able to analyse the text in appropriate depth.\n\nFor example, knowing that mining is often considered harmful to the lands to which Indigenous peoples have a strong connection, will allow you to discuss this concept in your essays. Indeed, Papertalk Green argues that mining is just as harmful to Indigenous peoples as earlier âfalse claimsâ were, which is a sophisticated idea for you to use in your assessments.\n\nAs you begin to better understand and incorporate context into your essays, you can then take things one step further by examining how the author has used context as a means of demonstrating their authorial intent. For example, the effects of the Stolen Generation have been explored in several poems, and a possible viewpoint is that the Stolen Generation was used to demonstrate the devastating loss of Indigenous cultures and traditions.\n\nThe Erratics is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâSetting is a literary element that refers to the context of where a story takes place, usually alluding to the time and location. Your expectations of a story that takes place in Victorian England would differ greatly from a story set in late 2000s Australia, showing us that the historical, social and geographical aspects of the setting shape the meaning of the text.\n\nIn the memoir The Erratics, the setting plays a vital role in Vicki Laveau-Harvie's storytelling. From the beginning of the novel, Laveau-Harvie uses both the title and prologue to foreground the importance of the Okotoks Erratic (a geographical phenomenon in Alberta, Canada) to establish the role that place and belonging have played in her life. Further reinforcing the importance of the setting, the memoirâs narrative follows Laveau-Harvieâs experience flying back to Alberta, Canada (her hometown), after having moved to and started a new life in Australia.Â\n\nWhy Focus on Setting When Writing a Text Response?\n\nThe setting can be useful evidence to have in your repertoire as it helps you show that you not only have an understanding of the ideas of the text but also how those ideas are constructed. When looking at the criteria you will be marked against in the end-of-year exam you will see that to score a 7 and above in Section A you need to consider the âconstructionâ of the text (read more here). Construction refers to your ability to discuss the parts that make up a text through the use of metalanguage as evidence to support your views. The setting is just one of the ways you can address construction in The Erratics, but, as a text so focused on physical environments, itâs a good type of metalanguage to start with.\n\nCanada\n\nFamous for producing Justin Bieber and maple syrup, Canada has a similar history to Australia. Canada has an Indigenous population who inhabited the land for thousands of years before British and French expeditions came and colonised the land. In the 1700s, due to various conflicts, France ceded most of its North American colonies while the United Kingdom stayed. Over time the country gained greater autonomy and, like Australia, it is now a constitutional monarchy with a prime minister but recognises the British royal family as its sovereign. Further mirroring Australia, Canada also has a colonial past that it is still reckoning with as recent headlines about the human remains of hundreds of Indigenous people at a residential school reminds us.Â\n\nVicki is specifically from Alberta, and the majority of the novel is about her experiences returning there after having moved to Australia (at the start of the memoir she had been estranged from her parents for 18 years). Known for its natural beauty and its nature reserves, Alberta is a part of Western Canada. Alberta is one of only two landlocked provinces in Canada which is interesting considering that Vicki leaves it for a country famous for its beaches and coastal cities.Â\n\nWhen annotating the text, highlight the descriptions of the setting. Youâll notice that whenÂ Laveau-Harvie describes Alberta or Canada as a whole she presents the country as being dangerous and hostile. An example of this is the blunt statement that the âcold will kill you. Nothing personalâ. However, Laveau-Harvie does find some solace in the landscape, observing the beauty of the âopalescentâ peaks and the comfort in predictable seasons.Â\n\nVickiâs Parentâs Home\n\nThe first description Laveau-Harvie gives us of her family home is to call it âParadise, [with] twenty acres with a ranch house on a rise, nothing between you and the sky and the distant mountains.â The idyllic image foregrounds the natural landscape but is then immediately juxtaposed with the description of the home as a âtime-capsule house sealed against the outside world for a decadeâ. This description heightens Vickiâs mother and fatherâs isolation from the outside world and alludes to the hostility of the home that is reaffirmed with the doors that âopen to no oneâ. The family home becomes an extended metaphor for Vickiâs parents themselves, with the description of it as a âno-go zoneâ, hinting at the sistersâ estrangement from their parents who have shut them out.Â\n\nMoreover, the land the house sits on does not produce any crops despite it being such a large expanse of land, heightening the homeâs disconnect from the natural world. This detachment from the natural world is furthered by her labelling her parents as âtransplants from the cityâ and contrasting them to locals who âstill make preserves in the summerâ. Vickiâs mother in particular is at odds with nature due to materialism, such as her wardrobes being full of fur coats.\n\nThe Erratics + Napi\n\nIn the prologue we are introduced to the Okotoks Erratic as being situated in âa landscape of uncommon beautyâ with the Erratic itself being something that âdominates the landscape, roped off and isolated, the danger it presents to anyone trespassing palpableâ. The memoir then immediately shifts to Vickiâs experience in the hospital trying to convince the staff that she is her motherâs daughter, drawing a parallel between the dominating and dangerous landscape to the dominating and dangerous mother. In the memoir, the Erratic is an extended metaphor for the mother with both the land and the mother being described as âunsafeâ, âdominat[ing]â and a âdangerâ. Moreover, the structural choice of opening the novel with the Erratic makes its presence felt throughout the novel even though it is not mentioned again until the end of the text.Â\n\nIn contrast to the prologue, the epilogue has a feeling of peace and reconciliation as the mother and what she has represented to her family is reconciled with the landscape. This is particularly pertinent as the geographical and spiritual origins of the rock revealed in the epilogue is a story of stability after a rupture. This alludes to the ability of Vickiâs family to heal after the trauma inflicted on them by the mother. The epilogue could also be understood as a reminder of humanity's insignificance in the face of nature and larger forces, as represented by Napi.\n\nWhile Laveau-Harvie does not directly address Canada's colonial past in her memoir outside of the inclusion of Napi, the colonial presence is felt throughout the memoir through the setting of both Australia and Canada. These settings allude to how living on stolen land means that while individuals - particularly middle-class, white individuals - may not always recognise and address the colonial history of the land they live on, the fact that land was never ceded is still felt.Â\n\nAustralia\n\nAs discussed before, Canada and Australia are similar as they are both former British colonies that are now constitutional monarchies, so why would Vicki want to move to a place that is similar to where she already lived and experienced trauma?Â\n\nThere are a few potential answers, the first being the geographical distance. There are over 1300kms between Sydney and Alberta and, considering the trauma Vicki and her sister have experienced, it stands to reason that she would want to put distance between her childhood home and her adult life. This leads to the second reason, travelling to âFar flung placesâ as a method to deal with trauma. While in Canada, Vicki reminisces about the âboozed-up Brits on Bondiâ that embodies her life in Australia. The evocative, alliterative image creates a stark contrast between warm and carefree Australia and cold and emotionally taxing Canada, reinforcing how travelling provides individuals with a means to survive their traumatic childhoods and create new lives for themselves.Â\n\nWhen writing about setting you do not need to be an expert in geography. As this blog post has shown, to understand Laveau-Harvieâs use of setting in The Erratics you only need to know about two countries, so next time you write a text response, consider using your understanding of setting to show your teacher or examiners that youâve thought about the textâs construction.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into this text, Zac breaks down key themes and quotes in The Erratics over on this blog.\n\nWeâve explored themes, literary devices and characters and development amongst other things over on our After Darkness by Christine Piper blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down an After Darkness essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nLetâs get into it!\n\nThe Prompt:Â\n\nâWhile Ibaraki clearly suffers the consequences of his actions, it is those closest to him who pay the highest price. Discuss.â\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThis is a theme-based prompt, and the keywords are: suffer, consequence, actions and highest price. You want to explore both the evidence that supports the statement and also any evidence that may offer a contradiction to the statement.\n\nFrom here you can find the definition of the keywords to help develop some questions to explore.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nTo suffer is to be affected by or subject to something unpleasant.Â\n\nIs Ibaraki the only one who suffers? Who else suffers?\n\nKayoko, Johnny, Stan, Sister Bernice.\n\nHow do characters deal with their suffering differently?\n\nKayoko and Sister Bernice abandon their relationships with Ibaraki, Johnny becomes agitated and spiteful, Stan becomes depressed.Â\n\nA consequence is a result of an action.Â\n\nAre the consequences negative or positive?\n\nJohnny being outspoken in the internment camp angers the traditionalist Japanese, but creates a sense of kinship amongst the half-blood Japanese.Â\n\nCan characters overcome these consequences or learn from them?\n\nIbaraki eventually learns from his mistakes and grows as a result.Â\n\nAn action is the process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim.Â\n\nIs it Ibarakiâs actions, or lack thereof that lead to consequences?\n\nIt is often his silence and obedience that cause trouble. For example, not telling Kayoko about his work leads to the failure of their marriage.Â\n\nIs it only Ibaraki who makes mistakes?\n\nSister Bernice ignores her religion to confess her love for Ibaraki.Â\n\nWhat are the factors that cause the characters to act in the way that they do?\n\nIbarakiâs guilt and fear of authority and judgement prevent him from speaking up on multiple occasions.Â\n\nHighest price refers to Ibarakiâs suffering being above all else.Â\n\nIs this true?\n\nIbaraki loses his dignity, his friends, his wife, his unborn child, his family, his job and his freedom. However, he does partially regain these.Â\n\nWho suffers the most?\n\nKayoko has a miscarriage and her marriage to Ibaraki fails. Stan is assaulted by other internees and is eventually killed by a guard. Johnny becomes an outcast in his community and is bullied by other internees.Â\n\nAt this point, you can begin to group your ideas and evidence from the text to support your claims.\n\nThroughout the novel, Piper uses a variety of literary devices including dialogue, simile and foreshadowing to convey her message of every action having a consequence. The most prominent of these is her use of imagery and metaphor which she uses to illustrate Ibarakiâs guilt and the way it impacts his actions. However, the story is not only centred around Ibaraki. Piper also highlights that people will often face consequences no matter what decision they make. She does this through her use of foil characters (characters who are used to highlight a particular trait in another character). For example, Ibarakiâs fear and obedience are emphasised by the courage of Kayoko and Johnny Chang. These characters, alongside Ibaraki, face suffering as a result of their actions.Â\n\nFrom these ideas, the main themes I am going to explore are what factors affect the characterâs actions, and how the consequences of these actions can lead to negative, but also positive change.Â\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nParagraph 1:\n\nWhilst the novel centres around Ibarakiâs actions and their consequences, he is not the only character that makes mistakes and is forced to face the repercussions.\n\nParagraph 2:\n\nIt is not necessarily Ibarakiâs actions, but lack of action that often results in the suffering of those around him. Consider the reasons for his lack of action: his blind devotion to authority, his fear of judgement, his ongoing guilt and regret from previous situations.\n\nIbarakiâs lack of action acts as a perpetuating factor for the suffering of those closest to him, but it is not the only factor.\n\nParagraph 3:\n\nIbaraki may pay the highest price for his actions. The structure of the storyline to include a chapter from Ibarakiâs perspective years later indicates that these consequences have ultimately led to positive change.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nNow it is time to write the essay!\n\nSet during the Pacific War, Christine Piperâs After Darkness explores the difficulties and misfortunes many face during wartime. Depicting the rise and fall of Japanâs war efforts (1), After Darkness highlights that all actions have consequences of varying severity, particularly those of protagonist Dr Ibaraki Tomokazu. Throughout the novel, Ibarakiâs lack of action perpetuates the suffering of those closest to him, however, this is shown to be one of many factors and often initiates positive change within him, allowing his character to develop. Fundamentally, After Darkness highlights that change can only occur if people face the repercussions of their actions. (2)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(1) In the introduction, it is important to introduce the text withcontext. As After Darkness is predominantly set in 1942 during wartime in both Japan and Australia, it is important to include this in the introduction in order to explore the essay topic with a complete understanding.Â\n\n(2) Another key part of the introduction is to briefly introduce the topics you will discuss throughout the essay.\n\nThroughout the novel, Piper emphasises the idea that all actions have consequences, however, this idea is not limited to Ibaraki. Across the three novel strands, protagonist Dr Tomokazu Ibarakiâs suffering as a result of his mistakes is depicted through both his internal and external dialogue. Ibaraki makes many significant mistakes throughout his lifetime, one of these being his failure to perform a dissection of a child when working at Unit 731. Despite ânot [being] [him]selfâ (3) when asked to perform the operation, Ibaraki is promptly fired. His termination of employment is not the only consequence of his failure, as shame continues to take over his confidence. This is illustrated when he was âunable to go onâ during an operation in Broome, despite being in a completely different scenario. Through Ibarakiâs flashback of âBlack dots on a childâs bellyâ, Piper indicates the torment and lasting effects of consequences on an individual (4). Whilst the novel centres around his mistakes, it is revealed that Ibaraki is not the only character who is forced to face the repercussions of their actions. Despite acting as foils for Ibaraki and presenting many different qualities, Australian internees Johnny Chang and Stan Suzuki also struggle immensely to overcome the results of their behaviours. Johnny Changâs outspoken nature is often shown to cause disruption among the camp, for example, labelling the imperialist Japanese as âemperor worshipping pigâs.â In standing for his beliefs, Johnny creates a tense division within groups, leading to the half Australian internees being treated like âoutcastsâ. Conversely, Stanâs introverted behaviour results in his eventual death (5). Piperâs contention that all actions have consequences is arguably enforced strongly through Stanâs death, as it results from the failure of many characters to act. Ibarakiâs inability to open up, Johnnyâs selfishness and Stanâs loss of self are inevitably all factors leading to his eventual demise. This is ultimately reinforced when Johnny states âIt shouldâve been me Docâ, indicating he has finally realised his role in the tragedy.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(3) In order to embed quotes, words, prefixes and suffixes can be added to ensure the sentence flows correctly. However, you must indicate that you have edited the quote by placing your changes in square brackets. Here, the original quote was ânot myselfâ but it has been changed to fit the sentence.Â\n\n(4) Whilst it is important to include quotes, it is even more important that you analyse how the author uses the quote to convey a message. In this case, the example of one of Ibarakiâs many flashbacks is used to bear Piperâs belief that one cannot escape the repercussions of their actions.\n\n(5) Comparison is a powerful way of exploring the authorâs ideas throughout the text. Here, Johnnyâs outspoken nature is contrasted with Stanâs âintroverted behaviourâ, yet both concede repercussions. This supports the idea that all actions have consequences, no matter their nature.\n\nIbarakiâs lack of action acts as a perpetuating factor for the suffering of those closest to him, however, it is not the only factor. After Darkness shows the faults in many of Ibarakiâs actions, suggesting his mistakes lead to the misfortunes of many of those around him but this is only partially true. Stan Suzukiâs death is a pivotal moment in the novel where Ibaraki begins to truly express his emotions and open up about the pain he feels (6). Ibaraki realises that he âcould have done somethingâ when opening up to the investigators of Stanâs death, leading to the conclusion that Ibaraki is to blame. Piper illustrates that suffering results as a combination of factors through the later revelations of Johnnyâs escape attempt and the instability of the âtrigger-happyâ guard who shot Stan. This idea is reinforced through the breakdowns of Ibarakiâs close relationships with Kayoko and Sister Bernice. Whilst Ibarakiâs emotionally distant nature catalysed the loss of these significant relationships, it was not the only factor. Both Kayoko and Sister Bernice are structured with similar characteristics in the novel, one being their confidence and strength in their beliefs. Nevertheless, both women lack this characteristic when it comes to their relationship with Ibaraki (7). Ibaraki admits his separation from Kayoko is his âgreatest regretâ, and whilst the first-person perspective does not give an insight into Kayokoâs side, she is shown to lack her usual self-assuredness. Similarly, Ibarakiâs allowance of âsilence [to] stretch betweenâ¦â him and Sister Bernice is hurtful and a failure on his behalf, yet she still willingly confesses her feelings, aware of the risks involved. This is evident when âher eyes dart away from [his]â, implying she is ashamed of her statement as it contradicts her religion and the terms of their work relationship and friendship. This results in an abrupt end to their friendship as the embarrassment of the repercussions of her actions overwhelm Sister Bernice. Whilst the series of mistakes that Ibaraki makes throughout the novel show that his actions cause grief for both him and the people around him, they also highlight that the misfortune of others is not always the fault of one individual.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(6) Referring to specific events in the text is extremely useful to support your ideas and claims. However, it is important that you avoid over-explaining the event, as this will lead to you retelling, rather than analysing the text. See How To Avoid Retelling the Story for more tips.Â\n\n(7) An often-overlooked literary device is the use of foils. A foil is a character that is used to highlight a particular trait in another character, often a flaw. In this case, Piper uses the similarities between Kayoko and Sister Bernice, and the ultimate failure of their relationships. This highlights Ibarakiâs repetition of his mistakes, which we can attribute to his ongoing guilt.Â\n\nIbaraki ultimately pays the highest price for his actions; although this is shown to result in positive change. Through her descriptions of Australia and Japan, Piper uses the juxtaposition of light and dark imagery to illustrate how suffering can lead to learning and growth. Facing racism in Broome when labelled as a âBloody Japâ¦â, trauma from his experiences in Unit 731 and hardship during his internment at Loveday, Ibaraki is constantly a victim of circumstance. Even so, the pressures and torment of these events force him to seek the support of others. The colourful descriptions of the âpink spur of land crested with greenâ foreshadow the positive change to come for Ibaraki (8). This becomes evident when Ibaraki finally opens up to Stan in the infirmary about his separation from Kayoko. Ibarakiâs development as a character continues as he learns to trust despite the unfair circumstances of being interned. Although memories of trees haunting the riverâs edge âlike lost peopleâ and the bark of red trees appearing âlike blistered skinâ continue to plague Ibarakiâs conscience, they force him to confront his past and in turn begin to heal. Through the retrospective novel, Piper describes Japan as where âdarkness crowded the cornersâ and Ibaraki worked âin the basementâ, indicating his misguided obedience and attachment to silence. This not only illustrates (9) Ibarakiâs trauma, but emphasises his drastic development through his experiences. The importance of the consequences Ibaraki has faced throughout his lifetime are reinforced in the final pages of the novel after he reads Sister Berniceâs letter and has an epiphany. The discovery that he had âclung to the ideal of discretionâ creates a sense of hope for Ibarakiâs future and emphasises his newfound understanding of life through the consequences he has faced. (10)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(8) Ensure you donât just randomly place quotes throughout the essay, but instead, analyse them to give them meaning. An easy way to do this is by including the quote, its connotations and what emotions or ideas they provoke, followed by why the author has used it. In this case, the quote was the âpink spur of land crested with green.â Its connotations were positive such as colour, happiness, and hope. These connotations were used to foreshadow positive change.Â\n\n(9) Using a variety of vocabulary such as âillustratesâ, âexploresâ and âdemonstratesâ shows that you are not only identifying what the author is doing but that you understand how and why they have done it in this way. This is ultimately the goal of a text response essay.Â\n\n(10) It is important to ensure the flow of your essay to show sophistication in your writing. It is not only the ideas you have, but the way in which you convey and explain them that ultimately indicates your understanding of the text. A simple way to do this is to use a summary sentence at the end of each topic that subscribes to the idea and links to the previous or following paragraph.Â\n\nEssentially After Darkness highlights the necessity of facing consequences for our actions to promote learning and growth. Whilst Ibaraki and many other characters suffered as a result of their behaviour, Piper asserts that Ibaraki is not the overall perpetrator but ultimately pays the highest price of all. (11)\n\nAnnotations\n\n(11) Just like the introduction, the conclusion is a brief summary of the discussion topics throughout your text response. Most importantly, after exploring all of the evidence you must form a stance in relation to the essay topic. Many students believe that this needs to be a simple and definite yes or no, which is not the case. Instead, I have suggested that Ibaraki is not the only one to blame for other characterâs suffering, but that ultimately, he paid the highest price.

What Are Quotes?\n\nQuotations, better known by their abbreviation âquotesâ, are a form of evidence used in VCE essays. Using quotations in essays helps to demonstrate your knowledge of the text, and provides solid evidence for your arguments. The discussion on quotations in this study guide can be applied to all three areas of study in the VCAA English course which have been explained in detail in our Ultimate Guides to VCE Text Response, Comparative andÂ Language Analysis.\n\nA quotation is the repetition of a group of words taken from a text by someone other than the original author. The punctuation mark used to indicate a repetition of another authorâs work is presented through quotation marks. These quotation marks are illustrated by inverted commas, either single inverted commas (â â) or double inverted commas (â â). There is no general rule in Australia regarding which type of inverted comma you must use for quotations. Single inverted commas are preferred in Australia as they follow the British standard. The American standard involves styling quotations with the double inverted comma. You can choose either style, just be consistent in your essays.\n\n2. Why Use Quotes?\n\nThe usage of quotations in essays demonstrates:\n\nYour knowledge of the text\n\nCredibility of your argument\n\nAn interesting and thoughtful essay\n\nThe strength of your writing skills.\n\nHowever, quotations must be used correctly, otherwise you risk (and these frequent mistakes will be discussed in detail later):\n\nIrrelevant quotations\n\nOvercrowding or overloading of quotations\n\nPlagiarism\n\nBroken sentences\n\nHow You Integrate a Quote into an Essay Depends on Three Factors:\n\nWhat you want to quote\n\nHow much you want to quote\n\nHow that quote will fit into your essay.\n\n3. What You Want To Quote\n\nAs you discuss ideas in a paragraph, quotes should be added to develop these ideas further. A quote should add insight into your argument; therefore, it is imperative that the quote you choose relates intrinsically to your discussion. This is dependent on which aspect of the text you are discussing, for example:\n\nDescription of theme or character\n\nDescription of event or setting\n\nDescription of a symbol or other literary technique\n\nNever quote just for the sake of quoting. Quotations canÂ be irrelevantÂ if a student merely adds in quotes as âsentence fillersâ. Throwing in quotations just to make your essay appear more sophisticated will only be more damaging if the quotation does not adequately reinforce or expand on your contention. Conversely, an essay with no quotations will not achieve many marks either.\n\n4. How Much You Want To Quote\n\nA quotation should never tell the story for you. Quotations are a âsupportâ system, much like a back up for your ideas and arguments. Thus, you must be selective in how much you want to quote. Generally speaking, the absolute minimum is three quotes per paragraph but you should notÂ overloadÂ your paragraphs either. OvercrowdingÂ your essay with too many quotations will lead to failure to develop your ideas, as well as your work appearing too convoluted for your assessor. Remember that the essay isÂ yourÂ piece of work and should consist mainly of your own ideas and thoughts.\n\nSingle Word Quotations\n\nThe word âevaporatesâ, used to characterise money and happiness intends to instill the idea that happiness as a result of money is only temporary. (VCAA âCan Money Buy Happinessâ Language Analysis)\n\nSingle worded quotations can often leave the largest impression on the assessor. This is because you are able to demonstrate that you can focus on one word and develop an entire idea around it.\n\nPhrase Quotations\n\nSunil Badami âstill found it hard to tie my Indian appearance to my Australian feeling', showing that for Sunil, his culture was not Indian, but Australian due to his upbringing. (Sticks and Stones and Such-like, Sunil Badami in Growing Up Asian in Australia)\n\nA phrase quotation is the most common quotation length you will use in essays.\n\nLong Quotations\n\nThe multitudes of deaths surrounding Anna began to take its toll on her, burdening her with guilt as âsometimes, if I walked the main street of the village in the evening, I felt the press of their ghosts. I realised then that I had begun to step small and carry myself all hunched, keeping my arms at my sides and my elbows tucked, as if to leave room for them.â (Year of Wonders, Geraldine Brooks)\n\nLong quotations comprise of more than one sentenceÂ âÂ avoid using them as evidence. Your assessor will not mark you highly if the bulk of your paragraphs consists of long quotations. You should aim to keep your quotations to less than 2 lines on an A4 writing page. If you have a long quotation you wish to use, be selective. Choose only the important phrases or key words, and remove the remaining sentence by replacing it with an ellipsis (â¦).\n\nHere is the same example again, with the student using ellipsis:\n\nThe multitudes of deaths surrounding Anna began to take its toll on her, burdening her with guilt as she felt âthe press of their ghostsâ¦[and] begun to step small and carry myself all hunchedâ¦as if to leave room for them.â (Year of Wonders, Geraldine Brooks)\n\nIn this case, we have deleted: âsometimes, if I walked the main street of the village in the eveningâÂ andÂ âI realised then that I hadâÂ by using an ellipsis â a part of the quotation that is not missed because it does not represent the essence of the studentâs argument. You would have noticed that a square bracket ([ Â ]) was used. This will be discussed in detail underÂ Blending Quotes.\n\n5. How That Quote Will Fit into Your Essay\n\nPlagiarism\n\nYou must never take the original authorâs words and use them in your essayÂ withoutÂ inserting them in quotation marks. Failure to do so leads to âplagiarismâ or cheating. Plagiarism occurs when you take someone elseâs work and pass it off as your own. You must make sure that you use quotation marks whenever you use evidence from your text.\n\nThe following is plagiarism:\n\nEven a single flicker of the eyes could be mistaken for the essential crime that contained all other crimes in itself â thought crime.Â (1984, George Orwell)\n\nUsing quotation marks however, avoids plagiarism:\n\nEven âa single flicker of the eyesâ could be mistaken for âthe essential crime that contained all other crimes in itself â thought crime.âÂ (1984, George Orwell)\n\nThere are serious consequences for plagiarism. VCAA will penalise students for plagiarism. VCAA uses statistical analysis to compare a studentâs work with their General Achievement Test (GAT), and if the cross-referencing indicates that the student is achieving unexpectedly high results with their schoolwork, the studentâs school will be notified and consequential actions will be taken.\n\nPlagiarism should not be confused with:\n\nâParaphrasing: to reword or rephrase the authorâs words\n\nâSummarising: to give a brief statement about the authorâs main points\n\nâQuoting: to directly copy the authorâs words with an indication (via quotation marks) that it is not your original work\n\nBlending Quotations\n\nYou should always aim to interweave quotations into your sentences in order to achieve good flow and enhanced readability of your essay. Below is a good example of blending in quotations:\n\nJohn Proctor deals with his own inner conflict as he is burdened with guilt and shame of his past adulterous actions. Yet during the climatic ending of the play, Proctor honours his principles as he rejects signing a false confession. This situation where Proctor is confronted to âsign [himself] to liesâ is a stark epiphany, for he finally acknowledges that he does have âsome shred of goodness.â (The Crucible, Arthur Miller)\n\nThere are three main methods in how you canÂ blend quotations into an essay:\n\n1. Adding Words\n\nBroken sentencesÂ are a common mistake made when students aim to integrate quotations into their sentences. Below are examples of broken sentences due to poor integration of a quotation:\n\nâSolitary as an oysterâ. Scrooge is illustrated as a person who is isolated in his own sphere. (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nNever write a sentence consisting ofÂ onlyÂ a quotation. This does not add insight into your argument, nor does it achieve good flow or readability.\n\nScrooge, âsolitary as an oysterâ, is illustrated as a person who is isolated in his own sphere.Â (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nThis example is better, however the sentence is still difficult to read. In order to blend quotations into your sentences, try adding in words that will help merge the quotation and your own words together:\n\nDescribed as being as âsolitary as an oysterâ, Scrooge is illustrated as a person who is isolated in his own sphere.Â (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nOR\n\nScrooge is depicted as a person who is âsolitary as an oysterâ, illustrating that he is isolated in his own sphere.Â (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nTip: If you remove the quotation marks, the sentence should still make sense.\n\n2. Square Brackets ([ Â Â ])\n\nThese are used when you need to modify the original writerâs words so that the quotation will blend into your essay. This is usually done to:\n\nChange Tense\n\nAuthors sometimes write in pastÂ (looked), presentÂ (look)Â or future tenseÂ (will look). Depending on how you approach your essay, you may choose to write with one of the three tenses. Since your tense may not always match the authorâs, you will need to alter particular words.\n\nOriginal sentence:Â ââ¦puts his arm around Lewisâ shoulderâ (Cosi, Louis Nowra)\n\nUpon seeing Lewis upset, Roy attempts to cheer him up by âput[ting] his arm around Lewisâ shoulderâ.Â (Cosi, Louis Nowra)\n\nChange Narrative Perspective\n\nThe author may write in a firstÂ (I, we), secondÂ (you)Â or third personÂ (he, she, they)Â narrative. Since you will usually write from an outsiderâs point of view, you will refer to characters in third person. Thus, it is necessary to replace first and second person pronouns with third person pronouns. Alternatively, you can replace first and second person pronouns with the characterâs name.\n\nThe original sentence:Â âOnly now can I recognise the scene for what it was: a confessional, a privilege that I, through selfishness and sensual addiction, failed to acceptâ¦âÂ (Maestro, Peter Goldsworthy)\n\nWhen Keller was finally ready to share his brutal past with Paul, the latter disregarded the maestro, as he was too immersed in his own adolescent interests. However, upon reflection, Paul realises thatÂ âonly now can [he] recognise the scene for what it was: a confessional, a privilege that [he], through selfishness and sensual addiction, failed to acceptâ.Â (Maestro, Peter Goldsworthy)\n\nInsert Missing Words\n\nSometimes, it may be necessary to insert your own words in square brackets so that the quotation will be coherent when incorporated into your sentences.\n\nThe original sentence:Â âHis heels glow.âÂ (Ransom, David Malouf)\n\nAchilles, like Priam, feels a sense of refreshment as highlighted by âhis heels [which] glow.â (Ransom, David Malouf)\n\n3. Grammar\n\nIt is important to maintain proper grammar while weaving in quotations. The question is: does the punctuation go inside or outside the final quotation mark?\n\nThe rule is: If the quoted words end with a full stop (or comma), then the full stop goes inside the quotation marks. If the quoted words do not end with a full stop, then the full stop goes outside the quotation marks.\n\nOriginal sentence: 'Sagittyâs old place plus another hundred acres that went from the head waters of Darkey Creek all the way down to the river.â (The Secret River, Kate Grenville)\n\nPunctuation inside:\n\nDuring the past decade, Thornhill became the wealthiest man in the area, owning âSagittyâs old place plus another hundred acres that went from the head waters of Darkey Creek all the way down to the river.â (The Secret River, Kate Grenville)\n\nPunctuation outside:\n\nDuring the past decade, Thornhill became the wealthiest man in the area, owning âSagittyâs old place plus another hundred acresâ. (The Secret River, Kate Grenville)\n\n6. There Are Also Other Ways of Using Quotation Marks\n\nTitle of Text\n\nWhen including the title of the text in an essay, use single quotation marks.\n\nDirected by Elia Kazan, âOn The Waterfrontâ unveils the widespread corruption among longshoremen working at New Jersey docks.Â (On The Waterfront, Elia Kazan)\n\nAlternatively, you can underline the title of the text instead of using single quotation marks. Many teachers and examiners prefer this option.\n\nQuotation Within a Quotation\n\nWhen you quote the author who is quoting someone else, then you will need to switch between single and double quotation marks. You firstly need to enclose the authorâs words in single quotation marks, and then enclose the words they quote in double quotation marks. If you're following the American standard, you'll need to do this the opposite way - that is, using double quotation marks for the author's words and and then single quotation marks for the quote. We recommend sticking to the preferred Australian style though, which is single and then double.\n\nOriginal sentence:Â ââ¦something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow. âItâs just thatÂ â I â um, I hate itâ¦Itâs too â itâs too Indian!ââ (Sticks and Stones and Such-like, Sunil Badami in Growing Up Asian in Australia)\n\nSunilâs unusual name leads him to believe that it is ââ¦something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow. âItâs just thatÂ â I â um, I hate itâ¦Itâs too â itâs too Indian!ââ (Sticks and Stones and Such-like, Sunil Badami in Growing Up Asian in Australia)\n\nAs you can see, the student has quoted the authorâs words in single quotation marks. The dialogue used by the author is surrounded by double quotation marks. This demonstrates that the dialogue used in the text still belongs to the author.\n\nUsing Quotations to Express Irony\n\nWhen you wish to express irony, you use quotation marks to illustrate that the implied meaning of the actual word or phrase is different to the normal meaning.\n\nAs a young girl, Elaine is a victim of Mrs Smeath and her so called âfriendsâ. Her fatherâs interest in insects and her motherâs lack of housework presents Elaine as an easy bullying target for other girls her age who are fit to fulfill Torontoâs social norms. (Catâs Eye,Â Margaret Atwood)\n\nIn this case, âfriendsâ is written in inverted commas to indicate that Elaineâs peers are not truly her friends but are in fact, bullies.\n\n7. Questions You Must Ask Yourself When Weaving Quotes into Sentences\n\n1. Â Does the quote blend into my sentence?\n\n2. Â Does my sentence still make sense?\n\n3. Â Is it too convoluted for my readers to understand?\n\n4. Â Did I use the correct grammar?\n\n8. How To Find Good Quotes\n\nTip One: Do not go onto Google and type in 'Good quotes for X text', because this is not going to work. These type of quotes are generally the most famous and the most popular quotes because, yes they are good quotes, but does that necessarily mean that it's going to be a good quote in your essay? Probably not. But why? Well, it's because these quotes are the most likely to be overused by students - absolutely every single person who has studied this text before you, and probably every single person who will study this text after you. You want to be unique and original. So, how are you going to find those 'good quotes'? Recognise which quotes are constantly being used and blacklist them. Quotes are constantly used in study guides are generally the ones that will be overused by students. Once you eliminate these quotes, you can then go on to find potentially more subtle quotes that are just as good as the more popular or famous ones.\n\nTip Two: Re-read the book. There is nothing wrong with you going ahead and finding your own quotes. You don't need to find quotes that already exist online or in study guides. Go and find whatever gels with you and whatever you feel like has a lot of meaning to it. I had a friend back in high school who was studying a book by Charles Dickens. I haven't read the book myself, but there was a character who couldn't pronounce the letter S, or he had a lisp of some sort. What my friend did was he found this one word where, throughout the entire book, the guy with the lisp only ever said the S one time and that was a massive thing. So, he used that. This is something that is really unique and original. So, go ahead and try to find your own quotes.\n\nTip Three: Realise that good quotes do not necessarily have to come from the main character. Yes, the main character does often have good quotes associated with whatever they're saying, but just know that you do have minor characters who can say something really relevant and have a really good point too. Their quote is going to be just as strong in your essay as a main character's quote, which will probably be overused and overdone by so many other students.\n\nTip Four: Develop a new interpretation of a famous or popular quote. Most of the time, the really popular quotes are analysed in very much the same way. But if you can offer a new insight into why it's being said or offer a different interpretation, then this is automatically going to create a really good quote that's going to offer a refreshing point of view.\n\nFor example, if we look at The Great Gatsby, one of the most famous quotes that is constantly being used is, 'He found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.' What most people will do is they will analyse the part about the 'grotesque thing a rose', because that's the most significant part of the quote that stands out. But what you could do instead, is focus on a section of that quote, for example the 'raw'. Why is the word raw being used? How does the word raw contribute extra meaning to this particular quote? This way you're honing in on a particular section of the quote and really trying to offer something new. This automatically allows you to investigate the quote in a new light.\n\nTip Five: Just remember that the best quotes do not have to be one sentence long. Some of the best quotes tend to be really short phrases or even just one particular word. Teachers actually love it when you can get rid of the excess words that are unnecessary in the sentence, and just hone in on a particular phrase or a particular word to offer an analysis. And also, that way, when you spend so much time analysing and offering insight into such a short phrase or one sentence, it shows how knowledgeable you are about the text and that you don't need to rely on lots and lots of evidence in order to prove your point.\n\nThose are my five quick tips on how to find good quotes from your texts!\n\nNeed more help with quotes?

Summary\n\nAlice Munro is a Canadian Nobel-Prize-winning author of short stories, and Runaway, first published in 2004, is a collection of eight such stories (though kind of actually only six, because three of them are sequential). These stories examine the lives of Canadian women throughout the last century, but not all of them are necessarily realistic to what daily life actually looks like. Rather, Munro uses borderline-supernatural events (which some critics say feel staged or contrived) to shed light on the tensions and challenges of gender in modern life.\n\nThis can mean that some of the stories are quite hard to follow; they go through all these twists and turns, and the lines between stories start blurring after a while. Letâs go through each in a bit more detail before jumping into our analysis.\n\n2. Story-by-Story Characters and Summary\n\nRunaway\n\nThe titular story is about a woman Carla, her husband Clark, their goat Flora, and their elderly neighbour Sylvia Jamieson. There are many runaways in the story: Carla ran away from her middle-class home to marry Clark, Flora the goat literally runs away, a scandalous lie about Sylviaâs late husband gets a bit out of hand, and now Sylvia is helping Carla run away once again, this time from Clark. Few of these runaways are really very successful: this story is really interrogating why and how.\n\nChance/Soon/Silence\n\nThe next three stories are sequential, and revolve around Juliet, a well-educated classicist who is working as a teacher in the first story, âChanceâ - it is set in 1965 and she is 21. In this story, she meets her lover Eric Porteous on a train, then finds him again six months later. Eric is sleeping around with a few women in light of his wifeâs declining health and eventual passing, but by âSoonâ he and Juliet have settled down and had a baby together - Penelope.\n\nâSoonâ focuses more on the relationship between Juliet and her parents, in particular her mother Sara. Juliet feels a bit out of place now at home, and feels guilty about not being more present for Sara. In turn, âSilenceâ depicts her own daughter running away from her. Juliet returns to her studies and only hears about Penelopeâs life through a chance encounter with a friend who reveals that Penelope is now a mother herself.\n\nPassion\n\nThe next story is about Grace, an older woman revising the family home of her husband Maury Travers. Their marriage never had a lot of passion in it really - Grace was always more interested in Mauryâs family - but both of them were just doing what was expected of them. The contrast comes from Mauryâs brother Neil, a doctor who accompanies Grace on a hospital trip when she cuts her foot. This trip becomes longer and more sensual, feeling adulterous even though very little actually transpires between them - the story raises questions around what counts as cheating, and what marriages should entail.Â\n\nTrespasses\n\nâTrespassesâ is slightly deliberately disorienting from the start (which is actually the end of the story). We go on a flashback in the middle to learn about a father, Harry, and his daughter Lauren. One day when moving house, Lauren finds a cardboard box - Harry explains that it contains the ashes of a dead baby who he and his wife Eileen (Laurenâs mother) had had before Lauren. This leads to Lauren questioning if she was adopted, which is further complicated by Delphine, a worker at a hotel who seems to think Lauren is her biological daughter. The ending (which was teased at the beginning) is the evening of confrontation between the four characters where the truth is finally revealed.Â\n\nTricks\n\nConversely, âTricksâ has a more linear plot to follow. Robin is a carer for her asthmatic sister Joanne, but sheâs taken to watching Shakespeare plays in the next town once a year. One year, she meets a European clockmaker Danilo who plans to meet her next year when she is back in town - but this doesnât go to plan at all. Itâs only 40 years later that Robin finds out Danilo had a twin brother, which is why the plan had gone downhill.\n\nPowers\n\nThe last story in the collection is arguably the most complex, and itâs broken into 5 parts to reflect that complexity. It follows Nancy as she ages from a fresh high school graduate to an old woman by the end of the sequence, including her marriage to the town doctor Wilf. Importantly, the stories also cover her friendship with Tessa, who has the supernatural powers mentioned in the title. However, by the third story, Tessa has been abandoned in a mental hospital and she has lost her powers. Throughout the stories, we also see Ollie, Wilfâs cousin (or a figment of Nancyâs imagination according to this analysis), who seems to be responsible for Tessaâs demise.\n\n3. Themes\n\nLetâs start tracing some of the common themes between the stories.\n\nMarriage\n\nA key theme explored throughout many of the stories is marriage and domesticity. Thereâs a strong sense that itâs an underwhelming experience: it doesnât live up to expectations and it particularly dampens the lives of the women involved. Nancyâs marriage to Wilf in âPowersâ only happens because she feels guilty - 'I could hardly [turn him down] without landing us both inâ¦embarrassment' - but, as a result, she loses her fun, intellectual streak as he tells her to put down her book, 'give Dante a rest'. A similar fate befalls Juliet, who gives up her study in the process of becoming married.\n\nÂ Marriage is also sometimes explored as a deliberate choice, even if it might have unintended consequences - for example, Carlaâs marriage to Clark is described as a life that she 'chose'. This interpretation is more unclear though, and is contradicted in other stories like Passion, where Graceâs marriage is described as 'acquiescence ', acceptance without protest. Itâs even contradicted to some extent in the same story: Munro compares Carlaâs marriage to a 'captive' situation, where she mightâve chosen to enter the marriage, but after that has little say in how it goes.\n\nRunaways\n\nThis sounds a bit trite, but the title is a key theme as well - just not necessarily in the physical sense. Consider all of these different definitions and how they pop up in the stories. In âRunawayâ, Carla and the goat run away, but also the lie Carla tells Clark about Leon, a runaway lie that taints his relationship with Sylvia completely. Some runaways are described as accidents - 'she â Flora â slipped through' - while others are much more deliberate. The question here is how much control we actually have over our own lives. Not a lot, it would seem.\n\nThe other side of runaway/s is to think about who the victim in each runaway is. Does somebody run away because they are 'in a bad situation, the way it happens', a victim of circumstance, or do they run away because they feel guilty, or because theyâre abandoning someone else, the true victim of being left behind? Carla does seem like more of a victim of circumstance with good reason to run away, but think about Nancy leaving Tessa behind in âPowersâ: ââIâll write to youâ, she saidâ¦she never did.â\n\nThis question about who the real victim is might be the hardest to answer for âSilenceâ. Julietâs daughter abandons her, but itâs not like thereâs a strong history of positive mother-daughter relationships in their family: Juliet wasnât able to give Sara what she needed ( 'she had not protected Sara') and in turn isnât able to quite give Penelope what she needs either (Penelope having a 'hunger for the things that were not available to her in her home '). At the same time, Penelopeâs abandonment does feel quite callous and inexplicable, even if Juliet feels like itâs what she deserves; Munro suggests at the end of the story that a reunion would be an 'undeserved blessing[]'. The intertextuality with Aethiopica reveals Julietâs good intentions, her similarity to the 'great-hearted queen of Ethiopia', but it doesnât quite give us the satisfaction of a neat resolution either.\n\nEthics and Morality\n\nFinally, Munroâs stories also raise questions around morality. Besides what weâve already covered - adultery, runaways - there are further questions raised around parenthood, particularly in âTrespassesâ. Harry seems to share a bit too much information with his child, who really doesnât need to know about the dead baby just yet. Lauren is 'not short of information', and itâs worth questioning where that boundary should be for a child of her age.\n\nBut not all ethical questions have simple answers: as in âTricksâ they can sometimes just have 'outrageous', cruel punchlines that donât reveal themselves for decades. Munro doesnât necessarily have all the answers on this one. She brings up complex moral situations but does not pass judgment on any.\n\n4. Symbols & Analysis\n\nGreek Elements\n\nThroughout the stories, Munro brings in a few elements of Greek mythology or literature. The intertextuality in âSilenceâ is one example, drawing on the classical text Aethiopica, but there are a few more scattered throughout the stories: the constellations of Orion and Cassiopeia in âChanceâ and an oracle-like figure in Tessa, a main character in âPowersâ. All of these elements have some significance:\n\nCassiopeia is known for her arrogance and vanity, which parallels with the way Juliet detaches herself from her life ('she had made herself into a rather superior, invulnerable observer' - despite her very real vulnerabilities)\n\nOrion is known for his forbidden romance with the virgin goddess Artemis, which parallels with Ericâs romance with Juliet (Juliet being relatively inexperienced with men herself, with all of her experiences being 'fantasy')\n\nOracles in mythology are like mouthpieces of the gods who can prophesy about the future. They were often women, so oracles were unusually influential in their male-dominated societies. The question is whether this parallels with Tessa at all: even though she has these supernatural powers, are there other forms of power she might lack instead?\n\nIn general, intertextuality is a way to enrich a text by drawing parallels and linking characters to existing stories or archetypes. Here, Munro uses classical texts to add dimension to her characters in a way that is almost-but-not-quite commentary. Pre-existing Greek myths are a way for us to see whatâs really going on.\n\n(Rail)Roads and Transit\n\nThe other symbol that comes up a few times in the stories is roads or railroads - basically places where runaways might happen. âChanceâ is set in the middle of a train journey, âTricksâ involves a couple of train journeys, âRunawayâ maps the roads leading in and out of Carlaâs home, and almost all of âPassionâ takes place on the road. If we broaden âplaces where runaways might happenâ to include planes as well, then we can add âPowersâ and âSilenceâ to the list.\n\nAll of these spaces are what might be called liminal - theyâre âin-betweenâ spaces with an air of suspense about what can happen. Itâs probably most prominent in âPassionâ, where Grace describes the events of that road trip as a 'passageâ in her life, both physically and metaphorically. In general though, theyâre the settings where the wildest and most significant events tend to happen.\n\n5. Quotes\n\nRunaway\n\n'SheâFloraâslipped through.'\n\n'She (referring to Carla) chose this life with Clark.'\n\n'She is just in a bad situation, the way it happens.'\n\n'She saw him as the architect of the life ahead of them, herself as the captive, her submission both proper and exquisite.'\n\n'She might be free.' - this is the second last line in the story. Note the ambiguity here (and through all these quotes, to be honest) about which âsheâ is being referred to (Carla, Flora or even Sylvia)\n\nChance/Soon/Silence\n\n'Juliet was twenty-one years old and already the possessor of a B.A. and an M.A. in classics.'\n\n'The problem was that she was a girl. If she got marriedâwhich might happenâ¦âshe would waste all her hard work.'\n\n'She had made herself into a rather superior, invulnerable observer.'\n\n'â¦the two of them (referring to Sara and Juliet) intertwined. And then abruptly, Juliet hadnât wanted any more of it.'\n\n'But she had not protected Sara. When Sara had said, soon Iâll see Juliet, Juliet had found no reply. Could it not have been managed?â¦She had put everything away.'\n\nPenelope supposedly had a 'hunger for the things that were not available to her in her home.'\n\n'Penelope does not have a use for me.'\n\n'She hopes as people who know better hope for undeserved blessings, spontaneous remissions, things of that sort.'\n\nPassion\n\nGrace, watching a movie with Maury, felt 'rageâ¦because that was what girls were supposed to be like. Thatâs what men - people, everybody - thought they should be like. Beautiful, treasured, spoiled, selfish, pea-brained. That was what a girl should be, to be fallen in love with.'\n\n'It was not in her nature, of course, to be so openly dumbfounded, so worshipful, as he was.'\n\n'Describing this passage, this change in her life, later on, Grace might say - she did say - that it was as if a gate had clanged shut behind her. But at the time there was no clang - acquiescence simply rippled through her.'\n\nTrespasses\n\nLauren 'had been brought up to believe that children and adults could be on equal terms with each other.'\n\n'How could she be sure that they had not got her as a replacement? If there was one big thing she hadnât known about, why could there not be another?'\n\n'Forgive us our trespasses' - note the ambiguity of âtrespassesâ (does it mean sins as in the prayer, or overstepping boundaries, or both?)\n\nâTricks\n\n'Some of the best-looking, best-turned-out women in town are those who did not marry.'\n\n'A means to an end, those tricks are supposed to be.'\n\nPowers\n\n'I couldnât stand for the poor man (referring to Wilf) to have had two girls turn him downâ\n\n'I used to have a feeling something really unusual would occur in my life, and it would be important to have recorded everything. Was that just a feeling?'\n\n'She could be upset to see you leave without her. So Iâll give you an opportunity just to slip away.'\n\n'He has nearly forgotten that he ever believed in her powers, he is now only anxious for her and for himself, that their counterfeit should work well.'\n\nHaving great quotes is one thing, but you also want to make sure you know How To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss!\n\n6.

This essay topic breakdown will give you a brief glimpse on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nâForgive us our trespasses.â What types of boundaries are created and overstepped in Runaway?\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThis quote is from âTrespassesâ and captures the double meaning of the word as both overstepping physical boundaries and sinning in the moral or religious sense. Itâs likely weâll want to talk about both interpretations - physically trespassing but also encroaching on boundaries in immoral ways. Note that the prompt also includes the action words âcreatedâ and âoversteppedâ, meaning that thereâll be a pretty diverse range of examples that weâll need to use to answer this prompt comprehensively.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nLetâs start with physical boundaries: Carlaâs marriage and the fences on her property and the US-Canada border in âPowersâ come to mind. Then, weâve got non-physical boundaries: emotionally as in âChanceâ and ethically as in âTrespassesâ. This is where we start getting into whether these boundaries are created or overstepped.\n\nClark creates boundaries for Carla and her attempts to break free from them are unsuccessful. The border in âPowersâ is more of an excuse for Nancy to neglect Tessa, a boundary she creates and never makes the effort to overstep. Finally, the ethical boundaries in âTrespassesâ are overstepped from the get-go. How can we synthesise these ideas into one essay?\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nI think the trick with questions like this is not to just allocate different types of boundaries and/or different action words to each paragraph. Try to think of creative ways to string these ideas together that also build towards a bigger picture or overall contention about the text as a whole. This example plan explores physical and emotional boundaries but makes a bigger argument that they are often associated with regret in Munroâs stories.\n\nâParagraph 1: Physical boundaries are both the most intentional and the most difficult to overstep.\n\nCarlaâs farmstead is isolated and bordered by roads; her marriage to Clark and her life on this farmstead is likened to a 'captive' situation, with Clark being the 'architect' of it all\n\nMunro ends Runaway on a pessimistic note about Carlaâs ability to leave this boundary: 'She might be free'\n\nInternational borders also constitute physical barriers, and these are used by Nancy in âPowersâ to avoid responsibility; because this is an active decision (ââIâll write to youâ, she saidâ¦she never did.â), itâs a barrier that never really gets broken. Similar to Penelope in âSilenceâ\n\nParagraph 2: Munroâs stories, however, focus more on emotional boundaries, and the way these are applied varies greatly. This variation underscores their complexity.\n\nEmotional boundaries when created can prevent intimacy: Juliet 'ma[kes] herself into a rather superior, invulnerable observer' so as to avoid commitment. These boundaries come back to bite when she has a daughter\n\nConversely, they cause a great deal of harm when overstepped: for example, âTrespassesâ sees 'crazy and dangerous' adults toy with the life of a child, constantly assuming that she 'can take it' when in fact this is not the case\n\nParagraph 3: Regardless, Munroâs characters often come to regret the boundaries they erect or overstep.\n\nCarlaâs ambivalence about her marriage is tinged with regret either way: when sheâs there, she wants to escape, and when she escapes, she questions if she has 'anything left in [her]'\n\nJuliet reflects on the boundaries she puts up between herself and Penelope and realises that 'spontaneous remissions' between them are undeserved and impossible\n\nIn âPowersâ, Nancy struggles with the guilt of abandoning Tessa: many years later, she still wants to 'open [the past] up' and understand her motives. However, it is too late, and the boundaries are already there\n\nMunro does not suggest that boundaries are inherently good or bad, but her stories show how they can be sources of regret when treated improperly\n\nRunaway is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Creative Response.

These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWithout further ado, letâs get into it!\n\nââIn All the Light We Cannot See there is a fine line between civilised and uncivilised behaviour.â Discuss.\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nTaking a look at this prompt, the first thing to note is that it is theme-based. Specifically asking about the line that separates civilised and uncivilised behaviour within the novel, this prompt focuses directly on the theme of human behaviours and how you ultimately interpret the fine line (i.e. seamless, difficult, changing, manipulative) between such ideas. Fundamentally, you have to discuss how this theoretical line drawn between the contrasting behaviours is explored within the novel in various ways throughout Doerrâs examination of humanity.Â\n\nThe question tag of Discuss is the most flexible type of prompt/topic you will receive, providing you with a broad and open-ended route to pretty much discuss any ideas that you believe fit within the promptâs theme of uncivilised and civilised behaviour. Although this may seem hard to know where to start, this is where Step 2: Brainstorm, comes into play. You can read through LSGâs Question Tags You Need To Know section (in How To Write A Killer Text Response) to further familiarise yourself with various ways to tackle different prompt tags.\n\nIf youâre not sure what it is meant by âtheme-based prompt,â take a look atThe 5 Types of Essay Prompts.Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nA fundamental aspect of writing a solid Text Response essay is being able to use a diverse range of synonyms for the keywords outlined in the prompt. Our keywords are in bold. When you are brainstorming, if any words pop into your head, definitely list them so you can use them later. You may want to have a highlighter handy when unpacking prompts so you can do just this!!\n\nââIn All the Light We Cannot See there is a fine line between civilised and uncivilised behaviour.â Discuss.\n\nHow people have grown up determines the civil and uncivilised behaviours shown by individuals of different backgrounds and childhoods\n\n- Bastian is symbolised as the eagle that circles the youth camp, which is an uncivilised/unwanted form of hawk-like behaviour. This compares to Fredrick's love of birds as a young boy which makes him a softer character.\n\n- Bernd had âno friendsâ as a child - showing his isolated past - which could be described as the reason he leaves his father and goes off to join the Hilter Youth âjust like the other boys.â (find this analysis in the chapter âThe Death of Walter Berndâ)\n\nThere is a fine line that Doerr draws between the stereotypes of women and their ability to remain civilised despite being suppressed by uncivil livelihoods and experiences.\n\n- Jutta is characterised as a strong and independent woman instead of the traditional âpretty girl in a propaganda posterâ. Society expects most women to stand on that side of human behaviour and representation however she defies this.\n\nThe strength of women to cross/overcome the line of uncivilised behaviour is significant within the sexual abuse and misconduct driven by soldiers. Can remain true to oneself despite the horrific behaviours a woman faces.\n\n- The role of women on the homefront (i.e. Fredrickâs Mother) highlights the stark contrast between men fighting and thinking about the âmen they killedâ and mothers who put on a âfake smile to appear braveâ (the line between barbaric behaviours of many soldiers and caring/loving behaviours of those on the homefront) - women and their sacrifices is an important topic here\n\nIt is oneâs ability to adapt to change that draws the line between civil and uncivilised behaviours.\n\n- Marie Laureâs ability to look past being a âblind girlâ, and move on from this hardship. She adapts to the âchanging timesâ around her despite others who are suppressed in such an environment (e.g. Etienne and his âdreadâ).\n\nThe game of flying couch is a symbol of escaping the uncivilised world around them (metaphorical line of the human imagination).\n\n- Werner is predominantly overwhelmed by the world around him, which reflects his inability to no longer ask questions as he did as a young boy. Instead, he succumbs to the uncivilised world of death and destruction as he is unable to change.Â\n\nSymbolic use of Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ in epilogue - symbolises his loss of perspective and wonder of the world,\n\nUltimately it is this line that makes the human existence so unique\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nAfter having brainstormed all the ideas that came to mind, Iâll be approaching the essay prompt with the following contention.Â\n\nIn a world where society is grounded by behaviours both civil and uncivil, there is a clear distinction between humanity's response and representation of these behaviours.\n\nComing up with a clear contention allows you to put together a cohesive and strong essay that answers all aspects of the prompt question.Â\n\nNow, onto developing our topic sentences for each paragraph!\n\nP1: Embedded within Doerrâs nonlinear narrative*, the environment in which individuals have grown up consequently influences their behaviours later in life.\n\n*A nonlinear narrative is a storytelling technique Doerr uses to portray events out of chronological order.Â\n\nP2: Encompassing the social paradigms that pervade a womanâs existence, the strength and civilisation of females allow them to traverse a line of unjust behaviours that suppress them.\n\nP3: In essence, it is the human response to change that divides individuals from ultimately displaying civil or uncivil acts in the world.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nEssay\n\nThe art of recognising the ephemera of the human existence is painted by Anthony Doerrâs All the Light We Cannot See as a fine line between behaviours of civilisation and extreme brutality (1). In the inordinate scheme of history, Doerr fosters the dichotomy between those who remain socially aware and others who are marred by desolation as a reflection on one's past. Further subverting the traditional depiction of women in a âwar storyâ, the strength of women is established as a key turning point for individuals to escape barbaric behaviours and cross the line to civilisation. Fundamentally, however, it is the overall response to change that crafts human behaviours that Doerr underpins within society (2).\n\nAnnotationsâ\n\nâ(1) it is important to include synonym variation in your opening sentence to ensure that it does not look like you have just copied the prompt and placed it on your page. This idea should be carried out throughout your essay - vary your words and try not to repeat anything, this will ensure you are clear and concise!\n\n(2) In order to improve the flow of your writing, the final topic sentence of your introduction can be a concluding statement on why/how the topic is OVERALL expressed within the novel. When you formulate your contention, it is not enough just to state it, you must also provide reasoning as to why you are writing from this point of view or how you came to this conclusion. For example, my final topic sentence here is a concluding sentence about how I believe a fine line between uncivilised and civil behaviour has an influence throughout the entire novel and Doerrâs intention, oneâs response to change. As you read on, youâll also see that this sentence relates to my final paragraph, thus linking together ideas throughout my essay.\n\nEmbedded within Doerrâs nonlinear narrative, the environment in which individuals have grown up consequently influences their behaviours later in life. The initial illustration of the âsmokestacks humeâ and the âblack and dangerousâ imagery (3) of the war paints a clear picture of the destruction and trauma that individuals have lived amongst, thus why people were âdesperate to leaveâ. Empathising with an âold woman who cuddles her toddlerâ on the streets, Doerr laments how young individuals who end up âsurg[ing] towards one cause,â which this toddler may similarly grow up to do in the Hitler Youth, directly reflects the âintense maliceâ of their childhood. This idea that oneâs past affects the future behaviours of a generation is further captured within the chapter âThe Death of Walter Berndâ (4), which outlines how Berndâs upbringing with âno friendsâ promotes him to âjust leaveâ, in order to experience something new, despite knowing this something new would bring unjust decisions into his life. Becoming âjust like the other boysâ, Doerr suggests that the line between civil and uncivil behaviours is so thin (5) that a mere need to escape oneâs past is enough to create feelings of negativity and at worst death. Encapsulating the darkness that prevails over such individuals, the symbolism of Bastianâs âsharp eyesâ (6) poetically describes the eagle that circles the youth camp where Doerr seeks to paint a metaphorical cruel depiction of Bastian as a harmful hawk. Underpinning the fine line between human behaviour, Fredrickâs âlove of birdsâ is âso beautiful[ly]â representative of his respectful nature and approach to life while Bastianâs immersion in âthe self interest of the worldâ ultimately explains how his fallacious behaviour towards others is embodied by his environment within the war. Overall, the behaviours displayed by humanity are a reflection of past experiences and how they shape the individual.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(3) Imagery is a key aspect of All the Light We Cannot See and goes hand in hand with the vast symbolism Doerr uses within his novel. When including imagery, it is great to include a few related quotes; however, you must then ensure you analyse and delve into how this technique (imagery) demonstrates the idea you are writing about. In this case, the imagery of the chimneys and foggy/dirty air illustrates the desolate environment individuals lived in during the war.\n\n(4) This chapter is something not many students analyse or touch on so if youâre looking to add some spice to your writing I would definitely take a look and see what you can extract from some of those more unique and nuanced chapters!\n\n(5) Referencing the âfine lineâ continually throughout your essay ensures that you are staying on track and not talking about topics away from the prompt.Â\n\n(6) Symbolism is very important in All the Light We Cannot See. The use of the quote âsharp eyesâ, really shows that you have considered not only how Doerr simply explores the behaviour of each character but also the physical interpretations of how individuals may demonstrate a certain persona within the novel. This focus on character description on top of dialogue adds extra layers to your writing.Â\n\nEncompassing the social paradigms that pervade a womanâs existence, the strength and civilisation of females allow them to traverse a line of unjust behaviours that suppress them. Instead of characterising Jutta as a âpretty girl in a propaganda posterâ, whom the soldier will âfight and die forâ, Doerr proffers the unconventional humanisation of women on the home front to pay tribute to the power of staying true to oneself (7). Despite facing the barbaric reality of âsex crazed torturersâ, Doerr illuminates Juttaâs capacity to âlook them in the eyeâ rather than shy away from them as a meditation on her own morals of (8) âwhat is rightâ. The tragic nature (9) of such abuse is specifically chronicled by Doerr to concatenate (10) the continual brave behaviours Jutta portrays even when succumbing to the line that attempts to draw women away from strength and independence. Further referencing her desire to âlock away memoriesâ of the past in her life after the war, the novel posits the importance of women during a period of inordinate history as a powerful force that remained civil even in times of âabsolute blacknessâ. From the perspective of Fredrickâs mother, Doerr seeks to display how her âfake smile to appear braveâ outlines how many mothers and women had to remain strong for their children, such as Fredrick with brain damage, even though they were so close to falling into a world of sorrow and isolation. A clear segregation between soldiers who thought about âthe men they killedâ and women who were made to âfeel complicit in an unspeakable crimeâ (11) they did not commit overall affirms the sacrifices women made during the war and without such sacrifices and strength the thin line between behavioural acts would be broken.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(7) Here I have included an analysis of Doerrâs message - what he is trying to say or show within his novel. Ultimately an author has a message they seek to share with the world. Providing your own interpretation of certain messages the author may be attempting to send to his readers adds real depth to your writing, showing that you are not only considering the novel itself but the purpose of the author and how this novel came to explore the fundamental ideas of the essay prompt.\n\n(8) This quote directly relates to the keyword: civilised behaviour. Finding quotes that are also specific to your prompt is crucial to producing an essay that flows and has meaning.Â\n\n(9) The use of adjectives within the essay paints the picture of whether an act is civil or uncivil which is ultimately what we are attempting to discuss from the prompt. Here the phrase âtragic natureâ, underpins the essence of unjust behaviours shown by the soldiers.\n\n(10) Concatenate - link/connect ideas together\n\n(11) Comparing aspects within the novel is a great way to show your understanding and how the same theme or idea can be shown in many different ways.Â\n\nIn essence, it is the human response to change that divides individuals from ultimately displaying civil or uncivil acts in the world. Established by Marie Laureâs characterisation as a âblind girlâ who can âproject anything onto the black screen of her imaginationâ, Doerr illuminates her ability to adapt to the âchanging timesâ around her. She is seen to be âcarried away by reveriesâ rather than a plethora of voices who âforgo all comfortsâ and âeat and breathe nationâ. Through the chapter and make-believe game âflying couchâ (12), Marieâs nature to âsurrender firearmsâ with Etienne in their imagination is a symbolic adoption to escape the world around them, hence the uncivilised society they are learning to live in. Doerrâs congruent imagery of Etienneâs changing voice of âdreadâ to âvelvetyâ as he becomes intertwined within âMarieâs braveryâ underpins the ability for individuals to seamlessly cross the line from a lack of cultured behaviour to a world of hope and prosperity. Contrasting this, however, Werner, an individual who was initially curious about âhow the world worksâ, is so âoverwhelmed by how quickly things are changing around [him]â that his âinterest in peaceâ is stripped away and no longer exists due to his inability to change with a changing world. Doerr, therefore, laments the transmogrification of his character as a reflection of his uncivil thoughts and ideals as a soldier, ultimately resulting in his loss of ability to ask questions. This idea places emphasis on Volkheimer receiving Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ in the epilogue (13) where the translation of the bookâs title âFragenâ - to âaskâ in English - is symbolic of the moment Werner decided to âwork, join, confess, dieâ he immediately lost the open mind and curiosity he once had. Ultimately, the dichotomy between these two lives and their opposing character transformations resembles the line between remaining calm or acting out of haste when subject to change.\n\nAnnotations\n\n(12) Analysing not only the game but the whole meaning behind chapters and why Doerr has given them certain names is an interesting avenue to take. Here âflying couchâ not only underpins the imagination of Marie Laure but also symbolises freedom and bravery within just the name itself.\n\n(13) The analysis and evidence used from the epilogue is a crucial part of this paragraph and is significant to Doerrâs novel. Unpacking All the Light We Cannot See, there is a lot of evidence and juicy ideas you can draw from the beginning and end of the novel. Here I have almost analysed the meaning of Wernerâs âsoft covered notebookâ to the bone; however, this adds a lot of depth to your writing as Iâm sure your ultimate goal is to make your essays as unique as possible?!\n\nAs a project of humanism, Doerr seeks to portray a fine segregation in people's behaviours as the microcosm (14) of what makes the human existence so unique. Following the journeys of individuals who even âsee a century turnââ the novel displays how oneâs past has an immense influence on how their future values, actions and behaviours grow and develop. Further subverting the stereotypical representation of women living in a war, Doerr establishes an acknowledgment of their roles and strength in the face of cruel situations. Ostensibly, it is the human capacity to adapt to change that marks the difference between what is just and unjust in a society that weighs both on a very unstable scale.Â\n\nAnnotationsâ\n\nâ(14)Â Microcosm - a community, place or situation regarded as encapsulating in miniature the characteristics of something much larger.\n\n---\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our All the Light We Cannot See Prompts blog post.

Thank you so much to everyone who came to the VCE expo that happened last Thursday through to Sunday. It was so great meeting so many of you - I really did not expect this many of you to rock up and say hi, but I'm so grateful that you did. So, thank you again so much! It just reinforces that what I'm doing is being really helpful to you guys, and I'm so glad! I'm going to keep going with this. I'm going to keep making sure that I offer you guys amazing English tips on this channel. So, hit that subscribe button below (check out our YouTube channel here), if you do support, and make sure you tell your friends about it as well, because the more love we can share, the more we help each other out.\n\nToday we're going to be talking about tones. You might be interested in looking at tones because you are analyzing articles, but sometimes we're also looking at tones when it comes to the author's writing style when it comes to texts.Â\n\nSo, What Is a Tone and Why Is It Important?Â\n\nA tone is essentially the attitude that an author takes towards their piece. What is really important is that you realise that there's a difference between tone and mood.\n\nMood has to do more so with the reader's response to an article, whereas tone is the approach that the author has towards the piece.Â\n\nIt's definitely tricky trying to identify tones, but there are a few things that you can ask yourself to help steer yourself in the right direction.Â\n\nFirst thing is: does the author have a positive or negative attitude towards a certain idea? For example, if the author says, 'I can't wait to go to this party' (said in an enthusiastic tone), as opposed to saying, 'I can't wait to go to this party' (said in a sarcastic tone), who do you think is more excited about the party? Probably the first one. In this case, it's been a little bit easier because you see visually how I approached it, but if you just listen to what I've said, the first tone is immersed with a lot more enthusiasm, whereas the second one is sarcasm. Just remember that even though I said it was enthusiasm and sarcasm, if you yourself interpreted it differently than that is okay.Â\n\nRemember with English, as always, there's not always that one perfect answer. Everyone interprets things differently. It's just a matter of you being able to back it up with your own evidence and your own explanation of why you've come to this certain tone.\n\nSo, any form of human emotion can ultimately be translated into a tone. So, whether that is being nostalgic, honoured, sentimental, condescending - these are all tones. And, there are actually so many tones that I've linked a link down below that goes to my blog (if youâre reading this youâre already on our blog!) that includes 195 tones you can choose from. I've also separated these turns into positive, neutral and negative tones and divided them yet again, depending on the type of emotion in order to help steer you in the right direction in picking out a tone amongst all the many, many tones that are available out there.Â\n\nOne more additional tip is that authors can also change their tone. So these can be called tonal shifts, or shifts in tone. An author might not start a book with the same tone and finish it with that same tone - so much has happened throughout the entire book or the event, or maybe even if it's just an article, depending on what they're talking about, they can change their tones. Don't get tripped up by that, acknowledge that sometimes throughout a piece there will be modifications. And, if you're able to pick that up, then that goes a really long way when showing off your efforts to your teachers or examiners.Â\n\nSo, just as a heads up, these tips that I've spoken about are all in our ebook How To Write A Killer Language Analysis. If you're keen to find out more about tones, then go ahead and check it out. There's more there, more examples to help test you, to see whether you're on the right track, more questions that you need to ask yourself to find the right tone and what you can do with tonal changes.\n\nI'm also going to do something a little bit different today, I'll write down three different sentences and I want you guys to interpret them your own way and tell me what tones do you think they are? I think this will be a fun exercise to bring our community together. And I'd just love to see what you guys have to say. I'll check in with you guys next time!\n\nAlright, let's see what different tones you identify from these sentences:\n\n1. Check out my new shoes, I just got them yesterday!\n\n2. It was long since I had returned to this place; the memories washed over me wave after wave.Â\n\n3. It is imperative that we initiate fair laws for all workers!\n\nList of Tones for Language Analysis\n\nWe've all struggled with identifying tones for language analysis. So, I've compiled an assortment of tones you can choose from, categorised into their 'intensities'!Â For a detailed guide on Language Analysis including how to prepare for your SAC and exam, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Language Analysis.\n\nUpdated 26/12/2020\n\nItâs that time of year again when many VCE English students start brainstorming their Oral Presentation SACs. To help you out, weâve collated some of the biggest names and issues in the recent Australian media.\n\nEach heading represents a broad, ongoing issue, and under it are more specific debates within each issue. Going down a more precise route with your topic selection can make your speech a lot more engaging and current, so pick a broad issue that speaks to you, and âzoom inâ on a debate for your speech. Don't forget to also check out Our Ultimate Guide to Oral Presentations for everything you need to know for Oral Presentations.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\n1. Green New Deal\n\nOriginally, the 'New Deal' was a bunch of economic reforms that restimulated the economy back into action after the Great Depression. The 'Green New Deal' is a bunch of policies that combines this economic approach with the need to fight the climate crisis. It was first brought before the United States Congress by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in late 2018, but was ultimately voted down. It called for a 10-year transformation of the economy to provide green jobs; transition to renewable, zero-emission energy sources; and eliminate pollution across sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture and transport.\n\nIs this something that we need to adopt in Australia? Is now the best time for that conversation, given the political climate (not to mention the actual climate of the worst bushfire season in history)? And what exactly are the options?\n\nAustralia Needs a Green New Deal (03/11/2019)\n\nWhat could an Australian green new deal look like? (28/11/2019)\n\nWhy the Green New Deal matters (29/11/2019)\n\nLetâs make the 2020s the decade that Australia gets its mojo back (04/01/2020)\n\n2. Young People on Strike\n\n2019 saw the emergence of the 'school strike for climate', an international movement of students skipping school to demonstrate and demand action on climate change. It took off after Greta Thunberg, a Swedish schoolgirl, began protesting outside the Swedish parliament in late 2018.\n\nIt sparked widespread discussion on young people, education and the merits of striking. Scott Morrison was drawn into the discussion, stating that he doesnât 'want our children to have anxieties about these issues', while defending his governmentâs track record on renewable energy investment.\n\nSo - should young people be worrying about these issues at all? Are they missing out on crucial years of education by taking to the streets? And, is what theyâre saying really unreasonable at all?\n\nGlobal climate "
