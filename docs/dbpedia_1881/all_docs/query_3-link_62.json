It's chaos out there\n\nWeather forecasts are tangible, daily predictions of the future. But it's damn near impossible to get it right—and that's about to get much worse.\n\nHow Project 2025 threatens our secular democracy\n\nIt’s no surprise that Donald Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, given the unpopularity of its goals. Neither is it a surprise that Trump, notoriously incurious about policy, might in fact be telling the truth when he says, \"I know nothing about Project 2025\"\n\nThe personless apology\n\nWhen it screws up, ChatGPT apologizes to me. It has the desired effect: I am defanged in the moment, willing to move on and trust again. But what is artificial remorse doing to the idea of the apology?\n\nThis clusterf*** is bigger than you think\n\nEnjoying a morsel of good news in one corner of the world? Snap out of it.\n\nThe lost humanity in AI medicine\n\nAs we rush into the arms of AI medicine, will compelling research on the importance of the patient-doctor relationship be ignored?"
