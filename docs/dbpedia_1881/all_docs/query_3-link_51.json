He said this in the context of a discussion with Asa Gray about a very specific problem – how to account for the existence of species of plants for which there were no, or few, closely related species. Darwin had speculated that these disjoined species would be found to come from genera which had very few species in total. This was not based on a great deal of observation however, hence it appeared to him to be unscientific. This is an example of the sort of selective reading of Darwin that is fairly common.\n\nHere's more of their conversation:\n\nAsa Gray to Darwin, 23 September 1856\n\nDarwin to Asa Gray, 9 May [1857]\n\nAsa Gray again, 1 June 1857\n\nDarwin's reply (quoted above), 18 June [1857]\n\nAnd finally Asa Gray again, 7 July 1857\n\nTwo down, one to go..."
