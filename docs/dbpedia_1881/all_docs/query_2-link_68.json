        "text": "Post by gee on\n\nThe recording of 'A Whiter Shade of Pale' if it's the one I know is pretty decent quality (tho' what Magic will do to it...)\n\nInstead of such daft titled compilations why don't they put together:\n\n1) 'The Hollies Overseas Hits'\n\n- a compilation of all of the NON UK single hits;\n\n'Very Last Day', 'I've Got A Way of My Own','That's My Desire',\n\n'What's Wrong With The Way I Live', 'Pay You Back With Interest', 'Stewball', 'Dear Eloise','Do The Best You Can', 'Blowin in The Wind','Too Young Too Be Married', 'Man Without A Heart', 'Long Dark Road', 'Magic Woman Touch', 'Slow Down Go Down', 'Son of A Rotten Gambler', 'I'm Down', 'Falling Calling', 'Lonely Hobo Lullaby','Another Night','Sandy','Write On', 'Star','Boulder To Birmingham','Daddy Don't Mind', 'Wiggle That Wotsit','Stop in The Name of Love', 'Stand By Me','Baby Come Back'\n\n28 tracks - 14 per disc in a 2CD set or vols one & two would compile all the NON UK chart hit singles\n\nWhile a few others made either the 'Contemporary' charts or the 'Tip' parade:\n\n'Draggin' My Heels' (Canada - contemporary chart),'Goodbye Tomorrow'( Holland 'Tip' parade), 'Hello To Romance' (Holland), 'Amnesty' (Holland), 'Something To Live For' (Holland) - thats five more that could be included\n\n2) The Hollies 'Rock' Collection:\n\nwhy not do a 4CD set of (or four volumes) of The Hollies Rock flavoured tracks for a change ? (a break from all the slow ballads)\n\ntracks like;\n\nCD ONE:\n\n'(Ain't that) Just Like Me' (unedited version), 'Hey What's Wrong With Me', 'Stay', 'Now's The Time', 'Lucille', 'Memphis','Rockin Robin', 'Talkin Bout You','Candy Man', 'Too Much Monkey Business','Set Me Free', 'Come on Back','Keep off That Friend of Mine', 'She Said Yeah', 'What Kind of Love', 'I'm Alive','Down The Line', 'Lawdy Miss Clawdy','When I Come Home To You', 'Fortune Teller', 'Mickey's Monkey', 'Nobody', 'I've Got A Way of My Own', 'If I Needed Someone', - 24 tracks\n\nCD TWO:\n\n'Look Through Any Window', 'So Lonely', 'I've Been Wrong', 'Running Through The Night', 'I Can't Let Go', 'Sweet Little Sixteen', 'Don't Run And Hide','Take Your Time', 'Don't You Even Care', 'I Take What I Want', 'Don't Even Think About Changing','Suspicious Look in Your Eyes', 'Kill Me Quick', 'Have You Ever Loved Somebody', 'Then The Heartaches Begin','You Need Love', 'When You're Lights Turned On','All The World is Love', 'Step Inside', 'Wheels on Fire', 'Do You Believe in Love ?', 'Please Let Me Please', 'Goodbye Tomorrow'\n\n- 24 tracks\n\nCD THREE:\n\n'Survival of The Fittest', 'Perfect Lady Housewife', 'Hey Willy', 'Hold On', 'You Know The Score', 'Long Cool Woman', 'Won't You Feel Good That Morning', 'Slow Down', 'Courage of Your Convictions', 'If it Wasn't For The Reason', 'Out on The road' (version one), 'Nearer To You', 'Transatlantic Westbound Jet' (version one), 'Curly Billy', 'Down on The Run', 'It's Shame It's A Game', 'Rubber Lucy', 'Out on The Road' (version two), 'Transatlantic Westbound Jet' (version two), 'Look Out Johnny', 'You Gave Me Life','Time Machine Jive' - 22 tracks\n\nCD FOUR:\n\n'Crocodile Woman (She Bites)', '48 Hour Parole', 'Louise', 'Russian Roulette', 'Burn Out', 'Crossfire', 'Satellite Three','That'll Be The Day', 'Midnight Shift', 'Think it Over', 'If The Lights Go Out' (version one),'Somethin Ain't Right', 'Stop in the Name of Love', 'Having A Good Time','If The Lights Go Out' (version two), 'Laughter Turns To Tears', 'Stand By Me', 'This is it', 'No Rules', 'Two Shadows', 'The Woman I Love', 'Purple Rain' (Live version) - 22 tracks\n\n- 92 tracks in total (not sure if they all would all fit onto even four CDs ?) but the ideas are interesting ones with some logic and better than aimless piffle like; 'Little Names' and 'Sweeties' etc\n\nPost by cameron on\n\nI tried to keep the Hollies Sing Country to 1969-1970 tracks as this is around the time that they intended to record an album of Countryfied songs - the idea being that it might sound something like what the album would have turned out like. But for the purposes of a compilation, there are plenty of later tracks that would warrant inclusion. I've also doctored my own version of the \"lost\" 1968 album to tweak the tracks to 'finish' the album and give it a smoother flow. The tracks and styles are extremely varied, but the result reminds me of Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich's 1968 gem, \"If No One Sang\" that's also a very eclectic - yet pop friendly - mix. I guess bands at the time were of the opinion of \"anything is possible\" and such varied and eclectic albums were becoming the norm.\n\nSince Magic aren't averse to using bootleg material from questionable sources, they could release 'expanded' versions of the Hollies albums. I've only managed to put together 1966-1970 so far, but here's what a \"deluxe\" version could look like:\n\nFor Certain Because... (1966)\n\nDisc 1: Stereo:\n\n1.

What you get is the Nash led Hollies at the start of the project pushing 'Butterfly' to the next level with 'Relax', 'Tomorrow When It Comes' (amazingly, written by Allan!) and 'Open Up Your Eyes'. Then as Butterfly fails to gain momentum as previous Hollies albums had done (sometimes it took them a few months to climb the charts), they turned to their blatant commercialism with 'Jennifer Eccles', 'Like Every Time Before' and 'Listen To Me'. Then they (presumably followed Nash again) with an attempt to try more \"serious\" pop music 'Man With No Expression', 'Survival Of The Fittest' and 'Do The Best You Can' before dropping out altogether into Cabaret with 'A Taste of Honey' and 'Blowin In The Wind'! All the time, Bobby and Allan were quoted as saying to the press that the Hollies were working on their new album, so presumably they were writing like mad and not recording the tracks? Or perhaps the Hollies were just telling the fans what they wanted to hear? Most of what was recorded in 1968 either wasn't released at the time (in the UK at least) or trickled out on single releases. There's a good album worth of material there. Perhaps it was intended to be such an eclectic mix after all?\n\nI wonder at what point they started to worry that the new album was struggling to take shape - their attempt at a live LP in May to fill the gap ended disastrously. There's a bootleg of the same tour in Japan and they're on fire! From what I've heard, they're certainly on par with their set in Stockholm, 1966. Even the Split festival several months later was a better performance than the one that they committed to tape for an official live album. Although I don't think it's that bad to be honest. It's not the Hollies' best, no, but even when they're not at their peak, they still sound better live than other bands that released live LPs in the 60's such as the Kinks and Rolling Stones, IMO. I'm not convinced we've heard the full set - eight songs is not enough for an album and they're all standard length tracks (unlike the Kinks' Kelvin Hall LP that has the 8-minute long rendition of 'Milk Cow Blues' and the reprise of 'Sunny Afternoon' taking the track to over 5-minutes long and all the talking in between that stretches the album time out to fill two sides of an LP), the Hollies set sounds rather \"staged\" as there's so little audience interaction between tracks. But, having said that, their setlists at the time were only 8-10 tracks long and the shows still managed to last half an hour thanks to their humour and interaction with the audience in between the songs.\n\nI guess EMI really saved their asses by issuing 'Hollies Greatest' which became their only Number One LP. So well was business, that they even turned to promoting it on Top Of The Pops! Perhaps that contributed to the final push for the blatantly commercial Hollies Sing Dylan project that finally pushed Graham over the edge? Who knows. But I can say for sure that after the Summer Of Love the year before and the bandwagon that everyone jumped on, the Hollies certainly weren't the only mainstream band not to release an album in 1968 as everyone tried to find their feet again.\n\nPost by cameron on\n\nThe \"Lost\" Hollies album is an absolute favourite of mine also; compiled from the 'Clarke Hicks Nash' set, my ipod album \"Hollies '68\" is excellent.\n\nMan with No Expression, Relax, Tomorrow when it Comes, Jennifer Eccles, Open up your Eyes, Like every time before, Do the Best you Can, Wings, A Taste of Honey, and Blowin' in the Wind.\n\nAm I missing any tracks recorded after 'Butterfly' that should make the 'Hollies '68' opus?\n\nOne can only hope, Gee. I'd love to hear the Nash version of Survival Of The Fittest. I've sort of deciphered that the left channel of the stereo mix is the original 1968 version and the right channel has some elements mixed to mono (like bass, drums) but overdubs like Tony's lead guitar and Allan's double tracked voice and Terry's harmony. Subtract the right track and you're left with a very basic 1968 version, possibly just missing Nash's harmony and a few finishing touches. Perhaps the \"Lost 1968 Album\" might be an interesting compilation release, sneaking out the Nash version of Survival Of The Fittest? It could even have a version of Marrakesh Express on it. Years ago, a VH1 documentary about Graham Nash was aired with a snippet of his original 1968 demo (just him and his guitar) and I've always suggested that this could be synced up with the \"backing track\" recorded by the Hollies to provide an idea of a finished take, a la Postcard or Butterfly with just Nash's voice on it.\n\nirelandcalling4, a little further up the thread I provided my version of the \"Lost 1968 Album\":\n\n1. Open Up Your Eyes 2. Do The Best You Can 3. Relax 4. Tomorrow When It Comes 5. Man With No Expression 6. Like Every Time Before 7. Survival Of The Fittest 8. Wings 9. Jennifer Eccles 10. A Taste Of Honey 11. Blowin' In The Wind (Nash Version) 12. Listen To Me\n\nPost by gee on\n\nTim Chacksfield told me he had listened to The Hollies 'backing track' of 'Marrakesh Express' and you would NOT recognise it as the CSN hit at all...!\n\nTim said it's just an attempt at the tune but it's incomplete, has NO 'guide vocal' at all and wasn't releasable even as an instrumental version as such just a 'run through' that you could not even put a guide vocal over...(Tim said if it had been remotely useable he'd have put it out like a shot !)\n\n- unless anything else crops up re 'Marrakesh Express' I guess we'll have to accept Tim's view on it....(pity)\n\nGraham's original acoustic guitar/vocal demo WOULD be worth a release I think.\n\nTim also told me then that 'Cry Me A River' was NOT in the tape box marked thus...\n\nmost of the others are just classed as: 'not releasable' so maybe it's all a question of studio time (& of course money !) needing to be spent on making them releasable (hopefully)\n\nbut we are still waiting a proper sonic overhaul of the back catalogue (notably the four sixties albums with that ultra primitive stereo mix)\n\nIf The Beatles 'Help !' album still has not been properly remixed to clarify the sound quality (it still sounds a very rushed & 'muddy' mix as it was in 1965, particularly the stereo mix) then what realistic hope for The Hollies albums ?\n\nthe crucial sales figures of the new CD set out on 10 July may be a pointer towards anything further we get from Warners re The Hollies"
