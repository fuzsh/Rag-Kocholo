        "text": "Some supporters of Darwin's theory of evolution have misapplied the biological principles of natural selection -- \"survival of the fittest\" -- to the social, political, and economic realms.\n\nThe idea of \"social Darwinism\" originated in the class stratification of England, and has often been used as a general term for any evolutionary argument about the biological basis of human differences. Drawing on social Darwinism, supporters of the 20th-century eugenics movement sought to \"improve\" human genetic stock, much as farmers do in agriculture.\n\nThis essay examines the history of eugenics and considers modern genetic research in the same light, so that the lessons of history are not forgotten."
