        "text": "For the first time, my Music Industry Entrepreneurship class is full. There is even one student on the waitlist. ðŸ¥¹ If you told me 10yrs ago that I would be teaching entrepreneurship to music students at University of Colorado Denver (named one of the Top Music Business Schools in the world by Billboard) I would have LAUGHED. Now, I'm going into my third semester feeling confident and inspired. I feel for all the educators trying to figure out how AI fits into their classroom. I'm feeling very fortunate that my class is rooted in entrepreneurship and personal experiences - both dynamic, fluid, and it's generally encouraged to explore cutting edge technology and tools. I did have to fail a student last semester for using ChatGPT to write their final paper. Unless the student actually did have a knowledge cutoff date of September 2021 as it related to the Spring 2023 semester.. Classes start next week. I am excited to see what entrepreneurial projects the students will be building this semester. Send your favorite entrepreneurship, music industry, or general school advice and I'll share the best ones with the class!"
