        "text": "(The following is an excerpt from a feature published in the \"Health & Fitness Issue\" of GRAMMY magazine. Read the complete feature here.)\n\nMaroon 5 frontman Adam Levine practices yoga to improve his \"Moves Like Jagger.\" Pop diva Pink maintains her radiant glow with a fat-melting mix of aerobics and weight lifting, while Red Hot Chili Peppers vocalist Anthony Kiedis follows a seafood-inclusive vegetarian diet that helps sculpt his physique.\n\nDetermined to pace their careers for the long haul, a growing number of artists are trading the zero-sum mantra of \"sex, drugs and rock and roll\" for the more balanced equation of spirituality, personal trainers and private chefs. GRAMMY-winning singer/songwriter Kelly Rowland sums up her attitude behind the new health consciousness: \"I always wanted to not be overworked, yet still have passion for what I do,\" she says.\n\nWith a hectic schedule filled with 6 a.m. wake-up calls, 12-hour music video shoots and red-eye flights, during which one day morphs into the next, Rowland has learned the steps to take to avoid burnout. She takes catnaps on planes, cars and limos. (\"You sneak sleep in,\" she says.) To mentally prepare for her day, Rowland practices spiritual exercises.\n\n\"My meditation is breathing and prayer in the morning,\" she adds. \"I do believe in a higher power, and I let his will be done above anything. As long as I get that time in and take my vitamins, I'm pretty much OK.\"\n\nTo help maintain her energy and lithesome figure, Rowland enlists the aid of Jeanette Jenkins, the self-styled \"Hollywood Trainer\" who encourages a diet rich in nutrient-dense plant foods, as well as iron, calcium and vitamin C supplements. \"I balance it out,\" Rowland says of her diet. \"I call it the 80/20 rule. Eighty percent of the time I eat clean, and 20 percent of the time I can have some banana pudding and sea salt caramel gelato. I can have fruit, salads and fish, but I also love a steak every now and then, too.\"\n\nIt appears that Rowland's sensible approach to health has paid off handsomely as she's expecting to release a follow-up to her 2011 workout DVD, Sexy Abs With Kelly Rowland, which features Jenkins.\n\n\"It's really great to get other people engaged in fitness and working out,\" says Rowland. \"It's not about being skinny or a specific size, but about maintaining what you should for your body.\"\n\nLike Rowland, many artists appear to be spending nearly as much time in the gym as they do onstage. …\n\nRead the complete \"Survival Of The Fittest\" feature in the summer issue of GRAMMY magazine.\n\n(Bruce Britt is an award-winning journalist and essayist whose work has appeared in The Washington Post, USA Today, San Francisco Chronicle, Billboard, and other publications. He lives in Los Angeles.)\n\nMaroon 5 keyboardist PJ Morton's guest-stuffed new album, Cape Town to Cairo, is built on an attention-grabbing conceit. He wrote and recorded it within a 30-day span, while journeying the African continent, visiting Johannesburg, Lagos, Accra, up to Cairo, back down to South Africa.\n\nBut a good story is just that, and the entire project — which features Fireboy DML, Mádé Kuti, the Soweto Spiritual Singers, and others — would collapse without quality songs. \"The songs were the main thing,\" the five-time GRAMMY winner says. \"It doesn't matter who I have on these songs if I don't have any good songs, so that was the priority.\"\n\nIt's a chicken-or-egg situation; the raw materials of Cape Town to Cairo are solid, but the guests helped them truly pop. Of Nigerian native Fireboy DML, who Morton worked with in his home country: \"I had a bit of my song 'Count on Me' already, and he sat there and wrote that in 20 minutes,\" he says, with awe still palpable in his voice.\n\nElsewhere, Morton hails South African trumpeter and composer Ndabo Zulu's sense of instrumental space on \"All the Dreamers\" (which also features singer/songwriter Aṣa), and on the highlife \"Who You Are,\" Mádé Kuti's channeling of his grandfather Fela Kuti's essence.\n\nWhat was Morton's primary takeaway from the experience? Most of us abstractly understand how much Africa influenced American music; it's another ballgame altogether to witness it firsthand — as this native New Orleanian did.\n\n\"When I'm in Lagos, Nigeria, and I'm seeing the horn players play, I'm like, Man, this feels like home,\" Morton enthuses. \"I'm in Ghana, and I hear highlife, I'm like, This feels like a second line or something. And then, I eat jollof rice, and I'm like, Man, this is jambalaya. This is their version.\"\n\nRead on for the full interview about Cape Town to Cairo, and what Maroon 5's working on in 2024.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nWhen our CEO, Harvey Mason jr., traveled Africa, he called the experience \"mind-bending,\" \"game-changing\" and \"eye-opening.\" What was your reaction?\n\nOh, man. That was constantly happening for me over and over. When someone says, \"Welcome home,\" or I look at money and see a Black man on the money, I'm like, Man. This is a different place, and so much love.\n\nBut for me, it was all the connections I was making to my home. I mean, being from New Orleans, a lot of the food, the music, the way they dance in the streets, and the way they celebrate, it just was really a bunch of connections happening for me. I'd say it was a life-changing trip for me.\n\nI totally hear that syncopation and swing in Maroon 5.\n\nYeah. This is a big statement, but ultimately all our music is African music. It's hard to unsee once you see that. Now, all I see and hear is Africa a lot of times. We've used those three chords and the truth forever. These banjos, these things were created in Africa.\n\nI've been in Maroon 14 years, and I think a reason I connected with the guys is because we're influenced by the same things — even in different worlds that we didn't realize were the same things.\n\nCan you talk about the process of making Cape Town to Cairo while on the road?\n\nThat's what was so crazy about this — I created the album in 30 days while in Africa from scratch.\n\nSo, there was no time to process and then put it together, which was also just fascinating — something I never do. I take my time. I'm intricate. I cross every T and dot every I, so this was an experiment in trusting my instincts and just trusting what I know that has gotten me this far in music.\n\nThat was a really interesting part — because I had to quickly process what I was feeling, or not even fully process, but allow my soul and my body to process it and just write whatever was coming out, and create whatever music that was happening in South Africa.\n\nSounds like a heavy readjustment of your usual thinking.\n\nAs soon as I stepped on the ground and the first day we were in the studio, everybody was kind of on edge because they didn't know what I was going to write. I didn't know what I was going to write, but three songs came immediately.\n\nThree ideas came that very first day I was in the studio, and that kind of relaxed me a bit, but that was the process. It was feel where you are, go in the studio, write some melodies, create some music, come back a few days later, put lyrics to that, and then redo.\n\nAnd so, we did from South Africa, we started in Cape Town, obviously to Cairo, but with Cape Town. Then we went to Johannesburg, and all in between this, I was doing shows. We were doing concerts. I was doing radio interviews, TV interviews. I really wanted to just engulf myself as fast as I could.\n\nWhen we got to Lagos, we landed on Fela Kuti's birthday, who's the father of Afrobeat. And man, it was so inspiring for me. I went in the studio the next day in Lagos, and the same thing happened — three songs just like that, three ideas.\n\nOne thing that was also different from my process is, sequencing is so important to me, but I couldn't leave Africa without knowing that these songs worked together. So I had to kind of work through that process in a truncated period of time, but I'm so proud of what happened. It's just really listening to my instincts, and it is raw emotion, this album is.\n\nSome of the songs, I didn't realize what I was talking about until after I listened to them, and it was like, oh, I thought I was talking about this, but I'm talking about this.\n\nSuch as?\n\n\"Please Be Good to Me,\" specifically, it was like, I thought it was like a sexy love song, vibe song, but I feel like I'm talking to Africa.\n\nLike, Take me to another place. I don't need to be in control. I've promised all these people I'm going to write an album in 30 days. Continent, please be good to me. Just give it to me. I have bad writer's block sometimes, so I was hoping that didn't happen, and it worked out.\n\nFela Kuti… speaking of people who should be on money. But what's his significance to you, personally?\n\nI just think the way he was a fighter, the way he was a band leader, I really pride myself on musicianship.\n\nAgain, being from New Orleans — Afro Orleans is the name of my new band that we're going out with in the summer, and it's the horns, it's the percussion and all of that. So it is in that spirit of Fela. Also, his grandson, Mádé Kuti, is on one of the songs, \"Who You Are.\"\n\nHe's the first person that made me pay attention to African music in general. My gateway was Fela. And so, to connect it this way, and to finally be in Lagos where he did it — to be at the shrine — was just special.\n\nYou made Cape Town to Cairo in such an intuitive and freewheeling manner. How did you ensure an album came out the other end, and not a bunch of outtakes or something?\n\nIt was trial and error, man, because initially I was trying to do so much stuff that I was like, Wait, I lost my voice. You know what I'm saying? I was just trying to do too much, and I was like, OK, let's kind of refocus and keep the main thing. So, I had to cancel some interviews; I had to cancel some things and really focus on the main things.\n\nFor me, it was trusting those ideas, the things that felt good. What happens in the studio with me is, sometimes I'll have a good idea, but I'm like, well, I can beat that. Let me try to beat it, and then I'll try to beat it. Sometimes, that first one was the one that was supposed to happen, but technically I'm beating it.\n\nBut am I beating it? I don't know, because maybe it wanted to come out in that pure form, and not have me get in the way with all my knowledge and years of [experience].\n\nSo I started to really trust that. I really just was like, OK, first idea, let's go. This first melody, that's what came out. Let's go with that. Then, I would write lyrics to my mumble track of the melody that I felt right, that moved me immediately. Thankfully, I've been writing songs for a long time, and we got to it, man.\n\nBut you're right — it wasn't just about writing songs in 30 days. It's about writing a complete album that I thought was good in 30 days, which is a completely different thing. But I just locked in, man, and I'm still kind of tripping that it happened this way, but I can literally place every song and remember where I was because it's such a short period of time.\n\nI can't wait to fully see the footage of me creating from scratch. We're working on the documentary now, but I've never seen myself make something from nothing [like] this. So, I'm excited to see the inception to the full thing.\n\nWhat's Maroon 5 up to?\n\nWe just did Questlove's podcast and talked about it a little bit, but we're definitely working on a record. Adam's been on fire writing lately, and we just finished the residency in Vegas days ago. We'll be back in Vegas in September, at Park MGM.\n\nBut it's going great, man. The music is coming out really cool. I joined at a unique time, which is after Hands All Over and before \"Moves Like Jagger\" and all of that stuff. It was a transition when Adam started to bring in co-work, and Hands All Over is the last time they didn't use co-writers.\n\nSo, now it's back to just him writing, and it's refreshing. I can't lie. It's exciting.\n\n2024 GRAMMYs: How The New Best African Music Performance GRAMMY Category Is A Massive Win For The World\n\nBorn in Cotonou, Benin, Starr achieved monumental success with her single \"Rush,\" released in 2022 as part of the deluxe version of 19 & Dangerous. The track became the most streamed solo song by a Nigerian female artist on Spotify and propelled her to become the youngest African female artist to surpass 100 million views on a single YouTube video. The Nigerian singer/songwriter's remarkable talent even captured the attention of former President Barack Obama, who included \"Rush\" in his annual year-end playlist in 2022.\n\nThe record-breaking track is nominated for the inaugural Best African Music Performance category at the 66th GRAMMY Awards. Ahead of the 2024 GRAMMYs, Arya Starr spoke to GRAMMY.com about family, touring Europe and how her relationship with numbers is her way of documenting her growth.\n\nThis conversation has been edited for clarity.\n\nHow are you recovering after your first headline tour?\n\nWell, there's no recovery for me anytime soon.\n\nAfter the world tour, my schedule is still packed with other stuff to do. I'm enjoying it to be honest. I had a two-day break and I could sit in one place. I'm just very used to the chaos of it all. I'm a proper Lagos babe, so I'm always buzzing for what's next.\n\nGood thing you mentioned Lagos. Your parents bounced around places; from being born in Benin to moving to Abuja and then finally settling in Lagos, how have those migrations have influenced your sound?\n\nI feel like living in different places has really shaped my mind. I really know how to adapt to places, people as well as situations.\n\nAnd you can hear that in the music. I know how to try and do different things. I know how to put different cultures and different worlds into what I'm doing. In Stability for instance, you can hear the French aspect of my life. I grew up listening to [Congolese singer and composer] Awilo and I sampled that. I mixed that with Lagos life — proper Afrobeats vibes.\n\nYour career has featured a pattern of numbers. I read that you like the number 5, your debut album was titled 19 & Dangerous, and your tour was called 21. Why have numbers become a prominent part of your career?\n\nTo be honest, it comes very naturally to me. I don't know what it is yet. I've not tapped into that aspect of my life. I think it might make sense in the third album where I'll be able to answer this question.\n\nBut I just like numbers. Right now, my favorite number is eight. I say eight all the time. I don't even know why eight is just my number now. And with 19 & Dangerous and the tour called 21, it's just me relating everything to my age and where I am currently in life. It's just showing people that [what's happening in my life] is a very present movement and activity. I want people to know that, yeah, I did that when I was 19.\n\nDoes that mean it's sort of a brag?\n\nIt's less of me showing off and bragging and more about me being present. There were a lot of people that were 19 at that time. There were a lot of people that were 20, or 29 but could relate to what I was saying. With 21 now, I want to associate it with a feeling and less of a number.\n\nSo it's just you documenting your growth as an artist?\n\nExactly! I'm stealing that by the way. [Laughing]\n\nYou've toured and opened for several artists like Koffee in the past, but this is your first headline tour. How did that feel?\n\nAmazing. I’ve been touring for a while, but doing my own [tour] was a different feeling. Like people bought tickets to see me. I'm the reason they're there.\n\nThere's no time to mess up. It's a different type of pressure. At a certain point, during the Europe tour, I was just like, I’m so relaxed because it's my stage, they're here to see me you know. If I fall down, it's all part of the vibe. It's an experience for them. They're gonna talk about it years from now.\n\nLuckily that wouldn't happen… or did it?\n\nAh, it happened already but I'm over it. But it wasn't during this tour. I just got up immediately. I couldn't let that weigh me down.\n\nAnd would you say that's the theme of your life? Falling and getting back up?\n\nDefinitely, I'm not afraid to be seen trying, and that's like my whole M.O. because I'm not perfect, and I want that to inspire people.\n\nI didn't know how to do riffs and runs last year; I had to learn it. I didn't know how to learn choreography in one day, but now I'm doing that. I'm constantly trying, constantly bettering myself, to show people I didn't come perfect. I didn't come knowing any of this, and I had to learn along the way.\n\nThis is me documenting. When I say my age, I want people to be aware that I didn't know anything. I'm just figuring this out.\n\nWhat memorable moments do you have from touring?\n\nSinging \"Rush,\" the acoustic version, with my fans. I met this fan that was pregnant and she sent her baby scan and she wanted to let me know she's naming her baby Ayra. I loved it so much, it made me so happy.\n\nThat and just spending time with my team and my friends and being on stage. Every minute of being on stage is very memorable.\n\nDid you face any challenges while touring and how did you deal with them?\n\nI'm human at the end of the day, and you get tired, overwhelmed, sick. I had the flu every two business days. I lost my voice. There are a lot of challenges on the road, but we can't let that stop us.\n\nThe thing about touring is that the world isn't stopping for me. I still have my family, my younger sister that wants to talk to me every day, I still have my younger brother. I have friends to keep up with. I have to be a human being outside of this. It's not necessarily a challenge; it's just something I'm aware of, and sometimes it can be hard.\n\nIs your family happy and proud of you?\n\nMy younger brother makes music with me, so he's literally my partner. I'm also basically on the road with my family. I was with my mum in Paris. I try my best for them to experience it too.\n\nWhen I'm not with them, I just feel so guilty. I want my people to feel what I'm feeling; I want them to see the countries too because we all started together. I want them to experience the exact same thing I'm experiencing. I try to spend as much time with them as possible.\n\nMy mum knows every lyric to every song. We were having a conversation, and she was referencing \"Ase.\" I was like \"OMG, mummy please, please!\" So it's an everyday thing; they're in my life. They're very proud of me, but they're also kinda used to it as well. I feel like everybody expected it to happen.\n\nYou're known for your uplifting and empowering lyrics, but have you found yourself in a situation where you're feeling down and you need a little bit of Ayra?\n\nDefinitely. I do have down and negative times where I'm in my head, I'm tired, or I'm not motivated. So, in a way, it's sort of a selfish thing where I make those songs for myself. I have songs that I make for the future. Music is therapy for me.\n\nYou first went into modeling and then finding music. How proud would little Ayra be of you right now, and how much of all what she experienced made you who you are today?\n\nShe'd definitely be proud, but even right now, when I look back, I'm so proud of little Ayra too. It's because of her that I'm here now. It's because of that 16-year-old girl that didn't give up and kept going.\n\nI wanted to do modeling because everyone told me I couldn't do it, like I'm not tall enough, and I told them, \"watch me.\" And I ended up doing it.\n\nHow did music come into the fold from modeling?\n\nI used to do cover [songs] on Instagram. My mum and her friends used to force me to do covers. I uploaded one cover on Instagram — I didn't even like the video. But something just kept telling me to post it and I did. Not up to 6 hours later, [Marvin Records CEO] Don Jazzy reached out. Three days later, he signed me.\n\nYour fashion choices are constantly under scrutiny by fans, particularly by men. Did being constantly bludgeoned with such remarks regarding the male gaze affect you in any way?\n\nI've always had a mind of my own. Growing up in different places, in different cultures, has shaped my mind. And in spite of all these influences, I'm still myself. I went to a very religious school. I wrote \"Asé\" when I was 15 — I had no business writing that song. So that gives you a glimpse of the kind of mindset I had at a young age.\n\nAnd I still have now. I'm not really bothered about the male, female gaze, or anybody's gaze for that matter, except my own. I'm an artist to the core, and I want my style, my hair, my music, to represent how I feel. I don't really care about aesthetics, it's more about how I feel.\n\nWhat was the energy like before and after finding out about your GRAMMY nomination?\n\nI was alone in my hotel room. I remember just speaking to God, asking him to let me be nominated. If I was nominated, I'd be so grateful because I'd know that all my hard work was not in vain.\n\nThis nomination came at one of my low days. I was unmotivated, doubting myself. It was cold, and I was just tired. I was like, I just want rice and stew, abeg. I'm just tired, abeg [meaning please]. Next thing I know, I started getting calls. Tyla sent me a message. So even before I found out, people had started messaging and congratulating me. After I checked, I just knelt down and thanked God.\n\nMeeting people like David Guetta and Kelly Rowland, both of whom you idolize, must have been an incredible experience. Which encounter was the most memorable for you?\n\nEverything has been memorable — meeting Kelly, David. Like the Nigerian girl in me wanted to call him Mr. David, but he was like \"no Ayra\" and I was like \"no sir but….\" [Laughs.] All these people, they're human beings, and we forget that sometimes. They're regular humans with their lives, making music and doing what they love.\n\nDavid was an amazing person. He was so free. After every lyric I recorded, he'd whisk me up in the air. He was so hyped and happy. Then Kelly was like the most amazing human being. I'm so blessed to know her. She is an inspiration to me and everything to me. Even before she recorded the verse, I'd loved her for a long time.\n\nI don't know how she does it, whenever I'm feeling low or down, she just knows. She'll send me a random message or voice memo telling me to keep going. She's the most amazing human being; I love her so much. She's like my big aunty, she's my friend. She's a friend.\n\n2024 GRAMMY Nominations: See The Full Nominees List"
