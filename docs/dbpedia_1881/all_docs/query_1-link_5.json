        "text": "Every song has a story to tell, and some contain hidden stories or lessons, while others are completely blatant. In Billy Joel’s song, “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” he does not hesitate to be very obvious with what he tries to prove, which is how all of the events in his song contribute to one large fire. I chose to remediate Joel’s song because it spoke to me with historical context. When researching the song, I read a majority of the history behind it and decided to reflect upon it in a visual picture collage, combining a majority of the elements he mentions with pictures--all circled around a fire in the middle. I decided to also make red-dyed cupcakes reflecting the fire Joel speaks of and ice them with a flame, yet placing an X over it,\n\nThe main characters are wearing modern clothes and are in modern society. They could be people we know and the video displays them in love. By showing them as good people or using ethos, the audience is going to be against the gang. The gang in the video are against the main characters because of their sexuality which is called homophobia. Because of ethos in the video, the audience is going to be against the gang and homophobia.\n\nThe content of the video and the song itself overall is good in the beginning the sound and pace starts with an actor humming he’s the father of the main actor in the video. Then it brings in some soft instrumentals for about 30 seconds. Then for about the first minute it is a soft smooth voice that you hear from Logic. As Logic begins to pick up the pace the video also picks up the pace as you start going through the main actors’ life at a quicker pace. You watch the main actor storm out of his house after his father finds a gay magazine. Then suddenly, the singing stops and the instruments carry on softly. The singing stops because it is a crucial part of the video and it wants you to pay attention. The main actor was staying at his boyfriend’s house and his boyfriends dad knocks on the door and finds them in bed together so the main actor grabs his stuff and gets escorted out of the house. This part of the video is a little confusing though since the father doesn’t seem to forcibly remove him. The main actor just kind of up and leaves. I think the main actor leaves willingly because he’s embarrassed that he got caught with him. The father the whole time giving off a confused state. When the singing comes back in its one of the featured artist on the song. While she sings the main actor appears to walk through life in a state of depression. Then logic comes back in and continues sing with a smooth flow. While the main actor begins to get bullied cause, his classmates\n\nThe song I picked for this homework assignment is called Runaway Love by Ludacris and Mary J. Blige. The song is describing the hardships of three young girls and their struggle to survive. Finally, the girls are fed up with the lives they are forced to live and decide to pack up their things and run away. I think this song can relate to many aspects of sociology that we have learned in class. Some examples shown through the song are poverty, education, healthcare, marriage and family. All three girls’ different stories and struggles they face.\n\nThis novel takes place primarily in the city of Charlottesville, Virginia, during the period of the 1980s to the 2000s. Renee and Rob both met there in a bar named the ‘Eastern Standard’ both at the age of twenty-three. He initially planned to keep his relationship to Charlottesville strictly one of host and guest. Both he and Renee didn’t really favor Charlottesville. Then life had another plan for Rob and it was to fall in love. The setting was also a crucial part in the story because it was a music thriving environment at the time and in Charlottesville. Also, it shows that it greatly influenced the connection that Renee and Rob made with each other. The setting\n\nLudacris does a remarkable job of portraying his message about the struggles that some adolescents are faced with. “Runaway Love”, by Ludacris, featuring Mary J. Blige (2007), represents the theme of struggle through hip-hop and rap music. It is about little girls who are “stuck up in the world on their own.” They have to take care of themselves because the people they are around do not care about them. They range from nine to eleven years in age, and their goal in life, at such a young age, is to run away from home. Ludacris is trying to get the listener to realize the struggles that even children have to face because adults are not the only ones who have problems, like most people believe. He is very successful in\n\n“A Love Song for Bobby Long” written by Grayson Capps and “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” written by TS Eliot remind the world of men who struggle with the demons of life. The little voices in your head saying “I don’t think you can do that.” These voices cause you to doubt yourself and your talents. They take the life out of you, and cause you to wonder if you even have a purpose here on earth. Now let’s take a deeper look into these poems and closely analyze their similarities and differences.\n\nIn my opinion, Kendrick Lamar, an award-winning rapper and songwriter, has one of the best abilities to describe his distressed and abused lifestyle in Compton, California. He is not your original cliché artist who does not speak about anything meaningful. Kendrick, also known as K. Dot, is one of the most well known and most respected rappers in this era. Not only does he speak about his gloomy past, but he also speaks about his fortunate future. His ability to give detailed representations of his struggles and his story telling allows me to, metaphorically, enter the mind of Kendrick Lamar.\n\nFor the lyric analysis essay, I chose to analyze the rap artist NF and my top six songs by him to help get a better understanding of what he has been through in his life and how he has gotten to where he is now. I like these particular songs more than his other ones probably due to my ability to relate to them on some level as well as the rhythm of the song, most of them are more focused on the lyrics rather than having loud background music or singing them fast paced. My favorite song of from the list above is “Wake Up” while my sisters’ is “All I Have” and she is the one who introduced me to this particular rapper. NF uses common themes and touches on social issues in lyrics. The reason for this is that he is a Christian hip hop artists making his name in mainstream hip hop, he has to be transparent and relatable to his listeners.\n\nThe song “Where is the Love?” has many sociological concepts put into the lyrics. It is the first song that popped up in my head when seeing this assessment and if you have ever heard the song then you would know why I chose this specific song. The band in this song expresses the the world's issues and they express their view on the world and the actions others make. The main idea of the song is concentrated on the reality and how the world is changing.\n\nIn the song “Happy” by Pharrell Williams, the message in the song is to always be happy, and that the sky is the limit. When I was younger I always had big goals and I still believe it, and I keep reminding myself of the message in the song when I’m upset or angry. When I was younger, I never seemed to enjoy the present moment and I was always looking towards the future, and once the future came, I realized that I should’ve enjoyed the past, and not look at the future, and appreciate what’s there in the moment. When I started listening to this song a few years ago, I started hearing the true message in this song, and I started appreciating my life, and enjoying every moment of it. I figured out that the\n\nThe song \"The message\" by Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five depicts the struggle of young black adults growing up in society. The struggle to make it out of poverty can be compared to survival of the fittest in a jungle. Only the strong would survive and adapt to the changes to fit in. Trying their best to make a betterment with whatever little society offers. Being a young black African American in the early 1980's was not easy. It was easier to live the fast life and gain fast money by being part of the drug community. Drugs, guns, and money was glamorized and this is what the young adults looked at as a means of getting rich. In the songs, a young man talks about how he is trying hard to hold on to the little bit of sanity he has left in his soul. He talks about the struggle he endures while trying not to get pushed over the edge. He was born an innocent child who's blind to the ways of mind kind. Growing up he faced many challenges and had to fight\n\nIn 1984, an iconic song was created by two sensational artists Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. A song they created inspired millions, originally created for people of Africa during the time of a horrific famine, was later recreated for the earthquake of Haiti. And for many years our world has been through so much trauma, trauma such as diseases, shootings, and devastating natural disasters. That song we know as “We Are The World” created such an inspiring notion that sparks to change our perspective of the world, how it is ours the children like Jackson said’ “ We are the world, we are the children” meaning we are all connected and the lyrics of this song represents that."
