        "text": "In this context selection does not mean \"to choose\" or \"decide,\" and I'm very surprised you did not know that. It is the means by which survivors are left standing. It is random and has little or nothing to do with special powers of living. It's very like luck, but not quite. The way things pan out, so to speak. You probably understand the general concept, so I don't see any roadblocks posed by this evolutionary process. In biological terms these are fairly straight-forward, even for laymen like us. If we're talking psychology and sociology, then I might not sound so sure of the definition. I have read and listened to discussions about the insufficiency of these terms to define human behavior. Social Darwinism and scientific racism are sometimes said to be offshoots of this set of ideas, but in my firm belief, they are not justified or proven by this.\n\nIn this context selection does not mean \"to choose\" or \"decide,\" and I'm very surprised you did not know that.

Social Darwinism and scientific racism are offshoots of this set of ideas, but in my firm belief, they are not justified or proven by this.\n\nWhen you say survivors standing, that means a timeline, which is something that is a product of our thinking.\n\nIn other words, just because a certain species is alive and widespread today, it does not mean its a survivor, it simply means, its existent in our time and we are conscious of its existence.\n\nThe word survivor does not make sense if there is no concept of time, because its only time that defines a survivor. In nature there is no time, there is no beginning and there is no end; therefore, there is no state that a species can reach and it can no longer die out -- and those species that are our contemporaries are not survivors, they just happen to be our contemporary.\n\nFireatwill said:\n\nIn other words, just because a certain species is alive and widespread today, it does not mean its a survivor...\n\nI think it does. You appear to be arguing that \"survival\" means survival forever, conversely I'm pretty sure that's not how most people would understand the word.\n\nIf a species is alive and widespread today, it means that it has survived so far. It has survived.\n\nThe phrase \"survival of the fittest\" is something of a distortion from evolutionary theory anyway, it would be more accurate to say \"survival of those best fitted to the environment they are living in\". The former implies mental and physical strength etc which are far from being global prerequisites for the survival of a species. As mentioned in other posts, the distorted version is generally bandied about by social darwinists in order to justify \"neglect of the weakest\".\n\nEven in evolutionary terms, the word fit does not mean anything. For one the concept of time is a human concept, in nature this is no time, there is no eras and there is no BC/AD and epochs. Time is purely a product of our consciousness. So, just because those species that are alive today along with us are there, it does not mean those are \"fit\" species, it just means they happen to be with us at this instance and we can only know that because we're conscious.\n\nThe word fit also makes no sense when its applied to us. Who is a fit human being in today's world? How is a fit human being of today different from a fit human being of ten years ago?\n\nNo one is fit, and no one survives, that is a fact.\n\nTime is definitely not a product of consciousness.\n\n\"Fit\" does mean something in evolutionary terms. Those that are better adapted to survival will pass on their genes more often.\n\nThe word survival means not dying, but every living being on this planet dies. So, what is it that survives? The species? Does it really matter to a living being that is dying whether its species survive or not?\n\nThe phrase survival of the fittest is a meaningless phrase. Nothing survives, even whole species are eventually wiped out and that is what the history of this planet tells us. But why have we bought into this whole nonsense of survival ideology? I think the answer is in our inability to accept death. This irrational hope that we're not going to die, even though we know we will die at some point.\n\nAnd also on the flip side, this obsession with survival stops us from living, because we're too afraid not to survive so we forget how to live... the famous phrase that a coward dies a thousand deaths is spot on, because a coward tries to survive.\n\nThere always is a cause for dying. There may be no cause involved in the explanation of survival, but the fact is someone else died because in a generalization he was not Fit in the historical evolutionary sequence. Per disease this is not a fit to die reason, and disease as the determination for definition went from had the generalization only not to die; here the accident even in true life happens against and in spite of the Fact of evolution. Accidents have nothing to do with genetic modification; thus it is a matter to be fit and NOT HAVE THEM. Thus the wording: survival of the fittest. God did not fit into the equation for Darwin. Only was there a God for the observer on the Galapagos Islands.\n\nWhen you say survivors standing, that means a timeline, which is something that is a product of our thinking.\n\nIn other words, just because a certain species is alive and widespread today, it does not mean its a survivor, it simply means, its existent in our time and we are conscious of its existence.\n\nThe word survivor does not make sense if there is no concept of time, because its only time that defines a survivor. In nature there is no time, there is no beginning and there is no end; therefore, there is no state that a species can reach and it can no longer die out -- and those species that are our contemporaries are not survivors, they just happen to be our contemporary.\n\nSo, have the recent replies clarified this for you, or are you still unpersuaded that natural selection/survival of the fittest is an actual thing, and not just our subjective interpretation of the world and how lifeforms change through time?\n\nunclefred said:\n\nNice to see you posting Star.\n\nThanks, unclefred! It's been a while. Good to see you around, too.\n\nWrong again.\n\nNatural selection-The process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. The theory of its action was first fully expounded by Charles Darwin and is now believed to be the main process that brings about evolution.\n\nMy problem with Darwin's theory is, and I'd like if someone actually makes me understand, is that when he says selection and survival - what timeline does he refer to.\n\nIs he talking about \"the now\"?\n\nRight \"now\", as I make this post there are billions of living organism on this planet, are they \"survivors\"?\n\nThe words selection, survival all mean a finite timeline, but the world is not finite, \"right now\" is an idea in our minds, it does not mean anything and when there is no \"right now\", how could there be survivors and selected species etc?\n\nFor example X survived an accident. There is a clear time distinction where there is before and after, \"after\" the accident X is a survivor, because the accident has a precise time, there is before the accident and after the accident. In nature there is no before and after, before and after is our thinking, so shouldn't be more like natural selection based on one species, humans, point of view?"
