        "text": "Individuals have almost no control over being seen or over what they see, hence they are doubly controlled. There are allusions to either or both mass surveillance and mass communication in a number of songs.\n\nThe television viewer as a manipulated voyeur is a theme in several songs. Siouxsie and the Banshees, in \"Monitor,\" express discomfort at seeing a victim who \"looked strangely at the screen.\" Something too personal has been communicated to a mass audience in the comfort of their living rooms. The singers suggest a double meaning in singing about a \"monitor outside for the people inside.\" This could refer to outside leaders watching citizens, or to a TV monitor for citizens outside the system of power to watch and be conditioned by. The monitor offers both a \"prevention of crime, and a passing of time.\" Here we see surveillance as control and entertainment.\n\nFish, in \"The Voyeur,\" deals with predictable themes such as \"private lives up for auction,\" information overload, and living vicariously through the mass media. As in the Peter Sellers film Being There, the individuals persona is formed by reflecting back what he sees on television.\n\nThe song suggests a rarely acknowledged aspect of video --narcissism and exhibitionism. Television permits the narrator to identify with media stars and to fantasize that he too is a celebrity. More generally, negative reactions to video invasions of personal space are very much tempered by the allure of being seen.\n\nI like to watch as my face is reflected in blank TV screens\n\nThe programmes are over, I like to pretend that thats\n\nMe up there making headlines, camera close-ups\n\nCatching my right side I dont care if its only a moment\n\nAs long as its peaktime, just as long as all of\n\nMy friends and family see me, the world\n\nWill know my name come on down.\n\nRather than privacy lost, here we have hey ma look at me."
