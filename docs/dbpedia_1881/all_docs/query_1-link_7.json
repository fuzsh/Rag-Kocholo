        "text": "For our song SWEET by Brockhampton we had to analyse its lyrics in order to better understand the meaning of the song and further gain inspiration in order to be able to recreate the meaning in our music video.\n\nAs we are a group we decided to divide the analysis into 3 parts, in which each person would have to analyse 2 verses. I analysed the first 2 verses of the song, including the chorus. I tried to form my own opinions of the meaning behind the lyrics, however I was also greatly inspired by the annotations found on genius.com and so I added the annotations as well. I also used my knowledge of bands background and as for the group members who were not entirely aware of the groups background they watched youtube videos about the band in order to gain a better understanding. The videos watched were from a playlist on the youtube channel Alfo Media, the channel had an entire playlist on Brockhampton, including a video about each member and so this was a great help for all of us.\n\nThe analysis as a whole was helpful because based on it we were able to discover which lyrics we liked and wanted to include in the music video through lip-syncing, we were able to understand which verses would be easiest to memorise for the characters. For example verses 3 and 4 will most likely be used for lip-syncing as they are not as long as the other verses and are playful and easy to remember as they contain memorable words such as Beyonce and Godzilla, they also don't contain any racial slurs meaning that anyone would be able to rap them.\n\nMy analysis part:\n\nVerse 1 - Matt Champion\n\nStripped down to my skin and my bones\n\nI love huskies but I feel like a wolf (howl!)\n\nIn a pack but I feel all alone\n\nI'm scatterbrained, man\n\nBetter offer the clone\n\nIn Tejas apartments with racist (chronic) doin' weird shit\n\nLike, this'll make your biopic (haha)\n\nRile 'em up, hit Zaxby's get the wing tings (yum)\n\nReal quick bills still stacking to the ceiling (uh-oh)\n\nWhatchu mean, it ain't working? (what?)\n\nWhatchu mean, you ain't finding yourself? (oh, I am, I'm trying)\n\nWhatchu mean, you ain't got no cash? (I got a little bit)\n\nWhatchu mean? Whatchu mean?\n\nShouldn't your pockets be big just like a fat chick? (uh-huh)\n\nShouldn't your mama be done paying the house off? (I guess)\n\nShouldn't you have a real big ass ego? (no)\n\nShouldn't these girls be flockin' just like seagulls? (eh)\n\nMy opinion\n\nThe first verse of the song is rapped by Matt Champion. The song is the 13th song off of the Saturation II album. The band tends to rap a lot about their rise to fame, rapping about their struggles that led to their success. In this verse Matt Champion raps about the loneliness and isolation that comes with success ‘’In a pack but I feel all alone’’ might be referring to the struggles inside of the band as there are many members and there tends to be tensions between large bands.\n\n‘’I love huskies but I feel like a wolf (howl!)\n\nIn a pack but I feel all alone’’\n\nAccording to Genius’s annotations : ‘This simile is likely used to express his savage, yet solitary behavior. While wolves do travel and hunt in packs, they can often be found living alone.Therefore, this may even a subtle hint to “lone wolf”, a term describing someone who prefers to be alone. This parallels to Matt’s life as well. Though he’s with his “pack” or many friends of BROCKHAMPTON, he still feels alone on the inside.’\n\n‘I'm scatterbrained, man\n\nBetter offer the clon’\n\n- 'Clonazepam (shortened to “Clon'” here) is a prescription drug used to control and / or prevent seizures. Matt, being scatterbrained, apparently needs it. Clonazepam is also used as a downer for anxiety. Not only prescribed to prevent seizures. It’s used to prevent panic attacks as well.'\n\n'In Tejas apartments with racist (chronic) doin' weird shit\n\nLike, this'll make your biopic (haha)'\n\n'While it could also be the name for a certain friend of Matt’s, “Tejas” is one of the origin terms the name “Texas” was derived from. Considering that Matt grew up there, it wouldn’t be too farfetched for him to throw a shoutout to his home state.\n\nTejas Apartments is also a literal apartment complex in Taylor, Texas.\n\nIt’s worth noting that places down south like Texas have a notorious history of racism that much of the boyband was raised around.\n\nMatt claiming that he could fit this typically dismissed behavior into an everyday biopic of his life emphasizes how prevalent it is.'\n\n'Rile 'em up, hit Zaxby's get the wing tings (yum)'\n\n'This verse is just referring to Matt gathering all his friends to “hit up” Zaxby’s and get some wings. In the All-American Trash Documentary, there’s a short clip were all of the members go to the restaurant to order chicken wings.'\n\n'Real quick bills still stacking to the ceiling (uh-oh)\n\nWhatchu mean, it ain't working? (what?)\n\nWhatchu mean, you ain't finding yourself? (oh, I am, I'm trying)\n\nWhatchu mean, you ain't got no cash? (I got a little bit)\n\nWhatchu mean? Whatchu mean?\n\nShouldn't your pockets be big just like a fat chick? (uh-huh)\n\nShouldn't your mama be done paying the house off? (I guess)\n\nShouldn't you have a real big ass ego? (no)\n\nShouldn't these girls be flockin' just like seagulls? (eh)'\n\nIn my opinion, this whole verse seems to be referring to their rise to fame and how now the ‘bills still stacking to the ceiling’. However before reaching their fame they were told either by teachers, parents and adults (while growing up) that they should already have a steady and well paying job (‘shouldn’t your pockets be big just like a fat chick?’), they should already know who they are, they should have a ‘big ass ego’ and should be attracting women with their wealth and success. Matt is making fun at these patronizing remarks as while growing up he and his band members might have experienced such questions and were doubted during their process of becoming a successful band, the irony is that while being constantly questioned they still managed to succeed. The process of growing up and finding ones career is very difficult and pre-adults have to deal with questions about their identity, their process, their career and are ridiculed if they are not able to reach their goals, which isn’t possible for everyone because of bias, discrimination and other factors (eg. race, gender, age etc.).\n\nGenius annotations add:\n\n‘Champion asks rhetorical questions, likely impersonating the haters who feel he should fit into a stereotype. Typical rappers today brag about their money, getting women, helping their families, and have “big-ass ego’s”.\n\nIronically enough, Matt has countered all four of these tropes. He wasn’t the richest, as he spent everything he had to purse his music dreams. It’s also taken him a while to repay his mother the debt he thinks she’s owed. He hasn’t had the best history with females either, as they seem to often betray him. Finally, his self-confidence often alternates a lot. In “GOLD”, he raps:\n\n‘I got bipolar confidence\n\nWake up like “shit” then I feel like the shit\n\nSo I guess I’m the shit’\n\nThe higher pitched voice responds negatively, affirming that BROCKHAMPTON isn’t like other musicians. They’re unique and true to the struggles they face.’\n\nChorus - Kevin Abstract\n\nTwistin' me up like licorice\n\nThink I need someone who can handle it\n\nIce on my boys and my wrist is fixed\n\nI don't need nobody tryna give me shit\n\nTwistin' me up like licorice\n\nThink I need someone who can handle it\n\nIce on my boys and my wrist is fixed\n\nI don't need nobody tryna give me shit\n\nTwistin' me up like licorice\n\nThink I need someone who can handle it\n\nGenius annotations:\n\n‘This person is really annoying and stressing Kevin to the point where he feels like this person is “twistin'” him up, similarly to how some varieties of licorice are made. This person cannot deal with Kevin’s unique personality nor can they deal with the rapidly growing fame he is gaining. Because of this, Kevin feels like he needs someone who can handle him and his lifestyle.\n\nThe “licorice” line is most likely where the track title “SWEET” is derived from.’\n\nIce on my boys and my wrist is fixed\n\nI don't need nobody tryna give me shit\n\nGenius annotations: ‘ “Ice” is slang for jewelry. With the amount of money and success the group has gotten this year, Kevin Abstract plans to “ice” out the whole crew, while ensuring that they get no hand-outs in the process.\n\nAt the time of this song’s release, BROCKHAMPTON were unsigned, in part because of their philosophy about independence, as Kevin explained in a July 2017 VICELAND short:\n\nIt’s just knowing where you want to go and not letting anyone get in the way of that, no matter who it is. If it’s an idol, anyone. You just have to protect our own brand. You have so many goals and aspirations, you don’t want to let one little thing throw you off just because it’s a cool person. You don’t want to be distracted by a dollar sign or status.’\n\nIn my opinion Kevin Abstract’s verse is a reference to the songs overall meaning that licorice is sweet in itself, this is referenced by the line ‘twisting me up like licorice’.\n\nI feel like the song is kind of playing on the irony of the idea that licorice is sweet, because most people do not find licorice appealing or even sweet, it’s something that you either hate or love and this could be a metaphor for the band itself. The band at the time of the songs release wasn’t necessarily very known and whoever knew about either loved it or found it too alternative. The song is a play on people’s expectations of them when they were younger (adults bugging them about having a career, money, women etc.) and people’s expectations now about their band. They’re trying to show that they are like licorice, you either love them or hate them (the hate part could also be because of how open and different they are compared to other groups, talking and rapping about racism, sexism, homophobia, drug addictions and so many other controversial topics - they mean to show that they don’t care if people do not agree with them because they know they are different and thats what sets them apart = like licorice).\n\nThe rest of the song ( Analysed by my colleagues )\n\nVerse 2 - Dom McLennon\n\nThe original lick-splickety, higher than Yosemite\n\nBreaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting\n\nMaking 'em say \"Ugh!\", they worshiping our force viciously\n\nWatching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity\n\nOften they say I'm off it, I offer my crossed empathy\n\nThey forgot what we on, I'll remind 'em with hostility\n\nHot-diggity damn, everyone running scams\n\nGotta cover your clams and take another glance\n\nRunning a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans\n\nIt's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect\n\nLap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet\n\nStill gotta figure out exactly where to park it at\n\nMoses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at\n\nBut that's too deep\n\nAnalysis (for Verse 2) by Iasmina Caramidariu\n\nIn his paragraph Dom starts directly with a deeper meaning that makes the audience think and reflect about his words. He is not easy to be deciphered, awaking a specific curiosity and interest from the audience. He is using meaningful words.\n\nDom speaks about breaking the limits with the force of intelligence and seeing beyond the “dust” that comes from the stereotypes that society imposes which doesn't want people to stand out from the crowd by remarking themselves. He is at another level at which he is mastering and having success without following the norms of society, but by being led by his authenticity. Dom makes reference to Master P’s “Make'em Say UGH” song under his label No Limits Records and an actual mastering studio; more specifically, Metropolis Mastering Studio founded in 1993 by Ian Cooper. He is talking about how society disapprove you once you are doing things differently, but this leads to success. At this level the number of the people that are really supporting and care about you is very small, as usually they become jealous and disapproving. But this is not stopping Dom and Brockhampon to mind their music and to carry on at a higher level. Their success came from their nonconformity and courage to build by themselves something that stands out from the normal, they being the “architects” of their own “temple of authenticity”. He is integrating a religious meaning , reference to Moses, who, with God’s power, parted the Red Sea to escape the Egyptian army who was after him, such as Brokehampton “parted” their work from the social norms through deeper meanings and uniqueness. “Each line an ocean I can part it at” refers to double entendres in the lyrics. He can “part” the lines and get two separate meanings from them, in which “too deep” refers to the vastness of the ocean as well as how deep the lyrics are.\n\nVerse 3 - Merlyn Wood\n\nDon't call me stupid, that ain't the way my name pronounced\n\nDon't call me Cupid, I got too many hoes right now\n\nPoolside in Houston\n\nTryna see if Beyoncé will take me for adoption\n\nBroke ass rich, suburbs\n\nA civilian shot in 3rd Ward, we just by the fountain\n\nThis is Merlyn Wood, man\n\nEverywhere I go is the Woodlands\n\nI need a Honey Butter, vodka in a Sprite can\n\nWhen I'm in the Whataburger, all the kids know who I am\n\nI need a Honey Butter, puttin' lean in my Sprite can\n\nAnalysis (for Verse 3)\n\nIn the first verse, Merlyn makes a reference in a subtle way to the racism culture and bullying, as he faced and been through this.\n\nCupid is the Roman god of love. At the moment Merlyn gets so many girls that he is far too preoccupied with lust, never mind something as time consuming as love. This indicates us a bit of superficiality, but in the deepest, we can observe a kind of fear of rejection and suffering. Merlyn tries to stay “hard” at the surface, in order to protect his sensibility and create an appearance.\n\nMerlyn is originally from Hudson, as well as Beyoncé and he’ll gladly move in at Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s, if they’ll have him. This referee at Merlyn's historic as he attended the University of Texas for two years, but because of the pressure from his parents and his low grades decided to drop out, leave his family and join the boy band. So, through this lyric he transmits the fact that he would rather be someone else's child, especially Beyoncé's, as she is also looking good and she is famous- again bringing a note of superficiality. But Merlyn transforms smoothly from his superficial and arrogant attitude to a more sensible and deeper area where he is starting to referee at subjects from the materialistic culture and social-economic welfare to his childhood and in what cruel environment he grew up, full of crimes and sorrow which developed traumas in him, but at the same time this made him stronger.\n\nAgain, Merlyn starts pushing the ease to a more superficial one started talking about his fame and the food from the Whataburger, an American fast food restaurant chain, based in San Antonio, Texas, that specializes in hamburgers.\n\nIt also make reference at his tee nightlife as it is one of the few places open late in The Woodlands ( where he and some more members from Brokehampton made their high school, most of them meet there), making it a popular late night hangout spot.\n\nVerse 4 - Ameer Vann\n\nI got a record but I'm clean as they come\n\nI'm Godzilla, when they see me they run\n\nOn 37th, used to run from the Bloods\n\nThe undercovers gotta duck when they come\n\nI moved out and in a couple of months\n\nI'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug\n\nI used to write raps on the back of the bus\n\nNow I'm in the front seat shifting the gears\n\nAnalysis\n\n'I got a record but I'm clean as they come'\n\nAmeer uses a double entendre of the word record by saying he has a record (album) and criminal record. Saying he’s as clean as they come means he had a clean slate with his criminal record and it also means he’s a clean rapper as he doesn’t swear on this verse.\n\n'I'm Godzilla, when they see me they run'\n\nAmeer is comparing his formidable reputation to the giant monster Godzilla, a Japanese comic book character that was created in 1954 and has been adapted over the years into several movies. Godzilla is deeply embedded in modern day pop culture.\n\nGodzilla is huge, some incarnations as tall as 118.5 metres. The monster is incredibly powerful and feared by everyone. Ameer likens himself to this creature due to his reputation on the streets.\n\n'On 37th, used to run from the Bloods\n\nThe undercovers gotta duck when they come\n\nI moved out and in a couple of months'\n\n37th is most likely referring to a street which Ameer used to frequent. It is unclear what the ‘Bloods’ are, however these 3 lines seems to be referring to the hostile and possibly dangerous life of the ‘ghetto’ and also possibly referring to his life while he was a drug addict and the dangers that came with that life. The lines then continue to be about him leaving that life by moving out and becoming a ‘pop star’.\n\n'I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug'\n\nBROCKHAMPTON brands themselves as a “boy band,” saying they make pop music rather than rap music. This is what Ameer is likely referring to, as they draw many parallels to popular pop band One Direction in their songs.\n\n'I used to write raps on the back of the bus\n\nNow I'm in the front seat shifting the gears'\n\nAmeer started out writing raps in transit, a popular hip-hop theme to illustrate passion for the artist’s craft even under less-than-perfect circumstances (see: 8 Mile). Now, Ameer is the driver of his own car, and, by extension, his own destiny.\n\nAmeer has also rapped about his struggle with racism in his upbringing, and him “sitting on the back of the bus” (like black people in the south during segregation) may refer to him being put down by racism in the past. He says that he’s past that now, and is in control of his life and not subject to the racists that tried to hold him back.\n\nThis could also be a reference to the Saturation IIalbum cover.\n\nHe is also “shifting the gears” by not rhyming the last line with the rest of the verse.\n\nAmeer’s verse is all about the life he used to have and how that led to him becoming successful and how he is now control by being ‘in the front seat shifting the gears’.\n\nVerse 5 - Joba\n\nIt's funny how things can change\n\nThree hundred dollars to my name, led to Hollywood\n\n\"And after high school, you better get a degree\n\n\"'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street\"\n\nFlashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan\n\nListening to NSYNC, saw my name on the CD\n\nBleach blond tips, wanted to be JT\n\nWanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream\n\nOne might say I was doomed from the get-go\n\nBut those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know\n\nWhat it's like to be called to what's not set in stone\n\nI am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know\n\nAnalysis\n\nIt's funny how things can change\n\nThree hundred dollars to my name, led to Hollywood\n\nI was living off Ramen and change\n\nFive hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay\n\nGrowing up my teachers told me\n\n\"You better get them grades up, If you wanna finish high school\"\n\n\"And after high school, you better get a degree\n\n\"'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street\"\n\nJOBA juxtaposes the lavish life he currently lives, with the one that society had set out for him that is: to get ahead in life one must complete high school, get a degree, and get a good job, in that order. He mocks such advice, himself being a testament to succeeding by simply following one’s dreams in a survival of the fittest environment or “dog-eat-dog world.”\n\n'Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan\n\nListening to NSYNC, saw my name on the CD\n\nBleach blond tips, wanted to be JT'\n\nThese 3 lines are talking about a 90s boy band and about how Joba used to fantasize about becoming as successful as NYSNC, even imagining himself as one of the band members.\n\n'Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream\n\nOne might say I was doomed from the get-go\n\nBut those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know'\n\nJoba is talking about how people would doubt his dreams and assume that he wouldn’t make it. These struggles are rapped about throughout the song and other songs in which they talk about expectations from teachers, parents and so on about their futures.\n\n'What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone'\n\nJOBA is discussing his decision to join Brockhampton in California. People pick their career path, and their college with certainty on where it lead them. But JOBA doesn’t know if he will be successful in Brockhampton or if the boy band will even go anywhere.\n\n'I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know'\n\nJOBA accepts the strange ways of fate as they have brought him to success he never could have imagined. He likens its winding path to a river with an “ebb and flow”."
