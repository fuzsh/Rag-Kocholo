        "text": "Eminem has returned with “Survival,” a new non-single that will appear in the upcoming video game “Call Of Duty: Ghosts” as well as on the rapper’s next studio album. “Survival” was released in full on Eminem’s official website on Wednesday afternoon (Aug. 14) and appears in a new trailer for “Call of Duty: Ghosts,” also released on Wednesday.\n\n“Survival” is another snarling epic from the “Not Afraid” rapper, with a hook — “This is survival of the fittest” — very apropos of the ultra-popular military game. In the furious second verse, Em advises his competition, “You better trade your fucking mic’s in for some toolboxes/’Cuz you’ll never take my prize from me, it’ll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nEminem’s highly anticipated follow-up to 2010’s “Recovery” album does not yet have a release date, but according to a press release, “An announcement regarding the new album and its first single is expected soon.” Activision’s “Call of Duty: Ghosts” is due out on various gaming platforms on Nov. 5. “Survival” was officially premiered on Wednesday during a live, multiplayer event for the game that was broadcast worldwide.\n\nLed by “Not Afraid” and “Love The Way You Lie” featuring Rihanna, “Recovery” was the best-selling album of 2010 and was nominated for album of the year at the Grammy Awards. In 2011, Eminem released “Hell: The Sequel,” a full-length collaboration with Royce da 5’9 under the name Bad Meets Evil.\n\nLast Wednesday, Eminem delivered a rare performance at G-Shock’s “Shock the World” 30th anniversary part in New York. He did not perform any new material at the event."
