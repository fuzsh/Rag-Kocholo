        "text": "It was a battle of the bands with animals in their name at the top this week! Wolf Alice just managed to hold on to No.1 as Cage the Elephant made a big concert announcement this week, they are on a \"Spring Fling Rock AF\" tour through the States in March with more animal bands: Bear Hands, Foals and ... Silversun Pickups!?\n\nSubmit your Chart Show ballot this week for a chance to win tickets to Lizzo at First Avenue on Saturday, Feb. 6!\n\nBad Bad Hats are the highest new entry with \"Shame\" while Kerry Alexander of the band is our latest DJ in residence on The Current's all-Minnesota music stream Local Current. Tune in Fridays from noon to 6 p.m. CT in the month of January.\n\nAfter having the No.1 song of the year on our Top 89, Alabama Shakes are back with the title track from their album Sound and Color. Also voted one of the best live acts of the year, the Shakes just announced that they'll be playing Sasquatch, one of the prettiest festivals of the summer.\n\nThe biggest upward mover this week is the seven-piece psychedelic troop from Melbourne, Australia, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, who are also known as an amazing live band. Last September our friends at KEXP had the whole band in to record a studio session.\n\nBeach House, back at No.13, will start their tour this year Down Under in February, returning to the U.S. on March 1 in Chicago.\n\nAs President Obama prepared his final State of the Union address this week he might have asked Kendrick Lamar to give him some advice. In content or presentation!? We might never know, if only \"These Walls\" (at No.14) had ears! Kendrick's posse posed in the White House this week, moving the cover of To Pimp a Butterfly inside the nation's house.\n\nThe lovely ladies of Lucius are sporting sharp new hair styles in the official video for \"Born Again Teen\" (new at No.18), the first single from Good Griefalso love you to record a video for the song featuring you and your friends singing along!"
