        "text": "Word Worship recording artist and songwriter Meredith Andrews is set to release her fourth album, titled Deeper, on February 19. Produced by Jacob Sooter, Jason Ingram, Paul Mabury and Seth Mosley, this is her fourth album with Word Worship and the follow up to 2013’s Worth It All. This multi-Dove Award winning artist continues to utilize her musical artistry to share about God’s never-ending love for each of us. Word Worship will release two versions of Deeper – a standard 11-song version along with a 14-song deluxe edition. Pre-order Deeper on iTunes or Amazon today, and listen to the instant grat songs via Spotify.\n\nJoin us all this week at The Christian Beat as we count down to Meredith’s album release day! Check back each day for new song-by-song stories!\n\nDeeper – Meredith Andrews, Mia Fieldes, Jacob Sooter // 2 Corinthians 4: 8-10 & Rom 5: 3-5\n\n‘Deeper’ is my version of ‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.’ There’s this scene in Terminator 2 where Sarah Connor is institutionalized and she turns her bed on its side and starts doing pull ups, training for the fight she knows is coming. She’s not letting her circumstances stop her or wallowing in bed. Instead, she is making the most of her incarceration by using the time for preparation. I have this picture of God building our muscles to join the fight and be stronger than we were before. Not in our own strength, but in him.\n\nLast fall I was feeling completely overwhelmed by walking through the messiness of our marriage, and adding a third kid to our family. I started experiencing minor panic attacks, which came as a surprise because I always considered myself to be pretty even keeled and go-with-the flow. I found I just couldn’t catch my breath. I felt oppressed and stressed so this song came out of that place, believing that God was strengthening my spiritual muscles.\n\nLamb Of God – Meredith Andrews, Jason Ingram, Andi Rozier // Phil 2: 5-11\n\nIn writing this song, Jason, Andi and I were talking about the meekness of Jesus, and how He responded to broken people. He was never out to prove Himself, but was instead unassuming and humble, meeting people right where they were. This song is highlighting not just the death of Jesus and the process He went through, but His life and the way that He served people, making Himself nothing before taking up the Cross. It’s about the beauty of Jesus’ humility.\n\nSpirit Of The Living God – Jacob Sooter, Mia Fieldes // Matthew 13:16, 1 Corinthians 2:14\n\nI feel like every time I sing this song, the room changes, and I love leading people in worshipping to this song. We changed some things on the production side so this version is a bit different from the live rendition on the Vertical Church Band’s album, which I’m excited about.\n\nExtravagant – Meredith Andrews, Andi Rozier, Jason Ingram // Ps 86:5, Lam 3:22-23, 2 Thess 3, 1 John 3:1\n\nI basically just cried the whole time we wrote this song because Jason started sharing about how he had been recently so moved by the thought of God’s love being so extravagant and lavish. It’s outrageous the way God loves us! How do we capture that in a song? What is a word we could use to try to at least scrape the surface of the love that God has for us? We came up with ‘extravagant’. My favorite part is the bridge “When I needed a Savior you were there. You were there. When I needed a healer you were there. When I needed a father you were there, you were always there.” I sing it a few times and it’s the repetition that just lets the truth sink in and bring healing into your life. Maybe you didn’t have a father who was kind. Maybe you didn’t have a great childhood. Maybe you have a misconstrued idea of God because of the way you were brought up but he has always been a perfect and kind father and his love for you truly is extravagant.\n\nSoar – Meredith Andrews, Seth Mosley, Mia Fieldes // Isaiah 40:31\n\nIn the midst of a difficult season, the Lord put some women in my life to pray me through and hold my arms up in the last year. One friend in particular was talking with me about Joseph. God gave Joseph a vision and dream when he was just a kid but God didn’t fulfill that dream until he was able to carry it and mature enough to handle it. Just imagine what it was like for him being sold into slavery by his own family in a strange land then wrongfully accused even though he was a man of integrity, then thrown into prison for something he didn’t do and spending years there watching other people being released, interpreting their dreams but never seeing his dream come to pass. I’m sure he had many dark days, and I can relate. There were days when I was saying ‘God I can’t.’ But now looking back, I see how that time was so necessary. I think when Joseph walked out of that prison, he carried an authority he didn’t have before because of the time he had spent in the darkness in the prison cell in the presence of God. He knew the voice of God in that desolate place like he hadn’t known before because he didn’t have to know it before.\n\nI’m a big believer in singing the truth over myself and reminding myself of what’s real. Because we get confused by what we see and thinking that’s reality but the greater reality is what we can’t see. And the realty is that God is always with us.”\n\nSunrise – Meredith Andrews, Mia Fieldes, Seth Mosley // Psalm 65:8, Hebrews 12:2, Psalm 16:8, Hebrews 10:23\n\nI wrote this in the dark place believing I would see the sun again and believing there would be a new day and a new season and better and different than before. The bridge is my favorite: “Joy is coming with the morning” repeats over and over again. It’s the anticipation that even though I only see the night and the night feels really long the promise is that joy is coming in the morning. I’m going to sing that all night until the sun comes up. It’s fun to sing.\n\nGlory – Meredith Andrews, Audrey Assad, Bryan Brown // 2 Corinthians 4:17\n\nWe don’t have a clue or glimpse of what the weight of glory is that we’re achieving in walking through hardships – it’s going to blow our minds. This passage was bouncing around in my head and my heart after hearing about the loss of Rick and Kay Warren’s son, Matthew. When we get to heaven and see Jesus – when the Warrens step into glory it’s all going to make sense and they won’t remember their pain anymore. But we have to live with our pain here. It’s not small and it’s not easy and sometimes it feels crippling to the point where we don’t want to get out of bed or even see another day. But if we can only hold onto the hope that we have, the future hope and the glory that’s coming and the kingdom is coming, that will get us through. This song is probably one of my favorites on the record.\n\nImpossible – Meredith Andrews, Paul Duncan, Paul Mabury // Numbers 23:19, Romans 4:21, Luke 18:27, Hebrews 10:23\n\nThis song is inspired by the promise that God cannot fail me. My circumstances may not look like what I think they should, but He’s always going to come through for my good and His glory. This song paints pictures of impossibilities in scripture and how God proved that He’s God of the impossible and He can do impossible things in the Old Testament, New Testament and today.\n\nTrusted – Meredith Andrews, Mia Fieldes, Jason Ingram // Hebrews 10:23, Psalm 136, Philippians 1:16\n\nIf I say ‘God I trust You’ the weight of that might fall more on my trust versus His trustworthiness. So this song points more to ‘God You can be trusted whether I trust You or not. You can be trusted even if the world is crashing in. You can be trusted all the time. Period. Regardless of my faith level, You can always be trusted because You’re faithful and because You do not change.’\n\nTake Me Back – Meredith Andrews, Benji Cowart, Jacob Sooter //Ephesians 2:1-6, Psalm 149:2-3 Luke 15\n\nEach verse in this song describes different walks through life – the second verse is my favorite ‘Take me back to the day I saw you through the eyes of my first child.’ That moment in my own life is when I received a deeper revelation of God’s love for me. For so long I thought I had to prove myself and be the good girl so I’d be God’s favorite. But when I had my first son I thought, ‘I can’t believe how much I love this little person, and I’m not even trying.’ The Lord said ‘That is how I love you. I don’t love you because of what you do; I love you because you’re mine. No matter what you do I love you.’ That was a revolutionary moment for me.\n\nJesus Sees – Meredith Andrews, Jason Ingram // John 1:48, Proverbs 15:3, Hebrews 4:13\n\nThis is a song I would sing over someone. This is a ministry song for the person at their end who has lost true north, lost their hope and feels really alone. It’s the thought that even though you might not feel seen by anyone else, even though you might feel overlooked or forgotten, Jesus sees you. He sees you in your pain, and He meets you in your pain. He understands your pain because He’s carried it, and He’s already taken it upon Himself. In Luke 7 Jesus healed a person in need, but it says that He first saw this person and the word “saw” was intentionally included in the passage because it’s important to how He is with us. Jesus is not passive, He’s not casually glancing our direction. He’s watching us and He sees us and it’s this loving longing gaze and that’s what I want this song to communicate.\n\nHands That Are Holding Me – Meredith Andrews, Hank Bentley, Tyler Miller // 2 Corinthians 4:18 , Isaiah 40:5\n\nThis song is a lifeline song for me in a time period of waiting and trusting God and choosing to believe God’s promises. The chorus declares ‘My eyes will see the glory of the Lord / My ears will hear the mercy in His voice / My hands will hold the hands that are holding me / My feet will walk upon the promised land.’ I love the imagery the chorus provides.\n\nI Look To The King – Meredith Andrews, Matt Maher, Jacob Sooter // Ps 121, 1 Timothy 1:17\n\nJacob and I went to see The Hobbit in the theater when it came out. There is a scene in the movie when the dwarves are doing battle and they’re alone and then a dwarf comes riding in and declares ‘To the king!’ and it was a really epic moment. Jacob immediately had a song idea around the phrase ‘To the king! I look to the king’ which has become a sort of war cry for us. Our eyes are on God, the King Eternal. If we fix our eyes God, we are winning. We had the chorus for a long time and collaborated with Matt Maher to round out the song."
