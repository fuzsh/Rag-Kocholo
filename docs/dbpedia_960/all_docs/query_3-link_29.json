        "text": "Spring Harvest is delighted to announce that over 1,000 people have now booked for Spring Harvest Harrogate taking place this coming April.\n\nThis will be the third year that the event has come to Harrogate. It takes place from 14th to 18th April at the Harrogate Convention Centre, gathering together people from a wide range of church denominations, backgrounds and locations in the north and further-a-field.\n\nIan Macdowell, Head of Spring Harvest Operations, commented: “We are so delighted that we have had a record number of bookings for this event, something that so many in the north are passionate about. Harrogate is so significant because it brings Spring Harvest to the north of England, while also making it far more accessible geographically for people from Ireland and Scotland.”\n\nDay tickets for Harrogate are also now available to purchase, enabling people to experience a whole or part of a day. There are a range of speakers at Harrogate including the Archbishop of York – John Sentamu, Bishop Jill Duff, Bob Hartman, Rachel Gardner, Adrian Plass, Tim Farron, Arianna Walker and Mike Pilavachi.\n\nSpring Harvest is a teaching and worship event for everybody. It’s a unique break for all the family: a holiday, festival, conference and an encounter with God. The programme offers great teaching, worship, youth and a children’s programme every day.\n\nFurther information and bookings can be made online at http://www.springharvest.org/harrogate\n\nIan Mcdowell\n\nNotes\n\nFor further details or information please contact Charlie Price, Head of Sales and Marketing on: charlie.price@essentialchristian.org or call 01825 748892\n\nSpring Harvest aims to create space for all people to encounter God, to be confident in their faith and to see transformation in lives and communities. It’s an event where everyone is valued and cared for, and where the church is supported and resourced. This with the aim that we go ready and able to serve others, at home and around the world, in the name of Jesus.\n\nSpring Harvest operates under the banner of Essential Christian, registered charity number 1126997.\n\nEssential Christian, 14 Horsted Square, Uckfield, TN22 1QG essentialchristian.org 01825 700830\n\nA key songwriter for today’s church, multi-GRAMMY Award® and GMA Dove Award®-winning singer, songwriter, and worship leader MATT REDMAN announces the release of Let There Be Wonder, today January 31, 2020. The highly anticipated album is Redman’s 14th career project and his first with Integrity Music.\n\nRedman shares that whilst preparing for this 12-song collection the theme that shone through so strongly was the name, character, and story of Jesus: “I think there’s a need in our society and in church to absolutely name Him, to not just speak generically about who God is but to put a name on Him and to declare it and to say it – to sing the name of Jesus.”\n\nStarting off with more than 50 songs, along with album producers Jacob Sooter and Joshua Silverberg, Redman dauntingly narrowed it down to the featured dozen. Writing all of the songs, he also collaborated with key writers and friends such as Sooter and Silverberg, Phil Wickham, Hillsong’s Joel Houston, Jason Ingram, Pat Barrett, Corey Voss, Andi Rozier (Vertical Church Band), Jon Guerra, and Brandon Lake, who also appears on the project along with Evan Craft.\n\n“Let There Be Wonder encapsulates a lot of what has been in my heart when it comes to worship in these last few years,” he continues. “Worship songs will never be able to paint the full picture of God’s glory, but it’s so important that we aim high and give our best effort to conveying Him as fully as we can. When we do this, it’s much more honouring to God, and it’s much more helpful for us. My hope and prayer for this new record is that we’d find ourselves caught up in the life-giving worship of the true and living God. Let there be wonder!”\n\nWatch Matt’s Live Video for “We Praise You” here:\n\nCat Rea’s fresh new single blends Lauryn Hill-esque vocals with modern melodies, featuring a breakout rap collaboration and a groundbreaking message of liberation.\n\nCat Rea is a seasoned, captivating performer whose new single “Freedom Reigns” is bound to be a compelling anthem of hope for all who hear it. It’s no cheap collection of maxims and self-help one-liners, but rather the deeply moving cry of a soul that believes, against all odds, that her pain is not in vain. She’s joined by rapper and wordsmith Joshua Luke Smith of “Orphan No More,” and alongside the single is releasing a remix, produced by Influxx.\n\nCat’s Story\n\nOriginally from Middlesbrough, Cat started singing backing vocals for local artists and churches at 12 years old. She grew up around lots of live music, and adored writing and singing from an extremely early age. After finishing music college at 17, Cat started gigging, taking musical inspiration from Whitney Houston, Sia, Lauryn Hill, and Sting.\n\nCat was signed to various dance labels, including a deal with Hedkandi that included an album feature. After that, she worked as a session singer, and over her long career racked up performances at North East Live, gigs with The James Arthur Project, the American Gospel Tour, television adverts and corporate events.\n\nOn top of all this, Cat managed to write, record and release two pop albums. But her favorite performance was a Nashville gospel choir performance for 800 homeless men — a moment that marked her with the drive to bring hope and encouragement to anyone who hears her voice.\n\nThe story of ‘Freedom Reigns’\n\nDuring a brief stint away from music, Cat was hit with depression and moved to Turkey, seeking help with her mental health. There, she fell into an abusive relationship and misused alcohol and drugs. When she was at her very worst, in a suicidal and desperate state, she cried out to God and had a revelation: she didn’t have to live like this.\n\nCat decided then and there to pack her bags and headed back to England, where she looked to re-build her life away from this dark life she had been living.\n\n‘Freedom Reigns’ is out on Friday 31st January 2020 across all streaming platforms\n\nProduced by Jordi Van Dyk, Freedom Reign was written and performed by Cat Rea.\n\nCat Rea is available for Interviews and is now taking bookings for 2020 (subject to availability). Please contact doug.ross@stabal.com\n\nSome of you will know that Marilyn Baker and Tracy Williamson are writing a book about their lives and ministry together. This is an exciting work and we hope will bring much inspiration and hope to those who eventually read it. The deadline for submission is March 6th so please hold them in your prayers as they think what to include and in the writing of it.\n\nIt will be a lovely addition to the book to include people’s comments, stories, testimonies, funny anecdotes etc. It can be a simple one liner, e.g, ‘Marilyn’s songs have brought me deep comfort over the years’, ‘after going to an MBM conference I felt renewed and enabled to take new steps in my walk with the Lord…’ or they can be longer, a few sentences or a few paragraphs or a page or so. It will give the story a lovely authenticity to include these. Tracy will just use your initials unless you specifically tell her you are happy for her to use your name.\n\nPlease can you email your comments, stories, anecdotes etc direct to Tracy tracy@mbm-ministries.org within the next 10 days.\n\nLeading worship leader, recording artist and pastor, William McDowell releases new single “Only You Can Satisfy,” to digital outlets.\n\nThe song, recorded last May at McDowell’s incomparable live recording “THE CRY,” was initially released on a limited-edition physical album released at McDowell’s 2019 Habitation Conference. Now available to all digitally “Only You Can Satisfy,” is an extension of the compelling, and potent worship experience heard on “THE CRY.”\n\nThe Grammy-nominated and Dove Award winning singer-songwriter released “THE CRY,” in September 2019, and it subsequently debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Gospel Chart, marking his fifth No. 1 album. The album continues to impact audiences worldwide.\n\nThe powerful 3-Hour live recording featured a bevy of special guests including Yolanda Adams, Nathaniel Bassey, David & Nicole Binion, Tasha Cobbs Leonard and Travis Greene. This special project musically expresses the deeply miraculous movement of God at McDowell’s church Deeper Fellowship in Orlando, FL.\n\nMcDowell is also preparing for his Deeper Worship Intensive, a comprehensive 4-Day conference for praise and worship leaders, singers, musicians and creatives. Unlike any conference, DWI specifically aims to equip, educate and support creators and carriers of the ‘sound’ of worship.\n\nDeeper Worship Intensive takes place February 29 – February 29 2020 in Orlando,\n\nColton Dixon has unveiled his first new music in nearly three years with “Miracles.” The hopeful, catchy new track was co-written with Michael Jade and the late busbee, who also wrote Dixon’s first No. 1 single, “You Are.” The track, his Atlantic Record’s debut, is also accompanied by a stunning music video.\n\n“‘Miracles’ is a song that has meaning and depth, but it just feels fun musically,” Dixon says. “Some things are more than coincidence. I believe there is a God who loves you and looking out for you. I’m pointing out to others that there’s more to life than meets the eye. I believe miracles happen all around us. I’d like to encourage all of us to slow down a bit, so we can see and appreciate the miracles for what they are.”\n\nColton Dixon quickly became a household name in 2012 when he was voted a fan favorite and made it to the top seven on Season 11 of Fox’s hit show AMERICAN IDOL. His career has been on the fast track ever since, now boasting over 100 million streams across all platforms. Dixon’s 2013 debut, A Messenger, set the record for biggest first-week sales by a new solo Christian act, becoming the No. 1 selling album by a new Christian artist."
