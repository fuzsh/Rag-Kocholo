The gang from Sacramento, CA continues to deliver powerful worship that crosses generations and is meant for the whole church.\"[20] Gerod Bass, in his review of the album at Worship Musician Magazine, says that Living With a Fire \"is pretty much what we've come to expect from Jesus Culture as far as songs and arrangements go.\"[21] Bass resolved that fans will \"love this big collection of new songs. There is nothing ground-breaking here, and it seems as if Jesus Culture has kind of adopted the saying \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"\"[21]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Organization Award Result Ref. 2019 We Love Christian Music Awards The Chorus Award\n\n(Church Worship Album of the Year) Nominated [22] Grammy Awards Best Contemporary Christian Music Album Nominated [2]\n\nCommercial performance\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the United States, Living With a Fire debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Christian Albums chart dated September 15, 2018, having earned sales of 6,000 equivalent album units in its first week.[23] Living With a Fire is Jesus Culture's third album to attain the top position on the chart after Unstoppable Love (2014) and Love Has a Name (2017).[23] The album was also listed as the eighth best-selling digital release in the country that same week,[24] with a placement on the mainstream Billboard 200 chart at No. 134.[25]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nAdapted from AllMusic.[42]\n\nSingers\n\nDerek Johnson – vocals\n\nChris McClarney – vocals\n\nChris Quilala – vocals\n\nBryan Torwalt – vocals\n\nKatie Torwalt – vocals\n\nKim Walker-Smith – vocals\n\nMusicians\n\nJeremy Edwardson – keyboards, programming\n\nAndrew Jackson – keyboards, programming\n\nJeffrey Kunde – keyboards, programming, guitars\n\nIan McIntosh – keyboards, programming\n\nBrandon Aaronson – bass\n\nJosh Fisher – drums\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nBanning Liebscher – executive producer\n\nJeremy Edwardson – producer, engineer, mixing\n\nJeffrey Kunde – additional production\n\nIan McIntosh – additional production\n\nAndrew Jackson – engineer\n\nJamie Beaudoin – assistant engineer\n\nDrew Lavyne – mastering\n\nChristopher York – A&R\n\nMatt Jones – design, packaging\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (2018) Peak\n\nposition UK Christian & Gospel Albums (OCC)[43] 9 US Billboard 200[44] 134 US Christian Albums (Billboard)[45] 1\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Date Format Label Ref.
