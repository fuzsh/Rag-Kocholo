Written by Mark Irwin, Josh Kear, Brad Warren and Brett Warren, the song is McGraw’s 34th No. 1 song and second No. 1 from his Big Machine Records debut, Two Lanes of Freedom.\n\nBig Machine Label Group President and CEO Scott Borchetta welcomed the standing-room only crowd, revealing he had first heard about the song from Swift who told him, “I love it and I’m going to sing on that.” A video was then played for the crowd that offers a look at the evolution of the song, from an idea in the writers’ room to finding its place at the top of the charts. Interviews from the songwriters (including Kear who was out of the country and unable to attend the festivities), Urban and Swift, as well as industry leaders, were featured in the video. Also on hand to celebrate were BMI’s Jody Williams, Sony/ATV’s Troy Tomlinson and producer Byron Gallimore.\n\nMcGraw thanked the industry for the song’s success, including the song’s producer Byron Gallimore. He gave nods to the songwriters, stating, “This town revolves around songwriters,” and calling the tunesmiths “modern day poets.” He told guests this is the kind of song, “you don’t have to think, ‘let me listen to this again’.” Being a big fan of Urban and Swift, McGraw acknowledged how Urban, who was on hand for the celebration, has put a spotlight on Nashville, saying we all owe him a debt of gratitude. Regarding Swift’s performance of the song, McGraw confessed, “It was a big deal for her to sing on this song,” and called her a “spectacular songwriter.”\n\nSongwriter Irwin celebrated his second No. 1 (his first being “Here In The Real World” released by Alan Jackson in 1990). Referring to Kear, Irwin said, “A songwriter couldn’t ask for a better co-writer.” He called being in the same writing room with the Warren brothers “inspirational.”\n\nCelebrating their third No. 1, Brad and Brett Warren took the stage and as usual, quickly stole the show, garnering laughs from the packed room of friends, industry and press; but even among the quips, it was evident Brett and Brad were sincerely grateful and humbled by the song’s success.\n\nLucky attendees didn’t leave empty handed. Everyone received McGraw’s Two Lanes of Freedom, Accelerated Deluxe vinyl edition as they left the festivities.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/10184735/urbanmcgraw.jpg 682 1000 Sherod Robertson https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Sherod Robertson2013-08-21 15:08:182013-08-21 15:08:18Tim McGraw Celebrates 34th No. 1 Song\n\nNo. 1 Celebration: Brad Paisley's \"Beat This Summer\"\n\n/\n\nSongwriters Brad Paisley, Chris DuBois and Luke Laird were feted with a No. 1 celebration at the Country Music Association’s offices yesterday (Aug. 20) for the chart-topping success of “Beat This Summer,” recorded by Paisley. Jody Williams honored BMI songwriter Laird, BMI’s reigning Country Songwriter of the Year. ASCAP’S LeAnn Phelan honored Paisley, ASCAP’s 2011 Artist/Songwriter of the Year and DuBois, ASCAP’s 2004 Country Songwriter of the Year, for their part in the chart-topping summertime anthem.\n\nMeanwhile, Sea Gayle Music’s Marc Driskill announced that the company would be making a donation to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in honor of Sea Gayle writers Paisley and DuBois. Avenue Bank’s Ron Cox also announced that Avenue Bank would make a charitable contribution to Preston Taylor Ministries on behalf of all the songwriters.\n\nIt is the first No. 1 song for independent publishing company Creative Nation, founded by Laird and his wife Beth Laird. “I could not be more proud of Luke and Beth and the company that they are building,” said BMI’s Jody Williams. Beth Laird previously served as Director of Writer/Publisher Relations at BMI. Luke Laird’s parents traveled from Pennsylvania to be in the audience.\n\n“I never thought I would marry a musician or start my own company but it has turned out to be the best thing,” said Beth Laird. “Jody was the first person to say ‘You should go do this.’ There is no way I could run a publishing company without his mentorship.” She also spoke of husband and Creative Nation co-owner Luke Laird. “I learn so much from you everyday,” she said. “You are the most caring man and I’m glad you trusted me with your songs and talent.” Creative Nation eschewed the trophies and plaques traditionally given to honor the songwriters, instead giving Ray Ban Wayfarers to writers and executives involved in the song’s success (in a nod to “Beat This Summer”‘s reference to the sunglasses).\n\nThe song marked the first co-write between Paisley and Laird; Laird recalled first seeing Paisley in the late ’90s, when Laird was a college student volunteering during Country Radio Seminar and Paisley was just releasing his first single. Laird also thanked many in the industry for their support of Creative Nation. “Nashville has such a family feel and so many people have been so supportive of it,” he said. “I had nothing to do with the bridge of the song, and it’s my favorite part of the song.” Turning to his co-writers, he said, “Thank you for writing the Wayfarer line so we can give Wayfarers out to people.”\n\n“This was the first tune that Luke and I wrote together,” said Paisley. “It was asking a lot to have a writer come into what feels like a frat house, where everybody knows everyone’s dark secrets,” he quipped. “You are one of the most talented writers I have sat in a room with,” Paisley told Laird.\n\nPartygoers partook in a lunch of chicken, chips and bread, along with Sweet Cece’s frozen yogurt–welcome summer treats on warm Nashville summer day.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/10184735/brad-paisley-no11111.jpg 299 570 Jessica Nicholson https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Jessica Nicholson2013-08-21 14:19:582013-08-21 14:19:58No. 1 Celebration: Brad Paisley's \"Beat This Summer\"\n\nHaun, Tomlin, Redman Lead 44th Annual Dove Awards Nominations\n\n/\n\nProducer/songwriter Wayne Haun leads the 44th Annual Dove Awards nominations with 15 nods; artists Chris Tomlin and Matt Redman are nominated for nine awards each.\n\nThe awards nominations were announced Wednesday morning (Aug. 21) at Nashville’s Lipscomb University.

The singer-songwriter’s latest album, Crash My Party, exceeded sales expectations in its debut week, selling 527,783 units and bowing at the pinnacle of the Nielsen Soundscan Top 200 rankings. Party gives Bryan the biggest sales debut for a Country male artist since 2004.\n\nThis makes Bryan and Taylor Swift the only two country artists who have sold more than a half-million copies of an album in a single week since 2008. This is Bryan’s second consecutive Top 200 No. 1 album.\n\n“I’ve never been this excited about an album that I have put out, and the response I have gotten is really humbling and mind-blowing to me,” says Bryan. “I am lucky to have some of the best fans in the world, and I am happy to see them enjoying this album as much as I do. I’m just so thankful for my fans and for Country radio for the amazing support.”\n\nBryan’s sales have earned him top billing on several sales charts this week.

I recently took a long road trip, listening to radio stations all the way. And I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times a record excited me enough to make me turn up the volume. I have long suspected that the people in Nashville who make country records don’t even listen to their own creations. Now I’m just about certain of it.\n\nThat said, there are some bright highlights in this week’s stack of platters. Jimmy Buffett & Toby Keith, The Band Perry and Randy Travis all have excellent new music. So does the Zac Brown Band, which takes home the Disc of the Day award.\n\nThe newcomers today are Cole Swindell, Angie Johnson, Maggie Sajak and our DisCovery Award winners, American Young.\n\nLUKE BRYAN/That’s My Kind of Night\n\nWriters: Ashley Gorley/Dallas Davidson/Chris DeStefano; Producer: Jeff Stevens; Publishers: Songs of Southside Independent/Out of the Taperoom/External Combustion/EMI Blackwood/Two Chord Georgia/EMI April/Sugar Glider, ASCAP/BMI; Capitol Nashville\n\n-Typical contemporary “country,” which is to say banjo slapped on top of a rock-music track with lyrics about partying and a vague hip-hop vibe.\n\nRANDY TRAVIS/Tonight I’m Playin’ Possum\n\nWriters: Keith Gattis; Producer: Kyle Lehning; Publishers: Sony/ATV Tree/Pioneer Town/BMI; Warner Bros.\n\n-Randy is facing a long recovery right now. While we await his comeback, here is an excellent tribute to the late, great George Jones to warm our country hearts. Needless to say, it is country to the core.\n\nJIMMY BUFFETT & TOBY KEITH/Too Drunk To Karaoke\n\nWriters: none listed; Producer: none listed; Publishers: International Dog/Big Yellow Dog/Scamporee/Hammer Arm/Coral Reefer/All About the Music, BMI; Mailboat\n\n-He signs up to sing in the bar, but by the time they call his name, he’s blotto. These two sound like they’re having a ball with this hilarious, super bouncy, sing-along ditty. A single with a built-in smile. Essential.\n\nANGIE JOHNSON/Swagger\n\nWriters: Angie Johnson/Josh Leo/Phoenix Mendoza; Producer: Josh Leo; Publishers: Sony-ATV Tree/I Can’t Stand Your Music/Keeping Music Alive/Cool Vibe, BMI; Sony (track)\n\n-It’s a shouted rocker with quasi-metal electric guitar and programmed electronic effects. Catchy, rhythmic and pleasing, but not exactly drawing on any country musical tradition that I am aware of.\n\nTHE BAND PERRY/Don’t Let Me Be Lonely\n\nWriters: Sarah Buxton/Rodney Clawson/Chris Tompkins; Producer: Dann Huff; Publishers: Big Red Toe/Box Tone/Amarillo Sky/Big Loud Songs/Play Animal/Big Loud Bucks, BMI/ASCAP; Republic Nashville\n\n-Marvelously melodic. It begins softly, then adopts a steadily rocking groove and nice vocal interplay among the three siblings. The audio dynamics ebb and crest throughout the production, which keeps you fully involved. One of this group’s finest efforts to date.\n\nAMERICAN YOUNG/Love Is War\n\nWriters: Billy Montana/Kyle Sackley/Jonathan Singleton; Producers: Jon Stone, Justin Niebank & Lee Brice; Publishers: Mike Curb/Dandon Ranch/BMG Platinum/Jam Writers/Sheila Be Right/BMG Gold/We Jam Writers/Glassbean, BMI/ASCAP; Curb\n\n-This male-female duo has a distinctive folky style that features unusual vocal harmony work and spare, striking instrumental accompaniment. The song is a dandy, too. Highly inventive and very, very good.\n\nZAC BROWN BAND/Sweet Annie\n\nWriters: Zac Brown/Wyatt Durrette/Coy Bowles/Sonia Leigh/John Pierce; Producers: Keith Stegall & Zac Brown; Publishers: Weimerhound/Lil’ Dub/Angelika/Southern Ground/Maudlow, BMI/ASCAP; Southern Ground/Atlantic (track)\n\n-It seems like whenever I get so bored with this format that I could scream, these guys come along to refresh my faith. This lilting ode to a wronged sweetheart is drenched with the group’s matchless vocal harmony and laced with delicious dobro notes. Heavenly.\n\nMAGGIE SAJAK/Wild Boy\n\nWriters: Aimee Mayo/Chris Lindsey/Caitlyn Smith/Troy Verges; Producer: Josh Leo; Publishers: Little Blue Typewriter/BPJ Administration/BMG Gold/Little Vampire/Music of Stage Three/Songs of Cornman/BMG Chrysalis/Songs of Universal/Songs From the Engine Room, ASCAP/BMI; MS\n\n-She has a coy, sexy vocal style. The track has a nice thump. The upbeat song describes a heartbreaker boyfriend imaginatively. I like the whole audio package.\n\nKELLIE PICKLER/Little Bit Gypsy\n\nWriters: Kyle Jacobs/Tammy Kidd Hutton/Fred Wilhelm; Producers: Frank Liddell & Luke Wooten; Publishers: Curb/Jacobsong/Mike Curb/Float/Meaux Mercy/Capitol CMG, ASCAP/BMI; Black River\n\n-I am such a major fan of this gal. This time around, she’s bopping along merrily as a wandering free spirit. Frothy and light and buoyant and oh-so listenable.\n\nCOLE SWINDELL/Chillin’ It\n\nWriters: Cole Swindell/Shane Minor; Producer: Jody Stevens; Publishers: Sony-ATV Tree/Code Six Charles, BMI; Warner Bros.\n\n-Same old, same old. They’re cruising on a backwoods road, listening to country radio and lolling around romantically.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/10184736/zbb-featured111.jpg 259 390 Robert K Oermann https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Robert K Oermann2013-08-21 09:53:232013-08-21 09:53:23DISClaimer: Does Nashville Listen To Its Own Music?\n\nDollywood Preparing For $300 Million Upgrade\n\n/\n\nDolly Parton‘s Pigeon Forge, Tenn. themepark Dollywood is about to super-size its entertainment offerings. Dolly Parton told Today in an interview that a 10-year, $300 million expansion project is in the works for Dollywood. For 2014, those plans include the Fire Chaser Express roller coaster, with a resort hotel to follow in 2015.\n\nAn announcement was live streamed at 9:45 a.m. CT, revealing more details about the expansion.\n\n“It’s gonna be a big deal,” Parton told TODAY. “And I’m so excited…this has been a dream from the very beginning. It’s got a Southern flair, but it’s done very classy.”\n\nIn 2015, the Dream More Resort will open, a 300-room world class resort located on 100 acres of land within walking distance of the Dollywood Splash Country Water Adventure Park. “When you stay at a hotel you sleep and when you sleep, you dream more,” Parton explained of the resort’s name during the announcement. Some rooms will be able to accommodate up to six people. The resort will feature a fishing pond and fire pits, indoor and outdoor pools, a full-service restaurant, a gym facility, porches with swings and hammocks, an intimate outdoor theatre and a spa and salon.\n\nShe is also creating a Sweet Dream Celebrity Suite, a place for people to stay–but only when Dolly is not taking up residence in the suite.\n\nThe Fire Chaser Express roller coaster is a first forward and backward family roller coaster for the park. It will be outfitted for young children to ride, including those as young as 4-years-old. “Little bitty kids will be able to say they had their first roller coaster ride here at Dollywood,” said Parton.\n\nAs usual, Parton has many other projects she is working on. She announced that she just finished a new CD and that she has tour dates in Europe, Australia and the United States on the books. She is also partnering to roll out her Imagination Library in Australia. Later this week, Parton will begin filming her part in a Lifetime Christmas film at the themepark. “I have a lot of acting to do and I’ve written music for the show,” says Parton.\n\nDollywood will introduce a new Christmas show this season, with Parton to be featured as a hologram as part of the production. “I get to be a ghost,” said Parton. “I am the ghost of Christmas past. It’s like being there in spirit, but not in person.”\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/10191942/dolly-1.jpg 299 250 Jessica Nicholson https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Jessica Nicholson2013-08-21 09:05:562013-08-21 09:05:56Dollywood Preparing For $300 Million Upgrade"
