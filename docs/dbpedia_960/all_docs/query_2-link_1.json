Every single one of us is His favorite.\"[16]\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an interview with People, Lake mentioned that the album will contains R&B, Christian country, rock, and pop sounds.[17] Lindsay Williams of K-Love described the album as \"leaning into a variety of sonic influences to create more of a boundary-pushing CCM pop project than a straightforward modern worship album.\"[18] Williams noted that Lake \"borrows powerful symbolism from the biblical story of Joseph for the title-cut and opening track, the pit-to-palace narrative isn't woven throughout the entire set.\"[18] AllMusic described the album as \"set of modern praise & worship songs\" with lyrical content exploring themes of \"themes of faith, family, and overcoming life's struggles.\"[19] Jasmin Patterson of NewReleaseToday described the album's listening experience as \"a singer-songwriter, pop, and R&B album,\" with Lake's vocal delivery being reminiscent of Ben Rector and Coldplay.[20]\n\nArtwork\n\n[edit]\n\nThe album cover shows Lake wear his own \"coat of many colors\" while standing in water, drawing inspiration from the idea of taking \"rags\" and turning them into \"riches.\"[1] The coat was designed by Greg Lauren, the nephew of fashion designer Ralph Lauren.[21]\n\nRelease and promotion\n\n[edit]\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Praise You Anywhere\" was released as the lead single from the album, along with its accompanying music video, on June 9, 2023.[22] \"Praise You Anywhere\" peaked at number one on the Hot Christian Songs chart.[4]\n\n\"Count 'Em\" was released as the second single from the album, along with its accompanying music video, on August 4, 2023.[23] \"Count 'Em\" peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart.[4]\n\nPromotional singles\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Coat of Many Colors\" was released as the first promotional single from the album, along with its accompanying music video, on September 8, 2023.[24] The title track peaked at number 20 on the Hot Christian Songs chart.[4]\n\n\"Tear Off the Roof\" was released as the second promotional single from the album, along with its accompanying music video, which features the cast and characters of The Chosen, on October 6, 2023.[25] \"Tear Off the Roof\" peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart.[4]\n\nOther songs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe official music video for \"Kids\" was released via YouTube on November 14, 2023.[26]\n\nThe official music video for \"More\" featuring Benjamin William Hastings and Leeland, was released through YouTube on December 15, 2023.[27]\n\nPerformances\n\n[edit]\n\nBrandon Lake performed an acoustic take of \"Coat of Many Colors\" on the Grammy's Positive Vibes Only web series on October 23, 2023.[28]\n\nTouring\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 31, 2023, Lake announced that he will embark on the Coat of Many Colors Tour in support of the album.

He crafts a distinctive prayer that feels innate to Lake's own relationship with God.\"[34] Reviewing for Jesus Freak Hideout, Matthew Spiker concluded: \"Overall, I found the music and lyrical output of Brandon Lake's Coat Of Many Colors to be exquisite, even if none of the songs reach the level of excellence that 'Gratitude' hit on his last album. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for Brandon.\"[32] Timothy Yap of JubileeCast commended Lake for \"his ardent search for scripture to impart fresh and exciting truths in his songs,\" in his review of the album, while bemoaning the number of songs included saying \"Instead of stuffing the album with C-graded songs, it may have been better to hone the album down to 10 carefully crafted tracks. Less is more.\"[33] Lindsay Williams in her K-Love review concluded: \"Despite the challenge of following up a once-in-a-lifetime smash like 'Gratitude,' 'Coat of Many Colors' makes it clear the multifaceted artist is far from a one-hit wonder and has plenty of surprises up his sleeve.\"[18] In a NewReleaseToday review, Jasmin Patterson wrote a positive review of the album, saying \"Coat of Many Colors is a testament to how Brandon Lake skillfully walks in the balance of worship leader and artist. At the same time, He can lead God's people into passionate praise and prayerful conversation with God, and he's not afraid to play in all the various sonic spaces that different genres provide.\"[20]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nYear-end lists Publication Accolade Rank Ref.
