I’ve enjoyed his music ever since. This collection of songs, that were mostly written during the pandemic, celebrate friendship with God and other people.

Each EP will feature three songs – a new song, a live version of a song that Maher has written for other artists but hasn’t recorded himself, and a live version of some of Maher’s previous songs. Here are a few comments on each song on Vol. 1.\n\nRun to the Father – This song was written by Maher with Cody Carnes and Ran Jackson and produced by Bernie Herms. The powerful song of surrender features piano, strings, drums, and backing choir vocals.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nI run to the Father, I fall into grace\n\nI’m done with the hiding, no reason to wait\n\nMy heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend\n\nSo, I’ll run to the Father, again and again\n\nLord, I Need You (Señor, Te Necesito) – This is a live version of Maher’s worship song “Lord, I Need You”, which Maher recorded with Bianca, who sings in Spanish.

The voices of Maher and Bianca blend well.\n\nWhite Flag – This is a live version of a song that Chris Tomlin originally recorded at the Passion Conference. Maher wrote the song with Tomlin, Jason Ingram and Matt Redman. The song features synth, drums, guitar, bass and the audience singing along.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nWe raise our white flag\n\nWe surrender all to you, all for you\n\nWe raise our white flag, the war is over\n\nLove has come, your love has won\n\nClick on ‘Continue reading’ for:\n\nReviews of Alive & Breathing, Volumes 2-4 by Matt Maher\n\nMusic News\n\nSong of the Week Lyrics\n\nContinue reading →\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n1 Comment\n\nNew and Upcoming Music I’m Excited About….and You May Be Too\n\nAs we settle into 2020, there are a number of new and upcoming albums, in a variety of genres, that I’m excited about, and you may be as well.

The new album was produced by Jacob Sooter and Joshua Silverberg, and was recorded live in front of more than 1,000 people at a California church.

Barnum, featuring excellent new songs by the Oscar winning lyricists from La La Land. The film includes eleven new songs written by Oscar (La La Land) and Tony (Dear Evan Hansen) Award winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.\n\nBelow are a few comments on each song:\n\nThe Greatest Show – The film opens with the title song performed in a big song and dance production number. Jackman, with his Broadway experience, is excellent in his portrayal of Barnum. He is joined on this song by Zac Efron, Zendaya and Keala Settle.\n\nA Million Dreams – This song is initially sung by Ziv Zaifman as a young Barnum and then shifts to the adult Barnum with Jackman and Michelle Williams singing. In the film, the song is sung as we see a flashback in which Barnum, a young and impoverished tailor’s son, played by Ellis Rubin, first meets the privileged but sweet Charity, played by Skylar Dunn. We see them fall in love, but Charity’s father tells P.T. to stay away from his daughter, who is then sent away to a boarding school. But we see them stay in touch through letters. The film moves forward a dozen or so years, with Jackman portraying Barnum and Michelle Williams portraying his now wife Charity.\n\nA Million Dreams (Reprise) – This short song is sung by Barnum’s daughters Caroline (Austyn Johnson) and Helen (Caroline Barnum) and Jackman.\n\nCome Alive – This upbeat song is sung by Jackman, Keala Settle, Zendaya, Daniel Everidge.\n\nThe Other Side – In this song Jackman as Barnum convinces the socialite playwright Phillip Carlyle, played by Zac Efron to become his business partner.\n\nNever Enough – This powerful song is performed in the film by Jenny Lind “The Swedish Nightingale”, the best singer in the world. While Lind is played in the film by Rebecca Ferguson, her singing is actually performed by Loren Allred.\n\nThis is Me – This powerful song has received an Oscar nomination. It is performed by Tony nominee Keala Settle, who plays the bearded lady in the film.\n\nRewrite the Stars – This song is performed by Zac Efron and Zendaya. If you’ve seen the film, you’ll remember their powerful scene in the circus ring about their love that has so many obstacles.\n\nTightrope – This beautiful song is sung by Michelle Williams as Barnum’s wife as she sings that she risks it all to be with Barnum and the life they’ve chosen.\n\nNever Enough (Reprise) – This is a short reprise of Loren Allred’s powerful rendition of “Never Enough”\n\nFrom Now On – This song starts slowly with Jackman’s vocal over piano and builds powerfully as the celebratory closing song of the film.\n\nI’m not usually a fan of movie musicals, but I really enjoyed The Greatest Showman. It is a film that the entire family can enjoy. If you’ve seen the film, you’re most likely going to want to check out the movie soundtrack.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n1 Comment\n\nMUSIC REVIEWS and NEWS\n\nBest of Fernando Ortega: Live in St. Paul\n\n****\n\nI was introduced to Fernando Ortega years ago when he opened for Michael Card. He has since become one of my favorite artists. This concert recording was originally available only as a DVD, but is now fortunately also available as an audio recording. Including 19 songs, this concert was recorded in 2004 at Northwestern College’s Maranatha Hall as Fernando was on tour supporting his 2004 album Fernando Ortega. He plays 7 of that album’s 12 songs here, including the touching and humorous “Mildred Madalyn Johnson”. The recording features Ortega and band, including an accordion, but the focus is on Ortega’s gentle vocals over his piano.\n\nIf you’ve seen Ortega in concert you know that one of the best things is often times humorous introductions to his songs, which are not included here, the focus being solely on the music. In addition to the songs from Fernando Ortega, he includes many of his most-loved songs, such as “Creation Song”, “Lord of Eternity”, “Children of the Living God”, “This Good Day”, “Sing to Jesus” and “Our Great God”. This is Ortega’s only live album and it’s a gem.\n\nFlowers in the Dirt (Special Edition) – Paul McCartney\n\n****\n\nThis 2-CD “Special Edition” (the release comes in a number of different configurations), of McCartney’s excellent 1989 album Flowers in the Dirt features a remastered version of the original 13-song album (plus Où Est Le Soleil?, which wasn’t on the original album), on one disc, and nine previously unreleased demos McCartney recorded with Elvis Costello on the second disc. The demos are what really got my attention on this release, the 10th installment of McCartney’s Archive Collection, all of which have been personally supervised by McCartney. This album has special significance for me as well. It was the album McCartney toured on for his 1989-90 World Tour, on which I saw three of the shows, the first of now twelve concerts I’ve seen of the former Beatle.\n\nListeners will be pleased with the remastered version of the original album. It features such strong songs as “My Brave Face” (his last Billboard solo Top 40 hit), “This One”, “Put it There” and the 89-90 World Tour opener “Figure of Eight”. The original demos with Costello are: Continue reading →\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLeave a comment\n\nMY MUSIC REVIEWS and NEWS\n\nMusic Review: The Best of The Cutting Edge 1965 – 1966: The Bootleg Series Vol. 12 by Bob Dylan.\n\n****\n\nIn 1991 Bob Dylan released the first three volumes of The Bootleg Series, most of which I have in my collection. The Cutting Edge is the twelfth volume in the well-done series. It includes alternate versions, outtakes and some studio banter from an incredible fourteen month creative stretch from January 1965 to March 1966, when Dylan moved from folk to electric and recorded three extraordinary albums Bringing it All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and the double album Blonde on Blonde with producers Tom Wilson and Bob Johnston.\n\nThere are three configurations of The Cutting Edge that have been released. The Best of The Cutting Edge is a two-disc, thirty-six track collection. There are also six and a massive eighteen disc versions available.\n\nThe production of these songs from fifty some years ago is amazingly clear. I loved hearing the organ coming through so clearly. We get an inside look into Dylan’s creative process during this period. Longtime Dylan fans will easily discern these versions from original album versions we have been familiar with all these years. Arrangements vary, such as up-tempo versions of “Visions of Johanna” and “It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry (Take 8, Alternate Take)” or a very different take of “Just Like a Woman”. At times the lyrics differ from the original album version such as the rocking “Tombstone Blues Take 1”. This doesn’t surprise, as those of us who have seen him in concert several times know he often changes up the lyrics to songs.\n\nMany of the songs will be very familiar to Dylan fans – “Like a Rolling Stone”, “Hey Mr. Tambourine Man” (which ends abruptly with Dylan complaining about the drums), “Highway 61”, “Positively 4th Street” and “I Want You”, while others will be less known – “She’s Your Lover Now” and “Can You Please Crawl Out of Your Window?”.\n\nI can’t tell you how much I enjoyed this release, giving us glimpses into the genius of Dylan during arguably his most creative period. As a result, this is my favorite volume in The Bootleg Series. This version also comes with a 60-page booklet, with photos and liner notes. Highly recommended for all Dylan fans.\n\nArtists and Poets: Lecrae. Lecrae inspires us all to see the magic inside a personal story put to poetry and a poem put to song.\n\nWow to the Deadness. Check out this new song by Steve Taylor and the Danielson Foil. Read about their Kickstarter campaign.\n\n“Hellurrrr!!!” Adele may have a worldwide hit with “Hello”, but Madea knocks it out of the park with her version.\n\nRestored “Hey Jude” Video. Hey Jude topped the charts in Britain for two weeks and for 9 weeks in America, where it became The Beatles longest-running No.1 in the US singles chart as well as the single with the longest running time. This video was first broadcast on David Frost’s Frost On Sunday show, four days after it was filmed. To help with the filming an audience of around 300 local people, as well as some of the fans that gathered regularly outside Abbey Road Studios were brought in for the song’s finale. I remember watching it as a 12 year-old Beatles fan when it was first aired in America a month later on 6 October 6, 1968 on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nHymns in the Spotlight. Laura McClellan writes “Season 9 of the popular NBC vocal competition show The Voice (which concluded on December 15) brought several young artists into the spotlight with one thing in common: their faith in Christ. Roberts, pop hopeful Jordan Smith, and youthful crooner Braiden Sunshine each chose to use their moment on national television to exalt Christ in a bold way—singing hymns.”\n\nFavorite Music Quotes of the Week:\n\nChange begins at the end of your comfort zone.

It was included on Maher’s album Saints and Sinners and Redman’s album Unbroken Praise.\n\nYou can listen to their respective versions here:\n\nMatt Maher\n\nMatt Redman\n\nI have a home, eternal home\n\nBut for now I walk this broken world\n\nYou walked it first, You know our pain\n\nBut You show hope can rise again up from the grave\n\nAbide with me, abide with me\n\nDon’t let me fall, and don’t let go\n\nWalk with me and never leave\n\nEver close, God abide with me\n\nThere in the night, Gethsemane\n\nBefore the cross, before the nails\n\nOverwhelmed, alone You prayed\n\nYou met us in our suffering and bore our shame\n\nAbide with me, abide with me\n\nDon’t let me fall, and don’t let go\n\nWalk with me and never leave\n\nEver close, God abide with me\n\nOh love that will not ever let me go\n\nLove that will not ever let me go\n\nYou never let me go\n\nLove that will not ever let me go\n\nOh You never let us go\n\nAnd up ahead, eternity\n\nWe’ll weep no more, we’ll sing for joy, abide with me\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
