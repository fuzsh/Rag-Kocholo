Do you get involved in life, helping others, changing your attitude if necessary, and not giving up if you feel defeated in life with its hurdles and problems? The Apostle Paul, in another of his letters in the Bible, put it like this: â€œI press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus&rdquo;. Find chord charts and vocal sheets for the congregation or worship choir on the theme of running."
