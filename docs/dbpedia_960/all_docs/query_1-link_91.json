        "text": "The 49th Annual GMA Dove Awards were held Oct. 16 at Lipscomb University in Nashville. Although the show is over, fans will still get to see it on Oct. 21 on TBN.\n\nDuring the evening, Tauren Wells won big with a total of four awards, including New Artist of the Year. Wells was shocked when his name was announced as the recipient of that award and he was definitely caught off guard.\n\n“I was literally in the back with my pants undone changing,” he said. Then I heard my name and ran. ‘What award is this? New Artist of the Year?’ I am so thankful for this privilege. Thank you!”\n\nCory Asbury and songwriter Colby Wedgeworth also won big, each snagging three awards. Asbury co-wrote “Reckless Love,” the song that took home the prestigious Song of the Year award.\n\n“What a privilege this is. Isn’t it just like the Lord to take our failures and our overall jacked-up mess and turn it into something beautiful,” Asbury said. “He takes our disappointments and turns them into a dance floor. He allows us to be kids again.”\n\nSee some of the winners from the 49th Annual GMA Dove Awards below and tune in on Oct. 21 on TBN to see the show.
