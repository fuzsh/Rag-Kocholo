The total area may be set down at 592 square miles, of which 385,342 acres are taxed on a valuation of $1,621,505; 2,902 town lots are assessed $366,705, and personal property assessed $1,403,875. Mount Vernon, the county seat, is 1,420 feet above the level of St. Louis, but the average elevation of the Ozark Range in this county may be placed at 1,279 feet, the level of Verona. The county is not flat and marshy, or swampy, but admirably located between these two extremes, so as to be sufficiently elevated to give pure mountain air without the extreme cold to which mountain regions are sometimes subject. The country is rolling enough to give a good natural drain, which prevents the collection of water into stagnant pools, and it can be said that within the boundaries of the county there is not a swamp or marsh worthy of the name, yet there are a few spots of a few yards in extent which might properly be denominated marshes, but these will in the near future be drained with a small outlay of labor.\n\nPopulation--In 1840 Barry County, then including more than half of Lawrence, all of Jasper, Barton and McDonald and part of Vernon, had a population of only 4,795, and it is probable that the territory out of which Lawrence was formed did not contain a population of over 500 souls in 1840. The population of the county within its present boundaries in 1850 was 4,859. The population of Lawrence by minor subdivisions in 1880\n\nPage 2\n\nwas: Aurora Township, 1,181; Buck Prairie Township, 1,338; Greene Township, 1,359; Lincoln Township, 1,086; Mount Pleasant Township, 1,040; Mount Vernon Township, 2,999; Ozark Township, 1,644; Peirce Township and City, 2,383; Peirce City, 1,350; Spring River Township, 1,463; Turnback Township, 1,321; Vineyard Township, 1,769. The white population of Lawrence County in 1880 was 17,273; in 1870, 12,808, and in 1860, 8,559, together with 287 colored persons in 1860, 259 in 1870 and 299 in 1880. In the native and foreign statistics the total population is placed at 16,820, made up of 9,689 Missourians, 1,049 natives of Illinois, 919 of Kentucky, 462 of Ohio, 1,488 of Tennessee, 654 of Indiana and 763 of all other States. There were 175 Irish, 215 Germans, 43 Canadians, 59 English and Welsh, 8 Scotch, 17 French and 149 Swedes and Norwegians. The sex statistics give a total of 17,583, made up of 8,982 males and 8,601 females, of whom 3,071 males and 2,941 females are between the ages of five and seventeen years, 3,312 between eighteen and forty-four years, and 3,894 over twenty-one years.\n\nPrairies.--The term is bestowed on treeless tracts of land. Years ago, when the first settlers made their homes here, the prairie area was much larger than to-day, but the Ozark oak forest spread out until arrested by the people.\n\nOzark Prairie is the largest in the county; commencing at the southeast corner of Mount Vernon it sweeps round to the east, thence northeast and north, widening as it passes toward the northwest, dotted with inumberable beautiful farm residences and wide- spreading farms, while very frequently splendid orchards relieve the usual evenness of a prairie view, until the name of Ozark Prairie is lost in the vast prairies of the Great West. As a general rule the land is good, but it is a fact that might reasonably be expected in so large a scope that there is some land that would be considered poor. Nearly all the land on this prairie that is susceptible of tillage is in cultivation, and generally sells at a high figure for this country, but not nearly so high as land of the same kind east of the Mississippi or in Iowa.\n\nSpring River Prairie, which lies west and southwest of Mount\n\nPage 3\n\nVernon from three to five miles to the nearest part, extends from Spring River southeast, about fifteen miles, and is about from three to six miles wide. Nearly all the land on this prairie is under fence and in cultivation or pasturage. On the southeast half is located the famous German neighborhood, which is now fast becoming the most populous and wealthy district of its size in the county, notwithstanding that not fifteen years ago it was said that a ï¿½man would starve to deathï¿½ on the very prairie which is now adorned with some of the handsomest homes in the county, and produces thousands of bushels of wheat, oats and corn and many tons of hay. The northwest half of the prairie is in a high state of cultivation, and can boast of some of the finest residences in this community.\n\nRock Prairie, in the northeast corner of the county, embraces a large body of valuable land well built up by a very thrifty lot of good farmers.\n\nBuck Prairie is in the southeast corner of the county, coming up near Marionville. Like the other prairies of the Southwest, it is all fenced up and well cultivated.\n\nElk Horn and Lick Prairies are on the south side of the county, well built up. Aurora, a thriving town on the railroad, is in Elk Horn Prairie. Of Lawrence County in general the prairie districts are in the north and northwest part of the county. North of Phelps the prairie is magnificent and the same may be said of the county east of Phelps.\n\nRivers and Creeks.--Spring River is the most noted stream of the county, and takes its name from the large number of fine springs which break out all along its course in this county and pour their limpid waters into it, as well as from the famous spring at its source, in the southeast part of the county, which gushes forth from its white, pebbly bottom, flowing off in a stream as clear as crystal, and which affords abundant power for three mills within a mile of the spring, two grain or grist-mills, and one saw mill and a carding-machine and cotton-gin connected with one of the grist-mills.\n\nThis stream rises about one mile south of Verona, and flows in a northwesterly direction, passing out of the county near the\n\nPage 4\n\nhalf-way point of the western line at Bowerï¿½s Mill, which name is derived from the extensive flouring-mills, saw-mills and other machinery there located, but on the map the place is marked ï¿½Lyons.ï¿½ Many of the finest bottom farms in the southwest lie on each side of this stream. A noted feature is that it is not subject to overflows like some other streams; the bottoms are wide, with a deep, rich soil which cannot be excelled in the production of wheat. Where the settlerï¿½s ax has not cleared away the timber to make way for cultivation, the bottoms and adjacent hills are covered with a thrifty growth of fine timber, consisting of oak, hickory, walnut, ash, cherry, sycamore, hackberry and others peculiar to this latitude, and a short distance to the south from the bottom is a beautiful prairie, extending from three to six miles in width, and about twelve in length, and on which are many valuable farms, and room for many more.\n\nHoney Creek rises in the southeast part of the county near Marionville. Like Spring River, the principle source of this stream is a large spring, known throughout the county as ï¿½Polk Springs,ï¿½ taking its name, it is said, from a near relative of President Polk. This stream flows in a west and then a northwest direction into Spring River, near the center of the county. Many very fine farms are to be found on either side of this stream, the bottoms being very fertile and wide. This stream is not encroached upon by abrupt hills and bluffs as many streams in the southwest, yet there are some rough, bluffy places along its course, but all along, where the land is not adapted for agricultural purposes, it is covere with valuable timber.\n\nTurnback Creek rises on the east side of the county, near the center, flows northwest and passes out of the county on the north side a short distance east of the half-way point of the northern line of the county. All along this stream the country is rough and broken, presenting some of the finest grazing lands, covered by a forest of valuable timber, yet along the whole course are many very valuable farms.\n\nCenter Creek rises in the southern middle of the county and flows northwest through one of the finest and most valuable agricultural districts.\n\nThere are several other small steams in the county, viz.:\n\nPage 5\n\nWhite Oak, in the northwest part of the county; Stahlï¿½s and Cherryï¿½s Creeks are north of Mt. Vernon, and Williamsï¿½ Creek passes near the town. Along these creeks are fine bottom farms in a high state of cultivation. Some other streams of small size pass through portions of the county.\n\nClear Creek may be said to be the sole property of Peirce City. Near the springs at its source the city water-works are constructed.\n\nMines and Miners.--Lawrence County is no exception to other portions of this great mineral district in her possession of hidden treasures. In 1873 the people cried out ï¿½Eureka!ï¿½ In March, 1873, George Haley and George Connell prospected and worked a lead deposit near the Upshaw House, on Jenkinsï¿½ road, six miles from Verona. Prior to this time, in February, 1869, O. P. Johnson discovered lead ore northeast of Mount Vernon, two miles from Turnback.\n\nIn August, 1874, lead was discovered on the McGee tract and other lands in the neighborhood.\n\nIn May and June, 1873, bands of prospectors wandered throughout the county, and mining companies were organized, all following the Haley discoveries at Aurora. The Bowerï¿½s Mills Mining Company comprised George Messick, Ben Skiller, Milt. Houton and Jacob Dunkle. The Colley Company leased Price Colleyï¿½s land, and commenced work under the direction of Dr. Wright, Nelson Hushaw, A. T. Wooton, Israel Disler and Isaac Hope. The senior company of all, known as the Marionville Company, comprised George Haley, W. M. Freeman, George Cannefax, Gillett & Son, ------Ward, ------Cornell and Abe Grammar, were at work one mile north of Aurora. The Aurora Company was also at work. Parson and the old Joplin miner, Swindle, were at work on Greene C. Stottï¿½s farm, Miles W. Coates, Gibson Colley, James Colley and John Lebow had a shaft on Leroy Camdenï¿½s land; Knight & Teasdale were mining within the Peirce City limits, and later the company was mined on the Shannon farm, while the Mount Vernon Company was prospecting near Johnson & Cherryï¿½s mill, on Turnback Creek. The members of this company were John G. Wear, William H. Johnson, Ham Gaither, James H. Matthews, W.\n\nPage 6\n\nFletcher King, A. R. Conklin, G. S. Milsaps, Robert Kelley, G. W. Fowler, T. H. Jones, A. K. Millsaps, J. F. Ward, Wyatt Harris, W. E. Wright, J. B. Underwood, H. George, William H. Wilson and R. H. Landrum.\n\nIn July, 1881, John W. Johnson, in digging a well two miles north of Mount Vernon, struck two veins of lead. The great leads at Aurora are noticed in the history of that town.\n\nBuilding Stone.--In the northeast corner of Township 28, Range 26, near a winter rivulet, is found an excellent fine-grained limestone, in regular layers, averaging six inches in thickness, which can be taken out in any desired lengths.\n\nThe sandstone quarries of Marionville are celebrated throughout the southwest as the dark yellow sandstone. This is taken out in huge blocks, the same as used in the jail building at Mount Vernon. Chigar Hill, just north of Mount Vernon, may be termed a small mountain of good building stone. Around Mount Vernon the large limestone bluffs furnish excellent stone, of any size, and of every quality from the fine-grained to the heavy, coarse-grained stone.\n\nTrees.--In October, 1869, Allen & Moody had at their saw-mill an oak log twenty-four feet long, which produced 9,000 feet of inch lumber. This log was cut near the mill on Honey Creek, five miles southwest of Mount Vernon. Even to-day this old Ozark country can produce some of the finest hardwood trees to be found east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nFruit trees and shrubs of all kinds do well in this country, such as apples, peaches, cherries, pears, plums, grapes, gooseberries, strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries. During the last few years considerable attention has been given to the successful growing of such fruits. Fruit crops are almost sure, except peaches, which sometimes fail. The timber is well distributed over the country.\n\nProducts.--The principal agricultural products are wheat, corn, oats, potatoes, tobacco, timothy and clover, although of late much attention has been given to the cultivation of the Chinese sugar-cane or ï¿½sorghum.ï¿½ The yield is profitable, averaging over 200 gallons of molasses to the acre, while wheat yields about fifteen bushels; oats, thirty-five bushels; corn,\n\nPage 7\n\nforty bushels; tobacco, 1,200 pounds; timothy, one and one-half tons, and clover, two tons.\n\nBirds.--Lawrence, like her three southwestern neighbors, forms a paradise for birds. All the travelers of tropical climes come here as visitors, and after their departure the northern birds come down to make their winter home here. In October, 1874, 2,500 pigeons were killed at the roost near Marionville in one night. J. S. Drake thinks there were 25,000,000 at the time, for he remembers seeing the flying flocks close off the very sunlight from a large area. The roost near Mount Vernon, though thickly inhabited, is a modern pigeon settlement. A large gray eagle was killed in Northern Lawrence, January 16, 1869, by Joseph Berry. From tip to tip of wings it measured eight feet.\n\nInsects.--Chigar Hill is named from the minute chigar, which, next to the tick, is one of the most ferocious insect enemies of man. The female mosquito is considered innocuous when compared with this miniature cannibal.\n\nThe tick is much more decisive in his movements than the smaller members of his species. The fact that he is visible to the naked eye gives man the only advantage over him, but this advantage, if not followed up by keeping a distance from his haunts, is of small importance, as the tick, in his native home, is all powerful without reason.\n\nIn 1855, 1868 and 1881 locusts swarmed throughout the country.\n\nReptiles.--The several species common to this section of the Ozark Mountains are found here, but strange to say not so active or numerous as in Barry or McDonald Counties. In September, 1876, W. H. Reagan captured a centipede, nine inches long, with forty feet, three miles northwest of Mount Vernon. The tarantula comes here as a stranger, and is so timid as to confine his wanderings to some untraveled part of the country.\n\nAnimals of Chase.--Before the first settlers arrived here the Indians rid the forests of Spring River of all the large game, such as the buffalo and antelope. The common deer remained some years, but is now only seen at long intervals. The wolf, once so numerous, has almost disappeared. In April, 1868, Alonzo\n\nPage 8\n\nChewing killed a large mountain wolf in Vineyard Township. Now large game is so scarce that their appearance causes surprise.\n\nIn June, 1875, Joseph Browning and Thomas Adams were traveling a few miles south of Marionville, when they were attacked by a panther. The animal seized Adamsï¿½ mule by the neck, when the mule began to bellow and buck, and succeeded in throwing Adams off. Tom took to the trees, leaving Browning to witness the muleï¿½s struggle with the panther. Browning, missing his friend, called out to Tom, to answer if he were hurt. Tom to Browningï¿½s great surprise, shouted from a tree-top, ï¿½Oh, Lord; Iï¿½m in the top of this tree! Ugh!ï¿½ Browning wished he were there too, and set up a tremendous howl, loud enough to secure the presence of Farmer Hare, who discovered that the panther was a sheep of a fighting temperament.\n\nFrom the year 1859 to May 15, 1861, when the first record of wolf-scalp hunters ceases, there were forty-three scalps presented to the treasurer by the hunters of Lawrence County. Among the names of the first hunters were the following: William Cherry, Isaac Gilley, Moses H. Shelton, John F. Hunter, Thomas Colley, William Brice, James Wilkinson, H. J. Charles, Andrew Tarteer, Thomas Price, William Horn, James Wilkinson, Joseph C. Berry, William S. Gullett, Benjamin S. Thaxton, William Chandler, W. M. Paris and H. F. Smith. From December 8, 1862, to December 11, 1865, there were only forty-nine wolves killed, although the forests were full of them. Men in these days were looking rather for men to slay, but the following named at least found time to take the forty-nine scalps referred to: James J. Cherry, John B. Hunt, L. A. Williamson, I. E. Shelton, H. Norton, Paul M. Pigg, Elijah B. Hillhouse, George W. Benbrook, J. D. Hillhouse, A. J. Davidson, John P. Williams, Ephraim Tarteer, N. W. Browning, Logan L. Howard, James Pennington, William R. Fountain, John P. Gullett, Claiborn Osbourne, R. S. Hillhouse, G. W. Wooten, Egbert Prewett and T. N. Selby. From January to September, 1866, there were forty-six scalps reported. Many of the above named were among the post-bellum hunters, with William Mullins, S. S. Williams, J. L. Schooling, Daniel Pennington, Wiley Shoultes, J. M. Gibson, J.\n\nPage 9\n\nG. Rucker, Abata Ervin, James E. Neece, William W. Hatton, C. T. McCray, W. E. Cherry, W. W. Morris, F. M. Morris, J. M. White and W. C. Sullivan. About the beginning of 1867 men returned to industry, and as they made progress the wolves disappeared.\n\nStorm and Flood.--The hailstorm of May 1, 1871, was felt in Southern Lawrence and Northern Barry. The hail destroyed hogs, sheep and poultry. In one instance a hailstone struck a man on the head knocking him senseless.\n\nOn May 26, 1872, a great rain drenched the country round Verona for twenty miles, destroying many miles of railroad track and inundating the country. In the old town of Verona the water rose within a few minutes from three to five feet, flowing in a strong current into Spring River. A family of three persons was lost, viz.: the keeper of the water-tank at Verona, George Greenloch, wife and daughter.\n\nA tornado swept through the county in August, 1875, doing much damage on Stone Prairie.\n\nThe Lawrenceburg tornado of August 7, 1879, destroyed Dr. John W. Wilkersonï¿½s dwelling, while the Masonic Hall was raised off its foundation and placed diagonally across. A dwelling house was also turned around. This storm of 1871 destroyed Wilkersonï¿½s former house.\n\nThe tornado of April 18, 1880, referred to in the history of Barry County, moved Clay Hill school-house about thirty feet from its foundation, blew away Ezekiel Ellisï¿½ barn, destroyed Sam Berryï¿½s dwelling and destroyed the houses of Ira Ward, George Hogan, Harrison Wilson, Jerry Ellis, Fayette Adkinson, Hubbard J. Williams, Sr., and J. E. Williams, Jr., all in the neighborhood of Verona. At Aurora twelve houses were blown down, and the Laney Brosï¿½ mill destroyed, although the path of the whirlwind was four miles south. Hailstones weighing one and one-quarter pounds were picked up at Aurora.\n\nThe tornado of December 4, 1880, destroyed the colored menï¿½s church, Joe Hensleyï¿½s cabin, damaged the Methodist and Baptist Church buildings, destroyed Dock Jonesï¿½ smoke-house, Dr. Hockerï¿½s store building, McCuneï¿½s stable, also J. L. Lebowï¿½s, W. W. Whaleyï¿½s and H. Grayï¿½s buildings, and moved Wright &\n\nPage 10\n\nCo.ï¿½s warehouse. The Ozark Prairie brick church building was unroofed, the Fairplay school-house destroyed, also David Hoodï¿½s dwelling, Tennisï¿½ grain-house, and Massey Millerï¿½s house unroofed. The damage to orchards and fences on Ozark Prairie was extensive. At Heaton Dr. Lowranceï¿½s store building was destroyed. At Lawrenceburg, M. Morrisï¿½ house was destroyed, and L. Minottï¿½s, A. Mooreï¿½s, James Boxï¿½s, A. Adamsï¿½, J. Abbottï¿½s houses, with their dwellings, were injured.\n\nPhenomea.--In November, 1872, the remains of Mrs. Sherman (who died in 1868, and was buried at Bowerï¿½s Mills) were exhumed. The hair was perfectly solid, the clothing the same as on the day of interment, and the body as solid as stone, while the features were unchanged from the moment of death.\n\nOn July 1, 1861, the brilliant comet was visible from this district. Grasshoppers were plenty in February, 1862. On July 3, 1863, a vast smoke floated over the country and continued until the 6th. One could with difficulty see a man thirty paces off, but not farther. The blizzard of January 1, 1864, set in with terrific violence.\n\nFrom 1874 to 1881 good crops were the rule. In the latter year the locusts destroyed the crops, but in 1882 fortune smiled again on agriculture, and crops henceforth were above the average of any previous decade. An aerolite passed over Southwest Missouri in April, 1876, in its course from the northeast, exploding, finally, a few miles from Washburn. The report was heard as far south as Fayetteville, Ark.\n\nCold Days.--R. B. Taylorï¿½s record of the coldest days in Lawrence County, from 1868 to February, 1875, is as follows: 1868, December 11, 1 below 0; 1869, February 23, 0; 1870, December 24, 8 below 0; 1871, December 4, 2 above 0; 1872, December 22, 8 below 0; 1873, January 26, 14 below 0; 1874, January 15, 10 above 0; 1875, January 9, 10 below 0. Only once within the last thirteen years has the mercury fallen lower than it did in 1875, and seldom so low as that.\n\nRain Fall.--Droughts may be said to be unknown in this region. In May, 1878, the rain fall was 5.9 inches. J. S. Drake, who was then observer at Mount Vernon for the Missouri Western Services, stated that since 1839 there about eight Mays\n\nPage 11\n\nthat had a greater rain fall. In the history of Newton County a fair statement of rain fall is given, and the figures apply to Mount Vernon almost as closely as they do to Neosho.\n\nEXPLORATION AND SETTLEMENT\n\nEarly Pioneers.--That this portion of Missouri was occupied by white men in days long ago, is evidenced by the ï¿½diggingsï¿½ near Seneca, and the Spanish Fort near the county seat of Lawrence.\n\nThe Spanish Fort Cemetery, about three miles south of Mount Vernon, is partly within the boundaries of the old fort, said to have been built there in the Seventeenth Century by the Spaniards. There is no written record of this early settlement, so that its credit to the Spanish explorers, while acquiesced in by the pioneers, is merely legendary.\n\nJudge Ritchey, speaking of his journey to the country of the Six Bulls, in 1832, affirms that where Springfield now is was then the site of one small grocery store and smaller stock. At that time Crawford County, settled about 1815, and organized in 1829, stretched south and west to Arkansas and the Indian Country, north to the Osage, and east to the line of Franklin, Washington and Wayne Counties, with Steelville, the county seat. The country of the Six Bulls was that drained by the Grand River and its six tributaries. As the settlements progressed these streams were named Elk or Cowskin River, Shoal Creek, Centre Creek, Spring River, North Fork and Neosho River. The same traveler of 1832, setting out for the country of the Six Bulls from Kickapoo Prairie, was pointed out a dim trail leading southwest. Pursuing this trail for three days generally brought the emigrant face to face with ï¿½Squire John Williams and his five sons, who settled in, or about 1831, three miles northeast of the town of Mount Vernon. At Verona James White and his young wife had made a home, while George Gibson, his father-in-law, had settled almost a mile due north. James Williams, David Gibson, and John Gibson are sons of those pioneers. James M. White is living, and had the honor, in 1888, of being caught by a ï¿½Frisco locomotive and cast into the fields near the Verona depot, without physical injury.\n\nPage 12\n\nJudge Landrum, in his pioneer reminiscences, written in 1878, states that David McKenzee, who came the next year after Judge Williams and son, and who settled on Spring River about eight miles northwest of where Mount Vernon now stands, cleared off and cultivated a small field, which was the first land cultivated in the county. Jesse H. Duncan, James Mayfield and George Duncan came in 1833, and settled on Spring River, west of S. S. Williams. James Burrough, George Gibson, James Gibson, Elijah Hillhouse, C. G. Cowan, William Bracken, J. M. White, A. A. Young and others settled in the county in 1834. A. A. Young, better known as Uncle Young, was the first preacher that settled in the Territory, now Lawrence County.\n\nIn 1835 Joseph Bearden, William Lumley and others arrived and settled here. William Lumley was an old Revolutinary soldier, and his body now lies moldering in the dust, on Turnback Creek, near where Lumleyï¿½s mill stood, on the Mount Vernon and Bolivar road. In 1876 the good citizens of the neighborhood in which he was buried raised, by subscription, money enough to cause a substantial stone wall to be placed around his grave. This was done in memory of the only Revolutionary soldier whose body lies buried in Lawrence County. Joseph Schooling, Jesse Williamson, Sampson Wright, Zepheniah Gunn, Philip Hash, Robert B. Taylor, William Mullins, Robert Hash, Ralph Elkins, Capt. John Gullett and others settled here in 1836. Capt. Gullett and R. B. Taylor are still living in the county; the others are dead or have moved away. Benjamin Stahls, William Truett, Washington Smith, Robert Kimmons, Price Anderson, Richard and Samuel Price, A. B. Baugh and others arrived in the year 1838. Those named are all dead. In 1839 many others came in and settled, among whom were John Toliver, Asa Wormington, James Cherry, William Orr, Stephen Powell, William Connel, Thomas M. Polk (a cousin to James K. Polk, ex-President of the United States) and Jesse M. Taylor. The last named is still living in the county. Ambrose Coleman, William Coleman, John W. Richardson, Jeremiah Love, La Fayette Mayberry, James McCanse and others arrived in 1840. John Ingram, Wyatt Harris, Sr., Dempsey Jackson, Elijah Lingo, James McCally, James A. Gutherie, John Link, Jesse Mundon, Andrew\n\nPage 13\n\nMoore and Bradford Samuels and others arrived in 1841. His references to Uncle Jimmie White, a settler of 1831, are so connected with the early religious history as to require a place in the chapter on churches.\n\nA number of families accompanied Judge John Williams from Tennessee in 1831, but on reaching the creek and breaks near the eastern part of the county all turned back disheartened except the Judge and his son Samuel S. Williams, whereupon the creek was called Turnback, and still bears that name. Mr. S. S. Williams settled two miles west of Mount Vernon in 1833.\n\nWyatt Harris, in his Centennial Sketch, says that from the year 1841 the settlement of the county was rapid, each succeeding year bringing large numbers of immigrants. The settlers came mostly from Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Virginia, with a few from almost every State east of the Mississippi.\n\nJesse H. Duncan and George Duncan opened the first store and sold the first goods that were sold in the territory now forming Lawrence County. Their place of business was at the McKenzie Spring, on Spring River, about eight miles west of Mount Vernon. They sold goods there during the years 1833, 1834 and 1835.\n\nThe country up to 1835 was inhabited by a few roving bands of Deleware Indians, the principal village being located on James River, a few miles south of the city of Springfield.\n\nSamuel Powers settled above the Fullertons. Richard Tankersley and his son-in-law, Campbell G. Gowan, came in the spring of 1833, one locating at a point above the mouth of Prewettï¿½s Creek, and the other on the site of Peirce City. Before the close of 1833 settlements were made on Spring River, Elk River, Indian Creek and high up on Shoal River. Job Ratliff settled on the site of Neosho early in 1834, while his father, James Ratliff, located at the grand falls of Shoal River.\n\nThatcher Vivion and John Fullerton settled near Centreville, afterward named Sarcoxie. In 1833 Vivion sold goods on Centre Creek, at Sarcoxie; while Fullertonï¿½s cabin was a mile up the creek. In the seventies one of his sons was a pioneer of Peirce City.\n\nIn February, 1888, David E. Gibson died at the age of seven-\n\nPage 14\n\nty-four years. He came here with his father, George M. Gibson, in 1831, leaving only one of the pioneers of that year living, Judge J. M. White, of Verona. The settlers of 1831, who preceded Uncle Davy to the grave, were Daniel Beal, Thomas Horn, George M. Gibson, and Judge Williams.\n\nReunion.--The beginning of the old settlersï¿½ reunions in this county dates back to August 18, 1883. At that time a large number of pioneers congregated on the sward east of Phelps. Dr. M. Taylor presided. At this meeting James White, of Verona, related that four of his children, born on the old homestead, claimed each a different county as the place of birth. The Delaware Indians were his only neighbors in 1831. The prize of $25 was equally divided between James M. White, who arrived the last week of October, 1831, and David E. Gibson, who came at that time. Elizabeth Williams, who was present, came November 17, 1831. A similar prize was offered to the oldest person on the ground, which was won by James H. Robinson, aged eighty-three. John Chandler claimed to be one hundred and one, but had no records, so was omitted. Among the other competitors were J. M. White, seventy four; Elizabeth Williams, seventy-one; Mary Wicker, seventy-three; Harriet Tillottson, eighty-one; N. H. Goss, seventy-seven; Arminius Dobyns, seventy-six and Mary Downing, eighty; Mrs. William Connellï¿½s baby won the carriage; Miss Gertrude Kirby won the prize as the prettiest woman, Jacob Stemmons as the handsomest man, Dr. M.

The cost of apprehending, advertising and selling him was $138.35. During the ensuing summer this incident caused such excitement among the slave owners that they determined to organize for protection.\n\n*Contract sets forth that Zinn was not to pay any of Louisaï¿½s debts, neither was he to take any of the property she then had. He further agreed to allow her to manage and control her property as she pleased. This contract was acknowledged by both before Thomas Hash, circuit clerk.\n\nPhoto Plate inserted here. Inscribed ï¿½Yours Trulyï¿½ ï¿½John S. Colemanï¿½ Lawrence County.\n\nPage 36\n\nThe first patrol company appointed by the county court was on August 8, 1849, for Mount Vernon Township. Solomon Brown was captain, J. M. Kellogg, William Jennings, E. H. Moore and E. G. Paris, privates. Each was instructed to patrol not less than twelve nor more than sixteen hours per month, the pay being 10 cents per hour. In the tax roll of 1861 all the old slave holders are named.\n\nAnte-Bellum Cattle Marks.--The first record of cattle marks was made May 2, 1845, by Alfred Moore, of Mount Vernon Township, who took the following method of mutilating his stock: ï¿½Ear mark--Crop off the right ear, 2 under bit in the left ear.ï¿½ Henry F. Williams adopted ï¿½crop and slit in each ear.ï¿½ Joseph Ellisï¿½ cattle mark was ï¿½a crop of the right ear,ï¿½ and Alfred Moyearï¿½s cattle had an under bit in each ear. James Bell, of Vineyard, had one under half crop in each ear; Jackonyer Baldwin, of Greene, used a crop off the left ear, and under bit in right ear. S. M. Pharis, of Mount Vernon, had his cattle, sheep and hogs marked with an under bit near the end of the right ear, and William B. Brown, of Vineyard, used a smooth crop off the left ear. These were the only marks recorded in 1845-46. During the years 1861-63 John S. Richmond, of Turnback, George Orr and James M. Moore, of Mount Vernon, and John Vanderpool, of Ozark, had their stock marks. In 1864 L. Williams, of Spring River, Leroy Mullins and M. B. Phillips, of Mt. Vernon, made record of marks. When it was certain that the war was over, men came to the county seat from all directions to record marks and brands, so that in this respect, at least, they would be protected from squads of unknown travelers who rushed hither and thither through the country.\n\nTRANSACTIONS OF THE COUNTY COURT\n\nEarly Proceedings.--Under the act of February 24, 1843, the limits of Lawrence County were defined as follows: Beginning at the corner of Sections 25 and 36 on line between Ranges 29 and 30; thence west with town line to its intersection of the east line of Jasper County; thence south with east line of\n\nPage 37\n\nJasper and Newton Counties, to the corner of Sections 25, 26, 35 and 36, of Township 26 north, Range 29 west; thence east with the subdivision lines of Township 26 to the place of beginning. All that portion of the territory described as belonging to the new county of Lawrence, lying north of the line of 1843, between Dade and Barry Counties, was attached to Dade County for civil and military purposes, and all that portion lying south of such line was attached to Barry County for similar purpose, but neither Dade nor Barry Counties was allowed to levy taxes in Lawrence County for the uses of public buildings.\n\nUnder the act of February 14, 1845, many new counties were established, Lawrence County among the number. The boundaries then given commenced at the corner of Sections 25 and 36, on line dividing Ranges 24 and 25, north with this line to that dividing Townships 29 and 30 west, on town line to intersection of the east line of Jasper County; thence south with east line of Jasper and Newton to the Corner of Sections 25, 26, 35 and 36, Township 26 north, Range 29 west; thence due east with subdivisional lines of Township 26 to beginning. Larkin Newton, of Newton, Elijah Gray, or Greene, and Samuel Melugan, of Jasper, were commissioned to locate the county seat, and Robert Taylorï¿½s house was the stated court-house. In May the court appointed H. G. Joplin, vice Melugan.\n\nUnder the special act of February 25, 1845, Joseph Schooling, Joseph Rinker and Robert B. Taylor were appointed judges of the county, meeting at the house of Robert B. Taylor. On April 7 this board organized, with Joseph Schooling presiding. Washington Smith was sheriff; Samuel S. Williams was appointed clerk; Aaron Winters, assessor, who received $33 for his services; Washington Smith, collector, and John Allen, surveyor. In May, 1845, W. H. Stroud was appointed commissioner of the seat of justice, and was empowered to borrow $94.50 from Sampson Wright, at 10 per cent, to pay said Wright. At this time Larkin Newton, Elijah Gray and Harris G. Joplin were allowed $10 each for their services in locating the county seat. W. H. Stroud was ordered to advertise the sale of lots at Mount Vernon in the Springfield Advertiser, for July, 1845. On June 8, 1845, the court met at the house of George White, Mount Vernon, and\n\nPage 38\n\nthere the circuit court was held in July following. In February, 1846, W. S. M. Wrightï¿½s name appeared as acting sheriff and coroner.\n\nSection 16, Township 28, Range 28, was ordered to be sold April 7, 1845, on petition of the residents of that township. On May 4, 1845, Joseph S. Alexander, son of Samuel (deceased), then in his fifth year, was ï¿½boundï¿½ to Joseph Alexander until he would reach the age of twenty-one years. In May, 1845, Ephraim Gaither was appointed overseer of Road District No. 1, in Ozark Township. In November, 1845, Charles R. Berry, Philip Baldwin, and William Coleman were appointed to mark and view a rod from the Greene County road at the county line to Mount Vernon. At this time Henry McMullin was authorized to divide Ozark Township into road districts, and the justices of the other townships were given similar authority.\n\nA. Mauris, Jr., and G. W. Blick were the merchants who paid license in 1845.\n\nThe justices of the peace appointed in 1845 were W. H. Stroud, John A. Fouchee, Elijah R. Hurley, and George T. Taney, of Mount Vernon Township; Peter M. Swatzell and Joel Smith, of Vineyard; Oliver Woods, G. M. Gibson and Carver Gunn, of Spring River; Thomas Eubanks, of Ozark; William Hamilton, Matthew Dunegan and Jacomire Baldwin, of Greene; and Henry Foats, of Mount Pleasant; Henry McMullin, Jacob Burger, Goolsberry Kirby and Daniel Wan for Ozark.\n\nJames McKoin was granted license for a dram-ship at Mount Vernon, May 5 1846, the tax being $7.50, State, and $7.50, county, for three months.\n\nIn June, 1846, Aaron Winters reported having assessed 763 taxpayers, charging the county $80.04, or 12 1/2cents for each of the first 600 names, and 8 cents for the remaining 163 names. Of this total charge the State was debited with $44.02. In November W. H. Stroud was appointed agent to receive $181.95 as the countyï¿½s share of proceeds of sales of public lands donated to Missouri.\n\nIn August, 1846, James M. Kellogg and William Matthews were appointed superintendents for building a public well at Mount Vernon. They were also authorized to have 100 feet\n\nPage 39\n\nround the court-house cleared of trees and the stumps cut even with the ground. At this time Thomas Hash was allowed $2 for surveying and cutting road to John Hamiltonï¿½s spring.\n\nIn August, 1846, Wade H. Stroud, commissioner of the seat of justice, filed vouchers for $773.19, on the first sale bill of lots at Mount Vernon, leaving $377.81 outstanding.\n\nIn November, 1846, Judges Schooling, Rinker and Taylor presided with Wade H. Stroud, sheriff, and George White, treasurer. At that time John Lackey (or Lukey) was allowed $12 for taking care of Nancy Cable, a ward of the county. John Ingram, of Oregon (Lyons), was granted a grocerï¿½s license in February, 1847, and at the session, Commissioner Stroudï¿½s report showing $265.26 paid on town lots was presented. This report showed a balance of $112.50 due on lots. Thomas Hash was allowed $11 for making out State tax book for 1846, being 22,000 words, and $1 for taking and filing collectorï¿½s bond for State taxes. H.
