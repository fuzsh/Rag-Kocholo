        "text": "VERTICAL CHURCH BAND DEBUTS “LIVE WORSHIP FROM VERTICAL CHURCH” JULY 31 Vertical Church Band Features Worship Leaders from Chicago’s Harvest Bible Chapel\n\nAlbum Release Coincides with Pastor James MacDonald’s Book “Vertical Church”\n\n40-City Promotional Tour Launches Aug. 8\n\nVertical Church, the newly launched Harvest Bible Chapel platform to comprise book, music and film projects, announces its first audio worship release: Live Worship From Vertical Church by its worship team, Vertical Church Band. The 13-track CD, delivered in partnership with Essential Worship/Provident Label Group (one sonic society, Elevation Worship), will be available July 31. The project will release in conjunction with pastor James MacDonald’s (Chicago-based Harvest Bible Chapel and national Bible teaching ministry Walk in the Word) new book, “Vertical Church” and supported by a 40-city national tour which will feature members of Vertical Church Band.\n\n“The phrase ‘Vertical Church’ reflects a movement we’re seeing take shape, not just within our church but around the world. Vertical Church is the brand that will extend and multiply our message through film, music and publishing, beginning with my book and this CD by Vertical Church Band,” shares James MacDonald. “Worship is both mind and emotions and engages the whole-person. Nothing brings glory down in church as quickly and as powerfully as when God’s people unashamedly adore God’s great son, Jesus Christ.”\n\nFormed from within one of the largest and fastest growing churches in America, Harvest Bible Chapel, Vertical Church Band comprises worship leaders Andi Rozier, Meredith Andrews, Lindsay McCaul, Jacob Sooter, Seth McConkey, Kyle Fredricks and Heather Headley. Its first label offering, Live Worship From Vertical Church, provides a window into the powerful worship movement emanating from the Harvest community.\n\nRecorded at Harvest Bible Chapel’s downtown Chicago campus venue and produced by Paul Mabury (All Sons & Daughters, one sonic society, Hillsong UNITED) and Jason Ingram (Tenth Avenue North, one sonic society, Chris Tomlin) and executive producer James MacDonald, Live Worship From Vertical Church brings the listener to a place of worship (“Open Up The Heavens,” “Light Shine In”), reflects on the testimony of God’s work in our lives (“Greatness Of Our God,” “All Glory”) and ultimately expresses adoration and praise (“Word Of God,” “God, You Are My God”). “All Glory,” sung by Tony and GRAMMY Award winner Heather Headley, will be the project’s first single set to release at gospel radio.\n\nThe story behind the Vertical Church movement will be told, in part, via best-selling author, pastor, and founder of Harvest Bible Chapel, James MacDonald’s latest book “Vertical Church: What Every Heart Longs For. What Every Church Can Be.” (David C. Cook, August 2012)\n\nBoth the album and book will be co-promoted on a “Vertical Church” tour featuring Vertical Church Band and pastor MacDonald to 40 cities nationwide beginning Aug. 8. For an updated list of tour dates, visit: www.verticalchurchtour.com. Additional marketing for the record\n\nincludes appearances at fall worship conferences and a focused campaign to promote songs from Live Worship From Vertical Church to churches via outlets including CCLI.\n\nLive Worship From Vertical Church Vertical Church Band Writer credits listed under each song title 1.
