        "text": "If you are looking for worship song ideas for Sunday morning here’s help! With all of the things going on in the world these days, we thought it would be helpful to compile a list of 5 worship songs about peace. You may want to use these in your worship gatherings or just add them to a playlist of Christian songs about peace. Even as you add to your own library of peaceful songs for personal worship time, we think you’ll find this list helpful.\n\nIf you find yourself worried about the struggles we face these days, cling to the words from Jesus in John 14:27, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.” (NIV)\n\nThe New Living Translation says it this way, “I am leaving you with a gift—peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don’t be troubled or afraid.” This gift of peace is not something we can get from the world. If you find yourself consumed with worry and trying to find relief on the news or social media you will only find yourself overwhelmed with more worry.\n\nWe are not meant to carry the burdens of this world. Jesus Christ did that on the cross. So, cling to Him and Him alone! Philippians 4:6-7 says, “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”\n\nScripture is very clear in teaching that our peace comes from trusting Jesus and resting in His power and sovereignty. One of the most effective things we can do when battling worry is to close our social media apps, turn off the news, and open our Bibles.\n\nOne other thing that will greatly impact your life is to be involved in a local church where you can find community to pray with you and do life alongside you.\n\nIf you want to see more scriptures on peace check out one of our other recent blogs called, “7 Amazing Scriptures on Peace.”\n\nNow that we’ve looked at a few Bible verses about peace, let’s jump into our list of worship songs on peace.\n\n1. Tremble (Mosaic MSC)\n\nWritten by Andres Figueroa, Hank Bentley, Mariah McManus, Mia Fieldes\n\nFirst on our list of praise and worship songs about peace is “Tremble.” We love this song because it is a declaration of the power of Jesus over the troubles of this world.\n\nWhen this song is used in a worship gathering, it leads your congregation to sing out in prayer while petitioning the power of Christ over themselves and the world. This song activates worshippers to call on Jesus and trust Him with the outcome.\n\nPeace, bringing it all to peace\n\nThe storm surrounding me\n\nLet it break at Your name\n\nStill, call the sea to stillThe rage in me to stillEvery wave at Your name\n\nJesus, Jesus, You make the darkness trembleJesus, Jesus, You silence fearJesus, Jesus, You make the darkness trembleJesus, Jesus\n\nBreathe, then call these bones to liveCall these lungs to singOnce again, I will praise\n\nYour name is a light that the shadows can’t denyYour name cannot be overcomeYour name is alive forever lifted highYour name cannot be overcome\n\n2. No One Ever Cared For Me Like Jesus (Steffany Gretzinger)\n\nWritten by Steffany Gretzinger, Chandler Moore, Dante Bowe, Jason Ingram\n\nFrom the peaceful instrumentation to the vulnerable lyrics and tender vocal, this song is full of peace and the comfort of knowing Jesus. It is a reminder of the faithfulness of God and His promise to never forsake us. This song brings peace to the weary soul with that reminder and will spark gratitude in their heart. That’s what places this song second on our list of praise and worship songs about peace.\n\nIf my heart could tell a storyIf my life would sing a songIf I have a testimonyIf I have anything at all\n\nNo one ever cared for me like JesusHis faithful hand has held me all this wayAnd when I’m old and greyAnd all my days are numbered on the earthLet it be known in you aloneMy joy was found\n\nLet my children tell their childrenLet this be their memoryThat all my treasure was in heavenAnd you were everything to me\n\nI’ve found my joy\n\nI’m still in loveYour still enough for meStill all I wantYour still my everything\n\n3. Your Nature (Kari Jobe)\n\nWritten by Kari Jobe Carnes, Jacob Sooter, Hank Bentley, Charles Starling\n\nThird on our list of worship songs about peace is Kari Jobe’s “Your Nature.” Nothing stirs hope and brings peace like declaring who God is and trusting in His strength and power. This moving song is written from Isaiah 54: 1-17. It is a song of trust and dependence on the restorative work of Christ in our lives. It contains a powerful message that calls God’s children to sing out and believe in His promises.\n\nYou bring life to the barren placesLight to the darkest spacesGod, it’s Your natureYou bring joyTo the broken heartedHope to the ones who’ve lost itGod, it’s Your natureThere is no desert thatYour streams can’t run toThere are no ruins thatYour love won’t make newYou tell the wastelandThat it will bloom againCause it’s Your natureYou will restore the yearsThat shame has stolenYou keep the promisesThat You have spokenI know this wastelandWill be whole againCause it’s Your natureYou bring peaceTo the war inside usSpeak and all fear is silencedGod, it’s Your natureYou bring joy to the broken heartedHope to the ones who’ve lost itGod, it’s Your natureSing out oh barren womanSing out oh broken manStretch out your handsBelieving this is your promise landBreak out of disappointmentBreak out of hopelessnessStretch out your handsBelieving this is your promise land\n\n4. Lean Back (Maverick City Music)\n\nWritten by Chris McClarney, Nate Moore, Amanda Cook, Tony Brow\n\nMaverick City Music’s “ Lean Back” not only can be categorized as a worship song about peace and comfort, it is also a song about rest. This Christian song draws worshippers into a posture of surrender into the Father’s loving arms.\n\nThe lyrics serve as a reminder of God’s faithfulness and His ever-present, open arms ready to gather His children. It calls to the searching soul and sings of the love of the Father that is greater than anything we could find in this world.\n\nYou will never leaveYour love sustaining meBefore I even knew what love was\n\nYou’ve brought me here to restAnd given me space to breatheSo I’ll stay still until it sinks in\n\nAnd I will lean back in the loving armsOf a beautiful FatherBreathe deep and know that He is goodHe’s a love like no other\n\nNow I can see Your love is betterThan all the others that I’ve seenAnd I’m breathing deep, of all Your goodnessYour loving kindness to me\n\nI thought I knew what love wasBut it’s so much better, it’s better\n\nThis love is kind (it’s better, it’s better)It’s always present, so much better (it’s better, it’s better)This love is patient, This love is kindIt’s always present and it’s better, it’s better (it’s better, it’s better)Never knew a love like this\n\nYour love is healingLove is restoring Your love\n\n5. Always Good (Bethel Music, Hannah McClure)\n\nWritten by Rita Springer, Hannah McClure\n\nThis song made it onto our list of worship songs about peace because of its calming melody and comforting lyrics. The songwriters were inspired by Psalm 34:8 which says, “Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in Him.” The lyrics tell of the closeness of God in every circumstance. The songwriters also cite Matthew 11:28-30 which says, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” This song will bring comfort and peace to your church as they sing of the goodness of God.\n\nYou meet me on the mountain topYou see in me in the valley lowThere is no home without You here\n\nAnd I find You in the crowded thoughtsYou quiet all the question marks\n\nThere is no space Your love won’t fill\n\nI’ll trade all my fear for peace of mindAll my heaviness for burdens light\n\nAnd this will be my songThat You are always goodI’ll sing it all day longThat You are always goodAnd when the day is throughI am left withYou are alwaysYou are always good\n\nAnd I set my eyes on perfect faithYou’ll finish what You start in meAnd my heart will be an offering\n\nEvery melodyYou’re singing back to meYou’re singing back\n\nI’ve traded all my fear for peace of mindAnd You took heaviness, my burden’s light\n\nWorship Brings Peace\n\nAs you can see, there are many worship songs about peace that you can add to your worship presentation software.
