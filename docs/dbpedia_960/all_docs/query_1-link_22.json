        "text": "Christian music solo star Tauren Wells leads the pack of artist nominees at the 2018 Gospel Music Association Dove Awards.\n\nThe former frontman for Royal Tailor has seven nominations — more than any other artist — including nods for New Artist of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nLast year's New Artist winner Zach Williams is right behind him with six nominations, including his first for Artist of the Year.\n\nOther top artist nominees include Cory Asbury, Tasha Cobbs Leonard and TobyMac, each with five nominations. But beyond the artists, the night's top nominee overall is writer/producer Colby Wedgeworth, who has eight nominations thanks to his work with Wells and Williams.\n\nThe awards show is held annually in Nashville, and this year's event will take place Oct. 16 at Lipscomb University. Tickets for the show are available at www.doveawards.com. It also will be taped to air on Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) on Oct. 21.\n\nArtist of the Year\n\nHillsong UNITED, Hillsong Music Australia / Capitol CMG\n\nMercyMe, Fair Trade Services\n\nNEEDTOBREATHE, Atlantic Records\n\nTasha Cobbs Leonard, Motown Gospel\n\nZach Williams, Provident Label Group\n\nSong of the Year\n\n“All My Hope,” (writers) David Crowder, Ed Cash\n\n“Blessings,” (writers) Allen Swoope, Asheton Hogan, Lecrae Moore, Maurice Simmonds, Tyrone Williams Griffin Jr.\n\n“Broken Things,” (writers) Andrew Jacob Pruis, Jason Houser, Matthew West\n\n“Control (Somehow You Want Me),” (writers) Jason Ingram, Matt Bronleewe, Mike Donehey\n\n“Different,” (writers) Kyle Lee, Micah Tyler\n\n“Hills and Valleys,” (writers) Chuck Butler, Jonathan Smith, Tauren Wells\n\n“I just need U.,” (writers) Blake NeeSmith, Bryan Fowler, Kevin McKeehan\n\n“I'll Find You,” (writers) Danny Majic, John Mitchell, Justin Franks, Lecrae Moore, Natalie Sims, Sasha Sloan, Victoria Kelly\n\n“O'Lord,” (writers) Joe Williams, Paul Mabury\n\n“Old Church Choir,” (writers) Colby Wedgeworth, Ethan Hulse, Zach Williams\n\n“Reckless Love,\" (writers) Caleb Culver, Cory Asbury, Ran Jackson\n\n“So Will I (100 Billion X),” (writers) Benjamin Hastings, Joel Houston, Michael Fatkin\n\n“Unfinished,” (writers) Ben Glover, Colby Wedgeworth\n\nNew Artist of the Year\n\nCory Asbury, Bethel Music\n\nKoryn Hawthorne, RCA Inspiration\n\nMosaic MSC, Essential Worship\n\nPat Barrett, Capitol CMG\n\nTauren Wells, Provident Label Group\n\nGospel Artist of the Year\n\nCeCe Winans, Puresprings Gospel / Thirty Tigers\n\nJekalyn Carr, Lunjeal Music Group\n\nKirk Franklin, RCA Inspiration\n\nTasha Cobbs Leonard, Motown Gospel\n\nTravis Greene, RCA Inspiration\n\nWorship Song of the Year\n\n“Do It Again,” (writers) Chris Brown, Mack Brock, Matt Redman, Steven Furtick\n\n“Reckless Love,\" (writers) Caleb Culver, Cory Asbury, Ran Jackson\n\n“So Will I (100 Billion X),” (writers) Benjamin Hastings, Joel Houston, Michael Fatkin\n\n“Spirit of the Living God,” (writers) Jacob Sooter, Mia Fieldes\n\n“Tremble,” (writers) Andres Figueroa, Hank Bentley, Mariah McManus, Mia Fieldes\n\nPop/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year\n\n“All My Hope,” Crowder, (writers) David Crowder, Ed Cash\n\n“O'Lord, Lauren Daigle, (writers) Joe Williams, Paul Mabury\n\n“When We Pray,” Tauren Wells, (writers) Colby Wedgeworth, Ethan Hulse, Tauren Wells\n\n“I just need U.,” – TobyMac, (writers) Blake NeeSmith, Bryan Fowler, Toby McKeehan\n\n“Old Church Choir,” Zach Williams, (writers) Colby Wedgeworth, Ethan Hulse, Zach Williams\n\nRap/Hip Hop Recorded Song of the Year\n\n“Not Today Satan (ft.
