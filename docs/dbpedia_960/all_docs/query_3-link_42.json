        "text": "All of My Days – Ellie Holcomb\n\n****\n\nThe All of My Days EP by Ellie Holcomb (daughter of legendary CCM producer Brown Bannister), is a beautiful collection of seven Psalms that have personally carried her through difficult times as well as played an encouraging role in the lives of her listeners through her “Memory Mondays” where she sings Scripture verses to songs each week.\n\nThe instrumentation on these songs is acoustic and minimal, matching Holcomb’s tender vocals. On this project, Holcomb partnered with her father and with Jac Thompson, her keyboard player.\n\nHere are a few comments about each song:\n\nAll Of My Days – Psalm 23 – This song features Holcomb singing with acoustic guitar, bass, light background vocals and soft drums.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nYou’re here\n\nYou prepare a table before me\n\nYou’re here\n\nIn the presence of my deepest pain\n\nYou’rе here\n\nAnd my cup is overflowing\n\n‘Causе all your goodness and your mercy follow me\n\nWhere Can I Go – Psalm 139 – This song features acoustic guitar, cello, strings, backing vocals, drums, and keys.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nWhere can I go from Your spirit?\n\nWhere can I flee from Your presence?\n\nIf I go up to the heavens\n\nYou are there\n\nI Lift My Eyes – Psalm 121 – This song features acoustic guitar, backing vocals, keys, and light drums.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nHe’s always by your side\n\nThe Lord watches ovеr you day and night\n\nWait For You – Psalm 130 – This song features acoustic guitar, backing vocals, and cello.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nMore than the watchmen wait\n\nI’ll wait for you\n\nDon’t Forget His Love – Psalm 103 – This song features piano and backing vocals.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nPraise the Lord, oh my soul\n\nOh, and all my inmost being\n\nPraise the Lord, oh my soul\n\nDon’t forget His love\n\nMy Heart Is Steadfast – Psalm 108 – This song features bass, drums, backing vocals, acoustic guitar, and light drums.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nMy heart is steadfast, oh God\n\nI’ll sing praises up to thee among the nations\n\nI’ll givе thanks to thee, oh Lord, among the peoples\n\nI’ll sing praisеs up to thee within my soul\n\nThy Word – Psalm 119 – This song was written by Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith. Amy Grant recorded the song on her 1984 album Straight Ahead, which was produced by Brown Bannister. It features acoustic guitar, backing vocals, bass, cello, and light drums.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nThy word is a lamp unto my feet\n\nAnd a light unto my path\n\nThy word is a lamp unto my feet\n\nAnd a light unto my path\n\nFavorite songs:\n\nAll of My Days – Psalm 23\n\nWhere Can I Go – Psalm 139\n\nMy Heart is Steadfast – Psalm 108\n\nThy Word – Psalm 119\n\nYou can listen to the entire EP here.\n\nTo The Limit: The Essential Collection – Eagles\n\n****\n\nTo The Limit: The Essential Collection includes 51 songs from the studio albums and live recordings the Eagles released between 1972 and 2020. All of the band’s best-known songs are included, such as “Take it Easy,” “Hotel California,” “New Kid in Town,” “Lying Eyes,” “Heartache Tonight,” “Desperado,” “Tequila Sunrise”, “The Best of My Love” and more. Also included are lesser-known songs such as “Train Leaves Here This Morning,” “Nightingale,” “Outlaw Man,” “Saturday Night” and “On the Border” and “Good Day in Hell.”\n\nThe collection includes more than a dozen live songs from Eagles Live (1980) – including their recent concert opener “Seven Bridges Road” – as well as songs from Hell Freezes Over (1994), The Millennium Concert (2000), Live At The Forum ’76 (2017), and Live From The Forum MMXVIII (2020).\n\nThe Eagles were formed in 1972, and today consist of founding member Don Henley, as well as Joe Walsh, Timothy B. Schmit, with Vince Gill and Deacon Frey. They have performed more than 1,000 concerts worldwide. We were fortunate to see them in concert several times, including most recently in Washington in 2018, Las Vegas in 2019 (Hotel California Tour), and St. Louis in 2024 (The Long Goodbye Tour), and Lord willing, are planning to see them at the Sphere in Las Vegas in October.\n\nThe Eagles have sold more than 150 million albums worldwide, with six #1 albums and five chart-topping singles. They have earned six GRAMMY Awards and were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975 is the best-selling album in history (certified 38-times platinum), while Hotel California ranks as the third best-selling U.S. album in history (certified 26-times platinum).\n\nThe band is currently on their The Long Goodbye Tour, which is expected to extend into 2025.\n\nOne Hand Clapping – Paul McCartney and Wings\n\n****\n\nOne Hand Clapping was filmed and recorded at Abbey Road Studios in August 1974. Directed by David Litchfield, the project was envisioned as a TV special featuring Paul McCartney and Wings. The special was never aired, but now, 50 years later, the soundtrack to One Hand Clapping is finally available to hear as a live studio album, complete with the original intended artwork. The film was finally released in 2010 as part of the box set reissue of Band on the Run.\n\nAs Band on the Run was enjoying a seven-week consecutive run at #1 on the UK album charts, McCartney and Wings booked Abbey Road Studios for four days in August 1974 and let filmmaker Litchfield document them as they ran through a 26 song setlist that included recent hits, upcoming singles, B-sides, neglected album cuts, off-the-cuff medleys, instrumental jams, 50’s rockabilly covers, and a few Beatles songs. The band included McCartney on vocals, piano and bass, wife Linda on keyboards, Denny Laine on vocals and guitar, Jimmy McCulloch on guitar and Geoff Britton on drums.\n\nThe project, available as a bootleg release for many years, was originally recorded by Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick. The sound has been remixed by Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer George Martin. Some of the songs have previously been released on deluxe editions of other McCartney and Wings albums.\n\nI really enjoyed the album and thought that the band sounded better than the official album that followed this recording, 1975’s Venus and Mars.\n\nThe EXILE – Crowder\n\n****\n\nThree years after Milk & Honey, Crowder is back with another excellent album in The EXILE. The album, which features a number of musical styles (rock, country, CCM, worship), was produced by Ben Glover and Jeff Sojka. Themes include exile, salvation, our purpose in life, growth in our Christian life, prayer, and hope. It’s one of my favorite releases of 2024 thus far.\n\nHere’s a few comments about each song:\n\nThe EXILE Intro – This is a very brief intro to the album.\n\nGrave Robber – This rocker about being saved was the first song released from the album. It was written by Crowder, Ben Glover and Jeff Sojka. The song features some grungy guitar, excellent drumming and backing vocals.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nI got stolen by the grave robber\n\nPicked me up from that rock bottom\n\nWashed my soul in that holy water\n\nBrought me back to life (Brought me back to life)\n\n–[DASH] – This song was written by Crowder, Jeff Sojka, Ben Glover, TobyMac and Louie Giglio, and features TobyMac on vocals. The song is asking about our purpose on earth between our birth and death. The upbeat song features guitar, synth, bass, and percussion. The vocals of Crowder and TobyMac blend well.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nThere’s a day we’re born, day we pass\n\nIn between, there’s just a dash\n\nWhat on Earth am I doin’? (Yeah)\n\nSTILL – This midtempo song about growth in our Christian life, was written by Crowder, Ben Glover and Jeff Sojka. The song features guitar, bass, drums, and backing vocals.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nHe’s working on me still\n\nChanging me piece by piece still\n\nMaking me better, gonna do His thing\n\nDon’t care how long it takes till\n\nRinsed In The Blood – This rocker about being saved was written by Crowder, Ben Glover and Jeff Sojka, Solomon Olds, and Rebecca Olds. The song features keys, guitar, bass, drums, and backing vocals. God is going to get His man.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nRinsed in the blood, battle been won\n\nDeadman pulled right outta that mud\n\nBaptized by the fire, washed in the flood\n\nAin’t dirty no more, you’re rinsed in the blood\n\nEven In EXILE – This song about hope was written by Crowder, Matthew West and Jeff Pardo. The song features keys, synth, drums, guitar, and backing vocals. The song builds in intensity during the chorus.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nBut there’s still a promise, there’s still a song\n\nThere’s still a Rock where my help comes from\n\nHope is not lost, hope is not gone\n\nEven in exile\n\nSomebody Prayed – This song about the power of the God awe pray to was written by Crowder, Ben Glover, Jeff Sojka and Michael Cochran. The song features acoustic guitar, bass, drums, keys, and backing vocals. The song builds in intensity during the chorus.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nSo every night there by your bed\n\nWhen you fold your hands and bow your head\n\nNot a single word you’ve ever said in vain\n\n‘Cause He hears everything\n\nHands Of Jesus – This song about the hands of Jesus was written by Crowder, Ben Glover, Hank Bentley, Jeff Sojka, and Jonathan Smith. The song features piano, bass, drums, guitar, and backing vocals.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nSo bring your hurt and\n\nAll your broken pieces\n\nAnd put them in the miracle-working hands of Jesus\n\nLord Of All – This worship song was written by Crowder, Ben Glover and Jeff Sojka. The song features keys, backing vocals, guitar, drums, and bass. The song builds in intensity during the chorus.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nAll glory to the King\n\nAlways, eternally\n\nGod of everything\n\nLord of all\n\nUnstoppable – This rocker was written by Crowder, Ben Glover and Jeff Sojka, Solomon Olds, and Rebecca Olds. The song about the power of God in us features guitar, bass, drums, harmonica, and backing vocals.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nWhen I got You, I am unstoppable\n\nWhen I got You, nothing’s impossible\n\nNo way I lose, I am unbeatable, powerful\n\nStronger than invincible\n\nI feel bulletproof when I got You\n\nWhen I got You\n\nAll My Tears – This song was written by Julie Miller and features Buddy Miller. Some will remember the excellent Jars of Clay version of the song from their Good Monsters album. The song features acoustic guitar, drums, bass, electric guitar, and backing vocals.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nAnd it don’t matter\n\nWhere you bury me\n\nI’ll be home, and I’ll be free\n\nIt don’t matter where I lay\n\nAll my tears be washed away\n\nTruth Be Told – This song was written by Crowder and Hank Bentley. The song features acoustic guitar, banjo, backing vocals, drums, and bass. The song completes the exile theme.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nEvery little thing’s gonna be alright\n\nTears of joy is all we’ll cry\n\nEvery little thing’s gonna be alright\n\nOn the other side of exile\n\nFavorite songs:\n\nGrave Robber\n\n-{DASH}\n\nSTILL\n\nRinsed in the Blood\n\nEven in EXILE\n\nLord of All\n\nAll My Tears\n\nTruth Be Told\n\nWorthy is the Lamb – Michael W. Smith\n\nMichael W. Smith’s latest project is a five-song live worship EP that four classic songs – “Were You There”, “Above All”, “In Christ Alone” and “Agnus Dei”, and the highlight, a new song, “Crimson Dust”, which Smith wrote with Tony Wood. The first four tracks were captured live with the Nashville Recording Orchestra and a choir at the Fisher Center at Belmont University. The recording took place in 2023 as a part of an Easter Special in partnership with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. The songs are beautifully performed, though I’ve never been a fan of “Above All” because of the lyric:\n\nYou took the fall and thought of me\n\nAbove all\n\nOn the cross, Jesus was doing the will of the Father (Luke 22:42). He wasn’t thinking of me above all. The lyric communicates that Jesus thought about me more than his Father’s glory and that’s simply not true. That aside, I know the song has been a Smith favorite since it was released on the Worship album in 2001.\n\nOn the new song, Smith says, “Crimson Dust, which I wrote with Tony Wood, sets the scene of the day of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross.” You can watch Smith perform the song here. The chorus of the song is:\n\nI see heaven touching earth\n\nEvery drop of matchless worth\n\nRedeeming love\n\nWhat gain, what loss\n\nCrimson dust beneath the cross\n\nCrimson dust beneath the cross\n\nThis new EP is a nice addition to Smith’s catalog, with the highlight being “Crimson Dust”.\n\nLive from Good Friday – Chris Tomlin\n\n*** ½\n\nJust ahead of his eighth annual “Good Friday Nashville” concert at the Bridgestone Arena, Chris Tomlin, a long-time favorite of mine, released Live from Good Friday. The project includes songs from the previous gatherings, along with some new ones. Included are some of his best loved songs such as the medley “Good Good Father/Great Are You Lord”, “How Great Is Our God”, “Our God”, “Is He Worthy”, “At the Cross (Love Ran Red)”, and “Whom Shall I Fear (God of Angel Armies)”, which features vocals from George Mhondera, one of Tomlin’s background singers. Also included are three new songs from his 2023 album Always – “Holy Forever” with co-writers Brian Johnson and Jenn Johnson, “Precious Love” and the title song. The project ends with the 1873 hymn “It is Well”, written by Horatio G. Spafford.\n\nThis is a wonderful addition to Tomlin’s catalog. My only complaint would be that the production had the crowd’s singing mixed too high. This is appropriate on some songs such as “Is He Worthy? and the closing “It is Well”, but overall, I would have liked Tomlin’s vocals to be more up front in the mix.\n\nUnsung Hero: The Inspired By Soundtrack – For King + Country\n\n***\n\nThis album, by the four-time GRAMMY Award winning duo For King + Country, comprised of brothers Joel and Luke Smallbone, is a collection of songs (covers, previously released songs by the band, etc.), that were inspired by their film Unsung Hero. You can read my review of the film here.\n\nThe album has the band collaborating with a number of artists, including Michael W. Smith, Amy Grant, sister Rebecca St. James, Stryper, Lecrae and more.\n\nBelow are a few comments about each song:\n\nYou’re The Voice – This song was written by Chris Thompson, Andy Qunta and Maggie Ryder. It was recorded in 1986 by Australian singer John Farnam, and in 1991 by Heart. It was covered by Rebecca St. James on her 1996 album God.\n\nPlace In This World – This song was written by Michael W. Smith, Amy Grant, and Wayne Kirkpatrick, and features Michael W. Smith. This was Smith’s biggest mainstream success when his recording of the song hit #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1991.\n\nShe Believes – This song was written by Joel Smallbone. The song was included as “She Believes in Me” on the band’s 2008 debut EP A Tale Of Two Towns.\n\nTo Hell With The Devil (RISE) – This reimagined song is based on the title song from Stryper’s 1986 album. This version was written by Joel Smallbone, Joseph Prielozny, Lecrae, Michael Sweet, Robert Sweet, Tedd T and Dyame. The song features Stryper and Lecrae. The Smallbone’s father David promoted a Stryper tour in Australia when he was a successful concert promoter. For King + Country had previously collaborated with Lecrae a few times, beginning with Lecrae’s 2014 song “Messengers”.\n\nChecking In – This song was written by Garrett Jacobs, Kenneth Cooper Hart and Michael Farren, and features Lee Brice. The song tells the story of a son wrestling with grief about the loss of his father through imagining how he would respond to a voicemail of the father “checking in” with him. The song connects with the film when David is seen grieving over the unexpected death of his father James.\n\nYou Make Everything Beautiful – This song was written by Rebecca St. James, Luke Smallbone, and Fred Williams, and features Rebecca St. James performing her 2011 song.\n\nRhythm Of My Heart – This song was written by John Joseph Capek and Marc Wallace Jordan, made popular by Rod Stewart in 1991.\n\nUnsung Hero (Single Edit) – This song was written by Joel Smallbone, Luke Smallbone, Seth David Mosley, and Federico Vindver. The song was originally released on the band’s 2022 album What Are We Waiting For?\n\nHarmony – This short song was written by Federico Vindver, Aqualung, Seth Mosley, Luke Smallbone, and Joel Smallbone, and features Sleeping At Last. The song was originally released on the band’s 2022 album What Are We Waiting For?\n\nLead Me On – This song was written by Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith and Wayne Kirkpatrick, and features Amy Grant. This is a reimagined version of Grant’s 1988 song. David Smallbone’s promotion of Grant’s failed (in terms of attendance) Australian tour plays a major role in the Smallbone family’s story depicted in the film.\n\nI Surrender All – This hymn was written by Judson W. Van DeVenter in 1896 features Hillary Scott, who had a small role in the film, and Michael W. Smith on piano.\n\nCrazy (Theatrical Version) – This song was written by Guy Sigsworth, and features Rebecca St. James. The song was recorded by Seal in 1991.\n\nI enjoyed the album, especially some of the reimagined songs.\n\nFavorite songs:\n\nPlace in This World\n\nYou Make Everything Beautiful\n\nUnsung Hero\n\nLead Me On\n\nOur God Will Go Before Us: The Hymns of Matt Boswell and Matt Papa Vol. 3\n\n****\n\nWith their third volume of modern hymns in the past five years, Matt Boswell and Matt Papa have served the church well with theologically sound hymns for congregational singing. I have thoroughly enjoyed all three volumes, and this one will again be one of my favorites – perhaps the favorite – albums of the year.\n\nThe album was recorded live at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville at the 2023 Sing! Conference. I enjoy hearing the crowd and conference choir adding their vocals to these songs. You can watch/listen to the performance of each song here.\n\nThere are a few guest artists on the album – Matt Redman, Sandra McCracken, Kristyn Getty, and Michael Cochran.\n\nHere are a few brief comments about each of these twelve hymns:\n\nThe Lord Almighty Reigns – This uplifting song was written by Keith Getty, Kristyn Getty, Matt Boswell, and Matt Papa.

It originally appeared on their album His Mercy is More: The Hymns of Matt Boswell and Matt Papa. The song features Michael Cochren of Cochren & Co. on vocals. The slide guitar gives this version of the song a more country music feel.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nPraise the Lord!\n\nHis mercy is more.\n\nStronger than darkness; new every morn;\n\nOur sins, they are many, His mercy is more\n\nOur God Will Go Before Us – This song was written by Matt Boswell, Keith Getty, and Matt Papa.

It was themes of hope, trust, and comfort.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nNow to the God of every grace\n\nWho counts my tears, who holds my days\n\nI sing through sorrows, sing with faith\n\nO praise the God of every grace\n\nI Know That My Redeemer Lives – This inspiring anthem was written by Kristyn Getty, Jordan Kauflin, Matt Merker, Matt Papa, and Laura Story, and originally appeared on Keith and Kristyn Getty’s album Christ Our Hope in Life and Death. The song builds powerfully as we can sing with confidence that our redeemer lives!\n\nKey lyric:\n\nMy redeemer lives\n\nMy redeemer lives\n\nOn heaven’s throne, and in my very soul\n\nI know that my Redeemer lives\n\nRun and Run (Christ Is All My Righteousness) – This upbeat hymn was written by Matt Boswell and Matt Papa.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nPraise the Lord\n\nOh, my soul, praise the Lord\n\nNow and forevermore my heart confess\n\nChrist is all my righteousness\n\nChrist is all my righteousness\n\nCompletely Known, Completely Loved – This song, which was inspired by the teaching of Tim Keller, was written by Matt Boswell and Matt Papa.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nCompletely known, completely loved\n\nI’m covered by my Savior’s blood\n\nI’m robed in white and God is pleased\n\nTo see His Son, when He looks on me\n\nI enjoyed each of these songs.

The Great Commission World Tour Live – Keith & Kristyn Getty and Friends\n\n****\n\nA live album has been released from the annual Sing! conference each year since the conferences began in 2017. This is probably my favorite of all of those releases. It is billed as Sing! The Great Commission World Tour Live, as it includes songs from Sing! events in Belfast, Singapore and Sydney, in addition to the Sing! Conference in Nashville.\n\nThe album features sixteen songs and two readings, with contributions from Keith and Kristyn Getty, Matt Boswell, Matt Papa, CityAlight, Chris Tomlin, Andrew Peterson and more. Here are a few comments about each song.\n\nAll My Boast Is in Jesus – This song was written by Matt Boswell, Bryan Fowler, Keith Getty, and Matt Papa, and performed by Matt Boswell and Matt Papa.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nAll my boast is in Jesus\n\nAll my hope is His love\n\nAnd I will glory forever\n\nIn what the cross has done\n\nMedley: Lift High the Name of Jesus/Home on the Other Side – This song was written by Keith Getty, Kristyn Getty, Ed Cash, and Fionán de Barra. “Home on the Other Side” incorporates the hymn “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot”.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nOh sing my soul,\n\nAnd tell all He’s done,\n\nTill the earth and heavens are filled with His glory!\n\nIs He Worthy? – This song was written by Andrew Peterson and Ben Shive and performed by Andrew Peterson and Chris Tomlin.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nIs He worthy?

My future wife Tammy, who I had been dating for just over a year, and I sat in the upper balcony behind the stage for the concert. Dylan, as I would later find out he often does, changed many of the song arrangements to the point you didn’t immediately know what they were. Tammy hasn’t yet forgiven me for that night yet. Here is the setlist from that concert.\n\nDylan’s 1978 tour took place after the end of his marriage, and just before his conversion to Christianity in 1979. The 1978 album Bob Dylan at Budokan (never one of my favorites), featured 23 songs from his February 28 and March 1 shows at Tokyo’s Nippon Budokan Hall. This new project includes 56 songs (plus two band introductions), with each concert in their entirety, front to back. Thirty-six of the songs were previously unreleased, and are newly remixed from the original 24-channel analog tapes. The album features dramatically reworked versions of many of Dylan’s best-known songs, including a few new ones from Street Legal, which wouldn’t be released for another four months. His band included background singers (Debi Dye, Jo Ann Harri and Helena Springs) Steve Douglas on saxophone, Bobbye Hall on percussion, Billy Cross on lead guitar, Alan Pasqua on keyboards, multi-instrumentalist David Mansfield, bass Rob Stoner, rhythm guitar Steven Soles, and Ian Wallace on drums. As you might expect, some of the new arrangements work better than others.\n\nThe new project has excellent production quality, and will be enjoyed by fans of Dylan.\n\nCAVES – NEEDTOBREATHE\n\n****\n\nCAVES is NEEDTOBREATHE’s ninth studio album and their first since 2021’s Into the Mystery. The excellent album, which features eleven new songs, was produced by Cason Cooley and the band, and features collaborations with Carly Pearce, Judah & the Lion, Foy Vance, and Old Dominion. NEEDTOBREATHE has been making music for more than twenty years and this new album was my favorite for 2023.\n\nHere are a few comments about each song:\n\nThe Cave – This upbeat opener was written by Bear Rinehart, Josh Lovelace, and Mokita. The song opens with guitar, with the full band kicking in before verse two. The song features a guitar solo. He needs some time to be on his own in a world without a mirror.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nFirst light is coming and there’s\n\nNo more need for hiding\n\nEverknown – This uplifting song was written by Bear Rinehart, Seth Bolt, Josh Lovelace, Tyler Burkum, Chance McCoy, and Mokita. The song is inspired by those in the band’s lives who have helped shape them into the people they are today. The song is dedicated to the humble heroes that don’t get enough credit for the good they have brought to the world.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nYou left us everything, but still you’re leaving us more\n\nHow Wonderful We Are – This love song was written by Bear Rinehart, Josh Lovelace, Tyler Burkum, and Mokita. The song begins with keys, and then backing vocals and drums are added.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nThe hole inside my heart is a place where you fit in\n\nDreams – This upbeat and inspiring song was written by Bear Rinehart, Judah Akers and Mokita, and features Judah & the Lion. The voices of Rinehart and Akers blend well.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nFools like us are only here to prove\n\nYou make dreams come true\n\nWhen You Forgive Someone – This upbeat song about forgiveness was written by Bear Rinehart, Jason Ingram, and Josh Kerr. The song speaks to how forgiveness is not easy. It features some nice guitar, drums and backing vocals.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nOh, when you forgive someone\n\nYou set yourself free\n\nWasting Time – This upbeat song was written by Bear Rinehart, Josh Lovelace, Cason Cooley, and Chance McCoy and features Old Dominion. This song, which will sound great in concert, features a guitar solo, and some nice backing vocals.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nYou can do what you want with your time\n\nBut I don’t wanna waste mine\n\nFall on Me – This love song was written by Bear Rinehart, Jason Ingram and Steven Furtick and features Carly Pearce.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nYou will always be\n\nThe one that I can call\n\nThe safest place to fall\n\nFor me\n\nHideaway – This upbeat love song was written by Bear Rinehart, Trent Dabbs, and Mokita.

The song features guitar and a choir. Rinehart and Dabbs’ voices blend well.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nOh, joy, oh, joy, come roll away\n\nThese temporary tears\n\nFavorite songs:\n\nDreams\n\nWhen You Forgive Someone\n\nWasting Time\n\nBy and By\n\nReaching Out to Find You\n\nTemporary Tears\n\nAccentuate the Positive – Van Morrison\n\n****\n\nVan Morrison returns with Accentuate the Positive, his 45th studio album overall, his twelfth in the past ten years, and second of 2023, following the excellent Moving on Skiffle. Covering nineteen songs made popular by the Everly Brothers, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino and others, the album finds Morrison returning to one of his childhood passions, this time to rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nWith Morrison’s voice in top form, backed by his excellent band and background singers, this album is a lot of fun. As one reviewer wrote, it was if they were hanging around the studio having a party playing music they love without knowing the tapes were running.\n\nMorrison is joined on guitar by Jeff Beck on one of his last studio performances on “Lonesome Train”, on which Chris Farlowe adds vocals. Taj Mahal joins Morrison on “Lucille” and “Shake, Rattle and Roll”.\n\nMy favorite songs on the album are:\n\nYou Are My Sunshine\n\nFlip, Flop and Fly\n\nProblems\n\nThe Shape I’m In\n\nLonesome Train\n\nShakin’ All Over\n\nBye Bye Johnny\n\nShake, Rattle and Roll\n\nLive from the Farewell Tour – Third Day\n\n****\n\nThird Day was one of my favorite bands, and I was fortunate to see them in concert a few times. They were an excellent live band, as they demonstrate on this album.\n\nTheir final concert was at the Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado on June 27, 2018. This album, produced by Scotty Wilbanks, the band’s long-time touring keyboardist, was recorded in a number of locations on their farewell tour (Atlanta, Houston, Red Rocks, etc.). The album was originally available only to Third Day’s fan club members but was recently released on digital platforms.\n\nThird Day featured the powerful voice of Mac Powell, who has gone on to have a successful solo career. This album features a wide selection of songs from Third Day’s career and will be enjoyed by all Third Day fans.\n\nHere are the songs included on the album:\n\nConsuming Fire\n\nMy Hope Is You\n\nSky Falls Down\n\nI’ve Always Loved You\n\nKing of Glory\n\nThief\n\nShow Me Your Glory\n\nSing A Song\n\nI Got a Feeling\n\nTunnel\n\nCry Out to Jesus\n\nRevelation\n\nOtherside\n\nChildren of God\n\nI Need a Miracle\n\nBlackbird/Gone\n\nFarewell Medley\n\nGod of Wonders/Agnus Dei\n\nHoneysuckle Switches: The Songs of Lucinda Williams – Amos Lee\n\n*** ½\n\nAmos Lee has been one of my favorite singer/songwriters since I saw him open for Bob Dylan back in 2007. After Lee released his 2022 album Dreamland, one of my favorites that year, he revisited his songwriting hero Lucinda Williams – the musician he describes as “unapologetically sincere” and “a spiritual guide for me.” Lee now pays homage to Williams with a full album of eleven covers from her songbook – Honeysuckle Switches: The Songs of Lucinda Williams. Lee became a fan of Williams as a teenager in Philadelphia, discovering her music on the radio. They would meet in person years later and collaborated on “Clear Blue Eyes,” a song from Lee’s 2011 album Mission Bell.\n\nHoneysuckle Switches is Lee’s second recent covers album. Late in 2022, Lee released My Ideal: A Tribute to Chet Baker Sings, a tribute to the jazz musician, another of Lee’s musical heroes. A new album of original music is due in 2024, which will feature a few songs he sang on his recent solo tour, which made a local stop.\n\nLee has said that Williams’ songs have provided a steady source of inspiration for his own songwriting. He has returned to her songbook repeatedly as he has reckoned with grief over the last year, saying she “embraces sadness but is never enveloped by it.” The songs included on the album were selected for how they made Lee feel, and because they made him feel.\n\nThe album was recorded at Lee’s home. His soulful performances are beautiful, with his tender and expressive vocals, acoustic guitar, piano, light percussion and backing vocals, but the real power is in letting Williams’ lyrics and melodies work their magic. Although I was not familiar with Williams’ music, I enjoyed Lee’s interpretation of these songs.\n\nFavorite songs:\n\nGet Right with God\n\nGreenville\n\nLittle Angel, Little Brother\n\nEvery Christmas – Michael W. Smith\n\n***\n\nMichael W. Smith returns with a new full-length Christmas album, his sixth Christmas project, titled Every Christmas. The album includes six songs from his 2022 EP Christmas at Home, along with six new songs. Smith co-produced the album with son Tyler Michael Smith. This is really a family project. Smith’s daughters Whitney Mooring and Anna Smith are featured throughout, along with his 17 grandchildren. The album features beautiful orchestration throughout.\n\nHere are a few comments about each song on the album:\n\nThe Night Before… – This is a brief instrumental featuring piano and orchestration.\n\nChristmas Is Here – This song was written by Smith and daughter Anna Bovi, and features piano, a chorus of all of his grandchildren, and an orchestral arrangement done by Smith’s son, Tyler.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nRing, ring all the bells\n\nAngels rejoice\n\nRedemption upon us\n\nHere With Us – This beautiful song begins and features an orchestra (strings and horns) and a choir.

The song has Smith looking back on past Christmases. Like many of us, looking back can bring back memories of those who are no longer with us. The beautiful song features strings, piano, backing vocals and a choir.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nSometime every Christmas\n\nCan’t say where or when or why\n\nBut some moment or some memory\n\nTakes me by surprise\n\nAnd something in the season\n\nWells up in my eye\n\nSometime every Christmas\n\nI cry\n\nHow Great Our Joy – This is a traditional German Christmas carol. The song features a choir, strings and horns.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nHow great our joy! Great our joy!\n\nJoy, joy, joy! Joy, joy, joy!\n\nPraise we the Lord in heav’n on high!\n\nPraise we the Lord in heav’n on high!\n\nFreeze The Frame – This song was written by Smith and Tony Wood.

Sessions: Doxology – Keith and Kristyn Getty and Friends\n\n****\n\nThis is the second album of music released from the 2022 Sing! Conference. (Read my reflections from the conference here, and my review of the first album\n\nSing! Christ Our Hope In Life And Death: Live At The Getty Music Worship Conference here).\n\nThe songs on this album focus on doxology, hymns of praise to God. As with everything the Getty’s do, they are done with excellence (songwriting, musicianship and production). In addition to Keith and Kristyn Getty, artists featured on the album include Kirk Whalum, Blair Linne, Jordan Kauflin, Skye Peterson, Laura Story, the Foto Sisters, Bryan Fowler, Matt Merker and Bill Gaither.\n\nHere are a few comments about each of the ten songs:\n\nAll People That on Earth Do Dwell – The music of this hymn is from the French-German Psalter (1551), and the lyrics are from William Kethe. This hymn, based on Psalm 100 concludes with the Trinitarian Doxology. The music was arranged by English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 This choral number was my wife’s favorite moment from the conference.\n\nPsalm 24 – Blair Linne gives an excellent reading of Psalm 24, backed by saxophone from Kirk Whalum and piano.\n\nI Will Wait for You (Psalm 130) – This song was written by Jordan Kauflin, Matt Merker, Keith Getty, and Stuart Townend. The song features Jordan Kauflin and Kristyn Getty on vocals, and Kirk Whalum on saxophone.\n\nOn Jordan’s Stormy Banks – This song was written by Samuel Stennett and Christopher Miner.

The 2024 Sing! Conference, with a theme of “The Songs of the Bible”, will be held in Nashville September 3-5. Go here for more information.\n\nMoving on Skiffle – Van Morrison\n\n****\n\nThe prolific 77-year-old Morrison returns with his second double album in three years, with a solo album in between, his 43rd studio album overall. Moving on Skiffle includes skiffle-influenced covers of 23 blues, country, folk, gospel, and jazz songs. Skiffle combined folk, blues, country, bluegrass and jazz played with a mixture of homemade or improvised instruments (washboards, jugs, washtub bass, etc.). Morrison has previously explored the sounds of his youth in the mid-1950’s Belfast on his 2000 album The Skiffle Sessions: Live in Belfast with Lonnie Donegan and Chris Barber, a favorite of mine.\n\nMorrison, who produced the album, seems to be having a great time with these mostly upbeat songs. There is great passion and energy in the music. In addition to his own guitar, sax and harmonica, Morrison is backed by an excellent band featuring Dave Keary on guitar, Pete Hurley on bass, Colin Griffin on drums, Sticky Wicket on washboard, and Seth Lakeman on fiddle. Background vocals are contributed by Crawford Bell, Dana Masters and Jolene O’Hara.\n\nThere are many highlights on the excellent album, which features several references to trains, including Hank Snow’s “I’m Moving On”. A favorite is Morrison’s version of Woody Guthrie’s “Worried Man Blues”. The gospel standard “This Little Light of Mine” an anthem of the Civil Rights movement in 1960’s, is transformed into the upbeat “This Loving Light of Mine”. “Freight Train”, another highlight, is a song which was originally written by Elizabeth Cotten and then recorded by both Peggy Seeger and Chas McDevitt. “Streamline Train” was written in the 1930s by the Mississippi bluesman Red Nelson, the song was a hit by The Vipers Skiffle Group in 1957. The album closes with the nine-minute “Green Rocky Road”, written by Len Chandler and Robert Kaufman, recorded by Dave Von Ronk and featured in the film Inside Llewyn Davis.\n\nShadow Kingdom – Bob Dylan\n\n****\n\nIn May 2021, not able to tour due to the pandemic, Bob Dylan offered a pay for view “concert” titled Shadow Kingdom: The Early Songs of Bob Dylan. It was directed by Alma Har’el and billed as a live, pay-per-view concert. Set in a fictitious Marseilles bar called the Bon Bon Club, the event was actually a performance of a studio recording, with musicians – Alex Burke, Buck Meek, Joshua Crumbly (guitars), Shahzad Ismaily (accordion) and Janie Cowan (upright bass) – playing the roles of the actual personnel who recorded the original music with Dylan.\n\nThe new Shadow Kingdom album features thirteen songs from the film and an instrumental piece called ‘Sierra’s Theme,’ which played over the film’s closing credits. The personnel on the album are – Dylan (vocals, harmonica), Jeff Taylor (accordion), Greg Leisz (pedal steel guitar, mandolin), Tim Pierce, T-Bone Burnett, Ira Ingber (guitars) and Don Was (upright bass). There are no drums or piano.\n\nThe songs included (see below) span from 1965 to 1989. The earliest is “It’s All Over, Baby Blue” from Bringing It All Back Home, and the most recent track is “What Was It You Wanted” from Oh Mercy. Dylan’s voice sounds great, better than it has in years, as he reinvents these songs, both musically and at times lyrically, not unlike what U2 did recently on Songs of Surrender. The songs included are both well-known (“Forever Young”), and obscure (“To Be Alone With You”). “Tombstone Blues” is slowed down, reminding me of his vocal on “Murder Most Foul,” while “I’ll Be Your Baby Tonight” begins as a rocker and then slows down as a blues song. The band backing Dylan is excellent. The production is clear. I thoroughly enjoyed this new release.\n\nThe songs included on the project are:\n\nWhen I Paint My Masterpiece\n\nMost Likely You Go Your Way (and I’ll Go Mine)\n\nQueen Jane Approximately\n\nI’ll Be Your Baby Tonight\n\nJust Like Tom Thumb’s Blues\n\nTombstone Blues\n\nTo Be Alone With You\n\nWhat Was It You Wanted\n\nForever Young\n\nPledging My Time\n\nThe Wicked Messenger\n\nWatching the River Flow\n\nIt’s All Over Now, Baby Blue\n\nSierra’s Theme (instrumental)\n\nLive from Red Rocks – Mac Powell\n\n****\n\nThis six-song (plus an acoustic request segment) EP from Mac Powell features two Third Day songs (“Soul on Fire”, “God of Wonders”), two songs from Powell’s New Creation album (“New Creation”, “River of Life”), one song from Mac Powell and the Family Reunion’s album Back Again (“Flood Waters”), and a cover of “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac. The project was recorded at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado in August 2022 during the K-Love Presents Live at Red Rocks.\n\nI saw Third Day live three times as well as Powell with the Family Reunion once. He has always been excellent in a live setting, and this new project is no exception. Clocking in at just 30 minutes, Live from Red Rocks leaves you wanting more.\n\nSimple Songs for Young and Old – CityAlight****\n\nCityAlight is a music ministry from St. Paul’s Castle Hill, a church in Castle Hill, Sydney. The vision of CityAlight is to write songs with biblically rich lyrics and simple melodies for the Christian church to sing.\n\nSimple Songs for Young and Old is a new EP consisting of six songs. CityAlight has stated that these are not songs only for children or only for adults. They are written to resource adults and children, singing together. Their prayer is that these songs might be a blessing in churches, Sunday schools, morning breakfasts, car rides to school and work, by the bedside, and in private prayer.\n\nHere are a few brief comments about each song on this excellent new collection:\n\nHe Calls Me Friend – This joyful song about Jesus calling us friend was written by Harrison Druery, Michael Farren, Jonny Robinson, and Rich Thompson. This was the second single released ahead of the release of the EP. The song is led by keys, and joined by bass, drums and backing vocals.

The album, which was produced by Steve Marcia, was recorded live at the Mission in San Capistrano, California, a house of worship first established in 1776.\n\nAmong the themes on the album include Jesus’s sacrifice on the cross, the goodness of Jesus’s heart, the grace of Jesus, the unconditional love, hope and joy of God, the holiness of God, praising God when the blessings flow and when it seems they don’t, and worshipping God no matter what comes.\n\nThe album features three versions of the song “Son of Suffering” and a new version of Redman’s classic “Heart of Worship.”\n\nBelow are a few comments about each song on this excellent new album\n\nThe Praise Is Yours – This song was written by Redman, Andi Rozier, Joshua Seller, and Travis Ryan.

To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of their breakthrough album The Beautiful Letdown, the band has completely re-recorded the album and released it as The Beautiful Letdown (Our Version). The band’s fourth studio album was released February 25, 2003 and has sold over three million copies. It features the popular songs “Meant to Live” and “Dare You to Move”.\n\nThis is not like U2 reimagining their songs on their recent Songs of Surrender album. There are not major changes to the songs here. There are a few minor lyric changes on “Gone”: “Al Pacino’s cash” is now “Al Capone’s cash“, “Lexus cages” is now “Tesla cages“, and “my high school sweets” is now “my high school sweethearts.”\n\nThis re-recording sounds great with a clean mix, and these songs remind me of why Switchfoot became one of my favorite bands in the first place.\n\nThe celebrate the anniversary of the album the band will be playing the album in its entirety for the first time on their current tour.

The record, Dylan’s thirtieth studio album, picked up three Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, in 1998. Time Out of Mind was also the last album Dylan made with a producer, in this case Daniel Lanois.\n\nThe Deluxe edition contains sixty songs, clocking in at more than six hours. It follows the evolution of songs written for the album, from the previously unreleased 1996 Teatro sessions through live versions from 1998-2001. It begins with a 2022 remix of the original album by Michael Brauer. Rare outtakes and alternate versions of songs written for the album include four original Dylan compositions – “Dreamin’ of You,” “Red River Shore,” “Mississippi” (later re-recorded for Love and Theft in 2001) and “Marchin’ to the City” – not included on the original 1997 album. A fifth unreleased performance is Dylan’s interpretation of “The Water is Wide,” a traditional folk song of Scottish origin. Twelve songs included here were previously available on The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs.\n\nI enjoyed hearing the alternate versions of the songs from Time Out of Mind, some of which were very different from the version released on the 1997 album.\n\nThis release will be enjoyed by Dylan fans. All of the alternate versions/outtakes may be a bit much for some. For those, I highly recommend the remix of the original album by Michael Brauer.\n\nSing! Christ Our Hope in Life and Death. Live at the Getty Worship Music Conference – Keith & Kristyn Getty and Friends\n\n****\n\nThis excellent live album is from the 2022 Sing! Getty Worship Conference, which had a theme of “Christ Our Hope in Life and Death”. The twelve songs were pulled from a wonderful conference that took place at the Gaylord Opryland Convention Center and the Grand Ole Opry over three days last September in Nashville. (Read my Reflections from the conference here).\n\nIn addition to Keith & Kristyn Getty and their incredible band, this album features Blessing Offor, Shane and Shane, CityAlight, Skye Peterson, Matt Papa, Matt Boswell, Bob Kauflin, Jordan Kauflin, Sandra McCracken, Joni Eareckson Tada, Matt Merker, Kirk Whalum and others.\n\nIt had to be hard to pick just a few songs among the many highlights from the conference.

NF has built a loyal following that has earned him over 30 billion global streams on music platforms.\n\nThemes on the excellent new album include taking the reins of his life, staying true to himself, faith, overcoming odds, relationships (his mother, wife, child, and a failed relationship), being a lonely soul, being at the top of his game, and running from darkness and depression. There are two guest artists on the album – Cordae and Julie Michaels.\n\nHere are a few brief comments about each song:\n\nHOPE – This song, which was the lead single for the album, was written by NF and Tommee Profitt. It was produced by NF, Profitt and Jeff Sojka. The hard-hitting song features keys, strings, bass, and percussion. He addresses dreaming big, regret, growing pains, his son, his former self and ends by saying that he is taking the reins of his life. Watch the video for “HOPE”.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nI’m a prime example of what happens when you choose to not accept defeat and face your demons.\n\nMOTTO – This song was written and produced by NF and Tommee Profitt. The song features keys, strings, drums, and a memorable chorus. He addresses industry expectations but would rather stay true to himself than chase “success” in the music industry.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nYou heard the sayin’, “If it ain’t broke\n\nDon’t fix it,” that’s my motto.\n\nCAREFUL – This hard-hitting song was written by NF, Cordae and David Garcia and produced by NF and Garcia. The song features Cordae and a bass beat. NF and Cordae trade verses about overcoming odds, protecting their family, feeling blessed and taking risks.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nI was talkin’ to God ’bout what’s real or what’s not\n\nAll He said was, “Remain faithful.”\n\nMAMA – This song was written and produced by NF, Tommee Profitt and Saint X. In this song, NF addresses his mother who died from drug abuse when he was young. He prays that she has found peace in heaven, and he wants her to know that he loves her. The mid-tempo song features keys and drums.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nIs He standin’ in front of you so you can look at His face?\n\nWhen you talk to Him, does He talk back?\n\nYou ever have conversations about what you regret?\n\nOr did it all go away once you got there?\n\nHAPPY – This song was written by NF and Tommee Profitt and produced by NF, Profitt and Jeff Sojka. The song is a painfully honest prayer, with NF indicating that it has been a few years since he has talked to God. He’s a lonely soul and knows he needs help, but he just can’t imagine who he’d been if he was happy. The music is upbeat, in contrast to the lyrics, and has a pop element, with strings, keys, drums and a memorable chorus.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nHanging by a thread’s how I live\n\nI don’t know why, but I feel more comfortable.\n\nPANDEMONIUM – This song was written by NF and Tommee Profitt and produced by NF, Profitt and Jeff Sojka. This hard-hitting song features electronic percussion.\n\nHis confidence in his music is at the highest level. He’s successful and blessed.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nWhat’s the latest trend?\n\nI don’t have a clue, I don’t follow them\n\nThey just follow me, keep ’em on the edge\n\nKeep ’em on they toes, keep ’em wonderin’\n\nSUFFICE – This song was written and produced by NF, Tommie Profitt and Saint X. The song features drums and keys. He’s better than ever. It didn’t happen overnight, and you shouldn’t bet against him. Life is a gift, and he wants to live it to the fullest while he can.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nMediocre, that just won’t suffice\n\nGONE – This song was written by NF, Tommee Profitt and Julia Michaels and produced by NF and Profitt. The slower paced song features Julia Michaels. The song about a failed relationship features excellent vocals. The song features keys, and drums.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nI pray, someday\n\nYou find yourself\n\nSomehow, someway\n\nWith someone else\n\nBULLET – This song was written by NF, Tommee Profitt and Saint X, and produced by NF, Profitt, Saint X and Jeff Sojka. The song is dedicated to NF’s wife, Bridgette Doremus. He assures her that he would do anything for her, even taking a bullet for her. The mid-tempo joyful song features drums and keys.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nI would take a bullet, give my life in a second if it came down to it\n\nSacrifice anything to see the light in your eyes, I swear I’d do it\n\nTURN MY BACK – This song was written and produced by NF, Saint X and David Garcia. The song features keys and drums. He doesn’t need anybody’s help. He’s at the top of his game. It’s God’s plan. Got a problem with him, take it up with God.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nNeed grace, need love, need God, need faith\n\nMISTAKE – This intimate song was written and produced by NF and Tommee Profitt. The song features keys and strings. He admits that he’s made mistakes, and has qualities he’s not proud of, but he’s trying his best.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nMistake, might’ve made some\n\nCan’t argue with that, but I ain’t one\n\nLET EM PRAY – This hard-hitting song was written by NF, Tommee Profitt and Saint X. The song was produced by NF, Profitt, Saint X and Jeff Sojka. The song features synth and drums. The song is about others praying for his downfall.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nLife is precious, life is treacherous\n\nLife is filled with dead-end roads\n\nKeep on pushin’, keep on healin’\n\nSee you prayin’ on my downfall\n\nGo on, keep on prayin’, God ain’t listenin’ to you\n\nRUNNING – This song was written and produced by NF and David Garcia. The song has NF addressing his darkness. The song features acoustic guitar, which later builds with synth and drums. He no longer wants to continue carrying the weight of his depression and darkness. There’s happiness on the horizon.\n\nKey lyric:\n\nI love you to death, but I\n\nCan’t spend the rest of my\n\nLife in this darkness, I’m\n\nDone\n\nFavorite Songs\n\nHOPE\n\nMOTTO\n\nMAMA\n\nHAPPY\n\nMISTAKE\n\nSongs of Surrender – U2\n\n***\n\nU2’s first album since 2017’s Songs of Experience reimagines forty songs from the band’s catalog (only 1981’s October and 2009’s No Line on the Horizon have no songs represented here). The album, which runs nearly three hours, is connected to Bono’s excellent 2022 memoir Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story (read my review of that book here), whose forty chapters are titled after U2 songs. The new album has a different selection of songs, curated by The Edge, with twelve of the songs differing from the Bono book chapters.\n\nThe album was The Edge’s COVID lockdown project. He is the album’s primary producer, with a few others, notably Bob Ezrin, assisting. The Edge compiled the songs and the project is arranged into individual band member volumes. The Edge, who also handles lead vocals on four songs, has stated that Songs of Surrender was made with the awareness that most people listen to their music through earbuds now.\n\nThe songs really are reimagined, they are not just unplugged versions. In the liner notes, The Edge writes “Once we surrendered our reverence for the original version, each song started to open up to a new authentic voice of this time. Some of the songs feature rewritten lyrics. For example, “Walk On” is written in light of the Ukraine war. “Pride (In the Name of Love)”, replaces “One man betrayed by a kiss”, with “One boy never will be kissed”. The song arrangements are mostly intimate and acoustic, frequently replacing Edge’s electric guitars with quiet keyboards. The Edge, playing numerous instruments, Bono’s voice and the lyrics are in the forefront here. Many of the tracks feature no rhythm section at all, leaving bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr. to apparently sit them out.\n\nThis is an ambitious project for the band, which has continued with their original four members since 1976. These new versions of both well-known songs and more obscure ones may initially be hard for long-time fans to hear. Some songs fare better than others in their reimagined state. I encourage you to give them a chance. It may be unlikely that the new versions will replace the original, but some may very well stand on their own. And a new album, titled Songs of Ascent, is reportedly in the works.\n\nFavorite songs\n\nEvery Breaking Wave\n\nWho’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\n\nGet Out Of Your Own Way\n\nRed Hill Mining Town\n\nVertigo\n\nOrdinary Love\n\nInvisible\n\nSong for Someone\n\nCedarwood Road\n\nI Will Follow\n\n40\n\nMy Ideal: A Tribute to Chet Baker Sings – Amos Lee\n\n*** ½\n\nI’ve been a fan of Amos Lee’s music since he opened a local concert for Bob Dylan back in 2007, and I got to meet him briefly in the lobby during intermission. This new 16-song collection, Lee’s ninth studio album, and the follow-up to his earlier 2022 album, the excellent Dreamland, pays tribute to his musical hero and his deep jazz roots.\n\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lee lost two of his mentors—Bill Withers and John Prine. During this period, Lee turned to the album Chet Baker Sings for comfort. My Ideal is his tribute to that music and the meaning it held for him: a song-for-song cover of Chet Baker’s 1954 original, which in 2001 received the Grammy Hall of Fame Award. Lee considers Baker to be his lifelong musical hero, crediting him with changing his life and trajectory as an artist.\n\nThe tribute album, which is beautifully performed and produced, features Lee with pianist and trumpeter David Streim, bassist Madison Rast, and drummer Anwar Marshall, and is intended to remind Lee’s fans of the early days of his career playing as an artist on jazz label Blue Note Records. Lee gets to show off his incredibly vocals on this album. At times the combo reminds me of jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi’s A Charlie Brown Christmas (and that’s a compliment, as I love that album).\n\nI was not previously familiar with Baker’s music. It is rare that another artist would cover a complete album by another artist. The album will most likely not be a big seller, but it is done with excellence and hopefully will expand Lee’s audience.\n\nHere is the track list for My Ideal:\n\nThat Old Feeling\n\nIt’s Always You\n\nLike Someone In Love\n\nMy Ideal\n\nI’ve Never Been In Love Before\n\nMy Buddy\n\nBut Not For Me\n\nTime After Time\n\nI Get Along Without You Very Well\n\nMy Funny Valentine (For Oskar and Eli)\n\nThere Will Never Be Another You\n\nThe Thrill Is Gone\n\nI Fall In Love Too Easily\n\nLook For The Silver Lining\n\nEverything Happens To Me\n\nI’m Old Fashioned\n\nBellsburg: The Songs of Rich Mullins – Various Artists\n\n****\n\nRich Mullins went home to be with the Lord following an accident near Lostant, Illinois on I-39 on September 19, 1997, on the way to a benefit concert in Wichita, Kansas, where he lived. Mitch McVicker was also in the vehicle, and though badly injured, he would survive. To commemorate the 25th year of Mullins’ homegoing, a new double-length album of his songs has been released. The album (and future documentary) was recorded in the living room of Mullins’ old house in Bellsburg, Tennessee, where he often crafted songs on the same piano that his parents acquired by trading for a cow from the family farm. Each of the 16 new folk/acoustic interpretations of recordings are by artists who were greatly impacted by the original versions. Each of the artists featured in the project has a personal connection with Mullins or has been deeply influenced by his music. Each side of the project ends with an original, never commercially released demo from Mullins.\n\nThe 18-track album was recorded with sparse arrangements, in some cases one voice and one instrument, so that the energy and passion of each artist (and Mullins’ lyrics) are out front. You will also occasionally hear some banter from the artists. The album was produced by Chris Hoisington, Andrew Greer served as co-producer, executive producer, Evan Sieling was co-producer and mixing, Anthony Hoisington was executive producer, Dave Trout was supervising producer, and Connie Hawk and David McCracken were special coordinators.\n\nAmong the many artists on the album are Andrew Peterson, Ashley Cleveland, Amy Grant, Kevin Max, Ben Shive, Mitch McVicker, Jimmy Abegg, Sara Groves and Audrey Assad.\n\nI really enjoyed listening to this project. Some of the songs are well known while others are not.\n\nHere is the tracklist for the project:\n\nHello Old Friends – Andrew Peterson, featuring Andy Gullabhorn and Ben Shive\n\nYou Did Not Have a Home – Kevin Max, featuring Mitch McVicker\n\nBoth Feet on the Ground – Ashley Cleveland\n\nHeaven is Waiting – Brothers McClurg\n\nSparrow Watcher – Amy Grant, Cindy Morgan and Andrew Greer, featuring Tommy Sims\n\nIf I Stand – Steve Cudworth\n\nI See You – Audrey Assad\n\nSometimes by Step – Iam Zumback, featuring Ron Block\n\nHold Me Jesus – Sara Groves, featuring Bonnie Keen and Andrew Greer\n\nWhitewater – Rich Mullins\n\nHere in America – Jason Gray, featuring Kipper Gray and Jimmy Abegg\n\nMy Deliverer – Mitch McVicker\n\nCalling Our Your Name – Andrew Osenga and Taylor Leonhardt\n\nBound to Come Some Trouble – Steven McWhirter and Jason Clayborn\n\nHard to Get – David Mullins, featuring Jonathan Mullins\n\nWhitewater – Carolyn Arends\n\nWe Are Not As Strong As We Think We Are – Derek Webb\n\nHoly Pretenders – Rich Mullins\n\nWatch the trailer for the project here.\n\nThe Stories I Tell Myself – Matt Maher\n\n****\n\nI was introduced to Matt Maher’s music when he opened for TobyMac several years ago.

I say surprise, because we saw them on their Into the Mystery Acoustic Tour in Peoria just eleven days before this project was released, and the band made no mention of this impending release.\n\nNEEDTOBREATHE is an excellent, high energy live band. This is the band’s fourth live album, and second in two years. The twenty-five songs here span their career. Highlights include “Carry Me”, featuring Jon Foreman of Switchfoot and “I Will Remember” featuring Carrie Underwood.\n\nIf you are not familiar with NEEDTOBREATHE, this would serve as an excellent introduction to the band.\n\nWatch the entire concert film here.\n\nDreamland (Deluxe Edition) – Amos Lee\n\n*** ½\n\nAmos Lee’s Dreamland was one of my favorite albums of 2022.
