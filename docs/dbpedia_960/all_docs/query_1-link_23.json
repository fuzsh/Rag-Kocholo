        "text": "Live Worship From Vertical Church is the debut album from the worship team rooted in Chicago’s Harvest Bible Chapel. Comprised of worship leaders Andi Rozier, Meredith Andrews, Lindsay McCaul, Jacob Sooter, Seth McConkey and Kyle Fredricks, the songs on Live Worship From Vertical Church take the listener on a journey of gathering to worship (“Open Up The Heavens,” “Light Shine In”), testimony of God’s work in our lives (“Greatness Of Our God,” “All Glory”), and ultimately adoration and praise (“Word Of God,” “God, You Are My God”). The album was recorded at Harvest Bible Chapel’s new downtown Chicago campus within the walls of a cathedral; one of the few buildings to survive the great Chicago fire.\n\nOne of most moving moments on the album is “All Glory” which is sung by Tony & GRAMMY Award winner Heather Headley. A worship leader at Harvest Bible Chapel, Heather’s song “All Glory” will be project’s first radio single.. Other guests on the album include producers and songwriters Jason Ingram and Paul Mabury, of One Sonic Society.\n\nThere will be a full-fledged marketing campaign to support the album including radio singles, a 30-city tour starting on street date that will include Pastor, author, radio personality and speaker James MacDonald, appearances at fall worship conferences, and an aggressive campaign to promote songs to churches via CCLI, Worship Leader, Praise Charts, EssentialWorship.com, and more."
