Brooks, who died on July 16, 2024, at age 62. The nature of his illness and cause of death were not disclosed.\n\nBishop Brooks was a founding member of Commissioned in 1982 alongside Fred Hammond, Mitchell Jones, Keith Staten, Karl Reid, and Michael Williams. He was known for his multifaceted talents as a songwriter, musician (keyboard/piano/organ), and producer who helped craft Commissioned’s signature sound.\n\nIn 1986, Brooks founded the all-female contemporary gospel group Witness, of which his future wife Lisa Page was an original member. (Many years later, the lineup would include their daughter and future Sunday Best winner, Tasha Page.) Witness became known for their powerful vocals and impactful songs under Brooks’s songwriting and production, further solidifying his legacy in the gospel music industry. He went on to produce and write for his wife’s solo projects and is credited for his work with a number of other artists as well, including Lexi, Young Artist for Christ Workshop, The Nation, and his own Michael Brooks & Royal Priesthood.\n\nLeft to right: Debut albums by Commissioned (I’m Going On), Witness (Keep Looking Up), and Lisa Page (More Than You’ll Ever Know).\n\nIn addition to musical endeavors, Bishop Brooks and Lisa pastored Restoration Fellowship Church International in Redford, MI, a ministry he founded.\n\nGMF extends its deepest condolences to Brooks’ wife of 27 years, Pastor Lisa Page Brooks; their children Tasha, LaTia, Sateara, Justin, Jessica, and the entire family; Restoration Fellowship Church International; and all who were touched by his music and ministry.\n\nA tribute concert is set to take place Thursday, July 25, at 7 p.m. The homegoing service is Friday, July 26, at 11 a.m. Both services will be held at Christian Tabernacle in Southfield.\n\nEditor’s Note: An earlier version of this article inadvertently omitted Bishop Brooks’ daughter Jessica. GMF apologizes for the oversight.

He collapsed during a service at Greater Deliverance Temple in Danville, VA, where he was celebrating 15 years as the church’s pastor.\n\nBishop Brown was renowned for his contributions to gospel music. His earliest professional recording as a featured soloist dates back to 1988 on Rev. Charles Nicks Presents the Baptist Assembly of Free Spirit Churches Mass Choir, Volume 2, with the song “Victory.” Over the years, he recorded several solo projects. His latest solo single “My Turn Around,” was released in September 2023. He also guest appeared on recordings with GMWA, Youthful Praise, the late Rev. Timothy Wright, and most recently, Brian Spriggs & Nu Worship. Spriggs’ album, The Art of Choir Music, was released Friday, July 5, featuring the beloved preacher and singer on the track “I’ll Make It.”\n\nBrown’s most well-known musical partnership was alongside his longtime close friend, Bishop Hezekiah Walker and Love Fellowship. Brown was the featured vocalist on many of the Love Fellowship choir projects, leading such favorites as “The Lord Will Make A Way Somehow,” “Make It to That City,” “Never Leave Me Alone,” “I Will Fight,” and “Lord Do It.”\n\nIn 2018, Brown was elevated to the office of bishop. At the time of his passing, he served on the executive council of the Covenant Keepers International Alliance (CKIA), presided over by Bishop Walker. In a heartfelt statement released Sunday night, Walker described Brown as a “beloved friend and brother… [who] … has walked with me for over 40 years doing the Lord’s work in the United States and around the world.”\n\nGMF extends its deepest condolences to Bishop Brown’s immediate and extended family, Greater Deliverance Temple, Bishop Hezekiah Walker, Love Fellowship, CKIA, and the entire gospel community. In tribute, a segment of this past Monday’s Gospel Music Fever Radio Show on KWAY-db Gospel Station was dedicated to his memory.\n\nEvents to Honor Bishop Brown’s Life\n\nSeveral celebrations honoring Bishop Brown’s life have been announced.\n\nThe victory celebration and public viewing is set for Friday, July 26, at 7 p.m., at Bibleway Cathedral, 215 Grant St. in Danville.\n\nThe national celebration and official homegoing service takes place Saturday, July 27, at 11 a.m., also at Bibleway Cathedral.\n\nAn additional national celebration, “The Praise Finale,” is being held Sunday, July 28, at 6 p.m., at Pilgrim Renaissance Center in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nMore event details are on the revised flyer below.\n\nOn Monday, July 22, Elder Timothy Womack of Greater Deliverance Temple shared via social media, “Please denote change of venue for Friday evening service. At 7pm, the service will be held at Bibleway. Please remember the viewing from 3pm-5pm is for the members of GDT only along with the invited guest[s] of the Brown family (no exceptions!!!). Everyone is welcome to Bibleway at 7pm!!!!!!”\n\nThis article was last updated on Monday, July 22, 2024, at 7:45 p.m.\n\nLibra Nicole Boyd, PhD is a musician, award-winning author, gospel music aficionado, and the founder and editor of Gospel Music Fever™.
