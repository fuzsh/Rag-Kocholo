        "text": "The Gospel Music Association released this year’s nominees for the 55th Annual Dove Awards on July 24.\n\nBill Gaither, singer and songwriter with the Gaither Vocal Band, was part of a small group that first presented the concept for the Dove Awards at a GMA board meeting in 1968. The group was rounded out with Les Beasley, who was lead singer for Florida Boys; Bob McConnell, who was art director and designer for Benson Records from the 1960s to the 1980s; and Bob Benson, whose family started a publishing company for southern gospel artists.\n\n“The idea was to create an award with a descending dove to represent the dove from when Jesus was baptized,” McConnell said.\n\nThe same statue that was sketched by McConnell is the same award used today.\n\nProcess\n\nLike many media-related awards programs such as the Oscars and the Emmys, the awards are an involved process that starts as a submission, then goes to a screening and is finalized through a first and second ballot, voted on by members of GMA. This schedule begins in February of each year.\n\nAfter meeting the qualifications for an entry to be screened, it goes to the Dove screening committee, made up of more than 50 industry leaders. After passing the screening stage, GMA professional members vote, which creates the list of official nominees.\n\nIn August of each year the nominees are voted on again by GMA professional members to make up the list of winners, which aren’t announced until the live show held in late September or early October of each year.\n\nThis year’s GMA Dove Awards live show will be held at the Allen Arena in Nashville on Oct. 1 and will be hosted by Tauren Wells, a contemporary Christian singer, songwriter and pastor.\n\nNominees for this year can be found here.\n\nCapitol Christian Music Group 2024 GMA Dove Award nominees:\n\nSong of the Year:\n\n“All Things”– Writer: Kirk Franklin\n\n“Firm Foundation (He Won’t)” – Writers: Cody Carnes, Austin Davis, Chandler Moore\n\n“Holy Forever” – Writers: Chris Tomlin, Jason Ingram, Brian Johnson, Jenn Johnson, Phil Wickham\n\n“I Believe It (The Life of Jesus)” – Writers: Daniel Carson, Jess Cates, David Leonard, Jon Reddick, Jonathan Smith\n\n“More Than Able” – Writers: Ben Fielding, Chandler Moore, Steven Furtick, Naomi Raine\n\n“Praise” – Writers: Pat Barrett, Cody Carnes, Chandler Moore, Brandon Lake, Steven Furtick, Chris Brown\n\n“Praise You Anywhere”- Writers: Ben Fielding, Hank Bentley , Jacob Sooter, Brandon Lake\n\n“Thank God I Do” – Writers: Lauren Daigle, Jason Ingram, P!nk, Jeffrey Bhasker, Nate Ruess\n\n“This Is Our God” – Writers: Pat Barrett, Phil Wickham, Steven Furtick, Brandon Lake\n\n“Trust in God” – Writers: Brandon Lake, Steven Furtick, Chris Brown, Mitch Wong\n\nSongwriter of the Year – Artist:\n\nCody Carnes\n\nBrandon Lake\n\nChandler Moore\n\nChris Brown\n\nNaomi Raine\n\nPhil Wickham\n\nSongwriter of the Year – Non-Artist:\n\nBen Fielding\n\nHank Bentley\n\nBrian Johnson\n\nJason Ingram\n\nJeff Pardo\n\nArtist of the Year:\n\nAnne Wilson\n\nBrandon Lake\n\nCeCe Winans\n\nfor KING + COUNTRY\n\nLauren Daigle\n\nProducer of the Year:\n\nDavid Leonard\n\nHank Bentley\n\nJeff Pardo\n\nJonathan Jay\n\nJonathan Smith\n\nRock/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year:\n\n“COUNT ‘EM” Brandon Lake (writer: Hank Bentley)\n\n“Faith!?” Chris Renzema (writer: Hank Bentley)\n\n“Grave Robber” Crowder (writers: Crowder, Ben Glover, Jeff Sojka)\n\n“Whatever It Takes” Stephen Stanley (writer: Stephen Stanley, Paul Duncan)\n\nPop/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year:\n\n“Strong” Anne Wilson (writers: Anne Wilson, Jeff Pardo)\n\n“Any More” CAIN (writer: Jeff Pardo)\n\n“Counting My Blessings” Seph Schlueter (writers: Jonathan Gamble, Jordan Sapp)\n\nInspirational Recorded Song of the Year:\n\n“Center Of My Joy” Cece Winans, Gaither (writers: Bill Gaither, Gloria Gaither)\n\n“In Christ Alone (Live From Sydney)” CityAlight, Keith & Kristyn Getty (writer: Keith Getty, Stuart Townend)\n\n“My Tribute (To God Be The Glory)” Natalie Grant (ft.
