        "text": "“Testament” marks milestone 30-year celebration with reimagined beloved classics and new songs.\n\n(FRANKLIN, Tennessee) – Darlene Zschech has signed an exclusive worldwide agreement with Integrity Music for the release of a special album titled “Testament.” The studio album celebrates the 30-year anniversary of “Shout to the Lord” with 25 fresh takes on legacy releases and five brand-new songs. It will be presented on two EPs releasing over summer 2024, with a full album release on October 11 followed by a 30-day devotional published by David C Cook.\n\nZschech is an acclaimed singer-songwriter, worship leader, pastor, author, and speaker from Australia who pioneered a fresh movement of worship music in the Church from the 1990s onwards. She has written multiple songs sung in the Church worldwide and in several languages, such as “Shout to the Lord,” “Victor’s Crown,” “In Jesus Name,” and “Worthy is the Lamb.” Her life’s passion for serving God and people led her to pastor Hope Unlimited Church (HopeUC) alongside her husband, Mark, and initiated HOPE: Global, a non-profit organization bringing hope to people through education in many countries across Africa and Asia.\n\n“We are thrilled to be able to contribute to the next season in Darlene Zschech’s extraordinary ministry,” said Jonathan Brown, Chief Global Officer at David C Cook. “Darlene’s songs have helped lead people all over the world into the presence of God, which stands as a testimony to the craft that she has stewarded over the years.”\n\n“It is an honor for Integrity Music to continue working alongside Darlene Zschech to further her invaluable contribution to leading the Church in worshiping the King of Kings! We believe that her gift will help many more people to discover the beauty and goodness of God,” said Blaine Barcus, President of Integrity Music.\n\nWith this unique album, Zschech was inspired to recreate her iconic worship songs, presenting a collection of studio recordings in a new light, as she explains: “‘Testament’ means ‘a statement of belief or direction’, or in a legal term, something that serves as ‘evidence of truth, legally binding,’ which so describes the promises of God, His character and His goodness. This has been my heart’s desire over my lifetime – to live in response to the great love of God and His unwavering faithfulness over my life. Really, this is the heart of worship, that the whole of our lives would be poured out for the glory of God. It’s not always easy to choose this kind of life, but obedience when following Jesus is really the only way you’ll ever walk in true freedom. This is my story and the foundation from which ‘Testament’ has been woven together.”\n\n“Testament” will launch with the first EP of the same name on July 12, 2024. The first part of this project will contain five songs, kicking off a new season in Zschech’s ongoing contribution to the worship of the Church.\n\nLast week, Integrity Music legacy artist, worship leader and singer-songwriter Paul Baloche released a deluxe version of his trailblazing album ‘A Greater Song’ to celebrate its 15th anniversary! Since then, we have been playing it non-stop, enjoying the classics and rediscovering some of Paul’s songs through his beautifully reimagined versions, all the while worshipping our God. “The songs on ‘A Greater Song’ were birthed in the midst of worship in my local church 15 years ago,” he says, before adding: “I remember it being a season of intense and consistent prayer in our community and I can hear it in the voices on the original recordings. I can still picture the faces of our congregation as we lifted up these songs as prayers to God from our fellowship. Surprisingly, many of these choruses are still being sung in churches around the world.” Though fifteen years have passed since the live recording of this album, its core message still rings fresh and true to our ears and hearts today; Paul Baloche has a way of capturing the powerful message of the Gospel in a relevant and relatable manner.\n\nHaving served as the Worship Pastor at Community Christian Fellowship in Lindale, Texas for more than 25 years, Paul Baloche is an ordained minister with an MDiv from the Methodist Episcopal Church. In addition to writing, recording, and touring, he founded LeadWorship.com to serve, equip, and train local church worship teams across the globe. Paul Baloche is a contributing writer for bothWorship Leader and Worship Musician magazines, a featured blogger on ChurchLeaders.com, and has written the books The Same Love: A Devotion (David C. Cook) and God Songs – How to Write and Select Songs for Worship. He has three grown children and currently resides in Philadephia, PA, with his wife Rita.\n\nMulti-award-winning artist and worship leader Matt Redman has been awarded “Album of the Year” for Let There Be Wonder at this year’s annual Christian Resources Together (CRT) Award presentations. Paul Owen, Director of International Sales for David C Cook accepted the award on behalf of Matt Redman and Integrity Music.\n\nPaul in his acceptance speech spoke about the contribution of Matt to Christian worship and music through his 16 studio and 4 live albums that he has released since the early 90’s with Let There Be Wonder continuing the legacy of one today’s leading Christian worship leaders.\n\nWhile preparing for this 12-song live collection, Redman created songs that unite into one principal topic: Jesus. Redman shares, “One theme that shone through so strongly on this record was the name and character and story of Jesus. I think there’s a need in our society and in church to absolutely name Him, to not just speak generically about who God is but to put a name on Him and to declare it and to say it – to sing the name of Jesus.”\n\nLet There Be Wonder was produced by Jacob Sooter and Joshua Silverberg. Redman collaborated with key writers and friends such as Sooter and Silverberg, Phil Wickham, Hillsong’s Joel Houston, Jason Ingram, Pat Barrett, Corey Voss, Andi Rozier (Vertical Church Band), Jon Guerra, and Brandon Lake, who also appears on the project along with Evan Craft. The project was recorded in front of more than 1,000 people at Free Chapel in Orange County, California.\n\nIt was announced in January that the ministries of Compassion International, David C Cook, and Integrity Music would release the “FAITHFUL Project,” a collaborative project encapsulating a book, music and live events. The album, titled “FAITHFUL: Go and Speak,” is slated to drop April 30, while the “FAITHFUL” book will release May 1.\n\nThe “FAITHFUL Project” began to come to life in the winter before the pandemic when a group of well-known and respected authors and songwriters gathered as a community to write and share songs. Their work came to be known as “FAITHFUL”: songs and stories of God’s kindness to women throughout history and here with us now.\n\n“A Woman,” the debut single from the 12-song album, features six-time Grammy Award-winner Amy Grant and multi-GMA Dove Award-winner Ellie Holcomb.\n\nAlong with “A Woman,” each song on the special thematic album features a woman telling the story of God’s faithfulness throughout scripture to the present day. The story of Mary Magdalene is shared in “A Woman” and was written by Holcomb, New York Times best-selling author Ann Voskamp, and artist Sarah Macintosh.\n\nIntegrity Music Europe, a division of David C Cook, recently announced the launch of a new web site WeAreWorship www.weareworship.com\n\nWeAreWorship is a brand new, international site for worship leaders and musicians, songwriters and everyday worshippers. It’s designed to unite and inspire, to bring together the global worshipping community to serve God better. Here you’ll find wisdom, inspiration and plenty of global voices. Here you’ll find a place where songs of substance invade lives of sacrifice.\n\nWeAreWorship has 2,000+ songs from today’s most established songwriters – like Matt Redman, Graham Kendrick, Stuart Townend, Tim Hughes, Martin Smith and Paul Baloche – but WeAreWorship is less about stars or status and more about the songs.\n\nManaging Director and Vice President of Integrity Music Jonathan Brown said “We’ve been through some transitions recently, which has included the marriage of Kingsway with Integrity Music. And while our brand is important to us, we think that what we are matters even more.\n\nFor us, it always is, and always has been about worship – both what we sing and how we live. We have a rich heritage of songs; songs of substance that fuel the church and help us all love, follow and serve God more truly.\n\nAnd that’s why we’re launching WeAreWorship.com – a new site for worship leaders and musicians, songwriters and those who just love to sing about the goodness of God. The name speaks of who we are, what we were created to do and how we were created to do it… in community.\n\nWeAreWorship will help you discover new songs, connect with the heritage of hymns and join in a more united worship community."
