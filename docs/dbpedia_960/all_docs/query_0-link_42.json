        "text": "Lainey Wilson and HARDY, who won multiple awards for their country hit “Wait in the Truck,” now find themselves competing for a Grammy nomination for songwriter of the year, non-classical (and also for best new artist).\n\nWilson and HARDY, who is listed as Michael Hardy in songwriting categories, are among 58 songwriting pros who are competing for a nomination for songwriter of the year, non-classical.\n\nThe award, which is in its second year, got a big boost from the Recording Academy, which moved it from being the only category in the songwriting field last year to the general field, which also includes record, album and song of the year plus best new artist. Producer of the year, non-classical was also moved up to that high-rent district on the Grammy ballot. The move is expected to greatly increase the number of Academy members who will vote in these two categories.\n\nSongwriter of the year, non-classical was specifically designed to celebrate songwriters who primarily write for other artists, rather than songwriters who are also artists or producers. So how did Wilson and HARDY make the list? Wilson’s entry shows songs she wrote for Ashley McBryde, Mackenzie Porter and more. HARDY’s shows songs he wrote for Morgan Wallen, Jelly Roll and Cole Swindell, in addition to his own work.\n\nEight past Grammy winners are vying for nominations in the category. The roster includes Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey, who shared a Grammy for best country song eight years ago for co-writing (with Lori McKenna) the Little Big Town smash “Girl Crush.”\n\nThe six other past Grammy winners vying for a nod in this category are Edgar Barrera, Claudia Brant, Jason Ingram, Shane McAnally, Jonathan Smith and Diane Warren.\n\nWarren has received 15 Grammy nominations, more than any other of this year’s other contenders for this award. She has won just one Grammy – best song written specifically for a motion picture or for television for her Celine Dion classic “Because You Loved Me.”\n\nNija Charles and Laura Veltz, who were nominated in this category last year, are in the running to be nominated two years in a row. But Tobias Jesso Jr., who won the inaugural award, is not on the entry list in this category this year, nor are last year’s nominees Amy Allen and The-Dream.\n\nOne songwriting pair is nominated – Mariah Martinez and Dana Victoria Portlalatin.\n\nLauren Christy is entered with songs she wrote for such artists as Pentatonix and Loud Luxury featuring Bebe Rexha. Christy was nominated for producer of the year, non-classical in 2003 as part of The Matrix (along with Graham Edwards and Scott Spock).\n\nThis category is analogous to producer of the year, non-classical, which was introduced in 1974. Thom Bell, one of the architects of the Philadelphia soul sound, was the first winner in that category.\n\nFirst-round voting for the 66th annual Grammy Awards opened on Wednesday Oct. 11 and closes Oct. 20. Nominees will be announced on Nov. 10 (five days earlier than last year). The final-round voting window extends from Dec. 14 through Jan. 4, 2023 (same as last year). Winners will be announced on Sunday, Feb. 4, 2024, at Crypto.com Arena (formerly known as Staples Center) in Los Angeles.\n\nHere are the 58 songwriters who are in the running for the 2024 Grammy for songwriter of the year. They are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nSarah Aarons\n\nCarole Ailin\n\nAndy Albert\n\nAldae\n\nJessi Leigh Alexander\n\nVision Alexander\n\nEdgar Barrera\n\nEvan Bogart\n\nClaudia Brant\n\nNija Charles\n\nLauren Christy\n\nKevyn Mauricio Cruz\n\nDelacey\n\nJessie Jo Dillon\n\nDougie F (Douglas Ford)\n\nJessie Early\n\nFeli Ferraro\n\nJesse Frasure\n\nJesús Roberto Laija García\n\nNatalie Nicole Gilbert\n\nAshley Gorley\n\nCharlie Handsome\n\nMichael Hardy\n\nScott Harris\n\nJamie Hartman\n\nJacob Kasher Hindlin\n\nSarah Hudson\n\nEthan Hulse\n\nJason Ingram\n\nSteph Jones\n\nJozzy\n\nIlsey Juber\n\nSean Kennedy\n\nAkil “World Wide Fresh” King\n\nChris LaCorte\n\nLauri Laubre\n\nHillary Lindsey\n\nMadison Love\n\nMariah Martinez and Dana Victoria Portalatin\n\nShane McAnally\n\nMaureen “Mozella” McDonald\n\nJosh Miller\n\nMichael Pollack\n\nSam Roman\n\nElena Rose\n\nLiz Rose\n\nJonathan Smith\n\nSarah Solovay\n\nJacob Sooter\n\nMike Spears\n\nTheron Thomas\n\nJustin Tranter\n\nLaura Veltz\n\nBilly Walsh\n\nDiane Warren\n\nSimon Wilcox\n\nLainey Wilson\n\nXplicit"
