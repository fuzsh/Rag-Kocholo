        "text": "Grammy & Dove Winner. Servant of the songs, artists, and music. Let's make music together. Mixing in Stereo (2000+) and Dolby Atmos (400+) www.warrendavidmusic.com\n\nWHO I AM\n\nI am a Producer, Mixer, Engineer. I am a servant of the artist and the song(s), striving to help create great sounding music using the skills and tools I’ve acquired. My passion is for creating music and my hope is to bring out the best in the music, the people making it, and the people listening to it.\n\nWHERE I STARTED\n\nI grew up in Texas and was active in various arts, but struck a chord with music production. I have been working professionally in Nashville since 2011. I’ve been blessed to apprentice with world class producers and engineers on hundreds of projects, including Grammy nominated and Grammy winning projects. I was in the right place at the right time, and now I’m so fortunate to survive doing what I love.\n\nWHAT I DO\n\nMy expertise is in mixing, producing, engineering, arranging, and editing. In several studios, I have served in system building, troubleshooting, network integration, business operations, and hardware repair. I aim to serve the project, I try to remain transparent, and hope to let the music be the star.\n\nWHAT I BELIEVE\n\nI believe the song is king; it's my job to maximize the song's potential, making it the best version of itself. My job is to be transparent, not attempting to impose \"my sound\" onto a song, but bring out the best qualities of each song and carve out imperfections. Less is more when you have the right tools.\n\nSend me a note through the contact button above."
