1. A Nobel Prize-Winning Physicist

Max von Laue, a German physicist, was born on October 9, 1879 in Pfaffendorf, a small village located near Koblenz, Germany. He is best known for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914. His work laid the foundation for the development of X-ray crystallography, which has since become an invaluable tool for the study of the structure of matter.

2. The Father of Modern Optics

In 1903, Max von Laue received his doctorate from the University of Berlin for his dissertation on the theory of interference in plan parallel plates. His dissertation focused on the study of the behavior of light when it passes through two parallel plates, and how the interference of the light waves can be used to measure the distance between the plates. His research was groundbreaking and has since been used in many fields, including optics, acoustics, and quantum mechanics.

4. A Physicist Who Shaped X-Ray Crystallography

Max von Laue was a renowned physicist who made significant contributions to the field of X-ray crystallography. In 1911, he published a book on the restricted theory of X-ray diffraction, which went on to be published in several editions. He followed this up with another book in 1921, this time on the general theory of X-ray diffraction, which also went on to be published in multiple editions. His work in this area was highly influential and helped to shape the field of X-ray crystallography.
