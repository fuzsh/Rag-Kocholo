Venice: Aldus Manutius, 1495-1498.\n\nFIRST PRINTED EDITION of the earliest surviving work mentioning crystals. De Lapidibus (On Stones), written by the Greek scholar Theophrastus, deals primarily with mining and the uses of various ores, but it also gives descriptions of many kinds of crystalline minerals. \"It remained for 1800 years one of the most authoritative treatise on minerals, referenced and quoted by writers down to modern times. . . . Theophrastus is in fact the first investigator to treat mineral substances for themselves rather than for their magical or curative properties, and he may be considered the best and most accurate mineralogist among the ancients.\"\n\nSchuh, Curtis P.

Chapters 33-37 contain \"a comprehensive catalog of minerals and precious stones, including the uses of these materials in medicine, architecture, and especially art.\" The first printed edition of Pliny's Naturalis Historiæ, which appeared in 1469, was the first science text ever to be set up in type, only 15 years after Johannes Gutenberg (ca. 1398 - 1468) produced his famous bible.\n\nSchuh, Curtis P.

It is important for its role in the transformation of mineralogy into a full-fledged science. \"The tradition of magical and curative powers in gems still permeates the text, but one feels the author fighting the superstitions of the ancient beliefs, and seeing the world in a new, more skeptical and practical view.\" Included in the exhibit is a copy of the seventh edition, from 1519.

The major portion of this collected edition of five important works by Georg Agricola on mineralogy, geology, and mining is \"a refutation of the geological ideas of the ancient philosophers, the alchemists, and the astrologers. It displays Agricola's wide ranging knowledge of the classic authors and his keen observational and logical reasoning ability.\" Interestingly, Isaac Newton's personal copy of the first edition of this book was sold to a pawn shop in Las Vegas last year (for a ridiculously low price!); the sale was featured on an episode of the television show Pawn Stars.\n\nSchuh, Curtis P.

Kepler liked to look for hidden regularities and mathematical order in the material world. As an amusement, Kepler proposed the idea that the beautiful hexagonal structure of snowflakes was due to a regular geometric arrangement of tiny solid subunits. He discussed simple cubic and hexagonal packings of spheres, but ultimately was unable to explain the shapes of snowflakes based on geometry alone.\n\nSchuh, Curtis P.

The observations were made with Hooke's newly perfected compound microscope, enabling the study of inorganic matter such as crystals, as well as investigations of plant and animal life such as the honeycomb structure of cork and the anatomy of a flea. In fact, in this book Hooke coined the word 'cell' to describe the basic microscopic units of tissue.\n\nGeoffrey Keynes, A Bibliography of Dr. Robert Hooke.

In 1669, Stensen observed in his book De Solido intra Solidum (On Solids within Solids) that the angles between the faces of a crystal of quartz were always the same, even for crystals of different shape or size. Stensen correctly speculated that this constancy was due to some kind of regularity of the internal structure of the crystal.\n\nSchuh, Curtis P.

This law states that crystals of the same substance show the same angles between corresponding faces, even though they might have different overall shapes such as plates or needles.

Haüy went much farther, however, in determining the consequences of this idea: he found that each crystal face could be described by a set of three numbers, which were either infinity or small integers such as 1, 2, 3, . . . up to about six. Haüy called this mathematical regularity the law of rational indices.\n\nDiana H. Hook, Jeremy M. Norman, Haskell F.

Frankenheim's case is, unfortunately, a classic example of how sometimes an important discovery can be published but largely ignored, and credit given instead to someone later who came to the same conclusion. In fact, Frankenheim's results were subsequently reproduced by two other scientists, both times without mentioning the precedent: first in 1830 by the German mineralogist Johann Hessel (1796 - 1872), and then in 1850 by the French mathematician Auguste Bravais.\n\nCurtis P.

The advantages of \"Miller Indices\", as they became known, to describe the orientations of crystal faces were almost immediately recognized. None of the previous notational schemes were as easy to apply or as widely accepted as this method, which is still used today.\"\n\nSchuh, Curtis P.

CLARK (1892 - 1969). Applied X-rays. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1927.\n\nFIRST EDITION of an important book describing the scientific, industrial, and medical uses of X-rays, including many techniques developed by the author, George Clark. In the course of his nearly thirty years of research, Clark used X-ray methods to characterize a wide variety of materials, including metals and minerals, natural and synthetic fibers, natural and synthetic rubber, clays, carbon black, storage battery plates, corks, and waxes. Clark was a long-time professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\n\"George Lindenberg Clark and High-Intensity X-ray Tubes,\" American Chemical Society, National Historic Chemical Landmarks website (http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/noyeslaboratory.html#george-lindenberg-clark-biography, accessed 30 Jan 2012).\n\nMore information about the author from the cited reference above.\n\nTitle page image\n\nPage 231 image\n\nKATHLEEN Y.

(Nature 1928, 122, 810.)\n\nFIRST EDITION, JOURNAL ISSUE, of the crystallographic proof of the hexagonal structure of the benzene ring, published by the British crystallographer Kathleen Lonsdale in 1928. Although she confessed that she \"knew no organic chemistry and very little of any other kind,\" this finding was one of the most outstanding advances in that subject for many decades. Today, crystallographic investigations of organic molecules such as pharmaceuticals and proteins are crucial to the development of improved medicines and many other scientific advances.\n\nComplete Dictionary of Scientific Biography.

Snow Crystals. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1931.\n\nFIRST EDITION of one of the most remarkable books ever written by an amateur scientist. From the earliest memories of our childhood, many of us can remember hearing the phrase \"no two snowflakes are alike.\" The scientific evidence in support of this assertion stems largely from the efforts of one man, Wilson Bentley, who took the pictures on his family farm in Jericho, Vermont. Bentley's hope of someday giving to the world a book of his snowflake pictures came to fruition but, tragically, only a few days after the book was published, he died of an attack of pneumonia.\n\n\"Wilson Alwyn Bentley,\" Dictionary of American Biography.

The \"direct method,\" developed by Herbert Hauptman and Jerome Karle beginning in 1950, is in many respects complementary to the Patterson method but applicable to a wider variety of crystals. \"By the mid 1980s the atomic structures of approximately 40,000 substances had been determined through use of direct methods, as compared to only some 4,000 determined by other methods in all the years prior to about 1970. Hauptman and Karle were awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in chemistry for this discovery.\"\n\nWorld of Chemistry, Gale, 2006, \"Herbert A.
