        "text": "In a slight oversight at crystallography 365 HQ, we missed that it was Max von Laue’s birthday on Thursday.\n\nVon Laue received the Nobel prize for physics in 1914 for his discovery of the diffraction of x-rays by crystals, the first crucial step to the science of crystallography as it is today. Though von Laue went on to concentrate on theoretical physics, one particular technique of diffraction is named after him – Laue diffraction. With this technique of diffraction the sample is kept still and the x-rays it is exposed to are polychromatic – they occur in a range of wavelengths. This means that lots of planes of atoms satisfy the Bragg condition at once, and makes for some very pretty pictures.\n\nLaue diffraction is particularly useful for a number branches of crystallography – and over the next few days we’ll be featuring a few of them. Today we’ll introduce one use – taking rapid data!\n\nWhat does it look like?\n\nWhat is it?\n\nAs you can see this is a pretty complex arrangement of atoms, it’s a complex of the metal rhodium in a state that only exists for a few seconds at a time. The advantage of Laue diffraction, is that if you can push the material into its excited state as well as hitting it with a pulse of x-rays – you can find even the most fleeting of crystal structures."
