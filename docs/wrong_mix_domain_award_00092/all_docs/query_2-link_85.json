        "text": "Gleaming with light and tantalising philosophers with their regular structure, crystals have always been at the centre of conversations about how the particles of the universe fit together.\n\nSnowflakes, for example, fascinated some of the earliest scientific investigators of crystals, like Robert Hooke (famous for his pioneering microscopic studies) and the astronomer Johannes Kepler.\n\nIt was an 18th century French priest, however, who would lay the foundations of the modern study of crystals. René Just Haüy studied the outward structure of crystalline mineral forms, producing models.\n\nThe British chemist William Hyde Wollaston took the study of crystals to new levels of precision, developing specialist instruments to examine and measure structure.\n\nWollaston reputedly used the models on the below right in his lectures on crystallography, including one to the Royal Society in 1813 announcing his key ideas on the subject.\n\nRevolutionary in their field, the Braggs were also progressive in their views on women working as scientists. They encouraged many to take up x-ray crystallography at a time when science was almost completely male-dominated.\n\nAmong William Bragg’s 18 research students, 11 were women. One of his leading protégés was Kathleen Lonsdale. Before the commercialisation of the x-ray camera, Lonsdale made these specialist cameras herself, often from household items like food or drink tins.\n\nLonsdale—who along with biochemist Marjory Stephenson was the first female fellow of the Royal Society of London—used her status to campaign for women in science, highlighting unequal expectations and the challenging conditions of combining family life with research.\n\nOne of her students, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, became one of the most important crystallographers of the 20th century, solving the structures of medically important molecules such as penicillin, vitamin B12 and insulin.\n\nIn 1964 Crowfoot Hodgkin became the first British woman to win a science Nobel, but she was not keen on the label 'woman scientist'—and must have been especially irked by the Daily Mail headline announcing her award, which ran \"Oxford housewife wins Nobel Prize\".\n\nYet for all the increased opportunities for women in crystallography, the field was not isolated from sexism and misogyny.\n\nPrevailing sexist attitudes in science were (inadvertently) exposed by James Watson’s 1968 autobiographical account of the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953.\n\nWatson revealed he had used Rosalind Franklin’s all-important x-ray photograph without her permission in his work solving DNA's famous double helical structure, which led to Nobel Prize glory in 1962 (not shared with Franklin, who died before the award).\n\nNot only that, he also criticised her physical appearance in his book, citing her lack of lipstick as a reason he didn’t find her attractive. \"The thought could not be avoided,\" Watson wrote, \"that the best home for a feminist was in another person's lab\".\n\nFranklin could not respond, as she had died of ovarian cancer 10 years earlier.\n\nX-ray crystallography began as a science seemingly especially open to women, but did this trend continue?\n\nWhile many of its pioneers were women (Lonsdale, Crowfoot Hodgkin and Franklin being the most famous examples), the field is still predominantly male today.\n\nIn 1990 a study of the World Directory of Crystallographers found that the proportion of women was just 14% internationally; today the International Union of Crystallography's online list of eminent crystallographers is more than 90% male."
