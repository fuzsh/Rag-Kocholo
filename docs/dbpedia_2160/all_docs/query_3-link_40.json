        "text": "Franc’s performance in the film so impressed the late Luciano Pavarotti that it led to an invitation from the legendary tenor for Franc to live and study at Pavarotti’s private home in Italy in the summer of 1991. Having previously trained at the famed Vocal Academy of Lucca in Italy, Franc quickly cultivated a passion for his Italian roots and culture, becoming fluent in the language and eventually founding the Lorenzo Malfatti Accademia Vocale di Lucca, where he teaches his craft to young opera students each summer. Franc also lectures at music schools throughout the United States and Europe, including conservatories in Spoleto and Florence, Italy, and the famed Juilliard School in New York City.\n\nIn early 2000, Franc caught the attention of Barry Manilow, who personally selected him for the lead role of “Tony” in the pre-Broadway tour of Copacabana based on Manilow’s hit song. Franc worked side-by-side with Manilow for five weeks perfecting the musical production, which culminated in a successful year-long tour and earned Franc a National Theatre Award nomination for “Best Male Performer in a Musical.”\n\nSince 2005, Franc has toured extensively throughout the United States, Europe and South America with his critically-acclaimed one-man shows, including Franc D’Ambrosio’s BROADWAY; Franc D’Ambrosio’s HOLLYWOOD; A Tribute to the Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber; Christmas in New York, and I’ll Be Seeing Youz, a musical perspective of popular war songs from World War II. In February 2020 he introduced Franc D’Ambrosio’s BACK TO BROADWAY, a new tribute show featuring his iconic Hamilton medley, which he debuted at two sold-out performances at Feinstein’s at the Nikko in San Francisco just weeks before the Covid 19 pandemic brought the performing arts to a halt. He is a frequent guest artist with many major American, European, and Asian orchestras and symphonies, and tours the world teaching his widely-acclaimed Master Classes.\n\nOn February 3, 2020, Franc was knighted by order of the President of the Republic of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, in a private ceremony at the Italian Consulate General in San Francisco. His official title, “Cavaliere dell’Ordine della Stella d’Italia” is the highest honor the Italian government can bestow on a foreigner, and is conferred upon Italian expatriates who have greatly contributed to the preservation of the Italian spirit, culture and national prestige abroad. In May 2018, Franc was honored to receive the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the third annual Cannes Global Short Film Awards Gala during the 71st Annual Cannes Film Festival.\n\nFranc has performed in several network television specials featuring Olympic figure skaters such as Brian Boitano, Kristi Yamaguchi and Nancy Kerrigan, including NBC’s “Brian Boitano’s Skating Spectacular” and “A 2005 Tribute to Movies on Ice” with fellow musical guest Michael Bolton. Franc’s performance of “The Music of the Night,” as interpreted by Boitano, brought the audience of more than 6,000 to their feet for the evening’s only standing ovation. In 2008, he toured internationally with co-star Dorothy Hamill in Broadway On Ice.\n\nHe has released three successful solo CDs, one of which has the unique distinction as the chosen soundtrack for Barry Manilow’s daily workout. In addition to his one-man shows, Franc is also currently touring the world with “The Four Phantoms In Concert”; the Phantoms just released their first CD in February 2022, recorded live at the iconic 54 Below nightclub in New York City.\n\nOn March 4, 2020, Franc began six weeks of rehearsals for the World Premiere of ORFEUS: A House Music Opera! at the legendary Young Vic Theatre in London. Franc plays the role of Pluto. Set in the near future and directed by Charles Randolph-Wright with music by award-winning baritone Nmon Ford, this unique production blends opera, house music and theatre into a timeless version of Ovid’s legend. The show was originally scheduled for April 11 – May 30, 2020; due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the production will be rescheduled at a later date.\n\nIn July and August 2022, Franc performed in two private concerts with the legendary Andrea Bocelli at his estate in Forte dei Marmi, Italy, along with Matteo Bocelli, Michael Bolton and Paul Anka. He was accompanied on piano by Mr. Bocelli’s longtime composer, conductor and vocal coach Maestro Carlo Bernini. Until they met in July, Franc was unaware that his performance in The Godfather, Part III inspired Mr. Bocelli to record his own version of the Academy Award-winning theme song “Speak Softly Love” which Franc sang in both the film and motion picture soundtrack.\n\nIn 2022, Franc hosted benefit concerts in cities across the country to raise funds for the Western Dominican Friars aiding Ukrainian refugees on the front lines in Poland. One hundred percent of the proceeds, which totaled more than $1 million, went directly to the friars to provide food, shelter, and medical and psychological care to thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing their war-torn homeland.\n\nAmong his many talents, Franc is also a self-taught contemporary artist. His abstract acrylic paintings are on display in San Francisco’s ArtHaus Gallery and the James Bacchi Contemporary Gallery in Palm Springs, CA. His work is also part of the permanent collection at Museo ItaloAmericano, as well as in some of the most iconic homes in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York City, Pebble Beach, and cities throughout Europe. In December 2022 in Granite Bay, CA, Franc’s paintings were featured at his first private art exhibit and lauded by an enthusiastic new audience of art collectors.\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera\n\nFranc held the title \"The World's Longest Running Phantom\" for a period of ten years, playing the lead role more than 2,100 times for over 5 million theatre-goers (1992 - 1999).\n\nGodfather III\n\nParamount Pictures sent five talent scouts on an international search to fill the part of Anthony Vito Corleone, the opera-singing son of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton's characters in the film (a role for which more than 2,000 actors auditioned). Legendary director Francis Ford Coppola cast Franc in the coveted role; he remains the only singer to perform the title theme \"Speak Softly Love\" in the Godfather trilogy (1990). Franc was also chosen to record the song for the film's Original Motion Picture Soundtrack; the haunting theme won an Academy Award for Best Original Dramatic Score in 1974.\n\nSweeney Todd\n\nFranc began his successful Broadway career in the debut of this iconic first revival, which went on to receive three Tony nominations (1989).\n\nNew York City Stage\n\nAmong Franc's many versatile stage roles are his critically-acclaimed performances in Kismet, A Little Night Music, She Loves Me, Valentino, Elizabeth Takes Her Leave, and Christmas Wrappings, among others. He has also appeared at the legendary Waxworks, Joe's Pub, Feinstein's 54 Below, and most recently at Carnegie Hall with The Four Phantoms In Concert (2018).\n\nCopacabana\n\nFranc was hand-picked by Barry Manilow to create and star in the lead role of \"Tony\" in the pre-Broadway tour, earning him a National Theatre Award nomination for Best Male Performer in a Musical (2000).\n\nBroadway on Ice\n\nOlympic champion figure skater Dorothy Hamill co-starred with Franc in this critically-acclaimed national tour produced by Willie Bietak Productions (2008).\n\nNational Television Specials\n\nFranc performed live with Olympic champion Brian Boitano for a special production of Brian Boitano's Skating Spectacular (2005), followed by A Tribute to Movies on Ice (2005), both on NBC. He also paired with musical guests Michael Bolton, Ray Charles, Diana DiGarmo and Kathy Mattea in various one-of-a-kind Skating Tribute shows for NBC (1998 - 2006).\n\nLuciano Pavarotti\n\nThe legendary tenor personally invited Franc to live, work and study with him at his family home in Italy during the summer of 1990. Franc has described his one-on-one time with Pavarotti as a life-changing experience for which he will always be grateful.\n\nNational Touring Artist\n\nIn 2004, Franc debuted his highly-acclaimed one-man show Franc D'Ambrosio's BROADWAY: Songs of the Great White Way, which he continues to tour throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia. His subsequent tour, titled Franc D'Ambrosio's HOLLYWOOD: Songs of the Silver Screen, debuted in 2007. A collection of recordings from both of these popular stage shows are featured in the CDs Franc D'Ambrosio's BROADWAY and Franc D'Ambrosio's HOLLYWOOD, which continue to be fan favorites on iTunes.\n\nGuest Recordings\n\nFranc is one of the featured singers on a CD titled In Good Company (LML Music) along with Michael Feinstein, Amanda McBroom, Maureen McGovern and others (released in 2005). He also sang his mesmerizing rendition of My Shining Hour on Johnny Mercer's album DREAM, based on the Broadway musical of the same name and featuring a musical revue of the songs of Johnny Mercer, recorded live at The 18th Annual Live S.T.A.G.E. Benefit Concert (1997).\n\nLove Changes Everything: The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber\n\nFranc was chosen as one of the featured artists to perform in a special tribute to the famous composer at the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts in Pittsburgh (July 8-14, 2011)\n\nWhite Canvas Productions\n\nCo-producer of 25 network television specials featuring Olympic and World champion figure skaters and big-name musical talent, including Barry Manilow, Michael Bolton, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles\n\nCo-Founder and Chairman of the Accademia Vocale Lorenzo Malfatti\n\nAn opera and music school and summer music festival in Lucca, Italy, founded in 1996 to honor Franc’s mentor, the late American opera singer and voice teacher Lorenzo Malfatti"
