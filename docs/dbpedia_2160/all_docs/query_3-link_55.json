        "text": "But despite his track record, there are some within the industry who believe West could be a fit as a judge on American Idol, which now has two spots open after the departures of singer Jennifer Lopez and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler last week.\n\n“If I was running Idol, I would definitely look to get some host that had a strong opinion that came from a credible and honest place,” says Steve Stoute, founder of ad firm Translation. “With that I would go after none other than Kanye West, who has this credible passion for the art.”\n\nIn the wake of Idol's recent shakeup, FORBES players surveyed a handful of music business insiders about possible replacement judges. To be sure, there were a few names who were a bit less controversial than West, including Stoute’s other suggestions: Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin and singer Mariah Carey, who’s managed by Idol’s lone remaining judge, Randy Jackson.\n\nStoute believes Carey would bring credibility in the singing department, making up for the loss of Lopez. Rubin or West would bring the producer’s viewpoint, plus the experience of coaching and shaping stars on their own—as well as an edginess that Stoute believes left the show with Simon Cowell in 2010.\n\n“Last season it felt like those celebs didn’t want to have strong opposition to each other so they all provided similar responses,” he says. “You must understand that they also have professional careers and not in there ‘prime.’ They can’t afford any backlash from people not liking them, so they gave favorable opinions that weren’t strong in critique.”\n\nAnother factor to consider: a judge’s ability to bring new fans to the show. Though Idol averaged 20 million viewers per episode last year, ratings fell 25% from 2011. Rostrum Records vice president Artie Pitt suggests two big names that could help remedy the situation, and with Lopez and Tyler’s combined $25 million salary coming off the books, the show may have the funds to lure another major star or two.\n\n“I think Madonna would be a great replacement for J-Lo, and Justin Timberlake could bring some new energy in taking the place of Steven Tyler,” he says. “Madonna is iconic, has a long track record of success in the business, and would bring a lot of new and older fans to the show.”\n\nThen again, with an annual $15 million already committed to host Ryan Seacrest, Idol’s decision-makers may opt to lock up at least one lesser star, in case the show’s ratings fall further. One music industry player who could fit the bill: Johnny Wright, who has managed groups including the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC and the Jonas Brothers, and has been involved with a number of music-oriented reality shows already, including Fame and Making the Band.\n\n“He might be a good person [for Idol],” says entertainment attorney Lori Landew of Fox Rothschild. “You want somebody whose judgment you trust in terms of being able to judge the talent, but also somebody who’s going to provide some entertainment value in and of themselves.”\n\nLandew also likes Queen Latifah, who's got \"that right combination\" of experience as a performer and warmth as a person, as well as Dolly Parton, who'd bring her country music and songwriting chops to the show.\n\nAnother name Idol brass may be considering is Jimmy Iovine. The Interscope Records founder has plenty of experience in the music business, he’s already been serving as a guest mentor on the show over the past two seasons, and he likely wouldn’t command quite the same salary as a major touring act.\n\nWhich brings us to one more pick—perhaps a bit unrealistic, but one for whom the logistics just might align—Beyoncé Knowles. The songstress has taken a break from touring after the birth of her and husband Jay-Z’s daughter Blue Ivy earlier this year, and Idol‘s production schedule might be amenable to her. That said, Beyoncé is still in the prime of her career. It seems unlikely that, given its recent struggles, Idol would be willing to pony up what it’d take to “put a ring on it.”\n\nIt's interesting to note, though, that of all the artists suggested by our mini-panel, only one name came up twice: none other than Kanye West."
