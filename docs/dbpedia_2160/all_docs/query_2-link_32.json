        "text": "The boy band golden era and its biggest stars — ‘NSync, the Backstreet Boys, and New Kids on the Block — will be the subject of a new documentary on Paramount+.\n\nAs The Wrap notes, the yet-untitled documentary, which just got the green light, will purportedly examine the highs and lows of boy band superstardom, as well as the era these groups helped define. There will be interviews with key figures, including band members, and access to music and archival footage.\n\nThe movie will be directed by Tamra Davis, whose credits include comedies like Billy Madison and Half Baked and a slew of music videos. (Most were for Nineties alt-rockers, but she did direct the visual for one boy band classic: Hanson’s “MMMBop.”) Davis also directed the 2010 documentary Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child and served as a producer on the Kathleen Hanna doc The Punk Singer.\n\nOne boy band insider involved in the new project as a producer will be Johnny Wright, a manager for ‘NSync, Backstreet Boys, and many others.\n\nIn a statement, Wright said: “The Nineties boy band era was an extraordinary chapter in music where harmonies and beats came together, along with talented vocal artists who captivated the hearts of millions worldwide. Their music spoke to the dreams, aspirations and emotions of the fans, creating a bond that transcended borders and language. To this day, the boy bands continue to inspire, uplift and unite — reminding us of a great time that will forever hold a special place in our hearts.”\n\nTrending\n\nAnother producer on the film is Van Toffler, CEO of Gunpowder and Sky, who also saw the boy band craze up close when he worked on MTV’s music video countdown show TRL. “If you think back to groups like the Jackson 5, who paved the way for boy bands, this music has dominated the charts for decades, but there’s always been a stigma attached,” he said. “The reality is, these are insanely talented guys who led the requests each week when I was running TRL in the Nineties and early 2000s. And, just when we all think the fervor for boy bands has dissipated, One Direction or BTS emerge, and their disciples like Harry Styles and Justin Timberlake overtake pop culture.”"
