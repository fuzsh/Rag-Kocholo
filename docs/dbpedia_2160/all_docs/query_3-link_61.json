        "text": "I was introduced to Mike through a mutual friend when I decided to transfer from my current university. I had already been through the process once and with Mike’s help, my transfer process was very easy. Mike is very detailed and passionate about trying to find you the place of best fit for you and your needs. He has a great network of coaches and he understands how the process works. The one thing that is super helpful about Mike is that he was also a player so he understands what we go through as Division 1 athletes. I really didn’t need to do much other than talk on the phone with the coaches. He set up the rest! I ended up with a bunch of great offers thanks to the work that we did together. I decided to sign with East Tennessee State University and will start there in the fall. I highly recommend Mike to anyone who needs help finding their best during the recruiting process.\n\nOur son Adrian Soriano was introduced to ForeCollegeGolf in his junior year. The past two years Adrian has developed a relationship with Mike. He has been a great mentor through the process of searching for a college in which Adrian can play golf. The process as a parent can be stressful. Mike has prepped us for the ups and downs that the family as a whole goes through. He helped with creating a resume, sending emails, creating a school database, contacting coaches, and visiting campuses. Mike is a great mentor. Not only has Mike helped Adrian with how to communicate with coaches, how to improve his game, but now Adrian is working on what to expect in college as a student-athlete. I highly recommend Mike with ForeCollegeGolf, his knowledge of College golf programs and his experience of playing golf himself helps ease the stress in searching for the right school for your son or daughter. Thank you, Mike!\n\nMike and I were first connected through my swing coach, Ben Pellicani, and ForeCollegeGolf was really the spark that got my recruiting process started. Before I started working with Mike, I was very unfamiliar with the whole recruiting process, and Mike helped guide me through it every step of the way. He helped me write emails, taught me how to speak with coaches on the phone, while also talking to many coaches on the phone himself. Not only did Mike help with recruiting, but he also helped me develop as a player by holding me accountable in my goal setting and giving me ways to be more efficient with my practice. Overall, I worked with Mike for multiple years, and he was nothing short of incredible. I would definitely recommend ForeCollegeGolf to anyone who might be struggling with the college golf recruiting process.\n\nMy first experience with Mike was while I was playing in a tournament, and my Mom just happened to run into him while she was following me. I truly believe if we weren’t in the right place at the right time, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. Mike helped me develop as a golfer, and more importantly, as a person. When I first started the ForeCollegeGolf program, I was in a slump on the golf course. Mike taught me many different things about how to prepare to play good golf and strategize my way around the golf course. Also, before we started working together, I tried contacting some college coaches, but my nerves got the best of me, and I didn’t know how to truly hold a conversation with a coach. Mike taught me how to not only communicate with coaches but also feel confident that I could use my new communication skills as an advantage. Thanks to Mike, I will be starting my college golf career at Stetson University in the fall of 2019! I highly recommend the ForeCollegeGolf program if you are struggling to find the perfect fit for college.\n\nWhen I first started with Mike in my Sophomore year, I was an average golfer who didn't have any offers or had even started to talk with college coaches. As soon as Mike and I started, I could immediately tell we had a bond. I knew right from the beginning that my time with Mike was going to be great and Mike would have my best interest in mind. When I sent out the introduction emails, I immediately got responses. One college coach even said it was the best email that he has ever read when I visited. I was able to express myself and my expectations in that email. Mike and I also worked on systems to help enhance my game and course management so I could play my best on the course. Mike also made sure that I was preparing and playing in the right tournaments that would eventually help me get the exposure and experience I needed. Mike was organized and made sure that I was getting what I needed out of his service. He put me before himself which shows a lot about him and the person he is. My communication skills with college coaches are now off the charts and now my future college coach and I are already forming a bond thanks to the tips Mike has given me. I ended up going on visits to 4 different colleges and I received 4 offers to play college golf. Playing college golf has always been a dream of mine and without the help of Mike, I wouldn’t be anywhere close to where I am today. Mike and I not only bonded, but I know I will always be good friends with Mike and will lean on him going forward. Words can’t even describe my experience with ForeCollegeGolf. All I know is, I am very lucky I had the opportunity to work with such a great guy who knows exactly what he is doing. When I signed my NLI I knew I wouldn’t have gotten here without the help of Michael Smith and ForeCollegeGolf.\n\nBefore I met Mike, I was just a couple of months away from starting my freshman year at the University of North Florida. I did not think that college golf was an option for me as I had just started playing golf less than three years prior. After sharing my story with Mike, he expressed that although it wasn’t the ideal time to begin the recruiting process, that it was never too late to start! After the initial meeting, I could tell that Mike was very knowledgeable about the transfer recruiting process and knew exactly where to begin. With time being my enemy, Mike and I worked very diligently to get resumes built, emails crafted, and school databases put together. We worked towards the end goal, of playing college golf at a school that would be a good fit on every level, something that Mike preaches a lot. I had a lot of questions throughout the recruiting process, and Mike was always quick to answer and very flexible when it came to meeting times. I highly recommend Mike Smith and ForeCollegeGolf to junior golfers looking to advance to the next level and play collegiate golf.\n\nGod sometimes puts people in your path for a reason. You just need to stop and take notice. That is what happened to our family with Mike Smith and Fore College Golf. Over the course of 2015-2016 his name would come up in casual family conversations and our paths kept crossing on the golf course or in business settings. So, we watched, got to know Mike better and observed how he was building his business. We liked what we were seeing.\n\nBut timing is everything and it took until late 2016 to realize our family was ready for next step. Our son, Elliott needed more help than Mom and Dad could provide. It was time to step back as parents and let Elliott take ownership of his collegiate golfing aspirations. We didn’t hesitate and made the call to Mike Smith to explore being our son’s partner.\n\nMike has been a more perfect match for Elliott (and parents!) than we could have imagined. He is reliable, prepared, knowledgeable, relatable, technically adept, well-connected, insightful, accountable, passionate, and most importantly, compatible with our son. Elliott loves golf, but after every interaction with Mike, he is more excited about golf and his future. It has been fun to watch.\n\nMy husband and I highly recommend Mike Smith and Fore College Golf. You won’t be disappointed.\n\nAs Ignacio Jr informed you, he just committed to the University of New Mexico. It's been a wild ride of emotions, expectations, uncertainty, ups and downs, and finally relief and satisfaction.\n\nHaving lived abroad the last 10 years and only arriving back in the US for Ignacio's sophomore year put us at somewhat of a disadvantage in today's recruiting world that is looking at players 3-4 years before graduating.\n\nOur chance meeting on the back nine of HS State Finals really turned things around! As you mentioned to me at that moment, we had actually covered a lot of ground. What we were missing was how to make sense of it all, and especially how to confront the upcoming challenges. I now see how important that was. One thing is to contact coaches (lots of them) and hope that some of them respond, and another is what to do when they do! I appreciate that your were just a text away or a call away and always ready with an answer and strategy.\n\nThe way you arranged a college visit with 48hrs notice was also very impressive. And to get an offer 72hrs after that, no words....\n\nAlso, guiding us with respect to tournaments and understanding the different ranking systems, helped in making the right decisions as there are so many options out there.\n\nYou do your work well Michael. And you do it with passion. It has been a very genuine experience and both Ignacio and myself are very happy to have met you. Not only for your help during this process but also for the friendship we have developed.\n\nI look forward to keeping in touch in the years to come.\n\nBest regards and keep up the great work.\n\nThank you for everything!\n\nMichael Smith has been an invaluable addition to the 'team' supporting my son Andrew Farraye in pursuing his dream of playing high-level collegiate golf. Andrew plays for the Ponte Vedra HS golf team, as well as FSGA FJT and AJGA tournament golf. He has been the perfect complement to everything we do with Andrew. Mike has helped guide him through the college recruiting process with knowledge borne out of his recent personal experience as a collegiate golfer. He is highly technologically savvy, which along with his extensive knowledge base, allows him to best 'package' and present Andrew's skills to the coaches he seeks to reach. He meets regularly with my son, both in person as well as via computer video meetings, and Andrew really looks forward to these meetings. In addition, Michael stays on top of the college recruiting timeline 'action items' which for a busy working parent can be exceedingly difficult to do. He holds the young player accountable for upholding their responsibilities in the team process. He assists with building a professional looking 'playing resume' and swing videos, provides role-playing 'interviews' which help the player become more comfortable and impressive with their necessary coach communications, assists with identifying player strengths and weaknesses needing improvement with 'hard data' utilizing various technology programs and apps, responds to both player and parent questions and needs promptly via any means they prefer, and has even travelled to tournament(s) with my son when I was unable and also when he needed a caddy for a USGA event! In short, Michael goes far 'above and beyond' in just about every sense, and I am thrilled that I made the commitment to have him join Andrew's 'team'. I am confident that as a result Andrew will not only play the top-notch collegiate golf he so desires, but will have also learned numerous other valuable life lessons which will help him tremendously both in competitive golf and in the college classroom.\n\nFrom the moment me and FCG started talking, I knew we would have not just a working relationship but I would be building a friendship with Mike. Mike was not only able to work tirelessly on my complicated and long-drawn out transfer, but was able to do so with a smile and good humour! Mike adapted himself to my international needs, due to my visa restrictions – and with his help I was able to get myself in a situation with multiple offers for great schools that fit my needs. From the start Mike had a game plan that we both stuck to, which led to weekly catch-up’s and some late night messaging; but no matter what obstacle we encountered, Mike had a plan to deal with it. Fore College Golf has a great, personal, service – but gets the work done and the results (which we all know is the most important thing in golf) speak for themselves.\n\nOur son, Truman, was first introduced to golf the summer before high school. His talent grew swiftly and steadily during his freshman and sophomore years. We realized he had the talent to continue to play in college, but quickly found out that we were a bit late to, and unfamiliar with, the whole recruiting process. We signed up with a popular recruiting platform but had very little success getting the attention of teams/coaches that Truman was interested in playing for – D-1. Fore College Golf was first mentioned to us in November 2018. Truman was competing in a FCWT Tournament in Orlando, FL. He was a junior in high school, still with no college offers. We decided to reach out to Mike to see if he could help Truman with his recruiting progression. After our first meeting, we instantly had a new level of understanding of the process. Mike reviewed Truman’s resume and agreed to take him on as a client. He was also confident that his talent was D-1. Via hours of video calls, Mike guided Truman through the entire process. He had Truman establish a list of the top colleges that he would be interested in attending. He encouraged Truman to looked at all aspects of the colleges to ensure they were a good fit for him for both golf and academics. As the list narrowed, Mike educated Truman on how to communicate with coaches - how to separate himself from the others. Again, with Mike’s guidance, Truman then started reaching out to the coaches - requesting meetings and scheduling visits. Truman met with four colleges before he chose to accept the offer from Stetson University. Mike’s part in Truman’s recruiting process was truly immeasurable. His knowledge of the process and the time he invests in his clients to help ensure success is incredible. Thank You, Mike! Without Fore College Golf, Truman would not have the opportunity he now has.\n\nI first started with Mike and ForeCollegeGolf the fall of my Senior year. We had first heard of him through another golfer in the area who worked with Mike during my Junior year. My family and I knew that Mike would be a good option, but we decided that we would try to figure things out on our own, and had already worked a lot on my resume, went on a few visits, and contacted some coaches. Throughout this process, my scores started to slip and I lost touch with most of the coaches that I had been communicating with. My family and I started to consider Mike more and more and we had heard many great things from his clients. Mike and I started to communicate in late August of my Senior year and I could tell right away that we would work well together. Mike first helped me make a list of about 30 schools with some safety schools and some reach schools in each division and various conferences. Mike and I also made sure that all of these schools were good fits academically as well. He also helped me with my tournament schedule and made sure that the events I was playing in had strong competition. I was even able to play a Florida Junior Tour event with the help of Mike, which was a great experience being from Minnesota. When we started contacting coaches Mike had a very well organized plan for the phone calls and emails to coaches, which can be a bit confusing at times. My communication skills greatly benefited from this experience with all of the phone calls and emails I made. I was very impressed with the amount of time Michael spent with me and my family to help me find the right fit. We certainly got our money’s worth and Michael has stayed in touch well after I committed, even saying that he wants to stay in touch while at college to see how things are going. I made my decision to play golf for Hofstra University in New York just before Christmas break. Hofstra will be a great fit for me and I doubt I would be going there in the fall of 2019 without the help of Mike, considering I had never heard of the school before. I strongly recommend Michael to anyone who wants to play college golf and find their best fit.\n\nMy relationship with Mike began in January of my Sophomore Year of high school. I could immediately tell that we were going to do special things together. Mike, having gone through the college recruiting process himself and having played Division 1 Golf for James Madison, is very knowledgeable in his field. Mike improved my game by giving me multiple resources such as goal sheets, weekly practice plans, drill books, and mental game worksheets. Most importantly, he helped me become very comfortable and confident when speaking to coaches over the phone or face to face in person. Mike not only assisted my college recruiting process, he also taught me valuable skills that have carried over to everyday life as well. All in all, Mike is a great guy who will prove to be an enormous help to many junior golfers in the future. I highly recommend Mike to anyone trying to pursue college golf!\n\nI was introduced to Mike Smith through Matthew Cooke from Game Like Training Golf. I expressed my interest in playing college golf in the Summer just before my senior year, and this is where my relationship with Mike Smith started. Immediately I could tell that we would click. Mike is very knowledgeable about anything college golf, and we share similar interests. He has a lot of experience from a long amateur career as well as attending a great college golf program at James Madison University. Throughout the process, Mike stayed positive and was very motivating and this reflected on me at times where I was starting to lose hope that I would find a spot on a team. Furthermore, he was very flexible with meeting times, as I live in Denmark and that is a 6-hour tim ezone difference. Mike is very concerned about finding the right fit for you as an individual, and I felt this also reflected on me and it changed me into thinking more critically. I am absolutely certain that I would have never found as good a fit if it was not for Mike and ForeCollegeGolf. I would recommend Mike to anyone who is serious about playing college golf and want to find the right fit. I'm really looking forward to my time at LaGrange and keeping in touch with Mike going forward.\n\nMike is one of the best coaches I've ever had and even better person. He knows exactly how to find the best-fit college for each person and how to be successful in the recruiting process. When I first started working with ForeCollegeGolf, I had no idea what to do or where to go with college recruiting. This was my sophomore year in high school. At the beginning, I didn’t even know the difference between D1, D2, and D3, and how college golf works, So we had to start everything from ground zero. Mike taught me how to write letters to coaches, how to show my interest to coaches, ask questions to coaches, and gave me keys to focus on and look for in order to find the best college. After about 15 months working with Mike, I had received interest and multiple offers (more than 15 colleges). Without Mike's knowledge, experience, and advice, I would not have been successful during the college recruiting process.\n\nBeginning my Junior year I thought that playing college golf was just a dream, however, after meeting Mike I began to think it could be a reality. I was the first person in my family to try and play college sports so I felt lost but talking to Mike and seeing all the resources I knew I was with the right person. We talked about mailing coaches and setting up a resume but the best thing I learned from Mike was how to communicate with coaches. Mike's communication skills and friendly attitude during every meeting was a great example, not just as a way to reach out to coaches but also as a way to live life. I ended up not playing college golf because it wasn’t for me but even after working with Mike and ForeCollegeGolf, he still continues to be interested in what I am doing and how my life is going. Working with Mike shocked me because I felt that he doesn’t do what he does for money but because he truly wants his people to succeed and reach their goals. I consider Mike a very good friend and I can’t thank Mike enough for all the time and effort he put in while we worked together.\n\nI had an incredible overall experience with Mike and ForeCollegeGolf. He was extremely knowledgeable throughout the entire process. I learned so much during our time together, but on top of that, Mike made it fun and enjoyable. During our meetings together, I could really see how much he truly cared about my game and what my success meant to him. Mike is very easy to relate to and I always looked forward to our meetings. I felt comfortable sharing my opinions and Mike made it known that he would value my input at all times. Mike added nothing but confidence and positive reinforcement through my recruiting process. I am so thankful to have had the special opportunity to work with Mike and ForeCollegeGolf. I worked extremely hard throughout the recruiting process but I owe a good deal of that to Mike and ForeCollegeGolf for providing me with the tools and necessary assistance to get where I needed to go. If you are confused, lost or frustrated with your current recruiting efforts, I would recommend Mike and ForeCollegeGolf above all.\n\nMy family and I met Mike in September of 2017. At that time, I had previously missed out on a few scholarships that I thought were \"shoe'in's\". Mike and I worked very hard to get things back on track and right away I could tell he really cared about all of his players. After we spoke with him one time, Mike got to work. Mike assisted me with everything from my golf game to the admissions process at St. Leo. At the beginning, our goal was to take a full-gap year and start college in August of 2018 but Mike worked his magic and begged me to trust in what we were doing. Three months later, I was committed to St. Leo. Honestly, I couldn’t believe it. In the end, Mike's work ethic and understanding of the process made all the difference. He encouraged me to work hard and trust in the process. I couldn't believe it but I'm headed to play golf at one of the best universities in Division 2. I'm extremely glad that I met Mike and worked with him. I know it was a short period of time but looking back on it, everything went so smoothly. I strongly encourage you to set up a meeting with Mike and to work with ForeCollegeGolf.\n\nI want to thank you for your help with my son’s college golf recruiting process. Moving from Michigan to the South to pursue a college golf career presented many challenges. The largest of which was our lack of knowledge regarding opportunities to play in the South. Thanks to your help we were able to navigate the many possibilities available. You helped introduce my son to colleges and coaches he would not have likely contacted otherwise. As a result, he found a fit that was right for him and is very pleased with his scholarship commitment to an outstanding university.\n\nYou also helped Matthew in the process of communicating with college coaches. He was able to refine his approach and speak confidently. You helped him with his presentation, which I feel gave coaches a sense of his commitment and maturity which is a valuable tool whether you are speaking with a potential coach or future employer.\n\nOverall, we are very glad we committed to your ForeCollegeGolf program. I would recommend your service to any young man or woman trying to pursue their dream of playing college golf.\n\nWhen I began the process of college recruiting I was lost. It was January of my senior year of high school and I knew that time was not on my side. I had nothing on the table, not a single offer. Not even interest from a coach! No one in my family had ever gone to college so I was not able to ask them for any advice. All that I knew is that I wanted to play college golf, but given the circumstances I was losing hope on that dream. When I heard about Mike Smith and ForeCollegeGolf I was not sure what to expect, but after we had our first conversation I had hope that my dream of college golf could become a reality. Within a few weeks of working with Mike I had not only an offer from a school, but even several to choose from. ForeCollegeGolf gave me a proven plan that I could use to connect with golf coaches from all over the country. I had everything I needed to help me be recruited and more. Besides all this the most important thing I had on my side was Mike. When we had our first conversation I could tell that he was not doing this for the money, but rather because he has a passion for helping junior golfers like me, make our dreams of playing college golf become a reality. Mike is always there to help with anything you ask him, and there is no one better to have helping you than him. I am proud to say that because of Mike Smith and Fore College Golf's help I get to make my dream of collegiate golf become a reality."
