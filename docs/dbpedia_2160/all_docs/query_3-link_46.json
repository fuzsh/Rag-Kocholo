        "text": "Evidence of Oklahoma State’s rise to prominence on both the Big 12 and national stage during Mike Gundy’s tenure is everywhere:\n\n• Since 2010, Oklahoma State has eight seasons with at least 10 wins, an outright Big 12 title (2011), a share of the Big 12 South title (2010) and appearances in the Big 12 Championship game in 2021 and 2023. OSU reached the top 10 of the Associated Press poll in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\n• Gundy has coached the Cowboys to five New Year’s Six bowl games since the 2009 season. The Pokes appeared in the 2010 Cotton Bowl, the 2012 Fiesta Bowl, the 2014 Cotton Bowl, the 2016 Sugar Bowl and the 2022 Fiesta Bowl.\n\n• Oklahoma State is one of only three teams in the FBS to post a winning season every year from 2006-23, joining Boise State and Wisconsin. All of those seasons have come under Mike Gundy.\n\n• Entering the 2024 season, Oklahoma State has been ranked in the top 15 of the Associated Press poll in 14 of the past 16 seasons and has posted 10-win seasons eight of the past 14 years.\n\n• The Cowboys have won a total of 130 games from 2010 until now to rank among the top 10 programs in the FBS during that span.\n\n• Gundy has led the Cowboys to 83 Big 12 win from 2010 through 2023, more than any other current member of the conference. His 102 career wins in Big 12 games rank third in the history of the conference, trailing only Bob Stoops (121) and Bill Snyder (104) on the all-time chart.\n\n• OSU has recorded 11 victories over teams ranked in the Associated Press top 10 since 2008. Gundy has 40 career wins vs. AP Top 25 opponents, and Dabo Swinney is the only other active coach with more wins over AP Top 25 teams at his current school.\n\n• Mike Gundy, Kirby Smart, Dabo Swinney, Ryan Day and Mack Brown are the only active head coaches with teams who have finished seasons ranked in the FBS top five in total offense and total defense.\n\n• From 2010 through 2023, the Cowboys have averaged 37.2 points and 473.0 yards of total offense per game. Oklahoma State has ranked in the top 10 nationally in scoring offense six times during Gundy’s tenure as head coach and has ranked in the top 10 nationally in total offense seven times. The Cowboys led the nation in turnover margin in 2011 and have ranked in the top 10 nationally in that category four times since the start of the 2011 season.\n\n• Over the past few seasons, the Cowboys have put up some dominant numbers on defense too. OSU has now finished a season ranked among the FBS top 10 in total defense, scoring defense, rushing defense, third down defense, fourth down defense, sacks, tackles for loss and defensive touchdowns. Included in those numbers are No. 1 national finishes in third down defense, sacks and defensive touchdowns.\n\n• OSU’s current streak of 18 straight bowl games and 18 straight winning seasons is the best in the history of the program. The bowl streak is the sixth-longest active streak in the nation, and is the longest active streak in the nation for one coach at one school.\n\n• Gundy ranks third among all active head coaches with 166 wins at his current school.\n\n• Entering the 2024 NFL Draft, 38 Gundy-era Cowboys have been drafted into the NFL with six chosen in the first round.\n\n• Just since 2017, Gundy has coached the leading passer in the FBS (Mason Rudolph in 2017), the leading receiver in the FBS (James Washington in 2017) and the leading rusher in the FBS (Chuba Hubbard in 2019 and Ollie Gordon II in 2023).\n\n• Gundy’s coaching tree has blossomed. Former Gundy assistants include Middle Tennessee State head coach Derek Mason, former Houston head coach Dana Holgorsen, Arizona State offensive coordinator Marcus Arroyo, Baylor offensive coordinator Jake Spavital, former Penn State offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich, Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken, Ohio State defensive coordinator Jim Knowles and former North Carolina head coach Larry Fedora. Other notable former Gundy assistants include Western Michigan offensive coordinator Walt Bell, Sam Houston offensive coordinator Brad Cornelsen, former Georgia Tech defensive coordinator Andrew Thacker, North Carolina cornerbacks coach Jason Jones, Missouri running backs coach Curtis Luper, Philadelphia Eagles assistant head coach and running backs coach Jemal Singleton, Maryland wide receivers coach Gunter Brewer, Middle Tennessee offensive coordinator Bodie Reeder and second coach Bryce Lewis, Tulsa defensive passing game coordinator Michael Hunter Jr. and defensive run game coordinator Koy McFarland and Louisiana Tech wide receivers coach Lorenzo Joe, among others.\n\n• OSU has also excelled in the classroom during Mike Gundy’s tenure as head coach. In 2018, OSU was one of only five FBS programs to earn the AFCA’s Academic Achievement Award and it posted a perfect score of 1,000 on the NCAA Academic Progress Rate (APR) that same year. In the APR data released in 2019, OSU ranked second in the Big 12 with a multi-year APR rate of 982, a mark that ranks as the best for OSU since the NCAA began its tracking. In 2023, the Cowboy football team’s 976 was the third-best in program history.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nMike Gundy is a true Cowboy.\n\nHe has spent more than half of his life either quarterbacking or coaching at Oklahoma State and has been part more than 400 games as a Cowboy. As head coach he is now presiding over the era of greatest sustained success in the history of the program.\n\nWhat he has done at Oklahoma State is remarkable. When he took over as head coach on January 3, 2005, the OSU football program had an all-time record of 473-496-48 (48.9 pct.). With Gundy at the helm, OSU is 166-79-0 (67.8 pct.). Oklahoma State had 16 bowl appearances in its 105 seasons prior to Gundy, but with him as head coach the Cowboys have made 18 bowl appearances in 19 years, only missing one his first year in 2005.\n\nHe didn’t take over a program known for consistent success, but Oklahoma State has indeed become a powerful program under his watch. How did it happen?\n\nThere are a number of key factors in the Cowboys’ rise to prominence, but one of the most notable is that Gundy identified and executed a blueprint for success at Oklahoma State that starts with the culture and people and extends into success on the field.\n\nThe Cowboy Culture\n\nWhat’s interesting about Gundy’s “Cowboy Culture” is that Gundy readily admits that in his early years as coach, he didn’t have a name for it and wasn’t strategically plotting a path that led to it. He just consistently made decisions based on what he thought was the right thing to do and empowered others to do the same.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2017 that the words “Cowboy Culture” began popping up around the football facility in Boone Pickens Stadium.\n\nThe signs that now hang on the walls there highlight concepts that Gundy places a high value on, such as “DAT” (Discipline and Toughness), controlling the things that you can control and being respectful. They celebrate foundational traits like effort, focus, toughness and leadership. They remind passers-by to never show fear, frustration or fatigue.\n\nWhile the Cowboy Culture reveals itself in on-field success, it also shows up off the field, most notably in the area of academics.\n\nTake into consideration that through the spring semester of 2023, 469 Gundy-era players have graduated from Oklahoma State and that the Cowboy football program posted a perfect score of 1,000 on the NCAA’s Academic Progress Rate (APR) in 2018. Additionally, OSU football’s multi-year APR rate of 982 that was announced in 2019 represented the highest it has achieved since the APR was implemented in 2003. OSU’s 2020 multi-year APR rate of 979 was its second-highest ever and tied for the Big 12 lead. 2022 showed a still-impressive mark of 973 and in 2023 the Cowboy football team’s 976 was the third-best in program history.\n\nOSU led the Big 12 and set a then-program record with 20 first-team Academic All-Big 12 selections in 2017. They followed that with a conference-best and then-school-record 26 overall Academic All-Big 12 honorees in 2018 and 20 honorees again in 2019. OSU followed that in 2020 with a then-league football record of 28 first-team selections and a school record with 43 total selections, and then matched it with 28 first-team selections again in 2021 and exceeded it with 29 in both 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn 2017, three Cowboys – running back Justice Hill, center Brad Lundblade and fullback Britton Abbott – earned spots on the CoSIDA Academic All-America team and both Abbott and Hill repeated in 2018. Kicker Alex Hale received the regognition in 2023. During Gundy’s time as head coach at Oklahoma State, his players have received CoSIDA Academic All-America honors nine times.\n\nIn addition to the academic recognition from CoSIDA, Lundblade was one of 10 finalists for the 2017 National Football Foundation Campbell Trophy, which is also known as the Academic Heisman. He was also one of only three student-athletes who represented the Big 12 Conference on the NCAA Autonomy Governance Committee in 2017.\n\nIt’s hard to instill a culture that produces that kind of fruit in a short period of time, so Gundy’s longevity and staying power have both factored into OSU’s success.\n\nGundy is tied with Utah’s Kyle Whittingham as the second-longest tenured coach at his active school in the FBS, trailing only Kirk Ferentz at Iowa. His 102 career wins in Big 12 Conference games rank third in the history of the league, trailing only Bob Stoops and Bill Snyder.\n\nOn the Field\n\nOf course, college football is a tough business in which longevity and staying power are hard to come by for coaches who don’t win games, but Gundy is indeed a winner. He coached the Cowboys to the 2011 Big 12 championship and has posted eight 10-win seasons. Gundy has coached Oklahoma State to five bowl games now referred to as the New Year’s Six since the 2009 season (2010 Cotton Bowl, 2012 Fiesta Bowl, 2014 Cotton Bowl, 2016 Sugar Bowl and 2022 Fiesta Bowl) and has led the Cowboys to bowl games and winning records in 18 consecutive seasons – both school records.\n\nIncluded among his career coaching accolades are 2011 National Coach of the Year, 2023, 2021 and 2010 Big 12 Coach of the Year and 2015 AFCA Region 4 Coach of the Year.\n\nSignature traits of Gundy’s best teams have varied slightly over the years, but he has built elite-level units in all three phases of the game.\n\nFrom an offensive perspective, the Cowboys have averaged 37.2 points per game since 2010, a mark that ranks fifth in the FBS. During that same time span, OSU also ranks among the national leaders in total offense per game (473.0), passing yards per game (301.0 yards per game) and yards per play (6.3).\n\nThe offensive talent that Gundy has coached at Oklahoma State during his tenure is remarkable. Receiver Justin Blackmon is one of only two players ever to win the Biletnikoff Award presented to the nation’s top receiver twice, as he accomplished the feat in 2010 and again in 2011. James Washington joined Blackmon in the Biletnikoff Award fraternity by winning the award in 2017 to make Oklahoma State one of only three schools with three Biletnikoff Awards to its credit. Running back Chuba Hubbard was a unanimous All-American in 2019. Running back Ollie Gordon II was the Doak Walker Award winner ad unanimous All-America pick in 2023. Running back Kendall Hunter was a two-time consensus All-American. Quarterback Mason Rudolph won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and was an All-American in 2017. Blackmon was an NFL first-round draft pick, as were tight end Brandon Pettigrew, offensive lineman Russell Okung, receiver Dez Bryant and quarterback Brandon Weeden. Running back Chris Carson was a standout for the Seattle Seahawks and receiver Tyreek Hill is one of the NFL’s most dangerous weapons for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nSince 2017, Gundy has coached the leading passer in the FBS (Rudolph in 2017), the leading receiver in the FBS (Washington in 2017) and the leading rusher in the FBS (Hubbard in 2019 and Gordon in 2023).\n\nDefensively, forcing turnovers and getting pressure in the backfield have been the Cowboys’ signature traits of the Gundy era. Oklahoma State is third in the FBS with 334 turnovers forced since 2010. OSU ranked in the top 10 in the nation in turnovers forced in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015.\n\nThe Cowboys have also taken their place among the nation’s best at winning at the line of scrimmage and defending on third down in recent years. OSU ranked among the FBS top 20 in tackles for loss per game in 2006, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022, and sacks per game in 2006, 2015, 2018, 2020 and 2021, when it ranked No. 1 in the FBS. OSU’s defense also led the FBS in third down defense and defensive touchdowns in 2020 and was among the FBS top five in total defense, rushing defense and third down defense in 2021. In 2023, the Cowboys ranked No. 2 in the country in fourth down defense.\n\nSome of the most notable defensive players of the Gundy era include linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez, who was an All-American in 2021, cornerback Justin Gilbert, who was an All-American in 2013 and also a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award before being selected with the eighth pick of the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft, and defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah, who was a 2015 All-American and the 2015 Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year before being chosen 32nd overall in the 2016 NFL Draft.\n\nDynamic special teams have also factored into Gundy’s success. In fact, he spends much of his game-planning on special teams and is at his most vocal on the practice field during special teams periods. Matt Fodge won the Ray Guy Award presented to the nation’s top punter in 2008 and Dan Bailey won the Lou Groza Award presented to the nation’s top kicker in 2010. Quinn Sharp was an All-America punter in 2010 and an All-America kicker in 2011 and 2012. Return men have also thrived as part of Oklahoma State’s special teams, with Perrish Cox earning All-America honors in 2008, the same year that Dez Bryant was honored as the Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Year. Tyreek Hill was a first team All-Big 12 return man in 2014 who has earned seven Pro Bowl selections since moving on to the NFL. Zach Sinor led the nation in punts downed inside the 20 in 2016 and kicker Alex Hale was the 2023 NCAA statistical champion with 2.08 made field goals per game.\n\nWhen looking at the Gundy era at Oklahoma State, it’s hard to find a position group that hasn’t produced big-time talent.

He was a four-year starter at OSU from 1986-89 and led the Cowboys to a pair of bowl wins - the 1987 Sun Bowl over West Virginia and the 1988 Holiday Bowl over Wyoming. During those two seasons, OSU accumulated a 20-4 record.\n\nGundy ended his career as the Big Eight Conference’s all-time leader in passing and total offense. More than 20 years after his playing career, his name is still featured throughout the OSU record books. Most of his personal marks stood until Gundy assumed head coaching duties. He began his college career by throwing 138 passes before tossing his first career interception. That streak remained an NCAA record until 2008.\n\nCoaching Career\n\nAfter graduation, Gundy immediately joined the Oklahoma State football staff at the age of 23. He coached the receivers in 1990, the quarterbacks from 1991-1993 and in 1994, served as offensive coordinator during the final year for Gundy’s college coach, Pat Jones. Gundy coached in Stillwater under each of the three previous Cowboy head coaches (Jones, Bob Simmons and Les Miles).\n\nHe spent one season at Baylor (1996) as quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator before heading to the ACC, where he coached at Maryland from 1997-2000. He returned to Stillwater in 2001 as assistant head coach and offensive coordinator, and he also coached OSU quarterbacks.\n\nGundy is just the third Oklahoma State graduate to assume the head coaching duties in Stillwater. Jim Lookabaugh (1939-49) and Floyd Gass (1969-71) were the others.\n\nPersonal\n\nGundy and his wife, Kristen (also an OSU graduate), have three children, Gavin, Gunnar and Gage. Gunnar also played quarterback at Oklahoma State."
