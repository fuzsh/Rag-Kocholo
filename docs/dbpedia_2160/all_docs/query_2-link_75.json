        "text": "Already one of our industry’s best and brightest stars, celebrity hairstylist Johnny Wright is now looking to take his natural hair expertise on the road.\n\nThat’s right, the legendary stylist and motivational speaker will soon be popping up in a city near you while on his upcoming 11-city “Naturally You” Tour. Wright made the official announcement during the Essence Festival in New Orleans on Saturday, July 1st, alongside his premiere partner MYAVANA at their Hair Lab in the Ernest Morial Convention Center. If you’re hoping to catch Wright while he’s on the road, his tour will officially kick-off on Friday, July 7th in Chicago, IL, which just so happens to be his hometown.\n\nCelebrating Hair Health and Self-Love\n\nInspired by his bestselling book, Natural and Curly Hair for Dummies, the “Naturally You” Tour aims to provide a safe, informative, and celebratory space for people of all backgrounds to come together, share their stories, connect with one another, and heal by dispelling conscious and unconscious biases about how they look, feel, and move about the world. With diversity and inclusion as a focus, this tour hopes to empower attendees to embrace their natural beauty and promote self-love and acceptance.\n\nSo, what can you expect on this tour? Attendees will be entertained with an array of panel discussions featuring some of the country’s leading hair experts, thought leaders, and industry visionaries. Not to mention, they will have the opportunity to enjoy an engaging cocktail hour to mix and mingle—all while exploring Wright’s curated vendor’s row, featuring his favorite hair, beauty, and lifestyle brands.\n\nWhether you’re a naturalista or not, Wright invites all races, genders, and backgrounds to join him on this exciting journey of self-discovery and transformation.\n\n“The ‘Naturally You’ tour is not just about embracing our natural beauty, it’s about dismantling the harmful ‘isms’ that have plagued our society for far too long,” he says. “It’s time to heal from colorism, racism, and lookism, and this tour is a movement towards that goal. I can’t wait to connect with my fellow sisters and brothers and share what it truly means to be Naturally YOU.”\n\nA Transformative Experience Powered by MYAVANA\n\nThe “Naturally You” tour is powered by its premiere partner, MYAVANA, a groundbreaking Black, female-founded and run beauty tech company that pioneered scientific intelligence hair analysis. Put simply, it uses AI technology to analyze your unique hair type, texture, and condition to establish your unique Hair ID.\n\nThroughout the tour, MYAVANA will be inviting attendees to stop by their Hair Lab to experience its new HairAI™ technology, get 1:1 consultation with healthy hair experts, and receive personalized product recommendations to conquer hair challenges and achieve hair goals.\n\n“Partnering with Johnny on the “Naturally You” Tour is in alignment with MYAVANA’s core values of acceptance, pride, self-love, and striving for excellence—all of which are things we face in our personal hair journeys as we’re evolving to become our authentic selves,” said Candace Mitchell Harris, the founder & CEO of MYAVANA. “We are excited for everyone to experience a cultural and spiritual awakening through this tour by connecting through the hair and life stories that bond us and learn all about the science, technology, and luxury of healthy hair.”"
