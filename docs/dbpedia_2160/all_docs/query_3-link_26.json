        "text": "1) I grew up in central Illinois, and listened to the WLS Barn Dance out of Chicago. My favorite stars were Homer & Jethro, Captain Stubby and the Buccaneers, and Lula Belle & Scotty Wiseman. I was wondering if you ever played the Barn Dance and/or traveled with any of the stars from there?\n\nThe Barn Dance on WLS went away in 1957, when the station switched to a rock ‘n roll format, and I didn’t come to Nashville until a couple of years later. Although the show continued on WGN until 1968, I was never invited to appear. I did tour some with Homer & Jethro and with Red Foley, but I think by that time they had both left the Barn Dance. It was a great show and holds a prominent place in country music history.\n\n2) I’ve always been curious as to how someone like you, who has had a successful career performing and songwriting, protects his songs and ensures the “mailbox money” keeps coming. Do you have people help you with making those deals or have you done a lot of that yourself through the years?\n\nThe tracking of record sales, streaming, and song performances is done through the publisher of the song or their assigns, and through the Performing Rights Organization that licenses the song, in my case BMI. They do the day to day work and account to me twice every year (the publisher) and every quarter (BMI). If I tried to do that kind of work myself I’d never have time to write songs or do anything else.\n\n3) My mother-in-law shared with us two letters from WSM showing that she performed twice at the Junior Grand Ole Opry back in 1956. Would you happen to have any information about the days of the Junior Opry or give us any insight as to where there might be an archive of these performances?\n\nThe Junior Grand Ole Opry was a live Saturday morning radio show on WSM back in the 50’s that originated in the station’s Studio C before a live audience. It was formatted to feature young (I don’t know the age limits) performers who aspired to sing and play country music. I once applied to be on the show with my Avondale Playboys band around 1954 or ’55, and was accepted. I had to cancel, though, when some of my musicians couldn’t or wouldn’t make the trip to Nashville. As to where any of those old shows might be archived I would have no idea.\n\n4) Our Question Of The Month comes from Craig in Utah. He writes, “I love to sing, especially good country music. But how do I learn to sing like me and not try to sound like the original artist?\n\nI can really relate to this question, because as a teenager I faced the same situation. If I was singing a Hank Williams song, I tried to sing it like Hank. Or Faron Young, Ernest Tubb, Webb Pierce or the other stars of the day. I only began to sing like myself when I started to write my own songs. With an original song that I’d never heard anybody else sing, I was forced to sing it like Bill Anderson. I would suggest you try the same thing. Write your own songs so there’s nothing else for you to copy. Then you HAVE to be original. Good luck.\n\nQuickies: Where is Jimmy Lance? I always enjoyed listening to his guitar playing perfection on your song, “Golden Guitar.” Jimmy was the original guitar player in my Po’ Boys band back in the sixties. Afterward, he worked many years for Eddy Arnold. He passed away a couple of years ago. I think everyone would agree that Patsy Cline was one of the greatest. Did you ever share the stage with her and did you ever record any songs together? Patsy and I had the same booking agent, the late Hubert Long, so we worked quite a few concert dates together. And, of course, we performed on many of the same nights at the Opry. We never recorded together, however, even though we were on the same record label. I just watched Nashville Public Television’s wonderful documentary on the life of Minnie Pearl. Did you often appear with Minnie on the Opry and did you ever see her socially away from the Opry? Yes, Minnie and I were often on the Opry together, and I remember what a thrill it always was to introduce her to the audience then step aside and watch her perform. As much as we loved one another, we seldom were together socially. Our contrasting schedules basically prevented it. Have you ever done any duets with your bluegrass friends? Not as much as I would have liked. The Osborne Brothers sang with me on my recording of “Philadelphia Lawyer” many years ago, and I appeared in a video with Dailey & Vincent (“Feel Good Music”), but that’s about it. In July, 1961, when you were first inducted into the Grand Ole Opry did you ever dream you would someday be the Opry’s longest ongoing member? Heavens, no! Back then I just hoped they wouldn’t lose my phone number and would ask me to be on the next week’s show! Would you rather be remembered as a songwriter or as a performing/recording artist? As Mac Wiseman used to sing, it would be “sweet to be remembered” in any capacity. I imagine if anyone remembers me after I’m gone, though, it will be for the songs I have written. And that’s fine with me.\n\nI hope you will remember to send me any country music related questions you might have so we can do this again in our September newsletter. Send them to me at askbill@billanderson.com and I’ll do my best to answer. If yours is chosen our Question Of The Month, you will receive any item of your choice from our online store free of charge. Stay curious, and I’ll look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n1) Did you ever meet Cindy Walker or record any of her music?\n\nI knew Cindy quite well and, in fact, two days before I received this question I took part in a PBS documentary being filmed about her life. I think it will air in the fall. The only song of hers that I remember recording was a country version of “In The Misty Moonlight.” She once wrote a song especially for me, though, that unfortunately I never got around to cutting. There is talk of a new album of her music to accompany the documentary, and if there is, I’m hoping to finally record that song after all these years.\n\n2) It’s hard to imagine artists like George Strait, Alan Jackson, and Hank Williams, of course, not wearing a cowboy type hat, and yet others like you never do. My question is who decides if a western hat is appropriate? Is it the artist? An image consultant? I once stared at a photo of Hank Williams without one and thought he is human just like me.\n\nAll artists are human just like you, believe me! Back in my day, the artists that I knew decided for themselves whether or not to wear a hat on stage…Ernest Tubb, Tex Ritter, Eddy Arnold, etc. In recent years, however, I highly suspect that image consultants have become involved. I say that because, if you notice, no two artists’ hats look alike. Brad Paisley, Tim McGraw, George Strait, Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson, Clint Black and others each have their own individual shapes, colors, and styles. I doubt they took the time to figure all that out for themselves. They probably had help. The newer generation, however, has mostly traded western hats for baseball caps…most of them worn backwards. You can tell I’m not a current big star because when I wear a ball cap, the brim faces to the front. And guess what…it keeps the sun out of my eyes!\n\n3) Can we send your grandson, Gabe, a letter? I have prayed for him in the past and thought he was doing good. I’d like to send him a card if it’s o.k.\n\nThat’s very nice…thank you. I’m sure Gabe would enjoy hearing from you and knowing that you are keeping him in your thoughts and prayers. You can mail your cards or letters to Gabe Anderson, P.O. Box 888, Hermitage, TN. 37076, and I’ll see that he gets your message. Thanks again.\n\nOur July Question of The Month comes from Sandra in Alabama. She writes, “Everybody seems to write songs about pretty women and young love. Have you ever written a song about an older lady or ‘senior love’? Our ways may not be young & carefree, but we still have heart & feelings.”\n\nWhen I first read your question I thought of Ronnie McDowell’s hit from 1981, “Older Women (Make Beautiful Lovers)” It reached #1 in the charts, so lots of people obviously agree with you. I wrote and recorded a song called “If Anything Ever Happened To You” a few years back about a couple marking their 50th wedding anniversary, and I’ve written others. My upcoming EP, “Forevermore,” has several songs that address the subject of “mature love.” I hope you’ll enjoy them when you hear them.\n\nQuickies: Music people like you usually love many types of music. If you were to listen to music other than country, what would it be? You’re right in that I like many types of music with traditional country being my favorite. But I also listen to some bluegrass, some gospel, and for relaxation I like smooth jazz. Now that we are in 2014, when Bill Anderson listens to music in his home is he listening to the radio, streaming services, CD’s, or LP’s? Yes. And you left out the music services on TV, although those may actually be considered “streaming”. I listen to them all. Your song, “The Tip(s) Of My Fingers” has been recorded both as “Tip” and “Tips”. Roy Clark’s original Capitol recording has it listed as “Tips”, but when he re-recorded it for Dot Records it was listed as “Tip.” Did it just depend on who took down the song titles for the album? I guess so, and while we’re on that subject another fan writes: Who had the biggest hit on “Tips Of My Fingers?” According to Billboard magazine, which is not the only source for chart numbers, but is one of the most respected, Eddy Arnold and Steve Wariner both had versions that topped out at #3 in the charts. My original version reached #7, Roy Clark’s version reached #10, and Jean Shepard’s climbed to #16. I think it’s about time one of today’s hot, young artists recorded it, don’t you? Steve’s record is the most recent and it’s been over 30-years ago now. There’s a whole new generation that needs to hear that song! I just heard that James Gregory passed away. I saw him on Country’s Family Reunion with you and thought he was very funny. What did you think of his humor? He was often called “The Funniest Man In America,” and you won’t get any argument from me! He was hilarious. Where was the largest crowd you ever performed for? Was it overseas somewhere? No, I don’t think so. It was probably when I sang at halftime of the Georgia vs. Tennessee football game in 1972. There were over 80,000 people in the stands in Athens, Georgia, that day, and most of them stayed in their seats when we performed. Will there ever be a Country’s Family Reunion with any of the artists like Reba, Alan Jackson, and others of that generation? I doubt it. Larry Black, who owns the title and the concept, has retired and is not producing shows anymore. For the record, let me say that Alan and Reba and many others of “that generation” were invited to appear on our shows many times, but most of them declined the invitation. It would have been great to have had them.\n\nAnd it would be great to get a question or two from you for our August newsletter.
