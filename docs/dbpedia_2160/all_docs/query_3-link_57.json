I am extremely passionate about helping new actors get started in show business. So if you have the dream to be on the big screen… I am devoted to providing you the information necessary to make it happen!”\n\nI have always loved the entertainment business. When I was little girl sitting on my bedroom floor singing to records of Michael Jackson and Barry White I knew I was going to grow up and be a singer. I worked hard, over came a lot of fears and self doubt and became a professional singer. I’ve had three top 40 dance hits in Europe and have sung on over 60 CDs, done four Verizon commercials, various soundtracks and opened or performed with The Four Tops, Rose Royce, Billie Myers, Wayne Brady, Solomon Burke, Tony Scott, Basic Black, Jonny Lang, Art Deco and His Society Orchestra, Investiture of Royalty and other very high profile events. I’ve made quite a bit of money doing it.\n\nI’ve done TV, Film and wrote a book called “Contrary Action” which led me to appeared on numerous radio and television shows including The Oprah Winfrey Show where I was interviewed by the legend herself. What an amazing experience. All that way from my purple bedroom in Connecticut. So when you talk to me understand this… I understand you. I see your potentially fully manifested. I see beyond your doubts and fears. I see what you are going to become.They say all you need in life is one person to believe in you -Well know this today, I BELIEVE IN YOU. Know that right now, where ever you are, I believe in you. I KNOW you are capable of great things!\n\nLike most Hollywood execs, I worked my way up in the business starting as an assistant to many high profile Managers, Agents and Publicists in the careers of Neil Patrick Harris, Johnny Galecki, Sarah Michelle Geller, The Four Tops, The Bee Gees, Meatloaf, Whoopi Goldberg, Steve Guttenberg, The Cranberries Michael Jackson, Barbra Streisand, Kenny Rogers, and Neil Diamond. I worked at huge companies including Fox TV, Sony Studios, APA, & Virgin Records. I also had the pleasure of being assistant to director John Singleton. In my 30’s I became a Talent Agent at Burnt Down Entertainment and then started my management company 12 years ago. During the past 25 years I have been a Recording Artist, Music Producer, Talent Agent and Talent Manager. This extensive, varied experience has given me 360-degree perspective of the industry, something many reps don’t have and the majority of artists lack. It allows me to have the privilege of HELPING a lot of talented and special people.\n\nAs an artist you will always be looking for ways to be creative and express yourself…to learn, grow and expand. Here we are 30 years after I moved to LA and I just pitched a TV show to Discovery Channel for which they are working on the pilot presentation. Also, I just finished shooting my first short film STARDUST which I wrote, produced, co-directed, and starred in. It has been playing in film festivals around the world!"
