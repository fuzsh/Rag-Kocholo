You may also be looking for the game Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney or the Ace Attorney series in general.\n\nPhoenix Wright is a veteran defense attorney who heads the Wright Anything Agency. Mostly specializing in criminal trials, Wright is renowned for his ability to turn seemingly hopeless cases around.\n\nBeginning his career under Mia Fey in 2016, he was disbarred in 2019 after unknowingly presenting forged evidence. After spending the following seven years as a pianist who moonlighted as an undefeated poker player at the Borscht Bowl Club, he was instrumental in the organization of a test trial for the Jurist System, resulting in his exoneration and reinstatement into the bar.\n\nWright has also been a defendant himself at least three times in his life, each time either hiring a different lawyer, or representing himself.\n\nEarly life\n\nPhoenix Wright grew up as an only child. He once told Apollo Justice that he was raised in a barn, to explain the untidiness of his hospital bed, although he was likely just joking or invoking a turn of phrase (\"Were you born/raied in a barn?\"). At one point in his life, Wright broke into a cattle ranch and tipped some cows.[3]\n\nYears later, Luke Atmey stated that Wright probably received the same message on his school report card every year: \"Careless, with tendency to jump to conclusions\"; judging from the lawyer's reaction, this was not far from the truth. Wright has stated that his teachers always said he was \"a good thunker\" [sic] and has related that it was pouring with rain on the day of his elementary school graduation.\n\nThe class trial\n\nMain article: Class trial\n\nPerhaps the most transformative incident in Wright's early life was during fourth grade, when his class accused Wright of stealing the lunch money of a classmate, Miles Edgeworth. Since Wright was the only student not in gym class when the theft had occurred, everyone—including the teacher—assumed Wright was the culprit, but Edgeworth came to his defense. Edgeworth pointed out that, while everyone kept saying that Wright was guilty, no one had any evidence. Regardless, the class continued to accuse Wright, claiming they did not need proof to know that he was the thief, but Larry Butz, the class troublemaker, also stood up for Wright. He accused the class of ganging up on Wright, and not considering how he felt. Ultimately, the teacher ended the trial, declaring Wright not guilty, and replaced the money herself. Wright, Edgeworth, and Butz became inseparable friends after this incident. Fifteen years later, it was finally revealed that, despite not being in school that day, Butz was the one who had stolen the lunch money, though Edgeworth had known this all along.\n\nAt the time, Edgeworth idolized his famous father Gregory Edgeworth, a legendary defense attorney. The class trial would prove to be a powerful inspiration for Wright during his legal career. After the DL-6 Incident, which resulted in Gregory's death, Miles transferred schools and moved out of town.\n\nUniversity years\n\nMain article: Turnabout Memories\n\nWright went on to study art and law at Ivy University. During his time there, he saw a story in a newspaper with the headline \"Dark Suspicions of a Demon Attorney\". The article said that prosecutor Miles Edgeworth was suspected of tampering with witnesses and fabricating evidence; it appeared that Edgeworth had become a ruthless prosecutor, unrecognizable from the friend that Wright knew from his childhood. Although Wright attempted to contact his childhood friend, he never received a reply. He decided that if he became an attorney, Edgeworth would be forced to meet him eventually in court, whereupon Wright could confront and help him see the error of his ways.\n\nIn his third year at university, Wright met Dahlia Hawthorne in the District Court basement library and was immediately enamored with her. She wrote him a poem and gave him a bottle necklace, telling him that it was a symbol of their love. They subsequently began to date, though in all subsequent meetings, and unbeknown to Wright, \"Dahlia\" was replaced with Iris, Dahlia's twin sister, who posed as her. For eight months, she tried to convince Wright to give the necklace back, as otherwise her sister planned to kill him, but Wright refused; as he was unaware of her reasoning, he thought that she was only joking and did not mean it. During the course of said eight months, Wright greatly enjoyed spending time with his new girlfriend, who knitted him a pink sweater, made him mini omelets which he loved, and had lunch with him every day. However, things would soon change, as the true Dahlia Hawthorne was getting impatient.\n\nOne day, while suffering from a bad cold and losing his medicine, Wright met with Doug Swallow, a former lover of Hawthorne, who told him that she was dangerous; she had stolen poisonous chemicals from his lab before and now some chemicals were missing again. Horrified by Swallow's blasphemous statements about his beloved, Wright pushed him onto the ground, and Swallow fell onto his umbrella, breaking it. Wright then left, but a few minutes later, a crowd began to gather around where Swallow had fallen, and Wright returned to the scene to find Swallow dead, with Wright's previously missing cold medicine in his hand.\n\nWright was soon accused of the murder and put on trial. Wright's lawyer was Mia Fey, a rookie attorney who had not taken a case since her first a year prior. Wright did not cooperate with Fey at first, lying that he had not known the victim. One of the prosecution's witnesses was Hawthorne herself, which Wright found hard to believe. Fey eventually accused Hawthorne of the murder and claimed that the necklace had actually contained a poison used to incapacitate another individual inside the courthouse on the same day in which Hawthorne and Wright had met. Wright could take no more of this and ran out of the courtroom. By the time he was forced back inside, he had swallowed the necklace.\n\nFey then told Wright that he would have to believe in her if he wanted to avoid a conviction. Wright finally cooperated and gave his entire account of the day's events. Fey eventually showed that Hawthorne had originally intended to kill Wright by poisoning his cold medicine, but after seeing Wright's encounter with Swallow, she had changed her plan and killed Swallow instead, intending to frame Wright. Wright received a not guilty verdict, but he still could not believe that Hawthorne had betrayed him, and even suggested that the Dahlia Hawthorne he saw in that courtroom had been a fake. Fey replied that he should move on with his life.\n\nFey's dogged defense of Wright inspired him to pursue law full-time, and he came to receive his attorney's badge with identification number 26381. Meanwhile, Hawthorne was convicted and sentenced to death.\n\nEarly law career\n\nThe rookie attorney\n\nMain article: Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\n\nAfter receiving his law degree, Wright became a pupil of Mia Fey and a member of Fey & Co. Law Offices. In his first case, he successfully defended his childhood friend, Larry Butz, who was accused of murdering an ex-girlfriend, by revealing the true culprit to be the prosecution's star witness. When Mia was murdered one month later, her younger sister Maya Fey was put on trial. Wright took on her defense and finally met Edgeworth in the ensuing courtroom battle which concluded, with assistance from Maya using her spirit medium abilities to channel Mia, with Edgeworth's first ever loss. Wright then inherited Mia's firm, renaming it Wright & Co. Law Offices and taking on Maya as his assistant.\n\nWright faced Edgeworth again a month later in another case, in which television star Will Powers, who played the Steel Samurai in The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo, was accused of murdering Jack Hammer, who played the Steel Samurai's nemesis, the Evil Magistrate. As well as featuring a child on the witness stand, the case also saw Wright escape a deadly encounter with the local mafia due to the timely arrival of Detective Dick Gumshoe. The court found Powers innocent in Wright's third consecutive win, although this time Edgeworth actively helped the defense near the end of the last trial day to ensure that the true killer was found.\n\nA few months after Powers' acquittal, Wright found himself defending Edgeworth in the murder of defense attorney Robert Hammond. The prosecutor was Edgeworth's mentor and adoptive father, Manfred von Karma, who would do whatever it took to maintain his perfect 40-year win record. Wright's investigation of the murder uncovered the whole story behind the unsolved DL-6 Incident, which had resulted in the death of Edgeworth's father fifteen years prior. Wright went on to prove that von Karma was not only the culprit behind the DL-6 Incident, but had also instigated Hammond's murder. After repeatedly failing to channel Mia during the case, a demoralized Maya came to feel that she was a burden to Wright and left to train her spirit medium abilities back in her hometown of Kurain Village.\n\nWright stopped taking cases after Maya left, until Ema Skye came into his office looking for help, as her older sister Lana had been accused of murder. With Ema's forensic science tools, including fingerprint powder and luminol, Wright was able to uncover the truth behind not only the murder that began the case, but also the events that had led to it two years prior in the SL-9 Incident. Wright faced Edgeworth again in court, and they once again eventually worked together to defeat the real killer behind both incidents.\n\nThe Fey plot\n\nEdgeworth disappeared after Lana Skye's trial, leaving behind what appeared to be a suicide note. The note itself read, \"Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth Chooses Death”. Wright decided that Edgeworth had taken the coward's way out after having his reasons for prosecuting challenged. Wright hated Edgeworth for doing this and returned to refusing to take on cases.\n\nWright's semi-retirement was shattered when Dr. Turner Grey came to his office to request Maya's services in spirit channeling, as she would only agree to help the doctor if Wright was present. This took Wright to Maya's hometown of Kurain Village, where he met Maya's young cousin Pearl Fey. However, Wright soon found himself entangled in Morgan Fey's usurpation plot involving Pearl when Grey was murdered and Maya put on trial for the crime. Wright discovered that Manfred von Karma's daughter, Franziska von Karma, would be prosecuting the case. Upon meeting her in court, he found himself reliving much of his unpleasant experiences with Manfred. During Wright's investigation of the murder, Maya gave him her magatama, which Pearl charged with spiritual energy to allow Wright to see the secrets of other people in the form of Psyche-Locks. Wright gave Franziska her first not-guilty verdict, devastating her just as it had done so for Edgeworth.\n\nWith Maya returning as his assistant, Wright restarted his career by defending Maggey Byrde on murder charges. He managed to prevail and get her acquitted, despite being in an amnesiac state for the majority of the trial after being struck on the head by the true culprit. He then faced Franziska again when he found himself defending circus magician Max Galactica in a bizarre case in which a witness claimed to have seen Galactica flying after murdering the ringmaster at the Berry Big Circus.\n\nDefending the guilty\n\nMain article: Farewell, My Turnabout\n\nDuring a \"Hero of Heroes Grand Prix\" event, television star Juan Corrida was killed. Even worse, his killer, an assassin named Shelly de Killer, kidnapped Maya Fey and coerced Wright into defending the star of The Nickel Samurai, Matt Engarde, who was accused of the crime. During the ensuing case, Miles Edgeworth returned from what turned out to be an overseas trip, and Wright gave him a cold welcome. De Killer later non-fatally shot Franziska outside of the court just before the trial, forcing Edgeworth to take her place opposite Wright.\n\nAlthough Wright tried to accuse Engarde's manager Adrian Andrews of the murder in court, Edgeworth forced Andrews to admit to trying to frame Engarde, but not actually committing the murder. For the first time, it seemed that Wright's accusation was wrong, and during his investigation, he confronted Engarde, only to realize to his horror that his client had hired de Killer to commit the murder. Wright told Edgeworth about his plight: by giving into de Killer's demands, a killer would go free and the wrong person would be convicted for the murder, but by pursuing justice against Engarde, Wright would lose Maya. Edgeworth told Wright that he had left the country to learn what it really meant to be a lawyer and that now it was Wright's turn to do the same.\n\nEdgeworth had the police department attempt to chase down de Killer while he and Wright stalled for time in court in an attempt to help release the attorney from the no-win situation he found himself in. Although de Killer managed to evade the police, he left behind crucial evidence, which Detective Gumshoe hurried to deliver to the courtroom. Wright soon found himself out of time and forced to make the terrible choice of which verdict to pursue and, by proxy, whether justice or Maya's safety was more important to him. However, his awful decision was interrupted by Franziska bursting into the courtroom with Gumshoe's evidence. Among said evidence was a videotape of Corrida's murder, which Engarde had planned to use to blackmail de Killer. Upon finding out about this betrayal, an enraged de Killer freed Maya and made Engarde his next target. With the tables turned against him and desperate to escape the assassin's revenge, Engarde accepted his guilty verdict.\n\nThe mysterious Godot\n\nSome months later, a Fey clan heirloom was stolen and Ron DeLite turned himself in as the mysterious masked thief Mask☆DeMasque. Wright took DeLite's case and faced another masked man in the court, a coffee-loving prosecutor named Godot. Wright won the trial by exposing Mask☆DeMasque's arch-nemesis, Detective Luke Atmey, as the real Mask☆DeMasque, but DeLite was immediately thrown into a murder case, with the victim being his former boss at KB Security, Kane Bullard. Wright faced Godot again and found that DeLite really was Mask☆DeMasque and that Atmey had merely pretended to be the thief to avoid the murder charge for killing Bullard. Wright noticed throughout the trial that Godot seemed to have a vendetta against him, though he could not explain why.\n\nWright faced Godot again in an appeal trial after Maggey Byrde had been convicted of the murder of Glen Elg following the poor handling of the first case by someone posing as Wright. Wright investigated the vicinity of a loan company called Tender Lender and found that the witnessed murder had been staged, with the actual murder occurring prior. Wright confronted the owner of Tender Lender in court and managed to trick him into implicating himself for Elg's murder, as well as revealing that he was the impostor who had impersonated Wright in Byrde's previous trial in order to secure a guilty verdict.\n\nFey resolution\n\nMain article: Bridge to the Turnabout\n\nA month after Byrde's trial, Maya showed Wright a magazine article about a spirit medium training temple. Wright initially refused to accompany her and Pearl to the temple, but quickly changed his mind upon seeing one of the nuns in the article, as she looked identical to his university girlfriend, Dahlia Hawthorne. At the temple, Wright met Larry Butz again, as well as the Hawthorne doppelganger, who was a nun named Iris. Wright also met the head nun, Bikini, and Butz's new \"teacher\", Elise Deauxnim. However, that night Bikini witnessed Iris stabbing Deauxnim with the temple's Shichishito sword and told Wright to call the police using a phone near Dusky Bridge, only for said bridge to be ablaze upon his arrival. Fearing for Maya, who was training in the Inner Temple's Sacred Cavern on the other side of the bridge, he told Butz to call the police while he ran across, only for the bridge to break underneath him and drop the attorney into the Eagle River far below.\n\nEdgeworth found out about the accident from a panicked Butz and quickly rushed to see Wright in the hospital. Fortunately, Wright suffered only minor injuries and a cold because of his misadventure. He asked Edgeworth to fill in as Iris's defense until he recovered and gave both his attorney's badge and magatama to the prosecutor. As Edgeworth left to investigate the murder, Wright researched Mia's first case, which had seen Hawthorne nearly implicated for murder, only for the defendant to kill himself, thereby stopping the trial.\n\nThe next day, Wright left the hospital and took over where Edgeworth had left off. The bridge was repaired, but Maya was locked inside the Inner Temple. Wright soon ran into Godot, who told him that he should have protected Mia. As Wright wondered about this remark, he discovered that Hawthorne had been executed a month prior and that Iris was her twin sister. He also found out that the victim, Elise Deauxnim, was actually Maya and Mia's mother, Misty Fey, who had disappeared after the DL-6 Incident.\n\nDuring the trial the following day, Wright faced Godot in court once again. To his surprise, Iris suddenly offered herself up as a witness against Maya Fey, but Wright eventually realized that \"Iris\" was actually Hawthorne, who was being channeled. Hawthorne claimed that Maya had killed herself out of guilt for murdering her own mother, but Wright realized the truth; Maya had channeled Hawthorne to protect herself, after channeling Mia to ask for her help. As a channeled Mia appeared in Pearl's body to tell Hawthorne that she would never win against her, an enraged and defeated Hawthorne left Maya's body. Godot then demanded that Wright face him alone, without the help from Mia that had saved Wright in his previous trials. Wright took on this final challenge and implicated Godot as Misty's killer.\n\nThe truth soon came out: Godot had been a colleague of Mia's called Diego Armando, whom Hawthorne had poisoned before meeting Wright in the courthouse all those years ago. Godot had been acting with such hostility to Wright as he blamed him for Mia's death, but finally accepted that he really blamed himself for not being there to protect her after falling into a poison-induced coma. It was also revealed that Iris had been the one meeting Wright for the whole time in which he had dated Hawthorne, with the exception of the first and final encounters. Wright forgave Iris for lying to him all those years ago and told her that he had still somehow believed in her, regardless of the events of that trial. Armando then shared one last cup of coffee with Wright before the trial ended. Wright was upset he was unable to save Armando, but Mia told him that he had saved Armando in the only way possible.\n\nWright and the others later visited Iris in the detention center. Wright had his eyes on Iris for their entire conversation, thereby showing that he had some lingering feelings for her, but Pearl slapped him for what she saw as disloyalty to Maya, giving him a nosebleed.\n\nSightseeing\n\nMain articles: Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth & Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor's Gambit\n\nA month after Iris's trial, Wright, Maya, and Pearl went on a trip to Gatewater Land, where they all went on a ride on a rowboat together. Edgeworth also happened to be in Gatewater Land, although he was there on business.\n\nTwo weeks later, Wright and Maya were spotted once again near a crime scene being investigated by Edgeworth. This time they were looking at the Grand Tower skyscraper, astonished by the wonders of concrete masonry. However, they were prevented from encountering the crime scene (and Edgeworth) by a large barrier put in place around the filming lot where the investigation was taking place.\n\nDuring the investigations into an international smuggling ring and several older cases, Wright's friends and associates would occasionally refer to him, but never by name. Instead, he was mentioned in various vague, indirect ways (\"him\", \"the man in the blue suit\", \"a certain defense attorney\", and so on).\n\nDisbarment\n\nMain article: Turnabout Succession\n\nIn April 2019, Zak Gramarye, a famous magician at the time, called Wright to his detention cell. The magician challenged him to a game of poker, which Wright won. He then asked Wright to be his lawyer, as he was suspected of having killed his master, Magnifi Gramarye. He had just recently fired his previous lawyer and the trial was scheduled for the next morning, but Wright reluctantly agreed to take the case.\n\nThe next day in court, a mysterious girl gave Wright a piece of paper that seemed to have been ripped out of a journal. He took it into court with him, where he faced rookie prosecutor Klavier Gavin. Wright was able to show that Zak's stage partner Valant Gramarye had the opportunity and motive to kill Magnifi. In the end, Gavin presented Magnifi's diary, which had a page ripped out. Wright in turn presented the piece of paper that the girl had given him, as it seemed to be the missing page, but Gavin declared that the evidence was fraudulent, calling a forger called Drew Misham to the stand, who confirmed that he had made the page. The trial abruptly ended soon after, but when Zak took the stand to receive his sentence, he disappeared into thin air, and no verdict was ever given.\n\nWright was then put before a Bar Association hearing. They determined that he was responsible for the forgery and all of them, except Kristoph Gavin, voted for Wright's disbarment. Even after losing his badge, however, it was apparent that the judge who had presided over the majority of his previous trials and those involved with the law still held him in somewhat high esteem. This event became the foundation of what would become known as the \"dark age of the law\", with the trial of Simon Blackquill the following year starting this so-called \"age\" in earnest.\n\nInterim\n\nMain article: Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney\n\nTwo weeks after the Gramarye trial, Wright took in Zak's abandoned daughter Trucy, the same girl who had given him the evidence that ended his career, and raised her as his own, after failing to find any close kin. He also became friends with Kristoph Gavin, and the two of them met often over the following seven years. Wright suspected that Kristoph was somehow related to the forged evidence, but as he had no proof, he secretly continued his investigation.\n\nWright questioned the bailiff who had chased Zak after he disappeared, confirming that Trucy had helped her father with his disappearing act. He then questioned Drew Misham, finding out that his daughter Vera was the real forger and confirmed that Kristoph had requested the forgery. Wright then questioned Valant, who had fallen under suspicion due to speculation that Zak had disappeared to protect him. He found out about a certain \"Zak & Valant's Quick-Draw Shoot 'em\" trick, which had resulted in the serious injury of Thalassa Gramarye, who was Magnifi's daughter, Zak's wife, and Trucy's mother, and who had disappeared after the incident.\n\nIn the years that followed, Wright's office was reformed as the Wright Talent Agency, which was mostly a place to store the materials for Trucy's magic shows. Wright was hired as an underground poker player at the Borscht Bowl Club, but also posed as their piano player. The poker games were purely for the competition, however, as his main source of income was Trucy's magic shows. He also learned that Trucy could read subtle body language, and so used her in his poker games to beat all of his opponents.\n\nMeanwhile, Maya kept in contact with Wright, sending him letters and DVDs from various Global Studios shows.\n\nKristoph Gavin's downfall\n\nMain article: Turnabout Trump\n\nSeven years after his disappearance, Zak Gramarye reappeared to Wright, posing as \"Shadi Smith\". Wright questioned Zak about his intentions and the Gramarye family, learning that Kristoph's new student Apollo Justice was Magnifi's grandson, Thalassa's son, and Trucy's half-brother. Magnifi and his descendants had the power to read subtle body language, and Justice had a bracelet that allowed him to use this ability much more easily. Wright decided to use Justice to reach the truth about his last case. Zak also wrote a letter confessing to Magnifi's death, despite his innocence, and handed Wright a will passing on the legal rights to Magnifi's magic tricks to Trucy, with a reporter named Spark Brushel present to notarize the will.\n\nZak then challenged Wright to a poker game. The dealer, Olga Orly, had been planted by Zak to plant an extra card on Wright to make it look like he was cheating, but by sheer luck, Wright came across the card on his person and stowed it away. Furious at the failed trap, Zak hit Orly with a bottle, knocking her out. Wright moved upstairs to call the police, only to find Zak's dead body upon his return.\n\nWright called Kristoph to defend him, but when the latter mentioned Zak's baldness, Wright realized that something was wrong, since Kristoph should have been unaware of that information. Wright replaced the hat on Zak's head, put a drop of the victim's blood on an ace of spades, and left to call the police. He was shortly thereafter arrested on suspicion of \"Shadi Smith's\" murder.\n\nWright surprised Kristoph by hiring the latter's student, Apollo Justice, as his lawyer. The judge recognized Wright, but the former defense attorney insisted that the past not be discussed for the moment. With Justice at the helm of the defense team, Wright was able to convince him that the case was not as clear-cut as Kristoph was trying to make it out to be. Orly, the sole witness, had not killed Shadi Smith; someone else had. Wright had Trucy give Justice the ace of spades that he had picked up, which would turn out to be crucial evidence. Wright and Justice, with the help of Justice's power to \"perceive\" Orly's nervous twitches, eventually exposed Kristoph as the real killer. In closing, Wright told the court that the legal system was entering dark times and that the law would have to be changed.\n\nAfter the trial, Wright revealed to Justice that the card evidence had been forged. Justice was horrified at this and punched Wright, but he merely answered that there was no reason for him to care about what people thought of him anymore. Justice intended not to talk to Wright after that, but Wright had other plans for him.\n\nA successor\n\nMain articles: Turnabout Corner & Turnabout Serenade\n\nTwo months later, Wright was running some errands when a car hit him. After being admitted to the Hickfield Clinic with a sprained ankle, he called a very reluctant Apollo Justice, who was now out of a job with the closure of Gavin Law Offices, to help him out. Wright asked Justice to find the individual who had hit him, as well as figure out who had stolen Guy Eldoon's noodle cart and Trucy's \"magic panties\". During Justice's investigation, he discovered a murder, which tied all three incidents together. It also turned out that Ema Skye had been hired as a police detective after failing her forensics exam, so Wright gave Justice a fingerprinting set to give to Skye to warm her up to him. Wright then watched as Justice took on Klavier in court and won his case. Upon the trial's resolution, Justice agreed to work with Wright and the Wright Talent Agency was rebranded as the Wright Anything Agency.\n\nWright then began to put his plan into motion, using his influence over the judicial system to bring about the Jurist System. He visited Justice in his third courtroom battle, which involved a singer named Lamiroir, and told him that the old system would not allow him to get a not guilty verdict through conventional means. Justice would eventually have the defendant admit to criminal activity to implicate the real killer.\n\nThe Jurist System\n\nMain article: Turnabout Succession\n\nOn October 6, Drew Misham was killed via atroquinine poisoning and Wright, as the chair of the Jurist System Simulated Court Committee, had the courts use this incident as the test case for the Jurist System, and was even able to pick the jurists himself. Justice was appointed to the defense's bench, defending Drew's daughter Vera against Prosecutor Klavier Gavin. Wright gave Trucy Zak's will but told her not to open it until the right time. As Justice conducted his investigation, Wright began the final stages of his own long investigation.\n\nWright visited Kristoph's prison cell and attempted to get information out of him, only to see five black Psyche-Locks form around him. He then met Brushel and Valant and told the latter about Zak's will. Valant admitted that a terminally ill Magnifi had actually killed himself, which a jealous Valant had seen as an opportunity to frame Zak. Wright eventually returned to Kristoph's cell and tried to take an envelope that Drew had sent to Kristoph, which had on it the murder weapon: a poisoned stamp. Kristoph caught him in the act, but Wright had already recorded his entire investigation with a hidden video camera.\n\nWright compiled his recordings into a computer program called the MASON System, which he showed to the jury deliberating on Vera's trial. Although the recordings did not count as conclusive evidence under the old system, the jury unanimously decided that there was a sufficient reason to believe that someone else had committed the murder, and thus Vera received a not guilty verdict. With Kristoph revealed as the mastermind behind the forged evidence that had caused Wright's disbarment, the former defense attorney's name was cleared, and he began planning his return to law.\n\nLamiroir, who was one of the jurors, visited Wright to thank him, having remembered that she was the long-lost Thalassa Gramarye. Wright told her that he would keep her children safe until she could reveal her identity to them.\n\nRecruiting Athena Cykes\n\nMain article: The Monstrous Turnabout\n\nSometime after Vera's trial, Wright went to Europe to look into their legal systems.[4] It was there that he met Athena Cykes, who was studying to become a lawyer. Learning she could sense subtle emotions from the voices of others, he assured her that this ability would be a great help to people. Cykes finished her studies and became a lawyer, and Wright invited her to join the Wright Anything Agency.\n\nWhile meeting Cykes at the airport, Wright called Justice to accompany Trucy to Nine-Tails Vale. It was there that Justice accepted the job of defending Mayor Damian Tenma for the murder of Alderman Rex Kyubi, and when Cykes eagerly rushed over to help with the investigation, Wright phoned Justice to head over to the village to find her. Wright met with his two understudies before the trial the following day, telling them about his plan to retake the bar exam and warning them about the convict prosecutor Simon Blackquill, whose presence he himself was alerted to by now-Chief Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth.\n\nAfter the first trial day, Justice and Cykes continued their investigation, but soon began to struggle. When they returned to the agency, Wright told them what Mia had taught him: the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles, return to the basics whenever stuck, and always believe in their client. His apprentices took his advice and successfully defended Tenma and exposed his aide, Florent L'Belle, as the real killer. After congratulating Justice and watching Tenma meet his fans as the Amazing Nine-Tails wrestler, Wright took his subordinates to Eldoon's Noodles to celebrate their victory. Wright later retook the bar exam and prepared to enter the legal world once more.\n\nLater law career\n\nEnd of the dark age of the law\n\nWright's career took off with another unusual case when he was asked to defend Orla Shipley, an aquarium orca who was accused of killing the aquarium's owner. Although Wright managed to prove the orca's innocence, he then had to defend her trainer, Sasha Buckler, who was accused of the same crime. Despite having to face Prosecutor Blackquill in court for the first time, Wright also ran into an old ally in the form of Pearl Fey during the investigation. By the end of the trial, Wright had managed to indict aquarist Marlon Rimes for the murder of Jack Shipley. However, when new evidence came up, Wright realized that the captain's death was an accident, and so Rimes was put into rehabilitation, as he had attempted to kill Orla. Sometime after the trial, Wright, Trucy, Pearl, Cykes, and Justice returned to the aquarium to watch a new version of their famous stage show, with Rimes as one of the actors.\n\nWright was later invited by Themis Legal Academy to give a potential seminar at the upcoming school festival, which he agreed to, bringing Justice and Cykes along with him. A mock trial would be held to determine who gave and who received a seminar; Wright would speak to the defense attorney students if the defense attorney won, while Klavier Gavin would speak to the prosecutor students if the prosecutor of the mock trial won. Wright was also due to have a meeting with Professor Constance Courte, but she did not show up. He decided to allow Justice to watch the mock trial in his place, while he and Cykes waited in the hallway.\n\nHowever, while the mock trial was in full swing, the pair heard a crash outside. Upon investigating the sound, the two of them discovered Courte's body on the outdoor stage intended to be used for the festival. Although Cykes's immediate reaction was to alert someone, Wright stopped her and stated that she should take the opportunity to examine the body in order to gather evidence. After the authorities arrived at the crime scene, Justice realized that Courte's murder had many similarities to the fictional murder used in the mock trial. Later, as Wright was speaking to Professor Aristotle Means about the murder, it was revealed that Cykes intended to defend the prime suspect, Juniper Woods, as she was a childhood friend of hers. After Means left, Wright told Cykes about the so-called \"dark age of the law\" and that it had infected Themis Legal Academy.\n\nAfter furiously fighting in the courtroom for her client, Cykes eventually revealed that Means was the true culprit, saving Woods. The entire Wright Anything Agency then attended the festival, which had been extended in honor of Courte. Since defense attorney student Hugh O'Conner had won the mock trial, Wright subsequently gave his seminar to the defense students.\n\nTwo months later Woods was accused of planting a bomb that destroyed one of the courtrooms in the District Court. Wright was forced to take over her defense from his subordinates after both were incapacitated; Justice was injured after protecting Woods during the bomb blast and Cykes suffered a mental breakdown during the trial owing to a traumatic previous experience in court when she was younger. Facing him was Prosecutor Gaspen Payne, younger brother of the \"Rookie Killer\" Wright had defeated in trials past. After exonerating Woods, Wright took up the defense of astronaut Solomon Starbuck, the defendant in the trial disrupted by the courtroom bombing, who had originally been Justice's client until the young lawyer was injured in the bombing, and stood accused of murdering fellow astronaut and close friend of Justice, Clay Terran.\n\nAlthough Wright soon cleared Starbuck's name, he was shocked to find out that Cykes was now being indicted for the same murder as Starbuck. Wright found himself not only defending her, but also having to clear the names of both her and Blackquill in the UR-1 Incident, in which Athena Cykes's mother Metis Cykes had been murdered. The resulting trial took place in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4, where Wright faced off against his old friend and rival Edgeworth once again, having risen to the position of Chief Prosecutor during Wright's disbarment. During the trial, Wright was forced to cross-examine Justice, who had earlier taken a leave of absence from the Agency to investigate Terran's death on his own.\n\nWright eventually figured out that a third party had been responsible for fabricating the evidence that had been used to indict Athena. Wright accused Bobby Fulbright, a detective assigned to Blackquill, of the murder of both Metis Cykes and Clay Terran. After clearing Blackquill of suspicion, Wright proceeded to question Fulbright, with the help of Justice and his bracelet, to discern the truth behind the murder weapon. Blackquill, who had claimed the prosecutor's bench from Edgeworth after being declared innocent of Metis's murder, sliced at Fulbright and struck his face; the impact left a tear, which revealed it as a mask. The person on the witness stand was actually an international spy known only as the \"phantom\", who had been posing as Fulbright for an unknown length of time. Wright indicted the phantom on charges of killing Athena's mother and Terran, as well as being responsible for the bombing of the Cosmos Space Center. The crucial piece of evidence turned out to be a fragment of moon rock, which had blood residue from a wound the phantom suffered while escaping the scene of Metis's murder. Wright used Athena's earring, which had been made from the same moon rock, to prove that the two samples were from the same stone. Thus, the fragment which contained the phantom's blood was from Metis's lab, and he was responsible for the murders of both Metis and Terran.\n\nAfter the phantom's incarceration and Athena's acquittal, Wright returned to running his agency. Sometime later, he and his apprentices watched from the space center as Starbuck was launched into space in the HAT-3 rocket.\n\nThe Court of Resignation\n\nFour months later, Wright traveled to the Kingdom of Khura'in to visit Maya, who was visiting the country as part of her spirit medium training. However, trouble soon reared its head when his tour guide, Ahlbi Ur'gaid, was arrested for murdering a guard and stealing a precious relic called the Founder's Orb.\n\nWright watched the ensuing trial and it was soon revealed that there were no defense attorneys in the country's court system owing to its Defense Culpability Act. Instead, verdicts were decided via the spirit medium powers of Khura'in's mystic princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in, which allowed for the viewing of the victim's final moments. Faced with seemingly overwhelming evidence, Ur'gaid was declared guilty. However, Wright then appeared at the empty defense's bench and declared that a verdict without a defense was unacceptable, and so he would take on Ur'gaid's case. Despite the overwhelming odds and intense hostility from the courtroom gallery (with even Ur'gaid initially protesting his interference), Wright proved that Ur'gaid was innocent and that the head monk, Pees'lubn Andistan'dhin, had committed the murder and stolen the Founder's Orb. After the trial, Wright met Justice Minister Inga Karkhuul Khura'in, who told him to keep out of the courtroom.\n\nAfter Ur'gaid's case, Wright heard that Trucy had been accused of murder back home in America and called Justice in a panic. From the phone call, he learned that the Wright Anything Agency office was in danger of financial ruin thanks to the schemes of Take-2 TV producer, Roger Retinz. When Justice stated that he and Cykes were on the case, Wright told his subordinate that he had grown a lot and that he was confident enough to put his trust in him to save both his daughter and the agency. After Justice won the case, Wright congratulated him and acknowledged him as a full-fledged lawyer in his own right.\n\nA few weeks after Trucy's trial, Wright learned that Maya had once again been accused of murder, with head priest Tahrust Inmee as the victim. He immediately took on the case to save her, going up against international prosecutor Nahyuta Sahdmadhi in the process. Wright conducted his investigation under the watchful eye of Rayfa, with Detective Ema Skye providing assistance where she could.\n\nHowever, despite his best efforts, the odds were too heavily weighed against then, and Wright lost the trial, with the pair being declared guilty under the Defense Culpability Act. Luckily, they were given another chance to prove their innocence when Inmee's acolyte Puhray Zeh'lot was also found dead; as Maya was also accused of this murder, the trial was extended. Wright once again found himself under the watchful eye of Rayfa for most of his investigation, which eventually led to the discovery of a secret rebel hideout within the Inner Sanctum. The following day, Wright had Maya channel Inmee's spirit in order to get his testimony about the deaths of Zeh'lot and himself. Wright was subsequently able to figure out that Zeh'lot was actually Rheel Neh'mu, a government spy who hunted rebels while disguised as Lady Kee'ra. More importantly, Wright was able to deduce that the priest had committed suicide to protect his wife, Beh'leeb Inmee, from the Defense Culpability Act and prevent the police from discovering the base. After his and Maya's acquittal, Wright caught a glimpse of the rebel leader, Dhurke Sahdmadhi, who was helping Beh'leeb escape with the help of Datz Are'bal.\n\nWitness to the revolution\n\nMain article: Turnabout Revolution\n\nA few days later, Maya was kidnapped by Inga, thereby forcing Wright to obey the commands of politician Paul Atishon or else risk Maya's safety once again. This \"agreement\" coerced him into disagreeing on the identity of an artifact known as the Founder's Orb that Justice had found during a trip to Kurain Village, prompting the two to have a civil trial against one another. Although they were on opposite sides of the courtroom, Wright was still hesitant to face off against Justice. However, Justice figured out that Maya was needed to channel the Khura'inese religious figure known as the Holy Mother, whose face was revealed in the orb. This meant that Atishon was holding the wrong person captive, as harming her would render the orb useless to him. Freed from the shackles of blackmail, Wright resigned as Atishon's lawyer, and the politician was arrested for the murder of Archie Buff, who had hidden the artifact from Atishon after discovering it had been stolen. After the trial, Wright received a call from Inga, who demanded the orb in exchange for Maya.\n\nWright, Justice, Cykes, Dhurke, and Miles Edgeworth subsequently traveled to Khura'in to conduct the exchange. However, while they found Maya weakened but safe, Inga was dead, and Dhurke was immediately arrested for his murder. Wright investigated with Edgeworth at his side, meeting with Queen Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in and learning of Inga's plans for a coup d’état.\n\nAfter reuniting with Justice, Wright stood alongside his apprentice as his co-counsel during Dhurke's trial. Together, they faced off against both Ga'ran and Nahyuta. Several revelations were made during the trial, including the fact that Dhurke was killed by Inga while he was rescuing Maya many days earlier. Wright learned that Maya had been safe all along as she was channeling Dhurke's spirit so he could meet with Justice back in the States. Wright then watched as his apprentice solved the case and accused Ga'ran of having no right to the throne, attempting to assassinate her older sister, and murdering Inga.\n\nAfter the trial, Justice was asked to stay in Khura'in in order to help rebuild their court system and reopen Dhurke's old law office, to which he agreed. Wright traveled back home with Maya, Cykes, Trucy (who had stowed away in Edgeworth's luggage), and Edgeworth, knowing that Justice would be fine in Khura'in. He later met up with Lamiroir and showed her a photograph of her late first husband, Jove Justice. He suggested telling Apollo and Trucy of their shared parentage and Lamiroir agreed that it was about time they both knew the truth.\n\nMurder at a wedding\n\nMain article: Turnabout Time Traveler\n\nSeveral months later, Wright took on the defense of Ellen Wyatt, who was accused of murdering a servant after her own wedding reception; Wyatt was to be married to Sorin Sprocket, heir to Sprocket Aviation. After the Sprocket family placed a great deal of pressure on the prosecutor's office to drop the case, Edgeworth decided instead to prosecute it personally. Wright was joined in his investigation by Maya Fey and Larry Butz, the latter of whom had been convinced that Wyatt was going to marry him, leading to a reunion of sorts. Wyatt and Butz were both convinced that time travel had occurred during the wedding, as they had seen two separate wedding receptions.\n\nDuring the trial, Wright determined that the \"time travel\" had actually been an elaborate ruse set up by the Sprocket family to cover up the murder, with the reception being re-enacted later. After much deliberation, Wright concluded that the true killer had committed the crime during the wedding ceremony as part of an attempted revenge plot on Sorin. After Wyatt was declared not guilty, Wright attended her wedding alongside Edgeworth, Butz, Fey, Cykes, and Ema Skye.\n\nPersonality\n\nPhoenix Wright is generally quite easy-going in his outlook. His relaxed and laid-back attitude usually leads to his friends leading him around or taking advantage of his good nature, usually by making him foot the bill of large celebratory meals. Wright can also be somewhat sarcastic, something he typically keeps to himself in the form of inner monologue. He can be especially sardonic and snarky towards people on occasion. This tends to manifest when dealing with the eccentric characters (including his friends), objects, and situations he comes across. Despite his usually relaxed attitude, he's rather a harsh critic when it comes to art, possibly due to his time as an art student, to the point of openly mocking his friends' art pieces on several occasions.\n\nWright has repeatedly shown himself to be a loyal friend and lawyer who will refuse to back down once his mind is made up. Known for this trait even in childhood, it has been a valuable asset for him, especially as it has translated into his dedication to defending and believing in the innocence of his clients. Wright's loyalty is such that he has often ended up risking his career, and even his life, for his friends and clients on several occasions. For instance, in the trial that got him disbarred, he showed calm concern for the fate of his client, even in the midst of allegations of fraud. Drew Misham, in particular, was intrigued by this, claiming that despite Wright being the center of the problem, he was the only one who had not made a commotion.\n\nOn the other hand, Wright's loyalty has clouded his better judgment on a few occasions. In university, he went through great lengths to protect his girlfriend, Dahlia Hawthorne, during his own trial, based on their relationship. When his lawyer, Mia Fey, accused Hawthorne of poisoning Diego Armando and giving her bottle of poison to Wright disguised as a necklace, Wright refused to believe her and ate the necklace, though, fortunately for him, it had been emptied. Even after the trial, he would conclude that Hawthorne was \"not the woman [he] was dating\", which would later turn out to be literally true. Years later, he attempted to cross a burning bridge in an attempt to save Maya, whom he believed to be trapped on the other side with a killer. Despite Larry Butz begging him not to, Wright went as far as to push him out of the way to get to the bridge, which immediately broke, sending him plummeting down into the river below.\n\nGrowth & maturation\n\nIn his university years, Wright was somewhat of a cry-baby and a little childish, bursting into tears when Mia got angry with him for lying during his testimony. His naivety manifested itself mostly in his relationship with Dahlia Hawthorne. His attitude at this time was somewhat comparable to that of his childhood friend Larry Butz, though the latter never really grew out of this behavior. Nonetheless, Wright was often considered the most mature out of all of his friends at the time.\n\nIn his earlier years as a lawyer, even after he had built up a respectable reputation for himself, Wright often depended on his former boss and mentor, Mia Fey, for advice. Even in death, she was generally available to help, thanks to the spirit channeling abilities of Maya and Pearl. At one point, Wright's morals were challenged when he was forced to choose between defending a guilty client to save Maya Fey or letting her die to see justice through. Eventually, during the trial of Iris, Godot challenged him to argue his case without Mia's help, and Wright prevailed. Wright also ended up rather arrogant, underestimating Klavier Gavin due to the apparent gap in experience, and he paid for this by falling right into Gavin's trap, presenting evidence of questionable and unreliable origin, which — unknowing to him — was forged, resulting in his disbarment.\n\nIn his early days of disbarment, he suffered from regret and despair, although that did not stop him from caring for Trucy, who had also lost her father. His morals were more flexible, almost to the point of him adopting an \"end justifies the means\" mentality at times, as was demonstrated by his use of forged evidence in the Shadi Smith murder trial. His rationale for this behavior was that he no longer had the responsibilities of a lawyer; moreover, people at the time thought he was a sham anyway, and so he had perhaps given up on caring what they thought of him. However, he still deeply cared about those close to him, and he maintained contact with old friends such as Ema Skye, Maya Fey, and Miles Edgeworth. He seemingly did not hold any grudge regarding the loss of his badge, as one might have expected, instead diligently continuing his investigation of the case that had gotten him disbarred.\n\nSince then, Wright has become calmer, more self-confident, more mature, and more resistant to intimidation by his opponents, such as Gaspen Payne and Simon Blackquill (or, at least, more resistant than his understudies and the judge). Wright has also become more eccentric and laid-back over the years, as well developing the habit of telling (mostly bad) jokes and occasionally giving cryptic advice, which at times irritates Apollo Justice. He also laughs more, and not as nervously as he did before. Often, when he is not in the heat of a trial, his actions and speech give off the vibe of the \"omniscient old man\" archetype in literature, at least externally. He no longer underestimates his younger opponents as he did against Klavier. However, his more excitable side from his earlier years as a lawyer sometimes rises back to the surface, especially in the midst of a pressure-filled trial. His internal monologue also reveals that he has retained his private sardonic nature.\n\nLikes & dislikes\n\nWright has claimed that he watches Kids' Masterpiece Theatre every Sunday.\n\nAlthough he has repeatedly professed indifference towards the Samurai franchise, Wright's ringtone is the Steel Samurai theme tune, and he seems to be somewhat knowledgeable of the franchise in general. This could be explained by Wright having worked on two cases involving the franchise and having two friends who are huge fans of it.\n\nWright is an unabashed meat eater and has claimed that the only sea creatures he likes are the ones he can eat. With that being said, Wright is not as burger crazy as his assistant Maya, instead claiming to be more of \"a grilled chicken sandwich man”.\n\nOver the years, Wright has developed a taste for grape juice, and was known to drink it near-constantly during his disbarment period.\n\nBlue is his favorite color, with his trademark suit being the most obvious manifestation of this.[5]\n\nWright does not own a car or have a driver's license. He appears to use taxis and cycling as his main mode of transportation; he shares this trait with his pupil, Apollo Justice, while his ancestor, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, was actually afraid of using bicycles after a bad experience and preferred the use of public transportation.\n\nPhoenix has expressed a distaste for electric bikes in a few different occasions, as he find them a lazier alternative to regular bikes.\n\nWright has a blue bar phone that he has apparently kept throughout his law career.\n\nWright claims to be poor at math, and when he encounters any form of advanced technology, he can only really regurgitate the information fed to him by others.\n\nWright is afraid of heights. He supposedly once took Trucy to an amusement park once and rode a roller coaster, only to begin to panic and object to the ride while on it. However, this fear is not particularly strong, and he has been shown to handle it better than others, being able to even override it in situations like Maya being trapped on the other side of Dusky Bridge, unlike Apollo or Ryunosuke, whose fear of heights seems to be on the stronger side.\n\nWright stated that he is \"not really into smoking\" after examining a gold lighter on the table in Marvin Grossberg's office.\n\nWright stated that apples are one of his favorite fruits.\n\nRelationship with Trucy\n\nPhoenix and Trucy have a very close father-daughter relationship. He is extremely caring and protective of her, and, in turn, Trucy is very caring of her father. For the first two weeks after Phoenix was disbarred, he felt that his life was ruined, and he started to act even more sardonically than usual when the loss of his badge was brought up. Phoenix has stated that Trucy helped him make it through his disbarment period, referring to her as his light. He always carries a locket with him with Trucy's picture in it, wearing it around his neck while disbarred and in his breast pocket after his return to the courtroom.\n\nPhoenix tends not to worry too much about Trucy, understanding that she is more than capable of handling herself and that she has Justice and Cykes to depend on if she needs help. However, he did note he should more carefully watch what sort of magic she does after she proved herself to be proficient with throwing knives and often denies her requests to help with investigations due to her needing to focus on her schoolwork. However, his more protective side was understandably more visible after she was held hostage by Aura Blackquill, leaving him scared about what was going to happen to his daughter.\n\nAs soon as he learned that Trucy had been arrested for murder, Phoenix frantically tried to get hold of Justice and Cykes, as he was out of the country at the time and thus unable to help her himself. However, he did calm down once they informed him they were taking her case and would save her. After the case, he called them back and after hearing that Trucy got a not guilty verdict, was immensely relieved to know she was safe.\n\nPhoenix has voiced his concern about Trucy's choice of magic props, namely her \"magic panties\", especially since her magic shows involve her displaying said panties to strangers. However, he claims that he does not want to say anything regarding the issue to her, partly because he has let her get away with it for so long that he does not wish to spoil her fun, but also because he does not want to waste the \"expensive panties\" he brought for her.\n\nReputation & legacy\n\nWright was well known for his bluffing tactics and his unwavering determination in the courtroom, both of which he inherited from Mia Fey. Wright would stubbornly cling onto anything that could help his case, such as an inconsistency between the evidence and the claims of the prosecution and/or the witness or a seemingly insignificant clue. Wright would often not know where his logic was going and would make a story up and back it up with evidence or logic as requested as he went along. Nonetheless, depending on how much attention he paid to the court record, his version of the murder would usually turn out to be true eventually. Wright has also used tactics that would be considered bizarre by many (such as cross-examining animals), but which have regardless eventually led him to the truth in his cases. Wright has also occasionally tricked witnesses into implicating themselves for the crime in question. Wright was also known for the clever lines he delivered while making his stand, though one was stolen off of Mia Fey.[6]\n\nHowever, such tactics have given Wright somewhat of a poor reputation among some of his enemies, such as Kristoph Gavin and Furio Tigre. Gavin has gone so far as to call Wright \"a second-rate attorney”. Nonetheless, he was generally renowned for winning seemingly unwinnable cases. Wright's disbarment tarnished this reputation, with the media being quick to call him a \"crooked attorney\", but regardless, he and even his law firm have been referred to as \"legendary\" in certain circles, even in the criminal underworld. The judicial system was apparently forgiving enough to allow Wright to head the Jurist System Simulated Court Committee, even giving him the power to choose the case, jurors, defense attorney, courtroom, and even the judge used for the trial.\n\nWright was at one point known as the \"undefeated defense attorney\" by some people, including Ema Skye, up until he eventually suffered his first defeat. Despite this, his record was still considered impressive since most defense attorneys would struggle to get a single win in their entire careers.\n\nIn Khura'in, Wright became known as the Fighting Phoenix due to being the first defense attorney to appear in court in many years and win two murder trials despite the supposed infallibility of the Insights.\n\nWright Way Lunch\n\nAngel Starr named one of her lunches in honor of Wright called the \"Wright Way Lunch\". Apparently, the top tastes as bitter as defeat but the bottom is as sweet as victory; Starr has suggested to \"be careful not to eat it backward\". According to Starr, it is popular with kids around exam time due to its turnabout theme.\n\nPhysical trauma\n\nWright has endured a large amount of physical trauma. He is often viewed by others as incredibly lucky for surviving some of his experiences, and hardy for taking the physical abuse he experiences in court so well.\n\nHe has chewed and swallowed a necklace made of metal and glass that also potentially contained small traces of a fatal poison, with no ill repercussions afterwards. He has been physically assaulted by a murderer, almost taken out by mobsters, shocked by a 600,000 volt stun gun, hit over the head with a fire extinguisher (with temporary amnesia as the only consequence), had a tiger (playfully) jump on him, roughed up by a thieving monkey (potentially twice), punched and slapped surprisingly hard (causing in at least one occasion unconsciousness, and in another a nosebleed) by an 8-year old kid in multiple occasions, was (playfully) hit on the head with a ceremonial Shichishito (hard enough to bend it a little further than it was before), and had a near-deadly encounter with a loan shark. He also once fell from a 40-foot cliff into a fast-flowing river - one notorious for washing its victims away, never to be seen again - in the middle of winter while being also out of breath following a 15-minute run, only to escape with a fever that just left him bedridden for two nights. Shortly after, Wright was somewhat forced to go through Hazakura Temple's Special Course all the way to the end, a grueling nightly training session consisting of sitting on a block of ice while chanting a spell 30,000 times, all while being showered in freezing cold water. In court, Wright has had a toupee thrown at his face, been frequently whipped, pecked by birds, had seeds thrown at him, and had numerous cups of boiling hot/cold coffee thrown at his face.\n\nEven after being disbarred, he was punched by Apollo Justice in the face, showing little to no reaction to it, and later hit by a speeding vehicle and thrown thirty feet head-first into a telephone pole but, somehow, walked away from the latter with just a sprained ankle. Unfortunately, the situation did not much improve after recovering his attorney's badge: he had tiny pieces of his hair sliced off, had his arm squeezed by thrown prayer beads, threw his back so badly he passed out from the pain for an entire day, was knocked unconscious and was then threatened with a machete, faced the possibility of execution twice (including on the spot execution via guns trained on him), was bonked on the head repeatedly with a royal staff, and later also punched, by an enraged Rayfa, and had paper airplanes thrown at him. Wright also has begun to suffer from chronic back pain problems, complaining about his discomfort on multiple occasions.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nWright only knows the names of three different floral plants: sunflowers, tulips, and, later on, roses. This is a personality trait he picked up from his ancestor.\n\nBy contrast, his old friend and rival Edgeworth has an extensive knowledge about flowers.\n\nWright has terrible handwriting, which was remarked upon when he tried to write a name while connecting dots on a jar and when reproducing the text of a letter.\n\nName\n\nJapanese - Ryūichi Naruhodō (成歩堂 龍一):\n\n\"Ryūichi\" (龍一) originated from Ryuichi Sakamoto (坂本龍一), a Japanese composer, singer, writer, and actor, whom Shu Takumi deeply respected.[7] It initially had no other particular significance until Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations introduced a character named Furio Tigre (芝九蔵 虎之助, Shibakuzō Toranosuke) — \"Ryūichi\" alludes to the dragon, while \"Toranosuke\" alludes to the tiger. The two animals are said to be natural enemies in Eastern mythology. This is referenced in-game by Tigre's jacket design, which bears the image of a tiger biting down on the neck of a dragon.\n\n\"Naruhodō\" (成歩堂) comes from the Japanese expression \"naruhodo\" (なるほど), which roughly translates as \"I see\", \"I understand\", or \"indeed\". It is usually used to agree with other people's ideas. Shu Takumi likes \"naruhodo\" because it is a commonly used word whose origins and etymology are unknown. When choosing it as the basis for the surname, Takumi also wanted to emphasize the most important aspect of mystery fiction, the realization that would make one say, \"I see.\"[8]\n\nOther languages - Phoenix Wright:\n\n\"Wright\" is based on his Japanese surname. Alexander O. Smith felt that this was the only surname that would fit, due to how often it was used in jokes such as \"Isn't that right, Wright?\". He also viewed the surname as self-deprecating humor, so that Wright could say something bold like, \"Yeah, right, I got it!\" even though he does not actually get it.[9] During Turnabout Memories, Wright introduces himself to Mia as being \"Wright... Like the flying brothers\", referring to the Wright brothers.\n\nRoger was Smith's first choice for Wright's given name, due to the alliteration as well as joke potential as seen, for example, in the film Airplane! However, the Japanese team rejected it due to sounding too much like Roger Rabbit. Other proposals included Pierce, Xavier, Marcus, Zane,[9] and Daniel. Such names were deemed too boring, so the name \"Phoenix\" was used to sound more unique.[10] The localized episode title Rise from the Ashes makes an additional reference to the mythological bird known for rising from the ashes of its own death.\n\nUnofficial\n\nBrazilian Portuguese - Fênix Veríssimo:[11]\n\n\"Fênix\" comes from his English localization given name (Phoenix).\n\n\"Veríssimo\" is the superlative form of \"vero\" (\"true\"), and maintains the semantic pattern established in the original surnames. It is also the surname of the Brazilian author Luis Fernando Verissimo, who is referenced in the Brazilan version of Turnabout Memories instead of the Wright brothers. It is also a reference to Érico Veríssimo.[12][citation needed]\n\nVietnamese - Trần Vân Phượng:[13]\n\n\"Phượng\" means \"Phoenix\", alluding to his name in the English version.\n\n\"Vân\" is derived from the interjection \"vâng\", meaning \"yes\" or \"correct\", alluding to his Japanese and English surnames.\n\nThe Vietnamese localization team of Ace Attorney have confirmed these allusions.\n\nRussian - Ryuichi Horashyo (fan-translation by Dant):[14]\n\n\"Horashyo\" is an adaptation of the Russian word \"horosho\" (good) to Japanese phonetics, which can mean \"I see\".\n\nThai - Thawidech \"Thiew\" Thiangthae (ทวิเดช เที่ยงแท้): [15]\n\nHis first name, Thawidech (ทวิเดช) came from two words: Thawi (ทวิ) means “two/double”, and Dech (เดช) means “flame”; which could be interpreted as “two flames” as in the death and the rebirth of a phoenix.\n\nHis last name, Thiangthae (เที่ยงแท้) means “certain/absolute”. It is the closest word that reflects Wright/Right jokes as any other words are not suitable for a name.\n\nHis nickname, Thiew (ทิว), came from simply switching สระอิ (i) vowel from the second alphabet to the first. It has no hidden meaning or reference.\n\nDevelopment\n\nWright is known for his unique spiky hairstyle, which he claims is natural. This has prompted various nicknames over the years, many of them disparaging (e.g., \"Barbed Head\" by Rayfa Padma Khura'in). His eye color is currently depicted as dark blue, but this has varied between different artwork and in-game assets.\n\nBackground speculation\n\nThe Gyakuten Saiban Fanbook (2005) contains some extra details about Wright speculated on by Shu Takumi in response to a fan-created character profile. He imagined that Wright was raised in an ordinary family in something like a public housing apartment, and that he rents an apartment and uses public bathhouses. He also imagined him as an assistant to a manga artist. Wright was originally studying art to become a Shakespearean actor and even possibly move to England, explaining his exaggerated animations. However, this aspiration was shelved on that fateful day when he read about Edgeworth in a newspaper. He also believes that a poor image fits Wright, especially in contrast to the rich Edgeworth.[16]\n\nCharacter artist Kumiko Suekane prefers to think that Wright was studying to become a manga artist.\n\nOriginal designs\n\nDuring the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, Wright typically wears a blue suit, a red or China pink tie, and black shoes (wore dark brown shoes in T&T artwork only), with his attorney's badge pinned to his suit jacket lapel. During Turnabout Memories, he wears jeans, a red scarf, and blue striped shoes with his initials on them, along with a pink sweater that Iris knitted for him, which also includes his initials.\n\nWright was designed to be the player's avatar, and so was made without a clear-cut personality or a detailed history outside the games so that it would be easy for the player to relate with him. Shu Takumi has intentionally refused to establish details irrelevant to the games, such as birth dates, blood types, or favorite foods. This is why Phoenix Wright's bedroom only makes a brief appearance at the beginning of Turnabout Samurai, and even then, only in pitch darkness. In the original trilogy of games, his often-sarcastic inner monologues are meant to be like Takumi's own thoughts on the situations being presented in the games.[17]\n\nHe was given his distinctive \"spiky hairstyle\" in order to provide him with a unique look.[18] It also serves to give Wright a distinctive silhouette, which Shu Takumi would repeat with Sissel, the main character of Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective.[19]\n\nDuring production, the name \"Sōka Naruhodō\" (which translates to \"Oh, yes, I see now\") was suggested, but quickly dismissed. It was decided to settle for just \"Naruhodō\".\n\nIn Turnabout Sisters, Wright was originally supposed to first encounter April May in court (rather than in her hotel room). Upon seeing her for the first time, he was supposed to become lovestruck and get \"heart-eyes\". However, due to changes to the plot, her appearance was brought forward, and so the relevant sprite was cut from the final game.\n\nIn official art for the original Game Boy Advance release, Wright has brown eyes, with his eyes appearing black in-game. However, in the official art created for the DS release onwards, he has blue eyes. His eyes are black in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy HD and the current Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy on 3DS, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch & Steam.\n\nHis hair seems to have grown more spikes as he has matured. During Turnabout Memories, his first chronological appearance, he has three spikes of hair on each side; during the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, he has four; and from Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies onward, he has five.\n\nThe difference between the Turnabout Memories and present-day Trilogy designs was to add a distinction between the stages of Wright's life.[18] Additionally, his college student design has his initials (\"P\" and \"W\") as part of the design on his shoes in his full-body official art.\n\nIn the Japanese versions of the games, almost all characters address Wright by his surname or a corruption of it. In Japanese parlance, one's first name is only used by family members, lovers, and extremely close friends. In Wright's case, however, even close friends like Larry Butz and Maya Fey still use his surname. The only characters in the entire series to call him by his first name are Dahlia Hawthorne / Iris (while they were dating), Desirée DeLite, Sasha Buckler, and Ponco.\n\nIn the anime adaptation, he is said to have watched the entire run of The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo for information that could help him with the defense of Will Powers.\n\nApollo Justice: Ace Attorney\n\nDuring Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Wright wears a dark hooded jacket, black pants, sandals, and a blue hat with a yellow shocked face and the word \"Papa\" in pink. He also keeps a locket with Trucy's picture in it around his neck. After he regains his badge, he dons a suit similar to his old one, albeit with the addition of a light blue waistcoat and the locket in his breast pocket.\n\nThis design came about because Takumi imagined him as a veteran attorney and found the idea boring. He asked Kazuya Nuri to change him to the point of being unrecognizable, and subsequent requests only served to make him look even worse. However, promotional materials for the game revealed who he was immediately.[20]\n\nTakumi envisioned Wright as drinking and gambling for real, but others pushed back on this due to the game being potentially played by children. Takumi himself also found it more difficult than he had expected to handle such themes in the story. It was relatively simple to change the concept so that Wright simply enjoys grape juice, but it took a long time to adjust the gambling concept before it was finalized as playing poker purely competitively with only pride on the line.[21]\n\nOf the five defendants in the game, Wright is the only one defended by Justice to not face the possibility of death during the course of his trial.\n\nVeteran attorney\n\nThe initial concept for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies was Wright's return to law. However, it was felt that his story arc had been fully explored in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations, and so his role was instead changed to that of the \"newbie chief\" of the Wright Anything Agency. His new character design had to be similar to his appearance in Trials and Tribulations, while at the same time showing how the flow of time had changed him. Many potential designs were put forward, including versions that had glasses, wore his pendant around his neck, wore a sweater hand knitted by Trucy, or had a small goatee. It was decided that it was important that he should be well-dressed in a suit, but even the design of said suit had many variations. In the end, the game's art director Takuro Fuse settled on making him a little older looking, altering his suit design slightly, and allowing a single lock of his hair to hang in front. The lock of hair was meant to add a little wildness to his design, while the addition of a waistcoat and pendant are meant to give an additional air of maturity. The balance between his face and expressions was also tweaked in the illustrations and 3D models for the game. The game's scenario director, Takeshi Yamazaki, felt that Wright is the embodiment of the \"revival\" theme of Dual Destinies.[22]\n\nThe main clothing color themes of Phoenix Wright, Apollo Justice, and Athena Cykes are the three primary colors (blue, red, and yellow, respectively).\n\nCapcom vs. series\n\nTatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars\n\nPhoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma were originally supposed to be playable characters in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars.[23] However, Wright had only one notable move - his \"Objection!\" In-game, the attack would create the \"Objection!\" speech bubble, which would attack opponents. The main reason Wright was ultimately cut was that localization would enlarge the \"Objection!\" attack, going from four to ten characters, making the move impossible to avoid and thereby creating serious balancing issues.\n\nMarvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds\n\nProducer Ryota Niitsuma later expressed a desire to implement Wright into future Capcom fighting games.[24] He also stated that, due to his popularity, especially in Europe, he was near the top of the list of planned Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds downloadable characters if the game sold well enough.[25] Although Wright as a downloadable character never came to fruition, both Wright and Miles Edgeworth do make a cameo appearance in the game, namely during She-Hulk's ending. In said ending, Jennifer Walters (She-Hulk's alter-ego) becomes the host of a courtroom reality series entitled \"Jen's Justice\", which co-stars Wright and Edgeworth. When she accidentally smashes the judge's bench with her gavel, both lawyers can be seen cowering in fear. The ending can be seen here.\n\nUltimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\n\nPhoenix Wright was confirmed playable in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 when a character profile image of him was accidentally uploaded onto the game's website.[26] On October 13, 2011, Wright was officially revealed, and three video trailers featuring in-game footage of the defense attorney were released.[27]\n\nWright does not fight conventionally; instead, he fights by searching and throwing evidence, rummaging and throwing papers, and sneezing at his opponents (referencing his cold while he was on trial as a student) as a launcher or an air combo/aerial rave finisher. He has three styles of \"combat\" to switch from: \"Investigation Mode\" is focused on finding clues to use against his foes in court, represented by three document folders. Wright can discover either legitimate evidence or junk (which can be thrown away) with each piece of evidence having its own effects, such as varieties of projectiles or even pieces of meat that can be used to restore health. Wright can also call on Maya Fey as an assist to protect him while he searches for evidence. Missile can also be used as a throw as well as an assist whenever Wright is not active. \"Trial Mode\" is a more combat-oriented style. Large speech bubbles act as attacks that stun Wright's opponent if they connect three times in a row. Once Wright has gathered three viable clues, he can go into his third mode, \"Turnabout Mode\" by using Questioning. Upon doing so, the stage's background music changes to the Pursuit - Corner the Culprit theme, Wright's special attacks become much more powerful, he gains access to his signature finger pointing which releases ghostly pointing fingers that possesses juggling abilities, his projectiles become faster and stronger, and he becomes able to use his Level 3 Hyper Combo, \"Ace Attorney\". For this attack (tied with Vergil's Dark Angel as one of the strongest Hyper Combos in the game), Wright accuses his opponent until they break down, dealing massive amounts of damage. His Level 1 Hyper Combos include \"Steel Samurai Maya Smelting!\", where Maya charges towards the opponent while flailing her arms, and \"Order in the Court\", which summons the nightmare judge to smash both Wright and his opponent with his gavel, knocking Wright back into Investigation Mode if he is currently in Trial Mode.\n\nWhen playing in the game's \"Simple\" mode, Wright will only have access to the Investigation and Courtroom Modes and cannot collect any evidence, therefore locking out Turnabout Mode. However, Wright makes up for this by still having access to his other two Hyper Combos (\"Steel Samurai Maya Smelting\" in Investigation Mode and \"Order in the Court\" in Courtroom Mode), whereas other characters only have access to one.\n\nAs is standard with fighting games, Wright has a number of alternative costumes that reference other characters in the Ace Attorney series, namely: Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Larry Butz, and Godot, as well as a downloadable \"Feenie\" costume (featuring his attire as a college student). His other alternative costume references Sissel from Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, another game by Ace Attorney series creator Shu Takumi.\n\nOther crossover appearances\n\nProfessor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney\n\nWe need more pieces to finish this puzzle. This article is under construction. While it is not short, it still needs expansion as outlined in the manual of style. The article most likely needs expansion near the end of the tagged section or sections.\n\nAt some point during his original career, Phoenix Wright was approached by the Legal League of Attorneys and asked to take part in a business exchange trip to London. He agreed, and so set off for England accompanied by Maya Fey. However, not long after arriving, Wright was asked to defend a mysterious student called Espella Cantabella on charges of theft and assault. Although he had not expected to be defending anyone during the exchange, Wright took the case and not only proved Cantabella innocent, but also revealed that the person she had been charged with assaulting was a jewel thief. However, not long after the case was over, both Wright and Fey were suddenly transported to the mysterious medieval town of Labyrinthia that Cantabella called home. Once there, the trio lost all memory of their previous meeting, with both Wright and Maya also losing their memories of their previous occupations and lives, instead believing they had worked in the local bakery alongside Cantabella for the last five years.\n\nIt was at the bakery that Wright and Fey would first meet Hershel Layton and Luke Triton, who had also been transported to Labyrinthia. Despite having no memory of his former life, Wright once again found himself defending Cantabella in court, albeit this time for murder and being a witch after she was accused of using a fire spell to burn to death two thugs who had attempted to mug her. In the process of proving her innocence, both Wright and Fey regained their memories. The pair then decided to team up with Layton and Triton to solve the mystery behind Labyrinthia. However, it did not take long for Fey to get herself into trouble; whilst investigating the death of an alchemist that had occurred three months prior, she found herself under suspicion of being a witch after Layton was apparently transformed into a gold statue. Although Wright was able to prove Maya's innocence, Cantabella then admitted to being the \"Great Witch Bezella\" in an attempt to stop any more people being executed as witches; if Bezella was killed, then there would be no more need for witch trials as she was the source of all witches. However, while freeing Cantabella from the cage that would be dropped into the flames below, Maya ended up switching places with her. Pinned down by knights, Wright could only watch in horror as Maya was dropped into the fire pit used for executing witches and seemingly killed.\n\nProject X Zone 2\n\nMain article: Project X Zone 2\n\nWe need more pieces to finish this puzzle.

The article most likely needs expansion near the end of the tagged section or sections.\n\nAfter being asked by Heihachi Mishima to defend him on charges of smuggling illegal substances, Phoenix Wright and Maya Fey traveled to Japan and headed to Kamurocho, where they had agreed to meet. Whilst waiting, however, the area became infested with zombies. The two were eventually rescued by Mishima and the yakuza Goro Majima but were forced to retreat down a nearby manhole as the number of zombies increased. The manhole leads to Makai, where Wright eventually met up with Demitri Maximoff and Morrigan Aensland, who agreed to help the duo return to the human world. After rendezvousing with the rest of their group, Wright and Fey were attacked by Baby Bonnie Hood, who was under contract with Shadaloo to kill Wright before he could clear Mishima's name. As the others would be unable to effectively fight off any enemies and protect them at the same time, Aensland supercharged Fey's magatama with spiritual energy, thereby allowing the relatively normal pair to defend themselves against powerful opponents. Hood was eventually forced to retreat, and the group safely made it out of Makai.\n\nIt was here that Reiji Arisu and Xiaomu, members of the special organization Shinra, revealed a threat posed by rival organization Ouma that would have dire consequences for the world. Although initially refusing to assist them, Wright eventually relented after an enthusiastic Fey pointed out that Hood was still after them and that they could use the protection.\n\nEventually, Arisu, Xiaomu, and their allies were able to defeat Ouma, thereby allowing Wright and Fey to return to their old lives. Not long afterward, the two were invited to a reunion at Maximoff's castle alongside all their allies. During the party, a fight broke out between Heihachi Mishima, his son Kazuya, and grandson Jin Kazama, which they agreed to settle in a three-on-three fight. Wright failed to realize until it was too late that he had been selected to fight on Kazuya's team, much to his dismay.\n\nOther media\n\nNear the end of the episode \"Remote Island Syndrome Part 2\" of the anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, the mannerisms of a few of the characters mirror those of the sprites of some Ace Attorney characters. The scene in question is when Haruhi Suzumiya confronts the other characters with the truth about a \"murder\" that had taken place. Haruhi performs a number of actions that are identical to those that Wright performs in the games. The most obvious reference, however, is when she is making her final statement which consists of an extreme close up (with a dramatic blue background) immediately followed by Wright's iconic finger point. The scene can be viewed subbed here or dubbed here.\n\nThe episode \"1 Angry Ghost\" of the anime Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt makes a heavy reference to the Ace Attorney trials. The main characters, Panty and Stocking, are defendants in a sort of twisted game show style trial, accused of murdering a Ghost named Husband Petter. When they are sent to the electric chair, their lawyer, a monkey named Mr. Abrams, is accidentally electrocuted along with them and suddenly becomes intelligent. This is followed by Wright's iconic finger point and a declaration that the prosecution's claims are contradictory, much like in the trailer of Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. Additionally, the witness, Mrs. Wife Petter, breaks down and confesses to the crime. The scene can be viewed here.\n\nPhoenix Wright, Mia Fey, Miles Edgeworth, and Franziska von Karma were all featured as Character Cards in SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS.\n\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective features a minor, blue-suited detective character only known as \"The Blue Detective\" who is partnered with the green-suited Detective McCaw. The blue detective's suit and tie (blue suit, red tie) match those worn by Phoenix Wright during his time as a lawyer and McCaw's suit and tie (green suit, red tie) match Winston Payne's own in Turnabout Memories. McCaw also wears opaque glasses with rectangular frames, much like Payne. These similarities are very likely nods to the Ace Attorney series, as Shu Takumi, the main developer of Ghost Trick, is also the main developer of the core games of the Ace Attorney series.\n\nIn the first chapter/episode of the manga/anime Arakawa Under the Bridge, the protagonist Kou Ichinomiya briefly appears (in an inner monologue) wearing a suit and tie while pointing his finger and objecting. The anime makes the reference to Wright even more apparent by making the suit blue, the tie, red, and showing him wearing an attorney's badge. In the manga, the scene in question can be seen here.\n\nWright appears alongside other Capcom characters in Minna to Capcom All-Stars, a Japan-only social RPG card game for cell phones.\n\nIn episode eight of the anime Meganebu!, Mitsuki Kamatani is seen questioning Hotaka Shirogane whilst wearing a blue suit, white shirt, red tie, and an attorney's badge on its left side, as well as performing Wright's distinctive objection pose (screenshot).\n\nIn episode 24 of the anime, My Bride is a Mermaid, the character Mawari Zenigata at one point gives Phoenix Wright's iconic finger point pose before starting an investigation.\n\nIn the third episode of the anime No Game, No Life, the main character Sora interrupts the coronation of Chlammy Zell by yelling \"Objection!\" (complete with Ace Attorney-style speech bubble) and playing music on his smartphone that is strongly reminiscent of \"Pursuit - Corner the Culprit\" (with the image on his phone showing the game's logo, having \"Game Soundtrack\" as its genre, and giving its title as \"Pursuit ~ I'll Corner You!\"; incidentally, the track's name on the anime's official soundtrack is entitled \"Reverse?\", which is a reference to the \"Turnabout\" theme of the Ace Attorney series). There is even an elderly official present who bears a striking resemblance to the usual judge encountered in the Ace Attorney games. A similar scenario occurs in the fourth episode during an argument between Sora and his stepsister Shiro during the coronation, in which both the same music and elderly official are once again present, only this time with the addition of the \"Hold it!\" interjection. While these interjections are being shouted, the characteristic speech bubbles of the Ace Attorney series flash across the screen.\n\nIn the second chapter (Sea and Punishment, Sin and Coconuts) of the murder mystery visual novel video game Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, the character Ibuki Mioda references Wright and the Ace Attorney series by stating, \"Gravel *inside* the swimsuit?! Even the ace attorney would be astonished by such a fantastic idea!\" In the same chapter, the game's main antagonist Monokuma dresses up in a blue suit with a red tie and a small golden badge, similar to Phoenix Wright's design in the original trilogy.\n\nIn the special \"Tanabata Festival Live\" episode of the anime Inazuma Eleven GO Chrono Stone, Matsukaze Tenma points out that there is \"clearly a contradiction\" in the claims made by Alpha. While doing so, he points while shouting \"Objection!\", with Tsurugi Kyousuke telling him that he has the \"wrong series\". After Tenma points out that Alpha's very existence contradicts his own claim, the latter screams in horror while gripping his head, akin to the over-the-top breakdown animations used in the Ace Attorney series. Incidentally, the Inazuma Eleven and Professor Layton series are both Level-5 franchises, with Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney being released in Japan at roughly the same time as the aforementioned episode was aired.\n\nThe \"Lawyered Up\" ending of The Henry Stickmin Collection's second game parodies the Ace Attorney games, with almost every element in the ending being a reference, including an almost identical courtroom, very similar music, a bearded judge, and a defense attorney called Felix White (who was even named Phoenix Wright in the original flash game).\n\nThe video game Judgment features a side case called \"Justice is Sweet\", which acts as a homage to the Ace Attorney series. In the case, a lawyer accuses her co-worker of eating a special cake she bought, and a makeshift trial is held to determine his guilt, with protaganist Takayuki Yagami acting as the defense. The case features various references to the Ace Attorney franchise, including dramatic objections while pointing, the \"prosecution\" presenting damning last-minute evidence, and a \"turnabout\" moment by Yagami when he works out what actually happened to the cake, complete with dramatic music reminiscent of \"Pursuit - Corner the Culprit\".\n\nHalfway in the episode \"Goose Bumps! I Am A Goose Now\" of the anime Romantic Killer, the main protagonist Anzu Hoshino comically claims she will sue another character for defamation in a cutaway scene where she dresses up in Phoenix's attire in a courtroom and assumes the iconic finger pointing pose while holding a book as a word bubble with the Japanese characters for \"defamation\" appears beside her.\n\nReferences\n\nPhoenix Wright: Ace Attorney characters The First Turnabout\n\nLarry Butz · Mia Fey · Judge · Winston Payne · Frank Sahwit · Cindy Stone · Phoenix Wright\n\nTurnabout Sisters\n\nBellboy · Charley · Miles Edgeworth · Maya Fey · Mia Fey · Misty Fey · Marvin Grossberg · Dick Gumshoe · Judge · April May · Redd White · Phoenix Wright\n\nTurnabout Samurai\n\nCharley · Miles Edgeworth · Evil Magistrate · Maya Fey · Mia Fey · Dick Gumshoe · Cody Hackins · Jack Hammer · Judge · Sal Manella · Manuel · Mr. Monkey · Penny Nichols · Wendy Oldbag · Will Powers · Pink Princess · Steel Samurai · Dee Vasquez · Phoenix Wright\n\nTurnabout Goodbyes\n\n(Bellboy) · Blue Badger · Larry Butz · Charley · Chief · Blaise Debeste · Gregory Edgeworth · Miles Edgeworth · Maya Fey · Mia Fey · Misty Fey · Gourdy · Marvin Grossberg · Dick Gumshoe · (Cody Hackins) · Robert Hammond · Lotta Hart · Polly Jenkins · Judge · Missile · (Penny Nichols) · (Wendy Oldbag) · (Winston Payne) · Pink Princess · Polly · (Will Powers) · Steel Samurai · Manfred von Karma · Phoenix Wright · Yanni Yogi\n\nRise from the Ashes\n\nJean Armstrong · Bellboy · Billy · Blue Badger · Charley · Chief · Joe Darke · Miles Edgeworth · (Maya Fey) · Mia Fey · Damon Gant · Bruce Goodman · Dick Gumshoe · Judge · Jake Marshall · Neil Marshall · Mike Meekins · Wendy Oldbag · Ema Skye · Lana Skye · Angel Starr · Steel Samurai · Manfred von Karma · Phoenix Wright\n\nPhoenix Wright: Ace Attorney -
