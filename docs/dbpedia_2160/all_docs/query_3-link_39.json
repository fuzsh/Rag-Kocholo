        "text": "Tim Harrington started working with banks and credit unions in 1988. Tim and TEAM Resources have a long history of helping financial institutions move forward with greater confidence, profitability and integrity, to serve their market or field of membership better. His leadership topics and board governance training have taken him beyond the financial services industry.\n\nWhile there are many “speakers,” Tim “talks.” He talks from the heart. More importantly, he talks to the heart. It is the heart where each of us truly lives. Inspiring people in an organization requires first, touching their hearts. Helping them to feel and see what a group is attempting to accomplish is the key. Everyone wants to do their best – for themselves, their family, their co-workers, their customers. When their “heart is in it” their best can emerge.\n\nIn Tim’s talks, Eisenhower on Enlightened Leadership and A Higher Purpose, he inspires people to live their highest dreams and their highest ideals. He encourages individuals and organizations to live “on purpose.” To do something so someone else’s life can be better. Tim reminds people that if they help other’s achieve their dreams, they will achieve and even surpass their own.\n\nStephen M. R.

Covey latest book is Trust & Inspire in which he lays out his vision for a new form of leadership as well as a framework and in-depth advice to guide you there.\n\nStephen M. R.

Never one to be classified as merely an athlete, Jackie says, “I strive to be a Jackie of all trades.”\n\nJackie Joyner Kersee has received many prestigious awards, including the St. Louis Ambassadors Sportswoman of the Year, Sporting News Athlete of the Year Award (the first woman to receive either of these awards), the Sullivan Award, and consecutively winning the Jesse Owens Memorial Award.
