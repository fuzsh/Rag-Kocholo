        "text": "Jackie Robinson and the Color Line is an exhibition of the collection of Paul Reiferson, that uses photographs and artifacts to vividly narrate the story of baseball’s journey toward integration.\n\nJackie Robinson, a trailblazing figure in civil rights, shattered baseball’s color line when Martin Luther King Jr. was still in college, earning praise from King as “a sit-inner before the sit-ins, a freedom rider before freedom rides.” The exhibition frames Robinson’s odyssey within a larger one that had begun sixty years earlier, when men like Fleet and Weldy Walker, Sol White, Robert Higgins, and Javan Emory played for integrated teams in the late 19th century.\n\nThe visual history of the Negro Leagues is marked by absence: black newspapers, lacking large photography staffs, rarely shot games, and white newspapers saw little profit in it. When black players approached or crossed the boundary into the white world, however, they became more visible. Inspired by this insight, this collection of photographs, complemented by significant objects offering context, directs its focus to narratives situated proximate to the color line, communicating both the forward-flowing hopes of integration and the undertow of racism and, in no modest measure, derives its impact from these competing currents.\n\nThis collection of over 60 objects has been meticulously curated over more than a quarter century and spans the years 1885-1955. The endpoint was chosen because it coincides with the beginning of the modern civil rights movement and Martin Luther King Jr.’s activism, to which the long challenge to baseball’s color line serves as a prologue acknowledged by King himself.\n\nPlease note: The word “Negro” appears several times throughout this exhibition. Historically, this term was used to denote persons of Black African ancestry. Although some people utilized it to promote positive Black identity in the mid-20th century, it began to take on increasingly negative connotations during the American civil rights movement. We use it only in reference to the Negro Leagues, as those institutions were known at the time, and when citing historically significant quotes.\n\nLegend has it that it was because of Javan Emory's extraordinary skills as a ball player that the color line was drawn by the National League. This is the only extant image of Emory and one of two known prints, this example being the finest.\n\nSince its discovery near Philadelphia a generation ago, this image continues to raise a central question: why was this black man presented so powerfully—in equipment many young white men could not afford and in the standard pose of the tough catcher they aspired to be—when the most widely seen images of black baseball at the time, circa 1885, were racist lithographs with catchers wearing birdcages as masks?\n\nOnly recently did we learn the answer: the subject, Javan Emory, was not just any catcher. In an obituary published in 1923, the claim was made that Emory actually crossed the color line and played for Boston in the National League; at the time the obituary was published, Jackie Robinson was five years old. Other newspaper accounts of Emory make a further claim:\n\nTERRIFIC BATTING OF THE LOCAL MAN HELD DIRE RESULTS FOR HIS RACE\n\nJavan Emory, the well known head waiter at the Mansion House, has the credit of sealing the fate of the negro ball player so far as the National League is concerned. Just because Mr. Emory put his eagle eye on the ball, and proceeded to bat the cover off in a game between Boston and Toronto, the ban was placed on the colored man by the senior major league.\n\nLINK to Paul Reiferson's essay \"He Wears the Mask\" in Southwest Review, November 3, 2015\n\nRobert Higgins, pitcher, was one of the last black players to play professional baseball on an integrated team until Jackie Robinson, almost sixty years later.\n\nManager Simmons ordered the Syracuse Stars to report at eleven o’clock on a Sunday morning to the studio operated by P. S. Ryder, who was also a club shareholder, to have a team portrait made, but two of Higgins’s teammates refused to be photographed with him. Ryder produced this composite in lieu of a team photograph.\n\nThe Syracuse Evening Herald reported:\n\n“Neither Pitcher Crothers nor Left Fielder Simon reported at the hour named…It was said among the players that these men objected to having their pictures taken with the colored pitcher, Higgins. It was understood that Simon was following the lead of Crothers…He gives as his reason for not appearing at the photograph gallery that as a Southern born man he could not consent to have his picture taken in a group with Higgins, a negro. He was not willing to appear in a picture with him, but did not object to playing with him. None of the other players in the team seems to be opposed to Higgins. He is a quiet, respectful, gentlemanly young fellow, and when his trouble came about and he saw that there was a feeling against his color, he went to the Washington House where he boards, and cried like a child.”\n\nAfter leaving baseball, Moses Fleetwood (Fleet) Walker, explored the idea of black Americans emigrating to Africa as a last resort option after the Supreme Court’s decisions in the 1883 civil rights cases reinforced racial segregation. After a generation of segregation and violence, Walker no longer saw any foundation for \"a hope that the lot of the American Negro will grow better,\" and, as a result, he saw no alternative to mass resettlement in Liberia.\n\nFleet Walker, Weldy Walker's brother, became the first man to cross the color line on May 1, 1884 when he caught barehanded for Toledo of the American Association, then considered a major league. He was released at the end of the season because of injury, but the animus of some white opponents also played a role.\n\nDuring an exhibition game between Toledo and Chicago in August 1883, Cap Anson, one of the most popular players of his era, objected to taking the field against Walker. Told his team would forfeit their share of the gate receipts, Anson replied, \"We'll play this here game, but won't play never more with the n***** in.\" Because of Anson's popularity, this incident was widely discussed, and it is generally seen as the beginning of the end of integrated baseball.\n\nThis is the only copy of Walker's pamphlet in private hands; the only other known example is in the collection of the University of Michigan, which Walker attended.\n\n“In no other profession has the color line been drawn more rigidly than in base ball,” wrote Sol White in his History of Colored Base Ball (1907).\n\nIn this context, one particularly searing moment reveals itself in hindsight to have been a turning point: in 1903, a black catcher named Charles Thomas, a student at Ohio Wesleyan, was traveling with coach Branch Rickey to play in South Bend, Indiana. Two matching photographs in the collection, one saved by Thomas and the other by Rickey, help tell the story. Rickey spoke publicly about the lasting effect of this experience at a Rotary Club luncheon in April 1945, four months before his first contact with Jackie Robinson; Robinson himself shared the story in his autobiography.\n\nSol White wrote of preliminary plans to get someone across the color line: first, of Baltimore manager John McGraw’s scheme to sign Charlie Grant by passing him off as Native American, which McGraw accomplished, only to have the ruse detected immediately; and second, of the Boston Braves wanting to sign William Clarence Matthews, who had just graduated from Harvard. Both Grant and Matthews are pictured here. “In no other profession has the color line been drawn more rigidly than in base ball,” wrote Sol White in his History of Colored Base Ball (1907). Both the virulent racism of this period and the angry reaction to it can be seen through several objects.\n\nCharlie Grant, standing second from left, almost crossed the color line in 1901. Sol White told his story in his book History of Colored Base Ball (1907).\n\nWhile Manager [John] McGraw [of the American League's Baltimore Orioles] was in Hot Springs, Ark., preparing to enter the season of 1901, he was attracted toward Chas. Grant....With the color line so rigidly enforced in the American League, McGraw was at a loss as to how he could get Grant for his Baltimore bunch. [McGraw] conceived the idea of introducing Grant in the league as a Native American. Had it not been for friends of Grant being so eager to show their esteem while the Baltimores were playing in Chicago, McGraw's little scheme would have worked nicely. As it was, the bouquet tendered to Grant, which was meant as a gift for the colored man, was really his undoing. McGraw was immediately notified to release Grant at once, as colored players would not be tolerated in the league.\n\nLINK to more on Charlie Grant.\n\nIn 1903, Charles Thomas (second row, third from left) faced an act of discrimination so searing that it haunted Branch Rickey (top row, left), then the baseball coach at Ohio Wesleyan, and inspired him to be instrumental in dismantling the color line in Major League Baseball.\n\n\"From the first day at Ohio Wesleyan,\" catcher Charles Thomas later recalled, \"Branch Rickey took a special interest in my welfare.\" In May 1903, the team traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play Notre Dame. The Oliver Hotel, where the team had reservations, refused to allow Thomas to lodge. Rickey convinced the hotel manager to place a cot in his room for Thomas to sleep on, as they would do for a black servant. That night Thomas wept and rubbed his hands as if trying to rub off the color. \"Black skin! Black skin!\" he said to Rickey. \"If only I could make them white.\"\n\n\"That scene haunted me for many years,\" explained Rickey, \"and I vowed that I would always do whatever I could to see that other Americans did not have to face the bitter humiliation that was heaped upon Charles Thomas.\"\n\nBranch Rickey told Jackie Robinson that he integrated baseball for Charles Thomas. Robinson himself recounted this story in his autobiography, I Never Had it Made. As Robinson wrote, “Thirty-five [sic] years later, while I was lying awake nights, frustrated, unable to see a future, Mr. Rickey, by now the president of the Dodgers, was also lying awake at night, trying to make up his mind about a new experiment. He had never forgotten the agony of that black athlete.”\n\nThe collection includes the only two known prints in private hands of this 1903 image—one that belonged to Charles Thomas and the other to Branch Rickey.\n\nA scene in the movie 42 was invented to introduce the true story of Charles Thomas.

[see link HERE]\n\nWilliam Clarence Matthews, of Harvard, was considered as a candidate to be the first to cross the color line.\n\nSol White informed the readers of his History of Colored Base Ball in 1907 that, \"[i]t is said on good authority that one of the leading players and a manager of the National League [Fred Tenney of the Boston Nationals] is advocating the entrance of colored players in the National League with a view of signing '[William Clarence] Matthews,' late of Harvard. It is not expected that he will succeed in this advocacy of such a move, but when such actions come to notice there are grounds for hoping that some day the bar will drop and some good man will be chosen from out of the colored profession that will be a credit to all, and pave the way for others to follow.\"\n\nTwo years earlier, Matthews had raged against the color line to a reporter from the Boston Evening Traveler: \"I think it's an outrage that colored men are discriminated against in the big leagues. What a shame it is that black men are barred forever from participating in the national game. I should think that Americans should rise up in revolt against such a condition. Many negroes are brilliant players and should not be shut out because their skin is black.\"\n\nMatthews went on to become one of the first black district attorneys in the country.\n\nExhibited: Who Shot Sports: A Photographic History, 1843 to the Present.

Four days later, Sukeforth and Robinson traveled to New York to meet with Rickey, a seminal moment in the histories of both baseball and civil rights. It was at this meeting that Rickey convinced Robinson of the necessity to “turn the other cheek” for the experiment to be successful, and Robinson signed a contract that day—since lost—crossing the color line for the first time since 1889.\n\nBranch Rickey’s original strategy was to sign several black players for Dodgers minor league teams and announce them all at once. A contract with Don Newcombe, signed eight days before Robinson signed with Montreal, was part of this strategy. But Rickey’s hand was forced by a forthcoming city government report calling for integration and mentioning that signings were imminent. Fearing the announcement of Robinson’s signing would then appear to have been influenced from outside, Rickey asked for the report to be postponed and ordered Robinson to fly to Montreal to sign a contract.\n\nIn addition to Don Newcombe, the original announcement was likely intended to include Johnny Wright, Roy Campanella, and Roy Partlow; all signed directly with Dodgers affiliates in the months after Robinson.\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate the historical significance of these two telegrams (see next object), as they are the only surviving objects related directly to the events of August 1945. The first establishes that contact with Robinson had been made by the Dodgers organization and arranged for the historic meeting between Robinson and Rickey; the best explanation for the second is that it sets forth a plan to get Robinson to sign his color-line crossing contract that day.\n\nOn August 24, 1945, Sukeforth made first contact with Robinson while he was with the Kansas City Monarchs in Chicago. “I called him over and introduced myself,” Sukeforth recalled to Rickey. “I asked if, during the practice, he would go to his right and throw the ball overhand with something on it; and to have somebody hit him balls over there. He said he would be very glad to, except for the fact that he was not playing. He said, ‘I fell on my shoulder several days ago and won't be able to play for probably a week.’ I then asked him if he would come down to the Stevens and meet me after the game…I made a date with Robinson to meet me at the Toledo park…I think I wired or telephoned you that I was bringing the player in, and you told me to go ahead.”\n\nThe August 24 telegram refers to Robinson twice as “player” because Rickey insisted on absolute secrecy. On August 28, 1945, as arranged by this telegram, Rickey and Robinson met for the first time, for three hours at Rickey’s 215 Montague Street office in Brooklyn. Rickey delivered the message that he wanted a player with enough guts not to fight back, and Robinson signed a—now lost—contract that Rickey dictated on the spot rather than the typical uniform contract that all players signed.\n\nThe second telegram was sent by Rickey that morning. “Plans changed,” it reads. Rickey had likely decided to ask Robinson to sign an unusual contract that day, requiring Sukeforth to call ahead because he was to be the contract’s counterparty. By signing what Rickey later called an “acceptance of terms” with Sukeforth rather than a standard contract with the Montreal Royals, Rickey would lock Robinson up without having to widen the circle of who knew about the great experiment. The other way in which plans had changed was that Sukeforth had been told only that Robinson might sign with Rickey’s Brooklyn Brown Dodgers. Sukeforth suspected, but had no way to know until the 28th, that plans had changed in that Robinson was wanted for the Dodgers.\n\nLINK to a scene of the August 28 meeting from the movie 42.\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate the historical significance of these two telegrams (see previous object), as they are the only surviving objects related directly to the events of August 1945.

His original plan was to sign several players—Robinson, Newcombe, Campanella, Wright, Partlow, and others—and announce them all at once. Having each player sign with a Dodgers affiliate, whether the Montreal Royals or the Nashua or Danville Dodgers, would have required widening the circle of those with knowledge of Rickey’s plans. To provide a cover story in the event his too-evident interest in black players was revealed, Rickey formed a black club called the Brooklyn Brown Dodgers, though none of the men Rickey signed ever joined that roster.\n\nIn this contract, Newcombe signs with Sukeforth, who will contract on Newcombe’s behalf “with any club,” including the Brooklyn Brown Dodgers, but it is quite clear from the language that Rickey and Sukeforth wanted the contract to be broad enough to anticipate a white club.\n\nJohnny Wright was Jackie Robinson's roommate at the Dodgers' minor league affiliate, the Montreal Royals. He never made it to the Dodgers, but he did cross the color line.\n\nOf the men who crossed, none had it harder than the pitchers. Johnny Wright, Roy Partlow, and Dan Bankhead—pitchers all—had particular difficulties with the added pressure.\n\nRobinson explained: “John had all the ability in the world. But John couldn’t stand the pressure of being one of the first…If he had come in two or three years later when the pressure was off, John could have made it in the Major Leagues.”\n\nReflecting on the great experiment, Branch Rickey spoke of the “guts” necessary to effect change, and Wright’s struggle no doubt made a difference for others. As Wright said in February 1946, “There’ll be more and more colored boys in professional sports. I got this far by plugging, and I expect to keep on punching. That's all it takes.”\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. famously remarked that his job was made easier by Jackie Robinson, Don Newcombe, and Roy Campanella. Robinson, however, was not particularly close with the other two men and there were occasionally very sharp differences of opinion on how to fight racism. For example, when a St. Louis hotel that had previously discriminated against them finally relented, Campanella and Newcombe chose to stay at the segregated hotel, to reward the proprietor who they felt had been good to them for years. Robinson, however, argued it was their duty to integrate the white hotel. “I’m no crusader,” Campanella replied. “I’m a ball player.”\n\nCampanella was the sixth black player to appear in the Major Leagues. He won the Most Valuable Player award a year after Robinson and went on to win it a total of three times. Later he was elected to the Hall of Fame, also after Robinson. His career was cut short by the color line, which delayed his debut until he was 26, and then by a tragic car accident, which rendered him a quadriplegic.\n\nEffa Manley was co-owner of the Newark Eagles, the team that produced Don Newcombe, Larry Doby, and George “Mule” Suttles, shown here “teaching” Manley something she obviously knew—how to hold a bat. Manley was a complex and assertive figure who worked for civil rights and also very publicly castigated Jackie Robinson for disparaging the Negro Leagues and Branch Rickey for failing to pay teams like the Eagles for their star players.\n\nWhen Branch Rickey signed Don Newcombe of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley wrote to him seeking compensation under Newcombe's contract, which may have contained a clause reserving his services for the following season, and was ignored. She also confronted Rickey in person.\n\nRobinson added insult to injury in 1948 when he wrote an article for Ebony magazine titled “What’s Wrong with Negro Baseball.” Robinson's attack angered some, particularly Manley, who responded in an essay for Our World magazine: \"I charge Jackie Robinson with being ungrateful and—more likely—stupid. Jackie Robinson is where he is today because of organized Negro baseball...He says Branch Rickey was fair and democratic. How much did Rickey pay the Kansas City Monarchs for Robinson? The answer? Zero. At this moment, the livelihoods, the careers, the families of 400 Negro ballplayers are in jeopardy because four players have been successful in getting into the major leagues.\"\n\nManley was the first woman elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nShe kept a copy of this photograph in her scrapbook.\n\nThis letter to Paul Krichell, who had discovered Lou Gehrig and was now head scout for the New York Yankees, indicates that the Yankees could have had almost any Negro League player they wanted—including Willie Mays—but that they had a policy of excluding them. Prior to the discovery of this letter, it was possible to argue that the Yankees’ slowness in signing black players was due to complacency, possibly because they won World Series titles in 1947 and 1949, had DiMaggio in center field, and had just signed Mickey Mantle to the Independence Yankees.\n\nJoe Press, manager of the Brooklyn Bushwicks, who fielded multi-ethnic rosters and played exhibition games against Negro League teams, was well-placed to observe the talent of black stars and report his findings to Krichell. The policy change Press alludes to permitted the Yankees to draft Elston Howard in 1950; he would join the Yankees as their first black player in 1955.\n\nThe letter also sheds light on efforts by people whose names are forgotten to break down racial barriers in baseball.\n\nJackie Robinson signed a contract to play for a Dodgers farm team, the Montreal Royals of the International League, on October 23, 1945, and Life quickly arranged for his first photographic feature. Beginning with this session, Robinson was photographed heroically throughout his baseball career—more consistently than any other player in the twentieth century, including Babe Ruth. This imagery was employed even before Robinson had accomplished anything on the field. As another Life photographer would later note about the Mercury astronauts, the mere act of being chosen was enough.\n\nLife photographer Harold Carter met Robinson at Ebbets Field, although Robinson would not play there for another 17 months. Carter could have photographed Robinson's batting grip, as other Life photographers had done with Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams, but he made a conscious decision not to, instead showing Robinson about to take the bat in his hands as he prepares to start baseball's \"great experiment.\" Using Robinson's own sweatshirt and pants as a graphic device to highlight his skin, the result is a portrait at least as interesting as any traditional photograph of a face.\n\nLINK to Life, November 26, 1945, pp. 133-4, 137, cover.\n\nThis photograph, taken during a contract signing, exemplifies Branch Rickey’s deliberate use of images and powerful symbolism in shaping the narrative of Jackie Robinson’s integration into Major League Baseball. For this photo opportunity, Rickey removed all the photographs on the walls except for the Lincoln portrait.\n\nAfter the Dodgers first announced in 1945 that Robinson would be playing in Montreal, one of Branch Rickey's old enemies told the press: \"We question Branch Rickey's statements that he is another Abraham Lincoln and that he has a heart as big as a watermelon and that he loves all mankind.\" As this photograph makes clear, Rickey liked the comparison and the symbolism the president's portrait provided as the backdrop to a contract signing photo opportunity. Rickey's admiration for Lincoln was real; so was his understanding of the power of images.\n\nRickey's office walls regularly displayed several images, as similar photographs of other contract signings make clear. The empty hook for a large frame can be seen above Robinson, and the frames themselves can be seen leaning against the wall.\n\nRobinson’s introduction to Major League Baseball was meticulously planned to include carefully controlled media to maximize the probability of success. On occasion, sympathetic photographers acting spontaneously helped the cause, as with this image in which children who were genuinely admiring of Robinson were asked to pretend to get his autograph. This was taken before a pre-season game that marked Robinson's first appearance in a Major League uniform.\n\nEddie Dweck, the boy at the far left reaching toward Robinson, recalled the scene 66 years later:\n\n“We had maybe bleacher seats, the cheapest seats, and we were trying to get to the Dodger dugout just like we tried to get to the Dodger dugout every game we went. But there were a hundred photographers taking pictures of him. This was a momentous day. So they told the ushers ‘let these kids come down, and lean over like you’re trying to get his autograph.’ And that’s how we got down there. It was a matter of a few minutes, five minutes, ten minutes as I remember. Then we had to scatter. It looks like he’s signing something, but I don’t think anybody got an autograph, not while I was there.\"\n\nThis recently discovered photograph is the only known example of an image capturing the verbal abuse Robinson suffered on the field during his rookie year. Robinson said that this specific experience nearly broke him.\n\nMembers of the Phillies taunt Jackie Robinson or, possibly, gleefully reenact their taunting for a photographer. As Robinson would later write, Tuesday, April 22, 1947, \"of all the unpleasant days in my life, brought me nearer to cracking up than I had ever been:\n\nStarting to the plate in the first inning, I could scarcely believe my ears. Almost as if it had been synchronized by some master conductor, hate poured forth from the Phillies dugout.\n\n'Hey, n*****, why don't you go back to the cotton field where you belong?'\n\n'They're waiting for you in the jungles, black boy!'\n\n'Hey, snowflake, which one of the white boys' wives are you dating tonight?'\n\n'We don't want you here, n*****.'\n\n'Go back to the bushes!'\n\nThose insults and taunts were only samples of the torrent of abuse which poured out from the Phillies dugout that April day.\"\n\nLarry Doby had played for Effa Manley’s Newark Eagles prior to World War II, but during his service, with no path to Major League Baseball, he decided to become a teacher and coach. “But when I heard about Jackie,” Doby remembered, “I decided to concentrate on baseball.” He rejoined the Eagles after the war, capturing the attention of Cleveland owner Bill Veeck, who shared Branch Rickey’s interest in black players but not his parsimony: Veeck compensated Effa Manley for Doby’s contract.\n\nAlthough Jackie Robinson gets almost all of the credit for integrating baseball—Robinson’s photographs outnumber Doby’s ten-to-one, even though Doby played in more games—the two men were subjected to similar ordeals, particularly because Doby began alone in the American League. “It was 11 weeks between the time Jackie Robinson and I came into the majors,” Doby recalled. “I can’t see how things were any different for me than they were for him.”\n\nOn his first day, two teammates refused to shake Doby’s hand. Fans, however, were more accepting: “As Doby emerged and started across the field to the Cleveland bench,” a sportswriter put it, “a few spectators saw him and applauded. With each step the chorus swelled until, as he approached the first base dugout, it had attained the proportions of an ovation. An uncommonly large proportion of the spectators were colored, but it was noticed that Negroes and whites alike joined in the greeting.”\n\nDoby became a seven-time All-Star and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nThis image was used as the basis for the illustration featured on Doby’s 1950 [included in the collection and pictured above] and 1951 baseball cards made by the Bowman Gum Company.\n\nLarry Doby was the second black player to cross the color line, making his debut with the Cleveland Indians in July 1947, 11 weeks after Robinson joined the Dodgers. Despite the parallel significance of their achievements—Doby was all alone in the American League while Robinson was in the National League—his impact remains significantly overshadowed by Robinson's. Doby's accomplishments, however, were profound. A seven-time All-Star and the first black player to hit a home run in a World Series game, Doby was instrumental in challenging racial barriers.\n\nCleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck faced resistance from some players when integrating Larry Doby as the American League's first black player. Veeck acknowledged economic concerns among players but emphasized the inevitability of racial integration in baseball, stating, \"The entrance of Negroes into the majors is not only inevitable—it is here.\" Veeck initially expressed optimism about the pace of change, signing Doby with the reasoning that Robinson had proven himself as a skilled player. However, within two weeks, he tempered expectations, noting that only a limited number of worthy Negro League players remained. Surprisingly, Branch Rickey concurred with Veeck, expressing doubt that many black players would succeed. As historian Jules Tygiel has pointed out, however, Veeck and Rickey had scouting reports suggesting otherwise (see, for example, the October 1945 scouting report of Calvin Irvin). One explanation, consistent with Rickey's meticulous preparations for Robinson's integration, could be Rickey's awareness of Gunnar Myrdal's, An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and American Democracy. Myrdal wrote, “If Negro workers are introduced a few at a time, if they are carefully picked, if the leaders of the white workers are taken into confidence, and if the reasons for the action are explained, then the trouble can be minimized, and the new policy may eventually become successful.”\n\nThe pennant and pins were sold by vendors outside Ebbets Field and Cleveland Stadium to capitalize on the desire of fans to show their support for Robinson and Doby.\n\nDan Bankhead was the first black pitcher to join the Dodgers and Jackie Robinson's roommate. Despite high expectations, Bankhead did not succeed. Negro League great Buck O'Neill explained:\n\n\"See, here’s what I always heard. Dan was scared to death that he was going to hit a white boy with a pitch. He thought there might be some sort of riot if he did it. Dan was from Alabama just like [Satchel Paige]. But Satchel became a man of the world. Dan was always from Alabama....He heard all those people calling him names, making those threats, and he was scared. He’d seen black men get lynched.\"\n\nThe letters, all written during Bankhead's first days, are filled with hope, admiration, and advice. One fan addressed Bankhead's problem directly: \"The trouble is that those few people who hate to see any Negro get ahead have such big mouths that there seem to be a lot of them. Remember that when you're on the mound.\"\n\nThis iconic photograph symbolizes Satchel Paige’s long-awaited breakthrough into Major League Baseball. The old Cleveland uniform, however, is a reminder that Baseball had more work to do. An example of the patch from 1947-1950, is also included in the collection. [See secondary image]\n\n\"Satch' Makes the Majors,\" declared Life in July 1948. The magazine ran a variation of this image with the caption: \"Paige loves rest and after a workout likes to flop and watch his teammates drill, extending the mighty feet that helped earn him his nickname. As a free-lance pitcher Paige made about $30,000 a season. His possessions now include four fancy cars, five hunting dogs and more than 20 expensive shotguns.\"\n\nPhotographer George Silk dramatically foreshortened Paige to exaggerate the size of his feet, which the public believed were the source of his nickname. \"My feet ain't got nothing to do with my nickname,\" Paige explained, \"but when folks get it in their heads that a feller's got big feet, soon the feet start looking big.\"\n\nAccording to Paige’s biographer Larry Tye, the full story of how Leroy Robert Paige became Satchel Paige is as follows:\n\nAll the Paige kids knew by the age of six that they had to help to put food on the table and, in a good year, shoes on their feet. Leroy worked the alleyways like a pro, cashing in empty bottles he found there. Delivering ice also brought in small change. But he was springing up like a weed in a bog, and as he grew so did Lula’s and John’s expectations of his earning power. The obvious place to look for work was the nearby L&N station, where the pint-sized porter polished the boots of wealthy white travelers or carried their bags to hotels like Mobile’s luxurious Battle House for as little as a dime. Realizing he could not bring home a real day’s pay if he made just 10 cents at a time, he got a pole and some rope and jerry-rigged a contraption that let him sling together two, three, or four satchels and cart them all at once. His invention quadrupled his income. It also drew chuckles from the other baggage boys. “You look like a walking satchel tree,” one of them yelled. The description fit him to a tee and it stuck. “LeRoy Paige,” he said, “became no more and Satchel Paige took over.”\n\nLINK to Larry Tye’s full article.\n\nThis photograph, featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated on April 11, 1955, marked a historic moment as the first time a national magazine showcased a white woman and a black man touching.\n\nAs can be seen from these two images, Peskin had a version in which Mays and Laraine Day were not next to each other. Editors would later recall they did not consider the possibility some might react negatively to an image of a white woman with her arm around a black man.\n\nSome readers reacted very negatively, revealing the deep-seated racial tensions of the time. A reader from Nashville wrote: \"To tell you that I was shocked at SI's cover would be putting it mildly...The informative note inside the magazine tells me that this is Mrs. Leo Durocher, a white woman, with her arm affectionately around the neck of Willie Mays, a Negro ballplayer...Let me say to you, Sir, the most appalling blow ever struck this country, the most disastrous thing that ever happened to the people of America, was the recent decision of the Supreme Court declaring segregation unconstitutional.\"\n\nResponding to that letter and others, a reader from Long Beach, New York, wrote: “I was disgusted at the letters concerning the cover of Willie Mays and Mrs. Leo Durocher. I may be only 15 years old but I have more common sense than any adult with those ideas.”\n\nThese handwritten notes were drafted near the end of Branch Rickey’s life. The contents overlap closely with the speech Rickey was giving when he suffered a stroke, never to regain consciousness and may be preparatory.\n\nRickey writes about the influence of Zaccheus, from the Gospel of Luke, and of Giovanni Papini’s Life of Christ (1923), from which he read to Robinson during their first meeting, to make sure Robinson understood the importance of turning the other cheek.\n\nRickey also writes of Gunnar Myrdal’s monumental An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and American Democracy (1944), which provided Rickey’s strategy of picking black players carefully, introducing them a few at a time, taking the leaders of the white workers into confidence, and explaining the reasons for the action.\n\nMoving back and forth between religious principles and Myrdal’s philosophical and practical arguments, Rickey concludes, “This thing boils down to devotion to oughtness.” In the margin, he adds, “It is difficult to understand how anyone can reconcile the teachings of Christ with the denial of moral responsibility to human beings of a different race or origin.”\n\nFinally, Rickey turns to courage. The idea is “explosive—instant, uncompromising—never falters under adverse surprise—can be possessed by election, can abide and be permanent...It shows itself without thinking—it counts no credit for its cumulative score. One does not know he has it. It is the visible show of paying without asking the price.”\n\nCaptured by Life photographer Ralph Morse during Game 3 of the 1955 World Series against the Yankees, this photograph shows Robinson mischievously working to distract catcher Yogi Berra and rattle pitcher Bob Turley. It is almost always described as “Jackie Robinson rounding third base,” but the fact that he is provocatively dancing off the bag actually makes the photograph all the more rousing, and representative of his style of play.\n\n“Life sent me to cover the Series,” Ralph Morse explained, “but I didn’t know anything about shooting baseball. I planted myself between photographers for the Times and the Daily News, and when they pointed their cameras at something, I pointed mine, too. I’d been down at Cape Canaveral covering rocket launches, and I brought a high-speed missile-tracking camera—10 frames a second—with me to New York. That camera was pointed at third base, and rigged with a foot pedal. When the crowd starting yelling about Robinson dancing off of third, I turned from whatever I’d been shooting, made sure Robinson was in the shot, and hit that pedal.” Morse’s photograph remains one of the defining baseball portraits. That Robinson was photographed with a high-speed, missile-tracking camera works as both truth and legend."
