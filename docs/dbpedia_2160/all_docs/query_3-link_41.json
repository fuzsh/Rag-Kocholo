The powerful new duo of KDS Platinum Records and Wright will be launching the new, Orlando-based, boy band No Lonely Hearts (NLH). Johnny Wright made his mark in the music industry managing acts like the Backstreet Boys and later NSync. He is known for catapulting some of music’s greatest artists to worldwide fame including: Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, and The Jonas Brothers. Steve Ruff, President of KDS Platinum Records believes that No Lonely Hearts (NLH) will usher in a new era of fans to the boy band genre and that No Lonely Hearts (NLH) will reach the same epic heights as their successful predecessors like Backstreet and NSync. Ruff stated, “having the guidance of someone like Johnny Wright brings experience far beyond our reach. He has always been someone who makes the magic happen. His abilities in the industry and relationships with the record labels afford No Lonely Hearts (NLH) the best opportunity to exceed all expectations.” #music #musicindustry #opportunity #experience #like #ceo #entertainment #NoLonelyHearts #NLH #BoyBand #OrlandoBoyBand"
