His 55 victories since the start of the 2018 season are top eight nationally, and he is one of only four active FBS head coaches to lead multiple programs to New Year’s Six Bowl appearances in the College Football Playoff era. His teams have earned bowl berths all six seasons and finished in the top 10 nationally in scoring offense and total offense five times. The son of a successful head coach, Heupel has studied the game his entire life and reached the pinnacle of the sport as both a player and assistant coach.\n\nThe 44-year-old has coached and played in multiple national championship games, won eight conference championships, coached in 19 bowl games, developed two Heisman Trophy winners and five top-five Heisman finishers.\n\nThe 2024 season will be his seventh as a head coach and fourth in charge of the Tennessee Volunteers.\n\nTennessee Turnaround\n\nTaking over a program coming off a 3-7 season and the departure of several players prior to his arrival, Heupel instilled a strong culture built on trust, accountability and relationships. He combined those pillars with the nation’s top offense and an attacking defense.\n\nIn three seasons, Heupel’s remarkable revival of the Volunteers has seen him produce a 27-12 overall record, eight victories over Top 25 teams, the program’s first New Year’s Six berth in the College Football Playoff era and back-to-back top-20 poll finishes. The eight ranked wins are sixth nationally among FBS head coaches during that span and are the second-most by a UT coach through the first 39 games of a career. Heupel’s .692 winning percentage is the second-highest by a Vol coach in the last five decades. His 27 wins are the third-most by a UT coach through his first three seasons, trailing only Bill Battle (31 from 1970-72) and Phillip Fulmer (29 from 1993-95).\n\nHeupel has guided Tennessee to its winningest two-year stretch (20) since 2003-04, and the 20 victories over that span are tied for the third-most in the SEC. Having to replace much of their offensive firepower in 2023 and in a season filled with key injuries, the Volunteers still won nine games, finished No. 17 in both the Associated Press and AFCA Coaches polls and dominated Big Ten West champion, No. 17 Iowa, 35-0, in the program’s first Citrus Bowl appearance in two decades on New Year’s Day 2024. It marked the Vols’ first shutout victory in a bowl game since beating Texas A&M, 3-0, in the 1957 Gator Bowl. Tennessee was the only SEC program during the 2023 bowl season to shutout an opponent. Three of the Vols’ four losses were versus teams who finished in the top eight of the final polls.\n\nHeupel joined Battle and Fulmer as the only three coaches in program history to lead UT to bowl berths in each of their first three seasons. In 2023, Heupel leaned on a rushing attack that led the SEC and ranked ninth in the FBS, averaging 204.8 yards per game. It was the first time since 1999 that the Vols led the SEC in rushing offense. UT also went over the 2,500-yard rushing mark for the third straight season for the first time in program history. Defensively, the Vols finished in the top 25 nationally in six different categories, including an SEC-best 101 tackles for loss.\n\nHeupel’s Vols entered the 2022 campaign unranked, but they quickly made their mark. A thrilling 34-27 overtime road victory at No. 17 Pittsburgh set the stage for an epic three-game stretch that will forever live in Tennessee lore. With ESPN College Gameday on hand for the first time since 2016, the Vols beat rival Florida, 38-33, before throttling eventual SEC West champion LSU, 40-13, in Baton Rouge on Oct. 8. The victory was Tennessee’s largest in the series since 1940.\n\nESPN College Gameday returned for the second time in four weeks, this time for The Third Saturday in October matchup against Alabama. The Vols took down the No. 3/1 Crimson Tide, 52-49, on Chase McGrath’s 40-yard field goal as time expired that sent off a celebration for the ages with 11.6 million viewers tuning in, which represented the third-most for a college football regular season game all year.\n\nTennessee put up 567 yards of total offense and tallied 52 points—the most allowed by Alabama in a game in the SEC era (since 1933) and the most allowed in any game since surrendering 54 to Sewanee on Oct. 21, 1907. Wide receiver Jalin Hyatt tied an SEC record and set a school mark with five receiving touchdowns, while quarterback Hendon Hooker became a hero, throwing for 385 yards and engineering a two-play drive in the final 14 seconds to set up the game-winner.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Vols donned “Dark Mode” uniforms with black helmets and dominated No. 19/17 Kentucky, 44-6, in ESPN primetime, catapulting UT to an 8-0 start. The rapid start ascended the Vols to No. 1 in the initial College Football Playoff rankings released on Nov. 1, giving UT its first top poll position since the 1998 national championship season. Heupel joined College Football Hall of Famers Phillip Fulmer, Bowden Wyatt and General Robert Neyland to lead the Vols to a No. 1 national ranking all-time.\n\nTennessee secured its first 10-win regular season since 2003 with Heupel becoming just the third Vol coach in the last 60 years to achieve that feat in his first or second season (Bill Battle, Fulmer). Meanwhile, Neyland Stadium returned to glory, drawing six sellouts for the first time since 2007 with the Vols posting an undefeated 7-0 home mark.\n\nHeupel led Tennessee to its first Capital One Orange Bowl appearance in 25 years. With a predominantly pro-UT crowd in attendance at Hard Rock Stadium, the Vols beat ACC champion Clemson, 31-14, to claim its first Orange Bowl trophy since 1939. The triumph gave Tennessee its first 11-win season in over two decades as Heupel became just the fifth coach in school history to reach that mark, joining Fulmer, Johnny Majors, Battle and Neyland. Heupel did it against a brutal schedule that ranked fourth nationally.\n\nThe Vols concluded 2022 No. 6 in both the Associated Press and USA Today AFCA Coaches polls, representing their highest finish since 2001. Tennessee defeated four foes in the final AP Top 25, which was the second-highest total among teams in the final poll. The team finished with six wins over ranked teams, tying the 1998 squad for the most in program history.\n\nFor his efforts, Heupel was tabbed the 2022 AP SEC Coach of the Year and a finalist for the Paul “Bear” Bryant Coach of the Year Award and the George Munger Award presented by the Maxwell Football Club. Heupel was the recipient of the AFCA’s Region 2 Coach of the Year, and he captured the fan vote for the Bryant Coach of the Year Award.\n\nUnder Heupel’s leadership in 2022, the Vols led the nation in scoring offense (46.1), total offense (525.5), passing efficiency (181.4) and total touchdowns (79) for the first time in school history. UT was also tops in the SEC in tackles for loss per game (7.2), while ranking second in the league in rushing defense (115.8).\n\nA year after breaking eight team single-season records, Tennessee shattered 15 program marks during the 2022 campaign. Heupel’s offensive unit rewrote the annals in total points (599), points per game, total offense (6,832), total offense per game, yards per play (7.2), total touchdowns, passing touchdowns (38), rushing touchdowns (40), completion percentage (68.7), passing efficiency, passing yards (4,239), fewest interceptions thrown (3) and first downs (330).\n\nPlayer development has been evident in the Heupel era. Thirteen Vols have been selected in the last three NFL Drafts combined, which is the highest three-year span of picks for UT in nearly two decades. Under Heupel, Tennessee is one of just two programs in the last five years with a quarterback selected in back-to-back drafts as Joe Milton III went in the 2024 sixth round to the New England Patriots. Also in 2024, Wright was chosen in the third round (Miami Dolphins) and cornerback Kamal Hadden went in the sixth round (Kansas City Chiefs).\n\nThe 2023 NFL Draft saw Tennessee produce five selections through the first three rounds, representing the second-most in the nation. Four of those five came on the offensive side of the ball. The four offensive picks through the first three rounds tied for the most in the country.\n\nDarnell Wright was the highest drafted offensive lineman in the SEC and second highest overall going No. 10 to the Chicago Bears in the 2023 first round. Hooker (Detroit Lions), Hyatt (New York Giants), wide receiver Cedric Tillman (Cleveland Browns) and edge rusher Byron Young (Los Angeles Rams) were all chosen in the third round. Tennessee was the only program in the nation with multiple wide receivers selected through the first three rounds of the 2023 NFL Draft.\n\nIn 2022, defensive back Alontae Taylor was selected in the second round (New Orleans Saints), and Velus Jones Jr. went in the third round (Chicago Bears). Defensive lineman Matthew Butler went off the board in the fifth round (Las Vegas Raiders), offensive lineman Cade Mays was tabbed in the sixth round (Carolina Panthers), and defensive back Theo Jackson went to his hometown Tennessee Titans in the sixth round.\n\nHeupel mentored Hooker, who swept the 2022 SEC Offensive Player of the Year awards as selected by the coaches and Associated Press. He compiled 3,565 yards of total offense and 32 total touchdowns, while finishing second in the nation in passing efficiency (175.51). The signal caller shattered school records in passing efficiency, consecutive games with a touchdown pass (20) and single-season completion percentage (69.6).\n\nHooker secured the highest Heisman Trophy finish by a Vol in 25 years with fifth place, and he was a finalist for the Walter Camp Player of the Year, the Maxwell Award and the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award. Meanwhile, Hyatt became the first player in school history to claim the Biletnikoff Award as the nation’s top receiver in 2022. He earned the prestigious honor of becoming the 13th unanimous first-team All-American in UT history and the first since College Football Hall of Famer Eric Berry in 2009. Hyatt broke the school record for single-season receiving touchdowns with 15, a mark that led all Power Five players.\n\nA total of 10 Vols have earned All-SEC honors under Heupel’s watch, including a 2023 season that saw defensive end James Pearce Jr., center Cooper Mays and running back Jaylen Wright receive laurels. Wright capped his career becoming the first 1,000-yard rusher for the Vols since 2015, and he did it quicker than any player in school history. His 7.39 yards per carry led all FBS running backs in 2023. Four Tennessee players earned first-team All-SEC recognition from the league’s coaches in the fall of 2022—Hyatt, Hooker, Wright and Young. The four selections were the most for the program since 2006.\n\nHeupel’s revival of the Vols began in 2021. Picked to finish fifth in the SEC East, Heupel guided Tennessee to a 7-6 first-year campaign, including a 4-4 mark in conference play to take third place in the division. The Vols beat six teams by at least 24 points, and Heupel became just the fifth UT head coach in the last 80 years to win seven or more games in his debut season.\n\nOf the eight first-year Power Five head coaches in 2021, no coach won more regular season games than Heupel. That feat came against a schedule ranked among the top five in college football according to the ESPN FPI.\n\nFor his efforts, Heupel was tabbed by the Football Writers Association of America as the Steve Spurrier First-Year Coach Award winner for the second time in his career. He was the first coach to win the honor multiple times since its inception. Tennessee earned a Music City Bowl appearance, and Heupel became the fifth Vol coach in the last 70 years to lead the Vols to a bowl in his debut season.\n\nUnder his leadership, Tennessee’s offense enjoyed the most significant improvement of any FBS team. The Vols jumped 99 spots in scoring offense in the FBS rankings, going from 108th in the country in 2020 to seventh in 2021, while averaging 39.3 points per game, a mark that ranked second in modern school history. Tennessee also leaped 93 spots in total offense, averaging a stellar 474.9 yards per game, which ranked ninth in the FBS.\n\nHeupel quickly developed Hooker into one of the nation's most complete quarterbacks. In his first season, Hooker led the SEC and ranked third nationally in passing efficiency en route to being a semifinalist for the Davey O'Brien Award, Tennessee’s first since 2006.\n\nThe Vols’ on-field success has correlated in the classroom as Tennessee has shattered the program record for GPA in three consecutive fall semesters under Heupel. The fall of 2023 saw the Vols produce a program-record 63 SEC Academic Honor Roll recipients, representing the second-most in the SEC.\n\nA total of 133 UT players have garnered SEC Academic Honor Roll accolades in three seasons under Heupel, and the program produced two College Sports Communicators (CSC) Academic All-Americans in 2021 with specialist Paxton Brooks and Butler earning first and second team distinctions, respectively. Brooks repeated the honor in 2022.\n\nHeupel emphasized the holistic development of the student-athlete and enhanced the team's player development staff. The group focuses on year-round programming geared toward preparing the Vols for personal, academic and leadership success, as well as community engagement efforts.\n\nHeupel’s trust and personality have flourished in recruiting as well. Despite the many obstacles he inherited, he assembled back-to-back elite signing classes and proved that transfers could become instant impact players in his system. His top-10 Class of 2023 featured three of the top 50 signees in the country according to On3.com, including the nation’s No. 1 player in quarterback Nico Iamaleava of Long Beach, California. Iamaleava capped his true freshman season earning 2024 Citrus Bowl MVP honors in his first career start.\n\nKnight Lights\n\nHeupel’s arrival in Knoxville came after a triumphant three-year head coaching stretch at UCF, an era that saw the Knights reaffirm themselves as one of college football’s most exciting teams. UCF owned a 28-8 overall record and an outstanding 20-5 mark in conference games under his watch, while shattering a program record for NFL Draft picks.\n\nHeupel was the architect of a unit that ranked in the FBS top 10 in points per game in each of his three seasons—eighth in 2020 (42.2), fifth in 2019 (43.4) and sixth in 2018 (43.2). The Knights also ranked in the top five in the FBS in total offense per game in each of those three seasons—second in 2020 (568.1), second in 2019 (540.5) and fourth in 2018 (522.7).\n\nUnder Heupel's watch, UCF was the only team in the FBS to rank among the top five in total offense in each of those three seasons (2018-20), and the Knights were the only program in the nation to average at least 522.7 yards of total offense in each of those years as well. UCF joined Alabama as the only teams to rank among the top eight in the country in passing in each of his last two seasons (2019-20).\n\nHeupel was tabbed as head coach at UCF in December 2017 by White and promptly became one of only three coaches in college football history to lead a team to an undefeated regular season in his first year with them (Chris Petersen at Boise State in 2003 and Larry Coker at Miami in 2001 also accomplished that feat).\n\nIn 2018, his squad posted a 12-1 overall record and an 11-0 regular season mark en route to capturing the American Athletic Conference championship and a berth in the Fiesta Bowl. He led UCF to as high as seventh in both the Associated Press Top 25 and Amway Coaches poll, marking the highest regular-season rankings in program history. The Knights finished the year ranked No. 11 in the AP and No. 12 in the Coaches’ poll.\n\nAs a result, Heupel won the Steve Spurrier First-Year Coach Award, and he was a finalist for the Associated Press National Coach of the Year Award, the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Coach of the Year Award and the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year Award.\n\nPreaching a 1-0 mentality every week, Heupel’s up-tempo 2018 offense posted 43.2 points per game that ranked sixth in the nation with an average margin of victory of 20.5 points. The Knights’ ground game set a program single-season record with 3,448 yards that same season as UCF averaged 265.2 yards rushing per game, which was eighth in the country.\n\nRunning back Greg McCrae in 2018 became UCF’s first 1,000-yard rusher since 2013 with 1,182 yards on the ground, fourth most in program history. The passing attack in 2018 was one of the best in the nation behind quarterbacks McKenzie Milton and Darriel Mack Jr. UCF averaged 257.5 yards per game and 29 touchdowns that year, including 14.94 yards per completion, which was the ninth-best mark in the country. The quarterbacks posted the 21st-best passing efficiency mark of 149.71, while throwing just seven interceptions, representing the fewest by a UCF team in program history.\n\nNot to be outdone, the UCF defense provided an outstanding 2018 campaign. The Knights allowed just 22.7 points per game and ranked sixth in the nation with 28 forced turnovers on the year. UCF racked up 8.2 tackles for loss per game, fifth most in the nation, and had 29 sacks.\n\nUCF’s success continued in Heupel’s second season as the Knights produced a 10-3 overall record, culminating with a 48-25 blowout victory over Marshall in the 2019 Gasparilla Bowl. UCF finished the season ranked No. 24 in both the Associated Press Top 25 and Amway Coaches polls. The Knights also produced a perfect home-field record for the second straight year.\n\nIn 2019, UCF averaged 43.4 points per game, good for fifth in the FBS, and won their games by an average of 20.4 points. The Knights owned the fewest turnovers (15) of any team in the AAC that same year. True freshman signal-caller Dillon Gabriel produced a 29-to-seven touchdown pass-to-interception ratio, threw for 3,653 yards (13th nationally), averaged 15.48 yards per completion (fourth in the nation) and rated 13th in efficiency at 156.9 under Heupel’s guidance.\n\nUCF’s 2019 defense led the nation in tackles for loss at 9.0 per game while permitting only 23.0 points. The Knights also ranked fifth in the country in third-down defense (.293 conversion rate) and third in pass efficiency defense.\n\nDespite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, UCF set all-time single-season program per game records for total offense (568.1) and passing yards (357.4) in 2020 while earning a berth in the Boca Raton Bowl.\n\nOn the defensive side, Heupel’s squad led the FBS in recovered fumbles in 2020 with 13, while ranking sixth in total turnovers forced (22). The Knights also ranked 28th in tackles for loss (7.1 per game) and 38th in sacks (2.6).\n\nHeupel’s track record of developing NFL talent was clear at UCF. A program-record five Knights were selected in the 2021 NFL Draft, shattering the previous mark of four in 2003 and 2018. That tally ranked 11th among all programs nationally and was equal to or better than nine SEC teams.\n\nGrant went 40th overall to the Atlanta Falcons in the second round, while Aaron Robinson was picked 71st overall by the New York Giants in the third round. In addition, Jacob Harris was tabbed 141st to the Los Angeles Rams in the fourth round, Tay Gowan was taken 223rd overall by the Arizona Cardinals in the sixth round, and Tre Nixon went 242nd overall to the New England Patriots in the seventh round.\n\nThis came a year after wide receiver Gabriel Davis was selected in the fourth round of the 2020 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills. Davis has become one of the league’s premier playmakers. In a 2021 NFL playoff divisional round game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Davis logged a career-high 201 receiving yards on eight catches and scored an NFL-record four receiving touchdowns. He became just the ninth player in NFL history to record 200+ receiving yards in a playoff game.\n\nOff the field, Heupel’s programs were equally impressive. The Knights had 43 players selected to the 2018-19 AAC All-Academic Team. UCF also won a 2019 NCAA Academic Progress Rate Public Recognition Award as its four-year 984 APR figure for football ranked it among the top 10 percent of schools in that sport.\n\nSEC Impact\n\nHeupel was no stranger to putting up big offensive numbers in the SEC. Prior to his successful run at UCF, he served as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Missouri from 2016-17.\n\nIn 2015, prior to Heupel's arrival, Missouri ranked 124th in the nation in total offense (280.9). In Heupel’s first season of 2016, the Tigers led the SEC and ranked 13th nationally, averaging 500.5 yards per game. In 2017, Mizzou ranked eighth in the nation in total offense, averaging 502.2 yards per game. The Tigers were also 14th in the nation in scoring at 37.5 points per game.\n\nMizzou quarterback Drew Lock shined under Heupel's tutelage. Lock led the SEC in passing as a sophomore, throwing for 3,399 yards and 23 touchdowns. He followed that with an even stronger junior season in 2017, passing for 3,964 yards and a then-SEC record and nation-leading 44 touchdown tosses. Lock was selected by the Denver Broncos in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft.\n\nHeupel’s final season in Columbia saw the Tigers reel off six straight victories to close the season and earn a berth in the Texas Bowl. Mizzou won four SEC games highlighted by a 45-point performance by Heupel’s offense in a triumph over Florida.\n\nSooner Success\n\nHeupel began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at his alma mater of Oklahoma. He was on a coaching staff that reached back-to-back national championship games during the 2003 and 2004 seasons.\n\nHeupel helped mentor Jason White to the Heisman Trophy in 2003. White threw for 3,744 yards and 40 touchdowns with just eight interceptions as the Sooners rolled to an undefeated regular season and a BCS title game berth in 2003. He was the Associated Press Player of the Year, a unanimous All-American, the consensus Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year and the Davey O’Brien Award winner. In 2004, White left Oklahoma as its all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns.\n\nHeupel spent the 2005 season as tight ends coach at Arizona before heading back to Oklahoma as a full-time assistant. He returned to his alma mater for the 2006 campaign and coached the quarterbacks for five seasons. Under Heupel’s tutelage in 2008, Sam Bradford won the Heisman Trophy, Davey O’Brien and Sammy Baugh Awards. Bradford led the nation in passing efficiency that season, and the Sooners tallied an NCAA record five straight 60-point games.\n\nHeupel was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2011 and served in that role for four seasons. His 2011 offense ranked fourth in the nation in total offense (512.3) and passing offense (349.4). The 2012 unit ranked fifth in the nation in passing (336.8) and 12th in total offense (498.6). In his final season with OU, the Sooners ranked second in the nation in fewest sacks allowed (9) and led the Big 12 and ranked 11th in the nation in rushing (261.2), as well as finishing 21st in the nation in scoring (36.4) and 23rd in total offense (464.7).\n\nFollowing his time at Oklahoma, Heupel served as assistant head coach, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Utah State in 2015. Despite the loss of its starting quarterback to injury, Heupel’s unit improved from 81st nationally to 60th in scoring offense.\n\nNational Champion Quarterback\n\nHeupel was a national championship-winning quarterback at Oklahoma. He was runner-up for the Heisman Trophy in 2000, leading the Sooners to a victory over Florida State in the 2001 BCS National Championship Game Orange Bowl and a Big 12 Conference championship. With 1,552 votes, Heupel finished ahead of the likes of Purdue’s Drew Brees, TCU’s LaDainian Tomlinson and Virginia Tech’s Michael Vick in the Heisman poll. A consensus All-American in 2000, Heupel captured the Associated Press Player of the Year and Walter Camp Award.\n\nDuring his two seasons as the starting quarterback at Oklahoma from 1999-2000, Heupel posted a 20-5 record. He passed for 7,456 yards and 53 touchdowns. Overall, he still ranks among OU’s top five quarterbacks in passing yards (fifth), completions (third) and touchdown passes (fifth), despite playing just two seasons.\n\nHeupel forged his path to major college football as a junior college All-America performer at Snow College in Utah in 1998, throwing for 2,308 yards and 28 scores. He was inducted into the school’s athletic hall of fame in 2014. Prior to that, he played his 1997 freshman season at Weber State.\n\nHeupel was selected with the No. 177 overall pick in the sixth round of the 2001 NFL Draft by the Miami Dolphins. He was recruited to Oklahoma by the late Mike Leach, who coached him in 1999.\n\nHeupel appeared on the College Football Hall of Fame ballot for the fifth straight year in 2025.\n\nFamily\n\nAn Aberdeen, South Dakota, native, Heupel earned his bachelor's degree in business marketing from Oklahoma in 2001.\n\nHeupel played high school football at Aberdeen Central, leading his team to a state quarterfinals appearance in 1995. He grew up watching film with his father Ken, who served as head coach of Division II Northern State University for seven seasons.\n\nHe and his wife, Dawn, have two children—daughter Hannah and son Jace.\n\nWHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT JOSH HEUPEL ...\n\n“From day one, Coach Heupel came in with the attitude of we want to win ball games. He has an aggressive mindset to just go out there and dominate. Him bringing that competitive approach to the team, as well as being a great listener has been invaluable. He understands what the team needs in every aspect, not just in the building but in life as well. You never know what some of the players are going through. He’s very appealing to every player and very down to Earth. I think he’s the best coach in America.”\n\n- Hendon Hooker, 2022 SEC Offensive Player of the Year and National Player of the Year finalist\n\n“Coach Heupel played a huge role in my development both on and off the field. His knowledge of the game helped me become the player I am today. He taught me principles that I still apply today in the NFL. He is competitive, driven and always looks out for his players. Tennessee players will thrive in the fun culture he creates.”\n\n- Drew Lock, New York Giants QB and 2019 NFL Draft Pick\n\n“Coach Heupel will be a tremendous leader for the University of Tennessee football team. He is one of the best coaches I have ever been around. His knowledge and ability to teach are second to none. He was absolutely critical in my development as a quarterback. Tennessee players will absolutely love playing for him.”\n\n- Sam Bradford, 2008 Heisman Trophy Winner, Nine-Year NFL Quarterback, No. 1 NFL Draft Pick in 2010\n\n“This dude (Josh Heupel) goes in there and with a new AD in Danny White, and these boys are creating a little bit of a buzz. … They have become a fun team to watch. They are going to recruit very well. Tennessee has become a stock that is going up.”\n\n- Kirk Herbstreit, ESPN\n\n“Tennessee prepared me a lot for the league -- the way we practiced, from an accountability standpoint and from a leadership standpoint. Coach Heupel practices like NFL teams. His motto is ‘we are going to be the fastest, freshest team on Saturday.’ Him moving me to the slot, for him to get the ball in my hands any type of way, that’s what they did by moving me to the slot. It showed how productive I am when the ball is touching my hands. It opened things up a lot. In his offense, you feel free and comfortable to make plays as a receiver.”\n\n- Velus Jones Jr., 2022 NFL Draft Third Round Pick and 2021 SEC Co-Special Teams Player of the Year\n\n“I think Josh Heupel today is the most innovative and creative offensive mind in college football. You saw that Saturday. You tell me — I thought I was watching (Patrick) Mahomes and (Josh) Allen last year in the playoffs. Eighteen seconds in college (to score). That's unheard of, what they manufactured. That was brilliant. That was unlike anything I've ever seen in college football in a generation.”\n\n- Paul Finebaum, SEC Network on 2022 victory over Alabama\n\n“The quick work Danny White and Josh Heupel have done—it is a validation of new leadership and new thinking and also a validation that Josh Heupel is a big time SEC coach and Tennessee is on the right trajectory after being on the wrong trajectory for about 15 years.”\n\n- Pete Thamel, ESPN College GameDay\n\n“Coach Heupel has great expectations of his team, and he is great at delivering the message. When he walks into the room, the expectations are delivered. He is very articulate and he lets them know exactly how they are going to do things.”\n\n- Takeo Spikes, SEC Network"
