        "text": "Doug Groves\n\nBuild commemorative 40th anniversary Gathering hobbles with Doug Groves. A skilled teacher and highly respected rawhide braider, Doug started braiding out of necessity, making the gear he used every day as a working cowboy. Once again, he and his friends will share their know-how in this four-day workshop. Learn Doug’s techniques for processing rawhide—from hide harvest to finished string. And, add specially engraved silver to your project. The storytelling, camaraderie, and cooperative learning among fellow braiders makes this workshop a veritable celebration of rawhide and community! For beginning and intermediate experience levels.\n\nPhoto by Marla Aufmuth\n\nMark Barcus\n\nMake a pair of teardrop-style floral spur straps adorned with a simple carving with Cow Camp Saddlery’s Mark Barcus. Under Mark’s instruction, you will learn how to lay out and place your design, how to use the tools, how to carve the design, and how to apply a simple oiled finish. At the end of the class, you will leave with well-made single-ply spur straps. Take home a wearable, working piece of art custom carved at the 40th Gathering! For intermediate and advanced students.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nDarrell Holden, Terry Nash, Ed Peekeekoot, M.L. Smoker\n\nThe Gathering has always been about words—words that reflect land, words that reflect work, words that reflect our worlds. And it’s about how those words are shared in the company of others, turning moments into memories and expression into connection. Start the 40th with a quartet of rooted performers who will make you sing, laugh, think, and feel. Their timing is impeccable. Their insight is eye-opening. And their words have heart. Join reflective rancher Darrell Holden, compelling cowman Terry Nash, skilled songster Ed Peekeekoot, and thoughtful poet M.L. Smoker as they reflect what’s at the heart of the Gathering.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nJonelle Nutting\n\nCreate a one-of-a-kind stamped leather valet tray for that special someone (or yourself). Ranch wife, mother, and leatherworker Jonelle Nutting will take you through the process of prepping and casing the leather, laying out the design, and stamping. Then, you’ll finish the leather with oil and antiquing, if desired. You’ll complete your creation by finishing the edges and applying hardware. Each student will leave with a fully stamped and functioning tray to corral your keys, coins, jewelry, guitar picks, or any stray treasures and trinkets. You will be provided with a set of tools for the workshop and to take home with you. No experience necessary.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Jonelle Nutting\n\nWaddie Mitchell\n\nCowboy poetry consists of two different arts, the writing of it and the telling of it. While some poems are crafted for the page, others are destined for the ear. The cowboy poetry resurgence that came along 40 years ago emphasized recitation, tapping into oral performance (and aural delight!) through the spoken sharing of verse. The better a poem is presented, the better listeners enjoy it. Join reciter extraordinaire Waddie Mitchell to mull over ideas to help you refine your recitations, improve your delivery, and have some fun with the art of sharing cowboy poetry live and in person.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Waddie Mitchell\n\nDan & Lauren Landa\n\nFather and daughter duo Dan Landa and Lauren Landa share their spin on this staple bread of cowboys and townies alike. Learn traditional sourdough bread recipes and techniques that will keep you “sourdough slim.” Then, add some more techniques to your bread-baking saddlebags with sourdough takes on artistic loaves, sweets, and snacks. This workshop will give you just the start you need to rise to the rest of the Gathering.\n\nPhoto by Lauren Landa\n\nRodney Mike\n\nMake not one but two(!) cuff bracelets in this creative jewelry workshop. Silversmith Rodney Mike of the Duckwater Shoshone Tribe will teach you about materials, tools, and finishes. You will start out by making a copper cuff bracelet with a simple finishing process. This will get you in the groove to make your cuff bracelet out of a sterling silver overlay material on day two. Choose between four finishes for your silver bracelet—a smooth polish, satin polish, hammered texture finish, or a combination of these. Suitable for beginners.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Rodney Mike\n\nYvonne Hollenbeck\n\nLearn the age-old basics of hand piecing from master quilter Yvonne Hollenbeck and discover how simple and relaxing this sewing method can be. Yvonne will guide you through various needles, threads, and notions used in constructing quilts. You will receive a kit to make a simple nine-patch block with printed instructions, and you will also receive hints to assist you with your hand work, whether you are attaching binding, making simple blocks, or attempting to make an award-winning heirloom quilt. Be part of the quilting circle at this rewarding and fun-filled workshop doing patchwork as it’s been done for generations.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nJordan Wright\n\nTake a trip to the southern hemisphere with home cook Jordan Wright whose culinary journey through his Basque roots gives his food global flavors, from the high desert to the pampas. Jordan will guide you through preparing a hearty Argentine lunch worthy of gourmet gauchos. Make matambre (flank steak rolled with seasonal vegetables and cheese) accompanied by an Argentine-style squash salad topped with chimichurri dressing. While you’re cooking, partake in the time-honored South American tradition of passing a cup of mate (herbal tea) among friends. Finally, wash down your meal with a fernet con coca (fernet with Coke). ¡Qué buena onda!\n\nPhoto by Callie Greenhaw\n\nNick Heguy\n\nThroughout modern history, our obsession with the cocktail has been one of adoration mixed with innovation, weighing creative passion with our capacity for vice. We continue this tradition with an examination of the cocktail’s evolution over the decades and its impact on our own local history. Join us for this year’s installation of Perfect Pour at Duncan LittleCreek. Learn tips and tricks to create your own stunning libations. Take some poetic license on a few classic cocktails, and learn to make some of the DLC’s exclusive signature drinks with Nick Heguy. Must be 21+ with valid ID.\n\nPhoto by Charlie Ekburg\n\nRichard Elloyan, Ross Knox, Deanna Dickinson McCall\n\nFrom the Ruby Mountains to the Owyhee Desert, from the Humboldt River to the Jarbidge Wilderness, from the hot springs to the quakies, Nevada’s expanses leave an imprint on a person’s soul. Cowboy poet Ross Knox earned his stripes on the Great Basin’s big outfits. Rancher and rhymer Deanna Dickinson McCall raised her family on the Silver State’s remote ranges. And, musician Richard Elloyan lives and sings at the edge of Nevada’s dark starry skies. Together, in Elko, they bring you an evening of entertainment that sparkles like a buckaroo’s breath on a sunny winter day.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nElko County CattleWomen\n\nThe Elko County CattleWomen’s meatballs have near-legendary status among Gathering crowds and staff. A favorite hors d'oeuvre at the exhibit reception for many years, and the star players in more than one Gathering memory (who said the chafing dishes blew a fuse in the theater?), the meatballs are finally making their comeback. But this time, you can learn how to make them, and other beefy appetizers, too. Join the ranch ladies to learn Marianne Glaser’s signature mouth-watering, crowd-pleasing, spherical morsels of meaty delight. The secret is in the beef!\n\nPhoto by Charlie Ekburg\n\nJudy Hatch\n\nLearn the basics of cinchmaking and make your very own handmade 17-strand mohair cinch with Judy Hatch, rancher and owner of Hatch Idaho Cinches, LLC. Judy, as a seasoned instructor in the art of cinchmaking, will provide you with mohair, buckles, D rings, looms, and all of the tools you need. You will have the choice between three base colors (natural, gray, sand). Show up empty-handed and go home with a finished cinch! Looms and supplies to continue on your own at home will be available for purchase after the workshop.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Judy Hatch\n\nShane Sutton\n\nJoin retired Elko High School agriculture teacher Shane Sutton on a day trip to beautiful Clover Valley in northeastern Nevada. Under the towering peaks of the south Humboldt Mountains, learn and share with the Dalton Ranch, a generational family ranch focused on commercial cattle and producing high-quality beef. Then, have a barbeque lunch prepared by members of the Wells High School FFA. The last stop on the tour is Lotspeich Family Farms, a unique agricultural operation with a deep family ranching history. Dress warm for winter weather and don’t forget to wear sensible footwear!\n\nPhoto courtesy of Lotspeich Family Farms\n\nJohn Dofflemyer\n\nThe unique places that shape, and often dictate, our livelihoods also have distinctive feelings we've learned to recognize and write about. Adding human characteristics to certain aspects of place, like the trees, rocks, rivers, and mountains, brings them alive in our poetry and prose. Many cultures and native philosophies incorporate animism as a part of their worldview, attributing a spirit, a heart, or a soul to some of these subjects. In this workshop, we will attempt to find a sense of spirituality that is unique to where we live, hopefully enriching the depth and scope of our poetic expression.\n\nPhoto courtesy of John Dofflemyer\n\nWylie Gustafson, Dave Stamey\n\nWith over 200 songs (and 1.5 million downloads) under his belt, it’s a testament to Wylie Gustafson’s character that he’s still buckling up to write more. And with outfits like True West Magazine calling Dave Stamey the greatest cowboy balladeer of all time (ok, ok, they said, “best living western solo musician”), it speaks highly of Dave’s humility that his hat still fits. Learn the western songwriter’s trade from not one, but two!, of the best. Wylie and Dave will cover a range of topics, such as developing good writing habits, co-writing, using eminent domain poems, avoiding clichés, approaching artists with your songs, placing songs in movies or TV, demo choices and recording, and using the western lifestyle and landscape to inspire and motivate.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nYolanda Rosales\n\nLove chiles rellenos (stuffed peppers)? Learn to make this classic Mexican dish with Yolanda Rosales, former Elko restaurant owner and cook. Yolanda learned the art of making chiles rellenos from her mother, following a recipe that has been in her family for generations. Students will learn the joy of constructing chiles rellenos from start to finish, with tips on prepping the chiles, fluffing the egg batter, stuffing with cheese, and frying. Yolanda will also guide you through making two sauces, salsa ranchera (red sauce) and salsa con crema (creamy bell pepper sauce). As the saying goes, “panza llena, corazon contento.”\n\nPhoto by Callie Greenhaw\n\nNick Heguy\n\nThroughout modern history, our obsession with the cocktail has been one of adoration mixed with innovation, weighing creative passion with our capacity for vice.

The Wright family has perfected the art of keeping their crews satisfied and coming back every year. Their secret? Feed them well and feed them everything. So, belly up for the Wright take on branding grub. Jordan Wright and his kitchen crew will serve up a dinner that’ll have you asking for a second helping. No strangers to the sweat of branding season, Sam Platts & the Plainsmen provide songs of work and revelry while you supper up. In the true spirit of brandings, this fancy dinner will be served on paper plates. Grab your Koozie and get in line!\n\nPhoto by Natalie Perez\n\nYvonne Hollenbeck, Dave Stamey, Wylie & the Wild West\n\nWhen you throw together a crew, this is the kind of talent you want. Wylie Gustafson, along with his die-hard band, revs up ranch rhythms with the kind of songs you can’t stop humming. Underneath a seemingly sweet ranch wife surface, poet Yvonne Hollenbeck’s rabble-rousing spirit makes for spirit-rousing poetry. And, cool-as-a-cucumber Dave Stamey stirs up a frenzy when he lets out a yippee-yi-yo. When the “Rebel Rouser” joins forces with the “musical Charlie Russell” and the “American original,” you’ve got a crew that’ll kick up a ruckus and get the job done right. Like any good cowboss, you just need to show up and enjoy yourself.\n\nPhoto by Charlie Ekburg\n\nDW Groethe, Darrell Holden, Betty Lynne McCarthy, Jonathan Odermann, Dick Warwick\n\nFrom the loyal cow dogs who assist us in our daily work to the ornery cows who insist on spicing up our days, critters loom large in our lives. Every rancher has encountered a creature worthy of immortalization in verse…and some worthy of a choice curse. Critters make us laugh and they make us cry. If there’s one thing that unites DW Groethe, Darrell Holden, Betty Lynne McCarthy, Jonathan Odermann, and Dick Warwick, it’s critters. From laughable observations to humorous run-ins, these poets share stories, and snortles, inspired by the non-human occupants that skitter through their days.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nDick Gibford, Ross Knox, Waddie Mitchell, Gail Steiger\n\nWhat’s better than friendship? Pardship, of course! And who knows what could happen when these old-school buckaroo bard pards take our stage to reminisce about the past 40 years through story, poetry, and song. (Hint: It’s going to be epic!) From before the dawn of the Gathering to clean up ’til yesterday, Dick Gibford, Ross Knox, Waddie Mitchell and Gail Steiger have seen and heard a few things, got up to all sorts of shenanigans, and shared more than an adventure or two. If you’ve ever wondered about the Gathering’s early days (or would just like to relive them), this is a show you won’t want to miss.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nDoris Daley, Pipp Gillette & Lloyd Wright, Hot Club of Cowtown, Sourdough Slim & Robert Armstrong\n\nWhether passed down by compadres around a campfire or grandparents around a record player, cowboy schooling has its roots in all kinds of traditions. Pipp Gillette & Lloyd Wright gain inspiration from the folk heroes of music history. Hot Club of Cowtown repurpose the jazzier roots of country swing. Sourdough Slim & Robert Armstrong take on the image of Hollywood’s “singing cowboys.” And, Doris Daley casts a keen eye on how people and pop culture shape even the most bona fide of buckaroos. They’ll entertain you with lore that reveals even the “real deals” sometimes get their inspiration from TV Westerns.\n\nPhoto by Sue Rosoff\n\nMarleen Bussma, Andy Hedges, Bill Lowman, Jake Riley, Tom Sharpe\n\nEverybody loves a classic. And, everybody loves it when reciters take the stage to honor the greats of their field. Join poets Marleen Bussma, Andy Hedges, Bill Lowman, Jake Riley, and Tom Sharpe for their favorite classic cowboy poems. They’ll take turns sharing beloved touchstones of the tradition.They’ll go rounds delivering masterpieces that still seem fresh today. And they’ll bandy rhymes that have stood the test of time. This show has cowboy trimmings and cowboy substance…now, that’s classic!\n\nPhoto by Bob Kisken\n\nMargo Cilker, John Dofflemyer, Trinity Seely, Dave Stamey\n\nWhen it comes to agricultural wealth, the Golden State has its fair share. Whether you love it or love to hate it, this westest of the western states turns out happy cows and happy artists. An abundance of crops and livestock aren’t the only ranchy riches to be found between the Sierra Nevadas and the Pacific Ocean. Among California’s greatest treasures are gold-dusted songwriter Margo Cilker, poetic gem John Dofflemyer, jewel of a singer Trinity Seely, and precious musical resource Dave Stamey. This ain’t no fool’s gold. You’re sure to leave this show shouting, “Eureka! I hit the jackpot!”\n\nPhoto by Marla Aufmuth\n\nDoris Daley, Hot Club of Cowtown, Brigid & Johnny Reedy\n\nIf you’re our type—the kind who is up and at ‘em before the first birds, we’ll see you at this special morning show featuring Doris Daley, Hot Club of Cowtown, and Brigid & Johnny Reedy, with appearances by Waddie Mitchell and other guests. Kick off your Friday right with a chance to participate in a live auction and give in support of the Western Folklife Center’s mission. As a nonprofit, we are committed to keeping tickets affordable and accessible, but ticket revenue only covers a third of all we do. The rest comes from the generous support of folks like you!\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nBob Echeverria\n\nLearn the significance of carving makilak (Basque walking sticks), and make your own, in this educational, hands-on workshop. A prestigious symbol and instrument for both trekking and defense, the traditional makila can take years to make—from the initial cut in a living tree, to the time-consuming curing process, to carving designs and attaching silver tippings. Bob Echeverria will pare it down for you, providing harvested sticks pre-prepped for carving. You’ll also be introduced to other ingenious, practical items that provide the canvas for carving. Never get caught unprepared for downtime in the sheep camp again. Bring your favorite carving tool. All ages welcome.\n\nPhoto by Charlie Ekburg\n\nAmy Mills\n\nIf your toes are tapping but you need some good moves, this is a perfect dance for you. Rodeo swing is the easiest form of swing dancing and the style you'll see at rodeo dances around the West, as well as at Gathering dances. Amy Mills will teach you the moves and keep you smiling. Geared to beginning and intermediate dancers, but all levels are welcome. You don't need a partner to attend.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nDom Flemons\n\nLearn the knack of clacking the bones! Described as the American Songster, Dom Flemons draws on his extensive old-time and folk music knowledge to teach the history and skill behind this popular traditional rhythm-maker. No bones needed—you’ll be provided with your own pair to use in the workshop and to take home with you to practice. All ages welcome.\n\nPhoto by Charlie Ekburg\n\nDave Munsick\n\nWebster defines harmony as “an interweaving of different accounts into a single narrative.” Join Dave Munsick, patriarch of The Munsick Boys, to explore how singing different parts makes a whole. Unison, two-part, three-part, and even four-part structures will be addressed along with ideas that will help you to find your note in a crowd of voices. Whatever your experience level, age, or register, you always have a part in group singing. Let this seasoned singer give you some tips on knowing when, why, and how to go about the business of making one out of many.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Dave Munsick\n\nLone Piñon\n\nGet moving to the music of Lone Piñon, who will teach you a few simple and fun traditional dance steps and figures. Dances like La Camila, la varsoviana, el valse de los paños, la vaquera, and others have been danced in New Mexico weddings and dance halls for centuries. These dances have a deep history in the Spanish-speaking ranching communities of Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado and they are a proven recipe for lots of fun. Earn the rancheros’ respect (or try to!) with these waltzes and figure dances from the Upper Rio Grande Valley. Suitable for all ages.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Lone Piñon\n\nGary & Kurin Haleamau, Kristyn Harris, Wylie & the Wild West\n\nCowboys are no strangers to situations that call for a good yodel. Like most cowboy necessities, yodeling has been elevated into an artform stamped with regionally distinctive touches and performed with range, skill, and showmanship. Montana hollerer Wylie Gustafson will wow you with his mastery of the phrase “little old lady who.” Kristyn Harris carries on in the ilk of “The Queen of the Yodellers” Rosalie Allen. And, Gary & Kurin Haleamau share paniolo yodeling like that that took root when cows took hold of Hawaii. Get ready for a pitch-defying, coyote-crying, lung-frying yodeling extravaganza.\n\nPhoto by Kevin Martini-Fuller\n\nKristyn Harris, Lone Piñon, Annie Mackenzie, Brigid Reedy\n\nCommitting to a tradition and making it your own is a delicate endeavor. These fresh voices tread the grounds of heritage oh-so-skillfully, balancing reverence and mastery with originality and spunk. Kristyn Harris takes classic country, folk, and swing at her own speed. Lone Piñon reverently study with elders to recreate and revamp their region’s musical repertoire. Annie Mackenzie writes original rhymes built on the foundation of classic cowboy poetry and life on the range. And, Brigid Reedy recites the poems of her personal heroes and moves forward the art of cowboy music. By lovingly trodding the hallowed ground of their forebears, they’re breaking ground of their own and proving that everything old is new again.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nJuni Fisher, Pipp Gillette & Lloyd Wright, Andy Hedges, Brenn Hill, Waddie Mitchell, Trinity Seely, Dave Stamey, Gail Steiger\n\nWith more than 40 years of poeting under his belt, cowboy poet icon Waddie Mitchell has penned and performed many a rhyme and verse. Between ranching and hitting the stage, he’s also found time to record a few albums with the friends he's picked up along the way. Enjoy a live performance of Waddie’s album Cohorts & Collaborators featuring Waddie and his partners in songwriting, Juni Fisher, Pipp Gillette & Lloyd Wright, Andy Hedges, Brenn Hill, Trinity Seely, Dave Stamey, and Gail Steiger. From their matchups on this album, to their more recent joint efforts, you’ll be inspired to jot a couple jingles with your pals at this show that celebrates the best of collaborations with the best of collaborators.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nAdrian Brannan, Sterling Drake, Sam Platts & the Plainsmen, Dick Warwick\n\nThe West is not all cows and blue skies. Those cows and blue skies represent opportunity, and some western-made opportunities are more upstanding (and legal) than others. From legendary mischief makers to gritty escapades, take a walk on the darker side of cowboy life. From saloons to dance halls, gambling dens to more notorious establishments, there is a lot of vice, and virtue, lying in wait. So, take a chance and roll the dice with gritty songstress Adrian Brannan, honky-tonking musician Sterling Drake, scoundrel-loving band Sam Platts & the Plainsmen, and folly-finding poet Dick Warwick. Afterall, you are in Nevada.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nBuffalo Kin, Dom Flemons, Andy Hedges, Jessie Veeder\n\nTwo great American musics ride hard across the open range of rural life. Country and blues draw their power from everyday speech, emotional resonance, lived stories, and hard-driving, hard-laboring beats. Both sing with the contributions of Black artists, as does the cowboy trade itself. Join Buffalo Kin, Dom Flemons, Andy Hedges, and Jessie Veeder as they explore the crossroads of these musical styles, from old-timey favorites to contemporary stylings, delivering a bit of blues, a bit of country, a bit of cowboy philosophy. And, one powerful show.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nHot Club of Cowtown\n\nIt’s no big secret that cowboys love to dance. Some show up and show off. Others sidle in and quietly listen. Whatever your style, the Friday night boogie with Hot Club of Cowtown will make you smile. The band revs up the room with their trademark sounds. A bit of bass, a lick of guitar, a little fiddle, and a whole lot of rhythm and groove. Stretch them weary bones, step up to the dancefloor, and swing the night away.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nGary & Kurin Haleamau\n\nKī hōʻalu (to slack or loosen the key) is a genre of guitar music that originated in Hawai’i among paniolos (Hawaiian cowboys). When Mexican vaqueros visited Hawai’i to teach the paniolos how to manage the island's wild cattle, they also taught them to play the guitar. Without traditional knowledge of guitar tuning, nā paniolo loosened the strings to an “open G tuning” and this unique style was born. In this workshop, Gary & Kurin Haleamau will teach the Hawaiian “open G” tuning, similar to bluegrass DGDGBD. Using a Hawaiian song as a foundation, students will also learn finger picking and chord progression, which incorporates playing the top three strings for a bass rhythm.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nAmy Mills\n\nIf you can count to six, you’re ready to master two dance rhythms for the price of one. Glide around the room to the boom-shik-ka of your favorite two-step. This western classic will have you snuggling close to your sweetie. Then, jitterbug your heart out to the jumpier six-count beats. Whether you call it jive, lindy, or swing, this versatile dance lets you romp to western swing and rockabilly, hot jazz and sultry blues. You provide the feet and Amy Mills will show you the moves. Get two-stepping and swinging in time for Saturday’s dance. All levels welcome. No partner necessary.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nJeff Cunningham\n\nDo you feel like you have two left feet? You don’t need elegance, just a willing spirit for this beginner line dancing workshop. Jeff Cunningham will have you kickin’ and stompin’ to the music with simple steps. You will build on these steps to create choreographed movements for different line dances. Jeff is adept at teaching students with little to no experience. He will have you ready to jump in and move with the group at the rodeo, country bar, or any of the many occasions that embrace line dancing. This is an opportunity to learn to dance and get your heart pumping, with or without a partner.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nJuni Fisher, Brenn Hill, Andy Nelson, Kye Rieff, Sandy Seaton Sallee\n\nHorses may be glamorous and flashy, galloping long distances and smoothly jumping barriers to get us where we’re going. But mules, with their fortitude and bullheadedness, take us all the places we’d never get without provisions and patience. Some say horses are smoother, while mules are smarter. Some say horses are more ready, while mules are more steady. We say, sometimes you need a bit of both. Juni Fisher, Brenn Hill, Andy Nelson, Kye Rieff, and Sandy Seaton Sallee, bring you an entertaining, equine-heavy afternoon of music and verse in tribute to mules and horses, and the places they carry us.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nMichael Martin Murphey with Special Guests\n\nJoin Michael Martin Murphey and a bevy of special guests for this live re-recording of Murph’s quintessential album, Cowboy Songs. First released in 1990, Cowboy Songs (Vol. 1) was a 21-track round up of new hits like “Cowboy Logic” and good ol’ classics like “Goodbye Old Paint.” The first cowboy music album to go gold since Marty Robbins, its success spurred the creation of the Warner Western imprint on the Warner Bros label. Love for cowboy music may ebb and flow among mainstream audiences, but Murph—and his Elko audiences—are steadfast admirers, making the Gathering the ideal place to recapture the album. Warm up your clappers and tune up your yappers—you might just hear yourself on the live recording.\n\nPhoto by Marla Aufmuth\n\nSherry Hooper\n\nStep up your line dancing skills and learn some moves you can take home to your local honky-tonk. Sherry Hooper will guide you through more intricate turns and steps, starting with step-by-step instructions, before kicking it up a notch by adding fast-paced music. Sherry’s classes are always lively, fun, and full of line dance favorites like “Kick the Dust Up,” “Aww Naw,” “Flatliner,” “If You’re Going Through Hell,” “Any Man of Mine,” and more. Best suited for students who have some previous dance experience, either line dance or other.Boots not required.\n\nPhoto by Marla Aufmuth\n\nAdrian Brannan, Dick Gibford, Deanna Dickinson McCall, Katie McCall-Owen, Dave & Tris Munsick\n\nLove has lasted a lifetime for these pairs. From the first moment they met, they were bound together. By blood or by love, there’s a special connection that forms between generations. One minute, one begins as a mentor holding a baby. The next, that baby is holding them steady. The roles switch back and forth as they bring each other guidance, mentorship, fresh eyes, and new perspectives. Adrian Brannan& Dick Gibford, Deanna Dickinson McCall & Katie McCall-Owen, and Dave & Tris Munsick honor their lifetimes of shared craft, shared advice, shared admiration, and that greatest gift, shared time together. Join these bonded pairs for an evening of music, poetry, and rapport that’ll hold you close and help you grow.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nDoug Figgs, Yvonne Hollenbeck, Jarle Kvale, Jake Riley, R.P. Smith\n\nMaking a living in agriculture isn’t for the faint of heart. Nor is it for the humorless. Some days the ups and downs happen with the intensity of a bucking bronc buzzed by a bee. To keep cool while the ranch tests your good nature, it helps to find a little humor in the crises. So, cinch up your sunny disposition and join lovelorn troubadour Doug Figgs, witty wordsmith Yvonne Hollenbeck, self-effacing sonneteer Jarle Kvale, playful poet Jake Riley, and genuine jokester R.P. Smith for an evening that will have both your heart and your sides aching with hysterics.\n\nPhoto by Charlie Ekburg\n\nDom Flemons, Ross Knox, Matt Robertson, Trinity Seely, Gail Steiger\n\nIsolated in the vast backcountry for large periods of time, entertainment for cowboys consisted (and still consists) of spinning yarns, crafting poetry, and passing the time in song. These compadres recreate the creative recreation and cultural production of the cattle trail. Dom Flemons provides sustenance around the campfire with his songster lore. Ross Knox drives tradition with his poetic stylings. Matt Robertson wrangles the musical wilds with his bronc scholarship. Trinity Seely keeps the crew in high spirits with her whistling ways. And, Gail Steiger refuses to let a verse straggle behind. They’ll transport you to the space where the oral tradition we know as cowboy poetry began, in the cow camp and along the cow trail.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland\n\nWylie & the Wild West\n\nGet in one last dose of dancing before the 40th comes to a close. Dancers and wallflowers alike can’t resist the supremely danceable sounds of Wylie & the Wild West. So, get on the floor and give it your best spin, shake, and shuffle. If you’re better at busting broncs than busting moves, don’t worry, Wylie’s got enough moves of his own to keep you entertained. This is the place to fling off your troubles, recharge your soul, and store up that Gathering spirit to carry you through the rest of the year. Come one, come all, and close out the 40th with this cowboy ball.\n\nPhoto by Jessica Brandi Lifland"
