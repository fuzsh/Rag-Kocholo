        "text": "Marquis, a cattle feed importer, was set up in Liverpool by Sir Michael Kroyer Kielberg from Denmark. The company began shipping molasses in bulk, using a custom-built 3,000-ton storage tank in Hull.\n\nIn 1925 Kielberg moved to London and renamed his company United Molasses. As he sourced new, low-cost molasses, he needed a longer-range, faster fleet, so launched the Athel Line with 16 vessels. This fleet saw many losses to enemy action during World War II.\n\nIn 1937 Kielberg sold his Liverpool sugar refinery to Tate & Lyle and in return was invited to become a co-investor in the company’s new West Indies raw sugar venture. This was the beginning of a prosperous relationship between the two companies.\n\nKielberg retired in 1953, and ten years later United Molasses was bought by Tate & Lyle.\n\nClement Attlee’s Labour government pursued a policy of nationalisation for key UK industries in 1949 and the British sugar industry (Tate & Lyle), was included in their plan.\n\nA board meeting at Tate & Lyle on February 10th marked the beginning of a fierce campaign to thwart the Government's plans. Mr Cube, a cartoon character drawn by artist Bobby St John Cooper spearheaded the campaign.\n\nMr Cube became a household name, appearing on sugar packets, in the press and even traveling the country with the ‘Speakers’ Team’ made up of Tate & Lyle employees. Mr Cube helped to present the Company's successful case for continued independence.\n\nAlcântara dates back to 1890 when John Peter Hornung began exploring sugar cane production in Mozambique and set up the 'Companhia do Assucar de Mocambique'. Mozambique was a Portuguese colony, so Hornung decided that Lisbon was the right place to build a refinery. ‘Refinaria Colonial’ in Alcântara, was opened in 1909 by King Manuel II and his uncle, Don Afonso and produced around 400 tons a week.\n\nBy 1950, Refinaria Colonial had become Sidul (Sociadade Industrial do Ultramar). Mozambique gained independence in 1975, and in 1980 a new company, Alcântara – Sociedade de Empreendimentos Açucareiros, SA, was formed which owned Sidul, the Lisbon refinery. In 1989 Alcântara bought Sores (Sociedade de Refinadores de Santa Iria, SA) and Sidul and Sores merged to form Alcântara Refinarias Açucares, SA.\n\nThe Sidul refinery closed in 1994 and all production was moved to Santa Iria. Today the refinery continues to make Portugal’s two famous retail sugar brands, Sidul and Sores.\n\nLyle’s Golden Syrup tin design is named by the Guinness World Records as the world’s oldest branding. The green and gold Victorian-style design has hardly changed since first produced in 1885 although the tin was made of strong cardboard during the war when metal was in short supply. Abram Lyle’s strong religious beliefs are the reason why the tin features a quotation from the Bible: \"Out of the strong came forth sweetness\".\n\nIn February 2021 we acquired an 85% shareholding of Chaodee Modified Starch (CMS) Co., Ltd, a well-established tapioca modified food starch manufacturer based in Thailand. The acquisition extends our presence in speciality tapioca-based texturants and establishes a dedicated production facility in the main tapioca region of eastern Thailand. This acquisition enables us to offer a broader range of solutions to meet the need for better tasting and clean label food in categories including dairy, bakery, snacks, noodles, soup, sauces and dressings, as well as expand our manufacturing footprint in the Asia Pacific region."
