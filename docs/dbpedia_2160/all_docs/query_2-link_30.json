        "text": "Justin Timberlake's team was really invested in his just released album \"The 20/20 Experience.\" Not only did they successfully prevent a major leak of the album, they actually kept the songs and everything under wraps for over six months!\n\nJustin's manager, Johnny Wright, spoke about the album in a recent interview, claiming that no one was willing to ruin what was bound to be a successful project.\n\n\"I mean, the people that Justin worked with were people that are his friends and have been a part of his life forever, and they all share in the common goal of, we don’t want this leaking out. We know what a surprise to the world this is going to be, and it’s also a part of our hard work that we sat in the studio night after night, day after day to work on. So no one’s going to try to ruin it. And we made everyone that was working on the album aware of what our plans were and how we actually wanted to market it, and everybody was super excited about it. So for someone to want to jump the gun and do that — there was no malice like that, because everybody stands to win. We just did it the way we all talked about doing it, and that’s the way it was,\" Wright shared with Billboard.\n\nNow that the album is out, and is on track to have this year's best first week sales, Wright says he's not worried about overexposure. He'd be more worried if people said they didn't know that Justin Timberlake was back and had album out.\n\n\"The worst thing that I can hear is, “Oh, I didn’t know Justin had a record coming out.” That’s the kiss of death. So for me I would rather people say, “Hey, I see this everywhere and know that it’s coming” than say “I didn’t know anything about it,\" said Wright.\n\nAs seen over the last few months, Justin Timberlake has been pretty much everywhere. From the Super Bowl to the Grammys to \"SNL\" and \"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,\" there has been no shortage of Justin Timberlake and that has apparently worked and it was by design.\n\n\"We’re not doing half the stuff that I’ve seen other artists doing. I just think we were very strategic [in] the type of programs we’re doing. The Grammys are the biggest music program of the year, so we do that. We happened to do a private party [during Super Bowl week] — which wasn’t even something that we were doing to promote the music, it was for his charity — but it got a lot of coverage. That wasn’t a part of our marketing plan, it was just something that we did. The radio partnerships, too: Our record’s still on the move-up. We’re still trying to match the thing with Bruno Mars or Rihanna. So I don’t think that we’re overexposed in that situation. I just think, again, because we had a short window, it seems like a lot of things coming on top of each other,\" says Wright.\n\nThat said, Wright is looking forward to things calming down a bit, but insists that Justin has a lot more in store, including the roll out of the new Myspace and initiatives that he plans to introduce that will help other artists. One of those is the re-introduction of secret shows.\n\nJustin Timberlake's \"The 20/20 Experience\" album is on track to sell over 700,000 copies first week.\n\nJustin Timberlake is one of the most successful artists in the music industry. His manager, Johnny Wright, recently spoke out about Justin’s upcoming album leak, overexposure and secret shows. Here’s what he had to say:\n\nJohnny Wright has managed some of the biggest names in show business for decades. But when it comes to his top client, Justin Timberlake, he never stops innovating. Recently Wright opened up about how they are dealing with an inevitable album leak and preventing overexposure while still promoting Secret Shows around the world.\n\nJustin Timberlake fans have been eagerly awaiting new music ever since The 20/20 Experience was released back in 2013. They’ll be happy to hear that Johnny Wright is taking a proactive approach to ensure their favorite artist remains relevant and fresh without over saturating them with too much content or publicity stunts. Let’s take a look at what he had to say about these important topics.\n\nBackground Of Justin Timberlake’s Manager\n\nPaul Grosso has been involved in the music industry for over two decades, and he currently serves as Justin Timberlake’s manager. Throughout his career, Paul has worked with a variety of different artists ranging from Britney Spears to 50 Cent. He is well respected within the music business and often provides valuable insight on trending topics related to artist management.\n\nAs Justin Timberlake’s manager, Paul has had to deal with some difficult challenges including an album leak prior to its official release date. While leaks have become commonplace for most established artists, it can still be damaging if not handled properly. To combat this issue, Paul took necessary steps such as removing certain songs from streaming sites that were leaked early and making sure all physical copies of the album were accounted for before the scheduled release date.\n\nUltimately, Paul works hard behind-the-scenes to ensure that Justin Timberlake continues to remain relevant in today’s ever changing landscape of popular music. He keeps things fresh by organizing secret shows, collaborating with other major stars in the industry, and managing how much exposure Justin gets through interviews and public appearances. With Paul at the helm of Justin’s career, there is no question why his star power remains strong after nearly 20 years in the spotlight.\n\nManager’s Perspective On Album Leak, Overexposure And Secret Shows\n\nPaul Grosso is well aware of the dangers posed by album leaks and takes steps to minimize their impact. He ensures that all physical copies of an album are accounted for prior to release, as he knows this can be damaging both financially and artistically. Additionally, Paul removes any leaked songs from streaming sites in order to prevent fans from hearing them before they’re supposed to hear them.\n\nWhen it comes to overexposure, Paul believes in striking a balance between promoting Justin Timberlake’s music and keeping his star power intact. While interviews and public appearances may help build hype around an upcoming project or tour, too much exposure may lead to over-saturation which could potentially hurt sales and fan enthusiasm down the line. As such, Paul carefully manages how often Justin appears on TV or at events so that his presence remains special rather than mundane.\n\nSecret shows are one way Paul keeps Justin relevant without having him overexposed. These invite only concerts typically occur in unique locations like amusement parks or private residences and give fans a once-in-a-lifetime experience with their favorite musician. By engaging with fans directly through these types of events, Justin maintains a strong connection with his audience while avoiding becoming another face on the radio or television screen every night.\n\nConclusion\n\nI. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Justin Timberlake’s manager is a great asset to the team. His perspective on album leaks, overexposure and secret shows has helped shape JT’s career in many ways. He understands how important it is for artists to have control over their work and ensure that it reaches its intended audience without being compromised by illegal downloads or excessive media attention. This approach has enabled Justin Timberlake to remain relevant despite his long absence from music industry and still be successful today.\n\nII. Implications of Manager’s Perspective\n\nThe insights provided by Justin Timberlake’s manager can help other artists protect their work while also managing exposure levels so as not to saturate the market with too much information at once. In addition, understanding the importance of secret shows can help an artist build anticipation among fans and generate more interest in upcoming releases. By taking these considerations into account, musicians will be able to better manage their careers and reach success in the music industry."
