        "text": "Now it’s Merck who's bringing sexy back, thanks to the Hipgnosis acquisition of the song catalog of Justin Timberlake.\n\nHipgnosis has acquired 100% of Timberlake’s copyright, ownership and financial interests of the writer and publisher’s share of public performance income and the catalog of musical compositions written by Timberlake. Also included, come 2025, are the worldwide administration rights to the compositions, subject to the remaining term of Universal Music Publishing Group’s administration rights.\n\nTimberlake co-wrote every song on his five solo albums, including the hits “Cry Me a River,” “Rock Your Body,” “SexyBack,” “What Goes Around... Comes Around” and “Suit & Tie.”\n\nThe acquisition was made on behalf of Hipgnosis Songs Capital, a partnership between Hipgnosis Song Management and funds managed by Blackstone.\n\nTimberlake is represented by managers Rick Yorn and Josh Dembling at LBI Entertainment and Johnny Wright at Wright Entertainment Group and lawyers David Lande and Mitch Tenzer at Ziffren Brittenham LLP.\n\n“Justin Timberlake is not only one of the most influential artists of the last 20 years but one of the greatest songwriters of all time,” said Mercuriadis, founder and CEO of Hipgnosis Song Management. “Putting this deal together has been a complete labor of love for Justin, Rick, David and me, and I’m delighted to welcome them all to the Hipgnosis family. This is the beginning of what we believe will be an incredible relationship important to us all.”"
