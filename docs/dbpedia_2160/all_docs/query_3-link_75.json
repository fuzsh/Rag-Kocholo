        "text": "On a sunny April afternoon, Bailey Zimmerman is eager to sit down and chat. The velvet couch and city view inside the office of Warner Music Nashville contrast his casual vibe — ripped skinny jeans, a backwards ballcap and a Justin Bieber tour shirt — but he doesn't seem fazed by the glitz. Instead, the 23-year-old singer kicks back and quips, \"I don't even know what we're gonna talk about.\"\n\nWhile his naivety was mostly charming, it was also pretty surprising. Not only was Zimmerman well aware that his debut album was coming out in a month, but he was also well aware that he had the No. 1 song on country radio — for three weeks running.\n\nZimmerman has become one of country's most successful new stars since he went viral on TikTok in 2021, scoring the biggest streaming country debut of all time and the most-streamed all-genre debut in 2022. And that three-week No. 1 — his gritty and gut-wrenching breakup tune \"Rock and a Hard Place\" — has since turned into six weeks, marking one of the biggest runs for a new act in Billboard's Country Airplay chart history.\n\nPerhaps Zimmerman himself put it best in an Instagram post celebrating his first No. 1 hit: \"The last two years of my life have been a movie.\" And he hasn't even released a full album yet.\n\nWith his debut LP, Religiously. The Album., Zimmerman hopes to prove that his remarkable No. 1 streak wasn't just a fluke. He co-wrote 11 of the 16 tracks, and even when he didn't write them, it's clear he has a vision for writing country music with meaning.\n\nThe first two singles from Religiously. The Album. (\"Rock\" and \"Fall In Love\") are prime examples of the raw emotion and arena-rock ambition Zimmerman has to offer. Sure, the LP features some typical country vignettes — taillights fading into the distance (\"Fadeaway,\" \"Other Side of Lettin' Go\"), dead-end streets and dive bar drinks (\"Found Your Love,\" \"Get To Gettin' Gone\") — but it's certainly not cliche.\n\nUltimately, Religiously. The Album. solidifies that Zimmerman's appeal doesn't come from infectious hooks and drinkin' songs — it's his relentless vulnerability and burning passion for love that's connecting. \"I just want to make people feel something,\" he says.\n\nZimmerman never even expected to get out of his hometown of Louisville, Illinois — a blue-collar town of just over 1,000 people, nearly four hours south of Chicago — particularly after landing a coveted spot in the labor union working on a gas pipeline. \"That was gonna be my whole life,\" he says.\n\nHe initially gained a loyal social following through his passion for lifting trucks — a hobby that inadvertently led him to singing. Listening to Black Stone Cherry's \"Stay\" while working on a truck, he decided to record himself singing.\n\n\"I listened back and I was like, 'That kind of sounds like the recording — I'm gonna put it on Snapchat and maybe see if some girls think I can sing,'\" he recalls with a smile.\n\nThough it didn't lead to any romantic connections, Zimmerman's video did spawn the most fateful relationship of them all: that with his go-to songwriting partner, Gavin Lucas. A budding songwriter at the time, Lucas showed Zimmerman the ropes before they wrote \"Never Comin' Home,\" the song that changed everything.\n\nThe morning after posting the song to TikTok in January 2021, Zimmerman's following had doubled, and the video had already racked up nearly 2 million views. Within minutes of seeing the reaction, Zimmerman quit his union job.\n\nThree years prior to \"Never Comin' Home,\" Zimmerman had lost the girl of his dreams — yes, the one who inspired \"Rock and a Hard Place,\" among many of the Religiously tracks — and until that point, \"everything just felt like it was going downhill.\" Once he started writing music, Zimmerman started feeling like there was hope — and once he saw that it could resonate with others, he knew he'd found his path.\n\n\"I had been praying so much. Like, 'Give me something to work hard at, give me something to chase. Give me something to just grind my ass off every day for,'\" he remembers. \"When [that] happened, I was like, 'This is exactly what I've been praying for.'\n\n\"It's the craziest thing to be a part of something that just feels so natural,\" he continues. \"I did not feel natural in my hometown. And now, I feel like I can just be me. And my music can also be that too.\"\n\n\"Crazy\" is a word that comes up often in our conversation, as well as a short-and-sweet phrase that Zimmerman can't help saying almost daily: \"Holy crap.\" His excitement and eagerness is tangible, accented by a genuine disbelief that this is all really happening. (Case in point: When he interviewed with Cody Alan for CMT's Hot 20 Countdown in December, his reaction mirrored what he said at the beginning of our chat: \"This is gonna be on TV? Dude, what?\")\n\nWhen I ask about moments that have felt too surreal to be true, his name-drops are undeniably impressive: \"The first time I met Morg,\" he says, referring to the current king of country, Morgan Wallen (his current tourmate, though, as of press time, the tour was postponed due to Wallen's vocal issues), and \"I smoked a cigarette with Tommy Lee.\"\n\n\"You gotta be somebody doing somethin' pretty badass to talk like we did,\" Zimmerman says of Lee, whom he met when Motley Crüe played in Nashville last year. \"That was a big 'keep working hard' moment.\"\n\nZimmerman recognizes that while the past two years have largely been \"a lot of ups and ups and ups,\" there's also been lots of learning along the way. He knows that he's young and there's plenty of growth ahead, with or without a successful career. But for now, he's taking it all in.\n\n\"I try to take every moment of the day to appreciate what's around me — the team, the people, my fans,\" he says. \"I try to make sure that's in the back of my head all the time: 'These people are the reason you're here. Be nice to everybody, and make sure you're a good person. And call your mom every day, dude.'\"\n\n5 Reasons Why Taylor Swift's Eras Tour Will Be The Most Legendary Of Her Generation\n\nAs the summer quickly approaches, artists from every genre continue to unveil new music for warmer weather. Friday May 10 is particularly packed with anticipated and surprise releases from both emerging talents and established names.\n\nThe new albums alone prove just that: pop songsmith Alec Benjamin's 12 Notes, folk-rock band Judah & the Lion's The Process, regional Mexican stars Grupo Frontera's Jugando a Que No Pasa Nada, and GRAMMY-winning R&B singer Andra Day's Cassandra, to name a few.\n\nMeanwhile, a big, cool glass of major rap releases is here to help wash down the piping hot Kendrick and Drake beef served up over the last week. Full album releases debuted from Gunna, Chief Keef, and Ghostface Killah — the latter featuring guest spots from Nas, Kanye West, Raekwon, Method Man and more. Hottie Megan Thee Stallion's powerful new single, \"BOA\", sets the stage for her Hot Girl Summer tour which officially starts on May 14. New songs from Ice Spice, Kodak Black, NLE Choppa, Coi Leray, G-Eazy, Yung Gravy, Ski Mask the Slump God set the playlist for a weekend full of slappers.\n\nThere's tons of collaborations, too, including the much-teased pairing of Post Malone and Morgan Wallen with \"I Had Some Help,\" a track that showcases Malone's furtherance into country in a catchy, reflective anthem. But country music lovers also have more to enjoy this weekend: Orville Peck's duets project, Stampede Vol.1, features the likes of Willie Nelson and Elton John,\" while Scotty McCreery's Rise & Fall and Avery Anna's single \"Blonde\" fill the fuel tank for a rodeo-ready summer.\n\nBTS's RM delivers another solo track \"Come Back to Me\" and Stray Kids dropped a new collaboration with Charlie Puth, coming fresh off the K-pop group's appearance at the Met Gala earlier this week. And the electronic and rock scenes are not left behind, with A.G. Cook exploring a new twist on Britpop and Sebastian Bach's release of Child Within The Man.\n\nDive into today's releases from Megan Thee Stallion, The Chainsmokers, RM, Stray Kids with Charlie Puth, Camila Cabello with Lil Nas X, Post Malone and Morgan Wallen below.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion, \"BOA\"\n\nMegan Thee Stallion's new single \"BOA\" continues to play up the themes of empowerment and self-realization that define her current musical phase and comes just days ahead of her Hot Girl Summer Tour starting on May 14. The song's cover art features Megan with a striking snake, a recurring symbol of rebirth that has been significant in her recent work, appearing in tracks like the Billboard Hot 100 hit \"Hiss\" and the 2023 song \"Cobra.\"\n\n\"BOA\" is a continuation of Megan's snake-themed narrative, but serves as a saccharine homage to her favorite late-'90s and early 2000s anime and video game classics. The music video features references to Scott Pilgrim, One Piece, Dance Dance Revolution, and iconic 3D fighting games like Mortal Kombat, complete with visuals and Gantz-inspired outfits.\n\nSpeaking to Women's Health about her upcoming summer album, Megan discussed the personal growth and renewal she has experienced, inspiring this new era of music. \"I was inspired to create this album about rebirth because I feel I am becoming a new person physically and mentally,\" she shared.\n\nCamila Cabello & Lil Nas X, \"HE KNOWS\"\n\nCamila Cabello teams up with Lil Nas X for the tantalizing new song \"He Knows,\" delivering a radio-friendly track that's as catchy as it is lustful. The new music mirrors the infectious energy of their recent appearance at FKA Twigs' Met Gala afterparty, where they both were seen dancing the night away behind the DJ booth.\n\n\"He Knows\" serves as a precursor to Cabello's highly anticipated fourth solo album, C,XOXO, — set to drop on June 28 — and teases a glimpse of Cabello's evolving artistic direction. The single follows on the heels of her recent hit \"I LUV IT\" featuring Playboi Carti, part of the reimagining of her sound and artistic brand.\n\nRM, \"Come Back To Me\"\n\nBTS member RM has released a new single, \"Come Back To Me,\" accompanied by a music video. The relaxed track gives fans a taste of his upcoming second solo album, Right Place, Wrong Person, set to release on May 24.\n\nIn the song, RM explores themes of right and wrong, capturing the complex emotions of wanting to explore new avenues while wishing to stay comfortable in the present. \"Come Back To Me\" features contributions from OHHYUK of the South Korean band HYUKOH, and Kuo of the Taiwanese band Sunset Rollercoaster. Additional credits include JNKYRD and San Yawn from Balming Tiger. RM first performed \"Come Back To Me\" during a surprise appearance at BTS bandmate Suga's concert in Seoul last summer, noting it as a favorite from his forthcoming album.\n\nThe music video for \"Come Back To Me\" was written, directed, and produced by Lee Sung Jin, known for his work on the Netflix show \"Beef.\" The video features actress Kim Minha from the Apple TV+ series \"Pachinko\" and faces themes of identity and self-reflection, showing RM confronting different versions of himself. Its cast includes notable Korean and American actors such as Joseph Lee, Lee Sukhyeong, and Kim A Hyun.\n\nPost Malone & Morgan Wallen, \"I Had Some Help\"\n\nPost Malone and Morgan Wallen blend their distinct musical styles in the much-anticipated release of their collaborative single \"I Had Some Help.\" Merging Malone's versatile pop sensibilities while leaning into his country roots with Wallen's, well, help, the duet is a unique crossover that has had fans clamoring to hear more since the two first teased the song earlier this year.\n\nFinally premiering during Wallen's headlining performance at Stagecoach Festival on April 28, the uptempo song explores themes of mutual support and shared experiences, encapsulated by the lyric, \"It ain't like I can make this kind of mess all by myself.\"\n\nThe collaboration has sparked significant buzz and showcases the duo's chemistry and shared knack for storytelling. This single highlights their individual talents as well as their ability to bridge genre divides, already promising to be a hit on the charts and a favorite among fans.\n\nThe Chainsmokers, No Hard Feelings\n\nMaestros of mainstream emotion, The Chainsmokers continue to master the art of turning personal reflections into global anthems with their latest EP, No Hard Feelings. The six-song project see Alex Pall and Drew Taggart exploring the emotional highs and lows of modern relationships, weaving their signature dance beats with pop sensibilities as they have since 2015's \"Roses.\"\n\nThe duo's latest release serves as a soundtrack to both sun-kissed days and introspective nights. The collection includes the single \"Friday,\" a collaboration with Haitian-American singer Fridayy, described by the duo as a direct descendant of \"Roses.\" Other tracks, such as \"Addicted,\" also underscore the Chainsmokers' knack for capturing the zeitgeist of contemporary love and loss.\n\nKings of Leon, Can We Please Have Fun\n\nKings of Leon return with their signature blend of rock and introspection on their ninth studio album, Can We Please Have Fun. The LP finds the band infusing their established sound with fresh, unbridled energy, reminiscent of their early days yet matured by years of experience. The album features standout tracks like \"Mustang\" and \"Nothing To Do,\" which mix playful lyrics with serious musical chops, showcasing Kings of Leon's unique ability to combine rock's raw power with catchy, thoughtful songwriting.\n\nThe band is set to bring Can We Please Have Fun to life on their 2024 world tour, starting in Leeds, United Kingdom on June 20 and wrapping in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on Oct. 5. Fans can expect a high-energy series of performances that blend new tracks with beloved classics, all delivered with the Kings of Leon's legendary fervor.\n\nStray Kids & Charlie Puth, \"Lose My Breath\"\n\nStray Kids have teamed up with Charlie Puth for their latest release, \"Lose My Breath,\" a track that blends K-pop dynamism with Western pop flair, written by Stray Kids' own producer team 3racha (Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han) along with Puth. The TK song details a whirlwind of emotions, describing symptoms of breathlessness and heart-palpitating moments encapsulated in the lyrics: \"I lose my breath when you're walking in/ 'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops.\"\n\n\"Lose My Breath\" is described as a \"warm-up\" for Stray Kids' forthcoming album, set for release this summer. The track further highlights the global appeal of Stray Kids ahead of their highly anticipated headlining set at Lollapalooza in August. It also continues Puth's engagement with K-pop, following his previous work with other K-pop acts including his collab with BTS' Jungkook, \"Left and Right,\" and \"Like That,\" a song he co-wrote for K-pop girl group BABYMONSTER.\n\n15 Must-Hear Albums In May 2024: Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Sia, Zayn & More\n\nEditor's Note: This article was updated on May 20, 2024 with information about Post Malone's collaboration with Morgan Wallen, \"I Had Some Help.\"\n\nSince Post Malone burst onto the mainstream nearly a decade ago, he has continued to flaunt his genre-defying brand of musical brilliance. For his latest venture, it’s time for gold grills and cowboy hats: Posty’s going country.\n\nThough his musical origins are in rap, Malone has seamlessly traversed pop, R&B, and blues, always hinting at his deep-seated country roots along the way. In the last year, his long-standing affinity for country music has moved to the forefront, with appearances at the CMA Awards, a country-tinged Super Bowl LVIII performance, and a feature on Beyoncé’s COWBOY CARTER. Next up, he’ll make his debut at California's Stagecoach Festival alongside some of country music’s biggest names — and pay tribute to some of the genre greats.\n\nWhile it’s unclear exactly what the Texas-raised hitmaker will be singing, his 45-minute set on Saturday, April 27 is labeled “Post Malone: Performs a special set of country covers.” After years of performing covers for and alongside country stars, the performance is arguably one of the most full-circle moments of his career thus far.\n\nAhead of his Stagecoach premiere, read on for some of Posty's biggest nods and contributions to the country music scene over the years — that could culminate in his own country album soon enough.\n\nA Slew Of Classic Country Music Covers\n\nMalone has a history of channeling his musical heroes, often pulling on his boots to deliver heartfelt covers. He's paid tribute to country icons many times, including covers of Hank Williams Jr.'s classic, \"There's A Tear In My Beer” in a 2018 fan-favorite video.\n\nDuring a 2022 Billy Strings tour stop at The Observatory in Los Angeles, Malone made a surprise appearance and used the moment to honor Johnny Cash alongside Strings. The pair delivered an acoustic duet of Cash's infamous murder ballad, \"Cocaine Blues.\"\n\nAnd just this year, Malone covered Hank Williams Sr. during a surprise performance at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. On April 3, he closed out the annual Bobby Bones' Million Dollar Show with a rendition of Williams' \"Honky Tonk Blues.\"\n\nA Longtime Kinship With Dwight Yoakam\n\nMalone has long collaborated with Dwight Yoakam, marking a friendship and professional partnership that spans his career. Yoakam is a GRAMMY-winning trailblazer known for his pioneering blend of honky tonk, rock and punk that shook up the country scene in the 80's with his blend of \"cowpunk.\"\n\nThe pair frequently joined forces on Yoakam's SiriusXM Radio spot \"Greater Bakersfield,\" where one standout 2018 appearance features Malone covering Yoakam's own “Thousand Miles From Nowhere” as the two laugh, strum and belt out the lyrics together in perfect harmony.\n\nOn April Fool's Day in 2021, they playfully teased fans with the prospect of a double country album release — which may not seem so far-fetched three years later.\n\nIt's fitting that Malone would find such deep inspiration in folks like Yoakam, a man who first rode onto the country scene with a new take on a traditional sound. Much like Yoakam bridged generations with his music, Malone brings a new yet familiar energy to the country scene, embodying the spirit of a modern cowboy in both style and sound.\n\nA Country Tribute To Elvis\n\nMalone teamed up with Keith Urban for a duet rendition of \"Baby, What You Want Me to Do\" during the \"Elvis All-Star Tribute Special,\" which aired on NBC in 2019. Originally written and performed by blues musician and songwriter Jimmy Reed, \"Baby, What You Want Me to Do\" was famously covered by Presley and commemorated through Urban and Malone's unique blend of modern guitar-slapping country-rock charisma.\n\nThat wasn't Malone's only country collab that night, either. He also covered Presley's \"Blue Suede Shoes\" alongside Blake Shelton, Little Big Town and Mac Davis.\n\nA Celebration Of Texas With Country Legends\n\nIn March 2021, Matthew McConaughey and his wife, Camila, hosted the \"We’re Texas\" virtual benefit concert, to help Texans coping with that year's disastrous winter storms during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFollowing performances by George Strait, Kacey Musgraves, Willie Nelson, and Miranda Lambert, Malone — who moved to Dallas when he was 10 — served as the night's final entertainer. He performed Brad Paisley's \"I'm Gonna Miss Her\" followed by Sturgill Simpson's \"You Can Have The Crown\" backed by Dwight Yoakam.\n\nA Rousing Tribute At The 2023 CMA Awards\n\nAt the 2023 CMA Awards, Malone joined country stars Morgan Wallen and HARDY on stage to cover late icon Joe Diffie‘s “Pickup Man” and \"John Deere Green.\" Malone's first-ever performance at the CMAs felt more like a reunion than a debut, with Malone right at home among his collaborators.\n\n“I’ve manifested this for years,\" HARDY told Audacy's Katie Neal. \"Slight flex here, but I started following [Post Malone] when he had like, 300k Instagram followers. I was on the 'White Iverson' terrain, like the first thing that he ever put out and I was like, ‘this is dope,’ and I've been with him ever since.”\n\nAfter the performance, Malone hinted to Access Hollywood that it might be the start of a new chapter. When asked if a forthcoming country album would be in the works, he answered, “I think so. Yes, ma'am.” (More on that later.)\n\nA Countrified Appearance At Super Bowl LVIII\n\nBefore Beyoncé announced COWBOY CARTER in a Verizon Super Bowl ad, Malone offered Super Bowl Sunday's first country-themed clue at the top of the night with his tender rendition of \"America The Beautiful.\" Sporting a bolo tie and brown suede, Malone delivered his patriotic performance with a characteristically country drawl while strumming along on acoustic guitar before Reba McIntire's star-spangled rendition of the national anthem.\n\nMalone's performance followed in the footsteps of a long line of country artists who have kicked off the national sporting event, which started with Charley Pride in 1974 and has included Shania Twain, Faith Hill and Garth Brooks.\n\nA Tip Of The Hat To Toby Keith\n\nDuring a performance at the American Rodeo in Arlington, Texas, on March 9, Malone paid tribute to the late Toby Keith, who passed away in February. After pouring one out and taking a sip from a red solo cup (an homage to Keith's playful hit of the same name), Malone performed a cover of \"As Good As I Once Was\" for the Texas rodeo crowd.\n\nHis TikTok video of the performance quickly garnered over 4 million views, sparking enthusiasm among fans for more country music from him. \"Sir. I'm now begging for a country album,\" wrote one user in a comment that has received over 11,000 hearts.\n\nA (Potential) Full-On Country Album\n\nHis much-teased country album may not be too yonder. After confirming that a country album was in the works during a live Twitch stream on his channel, Malone has spent much of this year teasing forthcoming new work. There is no scheduled album release date as of press time, but Malone has shared snippets of new songs including “Missin’ You Like This” and dropped sneak peeks of collaborations with Morgan Wallen, HARDY, Ernest, and Luke Combs.\n\nIn February, Malone posted a sample of a collaboration with Combs, \"I Ain't Got A Guy For That,\" the first in a series of song snippets shared across his social channels.\n\nMalone and Wallen have been teasing a collaboration since the end of 2023. After building plenty of anticipation, they debuted “I Had Some Help” during Wallen's headlining set at Stagecoach in April. Officially releasing the track on May 10, the song didn't just prove to be a banger — it debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, and broke the record for most streams in a single week with 76.4 million official U.S. streams, according to Luminate and Billboard.\n\nNo matter when the album may come, Post Malone’s Stagecoach set will only up the anticipation for some original country music from the star — and from the looks of it, fans and genre stars alike are more than ready for it.\n\n12 Must-See Acts At Stagecoach 2024: Tanner Adell, Charley Crockett & More\n\nIf 2023 wasn't the biggest year ever for mainstream success in country music, it came mighty close.\n\nAcross the three major fronts in the music industry — live concerts, music streams and sales, and chart performance — country music reminded audiences why it's a vital American music form and a conversation starter in our culture.\n\nAccording to Billboard, 48 years have passed since more country artists racked up more No. 1 hits on its all-genre Hot 100 chart. This year saw chart-toppers from record-breaker Morgan Wallen (\"Last Night\"), established hitmaker Jason Aldean (\"Try That in a Small Town\"), viral newcomer Oliver Anthony (\"Rich Men North of Richmond\"), and 2022's big success story, Zach Bryan (\"I Remember Everything\" featuring Kacey Musgraves). Back in 1975, four country artists and five songs reached the Hot 100's summit: Glen Campbell, B.J. Thomas, Freddy Fender, and two cuts by John Denver.\n\nMeanwhile, more than a dozen country artists landed on the Billboard Year-End Top Artists chart, with Wallen and Luke Combs landing in the top five. In addition, Apple Music named Wallen its top global music artist of 2023.\n\nBut enough prelude — let's get down to why the genre has been booming, by tracking the five biggest trends in country music in 2023.\n\nThere Was Massive Crossover\n\nMorgan Wallen pulled country music's biggest crossover on the charts, ending the year with five of the top 50 most streamed songs of 2023 on Spotify, as well as 11 of the top 100 songs on Apple Music (all U.S. charts). He landed eight songs on the year-end Billboard Hot 100, including \"Last Night,\" a tale of whisky-fueled love and regret driven by acoustic guitar and clap-along percussion, which held the top spot for 16 weeks, the most for a non-collaboration song in the chart's 65-year history. It was also the most streamed song on Apple Music globally, contributing to the streaming service naming Wallen its top global music artist of 2023.\n\nZach Bryan became the second artist to place at least 18 songs on the Hot 100 chart in the same week when he dropped his self-titled sophomore album in August — second only to Wallen's record of 36 songs, coinciding with the March release of his double-album One Thing at a Time. Zach Bryan is nominated for Best Country Album at the 2024 GRAMMYs, alongside Kelsea Ballerini's Rolling Up The Welcome Mat, Brothers Osborne's Brothers Osborne, Tyler Childers' Rustin' In The Rain, and Lainey Wilson's Bell Bottom Country. (More on Bryan later.)\n\nThe Hot 100 further indicated the genre's crossover success in early August, when the top three positions were occupied by country songs: Jason Aldean's \"Try That in a Small Town,\" Morgan Wallen's \"Last Night,\" and Luke Combs' cover of Tracy Chapman's 1988 classic. Not only was it the first time in history that country songs dominated the first three spots on the all-genre chart, but it also happened two more times on Aug. 26 and Sept. 2. \"Last Night\" and \"Fast Car\" also received nominations for the 2024 GRAMMYs; \"Last Night\" is nominated for Best Country Song at the 2024 GRAMMYs alongside with Brandy Clark's \"Buried,\" Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves' \"I Remember Everything,\" Tyler Childers' \"In Your Love,\" and Chris Stapleton's \"White Horse,\" while \"Fast Car\" is Best Country Solo Performance alongside \"White Horse,\" \"Buried,\" \"In Your Love.\" and Dolly Parton's \"The Last Thing on My Mind.\"\n\nWhat's more, two of the eight Best New Artist nominees at the 2024 GRAMMYs are country acts, \"Son of a Sinner\" star Jelly Roll and soulful husband-and-wife duo The War and Treaty. They're nominated alongside Gracie Abrams, Fred again.., Ice Spice, Coco Jones, Noah Kahan and Victoria Monét.\n\nLainey Wilson celebrated a banner crossover year both in music and television. Along with parlaying the hit Paramount series \"Yellowstone\" into more exposure for her music, she became the first female artist in history to have four No. 1 hits on country radio in a calendar year thanks to \"Heart Like A Truck,\" \"Wait in the Truck\" with HARDY, \"Watermelon Moonshine\" and \"Save Me\" with Jelly Roll — all of which cracked the top 30 of the all-genre Hot 100.\n\nSeveral Musicians Court Controversy\n\nHistorically, popular country music tends to revolve around themes often imbued with imagery and anecdotes from small-town American life, from love won and lost to simply having a good time. But in 2023, politics infiltrated country music in a more mainstream way than perhaps ever before — even prompting Maren Morris to declare she was leaving country music. \"I thought I'd like to burn it to the ground and start over,\" Morris told the Los Angeles Times in September. \"But it's burning itself down without my help.\"\n\nJason Aldean's single \"Try That in a Small Town\" didn't cause much of a ruckus when it dropped in May, but the promotional video for the song, released in July, certainly kicked a hornet's nest of dissatisfaction. The lyrics begin with a carjacking and a robbery, then confront advocates of gun control and flex how \"good ol' boys, raised up right\" will step up to defend their own. The song \"refers to the feeling of a community that I had growing up,\" Aldean wrote on Twitter, \"where we took care of our neighbors, regardless of differences of background or belief.\"\n\nBut if he was only looking to reboot the s—-kickin' country-boy theme of Hank Williams Jr's 1981 song \"A Country Boy Can Survive,\" he lost the plot with the video. The clip intersperses shots of Aldean and his band performing with footage of riots and destruction reminiscent of the 2020 racial protests sparked by the deaths of Elijah McClain, Breona Taylor, George Floyd and others by police force. And the filming location, the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee — site of the 1927 lynching of an 18-year-old Black man by a white mob — only stoked tensions. The controversy eventually dimmed, but not before the song hit No. 1 on the Hot 100.\n\nJust three days after Aldean's song reached the top, a folk song by an unknown artist with no previous history in the music business hit YouTube and spread like wildfire. \"Rich Men North of Richmond,\" written and performed by Oliver Anthony, sparked a controversy of its own for a handful of lyrics shaming \"obese welfare\" recipients amid righteous blue-collar anger directed at politicians who are out of touch with the working class.\n\nConservative audiences latched onto the song, and it even made an appearance at the Republican presidential debate on August 23, three days before it claimed the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 that Aldean held just a few weeks earlier. In response, Anthony chastised the right-wingers who thought he was one of them, as well as critics on the left whom he felt mischaracterized his words. \"That song is written about the people on that stage — and a lot more, too,\" he said in a 10-minute video posted to YouTube.\n\nCountry Icons Were Saluted\n\nCountry music has seen its share of memorable covers in more recent years, from Johnny Cash's iconic version of Nine Inch Nails' \"Hurt\" to Sturgill Simpson's take on the Nirvana classic \"In Bloom.\" But the practice reached a new peak in 2023 thanks to performances and recordings from present-day and legacy stars alike.\n\nNashville hitmaker Luke Combs channeled his love for Tracy Chapman's 1988 hit \"Fast Car\" into a faithful cover on his 2023 album Gettin' Old. Combs's version reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 (Chapman's original peaked at No. 6) and has been certified double Platinum by the RIAA, in addition to winning both Single of the Year and Song of the Year at the Country Music Association awards—making Chapman the first Black woman to ever win a CMA trophy.\n\nAfter Dolly Parton was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2022, she took her honor quite literally. Parton collaborated with artists ranging from Judas Priest shrieker Rob Halford to Pink and Elton John on 30 recordings, including massive hits like \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" and \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me.\" The album's first single, the original composition \"World On Fire,\" reached No. 1 on Billboard's Rock Digital Song Sales chart.\n\nParton also turned up on A Tribute to The Judds, another star-studded covers album, performing \"Mama He's Crazy\" with Lainey Wilson. Spearheaded by Wynonna Judd in tribute to her mother Naomi, her partner in the duo from 1983 until her death in April 2022, the album brings together some of country music's biggest names on 14 classics from the legendary group. Evergreen it-couple Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton take on \"Love Is Alive,\" while Jelly Roll, K. Michelle and the Fisk Jubilee Singers perform \"Love Can Build a Bridge.\" The album also features Reba McEntire, Carly Pearce, Jennifer Nettles and Gabby Barrett on a rendition of \"Girls Night Out.\"\n\nEven the Rolling Stones dabbled in the country world this year — well, sort of. The 14-song tribute album Stoned Cold Country features Eric Church on a properly sixties-sounding \"Gimme Shelter,\" Elle King on a faithful version of \"Tumbling Dice\" embellished with pedal steel guitar flourishes, and guitar hero Marcus King performing the Sticky Fingers deep cut \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking.\" Elsewhere, Brothers Osborne join The War and Treaty on a particularly soulful recording of \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It),\" and artists like Ashley McBryde, Brooks & Dunn and Maren Morris put their spin on their favorite Stones tunes.\n\nAlt-Country Blew Up\n\nCall it Americana, alt-country, singer/songwriter country — but the subgenre rooted in artists like Gram Parsons, John Prine and Lucinda Williams has evolved from its days as an influential side attraction to a force impacting charts, sales and box office receipts. In 2023, artists from what was once the fringes of mainstream country music showed how much they're really part of the fabric of the genre.\n\nNo artist exemplifies this surge more than Zach Bryan, who parlayed his successes in 2022 into an even bigger 2023, topping the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 albums chart for the first time, and headlining a sold-out arena tour. Folk-pop singer/songwriter Noah Kahan, who joined Bryan for the song \"Sarah's Place\" on Bryan's Boys of Faith EP, also found major success with songs originally performed for his 2022 album Stick Season, including a duet with Kacey Musgraves on \"She Calls Me Back,\" released in October.\n\nThe War and Treaty fuse gospel and soul influences with alt-country on \"Blank Page\" from the 2023 album Lover's Game, which picked up a nomination for the Best American Roots Song GRAMMY (competing against \"California Sober\" by Billy Strings Featuring Willie Nelson, \"Cast Iron Skillet\" by Jason Isbell And The 400 Unit, \"Dear Insecurity\" by Brandy Clark Featuring Brandi Carlile, and \"The Returner\" by Allison Russell). The husband-and-wife duo Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter scored soulful hits with \"That's How Love Is Made,\" as well as their own team-up with Zach Bryan on \"Hey Driver,\" which peaked at No. 14 on the Hot 100 and No. 5 on the Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nThe return of Oklahoma sextet Turnpike Troubadours generated excitement from Texas to Tennessee and beyond, as the band headlined arenas and amphitheaters like Red Rocks in Colorado and L.A.'s Greek Theatre, plus a three-night stand in Boston. Frontman Evan Felker split the fold in 2019 but returned two years later, culminating in the release of A Cat in the Rain, their sixth album for their independent imprint Bossier City Records, in August 2023.\n\nCollaborations Were Abundant\n\nCovers weren't the only way that collaborations flourished in country music this year. In fact, only one nominee in the Best Country Duo/Group Performance category at the 66th GRAMMY Awards is an actual full-time group — that's Brothers Osborne, who is nominated alongside pairings of Dierks Bentley and Billy Strings (\"High Note\"), Zach Bryan and Kacey Musgraves (\"I Remember Everything\"), Vince Gill and Paul Franklin (\"Kissing Your Picture (Is So Cold)\"), Jelly Roll and Lainey Wilson (\"Save Me\"), and Carly Pearce and Chris Stapleton (\"We Don't Fight Anymore\"). That's just how popular artist features have become in country music.\n\nBut those are far from the only artist collaborations that made an impression. Jelly Roll also joined Dustin Lynch on \"Chevrolet,\" while Miranda Lambert and Leon Bridges sang \"If You Were Mine,\" a slow-rolling soul-country single. \"Thank God,\" a duet recorded by Kane Brown and his wife, Katelyn, reached No. 13 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 on Country Airplay, only the second time a duet by a married couple reached the top (after Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's \"It's Your Love\" in 1997).\n\nSuper-producer Diplo leaned into his Mississippi and Florida roots on Diplo Presents Thomas Wesley, Chapter 2 — Swamp Savant, his second collaborations album with country and hip-hop artists; \"Heartbroken,\" an acoustic guitar-driven country-pop song featuring Jessie Murph and Polo G, reached the top 20 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. Murph's own duet with Jelly Roll, \"Wild Ones,\" made its mark on the same chart while notching No. 1 on the iTunes Top 200 Songs chart.\"\n\nCountry music awards shows celebrated the art of the collaboration with viral crossover moments this year as well. Buzzing female country stars Ingrid Andress, Morgan Wade, Lainey Wilson and Madeline Edwards joined Alanis Morissette to perform her '90s alt-rock hit \"You Oughta Know\" at the CMT Awards; Ed Sheeran and Luke Combs dueted on \"Life Goes On\" at the ACMs; and Morgan Wallen, HARDY and Post Malone paid tribute to Joe Diffie at the CMAs by taking on his 1993 hit \"John Deere Green.\"\n\nWill country music continue to surge in 2024? If the chart stats, stadium tours and star-studded collaborations are any indication, it's certainly not slowing down.\n\n5 Female Artists Creating The Future Of Country Music: Jaime Wyatt, Miko Marks & More\n\nCountry music isn't always heralded as a haven for artists who fall outside the genre's accepted mainstream. But 2022 saw country music claim a bigger piece of the cultural pie than it has in recent years.\n\nArtists are discovering new paths to success, driven by the meme-ification of culture and music and templated by stars like Walker Hayes, whose GRAMMY-nominated song \"Fancy Like\" broke through in mid-2021 thanks to TikTok and ended 2022 among the top five of Billboard's Hot Country Songs. Breakout stars Zach Bryan and Bailey Zimmerman also rode online acceptance to mainstream success — the former built a career on his YouTube buzz, while the latter turned his TikTok virality into Platinum sales.\n\nThe genre expanded in other non-traditional ways in 2022 as well. In particular, indie-rock and LGBTQIA+ artists are no longer hovering in the periphery, but making real impacts on country music listenership, thanks to worthy efforts by Waxahatchee and Adeem the Artist, among others.\n\nAs country music continues to expand its horizons into 2023, here are six trends that defined country music in 2022.\n\nNew Artists Dominated\n\nIf the emergence of new talent is a barometer of a genre's health, country music has nothing to worry about. Not since 2015 has a country artist landed on Billboard's top five Best New Artists, when Sam Hunt broke through big. But this year, country music landed two of the five spots on the year-end chart, thanks to newcomers Zach Bryan and Bailey Zimmerman.\n\nBryan emerged with an audacious statement, claiming country's biggest first-week sales with his major-label debut, the triple-album American Heartbreak. The album landed at No. 5 on the Billboard Top 200 and topped country streaming tallies on both Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nLike Bryan, who first found success when his music went viral on social media, Bailey Zimmerman parlayed his online following into an impressive run with Platinum singles \"Fall in Love\" and \"Rock and a Hard Place.\" Both are off of his first EP on Warner Music Nashville, Leave the Light On, which became the most-streamed all-genre debut of the year and the biggest streaming country debut of all time.\n\nLainey Wilson also had a banner year, proving that her No. 1 hit on country radio with \"Things A Man Oughta Know\" in 2021 was no fluke. In between winning new artist honors from both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association this year, she landed her second No. 1 on country radio with the Cole Swindell collab \"Never Say Never\" in April. Most recently, Wilson became the latest country star to appear on the hit Paramount TV drama \"Yellowstone\"; she debuted on season five as the character Abby, performing her original songs \"Smell Like Smoke\" and \"Watermelon Moonshine,\" and has become a recurring character.\n\nAfter Jelly Roll made waves with his 2021 single \"Dead Man Walking\" and the 2022 Brantley Gilbert collaboration \"Son of the Dirty South,\" the Nashville country rapper solidified himself as a newcomer to watch with \"Son of a Sinner.\" The slow-burning single scored Jelly Roll his first top 10 hit on Billboard's Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, and it broke the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. He also proved his hometown pride is strong: On. Dec 9, he headlined a sold-out show at Nashville's 20,000-cap Bridgestone Arena.\n\nBluegrass Saw A Resurgence\n\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find another artist who has broadened the bluegrass horizon in recent years more than Billy Strings; his progressive approach to the foundational country genre pulls in elements of rock and psychedelia. While he titled his 2019 Grammy-winning album Home, on his 2022 set Me/And/Dad, Strings came full-circle to play traditional bluegrass standards with his father, Terry, like they did when he was a kid. Strings (whose birth name is William Lee Apostol) even located the Martin acoustic guitar Terry played in those early days but pawned to support the family, fulfilling Billy's bucket-list bluegrass album in more ways than one.\n\nRepresenting the more traditional approach to the genre, bluegrass icon Del McCoury issued his 17th album, Almost Proud, in February. A peer and collaborator of the genre's Mt. Rushmore (Ralph Stanley, Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs), McCoury is keeping the flame lit in his ninth decade — and he hasn't lost a lick of his abilities. McCoury and his sons Ronnie and Robbie pick, roll and harmonize like it's a Saturday night at the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nUp in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, the Po' Ramblin' Boys have tapped into a similar authenticity by playing bluegrass standards like their forebears. Although they formed around a regular gig at a moonshine distillery, their 2022 album God's Love Is So Divine walks the straight and narrow on 13 gospel bluegrass tunes.\n\nOld Crow Medicine Show have come a long way since O.G. bluegrass musician Doc Watson discovered them busking on the streets of Boone, North Carolina in 2000. While that growth is evident throughout 2022's Paint This Town, they incorporate bluegrass on tracks like \"Painkiller,\" \"DeFord Rides Again\" and \"Hillbilly Boy.\" The group also invited Americana mainstay Jim Lauderdale to co-write a couple of tunes, and Mississippi fife master Sharde Thomas to guest on \"New Mississippi Flag.\"\n\nPunk Went Country (And Country Went Punk)\n\nGenre-bending is nothing new in Nashville, and even punk rockers have been acknowledging the raw power of country music since the early '80s — when bands like X, Social Distortion and The Gun Club began incorporating elements into their music, and even covering classics like Johnny Cash's \"Ring of Fire.\" Fast forward to 2022, and the trend has kicked into high gear.\n\nWoody Guthrie, the iconic folk hero of dust-bowl-era America, left behind a large body of unrecorded songs — evidenced by the three volumes of lyrics that have been set to music and recorded as Mermaid Avenue by Billy Bragg and Wilco. Boston pub punks Dropkick Murphys plucked 10 more uncut Guthrie gems for their 2022 set This Machine Still Kills Fascists, a play on the line Guthrie famously scrawled onto the body of his guitar. For their first country album, Dropkick Murphys recruited two of the genre's brightest lights: Nikki Lane, who guests on \"Never Git Drunk No More,\" and Evan Felker of Turnpike Troubadours, who shares the mic on \"The Last One.\"\n\nFoo Fighter Chris Shiflett — who previously played with speedy punks No Use For A Name — got into the act, too. When he isn't cranking guitars alongside Dave Grohl and Pat Smear, he plays his own Bakersfield-inspired country rock, as heard on 2017's West Coast Town and 2019's Hard Lessons. This year, he issued the singles \"Born & Raised\" and \"Long, Long Year,\" a pair of breezy, pedal steel-assisted cuts that find him leaning more than ever into his sunny SoCal disposition.\n\nShiflett previously shredded the guitar solo on \"Goin' Nowhere,\" a collaboration with country hitmaker HARDY on his Hixtape Vol. 2, released in the last weeks of 2021. Now, HARDY's back and flipping the script with his own rock record, the mockingbird & THE CROW, set for release in January. Early singles \"JACK,\" \"TRUCK BED\" and the title track, all released in 2022, show the influence of Nirvana and post-grunge songcraft alongside his distinctive, rhythmic lyrical delivery.\n\nLegends Got Their Due\n\nIn 2022, country music proved that age is irrelevant when the music is this good. Newcomers Chapel Hart captured the national spotlight — and a rare Golden Buzzer — on \"America's Got Talent\" in July with a nod to icon Dolly Parton. The trio's electrifying performance of their original song \"You Can Have Him Jolene,\" an answer to Parton's 1974 smash \"Jolene,\" elevated them to star status, and they spent the latter half of 2022 playing to sold-out audiences across America. Darius Rucker even recruited them to back him on his song \"Ol' Church Hymn.\"\n\nParton had her own high point this year, earning her first No. 1 on Billboard's Bluegrass Albums chart with her 48th studio album, Run, Rose, Run. She also released a new compilation album, Diamonds & Rhinestones: The Greatest Hits Collection, in November.\n\nAfter Shania Twain spent the last couple of years featuring on other artist's songs, the best-selling female country artist of all time returned to her throne in 2022. She announced her sixth studio album, Queen of Me (due Feb. 3, 2023), helmed by the dance-floor bop \"Waking Up Dreaming.\" The announcement followed the Netflix documentary Not Just A Girl (and the companion album that featured more than a dozen unreleased songs) and preceded another huge announcement: a 76-date U.S. tour for 2023.\n\nTwain's fellow genre-bending '90s icon, Sheryl Crow, also issued a documentary in 2022. The Showtime special, \"Sheryl,\" was accompanied by a double-album compilation of the same name, which featured two discs of hits plus collaborations with Chris Stapleton, Stevie Nicks, Jason Isbell and more. Crow also featured on 2022 releases from TobyMac and Lucius. The latter track also featured Brandi Carlile, who has played a big role in Tanya Tucker's recent comeback story — as shown in yet another 2022 doc, \"The Return of Tanya Tucker,\" which featured their song \"Ready As I'll Never Be.\"\n\nThe CMA Awards paid tribute to icons Jerry Lee Lewis, who passed away in October, and Alan Jackson, who is in the midst of a farewell tour dubbed Last Call: One More For the Road. Firebrand singer Elle King channeled The Killer's wild moves as she performed his signature hit, \"Great Balls of Fire,\" backed by The Black Keys. Meanwhile, Carrie Underwood led a star-studded Jackson tribute featuring Dierks Bentley, Jon Pardi and Lainey Wilson, who performed a melody of his hits including \"Chattahoochee\" and \"Don't Rock the Jukebox.\"\n\nThe legacies continued both on stage and in studio. Brooks & Dunn's Ronnie Dunn, Reba McEntire and Bonnie Raitt all returned with new albums in 2022; meanwhile, Shenandoah, Billy Dean and Wade Hayes appeared on the Country Comeback Tour, and Wynonna led The Judds: The Final Tour in tribute to her mother, Naomi Judd, who passed away in April.\n\nIndie Rockers Infiltrated Country Music\n\nAs '90s-style indie rock has a moment thanks to artists like Big Thief, Momma and Alvvays, Katie Crutchfield is leaning deeper into laid-back country vibes. The leader of Waxahatchee, whose blissful 2020 set Saint Cloud landed her on scores of year-end lists, doubled down in 2022.\n\nWaxahatchee collaborated with Wynonna on the single \"Other Side,\" recorded on the Judds singer's farm in Tennessee — an experience both artists ranked among their favorite recording sessions. Crutchfield also collaborated with Jess Williamson on a new project dubbed Plains, releasing the album I Walked With You A Ways in 2022 to critical acclaim. The 10 songs on Plains' debut rival the artists' soothing solo work and combine their strengths with Fleetwood Mac harmonies.\n\nMadison Cunningham, who is best known for weaving mind-bending melodies and harmonies between her voice and guitar, guested on the second edition of Watkins Family Hour — which pairs siblings Sara and Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek with a series of notable collaborators like Fiona Apple and Jackson Browne — contributing her signature spidery guitar playing to \"Pitseleh.\"\n\nOther notables on the indie side of country include Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit, who returned with Palomino, a strummy set of acoustic guitar-driven country pop and their first album in four years. Michaela Anne's gentle LP Oh To Be That Free chronicled a period of personal troubles with compassion, while Sierra Ferrell released the sparse, playful single \"Hey Me, Hey Mama\" and collaborated with Shakey Graves on \"Ready Or Not.\"\n\nLGBTQIA+ Country Artists Were Celebrated\n\nAcceptance for LGBTQIA+ artists in country music has grown steadily in recent years, thanks to efforts by allies like Kacey Musgraves and Dolly Parton, as well as artists who have publicly discussed their sexuality, including T.J. Osborne, Lil Nas X, Chely Wright, Amythyst Kiah and Shane McAnally. With such star power in their corner, gay and non-binary country artists are now getting a fairer shake.\n\nNon-binary singer-songwriter Adeem the Artist released the acclaimed album White Trash Revelry. Over 11 songs, Adeem chronicles their experiences growing up different in small towns surrounded by smaller minds — from the stomp-along \"Going to Hell\" to the Heartland rocker \"Heritage of Arrogance\" and fingerpicked album closer \"My America.\"\n\nElsewhere, Orville Peck, the masked singer who performs a fever dream of '70s-inspired country music with a deep-throated croon, returned with his second album, Bronco. Peck traded the spare songscapes of his 2019 debut, Pony, for Bronco's more fully realized, cinematic arrangements, broadening his sound and the scope of his persona.\n\nBrandi Carlile, whose pro-LGBTQIA+ activism is tied directly to her music — she founded the Looking Out Foundation early in her music career, and donates a portion of touring proceeds to groups like The Trevor Project — has seen her reputation grow steadily over nearly two decades of releasing music to ever-growing audiences. In 2022, she added to an already storied career by performing with her personal hero, Joni Mitchell, at Newport Folk Festival. Carlile also headlined Tennessee's Pilgrimage Music & Cultural Festival, marking the first time a woman has headlined the fest.\n\nHowever country music continues to expand and impact culture as a result, 2022's trends certainly set up a promising future for the genre.\n\nHear All Of The Best Country Solo Performance Nominees For The 2023 GRAMMY Awards"
