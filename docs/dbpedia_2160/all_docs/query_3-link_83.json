        "text": "His courage and determination changed the game of baseball forever and inspired generations of athletes after him, breaking the color barrier of Major League Baseball in 1947. He was instrumental in discontinuing the need for a separate Negro League once doors were opened to play in the major leagues.\n\nHis courage and determination in the face of racism and discrimination inspired other black athletes to pursue their goals. Robinson was one of the most influential baseball players in history. The film 42 released in 2013 about Jackie Robinson played by Chadwick Boseman shared various acts of racism he endured including a near lynching act.\n\nRobinson's story began long before he stepped onto a major league baseball diamond. When Jackie was a child, his family moved from Cairo, Georgia, to Pasadena, California, where he faced racism and poverty. He had a natural baseball talent and rose quickly through the ranks.\n\nJackie Robinson began his relationship with the Montreal Royals an affiliate minor league of the Brooklyn Dodgers. This was his first actual baseball breaking of the color barrier along with teammate Johnny Wright. Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. As a result of his exemplary performance on the field, he helped change people's perceptions of Black athletes. Robinson paved the way for future generations of African Americans in baseball and other sports. He faced immense pressure and hostility from fans and fellow players. The racism challenges began as players on their minor league team with spring training in Florida. He was confronted with racial hostility among team players and opposing team players. Robinson and fellow Black player, Johnny Wright were not allowed to stay in the same hotels, nor dine in restaurants with white teammates. Some games were cancelled because local authorities refused to allow them to play or even enter the ballpark. Sometimes they were escorted off the ballpark once the discovery of their presence was known.\n\nThe legacy of Jackie Robinson goes far beyond sports. He is remembered as a courageous man who stood up for what he believed in and changed baseball and America forever.\n\nThe early days of baseball were segregated. White players played on white teams, and black players played on black teams. This segregation lasted until 1947 when Jackie Robinson became the first black player to join a major league team.\n\nWith Robinson's entry into the majors, baseball was forever changed. Before Robinson, black players were not permitted to compete against white players. When Robinson became a Brooklyn Dodger, he began competing against some of the best white players in the league.\n\nDue to Robinson's success on the field, his courage in breaking down barriers opened the door for other black players to enter the majors and compete at the highest level. The brave actions of Jackie Robinson all those years ago have made baseball a much more diverse sport.\n\nRelated:\n\nAlthea Gibson: The First Black Female Tennis Player\n\nAs an incredible athlete and trailblazer, Gibson was the first African American to win a Grand Slam tennis title who went on to win 11 more.
