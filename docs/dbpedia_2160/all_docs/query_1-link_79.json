        "text": "John L. Wright Jr. was a man of many talents - a writer, social activist and actor who appeared in 50 plays and in four independent movies, including\n\nin 2010.\n\nWright worked as director of communications for University Hospital from 1967-89. Before that, he was an advertising executive, a journalist who once interviewed the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and a member of the Homewood City Council from 1960-62. After retiring from UAB, Wright did community relations for Miles College in 1990-91 and public relations work for the Better Basics reading program from 1992-95. Since then, he has been known as an activist for better public transit.\n\nWright died on June 2. He was 87.\n\n\"He helped a lot of people and didn't want a lot of recognition,\" said his son, Mark Wright, the youngest of his five children, along with Debra, Teresa, Maureen and John L. Wright III.\n\n\"He had two great passions,\" Mark Wright said. \"He was very passionate about improving mass transit, and he was very passionate about educating people about Father Coyle.\"\n\nLobbied for cause of slain priest\n\nWright, a member of Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church, in recent years championed a campaign to promote Father James E. Coyle for official martyrdom and sainthood in the Catholic Church. Coyle was the pastor of St. Paul's Cathedral from 1904 until he was gunned down in 1921 on the front steps of the downtown rectory. \"He ought to be our patron saint for racial and religious understanding,\" Wright said in an interview with The Birmingham News.\n\nWright researched the Coyle case for 22 years and traveled to Coyle's former home in Ireland. Coyle's name most often appears in association with biographies of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who as a young defense attorney helped Coyle's killer gain an acquittal based on an appeal to the jury's ethnic and religious prejudice.\n\n\"It's just a reflection of what can happen when evil is not challenged,\" Wright said. \"As a lifelong Catholic who loves his faith, I began to read more about it. It's important. There was a public and pervasive, blatant, community-wide anti-Catholic bigotry of that time that has never been well-reported. This was an international hate crime.\"\n\nPassion for public transit\n\nWright, the son of a baker, grew up in Birmingham as the oldest of six children in the Norwood neighborhood, riding city buses and streetcars, while attending St. Paul's Catholic School.\n\nThat fueled his passion for better mass transit in his home city.\n\n\"I was born with a social justice gene,\" Wright told AL.com earlier this year.\n\n\"We brag about this being the Bible Belt,\" he said. \"Too many people, when they leave their places of worship, they forget what they've just heard about being kind to people.\"\n\nDuring a public meeting last year as public transit funding was being debated, Wright stood up and said, \"We have to ask ourselves, in our conscience, when you go to another city and they have good transit, why don't we have it here?\"\n\nWright was born in Birmingham on Christmas Day in 1927. He graduated from St. Bernard Prep School in Cullman in 1945. He served in the Army Air Corps in 1946 and then attended St. Bernard Junior College. He eventually received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in urban studies from UAB. In 1949, he worked for The Birmingham News in the advertising department and met his wife, Jeanne Stallings. They married in 1950 and recently celebrated their 65th anniversary.\n\nWorked in Selma, met MLK\n\nWright worked as assistant editor and promotion manager for the Catholic Week newspaper for seven years, then as an account executive for Martin, White and Mickwee advertising agency. In 1964, he moved his family to Selma to work as assistant administrator of Good Samaritan Hospital. He wrote for the Edmundite Southern Mission's magazine and three days after Bloody Sunday, he interviewed civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King for Catholic News Service.\n\nWright began acting in Birmingham community theater in 1978 and appeared in productions with Summerfest, Birmingham Festival Theatre, Town & Gown Theatre, Terrific New Theatre and the Seasoned Performers. His plays included \"The Cherry Orchard,\" \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown,\" \"Oliver,\" \"The Crucible\" and \"You Can't Take it With You.\"\n\nMovie made $41 million at box office\n\nHis most prominent movie role came in \"The Last Exorcism,\" produced by Eli Roth, who directed \"Hostel\" and acted in \"Inglorious Basterds.\" The film about a fictional exorcism in the South was made for $1.6 million and grossed more than $41 million nationally.\n\nWright played a Southern preacher, the father of the main character. He said his scenes were improvisational. \"They would tell us the point of a scene, and we would act it out,\" Wright told AL.com.\n\nWright was at home on large stages and small. He once did a one-man show for the homeless at the Church of the Reconciler, recalled the Rev. Lawton Higgs Sr., a retired United Methodist pastor.\n\n\"He was a compassionate man who worked for justice and peace in Birmingham,\" Higgs said. \"He was a source of hope and strength.\"\n\nLove Returns\n\nWright also wrote a book of short stories, \"Love Returns to Luverne and Other Original Short Stories,\" which he published last year.\n\nDespite battling cancer, Wright remained outspoken and active, doing book signings and public readings. Last month, he was quoted in a Life Stories profile of his friend, fellow transit activist Charles \"Peanut Man\" Ridley.\n\n\"He was very emotional about mass transit and helping the poor,\" John L. Wright III said of his father. \"He wanted to raise awareness for people who had no voice. We're going to miss him greatly.\""
