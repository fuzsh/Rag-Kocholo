        "text": "My life is not over. I am not hopeless. In fact, I feel like it’s just beginning. When tragedy happens we normally shut down, hide from people, and suffer in silence. But I don’t want that for me or for my family. I have nothing to hide and will not be shamed into solitude. I love my children, I love my friends, and I love my community in Mexico and Vancouver.\n\nWith a sad heart, I must share that my husband has been in an affair with a married woman for 7 months. I came home to Vancouver yesterday with the kids and am living with my mother and grandparents. We are surrounded by family and friends and the boys are being well taken care of.\n\nI don’t have answers to what’s next. And I won’t for a while. Please pray for restoration, whatever way that might look like, for our families. Pray for all four children, their hearts and minds, and that they grow up to be strong, healthy followers of Christ.\n\nAs of now, FirstE will be depositing the next months support check to me in a separate account that will go directly to me and the kids. If you are willing to continue to support us financially in the next couple months as I transition back to the states and figure out what we will do that will greatly help ease the financial stress of this complicated situation.\n\nI always feared this day and thought my faith would surely be broken. But what’s funny, is it’s stronger than it’s ever been. Even though I’m hurt and don’t feel God all the time, I now without a doubt he was with me through it all. He provided for me, gave me dreams, warned me, comforted me, and gave me a content spirit. On the outside looking in, I can only say that my strength comes from the Lord.\n\nThank you\n\nAún creo en la visión de Horizonte. De hecho, lo creo más en la visión que nunca. Yo mudé a ensenada con un sueño y llamado que no solo era de mi esposo – pero era mío también. Y creo más que nunca que Dios está y estará haciendo un movimiento de su Espíritu a través de Horizonte. Mi familia somos victimas de guerra, una guerra espiritual. Está bien obvio que el diablo uso las debilidades de los más importantes líderes para tratar de destruir todo. Pero creo que Dios no va a permitir que su iglesia caer. Horizonte va seguir más fuerte y unida en la visión que Dios tiene para esta movimiento.\n\nIf you haven’t already heard or seen on social media, our second son Max was born on August 5! He is a CHUNKY boy, eating and gaining weight like a champ 🙌🏻 he was born weighing 8 pounds 4 ounces and was 20 1/2 inches long —- at 2 months he is now 12 pounds and growing out of 3 month clothing 😳 Thank you for all your prayer covering his birth and latch struggles during his first week of life. We truly felt loved, cared for, and encouraged by all of you!\n\nOur first week back, Max’s 2nd week of life, we held our annual youth conference called “Movimiento.” Jonny co-wrote the theme song of the conference called “Una Sola Palabra” — “just one word,” meaning that just one word from God has the power to do anything. The chorus lyrics say, “Una sola palabra. Es un fuego en mi ser. Una luz que me hace ver. Una sola palabra. Llenará mi corazón. Que tú voz escuche hoy Señor.” —- “just one word. Is a fire in my being. A light that makes me see. Just one word. Fills my heart. That I would hear your voice today Lord.” It obviously sounds much better in Spanish! But it helps you get the point!\n\nThe conference held over 700 youth for 3 days of hearing speakers and times of worship. It may sound cliche, but it really does get better every year! Our leadership team wrote 6 new songs and sang them at the conference. 5 of those songs were released during the conference as an EP for our youth band “Movimiento.” You can check out the video for one of the songs here ——> or search for the CD on any digital outlet “Es Jesus” by Música de Movimiento.\n\nJonny’s dream of recording another live album came true during the conference. He recorded 10 songs live and is currently mixing/mastering them in the studio. Our record company Canción has approved publishing it this coming month!!! So I will be posting about it when it is released very soon 🙌🏻\n\nIn the last month we had our first oficial “interest nights” for our 2 new church plants in Mexicali and Monterey. As the worship pastor, Jonny will be directly overseeing the worship ministries of our church plants, along with his team. This means Jonny is now looking after the health and growth of 4 different campuses/plant. He and the team will be traveling to visit these church plants often.\n\nJonny flew to Monterey before the interest night to meet with those interested in being apart of the worship ministry to give them an overview of our heart and vision for the worship ministry. This was my first time alone with the kids solo and it went surprising well! It was a good warm up for the increasing travel opportunities jonny has been receiving. Just a week ago Jonny was invited to do sound for very influential band in Latin America called En Espíritu y en Verdad. He loves supporting their ministry and being able to use his gifts as an engineer to help them share the gospel and lead people into an encounter with God.\n\nClick here to watch the live recording of En Espíritu y en Verdad in their yearly conference —-> Espíritu y en Verdad\n\nYou can pray for me and the transition with two kids and Jonny traveling. It’s definitely a challenge, but the rewards are great! Together, we get to go on tour with the band the end of November and we are VERY excited to see what God is going to do through these worship nights. We are aiming to save enough money like last year in order to buy hotels during tour instead of sleeping in the churches. With a four month old & a 2 year old I can imagine sleeping on the floor will be pretty difficult and won’t help us be at our best for leading worship each night.\n\nStudent Housing Apartments:\n\nOver the last year we were able to buy land and completed our home here in Ensenada. Over the last two months we began building 2 student housing apartments on our property! They are putting on the roof to the apartments this week and they are turning out incredible! We have made it 90% of the way to completing the dream we set out to complete just over a year ago! I honestly did not think it could have happened this quickly and am so overwhelmed by your generosity and God’s continual provision.\n\nWe have finished the construction, but still need more money to finish the interior. We are trying to be creative in how we will finish the apartment interiors and furnish them. Jonny is planning on doing as much finishing himself as he has the skills to do. This will save us some money, but we still are in need of funds to get them completely ready for the students to move in next semester (February).\n\nIf you are interested in doing a fundraiser or organizing a construction team to come down in the next month to help us complete the apartments send me a message!!\n\nPlease pray and believe with us that God will multiply the resources we have. He has been so incredibly good to us, as have all of you!\n\nLove and blessings to you all!\n\nWhat a year it has been! Here I am, back in the states again just days away from holding our second child. This month has been a great time for me to reflect on what God has done through this ministry and the promises he has fulfilled!\n\nBuilding Projects:\n\nAlmost 2 years ago we felt God speaking to us about building housing for our school of leadership students. We also felt confirmed that he was calling us to stay here long-term and we started dreaming of building a home here. To be honest, this seemed so far out of reach that I had a hard time even agreeing and praying for God’s provision. But in my doubt, I heard God speak to me not only will He provide for what we need, but He will supply MORE than what we asked. God gave me a specific number of the excess he would provide and who I was suppose to give it to. Over the last year we received donations, family loans, and sold our house here in Vancouver. In the end, our house sold for more than we had it on the market for by the exact amount God told me it would. We have been in complete AWE of how God has provided for the complete finishing of our house and enough left over to start the first phase of the student housing! Jonny is currently in Mexico working with the City/Engineers to get our building plans approved so they can start on the foundation of the student housing.\n\nNew Leaders:\n\nWe believe our calling is to raise up worship leaders and song writers in Mexico that will be the next influencers of influence and direction for the church in Latin America. This year we have seen the fruit of the school of leadership and Jonny’s discipling build up 4 strong directors/leaders in our worship ministry of over 70 people.\n\nA student named Abraham from the first generation of the school of leadership, came back to co-direct the worship track of the school of leadership with Jonny this year. He has all the skills to be a great director and has a pastoral heart that longs to see others grow in their giftings. He co-lead the school with maturity, confidence, humbleness, and great faithfulness. We are excited to announce that he will officially be directing the worship track of the School of Leadership starting next September!\n\nJonny’s first teacher, Ivan, who co-taught with him during the first generation of the school of leadership is now on staff helping direct the worship ministry. He has shown such love and dedication to Horizonte and the people he leads. He also leads the youth worship ministry and youth band “Movimiento.” He has been leading the band along with Cacha in the songwriting, recording, and producing of their first full length CD to be released in the up and coming months!\n\nOur full-time studio engineer Chuy (Jesus) came to us after we had been praying for someone to come alongside Jonny and get the studio up and running fulltime. Chuy is a young man who felt God tell him to go and serve at Horizonte, even though he had no job, no money, and no housing. He traveled to a new city and just began to serve at the church wholeheartedly, with such humility and faithfulness. And this has been our Chuy, from the very beginning – an extremely talented young man with great humility and passion for his work. He has become an integral part of the studio, band, and worship ministry.\n\nAnother student named Cacha (Alberto) from the first generation of the school of leadership came back this year to support our worship ministry and lead the adolescent worship ministry. He is one of the most talented and quick learning musicians we have ever met. He is marked by his extreme passion and dedication to his craft and the training of other musicians. He started our weekly Saturday trainings for musicians and created a system for training and integrating new musicians into the adolescent worship ministry. He has been so success in his training and equipping of musicians, he is now in charge of training of all new/existing musicians in the worship ministry as a whole! This summer Jonny put him in charge of leading the multiple worship bands for our largest youth event (Movimiento)/leadership conference this August. He has continually stepped into new leadership roles with incredible dedication and passion at the ripe age of 20!\n\nWe feel these leaders and going to change the world. We believe there are hundreds of people like them all around Mexico in local churches. These guys are just the beginning and examples of the hundreds that will transform Latin America.\n\nWorship Ministry:\n\nWe have seen such incredible growth within the worship ministry this past year. We now have 70 musicians, including 30 worship leaders, serving in the worship ministry as a whole (including kids, adolescent, and youth ministries). We have 16 worship directors that we believe are strong enough leaders to be able to lead not only at services, but for events and touring. This has been our vision from the beginning, to not just train worship leaders to be “good enough” or able to just sing a song, but to effectively lead Gods people in powerful times of connection with him. That way when we send out these worship directors to events and new church campuses we are sending out our best. We hope that each leader brings with them a taste of the culture we’ve created at Horizonte. That whenever they go, they bring the heart of our ministry with them.\n\nJonny & Dana:\n\n(Dana) I still believe there is good in this world, because Jesus came to bring hope and salvation to all. And we must go and share, no matter the cost. Just last week Jonny called me after he went to record a music video and said they had to change locations because there were armed men in trucks attacking those who drove the highway where they were going to film at. Just before Jonny left for the Dominican Republic they had found a man with his head cut off just outside of Ensenada where we live. Tensions seem to be rising between the cartels in the Baja and this is very unusual for the years we have lived there. I am so thankful for my easy breezy summer here in Vancouver with family waiting for Baby Boy #2 to arrive.\n\nAs I was reading this update from one of the biggest supporters of Horizonte (READ HERE—-> https://frmusa.org/2018/07/05/the-rescue-of-clara/ ) , the church’s orphanage Casa Horizonte, and Banda Horizonte was a rough reminder of the world we live and serve in. Men like Wes from Far Reaching Ministries are few and far between and has become a hero to Jonny and I. Just last year his foundation provided our pastor, assistant pastor, and woman’s director all new cars. (Shout out to my grandparents who had also given us a new car last year and recently helped us get a second car to drive back this summer!)\n\nGod bless Horizonte, Casa Horizonte, and Far Reaching Ministries. Yes, it is “stressful” what you do, but like Wes said, not as stressful as the tough life the little girl who you’ve been called to care for had to endure before she arrived at your safe house. I am proud to serve with Horizonte and see so much hope in a fallen world. Every long night apart from Jonny these past months have been worth it. Because the impact Horizonte is having on Latin America is worth it. So worth it. I told Jonny before he left again this Thursday… I am so proud of you and love you more and more for the sacrifices you make to support this ministry. I don’t regret moving away from family and wholeheartedly love the life we live.\n\nI hope this article gives you a little glimpse of why we do what we do. In the last 4 years we’ve been at Horizonte, we’ve seen 2 services turn into 6 fully filled services each weekend. This year we are planting 2 new churches and one satellite campus which has been already filling 2 services every week for the past couple months. We are filled with so much excitement for the coming year and are eager to see what God has up his sleeve!\n\nPsalms 37:18-19 The Lord knows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will remain forever; they are not put to shame in evil times; in the days of famine they have abundance.\n\n(Dana) I believe in legacy. I have experienced what I believe to be a spiritual heritage that was built on the faith of my grandparents and their fervent prayer for their grandchildren. My mother is the godliest woman I know and blessed me with such a rich spiritual heritage to be born into. She has been through great hardship, but through it all her faith emerged stronger, deeper, and purer. My faith was born out of the faith of my mother. I believe I am where I am today because of this legacy. My family is filled with missionaries dating back generations. Jonny’s story is not too different, coming from a line of pastors. He was raised into a spiritually rich family and is reaping that spiritual blessing.\n\nAll this to say, we are over abundantly blessed by our family. No one believes in us more than our family. And that’s just it, I believe we are here and receiving generous financial and spiritual support because of our families. Many people give to us because of their belief in my grandparent’s and my mother’s faithfulness to the church. A large amount of our support comes from my mother’s friends from her lifelong small group. Another large amount comes from congregants of First Evangelical Church who saw the legacy of my grandparents Wayne and Jean, my mother, and my husband and I’s faithfulness to the worship ministry over the 6 years Jonny pastored there.\n\nSomeone asked me today, how did you raise support?\n\nBut that’s just it, I don’t think we raised support. Instead, we have supporters. People who genuinely care about us, our mission, and our family. It’s all about YOU guys and your generous faithfulness to support us and this mission. I guess the point of this lengthy monologue is to say THANK YOU. We are day by day amazed we are supported by our physical and spiritual family to live as missionaries.\n\nMonthly Support Update\n\nAfter checking our average giving over the last 6 months, we are happy to say our monthly budget has been met! Thank you all for your generosity, if you would like to know more about the specifics of our budget please don’t hesitate to ask. We would be happy to share those with you.\n\nHouse Update\n\nOver the last 2 months we have received some donations to finish our house here in Mexico. This has been our dream for the last 2 years coming to life because of generous family members and friends. It is always uncomfortable for me to ask for donations, but our supporters have always been so generous and kind when we have extra needs.\n\nAlthough we are close, we are still in need of around $10,000 to finish the house well. It’s been a little shocking and stressful discovering some of the finishing expense of the house that were not communicated to us at the beginning. Even with some extra donations received, we still don’t have enough funds for the finishing of the interior walls, flooring, and some labor costs. We are hoping to raise another $10,000 to finish the house completely and start us off with no additional debt.\n\nIf you are interested helping us finish our house you can give like normal through First Evangelical church or now online through MEI!\n\nFor online tax deductible donations go to:\n\nhttps://meigiving.com/Sites/meiGiving2.php\n\nEnter in your information/billing address\n\nUnder “Select Giving Type,” select “Special Gift for a Person”\n\nEnter our personal account number is: #JD3490\n\n(This is how your donation will get to us)\n\nThe last 5 months have been an incredible season of harvest. We have been investing in the ministry in Ensenada for 2 years now and are seeing our greatest dreams come to life. We have seen God building relationships with some of the most influential people in the church of Latin America. It is evident to these leaders that God has a unique calling on Horizonte to set a standard in biblical truth and creative expression. It would be like Chris Tomlin calling us, offering his help and asking to record his latest songs with us. Last week I received a text message from someone who works at Capital Records (Coldplay, The Beatles…) that was so impressed by the content we were creating and encouraged by what our church is producing. This is shocking! And we believe it is going to open more doors to equip worship leaders and songwriters.\n\nIn May we went on tour to 10 different cities in northern Mexico. The tours we do are a complete step of faith. We don’t charge for any of the events, we simply sell merchandise and ask for an offering. But God always provides what we need and we see Gods hand so powerfully as we trust him. Every city we went to people sang our songs so boldly and it was humbling to see the vision God gave to us being fulfilled before our eyes.\n\nAfter we returned we were preparing for Movimiento Conference, this is our largest event that we do each year. Basically its three days of worship and teaching where over 800 young people come together to encounter God and have their lives changed by him.\n\nSeptember 4th we started our first full year of the School of Leadership. We expanded the School of Worship into 3 different tracks and extended it to a 1-year program. We have 15 worship students, 11 pastoral students, and 6 creative students (cameras, website, sound, lights, etc.) These 32 students are from all over the USA and Mexico committing one year of their lives to be trained in practical local church ministry.\n\nThe church is continuing to grow. We have about 60 people involved in the worship teams now and are starting our 4th service next week! Our weekly attendance has grown this year from 700 to 1,300. The goal is to do our first campus this Spring. Please be praying that God gives us wisdom on how to keep up with this level of growth and continue to equip and involve more people. I currently have 4 full-time worship staff working under me that are either supported as missionaries or are being paid by working in our recording studio.\n\nFinally we would like to announce that we feel God has been confirming these last 6 months that he is calling us to be long-term missionaries here in Ensenada. One of the ways he has communicated this is through a few people who have believed in our mission enough to help us purchase land to build a home. This allows us to settle in and begin to invest in our future here in Ensenada. The money for the land was donated and some family members gave us loans for the house. Currently we need about $5,000 more to finish the house completely.

We know God is hearing them. We are literally seeing miracles every day and feel so strongly that each one of you is a part of our ministry.\n\nTomorrow we set off at 5am for #MoviTour17 to meet with the rest of the team in Culiacán. We will be traveling for 2 weeks all throughout Mexico sharing the hope and JOY we’ve found in Christ. The band will be playing 3 sets every night and be sleeping on church floors (thankfully we have host homes for the majority of the trip). From what we will post it will look like the luxurious travel life, but that’s far from the truth. The church actually invests money into the tour and each member is paying their own way to go, using precious vacation time to go serve.\n\nSo why in the world would we do this?\n\nI go in response to the testimony of God’s love and grace for me in my life. Two years ago I was hurting and depressed from a miscarriage and failure to get pregnant subsequently. I went to a prayer meeting in a foreign city where a stranger prayed for me and called out my barrenness. She called out my situation from nothing, but said God was going to bless us with a child. And not just of our own blood, but many spiritual children that Jonny and I were going to love, teach, and send out.\n\nIn the midst of my hurting, I felt Gods grace and tangible love for me in my pain. God was and is so present and relational. He cares about us in every season of our life. He is generous and abundant with his affection. Now, here I prepare to head out with my beautiful, healthy baby boy and our incredible interns Alberto Verdusco Abraham Gonzalez from the school of worship (and the equally incredible Jesus Segura holding down the fort back home).\n\nI go because I have experienced true love in a hateful world. I go because i’ve been given identity and purpose. I go because this HOPE for a future is HERE and it’s not just for me. Abundant life is what God desires for you, free from sin and shame. A love that covers and hides you from fear and anxiety. I go in JOY in celebration of His resurrection.\n\nNow Jonny I need you to remind me of this in 4 days when I’m tired and crabby.\n\nDecember 2nd. A day I truly wondered if I would make it to without losing my mind. A day where I knew I had completed the hardest thing I have ever done. I took on the responsibility of developing and discipling 25 people from all over Mexico every day for 3 months. I have never felt such a weight upon me. Many of them had put their entire lives on hold, left family, and paid money to come to this school. It was a strange paradox, because I knew in reality I couldn’t give them what they truly wanted, but I could lead them to Jesus. Daily trying to give them what he had given me and teach them what he had taught me about worship leading. I could tell a story about each student and how God met with them throughout those 13 weeks and I truly believe their time here changed them forever.\n\nThe graduation on December 2nd was bitter-sweet. Remembering the amazing times we all had together, knowing it was the end of a season that was so beautiful. But at the same time, recognizing it was only the beginning and imagining the impact that these students would have as they return to their local churches. I believe God will do incredible things through each of them and am blessed to have walked with them for this season.\n\nEXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nThe school of worship was amazing! But we are always looking forward to the next step that God has for us. SO we are excited to announce that next year we are launching a School of Leadership that will have 3 different tracks (Worship, Creative, Church Planting/Pastoring) and it will be a 10 month program. We are praying for and anticipating 100 students to equip in these three areas to better serve the church of Mexico.\n\nWe also had an amazing Christmas Outreach concert where hundreds of people gathered to hear the message of Jesus and sing Christmas Songs.\n\nThis April and May we will be heading on our next Movitour. This will be our longest tour yet, and we will go to 10 cities in Mexico doing free concerts and preaching the gospel. We are also planning a few events in Central America (Guatemala, Costa Rica and El Salvador) later this year. If you are interested in helping support the travel expenses of these tours you can make a one time donation here: Donate (Please put “plane tickets MOVI” in the memo)\n\nBelow is a video of one of the songs written and recorded by the students at the school of worship:\n\nThank you all for your continued prayer and support!\n\nWe have an amazing group of people in the school of worship. It seriously blows my mind. 24 students from the ages of 15 to 69, each one with their own story and experiences. Coming from different churches to be unified under one name. Jesus.\n\nAs one of the assignments for the school each student is required to prepare a three-song worship set to lead worship for their peers and a 30-minute devotional. Today just so happed to be the day that the 69-year-old man led worship and the 15 year old girl shared a devotional.\n\nI am so blessed and humbled that a man almost three times my age, a successful doctor, with way more life experience than me, would choose to come to this school. He has been such an example to the other students of what it means to be a disciple and respond to the call, at any age. This man lives out the encouragement of Paul to “consider others as better than yourself.”\n\nI love when he leads worship. It is so clearly a reflection of his character. There is something so true and genuine about it.\n\nNext the young girl shared about how God called her family to Mexico as missionaries. That even though we make our own plans, God has greater plans for us. She felt confused and alone moving to a country she didn’t understand. But as she has gone with her family to minister to women (sometimes her age) in recovery centers and safe houses she sees that she has something to offer them. She can share that God has a plan. That even though their lives may seem hopeless he has plans to prosper them, to give them a hope and a future.\n\nAll I could think was, “what would my response have been at 15?” Would I have been as open to Gods leading? Would I have seen his hand at work? Would I have looked for opportunities to speak life into the people he brought me to?\n\nIt’s an amazing day when you realize your students are teaching you more than you are teaching them.\n\n(side note) in case you missed it… Check out our latest video below! 🙂"
