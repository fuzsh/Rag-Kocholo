        "text": "From the North Broadway Street entrance, visitors are instantly aware of its simplicity in form and elegance of design. The first major feature is the simple crucifix mounted above the entrance way. A “Gothic” design is further expressed by the large doors, the gathering porch, the lancet (pointed tops) windows, and the angled slate roof. Each detail has been understated; thus the designations “Modern” and “Revival.” “Norman” influences can be found in the exposed wooden ceiling beams located above the nave and its large meeting spaces. Interestingly, the ceiling is reminiscent of a wooden boat’s hull. Finally, the use of natural site materials and the building’s emphasis on unifying spaces joining liturgy with community are reflective of many “Medieval English Parish” churches.\n\nThe original architectural plan called for three phases of construction. The first was completed in 1927, and is indicated by the enclosed photo taken ca. 1942 it included a nave with a temporary chancel area. The second phase would not be completed until 1961 and would include the cruciform plan found in most Gothic buildings, a basement, and a permanent chancel area. The third and most recent phase included a new parish hall and education wing with connecting gardens. By 1995, the church building complex was complete in its present form.\n\nIt is often unavoidable to use architectural terms when describing building plans. So to assist our readers, we would like to introduce a few terms that apply directly to our present church building. As space is limited, we will consider definitions rather than meanings at this time.\n\nChancel: To the west of the crossing is an elevated area known as the chancel. Blessing of the holy sacraments, sermons, and readings from the Bible are conducted here. A large, freestanding altar is prominently displayed, with chairs for the rectors, acolytes, Eucharistic ministers, and visiting bishop(s). Between the chancel and the crossing areas are the baptismal font, the lay reader prayer tables and the communion rail.\n\nGarth: Connecting gardens between the church building and the parish house. These gardens were added during the 1995, phase three construction period.\n\nIn a letter sent to Rev. Eugene Hopper, then rector, from the Rt. Rev. Thomas Gailor, Bishop of Tennessee in 1927, indicated his approval of the mission church building. The letter was sent shortly after the completion of the building on the laying of the corner stone.\n\n“ . . . Your church is churchly, dignified, adequate, convenient, as well as comfortable. The external appearance is too, fine. I was much impressed with it all and congratulate you there on.”\n\nWe are so very proud of our church buildings. Each may be thought of as eclectic, self-expressive, and grounded in faith. Our church building extends open arms to our community, and a graceful environment for worship and service.\n\nFrank Laszlo,\n\nChurch Historian\n\nMarch, 2021"
