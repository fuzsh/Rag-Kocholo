        "text": "ALLEGANY COUNTY is in the western division of the State, and is bounded on the east by Washington County, south by the north branch of the Potomac River to the mouth of Savage River, then in a north easterly direction to summit of Savage Mountain, (which is the dividing line between it and Garrett County,) and on to the Pennsylvania line. This county is crossed by the ranges of the Mlegany Mountains, from which it takes its name. The geology is composed principally of sandstone and limestone, with quartz and slate. The most valuable minerals are the vast coal fields and iron ore beds. The soil is of varying character, of sand and clay; in some parts quite fertile, though mostly uncultivated and covered with natural forests. The waters of the county are the north branch of the Potomac and Savage River, and George’s, Wills’, Town, Fifteen Mile and Evitt’s Creeks, with many tributaries heading in the mountains, and all flowing into the Potomac. The surface of Allegany is broken and irregular, the greater part being in the mountains, and covered with the original forests of fine timbers; whilst between the mountain ridges are many broad and level valleys, which have in most cases rich, deep soil, and are covered with excellent grasses, forming naturally, very fine grazing lands, and yielding large crops of good hay. The lands also make good farms, producing all kinds of grain and fine fruit Allegany possesses in its immense coal fields the most valuable mineral deposits in the State.\n\nThe celebrated Cumberland coal field lies west of the city, in a basin formed by the Great Savage Mountain on the north-west and the Dan’s Mountain on the south-east, and running north-east and south-west from Pennsylvama State Line, through Allegany County, into Mineral County, West Virginia. The basin is about five miles wide between the two ranges and about twenty miles long. The floor of the basin slopes from either end upwards to Frostburg, where it attains its greatest altitude, from 2,000 to 2,100 feet above mean tide.\n\nThe southern slope of the basin is drained by George’s Creek, flowing south-west from Frostburg and emptying into the Potomac River. The northern slope, by Jenning’s Run, flowing north-west into Wills’ Creek. The aggregate depth of the coal formation here is 1,100 feet, its base being the Millstone Grit. Capping the summits of Savage and Dan’s Mountains, it extends down their sides into the valley, where it dips below the surface. The principal coal veins are, first, the “Big Vein,” fourteen feet of coal, lying 1,860 feet above tide. This is the vein from which most of the coal is now mined. It underlies the surface of the valley at Frostburg and Borden Shaft, but southward, down the George’s Creek, water has cut away that portion of the measure lying in the lowest part of the valley and with it this vein, (which here must have been very near the surface), leaving the higher parts only of the vein standing in the hills thus formed on either side of the water course. Second, the “Four Foot Vein,” which lies about 800 feet below the “Fourteen Foot Vein.” This vein is below water in the higher part of the basin; but appears about sixty feet above at Barton, and lies above the level from that point southward, down the George’s Creek. This vein has been opened by the Piedmont Coal and Iron Company, and proves to be equal In quality to the BIg Vein, and in the southern portion of the basin lies in such a way as to be easily mined. Lastly, the Six Foot Vein,” which lies 160 feet below the “Four Foot Vein,” and is above water level in the lower part of the valley only. This vein is now successfully mined at the New Reading opening, at Westernport. These two lower veins, though smaller in size than the “Big Vein,” have a much greater acreage, as but ilitle of either vein has been cut away by erosion. At present the abussent supply contained in the large vein is so easy of access and can be so cheaply mined, that these smaller veins have not received the share of attention which they eventually will. Several new openings other than those mentioned are now being made in these smaller veins, with very encouraging prospects.\n\nThe total acreage of coal land in this field is 44,132. Of this, 17,300 acres contain the large “Fourteen Foot Vein,” and of course all contain the two smaller veins. Besides these, which are the working veins, there are numerous other small veins, throughout the entire depth ol the coal measure; these veins are from six inches to three feet In thickness; they have never received any attention from mining companies or experts, and we are not able to say what may be their actual value in workable coal. The Cumberland coal field is one of extraordinary wealth. Mining began in 1842, and since then over 81,000,000 tons in all, and 2,410,891 tons in a single year, have been sent into the market by twenty companies, the portion of the field now most worked being that between Frostburg and Piedmont, on George’s Creek. This immense transportation has been chiefly done over the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad. in the two principal veins there are estimated to be now 318,000,000 tons, besides several underlying veins not yet developed. The coal occurs in such a manner as to make the expense of working a minimum, being never far from the surface and In veins of great thickness, the one of fourteen feet having no parallel elsewhere.\n\nThe coal produced is semi-bituminous, burns very easily and to a very light ash, having no slack or clinker; it is excellent for blacksmithing, and unexcelled for manufacturing purposes generally, being the very best fuel for generating steam. It is largely furnished for the supplies of New England, the State of New York, for steamship purposes, and to all the Atlantic cities, and is largely exported to the West Indies, the eastern and western coasts of South America, Cailfornia, etc. It is also sent by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and its connections, for manufacturing purposes to Ohio, Indiana, Illnois, and many other Western States. This county has also large supplies of iron ores which are smelted in several large furnaces; many undeveloped beds being a very fine description of ore; also, excellent building materials of limestone and sandstone, and large quantities of hydraulic cement; sandstone suitable for manufacturing glass can be found in large quantities on the suburbs of Cumberland. Fine clay, of a very superior quality, is found and manufactured in immense quantities at Mt. Savage. This county has great and most innumerable water powers, comparatively little used, having only some few grist and saw nillis for local uses only. The climate is pure and healthy. The principal productions are corn, oats, buckwheat, potatoes, butter, hay, wool, liquors, leather, coal and lumber.\n\nJudges – Fourth Judicial Circuit: Hon. Richard H.

It is situated at the confluence of Wills’ Creek with ‘he North Branch of the Potomac River, and on its left bank. The location in a basin or amphitheatre formed by the Wills’ and Knobly ranges of the great Allegany Mountains, completely surrounding it with mountain ranges and peaks, and It is called the “Queen City.” Wills’ Creek here bursts through Wills’ and Dan’s Mountains to join the Potomac, and up the magnificent gap so formed runs the old National Road with its single arched bridge. Here is the superb Queen City Hotel, owned and operated by the Balto. & Ohio Co., from the gallery of which can be seen a pretty yellow stone gothic church, standing on a hill in the heart of the town. Here stood Fort Cumberlnnd, and here wss the rendezvous for Braddock’s expedition.\n\nThe City is on the outer edge of the great coal basin and is connected with it by the Cumberland & Penna R. R., which runs from Cumberland to Piedmont, through the coal basin, and by the Eachart mines branch, which runs from Cumberland to Echart and other mines on the eastern edge of the coal fields. It is the principal shipping point for the celebrated Cumberland coal’. It is near the centre of the main stem of that great National highway the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, 204 miles from river navigation at Parkersburg and. Wheeling, in West Virginia, and, 178 miles from tidewater at Baltimore. The Pittsburgh and Connellaville Branch joins the main stem here and connects it with Pittsburgh, 149 miles, and the oil regions of Pennsylvania. The Bedford and Huntingdon branch of the Pennsylvania Railway connects it. with all important points in central and eastern Pennsylvania,. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal has its western terminus here, and connects it with, tidewater at Georgetown,.in the District, of Columbia, and Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nCumberland is an incorporated town, and is governed by a Mayor and Board of Councilmen, and has a regularly organised police force. The city is lighted with gse, and is furnished with an abundance of Potomac River water by the “Holly System of Fire Protection and Water Supply.” It is well supplied with churches and good schools several church buildins are very handsome, and by their picturesque situation and architectural beauty add greatly tothe appearance of the “Mountain City.” The inhabitants of Cnmberland are industrious and enterprising; they are noted for their hospitality and good morals. The city beingsitnated at an elevation of from six to seven hundred feet above tide level, is free from miasma and its climate pure and healthy. It hss grown rapidly since the war, and now with cheap fuel and cheap iron, offers ununual facilities for the sucessful establishment of all classes or iron manufacture. Persons would do well to further acquaint themselves with its facilities before locating elsewhere. The Cumberland Steel Works, an important enterprise, are located near the city; they manufacture a fine quality of steel, and make tool steel a specialty.

The situation is in a valley of Wills’ Creek, and between two ranges of the Allegany Mountains, making it a beautiful and picturesque location for a town. The climate is healthy, and the land good, varying in price from $5.00 to $200.00 per acre, according to kind and quality. It readily produces 15 bus of wheat, 55 bus. of corn, 25 bus. of oats, and 75 bus of potatoes to the acre. Crops are generally good. We are indebted to the Post Mistress, Mrs. Mary A.

It is situated near the headwaters of George’s Creek, on a plateau letween the Great Savage and Dan’s Mountains of the Allegany Range, seventeen hundred feet above tide. The location and climatic conditions are eminently healthy, and the town is already favorably known as a summer resort, notwithstanding the accommodations have hitherto been confined to private entertainment. Tbe great want is a commodious hotel. The almost universal conclusion is, this is a fine opening for a profitable investment.\n\nThe town is near the centre of the great George’s Creek semi-bituminous coal region, and midway between Cumberiand, Md., and Piedmont, West Va, on the line of the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad, and enjoys quick conneetions with the great trunk line railways, east and west. Frostburg is an incorporated town, governed by a Mayor and a Board of six Councilmen, and hss a resularly organized police force. The town is lighted with gas, and is provided with water from the numerous springs on the eastern slope of the Great Savage Mountain, by means of pipes and reservoirs. It contains fourteen churches the Methodist and Catholic being notable for costliness and fine architectural appearance. Several schools afford excellent educational facilities; two weekly papers provide local news for the people, and two fine halls for the public amusement. The Opera House owned by Thos. H. Paul, is well adapted for all kinds of amusements. Among the stores there are two as stylish establishments as can be found anywhere.\n\nExcepting Virginia City, Nevada, Frostburg probably lies higher above tide than any town of equal size in the United States. This altitude affords a view in all directions, rarely excelled for beauty and sublimity anywhere. Eastward, Dan’s Mountain running northward, breaks off into a defile traversed by the National Pike and Eckbart Branch of the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad. Here nestles the picturesque town of Eckhart, 1 Ç miles from Frostburg, with 1,000 inhabitants. Southward, the great George’s Creek Valley, flanked on the left by Dan’s Mountain, and on the right by the Big Savage, stretches seventeen miles away to the Potomac. Traversed by the Cumberland & Pennsylvania Railroad and George’s Creek, both of which are fronted with dwellings, make nearly a continuous town the entire way. Aside from its material significance, the tourist cannot fail to be impresseed with the scene; every element of nature and handiwork of man being present to lend grandeur and diversity to the prospect. On the west, the rugged precipitous sides of the Great Savage stand like a bulwark, as it is, against the storms of winter. Continuing northward, the mountain maintains its altitude, breaking off to the right in hills and gentle declivities, until the bed of Jennings’ Run is reached. Here another valley opens to view, quite as rich in landscape perspective as the George’s Creek. To the right a ridge rises diversified with fertile farms and umbrageous groves all the way over until we reach Eckhart, our starting point.\n\nStanding on the steps of the JOURNAL office, the eye easily sweeps from the hills of Pennsylvania, across Maryland, over into the mountains of West Virginia. A great part of the town is here spread out at our feet. Not far off the site of Braddock’s route to Fort DuQuesne, surveyed by Washington, is visible. A monument of that disastrous expedition still stands just outside the corporate limits, noting, it is said, the first day’s march from Fort Cumland-eleven miles. Six miles by air-line to the south-east, Dan’s Rock towers high and rugged, overlooking the most extended and varied landscape in all this section. From this point Frostburg and Cumberland are plainly seen; the mountains in all directions, the Potomac and its magnificent bottom-lands, farm houses and railroad, comprise a “bird’s eye view” which no one can ever wholly forget. The tourist to this section who has not visited Dan’s Rock has no conception of the wonderful features with which this region abounds. In short, no town of the size and prominence of Frostburg enjoys in its surroundings a more unique topography; and no point of this region array of imposing projections furnishes a more interesting outlook than Dan’s Rock.\n\nIf to these we add the novelty of our industrial avocations, the salubrity of our atmosphere and purity of our water, we have a series of conditions, which, properly estimated, must sooner or later give the town a commanding prominence as a summer resort. The inhabitants of Frostburg and vicinity are mainly miners of foreign birth or extraction-made up of English, Welsh, Scotch, Irish, German, etc; they comprise an industrious, thrifty and intelligent population; of good morals and studious habits, they will compare favorably with any people anywhere. To them the town owes its extraordinary growth since the war, and the coal region its immense development. We are indebted to I. B. Oder, Editor “Journal,” for this sketch and other favors. C. H.

R. R.) and 18 by a good pike. It is 8 miles fom Piedmont, W.Va, and 34 from Cumberland by B. & O. Railroad. The location Is pleasant and climate good. The George’s Creek valley narrows here to a glen, with steep rocky spurs of the Allegany Mountains. There are two parallel mountain ridges which blank the George’s Creek valley. This Is an important mining town; there are four companies operating ten openings, capable of producing 27,036 tons per week, and a much larger amount if the demand was sufficient. All the land in the vicinity is owned by the coal companIes, and can be had for $15 to $40 per acre, for agricultural; coal land at from $500 to $1000. The land is generally broken, with a small amount that is productive, which is very valuable. The buckwheat, hay and potatoes grown on these lands are o! the best quality. It mostly produces 10 bus. wheat, 25 bus. c3ra, 20 bus. oats, 200 bus potatoes, 20 bus rye, 15 bus buckwheat and 1 1/2 tons of hay, per acre. The timbered land is alight growth of oak, pine, spruce, maple, chestnut and walnut There are five good pubilc schools. George’s Creek supplies plenty of cool water. Wm. McIndoe, Postmaster.

SAVAGE\n\nIs on the Cumberland & Penna Railroad, nine miles N.W. of Cumberland; the village is situated on surrounding hills, 100 to 300 ft. above the railroad tracks, which are in a valley, making the altitude over 1500 ft above sea level. The climate is especially fine and healthy. Most all the officers of the Union Mining Co. and of the C. & P.R. R. live here. The population of Mt Savage is fully up to business requirements. The land is good for potatoes, grain, &c. All the available farming land is cleared. The timbered land is well cut out and thinned; white oak, black oak, red oak, chestnut, sugar maple, hickory, locust, with some white pine yet standing. Land sells exclusive of mineral rights from $200 to $400 per acre and produces an average crop, which is generally good. Mt. Savage first became worthy of note by the erection of a rolling mill in 1839 and two blast furnaces in 1840. The first operations were carried on by a company of Engilsh capitalists, but subsequently the property changed hands and was operated by the Mt Savage Iron Company,” an essentially American concern. In the Mt Savage Mill were rolled the first rails made on the Western Continent; in honor of which a medal was awarded by the “Franklin Institute.” For a number years these iron works, alternately prosperous and struggling against adverse circumstances, gave employment to a large number of operatives; population of Mt. Savage being then something over 4,000 souls. In the mill was closed. At the blast furnace several subsequent attempts were made to compete with more modern furnaces; but at present they too are lying in idleness. Of the rolling mill scarcely a trace is now visible, as as been dismantled to make room tor other works. The present industries from which Mt Ravage derives its life, are: The manutacture of fire brick (began as early as 1842), iron and brass foundries and the minnig of coal and fire clay; all operated by the Union Mining Co. operated by McGowan, Wright & Co. of Pittsburg, James Skelding, Sup’t, here manufacture by a new process merchantable pig iron furnace slack and cinder; they employ a number of operativess. On the site of the old rolling mill are being erected new and enlarged works;or the manufacture of fire brick and other clay ware, which are expected to be occupied by the beginning of 18′;S. The old brick works will then be dismantled. There is one public and one private school. St. George’s Episcopal Church, Rev. J. W. Nott; M. B., Rev. H. Clay Smith; St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic, Rev.

Old Town is one of the oldest towns in this county, its ancient name being Leipton. A house is yet standing that was used as a fort by members of the Cresap family to fight the Indians. This family were the first settlers here, one only still living, Luther Martin Cresap, Farmer and Miller; he is now an old man, married, but has no children or near relatives. The Lantz family is also an old family; the only good house in the village is a large brick one, built by them in 1811; there are a great many members of thia family still living here and throughout this county and in Virginia. The village contains a new and neat Methodist Church, Rev. Mr. McDonel, Pastor, and one public school.

At its northern extremity it lies immediately opposite to and is connected with Baltimore City by a draw-bridge about a mile long. Iron ore abounds in the northern part of the county.\n\nThis county is of a rolling character, but has no very elevated points, and, like most of the other counties, has all descriptions of soil. Below Annapolis there is generally a stiffer soil, and mostly an excellent fertile country, and very productive in tobacco and grain. The lands along South and West Rivers are the chief grain producing sections, while those in the upper and central portions of the county are noted for their fine fruits and vegetables The country between Annapolis and Baltimore is almost entirely cultivated in truck gardens, and sends to the Baltimore markets a large proportion of their finest supplies, producing immense quantities of strawberries, peas, cucumbers, tomatoes, cantaloupes, watermelons, cabbages, &c. This section is highly adapted for this purpose, being mostly a light soil, easily tilled, and, being protected by the elevated lands north of Baltimore, is several days earlier in ripening crops than the soils around the north of the city The timbers are principally oaks, chestnut, and pines. There are some fisheries in the county though not very extensive, but oysters abound around all the shores south from Sandy Point, and also wild fowl in the season.\n\nJudge Fifth Judicial Circuit-Hon.

The Annapolis & Elkridge H. B., 21 miles long, connects it with Baltimore and Washington by rail, and it is in daily eommunication by steamers with Baltimore and other points on the bay and its tributaries. Annapolis was founded about 1649. The settlement was at first called Providence, afterward Anne Arundeltown; and lastly, having received a city charter in 1705, Annapolis, (i.e. “the city of Anne,”) in honor of Queen Anne, who bestowed several valuable presents on the town, giving an organ to one of their churches, &C The State House where meets the Legislature and the Court of Appeals, is a fine old building, and is located on a beautiful elevation in full view of the bay and near the centre of the city. The State Legislature meets biennially in January, and the Court of Appeals holds its sessions from October to July, with a short intermission in the spring. The U.S. Naval Academy; St. John’s College, (a State institution), one of the oldest in the country, and St. Mary’s Seminary for priests, (Roman Catholic), are situated here. The city contains large and well attended Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian, Lutheran and Roman Catholic Churches, also a bank, a market house, 4 newspapers and 4 printing offices, and four good hotels. The Maryland Hotel and the City Hotel are the head-quarters for the sons of Md. when they come biennially to legislate for the State, and lively old times they have in this ancient city during the time of the sitting of the State Legislature, which holds its sessions daily for three months. Annapolis is an incorporated town and is governed by a mayor and board of aldermen, and has a regular police force. The city is lighted with gas and is supplied with plenty of good water. It has a convenient and well protected harbor. Vessels of the largest size anchor with safety in Annapolis Roads, and during the winter of 1877, when access to Baltimore was prevented by the ice, numbers of vessels-many of them foreign barques, sought and found shelter in the harbor of Annapolis. Oyster packing, during eight months of the year, is the principal trade of the place, and the citic contains several large establishments for this trade. During the summer the Annapolis Canning Company is busily engaged in putting up fruit and vegetables, dile fly peaches, peas and tomatoes. The citizens of Annapolis are industrious and enterprising, and are noted for their morality and hospitality. The elty is healthy and presents many attractions for tourists, pleasure seekers and those wanting homes. Population 10,000. W. O. Bigelow, Postmaster.\n\nSTRANGER’s GUIDE TO INTERESTING PARTS.-The State House, built of Imported brick. In it are, the Senate Chamber as it was when General Washington resigned; the Executive Chamber, with portraits of all former governors; the State Library and the Court of Appeals. At the foot of the State House Hill are the Treasurer’s Office, where the provisional legislators met before the erection of the State House; the Comptroller’s Office, the Land, Office, containing the recerds of the Colonial Government, and the Office of the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal, where are found archives under the autograph of General Washingtori, when Vice-President of the Potomac Company. Gubernatorial Residence, a splendid modernly built edifice, finished February, 1870, is opposite. United States Naval Academy, founded October 10th 1845 under the Presidency of James K. Polk, is beautifully situated on some fifty acres of ground, fronting Severn River. As an institution for the acquisition of naval knowledge it has, without a doubt, no superior in the world. To visitors it is open from 7 a. m., to 10 p.m. Music on the lawn from 9 to 10 a. m., and from 5 to 7p.m. United States Naval Hospital, on “Strawberry Hill,” is connected with the academy ground by a bridge, and accommodates over three hundred patients. United States Naval Cemetery, on said property, is also a place worthy of note. St. John’s College, founded 1784, endowed by Maryland, adjoins the Naval Academy. It has three large public halls, extensive grounds, a front on Severn River for bathing and boating. A preparatory department Is attached, which qualifies students also for other high schools. The Faculty numbers eleven of the best talent in the country. Average attendance 200 pupils. Churches-there are St. Anne’s Episcopal, Presbyterian, First and Second Methodist and the St. Mary’s (Catholic.) The latter Is built on the estate of John Carroll of Carrollton, and with it is connected a college for the education of ecclesiastics.\n\nBENEVOLENT SOCIETIES–A.F.& A.
