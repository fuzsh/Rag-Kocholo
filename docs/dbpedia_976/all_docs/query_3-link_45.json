        "text": "In the Town of Bovina where the Andes-Delhi Road (Rt. 28) crosses the Little Delaware River, Saint James Church stands on one side of the bridge, and a cluster of houses known locally as “The Hook” stands on the other. According to one tradition the area is called “The Hook” due to the sharp curves of the old highway as it approached the bridge over the river. Another tradition claims “The Hook” received its name from the short drink the coachmen had at the tavern while their horses were being changed.\n\nTradition holds that the present Saint James Church stands at the entrance of the Gerry family’s Lake Delaware Farm because of some tardy children. One summer morning, after a late start, the Gerry family was hurrying to get to Saint John’s Church in Delhi in time for Sunday School. Commodore Gerry was exasperated at the delay and as the family reached the foot of Lake Delaware Road, pointing to where Saint James would one day stand, he said, “I wish there were a Church here, then perhaps you children would get to Sunday School on time.”\n\nYears later, during the summer of 1913, Miss Mabel Gerry began a series of missionary meetings in “The Hook,” held in the homes of Earl and Amy Fisk and Roscoe Brown. During the summer, Miss Mabel became a familiar figure in “The Hook” and the surrounding countryside as she went about with her large notebook giving instructions and laying plans for the establishment of a mission congregation.\n\nIn the spring of 1914, a small house in “The Hook” was leased and prepared for use as a house of worship. Partitions were removed, a stove was installed for heating, and an Altar made of hard yellow pine helped convert the house into a chapel. The first service was held in the chapel on Palm Sunday, April 5, 1914, by the Rev. William A. Long who had been engaged to serve as a priest for the mission congregation. The second Bishop of Albany, the Rt. Rev. Richard Nelson, was present for the first Confirmation Service on Sunday, November 3, 1914.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Miss Angelica Gerry, sister of Miss Mabel, secured the services of the eminent and prolific American church architect, Ralph Adams Cram of Boston, to design the group of buildings of the present Saint James Church. Work was begun in spring of 1922. On Saint James’ Day, July 25th, 1922, the Bishop Coadjutor-elect, George Ashton Oldham, laid the corner stone. The Parish Hall and the Rectory were designed and built in 1924, completing our campus.\n\nThe first services were held in the new Chapel building by the Rev. Octavius Edgelow during October 1923. The Bishop of Albany, the Rt. Rev. Richard Nelson and his Coadjutor, the Rt. Rev. George Oldham were present on Saint James Day, 1924, for the Consecration of the Chapel.\n\nThe founders of Saint James Church continued missionary activity in the surrounding Delaware County communities of Andes, Bovina, Delhi, and beyond. Angelica Gerry sent many young men and women to college, paid for medical help for local families, paid for women to obtain midwifery education, and salaried a full-time parish nurse to help with community medical needs. Lake Delaware money also helped found Saint Paul's Episcopal Church in Bloomville, Saint Mary's Episcopal Church in Downsville, All Saints Episcopal Church in Shinhopple, and Saint Margaret's Episcopal Church in Margaretville.\n\nUntil her death in 1930 Mabel Gerry Drury was, through her personal work and teaching, conscientious in her work for Saint James Church.\n\nFrom the time of the construction of Saint James Church as a memorial to her mother and grandfather until her own death in 1960, Miss Angelica Gerry took an active part in the life of Saint James’ congregation. She was known throughout the countryside for her many acts of charity.\n\nWhile stones and mortar alone do not make a Church, the buildings of Saint James stand as a witness to the faith of its founders and the devotion of its members.\n\nConstructed of Catskill bluestone taken from local fences, Indiana limestone, and boasting a slate roof, Saint James Church is a Cram design influenced by the 12th Century Saint Mary’s Church, Iffley, Oxford, England. This transitional period incorporated late Romanesque as well as early Gothic themes as is obvious when one considers the eastern and western windows in Saint James. The interior walls are of white plaster, applied with a mason’s trowel giving it a wavy surface but a smooth texture. The broach roof spire was added to the massive central tower upon the insistence of Miss Angelica Gerry.\n\nOften described by visitors as “peaceful” and “awe-inspiring”, our buildings are a local treasure. Our main altar is adorned by a carving of the Lamb of God by the Italian artist Pelegrini and is flanked by a breath-taking polychrome wood carving representing the Incarnation and the Epiphany. Below it, in gold lettering, is carved the text from the Nicene Creed “He was Incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary and was made man.”\n\nOur side chapel, richly decorated with blue and gold banding, bears a 13th century Florentine painting of the Enthronement of Mary rendered on wood covered in plaster.\n\nHigh above the nave a niche in the wall houses a wooden 15th century German statue of Saint James the Great, our main patron saint. Saint James was one of the three favored disciples of Jesus, along with Peter and John, and was present at his Transfiguration on Mount Tabor. James was the first of the Apostles to be martyred as described in Acts 12:2.\n\nA statue of our other patron, the brilliant and saintly Queen Margaret of Scotland (d. 1093), is featured above the main altar.\n\nTo the left of the intricately carved pulpit, which contains symbols of the Gospels, is a statue based on that of Our Lady of Walsingham in England. This was hand carved in Italy and was given by family and friends in memory of parishioner John Philip Baker in 2002. The May Crown for Our Lady of Walsingham Shrine was given to the greater glory of Almighty God, in honor of our Lord’s Blessed Mother, and by John Loseth in memory of Ferne Paulus Loseth.\n\nWhen the church opened in 1923 it contained a small pipe organ built by Clark and Fenton of Nyack, NY. This was replaced with an electronic substitute in 1979. In 1999, a pipe organ built by M. P. Moller in 1948, their Opus 7663, was located through the Organ Clearing House and purchased by the church. The instrument was restored and enlarged by the Chase Organ Company of Worcester, NY, and was consecrated by the Rt. Rev. David Ball on Saint James' Day, 2005.\n\n​"
