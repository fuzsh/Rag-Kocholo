        "text": "CS Design was formed in 2008 to fill the need for responsive, non-partial, lighting design consultation in the field of architecture. Approaching lighting design from the perspective of the architect and the designer, CS Design seeks to complement and elevate architectural designs with a simple and integrated approach.\n\nCS Design has won numerous awards for their architectural and interiors projects ranging from high end residential to institutional and commercial building. Project experience in urban design and exterior illumination broadens our field of expertise. From specialized local installations to large scale project coordination, we bring technical design and project management skills to bear on all aspects of lighting, materials choice, detailing, and controls.\n\nCS Design welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with architects, designers, engineers and planners. Complementing the skills of core team members, we offer various services to perfect building lighting and streamline project delivery, such as lighting and control design, fixture specification, detail integration, full-scale modeling, lighting calculations, simulations for daylighting, LEED lighting credit verification, budget estimation, installation coordination, commissioning and focus.\n\nConor Sampson, the founding associate, is a lighting designer and a registered architect. He teaches lighting design at McGill University and is the Canadian Liaison to ISO (International Standards Organization) Technical Committee 274 (Lighting). Mr. Sampson holds a Masterâ€™s degree in Lighting Design from the Parsons School of Design and a Bachelor of Architecture from McGill University. He has practiced in New York, Washington, DC, and Montreal."
