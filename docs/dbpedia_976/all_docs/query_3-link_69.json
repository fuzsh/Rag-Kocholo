        "text": "It is, and seemingly always has been, nearly a single estate, nowadays owned by the 22nd Baron Clinton, the seventh earliest Barony in England, created in 1298. An unusual one too, created by ‘writ’ so it can be inherited through daughters as well as sons and can jump between families and generations as if playing three dimensional Tetris, only more complicated. It can also go to sleep for a period (called being in ‘abeyance’) until a suitable hombre moseys up.\n\nBit like Sleeping Beauty, only without the beauty… and no prince, only a Baron… who are usually evil in fairy tales…\n\nOh dear…\n\nSo the church is an ‘estate church’ and very much a preserve of the Clintons. Happily for us, back in 1873, one of them had formidable taste and hired one of the premier church architects of the day, GE Street, to rebuild the little church. Which he did, rather well too.\n\nStreet was one of the big lads of the Victorian Gothic Revival, a highlight of Victorian art that popped up in churches all over. He rejected the love of decoration of some of his peers and…\n\nAnd suddenly we are in a wonderland of golden browns, a beautifully proportioned space too.\n\nLook if you may at how the pillar on the right is so much thinner than the arches springing away above it, turning what could be a heaviness into a lightness. Especially note how the rounded capitals bring the arches to a near full stop, letting them just hang there, seemingly unsupported. If anything, the pillar is elegantly descending from the arch rather than supporting it.\n\nThen the grain of the stone, Ham Stone from Somerset, carefully chosen to lead the eye towards the chancel where the main event will be, the celebration of Mass.\n\nThe colouring of the pews calls for attention too. This is a well thought through church.\n\nI do not know what it is with major Victorian architects and fonts, they seem to see every one as a personal challenge to their bling virility, and do so insist on delivering the most glorious confections; this one does not disappoint either. Here we are with a wedding cake of Devon marble and carved limestone, and just look at the way the marble columns are contained in their limestone ends like steam punk vacuum tubes, with the lower containers nestling into the plinth but not part of it, slotted in there like a… vacuum tube!\n\nAnd then there is the font itself.\n\nOr look at this honey, so easily passed by, after all a doorway is just a doorway is it not… ? Well, no, especially if it is a Street door (sorry, who could resist that?).\n\nThe colours go without saying, ethereal meets magic… the hoodmould (the moulding over the top of the door), beautifully arched ending in little twirls, but it is quite shallow arched too, plumpish.\n\nThere is a subtle play-off between that and the actual doorway arch, which seems a little narrower, and subtly intensified by the series of almost painterly carved arches floating away from the actual door.\n\nThen the darker door colour brings out the shape of the carved stone; equally importantly the use of straight planking, clear and simple, contrasts and intensifies the effect of the stone grain leaping away like sun rays through the arch stonework.\n\nThe hoodmould also elegantly forms a transition line, where the stone grain changes direction to the horizontal on the wall stonework.\n\nIt is not just great design either, because stone is strongest when the pressure falls directly to the grain, not at an angle to it, so by carving and laying the archway stones in this way they take the compression of all the stones above the arch on their strongest ‘tribute’ or direction.\n\nThis is really very good, the proportions and the curving, the stonework and the subtle bits of carving. It could almost be a watercolour painting. Mind you, probably not always easy to recognise unless you have spent far too long gazing at walls and arches; far, far, far too long.\n\nSometimes, when I join in conversations, I realise that I have left it much too late to join the human race… Hey ho, always got the stone to chat with…\n\nThough to be honest, even that sometimes starts politely edging away from me…\n\nAnd for more carefully considered design work take a gander at this window arch. The main shape is sharply defined by the hoodmould placed so close to the window surrounding forming a strong band of shadow.\n\nBut then inside this is another pair of arches, with another bank of shadow between them, that intensify the arch again, and these die into the walls unlike the hoodmould that has sharply carved ends.\n\nWhy? My guess is that the window surround needs to play equally with the actual window tracery, which would grab all the attention for itself without Street boy’s intervention. The whole thing would be out of balance, and leave us with a kind of blah feeling.\n\nPlus, and this is probably just as true if not more so, Street just so loved painting with stone. What a painter, too.\n\nThe rest of the Sanctuary? Both subdued and glowy, the honey stone, the mosaic at the back of the altar, the altar cloth and the tiles, along with the stained glass. Nothing in your face, just gently rich, wonderfully rich.\n\nBless my little golden heart, it is marvellous everyday genius.\n\nBeautifully capturing both sadness and hope, anxiety and love, this Christ brims with heart. He will lay down his life for the sinners of this world, the same sinners who will crucify him both literally and metaphorically. Why, even Peter (the ‘who, me?’ dude on the right) is going to deny him thrice, and the rest of the disciples are going to be filled with despair as if they have not listened to a word he has said.\n\nAnd as Paul says, it is equally about a new covenant, a new realisation that Christ brings; that forgiveness and love is the Divine, that we do not earn it, it is unconditional. It is, if you like, the universe’s Divine code.\n\nPow! Suddenly a sweet little mosaic has turned into a burning spear. Oh my clever, clever artist, you are a talent…"
