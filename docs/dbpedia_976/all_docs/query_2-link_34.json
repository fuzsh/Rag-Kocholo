        "text": "Georgian London. 18th – 19th century (up to 1837).\n\nThis period is characterized by serious expansion in the city: new roads, canals, and bridges. It is a time of peace and prosperity. Previous century was bloody, end of the century was the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The Georgian period is dedicated to eh Hanoverian dynasty. Before this time the baroque style of classicism had dominated but the Georgian period sees the return of the Palladian style and is more calm than baroque’s emotional exuberance. This period is also the birth of modern housing, standardization. There are specific rates of residential housing: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. There are entire streets of Georgian housing in two specific areas of London: St. James, the very aristocratic; Soho, more common, during the 19th century a slum and revived in the 20th century with a bohemian culture.\n\n1. LONDON UNDERGROUND BUILDING (above St. James Station). 1929. Charles Holden.\n\nThis was considered London’s first skyscraper. It is classical in proportion but stretched out tall! Sculptures of Night and Day by Upstine along with the headlong winds sculptures.\n\n2. QUEEN ANNE’S GATE. 1705-1770.\n\nThis is a street of Georgian houses in various styles with red brick window dressings. The 1705’s have grotesque masked faces (Italian sources). This becomes a no-no by the middle of the century. Porches on the 1705’s are rare. More delight in craftsmanship in the 1705’s. The 1705’s have a cornice and plaster brick sky separator. The mid 1700’s are not timber fronted. The growing fire precautions means that the later 1700’s had more recessed windows. The 1705’s are more narrow and tall. The round arched windows with a fan light are more characteristic of the late 1700s. Neo-Georgian architecture comes back to life between the world wars. The “piano nobile” (Italian) becomes a component of most houses, an emphasis on the first flood because that’s where the receiving room was in the house, popular during the 1730’s and 40s.\n\n3. ST. JAMES PARK. 1530. Andre Mollet.\n\nThe park began as a Royal chase or hunting ground. 1820 John Nash plans the park over again during the Regency period (George III goes crazy. The Regent was who becomes George IV; why the period is called Regency period). This park really distinguishes England in landscape architecture, even over France. Capability Brown is another landscape architect during the period. Buckingham palace also by Nash, existing building is Edwardian.\n\nTHE FRIARY COURT or ST. JAMES PALACE. early 16th century.\n\nBuilt in the tudor gothic style.\n\n4. SPENCER HOUSE. 1752. John Vardy. 27 Saint James’s Place London, Greater London.\n\nVery Palladian. It was built as a private palace, a Georgian townhouse. It has an engaged portico with greek gods crowing its top. The use of villa style in a residential rather than country setting. The piano nobile is very evident in Spencer House. Rustication is obvious in this house: smooth or rough/craggy. The rustication is usually on the ground floor or basement to create a feel of strength and raw manliness. The ashlar is smooth stone.\n\n5. BOODLE’S CLUB. 18th century. 28 St James’s Street London, Greater London.\n\nA gentleman’s club with a venetian window that distinguishes this house as very Palladian.\n\n6. BROOK’S CLUB. 60A St. James’s Street St. James’s, London.\n\nClassical style. There are no arches in ancient Greek and Roman building.\n\n7. ECONOMIST PLAZA. 1940s. Allison and Peter Smithson. 25 St James’s Street St. James’s, London.\n\nSteel framed buildings, very modern, but they are relating back to the Georgian style. It exhibits a hidden kind of piano nobile. It is built of portland stone but not the same as what we’ve seem before, this is pitted and cavernous. The verticals are reminiscent of pilasters. The informal piazza or courtyard is classical feeling.\n\n8. ST. JAMES SQUARE. 18th century houses, this house (on the right in picture) is from 1765. James Stuart.\n\nJames Stuart went to Greece to see the Parthenon and speculate about it before bringing the style back to England. This house is a Georgian townhouse with very clear classical precedence. This house characterizes a turning away from Renaissance era back toward ancient Greece.\n\n9. REGENT’S STREET.\n\nThis street is the north/south connector for London. John Nash originally rebuilt it during the Edwardian period. It is a processional route.\n\n10. OUR LADY OF THE ASSUMPTION and ST. GREGORY CATHOLIC CHURCH. 1730. Bavarian Embassy. Warwick Street London, Greater London.\n\n1830’s marks the Catholic emancipation. The church is very modest and quaint, more like a house than a church. It is apparently attempting to be non-threatening. It was a non-conformist church until the late 19th century. The east side was rebuilt in 1875.\n\n11. DUFOURS STREET.\n\n# 1-6 exhibits vertical living in the 1960s. I was called “The William Blake House”, considered rude in its Georgian surroundings.\n\nthe 70s brings to life a movement when people desired to protect old buildings just for history’s sake.\n\n#16 is by Quentin Terry and is a return to Georgian architecture.\n\n12. MEARD STREET.\n\nMore baroque gives way to Palladian style.\n\n13. GOURMET BURGER.\n\ngothic revival in window style. Augustus Pugin was responsible for the gothic revival.\n\n14. ST. ANNE’S WORKHOUSE.\n\nThis workhouse was the result of the “parish poor relief” movement. The awful work conditions of the times made churches want to help more. The more liberal side said: get government help!\n\n15. ST. BARNABAS CHURCH. Holden Road, Woodside Park, London.\n\nThis was an anglican church that attempted to help the poor. The chapel attached to St. Anne’s poorhouse next door. The brick layering is sometimes called “streaky bacon” or polychromatic stone schemes. It is an example of high Victorian gothic revival. It has tiny flying buttresses.\n\n16. SOHO SQUARE. 1677.\n\nThis is an example of a Georgian square. The area is traditionally a very Irish spot. St. Patrick’s church is very big. It is now a multicultural spot. At the center of the square is a vernacular house, a welcoming sense."
