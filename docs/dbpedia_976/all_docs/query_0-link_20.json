        "text": "The Georgian North 1714 to 1799\n\nThe Georgian era stretches from 1714 to 1838, although the early part of the nineteenth century is also known as the Regency period. Georgian times saw the onset of Industrial Revolution, world exploration and distinct styles of architecture.\n\n👈 Queen Anne | Timeline |19th Century 👉\n\nAug 1, 1714 – KING GEORGE I\n\nThe German speaking, King George I, ascends to the throne of Great Britain as the first king of what will be known as the House of Hanover and the first monarch of the ‘Georgian’ age, named from a succession of four kings all called George. His maternal grandmother, Elizabeth, was the sister of King Charles I, the king who was executed in 1649. Elizabeth had married Frederick V, the Elector Palatine of the Rhine and King of Bohemia. King George’s mother, Sophia, was married to Ernest Augustus, the Elector of Hanover.\n\n1714 – Morpeth clock tower\n\nMorpeth clock tower is built to the designs of the famed architect Vanbrugh. Morpeth was one of the towns that will welcome the Jacobites in 1715, with some men joining up with the Jacobite army when they enter the town.\n\nNov 1715 – Geordies or Jacobites?\n\nGeorge I, a German Protestant, who speaks not a word of English was crowned king of England in 1714 despite objections from Scottish (and some English) ‘Jacobite’ rebels who support James Stuart, the ‘Old Pretender’. Leading rebel, the Northumbrian Tom Forster of Bamburgh, leads an army of mostly Scottish Jacobites into England. Every Northumberland town seems to support him except for Newcastle which declares for King George. Newcastle folk will then supposedly come to be known as ‘Geordies‘ (though in truth this seems to be a myth, as the term appears to have originated as a word for a North East miner). The Jacobite army were later defeated at Preston in Lancashire.\n\n1716 – Capability Brown born\n\nThe famed future landscape gardener Lancelot Brown who will come to be known as ‘Capability Brown’ is born at Kirkharle in Northumberland.\n\n1717 – Wear Commissioners\n\nThe River Wear Commissioners are established at Sunderland to improve navigation into the port. Much dredging is required as sandbanks are a particular problem.\n\n1719 – Sunderland a separate parish\n\n‘Old Sunderland’ near the mouth of the river achieves the status of a separate parish and a church is built for this new jurisdiction. Old Sunderland was previously part of Bishopwearmouth and the whole town area was most commonly known as Wearmouth at the time rather than Sunderland, though Sunderland does seem to have been used an alternative name for the town and particularly the port.\n\n1720 – Alum making\n\nJohn Cookson established an alum chemical works in South Shields. The same site will later manufacture glue, sulphate of soda, soap and glass.\n\n1720 – Steel making\n\nAmongst the many thriving industries in the North East at this time is steel making. It was during this decade that the still-surviving Derwentcote Steel making furnace was built in north west Durham.\n\n1720 – Durham Mustard\n\nA Mrs Clements of Durham City has developed the distinct English blend of mustard. King George I will become one of her keenest customers. Durham will develop into a centre for mustard making and continue to be so until the end of the nineteenth century when the recipe and its manufacture passes to a company in Norwich.\n\n1720 – Shipbuilder defies Newcastle\n\nRobert Wallis begins building ships in South Shields despite fierce opposition from the town of Newcastle which threatened to seize his first ship as soon as it enters the Tyne. A legal battle ensues which Wallis wins.\n\n1722 – Customs official found dead\n\nThe body of a customs official has been found dead on St Mary’s Island near Whitley Bay close to a spot called Smugglers Creek.\n\n1722 – Ridley mines\n\nThe White Ridley family take over mines at Hartford and Plessey in south east Northumberland and will begin the construction of a quay at Blyth. The mines at Plessey are linked to Blyth by the Plessey wagonway, a wooden railway in use since at least 1709 that seems to date back to the 1690s.\n\n1723 – The Lang Pack\n\nA gang of burglars attempt to break into Lee Hall in Tynedale after one disguised as a pedlar leaves a parcel – a long pack – containing one of their number with the house servants while the owners of the house are away. The intention was for the pack’s occupant to break free later that evening and allow his accomplices into the hall. The servants take in the package but become suspicious and fire a shotgun at the package killing the man inside, before alerting the authorities. The deceased would-be burglar is buried at Bellingham churchyard.\n\n1724 – Daniel Defoe in Newcastle\n\nIn his Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain the writer Daniel Defoe described Newcastle as a “spacious, extended, infinitely populous place”. He describes the Tyne as “a noble, large and deep river” and goes on to say: “They build ships here to perfection, I mean as to strength and firmness, and to bear the sea; and as the coal trade occasions a demand for such strong ships, a great many are built here.”\n\n1724 – Houses on the Tyne Bridge\n\nWriter, Daniel Defoe, visiting Newcastle, noted that the houses clustered across the bridge at Newcastle resemble those of London.\n\n1725 – Tanfield Railway\n\nThe Tanfield Railway, a colliery wagonway in northern Durham opens.\n\n1727 – Causey Arch\n\nThe Causey Arch railway bridge is built for the Tanfield Railway across the Causey Burn Dene.\n\n1727 – Pit disaster at Lumley Park\n\nA colliery disaster at Lumley Park near Chester-le-Street claims sixty lives.\n\n1727 – Guiding lights at Shields\n\nThe old low lights are built at North Shields for the guidance of ships entering the Tyne. They are initially lit by three tallow candles and later by oil lamps.\n\nJune 11, 1727 – KING GEORGE II\n\nGeorge II becomes King of Britain following the death of his father, King George I, who died at Osnabuck in Lower Saxony. Although, unlike his father, the new king can speak English, he still prefers Germany to Britain.\n\n1729 – Seaton Delaval Hall\n\nSeaton Delaval Hall, built by Sir John Vanbrugh from around 1718, for Admiral Lord Delaval, is completed around this time. The architectural style is English Baroque, based on the Palladian style.\n\n1730 – Rokeby Hall\n\nSir Thomas Robinson of Rokeby Park encloses his land and builds a park at Rokeby near Barnard Castle. His new house is built in a neo-Palladian style.\n\n1732 – Sedgefield racing\n\nHorse racing is held at Sedgefield.\n\n1735 – Stockton Town House\n\nThe Town House or ‘Town Hall’ at Stockton-on-Tees is built. Further additions are made in 1744.\n\n1736 – New teeth\n\nAn allegedly 108-year-old woman in Bishop Auckland is supposed to have received a new set of teeth this year.\n\n1736 – Bourne’s Newcastle history\n\nHenry Bourne published his extensive History of Newcastle.\n\n1736 – Bedlington Iron Works\n\nAn iron works is established at Bedlington by Cumberland man William Thomlinson, who built dams on the River Blyth to power the mills for his works.\n\n1739 – Gibbeting near Whitley Bay\n\nThe body of a Seaton Sluice glassworker, Michael Curry who murdered a local pub landlord at nearby Hartley was left hanging and tarred on the coast near St Mary’s Island at a place that will come to be known as Curry’s Point.\n\n1739 – Dick Turpin hanged\n\nThe famed Yorkshire highwayman Dick Turpin is hanged for murder at the Knavesmire in York.\n\n1739 – The old Newcastle Journal\n\nA newspaper called the Newcastle Journal is established and will continue to be published until 1788 (the present day Newcastle Journal is a different newspaper and dates from 1832).\n\n1740 – Cambo\n\nThe village of Cambo, is built as a model village for the estate workers, of nearby Wallington Hall in Northumberland.\n\nJune 9, 1740 – Newcastle riot\n\nA riot breaks out in Newcastle over rising corn prices. The militia opens fire, killing one. Seven men are later transported.\n\nApril 17, 1741 – Farmer’s wife kills children\n\nA farmer’s wife called Charlton went berserk at a farm near Fishburn, killing her 14-year-old son with a cleaver before killing her two younger children. She then took her own life stabbing herself below the ear. All this happened while her husband was trying to get a cow out of a ditch. The coroner recorded a verdict of lunacy.\n\nMay 1742 – John Wesley at Newcastle\n\nJohn Wesley, the founder of Methodism, preaches at Newcastle and records: “I was surprised; so much drunkenness, cursing and swearing, even from mouths of little children, do I never remember to have seen and heard before on so small a compass of time.” Newcastle will become one of his favourite places to preach.\n\n1743 – Salt pans galore\n\nThere are an extraordinary 200 salt pans at South Shields used in the noxious manufacture of salt.\n\n1743 – Soldier knighted on battlefield\n\nSoldier, Tom Brown, who becomes Sir Tom Brown is a national hero after losing his fingers recovering his regiment’s standard at the Battle of Dettingen in Bavaria. He is personally knighted on the battlefield by King George II. Brown, who was born in Kirkleatham is a resident of Yarm.\n\nJan 1744 – Pirates seize ships\n\nA ship called The Thomas and Margaret of Sunderland along with a brigantine from Berwick are seized by the pirate crew of a privateer ship off Alnmouth.\n\nFeb 1745 – Wesley lost in snowstorm\n\nPreacher John Wesley found himself stranded in a ferocious snow storm on Gateshead Fell, describing it as one of his roughest journeys.\n\n1745 – No Jacobite support\n\nScottish Jacobites supporting Bonnie Prince Charlie rebel against George II. There is little North East support so the Jacobites march south through Cumbria, avoiding troops stationed at Framwellgate Moor and Newcastle. The Jacobites later retreat and will be defeated at Culloden.\n\n1747 – Pickled parson\n\nThe Reverend of Sedgefield, John Garnage passed away in the second week of December 1747 only a matter of days before tithes were to be collected in his name for the upkeep of the parish.
