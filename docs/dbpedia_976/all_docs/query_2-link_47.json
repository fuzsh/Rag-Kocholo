        "text": "Mystery Worshipper: Andy the Albanian\n\nChurch: St James\n\nLocation: King Street, Sydney, Australia\n\nDate of visit: Sunday, 8 February 2009, 11:00am\n\nWhat was the name of the service?\n\nChoral Eucharist.\n\nHow full was the building?\n\nAbout a third to half full, maybe 100 in the congregation, and another 35-40 in the choir, altar party and other supporting roles. There's a family service at 9.00, so this was an older crowd.\n\nDid anyone welcome you personally?\n\nA friendly smile and \"Hello, welcome\" as I was handed the hymnbook and service booklets.\n\nWas your pew comfortable?\n\nIt was fine, although I noticed at least one parishioner using his kneeler for a bit of extra padding.\n\nHow would you describe the pre-service atmosphere?\n\nIt was pretty quiet, although being high summer all the doors were open and there was some traffic noise.\n\nWhat were the exact opening words of the service?\n\n\"Good morning and welcome to St James King Street.\"\n\nWhat books did the congregation use during the service?\n\nNew English Hymnal (melody edition – English churches that don't think any of the punters can read music, please note), a folded A4 sheet with the order of the choral eucharist, and a 12 page A5 booklet combining the variable items for the day and the week's newsletter.\n\nWhat musical instruments were played?\n\nA fine organ and some equally fine voices.\n\nDid anything distract you?\n\nThe occasional siren going past the open doors was a reminder of the everyday world outside. And the six elderly representatives of the Royal Commonwealth Society occupying the front couple of pews were quite watchable at times.\n\nWas the worship stiff-upper-lip, happy clappy, or what?\n\nHigh Anglican with lots of smells, though a bit light on the bells. And not as camp as high Anglican can sometimes be – there's another downtown Sydney church that provides that element. But the presence of 11 robed men and women in the altar party, not counting the choir, tells its own story.\n\nExactly how long was the sermon?\n\n15 minutes.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, how good was the preacher?\n\n6 – Credit to him for the fact that I was surprised that my stopwatch said 15 minutes – it felt shorter – but I thought his style lacked animation and variation in tone. Some of the things he said would have benefited from the injection of a little emotion.\n\nIn a nutshell, what was the sermon about?\n\nIt was topped and tailed with references to the commonwealth, recognising the presence of bigwigs from the Royal Commonwealth Society marking the anniversary of Her Majesty the Queen's accession. There was a bit of a dig at the controlling tendency of the diocese. But the core was that we Christians are by our very nature members of community, and that in a time of economic turmoil that vision of a supportive community has something important to offer to the wider world. This is particularly true when the secular world seems to value only individual gratification at the expense of the common good. And so, as the diocese launches its Contact 2009 evangelisation drive, we were reminded that the most effective way to spread the gospel is to live the gospel.\n\nWhich part of the service was like being in heaven?\n\nThe music was superb. The mass setting was Darke in F, which I've sung many times in my home parish, but it's never sounded like this.\n\nAnd which part was like being in... er... the other place?\n\nNot a lot really, although the Royal Commonwealth Society bigwigs representing the establishment in church (OK, be charitable, at prayer) were a little cringeworthy at times.\n\nWhat happened when you hung around after the service looking lost?\n\nI didn't have time to look lost. As I got to the back of the church, a charming lady relieved me of my hymnal and asked if I would be staying for drinks. How could I refuse?\n\nHow would you describe the after-service coffee?\n\nThere was probably coffee there somewhere, but in a heat wave in Sydney who wants coffee? The white wine (Australian – local, so we'll deem it to be fair trade) was cold and good, and the nibbles – cheese, salami, crackers, dips – were delightful.\n\nHow would you feel about making another visit (where 10 = ecstatic, 0 = terminal)?\n\n8 – The worship was uplifting, the music was wonderful, and the people were very welcoming. But based on this sermon and some examples on the website, I think that's the one area in which I'd wish for more.\n\nDid the service make you feel glad to be a Christian?\n\nYes it did, and also glad to be part of the inclusive tradition.\n\nWhat one thing will you remember about all this in seven days' time ?\n\nHow good Darke in F can sound – we're singing it at home in seven days' time, so there's a challenge."
