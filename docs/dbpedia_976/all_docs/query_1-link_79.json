The primary aim of this book is to provide a clear insight into how the medieval craftsmen achieved such remarkably high standards without the benefit of modern technology and equipment, and to supply information that can assist in the care and protection of historic churches. Using a limited range of tools the early craftsmen were able to create lasting edifices by way of techniques and skills passed from one generation to the next. I begin with the way the building process was initiated and how the medieval masons planned and managed a project. This is followed by an explanation of how the main features, such as the foundations, walls and other structural elements were constructed. Coupled to this is a description of the methods used by the different craftsmen, including the masons, blacksmiths and carpenters. The references to church design include features which can give clues to the date and origin of a structure. Coverage begins at the time of the AngloSaxons and continues through the subsequent phases up to the period of the Victorians. I am hugely indebted to the librarians at a number of cathedral libraries, the RIBA, the RICS and the Victoria and Albert Museum for their help and the excellent service they provided. Without their interest, cooperation and painstaking methods the project would have been much more problematical and difficult. I am also grateful for the help I received from the clergy in many parishes and to my fellow professionals Ian Yule, Trevor Francis, Tony Pass and John Edwards, who checked the manuscript with such meticulous care. My thanks also go to Peter Bishop and to my daughter and son-in-law, Sally and Ben Jones, for the help they gave with the photographs. Geoffrey R. Sharpe\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 11\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:37\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 12\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:37\n\nIntroduction\n\nChurch Sites and Classification Site Origins The places used by the pagans for ceremonies and worship gradually became the focal points for preaching by the early Christian missionaries, which resulted in many of the original churches being built on pagan sites. Most parish churches are located in or near established communities but occasionally they can be discovered in mystifying isolation. A number of explanations may be possible; most often it is the outcome of the devastation caused by the fourteenth-century pandemic known as the Black Death. Entire communities were wiped out, leaving the settlements to decay and eventually disappear except for the more robustly built church. Some ancient parish churches began as private chapels (capella) and were built by the large landowners and the manorial lords, positioned at the choice and convenience of the provider. Others resulted from an ancient form of tenure known as frankalmoign, in which a lay person donated land for a church subject to a deed of chantry. In times of turmoil and uncertainty villages and hamlets might also be destroyed by conflict or economic decline, and this can explain the present-day remoteness of churches in some locations. A few also stand in unlikely positions as the result of a remodelling of the local landscape by a large landowner which necessitated the resettlement of an entire community, leaving only the parish church. In areas prone to flooding every effort was made to ensure the parish church was built well clear of the flood plain, so the church may have been some distance from the main settlement. Through the exigencies of the old feudal system the Church could also acquire land by mortmain, a process which sometimes influenced its eventual siting. Any lay person who had no heirs could provide for his/her land to be transferred immediately to the Church at the time of his/her death. This\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 1\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:37\n\n2 ~\n\nhistoric english churches\n\navoided escheating – that is, reverting to the feudal lord – which would otherwise happen if a tenant died without heirs. The use of mortmain not only meant a loss of tenure but also deprived the lord of revenues which would otherwise have been received. Over time the benefits the Church received in this way were gradually diluted through amendments to the law, and eventually became non-existent. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries under the Act of 1539 a number of abbey and priory chapels were taken over by local communities and then used as parish churches. Some were exceptionally large and many parishes found it necessary to demolish parts to reduce the ongoing burden of upkeep. Ancient crosses positioned near but outside the boundaries of a churchyard invariably pre-date the church and were erected to mark the assembly point for open-air services. If a church was subsequently built nearby it was usual for it to be placed in a way that ensured the shadow did not fall on the original cross. This was done as an expression of reverence and dedication. A few of these crosses have a niche in the shaft made to take the pyx, the receptacle containing the host. In many churchyards large stone crosses of medieval origin can be found in a prominent point, more usually in a southerly location. These were provided as a collective memorial to the dead as few graves were marked with stone tablets, crosses or headstones until the late seventeenth century. Well-worn signs, initials or names cut into the boundary walls of old churchyards are a reminder of how all boundaries were at one time maintained by parishioners. Known as church marks, they indicated who was responsible for keeping the boundaries in a state of good repair. Another historical feature of interest is an original lychgate. The term is derived from the Old English word lich, meaning a corpse. The funeral service of the 1549 prayer book required that the priest meet the corpse at the churchyard entrance, and so lychgates were constructed to provide shelter for that purpose. In more recent times there has been a tendency to reintroduce lychgates as an architectural feature. Apart from showing heavier weathering, those of medieval origin can often also be identified by the presence of a resting slab for the coffin. At the Church of St Leonards in Heston, Middlesex, there is a lychgate of particular interest as it has a rare example of a tapsel gate which dates from 1450. Originally designed to be self-closing, it was operated by a counterbalance housed in the roof. As the gate was opened, a central pivot rotated, drawing a chain which wound around a wheel at the top of the pivot. This in turn connected to two more wooden pulley wheels and then down to a weight. The weight rose as the gate was opened and descended to return the gate to the shut position\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 2\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:38\n\nrafter clasped purlin\n\ncollar peg hole\n\nbrace\n\nstrut sill 1. Lychgate, Heston, Middlesex – using original methods and techniques, the structure has been fully restored by McCurdy & Co.

The counterbalance is now missing but other parts of the mechanism have survived (Fig. 1). Different Types of Church Just as there is a huge variety in the type of church building, so too were there different origins to what we might generally describe as a ‘church’ today. Essentially, a church is a building consecrated for religious worship. A cathedral is a church that contains the cathedra or throne of the bishop of the diocese, and chapels have a different status and are buildings licensed for worship but have not been consecrated as a church. Much can be gleaned about the history of a church from the original records, with the early purpose and function often having changed over time. Oratories, for example, were places of worship licensed under canon law for public, semi-public or private use, but the term is now generally applied to a small private chapel built within the walls or confines of a larger property. The term originally had a different meaning and came from the Congregation of the Oratory founded in Rome in 1575 by St Philip Neri. It provided for communities of secular priests who worked under strict rules of obedience but did not take vows. A chapel of ease is one which provides a more convenient facility to worship for those living at some distance from the parish church. Mention is also occasionally made of a slipper chapel, which is the place where pilgrims went to remove their shoes before entering a shrine barefoot. A pro-cathedral is not a cathedral as such, but a church within a diocese that is regularly used by the bishop when circumstances, such as distance, prevent him from conducting certain duties at the diocesan cathedral. An abbey was once the site of a major monastic establishment in which the abbot was also a bishop. A priory is a religious establishment presided over by a prior or prioress, and while of junior status to an abbey (which was headed by an abbot or abbess) several attained religious eminence and a level of prosperity which far exceeded that of many abbeys. Minsters (monasterium) were churches attached to a religious community led by a high-ranking priest under a monastic order, but the term has come to be acquired by some cathedrals that never enjoyed formal connections with a monastic establishment. The term chapelry is sometimes given to the daughter church of a minster. Free chapels are an anomaly from much earlier times; most originated as chapels for either the military, the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of St John of Jerusalem or the Knights Templar. Sometimes known as chapels peculiar they were outside the jurisdiction of\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 4\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:38\n\nintroduction\n\n~ 5\n\na bishop of the diocese. Chapels royal are private chapels attached to the royal court. In the past, religious houses sometimes built a chapel at or near the gate entrance for use by lay visitors, employees and others. Known as a capella ante portas, many became parish churches after the Reformation. A proprietary chapel is one which has been built and maintained by a private individual. Historical references occasionally mention a church as having been a thane church, which signifies that it has Anglo-Saxon origins and it could have served royalty or a person of high military rank or a member of the nobility. In earlier times the consecration of a church involved an elaborate ceremony, which was then celebrated annually with a public holiday and a feast. The practice of dedication to a saint, or a group of saints or a religious event dates from the fourth century. One benefit was the individual identity this gave to different churches in close proximity to each other. An example is St Mary-le-Bow in London, which clearly differentiates it from any other church dedicated to St Mary in the London area. During the middle ages many dedications were added to or changed, often as a matter of expediency concerning patronage or the result of a political motive. Changes also occurred when smaller churches became separate parishes. An effigy of the patron saint or a small tablet commemorating the dedication can sometimes be found in a small niche over the south or west door of the nave. Unlike in the past, there is now no difference between the rank of rector and vicar. The title vicar is derived from the Latin vicarius, meaning deputy. Originally the appointment was made by the appropriate monastery, who engaged a secular parish priest as deputy to the monks nominated to oversee the parish. The title rector went to a parish priest who received the benefit of tithes and, although tithes were abolished in 1936, the title has perpetuated. In the present day a priest who is the leader of a team ministry is sometimes referred to as a team rector. A prebendary was originally the holder of a cathedral benefice termed a prebend and again such endowments no longer exist but the title has remained. Before the Dissolution most of the abbeys in England were major monastic centres and enjoyed a higher standing and superior status to priories. Where a bishop was also an abbot the community would be administered by a prior and its church designated a cathedral priory. Cathedrals are occasionally described as being in either the Old or New Foundation. Cathedrals in the Old Foundation are those which began with secular canons. When Henry VIII dissolved the monastic establishments and their chapters, those with secular clergy remained undisturbed, while\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 5\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:38\n\n6 ~\n\nhistoric english churches\n\nthe cathedrals served by monks were refounded with secular canons to become the New Foundation. In more recent times a third category has emerged, covering churches which have been raised to cathedral rank; these are sometimes mentioned as being in the Modern Foundation.\n\nThe Role of the Archaeologist in the Investigation of Churches\n\nArchaeology has made a valuable contribution in revealing how the early churches were planned and developed. Now a scientific discipline, archaeology has gone beyond the stereotype of simple excavation and has advanced into the investigation of buildings, artefacts and other items – both below and above ground. The role of the archaeologist in the investigation of old churches, monuments and sites now brings together many different skills in a way that has considerably enhanced our knowledge of the past. At various stages in our history, turmoil, unrest, poverty, economic stagnation and overall decline have all contributed to the loss of important parts of our church heritage. Probably no era saw more of this than the time of the Reformation in the sixteenth century, when there was almost total destruction of the monasteries, resulting in the ruination of large amounts of valuable medieval art. A considerable number of churches also suffered from vandalism and despoliation at this time. In addition, extensive damage was inflicted on churches during the Civil War, when extreme Puritanism caused the loss of much stained glass, statuary and other features. Depressed economic times also caused periods of neglect and apathy towards the proper care of churches and permanent damage has often been the result. A church, like any other building, can quickly fall into disrepair and will eventually become a ruin if it is not protected from the elements. During periods of economic depression, many fell into such a state of ruin that they had to be abandoned and were quickly plundered for materials. After this it was only a matter of time before the effects of soil accumulation or erosion, and unrelenting saturation from rain made the fabric an ideal host for invading plant life. Some buildings were totally obliterated – the outcome often being aided by ground movements, animal burrowing, insect infestation and similar causes of destruction. Archaeology has done much to unravel the important features and the unknown parts of these sites. It has also opened up a new understanding of how a number of existing churches have developed. Many originally\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 6\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:38\n\nintroduction\n\n~ 7\n\nregarded as being Victorian or a little earlier have been found to have origins going back as far as the Saxons or Normans. Archaeological investigations have been particularly valuable in identifying the various phases of development in the early churches, which in some cases have been extensive and frequent. Sometimes subtle differences between materials can be highly revealing and of special significance. It is information such as this which can play such an important part in the making of better-informed judgements in restoration and repair work and in assisting more accurate recording.\n\nChurch Building Preliminaries The gargantuan task of organising, managing and overseeing the building of a cathedral, priory or great church fell to the master mason (magister operis), who was also responsible for the preparation of the drawings. The plans and illustrations were drafted on parchment, and it was often the practice for them to be supplemented with a model, the final result often having been the subject of much discussion and negotiation. Once a scheme had been approved, the master mason then undertook a firm obligation to build strictly in accordance with the agreed submission. It invariably took time and patience, however, before he could bring together a suitable team of craftsmen. The entire workforce could amount to 300 to 400 or more, including a team of masons (cementarii or lapicidi) who worked as banker or fixer masons. The banker masons had the important function of carving the various stones into the required shapes. The fixer masons worked on the actual placing of the stones, with any particularly fine decorative work more often requiring the services of a sculptor (caesores lapidum). Highly skilled carpenters (carpentarii) were also very necessary, as were blacksmiths (fabri), who forged the tools and maintained them in good working condition. All the trades had the support of labourers (operatii) and some semi-skilled workers (artificas). In the early medieval period it was usual for the Church to select and provide all materials, but this changed later on and the function fell on the master mason, who occasionally had the difficult task of selecting and supervising the winning of stone from the quarry face, although a specially appointed quarry mason was more often employed for this role to ensure quality and standards were fully safeguarded. It has been estimated that around 70,000 to 80,000 tons of\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 7\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:38\n\n8 ~\n\nhistoric english churches\n\nstone were needed to build a cathedral and between 1,200 to 1,500 trees had to be felled for the provision of sufficient timber. Spades (besha) and picks (picoys) were both used for digging out the foundations. In addition to the standard rectangular type a triangularshaped spade (didal), and a small hand spade (spyddell) also formed part of the equipment for ground works. In the middle ages, iron was scarce and a costly material – steel was even more so. Consequently implements such as spades and shovels (batilla) were often made from wood fitted with iron shoes. Most cutting tools were forged from iron with a piece of steel welded onto the edge. Water had to be transported from the source of supply to the point of operation in wooden casks or barrels fitted with poles (stangs), which enabled them to be carried by two or more men. The preliminary work also involved the setting up of onsite workshops, organising the regular supply and transport of sand, stone and other materials, providing lime kilns and ensuring a constant supply of clean water. There was also a need to consider in advance how certain areas could be accessed as the work proceeded. The handling and placement of stone needed much forethought because dressed stone blocks were usually too large to be laid by hand. In order to avoid damage to the faces a device known as a lewis (lowys) was used in the mechanical lifting and placement of stone (Fig. 2). Either the three-legged or chain types were used, with dovetailed mortices cut into the top of each block before lifting could begin. The three-legged device consisted of a parallel piece of iron between two dovetailed iron legs which held firm to the sides of the dovetail as the load was taken up (Fig. 2c), whereas to secure the load the chain lewis relied on two curved legs which had an outward gripping action (see Fig. 2a). This technique goes back to at least Roman times and is still in use today, the main alteration being the replacement of iron fitments with steel. A simple pincer gripping method known as the chain dog was also used for lifting irregularly shaped rough stone and other materials (Fig. 2b). The range of extra duties over and above those more normally undertaken by the mason eventually led to the use of the term architect for those who designed, planned and managed a project. Some original documents refer to an ‘architectus’, which later seems to have changed to ‘architector’. At parish level the work was more often undertaken in an entirely different way. It has generally been assumed most local churches were built with voluntary labour. While undoubtedly there are many situations where this has occurred there is evidence to indicate that a number of parish churches were built by craftsmen either under contract or by direct labour, with the local clergy having a major influence over the layout and design.\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 8\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:38\n\nintroduction\n\na\n\nb\n\n~ 9\n\ndog\n\nleg\n\nc\n\ncotter pin\n\ndovetailed leg\n\n2. Stone-lifting devices – (a) a chain lewis. A slightly dovetailed hole is formed on top of the stone to prevent the legs from slipping when they grip the sides on lifting. (b) a chain dog. A steel chain is passed through the ring of each dog; when the tension is taken up on lifting, the dogs bite into the surface and hold secure. (c) three-legged lewis. A rectangular piece of metal is sandwiched between two dovetailed legs. The recess cut into the stone has to be the exact size of the lewis. The two dovetailed legs are first inserted, followed by the centre piece. The whole is then secured by a cotter pin and is ready for lifting. The lewis is dismantled on completion of the operation.\n\nScaffolding (scaphalda) was formed from a framing of wood poles lashed together by strong rope, the vertical ones being called standards (signa), the horizontal pieces set at right angles to the standards being known as ledgers (dorsa), with diagonal members (diagonales) being used to brace and strengthened the structure. Hurdles (herdells) laid flat were regularly used instead of planks. Access to the various levels of scaffolding was mostly by movable ladder, but old illustrations seem to indicate that wherever possible there was a preference for the use of ramps. In order to avoid scaffolding having to be continually taken down to ground level for reassembly, the outrigger technique was devised, this being a temporary framework suspended around the point of operation which could be used without the need for additional support from below (Fig. 3). Not only could this be done at any height, it also enabled the structure to be dismantled\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 9\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:38\n\n10 ~\n\nhistoric english churches\n\nand re-erected as the work progressed, thereby making substantial savings in cost. Permanent access to various parts was provided through the installation of spiral stairways within the body of the wall. Narrow horizontal walkways were also formed in this way and, apart from giving improved access during building operations, also afforded good accessibility for future maintenance work. Evidence suggests that some materials such as timber lengths were moved to the point of operation with a sling chain, but cradles (credills) which could be raised and lowered as necessary were also installed for access and supplying lighter materials. If difficulties arose over taking heavy stone blocks to the exact fixing point, iron rods known as kevells enabled them to be rolled and slid into position. Much ingenuity and endeavour had to be used in lifting heavy weights to high levels. The common pulley and rope fixed to a gantry and shearlegs was in regular use, but heavier weights often presented difficulties. The problem was solved by the windlass (wyndhuse), which had a large wooden cylinder mounted on a frame attached to a heavy rope. This had at least two turning handles so that extra muscle power could be provided by two or more operatives. Later adaptations also had brakes and a ratchet, which made the appliance more effective and less tiring to operate. One version was worked by a treadmill that provided considerably enhanced lifting power (Fig. 4). Throughout the middle ages the crane was gradually developed and improved using a system of counterweights and double pulleys. Some were pivoted and were able to cover a wide circumference\n\n3. Outrigger scaffolding\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 10\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:38\n\nintroduction\n\n~ 11\n\n4. Treadmill\n\nand most could be readily dismantled and reassembled as the work advanced. As industrialisation developed, an iron winch was perfected with geared wheels, a brake and a sophisticated form of ratcheting. At this stage the use of ropes for heavy loads started to be phased out in favour of chains, which made the entire operation safer and more reliable. With a large cathedral, building operations could extend over a long period of time, a hundred years not being uncommon. The process often progressed in stages, with extended time lags occurring between each phase. When this happened exposed parts were given temporary protection, usually in the form of a capping containing a mixture of earth, straw and slaked lime or similar.\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 11\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:39\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 12\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:39\n\n1\n\nThe Construction of Churches Cements and Concrete\n\nLime and Cements The use of mortar enables bricks and stones to be bonded solidly together so that stresses from superimposed loads can be distributed. It also reduces to a minimum voids or paths through which air or moisture might penetrate the structure. Many people do not realise that, in addition to taking compressive forces, mortar also has a function in the transmission of shear and tensile forces. A loss of strength will occur if the bond between the blocks and the mortar fails. The lime or cement in the mortar is termed the matrix and the sand the aggregate. These are mixed to the proper consistency with clean water in different proportions, depending upon the type and character of the work. The mineral content and natural pigments in the sand can affect colour, and the quality of the lime or cement determines the strength. Although they are rare in church walling, black mortars can be seen from time to time. Accounts at Westminster dated 1532 refer to the use of black mortar in flintwork. Lamp-black or burnt moulding sand from the blacksmith seem to have been the most preferred ingredients, but ground ashes and ground clinker are also mentioned in old accounts. The mortars used in early church building were always a mixture of lime and sand, and it has long been assumed the ratio was generally one part of lime to three equal proportions of sand. However, a large number of analysed examples, especially those from the earlier medieval churches, have been found to be 1:1½ or 1:2, and further research has revealed the proportions can sometimes vary within the same structure. It seems that where there was a need for extra strength or better weather protection it was often the practice to increase the ratio of lime to sand. The lime was originally produced by calcinating in a wood kiln (calcifornium) either limestone or chalk to a high temperature, which had\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 13\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:39\n\n14 ~\n\nhistoric english churches\n\nthe effect of removing the calcium dioxide content. Coal-fired kilns did not come into normal use until the Industrial Revolution. After kilning, the resultant quicklime had to be slaked with water until it was hydrated, and the mixture was then turned over with a shovel on a boarded platform with, if necessary, more water being added until the correct consistency was achieved. The lime could then be mixed with sand and used as mortar, although for certain works lime putty was needed. Lime putty mortar is a soft plastic paste made by mixing one part fat lime and three parts by weight of water. The term ‘fat’ was given to the rich lime derived from the more pure white chalk deposits which are non-hydraulic (they can only set by reacting with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) and are slow to set. After mixing, the lime putty mortar was left until it stiffened into a pliable and workable condition, when it is ready for use. With especially fine jointing some masons preferred to use a mix of one part lime putty to three parts of crushed stone dust. In the British Isles most of the limes produced in this way were nonhydraulic, giving a setting process which slowly converted the slaked lime back into calcium carbonate. A limited number of formations, such as the blue lias deposits, however, contain contaminants of silica, clay, alumina and iron, which gives them hydraulic properties that enable them to set in the presence of water without the total reliance on carbonation. These limes were originally known as ‘water limes’, and the various constituents can continue to harden when under water to form calcium silicates and calcium aluminates. They are usually identifiable through their colour, in various ranges of grey, buff or reddish brown. In the presence of moisture all natural hydraulic limes have varying levels of hydraulicity because of differences in composition and in the integrity of the kilning. These variations were originally classified as: ‘eminently hydraulic’, which gave a setting time of one to four days; followed by ‘moderately hydraulic’, which takes between five to fifteen days; the slowest was the ‘feebly hydraulic’, which takes around fifteen to twenty-one days. This has now been amended under British and European Standards to include strength after twentyeight days. Non-hydraulic limes can be given some hydraulic properties through the addition of a pozzolanic additive such as crushed brick, tile or earthenware. The term pozzolan comes from the Roman practice of using volcanic ash from the region of Pozzuoli near Naples for the same purpose. From around the beginning of the seventeenth century onwards much experimentation went on in the manufacture of various hydraulic cements. In 1796 James Parker patented a new cement he called Roman\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 14\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:39\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 15\n\ncement produced from argillaceous clay (septaria), found in the seabed around Harwich and the Isle of Sheppey. Kilned at a low temperature, it was not only hydraulic but also proved to be most durable and could withstand persistent damp. Unless it was retarded it had a quick setting time of between twenty and forty minutes, making it an ideal material for working in locations affected by tidal waters or under heavily saturated conditions. As a mortar it was generally used in the proportions of 1:1½ or 1:2 with evidence indicating that stone masons preferred it for fixing cement joggles (see below, Fig. 32). Its high level of iron oxide makes it identifiable by giving it a distinctive dark pinkish-brown colour. Similar cements followed, such as Medina cement, which was made from clay taken from the beds of the river Medina on the Isle of Wight and is much lighter in colour. All these cements attained greater strength than hydraulic lime but less than Portland cement. In 1824 Joseph Aspdin patented Portland cement, which eventually brought about many changes to the building process. The original product had some deficiencies, but in 1845 Isaac Johnson improved the quality by kilning to a higher temperature, giving considerably enhanced properties. In masonry this gradually led to the widespread use of ‘compo’ – the name often given to cement–lime–sand mortars – a practice which continued up to the end of the Second World War, the usual proportions being one part cement, two of lime and nine of sand. Records going back to the mideleventh century indicate that in conditions of excessive damp it was often the practice to use a special cement compounded from either wax and pitch or wax and resin, which was applied in a molten state. The research for this book did not reveal any direct evidence of this having been specified in church work, but there can be little doubt that it would have been used where there was a pressing need to guard against damp. Concrete The use of concrete is often perceived as being a relatively new development, but in reality its origins go back to the early civilisations, at least as far as the Ancient Egyptians and the Chinese. Moreover, archaeological evidence indicates that both the Greeks and the Romans had a full understanding of how to adapt and apply concrete to best effect. The word concrete comes from the Latin concretus, which means ‘combined as one’. The concrete produced in Britain up to Norman times has been found to have a close similarity to that made by the Romans, with the constituent materials being in much the same proportions. It was frequently used as a core material in\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 15\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:39\n\n16 ~\n\nhistoric english churches\n\nwalling, a perfect example being the abbey ruins in Reading, where the wall facing has either been pillaged or has fallen away to expose the concrete hearting. In addition to the chemical set, all untempered natural hydraulic limes in the British Isles require a certain amount of carbonation from the atmosphere to achieve full strength. This is a reaction which cannot occur underground, which is the main reason why concrete was not generally used in foundation work during the medieval period. It is likely that other problems would have arisen over the strength and setting of the concrete as a result of possible damage from iron pyrites, salts, shale and mica in the ground. Some mineral salts in the ground water also had the capacity to reduce the quality of concrete. Nevertheless, the medieval masons were aware that by introducing an artificial pozzolanic material such as trass, crushed brick, tile or even broken-down earthenware the strength and hydraulic properties of the lime could be considerably increased. By the late seventeenth century pozzolanic rock was being imported from Holland to make hydraulic concretes and mortars. It came from a natural formation at Andernach in Germany where it was quarried and shipped in lumps to Holland, and then pulverised and exported as ‘Dutch terras’. As the constituent materials improved and developed, lime concrete continued to be used until well into the nineteenth century.\n\nFoundations (F undamentum )\n\nThe skilled masons of the medieval period had a good understanding of the basics of constructional stability and they built to proven and well-tried methods. The conclusive evidence is in the large number of cathedrals and churches which have stood on the original foundations to the present day. The lack of any need for major intervention has resulted in much foundation work remaining concealed, and as a result there is still much to be learnt. For a better overview it has been necessary to search old specifications and contract documents. Investigations have revealed much clear and precise information: in some cases the dimensions and statements relating to trench depth and width indicate that the builders had a full appreciation on how downward and lateral pressures needed to be resisted. While they lacked any knowledge of structural engineering in the form we use today, they were nevertheless able to produce a satisfactory outcome through a combination of accumulated knowledge from the past, accurate onsite observations and intuitive judgements. The intricacy, volume and height of the churches they built were considerable achievements; without any scientific awareness they were able to deal with the complexity of the\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 16\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:39\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 17\n\ndifferent stresses caused by compression, tension and shear in materials and components, using practices handed down from one generation to the next. This is very much in contrast to the methods now used, by which stress and strain can be accurately calculated by means of mathematical formulae. Stress can be briefly defined as the cohesive force by which the particles of a body resist an external force. It acts in a number of different ways, such as compressive, tensile, vertical, horizontal and transverse stresses. Compressive stress occurs when forces compress a material or push the particles closer together. The opposite force is tensile stress, in which external forces cause either the stretching or pulling apart of particles away from one another. Vertical stress arises from a tendency of a beam to shear under load, whereas horizontal stress occurs if two opposite forces acting on a material are not quite in line; this results in a tendency for the fibres to fail through a sliding action. Forces which cause bending stress result in the top fibres in a beam becoming shortened and those at the bottom being lengthened. A more complicated form of stress is transverse stress, which can arise from a combination of tensile, compressive and shearing stress. Strain is a term that is frequently misunderstood and misapplied and is the effect stresses have on a material to cause either an alteration in form or deformation. When a member or structure is said to be in equilibrium it refers to a point where there is no tendency for movement under the simultaneous application of forces. The determination of these forces by means of the laws of physics was unknown to medieval builders – one of the factors which mark a wide divergence between the methods of the past and the present. The safety of an entire structure can now be predetermined through structural mechanics in which the various elements of design and all load-bearing components are calculated from formulae, starting from the foundations upwards. This has enabled considerable savings to be made in the quantity of materials used, whereas medieval builders deliberately selected oversized components to ensure structural integrity. In the British Isles the first evidence of the use of load-bearing building components which had been determined through calculation appears towards the end of the Renaissance. General acceptance of the advantages this offered was slow to start, and structural engineering did not become properly integrated into the construction process until the early part of the nineteenth century. With small churches old foundation methods varied considerably and on occasion have been found to be almost non-existent. It was usual practice to lay large stones as a base upon which the walling could be built\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 17\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:39\n\n18 ~\n\nhistoric english churches\n\nsolid wall\n\nboulder\n\n5. Boulder and stone foundation\n\n(Fig. 5). Many churches rest on shallow foundations; a number have been taken to a depth little more than the top of the subsoil. The base was then rammed and beaten, and after the foundation stones had been laid, the spaces between were filled and consolidated with sand, gravel and small stones. From the earliest phase of the medieval period timber piles (pylyng) were sometimes driven into the bed of foundations if the bearing capacity of the ground was suspect and a firm base could not be found by excavation. The support provided by this solution was largely dependent on the friction between the surfaces of the piles and the adjacent soil. The piles were sunk into the ground by suspending a rope and pulley from sheer legs, and a heavy block of wood or iron was hoisted to the maximum height and then allowed to fall on the head of the pile, using horses or oxen to take the weight. There were limitations on the depth of penetration this could achieve, and there can be no doubt that under certain circumstances it would not have been possible to go down to a good load-bearing stratum. Unless foundations could be carried on a shallow rock bed, all trenching for the larger churches had to be hand dug down to a point which gave a stable and adequate base. Working in layers, it was the practice to fill the trenches with broken stone and block the voids with sand and gravel (described as gravellam). Each layer was then firmly consolidated by\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 18\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:39\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 19\n\nramming with a beetle (a large wooden block, often fitted with multiple handles, which enabled several operatives to ply it simultaneously) before proceeding with the next layer. Some specifications placed much stress on the need for thorough compaction (Fig. 6). Load distribution carried in this way can have remarkable strength and longevity: an everyday example is the way railway sleepers rest securely on carefully sized and well-firmed stones which are able to withstand the heavy moving and static weight of trains. In his book Building in England Down to 1540 (published 1952) L.F. Saltzman refers to the foundations of the tower to St Stephen’s Church, Bristol, going down to a depth of 31 feet (9.4 m) and he also describes the work of the rebuilding of Eton College Chapel at around 1453. The specification required the foundation trench to be carefully laid with a course of flat Yorkshire stone. This was followed by a course of mixed Yorkshire and Tenyton stone, with a final layer of blocks at the top set in a lime/gravel mortar. The footings had to extend beyond the wall by 2 feet (0.6 m) on the south, and presumably around the remainder too. Another technique used alternating layers of consolidated gravel and squareddimension stone. In situations where ground conditions were suspect for the building of larger churches different solutions had to be found. If the usual practice of widening trench-work to spread the load was inadequate builders had to\n\nplaster\n\nhearting\n\nrubble inner skin\n\nrough ashler\n\nfoundation stones\n\nconsolidated layers\n\n6. Layered and consolidated foundations\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 19\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:39\n\n20 ~ historic english churches\n\nfind different methods through innovation, with archaeological evidence indicating that it was usually achieved by using timbers as strengtheners, which encouraged settlement to be more uniform and reduced the risk of cracking. The use of timber in this way varied: one method involved filling and consolidating stones in the manner already described until close to ground level, and then placing longitudinal timbers known as crossunders (crossaundre) on top. Small broken stones or crushed chalk was then spread and rammed down between them and up to the top face of the timbers. In Chapter V of his book, Saltzman also refers to a similar method discovered by Biddle in the Old Minster at Winchester. A different technique involved longitudinal timbers being placed in parallel with the line of the trench and on top of the first layer of consolidated stones. Sometimes cross-pieces fixed at right angles connected the main foundation timbers (Fig. 7). In the same chapter, Saltzman mentions that this form was discovered by Peers under the choir at York Minster. The longitudinal stability of a structure was always the main problem, with transverse stability being much easier to achieve through the use of buttressing. Point loading, where concentrated loading is applied to a selected spot or component – such as a column – created different considerations. The laying of large, flat, heavy and roughly squared foundation stones on a firm base was one answer, subject to their being of sufficient width, thickness\n\nlayered filling\n\ntimber strengthening\n\n7. Timber strengthening to foundations\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 20\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:39\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 21\n\nand strength. Foundation stones of this type are often incorrectly termed stylobates, which is the description used in Classical architecture for an above-ground substructure on which rest the columns of a colonnade. In the parts where the bearing capacity of the soil could be unreliable, builders usually resorted to the use of iron-tipped wooden piles under the foundations, often supplemented with grid timbers placed over the pile heads. Unseasoned elm and alder were the preferred species because of their higher tolerance to conditions of persistent dampness. Placed over this was either a series of stones compacted in gravel or layers of small wellconsolidated stones mixed with sand. In more difficult parts a further option was to drive piles in closely arranged clusters (Fig. 8); earlier documents often refer to these as staddles or needles, the whole being capped with well-rammed layers of broken stone and gravel. To prevent any tendency of spread in more vulnerable ground it was sometimes the practice to encase the staddles in an upright ring of timbers known as starlings (Fig. 9). The tips of these were cut to a wedge for easier driving, and they performed a restraining role similar in function to the poling boards used in present-day trenching. The eventual use of brick in church building resulted in the foundation trenches normally being taken down to a suitable load-bearing stratum. From this, footings were constructed entirely of brick; each course was gradually offset (Fig. 10), the earlier use of consolidated gravel having been discarded. It is a practice which continued until the 1890s, when builders began to lay a bed of concrete upon which brick footings were\n\nrammed stone and gravel overlay\n\nrammed stone and gravel overlay staddles\n\nneedles\n\n8. Needles\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 21\n\nstarlings sometimes close driven around the staddles\n\n9.

This contrasts with the modern method of placing masonry walling directly onto concrete strip foundations. The builders of the time were unaware that, when properly executed, these techniques would be in accordance with Newton’s Third Law of Motion. It is now one of the basic structural engineering rules, which states that when forces act between two bodies and A exerts a force on B, then B exerts an equal and opposite force on A. This is vital in the building of a structure as the weight always exerts a downward force into the ground. If this is not resisted by an equal and opposite upward reaction a structure will settle and distort or fail structurally.\n\nWall Construction Brickwork Most of the original Saxon churches were built of timber, with the only remaining known example being at the Church of St Andrew, Greensted, Essex, where part of the wall to the nave was built in the traditional Scandinavian split-log or stave technique. A dendrochronological analysis has dated this to around ad 850. A number of masonry-built churches from Saxon times and some from the Norman period have been part constructed\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 22\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:40\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 23\n\nin materials described as spoila – stone, bricks and tiles reclaimed from Roman works. A good example can be seen in the Roman bricks used in the walls of the Saxon Church of St Botolph, Hardham, West Sussex, which have been taken from a nearby Roman settlement. After the departure of the Romans in the early part of the fifth century, brick making was abandoned and did not re-emerge until the second half of the twelfth century. Brick was used infrequently in church construction, even when reduced costs made brick a more popular material. The exception was the East Anglian region, where brick (breke) was used for church building because of a shortage of local stone. Dressed stone was usually used for windows, door openings and similar features, but in a few East Anglian churches the tracery and other items are also in moulded brick. Still, the reluctance to use brick in church work continued elsewhere. Good examples of pre-Reformation churches which are in brick can be found at Layer Marney and Chignal Smealy in Essex, and at Shelton in Norfolk. Notable brick-built churches outside the East Anglian region are at Small Hythe in Kent and Lutton and East Hordon in Lincolnshire. The illustration in Figure 11 is the tower at St Mary’s Church, Shinfield, Berkshire, which is brick built and dates from 1630. It is in English bond (see Fig. 11) and was later severely damaged by cannon fire during the Civil War when the tower was used by Royalist troops as a lookout. The early bricks were burnt in clamps or wood-fired kilns. When produced in this way the best quality always came from the centre of the firing, with many of those in the outer layers being left soft and underburnt. Known as samel bricks, these were picked out and used for filling and rough work and are readily identifiable by their distinctive salmon-pink colouring. A change began in the late seventeenth century when brick started to be used for the building or rebuilding of church towers, and by the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries it rapidly replaced stone for many forms of building work, and was much used as a backing material and sometimes as facing in churches. By the end of the nineteenth century, brick had become a regular material for the construction of smaller churches. Where bricks appear in the earlier churches they are smaller in size and are in English bond, with the stretchers and headers being placed in alternate layers. This contrasts with the Flemish bond used in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, where the headers and stretchers appear alternately in the same course (Fig. 12). A stretcher is a brick with the long side facing outwards; a header is a brick with the end laid outwards. Bonding is the\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 23\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:40\n\n24 ~\n\nhistoric english churches\n\n11. Brick church tower\n\ninterlacement of bricks whereby the vertical joints in one course are covered by bricks in the adjoining courses (Fig. 12). The durability and strength of a wall is dependent on good bonding, particularly to avoid continuous or near-continuous vertical jointing. In the early stages of the medieval period bonding was somewhat haphazard, although by Tudor times it had become more consistent and uniform, and had been forged into the English bond style. In some original work, elongated ‘through’ bricks known as cogging bricks were sometimes used to provide additional strength. Flemish bond is the weaker style although it is generally considered to be aesthetically superior. It is also more economical as a greater number of broken bricks can be cut and used as bats (half bricks). Variations do occur to both bonding techniques, although they are seldom found in church work. Below is a chronological summary of the variations between brick sizes.\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 24\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:40\n\nthe construction of churches\n\nstretcher\n\n~ 25\n\nheader\n\n12.

No set size established. Dimensions usually varied from 12”–11” x 6” x 1¾”–2¾” (306 mm x 279 mm x 70 mm). Brick lengths of up to 15”–20” (381–508 mm) have been discovered. All these sizes are now described as ‘great bricks’. During the thirteenth century Flemish craftsmen settled in East Anglia and introduced smaller brick sizes. The dimensions varied from 9¾”–8” x 4¾”–3¼” x 1¾”–2½” (230–203 mm x 103–77 mm x 44–52 mm). About this time a notable era in English brickwork began. Bricks moulded to various shapes including the replication of stone ornamentation. ‘Tudor bricks’ mainly sized 9” x 4¾” x 2” (228 mm x 102 mm x 50 mm). Bricks sizes were determined by decree and were required to be 9” x 4½” x 1¼” (228 mm x 103 mm x 57 mm). The ruling was not effectively enforced and some bricks from this period are likely to have different dimensions. From about this time, brick sizes tended to diminish to 8½” x 41/ 8” x 23/ 8” (204 mm x 101 mm x 51 mm). The trend towards reduced brick sizes resulted in the introduction of the frog.\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 25\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:40\n\n26 ~ historic english churches\n\n1729 1784 1840 1850 1965 1969\n\nSize regulated by statute to 8¾” x 41/ 8” x 2½” (205 mm x 101 mm x 52 mm). These bricks became known as ‘statute bricks’. Brick tax introduced. Imperial brick size introduced: 8¾” x 41/ 8” x 2½” (205 mm x 101 mm x 52 mm). In parts of the Midlands and the North of England the thickness was increased to 3” (75 mm). Brick tax abolished. A British Standard came into being under BS 3921: 1965, which stipulated dimensions as 8⅝” x 4⅛” x 2⅝”. The British Standard size was metricated to 215 mm x 102.5 mm x 65 mm under BS 3921: Part 2.\n\n~ In his book Mechanick Exercises published in 1703, Joseph Moxon refers to the tools used by bricklayers. An item of particular interest is the original brick-axe, which looked more like a chisel. He also mentions a small tinsaw for cutting and a circular rub stone of around 14 inches (35 cm) in diameter used to rub bricks down to a required shape. A small handheld float stone provided an alternative technique, with the bricks being rubbed to shape against a template (platt). Later, a tool known as a scutch appeared for dressing cut surfaces and a more conventional type of brickaxe evolved, although the original type remained in circulation until around 1840. Decorative and ornamental brick designs could be produced with specially moulded bricks or by rubbing bricks to a required outline. An alternative method was the cutting and sculpting of fired bricks in situ. After some initial shaping with either a brick-axe or a scutch, much of the finer working was carried out using strips of copper, to incise and score in the detail. The final finishing was mostly worked by gentle abrasion with a small stone. A few churches display carved-brick ornamentation: some good examples are the trefoils in the early sixteenth-century porch at the Church of St John the Baptist, Pebmarsh, Essex, and the carvings on the north porch at Hardwick parish church in Norfolk. In around 1520 the use of fired clay advanced to the production of terracotta. It did not come into general use for church work at this stage, but again exceptions are to be found, the more notable examples being the tombs at Layer Marney Church, Oxburgh, Essex and the sedilia (stone seats for use by the clergy) at Wymondham Church, Norfolk. Terracotta did, however, feature in many of the brick churches built in the Victorian and Edwardian periods, with terracotta blocks often being used in the door\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 26\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:40\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 27\n\nand window jambs (jamwys) and in various features and ornament. In essence, terracotta is made from fine clay mixed with other materials such as crushed sand which is then moulded and fired at a high temperature. This produces hard compacted units of high-quality material which have a particular sharpness of detail in a form not attainable with ordinary brick clays. Faience is the term given to the same material with a glazed finish. Stonework The hardness and durability of stone is highly dependent on its mineral constituents and on the state and density of the aggregation. While the particle parts might be hard, the stone itself will be soft if the binding material is of poor quality. The medieval masons understood this and operated with an accumulation of knowledge from the past and an intimate understanding of the qualities and faults of the stones on which they worked. They also knew how to utilise stones of different compositions and how to identify good and bad stone within the quarry stratifications. In each architectural period the masons had a preference for a particular size of block but in general terms the blocks tended to become larger as time went on. Building stones need to be laid in accordance with their natural bedding plane and be placed in the wall horizontally. In other words, good practice requires them to be used as found in the quarry (Fig. 13). Exceptions to this are those circumstances where projections should be parallel to the perpends (vertical joints) and in arches where the bed needs to be at right angles to the thrust. Nevertheless, in medieval masonry this rule was not always fully observed and occasionally blocks can be found set with the grain the wrong way. This is often the reason why some stones have weathered badly in relation to the others; if the bedding surface is set vertically it makes the stone more vulnerable to decay and the laminations prone to become detached and to break off. In parish churches deficiencies in the application of the stonework can often be the result of inadequate bonding, uneven bedding or too frugal use of mortar. The faulty selection of stone from the same quarry can be a further contributory factor. In many quarries stone is not of the same quality throughout and it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between the poor and good formations except for the trained eye. When different types are used together, excessive decay can also occur through the incompatibility of certain stones. The mixing of limestone with sandstone has frequently resulted in the rapid decay of the sandstone. Similarly soft,\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 27\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:40\n\nHorizontal bedding\n\nEdge bedding\n\nFace bedding\n\n13.

A poor-quality mortar can be another reason for a substandard outcome, especially if small stones or large pieces of grit of various sizes have been allowed to contaminate the mix. This can take some stones out of level and cause uneven bearing. This should not be confused with the insertion of uniform and equal-sized pea gravel or similar, which was sometimes used in mortar jointing to help resist lateral movement or drag. The size of the quoins (corner stones – coynes) can be an additional indicator of the quality of the masonry. They bond the walling where it meets at the corners and need to be equal or larger in size than the main building blocks. Some strength and stability is lost if they are smaller. Most stones taken from a quarry contain a mixture of water and minerals known as ‘quarry sap’. Stone should not be used in this condition and needs to be left to season until it has dried out and hardened. In some of the smaller churches the quality of the masonry was not always up to standard, and there are pointers suggesting that unseasoned stones were perhaps used at the time of construction. If exposed prematurely to the ravages of the weather the stone is likely to be permanently weaker and more vulnerable to erosion and decay. Apart from a few exceptions, Saxon stonework tends to be much rougher and to a poorer finish compared to the following periods. Masonry Classifications Masonry styles can be broadly grouped into ashlar (acheley or assheler), rubble (ramell) and block-in-course work (Fig. 14). Fine ashlar stone is accurately tooled to sharp right-angled corners and laid truly level, with thin mortar joints. As stone dressing improved and became more precise, masons were able to progressively reduce mortar jointing to a thickness which seldom exceeded 1/ 8 inch (3 mm), although work to this standard was rarely achieved before the fifteenth century. The best ashlar is laid with lime putty mortar (see page 14). In church building the facework is more usually plain but in some much later work parts can be found rusticated. Rustication is a method of working the face of individual blocks or courses in ways which make them more conspicuous and was a style much associated with Classical architecture (Fig. 15). The joints are deeply recessed in various ways in this style, and the surfaces may also be plain, worked or roughened; although the technique originated from the Romans it was rarely used in Britain in medieval times. In the early medieval\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 29\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:41\n\nrandom rubble inner skin\n\nhearting\n\na straight-cut face stones\n\nb hearting\n\nc d random rubble inner skin solid wall\n\nf e hearting\n\ng\n\nh\n\n14.

It is a practice which was sometimes continued into more recent times. Dressing is the term applied to mouldings, finely worked surfaces and sculptured decoration (talliat) when used on a building for the purposes of refinement or ornament apart from tracery. The backs of some dressed stones were left rough with the express objective of providing a better bonding surface for the mortar. The term rough ashlar now applies where stone has been cut and squared to a proper finish and is reasonably true and square on all sides.\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\ne\n\nf\n\ng\n\nh\n\ni\n\n15.

This was bonded into the ashlar or worked with two skins with a hearting between (Fig. 14a). The hearting was a rubble fill consolidated with lime mortar. During the post-medieval periods old records sometimes describe rubble-filled walling as ‘impletion walling’. For thinner walls such as parapets, solid ashlar or squared stone blocks were used with extra ‘through’ stones (theughe) provided to give firmer bonding and added stability (through stones – thrughe stanes – extend from one face to the other). In cases where parts of the original church walling have survived to become a section of a later structure, mortars of earth or a mixture of earth and lime have sometimes been discovered. References to this have also been found in old accounts and the practice is known to have endured until well into the fourteenth century. In some of the early Saxon churches, walling from the foundations up to ground level has been found to have been assembled without mortar, the application of a dry-stone technique probably being an attempt to combat rising damp. Rubble is the general term for masonry where the stones are either of various sizes or irregular shapes, the different applications being coursed or uncoursed (the original term used for coursed walling was tabulatis). In church work a number of variations are likely to be found. An illustration in Figure 14 is an example of random rubble walling where the quoins have been hammer dressed to give a clear profile at the corners. Figure 14 also shows an example of random rubble built in courses, which is where the stones have been so placed to give true horizontal joints along the top and bottom lines of the quoins. A variation of this is also shown where the stones have been roughly squared, with some blocks equal to the full height of each course being featured intermittently. Another example is regularcoursed rubble where stones of a fairly uniform size have been used and, although of various lengths, are the same in height. Also shown is squared rubble which has been snecked. This is where stones of various sizes have been arranged in a particularly irregular or non-uniform way. When this is done, special consideration has to be given to the strength of the bonding, and to achieve a satisfactory result the insertion of specially prepared stones is necessary. This involves the use of through stones known as risers, flat stones called levellers and small gap-filling stones termed snecks. This avoids the need for excessive vertical jointing and makes for a stronger and more appealing wall. Block-in-course work does not alter materially from coursed rubble, the essential difference is that the courses are deeper and have added strength from the inclusion of extra through stones (Fig. 14, see coursed rubble).\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 32\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:41\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 33\n\nThe style is more associated with engineering works and is less likely to be found in church building. Flintwork and polygonal walling are always categorised as rubble walling. Plinths which project beyond the face of the wall can sometimes provide an indication of the wall’s age. Few are seen in walls surviving from Saxon and early Norman times and the few that do exist are plain and simple in style with a chamfered top edge. This changed little in the Early English period, but during the Decorated phase they became a regular feature and are much taller and more prominent than before, and many have bold projections. In the Perpendicular period plinth heights increased further and many often feature intricately worked decoration. In the middle and later Gothic periods plinths were occasionally worked in two lifts, the upper part sometimes being termed a ledgment table (tablamentis) and the lower level an earth table (solum tablamentis). Building Stone In the past, churches have been constructed from a range of different materials, which may include a selection of various stones within the same walling. Whereas the great cathedrals and larger churches had the means to build in specially selected stone from elsewhere, costs dictated the use of locally available materials in the building of most parish churches (Fig. 16). As a consequence, a wide diversity of different stones can be seen in churches around the British Isles, and the exploitation of the physical characteristics of some was made to good effect. Certain stones, for example, break naturally into roughly squared or oblong blocks, while others split into elongated lengths, and some, such as ragstone, are totally irregular in shape. All this has provided some intriguing aesthetic variations throughout the regions, but the tooling limitations encountered with some forms necessitated the incorporation of freestone in those elements involving fine finishing and ornamentation. A freestone (lapid or freston) is one which has a fine grain and does not possess strongly defined laminations or bedding planes. This enables it to be more easily tooled with a chisel or a saw, making it ideal for fine carving and dressed work. The overall variation in stone selection sometimes included the use of sarsens and erratics. Sarsens are boulders of grey sandstone which appear to have no relationship to other stones in the area. In reality they are the remnants of an original sandstone stratum that has otherwise been completely eroded away. Erratics are stones which have been transported from another location by glacial action.\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 33\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:42\n\n16. A church wall made of several different materials\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 34\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:42\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 35\n\nThe chief constituents of granite are feldspar, quartz and mica, and some also have varying amounts of augite and hornblende. The colour is greatly influenced by the crystal size and feldspar content. Those containing plagiosclase feldspar and dark micas are in relative terms less durable than those derived from orthoclase and light mica. It is these differences which determine how the stone is best used and applied. Apart from limited quantities from Leicestershire, most granite supplied for church building came from Scotland or Cumbria. Granite deposits usually have two planes of cleavage which enables them to be more easily hewn into roughly shaped blocks. Limestones are formed from organic or chemical sources. Those of organic origin are the remains of animal organisms such as molluscs, crinoids and similar marine life which have hardened under pressure and are held together by a cementing material. Those derived from a chemical action are made up of small grains around which are concentric deposits of calcium carbonate as a result of the percolation of water carrying calcium carbonate. The oolitic limestones are aggregations of small rounded particles which in appearance are similar to the roe of a fish. The size of the grains can vary, which has a direct relationship with the texture and porosity of the stone. Magnesium carbonate is present in most limestones, but those containing a higher proportion are called magnesian limestones. If the magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate are held in roughly equal amounts it is termed Dolomitic limestone. The areas where limestone is prevalent are Lincolnshire, parts of Derbyshire, Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset and Nottinghamshire, with the colours in these regions ranging from white, cream, light grey, blue, buff and pink. Apart from local workings, the limestones used for building have mainly come from the larger quarries such as those in Ancaster in Lincolnshire, Bladon in Oxfordshire, Clipsham in Leicestershire, Corsham Down and Monk Park in Wiltshire, Hopton Wood in Derbyshire, Portland in Dorset and Weldon in Northamptonshire. Supplies of magnesian limestone for the large churches have probably been taken from quarries such as those at Aston and Park Nook in the Yorkshire area or Linby in Nottinghamshire. Sandstones are composed mostly from fragments of quartz together with subsidiary amounts of other minerals such as feldspar and mica. The constituent grains may be large or small, angular or rounded. The more usual cementing materials are silica, oxide of iron, feldspar, mica or calcite, all of which determine the compressive strength and durability of the stone. Sandstones with a matrix of feldspar have been used locally in parts of Hertfordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire. The stone is classified\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 35\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:42\n\n36 ~ historic english churches\n\naccording to the character of the grains and the degree of stratification. Flagstones are those which are strongly laminated and split fairly readily and thickly along the bedding planes, while tile-stones can be worked in a similar fashion but produce thin pieces which may be used for roofing. Liver or knell stones are thick bedded and produce large single blocks. The term York stone is applied to sandstone from York that is particularly hard and suitable for steps, copings and similar features. Well-known sandstones for building include those from quarries at Bolton Woods, Appleton, Crosland Hill and Thornton Blue in the Yorkshire region, Dunn House near Durham, Kerridge and Runcorn Red in Cheshire, Longridge in Lancashire, and Stancliffe in Derbyshire. Sandstone has also been widely used in parts of the South-East of England, where a thin stratum runs from the Downland areas of Sussex through to parts of Kent. There is also a narrow band which extends from Devon through to Norfolk. Slate stone occurs extensively in areas of the South-West and North-West of England and is a particular feature in parts of Lancashire and most of Cumbria. In some regions of Cornwall and Devon it was the only available material for building a number of local churches and here long lengths of slate can be seen used as lintels and beams, which over the course of time have been proved to possess a remarkably high bending tolerance. From time to time a conglomerate called puddingstone can be seen used in church building. Composed mostly of a mixture of flint pebbles and small lumps and fragments of sandstone, it is held together by a natural cement of silicon or iron oxide. Although found in other parts it is more likely to be seen in the South-East of England along a line from Middlesex through to north-west Surrey and east Berkshire – a church in the town centre of Wokingham is partly in puddingstone. Quantities of the same stone also occur in the Church of St Lawrence in Chobham, Surrey. Each of the various stones has had a particular impact on the quality, finish and composition of church building in the parishes of Britain. A significant change began as communication and transport links improved, resulting in an increased demand for Bath stone, which was most favoured for church work. A technique known as range work was sometimes used for facing internal walling in churches. For this, the Bath stone blocks were supplied in different heights and had to be coursed in a manner which increased the number of random vertical joints. As the stones were not finished precisely there was sometimes a need to work the surface with a drag after laying, often leaving perceptible tell-tale signs (a drag is a steel plate with serrated edges which was dragged backwards and forwards and\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 36\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:42\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 37\n\nin different directions until the required finish was obtained, as shown in Figure 15). The term range walling is also used to describe ashlar work where the blocks are in courses and are less than 7 inches (18 cm) in height. The use of cobbles (saxum), pebbles (pebyllis) and sometimes boulders can also be found in church walling. They may differ in quality and strength and are likely to have come from a variety of rock fragments rounded into irregular shapes by the eroding action of glacial waters or the sea. Those suitable for building mostly occurred in the beds of streams, estuaries or on the seashore. Stones which are over 3 inches (8 cm) in diameter but less than 12 inches (30 cm) are termed cobbles, and those under 3 inches (8 cm) are called pebbles. These are materials which have been used extensively on the south coast of England in a similar fashion to flint. Boulder stones are those over 12 inches (30 cm) in size and are frequently set with smaller stones sometimes acting as positioning wedges. In earlier times chalk was also used as a building material where it could be transported at reasonable cost and was readily available. In the British Isles the chalk strata vary considerably in quality, with the harder and more rock-like varieties often described as clunch. The term should, however, be restricted to a particular type of chalk found in Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire. Chalk is not usually a feature in church building except where it is used as infilling in the webs of vaulting and as infill to the hearting in composite walling. No true marbles can be quarried from the geological formations in England, and from the thirteenth century onwards the term has been incorrectly applied to some very hard local limestones that are capable of being ground and polished. Throughout the thirteenth century they were much favoured for interior work to churches, with the main sources of supply coming from Devon, Derbyshire, Dorset and the Petworth area of Sussex. Later a wide variety of genuine marbles were imported from Italy, Ireland and elsewhere. At around the end of the Gothic phase and in the early stages of the Rennaissance there was a move towards making exceptionally fine ashlar jointing. To achieve this some builders used a system of concave bedding whereby blocks were hollowed on the bedding surfaces to enable the visible part of the joint to be reduced in thickness. The practice became more developed during the Renaissance but it was short-lived as it created unequal stresses and made the stone vulnerable to spalling along the bed joints, especially when the mortar gradually hardened and shrank. It is a technique which is seldom found in smaller churches because of the extra\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 37\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:42\n\n17. Concave bedding\n\n18. Flint nodules – from top: when taken from the ground the nodules are covered with a white crust of lime sometimes tinted because of the presence of minerals; the knapped surfaces reveal an opaque material, usually grey-black or dark brown in colour; knapped and squared flints are assembled to produce a bonding effect identical to brick or stonework\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 38\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:42\n\nthe construction of churches ~ 39\n\n19. Flint demonstration panels, showing how flint can be worked or coursed in different styles\n\ncost that the stone preparation incurs. At times concaving was used in some rough ashlar work, leaving blocks vulnerable to vertical cracking and often causing them to break at the middle (Fig. 17). Flint (flyntis) was another favoured material for church building in the South-Eastern and Eastern regions, with the best examples being found in Sussex, Kent, Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of Hampshire. Flint should not be confused with chert, which – although similar – is never present in chalk strata and is essentially a feature in the connecting border areas between Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, but it can also be found in parts of Yorkshire. Flint can be laid as found, set coursed or uncoursed (Figs 18 and 19). It can also be used knapped or knapped and gauged. Knapping is a method of fracturing flint nodules into two or more pieces to reveal a grey-black lustred surface flecked with white, the overall result often being described as a polled face. Gauged work was a later progression whereby knapped stones were also squared (Fig. 20). Nevertheless, some of the early\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 39\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:43\n\n40 ~ historic english churches\n\n20. Knapped and squared flint\n\n21. Early Norman flint walling\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 40\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:43\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 41\n\nflint walling in churches was particularly rough and crude – the example shown in Figure 21 is in a church in Berkshire. The use of knapped flint first appeared around ad 1200 and opened up new horizons in terms of aesthetics and wall texturing. From about 1760 onwards, knapped and gauged flintwork became popular in church building. Flat disc-shaped flints sometimes occur naturally, and these were collected for separate use to produce a distinctive feature known as tabular flintwork. It is seldom found in the walling of churches but does occur more often in churchyard walling. The impermeable nature of flint meant that – in contrast to brick or stone – there was practically no adhesion to the mortar. This caused a particular weakness at the quoins which was overcome by using brick or stone. This could also give added strength to the main structure by the introduction of lacing courses in the same material (in this context a lacing course is an intermediate course of another material). The notion of using flint in combination with other materials resulted in the development of chequer work at the beginning of the fourteenth century (Fig. 22), accompanied a little later by a technique known as flushwork (Fig. 23). Although occasionally found elsewhere, flushwork is essentially indigenous to East Anglia. In essence, it involves cutting hollows and cavities into ashlared stone to receive an infilling of knapped or undressed flint bedded in lime mortar. It developed into a unique and highly decorative art form featuring a multiplicity of religious symbols, icons, biblical quotations and monograms. In some cases the work is of such a high quality that there is little evidence of mortar jointing. Knapped flint in flushwork is mostly found shallow bedded and there are a few isolated cases where a different stone has been used in lieu of flint. A large number of churches in the east of the country have some splendid flushwork and are worthy of a special mention. They include the parish church at Hopton near Great Yarmouth, especially the work to the belfry, the lettering on the porch at East Tuddenham church near Norwich and the tower at Redenhall church, between Harleston and Bungay. Other notable examples are the work at Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford in Suffolk. Knapped flint set in brick occurs as a feature in the area, and this is well illustrated in the tower window at St Benedict’s, Norwich. Elsewhere flint flushwork can be seen at the local churches in Bottisham and March, and at St Cyriac’s, Swaffham Prior, which are all in Cambridgeshire. It also occurs at St Mary’s Church, Luton and at Redbourn in Hertfordshire. At times a technique known as galletting (taken from the French word galet, meaning a stone) can often be seen in church walling. Sometimes termed garnetting or garretting, it involved inserting small stones or slivers\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 41\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:43\n\n22 Flint chequer work (Facing page) 23 Flushwork\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 42\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:44\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 43\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:45\n\n44 ~ historic english churches\n\nof flint into the mortar jointing of the facework before it had set (Fig. 24). It is mostly found between the North and South Downs of South-East England, covering the areas of Sussex, Surrey, Kent and east Hampshire, and also occurs in the flint-building areas of Norfolk. It was more regularly used in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and is only seldom found in churches of medieval origin. Throughout the nineteenth century the practice went into steady decline and was eventually discontinued. D r e s s i n g a n d Wo r k i n g S t o n e The Saxons dressed stone with an axe, which why most of the masonry from this period has not been finely worked or finished. In much of the surviving masonry the original axe-tooling marks can still be seen. In addition to the ordinary mason’s axe, the hammer-axe was also in regular use, which was an implement rather like a small mattock with the blade running longitudinally. In the second half of the twelfth century there began to be a major shift away from axed dressing towards tooling with chisels for both carving and finishing. In the thirteenth century the claw tool and then the boaster appeared, and both enabled surface irregularities to be more suitably removed to give a better surface finish. At this stage the boaster was used in a manner which produced a series of fine vertical lines on the work face, but in the Early English period this changed to the lines being run diagonally across the face of the stone (see Fig. 15a). While much walling was left in this way the Gothic masons sometimes went further and finished facework with a drag (see page 36), which produced a finer finish and removed all signs of tool marks. In rubblework a smoother surface was sometimes accomplished on particularly rough pieces by wetting the surface and spreading it with sand and then rubbing with another piece of stone. This process was repeated until the desired result had been obtained. Most church walling is composite and has inner and outer placings of stone or flint, with the core or hearting (royboyll), being filled with small stones well compacted in lime mortar. Sometimes an earth mortar or an earth and lime mortar was used but few examples remain. In the very early small churches and chapels the hearting has occasionally been found to have been placed dry, which made it liable to consolidate more densely at the base than at higher levels, causing unequal compressive pressures within the body of the wall. A badly packed core filling can also sometimes shrink away from the encasing stone, leaving the two skins to carry the weight of the main structure. To give extra strength, most composite walls have bonder or through stones placed at intervals, passing through the\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 44\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:45\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 45\n\n24.

In old manuscripts they are sometimes described as perpent stones (perpeigne), and if they are of sufficient size and number and transverse the wall thickness in a similar way it is termed parping ashlar in ashlar work. Not all stones were suited for precise cutting and carving, and the early masons did not have the necessary tools to work difficult stones to the standards expected in the present day. The Saxons (600–1066) preferred to build in well-bonded larger stones which enabled them to make some reduction in wall thicknesses. A particular characteristic was the application of ‘long and short work’ at the quoins, which was achieved by placing rectangular stones flat and upright alternately (see Fig. 25). Much of the external walling was in rough ashlar often with some irregularity in the coursing, nevertheless a limited amount of more refined ashlar can be found from this period. The herringbone pattern was another feature favoured by the Saxons and appears to a much lesser extent in the early part of the Norman phase (Fig. 26). It has been suggested the technique\n\n(Facing page) 25. Saxon tower with long and short work to the quoins, together with pilaster strips (lesene strips) and string courses 26. Herringbone work\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 47\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:48\n\n48 ~ historic english churches\n\nmay have been chosen to speed up the building process as stones could be laid more rapidly this way. Solid-stone walling was sometimes provided at selected points where additional strength was needed (see also columns, page 76). At this stage the lime/sand mortars (Calx/sabulum) were mostly of better quality but the sands tended to be of a coarser texture. The Normans (1066–1199) had a preference for building walls in extreme thicknesses with small stones, using mass to resist most destructive forces. A weakness often found when cutting into this type of walling is that there is an imperfect bond between the core and the two encasing skins. The use of rubble stone on the external face was generally accompanied by the application of a lime plaster covering internally. A few Norman churches have plain projecting plinths, and a number feature continuous string courses placed immediately under the window sills (in masonry work string courses are narrow-banded horizontal courses projecting beyond the wall face). Old documents show that large quantities of oyster shells were often used to set rib stones or voussoirs and to level and wedge blocks to prevent any displacement. At the beginning of the Early English period masons built walls in slightly reduced thicknesses using more cut stone, including ashlar blocks of larger dimensions. The rubble core is generally found to have been better consolidated. In the Decorated phase (1272– 1349) and Perpendicular period (1350–1593) the standards improved even further, with blocks of increased size and more accurate dimensions being used along with fine lime mortar jointing of exceptional quality. A feature sometimes found in the Perpendicular phase is decorative panelling carved into the wall faces. Church walls from the medieval period often have a slight batter (an inclined wall face or a slightly receding slope to a wall in which the wall is thicker at the base and thinner at the top) on the outer face but in the Celtic areas a batter very occasionally occurs on the inner face, with the outer face being a true vertical. In an attempt to induce any differential settlement to be more dispersed and uniform, medieval builders sometimes inserted timbers into masonry above ground during the construction. These intra-mural timbers (sometimes termed chain timbers) were totally encased within the walling longitudinally with any necessary transverse stability being provided by good buttressing. Wilcox in his book Timber and Iron Reinforcement in Early Buildings (1981) describes in much detail how intra-mural timbers were used, and how they were occasionally applied as collars to hold a building square at the corners in addition to being a way of preventing distortion. His published findings also indicate that intra-mural timbers were probably used to a lesser extent in church work than in other buildings, but\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 48\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:48\n\nthe construction of churches ~ 49\n\nhe does make some useful references to them being discovered in Derry Church, Co. Down, Wilmington Priory, Sussex, and St Augstine’s Abbey, Canterbury. The manner and pace in which building work was undertaken also helped to minimise the effect of movement. The building process was slow, with gaps of many months and sometimes years occurring between the various stages. Work was often not progressed during the winter months, which enabled any differential movements to be consolidated and absorbed during the dormant periods. The old soft lime mortars also allowed a degree of movement to be accommodated without revealing any clear indications of settlement. In areas where the local stone tended to be permeable there was often a need either to render externally with a lime–sand mix or to apply coatings of limewash. Limewash coatings had to be built up in stages to achieve adequate protection and required the addition of a waterproofing agent. Beeswax and linseed oil are known to have been used, but it was the more usual practice to add hot tallow tempered with alum, which helped to bind the mix because the fat was saponified by the lime to form waterinsoluble calcium soap compounds. The chemical conversion also acted as a hardening agent and inhibited surface wear. All masonry work progressed in lengths using the virga-geometralis, which was a measuring rod about 6 feet (1.8 m) in length. A simple plumb bob (pedicula) fixed the vertical and an elementary level, termed a coaequo, the horizontal (Fig. 27). Stones in freestanding columns should be naturally bedded but at times they may be found face bedded, which\n\n27.

Similarly mullions and associated features need to be naturally bedded, but tracery has to be placed in a way that ensures it is set at right angles to the line of thrust (Fig. 13, see bedding planes). Some documents may contain references to tooth bedding, which is another term for vertical bedding. Reuse of Old Stone Reference has already been made to the Saxons reclaiming brick and stone from Roman works for church building (spoila); this habit was continued by the Normans, who in turn also reused stone that had been produced during Saxon times. Throughout the medieval period it was usual to recycle materials from redundant buildings and ruins, a practice which continued on a regular basis until quarrying developed and became more productive. Quoins that are out of proportion to the rest of the building, over-sized lintels and stones which contrast with the remainder in colour, size and texture are some of the indications that they have come from elsewhere. The emergence of a separate quarrying industry had the effect of increasing the availability of new stone at lower cost, but much of the rubble for core filling in walls (the hearting) still came from old or demolished buildings. It is sometimes difficult to be certain of the origin of certain stones in medieval walling, but often there are subtle signs which can provide good clues and lines of investigation. A close examination may well show that various stones have been cut or dressed in a different way, and there may also be traces of another mortar around the bedding areas of the stone. Long lengths of stone taken from another building were much used as they frequently made good lintels and saved a widespread search for something of equivalent size. Occasionally pieces of broken monuments, memorials and similar are also found in walls, usually in the less conspicuous parts. Reclamation was not only directed towards the stone used in walling but also involved various other features and elements. Parts or the complete stonework for windows, doorways, arches and similar items often came from another building. The Dissolution of the Monasteries later provided a valuable source for high-quality artefacts, including capitals, columns and bases. Some of this may have weathered differently to other stones within the same church, and the signs of this may still be discernable even after such a long period of time. It was often the practice to lay reused stone in reverse, with the original face set inwards and the back becoming the new outer face. Another technique was the recutting, trimming or the redressing of the face of the stone.\n\nHistoric Churches.indd 50\n\n21/03/2011 11:16:48\n\nthe construction of churches\n\n~ 51\n\nBuildings that had been badly damaged by fire invariably became a useful source of supply. When subjected to extreme heat, the structure of stone changes, usually identifiable through an alteration in colour. Stones from igneous formations, such as granite, can suffer a considerable loss of strength after a fire and are less likely to have been utilised in this way. Heat can change the colour of limestone to brown, buff or reddish brown, while sandstone normally goes pink or reddish brown, the brown/ red in both stones being a reaction from hydrated iron oxide. White magnesian limestone tends to turn grey. In most cases the difference in colour only occurs on the face directly exposed to the heat of fire, it not having penetrated into the full body of the stone. If individual stones spaced far apart show signs of fire damage, and the mortar all around has been left untouched, this is a clear sign that the stone has been taken from salvage. On the other hand, if all stones in a particular area have been discoloured, it is a good pointer to a fire having occurred in that vicinity; the state of the original lime mortar should be included in any examination. Normally such a change occurs on the inside of a building only, but it can occasionally be found on the outside face if there has been close proximity to intense heat. When reclaimed dressed-stone artefacts have been in contact with fire, this will show up not only in the colour but often in fine crazing to the surfaces. Components worked from sandstone are also likely to have suffered much splitting if, after being affected by heat, they have undergone a sudden drop in temperature through watering. Coade Stone As industrialisation expanded and new materials began to be developed, the quest for innovative and labour-saving ideas came very much to the fore, particularly in the latter part of the eighteenth century. The introduction of Coade stone is one example and was an idea that enjoyed much popularity until production ceased in 1840. First developed in 1769 as a unique form of artificial stone, it came to the market as a ready-made labour-saving product. It was cast in a variety of tastes and fashions, and can be found in later churches and in the addit"
