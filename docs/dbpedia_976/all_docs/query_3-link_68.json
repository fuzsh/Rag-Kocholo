E. Street’s design.\n\nExtant sources will be examined for what they reveal about the day-to-day oversight of the project, the working relationship between architect and patron, and the keen interest shown in the church by Emily Jane Monk, especially. The role of the sisters will be considered in the context of the wider phenomenon of female architectural patronage during the period, along with the status and sexual identity of middle-class women, including the rise of feminist ideals because this will shed light on the life and activities of two truly extraordinary women of the age. We are left with the thought, could this remarkable building, and thus the career of Street himself, have been secured in the way they were without the Monk sisters intervention and determination?\n\nAlex Bremner is Professor of Architectural History at the University of Edinburgh and the award-winning author of Imperial Gothic: Religious Architecture and High Anglican Culture in the British Empire,\n\nc.1840-17870.\n\nTicket prices\n\nMonk Sister’s talk: £10\n\nTickets to these events are now available on Eventbrite: click here:\n\nFor further information or to book a ticket directly please email churchadmin@sjtl.org.\n\nHow can I become a Friend of St James the Less?\n\nEveryone is welcome to become a Friend of St James the Less, regardless of beliefs or style of worship – you do not have to be a member of the congregation.\n\nWhat do I get for being involved?\n\nLeave your mark in ensuring this remarkable building is preserved for the future, as a functioning church, a magnificent venue and a prime example of High Victorian Gothic Architecture\n\nSupport simply as a Friend and/or serve on the Friends’ Committee\n\nContribute to keeping the church in good decorative working order\n\nReceive regular newsletter updates from the Friends’ Committee (at least twice a year)\n\nInformation on, and participation in, our fundraising\n\nInvitations to events organised by the Friends’ Committee\n\nHands-on involvement in the conservation work where this is possible\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe annual membership fee is just £20 — you can join online or by downloading and completing the form below and arranging a standing order with your bank.\n\nCan I support the current life & mission of the church?\n\nAs part of your membership, you will be most welcome to join the Friends of St James the Less in Mission and you will receive an additional Prayer Letter every six months with news of our current activities as a church serving the parish.\n\nYou can also donate using the link here and choosing the buildings renovation option from the dropdown box to donate towards the renovations, to support the current life and mission choose from General or Open Door Meal options.\n\nHow will the Friends of St James the Less make a difference?\n\nThe Friends of SJTL will help conserve, restore, maintain, and improve the fabric, furnishings and fittings of St James the Less, Westminster, in conjunction with the PCC.\n\nAs a Friend you will be eligible to serve on the Friends of SJTL Committee, which is a sub-committee of the PCC.
