The bell tower gave warning to people of the encroaching inferno. \nThe warm and inviting interior features significant stained glass windows. St. James also commissioned works by women artists, uncommon at the time. One example is the baptismal font located at the entrance to the church, carved in Rome from Carrara marble by the American sculptor, Augusta Freeman. The Arts-and-Crafts Gothic Revival hand-stenciled designs of artist E. J. Neville Stent adorn the walls. \nSelf-guided tour booklets will be available for all guests and docents will be available for questions.\nOrgan performances and demonstrations will take place throughout the day.",
