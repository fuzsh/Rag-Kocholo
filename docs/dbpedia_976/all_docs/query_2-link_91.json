        "text": "Melville & Company's Wolverhampton Directory of 1851 shows that St. John's Square seems to have been quite a fashionable part of Wolverhampton to live in. Under the heading of \"Gentry\" there are 6 people listed as well as a professor of music (who was also the organist of St. John's), a portrait and historical painter, two school masters, a dressmaker and a furrier. In addition there were two boarding houses, a ladies seminary, and a classical & commercial school. Samuel Tonks is also listed. He was the owner of the brass and bell foundry at the western end of the Square, and lived in Church Street. Also listed was \"James Gibbons, factor, St. John's Square.\"\n\nSt. James' Square, at this time, only had one person listed under the heading \"Gentry\", while the rest of the Square's 32 dwellings were occupied by roughly the same professions as its counterpart. It too boasted of two ladies schools, two teachers, a day and evening school (run by Charles Trevor) and Monsieur Willenboard Buscot, a professor of the French language. John Fell & Co. were the Brass Founders of this Square. The notable ale house in St. James's Square was the George Inn, sometimes referred to as the \"George III\". In 1851 John Lane was the victualler.\n\nAs well as the same respectable trades, as in St. John's Square, St. James' had two coal merchants and two corn and seed merchants. Perhaps these last two trades were carried on in this Square because of its close proximity to both the canal and railway.\n\nThe electoral register for 1879/80 shows that St. John's Square was still holding on to its status, with a surprisingly similar list of occupations to that of 1851.\n\nThe squares in the twentieth century\n\nIn the 1901 Red Book there were seven people listed under \"Private\" in St. John's Square. Other listings of interest are the \"Central Registry Office\" and, under the heading of \"India Rubber Goods Merchants\", is the \"Wearwell Cycle Accessories Co\". Also shown is A. G. Haselock (jnr), a file and rasp manufacturer. There were three credit drapers, no less than three professors of music, and a pianoforte dealer. The square was probably becoming more commercial and less residential with the continued expansion of Wolverhampton as an industrial centre, and the development for industrial purposes of the land south of the square.\n\nNo \"Private Residents\" at all are listed for St. James' Square in 1901. There were only six trades people noted:\n\nThe George III pub was still in existence, and Mulliners, the printers, and Cozens, provision merchants, were also there. The three of them remained in the square right up until its demolition. By 1930, surprisingly enough, some of the families living there are still the same, but again this is more noticeably so in St. John's Square than in St. James'."
