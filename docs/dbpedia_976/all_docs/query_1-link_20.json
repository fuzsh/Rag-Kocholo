        "text": "Dear St. James Academy Families:\n\nThe St. James Academy Parents’ Association (formerly known as Patrons) would like to welcome you to the 2023-2024 school year! For those of you that are unfamiliar with the PA, we are a volunteer organization made up of parents, teachers, faculty and staff who are all dedicated to the enhancement of our children’s experience at the Academy. As a SJA parent, you are automatically a member of the Parents’ Association. We foster family-school partnerships by creating opportunities for community building, teacher & staff appreciation and fundraising. We promote school spirit and pride!\n\nThe PA uses its resources, both manpower and monetary, to support the efforts of the staff and to provide learning and enrichment opportunities for our children. We rely on the talent of Academy parents with interest or expertise in areas such as website design, marketing, graphic design, communications, business acumen, interior/event design, flower arranging, cooking, baking, crafting, writing, organizing, event planning, hospitality, merchandising, and much, much more! Every parent/guardian is already a member of the PA and we encourage you to get involved.\n\nThis year, we are opening up all the PA sponsored event SignUp Geniuses (SUGs) at the beginning of the school year. We kindly ask that every household do their best to sign up for at least three volunteer slots. The Foxhound Festival, Christmas Shoppe, Jingle Bell Junction, Teacher Appreciation Week and The Pound (school store) all rely on volunteers in order to operate. We cannot run these events without your support. Volunteer your time. Join a committee. Chair an event. Donate what you can. Jump in and help. Every hour volunteered makes a huge difference! There are school day, evening and remote opportunities and requests to send items into the school. Our goal is to provide opportunities for everyone to get involved, and we aim to accommodate all types of schedules. So, please fill the volunteer slots. Many hands make the job easier! Sign up to volunteer by clicking on the events above.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at school, committee meetings, SJA community events and fundraisers. We look forward to getting to know you. Thank you for being a part of this very special St. James Academy community. Foxhounds, let’s make 2023-2024 the best year yet!\n\nWith Endless Gratitude,\n\nThe 2023-2024 SJA Parents’ Association Board"
