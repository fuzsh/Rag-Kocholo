It also presents explanations and illustrations of a variety of different ways of hanging and ringing bells, and offers some sound clips. There is a page devoted to the Bellfoundry Museum, including the schedule of open hours.\n\nIn its earliest 4-octave carillons, the Taylor bellfoundry used a novel technology to get more sound from the treble end of the range. For details, see our page on Taylor's doubled trebles.\n\nAmerican representatives:\n\nFrom time to time, the Taylor foundry has sold bells into the American market through various local firms. It is unclear whether any of those firms held an exclusive right to market Taylor bells in America, and reliable evidence of such relationships has not yet been found.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1992, there were about a dozen orders, from single bells up to a set of 24, shipped to the Maas-Rowe Company of Escondido, California. It is presumed that Maas-Rowe provided the design and controls as well as installation.\n\nHistory:\n\nBill Hibbert has made available the Taylor foundry history up to 1960.\n\nEffective 1 July 2005, John Taylor Bellfounders merged with Eayre & Smith, Bellhangers. The merged firm operated under the name Taylors Eayre & Smith, using the foundry property in Loughborough. This firm went into administration (i.e., bankruptcy) in September 2007.\n\nEffective 19 October 2009, the bellfoundry resumed operating under the historic name of John Taylor & Co., with new ownership and management.\n\nThe English Wikipedia article about the foundry has a description, a history, and a list of some of its more notable products.\n\nA photo slide show has 8 pictures (mostly historic) of the history of the Taylor foundry. One of them shows the foundry carillon in its purpose-built tower.\n\nA news article about the foundry has two historic photos of great bells being shipped - Great Paul (for St.Paul Cathedral) in 1881, and the bourdon of the carillon of Washington National Cathedral in 1961.\n\nA news article (De'20) reports a grant to the Taylor foundry for building repairs and training of artisans; with 2 photos of the foundry.\n\nReturn to Indexes to bellfoundries.\n\n[TowerBells Home Page] [Site data top page] [Credits and Disclaimers] [Feedback]\n\nThis index page was built from the database on 02-Jul-01 and last revised on 27-Apr-24."
