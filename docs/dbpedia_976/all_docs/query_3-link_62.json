        "text": "1907 photo of chancel\n\nHope-Jones Organ Co.\n\nElmira, N.Y. (1907)\n\nElectro-pneumatic action\n\n4 manuals, 59 registers\n\nIn 1907, the Hope-Jones Organ Co. of Elmira, N.Y. rebuilt the 1885 Hilborne L. Roosevelt organ. Hope-Jones also provided a new electric four-manual horseshoe console. The pipecounts and total number of ranks have not yet been determined.\n\nThe organ was dedicated on Thursday, February 27, 1907, at 8 pm. Participating were the choirs of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and St. James's Church; organists Felix Lamond (Trinity Chapel), Frank Sill Roge rs (St. Peters', Albany), and Waler Henry Hall (the Cathedral and St. James'); and the Rev. Ernest Voorbis (Precentor of the Cathedral) as Cantor. Following is the description from the inaugural program: St. James' Church, Madison Avenue, New York City, entirely lacks that resonance which is so helpful to musical tone. Its restricted chancel arch, the peculiar formation of its roof, and the presence of cushioned and carpeted pews, all tend to destroy the beauty of music rendered in the building.\n\nThe organ installed in this Church by Roosevelt in the year 1885, though a good instrument in itself, has always proved disappointing. The chamber in which it was placed is very lofty, but except for two comparatively small arched openings in its lower part, it is entirely cut off from the Church.\n\nLast spring, the late Mrs. J. H. Linsly donated $11,000 for the rebuilding of the organ, which naturally required attention after its twenty years' hard wear and tear.\n\nUpon the advice of the organist, Mr. Walter Henry Hall, it was decided to place the matter in the hands of an Acoustician and Scientist, Mr. Robt. Hope-Jones, M.I.E.E., late of England.\n\nA contract was therefore entered into with the Hope-Jones Organ Company of Elmira and New York City. That company has so rebuilt the organ that it now floods the building in every part with a majestic volume of tone that recalls to the listener the effects heard in the Cathedrals of Europe.\n\nPractically all the stops of the old Roosevelt organ have been retained, but the tone of these has been increased and carried into the Church by scientific means. Foundation tone of great amplitude of vibration is provided by means of the Hope-Jones Tibias, Tubas, and Phonons; and this massive background of foundation tone sweeps what was before lost, into the Church.\n\nThe smooth Tuba, enclosed in a cement swell-box weighing four tons, is placed at the back of the chamber. Its strength of tone is controlled by laminated lead shutters. The pipes of the Tibia Profunda are laid horizontally on the floor, with their open ends pointing directly into the transept of the Church.\n\nThe Swell organ is enclosed in another box of solid cement provided with laminated lead shutters; and the Choir organ stands in its old wooden swell box. The shades for the swell and choir organs are connected mechanically with their respective swell pedals, but those for the Tuba organ have the advantage of electric action, which is much more prompt and easy of operation. These latter shades are under the control, not only of the usual balanced swell pedal, but also of a small key fixed on the lower edge of the music desk. The key and the pedal move simultaneously so that the organist can see the position of his swell shades at any moment.\n\nThe whole of the organ, together with its blowing machinery, has been kept within the organ chamber – the only exception being the console, which stands where the old one did, in the chancel, and eight pipes of the Contra Tibia Clausa, which have been bracketed on the transept wall.\n\nHope-Jones Console at St. James\n\nThe keyboards are provided with double touch in order that expression from the fingers may be obtained. Stop keys of the usual Hope-Jones pattern are used, instead of the old-fashioned draw stop knobs, but these stop keys are arranged in an inclined semi-circle, so that all may be equi-distant from the organist. Each keyboard is provided with a suitable bass tablet, which brings into operation an automatic pedal stop and coupler controller. This suitable bass tablet ensures the pedal bass being at all times correct as to quality and power of tone, whatever varying combinations may be in use when the manual is being played upon. A series of combination keys disposed upon each of the manuals enables the organist to change the position of his stops and stop keys without lifting his fingers from the keyboard upon which he is playing.\n\nThe pressures of wind employed are 3½, [5?], 10 and 20 inches.\n\nAll the combination action can be adjusted by the organist at the console. The pedal board is of the standard A.G.O. pattern."
