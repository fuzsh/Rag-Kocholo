        "text": "President’s Palette\n\nAll around me are signs of an early spring in Annapolis. I enjoy the longer days of sunlight and look for the crocus and snowdrops to poke out their pretty faces in the garden. I also unfortunately find some things left over from the weeks indoors through the winter - especially the way that my spring clothes have all gotten a little smaller at the same time. My Italian husband is a wonderful cook, so I might blame it all on him.\n\nThe paints in my palette have also taken on some strange variations in hue over the winter months. All of that mixing with water and adding new pigment into old takes away their true value, limits their strength and decreases their ability to “do their job” well. I hope to create new paintings with more strength and vitality so now it is time to empty the palette and fill it with fresh pigment, add a different one that I have not experimented with yet and purchase that new brush I have been looking at. Maybe I should do this while jogging in place to help with the “wardrobe issue”? Two birds with one stone.\n\nSome other signs of Spring are all the activities we have coming up; so it’s time to come out of hibernation and join in the workshops and free demo available. Please also submit your paintings to the upcoming exhibits that the Baltimore Watercolor Society is offering. For those of you going to the Salmagundi on Fifth Avenue to have a private viewing of the American Watercolor Society in April, I look forward to sharing that day with you. Our enthusiasm and energy are growing. We sold every seat on our motorcoach within one week and now have a waiting list for this trip. Maybe we will need two buses next year!\n\nHappy painting!\n\nBWS President\n\n“When judging an exhibit there are many aspects that I take into account. Initially, I walk around and look at all the work being judged. In doing so, I mentally take note of certain works that sort of jump off the wall. I then proceeded to take a much longer look at each work, as some work is more like a whisper rather than a shout. At this point I ask, “has the artist clearly demonstrated basic technical skill, or are there obvious errors that would cause me to eliminate the work from contention?” Some of the elements to consider are color, form, line, shape, space and texture.\n\nTechnical skill is expected but that is just beginning. Has the artist engaged me in the process, allowed me to be part of the experience? I ask myself, “would I enjoy looking at this work each day, hopefully noticing some aspect I may have not noticed before? Could I live with this painting?”\n\nThe final consideration is presentation, as this can enhance or detract from the overall experience. As much attention should be given at this stage as during the making of the work.” ~ David Lawton, Juror of Awards\n\nThe Baltimore Watercolor Society is exhibiting works from Signature Members at the Maryland House of Delegates on the 3rd Floor Baltimore County Wing.\n\nThe exhibition runs from January 23, 2024, through March 22, 2024.\n\nThe building is open to the public Monday through Friday 7:30 am - 5:30 pm, and is closed to the public on weekends.\n\nBecause the Legislature is in session during the exhibit, parking is very limited. We offer the following plan for attending the exhibit:\n\nFrom Rowe Boulevard bear right on to Calvert Street. Once you are on Calvert Street you will see a public parking garage on your left (Gotts Court Garage). Park there, and from the garage walk right on Calvert Street to right on Bladen Street. Enter the Maryland House of Delegates at the main entrance on Bladen Street. At the Information Desk in the main lobby, go right and follow that corridor to the end. Elevators will be on your right. Go to the 3rd floor, the elevator will open next to the exhibit hall.\n\nThe walk from the garage parking lot to the Maryland House of Delegates is two blocks long. There is an hourly fee for parking.\n\nAnnouncement of Plans for the 2024 Mid-Atlantic Regional Watercolor Exhibition\n\nby Jim Sandford, BWS Mid-Atlantic Exhibition Chair\n\nWe are excited to announce Russell Jewell (AWS, NWS, TWSA, ED.D) as the juror and workshop instructor for the BWS 2024 Mid-Atlantic Regional Watercolor Exhibition.\n\nRussell is an internationally recognized plein air painter with signature memberships in the American Watercolor Society, National Watercolor Society and The Transparent Watercolor Society of America. His work has traveled with the American Watercolor Society exhibition. Russell’s accomplishments include a doctorate in Art Education from the University of Georgia and a Fulbright Memorial fund scholarship to Japan. His most recent awards include: 2023 Best of Show at Edisto Island Plein Air, 2023 First Place at Quick Draw Mountain Maryland Plein Air, and 2023 Best Boat Painting at Gloucester Arts Festival. In October 2023 Jewell judged the Georgia Color Plein Air Competition sponsored by Olmsted Plein Air. Russell is represented by Wells Gallery at the Sanctuary on Kiawah Island, SC. His art and writing were published in a feature article, “Under the Sicilian Sun” in Plein Air Magazine, October/November 2023. Additional information can be seen at: russelljewell.com.\n\nThe 2024 Mid-Atlantic Exhibition will once again take place at the Arts Barn and Kentlands Mansion Galleries in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and will follow a schedule very similar to the that of the 2023 exhibition. Following is a list of dates. Please mark your calendars and look for details in future BWS communications.\n\nCaFÉ system open for entries: June 7 through Aug 7\n\nNotification of accepted entrants: Aug 30\n\nPainting drop-off: Oct 7, 10am-2pm\n\nAnnouncement of awards: Oct 8\n\nWorkshop: Oct 8-10\n\nExhibition open: Oct 11, 2024 through Jan 5, 2025\n\nOpening reception and awards presentation: Nov 10, 2-4pm\n\nWe look forward to seeing your submitted paintings and welcoming you to the planned events."
