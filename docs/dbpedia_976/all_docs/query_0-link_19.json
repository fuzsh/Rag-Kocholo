        "text": "Located in the Baltimore County of Maryland, the St. James Church is the beautiful historic Episcopal cathedral that is located at peaceful terrain of the Monkton in Baltimore County. Visiting a church should not be only limited to Sundayâ€™s or Christmas. You should sometimes visit the stunning chapel just to marvel at the beauty of the church. The church is a 60x30 foot long brick chapel featuring the Georgian ecclesiastical architecture. The interiors of the church were renovated recently with box pews and stone walls."
