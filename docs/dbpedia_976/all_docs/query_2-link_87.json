        "text": "1942\n\nIn January, Annabelle Clinton, President of the Catholic Women’s League, and Bill and Mary Meier, tired of traveling to Sts. Cornelius & Cyprian Catholic Church in Bunkerhill or other Churches in Lansing every Sunday, met with a small group of Mason residents, namely the Catholic Women’s League members and other area residents and petitioned (dated January 15th) the Most Reverend Joseph H. Albers, Bishop of Lansing, for a Catholic Church in Mason, Michigan. Forty three Mason Area Catholics signed the petition. Part of the reasoning for a local church was gas rationing that was in effect due to the war effort and many people could not travel to services at Sts. Cornelius and Cyprian Catholic Church at Bunker Hill or in Lansing. The new Mission Church was named by the Most Reverend Joseph H. Albers, Bishop of Lansing and honors St. James the Greater, one of the twelve apostles, son of Zebedee and a fisherman. He is the patron saint of pilgrims, Spain, Guatemala and Nicaragua. His Feast Day is July 25th. The first Mass in the newly organized St. James Mission was celebrated by Fr. Charles Keating (Secretary to Bishop Albers) in the Chapel of the Ball Funeral Home on South Jefferson Street, Mason, Michigan, on December 25th, Christmas Day, at 10:30 AM with 75 in attendance. Fr. Keating (Ordained on June 3, 1939) celebrated Mass with the Mass Kit used by Bishop Albers while serving as a Chaplain in World War I. Adult altar boys were William Meier and Charles Schmitter. For the next twelve years, Jean Ball, from the Ball Funeral Home, and later the Ball-Dunn Funeral Home, would make sure the Chapel was ready for Mass each Sunday. Fr. Keating called her his “Altar Boy”. Fr. Keating was also the traveling Priest for St. Peter’s Church in Eaton Rapids and Chaplain for the Lansing Police and Fire Departments. Signatories of the petition were James Hughes, Glenard M. Earl, John Deneka, Mary C. DeRose, Virginia S. Simone, Tony Simone, Rosalie V. Griffin, James M. Servine, Jeannie Fontana, Mary Walzak, Alice C. Bell, Helen J. Bell, Harold C. Bell, Anne Hughes, William G. Meier, Vera Hoover, Margaret Cunningham, Bernita Patrick, Charles Clinton, Annabelle Clinton, Margaret Burgess, Francis D. Burgess, Willamina Burgess, Elizabeth Raymond, Ambrose Raymond, Wilma Lehman, Erurni Lehman, Marguerite Cave, Ann Lippincott, Florence Hughes, Mary C. Meier, Jennie Pyard, Lucille Graham, Edward Pyard, Frank Pyard, Connie L. Brush, George R. Clinton MD, Elizabeth J. Clinton, Marie Peek, William A. Peek, Mrs. Ralph Noble, Kathryn Felton and Mildred Felton. The official statement from the Lansing Diocese read as follows: “Due to the restricted driving which is necessitated by the war effort of our country, Catholics will be given an opportunity to hear Mass in Mason. Through the generosity of the public-minded citizens of Mason, it becomes possible to afford the Catholics in the City of Mason and it’s surrounding locality an opportunity of serving their God by attendance at religious services and of assisting their county by a more limited use of materials vital to our nation’s war effort” New Mission members included Sue Bergeon (Parsons), Tom Bergeon, the Charles and Ruth Schmitter family and Kathryn Deneka (Laws). Our Pope was Pope Pius XII. Food rationing was in force, the Battle of Midway took place, White Christmas and the Pennsylvania Polka were hits, Casablanca was movie of the year, a stamp was 3 cents, milk was 26 cents and bread was eight cents\n\n1943\n\nTimothy Joseph Glynn was baptized on March 14th. The Mr. & Mrs. Club was started for the purpose of discussing problems regarding marriage, children and religion. In later years it evolved into the Euchre Club.

The focal point of the new Mission Church was the altar and tabernacle purchased by Mary DeRose, one of the petitioners to establish the St. James Mission in 1942. It was used from 1954 to 1982 and from 1992 to the present time. Little tiles were added to the tabernacle in 1982. Above and behind it was an oak and bronze crucifix suspended on a bronze chain with a backdrop of royal crimson velvet drapes. The Catholic Women’s League (President Betty Guerriero) purchased the new pews with proceeds from Feather Parties held at the old Legion Building. A copper envelope containing the Ingham County News clippings and pictures of the 1953 ground breaking ceremony and a brief history of the St. James Mission were included in the cornerstone.

JAMES PARISH, MASON, MICHIGAN”, was issued by the Most Reverend Joseph H. Albers, Bishop of Lansing. We had the first recorded Parish Newsletter or Bulletin on July 24th. Volume I, Number 1: It read, “GOD MAKES HIS HOME IN MASON”!!! “Tomorrow, July 25, is the feast of St. James the Apostle, the patron of our Parish. It will be a historic and significant day in the history of the Parish, for on this day the Most Blessed Sacrament will be reserved in the tabernacle on our altar for the very first time. Also, on this day, the first resident Pastor of St. James Parish will be installed in a public ceremony. Henceforth, God will dwell in our midst. Christ, in His tabernacle home, will become Mason’s First Citizen. Truly, then, will our Blessed Savior be Emmanuel---or “God with us.” We should visit Him frequently in His tabernacle Home; we should never forget that it is for love of us that He makes Himself a “Prisoner of Love” in our midst. Our conduct in the Church should reflect our faith in His Real Presence on the Altar. If we respect His Presence and His Home, we can rest assured that He will fill our hearts with the zeal and determination to follow Him in our daily living.” On July 25th, (the Feast of St. James the Apostle) Fr. Paul J. DeRose was installed by Rt. Rev. Msgr. Herman Fedewa of St. Mary Cathedral as the first resident pastor of St. James and at this occasion the Mission was made a permanent Parish.
