        "text": "Description\n\nElegance and craftsmanship on 3.42 acres of bucolic beauty! This large home in prestigious Monkton Farms was built with love by these original owners and designed with an open floor plan for entertaining. The main level features a fully remodeled gourmet kitchen with all granite countertops, an island with a gas range, a double wall oven, and a Sub-Zero refrigerator. From the kitchen, you can access the fully screened-in deck enclosure specifically designed to put you in the middle of nature; perfect for meals, coffee time, entertainment, or meditation. Leading off the kitchen is the great room with a vaulted two-story ceiling, fireplace, and custom-designed architectural windows allowing maximum sunlight. The open concept living/dining room combination is perfect for entertaining guests and comes complete with a fully built-in wet bar. This home features two owners' suites. The first is located on the main level with a fireplace, attached remodeled full bathroom, and a walk-in closet. The other is on the second level with an attached full bathroom. The main level office/den is located off the entrance foyer. Custom woodwork of crown molding and wainscoting throughout add to the elegance of the home. Stereo speakers are installed in the living room, dining room, great room, pool room, and deck. Ascending the grand staircase you will find a loft with cedar closets that lead to four bedrooms. Two bedrooms have attached, dedicated full bathrooms and the third and fourth bedrooms share a full bathroom. Dual-zoned heating and air conditioning and a whole house fan will keep the entire home any temperature you desire. The lower level of the home can be accessed from the inside of the home or from the interior of the garage. The separate garage entrance to the lower level gives you the ability to use the lower level as an in-law suite if desired. The lower level features a den, a full bathroom, bedroom, recreation room, wet bar, and two rooms that can be used for storage or workshops, etc. The lower-level bedroom can also be used as an in-home workout/exercise room and will accommodate a treadmill and other pieces of exercise equipment if desired. Two high-efficiency hot water heaters were installed in 2019 and 2020. The dual-zoned hot water system is propane-fired, assuring you will never run out of hot water. Designed to be extra sturdy and enduring, all exterior walls are constructed with 2x6's and all the walls and attic have blown insulation for energy efficiency and sound insulation. The windows and doors are all double studded and the roofing joists were custom built by an Amish builder. All the windows are high-grade Pella Windows. The dual-zoned HVAC system was recently replaced. A full house commercial filtration system was installed in 2020. The outside of the home is nestled in over 3.4 acres of park-like beauty boasting a large deck, screened-in porch, and a protruding gazebo. From Monkton Farms road you will find many trails readily available for hiking that go all the way down to the Gunpowder River. Just five minutes away is Roseada Farms where you can get fresh beef, eggs, and produce. Also, 5 minutes away is the Manor Tavern restaurant that specializes in a farm-to-table menu. Other local attractions close to home are Graul's Market, Wegmans, and the Milton Inn. Be sure not to miss the Saint James Church Thanksgiving Blessing of the Hounds. This event is truly worth watching. The NCR trails, Oregon Ridge and Inverness Brewing are just minutes away. Take a tour of this majestic home today!"
