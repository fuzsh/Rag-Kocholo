        "text": "SHAFTESBURY, a corporate and market town and municipal borough, on the Witshire border, is 102 miles from London, 28 N-E from Dorchester, 20 S-W from Salisbury, 15 E-N-E from Sherborne, 8 E from Sturminster Newton and 12 N-E from Blandford; it is in the Northern division of the county, petty sessional division and union of its name, hundred of Monkton-up-Wimborne, rural deanery of Shaftesbury (Shaftesbury portion), archdeanery of Dorset and diocese of Salisbury. The town is said to be mentioned as a borough in the Domesday Survey (1086), but was first incorporated, according to Hutchins (Hist.Dorset, 1774, and later ed.), by Queen Elizabeth. The earliest known charter is that of Jas.I. granted in 1604, and confirmed by Chas. II. Under the provisions of the \"municipal Corporations Act, 1835\" (5 & 6 Wm. IV., c.76), the corporation was reformed, and now consists of a mayor, four aldermen and twelve councillors, who also act as the Urban Sanitary Authority. The borough returned two members to Parliament in 23 Edw.I. (1204-5), and continued to do so until the passing of the \"Reform Act 1832\" (2 & 3 Wm.IV., c 45), by which the number was reduced to one, and by the \"Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885 (48 & 49 Vict., c. 23), the representation was merged in that of the Northern division of the county. The nearest railway station is Semley, 3 miles N-E, on the Salisbury and Yeovil branch of the South Western railway, opened May 2, 1859, affording communication with Portsmouth, Southampton, London, and also the West and North of England. Shaftesbury is a very ancient town, and is said to be the Caer Paladwr of the Britons, its present name being in part derived from the A.S. \"Sceaft\", the point of a hill; Roman coins have been found here; an abbey, with a nunnery of the Benedictine order, was established here during the Saxon period: the site has been ascertained, but scarcely any remains of the buildings are now extant: it was, however, once a place of great resort for pilgrims, and it is said to have had some of the richest endowments in England. King Edward the Martyr, murdered at Corfe Castle by his mother-in-law Elfrida, A.D. 978, was buried here. King Canute died in Shaftesbury on the 12th November, 1035, and was buried in Winchester. In 1861 a stone coffin, containing a skeleton, and having also therein an abbot's crosier and gold ring, was discovered whilst some excavations were being made on the site of the old abbey.\n\nShaftesbury is situated on an eminence, the approach to which is by a steep ascent, its elevation, 700 feet above sea level, affords it a fine bracing air. The supply of water is derived from a large reservoir underground, pumped by steam power into an upper reservoir, whence the whole town is supplied. The streets are lighted with gas by a company. Some of the houses are very ancient, but the upper portion of the town is modern, and contains a large number of good houses, with excellent shops, hotels, banks and other buildings: many of the old buildings have been replaced by a better class of houses, and the streets have been much improved. St. James', or the lower portion of the town, consists chiefly of small tenements. A little to the south and west from the Holy Trinity church is a delightful promenade called the Park, sheltered from the north winds by a row of trees, partially extending over the walk: the view over the adjacent plains from this spot is most pleasing: this walk is one of the connections between the higher and lower portions of the town, and contains the Russian trophy gun mounted on its carriage; it has recently been continued by a path called Pine walk to St. John's Hill.\n\nThe borough formerly comprised parts of the parishes of Holy Trinity, St. Peter and St. James, which, by order of the County Council have been formed into one parish, called Shaftesbury, under \"Local Government Act, 1894.\" Here were formerly twelve churches; there are now only three-St. Peter, the Holy Trinity and St. James. St. Peter, the most ancient of the churches, is a building of stone and stands in the High street, the architecture of which shows that it was built in the latter part of the 13th century: the interior had succumbed to the influence of time to such an extent that it was pronounced unsafe: it has not been in constant use since 1878, and has only been used for service for a few months in the summer of 1886: since then the tower has been thoroughly repaired at a cost of about �700; a further sum of about �250 is still required to complete the work: it has a nave and square western tower, which contains a peal of 6 of the sweetest toned bells in this county; they are of a great age: this venerable relic of ecclesiastical note is of interest to antiquaries. The register dates from the year 1623.\n\nThe Holy Trinity church, in Bimport street, was rebuilt on the old site in 1842, chiefly in the Early English style: it is a handsome specimen of this kind of architecture, and consists of nave, aisles and large north and south galleries, with choir at west end, north and south porches and a square embattled western tower, 100 feet in height, with pinnacles, and contains 6 bells: the splendid organ was presented at the opening of the church by the late George Thomas esq.: it has a good east window, and will seat 834 people. The register dates from the year 1695. The churchyard of the Holy Trinity contains three handsome avenues of lime trees, shading most of the walks through the burying ground and approaches to the church.\n\nThe parishes of Holy Trinity and St. Peter are consolidated. The living is a rectory, average tithe rent-charge �129, gross yearly value �187, net �161, with residence, in the gift of the Earl of Shaftesbury, and held since 1885 by the Rev. Frederick Ehlvers.\n\nThe church of St. James, in the liberty of Alcester, which is that part of the old parish of St. James not within the municipal limits, is a handsome structure, chiefly Decorated, of greenstone, with Bath stone dressings, rebuilt in 1866-67, at a cost of �3,350, raised by subscriptions: it has a chancel, nave, aisles and vestry, square embattled western tower of 65 feet, with four pinnacles, a clock and 6 bells: the chancel is paved with encaustic tiles: the aisles are divided from the nave by four arches resting on clustered piers with carved capitals: there are two entrances, one through the base of the tower at the western end and the other by a porch on the north side: the front of the porch is a moulded arch carved with capitals on clustered Purbeck marble shafts, with richly moulded bases: at the east end of the north aisle is an organ: the pulpit if of oak, elaborately carved: a stained memorial window was placed in the chancel in 1884, and there are several other stained windows: the interior is fitted with open benches and will seat 440 people. The register dates from the year 1559. The living is a rectory, tithes commuted at �400, average �296, gross yearly value �297, net value �230, with residence in the gift of the Earl of Shaftesbury, and held since 1881 by the Rev. Richard Thurlow M.A. of Trinity College, Dublin, chaplain of Shaftesbury union and surrogate. The parish has, in addition to the churchyard, St. John's burial ground or Bury Litton cemetery, the site of the old church of St. John's, all traces of which are now obliterated: this is at about 150 feet above the level of the main part of the parish.\n\nThe Society of Friends have a meeting house in St. James' street which has about 100 sittings.\n\nA Congregational chapel was completed in 1858 on the site of the former chapel, erected in 1662: it is a handsome building of Bath stone, supported by four massive Corinthian columns of the same: it will seat from 400 to 500 persons, and the expense, �1,300, was raised by voluntary contributions.\n\nThe Wesleyan Methodist chapel, Parsons Pool, erected in 1766, and rebuilt in 1827, will seat 300 persons.\n\nThe Brethren meeting house, Salisbury Street, erected in 1886, will hold 250 worshippers.\n\nThe Town Hall is a handsome edifice, built at the expense of the late Marquess of Westminster; a tower, containing a good clock, was added in 1879 by the corporation, at a cost of �264.\n\nThe Temperance Hall, in Bell street, was opened in the year 1878, at a cost of �775: it is a building of brick and stone, and contains in addition to the offices &c. a spacious hall, 52 feet long by 26 wide, which is used for temperance meetings and lectures and will hold about 500 persons; an ante-room was added in 1883 at a further cost of �60.\n\nThe Company of the 1st Volunteer Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment, have their armoury in Bell street.\n\nThe trade of the town is derived principally from the supply of the neighbouring agricultural villages, and from the sale of cheese and butter, the produce of the superior grazing land in the vicinity.\n\nThe market day is Saturday. A handsome Markethouse, 270 feet long, was erected at the sole expense of the late Marquess of Westminster, in which no tolls are taken.\n\nThe fairs are held on the Saturday before Palm Sunday, on the last Saturday in August, and 23rd of November, for sheep, cattle, cheese and agricultural produce, and pleasure.\n\nA Clerical Library, for the use of the neighbouring clergy, was established, with the assistance of the late Dr. Bray: this is kept in the vestry-room of Holy Trinity church, under the care of the rector, but of late years is not much used.\n\nA Literary Institute, with news-room and library, was established in 1852, under the patronage of the late Marquess of Westminster; in\n\n1894 there were 90 members and 50 lady subscribers; and it is well supplied with newspapers and periodicals, and has a library of about 3,500 volumes, which is now open as a circulating library to other than members.\n\nThe Westminster Memorial Cottage Hospital, in the Park road, was built of local stone with Bath stone dressings, at a cost of �2,000, raised by subscription, in memory of the late Marquess of Westminster, and was opened by the Bishop of Salisbury on March 16th, 1874: over the arch of the front entrance is a fine oriel window with cusped heads, and pierced open parapet, and this is surmounted by a gable, in the face of which are the Westminster arms, carved in bold relief: the lower portion consists of convalescent's room, drug store, bath room, larder, kitchen and scullery; and on the upper floor are two wards, four single wards, and nurses' rooms: the hospital contains twelve beds, and one bed for accidents was added in 1884: the number of in-patients treated in 1893 was 85.\n\nThe charities of this town are numerous and valuable. In Salisbury street are some remarkably handsome almshouses, of very ancient foundation, for men and women, intended to hold 10 men and 16 women; both men and women have an allowance of six shillings per week each; the men's almshouses have been restored, and are a good specimen of Tudor architecture. The late Marquess of Westminster gave �5,000 in 1865 to these charities for the benefit of the women; and �1,000 was added in 1862 by George Wilkins esq. late of this town.\n\nThere are a few other minor charities.\n\nThe population of the municipal borough in 1891 was:- Holy Trinity, 907; St. Peter's, 801; St. James, 950 including 69 officers and inmates in the workhouse. The area of the parishes are, Holy Trinity 353 acres; rateable value �2,795. St. James' 1,798 acres; rateable value �4,361; and St. Peter's, 72 acres; rateable value, �2,722. The population of the municipal borough in 1891 was:- Holy Trinity (part of), 797; St. Peter (part of), 790; and St James (part of), 535;\n\nthese three are now combined in one parish named Shaftesbury. The area of the borough is 156 acres. A portion of St. James beyond the borough has been formed into a parish named Alcester, the remaining portion and the extra municipal parts of Holy Trinity and St. Peter\n\nhave been added to and merged in the parish of Cann. Little Down is a hamlet, three-quarters of a mile north, consisting of a few houses and one farm.\n\nParish Clerks, St.Peter's and Holy Trinity, Eli Brickell; St. James, John Hayter."
