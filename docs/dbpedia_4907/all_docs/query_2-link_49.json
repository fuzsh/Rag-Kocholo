        "text": "Anthony Burgess (born February 25, 1917, Manchester, England—died November 22, 1993, London) was an English novelist, critic, and man of letters whose fictional explorations of modern dilemmas combine wit, moral earnestness, and a note of the bizarre.\n\nTrained in English literature and phonetics, Burgess taught in the extramural department of Birmingham University (1946–50), worked for the Ministry of Education (1948–50), and was English master at Banbury Grammar School (1950–54). He then served as education officer in Malaya and Borneo (1954–59), where he wrote three novels with a Malayan setting.\n\nBack in England he became a full-time and prolific professional writer. Under the pseudonym Anthony Burgess he wrote the novels The Wanting Seed (1962), an antiutopian view of an overpopulated world, and Honey for the Bears (1963). As Joseph Kell he wrote One Hand Clapping (1961) and Inside Mr. Enderby (1963).\n\nA Clockwork Orange (1962; film 1971) made Burgess’s reputation as a novelist of comic and mordant power. The novel is written in a teenage argot of Burgess’s invention, combining elements from British and American slang, Russian, and other sources. It examines society’s unsuccessful attempt to psychologically “rehabilitate” an incurably violent juvenile delinquent. Other novels include The Eve of Saint Venus (1964) and Enderby Outside (1968). The latter is part of a series of humorous novels centred around the lyric poet F.X. Enderby, whom many critics have seen as a stand-in for Burgess himself. His later works include Earthly Powers (1980), The End of the World News (1983), The Kingdom of the Wicked (1985), Any Old Iron (1989), and A Dead Man in Deptford (1993). In his novels Burgess combined linguistic ingenuity and witty erudition with picaresque plots, bizarre story premises, and sharp social satire. Although his vision of modern society is a pessimistic one, his fiction is generally comic."
