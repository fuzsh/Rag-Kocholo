        "text": "Anthony, known in Hell as Angel Dust, is one of the three deuteragonists (alongside Vaggie and Serenity) of Hazbin Hotel: Journey to the Light.\n\nIn life, Angel Dust, then named Anthony, was a gangster and member of a notorious Italian crime family based in New York City. He was naturally raised into the lifestyle of a mafioso, thus all he knew was that kind of life. He was the son of mafia don Henroin, the younger brother of Arackniss - who was favored by his father over him -, and the twin brother of Molly. Growing up, Angel was mentally abused by his father and brother and his mental health declined massively when he was drafted into the military during World War II, where he witnessed the horrors of war first hand. In 1947, Anthony died alone, having overdosed on phencyclidine (PCP), hence his namesake down in Hell.\n\nUpon being reborn in Hell as a spider demon, Angel quickly became involved in degrading sex work and petty crime, the latter of which led him to become acquainted with one of Hell's most infamous Overlords, Valentino, after the moth demon's underlings caught the spider attempting to steal from their boss. Enticed by Valentino's promises of fame, security, and adoration, Angel sold his soul to Valentino for a job at Porn Studios, which subsequently led him to become one of, if not the, biggest adult film superstars and celebrities in Hell, earning recognition from across the seven rings.\n\nIn spite of gaining widespread recognition for his performances in nightclubs and appearances in pornographic films, Angel Dust endured horrifying physical, sexual, and financial abuse at the hands of Valentino throughout his 70 years of servitude. Both financially and sexually exploited, he sought solace in a world of narcotics, sexual indulgence, and hedonistic pursuits, all while hiding his vulnerability behind his larger-than-life attitude and a dark sense of humor. After enduring decades of mistreatment, Angel eventually turned against his pimp, joining Charlie Magne and her startup business, the Hazbin Hotel, becoming the establishment's inaugural success story in breaking free from the clutches of old habits and Valentino's domination.\n\nOver time, his motivations shifted from mere desires for shelter and safety to a genuine commitment to validate Charlie's belief in redemption. This marked a significant transformation as Angel worked towards genuine personal growth and positive change. As his journey unfolded, he formed new friendships, found allies, and confronted his past demons and adversaries, all while grappling with his past under the control of his former pimp and abusive father. His ultimate goal became breaking free from the hold of his former pimp and seeking redemption for his transgressions and learning to love himself, with the aspiration of eventually achieving a place in Heaven.\n\nPersonality\n\nContrary to initial perceptions, Angel Dust possesses a remarkably complex and intricate personality. He projects an outward image of sarcasm, cunning playfulness, and bold, sometimes vexatious sassiness. He uses his sexual and comedic facade as a shield to obscure his inner vulnerability and tumultuous emotional state. Though he actively maintains the façade of a gangster and sex enthusiast, he rarely hesitates to engage in recklessness, often at the expense of others. Despite his seeming lack of empathy, Angel harbors a genuine disdain for his pursuits and life choices. Yet, he initially denies these feelings, instead resorting to a world of substance abuse and sexual encounters to blur the harsh realities he faces.\n\nWhile Angel indulged in vice and uninhibited sexuality might have offered fleeting enjoyment, the association of these experiences with his profession and his abusive ex-pimp, Valentino, gradually eroded any pleasure they could have brought to him. Although he initially portrays a lack of interest in redemption, bragging that his association with the Happy Hotel is motivated by free rent and a room to store all of his gimp suits, Angel's outlook shifted over time. He sincerely developed a desire for self-improvement, though he grappled with lingering doubts about his capability of redemption. Even subsequent to breaking free from Valentino's grip, he grapples with drug withdrawal and managing his behavior – a result of his prolonged exposure to that way of life. Nonetheless, Angel remains a very strong and confident person, bragging that his defiance helps him get through it, and he will do anything for the people he cares about.\n\nAs a result of his determination to safeguard his more vulnerable side, Angel Dust has a preemptively defensive personality. He conceals significant portions of his authentic, sensitive self, believing it to be a necessary measure for his self-preservation. Anticipating a lack of kindness from those around him, he's taken aback when Charlie surprisingly extends monetary help after he agreed to participate in the Happy Hotel project, ensuring that he no longer would have to sell his body for money. His inherent difficulty in trusting others stems from the enduring trauma inflicted by Valentino's abusive treatment. This is particularly poignant as Angel had genuinely cared for Valentino and believed in their mutual affection. In a subsequent instance, when Charlie attempts to offer solace upon sensing his distress, Angel's response is one of vehement defensiveness. He forcefully dismisses her attempt at consolation, expressing his anger by rebuffing her and flipping her off before departing. Initially, he only sought comfort from Cherri Bomb when it comes to his internal battles, while he either feigns well-being or reacts angrily when others attempt to empathize with his struggles.\n\nAngel is a serial prankster, a trait he picked up and shares with his sister Molly. He consistently engages in lighthearted mischief directed at the fellow residents of the Hazbin Hotel, laughing hysterically at their reactions. He puts dildos in Vaggie's dresser, plants gay pornographic magazines and a TV in Alastor's office, scares Husk with cucumbers and water, switches Baxter's vials when he isn't looking, and even employs prank guns to terrify enemies or rapacious sinners who don't take \"no\" for an answer. He switches between playful and destructive as he wishes, and does not care too much for responsibility as he would rather engage in a turf war or sexual activities than clean up a mess he caused.\n\nAngel exudes a flirtatious demeanor, making advances on practically any man who crosses his path. He's notably forward in his interactions with figures like Husk, Alastor, and Fergus. Notorious for his explicit, offensive, and risqué sense of humor, he specializes in crass jokes, profane language, and sexual double entendres. He frequently resorts to hurling insults at individuals, irrespective of provocation, deriving satisfaction from pissing people off in others. He is also not above saying sexist or racist jokes solely to piss people off and amuse himself; Examples of this include remarks such as slyly advising Vaggie not to \"get [her] taco in a twist\" and directing misogynistic comments towards both her and Charlie. Angel Dust's choice of aliases (Anita Hanjaab, Harry Cox, A.S Muncher) for his disguises also demonstrates his penchant for using sex-related wordplay. He crafts these names as playful innuendos, intertwining his mischievous humor with his alter ego personas.\n\nAngel embodies a candid, abrasive, and brutally honest attitude, which he executes with a distinct flair. He consistently maintains an air of flamboyance, nonchalance, and self-assuredness, carrying this demeanor wherever he goes. This demeanor allows him to stay composed even during high-pressure situations. For instance, he exhibited little concern when confronted by Bruce and his gang in the midst of a drug transaction, opting to continue taunting them despite multiple guns pointed his way. This cool-headedness extends to his engagement with Cherri Bomb during a turf conflict, where he managed to uphold a casual conversation while simultaneously battling alongside her.\n\nBeneath his flamboyant and playful exterior, Angel is a very capable and formidable gangster. He is an extremely competent marksman with a great variety of skills, which he acquired from doing jobs for the mafia as well as his time in the military. His skill set encompasses a broad spectrum, rendering him an invaluable ally. He can adopt female disguises to infiltrate different businesses. This competence is evident in his execution of numerous successful operations for Valentino, demonstrating a high degree of proficiency with minimal setbacks. Swift and agile in his approach, Angel adeptly navigates assignments, often displaying remarkable speed and precision. His ability to seamlessly adopt disguises and invent new personas on the spur of the moment empowers him to infiltrate even well-fortified locations, highlighting his resourcefulness. Initially, Angel did gain genuine enjoyment from criminal activity, including engaging in murder, especially if he personally believed that his victims deserved it.\n\nAngel's composed demeanor occasionally gives way to genuine displays of anger, heightened emotions, and surprise. Notably, when coerced into kissing and having sex with Valentino , he feigned enjoyment. However, the weight of the experience led him to experience a powerful emotional breakdown when alone at his motel. Such instances showcase his vulnerability and the complexity of his internal struggles. Angel's emotional reactions are particularly intense when the safety of his loved ones is compromised. He readily succumbs to feelings of distress or fury in these situations, a showcase of his deep-seated care for those close to him.\n\nWhile Angel openly embraces his sexual orientation and even the label of \"slut,\" he vehemently objects to being subjected to homophobic slurs. His response to Bruce and his gang highlights this sensitivity, as he takes swift action, wiping out the shark and his gang before Bruce could call him a homophobic slur, and then mockingly asking Bruce if he wanted to finish his sentence while pressing a gun against the shark's head.\n\nIn a more humorous vein, Angel's agitation and fury surface when he encounters improper preparation of Italian cuisine, generating comedic moments.\n\nAngel Dust possesses a strong sense of narcissism and is a bit of a diva, as he obsesses over his appearance, frequently refers to the denizens of Hell as ugly freaks, and loves commenting on his \"pretty face\" and body. He is very concerned and careful about his appearance, often taking hours to apply his makeup and pamper his fluff to \"perfect\" his appearance. He makes himself out to be the most important person in the room, often acting needy toward others and giving them complex requests. He is a bit of a neat freak in that he hates dirt and blood, as they are difficult to get out of his clothing and especially his fluff, and he is careful to not dirty himself by getting blood on him while engaging in crime. Angel is also very concerned and prideful about maintaining his reputation, not wanting word to get around that he would give his sexual services to random people behind Valentino's back to survive or appear that he's trying to \"go clean\" by being seen at the Happy Hotel.\n\nBeyond the provocative and hedonistic exterior that Angel Dust portrays, lies a compassionate individual whose past has left him scarred but has not extinguished his capacity for care. Despite his shattered state, he exhibits deep loyalty and a strong protective instinct toward those he holds dear. His connection with Cherri Bomb is a vivid testament to this loyalty and friendship. He adamantly refused to carry out Valentino's directive to eliminate her, even daring to turn his weapon against the moth demon as an act of retaliation. This camaraderie is further highlighted when he instinctively shielded Cherri Bomb being shot with the Egg Bois' net gun.\n\nAngel's loyalty extended to Charlie as well, evolving over time. He came to truly value Charlie's belief in his potential for transformation, fostering a deep loyalty towards her. This loyalty was most apparent when he took a life-threatening bullet to his leg while shielding Charlie from Valentino's attack during the confrontation with the Vees in Butcher Town. His self-sacrifice demonstrated the profound extent of his care for her. In the realm of Purgatory, Angel's influence was instrumental in rallying the demoralized hotel crew to mount a daring rescue mission for Charlie, who had been abducted by Lucifer and Satan.\n\nEven as a gangster and criminal who enjoys killing people who, in his mind, deserve it, Angel has a moral code, as he objects to killing innocent people, as implied by Vox calling Angel a \"pussy\", in reference to an off-screen event where Angel spared a defenseless woman while carrying out one of Valentino's crimes. Angel was also shown to be extremely distressed and uneasy whenever compelled to partake in one of Valentino's snuff films, displaying an aversion to taking lives for the purpose of gratifying mass sexual desires. Valentino had to use a revolver to coerce to Angel into committing the act during one of their film shoots. He also has some sense of honor, as he chose to save his estranged and hated brother Arackniss from The Insurgency since Arackniss had previously saved him from being killed by their father Henroin.\n\nFurthermore, he loved his pet pig, Fat Nuggets, so much so that he considered Nuggets to be one of the only things that kept him going in Hell. He even went as far as to torture and interrogate one of Valentino's men to get information on where Fat Nuggets was after the moth demon took the pig. When Fat Nuggets was murdered by Valentino, Angel Dust become very depressed and despondent, to the point of attempting suicide, although he did more or less recover from this.\n\nAngel Dust grapples with profound psychological fears rooted in the dread of isolation. These fears seem to stem from an implied past experience where he faced death alone, devoid of companionship, which has deeply scarred him. Within the confines of the hotel, he deliberately surrounds himself with other patients and staff members. This approach provides him with a buffer against the specter of solitude and the uncertainty of unforeseen adversities. By maintaining a presence of people around him, he seeks to quell the unsettling possibility of being left alone in dire circumstances. This fear of isolation sheds light on his protracted association with Valentino. A pivotal factor that tethered him to Valentino was the belief that separation from the moth pimp would inevitably result in his solitary existence. Valentino capitalized on this vulnerability, exploiting Angel's fear to manipulate and control him effectively.\n\nAngel has a notable soft spot for children and is great with them in general, which was displayed by his quickly forming a friendship with Charlie's Angels, due to them humanizing him, listening to his stories, and motivating him to become a better person. He will happily go out of his way to brutalize or kill anyone who intentionally harms children in any way. Regardless, while Angel is generally friendly towards children, he is still somewhat irresponsible around them, as he frequently spouts obscenities even when in their presence. He showed his willingness to make drastic decisions to ensure the safety of Charlie's Angels when he made a deal with Satan in exchange for their safety after the Devil had possessed them, and tenderly comforted the terrified children once the Devil released them from its possession. Angel is also rather easygoing around Manco, sympathizing with the child due to his traumatic experience while imprisoned by Satan. Angel is also surprisingly compassionate at times, as he noticed his teasing about the hotel’s lack of success was upsetting Charlie, which caused him to stop mocking her and almost apologize, although he ultimately decided to leave her alone.\n\nAppearance\n\nAngel is a humanoid, bipedal spider demon with a pencil-thin build. He stands at around 7 feet tall naturally and is around 8 feet with his heels on. He is covered in fluffy, white fur and has pink spots throughout his fluff, with the three spots under his eyes being smaller eyes. Angel Dust has a distinctive, swooping hairstyle that always maintains its shape regardless of which angle he is viewed from. It is never seen straight even when he is facing forward and merely flips to whichever direction Angel is facing whenever he turns. He wears eye shadow and eyeliner, both of his irises are pink, and his left eye has a dark sclera and no pupil, possibly as a result of being injured in a fight, or at the hands of Valentino. Angel previously possessed a single golden fang among his sharp teeth, a trait he shared with his boss, Valentino, but tore the gold tooth from his mouth after renouncing the moth demon.\n\nHe has a pink heart on the back of his head as well as on his chest, with a line going down to his crotch area. One of Angel's most noticeable features is his prominent chest, often giving a first-hand impression to others that he actually has breasts. In actuality, his chest is composed entirely of fluff, and the fluff, which Angel treats as if they were actually breasts, is a cluster of his fluff combed and pampered up over time due to the tightness of his jacket. He has pink strips down the length of his shins, and his feet are round-shaped and resemble that of an actual spider; he has only two toes with two large, pink claws protruding from the tips.\n\nThough usually depicted with six limbs, Angel Dust has a third retractable set of arms that he can summon to use at will. However, he permanently lost his middle lower left arm when Valentino shot it off in \"Take Us Back\" until it was restored by Lux much later on.\n\nAngel Dust's primary attire consists of a white suit with pink stripes throughout, a black bow tie with a pink center, a black choker, long, pink gloves on all of his hands, black short shorts, and long, black, thigh-high heel boots. When engaging in crime or deals, he often wears a white trilby with a pink band and a black feather attached to it.\n\nDuring the gang war with Sir Pentious, Angel's shadow is briefly depicted as different from him, being taller with six arms and red eyes. This seems to be a glimpse at his Full Demon Form.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nNatural Powers\n\nDemonic Transformation: When going through fits of extreme emotion, Angel Dust can voluntarily transform into a more intimidating, animalistic form, and then shift back to his normal form.\n\nImmortality: As he has already experienced death, Angel Dust lives eternally as an undead soul and is incapable of dying through conventional or mortal means.\n\nNigh-Invulnerability: As a sinner, Angel Dust is extremely tough, and can take ungodly amounts of punishment and get up seconds later as if nothing happened. In his first encounter with Cherri Bomb and the Resistance, he easily survived a van exploding in his face, and despite being pushed back by the explosion and flying violently into a car, was only mildly dazed. When fighting Sir Pentious with Cherri Bomb, Angel displayed no signs of pain or injury whatsoever when the snake wrapped him in a chain and violently hurled him onto the ground, casually responding to the attack with a sexual remark. While fighting Valentino in Baxter's laboratory, Angel withstood a severe beating from Valentino, including being violently pinned and slammed into multiple surfaces by Valentino's smoke trails. Still, he was able to keep fighting back during the assault, summoning the strength to raise his machine gun with one arm to shoot the moth as he was using his smoke trails to strangle and constrict him. Later, while attempting to fight Lucifer himself in Purgatory armed with a machine gun, Angel displayed mild discomfort when the King of Hell melted his machine gun and caused it to violently explode in his face. Only holy weaponry/magic is capable of doing any permanent or severe damage to Angel Dust.\n\nRegeneration: As a result of being a sinner, Angel's healing capabilities were at an amazingly high level, allowing him to quickly heal from being shot, stabbed, melted, crushed, etc. In addition, he possesses a greatly enhanced metabolism, immune system, and vitality allowing him to heal much faster than an average human and consume copious amounts of drugs and alcohol without feeling severe ill effects. When he tore his gold tooth out after leaving Valentino, the tooth grew back in a matter of minutes. Later, while fighting the Army of Darkness with the hotel crew to save Manco, Angel received multiple injuries and cuts, even being stabbed in the side with a spike, and, despite expressing pain and having to be carried by Husk and Fergus, all of the wounds he received had been healed in a matter of minutes. However, due to his demonic physiology, Angel Dust is unable to regenerate from wounds that were caused by holy weaponry/power, as seen when he nearly died of blood loss from being shot in the thigh by Valentino's revolver, which uses holy bullets as ammo. When Lucifer tortured Angel by cutting him across the head using an angelic knife, the wound did not regenerate for several days. Later, he permanently lost his middle lower left arm when it was shot off by Valentino.\n\nUnique Powers\n\nEnhanced Senses: Angel Dust possesses three small eyes under each of his two main eyes, which, when opened, grants him an enhanced vision. In addition to his enhanced vision, he also possesses heightened hearing, as he can hear things such as a storm coming from miles away. His heightened senses allow him to detect approaching enemies; when he was searching for Fergus with Husk, Cherri Bomb, and Charlie's Angels in Purgatory, Angel was able to pick up on the presence of Manco's possessed variants by hearing the flapping of their wings in the distance mere moments before they attacked him and his allies. He also claims that he can hear Charlie and Vaggie when they are having sex at night.\n\nEnhanced Speed: As a result of his spider-like physiology, Angel can crawl at an impressive speed whenever he runs on his arms and legs.\n\nEnhanced Strength: Although not nearly as impressive as Fergus, Cherri Bomb, or Vaggie's strength, Angel Dust has displayed impressive feats of physical strength for his lean frame. During his battle with Sir Pentious and the Egg Bois with Cherri Bomb, he used a baseball bat to effortlessly smash several of the Egg Bois. Later, when Valentino was physically assaulting Angel backstage for stopping in the middle of a performance, Angel instinctively retaliated by punching Valentino with enough force to shatter the moth's sunglasses and send him staggering backward. During his physical confrontations with Valentino at the Hazbin Hotel and later in Purgatory, Angel's physical strikes were strong enough to damage Valentino's face and make the Overlord bleed from his mouth, even whilst the moth was in his Full Demon Form. Angel's punches were also strong enough to visibly harm Fergus, as shown by the multiple bruises, cuts, and black eye Fergus had sustained after their fight.\n\nHammerspace: Angel can store numerous items at once on his chest floor, including objects so big that it would be physically impossible to fit such as numerous fan letters, his machine guns, and a baseball bat.\n\nVenomous Fangs: As a spider demon, Angel Dust's fangs are coated in a venom that he can use to infect others if bitten. His venom would be lethal to a human and is capable of making sinners and demons feel ill.\n\nWall-Crawling: As a result of his spider-demon physiology, Angel can adhere to ceilings and presumably other surfaces and scale them when willing so, even if he is inverted above the ground. During his fight with Fergus, Angel was able to land on his hands and feet, sticking to the ceiling of the Galaxy Light after Fergus had launched him upwards, and used his momentum to propel himself off the ceiling and tackle Fergus to the ground.\n\nWeapon Summoning: Angel has the uncanny ability to instantly spawn guns which he can use for combat, mainly pistols, revolvers, and machine guns. However, this ability is somewhat limited as he can only spawn six guns at a time - as much as his arms can carry.\n\nAbilities\n\nAthleticism: Most likely as a result of his spider-demon physiology, Angel Dust can easily perform impressive acrobatic feats. He has top-notch leaping and climbing agility, using free-running and parkour to outmaneuver several enemies at once, as well as leap great distances with great precision, as shown when he jumped several meters in the air and into Sir Pentious' helicopter. Later, he (off-screen) casually leaped on top of the Hazbin Hotel to be alone from the other inhabitants. In Purgatory, he quickly leaped several feet in the air and into the arms of Charlie's Angels, who were flying overhead. Angel can also bend his body in unnatural ways without injuring his joints, allowing him to squeeze into tight spaces with minimal discomfort.\n\nBilingualism: Angel is fluent in both Italian and English.\n\nCharm: Angel Dust can use his good looks and seductive, flirtatious charm to persuade, lure in, or distract people.\n\nExpert Interrogator: Angel Dust is, rather surprisingly, a master of interrogating others, capable of scaring or outright torturing his victims into giving up information when the situation arises. During his years of serving Valentino, he would often be forced to interrogate Valentino's enemies to gain information for the moth demon's benefit. When Fat Nuggets was taken by Valentino, Angel demonstrated his interrogation skills by torturing one of Valentino's men to find out where Fat Nuggets was being kept, stabbing the goon in the knee with a knife and twisting the blade, repeatedly shooting him in the abdomen, and brutally carving a heart into the goon's head.\n\nExpert Marksmanship: Angel Dust possesses great skill in handling a wide variety of weapons, with a preference for high-powered artillery. He is a sharpshooter but can get sloppy if one gets under his skin. While attacking Bruce and his gang after they turned on him during a drug deal, Angel used his four arms to fire four different guns in all directions, wiping out every member of the gun while precisely leaving Bruce injured but alive, including \"killing\" multiple members he was not looking at. During the hotel crew's skirmish with the Army of Darkness, while rescuing Manco, Angel precisely shot several winged creatures in the air and did not miss a shot, and shot one creature behind him over his shoulder without even looking at them.\n\nHand-to-Hand Combat: Angel Dust has displayed moderate skill in hand-to-hand combat, likely due to his years of carrying out Valentino's various crimes in Hell. He was capable of wrestling a sinner with a much larger build than him, and physically overpowered one of Velvette's fanboys by shoving them into the path of Alastor's demonic tentacles. Although he was overpowered during the fight, he managed to strike Valentino multiple times even when the latter was in his Full Demon Form and harmed him by spitting in his eyes, showing shades of being a dirty fighter as well. His fighting skills were perhaps best demonstrated during his brawl with Fergus in Purgatory, where he was able to stand toe-to-toe with Fergus (a fallen warrior angel) and gave him a considerable fight, and even caused Fergus to bleed with a couple of punches, although he was eventually overpowered by Fergus' superior strength.\n\nMaster of Disguise: Angel possesses remarkable prowess in acting and disguising himself. He is capable of donning a vast array of outfits and blending into the territories of other sinners undetected. Using his makeup and outfits, he is capable of deceiving others by making himself look like a completely different person and can come up with new personalities and identities on a whim when the need arises. While illegally sneaking into the Lust Ring with Fergus, Angel disguised himself as a woman, which deceived everyone they came into contact with, although the King of Lust, Asmodeus, was able to easily see through Angel's disguise after witnessing his pole dancing and recognizing it from his films.\n\nMusical Talent: Angel Dust can play the trumpet and is a skilled pianist, as he played the piano version of \"O sole mio\". He is also a very gifted singer and dancer.\n\nNatural Weaponry: Angel Dust can use his venomous teeth and claws as offensive weapons.\n\nRetractile Limbs: Angel Dust has a hidden third set of arms that can retract in and out of his body, giving him extra ambidexterity.\n\nWeapon Proficiency: Angel Dust can handle various types of weapons with ease, such as bats, knives, chains, and explosives, although his preferred type of weaponry seems to be firearms, with his weapon of choice being a Thompson machine gun, as well as carrying several sidearms on him. Due to his extra limbs, he is capable of wielding multiple weapons at once, as shown by his dual-welding machine pistols with his upper arms while using his lower arms to fire two rifles akimbo-style.\n\nWeapons\n\nBaseball bat: Angel was shown briefly using a baseball bat to smash several Egg Bois during his and Cherri Bomb's turf war against Sir Pentious.\n\nPP-19 Vityaz: Angel rarely uses an AK-SMG, most often dual-wielding it with other machine guns.\n\nRevolvers: Angel carries two revolvers on him which he typically only uses in tandem with other machine guns.\n\nThompson submachine gun: Angel's primary and favorite weapon when engaging in crime or combat is a pair of Thompson submachine guns, which he almost always carries on his person. He doesn't appear to use a singular Thompson and carries at least three on him at all times.\n\nRelationships\n\nFamily\n\nHenroin\n\nHenroin was Angel Dust's disowned father and former mafia boss. Henroin emerged as a central figure in Angel Dust's tumultuous past, served as his estranged father and a former mafia kingpin. Their relationship was marked by intense conflict arose from Henroin's vehement disapproval of Angel's lifestyle and sexual orientation. The extent of this antagonism was profound, illustrated by Henroin's near-fatal attempt on Angel's life when he discovered his son's sexuality. This incident, among others, led to Angel's disownment by his father.\n\nArackniss was eager to shed light on Henroin's perspective, revealed his deep-seated embarrassment over having Angel as his son. Henroin's harsh judgment extended further, labeled Angel as a \"sissy fairy failure.\" Indications suggest that Henroin subjected Angel to severe psychological trauma during his formative years. This included exposing him to graphic mafia executions, an experience that likely left lasting scars. Additionally, Henroin's rejection and conditional acceptance hinged on Angel's adherence to the mafia lifestyle, perpetuated a cycle of emotional neglect and manipulation.\n\nAnnie\n\nAngel Dust was very close to his mother, Annie, and looks back on her fondly, reminiscing about her cooking and her skill with a piano while talking with Fergus. Although, when remembering his sister, Molly, Angel mentioned that Molly was the only member of his family who supported him, implying that, despite him remembering her fondly, Annie did not support his lifestyle (although this could have been because Angel was not out of the closet while living).\n\nArackniss\n\nArackniss was Angel's (formerly) disowned older brother. Although their relationship in the present was severed, they occasionally encountered each other while commuting in the streets of Pentagram City, which often resulted in the two getting into screaming matches with each other. Based on their dialogue, Arackniss greatly disliked Angel due to his sexual orientation and lifestyle, and Angel enjoyed teasing Arackniss about his name and his rather small stature.\n\nIn \"My Brotha Arackniss\", Angel Dust chose to save Arackniss after he was kidnapped by Sir Pentious, however, this was at the coercion of Charlie's Angels, and was tempted to leave him at the mercy of Pentious. This did nothing to heal their brotherhood, however, as the two brothers insulted each other all along the way. Furthermore, Arackniss insisted that he did not need Angel's help. When Arackniss asked Angel why he chose to save him, Angel admitted that he felt as if he \"owed\" Arackniss for saving him from being erased by Henroin - which visibly affected Arackniss -, and concluded that now that his debt was paid, he would never have to put up with Arackniss ever again. Angel reacted in a flippant way to Arackniss threatening to murder him before he and Cherri dumped Arackniss off the side of the road.\n\nLater, Arackniss and Crimson's goons ambush Angel and his friends with the intention of bringing him and Moxxie to Henroin and Crimson. When a masked Arackniss was held at gun-point by Angel, the latter hesitated to kill Arackniss when his brother revealed his identity. This mercy led to Angel being incapacitated as Arackniss taunted him for not taking the shot.\n\nWhile imprisoned at Henroin's mansion and confronted by his older brother, Angel Dust attempted to bridge the emotional gap with Arackniss, angrily telling his brother about the years of mistreatment and humiliation he endured from their father, Henroin. Despite glimpses of vulnerability, Arackniss, driven by anger and a desire for revenge and to be in the right, resisted fully acknowledging the truth.\n\nUpon being reunited with Molly, Arackniss reluctantly decides to assist her with saving Angel, though he refuses to assist them beyond that. Arackniss faces fatal consequences for his loyalty to his father, and is killed during a confrontation between the mobster and the Insurgency, and his death heavily impacted Angel. Despite their differences, Angel Dust and Arackniss shared a moments of camaraderie and concern for each other, and their last conversation revolved them bonding over their familial love for Molly.\n\nAfter the demise of Arackniss, Angel unleashed his fury upon Henroin, vehemently accusing his father of being responsible for both Arackniss' mortal and afterlife fate. Amidst the brutal beating, Angel lamented that their family could have been perfect if Henroin had prioritized his own kin over the demands of the mafia.\n\nMolly\n\nMolly is Angel Dust's twin sister. Their bond stands in stark contrast to Angel's strained relationships with the rest of their family, excluding their mother. The connection between Angel and Molly is characterized by genuine positivity and support.\n\nIn a heartwarming recollection shared with Fergus, Angel reflects on their shared history and highlights Molly as the sole family member who offered him unwavering encouragement and embraced his sexuality. This acceptance marked a significant departure from the norm in their family dynamics. Furthermore, Molly played an instrumental role in nurturing Angel's drag aspirations, allowing him to privately explore this facet of himself by donning her clothing.\n\nAngel's emotions towards Molly are poignant and profound. He expresses a sense of yearning for her presence, recounting dreams of her during his time in Hell. The stark contrast between his experiences with the abusive members of his family and his fond memories of Molly, who resides in Heaven, amplifies his sense of loss and isolation. The absence of Molly in his life is a source of genuine sorrow and contributes to his complex emotional landscape.\n\nAllies\n\nCherri Bomb\n\nAngel and Cherri Bomb were best friends and former partners in crime. Cherri and Angel first met each other when Angel was nearly killed by a rival gang while attempting to carry out a job for Valentino. Just before Angel could be killed by his assailants, Cherri and several Resistance fighters indirectly saved him by attacking and killing most of the rival gang members as well as the men who accompanied Angel. Angel was then confronted by the Resistance fighters, who were initially confrontational towards him, believing that Angel was loyal to Valentino. However, Cherri grew to admire Angel for his spunky attitude and, after it became clear that he was not truly loyal to Valentino, subsequently befriended him, grew a strong friendship with him over time.\n\nFollowing this incident, Cherri began to mentor Angel about effectively handling heavy weaponry and explosives. Using what Cherri had taught him, Angel became even more effective in combat, and therefore, he learned almost everything about his destructive behavior from her. Angel frequently assisted Cherri and the Resistance by defending their territory in Hell from external threats, and Angel always happily accepted a chance to finally get some \"action\", as well as join them in their rave parties and gathering. During these turf wars, Angel and Cherri frequently protected each other in the case that they were injured or put in danger; When an Egg Boi was about to shoot the both of them with a gun, Angel instinctively shoved Cherri out of the way and got caught instead. This caused their friendship to strengthen over time.\n\nAs a result of their close friendship, Cherri was one of the few people that Angel was willing to confine in and expose his more emotional side too. Cherri was always willing to comfort Angel whenever he endured difficult times, such as the sexual and financial abuse he regularly suffered at the hands of Valentino. As a result of Valentino's treatment of Angel, Cherri's hatred of the moth demon intensified, and she retaliated against him for hurting Angel by blowing up numerous billboards and businesses bearing the moth's visage, and frequently sabotaged his dealings with his associates. When he found out what Cherri was doing, Angel attempted to warn the anarchist to leave Valentino's operations alone out of concern for what the Overlord would do to her as revenge, but she arrogantly insisted that she could handle whatever he threw at her.\n\nAt some point, Valentino, thanks to Vox's input, discovered that Angel had been seen frequently with Cherri, who he knew as the leader of the Resistance and the sinner who had been sabotaging many of his dealings and operations. Taking advantage of the situation, the moth demon arranged an ambush disguised as a drug deal to capture Cherri and bring her to a warehouse. After luring the anarchist into a trap where she was successfully captured, Valentino brought Angel and Cherri to one of his warehouses, where he reacted with horror and confusion to Cherri's capture. Valentino, after lambasting Angel for forging a friendship with her, handed him a gun that used holy ammo and tasked him with killing her to prove his loyalty, as well as vengeance for her frequent interference in his businesses. However, Angel did not hesitate to try to shoot Valentino instead, proving that any loyalty he may have had to his pimp was not nearly as strong as his friendship with Cherri. The attempt to shoot Valentino failed, and Angel was punished by being assaulted by Valentino's goons.\n\nOut of concern for Cherri's safety, Angel refused to hang out with her or any of the Resistance members for months, not risking being spotted with her and putting himself or especially her in danger. However, weeks after Angel checked into the Hazbin Hotel, Cherri paid him a visit, much to his pleasant surprise. Having not seen his best friend in months, Angel gave Cherri a hug, before reminding her that they could not be seen together. When Cherri took notice of Angel's bruises and marks he had received at the hands of Valentino, Angel attempted to brush it off by implying that he deserved it for disobeying his pimp. Angered, Cherri bluntly told Angel to shut up and insisted that he did not deserve anything that Valentino put him through.\n\nDespite Cherri being a very close friend, Angel was initially hesitant to tell her that he genuinely wanted to better himself in order to escape Hell and, more importantly, Valentino. He feared that Cherri would ridicule him over this, or potentially even sever ties with him, and thus had decided to put off telling her about it. To his surprise, once he decided to confess to her his new-found opinion of redemption, Cherri was understanding of his decision and said she would support him all the way. Despite the possibility of losing Angel if he were to successfully reform himself and ascend to Heaven, Cherri stated that it would be worth it as long as he was safe and far away from Valentino, which brought a smile to Angel's face. Later, when Cherri was captured by Valentino, Angel, and Fergus went to rescue her from the warehouse that the Overlord's goons were keeping her in, only for Cherri to break herself out just as the two had arrived. She was clearly deeply moved that Angel and Fergus were willing to risk their safety to rescue her and gave Angel a tight hug in response.\n\nAngel and Cherri's dynamic took a convoluted twist amid the Hazbin Hotel's struggles with redemption, exacerbated by the staff's adamant refusal to allow Cherri near Angel. This left Angel disheartened for Cherri and Cherri feeling betrayed by Angel. Jumping to conclusions, Cherri speculated that the hotel exploited Angel's fame to boost its own reputation, especially evident in their commercials prominently featuring him. Her resentment and self-interest surfaced further as she noticed Angel's apparent detachment. She began taunting and accusing him of growing \"soft\" due to his pursuit of rehabilitation, revealing a bitter aspect of her emotions.\n\nTheir relationship reached a breaking point when members of the Resistance fell victim to the Insurgency's actions. In their ensuing confrontation, former allies exchanged accusations and grievances. Cherri expressed her sense of betrayal and frustration, chiding Angel for what seemed like a disregard for her trust. In retaliation, Angel hurled insults, branding Cherri a \"selfish bitch\" and implicating her in his perceived misery within Hell. Amidst the charged atmosphere, both Cherri and Angel unleashed their pent-up emotions. Amidst the emotional turmoil, Cherri divulged her deeper feelings to Angel. She confessed her ultimate desire for his happiness and safety, despite her fear of being left behind. Vulnerable, she admitted her profound dread of loneliness if Angel were to ascend to Heaven.\n\nDespite their tumultuous history, Angel later infiltrated the Insurgency's base to rescue Cherri when she was captured. Cherri, taken aback, confessed her assumption that Angel had abandoned her. Feigning offense, Angel reassured Cherri of their enduring friendship, regardless of redemption, prompting tears from her. Playfully, he offered her a hug, which she initially resisted before relenting, solidifying their bond. Together, they combated the Insurgency's forces, reminiscent of their past turf wars, swapping weapons in a display of camaraderie.\n\nOn their journey to confront Izzi, Cherri expressed willingness to die if it meant taking Izzi down. Sympathetic, Angel understood Izzi's responsibility for Cherri's demise and his own misfortunes.\n\nAs the Insurgency's base collapsed, Angel urged Cherri to flee, but she resolutely chose to confront her father. In her final moments, she gazed at the sky, encouraging Angel to \"kick Heaven's ass\" before striking a defiant pose, consumed by the explosion alongside her father. Angel was left shattered by Cherri's loss, experiencing a profound grief akin to that of losing Fat Nuggets.\n\nCharlie Magne\n\nIn their first interaction, Charlie had invited Angel Dust into her limousine with Vaggie after seeing him streetwalking. Angel initially mistook the two's intentions and insisted that he'd have to charge extra to have sex with women, although Charlie clarified to Angel that they were only interested in talking. Angel agreed to get in limbo when the princess said she would pay him for his time. Once inside, Charlie and Vaggie proposed to Angel a chance to join the Happy Hotel, where he would be given free meals, housing, and protection from Hell's dangers in exchange for agreeing to enter the program. Angel used this proposition as a way to mock and fun of the idea, not taking Charlie's operation seriously, especially after he learned that no one had agreed to join prior. However, after Vaggie suggested to Charlie that Angel was no good to them and they should find someone more worthy, an agitated Angel agreed to take part, using the excuse of being behind on rent as the primary motivation. Just as Angel was about to leave to continue his evening's work since he was short on money, Charlie gave him a large stack of cash as an investment in himself. Angel expressed confusion, and he declared the gesture to be \"a trick\", to which the princess quickly reassured him that she believed that there was a lot more to Angel than he or other sinners thought, and she simply wished to nourish that and encourage him to be better. Angel, not used to such kindness, took the money with an awkward response and a promise to keep in touch. Although Angel believed the idea of redemption to be \"silly\", and was initially only interested in getting a free room, it was obvious from Angel's demeanor that Charlie's gesture and words made the spider demon consider genuinely trying redemption for the first time.\n\nAfter checking into the Happy Hotel, Charlie began to act as one of Angel Dust's main authority figures, attempting to keep him on the path to betterment. Angel often jokingly (and, occasionally, affectionately) calls Charlie his \"mom\" because of the princess' tendency to tell him to do things he typically does not like to do, like cleaning up his messes and encouraging him to stay off drugs. During his first weeks at the Happy Hotel, Angel would often go behind the princess' back and break his sobriety by doing drugs and going on turf wars with Cherri Bomb, all for the sake of maintaining his credibility as an unruly porn star, as well as to make money for his pimp, Valentino. However, despite his habits of mocking Charlie and poking fun at her failures, the princess' compassion towards Angel slowly led to him developing a genuine friendship with her, due to her being one of the few people in Hell who saw him as more than just a sex object. Charlie is also very quick to comfort Angel whenever he is saddened, or going through severe drug withdrawals. While talking about Charlie with Fergus, Angel said that Charlie's happy attitude sometimes makes him happy, while admitting that her optimism occasionally feels like a \"personal attack\" and can irritate him at times, as he believes that Hell is not a happy place to live in.\n\nEven before fully coming around to her, Angel displayed shades of a softer side towards Charlie; after the latter's failed interview on the 666 News, Angel noticed how his constant mockery was upsetting Charlie greatly, and almost apologized, but ultimately decided to let her be. During the hotel crew's confrontation with The Vees in Butcher Town, Angel even risked his life to save her from being killed by Valentino, shoving her out of the way when the moth demon attempted to shoot her with a holy bullet, which resulted in Angel Dust getting injured. When Charlie was comforting him as he was recovering, Angel said that taking the bullet was his way of paying Charlie back as thanks for her refusing to hand him over to Valentino.\n\nAngel has mentioned that one of the things that endear Charlie to him is that he sees a lot of his sister, Molly, within Charlie.\n\nVaggie\n\nVaggie and Angel initially shared a very passive-aggressive \"frenemy\" type of relationship. While the start of their relationship was rocky, to say the least, by and large, the two are good friends and most trusted allies capable of working together to obtain mutual goals.\n\nVaggie and Angel first encountered each other when the former enlisted Angel in the Happy Hotel program with Charlie. When Vaggie inquired Angel's name after introducing herself to him, the spider called her a \"bitch\", without any sort of provocation, while introducing himself, and burst into laughter when Vaggie told him her name and began to mockingly refer to her as \"vagina\". As Angel continued to mock the hotel and laugh at its ideals, Vaggie had little to no hope in Angel and suggested to Charlie that he was no good to them and that they should find another candidate, which annoyed Angel as she did not consider him worthy. Angel insisted that he was the best candidate for the hotel's first patient, to which Vaggie sternly told him to prove his worth, to which Angel responded by accepting their proposal to join the hotel.\n\nIn their interactions, Angel often playfully taunts Vaggie by continually making fun of her name and playing practical jokes on her, like gifting Charlie with a dog collar that had Vaggie's name on it or putting dildos in Vaggie's drawer. Vaggie finds Angel's relapses, jokes, and casual dismissal of his destructive behavior to be infuriating, especially since his relapses have upset Charlie greatly and damaged the Happy Hotel's already undesirable reputation. Regardless, there have been traces of positivity in their relationship now and then; despite being frequently vexed by his behavior, Vaggie respects Angel enough to defend him from external threats, such as when she threatened to kill Alastor with an angelic spear if he \"hurt anyone\" at the hotel, which included Angel. Vaggie also expresses sympathy towards Angel over the horrific abuse he has endured at the hands of Valentino, as she has also experienced and endured sexual abuse in the past. While scolding Angel for his destructive behavior and leaving the hotel when he was supposed to be grounded, Vaggie raised her hand at Angel in anger, which caused him to suffer a PTSD-induced panic attack as he briefly saw her as Valentino was about to strike him. Once Vaggie realized what she did, she immediately attempted to apologize to Angel, although he brushed off her apology and insisted he only reacted in such a way to protect his face.\n\nIn \"The Encore\", Vaggie, along with the rest of the hotel crew, refused to give Angel back to Valentino, even if it meant war with the Vees. When Valentino and his associates attacked the Hazbin Hotel in retaliation, Angel and Vaggie managed to settle their differences and teamed up to take down Velvette. Entering Velvette's funhouse together, the two discovered Velvette's \"doll\" collection with Angel, and they both were horrified by the display, and Angel assisted Vaggie in freeing Velvette's victims from their state. This greatly enraged Velvette herself, who entered her Full Demon Form in a fit of rage, and injured Vaggie by clawing her across the side. As Vaggie was injured, Angel put himself in between her and Velvette, defending Vaggie by attacking Velvette with his machine gun. When Velvette then mused over ways she would torture Vaggie, Angel attempted to attack Velvette again in an attempt to defend Vaggie, and even gave her a high-five after they successfully took down Velvette, showing how far their relationship came since their first encounter.\n\nBy the time of Chapter 5, Angel and Vaggie are essentially full-on fire-forged friends. The two clearly care about each other, and while Angel still enjoys teasing Vaggie, he is much less mean-spirited about it than previously and the two are even capable of joking around with each other. During her confrontation with Roo, Vaggie admitted that she trusted angel Dust, a far cry from what their relationship had begun as.\n\nAs Angel readied for his journey to Heaven, he exchanged a sincere farewell, if playful, and embraced Vaggie, demonstrating the depth of their friendship. Regrettably, tragedy struck when Satan seized control of Angel's body, seeking retribution against both Angel and Charlie for their resistance. In a cruel twist, Vaggie met her end at the hands of Angel's manipulated vessel.\n\nSoon after finally breaking free from Satan's grip and escaping Roo by fleeing with the hotel crew to Earth, Angel, without recollection of the possession, asked the crew where Vaggie was upon noticing that she was not with them, tragically oblivious to her death by his indirect hand.\n\nHusk\n\nUpon Husk being summoned by Alastor to serve as the bartender and desk clerk at the Happy Hotel, Angel Dust swiftly developed an attraction towards Husk. He indulged in flirtatious banter and playful advances, much to Husk's evident irritation. Persistent in his actions, Angel would blow kisses and wink at Husk, who, in turn, found this behavior rather irksome and would respond with dismissive expletives.\n\nYet, the dynamic between Husk and Angel changed course when Husk stepped in to prevent Angel from getting entangled in a dangerous situation after Husk rejected his advances. Husk's actions saved Angel from potential harm. As they made their way back to the hotel, a genuine conversation about abuse and manipulation ensued, paving the way for a sincere and deepening friendship between them. In a playful manner, Angel teased Husk about genuinely caring for him, causing Husk to blush and become defensive. He maintained that his actions were driven solely by the desire to protect the hotel, downplaying any personal attachment to Angel, even though Angel could slyly discern the genuine concern and care Husk had for him.\n\nFollowing this turning point, Angel and Husk solidified their status as an iconic duo, their friendship characterized by humorous banter and mutual emotional support. They became a fixture at the Angst Bar, often seen confiding in and conversing with one another. Husk tends to take on the role of a mindful protector while Angel is the chaotic instigator, going out of his way multiple times to ensure Angel's safety and keep him from blowing up. Husk was also generous enough to babysit Fat Nuggets for Angel whenever he was out of the hotel, putting up with the pig since Angel clearly cared about it. Their camaraderie became a central and endearing aspect of life at the Happy Hotel, showcasing the power and possibility of an unexpected, genuine friendship between damned sinners.\n\nHusk and Angel have bonded over their troubled pasts, sharing feelings of neglect and being undervalued by their respective families and circumstances, with Angel being raised from birth to be a mobster while Husk grew up in a casino, thus all both of them knew were those kinds of lives. They found solace and understanding in each other's experiences. Husk expressed his sense of independence gained from a challenging upbringing in the big city, while Angel shared how he felt ignored by his father and comparatively gained very little from the mafia lifestyle. Angel lifted Husk's spirits, emphasizing Husk of his worth, appreciating him for who he is and for him being there for the hotel's crew members no matter how much they drive him to drink. Despite Husk's initial doubts about his significance, Angel's encouragement helped him realize his value and importance within their newfound circle of caring friends.\n\nAlastor\n\nDespite how long Angel has been in Hell and the Radio Demon's far-reaching reputation, Angel admitted to Vaggie that he had never heard of Alastor before the Radio Demon's arrival at the Hotel, citing his lack of interest in 'politics'. Upon first being approached by Alastor and asked what talents he possessed, Angel offered up his 'services' as his solitary skill, specifically offering Alastor fellatio, which managed to break the Radio Demon's composure, before he laughed it off and swiftly and firmly turned down Angel's offer.\n\nAngel seems to be the patient within the hotel who Alastor is most vexed by (besides Baxter); Angel has a habit of using his flirtatious and perverted humor to playfully bug the Radio Demon, loving how much it makes Alastor uncomfortable. Angel also enjoys pranking Alastor in many ways, such as putting pornographic magazines and a TV in the Radio Demon's office. Alastor was also constantly annoyed by how Angel allowed Fat Nuggets to rummage through the hotel's kitchen and causes messes, threatening to eat Fat Nuggets if Angel did not supervise him properly. Angel Dust displayed a protective and affectionate attitude towards Fat Nuggets, and Alastor seemed to enjoy provoking Angel Dust and engaging in playful banter with him, even going as far as proposing a wager involving Fat Nuggets, questioning and testing the beloved pig's loyalty.\n\nDespite him genuinely hating Angel Dust, Alastor often restrains himself from harming the spider (mostly because Charlie would not let him) and has protected Angel from the hotel's threats. Angel was shown to be grateful when Alastor defended him from Valentino and his associates when they attempted to take Angel back to Porn Studios, flirtatiously referring to Alastor as his \"dark knight in crimson armor\".\n\nOn the more negative side, Angel is somewhat dismayed at the fact that Alastor does not believe that Angel can be redeemed, as he became slightly agitated when the Radio Demon laughed when he confessed that he genuinely wanted to better himself.\n\nDespite his clear disdain for Angel, Alastor would later go on to free Angel from Valentino's control by winning a bet against the moth Overlord and Vox. However, Alastor only did this to prove to Sera that he was capable of doing \"good\" as well as some way to validate Charlie's claims that even the worst demons were capable of doing good deeds.\n\nNiffty\n\nAlthough their interactions are sporadic, Angel has a friendly relationship with Niffty. At the same time, he is slightly afraid to make a mess around her, and at one point claimed to Fergus that Niffty nearly stabbed him in the hand for spilling his drink on a carpet. Angel appreciates that Niffty constantly keeps the hotel clean, as he does not want dirt or cobwebs to get onto his fluff. Niffty thinks that Angel is a woman, most likely because of his feminine features, although Angel does not seem to mind this at all and has never corrected her on his gender.\n\nRazzle and Dazzle\n\nAngel appreciates Razzle and Dazzle as the two goat demons cater to his requests, protect him from external threats, and make food for him when he requests it. He speaks very highly of their cooking, claiming the dishes they prepare are far better than the sub-par food found in Hell's Diners. After Valentino took Fat Nuggets, Razzle and Dazzle noticed Angel became quite distressed and offered to let him pet them as a form of comfort. Angel affectionately pet them on their heads, which managed to make him laugh and express his approval of them.\n\nCharlie's Angels\n\nAngel first personally interacted with Amelia, Christopher, Giulia, Megara, Arthur, Simon, and James when Baxter was making repairs to his spaceship when the hotel crew was trapped in Purgatory. After Megara commented on his fur, Angel let the children touch his fluff, which they practically became addicted to. Afterward, Angel began sharing stories about his life with the children as they huddled and cuddled against him around a campfire, enamored by his stories. When Angel began talking about his desire to reform himself, and his uncertainty on whether or not it was possible, the children encouraged him to see the good inside himself. Later, when Satan sent Manco's alternate counterparts to attack the hotel crew, Angel protected the children, saving Simon and Megara from being potentially devoured.\n\nEight years after the hotel crew split up, Satan, having noticed Angel's soft spot for the children, confronted Angel after possessing the children, using them as mouthpieces to confront him and threatening to kill them if he did not listen to what it said. Angel reacted furiously to this, threatening to murder Satan if it did anything to the angels. Although Angel knew no good would come from making a deal with the Devil, he reluctantly submitted to Satan's deal the ensure the safety of the children. After Satan released them, Angel tenderly comforted the terrified child as they were crying from what had happened. He continued showing his care for them as he comforted them hours later when they were still clearly shaken from their experience. Later, when the hotel crew was on a mission to retrieve the Celumite to power Baxter's spaceship, the children saved Angel from being lost in space, to which he gratefully thanked them.\n\nCrymini\n\nAngel is protective of Crymini and treats her almost like a little sister, even referring to her as such. Angel is one of the few hotel crew members that Crymini gets along with, as they enjoy shopping and going out into Pentagram City with each other, as well as pulling pranks on and bugging each other.\n\nMoxxie\n\nShortly after I.M.P joined the hotel crew until the situation with Lucifer blew over, Angel and Moxxie managed to form a friendship with each other, despite Moxxie nearly killing Angel numerous times. Sharing drinks with each other, they grew a strong dynamic with each of them balancing out each other's problems. They were able to bond over their mutual daddy issues and how they both came from crime families. When Moxxie lamented how difficult the mob life was, Angel, knowing that feeling all too well, said that although the mob life was difficult, it was also rewarding, in a sense.\n\nPets\n\nFat Nuggets\n\nFat Nuggets was Angel's pet pig whom he loved very much. Fat Nuggets was a gift from Valentino to Angel that the moth claimed was a reward for all of Angel's work. Angel initially had no interest or desire for a pig as a pet, due to their reputation as unkempt creatures, and initially acted indifferent towards the pig. Shortly after Fat Nuggets was given to Angel, the spider returned home after being forced into a humiliating gangbang by Valentino, causing him to wreck his motel room before crying uncontrollably on the ground. Fat Nuggets slowly approached Angel and cuddled against him, to which Angel responded by hugging the pig tightly for support. It was from that moment on that Angel grew to love Fat Nuggets deeply, with the pig becoming a sort of support animal for Angel, being a source of comfort for Angel through difficult times.\n\nAngel enjoyed dressing up Fat Nuggets in little clothes, matching outfits, and collars with bows on them, often posting images of the pig on his Voxtagram account, and generally smothering him with affection. He was also extremely forgiving of Fat Nuggets, never seeming to get angry at the pig for his tendency to cause messes in Angel's room and the hotel in general, and would often come up with excuses when the hotel's patients and staff expressed their annoyance over Fat Nuggets' messy habits. He also would become defensive whenever Alastor mused about eating Nuggets for his constant annoyance. He would go to great lengths to protect Nuggets from danger, chasing down Sir Pentious when he kidnapped the pig and viciously beating the snake down for endangering Nuggets. When talking to Fergus, Angel even admitted that Fat Nuggets was one of his only reasons to keep living in Hell.\n\nWhen the Vees kidnapped Fat Nuggets in retaliation for Angel leaving Valentino, Angel became incredibly distressed and nearly inconsolable, going as far as to torture one of Valentino's goons for information on Fat Nuggets' location, and becoming far more serious and less prone to joking around the hotel crew. Upon finally finding Fat Nuggets, Angel emotionally embraced the distraught pig and assured him that he was safe. However, Valentino had been waiting for Angel, having used Fat Nuggets as bait, and once Angel had fallen into his trap, the moth restrained Angel using smoke and forced the spider to watch as he killed the pig with a knife. Angel became incredibly distraught afterward, screaming death threats at Valentino and futilely attempting to attack the moth. In the aftermath of Valentino's temporary defeat, Angel broke down in bitter tears over his beloved pet's death, falling to his knees while clutching Fat Nugget's collar, while Charlie, Vaggie, Niffty, Cherri Bomb, and even Husk and Fergus piled in and hugged him for comfort.\n\nFat Nuggets' brutal death left an everlasting impact on Angel, resulting in him suffering from nightmares of Nuggets' death, and even attempting suicide. However, he was able to recover with help from the hotel crew while still remembering Fat Nuggets as the pig who gave him life.\n\nEnemies\n\nValentino\n\nValentino is Angel Dust's former pimp and a major threat to his safety. At some point, after he was reborn in Hell, Angel, struggling for money, was caught attempting to steal the wheels from Valentino's limo, and was brought before the moth by his gang. Although Valentino briefly mused over simply killing him, he ultimately saw potential in Angel's looks and habits, and, after giving him drugs and having sex with him as a way to coax the spider in, Angel accepted the moth's offer to become a porn actor and dancer at Porn Studios. Over time, Angel became one of Valentino's most famous and profitable workers, earning himself millions of dollars, protection from Hell's law enforcement and gangs due to his status as one of Valentino's highest-earning workers, and all the drugs he could have desired. Valentino also frequently bought Angel Dust makeup, and at one point gifted him with a pet in the form of Fat Nuggets for his work, enticing Angel into working with him for even longer.\n\nDespite the hedonistic pleasure that Angel seemed to enjoy while serving Valentino, the moth demon truly only cared for Angel as long as he was able to profit off of the spider's body, viewing Angel as a slave and sex object who only existed to feed his sexual lust and earn him money. Angel would constantly be forced to kiss and have sex with Valentino, with or without his consent, and although Angel had earned millions of dollars from his work with Valentino, he was forced to forfeit nearly all of his earnings to his pimp, leaving him impoverished and forced to do degrading sex work, such as giving his landlord fellatio, to survive, thus robbing Angel of any joy he could have obtained from serving Valentino. In addition, Angel endured endless physical, emotional, and sexual abuse for his infractions, such as failing to pay Valentino the money that he owed him, or for being late to film shoots. Angel was also never allowed to speak to Valentino out of turn, in addition to being forced into a strict diet. He was also put under constant surveillance from the moth's underlings whenever he was allowed some free time, most likely to prevent him from potentially running away and escaping his pimp's influence. This abuse resulted in Angel developing a deep-seated hatred for Valentino over the years.\n\nAs a result of Valentino's mistreatment, Angel Dust, despite being infamously snarky and sarcastic, was shown to be very uncomfortable and physically shaken by Valentino's presence while serving him, and did not dare say or do anything that would invoke Valentino's wrath, and complied to nearly all of his pimp's wishes without much resistance or back-talk. Well aware of Angel's talents as a criminal, Valentino would occasionally send Angel to do immoral and dangerous jobs for him in exchange for money, such as interrogating and torturing his business rivals, and assassinating rival gangs, uncaring that Angel could have been potentially killed, captured, or injured during any of these jobs. Angel's frequent relapses during his rehabilitation at the Happy Hotel were also mostly caused by Valentino, as he was attempting to get money for his pimp, explaining his motives for breaking his two weeks of good behavior before getting wrapped up in the turf war with Sir Pentious.\n\nAngel tried to ignore Valentino's mistreatment of him for as long as he could, as he deluded himself into thinking that the moth truly loved him, but following a particularly bad experience with Valentino and support from Charlie, Angel finally rebelled against Valentino and permanently joined the Hazbin Hotel. Not only was he bold enough to publicly humiliate and insult Valentino in front of Vox and Velvette by calling him out on his mistreatment of them, but he also struggled against him and spat in his face during their confrontation towards the end of Chapter 1. During another confrontation, as revenge for disobeying him, Valentino finally went through with his threat and brutally killed Fat Nuggets while forcing Angel to watch helplessly as he did it, simply to emotionally torment and scar the spider demon and deprive him of someone he cares about. While restraining the enraged spider, Valentino, using Angel Dust's own growth as a person against him, gave Angel the offer of going back to work for him as a prostitute at Porn Studios, stating that even if Angel Dust had refused, it would have led to the death of all his friends and broken him completely.\n\nVox\n\nAngel Dust greatly despises Vox, as the TV Demon, like many sinners, only views Angel as a sex object and a pretty face he could use to pleasure himself. During Angel's decades of serving Valentino, Vox would occasionally \"borrow\" Angel from Valentino so that the spider could give the TV Demon his services, and Angel would occasionally pole dance at Vox's nightclub. It was very clear from his behavior around the TV Demon that Angel Dust loathed Vox intensely and only gave the TV Demon his services for the money alone, and would frequently make Vox pay extra as a result. Vox would also frequently harass Angel with sexual intent with no regard for Angel's feelings, which Angel was disgusted by, and would take any chance to insult Vox whenever this occurred.\n\nWhile Vox seemed disgusted by Valentino sexually abusing Angel, the spider noted Vox's hypocrisy by pointing out that the TV Demon was still willing to recapture Angel and bring him back to Valentino to be endlessly mistreated, and that he never attempted to protect Angel from Valentino's mistreatment, and thus rebuffs any of Vox's supposed \"sympathy\". During the Vees' assault on the Hazbin Hotel, Vox showed his true colors towards Angel when he brutally tortured the spider in front of Alastor, all while regarding Angel as a \"worthless cum dumpster\" who he would enjoy mistreating once Angel was brought back to Valentino.\n\nSatan\n\nDespite not interacting with it much Satan's first interaction with Angel shortly after taking possession of Charlie's body when the latter concerningly asked if she was alright, taunting Angel if anyone will remember him when he was slowly suffocating, and Angel mocking the Devil by calling it \"The Universe's greatest parasite\" when it had Vaggie's team restrained by The Vees.\n\nAngel Dust has a deep hatred for the Devil for torturing and nearly killing him and all of his friends. They finally have a full-on conversation after the eight-year-time skip of Adina's death and the Happy Hotel being torn apart, when it took possession of the seven angel children after they escaped the Queen Spider's den. Mocking Angel for his inability to harm it in exchange for harming the children, Angel threatened if it harmed the children that he will split it up so badly that not even the Purgatory will re-arrange what it looked like. Satan was completely unfazed by Angel's threats and proposed him a deal that will benefit both of them by \"helping\" him find a way to kill Valentino, initially, Angel scoffed and laughed it off as a joke, but realized it was serious and it even tried to bring up Fat Nuggets to emotionally hurt Angel. Angel forcefully accepted Satan's offer in exchange for letting the seven angel children go, but the Devil warned if Angel tries to escape, it will find him and destroy everything he cherishes and is dear to him, to which Angel angrily agreed, completely unfazed by Satan's threats.\n\nIn Chapter 4, Satan telepathically communicated with Angel to go and destroy one of Valentino's clubs and successfully convinced him to kill one of Valentino's defenseless and terrified employees, which brought some satisfaction to Angel as he forgot how fun was killing people. After destroying the club, Angel Dust smugly imagined Valentino's reaction and admitted that he loves living in the hotel and being redeemed, but \"sometimes it's good to let loose.\" Still, Angel Dust admitted his hatred towards Satan, to which the fallen Light Beyond the Stars replied that Angel might hate it now and claimed he will soon thank it and it is their first towards \"revenge\".\n\nIt is implied that Satan is plotting to corrupt Angel by goading him into taking revenge on those who have harmed him and submitting to his sinful habits, which could potentially cause Angel to lose his chance at redemption and result in him being trapped in Hell permanently.\n\nSir Pentious\n\nFor the most part, Angel does not take Sir Pentious seriously as a threat. He has frequently aided Cherri Bomb and the Resistance in their skirmishes with Sir Pentious, and constantly mocks the snake with various sex jokes that Pentious constantly fails to understand, such as when the snake actually thought Angel was his son, after misinterpreting Angel's intent behind calling him 'Daddy'.\n\nThe only time Angel had ever taken Sir Pentious seriously was when Pentious kidnapped Fat Nuggets in \"The Game of Doubt\", as he was shown angrily yelling and outright threatening to murder Sir Pentious if he didn't return Fat Nuggets back to him. That said, Angel returned to making crude jokes against Sir Pentious after he rescued his beloved pet pig.\n\nAfter Pentious joined the Hazbin Hotel, Angel and Pentious quickly dropped their enemy grudge against each other and began a shaky friendship. When Pentious found himself desperately craving a romantic partner, Angel willingly offered to teach him how to sweet-talk others. However, Angel still occasionally indulged in playful teasing at Pentious' expense. Pentious' horrible attempts at \"rizzing\" provided Angel with much ample comedic fodder, and Angel seized the opportunity to jest about his lackluster attempts at flirting. When Pentious' attempts at flirting resulted in him being pepper sprayed, Angel calmly dragged Pentious to the hotel while reassuring him. Additionally, the revelation of Pentious' crush on Cherri Bomb invited uproarious laughter from Angel.\n\nVerosika Mayday\n\nTBA\n\nAsmodeus\n\nAngel first met Asmodeus when the King of Lust applauded him for his performance at Ozzie's. Angel was initially intimidated by Asmodeus' sudden appearance but eased up when the King of Lust offered him a job as a dancer at his nightclub, assuming the King of Lust did not recognize him since he was disguised as a woman at the time. Angel accepted the job as he had always wanted to live in the Lust Ring, and was promptly chauffeured to Asmodeus' private villa. There, he was treated by the King of Lust and showered with gifts and junk food. Angel was pleasantly surprised by the King of Lust's hospitality as he was seemingly nothing like Angel's former pimp, Valentino. After enjoying ice cream and a movie together, Asmodeus and Angel had passionate sex as the King of Lust seduced him into it.\n\nOver the following weeks, Asmodeus made Angel a star in the Lust Ring under his fake name \"Anita Hanjaab\", allowing the spider to stay at his villa where they ate food and had sex regularly, developing a strong fondness for Asmodeus for his treatment of him. All of this takes a turn, however, when Asmodeus revealed that he knew Angel's identity the entire time by recognizing his moves when he was dancing. He revealed that he was a big fan of Angel's works and offered to make him a permanent citizen of Lust, so long as he agreed to work under him indefinitely. Although Angel appeared to consider Asmodeus' offer, though he may have been intimated as the King of Lust backed him into a wall, he quickly changed his mind when Asmodeus threatened to kill Fergus when the latter interrupted them, sadly stating that the King of Lust was no better than Valentino, having finally realized that the King of Lust was only using him for sex, before attempting to free Fergus from Asmodeus' magical grasp. Asmodeus allowed Angel and Fergus to leave, and although he ordered his guards to kill them for treason, he specifically ordered them to only kill Angel once he was out of his sight, as he did not want to see personally see Angel get hurt.\n\nOthers\n\nTravis\n\nAngel does not think much of Travis, regarding him an as \"a rando from the street\", and considered offering his service to Travis to get a \"quick cash grab\". After driving Angel to a nearby drug vending machine, Travis complimented Angel for his service, only to call Angel a slut when he told Travis to keep their deal discreet, to which Angel feigned being offended, and insulted Travis for his uncreative insult. Angel then gave Travis a quick smooch on the lips and told him to give his greetings to Travis' wife, causing Travis to speed off while grumbling and crash his car.\n\nEver since their meeting, Travis seems to have become one of Angel’s regular patrons, as he was present during Angel's show at one of Valentino's nightclubs. Angel still doesn't really care much for Travis, as he casually kicked a drooling Travis in the face without looking.\n\nGallery\n\nQuotes\n\nChapter 1\n\nChapter 2\n\nChapter 3\n\nChapter 4\n\nChapter 5\n\nQuotes Pertaining to Angel Dust\n\nTrivia\n\nAngel Dust's original name, Anthony, might come from the word \"Antonia\", which means \"priceless\" and/or \"beautiful\".\n\nHis adopted name, Angel Dust, is in the slang term for PCP, the same drug that killed him when he was a human.\n\nHis theme song would either be \"Slutty Spider Polka Pop\" by Gooseworx, \"Toxic\" by Britney Spears, \"Glamorous\" by Fergie, or \"Valentino\" by Years & Years.\n\nDespite being gay, Angel Dust is willing to have sex with women, although he will do it with extreme reluctance and charges extra for it.\n\nHe was 37 years old by the time of his death.\n\nHis birthday is on April 1st.\n\nAngel Dust has acquired a form of PTSD, extreme anxiety, and suicidal thoughts from both his time in the war and his decades of being exploited and horrifically abused by Valentino, as shown by his sudden flashback of Valentino raping him while he was looking at himself in a mirror.
