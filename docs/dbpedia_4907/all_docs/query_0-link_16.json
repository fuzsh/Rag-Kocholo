He was signed by Paul Trollope and Lenny Lawrence without having previously played a single Football League match, but he quickly asserted himself as a first-team regular playing alongside Steve Elliott in the centre of defence. He suffered a setback however when he suffered a broken metatarsel in October 2007, which sidelined him for approximately five months. After returning from that injury he returned to playing regular first team football, helped by his ability to fill in at both fullback positions when required.\n\nWhen Paul Buckle took over the manager's position in the summer of 2011 he brought in a large number of his own players, resulting in Byron playing less often during the 2011–12 season. He was eventually loaned out to Rovers' League Two rivals Hereford United on a month-long deal in mid-February 2012, later extended until the end of the season. With his contract up that summer it was perhaps not a great surprise when he was released, at which point he was Rovers' longest serving player.\n\nHe is a former Welsh Under-21 international, winning a total of five caps at that level in 2004 and 2005.\n\nCareer[]\n\nByron began his career as a youth player with Cardiff City, but failed to make an impact with the Bluebirds, making just two League Cup appearances. He joined Forest Green Rovers on a month's loan in February 2006, playing four league games for the Gloucestershire club, and signed for the Pirates on a free transfer in July of the same year. He proved to be an astute signing, establishing himself as a first team regular early on in his time with The Pirates, and also performed some coaching duties during Stuart Campbell's spell as caretaker manager in 2011.\n\nFollowing his release from Rovers in 2012 he joined Hereford United on non-contract terms, but was released after playing just two games. After a short time without a club he signed for his home town team, Newport County in November 2012. His first season with Newport was hugely successful, with the team reaching the Conference play-off final at Wembley against Wrexham, where he played alongside former Gas men David Pipe and Andy Sandell. County won the game 2–0, winning promotion to the Football League.\n\nCareer stats[]\n\nSeason Club League Apps Goals 2004–05 Cardiff City 0 0 2005–06 Cardiff City 0 0 2005–06 →Forest Green Rovers (loan) 4 0 2006–07 Bristol Rovers 23 0 2007–08 Bristol Rovers 20 1 2008–09 Bristol Rovers 30 2 2009–10 Bristol Rovers 37 0 2010–11 Bristol Rovers 37 3 2011–12 Bristol Rovers 16 1 2011–12 →Hereford United (loan) 15 1 2012–13 Hereford United 2 0 2012–13 Newport County 21 3\n\nRecord against Rovers[]\n\nByron has never played in a competitive match against Bristol Rovers."
