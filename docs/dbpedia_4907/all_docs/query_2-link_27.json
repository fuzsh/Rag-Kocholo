        "text": "As part of the final act in my MSc studies, I had to produce a short form sports documentary to showcase all I had learned within my studies at Cardiff Metropolitan University. I‚Äôm pleased to say that piece is here, it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúDragons In Exile‚Äù and I‚Äôm already thrilled hearing about how those within the club, and fans of it, are enjoying watching. This project has been a labour of love, with a personal connection to this historic outfit, I always wanted to do this justice. I wouldn‚Äôt be at this point to begin with if it wasn‚Äôt for Joe Towns first admitting me onto his course. I owe a lot of what my ability now is to him and the amazing team at Cardiff Met. A special thanks to Jamie Hicks, Ado, Rhys, Steffan Garrero, Caoimhe Hennigan, and all the staff at Cardiff Met for supporting me in my studies and this doc. Thanks to London Welsh Rugby Club for letting me produce this piece. For all my participants who spoke on camera so passionately, Cai Griffiths. And to Haydn Parry for helping to organise filming locations at the club and kickstarting my journey after my undergrad. I‚Äôd love to hear what you think about this piece! And who knows where the next chapter of London Welsh will take the club, and indeed personally what my next chapter is. Diolch yn fawr üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åø https://lnkd.in/eb8kWqeX\n\nUnforgettable our history is important in every area. Baseball like swimming and Aquatics in the African American Community has a gold star history and unsung heroes. Access is what is required. But opportunity should not be based on qualifying variables that all groups can‚Äôt attain due to ‚ÄúFear of loss‚Äù. POOLS WERE BUILT TO SAVE LIVES THROUGH THE LENS OF PUBLIC HEALTH, and were free for all. FIELDS ARE FILLED WITH DREAMS. Swing away! I am honored to encourage my family to look beyond the barriers and go for dreams. https://lnkd.in/eNt5P5xn"
