        "text": "Country music had a record-setting year in 2023, thanks to hit songs released by Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs, Oliver Anthony Music, Zach Bryan, Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll and other big artists.\n\nBut underpinning every chart-topping, impactful hit were the songwriters and writer-artists who weave together lyric, melody, rhythm and rhyme into a unique composition that pulls at the heartstrings, inspires a rollicking good time and/or lays bare relatable truths. Last year brought history-making success for many songwriters and writer-artists, who further added to their songwriting legacies.\n\nTracy Chapman became the first Black songwriter to earn the CMA’s song of the year honor, after Combs recorded Chapman’s 1988 smash “Fast Car.” Wallen’s “Last Night,” written by Ashley Gorley, John Byron, Jacob Kasher Hindlin (JKash), and Ryan Vojtesak (a.k.a. Charlie Handsome), spent 25 weeks atop the Hot Country Songs chart. Oliver Anthony Music (real name: Chris Lunsford) found unprecedented success when “Rich Men North of Richmond” debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100 — with Anthony having previously notched zero entries on any Billboard chart.\n\nMeanwhile, Bryan spent nearly 20 weeks at the pinnacle of the Hot Country Songs chart this year, thanks to his songs “Something in the Orange” and the Kacey Musgraves duet “I Remember Everything.” And thanks to the release of Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) in July 2023, Taylor Swift saw several of her re-recorded versions of songs from her 2010 album Speak Now show up on this year’s Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nHere, we look at Billboard‘s 2023 Year-End Hot Country Songwriters Chart, highlighting the songwriters who dominated the Hot Country Songs chart in 2023.\n\nBillboard’s weekly Country Songwriters chart is based on total points accrued by a songwriter for each attributed song that appears on the Hot Country Songs chart. As with Billboard’s yearly recaps, multiple writers split points for each song equally (and the dividing of points will lead to occasional ties on rankings). Billboard’s year-end music recaps represent aggregated metrics for each artist, title, label and music contributor on the weekly charts from Nov. 19, 2022, through Oct. 21, 2023. Any activity registered before or after a title’s chart run isn’t considered in these rankings. That methodology detail, and the November-October time period, account for some of the difference between these lists and the calendar-year recaps that are independently compiled by Luminate."
