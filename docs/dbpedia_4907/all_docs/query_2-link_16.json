        "text": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW) — An appellate court issued a stay on a previous ruling that ordered Byron Brown's name appear on the November ballot for the race for Mayor of Buffalo, according to court documents.\n\nA lawsuit was filed in State Supreme Court on August 30 on behalf of the Brown campaign, arguing the legislature’s change in primary day and day of the deadline to file a petition to appear on the November ballot was unconstitutional and did not give voters enough time to decide.\n\nIn that case the court ruled Brown's name appear on the ballot in November as an independent candidate.\n\nThe decision was appealed and the Supreme Court of the Appellate Division, Fourth Judicial Department heard the appeal and issued a stay Wednesday, pending further arguments.\n\nIndia Walton, the Democratic nominee for mayor, issued the following statement Wednesday afternoon:\n\nThis is clearly a wise decision. If everyday Buffalonians are late on rent, parking fees, or school assignments, they face consequences. There is no reason the rules should not apply to my GOP-backed opponent as well.\n\n- India Walton\n\nThe Brown campaign issued this statement:\n\n\"We remain confident that the rulings of two judges will be upheld.\"\n\nThere was also a lawsuit filed in Federal Court on behalf of three Buffalo residents who support Byron Brown for Mayor. The lawsuit “Alleges that New York’s early deadline, as applied to the would-be candidate violates their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.”\n\nIn that case the court also ruled Brown's name appear on the ballot in November as an independent candidate."
