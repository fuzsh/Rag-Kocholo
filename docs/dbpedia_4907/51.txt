Byron Anthony Morgan, 64, of Gary, Indiana passed away February 7, 2022. He was born on August 1, 1957 in Gary, Indiana to the parents of Auston and Dempsie Morgan.

Survivors of Mr. Morgan include his sisters Joycelin (Ronald) Bostic, Rachelle (Michael) Ceaser; brothers Austin (Sheila) Morgan, Gregory (Paula) Morgan and many family and friends.

He is preceded in death by his mother and father Dempsie and Austin Morgan.

Byron was employed as a steel worker and barber. He loved God and sports. Byron was loved by his family and will be deeply missed. The bible says in Romans 6:23 “for the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Byron now has eternal life and is truly free.

The family would like to express a special thanks to those family members and friends that continually supported Byron throughout his life's journey. Your love and commitment are greatly appreciated.

A Celebration of Byron's life will be held at a later date.

Arrangements are being handled by Bell Mortuary & Crematory, Royster-Askin Sandrock Chapel, 2310 W. Washington Street, Indianapolis, IN 46222.
