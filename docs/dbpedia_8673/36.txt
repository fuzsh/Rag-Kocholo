Aoife Mulholland, 28, has signed up to play Roxie Hart in the smash hit musical production of Chicago.

Mulholland, from Galway, Ireland, was booted off the BBC1 TV show, designed to find a leading lady for The Sound of Music, in the semi-finals.

Connie Fisher, 23, eventually won the role of Maria in Andrew Lloyd Webber's production, which opened to rave reviews.

Last month Chicago celebrated its ninth anniversary in London, where it has been seen by over 4 million people in 3,743 performances.

Mulholland takes the role at the Cambridge Theatre from December 18.
