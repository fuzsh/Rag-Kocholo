Aoife Mulholland (pictured below) has made it to the final 10 out of 10,000 hopefuls to land the leading role of Maria in Andrew Lloyd Webber's production of the famous musical.

The reality talent programme 'How To Solve A Problem Like Maria?' will be aired for the third week this Saturday night.

But Aoife, from Galway's Salthill, will not be able to rely on votes from friends and family at home because viewers from the Republic of Ireland will not be able to participate in voting on the programme because they are not licence fee payers to the BBC - the UK's public service broadcaster.

Aoife is the daughter of Fine Gael councillor and bookmaker John Mulholland and his wife Margaret.

She was a familiar face on the musical scene in Galway before moving to London in June 2005 to undertake a masters in acting and musical theatre at the renowned Central School of Speech and Drama.

The talented actor and singer yesterday said she was shocked to learn that people at home wouldn't be able to vote for her.

And her father John admitted: "It will certainly hinder her chances, it's very disappointing news. But the rules are the rules."

The show is presented by Cork-born Graham Norton.
