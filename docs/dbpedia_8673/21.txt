Aoife Mulholland has become one of 10 finalists who will compete live on television for the lead role in a West End production of 'The Sound of Music'.

The 28-year-old, from Salthill, Co Galway, has already seen off stiff competition to make it to the last stages of the BBC show 'How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria'.

The producers have been looking to cast a Maria von Trapp for the musical which will open on the West End later this year. The role was made famous by Julie Andrews in the 1965 film version.

Along with the other nine contestants, Aoife will be singing live and facing a public vote every Saturday on the show, hosted by Graham Norton.

The finalists were chosen through a series of open auditions, which were judged by a panel of experts, including Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Aoife is currently studying for an MA in Acting and Musical Theatre at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London.

"I come from a very musical family," she said. "Every year we would meet on Christmas night and all the kids were encouraged to perform. I think it was then that I realised I loved singing."

Aoife was educated by nuns at school and could draw on her school experiences to play Maria, a young woman studying to become a nun who joins a family as a governess.

"Maria is just the best character to play," she said.

Aoife is a multi-talented performer. A soprano, she is also proficient in jazz and tap dancing and plays the piano and the violin.

The winner of the show will be awarded a contract to play the leading role in the multi-million euro production for six months on the West End stage.

Andrew Lloyd Webber, who is staging the West End version, had originally talked about Scarlett Johansson taking up the role. But he later decided a fresh new face was best for the role.
