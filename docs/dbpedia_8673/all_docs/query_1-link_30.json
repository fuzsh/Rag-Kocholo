In one tale, she was the fiercest woman warrior in the world and enemy of her twin sister, Scathach.\n\nAoife is very popular in Ireland, and is catching on across the UK as well. Aoife is sometimes Anglicized as Eva, but the names are from independent origins. Eva shares roots with Eabha and Aoibhe, both also currently popular in Ireland.\n\n# 171 on Nameberry\n\nAoife Rank in Nameberry Top 1000\n\nAoife Popularity\n\n171Nameberry2024\n\n786Unique2022\n\n190England2021\n\n108Scotland2023\n\n31Ireland2023\n\nFamous People Named Aoife\n\nAoife MacMurrough aka Eva of LeinsterIrish lady of Leinster and countess of Pembroke\n\nAoife MulhollandIrish actress\n\nAoife NÃ­ FhearraighIrish singer\n\nAoife O'DonovanAmerican musician\n\nAoife WalshMiss Ireland 2013\n\nAoife McArdleIrish film director\n\nAoife MannionEnglish footballer\n\nAoife HoeyIrish bobsledder\n\nAoife KavanaghIrish TV journalist\n\nAoife ClancyIrish singer of group Cherish The Ladies\n\nAoife ScottIrish singer,songwriter; daughter of singer Frances Black\n\nAoife Hinds (b. 1991)daughter of actor Ciaran Hinds\n\nAoife Belle Foden (b. 2012)daughter of rugby union player Ben Foden and singer Una Healy of The Saturdays\n\nAoife Laffandaughter of singer Rhiannon Giddens of Carolina Chocolate Drops and Michael Laffan"
