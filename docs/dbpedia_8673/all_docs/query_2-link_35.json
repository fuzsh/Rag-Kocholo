        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nLONDON, Sept. 12 — Andrew Lloyd Webber may not have written a hit musical of late, but his marketing skills seem as sharp as ever. While promoters of West End musicals must buy advertising space in newspapers or on billboards, he is enjoying 11 hours of free publicity on prime-time television for his new production of “The Sound of Music.”\n\nAnd the elixir for this investor’s dream?\n\nWell, once again, a reality show is drawing the crowds, this time one called “How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?” Maria is of course Maria von Trapp, the musical’s lead role, which Julie Andrews made famous on screen. And the “problem” is whom to cast in the onstage part, which calls for serious acting, dancing and singing, as well as a heavy dose of syrupy charm.\n\nIt was Lord Lloyd Webber’s idea, then, to hold a live talent competition in which television viewers would signal their favorite Maria hopeful, with those earning the fewest votes gradually being eliminated. In theory the eventual winner would have proved herself popular enough to carry the show when it opens at the London Palladium early in November.\n\nThe BBC was delighted. Albeit a public broadcaster, it had no hesitation about promoting a commercial production in exchange for a potentially popular new reality show. In ratings terms it was right: “Maria” has been drawing some six million viewers per installment, even challenging “The X Factor,” a more lowbrow talent show on the main competing channel.\n\nNow the crunch is nigh. On Saturday, the three finalists from the 2,000 or so women who auditioned — Connie Fisher, 23; Siobhan Dillon, 21; and Helena Blackman, 23 — will have their last chance to woo the public. Then, after a 90-minute countdown, one will set off on a stage career blessed by Lord Lloyd Webber.\n\nNot a bad start for a young woman with minimal professional experience: her name in lights, performing before some 2,500 people six nights a week, appearing alongside a much-loved British opera and crossover soprano, Lesley Garrett, in the role of Mother Superior — and all thanks to a reality show.\n\n“The winner is given a six-month contract,” Ms. Fisher explained between rehearsals for last Saturday’s semifinals, adding with a wink of a smile, “But of course they have a get-out clause.”\n\nAs it happens, Lord Lloyd Webber and his co-producer, David Ian, proposed the “Maria” show only after they failed to secure Scarlett Johansson for the role, and they have hired a stand-in, Emma Williams, 23, to sing two performances a week — and no doubt more if television’s winning Maria falters onstage.\n\nBut for the moment, the focus is on Saturday’s eighth and final chapter of “How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?”\n\nStarting in March of this year, auditions quickly whittled down the group of hopefuls to about 200, and then, after Lord Lloyd Webber had scanned scores of tapes, the field was narrowed further, to the 54 young women who were sent to a so-called Maria School. There, for the first time, they were given voice, dancing and acting lessons to prepare them for their first audition onstage for Lord Lloyd Webber.\n\nThe television show, which began July 29, devoted its first two episodes to film clips of these early stages, including those cringing moments when aspirants with neither voice nor looks had their 15 seconds of fame (or pain). Finally, amid buckets of tears of joy/dismay, 54 were brought down to 10, and the Marias were ready for public judgment.\n\nBy last Saturday, five contenders were left, with, as ever, Lord Lloyd Webber presiding on a throne accompanied by three critics — Mr. Ian; John Barrowman, a musical leading man familiar to West End audiences; and Zoë Tyler, a voice coach — and the show’s host, Graham Norton, a veteran of reality shows.\n\nViewing this as a ritualistic humbling (something of a given for many reality shows), the British theater director Trevor Nunn took a snipe last month at “Maria.”\n\n“I think that what these reality programs more or less rely on is the viewing public being witness to distress,” he told The Times of London, “or being witness to coping with failure or inability to cope with failure.”\n\nNaturally, Lord Lloyd Webber, who perchance in earlier times hired Mr. Nunn to direct musicals like “Cats” and “The Woman in White,” does not agree. “None of the girls feels at all exploited,” he said over lunch near his Belgravia home. “The bottom line is that these girls will have eight weeks of prime-time television and will be seen by more people than during a whole career onstage.”\n\nThe young women seem to consider blushing on nationwide television a small price to pay for the chance not only to play Maria, but also to gain the experience and exposure of the auditions.\n\n“I think everything the judges say is constructive criticism,” said Ms. Dillon, who by her own admission felt insecure when the series began. “It makes things better, even if I feel self-conscious.”\n\nThen come the drumroll moments. After each contender has performed, Mr. Norton gives the results of the first round of voting and names the two women with the fewest votes, who must engage in a “sing-off.” And it is then — twice each evening — that Lord Lloyd Webber can show his clout by “saving” one of two from elimination.\n\nLast Saturday drama was added because Aoife Mulholland, 28, and Abi Finley, 23, now known to television viewers as close friends, had to face each other in a sing-off. Lord Lloyd Webber picked Ms. Mulholland. But after a second sing-off barely an hour later, it was Ms. Mulholland’s turn to leave as Ms. Blackman was “saved.”\n\nAs before, the show’s two parts then ended with first Ms. Finley, then Ms. Mulholland, being waved goodbye and serenaded by the survivors with “So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu” from “The Sound of Music.” Parody? Presumably.\n\nThe twist is that this Saturday, only the public will pick the final winner, with Lord Lloyd Webber obliged to accept its choice. “The public has shown good judgment so far,” he said optimistically, “and I think any of these girls will be up to the role.”\n\nHe has still more reason for confidence because the BBC and some other producers are eager for him to take the Maria formula to the United States. “I heard the BBC was planning to do ‘Grease’ without me over there, but I reminded them that it was my idea,” he said. “Now after this success, they want to get me involved.”\n\nBut more than anything, he said, he welcomes the opportunity to draw the public’s attention to the whole genre of musical theater.\n\n“My raison d’être is to bring it to the people,” he said, recalling his first hit, “Jesus Christ Superstar,” more than three decades ago, “and that’s what this show does, week after week.”"
