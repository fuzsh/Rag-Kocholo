        "text": "Rhapsody In Blue Merrick Chamber Orchestra Richard Gilley Piano (No. 37 No. 38) Agitato mf Molto marcato Analysis This section starts out at (No. 37) marked agitato, with the same melodic motif that was introduced the first time that the piano played at the beginning of the Rhapsody. This melody was also developed in the poco agitato section earlier. It consists of a 16th rest followed by three 16th notes and two eights. This familiar theme is used a different places throughout the Rhapsody, but in this section, it is developed with great speed and intensity, as it is actually a recap of the poco agitato section. At (No. 38) the music progresses with greater intensity and keeps building, and leads us to the molto marcato section which is six measures long. Molto means much or very, and Marcato means to perform with emphasis. Here, the orchestra plays a chromatic scale in contrary motion. Half of the orchestra ascends, while the other half of the orchestra descends chromatically. As the orchestra plays the chromatic scale with each note accented, as the scale continues it dramatically slows down to a final B-flat chord followed by a fermata before the last section of the Rhapsody.\n\nBest quotes from ICO Advice. ðŸŽ¶ - Don't focus on the small stuff. - When your body feels great, then your playing sounds better. - By doing small steps every day, little by little and being patient, you can achieve a lot in a small amount of time. - The more I fought the anxiety, the worse it would get.

The articulation marking says sempre staccato, which means short and detached throughout. There is also a making that says (Start slowly and gradually increase in speed) with a mf mezzo forte dynamic marking which means medium loud. Here we have a series of sixteenth notes, some which are chords and some that are single notes that are played with the left hand which have accent markings. Analysis: Musical markings: The section is marked \"Agitato e misterioso,\" indicating a mood of excitement and mystery. The articulation marking \"sempre staccato\" instructs the performer to play the notes short and detached throughout. Additionally, the instruction to \"Start slowly and gradually increase in speed\" with a dynamic marking of mf (mezzo forte, or medium loud) suggests a gradual buildup of intensity and speed. Character: The combination of agitated and mysterious elements creates a sense of tension and intrigue in the music. The quick tempo and detached articulation contribute to the sense of urgency and excitement, while the mysterious quality adds depth and complexity to the mood. Rhythmic pattern: The section features a series of sixteenth notes, some of which are played as chords and others as single notes. The left hand plays these notes with accent markings, adding emphasis and rhythmic drive to the passage. The presence of chords and single notes creates a varied texture and adds interest to the rhythmic pattern. Dynamic and tempo changes: The instruction to start slowly and gradually increase in speed, along with the mezzo forte dynamic marking, suggests a dynamic and expressive performance. The gradual acceleration of tempo enhances the sense of excitement and tension, while the medium loud dynamic allows for dynamic contrast within the section. Overall, this section of \"Rhapsody in Blue\" showcases Gershwin's ability to create a sense of urgency and mystery through rhythmic complexity, dynamic contrast, and expressive performance markings. The combination of agitated rhythms, detached articulation, and gradual tempo acceleration adds depth and drama to the music, contributing to the overall narrative and emotional impact of the piece."
