        "text": "Galway’s history is full of surprises and you might be really impressed by how many talented people were born and grew here.\n\nOf course, there are many famous people you already know spent all or part of their lives in Galway, however, there are a few you might not know are originally from here.\n\nFrom football players to actors, from this century to decades ago, you might get surprised in reading how many famous and talented faces have a connection with this county.\n\nHere are just a few names of people you might not know are, in fact, Galwegians.\n\n1. John Muldoon\n\nNot everybody knows that legend of Connacht Rugby John Muldoon is actually from Galway.\n\nThe rugby coach and player was born in Portumna, where he started his brilliant career at the young age of 14.\n\nMuldoon holds the record for most appearances for Connacht as well the record for most caps in the United Rugby Championship (Pro 14).\n\n2. Tyson Fury's father and grandfather\n\nTyson Luke Fury is famous as a British professional boxer but what you probably do not know is that part of his family is actually from Galway.\n\nThat's right - Fury's father and grandfather were both born in Tuam.\n\nHowever, it was not easy for the two-time world heavyweight champion to get dual-citizenship as his father’s birth was not recorded civilly but only through baptism.\n\nTyson Fury once commented: \"Becoming the heavyweight champion of the world is not as hard a fight as proving my Irishness\"\n\n3. Nicola Coughlan\n\nYou probably know her as ‘Clare’ from the comedy series Derry Girls but this award-winning actress is actually 100% Galwegian.\n\nNicola Coughlan grew up in the town of Oranmore where she cultivated her dream of becoming an actress, before heading off to England to study acting.\n\n4. Patrick Gibson\n\nDo you like quizzes? Patrick Gibson surely does as you probably know him for winning quizzes like ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?’, ‘Mastermind’ and ‘Brain of Britain’.\n\nIn total, he won 25 international medals - which is the second highest total ever - and has been ranked the second strongest player in the World.\n\nDespite playing internationally for the UK team, he originally is from Ireland as he was born in the town of the Tribes.\n\n5. David Forde\n\nAnother sport legend is footballer David Forde, who you may not know is a proud Galwegian.\n\nDavid Forde started his career at Galway United and soon began grabbing headlines in the English game.\n\nHe played as a goalkeeper for the Republic of Ireland between 2011 and 2016 and also featured at the 2012 European Championships.\n\n6. The Hon. Ms. Justice Máire Whelan\n\nThe Irish state’s first female Attorney General was born in Galway. Justice Máire Whelan is a native of Kinvara and studied law in NUIG to then complete her studies in London.\n\nAt the age of just 49, Justice Whelan was appointed as the state’s first female Attorney General in 2011. Her 2017 nomination as Judge of the Court of Appeal was controversial - opponents claimed the spot was kept vacant for Justice Whelan, something that highlights the esteem that her nominator, the Office of the President, held her.\n\n7. Patrick Lynch\n\nBorn in Galway in 1715, Patrick Lynch’s family was one of the 14 tribes of Galway.\n\nHe emigrated in South America when married an Argentinian woman and decades later one of his descendants became famous worldwide.\n\nIn fact, Patrick Lynch is the great-great-great-great-grandfather of revolutionary Che Guevara!\n\n8. Paul Hession\n\nDid you know that the fastest Irishman in history was born in Galway?\n\nAthlete Paul Hession set four Irish national records at 100 metres and 200 metres.\n\nAlso, he made the entire nation proud at the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games.\n\n9. Nora Barnacle, wife of James Joyce\n\nWe all know Dubliner James Joyce and you also probably had to write a few chapters of the Ulysses in school, but what you may not know is that his muse and wife Nora Barnacle was actually Galwegian.\n\nHer father was a Connemara baker while her mother was a worker and dressmaker.\n\nNora Barnacle met James Joyce in Dublin, where she moved in 1903, and the rest is history.\n\n10. Richard Donovan\n\nAnother Galwegian runner is Richard Donovan who ran marathons on all continents and even in extreme conditions.\n\nIn 2002, he finished first in the inaugural South Pole Marathon and, only a few months later, he then competed in the first North Pole marathon."
