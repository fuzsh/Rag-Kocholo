Sheena was so pleasant and knowledge. The food was great, and the history added another level. So glad we took the tour.\n\nVickie K\n\nVerified\n\nA Food Tour To Definitely Take! This was the highlight of our trip to Galway! So many different foods and drinks to try that highlight the changing food offerings in Ireland. The owner is extremely knowledgeable and works hard to provide lots of education and introduces you to great places that one would probably not find or try on their own.\n\nKathy M\n\nVerified\n\nWonderful! Wonderful all the way around. Good food, good drinks, good history, good stories, good company. What else could one ask for? Highly recommend.\n\neluper\n\nVerified\n\nGreat for a First Day in Galway! We really enjoyed our tour with Sheena last week. Get ready for a lot of walking, some great stories, a plunge into the twists and turns of the Latin Quarter and beyond, and loads and loads of great foods and drinks. The food scene in Galway is changing rapidly and this tour gives a great introduction to some amazing dishes and beverages. Sheena is a great partner in this adventure as she knows all of the secret spots! Plus, it helped us get our bearings in a new city and new country!\n\nKathleen K\n\nVerified\n\nExpert and fun Galway food tour The tour was a highlight of our trip. Our guide Clare was energetic, informative and fun and we enjoyed so much of the food and drink provided.The choices and quality of food available in Ireland is so much more motives over the last 30 years and it was made obvious on this tour. Thanks!\n\nMary Ann G\n\nVerified\n\nGastronomic Adventures in Gorgeous Galaway üáÆüá™üíö Such a nice variety of foods and places were included in our trip. Also it was good to learn about local farmers and resources involved in the tour. Everything was clearly explained, our tour guide gave us a historical perspective, too. And the food and drinks were great!\n\nJulie N\n\nVerified\n\nDon‚Äôt miss this! What a great experience in Galway! We walked leisurely from cozy bars and coffee shops to a high end restaurant (fabulous chowder) and even a whiskey tasting thrown in. Lots of variety, plenty of quantity and great background info, local stories and city history. Definitely a highlight of our time here. Loved it! üíó\n\nSydney R\n\nVerified\n\nAmazing experience - best thing I did in Ireland!! This food tour was wonderful!! Our guide was incredibly friendly and fun. I would go back and do this tour again any day. Each stop had a great story and was delicious. Highly recommend!!\n\nCarol P\n\nVerified\n\nExceeded Expectations-- So much fun!!! What a great way to get the \"flavor\" of Ireland by taking this food tour. And it really should be called Food and Drink tour, because we sampled several beers, along with spirits (I don't want to be specific so as to spoil the surprise.) Our tour guide Geena was warm and friendly, energetic and knowledgeable. She made it so much fun. Also fun were the other participants, who were having a great time as well. The food and drink were of high quality--really delicious and all were iconic Irish fare. I was lucky to have found this tour online. Our older taxi driver that brought us from Cong (an hour north of Galway) and had lived his whole life in Cong hadn't even heard about it. He asked for the contact information for himself and we gave him a Galway Food Tour card on the way home.\n\nDanielle T\n\nVerified\n\nGreat way to eat through Galway & have a great time! Anais was a wonderful tour guide. We had such a good time walking around the downtown area, getting to go to pubs that weren‚Äôt even open yet, all the food was delicious & had so much history to it. Was the perfect amount of places, walking, and felt full after! Met some great people on the tour and was the perfect first tour in Galway to get to taste a lot of things and get the lay of the land."
