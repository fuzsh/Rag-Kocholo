        "text": "Alien invasion remake fails to make its impact\n\nAlthough I have never actually seen the original of The Day The Earth Stood Still, word has it that the remake, which is in theatres now, could have been worse, but that it also could have been a lot better. Robert Wise's 1951 original, based on the Harry Bates short story Farewell to the Master, saw a lone spaceship landed in President’s Park in Washington, DC on “a mission of goodwill”. It was ground-breaking in its day and in that era of curiosity, became an instant classic. In the remake, a massive futuristic globe (kudos go out to the computer-generated techies who worked on this version of the film) descends upon New York's Central Park and out pops a representative of an alien race named Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) and his trusty sidekick robot, an Oscar-esque titanium figure who is eventually given the acronym name GORT (Genetically Organised Robotic Technology). Immediately we know we’re about to embark on a film that, having long surpassed its sell-out date in the believability department, can only be described as cheesy.\n\nRead more ...\n\nA Galway Christmas book stocking\n\nIN TIMES of recession, when uncertainty is the name of the game, there is something solid and comforting about a book.

It was time to get happy and spread the good vibes. He called some friends and asked them to pop along to sing on some new songs he had written. Emanuel had no idea the phenomenon I’m From Barcelona was to become.\n\nRead more ...\n\nTown Hall - coming attractions\n\nAS THE curtain comes down on one year, the Town Hall is already raising it for the New Year with the release of its programme details from January to March 2009. It’s a packed schedule of quality theatre, music, dance, and comedy with much to look forward to.\n\nRead more ..."
