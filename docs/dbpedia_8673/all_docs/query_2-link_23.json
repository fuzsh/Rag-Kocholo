        "text": "Her magical performances have gained rave reviews from both the judges and the voting public, with William Hill giving her odds of 4-1.\n\nJust five budding performers are now battling out for the top prize, to star as Maria Von Trapp in Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new stage production of The Sound of Music, which opens at the London Palladium in early November.\n\nTony Kenny, Irish spokesman for William Hill, said: “Aoife is improving rapidly, and the way she’s performing at the moment, it wouldn’t be a major shock to see the Salthill songstress go all the way.\n\n“She looks fantastic, she’s got a great voice and the audience love her. Despite what our odds say, I think she’ll win.”\n\nThe new favourite to win is Siobhan Dillon, who’s father is from Dublin.\n\nThe 21-year-old Staffordshire singer is now quoted at 11-8 odds by William Hill to take the coveted prize."
