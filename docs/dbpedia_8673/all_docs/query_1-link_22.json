        "text": "Legally So I promised I would keep you up to date with my theatregoing, therefore it’s only right I should tell you about “Legally Blonde” the musical, which I saw last Saturday with Mrs Chrisparkle and Mother-in-law at the Savoy. Sometimes you just get one of those happy circumstances when everything falls right into place. I’m delighted to say that “Legally Blonde” is a joyful night at the theatre. Witty songs, star performances and perfect casting add up to a well deserved standing ovation. I’ve not seen the film but Mother-in-law had, had enjoyed it very much; but thought the musical show was better.\n\nWe’re still in Preview Mode for this show – one of the longest set of previews I can remember – so I guess it could all change before opening night, but why would they? This show is going to run and run, and with Sheridan Smith, (aka @Sheridansmith1 – go on, follow her, she’s very nice), we’ve got one of those “A Star Is Born” moments. She’s just perfect for the role of Elle, and with immaculate comic timing. She’s on stage nearly all the time and you never tire of seeing her. Also on top form are Jill Halfpenny whose Paulette was touching and hilarious, and to Aoife Mulholland (who’s come a long way since the pre-Maria days) dancing and skipping perfectly.\n\nThe courtroom scene is completely wonderful, engaging the audience and moving the story on apace with humour and musicality – everything a musical number should be. I’m a firm believer that, in musicals, you must come out of a song in a different place from where you went into it, if you know what I mean. The songs really need to move the story on. Nothing worse than a show where the songs hold up the story and you have to wait for them to finish before you can progress. No worries about that here. The courtroom song/scene does it brilliantly.\n\nDuncan James fans made themselves known by whooping on his entrance; I thought they were going to ruin it, but they didn’t. Mr James himself absolutely looked the part even if I found his singing a trifle underwhelming. Alex Gaumond as Emmett struck the perfect note of being lovelorn without realising it.\n\nOmigod you guys you just gotta see this show it’s like double totally fab. I had to put a sentence like that in, as it rather sums up one aspect of the show. But don’t be deluded into thinking this is a dumbed-down teenager-only-appealing entertainment. It’s a classically structured show and the best new musical I have seen for Some Considerable Time."
