        "text": "Grammy Award-winner Michelle Williams will star as Roxie Hart in the West End production of the musical Chicago, playing at the Cambridge Theatre, beginning July 13, and continuing through August 22. The musical is currently booking through October 30.\n\nWilliams, who will be making her West End debut, rose to fame as one third of the top selling female group Destiny’s Child, which also includes Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Rowland. Williams previously starred on Broadway in the title role of Aida and in the national tour of The Color Purple.\n\nThe musical currently stars Aoife Mulholland as Roxie Hart (until July 11), Rachel McDowall as Velma Kelly and Ian Kelsey as Billy Flynn (both until May 30), David Ganly as Amos Hart and Gina Murray as Mama Morton. As previously announced, Jerry Springer will make his West End debut starring as Billy Flynn beginning June 1. Leigh Zimmerman will return to star as Velma Kelly at the same time."
