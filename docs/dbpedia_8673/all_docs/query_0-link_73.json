        "text": "Bláithín, along with Aaron O’Hagan, Brendan Mulholland and Luke Ward, make up the newly formed powerhouse quartet ‘Tempest’, who have burst onto the traditional music scene with their unmistakable Ulster style and rip-roaring tunes, and whose widely anticipated debut album will be released in the coming year. She has been involved in many musical collaborations over the years,most recently ‘Dúchas sa Cheol’ with harpist Dr Lauren Ní Néill (2023), ‘Ár gCónair’ for the British-Irish Council for Minority Languages with Amránaí na Bliana, Dr Síle Denvir (2022 & 2023), and The Colmcille 500 celebrations, where she composed and arranged an air for an Irish translation of a poem by Scottish-Gàidhlig poet Marcus Mac an Turnèir (2020:see ‘Amhrán na Cille’, YouTube).\n\nBláithín has been involved in many media productions- as a singer, for TG4, BBC Gaeilge, Nós Magazine and Meon Eile, and as a presenter for the radio programme ‘Siúlóidí’ (2022) and presenter for the Sean Nós series ‘An Fonn Óg’ for BBC Radio Ulster / BBC sounds. She has also guested on podcasts including ‘Seal le Seán’ and the award winning RTÉ 1 podcast, “Beo ar Éigean’ (2023). This April 2024, Bláithín was presented with the Gradam Cois Life in Dublin for exceptional contribution to the tradition of singing in the Irish language. Bláithín’s greatest passion is introducing the traditional songs and style of her own region, Oirialla, to a wide audience and in particular, to play a role in their revival and regeneration.\n\nZoë, no stranger to the stage, has performed with an impressive list of international artists including Riverdance, Damien Rice, Lou Reed, Nick Cave, Rodrigo y Gabriella to mention but a few. In contrast to this, she has been an important figure within classical music circles in Ireland and abroad, as her crossover discipline has allowed her the pleasure of appearing as soloist with acclaimed orchestras such as The Irish Chamber Orchestra, National Symphony Orchestra, BBC Symphony Orchestra and German WDR Symphony Orchestra; pieces recited include her own compositions and works composed for her by world renowned Irish composer, Bill Whelan.\n\nJohn grew up in the Cooley Mountains of north County Louth where he took up guitar at 8 years of age. He began his career as electric guitarist with the successful indie band, The Revs with whom he performed on many famous stages and festivals including Oxygen, and Slane in Ireland, Reading and Leeds in the UK, and toured extensively in USA, Australia and Europe. He has worked alongside many world-renowned producers, and is now also producing and recording in many genres. John studied classical guitar and piano for many years, and from early childhood was immersed in the language, songs and traditional dance music of south west Donegal – his father’s homeplace.\n\nThe duo has recorded on major film soundtracks including Finding You (Red Sky Studio 2021), Riverdance The Animated Adventure (Universal 2021), and Zoë has recorded on award winning Float Like A Butterfly (Samson Films 2018) and Artemis Fowl (Disney 2020) as soloist with a hand-picked symphony orchestra in George Martin’s world-renowned AIR studios in London.\n\nZoë and John have collaborated over the past five years with award winning Scots Gaelic singer Julie Fowlis and bouzouki player of international renown, Éamon Doorley, both based in Inverness in Scotland. Releasing a groundbreaking recording of newly crafted songs and tunes, ‘Allt’ is the culmination of a composition project inspired by old and new Gaelic poetry from Scotland and Ireland. Emotive and powerful, their album was awarded five stars from Songlines UK, listed as “one of the albums of the year” from The Irish Times, and described as “a modern classic” by Folk Radio UK. The “awesome foursome” are currently working on a follow up album so watch this space!\n\nTogether, Zoë Conway and John Mc Intyre have been described as “simply one of the best folk duos on the planet” (BBC), and audiences in Ireland and beyond keep coming back for more. They have performed for rock stars, millionaires and dignitaries around the world, including Irish Presidents Mary Mc Aleese and Michael D. Higgins. They were awarded Best Live Show from popular YouTube channel, Balcony TV, and have received in excess of a combined half a million views online.\n\n“An ceol is binne agus is cruinne dá gcuala mé riamh.”"
