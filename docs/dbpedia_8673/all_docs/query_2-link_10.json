I couldn’t ask for more, plus we get all this exposure on TV. Whatever happens I’ve had a brilliant time already.”\n\nAoife said her stint as the Galway Rose in the Rose of Tralee festival in 2003 has prepared her well.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been taking part in amateur musicals in Co Galway, and she revealed the first one she starred in was The Sound of Music.\n\nOnly last September, Aoife decided to quit her job and move to London to take up studying for an MA in Acting and Musical Theatre at the Central School of Speech and Drama.\n\n“I said if I don’t do it now, I will regret it for the rest of my life,” she said.\n\nAt auditions in Lloyd Webber’s country pile, Aoife said: “We performed in his little theatre in an old church. He has put on all his shows there first, like Phantom of the Opera, Starlight Express. It was such an honour to perform on a stage where all those shows have gone before.”\n\nViewers are getting the chance to vote for their favourites in the show which airs on BBC One on Saturday nights."
