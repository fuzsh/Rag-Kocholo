        "text": "AoifePronunciation EE-fə\n\nIrish: [ˈiːfʲə]OriginLanguage(s)Goidelic languagesMeaning\"beautiful, radiant\"Region of originIrelandOther namesVariant form(s)Aífe, AeifeRelated namesfrom Aífe (Aeife)\n\nAoife ( EE-fə, Irish: [ˈiːfʲə]) is an Irish feminine given name. The name is probably derived from the Irish Gaelic aoibh, which means \"beauty\" or \"radiance\".[1] It has been compared to the Gaulish name Esvios (Latinized Esuvius, feminine Esuvia), which may be related to the tribal name Esuvii and the theonym Esus.[2]\n\nIrish mythology\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Irish mythology, Aífe the daughter of Airdgeimm, sister of Scathach, is a warrior woman beloved of Cuchullain in the Ulster Cycle. T. F. O'Rahilly supposed that the Irish heroine reflects an otherwise unknown goddess representing a feminine counterpart to Gaulish Esus.[3]\n\nAífe or Aoife was also one of the wives of Lir in the Oidheadh chloinne Lir (\"Fate of the Children of Lir\"), who turned her stepchildren into swans. There is also Aoife (Áiffe ingen Dealbhaoíth), a woman transformed into a crane, whose skin after death became Manannán's \"Crane-bag\".[4]\n\nBiblical rendering\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name is unrelated to the Biblical name Eva, which was rendered as Éabha in Irish, but due to the similarity in sound, Aoife has often been anglicised as Eva or Eve. Aoife MacMurrough (also known as Eva of Leinster) was a 12th-century Irish noblewoman. The first use of Aoife (that spelling) as a given name in 20th-century Ireland was in 1912.[5]\n\nGiven name\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nAoife Ahern, Dean of Engineering at University College, Dublin\n\nAoife Cusack (born 1996), Irish professional wrestler who performs under the ring name Aoife Valkyrie\n\nAoife Dooley (born 1991), Irish writer\n\nAoife Hoey (born 1983), Irish bobsledding olympian\n\nAoife Mannion (born 1995), Irish association footballer\n\nAoife McLysaght, Irish scientist\n\nAoife Melia, Irish medical doctor\n\nAoife Moore, (fl. 2020's), sometimes Aoife-Grace Moore, Northern Irish journalist\n\nAoife Mulholland (born 1978), Irish actress\n\nAoife Ní Fhearraigh, Irish singer\n\nAoife O'Donovan (born 1982), American singer\n\nAoife O'Rourke (born 1997), Irish boxer\n\nAoife Walsh (born 1989), Irish fashion model\n\nCharacters in modern fiction\n\n[edit]\n\nAoife, sister of Scathach in Michael Scott's series The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel\n\nMain character in The Iron Thorn by Caitlin Kittredge\n\nAife, a succubus in Lost Girl\n\nAoife Brubeck, daughter of Holly Sykes, the protagonist of The Bone Clocks by David Mitchell\n\nAoife Rabbitte, wife of Jimmy Rabbitte, in The Guts by Roddy Doyle\n\nAoife Riordan, member of the Riordan family, in Instructions For A Heatwave by Maggie O'Farrell\n\nAoife Molloy, main character of Saving and Redeeming 6, books 3 and 4 of The Boys of Tommen series.\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nAoife (album) (1996), the second album by the Irish singer Aoife\n\nThe LÉ Aoife (P22) is a Republic of Ireland naval vessel\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Irish-language given names\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
