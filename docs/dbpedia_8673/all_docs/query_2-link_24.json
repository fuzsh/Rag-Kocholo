        "text": "After studying Music at University College Dublin, Irish Maria Aoife Mulholland moved to London and embarked on a Masters in Acting Musical Theatre at the Central School of Speech and Drama, where she met soon-to-become-fellow-Maria Abi Finley. The two girls initially auditioned for How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? for a bit of fun, but soon found themselves flying through the rounds, and earning themselves places in the top ten.\n\nAoife started off with a nod to fellow Irishmen The Corrs, by singing their popular ballad 'Runaway'. She then went on to demonstrate her versatility by tackling songs ranging from a sexy, sultry rendition of 'Sway' to an energetic performance of 'Footloose'. Unfortunately, the latter landed her in the bottom two in week 5 of the competition, leading to a heartbreaking sing-off against her best friend Abi. Aoife came out tops, only to then be placed in the second sing-off of the weekend later that evening, this time against Second Chance Maria Siobhan Dillon. After battling it out to the tune of 'Don’t Cry For Me Argentina', the Lord decided Aoife’s time was up, and chose to save Siobhan.\n\nAoife’s Maria journey may well have come to an end, but her West End dream was far from over; by December 2006, she was gracing the stage of the Cambridge Theatre in her West End debut as murderess Roxie Hart in hit musical Chicago. Aoife’s Roxie was manipulative yet hugely likeable, with her portrayal involving a successful blend of sexiness and girlish innocence.\n\nIn the spring of 2007, Aoife traded in Fosse and fishnets for God and goatherds, when her ambition of becoming Maria was finally fulfilled. She auditioned for, and was offered, the role of alternate Maria, performing two of eight shows a week when principal Maria Connie Fisher suffered from vocal damage. Aoife shone in the role, winning the hearts of many, including Megan Reynolds of the Guardian who wrote of the Irish star, \"…honest, genuine, heartfelt and passionate, and her songs were pitch-perfect.\"\n\nDuring her time in The Sound of Music, Aoife had the opportunity to perform at West End Live in 2007 and 2008, a free theatre event held in Leicester Square in the summer, delighting the masses with renditions of some of the show’s most popular tunes. She also pursued some exciting non-Maria-related ventures, including a jazz gig at the 100 Club on Oxford Street, her own concert Sway with Aoife in her hometown of Galway, Ireland (which was recorded for a live album release), performing at Chicago's tenth Anniversary Gala, and appearing in Chess in Concert at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nAoife relished playing Maria, particularly \"getting married every night!\", but describes stepping out onto the Palladium stage for the first times as one of the scariest moments of her life: \"Strapped to that mountain and trying to belt out 'The hills are alive' can be a tricky thing to master! After a few performances I learned to love it and was so honoured to perform on that stage.\"\n\nAoife’s last performance as Maria on 20th August 2008 was an emotional one, with the cast saying a teary goodbye to arguably the best Maria they’d had. Happily, Aoife wasn’t away from the stage for long, completing another stint as Roxie Hart from November 2008 to July 2009, starring alongside various remarkable Velma Kellys including diminutive Anna-Jane Casey and Amazonian Rachel McDowall.\n\nBut what of Aoife now? She can be found donning a bright orange jumpsuit as fitness queen Brooke Wyndham in the hit musical Legally Blonde at the Savoy Theatre, where she boasts abs of steel that are the envy of all who lay eyes on them.\n\nAnd does Aoife have any advice for our final Dorothys?\n\n\"Be yourself, as long as you are true to yourself they cannot turn you into something you’re not. Don’t cry when they ask you to!! And above all do not take criticism personally – they are making a TV show so they can’t give everyone good comments, they have to dramatise it to a certain degree. Soak up all the training and tuition and, if you can, enjoy the live performances. Ooh, and if they give you a crap song like 'Footloose', try your very best to change it!\"\n\nFor more Aoife-related news and information, head on over to her website.\n\nComments\n\nTo post a comment, you must register and login."
