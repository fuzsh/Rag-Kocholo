He and Diego Luna founded Canana Films in Mexico City. García Bernal was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for The Motorcycle Diaries in 2005, and in 2016 won his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor — Television Series Musical Or Comedy for Mozart in the Jungle.

Born in Norfolk, England, on 29th May 1959, he embarked on his acting journey at a young age, leaving school at 16 to study drama in London. His superior command of the stage combined with his innate talent for captivating an audience soon landed him roles in prestigious theater productions. The ascent of Everett's career can be mapped through his performances, beginning from his debut role in the West End production of Another Country to his celebrated performances in plays such as The Vortex. Everett's transition from stage to screen was marked by the same intensity and gravitas that defined his theatre career. His breakthrough role came in 1984 when he starred in the film adaptation of Another Country, earning acclaim for his portrayal of an openly gay student in an English public school. This launched him into the international spotlight, leading to roles in films like The Comfort of Strangers, Cemetery man, and My Best Friend's Wedding. His performance in the latter earned him a Golden Globe nomination, solidifying his place in Hollywood. Beyond his acting career, Everett has also made strides as a writer. His memoirs, Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins and Vanished Years, provide insightful glimpses into his life and experiences in the entertainment industry. He keenly documents his encounters with various personalities, his struggles within the industry, and his life beyond the glitz and glamour. His writing is noted for its wit, candor, and intimate portrayal of a life lived in the spotlight.\n\nCarrie Fisher, born on October 21, 1956, in Beverly Hills, California, was an iconic figure in the entertainment industry who left a lasting imprint on both cinema and literature. She was a multifaceted talent: an actress, writer, and humorist, best known for her role as Princess Leia in the Star Wars franchise. Fisher was the daughter of renowned Hollywood actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher, making her entry into show business almost inevitable. Fisher's acting career took off in 1975 with her debut in the Broadway revival of Irene. However, it was her role in George Lucas's epic space opera Star Wars in 1977 that catapulted her to international fame. Her portrayal of the fearless Princess Leia Organa, a character she reprised in several sequels and spin-offs, became a pop culture phenomenon. Despite her success on screen, Fisher also faced personal challenges, including struggles with substance abuse and bipolar disorder, which she openly discussed in various interviews and writings. Apart from her acting prowess, Fisher was a gifted writer. She penned several semi-autobiographical novels, including the bestseller Postcards from the Edge, which was later adapted into a film starring Meryl Streep. She also established herself as one of Hollywood's top script doctors, polishing scripts for popular films such as Sister Act and The Wedding Singer. Fisher's candidness about her personal life, combined with her sharp wit and insightful commentary, made her a beloved figure far beyond her iconic Star Wars role.\n\nAmanda Donohoe (born 29 June 1962) is an English actress. She first came to attention as a 16-year-old living with pop singer Adam Ant, appearing in the music videos for the Adam and the Ants singles \"Antmusic\" (1980) and \"Stand and Deliver\" (1981) during their four-year relationship. She later moved to the United States, where she appeared in films and on television series, including a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress-winning performance during her two years (1990–92) as C.J. Lamb on the NBC drama series L.A. Law. Other television roles include Natasha Wylde on the British soap opera Emmerdale (2009–10). She has had numerous stage roles, including Yelena in Uncle Vanya (New York 1996).\n\nLaurence Olivier, born on May 22, 1907, in Dorking, Surrey, England, is celebrated globally as one of the most remarkable actors of the 20th century. His journey to becoming a titan of the stage and screen began at All Saints' Choir School, where he nurtured his love for theater. Olivier leaped onto the professional scene after graduating from London's Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art. He quickly gained recognition for his dynamic performances and striking interpretations across a wide range of characters, including Shakespearean leads. Olivier's career was marked by his mastery over both stage and film. He achieved considerable acclaim with the Old Vic Theatre, notably his performance in the title role of Hamlet (1937). However, Olivier's talent was not confined to the stage alone. Transitioning to the silver screen, he directed and starred in three Shakespeare films that are considered classics: Henry V (1944), Hamlet (1948), and Richard III (1955). Olivier's portrayal of Hamlet won him an Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the first actor-director to receive such an honor. Beyond his illustrious acting career, Laurence Olivier served as the director of Britain's National Theatre from its inception in 1963 until 1973, contributing significantly to the transformation of the British theatre landscape. Despite battling severe illnesses towards the end of his life, Olivier continued to perform, earning him a reputation for his resilience and dedication to his craft. His storied career earned him numerous honors, including a peerage in 1970, making him the only actor to have been accorded a life peerage. Laurence Olivier's legacy continues to inspire generations of performers and theatre enthusiasts worldwide. His death on July 11, 1989, marked the end of an era, but his impact on the world of performing arts remains unforgettable."
