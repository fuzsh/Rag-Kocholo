        "text": "It comes as no surprise that there’s an abundance of Galway stars sharing their talent abroad.\n\nFrom actors to soccer players, there’s no doubt that Galwegians have made an impact on the global stage.\n\nNicola Coughlan\n\nThe internationally renowned actress hails from Oranmore and attended NUIG. Nicola stole everybody’s hearts as Clare Devlin in the beloved sitcom Derry Girls and is also known for her role in the Netflix period drama Bridgerton. Coughlan’s talent has been recognised in the industry receiving the Rising Star Award at the Irish Film and Television Awards in 2021.\n\nDavid Forde\n\nThe goalkeeper comes from Clarinbridge and forged his career with Galway United and then went on to sign with West Ham. In 2008, he made the move to Milwall and played eight seasons there. Other teams he has played for include Cardiff City, Cambridge United and Bournemouth. Forde also played for the Republic of Ireland national team from 2011 until 2016.\n\nGrandad Frank\n\nThe 75-year-old Galway native TikTok star now resides in Kent. Grandad Frank is a social media personality, comedy content creator and dancer whose wholesome videos have totalled more than 140 million likes while capturing the hearts of over 6 million followers.\n\nNora Jane Noone\n\nThe Galway city actress is widely known for her debut role in The Magdalene Sisters and went on to appear in Brooklyn and The Descent. Noone made the Irish Times list of Ireland’s greatest film actors in 2020.\n\nGraham Lee\n\nLee has had outstanding success as a jockey both near and far, including riding five Cheltenham winners throughout his career. Not to mention the excitement of 2004, when he won the Grand National and a mere two weeks later he rode the Scottish Grand National winner.\n\nSeán Cannon\n\nThe only Galway Dubliner grew up in The Claddagh. Cannon travelled around Europe before settling in the UK where he released three solo albums in the ’70s. The talented guitarist was a member of the Dubliners from 1982 and for their follow-up band The Dublin Legends.\n\nLayla Flaherty\n\nThe Shantalla native has carved a career as a model and actress. She moved across the pond to Liverpool in 2005 and appeared on E4’s Desperate Scousewives and TV3’s Celebrity Salon. Flaherty has appeared in UK publications Love It and Heat as well as magazines closer to home such as VIP and Galway Now.\n\nGreg Cunningham\n\nAt the tender age of 18, Cunningham made his debut for Manchester City’s first team in the FA Cup against Scunthorpe back in 2010. The defender is currently signed with Preston North End and is part of the Republic of Ireland squad."
