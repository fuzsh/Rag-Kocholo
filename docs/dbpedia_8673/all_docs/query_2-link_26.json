Let's watch some more\n\nBut it's more than just a workout\n\nIt's a defensive weapon too\n\nSimply wrap it round your assailant's neck\n\nAnd pull till he turns blue\n\nYou can also use the patented handle grip\n\nTo shatter your attacker's spine\n\nAnd all for three small payments of\n\n$1999\n\nYou'll have him whipped into shape\n\nWhen you get grief from a guy\n\nJust work him over with this\n\nTill he starts to cry\n\nIf he don't act like he should\n\nYou've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good\n\nIt gets you out of any sway\n\nIt gets you whipped into shape\n\nCome on, people\n\nWhipped into shape\n\nWhat does not kill us makes us hotter\n\nHands? Who thinks she's guilty?\n\nOkay, now here is where you kids come in\n\nBrooke has trouble trusting me\n\nI'm her only chance to win\n\nBut I don't speak MTV\n\nThough Brooke won't help her own defense\n\nShe may listen to her peers\n\nGo and place a little sense\n\nIn the space between her ears\n\nI'm a Delta, not now\n\nI want her whipped into shape\n\nIf there's a brain in that hair\n\nTell it that I am the key\n\nIt's a plea or the chair\n\nSee when I talk to her I\n\nGet neither plea nor plan nor alibi\n\nTo quote from our defendant's tape\n\nI want her whipped into shape\n\nTo the jail\n\nLadies, just because we're at Boston Women's Correctional Facility\n\nDoes not mean we can't become the best that we can be\n\nHere we go\n\nCircle, circle, under, over through, around again, good\n\nCircle, circle, under, over through, around\n\nAll right, ladies, we can't break out of here\n\nBut we sure can break a sweat\n\nLeft, right, left, right, good\n\nLeft, right, left, right, left, right\n\nWork it out\n\nI want you whipped into shape\n\nWhen I say jump, say \"How high?\"\n\nYou know you're doing it right\n\nWhen you start to cry\n\nIf you don't look like you should\n\nYou've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good\n\nLike prison, ladies, no escape\n\nTill you're whipped into shape\n\nWhip it, whip it\n\nWhipped into shape\n\nWhip it, whip it\n\nSwipe it, swipe it, swipe it through, check it out, double jump\n\nSwipe it, swipe it, swipe it through, check it out, double jump\n\nThat's right, you've got it\n\nWhip it, whip it, whip it\n\nGet whipped into shape\n\nLyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
