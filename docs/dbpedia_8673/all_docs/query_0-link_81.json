Examples of the artists’ new work is freely available to view online at: https://www.itma.ie/drawingfromthewell/\n\nDrawing from the Well will visit venues across Ireland including The Duncairn, Belfast, on September 27th.\n\nArtist Bios\n\nAoife Ní Bhriain\n\nFiddle player Aoife Ní Bhriain combines the richness of a family heritage of traditional music and a lifetime of classical music training. Born in Dublin she began studying the violin at an early age winning numerous national and international competitions for both classical and traditional Irish music. Her unique musical pedigree has led her to experiment, collaborate and perform across many musical genres with artists such as pianist Eliso Virsaladze, fiddle player Martin Hayes, jazz guitarist Wolfgang Muthspiel, actor Tim Robbins, and the avant garde string quintet Wooden Elephant. With her father uilleann piper Mick O’ Brien and flute player Emer Mayock she has recorded two albums of tunes sourced from the Canon Goodman Collection. Aoife holds an abiding interest and admiration for the fiddle playing of Tommie Potts.\n\nAoife has worked with ITMA on a number of projects. She has featured in our concerts in the National Concert Hall, performing her interpretations of the music of Tommie Potts. She featured on ITMA’s Saothar series as a composer in 2023.\n\nStephanie Keane\n\nStephanie Keane is an Irish dance artist, performer and choreographer from Limerick. Her style is influenced by her formative dancing years as a competitive Irish step dancer at world championship level, and her immersion in the tradition of Sean Nós dancing as an adult. Through learning tunes in her feet and by pushing the boundaries of her own dance experience, she has developed her own unique style of Irish dance and is an well established Irish dance artist. She continues to evolve as an artist, working on new projects in film, theatre, dance choreography and sound production.\n\nStephanie's performance style combines the best elements of Sean Nós dancing with her fiery individuality built on a keen sense of tradition. She connects with the music, dancing the tune with her feet, and naturally understands the musician's interpretation of the tune. Her style is free flowing, energetic and wild.\n\nIarla Ó Lionáird\n\nIarla Ó Lionáird has carved unique career in music both internationally and in Ireland. Iarla’s voice is one that ventures far beyond the boundaries of any one genre: a defiantly unclassifiable sound. He’s a child of traditional music, born and bred in Cúil Aodha, with Seán Ó Riada a neighbour and indisputable early influence. His great aunt, the traditional singer Elizabeth Cronin, had forged a reputation for rich interpretation before him.\n\nA twice Grammy nominated artist, Ó Lionáird has worked with a stellar cast of composers internationally and he has performed and recorded with such luminaries as Peter Gabriel, Nick Cave, Robert Plant and Sinead O'Connor. His unique singing style has carried him to stages and concert halls all over the world, from New York's Carnegie Hall to the Sydney Opera House and beyond. He has performed as soloist with concert and symphony orchestras. His voice has graced the silver screen also, with film credits extending from \"The Gangs of New York\" to \"Hotel Rwanda\" and most recently as featured singer in the film “Brooklyn” starring Saoirse Ronan. He is the vocalist with the critically acclaimed Irish /American band \"The Gloaming.\"\n\nRecently, Iarla presented an episode of ITMA’s Taoscadh ón Tobar series which was broadcasted on TG4. In this episode, Iarla explores and discusses a collection of songs, collected by A. Martin Freeman, from his native Ballyvouney, Co. Cork.\n\nDerek Hickey\n\nDerek Hickey is from Adare in County Limerick. Influenced by both of his grandfathers, who played fiddle, Derek began to play music at age 10, beginning lessons with Dónal de Barra when he was 12. Three years later, he joined the Shannonside Céilí Band, touring extensively in England and throughout Europe. In 1991 Frankie Gavin asked Derek to join him for regular sessions in his then leased hotel in Kinvara, Co. Galway. The following year, Derek joined Arcady, Johnny ‘Ringo’ McDonagh’s band, performing alongside Frances Black, Brendan Larrisey and Patsy Broderick.In 1995 he joined De Dannan, recording two albums and touring until they disbanded in 2003.\n\nDerek is the button accordion tutor on the BA Irish Music and Dance at the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance at the University of Limerick. In 2023 he performed at the National Concert Hall Dublin, as part of the third series of the Irish Traditional Music Archive’s ‘Drawing from the Well’ series.

This is just as true for the diaspora as it is in Ireland, and the McGoldrick family in Manchester exemplify the transmission of musical heritage and talent from generation to generation. ‘One For The Road’ captures four family members bridging the gap between the past and the present. Led by Michael on uilleann pipes/ﬂute, the band also comprises his nieces, Catherine on wooden ﬂute, Ciara on concertina/vocals, and Mairead on whis-tle/bodhrán, accompanied on guitar by Jimmy Patrick from Barrow-in-Furness.\n\nBrendan, Michael's father, is a skilful tin whistle player from Co.Galway and his mother Teresa, an ardent ballad singer from Co.Mayo. Michaelʼs older siblings all learned whistle, and he followed in their footsteps after starting on bodhrán. Inﬂuenced by the likes of Matt Molloy and Seamus Tansey, Michael graduated to ﬂute, and later uilleann pipes, going on to be one of the most prominent traditional musicians of his generation, playing with many major acts including Flook, Lúnasa, Capercaillie, Sharon Shannon, Mark Knopﬂer, the Transatlantic Sessions, Usherʼs Island and in a trio with John McCusker and John Doyle. Michaelʼs playing and compositions, embracing a wide range of musical inﬂuences, but always strongly based in traditional music, have inspired younger musicians, especially in Manchester, and he unfailingly makes time to encourage and mentor the next generation.\n\nMichael's three nieces are accomplished musicians in their own right. Sisters, Catherine and Ciara, developed their skills studying Traditional Music at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, exploring the thriving traditional music scene in Glasgow. Their considerable ability and dedication shine through in every note they play. Ciara, taking after her grand-mother, also showcases her vocal talents on the album. Her heartfelt and emotive singing bring a distinctive depth and authenticity to the songs. Mairead, brings her own exception-al talent as All-Ireland Fleadh whistle champion and third place bodhrán medallist to the mix. Her rhythmic agility provides the backbone of the band’s infectious grooves.\n\nHaving each inherited, sustained, and built on Brendan and Teresaʼs love of the music, Michael, Catherine, Ciara and Mairead have come together playing live gigs and making this recording, which represents a legacy of the familyʼs shared instrumental and vocal prowess. Together, they have created a collection of tunes and songs that is both deeply rooted in tradition and infused with contemporary ﬂair. Their seamless blend of instruments and heartfelt performances transport the listener to Ireland, Scotland and Brittany, evoking a sense of place and exuberance. From foot-stomping jigs and reels, to hauntingly beauti-ful ballads, each track is a testament to the family's passion for their craft and their com-mitment to pushing the boundaries of traditional music.\n\nThe Jolly Angler depicted on the front cover was, until its permanent closure in the pandemic, one of Manchesterʼs best loved Irish traditional music session pubs, perhaps most renowned for its late night, occasionally all night, sessions. ‘One For The Roadʼ is Brendanʼs favourite saying at late night sessions watching his son and granddaughters grow up playing with others, and whether referring to another tune, another pint, or most likely both, itʼs a ﬁtting title for the McGoldrick Familyʼs debut album.\n\nView Event →\n\nRebecca Hill & Charlie Stewart\n\n“An outstanding achievement of musicality, ingenuity and passion ” Duncan Chisholm\n\n“Gorgeous melodies and rich harmony, stunningly played with huge heart, sense of space and a huge helping of understated playfulness ” Lauren MacColl\n\nRebecca Hill and Charlie Stewart are a harpist and fiddle player based in the thriving traditional music scene in Glasgow.

A dynamic Irish singer/songwriter whose music is defined by passion, lyricism, and a respect for tradition coupled with a willingness to defy expectations, was already a seasoned veteran of the folk scenes in Europe and the British Isles when he reinvented himself as Luka Bloom in 1987.\n\nAs a solo acoustic act with a big voice and intense guitar style he managed to channel the energy and power of rock into albums like The Acoustic Motorbike (1992), Turf (1994) and Between the Mountain and the Moon (2002), rising to international acclaim and becoming one of Ireland's best-respected contemporary folk artists.\n\nProlific in the studio and even more so on the stage, Bloom's career became that of the seemingly tireless D.I.Y. troubadour whose unpredictable varied musical repertoire has included eclectic cover albums, socio-political anthems, world music fusions, and heartfelt organic folk. After starting his own label, he maintained a steady stream of studio and live albums like The Man Is Alive (2008) and 2014's jazz-folk standout Head & Heart, and also published the memoir Homeplace. Amid his varied catalogue are also a number of interesting diversions including a 2018 guided meditation album.\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Breath\n\nRíoghnach Connolly and Stuart McCallum are the creative heart of The Breath. And for them, it’s all about the song.\n\nConnolly writes the only way she knows how; a stream of poetic consciousness giving rise to honest, personal, heartfelt songs as likely to touch on childhood summers and first love as cultural dislocation, post-colonial injustices and grief. But it’s her deeply soulful, utterly engaging, stop-you-in-your-tracks voice – whether delicate and hushed or powerful and gutsy – coupled with Stuart’s understated brilliance and their exquisitely crafted songs, that give The Breath such emotional depth.\n\nView Event →\n\nChristmas Woodcarving with Steve Ryan\n\nSaturday 23rd November\n\n10am – 5pm\n\nCost:£55\n\nMaterials Included\n\nWith the festive season only around the corner, this is the perfect opportunity to get into the spirit of Christmas and create a beautiful hand carved decoration to brighten up your home.\n\nDuring this class Stephen Ryan from Green Woodwork Ireland will teach you the skills needed to produce your Christmas themed woodcarving, each participant can choose from a number of different designs including Santa, Christmas Tree and Snowman.

Vigorous, searching and ever-curious, Caoilfhionn has found a voice at once ancient and modern, intrepidly exploring contemporary technology to transform traditional songcraft for the mid-2020’s.\n\nCaoilfhionn’s music is rooted in a knowledge of folk, jazz and all the twentieth century’s classic tunesmiths, and seems to create a magical, otherworldly space of her own imagining, blending Caoilfhionn’s core piano with synths, and pitting a live rhythm section and saxophone embellishments against ambient samples and future-facing production techniques.\n\nSammy Copley\n\nDublin-based singer/songwriter Sammy Copley has grown up in a self-made spotlight.

Wanting to keep their sound as authentic as possible, they opted to record in Redbox Studios, the working home of good friend and musical comrade, Dónal O’Connor.

Why can’t people deal with that? Because it’s very raw, and he doesn’t sugar it up.” – Christy Moore on Jinx Lennon's music\n\n\"Look a little closer and you’ll find this positivity in all his tunes.

She experiments with her Lyon and Healy Concert Grand harp and effects, creating a sound world that is distinctly her own.\n\nThrough her use of harp, effects, synthesizers and voice, Lattimore’s live sets conjure up beautifully abstracted sonic forms that evoke a host of memories, landscapes and allusions. “I love playing for people who have never seen a harp, who think it’s a museum piece. I want people to feel like they can approach it.” In full-stride, Lattimore almost manipulates time and space.\n\nLattimore’s early works were issued by the esteemed outposts of Desire Path and Thrill Jockey Recordings and in 2014, she found a long-term home at the Ghostly International label. Her 2023 release Goodbye, Hotel Arkada, glistens as the most refined and robust in Lattimore’s decade-long catalogue.\n\nDocumented and edited over the course of two years, the record is both rooted in improvisation and fully open to the input of others. Within Goodbye, Hotel Arkada, Lattimore communes with friends, contemporaries, and long-time influences; a cast that includes Lol Tolhurst (The Cure), Meg Baird, Rachel Goswell (Slowdive), and Roy Montgomery.\n\nLattimore’s perfectly realised harp parts have led to her being a highly in-demand collaborator; recording and performing with revered artists such as Meg Baird, Thurston Moore, Sharon Van Etten, Jarvis Cocker, Kurt Vile, and Steve Gunn.\n\nTaking place at The Duncairn, this is sure to be a magical evening that will linger long after the final note.\n\n“Lattimore has helped to modernize the instrument for contemporary tastes, bathing her spectacular grand harp in an electronic glow through effects pedals and synthesizers” Pitchfork\n\n“Not just a musician, but rather a bright innovator of her time” The Line Of Best Fit\n\nView Event →\n\nCinder Well\n\nCinder Well’s experimental folk music drifts between two far-flung seas: the hazy California coast where she grew up, and the wind-torn swells of Western Ireland that she’s come to love. Her music treads a sonic and lyrical path, creating a cinematic, trance-like space that elevates traditional folk music into something ethereal. Lush and expansive sounds balanced with down-tuned instruments, intricate melodies and stunning vocals provide a heavy yet hopeful atmosphere.\n\nCadence, the latest album from Cinder Well, released April 21, 2023 on Free Dirt Records, was recorded at Hen House Studios, just blocks from the famed Venice Beach Boardwalk in Los Angeles - the songs of Cadence search for a sense of grounding and a feeling of home. Though California’s beaches are the backdrop of this album, Irish influences emerge as well.\n\n“Cadence consistently finds the dark places and, rather than bring them to light, finds beauty in them.” -No Depression\n\n“an astonishingly powerful piece of work that seems to have been conceived in uncertainty but realized with the supreme assurance of one of the most consummate songwriters around.” -Folk Radio UK\n\n\"pulls the music into a lane previously opened up by like minded artists such as Fleet Foxes and Laura Veirs.\" -Paste Magazine\n\nThe Guardian, ‘Folk Album of the Month’\n\nPaste, ’35 Most Anticipated Albums of 2023’\n\nView Event →"
