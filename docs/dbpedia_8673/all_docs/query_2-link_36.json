And while there could only be one winner – Connie Fisher – all ten girls who took part in the hit television talent show are now well on their way to solving the problem of finding a career in music and theatre. <br /><br />Connie, 23, from Pembrokeshire, South Wales, may have been the ultimate winner, wowing critics as Maria at the London Palladium – but the other contestants could hardly be described as losers. <br /><br />",

        "text": "Aoife Mulholland, 28, from Galway, landed the coveted role of Roxie Hart in the hit stage show Chicago at London's Adelphi Theatre.\n\nSemi-finalist Abi Finley, 23, from Manchester, has just finished a run as Fiona in Sir Tim Rice's Blondel at London's Pleasance Theatre and is to play Serena in the UK tourof Fame.\n\nHelena Blackman, 23, from Southampton, is starring as Dorothy in The Wizard Of Oz at the Leicester Haymarket Theatre, and previously starred as Gypsy Rose Lee at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff.\n\nAnother success story is Belinda Evans, 28, from Somerset, who is in the ensemble of the hit Lloyd Webber show The Phantom Of The Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre, Haymarket. Leanne Dobinson, 20, from Essex, finishes her run as Snow White at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, tonight, and Siobhan Dillon, 21, of Staffordshire – third in How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? – has secured a recording deal with Polydor.\n\nAlso hoping to secure a record deal is Romanian Simona Armstrong, 29, now living in Greenford, West London. As well as auditioning for West End shows, she is also hoping to record the jazz/soul album she has been writing.\n\nAnd it's back to school for the remaining two \"Marias\". Meliz Serman, 23, from Chingford, Essex, is studying for an MA in music performance at City University.\n\nWhile former Thames Valley Police intelligence officer Laura Sicurello, 26, from Milton Keynes, is four months into a one-year MA scholarship in musical theatre at the prestigious Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in North London – the very school at which Connie studied.\n\n\"It is a dream come true to be studying at the same place as Connie,\" Laura said. \"I cannot wait to be able to audition for roles, come the end of my course in September.\"\n\nSo this time next year any one of them could be playing Maria for real."
