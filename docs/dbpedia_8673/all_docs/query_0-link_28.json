        "text": "Connie was voted to play the part of Maria by the British public on the top-rating BBC TV programme ï¿½How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?ï¿½ Starring alongside her is Lesley Garrett as Mother Abbess and Alexander Hanson as Captain von Trapp. Based on the uplifting true story of the Von Trapp family, the score touches the hearts of all ages and brims over with some of the most memorable songs ever performed on the musical stage including: My Favourite Things, Do-Re-Mi, Edelweiss, Climb Evï¿½ry Mountain, Sixteen Going on Seventeen, The Lonely Goatherd and of course the glorious title song The Sound of Music.\n\nA Lisburn man who attended the Opening Night said, ï¿½the atmosphere was electric, the entire cast was superb, the set and perfectly timed special effects were magnificent and the orchestra fantasticï¿½. He had travelled to London to see Connie, the one true star of the night and he was not disappointed - she was ï¿½absolutely brilliantï¿½ he said, and proved that this really was ï¿½the part she was born to playï¿½, getting a rapturous 2,500 strong standing ovation at the end of the show from a star-studded audience that included Andrew Lloyd Webber, Graham Norton, Cilla Black, Harry Enfield, Rowan Atkinson and Bob Geldof, to name but a few.\n\nPerformance times are: 7.30pm on Mondays and Wednesdays - Saturdays, with Tuesday performances at 7.00pm, and Wednesday and Saturday matinees at 2.30pm. Tickets, priced from ï¿½25.00 - ï¿½55.00 including all booking fees, are available from the London Palladium Box Office on 0870 890 1108 or at www.soundofmusiclondon.com.\n\nIf the Sound of Music is ï¿½one of your favourite thingsï¿½ then make sure you see this fabulous show. This is the big one - a show not to be missed, even by people from Northern Ireland and low cost airline Easyjet can help to make that possible."
