        "text": "Getting to Galway\n\nBy Car Galway has fantastic access to Dublin, making it a popular place for people to visit on a trip to Ireland. By car, Galway to Dublin is just over 2 hours of driving. Other popular places like Killarney (almost 3 hrs), Cork (3 hrs), and Belfast (4 hrs), are also well within driving distance to Galway.\n\nTrain and Bus If you are using transit to get around Ireland, Galway is a great place because of the ease of getting buses to the city and because there are plenty of tours that start in Galway. You can check bus timetables here and the train timetables here.\n\nDublin is the most convenient place to access Galway using public transit. The train between Dublin and Galway will be your quickest option, it’s only 2.5 hours. Using the bus, it’s 3 hours between Dublin and Galway.\n\nFrom Killarney, the bus is going to be the quickest way to get to Galway, but it does take over 5 hours and isn’t a direct route.\n\nCork has direct buses to Galway which take over 4 hours. The train isn’t faster between Cork and Galway, it’s also just over 4 hours, but it will be much more comfortable than the bus and is guaranteed to have bathrooms.\n\nWhere to Stay in Galway\n\nGalway isn’t an overly large city and it is easy enough to get around using buses if you are traveling without a car. When I visited, I was using public transit and tours only and still found it best to stay in the Salthill area of Galway.\n\nSalthill is outside the main city area of Galway but it offers great views of the Atlantic and it’s nice to be able to walk along the Salthill Promenade and beaches. If you have a car, it’s nice to not deal with the traffic in the city core. Because it’s a popular place to stay, most tour buses will also schedule pickups for this area.\n\nSalthill Hotel– This is a fantastic location to stay in Salthill with some rooms having views over the bay.\n\nSea Breeze Lodge B&B– This beautiful B&B looks out over Galway Bay. The rooms are large and king-size beds are available. A full Irish breakfast is included and this is the perfect place to stay for an Irish bed and breakfast experience.\n\nThe Nest Boutique Hostel– Located right in Salthill this hostel is not what typically comes to mind when you think hostel. There are private rooms with private bathrooms here as well as shared dormitory-style rooms. The rooms are beautifully appointed and it’s a more affordable option than many places in Galway.\n\nWhere to Eat in Galway\n\nGalway is known for its pubs with live music and there is certainly plenty to explore around Eyre Square. Being right on the ocean and having the fishing village of Claddagh right here, there is plenty of seafood on the menu. Ireland is quite vegan and vegetarian-friendly and almost all the restaurants and pubs had a veggie option. Galway is a foodie city so if you’re looking to get a taste of everything, you may want to consider joining a food tour of Galway or take yourself on a self-guided pub crawl to the best pubs in Galway.\n\nOslo Bar– Oslo Bar is located in Salthill and is home to the Galway Bay Brewery. Its claim to fame is being the first and only microbrewery in the city. They have plenty of Irish beer on tap. In addition to having great beer on tap, they also serve up delicious food here. The menu has something for everyone with vegan and vegetarian options.\n\nThe Front Door– This Irish pub is located in the Latin Quarter of Galway so it’s convenient to stop in after sightseeing in the city or on a day trip. This two-story pub is a great place to pick up some pub food, with vegetarian and vegan options available. In addition to a yummy veggie burger, they also serve up really great pie. There’s live music and lots of cozy seating.\n\nDough Bros– Delicious pizza with two convenient locations in Galway. This is the place to go if you are looking for a good pizza in Galway. They make their pizza with local cheese and they have both vegetarian and vegan options.\n\nItinerary for Galway\n\nFor Galway, I would budget at least 2 full days to do sightseeing outside of Galway and at least half a day to see sights in Galway. Galway is perfectly placed to explore some of Ireland’s top sights including the Cliffs of Moher and Connemara National Park. Both are fantastic destinations. In the evenings, Galway is a great place to try Irish cuisine and explore the local pub scene.\n\nYou can do this itinerary without a rental car by making use of guided tours and public transit. Having a car will give you a lot more flexibility in your stops and timing. It is especially useful if you are trying to plan around the weather as the Cliffs of Moher are a lot nicer with good visibility.\n\nThree Days in Galway, Ireland\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Galway by early afternoon and explore the city\n\nDay 2: Day trip to the Cliffs of Moher and the Burren\n\nDay 3: Day trip to Connemara and Cong\n\nDay 4: Depart in the morning after a traditional Irish breakfast. If you have extra time, explore along the Salthill Promenade\n\nDay 1: Best Things to Do in Galway, Ireland\n\nThis itinerary mostly focuses on the day trips that you can do from Galway so it’s limited to spending just a single day in Galway city. It’s a bit of a whirlwind visit to the city but you can see many of the top sights of Galway in a day.\n\nSpanish Arch and Latin Quarter\n\nAfter arriving to Galway, head to the Spanish Arch and Latin Quarter. The streets here are definitely quite touristy, but they are nice pedestrian streets. This area is probably the most beautiful in the city.\n\nThe Spanish Arch is a leftover from the medieval walls around Galway. It’s not the most picturesque arch I’ve seen but it has a bit of interesting history. In 1755 it was partially damaged from the resulting tsunami from the Lisbon earthquake.\n\nBefore exploring the Latin Quarter, you may want to walk outside of the Spanish Arch and across the bridge to get the iconic picture of Galway Harbour. The houses alongside the street known as The Long Walk make for a beautiful photo but you need to be across the River Corrib to really get a good one. There’s a pedestrian walking area just off of Father Griffin Rd that gives you the perfect photo opportunity for this.\n\nThe Latin Quarter is the place to shop if you are looking for a Claddagh ring. Galway is home to the Irish fishing village of Claddagh, where the ring originated from. It’s been produced in Galway since 1700 and is now mostly worn by people to celebrate their Irish heritage. The hands, heart, and crown on the ring symbolize friendship, love, and loyalty.\n\nGalway Cathedral\n\nFrom the Latin Quarter, walk to the Galway Cathedral. On the walk, you can see the river and maybe even some salmon if you’re there at the right time of year. You will also see the Salmon Weir Bridge, the oldest surviving bridge across the River Corrib. It was built in 1818 and was built to link the courthouse with the jail, where the cathedral now stands.\n\nThe Galway Cathedral is right near the River Corrib and is an imposing building. It’s not to everyone’s taste though as the outside of the building has been called ugly by some of it’s critics. It’s the newest stone cathedral in Europe, it was only completed in 1965. It’s worth taking a look inside. Galway Cathedral has some really beautiful paintings and mosaics.\n\nGalway University\n\nIf you still have time, a short walk from the Galway Cathedral is the National University of Ireland Galway. It really does look like something out of Harry Potter. The Quadrangle with the Great Hall (Aula Maxima) is a replica of Christ Church college at Oxford and is the oldest part of the university.\n\nEnd your day by enjoying some Irish food and walking along the Salthill Promenade.\n\nDunguaire Castle\n\nThe first stop of the day was at Dunguaire Castle. Just for a quick look around, this castle was built in the 16th century and looks like the classic-style of castle that children would draw or build-out of sand.\n\nBurren National Park\n\nAfter Dunguaire Castle, head towards Burren National Park. Burren National Park actually gets its name from the Irish word Boíreann, which means rocky place. And indeed when you arrive, you will see that it is very rocky indeed. It almost looks like the surface of the moon. This unique landscape is full of plants that can only be found in this area as well as sights like dolmen – megalithic tombs.\n\nDriving on the R480 road, you will begin to see the large rock covered hills of the Burren. The first stop here is at the Ballyalban Ringfort. You just need a quick stop here to see the large earthen mounds that were at one point, a defensive wall. If you have enough time in your schedule, the nearby Ailwee Cave is also an option for stopping.\n\nJust after the ringfort is the Poulnabrone Dolmen, which for me, was a huge draw to the Burren area. This large dolmen dates to the Neolithic period between 4200 BC and 2900 BC, which makes it even older than the Pyramids of Giza. Dolmens are burial sites and when Poulnabrone was excavated, they found 33 skeletons. Besides the dolmen, this area is also known for unique orchids and it feels really interesting to walk around and experience.\n\nAfter the Burren, stop in the cute town of Doolin for lunch. After a bite to eat, head to the main sight of the day, the Cliffs of Moher.\n\nCliffs of Moher\n\nThe Cliffs of Moher, or the Cliffs of Insanity if you’re a Princess Bride fan, are one of the most popular day trips from Dublin or Galway. Given that, it’s often quite busy with other tourists. Crowds aside, it’s big enough you can get some space to yourself and lots of great views.\n\nI would give at least 2 hours to explore the cliffs as well as the museum in the visitor centre. You should also be sure to climb up to O’Brien’s Tower where you can see as far as the Aran Islands and mountains in the distance. The cliffs are 214 m (702 feet) tall and from the top, it definitely feels like the Atlantic Ocean is far away. If you visit the Cliffs of Moher from April to late July, you may get to see some of the more than 7,000 puffins that breed on the cliffside.\n\nWhen you are done with exploring the Cliffs of Moher, drive along the coast for great views of the Wild Atlantic Way before returning to Galway for the night.\n\nUnfortunately, the weather when I visited was a bit drizzly and cloudy, so you definitely will want to go prepared for the rain. Despite the weather, I still had a fantastic time exploring Connemara.\n\nHike at Mamean\n\nThe first stop of the day was hiking to the chapel at Mamean. Mamean is a pilgrimage site in the Maumturk mountains. With only two hours you can hike as far as the chapel just to get a view of the mountains that surround you in the pass. According to the stories, Mamean pass was used by St. Patrick to preach and spread Christianity in the area. The altar rock here was also used as a place to practice religion when Roman Catholicism was outlawed in the 1800s. You don’t need to be religious to enjoy this hike though, the area is beautiful.\n\nVisit Kylemore Abbey\n\nAfter Mamean, head towards Kylemore Abbey. Depending on your interests, either spend a couple of hours here and tour the grounds or just make a quick photo stop. Kylemore Abbey was built in 1868 as a private home. It wasn’t until 1920 that it was changed into a Benedictine Monastery. It actually was operating as a school until 2010. Now, you can visit and tour the Victorian gardens that are on site. Budget about 2 hours for visiting here.\n\nAfter Kylemore Abbey, drive-by Killary Fjord and Lough Corrib on your way to Cong. Both offer fantastic views. Lough Corrib is the largest lake in Ireland and has hundreds of islands.\n\nCong and Ashford Castle\n\nWhile Cong isn’t part of Connemara, it is well worth visiting on your day trip. This adorable village has several sights worth seeing. In Cong, visit the ruins of Cong Abbey. This ruined abbey was built in the 13th century and was used until the 1500s before falling into ruin.\n\nA good short walk is in the Cong Forest. There are many small caves in Cong Forest including Pigeon Hole Cave and Priest’s Cave. You can even descend into Pigeon Hole Cave using the stone steps to go to the bottom of it. The Teach Aille cave was apparently used for food storage by monks as it keeps a cool temperature year round due to the river running below it.\n\nCong Forest is very close to Ashford Castle, one of Ireland’s most famous castles that you can actually stay at. It’s worth a quick view before heading back towards Galway for the night.\n\nVisiting Galway, Ireland\n\nGalway is a great option to add to your Ireland itinerary, especially if you are doing a short trip. It’s perfect for exploring both the city life and natural scenery that Ireland is famous for. It makes for a nice contrast with other cities like Cork, Kilkenny, or Killarney.\n\nIts location on the Wild Atlantic Way makes it perfect for exploring some of the landscapes that Ireland is famous for. As a city, Galway has a very upbeat vibe and lots of delicious food options that make it a good base for exploring the Cliffs of Moher and Connemara National Park. There’s plenty to do here so you could easily spend longer than two days in Galway if you have the time."
