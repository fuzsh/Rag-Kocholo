        "text": "Sometimes contact for looked after children is instigated without careful consideration of what it means to the child and without the right support for the contact system (the child, carer and birth relative) to make it meaningful. As a result, contact that may have benefited the child could unnecessarily be stopped or unsafe contact might be continued. To encourage decisions about contact arrangements to include consideration of how face-to-face contact can be supported to achieve positive well-being outcomes for children, Clinical Psychologists, Dr Chris Burke and Dr Anne Woodhouse, developed a framework to aid professionals involved in decision-making. The framework, known as the Safe and Meaningful Contact (SaMC) Guidelines, helps users to organise their thinking about contact arrangements around the developmental needs of the child or young person, and to consider the extent to which contact can be supported to play a part in the child or young person’s developmental progress and recovery. Attend the training to become a licensed user of the guidelines. https://lnkd.in/eKMn2Qwv #childwellbeing #SaMCGuidelines #contactarrangements\n\nTeaching teens to recognize, prevent, and address abuse is vital for their safe transition to adulthood. It enables them to set boundaries, ensuring their safety, and fosters resilience for healthier relationships. Encouraging them to speak out promotes a culture of accountability and support, benefiting both personal growth and community well-being. This proactive approach helps build a more empathetic and just society. #teencoaching #teensupport #transitions #boundariesmatter #promote #safeteens #childabuseprevention #educateyourself #personalgrowth\n\nGoing back to school after a break can be daunting for many children, here are some practical tips to ease any worries they may have from our Developmental Therapists here at bibic If you have any of your own tips - let us know in the comments\n\nHappy Monday!
