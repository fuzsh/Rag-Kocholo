        "text": "Legally Blonde is modern and ground-breaking (was the first Broadway show to air on MTV) despite its short run in the United States. The music is pop with a variety of other styles that create mood, place, and character delineation. This essay will examine its origin, the MTV craze, and briefly summarize the music styles used in its creation.\n\n“What rich, romantic planet are you from?” “Malibu.” -Emmett and Elle in “Chip on my Shoulder”\n\nIn 2001, a comedy film was released entitled Legally Blonde that was based on a novel by Amanda Brown and starred Reese Witherspoon as heroine Elle Woods. Five years later, Legally Blonde‘s libretto was penned by Heather Hach, with music and lyrics written by Laurence O’Keefe and Nell Benjamin.\n\nAfter a test-run in San Fransisco, Legally Blonde opened on Broadway at the Palace Theatre in 2007. This production starred Laura Bell Bundy as Elle, with Bailey Hanks taking over the role from July (2008) until its close in October of 2008. Other cast members included Christian Borle (Emmett), Orfeh (Paulette), Michael Rupert (Callahan), and Nikki Snelson (Brooke). The North American tours began in the September following the close, and ran until May of 2011.\n\nCurrently the show runs in London’s West End, where it has since 2009 with Sheridan Smith as Elle. Duncan James (Emmett), Jill Haffpenny (Paulette), Peter Davison (Callahan) and Aoife Mulholland (Paulette) round out the London cast. The popularity of the musical in the United Kingdom is arguably higher than its popularity in the United States, which prompted the creative team to begin the United Kingdom tours, which began July 2011 and are still touring.\n\n“But I don’t speak MTV.” -Professor Callahan in “Whipped Into Shape”\n\nWhere Legally Blonde perhaps is best known in the United States is not on its Palace Theatre stage, but rather through a recording aired on MTV in October of 2007. Referred to as a “teen network,” it was an interesting choice given the target audience for Broadway shows is middle-aged women. The idea came from MTV producers rather than from Legally Blonde‘s team, who thought the show was a perfect fit for a network special with its appealing message and pop music.\n\nThe reaction to the MTV proposal was generally well-received by the actors, who felt they could reach more audiences since its run was to be so short. Some concerns were that the musical would become famous as its own entity, leaving the actors in the dust and forgotten for their performances.\n\nLegally Blonde is the first Broadway musical to be recorded live and put on a “major” network such as MTV (in the past, recorded shows have aired on PBS). Will future shows follow in Legally Blonde‘s footsteps? Currently, the debate looms over whether airing the show aids or harms Broadway ticket sales. Would airing a show on MTV make audiences want to go see it live and experience it for real, or would it sate them enough to make them decide not to venture out and lead to the demise of Broadway?\n\n“This year’s theme is “Jamaican’ Me Crazy”!” -Sorority Girl in “What You Want”\n\nUpon listening to the Original Cast Recording of Legally Blonde (2007), it becomes apparent to listeners that they have “heard some of this somewhere before.” The soundtrack utilizes a variety of music styles, patchworked together to give Legally Blonde a unique feel. It is upbeat, modern and guides listeners to a different frame of mind each time a different style is used.\n\nTo put listeners/viewers into a happy state of mind (as Legally Blonde is intended to be upbeat), pop music, popular in the nineties and into the millennium era, is utilized. The opening number (“Omigod You Guys”) is evidence of this, and can also been seen as a glimpse into Elle’s true self. Pop also has always been regarded as superficial, much like Elle, and is revealed to be much more than that.\n\nMusic is also used by the creators to hint at a time and/or place: reggae for a college party (“What You Want,”), parade march for an entrance into Harvard (“What You Want”), violin pomp for academia (“The Harvard Variations”), jazz for a shark of a lawyer (“Blood in the Water”), a sample of the Shaker song “Simple Gifts” for Thanksgiving (“Chip on my Shoulder”), a sample of “Hark! the Herald Angels Sing,” for a Christmas time marker, and of course, and anything moderately Irish-sounding is reserved for the character of Paulette (“Ireland,” its reprise, and “Legally Blonde Remix”).\n\nWhat is interesting of note is that anything that sounds too much like “Broadway” such as the stereotypical melodramatic, uplifting love ballad or the upbeat, “we can do it” inspirational numbers are typically used in a tongue-in-cheek fashion (“Serious,” “Positive,” “Take It Like a Man”). When they are not being employed for comedic effect, the result is an eerie moment of seriousness that grounds the otherwise peppy, overly-perky show (“Legally Blonde,” where Elle is broken to the point of giving up). However, when the ballad or inspirational number is played straight, it does not last long. After “Legally Blonde” is sung, it metamorphoses into “Legally Blonde Remix,” a pop number that changes Elle back to her old, positive self.\n\nAs mentioned, the creators used pop for Elle, and reserved what sounds like traditional Irish folk music for Paulette. So this creates three types of music delineation: mood, place, and character.\n\nCriticism has emerged over Paulette’s love for Ireland masquerading as a petty excuse to engage in a Riverdance spoof. To counter this criticism, the United States touring show had the role of Paulette (played by Natalie Joy Johnson) actually speak in an Irish dialect; this made “Ireland” more internalized as part of her heritage rather than just a romantic longing.\n\n“I learned I could be more than this.” -Elle in “Find My Way/Finale”\n\nWhat viewers fail to realize is the creators’ use of pastiche places Legally Blonde into a timeless place, while streamlining time jumps and moods in seconds (instead of using tedious dialogue to do the same.) The fast-paced, timeless feeling creates an upbeat show with a universal message.\n\nSources:\n\nGardner, Elysa. “No Real Reason to Object to Airy ‘Legally Blonde.’ ” USA Today (2007): 15.
