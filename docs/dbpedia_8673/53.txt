GALWAY’S WEST-End star Aoife Mulholland has released her new album Live From Galway, which was recorded during her sell-out concerts in the Town Hall Theatre last July.

The album features 13 tracks, including medleys from Annie Get Your Gun, Chicago, and Andrew Lloyd Weber, as well as jazz and pop songs. It also features Aoife’s between song banter with the audience.

The musicians on the album are Heather Weir (piano ), Fergal Gallagher (bass ), Barry Duffy (drums ), and tenor Morgan Crowley who duets with Aoife in medleys from Chess and Chicago.

Aoife is back on stage in the Cambridge Theatre in the West End playing the part of Roxie Harte in Chicago - through Christmas and January - after a 16 month stint as Maria Von Trapp in The Sound Of Music.
