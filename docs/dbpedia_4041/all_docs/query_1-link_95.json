        "text": "This paper (presented at the scientific conference 'Configuring \"World Theatre\"' in Edinburgh in June 2019) deals with issues related to the cross-cultural communication of two unique cultures via intersemiotic translation by analysing the first Polish nō play Stroiciel fortepianu [The Piano Tuner] by the Polish artist and scholar Jadwiga Rodowicz-Czechowska. While theatre scholars (Pellechia, 2014; Nukken, 2018) have observed the conservative manner through which the nō spectacles are adapted, they have undermined the role of visual, acoustical, and kinaesthetic properties of the language of drama that offer freedom and creativity in adaptation, thus enabling intercultural exchange. The history shows (Waniek, 2012) that despite its conservatism, nō theatre has remained open to European theatrical influences, constituting a type of platform for intercultural discourse. Extraordinary as it was, the first Polish production of nō theatre became an example of a cross-cultural encounter in which two theatrical traditions met to span a bridge between two distinctive nations. Therefore, this paper demonstrates how the trio of Jadwiga Rodowicz-Czechowska (the author), Tokimasa Sekiguchi (the translator), and Tessenkai Theatre (the performers), through the symbols and subtle allusions contained in the sounds, movements and visual elements intertwined in the play's network of meanings, make this cross-cultural communication possible. The analysis is performed using three types of signs defined by semiotician Charles Sanders Peirce-symbol, index, and icon.\n\nThis issue of Nordic Theatre Studies on “Theatre and Continental Philosophy” brings together articles by Nordic, Baltic, and international researchers who re ect on the importance of speci c aspects of continental philosophy for theatre and performance studies. The authors use a variety of approaches such as focussing on a concept developed by a philosopher to explore a speci c work, company, artist, or art form, or applying a philosophical concept to develop a new approach to theatre practice. Scholars in this issue engage with such philosophers and cultural theorists as Hegel, Heidegger, Deleuze, Guattari, Foucault, Bourdieu, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Benjamin, Adorno, Horkheimer, Althusser, Barthes, Braidotti, Habermas, Agamben, Butler, Haraway, Rancière, Honig, Sjöholm, and Žižek.\n\nThis thesis discusses the work of theatre director Krzysztof Warlikowski, which holds an important place within Polish and world theatre, although it remains little known in the UK. It argues that that existing approaches to Warlikowski?s theatre are inadequate as they focus too much on the perspective of an interpreter of productions who decodes the meaning of the performance. Instead Warlikowki?s work should be approached from the perspective of an observer of the complex creative processes that lead to performance and determine its relationship with the audience. The connection between actors and spectators takes the form of an ?encounter? that offers a particular experience of theatregoing. It aims to challenge the existing customs of spectatorship and is based on destabilising and violating the sense of safety of both actors and spectators while expanding their experience of performance beyond the ?here and now?.This thesis asks questions about the distinctive conditions that m...\n\nThis paper is a modest attempt of debating with some fundamental premises of Eugenio Barba that he placed in his much applauded publication around the globe, jointly written with Nicola Savarese. Published in 1991, the book had created a cult-like influence across the disciplines, mostly among the practitioners and experts of performing art. Though the Italian authors have urged their readers not to confuse this work and their activities as a branch of anthropology, the premises contained significant elements of serious academic concernsculture, history, bodies, performances and a few more. Considering the huge readership this book achieved, with a number of translations in different languages, this article concerned with its conceptualization of a few fundamental issues and placed them in the complex plane of colonialism and transformative forces in cultural forms and expressions. This paper does not, by any means, engage with the ISTA activities, instead it explores possibilities of a dialogue with some propositions that otherwise could have read as static, ahistorical, apolitical and inclined with more dogmatic sense of what is called 'aesthetics'."
