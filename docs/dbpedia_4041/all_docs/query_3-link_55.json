        "text": "By Dion Protani\n\nLatest update: 29 October 2023\n\nRelated links\n\nBrindisi the historic port\n\n​\"Facciamo un brindisi!\", up goes the shout when Italians raise their glasses to \"make a toast\". A quirk of the language has resulted in the same word being used for both the city and the salutation but with all the countless journeys across the oceans that have ended in Brindisi over the years, no doubt with great relief on safely arriving in port, perhaps it's fitting that the two words should converge.\n\n​Brindisi isn't the first place on many people's lists of places to visit in Puglia but with its port ferrying passengers across to Greece or Albania and its airport just outside the city, it can feature prominently in travel plans. Also, a strategic port city with thousands of years of history behind it doesn't pass all that time without building up a legacy of sights that we can still enjoy today. ​\n\nSightseeing Brindisi: a mixture of the old and new\n\n​As with many cities of its size and seaside location, Brindisi offers a mixture of modern functionality with some old world charm. Very much belonging to the modern age is the tree-lined boulevard Corso Garibaldi; the main thoroughfare running through the city which is where you'll find the majority of shops and people in general. At the end of Corso Garibaldi you reach the sea and it is here that the city's history starts to unfold.\n\nWhen you reach the water's edge, turn left and you join the Lungomare Regina Margherita (Queen Margaret's Promenade). The promenade itself has had a modern makeover with wide walkways flanked by palm trees and some smart street lighting creating a harmonious atmosphere. To the right of the promenade, ships roll in and out of port, bound for distant pastures or bringing home booty from far flung lands, while to the left lies the centro storico, the historic centre. ​\n\nBrindisi's famous staircase and Roman monument\n\nAs you arc your way around the promenade you eventually reach the Scalinata Virgiliana, a beautiful staircase that leads up to a Roman Column. At one time there were two columns here, the pair of them known as Le Colonne Romane (the plural form of \"The Roman Columns\"), but in 1666, one of the columns was gifted to the city of Lecce by way of thanks for Lecce's Saint Oronzo being deemed as responsible for saving Brindisi from the plague. Saint Oronzo was just regular old Bishop Oronzo when he was axed to death just outside Lecce on the orders of Emperor Nero in 68 AD.\n\n​Quite how he managed to save Brindisi from the plague some 600 years after his death is a source of intrigue, but what do I know? The people of nearby Ostuni feel the same way about Saint Oronzo so maybe there's something in it after all. Anyway, I digress, but for anyone who wants to venerate Saint Oronzo just get yourselves over to Piazza Sant'Oronzo in Lecce to see his column, it's no longer here in Brindisi.\n\nBrindisi Cathedral\n\nFrom the top of the Scalinata Virgiliana, with the now lonely, single column behind you, it's possible to follow a trail inland and towards perhaps the most spectacular sight in the city. First you see its campanile (bell tower) and on arrival in Piazza Duomo, Brindisi Cathedral itself. The Cathedral was originally built in the 12th century but extensively rebuilt after the earthquake of 1743. It has however survived several subsequent tremors and remains the most attractive building in the city. ​\n\nAround Piazza Santa Teresa and the Castle\n\nA side street runs down from Piazza Duomo back towards the Lungomare where you can continue to circumnavigate the centro storico. Continue to arc around in the same direction as before and you reach the attractive Piazza Santa Teresa. From here you can gaze out to sea or explore the eponymous church (Chiesa di Santa Teresa) that stands to one side of the square.\n\nTo the left of Piazza Santa Teresa lies the main area of Brindisi's port; the sense of history is tangible here among the narrow streets with the upturned wooden fishing boats lying next to the large metal ships and sea-faring folk busily going about their business. Enclosed within the port, the city's castle (Castello Svevo), proudly soars above all the other buildings although it's best glimpsed at a distance, from the marina across the water.\n\nComune di Brindisi\n\nBrindisi Travel\n\nBrindisi's train station is located just a stone's throw from the city centre, a 5 minute walk (350 metres) from Piazza Cairoli, the main square in the modern area of the city which eventually leads down to Corso Garibaldi. Trains from Brindisi head north along the Adriatic Coast to Bari in an hour and 23 minutes with notable stops along the way at Ostuni (24 mins), Cisternino (32 mins), Monopoli (47 mins) and Polignano a Mare (53 mins). South of Brindisi the trains turn inland and reach Lecce in 30 minutes.\n\nBrindisi Salento Airport is just an 8 minute drive from the city (4 km), while the next best option is Bari Karol Wojtyla Airport, an hour and 25 minutes away by car (129 km).\n\nIn terms of places to see close to Brindisi, there are some particular treats inland. Just to the north of Brindisi lies Puglia's \"Città Bianca\" (White City), the hill town of Ostuni. Then just beyond Ostuni lies the Valle d'Itria where you'll find the countryside dotted with the conical houses known as trulli, the icons of Puglia. Towns to visit around the Valle d'Itria include Cisternino, Locorotondo and Martina Franca but the most important of all is the incomparable Alberobello, the epicentre of the trulli tradition. ​\n\n​Brindisi Gallery"
