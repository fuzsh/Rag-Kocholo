        "text": "When you think of traveling to Italy, you most likely will consider Florence, Rome, and Venice. However, this summer, we traveled to Southern Italy and spent time in several small cities like Brindisi. Although Brindisi is not at the top of any tourist destination, there are plenty of reasons you should give it a chance.\n\nSince Roman times, Brindisi has been an important port city known throughout history as the “Gateway to the East.” Perched along the edge of the Adriatic Sea, it’s one of the largest cities in the Puglia region and has one of the most active trading and transport ports in Italy.\n\nThroughout history, Brindisi has been ruled by various empires and kingdoms, including Ostrogoths, Lombards, and Kings of Sicily. During World War II, the city served as the capital of Italy, hosting King Victor Emmanuel III. Brindisi remains a strategic point on the eastern coast and the primary city of the Apulia region.\n\nOffering the Mediterranean climate, the city is a great place to spend your holiday relaxing on the beach, visiting historical sites, eating fresh seafood, and strolling the promenade under the moonlight.\n\nLet’s explore the best things to do in Brindisi:\n\nSIGHTSEEING\n\nTemple of San Giovanni al Sepolcro\n\nBuilt in the 11th century, the beautiful ancient Temple of San Giovanni al Sepolcro is a testimony of the close connection of the Brindisi people and the Holy Land during the Crusades. The exterior is worth examining as the finely carved motifs. Inside are murals telling the passage of men, pilgrims, and knights.\n\nHours: Tue. – Sun. 8:00 – 20:30\n\nAdmission: 3 EUR per adult.\n\nRoman Columns of Brindisi\n\nLocated near the port of the city is one remaining standing of two columns. During WWII, the Column was dismantled, fear of being bombed, but was partially restored later. The original top of the Column is in the Palazzo Granafei Nervegna Museum.\n\nThe Column rises over the port at 18.74 meters high. The upper element of the Column has an inscription of the city around the 9th century. However, much is unknown about the significance of the columns at the time.\n\nFrom the Roman columns is stairs that lead you to the promenade. During our visit, an art show was taking place with jewelry makers, painters, and photographers."
