Historically, the city has played an important role in trade and culture, due to its strategic position on the Italian Peninsula and its natural port on the Adriatic Sea. The city remains a major port for trade with Greece and the Middle East.",

        "text": "Modeled on a traditional Pugliese village, Borgo Egnazia combines all the bells and whistles of a luxury resort with a sense of place rooted in this idyllic region.\n\nItalian canyons are often outshone by coasts and cities, or wrongly dismissed as too tough to reach. But these natural wonders are easier to explore than you’d think, and well worth seeking out.\n\nBordered by olive trees and citrus groves, this Puglian paradise between Bari and Brindisi is the perfect place to do a whole lot of nothing.\n\nMade with two discs of buttery puff and stuffed with béchamel, mozzarella and just a touch of tomato, the rustico is generally eaten in Lecce and the Salento for breakfast or as an afternoon or late night snack.\n\nWhat happens in Italy if one of the family will not sign a progura for inheritance money to be divided\n\nI was hoping to get a book on Gravina in Puglia that has nice photographs and a bit of history and / or culture noted. But I can't seem to find anything online! Any recommendations? Thanks so much!\n\nHI! We are attending a wedding at MASSERIA LA MACINA in September of 2024. I am having a trouble finding acomadations for a family of 8. Thank you!"
