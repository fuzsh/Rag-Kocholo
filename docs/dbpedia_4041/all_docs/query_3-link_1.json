        "text": "Province of Italy\n\nProvince in Apulia, Italy\n\nThe province of Brindisi (Italian: provincia di Brindisi) is a province in the Apulia region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Brindisi. It has an area of 1,839 square kilometres (710 sq mi) and a total population of 401,652 (2013).[2]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Province of Brindisi is situated in southeastern Italy, extending for 1,839 square kilometres (710 sq mi), the second smallest province in the region after the Province of Barletta-Andria-Trani. It was established in 1927 from the ancient Terra d'Otranto.[3] With the Adriatic Sea to the east, it is bordered to the north by the Province of Bari, on the west by the Province of Taranto and to the south-east by the Province of Lecce. The northern, central and western parts are hilly with much woodland, with the Murgia hills of particular note,[4] while to the north-west, bordering on the provinces of Taranto and Bari, it is lower-lying, with the Itria Valley (Valle d'Itria). The maximum height reached within the province is 414 metres (1,358 ft) above sea level, near Selva di Fasano. The other peaks are slightly lower and are all located in the north-central area. The coastline in the province is 80.606 kilometres (50.086 mi) long, partly rocky, with many alternating stretches of sandy beaches, small harbours and bays.[5] To the south it is essentially flat and widely used for crops.\n\nThe province, according to the Geological Map of Italy, prepared by the Geological Survey of Italy, is composed of various types of land: in the central-southern area there is a predominance of dolomitic limestone (present generally in the inhabited zone from the plateau of the Murgia), small eluvial deposits, sand, clay, grey silted marshes (around Francavilla Fontana, Oria and San Donaci), chalk and limestone, including firm bioclastic limestone and chalky sandstone.[6] In the north-central part, particularly Bari and Mola, the limestone stems from the Late Cretaceous, and deposits of limestone and sandstone date back to the Pleistocene. There are no significant rivers, because of the karst terrain, but there are many springs that gush out producing little streams. As for waterways, the longest is the Canale Reale, which flows into the territory of Villa Castelli, bordering Francavilla Fontana, and flows into the Natural Reserve of Torre Guaceto.[7] Along the coast, in addition, there are numerous ponds and small freshwater lakes, fed by underground aquifers.\n\nDemography\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1861, the province had a total population of 114,790 which grew steadily until 2001 when there were 402,422 inhabitants.[8] It has been more or less static since 2002 when there were 401,534 inhabitants, rising to 403,163 in 2010 but falling again to 401,867 in 2011.[9] In 2010, only 7,437 foreigners (1.8% of the total) resided in the province.[10]\n\nMain comuni\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are 20 comuni (sg.: comune) in the province:\n\nCommune Inhabitants Brindisi 87,141 Fasano 39,711 Francavilla Fontana 36,349 Ostuni 31,197 Mesagne 26,845 San Vito dei Normanni 19,819 Ceglie Messapica 19,194 Carovigno 17,120 Oria 15,094 Latiano 14,513 San Pietro Vernotico 13,684 Cisternino 11,600 Villa Castelli 10,640 Torre Santa Susanna 10,601 San Pancrazio Salentino 10,289 Erchie 8,671 San Donaci 6,768 San Michele Salentino 6,372 Torchiarolo 5,419\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nSurrounded by vineyards, artichoke and olive groves,[11] the city of Brindisi is a major sailing port for the southern part of Italy. In modern times, the province has experienced a process of change in its economic structure, with a progressive decrease in the weight of industry and growth of the tertiary sector. A significant increase in tourism, due to a good infrastructure has been witnessed, as well as the growth of its artistic and culinary assets.[12]\n\nIn 2011, the principal sectors of activity in the province were commerce (30%), agriculture (27%) and construction (13%), together representing 70% of the economy. The number of enterprises rose to a peak of 38,435 in 2005 but thereafter fell to 37,304 in 2011. Of these, 8,453 were active in agriculture, mainly in crop production with small percentages in the areas of livestock, agricultural support and mixed farming.[13]\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom the beginning of the 1980s to the end of the 1990s the Port of Brindisi was the starting point for tourists who passed from Italy to Greece.[citation needed] Subsequently, the tourist demand became increasingly strong also in the rest of the province of Brindisi.[citation needed] Beaches include the Torre Guaceto and the Ostuni beaches. In addition to its beaches, Ostuni is noted for its citadel, city walls, cathedral, and numerous mansions and is one of the main tourist attractions in the province.[14] Another city noted for its tourism is Oria, which includes a 13th-century castle built by Frederick II, cathedral, and Jewish history.[15]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
