        "text": "Located in an area 6km north of the city, Brindisi Airport is the ideal gateway for travellers wishing to discover Salento, the beating heart of Puglia. Over two and a half million passengers pass through this airport every year, a strategic crossroads that allows you to reach other splendid Apulian towns such as Lecce, which is 40 km away, and Taranto, overlooking the opposite coast, located at just an hour's drive.\n\nFor those who want to visit the beauties of Brindisi, Salento Airport (this is the official name) is a precious resource that allows you to reach the city centre in a few minutes.\n\nFor those who choose to take a taxi, the journey time is around 10-15 minutes, depending on the traffic: there is no fixed rate and it is therefore better to ask in advance for the approximate cost of the ride.\n\nBrindisi airport is also the terminus of the STP bus which with a circular route connects the airport to the city centre (with numerous stops including Piazza Crispi, at the train station) and to the ferry boarding area for Greece and Albania. The cost of the ticket is â‚¬1.10 and there is a departure every half hour.\n\nRenting a car is an excellent option for those who want to visit the city and the wonderful places in its surroundings: the desks of the main Italian and international companies are located outside the arrivals area of Brindisi airport.\n\nFinally, the airport has a useful bicycle repair station equipped with all the necessary equipment, a truly useful service for those who like to plan their holidays on two wheels.\n\nInternal services at Brindisi airport\n\nBrindisi airport is small, but it houses some small shops and various refreshment areas, useful for travellers waiting for their flight and for those who want to take home the flavours of Puglia.\n\nA free WiFi service and banking services are available in the structure. The Sala Amica is available to passengers requiring special assistance. It is located in the departures area.\n\nFlights to Brindisi\n\nAir Dolomiti offers direct flights to/from Brindisi Airport:"
