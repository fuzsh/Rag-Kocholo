        "text": "Retire Early Lifestyle\n\nRetirement; like your parents, but way cooler\n\nTaking a Look around the\n\nCoastal Town of Brindisi, Italy\n\n(Pronounced BRIN-dee-see)\n\nBilly and Akaisha Kaderli\n\nCurrency Converter\n\nThe first time we visited Brindisi, Italy, we were coming from Lecce.\n\nWe were happy to be leaving the changeable and rather chilly weather of Lecce, and for $3.40Euros each we bought train tickets to this coastal town about a 25 minute ride away.\n\nOn our second visit to this beautiful place, we hit the weather just right - in the 70s and low 80s with a gentle breeze.\n\nNow that's more like it!\n\nCorso Roma\n\nIn Italy, a larger, main street is called a Corso. This particular palm-lined Corso had stately buildings, and bicycle and scooter parking.\n\nBrindisi is a very clean town, and this afternoon, not much traffic on the road.\n\nAnother area of the Corso\n\nWith the wide sidewalks, it was easy to window shop as we strolled about.\n\nThere are restaurants, cafes, gelaterias and various stores selling high-end goods.\n\nStately Ivory colored buildings\n\nSuch lovely cream and white buildings with ornate Baroque window sculpting.\n\nShutters and wrought iron balconies give them the finishing touch, and a street garden is below.\n\nWonderful, wonderful sunshine.\n\nModern-looking city building\n\nBrindisi has both old-style and contemporary buildings.\n\nIt is an attractive mix of the ancient with the vibrancy of the modern.\n\nRoman Columns at the end of the Appian Way\n\nThe impressive Roman road called the Appian way stretched 360 miles from Rome to Brindisi, the port city on the heel of Italy's \"boot.\"\n\nBecause of this road, the military could march quickly to distant battlefields, goods shipped to and from the harbor flowed freely and even ideas spread rapidly through the Roman Empire.\n\nThe end of the Appian Way was here where you see the two 62-foot columns.\n\nIn 1656, there was a devastating plague outbreak in Brindisi.\n\nThe city turned to Sant'Oronzo, the patron saint of nearby Lecce, for divine intervention. According to legend, Sant'Oronzo miraculously interceded and ended the plague.\n\nAs a gesture of immense gratitude, Brindisi decided to offer the 2nd column to Lecce as a symbolic token of their appreciation.\n\nIn 1660, the fallen column was transported 50 km from Brindisi to Lecce. The broken column base remains in Brindisi next to the standing one, serving as a constant reminder of the gift.\n\nView of the harbor\n\nIn the days of the Roman Empire, this harbor ferried passengers and cargo across the Adriatic Sea to Greece, Asia Minor, and beyond.\n\nThe Appian Way which ended here at the harbor itself, became a vital artery connecting Rome to the vast Roman Empire, and Brindisi thrived as a bustling port city and a crossroads of civilizations.\n\nNaval ship in the harbor\n\nThis military ship serves as a reminder that port cities are also vulnerable to invaders who might want to make that city their new home.\n\nAll up and down the coast of Italy deep sea ports have suffered attacks from foreign troops, sometimes having their cities ravaged and burned.\n\nMonument to sailors\n\nAcross this bay you will see a tall monument to the sailors who served in various wars. The building is representative of a ship's rudder, stands 54 meters tall and was built in 1933.\n\nFor a bit of pocket change, we were able to take a ferry ride across here, and take a look at the monument more closely.\n\nRoad signs - where would you like to go?\n\nThese road signs let you know where a couple of Palaces are, the New Community Theater, a Temple, a Church, Saint Peter's Quarter and an archaeological area.\n\nMother and son eating gelato\n\nOf course, since it is Italy, you will see gelato shops everywhere.\n\nThis young man and his mother are really enjoying theirs.\n\nA golden Vespa\n\nVespa motorbikes were created in 1946, and were designed as a practical solution for post-war transportation. But because of their sleek lines, they became a fashion statement right away.\n\nOver the years, Vespa has also collaborated with fashion designers and artists to create limited-edition models, further cementing its position as a cultural icon. Vintage Vespas are collector's items, and tourists fantasize about riding through the rolling hills of Italy on this sleek bike.\n\nColdwell Bank on the corner\n\nAlthough steeped in history, Brindisi has a thoroughly modern side as well.\n\nWith its upscale vibe, stylish shops and the many bank buildings, this clean town is very attractive to tourists and locals both.\n\nOutdoor restaurant on the Corso\n\nThis very handsome town offers plenty of places to eat a meal, have a cafe or a happy hour.\n\nAs with much of Europe, Italy has a cafe society and people stroll around meeting friends, saying hello, and people-watching.\n\nHotels in the center of town\n\nIt's a beautiful day in Brindisi, and we are walking the Corso Roma and side streets.\n\nHere you see a sign to Hotel Barsotti, and the face of another hotel right in the center of the photo.\n\nAnchor fountain\n\nThis fountain in the shape of a ship's anchor is in the center of this piazza. Our apartment wasn't far from here and there were several grocery shops, bakeries, fresh markets and salumerias in this area.\n\nOur apartment's location made it very easy for us on a daily basis to get supplies.\n\nLooking beyond the fountain are several apartment complexes.\n\nHappy Hour with snacks\n\nFurther down the Corso we found this place to enjoy Happy Hour.\n\nIn Italy little snacks are served, as you can see here. Sometimes they are included with your drink, and other times one must order them and pay a nominal price like $3Euros.\n\nOn our table we have these little pretzel breads, peanuts and delicious Italian green olives.\n\nGlasses of wine were often $4-$5Euros each.\n\nA side via with Italian flags\n\nAs you can see on this side via is another wine shop with barrel tables.\n\nStreams of Italian flags are strung between the buildings crossing over the via, making for a festive place to walk or sit and have a wine.\n\nLovely apartments\n\nAren't these cornflower blue painted apartments stylish?\n\nEach with a veranda one can sit and enjoy the goings on below.\n\nAlthough Brindisi is a city, we did not notice the intrusive, blaring sounds that most cities produce. It seemed far more civilized and graceful.\n\nStatue of Roman Emperor Caesar\n\nThe man himself.\n\nApparently in 49BC, Julius Caesar faced political pressure in Rome and marched south with his troops to Brindisi. His aim was to cross over to Greece and pursue his rival, Pompey.\n\nHowever, Caesar found a limited number of ships available, delaying his departure and allowing Pompey to escape with most of his forces.\n\nUltimately, Caesar won the Civil War and helped stabilized this region. Trade routes reopened and Brindisi (known then as Brundisium) benefitted economically.\n\nIn visiting Brindisi, it's like walking through several layers of history all at once. You have the Roman influence, the Medieval impact, the effects and monuments of the various World Wars, and modern times as well.\n\nIf you get to this area, make a point to visit this historic, classy city.\n\nRetire Early Lifestyle appeals to a different kind of person  the person who prizes their independence, values their time, and who doesnt want to mindlessly follow the crowd.\n\nHOME Book Store\n\nRetire Early Lifestyle Blog About Billy & Akaisha Kaderli Press Contact 20 Questions Preferred Links"
