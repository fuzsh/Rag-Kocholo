        "text": "This paper is a modest attempt of debating with some fundamental premises of Eugenio Barba that he placed in his much applauded publication around the globe, jointly written with Nicola Savarese. Published in 1991, the book had created a cult-like influence across the disciplines, mostly among the practitioners and experts of performing art. Though the Italian authors have urged their readers not to confuse this work and their activities as a branch of anthropology, the premises contained significant elements of serious academic concernsculture, history, bodies, performances and a few more. Considering the huge readership this book achieved, with a number of translations in different languages, this article concerned with its conceptualization of a few fundamental issues and placed them in the complex plane of colonialism and transformative forces in cultural forms and expressions. This paper does not, by any means, engage with the ISTA activities, instead it explores possibilities of a dialogue with some propositions that otherwise could have read as static, ahistorical, apolitical and inclined with more dogmatic sense of what is called 'aesthetics'.\n\nThe article examines some of Eugenio Barba’s study material now preserved in the Fonds Barba at Odin Teatret Archives (ISTA Series, b. 1). Barba’s readings preceding the first edition of the ISTA in Bonn in 1980 trace the development of interests cultivated by the director, from humanities to science (biology, neuropsychology, studies of perception, posturology). Even before developing the theory of theatre anthropology as an autonomous discipline, Barba evolved many fertile perspectives of study on energy, within which he expanded the understanding of presence as a fundamental component of theatre. Barba’s reading notes reveal an intellectual approach similar to his artistic work: the accumulation of an overabundance of material, which in the theoretical sphere, too, invert the principle of maximum results with minimum effort. https://jta.ista-online.org/article/view/11\n\nThis article is based on the broad network of interests established by Eugenio Barba in the first decade of ISTA with the world of science: a fertile, lively relationship with figures inside and outside the world of theatre. With the contribution of archival documents preserved in the Odin Teatret Archives, the article focuses on certain artistic and intellectual episodes that exemplify the relational dialectics of interpenetration, exercised in two opposing tensions (one of approach outwards, the other of attraction inwards), implemented by Barba in a vast knowledge-seeking project, unprecedented in the history of the theatre. It was also based on these premises that Barba promoted the concept of theatre anthropology as a plural, interdisciplinary and intercultural living discipline: a discipline founded on the study of human beings and the history of cultures, combining a purely humanistic approach with new research from the so-called hard sciences. The impact and wide range of interaction of theatre anthropology as a new subject in the field of knowledge subsequently gave rise, over following decades, to ample literature hosting a lively and constructive debate.\n\nThe paper focuses on the solo-performance \"An Ordinary Day of the Dancer Gregorio Samsa\" created by Eugenio Barba, Julia Varley and Lorenzo Gleijeses and performed since 2016. The pièce, which sees Gleijeses on stage as a solo performer, has followed an intense process of development over five years, through numerous rewriting processes. Partially inspired by Kafka’s \"Metamorphosis\", the performance deals with the difficult relationship between a young artist and his main reference figures (a demanding father, an authoritarian theatre director, a worried partner, a schematic psychologist). On stage, the actor’s score develops around an obsessive repetition of movements and actions, performed with modulation of intensity and rhythm. From the circularity of the theatrical repetitions, however, the work of the actor creates a more linear, perhaps vertical, path, which aims at self-purification through exhausting effort, at the precision of craftsmanship, and which, in the finale, questions the possibility of transcendence in the incompleteness of the artistic creation. The inexhaustible and essential search for a performative work based on the organic nature of the actor-dancer, explored as the quintessence of human existence, is therefore both a ‘condemnation’ and a possibility of elevation offered by the theatre performance. Sorrounded by a refined lighting and sound apparatus, the actor-dancer acts in a multi-sensorial context within which a new poetics of space unravels. Reflecting upon these elements, the paper intends to offer a reconstruction of the genesis and creative process of the performance, also comparing it with some of Barba’s previous works and theatrical thought."
