Brindisi has been a port city for thousands of years. There is evidence of this from Roman times as it was one of the most important trading cities in the Mediterranean for commercial reasons, such as oil and wine. Wine production in this region was most sought after during those times, and people all over the Roman Empire would enjoy it. The most recent study on the wines found in the cellar of Herod's Palace, found that those at Brindisi were of best quality.\n\nTerrior of Brindisi\n\nBrindisi is a maritime city and the soil type reflects that. Most of the soils here are made up of limestone and marine sands. They lie on this heavy layer of clay deposits from the Pleistocene-era. Close to the Adriatic Ocean, Brindisi's climate is hot and dry despite being right next to the seacoast. Alcohol content and sugar levels are typically higher for wines made from these grapes. As regulations allow for a maximum 10g/L residual sugar across most red and white wines produced here, taste is usually high alcohol or fruity with some added sweetness.\n\nBrindisi Wine Characteristics\n\nThe Brindisi region is famous for its wine and the quality seen in recent years has encouraged the winemakers from this area to start using it as a distinguishing mark. Brindisi wines are typically red, robust and tannic with deep fruit flavours. It has a striking, persistent winey aroma and is mellow, velvety and slightly acidic on the palate. This wine pairs nicely with pastas. In contrast, the regulations also stipulate that a red Brindisi Riserva must be aged for a minimum of two years. The main grape variety in Brindisi wines is Negroamaro. It's a tannic and late-ripening workhorse of southern Italian red wine grapes, which must be accompanied by up to 30% Malvasia Nera and up to 10% Sangiovese under DOC laws.\n\nFood to pair with Brindisi Wine\n\n1. Cozze alla Tarantina\n\nCozze alla Tarantina are delicious seafood appetizers with delicate, meaty mussels served in a spicy crude tomato sauce and should be made as fresh as possible. The tomato sauce is typically flavored with garlic and parsley and chiles. We recommend serving this dish with toasted bread or croutons, which can be used to mop up all of the tasty juices. Cozze alla Tarantina make a perfect match with Brindisi wines.\n\n2. Cozze ripiene\n\nCozze ripiene is a classic Italian dish consisting of stuffed mussels. It can be served either baked or steamed and the sauce is made from the liquid from cooking the mussels. The breaded cheese is delicious, it's tied up and then simmered in the tomatoe sauce. Enjoy this dish with Brindisi wines.\n\n3. Panzerotti\n\nThe classic panzerotto filling is simply tomatoes and mozzarella, but they can be filled with pretty much anything in many combinations like proscuitto-mozzarella, pepperoni-provolone, spinach-ricotta, zucchini-mozzarella and onion-olives. Apart from salty versions of the dessert, there are also panzerotti filled with various fruits such as apples, pears, plums, oranges, cherries and strawberries. Ricotta cream is typically used along with chocolate or custard cream. Brindisi wines go well with both variations of this dish!\n\nPlaces to visit near Brindisi\n\n1.
