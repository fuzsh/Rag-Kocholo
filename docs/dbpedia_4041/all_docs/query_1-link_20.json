        "text": "Eugenio Barba (Odin Teatret)\n\nEugenio Barba was born in 1936 in Italy and emigrated to Norway in 1954. He founded Odin Teatret in 1964, an avant-garde theatre group based in Denmark. During the past fifty-six years, Eugenio has directed 79 productions with Odin Teatret and with the intercultural Theatrum Mundi Ensemble. Since 1974, the group has devised their own way of being present in diverse social contexts through the practice of the \"barter\", an exchange of cultural expressions with a community or an institution, structured as a common performance. In 1979, Eugenio Barba founded ISTA, International School of Theatre Anthropology thus opening a new field of studies: Theatre Anthropology.\n\nHe has been awarded honorary doctorates by the Universities of Aarhus, Ayacucho, Bologna, Havana, Warsaw, Plymouth, Hong Kong, Buenos Aires, Tallin, Cluj, Edinburgh, Shanghai, Brno and Peloponnese as well as the Reconnaissance de mérite scientifique by the University of Montreal and the Sonning Prize by the University of Copenhagen.\n\nJulia Varley (Odin Teatret)\n\nJulia Varley joined Odin Teatret in 1976 in Denmark as an actress in ensemble, solo, indoor, and street productions, all directed by Eugenio Barba. Julia Varley’s main activity is still today as an Odin Teatret actress. Since 1978, Julia Varley teaches in schools and universities, gives workshops, and follows theatre groups and artists all over the world. Since 1983, Julia Varley has participated in the conception and organisation of The Magdalena Project, a network of women in contemporary theatre. She is the artistic director of Transit International Festival, Holstebro, dedicated to themes of interest for women working in theatre.

She is also the editor of The Open Page, a journal devoted to women's work in theatre.\n\nSince 1990, Julia Varley has been involved in the conception and organisation of ISTA. In 2019 Julia Varley became artistic coordinator of Nordisk Teaterlaboratorium-Odin Teatret (NTL) organising its annual festival each January.\n\nSimon Stollery (ITI) — Voice & Text\n\nSimon is a vocational trainer of actors in the field of Voice and Speech with more than 2​0​ years of experience.
