        "text": "Jerzy Grotowski, who has died aged 65, was without doubt one of the great innovators and seminal influences of the modern theatre, on the scale of Stanislavsky, Gordon Craig, Artaud or Appia, an eccentric genius who managed to emerge from the restrictive world behind the Iron Curtain into the full glare of world fame.\n\nBorn in Rzeszow, eastern Poland, he studied acting and directing at the Cracow Theatre School. In 1959 he started his own experimental theatre in Opole; believing in the need to bring the play as near to the audience as possible, he called it the Theatre of 13 Rows, later the Theatre Laboratory. His talent was recognised by the authorities, and he was sent to Moscow to study. When asked where else he wanted to study abroad, he named Paris, but the West was forbidden territory, so he was sent to China instead. And, as he told me once, instead of teaching him Marxism, China revealed Taoism to him and made him a mystic.\n\nIn 1965 the 'Teatr Laboratorium' was transferred to the larger city of Wroclaw and accorded the status of an Institute for Research into Acting. By this time Grotowski's fame had spread. A film of his production of Marlowe's Dr Faustus, in which the audience sat around a large table where Faustus awaited the devil to take him to hell, and the play unrolled in flashback on top of the table transformed into the stage, had been seen in London.\n\nWhen I visited him in Wroclaw I found a mysterious young man, meticulously dressed in a blue suit, with dark glasses, so private a person that even the administrator of his theatre did not know where he lived. He trained his actors both physically and mentally to the very limits. If the part required a salto mortale backwards, the actor must simply be able to do it, he told me.\n\nAt this time his ideas were focused on the insight that, since the Greeks, the deepest emotions in tragedy had been created by the breaking of taboos (e.g. the incest-taboo in Oedipus). In our time the only really effective taboo left was that of the inviolability of the individual's intimate sphere. Hence the actor's intensity had to be brought to such a pitch in the closest proximity to the spectator that he too felt that violation directly. On the night in question I was told that the perfomance of Calderon's The Constant Prince had been cancelled, because the actor Richard Cieslak had been warned that if he did another perfomance of the part it would kill him.\n\nFrequent touring and the publication of his book Towards a Poor Theatre (1968) made Grotowski famous in the West; he spent more and more time abroad, based in Italy, until in the Eighties he took up teaching positions in the United States, at Columbia University and later at the University of California in Irvine, where a group of actors was put at his disposal to explore his ideas that had become far more radical: he now sought to find a form of performance, beyond the limits of the existing theatre, in which acting - or rather action - would no longer merely be symbolic, mere pretending, but full reality. He illustrated this by pointing out: \"In the Russian Orthodox Mass the believer has to kneel and touch the floor with his forehead. That gesture does not merely symbolise humility, it actually produces the emotion of humility.\" He wanted to develop a full grammar of such gestures - by studying the rituals of the world's religions. At the end of this endeavour, clearly, there would have been not theatre, but a collective emotional experience in which the spectators became their own actors.\n\nWhen the seven years' grant at Irvine came to an end, Grotowski moved his research to Pontedera in Italy. He had shed his former dapper image and now appeared in an open shirt, without dark glasses, and with a long wispy white beard.\n\nDirectly and, above all, indirectly, Grotowski's influence has been enormous, and great directors like Peter Brook or Eugenio Barba readily acknowledge it. His total dedication, his saint-like integrity, and his quixotic striving for an unattainable ideal created a personality of unique charisma and lasting importance."
