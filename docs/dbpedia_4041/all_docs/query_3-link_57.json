        "text": "Brindisi, the “Gateway to the East”, attracts travelers (but never too many) with its rich history, lively culture, and stunning coastal setting. Situated on the Adriatic Sea and with a very convenient airport this fascinating city offers a unique blend of ancient wonders, unique dishes, and captivating landscapes.\n\nImmerse Yourself in Brindisi’s History\n\nExplore the port of Brindisi: witness the city’s long-standing maritime importance. Stroll along the seafront, admiring the imposing 15th-century Aragonese Castle also known as the Castello a Mare and immerse yourself in the panorama of floating boats and historical monuments.\n\nThe Swabian Castle is an imposing fortress built in the 13th century by Frederick II to defend the city. Its courtyard is enclosed by a wall with a keep and six towers. Another wall with its circular towers surrounds the fortress and dates back to the 15th century.\n\nImmerse yourself in Roman and medieval treasures: visit the Cathedral of Brindisi, also called the Basilica of the Visitation, dating back to the 11th century which still retains fragments of the original floor and precious mosaics.\n\nRoman Columns\n\nThe Roman columns are the true symbol of Brindisi which until 1500 marked the Via Appia that connected Rome to Brindisi. Nowadays what remains of the columns is located near the Scalinata Virgilio, the grand staircase and another unmissable stop that connects the historic center to the port.\n\nArcheology\n\nIf you are passionate about archeology and Roman history, then don’t miss out on a visit to San Pietro degli Schiavoni, a Roman-era neighborhood once populated by the “Schiavoni” from the Balkans. The remains were discovered by chance in the 1960s when initially a medieval layer was uncovered and then subsequently Roman.\n\nStaying on the archaeological theme, another must-visit is the Provincial Archaeological Museum in Piazza Duomo where you can see all kinds of artifacts excavated in the region dating from prehistory to Roman times.\n\nThe Sea and More\n\nRelax on Brindisi’s pristine beaches: escape the hustle and bustle of the city and relax on the sandy shores of Hemingway Beach and Punta Penna. The Torre Guaceto Nature Reserve is definitely worth a visit just 20 km away; and earning the Blue Flag Award in 2023, is the coast of Fasano which extends for 20 km; and the beaches in the municipalities of Ostuni and Carovigno.\n\nExplore natural beauty: the Torre Guaceto Nature Reserve is not just about a stunning sea, but is a full-circle paradise for nature lovers. Take an excursion on foot or by bike among the olive groves, hidden bays, and dunes, or simply relax in a beautiful natural landscape.\n\nIn the Area\n\nBrindisi is a perfect starting point for exploring Puglia! In fact, from Brindisi, in just one day you can discover other fascinating and renowned villages and cities such as Ostuni, the “white city”; the trulli houses of Alberobello; and Lecce, the “Florence of the South”.\n\nIf you’re feeling adventurous, Brindisi offers ferry connections to neighboring countries such as Albania and Greece, allowing you to extend your travels and explore new destinations.\n\nAuthentic Flavors of Puglia\n\nSavor the magic of Puglia in its dishes: Brindisi boasts a culinary scene rich in fresh fish, local cheeses, and olive oil, a true marriage of land and sea just like the region itself. Famous first courses made with fresh durum wheat pasta such as orecchiette are an absolute must! Try them topped with tomato sauce or cacio and ricotta cheese. Legumes are also very popular, especially chickpeas and broad beans, often served with chicory; and finally, perhaps the dish that represents the area most of all, the taiedda (pan) of rice, potatoes, and mussels. Don’t miss the renowned wines of the region such as Primitivo and Negroamaro.\n\nBrindisi, like all of Puglia, awaits you with open arms, ready to reveal its hidden treasures."
