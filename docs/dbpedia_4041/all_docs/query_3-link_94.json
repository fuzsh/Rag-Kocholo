        "text": "Most of those who come to Puglia will know that this part of Italy has a variety of things to offer its visitors; with each town providing an opportunity to explore and see something new. There are so many different parts of Apulia that we’re sure you’ll want to check out; one of which is the city of Brindisi.\n\nHome to one of the region’s two primary airports, most tourists will actually see at least part of Brindisi, although most don’t spend enough time here to properly take in the beauty and everything else that it has to offer.\n\nBrindisi is an excellent place to explore, and whether you want to learn more about the city’s history, have a Puglian adventure, or spend a few hours relaxing by the beach; you’re bound to find something here that interests you. To make the most out of your time away, you might want to consider taking a closer look at some of the many itineraries our team here at Travel Puglia have compiled – especially if you’re planning on visiting Puglia next year.\n\nWhat does Brindisi have to offer?\n\nMany people don’t stay in Brindisi for too long during their vacation in Apulia, and unfortunately these individuals really are missing out. One of many things that makes this hotspot interesting is the port, which was historically important to how the region of Puglia developed, due to strategic positioning. It was also prominent for its role in helping to build and sustain the growing economy, as trades were sent and received from other nations of the Adriatic Sea.\n\nBrindisi is a coastal city, home to Puglia’s best known port and harbor – and even then, these are just two things that make this area worth a visit. You may also want to see some of the amazing sites here, relax at one of the many beaches, and much more. Italian getaways here in this part of Apulia are simply so magnificent that this destination shouldn’t be overlooked!\n\nSo, with all this in mind, will you be booking a vacation to Puglia in 2021? If so, you’ll likely want to:\n\nImmerse yourself in Brindisi’s rich history\n\nMyths of the ancient Greek hero Diomedes tell that this legend (who is known for many exploits, as well as being a leader of the Trojan War) founded the city. Despite this, there are records that prove that there were already settlements in Brindisi, dating back to a time before the ancient Greeks and Romans had even spread their wings.\n\nMany empires and kingdoms have had ownership over Brindisi over its long history, mostly due to its position by the sea. It was also the temporary capital of the country during WWII.\n\nIf you want to immerse yourself in the past, be sure to visit the old town here. Or, if you’re more interested in seeing some of the ancient treasures that have been collected locally over the years, you may want to take the time to check out the Brindisi Archeological Museum.\n\nThis site is home to many relics, displays, and artifacts from the area; predominantly the port, harbor, and surrounding sea. Because of this, the museum is often the perfect place to go for those who are interested in getting a closer look at the region’s unique past and how it has impacted both modern living and tradition.\n\nRelax on one of Brindisi’s beaches\n\nPuglia is known for a few things; one of which is the many beaches that are on offer here. It’s no secret that the coastal region of Apulia has a variety of wonderful sandy destinations, so you simply can’t pass up the opportunity to relax on at least a couple during your stay. Brindisi alone has several great beaches, ideal for those staying in the area. A few that you’re certain to want to check out include:\n\nGuna Beach (a popular luxury beach with gazeboes, Wi-FI, and much more)\n\nLido Azzuro (perfect for those who want a quiet place to relax away from the often busy city)\n\nTorre Santa Sabina (quiet, clear waters and soft, clean sand make this beach quite popular among tourists)\n\nThere are many more to be enjoyed in the nearby towns too, so be sure to take the time to visit Ostuni and Savelletri – both of which are locations with amazing beaches that will make a great addition to any vacation’s itinerary. With so many hotspots like these dotted around, it’s not hard to see why so many people choose to relax on Puglia’s soft sands whenever they stop by.\n\nSee some of the amazing landmarks in Brindisi\n\nThe city itself is home to a variety of incredible sites, so you’ll definitely want to take some time to explore Brindisi and see some of the many fantastic landmarks that are located here.\n\nAs mentioned above, Brindisi is best known for its port, so we’re certain that you’ll want to check it out at some point during your stay. It’s a great place to have a relaxing stroll and take in the beautiful views, so if you need a break from the hustle and bustle, or even the excitement of your trip, this is the ideal place to do just that. Why not take a walk up to the Via del Mare while you’re at it – it’s considered to have some of the best sights in the area.\n\nOne of many landmarks in the city is Castello Alfonsino di Brindisi. This historic castle is often overshadowed by Puglia’s many other landmarks, but there are quite a few reasons why you’ll want to see this one for yourself. From the many different parts of it to explore (including the stunning workmanship that went into the construction, its towers, and even the walkways), to the awesome views from the fortress’ battlements; there’s a lot to love about Castello Alfonsino di Brindisi.\n\nIf you do choose to take a trip to the region, you’re likely to find that there are many, many more incredible sites and pieces of traditional architecture for you to check out.\n\nWhy come on one of our tours of Puglia?\n\nHere at Travel Puglia, we aim to offer our guests the very best chance to experience all the wonders that this destination has to offer for an affordable cost – which is why anyone considering spending their vacations in Puglia should take a closer look at what we have to offer.\n\nWe have a variety of tour options to choose from, so whether you are interested in hiking in Puglia, or visiting some amazing Puglian vineyards and wineries, you can be certain that we’ve got something for you.\n\nThis is just one of the reasons why we’re so popular.
