The LyondellBasell facilities cover about 45 hectares of the complex. Our Brindisi facilities produce polypropylene resins through the company's Spheripol and Spherizone technologies. The homopolymer resins produced by our Spheripol process are used primarily for packaging applications. Our Spherizone line, the first commercial line of its type in the world, produces resins used in the manufacture of piping, construction materials automotive products and household products.\n\nPerformance Summary\n\nOur commitment to sustainable growth balances our responsibility to provide economic value for our stakeholders, while respecting the social concerns of the community in which we operate, and demonstrating care for the environment around us."
