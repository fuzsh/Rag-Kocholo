From its origins in the mists of prehistory to its pivotal role in global conflicts, Brindisi’s narrative is as compelling as the turquoise waters that embrace its shores.\n\nThe Dawn of Brindisi\n\nEchoes of the Messapians\n\nBefore Rome’s legions marched across the globe, the Messapians laid the foundations of Brindisi, forging a settlement that capitalized on its natural harbor. These early inhabitants, enigmatic and fierce, left behind traces of a civilization that thrived on the edge of the ancient world.\n\nThe Roman Gateway\n\nWhere Empires Converged\n\nThe arrival of Roman dominion transformed Brindisi into a crucial maritime gateway. Here, the Appian Way found its terminus, a port from which legions and grain ships sailed to the far reaches of the empire. The Roman Column, standing vigil over the Adriatic, remains a silent herald of Brindisi’s once-grand stature in the Roman world.\n\nByzantine Bastion\n\nA City Reborn under Eastern Stars\n\nAs the Western Empire faded, Brindisi found new life under the Byzantine flag. This era imbued the city with a wealth of art and architecture, leaving a legacy of Byzantine splendor amidst the city’s Roman roots.\n\nThe Medieval Melting Pot\n\nCrossroads of Crusaders\n\nThe Middle Ages saw Brindisi evolve into a bustling hub for Crusaders bound for the Holy Land. Its ports teemed with knights and pilgrims, each leaving their mark on the city’s cultural and architectural heritage, enriching it with stories of faith and valor.\n\nThe Renaissance Reawakening\n\nA Flourish of Art and Trade\n\nThe winds of the Renaissance brought a fresh breath of cultural and economic vitality to Brindisi. The city, under the influence of Aragonese and Angevin rulers, began to shimmer with new constructions, each a piece of the puzzle in Brindisi’s complex history.\n\nA Witness to Modernity\n\nIn the Tides of World Wars\n\nBrindisi’s strategic importance did not wane with the ages. World War II cast the city into the role of a crucial Allied naval base, a chapter of bravery and resilience in the face of global turmoil.\n\nAs you wander through Brindisi’s ancient streets, past its Roman ruins, and along its bustling harbor, you’re walking through chapters of history.\n\nBrindisi Top Attractions and Best Places to Visit in Italy\n\nIn Roman times, Brindisi was literally the end of the road. After travelling almost 600 kilometres from Rome (a massive distance in the ancient world), you’d end up here. To this day, the pillar the marked the end of the Appian Way sits in the core of this city.\n\nAnd yet, this place is often passed over by many foreign tourists. With amazing churches, museums, and Roman remnants, make time for it in your Italian travels.\n\nBegin your time in Brindisi by visiting Tempio di San Giovanni al Sepolcro. This Romanesque beauty opened its doors for the first time in the 11th century, when the Normans controlled Southern Italy. Like many churches of that age, it contains richly decorated walls and columns.\n\nOf all its highlights, though, its frescoes take the cake. Despite their faded appearance, they largely retain the rich detail that existed when their painters completed them. To get in, you must pay an admission fee of at least 3 EUR. However, this price is a bargain given all that is here.\n\nMore Attractions\n\nNext, make your way to another church is Brindisi – Chiesa Santa Maria del Casale. Finished in the 14th century, it boasts a mix of Romanesque and Gothic design elements. These can be seen in its facade columns, and in its abundant frescoes.\n\nThanks to its location adjacent to the Brindisi Airport, it’s a great place to see on your way out. However, learn as much as you can before going, as all displays within are in Italian.\n\nLearn more about the ancient past of Brindisi by spending a couple of hours at Museo Archeologico Provinciale Francesco Ribezzo. The institution, which takes its name from a famed Italian archaeologist and linguist, covers the history of the area.\n\nFrom prehistory to the Roman era to more recent periods, this attraction is thorough in detail. From pottery to statues, you’ll have plenty to look at during your visit.\n\nBefore departing Brindisi, check out Palazzo Granafei Nervegna. Originally a Renaissance-era palace, today it serves as the tourist office for the region. After checking out the ruins of a Roman-era residence, have a coffee and cake in their cafe.\n\nOther Cultural Attractions: Trip to Brindisi, Italy\n\nCheck out more Roman remnants by heading to the Roman Column of Brindisi. Standing at the top of a set of stairs in the city centre, it once marked the end of the Appian Way.\n\nDating to the 2nd century BC, it ran more than 580 kilometres northwestward to Rome. By building this road, the Romans were able to better mobilize their army, allowing them to tighten their grip on the Italian peninsula. Want to learn more? Check out a small museum nearby – it’s free!\n\nIf you visit Brindisi during the summer, you’ll be contending with brutal heat throughout your stay. So, we strongly recommend spending at least one of your days at the beach. Of the ones in the area, Oktàgona Beach is among the most popular among locals.\n\nOther Attractions\n\nBut be warned – this beach is not free. Admission is charged for access, and sunbeds cost extra. But you’ll still have access to a private beach, and the on-site restaurant serves up some amazing dishes. However, if you’re seeking a quiet beach, this place won’t be suitable, as music plays until close.\n\nWhat if you’re not into beaches? In this case, perhaps a trip to a local vineyard like Tenute Rubino would be better. Here, they’ll take you through their fields and cellar, all while teaching you about the local varietals.\n\nTours are available in English – a point in their favour, as this part of Italy sits under the foreign tourism radar. Afterward, have dinner at their restaurant, and as you do so, try out the pairings they recommend.\n\nSpend your final evening in Brindisi strolling along the Lungomare Regina Margherita. This oceanside promenade takes you along the port, and because of this, you’ll find many locals down here in the evening.\n\nsource: Top Tourist Places on YouTube\n\nTop 20 Things To Do in Brindisi, Italy For Visitors\n\nHere are the top 20 things to do in Brindisi, ensuring a rich experience for travelers.\n\n1.
