        "text": "60 Days of Italy – Brindisi\n\nItaly Day 54: Brindisi day trip from Lecce!\n\nBrindisi was both a short trip and a short day. Only a 30 minute train ride from Lecce and even though we had plans to explore more after our walking tour, it started to rain and with that came the thunder and lightening so we ate hoping to wait out the rain. But when it didn’t stop, we hopped an early train back to Lecce.\n\nAlthough we were prepared, with our rain gear, the rain turned out to be quite the pour down.\n\nAnyway, here’s a tiny glimpse of Brindisi."
