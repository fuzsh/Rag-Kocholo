        "text": "People traveling to Puglia rarely stop and visit Brindisi. However, this lesser-known city is well worth spending a day or two.\n\nEven for Italians, when thinking about the Puglia region, Brindisi is not the first destination that comes to mind. For many, it is just the embarkation point to Greece or the arrival airport. But I discovered that the city is indeed well worth spending a few days in. And there are plenty of things to do in Brindisi and around.\n\nWhether you’re traveling to Italy for the first time, or are a returning visitor, find out my 7 reasons to visit Brindisi and the surrounding area.\n\n1. The old town\n\nIn Brindisi, you can see ancient palaces, a beautiful cathedral, narrow alleys, and old houses full of charm.\n\nThe best way to explore Brindisi old town is by getting lost in the maze of charming alleys. After all, the center is quite small, so you’re likely to come back to the starting point sooner or later. Indeed, missing Brindisi cathedral and the beautiful Palazzo Arcivescovile (the Archbishop’s Palace) overlooking the square is almost impossible. It’s the heart of the city, there are many signs and whoever you ask will show you the right way.\n\nThe cathedral dates back to the 11th century, although it was severely damaged during the 1743 earthquake. However, inside, you can still see a portion of the late 12th-century mosaics decorating the floor and the wooden choir created by local carvers at the end of the 16th century.\n\nArt lovers should visit the Archaeological Museum in the cathedral square (Piazza del Duomo). It stores all the archaeological finds discovered in the area, including magnificent sculptures and bronze statues.\n\nFinding the superb Church of San Giovanni al Sepolcro can be a little more tricky, as it is a bit hidden in a small alley near the Cathedral. I confess that I stumbled across it totally by chance and couldn’t be happier. It is a must-see when you visit Brindisi. Therefore, ask the hotel where you’re staying for a map, marking for you the exact point where the church stands. Spend a few minutes outside, admiring the finely carved old capitals, and then move inside, where you’ll see a beautiful example of Romanesque style in this beautiful round-shaped small church.\n\nAnother must-see is the Roman column, standing tall in a small piazza at the end of a flight of steps. The Roman Column was erected in the 2nd century AD to mark the end of the Appian Way, an ancient road that connected Rome to Brindisi. The column is a testament to Brindisi’s importance as a trading port towards Greece and the East during ancient times.\n\nA private tour of Brindisi’s historic center is a good option if you want to see the main landmarks and learn more about this overlooked Italian city.\n\n2. The laid-back lifestyle along the pretty waterfront\n\nTake a stroll, look at the sailing boats moored along Brindisi waterfront, stop for a drink at one of the cafés, and enjoy the exhilarating scent of the sea. There’s often a gentle breeze making it a great place to escape the heat and chill out.\n\nYou can also catch a shuttle boat to reach the opposite side of the bay (as you’ll see, Brindisi harbour does not overlook the open sea but an inner fjord). From there, you’ll see the waterfront from a different perspective and walk to another Brindisi attraction: the Monument to the Italian Sailor.\n\n3. The view of the waterfront from the top of the Monument to the Italian Sailor\n\nThe top of the Monument to the Italian Sailor – shaped like a helm – is likely the best viewpoint on the beautiful Brindisi waterfront. From there, you’ll enjoy a different view of the city, with the pastel-colored houses overlooking the seafront and the boats waiting to take the sea. Pure marine bliss. While you’re there, don’t miss looking at the stunning spiraling oval staircase.\n\n4. Amazing food and excellent wine\n\nLike everywhere else in Italy, in Brindisi, you’ll taste delicious food and good wine. The area is a land of olive oil, tasty vegetables, and great cheeses. Puglia also boasts excellent wines, like Negroamaro, Sussumaniello, and the now well-known Primitivo. As a result, you can expect a delicious meal in almost every restaurant.\n\nIf you are staying in a self-catering place, ask for a local market where you’ll find lots of fresh products at surprisingly reasonable prices.\n\nDo you love cooking and Italian cuisine? Then you may want to experience a food tour or even a cooking class!\n\n4. Old houses, a little crumbling but enchanting\n\nMaybe it’s just me, but I’m fascinated by old houses, even when they are a little crumbling. It’s not that I don’t like restored ancient buildings, but I sometimes feel like perfection – as it happened to me when I visited Alberobello – ends up being a bit too aseptic for my taste. When I look at peeling facades, I can feel life, and my imagination starts to run freely.\n\n6. Ostuni, the ‘White City’\n\nOnly 40 km from Brindisi, Ostuni is a perfect day trip. You can get there by bus, rent a car, or take a guided day tour to discover three of Apulia’s gems: Alberobello, Locorotondo, and Ostuni.\n\nWander along the tiny cobblestone streets of the ‘White City,’ have a look at the small shops, and stop for lunch, dinner, or a drink in one of the lovely cafés and restaurants with inviting alfresco tables, for an unforgettable day. I had a wonderful time in Ostuni, albeit too short, and would love to go back.\n\n7. The countryside, olive groves, and Torre Guaceto Nature Reserve\n\nYou need not travel far from the city to discover the countryside typical of the Brindisi area.\n\nA nice spot is the Torre Guaceto Nature Reserve, home to beautiful olive groves, pretty creeks, dunes, and marshes. There, you can hike, bike, swim (but only in the designated areas), and snorkel. But beware in summer, as the reserve can be very hot, and there’s very little shade, if any, on the seashore. Bring with you a lot of water and possibly a beach umbrella to protect yourself from the sun and the heat.\n\nUseful information to Visit Brindisi\n\nHow to get to Brindisi:\n\nBrindisi airport has flights from/to many Italian and European cities, operated by major carriers and low-cost airlines. You can check the cheapest airfares on Trip.com. The airport is close to the center and very well connected by a regular bus service.\n\nGetting around:\n\nThe easiest way to explore Brindisi’s surroundings is to hire a car at the airport. Check out here to find the best car rental rates.\n\nWhere to stay in Brindisi:\n\nThere are several charming Bed&Breakfast in Brindisi.\n\nThe small B&B I Templari Dimora Storica has two nicely decorated rooms (about 50 and 55 sqm, respectively) in a historical building recently renovated and located in the center.\n\nClose to the sea, in the center, Santo Stefano Luxury B&B has modern and stylish rooms and boasts a rooftop sundeck and a small swimming pool (seasonal).\n\nCheck more Hotels in Brindisi\n\nBooks about Puglia and travel guides\n\nOld Puglia: A Cultural Companion to South-Eastern Italy (Armchair Traveller)\n\nLonely Planet Southern Italy (Travel Guide)\n\nPuglia Map\n\nMichelin Map Italy: Puglia 363\n\nPin for later!\n\n_______\n\nNote: ‘Brindisi is My Destination‘ invited me to discover this overlooked area of Puglia.
