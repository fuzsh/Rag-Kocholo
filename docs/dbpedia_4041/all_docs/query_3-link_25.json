        "text": "Brindisi is the Discworld equivalent of Italy on Roundworld. The country is near-tropical, rimward and turnwise of Genua and includes a peninsula into the Gulf of Brindisi. The Roundworld namesake is a city of the same name in the Eastern part of the Italian \"heel\" peninsula. In addition, Brindisi itself stands on a small peninsula whose shape resembles a deer head (i.e.: 'Brentesion' in Greek). Brindisi also means \"toast\" in Italian (to make a toast not the grilled bread) which is an appropriate name for a Discworld country that seems to like Italian style food and wine. The country of Brindisi is three thousand miles across the continent from Ankh-Morpork, but its language is obviously derived from Latatian, so it was likely an outpost of the Morporkian Empire at one time. The language the locals speak is stereotypical of every comedy routine poking fun at Italians - Evaree-ona speaka lika dis iffa dey comea from dere! Brindisian immigrants contribute much to the Artistic and Food Service Industries in Ankh-Morpork. The Brindisian language is not widely spoken there, but it is common in restaurants and at the opera. According to The Compleat Ankh-Morpork the cuisine can be sampled at 'La Triviata', a Brindisian restaurant on Holofernes Street in the Isle of Gods in Ankh-Morpork. The most famous export of the countty is the opera star Senor Enrico Basilica who immigrated to Brindisi as Henry Slugg (a name that was not much of a career enhancer for a stage name), learned the language and began touring the famous opera houses of the Discworld before returning to star in Maskerade in Ankh-Morpork. The Flying Pastrami Brothers acrobatic team of Monty Bladder's Three-Ring Circus are also Brindisi stars who have changed their names from Sidney and Frank Cartwright to Marco and Falco Pastrami."
