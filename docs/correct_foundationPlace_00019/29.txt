Every year the company donates about 2 per cent of its profits to its Foundation. It is then allocated to community and development projects across the Czech Republic and other countries where Avast has offices.

This year, the Prague Fringe is delighted to be among these recipients and has been able to invest in greater marketing and improved infrastructure and staffing thanks to the funding.
