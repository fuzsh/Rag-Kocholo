Prague, Czech Republic, November 23, 2020 — Avast (LSE:AVST), a global leader in digital security and privacy products, announces today it is planning to launch new globally-focused social impact programs through the Avast Foundation early next year. The new Avast Foundation will run programs that are more tightly aligned to the company’s purpose of securing people's digital lives. The former Prague-based Nadační fond Avast is transitioning into a new family-run foundation, Abakus, established by the Avast founders Pavel Baudis and Eduard Kucera, which will focus on important social issues in the Czech Republic.

To date, Nadační fond Avast has been Avast’s main vehicle of giving back to communities and addressing pressing social issues in the Czech Republic, where Avast was founded more than 30 years ago. The existing grant schemes are mostly focused on the development of end-of-life care, support families of children with disabilities and improving the general Czech education system. They will continue running under the newly established foundation Abakus.

“I am proud of the Avast Foundation’s achievements over the decade of its existence due to the continuous support and vision of both Avast's founders, their wives and families. I thank them for their dedication, support and trust. This last year has, however, shown us that Avast needs to do more and in other countries as well as the Czech Republic,” says Avast CEO Ondrej Vlcek. “With the global pandemic, more people are using the internet for study, work and leisure, and our mission to protect people in the digital world has never been more important. The new programs we are looking to build will address critical societal issues arising from increased technology adoption. We are excited about the opportunity to drive positive change and to be a part of empowering digital citizens to be safe, confident and free online.”

“Avast is expanding its efforts aiming to make a difference internationally. As a result we will have two organizations - the new Avast Foundation and the Abakus Foundation giving back to communities worldwide in various ways. I wish them both much success,” says Pavel Baudiš, one of the Avast Founders. “The Abakus foundation will continue the 10 year long legacy of successful projects of the ‘Nadační fond Avast’. With Eduard Kučera, we share a long-life friendship and similar views which is why we chose to set up a joint families foundation. The Abakus acronym refers to our names and the abacus symbolizes the quest for smart solutions to all,” adds he mission of the Abakus Foundation is to create an environment helping in solving current social problems and thus contribute to a positive change in the Czech society.

While the new Abakus foundation will continue to support for Czech communities, Avast will be focusing on global issues where its technology and expertise can make an important contribution. Building upon the recent donation of $25 million to science and technology initiatives to help combat COVID-19, Avast will strive to educate and equip the new generation of digital citizens to protect them online, preserve their privacy and help them to understand and control the risks they might face online. The details of the new Avast Foundation scheme and operations will be announced in early 2021.

Avast will contribute support to the operations of the new Abakus Foundation, transitioning over the next few years to the new Avast Foundation as both begin to scale their programs.
