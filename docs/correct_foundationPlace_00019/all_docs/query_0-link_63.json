        "text": "TEMPE, Ariz. & PRAGUE & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ: NLOK), a global leader in consumer Cyber Safety, and Avast (LSE: AVST), a global leader in digital security and privacy, are pleased to announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended merger of Avast with NortonLifeLock, in the form of a recommended offer by NortonLifeLock, for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Avast.\n\nUnder the terms of the merger Avast shareholders will be entitled to receive a combination of cash consideration and newly issued shares in NortonLifeLock with alternative consideration elections available. Based on NortonLifeLock’s closing share price of USD 27.20 on July 13, 2021 (being the last trading day for NortonLifeLock shares before market speculation began in relation to the merger on July 14, 2021, resulting in the commencement of the offer period), the merger values Avast’s entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital between approximately USD 8.1B and USD 8.6B, depending on Avast shareholders’ elections.\n\nThe boards of NortonLifeLock and Avast believe that the merger has compelling strategic and financial rationale and represents an attractive opportunity to create a new, industry-leading consumer Cyber Safety business, leveraging the established brands, technology and innovation of both groups to deliver substantial benefits to consumers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\n“ This transaction is a huge step forward for consumer Cyber Safety and will ultimately enable us to achieve our vision to protect and empower people to live their digital lives safely,” said Vincent Pilette, Chief Executive Officer of NortonLifeLock. “ With this combination, we can strengthen our Cyber Safety platform and make it available to more than 500 million users. We will also have the ability to further accelerate innovation to transform Cyber Safety.”\n\n“ At a time when global cyber threats are growing, yet cyber safety penetration remains very low, together with NortonLifeLock, we will be able to accelerate our shared vision of providing holistic cyber protection for consumers around the globe,” said Ondřej Vlček, Chief Executive Officer of Avast. “ Our talented teams will have better opportunities to innovate and develop enhanced solutions and services, with improved capabilities from access to superior data insights. Through our well-established brands, greater geographic diversification and access to a larger global user base, the combined businesses will be poised to access the significant growth opportunity that exists worldwide.”\n\nStrategic and Financial Benefits\n\nAccelerates the transformation of consumer Cyber Safety with over 500 million users;\n\nCombines Avast’s strength in privacy and NortonLifeLock’s strength in identity, creating a broad and complementary product portfolio, beyond core security and towards adjacent trust-based solutions;\n\nStrengthens geographic diversification and facilitates expansion into the SOHO / VSB segments;\n\nUnlocks significant value creation through approximately USD 280 million of annual gross cost synergies1, with additional upside potential from new reinvestment capacity for innovation and growth;\n\nBrings together two strong and highly experienced consumer-focused management teams.\n\nThe Merger will also enhance the financial profile of the combined company through increased scale, long-term growth, cost synergies with reinvestment capacity and strong cash flow generation supported by a resilient balance sheet, and is expected to drive double-digit EPS accretion within the first full year following completion of the Merger and double-digit revenue growth in the long-term.\n\nOrganization and Management\n\nFollowing the completion of the transaction, NortonLifeLock’s CEO, Vincent Pilette, will remain CEO, NortonLifeLock’s CFO, Natalie Derse, will remain CFO, and Avast’s CEO, Ondřej Vlček, is expected to join NortonLifeLock as President and become a member of the NortonLifeLock Board of Directors. In addition, Pavel Baudiš, a co-founder and current director of Avast, is expected to join the NortonLifeLock Board as an independent director.\n\nOn completion of the merger, the combined company will be dual headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic, and Tempe, Arizona, USA, and will have a significant presence in the Czech Republic. The combined company will be listed on NASDAQ.\n\nTransaction Details\n\nFor specific details of the proposed transaction please visit our transaction microsite.\n\nConference Call\n\nNortonLifeLock management will discuss the details of this transaction on a conference call today, August 10, 2021 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET.\n\nWebcast: Investor.NortonLifeLock.com (replay will be posted after the conference call).\n\nPhone Dial-In: Investor.NortonLifeLock.com to register in advance for call details\n\nAdvisors\n\nEvercore is serving as financial advisor to NortonLifeLock and Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Macfarlanes LLP are serving as its legal advisors.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as “anticipate”, “target”, “expect”, “estimate”, “intend”, “plan”, “goal”, “believe”, “aim”, “will”, “may”, “would”, “could” or “should” or other words of similar meaning or the negative thereof. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, economic performance, financial conditions, dividend policy, losses and future prospects, (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of the operations of NortonLifeLock or Avast, and (iii) the effects of government regulation on the business of NortonLifeLock or Avast. There are many factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such factors include the possibility that the transaction will not be completed on a timely basis or at all, whether due to the failure to satisfy the conditions of the transaction (including approvals or clearances from regulatory and other agencies and bodies) or otherwise, general business and economic conditions globally, industry trends, competition, changes in government and other regulation, changes in political and economic stability, disruptions in business operations due to reorganisation activities, interest rate and currency fluctuations, the inability of the combined company to realise successfully any anticipated synergy benefits when (and if) the transaction is implemented, the inability of the combined company to integrate successfully NortonLifeLock’s and Avast’s operations when (and if) the transaction is implemented and the combined company incurring and/or experiencing unanticipated costs and/or delays or difficulties relating to the transaction when (and if) it is implemented. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors is contained in the Risk Factors sections of NortonLifeLock’s most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, nor do they form part of, this press release.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the present and future business strategies of such persons and the environment in which each will operate in the future. By their nature, these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, as well as uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future.

The synergies are expected to be fully realised by the end of the second year following completion of the Merger.\n\nNortonLifeLock intends to approach integration with the aim of retaining and motivating the best talent and structure across the Combined Company to create a best-in-class organisation. The expected sources of the identified cost synergies are as follows:\n\nOrganisation: approximately 50% of the total annual run-rate pre-tax gross cost synergies are expected to be generated through the adoption of shared best practice across existing functions and the reduction of duplicate roles across all geographies, and from a broad range of job categories, including management, shared services, product and commercial functions;\n\nSystems & Infrastructure operating costs: approximately 25% of the total annual run-rate pre-tax gross cost synergies are expected to be realised through migration onto a common data and security platform, integration of systems, and shared technology and analytics infrastructure; and\n\nContracts & Shared Services: approximately 25% of the total annual run-rate pre-tax gross cost synergies are expected to be generated primarily from site rationalisation, procurement and vendor consolidation, and spend de-duplication.\n\nNortonLifeLock expects to realise approximately 60% of the run-rate cost savings by the end of the first full year following completion of the Merger and 100% by the end of the second full year following completion of the Merger, excluding any potential synergy reinvestment and associated benefits. On a reported basis, the synergies assume the Combined Company expects to benefit from approximately USD 75 million of cost savings in the first full year following completion of the Merger, approximately USD 245 million of cost savings in the second full year following completion of the Merger, and the full USD 280 million of the cost savings in the third full year following completion of the Merger, excluding any potential synergy reinvestment and associated benefits.\n\nOne-off costs\n\nIn order to realise these synergies, NortonLifeLock is expected to incur one-off restructuring and integration costs of approximately one year’s run-rate pre-tax cost savings, or USD 280 million, with approximately USD 180 million estimated to be incurred in the first full year following completion of the Merger and approximately USD 100 million estimated to be incurred in the second full year following completion of the Merger. Aside from integration costs, no material dis-benefits are expected to arise in connection with the Merger. The expected synergies will accrue as a direct result of the Merger and would not be achieved on a standalone basis.\n\nThe paragraphs above relating to expected cost synergies constitute a “Quantified Financial Benefits Statement” for the purposes of Rule 28 of the Code.\n\nGiven the strong strategic, cultural and operational fit of the two companies, NortonLifeLock believes that the quantified cost synergies are readily achievable.\n\nNortonLifeLock expects to achieve the quantified cost synergies while maintaining appropriate investment levels in sales and technology to meet the Combined Company’s growth targets and other objectives.\n\nThe estimated cost synergies referred to above reflect both the beneficial elements and the relevant costs.”\n\nFurther information on the bases of belief supporting the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, including the principal assumptions and sources of information, is set out below.\n\nBases of belief and principal assumptions\n\nIn preparing the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, a synergy working group comprising senior strategy, operations, technical, sales and financial personnel from NortonLifeLock (the “Working Group”) was established to identify, challenge and quantify the potential synergies available from the integration of the NortonLifeLock and Avast businesses, and to undertake an initial planning exercise.\n\nIn preparing the detailed synergy plan, both NortonLifeLock and Avast have shared certain operating and financial information to support the evaluation of the potential synergies available from the Merger and have conducted a series of virtual meetings with the key management personnel of both NortonLifeLock and Avast. This has included input from both the NortonLifeLock and Avast executive leadership teams.\n\nBased on the information shared and interactions with Avast, the Working Group has performed a bottom-up analysis of costs included in the NortonLifeLock and Avast financial information and has sought to include in the synergy analysis those costs which the Working Group believe will be either optimized or reduced as a result of the Merger. In circumstances where the information provided by Avast has been limited for commercial or other reasons, the Working Group has made estimates and assumptions to aid its development of individual synergy initiatives. The assessment and quantification of the potential synergies have in turn been informed by NortonLifeLock management’s industry experience as well as their experience of executing and integrating acquisitions in the past.\n\nThe baseline used as the basis for the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement is NortonLifeLock’s adjusted cost base for the financial year ended 2 April 2021, supported where relevant by certain information from NortonLifeLock’s budgeted cost base for the financial year ending 1 April 2022, and Avast’s adjusted cost base for the financial year ended 31 December 2020, supported where relevant by certain information from Avast’s budgeted cost base for the financial year ending 31 December 2021.\n\nThe quantified synergies are incremental to NortonLifeLock’s and, to the best of NortonLifeLock’s knowledge, Avast’s existing plans.\n\nIn general, the synergy assumptions have in turn been risk adjusted, exercising a degree of prudence in the calculation of the estimated synergy benefit set out above.\n\nIn arriving at the estimate of synergies set out in the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement, the NortonLifeLock management has made the following assumptions:\n\nregarding organisational savings:\n\nsavings will be possible by removing duplicate resource through the roll-out of the revised operating model;\n\nthe Combined Company will be able to standardise and roll-out best practice systems and procedures, to generate efficiency and enable headcount reductions; and\n\nno restrictions or delays will arise as a result of industrial relations or employment agreements that significantly affect the realisation of savings by removing duplicate resource;\n\nthere will be no material impact on the underlying operations of either company or their ability to continue to conduct their businesses, including as a result of, or in connection with, the integration of the Avast Group and the NortonLifeLock Group;\n\nthe Combined Company’s product offering generates at least the same level of total revenues as the Avast Group’s and NortonLifeLock Group’s offerings currently generate;\n\nprocurement savings can be realised through rationalising suppliers and renegotiating supplier terms;\n\nthere will be no material change to macroeconomic, political, regulatory, legal or tax conditions in the markets or regions in which NortonLifeLock and Avast operate that will materially impact the implementation of, or costs to achieve, the expected cost savings;\n\nthere will be no material divestments from the existing businesses of either NortonLifeLock or Avast;\n\nthere will be no material change in current foreign exchange rates; and\n\nthere will be no business disruptions that materially affect either company, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks and/or technological issues or supply chain disruptions.\n\nReports\n\nAs required by Rule 28.1(a) of the Code, Deloitte, as reporting accountants to NortonLifeLock, and Evercore Partners International LLP, as financial adviser to NortonLifeLock, have provided the reports required under that Rule. Copies of these reports are included in the announcement made by NortonLifeLock Inc. and Avast plc on or about the date of this announcement.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Quantified Financial Benefits Statement relates to future actions and circumstances which, by their nature, involve risks, uncertainties and contingencies. In addition, due to the scale of the Combined Company, there may be additional changes to the Combined Company’s operations. As a result, the estimated synergies referred to may not be achieved, or may be achieved later or sooner than estimated, or those achieved could be materially different from those estimated.\n\nThe Quantified Financial Benefits Statement should not be construed as a profit forecast or interpreted to mean that NortonLifeLock’s earnings in the first full year following completion of the Merger, or in any subsequent period, will necessarily match or be greater than or be less than those of NortonLifeLock or Avast for the relevant preceding financial period or any other period.\n\nFor the purposes of Rule 28 of the Code, the Quantified Financial Benefits Statement is the responsibility of NortonLifeLock and the NortonLifeLock Directors."
