The Spark Fund provides them with the financial resources and support to harness the power of technology and build a better, safer and more inclusive world.\n\nBe Safe Online\n\nBe Safe Online believes that the most effective way to keep children safe online is not through banning access to the internet, but through compelling and actionable education.\n\nAvastians give back\n\nAvastians around the globe are always seeking opportunities to help and grow local communities. We encourage all Avast staff to engage with causes and organizations that align with their values and are working to improve their communities."
