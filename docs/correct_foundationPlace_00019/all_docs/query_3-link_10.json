        "text": "This article appears in Forbes Czech Republic\n\nVince Steckler lives just down the street from Mark Zuckerberg in Palo Alto. Their homes have one thing in common, besides the Crescent Park address – they are filled to the brim with smart gadgets.\n\n“I've almost got forty of the connected devices at home,” says Steckler, CEO of Avast Software. His household is a real-life model of the vision the largest Czech technological company looks to follow in the coming years. It started out with antivirus programs, grew into a 435 million user business and sees its future in protecting all the things you have connected to the internet at home – from baby monitors, webcams, televisions, thermostats, and fridges, to the front door bell.\n\nIt's impossible to protect every device individually, which is why Avast is aiming one level higher: at the home network, and all the wires leading to your Wi-Fi router. Their solution is called Smart Home Security and it uses artificial intelligence to identify and block threats: through machine learning it continually “listens in” to your data streams and looks for anomalies.\n\nThe number of devices connected to the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) worldwide will almost triple by 2025 and break 75 billion, according to estimates. Some analyses suggest the average American household will have over 30 connected devices by 2020. There is no doubt that many of these will be vulnerable, since producers are swamping the market with new devices at an overwhelming rate, and security isn't their highest priority.\n\nNaturally, IoT has become a key topic for Avast. “We've been working on it for quite some time. We invest a lot of money into research and development. Everyone is headed this way, but since we started early, we're hoping to get there first,” claims Steckler who spends about 10 days a month in his California home, the rest spent traveling or in his Prague office.\n\nThe 59-year old manager, with his characteristic bald head, heavy build and general good humour, helped program software for American nuclear weapons in the 1980s, and later worked for Symantec, overseeing its business in Asian markets from Singapore. In 2009 he moved to the Czech Republic where he, as he puts it, found a “diamond in the rough.”\n\nSteckler was hired to lead Avast by its founders Eduard Kučera and Pavel Baudiš, helping them transform a small company of 40 people into a large corporation employing 1,700 worldwide and eventually go public. Avast debuted as the largest European technology IPO at the London Stock Exchange this May, with a market value of over $3 billion.\n\nAvast is a shining example of 30 years of building capitalism in a post-communist country: Baudiš and Kučera built it up from a weekend hobby project into a huge corporation protecting almost half a billion people, with no privatisation, subsidies or foul play.\n\nIts story began back in the communist era when the regime prohibited private ownership. In the late 1980s, Kučera and Baudiš left state-funded Research Institute of Mathematical Machines (RIMM) to found the Alwil cooperative under the Socialist Union of Youth (In Czechoslovakia, it was the only legal private-owned business entity during communist times), and started a real company after the 1989 revolution.\n\nSince then, it’s been quite a ride. At the turn of the millennium Avast almost went bankrupt when American giant Symantec expanded to Eastern Europe, trying to sweep the markets. With lower pricing and close links to international companies, Symantec almost pulled it off. Avast was only saved by handing out antivirus software for free to households and focusing on SMBs.\n\nTen years later Avast was much stronger and moving forward at pace. In 2010 Steckler brought in Avast's first investor, Summit Partners. By 2012 an attempt at a Wall Street offering fell through and the IPO was cancelled at the last moment due to investor disinterest and market instability. In 2014 a new investor came along, CVC Capital Partners, valuing the company at a billion dollars and two years later Avast bought out its local rival, AVG Technologies, pulling it out of the NYSE. This year Avast’s London Stock Exchange debut saw investors value Avast at $3.1 billion.\n\nEvery month Avast shields its users from over two billion attacks on PCs and mobiles, and not just from viruses. The antivirus firm transformed itself into an all-in-one cybersecurity solution with machine learning and cloud technology. “It's like looking under the hood of a new car. You see a plastic cover only hinting at the motor and all the important components,” adds Steckler. “The same thing is happening today with software. It has to do everything, but at the same time appear very simple on the outside for the users. Very few users want to see what's really going on under the hood, they're only interested in the results.”\n\nWhat is also under the hood is astounding profit: last year Avast reached $780 million in revenue and slightly surpassed $450 million EBITDA mark. In the first half of 2018, the company saw its adjusted EBITDA grow 10.6%, or $221 million.\n\nWhere does all that money comes from, when the vast majority of its users do not pay a penny for Avast products? Earnings come from premium versions, used by 5% of the user base, and various business collaborations. For instance Google and Yahoo – Avast recommends Chrome to its users and the Czech company gets a commission if they decide to install it. And mobile phone producers such as Sony or Huawei: if you run your smartphone's pre-installed antivirus, you're likely to see the slogan “Powered by Avast”.\n\nThis places the 58 year-old Baudiš and 65 year-old Kučera among the richest Czechs, while the former even became a dollar billionaire thanks to the London offering. The duo has been working side by side for more than three decades. What's their recipe for success? “Never has a boss treated laziness as a virtue,” Kučera laughs.\n\nThey perfected this attitude over the years, adding patience to their repertoire after the original Wall Street IPO attempt turned cold at the last minute six years ago. This year Steckler chose London over New York and he has a simple explanation for that.\n\n“We're already too big and settled in our ways for a tech company heading to Wall Street. That's for companies with circa 100 million dollars in revenue and growth of around 30 percent. We are much more mature company. Our revenues are almost eight times higher and we have high single-digit growth,” he says, emphasizing the most important thing. American investors highly value technological startups which often generate little-to-no profit, and instead just burn through money—the opposite of Avast.\n\n“European investors are not generally betting on the high growth, they are more interested in financial fundamentals. American investors in tech IPOs act almost like a VC. They don´t have a lot invested and they are looking for some quick appreciation, in contrast to European investors who are writing much bigger checks,” adds Steckler.\n\nHowever, Avast shares went south following the London IPO. From the offering price of 250 pence it dropped below 210 pence at one point, but in the last few weeks has surpassed 260. The initial drop, of course, did not please Steckler as CEO and stockholder, but he was correct to stay optimistic.\n\nHe says such a decline was to be expected. AVG and Facebook went down a similar path and experienced even more brutal drops. Analysts from Barclay's and Credit Suisse share Steckler's optimism. Their predictions show Avast's shares rising to the 300 pence mark in the coming months. Bankers from Jefferies give Avast a \"Buy\" recommendation and their take is that the market value of the company could double in the next three to four years.\n\n“I am sure Avast is headed in the right direction,” says Steckler. “We have a company that is fundamentally solid and I hope the market is going to be receptive to that. I pay attention to driving the company´s success and the stock price will follow.”"
