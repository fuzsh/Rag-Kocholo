The talk, titled \"Fight for digital freedom in times of cyberwar\", will take place on June 22nd at 10:15 am Eastern Daylight Time on the Center Stage at the annual Collision 2022 conference in Toronto, Canada. Gillian Tett, chair of the editorial board and editor at large at the US edition of the Financial Times, will moderate the live discussion.\n\nDigital freedom for all is a core belief that Avast has held for the last thirty years, since its inception. However, limitations to the internet such as those introduced by autocrats, misinformation, censorship, espionage, and other mechanisms of cyberwar, have put global digital freedom at risk. Ondrej Vlcek and Garry Kasparov will discuss cyberwar activities including DDos attacks, espionage, and ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and their effects on citizens around the globe.\n\nOn June 22, at 2:00 pm EDT at Q&A Stage, Garry Kasparov will be playing a simultaneous chess exhibition with 12 selected participants of the conference.\n\nIn addition, on June 23rd, 2022 at 1:00 pm EDT, Greg Wolfond, Vice President of Identity Initiatives at Avast, will be hosting a Master Class on the best way to protect the digital identity of consumers from continued privacy and security concerns.
