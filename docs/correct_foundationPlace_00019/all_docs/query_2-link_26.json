        "text": "Antivirus software is a must-have cybersecurity solution for protecting your device against viruses, malware and ransomware. However, not all antivirus solutions are the same, and some are better at detecting malicious activity than others. In this article, we’re going to compare two of the top providers on the market: Avast vs. AVG.\n\nFEATURED PARTNER OFFER\n\nAvast\n\n4.2\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes.

All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nUser interface\n\nHighly customizable\n\nWeb defense\n\nFirewall, phishing and password protection\n\nBusiness features\n\nSharePoint protection\n\nBuy Now\n\nOn AVG's secure website\n\nUser interface\n\nHighly customizable\n\nWeb defense\n\nFirewall, phishing and password protection\n\nBusiness features\n\nSharePoint protection\n\nWhy We Picked It\n\nAVG is a solid antivirus solution that has a proven ability to detect the latest viruses and malware as part of independent testing. It also has a range of features that are ideal for business users, including SharePoint protection, which can analyze files downloaded or uploaded via a user’s servers.\n\nThe solution also provides password protection so that users can block certain apps from accessing passwords stored in their web browser. It’s worth noting that it offers 24/7 customer support via call centers in the U.S., U.K. and Australia.\n\nLearn More: Read our full AVG review.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nSolid customization options\n\nWide selection of business-focused plans and features, such as patch management\n\nScored well in independent testing\n\nSharePoint protection\n\nWi-Fi guard alerts when connected to unsecured Wi-Fi\n\nExpensive add-ons\n\nSlower full system scans\n\nDetects false positives\n\nCollects and monetizes user data in the past\n\nAvast vs. AVG: At a Glance\n\nAvast is a complete and affordable antivirus solution that offers a range of capabilities including password protection, data shredding, webcam protection, sandboxing and more.\n\nAnti-Virus Guard, or AVG, is another top antivirus solution produced by the same parent company as Avast, which can be used to scan for malware and other threats. AVG comes with two-way password protection, a firewall, VPN encryption and data shredding.\n\nAt a high level, both Avast and AVG provide small companies with viable solutions to protect their endpoints from the viruses and malware that actors use to target modern businesses.\n\nHow Avast vs. AVG Stack Up\n\nEach of these antivirus solutions is highly reliable and easy to deploy, and very competitive in a number of key areas.\n\nScan Accuracy\n\nBoth Avast and AVG are highly accurate antivirus solutions with identical scores. For instance, both Avast and AVG offer a 94.2% off-line detection rate, a 99.5% online detection rate and a 99.98% online protection rate.\n\nThese rates are competitive with or outperform some of the detection rates offered by third-party vendors including Bitdefender, Malwarebytes and McAfee.\n\nPassword Protection\n\nBoth Avast and AVG provide organizations with their password protection capabilities. For example, Avast’s password protection capabilities enable users to select which apps can access passwords stored in the web browser.\n\nAVG’s password protection not only allows users to determine whether an app can access their passwords or not, but also notifies the user if a password entered in the browser is weak, duplicated or has been leaked online. This provides a valuable heads-up if they’re using passwords that are easy to crack.\n\nSandboxing\n\nOne key area where Avast differentiates itself from AVG is in its inclusion of sandboxing capabilities. With Avast’s Sandbox, users can run applications in a safe environment that’s isolated from the rest of their PC.\n\nIn effect, this means that the user can download and run distrustful applications, or access unknown files while minimizing the risk of compromising their device. AVG doesn’t offer any sandboxing capabilities at this time.\n\nCost of Avast vs. AVG\n\nPaid plans for Avast range from INR 4,144.79 ($49.99) to INR 6,632.17 ($79.99) per year for a range of products including Avast One, Avast Premium Security, Avast Home Office Solutions, Avast Small Business Cybersecurity Solutions and the Advanced Protection Plan. Pricing for each product is summarized briefly below:\n\nAvast One: All-in-one malware and virus protection with an unlimited VPN and data breach monitoring. Pricing starts at INR 4,168.84 ($50.28) per year.\n\nAvast Premium Security: An antivirus protection package that helps defend against phishing websites. Costs INR 4,144.79 ($49.99) for the first year for up to 10 devices.\n\nAvast Small Office Protection: Antivirus platform with 24/7 technical support. Costs INR 11.606.91 ($139.99) per year plus $14 per device per year.\n\nAvast Essential Business Security: An online management platform offering identity protection, patch management, VPNs and identity management. Prices start at INR 12,300.89 ($148.36) per year plus INR 2,460.01 ($29.67) per device per year.\n\nPrices for AVG range from INR 4,964.80 ($59.88) to INR 6,632.17 ($79.99) per year. Pricing for each product is summarized briefly below:\n\nAVG Internet Security: Antivirus and malware with ransomware protection and anti-phishing website protection. Costs INR 4,964.80 ($59.88) per year and supports up to 10 devices.\n\nAVG Ultimate: Blocks viruses, malware and ransomware with additional storage space and a secure VPN. Costs INR 6,632.17 ($79.99) per year and supports up to 10 devices.\n\nCustomer Reviews & Reputation\n\nData Shredding\n\nBoth Avast and AVG provide users with data shredding capabilities. Avast’s Data Shredder can be used to permanently delete files so that they can’t be retrieved. This means that if someone steals the device, they won’t be able to recover any destroyed content.\n\nAVG also offers data shredding so you can delete files and folders. You can also delete entire drives if you have multiple partitioned drives on your PC.\n\nEncryption\n\nBoth Avast and AVG offer virtual private networks (VPNs) that protect the user’s sessions with “military grade” AES-256 bit encryption. This means that the user’s internet service provider (ISP) will be unable to track what sites they visit.\n\nIt also means that they can connect to public Wi-Fi without worrying about anyone eavesdropping on their browsing activity. Avast and AVG each support up to 10 devices at once with a reasonable download speed.\n\nFirewall\n\nEach of the two providers also offers a firewall feature to manage traffic between the user’s device and the public internet. Avast’s firewall controls when an app can connect to the internet or a private network, and gives the users prompts so they can manually allow or deny connection attempts.\n\nThere are also firewall logs where the user can view a summary of blocked apps, devices and applied rules. There’s also a premium upgrade which provides additional capabilities such as leak protection, port scan alerts and ARP spoofing alerts.\n\nSimilarly, AVG allows the user-to-monitor incoming and outgoing traffic from their device to the internet, giving the user the option to choose from custom or default rules for each app. Along with Avast, users can also configure firewall prompts to manually allow or block each connection. Likewise, firewall logs allow users to view a summary of blocked apps, devices and applied rules.\n\nWi-Fi Scanning\n\nAnother feature that stands out with Avast is its Wi-Fi scanning feature. Avast can scan a user’s Wi-Fi network to identify vulnerabilities in the network that could be compromised to gain access to their private data. Likewise, with Avast Premium Security, users can receive an alert whenever someone joins the network.\n\nWi-Fi scanning is a useful addition because it helps to increase the user’s transparency over their network activity so they can be notified about other threats to their data. AVG doesn’t offer a similar service at this time.\n\nTop Avast and AVG Alternatives\n\nWhile Avast and AVG are high-performance antivirus tools, there are a number of competitive providers such as Bitdefender and Norton Antivirus that also offer extremely reliable experiences. Some of these top alternatives are listed below:\n\nBottom Line\n\nAvast and AVG are both extremely competitive across the board with high malware detection rates, but Avast has the edge due to its comprehensive base feature set and its inclusion of sandboxing.\n\nHaving a sandboxing capability really decreases the chance of a device being compromised because it adds an extra layer of protection in the event that an employee makes the mistake of downloading a malicious file. Its customer support is also solid.\n\nAvast is best for:\n\nSmall teams\n\nSandboxing\n\nCustomer support\n\nAVG is best for:\n\nSole proprietors\n\nLow cost\n\nData shredding\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)"
