        "text": "In 1988 Pavel Baudis encountered the Vienna Virus while working as a researcher at the Mathematical Machines Research Institute in Prague, Czechoslovakia. He teamed up with fellow researcher Eduard Kucera to eradicate the virus. Together they formed the ALWIL Software cooperative and created the Avast software. However, Baudis and Kucera waited until 1991 -- two years after Czechoslovakia severed its ties with the Soviet Union -- to form a joint partnership company due to eased socio-economic constraints.\n\nIn 1995, Ondrej Vlcek, who would become the company’s CTO, wrote the first anti-virus program for Microsoft Windows 95. The next year, publication Virus Bulletin gave awards to Alwil in all of its testing categories, making Avast among the three anti-virus programs in the world to achieve that feat. In 2001, based on the belief that all computer owners should be able to afford necessary anti-virus protection, Alwil launched a free version of the software for home users. As a result, the number of Avast users grew to 20 million within the next five years. In 2010 Alwil changed its name to Avast to align itself more closely with its software brand. As of 2013, Avast has more than 170 million users.\n\nAvast is a cross-platform brand; it's compatible with several operating systems that include Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Linux and Android. Customers use Avast on personal computers as well as mobile devices, servers and workstations. It is a freemium brand, which means that the program is free of charge but requires payment for its more advanced features, such as firewall protection, automatic program updates, spam elimination and remote computer access. As of June 2013, the current version of the software is Avast 8.0."
