        "text": "Avast, Norton merger to be closed in mid-2022 - Avast CEO\n\nPrague, Aug 11 (CTK) - The merger of Avast, a supranational cybersecurity firm of Czech origin, and US firm NortonLifeLock will be completed in 9 to 10 months, and the successor company will bear a new name, Avast CEO Vlcek said at an online press conference today, referring to the merger announced late last night.\n\nAccording to both firms' press release, NortonLifeLock intends to pay USD8.1-8.6bn (about Kc175.6-186.4bn) for Avast.\n\nThe merger will give rise to one of the 20 largest software companies in the world, Vlcek said.\n\nIt will be a global cybersecurity leader that will combine Avast's strength in privacy protection and Norton's strength in identity protection, Vlcek said in a press release earlier.\n\nBefore the closing of the merger, general meetings of both companies have to take place and regulatory approvals in the countries where the firms operate have to be obtained, Vlcek said at the press conference.\n\n\"This is why we expect the merger to be closed around the middle of next year. Until then, both firms will operate independently,\" Vlcek said.\n\nAvast leaders Vlcek and Pavel Baudis are to become board members of the successor company, while NortonLifeLock CEO Vincent Pilette is to be the new firm's CEO.\n\nThanks to the merger, savings in gross expenses in the amount of about USD280bn (about Kc6bn) will be achieved, Vlcek said.\n\nThe merger will also create potential synergies on the revenue side ensuing from opportunities on new markets, he added.\n\n\"We plan to use them (the savings) partly to fund new investment projects worth USD80-100m (Kc1.7-2.2bn), mainly in research and development, innovations and business growth,\" Vlcek said.\n\nThe new company will be based in Prague and Tempe, Arizona, Vlcek confirmed. It intends to offer services to more than 500 million users.\n\nAvast's current shareholders will own 14-26 percent of the new firm, Vlcek said.\n\nBoth companies' existing shareholders will be able to choose one of two merger options. Under the first option, they would be paid 90 percent of their shares in cash and the remaining 10 percent in the form of shares in the new company. Avast shareholders would get USD7.61 (Kc165) per share.\n\nUnder the other option, preferred by Avast, shareholders would get cash for 31 percent of their shares at a price of USD2.37 (Kc51.4) per share plus shares in the new company for their reBoth firms first announced their talks on a merger in July.\n\nAccording to analysts polled by CTK, the merger may create a rival for the world's largest software companies including Microsoft and Google. It will most likely lead to organisational savings and staff reduction in both companies, they said.\n\n\"It is not a merger of identical companies. Each of them specialises in a different market segment,\" Roger economist Dominik Stroukal noted.\n\nBoth companies will mutually supplement their product portfolios and expand their geographic reach, Ceska sporitelna analyst Petr Bartek. Layoffs can be expected in administrative jobs rather than in IT roles, as IT firms both in Czechia and the USA tend to keep good programmers, he added.\n\nThe Avast brand will be maintained in the near future but will most likely cease to exist in a long term, since Norton is a globally stronger brand, the analysts said.\n\nThere are other firms in Czechia that could motivate foreign investors to make mergers or acquisitions of a similar size in the future, the analysts said, mentioning large e-commerce players such as Alza and HP Tronics.\n\nThe sum to be paid by NortonLifeLock for Avast is the highest ever paid for a Czech company, the analysts noted.\n\nThe merger will lead to the departure of another Czech firm from the Prague Stock Exchange (BCPP), which will be a loss for the Prague bourse, according to the analysts. The Prague bourse did not comment on the possibility. Avast shares on the BCPP have climbed to Kc174 apiece so far today.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, an average of 244,000 Avast shares has exchanged hands on the BCPP daily, generating a turnover of over Kc36m, which accounts for about 7 percent of this year's average daily turnover on the Prague bourse, Portu investment platform founder Radim Krejci noted.\n\n\"It is a pity that this technology title will disappear from the Czech bourse floor, but the offer of the US rival was too attractive,\" 4fin's Vojtech Duffek said.\n\nShareholders who have bought Avast shares in the past 24 months will make yields of tens of percent thanks to the deal, he added.\n\nAvast was set up in 1988 and its shares are traded on the Prague and London stock exchanges. It is one of the pioneers in cybersecurity.\n\nAvast employs over 1,700 people and its products are used by more than 435 million users all over the world, partly free of charge. It blocks 1.5 billion cyberattacks a month.\n\nAvast founders currently hold about 35 percent of the firm.\n\nNortonLifeLock, based in Temple, formerly operated as Symentec. It sold the Symantec section to US chip producer Broadcom in 2019. At present, its main products are antivirus software Norton and identity theft protection software LifeLock.\n\ntam/er"
