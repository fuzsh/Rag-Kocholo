From a report: The complaint says Avast violated millions of consumers' rights by collecting, storing, and selling their browsing data without their knowledge and consent while misleading them that the products used to harvest their data would block online tracking. \"While the FTC's privacy lawsuits routinely take on firms that misrepresent their data practices, Avast's decision to expressly market its products as safeguarding people's browsing records and protecting data from tracking only to then sell those records is especially galling,\" said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan.\n\n\"Moreover, the volume of data Avast released is staggering: the complaint alleges that by 2020 Jumpshot had amassed \"more than eight petabytes of browsing information dating back to 2014.\" More specifically, the FTC says UK-based company Avast Limited harvested consumers' web browsing information without their knowledge or consent using Avast browser extensions and antivirus software since at least 2014."
