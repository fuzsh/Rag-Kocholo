        "text": "The Avast Forums post Support WSL pico processes has this useful text:\n\nAvast. much like Windows Defender currently requires the entire Linux distribution to be exempted in order to run pico processes. This is an unacceptable risk to security in any corporate environment. What Avast needs to do is treat Pico processes the same way as Windows processes. Microsoft will soon be releasing an update to Windows Defender in \"Skip-Ahead Insiders\" builds that manage rules at per process/port level. Avast should implement a similar setup. There is a blog from 2016 Microsoft has provided to assist third-party vendors such as Avast to integrate with WSL. Here's the blog: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2016/11/01/wsl-antivirus-and-firewall-compatibility/\n\nThe Microsoft article Pico Process Overview further explains the concept:\n\nThis post discusses pico processes, the foundation of WSL. It explains how pico processes work in Windows and goes into the history of how they came to be, the abstractions we decided to implement and the various use cases beyond WSL that emerged.\n\nAs far as I could find, the Ubuntu release in Windows resides in the following folders:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_1804.2019.521.0_x64__79rhkp1fndgsc\n\nC:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\n\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\lxss\n\nIf the Avast Forums post is correct, these are the folders that are need to be exempt in Avast in order to allow the execution of Ubuntu.\n\nAs far as Avast settings are concerned, it has been advised to enable the following:\n\nInternet Connection Sharing mode\n\nAllow all connections with Friends when in Private mode\n\nEnable automatic profile switching\n\nEnable automatic port scan detection\n\nA reboot is required after enabling these settings.\n\nThese are all only workarounds, until Avast releases an update to support WSL. If the above workarounds don't work for you, you need to disable the Avast firewall while using WSL, or suspend Avast until they fix the problem. Until then, Windows Defender is good enough for most purposes."
