        "text": "Why partner?\n\nWe know that some of our more intractable problems will only be solved when we all work together towards a solution. History shows that we work better when we come together, while the current state of our planet illustrates that working in silos or at cross-purposes causes imbalance, as we can make decisions that negatively impact wider communities.\n\nThrough effective partnership we can demonstrate the power and impact of working together.\n\nWe live in challenging times with dwindling resources. Being able to pool and share resources can make our efforts go further and is good practice.\n\nPartnership vision\n\nOrganizations often talk about working together, but either don't really commit to it or bring just their own interests to the table. Understanding the needs of your partner organizations is key. If all parties put the interests of the others first, then the partnership is far more likely to be beneficial for all, and just as importantly, to succeed in its wider objectives.\n\nSmarter partnership\n\nWorking together effectively and for mutual benefit means harnessing all available assets and creating space for all communities of interest to have input.\n\nSuccessful partnerships can take on a variety of forms:\n\nPartners in thought: Organizations commit to challenge each other’s thinking and assumptions, inevitably leading to creative problem solving and innovation.\n\nPartners in production:Organizations commit to share their assets to save costs and build their collective capacity.\n\nPartners in purpose: Organizations form networks or are aligned in working towards a shared objective (like a movement)\n\nHallmarks of a good partnership\n\nIf you think of the partnerships you have been involved in,either personal or professional, you’ll probably find that most, if not all of the successful ones, demonstrate many of the hallmarks listed below:\n\n-Mutual Interest/benefit(for collaborative advantage)\n\n-Transparency\n\n-Trust\n\n-Equity"
