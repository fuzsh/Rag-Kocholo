        "text": "Many organizations have received funding from us for COVID-19 response since the announcement of our first pandemic-related funding commitment in January 2020. For example, in February 2020 we provided a grant to help the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention scale up testing capacity across sub-Saharan Africa. We also provided fast and flexible funding to international organizations—including the World Health Organization (WHO) and its regional offices in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East—to support preparations to help COVID-19 patients around the world.\n\nTo support the development of COVID-19 vaccines, we have provided grants to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) for research into additional COVID-19 vaccine candidates that could be less expensive or easier to deliver—such as vaccines that do not need to be kept extremely cold. We have also provided more than $200 million to the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment to help ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are accessible and affordable in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nIn Seattle, where we are headquartered, we provided a grant to the local public health department to support public information efforts about appropriate measures to help prevent further spread of the disease. We also contributed to six regional COVID-19 response funds to support efforts by community-based organizations to help groups at higher risk of contracting the disease (such as health care and service industry workers) or low-income families who have lost their income due to social distancing and closures.\n\nYou can find more information about our grants in our grants database.\n\nGovernments play the most critical role in protecting people from COVID-19. Many organizations, including the foundation, are also funding efforts to fight this pandemic because of the great danger it presents to so many people. One of the advantages of foundation grants is the ability to deliver fast and flexible funding to help countries and organizations take rapid action and fill resource gaps.\n\nPhilanthropy doesn’t—and shouldn’t—take the place of government. Philanthropy complements government by playing a unique role in driving progress. Philanthropy is best at testing out ideas that might not otherwise get tried. This approach is known as “catalytic philanthropy,” where foundations like ours put wind in the sails of innovations and initiatives with the potential to save and transform lives.\n\nIn the face of this collective threat, we believe working together with governments and other organizations is our most effective tool.\n\nCOVID-19 is gender blind but not gender neutral. Before the pandemic began, poverty levels among women had fallen continuously for 20 years. Those levels are now rising rapidly. The virus exposed how fragile and superficial the economic gains for women have been in many countries.\n\nTo document the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on women in the economy and to identify evidence-based solutions, we have collaborated with grantees and partners to produce a series of evidence reviews that highlight key issues in the economic crisis facing women and girls. We’re working to understand how and why women are more vulnerable to the economic shocks of this pandemic.\n\nTo respond to the global COVID-19 recession, which has affected women’s livelihoods most drastically, recovery plans must put women and girls at the center. We are working with civil society organizations, academia, national governments, and international financing institutions to ensure that economic recovery efforts prioritize gender equality rather than reinforce old inequalities. Countries that get this right will recover faster and be more resilient to future crises. Those that do not will merely be building their recovery on top of the same social cracks and economic fault lines as before. Equality cannot wait until this crisis has passed.\n\nA portion of our total COVID-19 commitments is going toward strengthening health systems and supporting regional and country-specific responses in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Starting in the earliest days of this global emergency, we have focused on equitable and sustainable solutions that place the needs of lower-income countries and vulnerable populations at the center. We believe that everyone deserves access to vaccines and therapeutics, and this commitment to health equity is at the core of our foundation’s values and our funding during the pandemic.\n\nOur support for pandemic response in Africa and South Asia has included helping governments and regional agencies improve disease detection, increase capacity to diagnose COVID-19, and set up infrastructure to safely isolate and care for people with confirmed infections. We have also worked with partners to help stabilize the market for medical supplies that COVID-19 patients need, such as oxygen, and we have supported partnerships with private companies to devise new ways to distribute food and essential medicines. These measures are helping to address immediate needs while also strengthening regional coordination and capacity for the future and maintaining progress in the fight against other infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV.\n\nWe also know that COVID-19 is much more than a health crisis; many countries are feeling immense economic pressure, so we are helping our partners develop ways to support the livelihoods of people experiencing extreme poverty. You can read more about our approach to COVID-19 in Africa in an Ideas post by Cheikh Oumar Seydi, our Africa director, and Dr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, CEO of the African Union Development Agency-NEPAD. You can also read a post by Solomon Zewdu, who is coordinating our COVID-19 Africa response. The following two questions address how we are supporting India’s pandemic response.\n\nOver the past two years, we have worked to support the Indian government’s pandemic response, with a focus on plugging gaps in crucial areas—such as by expanding COVID-19 testing, sewage surveillance, and vaccine development and manufacturing. We have supported the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), NITI Aayog, the Indian Council of Medical Research, the Department of Biotechnology, and the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to strengthen India’s COVID-19 response.\n\nWorking with our partners, we have provided technical assistance to the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to fortify their pandemic response through rapid tracking in command centers, facility preparation, training of medical personnel, and support for telemedicine call centers. Working under the guidance of the MoHFW, our technical support partners have aided training and capacity building efforts and strengthened vaccine logistics in those two states.\n\nWe have worked closely with the Department of Biotechnology to support its PAN-INDIA 1000 SARS-CoV-2 RNA Genome Sequencing Consortium, which launched in May 2020. The program has played a crucial role in the development of diagnostic testing, kit validation, and antiviral testing, as well as identification of new strains of the virus.\n\nIn addition to supporting India’s COVID-19 vaccination drive (see the next question), we have worked closely with development partners such as UNICEF and WHO to help set up a Rapid Response Room to promote accurate messaging and timely response and combat misinformation on the pandemic and on COVID-19 vaccination efforts.\n\nYou can read more about our support for India’s COVID-19 response during the first and second waves of the pandemic in the country in an Ideas post by Hari Menon, the director of our India office.\n\nEven before the pandemic, we provided support to Indian vaccine companies to develop and manufacture low-cost vaccines for various infectious diseases. This contributed to India becoming a global leader in vaccine manufacturing. In 2020, we facilitated a second-source agreement between AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India to ensure timely COVID-19 immunization access in India as well as in other low- and middle-income countries through the Gavi-led COVAX initiative. We also provided at-risk funding to Serum Institute for large-scale manufacturing of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was still in development at the time. This support ensured timely scale-up of the vaccine, known as CoviShield in India, which has been the most-used COVID-19 vaccine in India.\n\nThrough CEPI, we provided $5 million in assistance to Biological E. Limited to scale up its vaccine manufacturing capabilities. We also supported Bharat Biotech in its COVID-19 vaccine development efforts and the scaling up of its manufacturing capabilities to meet not only India’s domestic requirements but also global demand for safe, effective, and low-cost COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThrough our partners, we have also worked to disseminate accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines and to counter misinformation.\n\nIn March 2020, we committed up to $5 million to help public health agencies in the greater Seattle area respond to COVID-19 and meet the immediate needs of people in the area who are economically or medically at risk, such as service industry and gig workers, health care workers, people with limited English proficiency, people experiencing homelessness, and communities of color.\n\nOur U.S. Program has been focusing on the needs of our education system, both within the context of the pandemic and as we look toward recovery. Within that program, we redirected $4 million in our K-12 and Postsecondary strategies to support emergency pandemic-related aid efforts. This funding supported states as they expanded K-12 online learning and coordinated meals and other support for students. We also funded emergency aid to postsecondary institutions to help lessen the financial shocks disproportionately experienced by low-income students due to lost housing, food, and wages. Because the pandemic has been especially devastating for communities of color, we gave $15 million to 10 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to enable them to serve as COVID-19 diagnostic testing hubs—with enough supplies, equipment, and personnel to support diagnostic testing of students, faculty and staff, and people from surrounding communities.\n\nGiven the challenges faced by colleges in pivoting to remote learning, we have partnered with Complete College America to engage six HBCUs in designing ways to strengthen digital learning within these institutions. The selected colleges and universities are helping to create a framework for evaluating—and changing—policies, practices, and perspectives to promote student success through digital learning that can be shared broadly throughout higher education. These efforts can help ensure that educational institutions are better prepared for future disruptions.\n\nThe funding our foundation is providing to speed the development of and expand access to diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines benefits everyone worldwide—including people in the U.S.\n\nAlong with Wellcome and Mastercard, we are a founding funder of the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator (CTA), which was launched in March 2020 to evaluate new and repurposed drugs to respond to COVID-19. It has funded research and development at various stages, including:\n\nRapid screening of millions of molecular compounds for potential use against COVID-19\n\nClinical trials to determine whether any existing drugs can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19\n\nData-sharing platforms to streamline global research collaboration on COVID-19 and build the foundation for better collaboration during potential future pandemics\n\nExpansion of the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) Trial, the world’s largest clinical trial for COVID-19 treatments, into more countries\n\nIn October 2021, we announced a commitment of up to $120 million to accelerate the availability of the novel antiviral therapy molnupiravir to lower-income countries, pending its authorization by regulatory authorities. A call-to-action for government donors to step up resources to scale up supply and delivery of the drug was included in the announcement.\n\nWe’ve also committed funds to support low-cost availability of other COVID-19 treatments, pending approval from regulators. This has included:\n\nA $40 million backstop guarantee to UNICEF to issue at-risk awards to manufacturers of novel COVID-19 oral antivirals\n\nFunding to the Africa Medical Supplies Platform to help purchase about 1 million courses of dexamethasone\n\nA partnership with Pfizer and Medicines for All Institute to help expedite the availability of Pfizer’s Paxlovid™ through generic manufacturers for use in low- and middle-income countries"
