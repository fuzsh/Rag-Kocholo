To speak the language of young people, we need to inhabit their spaces and understand negative cycles of behaviour and the risk of exploitation. We need to design youth-led interventions that address these problems at their roots, and offer genuine opportunity to thrive online. We’re excited to be working alongside Avast Foundation to develop a sector-leading approach to online social engagement and digital citizenship. We’ll be finding new ways for young people to thrive online, equipping them with the skills they need in an online world and preparing them to handle the challenges.”\n\nLearn more\n\nKat Dixon\n\nDirector of Partnerships, Catch22"
