        "text": "In the spirit of his film “We Must Help Ourselves,” the famous Czech film, television and theater director Jan Hřebejk has been our patron and supporter since the establishment of the Foundation. He helped us in the creation of our unique wine Cuvée A, and has even brought personal experience to the topic of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n„My father Kamil retired at the age of sixty-five, leaving a top position in Mototechna. He had a sense of humor and was looking forward to fishing ... Shortly afterwards came the first stroke and then another...\n\nAs a result, he contracted vascular dementia, which lasted seven years. This disease is very similar to Alzheimer's. It stole his memory and personality bit by bit, and caused great suffering for those around him as well. Although my mother, both sisters and their adult children, brother-in-law and my wife Lenka and I have a relatively large family, we did not manage without a caregiver and the occasional help of a facility, including the Sue Ryder Home. When Dad died, it was a relief for everyone, but at the same time, you can't help but feel guilty. It is difficult to cope with this type of disease and its consequences.\n\nThat is why I am in favor of supporting the projects of the Alzheimer's Foundation, because I know from my own experience how serious this problem is. We must help each other!“\n\nThe well known Czech writer and author of books for children of all ages, Ivona Březinová, encountered Alzheimer's disease while working on her book “Candy for Grandpa Ed.” Her awareness of the severity and prevalence of this disease led her to believe in the importance of combating it.\n\nHer book helps young readers understand the problems associated with Alzheimer's disease. The story of little Honzík and his especially forgetful great-grandfather brings together the coexistence of several generations in a family where mutual love, tolerance, and help are needed more than anywhere else.\n\n„I started to deal with the issue of Alzheimer's disease when I was collecting material for my book Candy for Grandpa Ed. There are some books that you write easily, others you write while chewing through stacks of professional texts, and others you simply can't put together without the help of well-informed professionals. This was the case with “Candy”. It is frightening how quickly the number of people affected by this disease is growing. I think we need to talk about it and write about it. But most of all, it is very good that there are organizations like the Alzheimer's Foundation, because just talking and writing is not enough.\n\nI hope this disease can be managed well one day, and that all the doctors and scientists who are supported by the Alzheimer's Foundation reach this goal as soon as possible.“\n\nWe regularly announce grants for young scientists, doctors and other professionals who research Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.\n\nDr. Jan Bureš Award for the Best Scientific Publication\n\nIn honor of Dr. Jan Bureš, one of the Czech Republic’s leading experts in the field of neurophysiology, the Alzheimer Foundation has awarded this prize annually since 2011 for the best professional scientific publication to young authors focused on Alzheimer’s disease and dementia in the fields of neurology, psychiatry, geriatrics, and neuroscience. The winning author’s team is awarded 40,000 Czech crowns.\n\nMore about the current year of competition here\n\nDr. Jan Bureš Scholarship Past Recipients\n\nScholarship for Mother-Scientists 2021\n\nThe aim of our Mother-Scientist project is to enable and encourage young mothers to continue moving forward in their scientific careers while raising children. Mother-Scientists in the Czech Republic face a difficult situation when combining a professional career with childcare. They are often at a disadvantage and fall into a vicious cycle because time does not allow them to become established scientists or lead their own research. In some cases, they may decide to leave their field entirely. Society loses very promising scientists who have decided to be mothers, but unfortunately did not receive enough support for their professional growth. With the generous financial support of the company MIBCON, we aim to at least partially help Mother-Scientists overcome this difficult cycle. Two women will be chosen annually to earn a grant of 160,000 Czech crowns each.\n\nMore information here\n\nSCHOLARSHIPS\n\nThanks to the generous support of the Abakus Foundation, a philanthropic trust created by the founders of Avast, we are preparing a new scholarship program in continuation of the AVAST Scholarship for the Human Brain.\n\nIf you would like to prepare an original application please contact us at: sekretariat@alzheimernf.cz\n\nAVAST Scholarship for the Human Brain - This is a joint educational scholarship program begun in 2013 by the Alzheimer's Foundation and financially\n\nsponsored by the AVAST Foundation. The aim of this program is to support research activities of students, doctoral students, young doctors and scientists under 40 years of age.\n\n2013-2019 Recipients of the AVAST Scholarship\n\nCompetitive grants are available for active participation in prestigious international conferences, support for publications, and lectures\n\nMore information here\n\nEliška and Zdeněk Strmiska Award – for significant contribution towards the research and treatment of Alzheimer´s disease\n\nSince 2017, thanks to the generous gift from Eliška Strmiska, the Alzheimer’s Foundation has given the Eliška and Zdeněk Strmiska Award to someone who has made an outstanding and significant contribution to the research and treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases. The winner receives 100,000 Czech crowns as an award for their work to date, and as motivation for the coming years. The application deadline is the end of October.\n\nMore about the current year here\n\nRecipients of the Strmiska Award\n\nAlzheimer Café\n\nThe Alzheimer Café concept originates from the Netherlands, and is an informal group meeting for caregivers of a person with Alzheimer's disease or for those who are in some way connected to the disease. Alzheimer Café is held on the first Tuesday of each month, starting at 6PM at Centrum Seňorina. Every meeting focuses on a different topic and features a guest speaker (physician, specialist, scientist, etc). This event has been sponsored in conjunction with the Seňorina Foundation since January 2017.\n\nFind out more about the project here:\n\nAlzheimer Café\n\nSeňorina Foundation\n\nSeňorina Center\n\nAlzheimer Point\n\nAlzheimer Point is a counseling center for caregivers and people with cognitive impairment. The aim of the center is to offer free professional counseling, advice, and support activities both for families that care for a loved one with dementia, and for people living with cognitive impairment. The Alzheimer Foundation fully funds Alzheimer Point in order to keep the services completely free for those who need it.\n\nMore about Alzheimer Point here\n\nBy applying for a grant or participating in one of our projects, you agree to the processing of personal data in accordance with the principles of personal data protection.
