        "text": "TargetCompany\n\nBy Trend Research\n\nWe detail everything you need to know about TargetCompany, a ransomware family with different monickers, including the evolution of its attack flow as it cemented its place in the threat landscape.\n\nView infographic of \"Ransomware Spotlight: TargetCompany\"\n\nThe TargetCompany ransomware was first detected in June 2021, when it was named by industry analysts after the pattern it adopted of appending its encrypted files with the name of the company it was targeting.\n\nIn an interview in January 2023, threat actors behind TargetCompany clarified that each major update of the ransomware entailed a change in the encryption algorithm and different decryptor characteristics. These are accompanied by a change in file name extensions, hence the evolution of names by which the ransomware group is known. We will discuss this evolution further in our blog entry.\n\nTargetCompany’s earlier variants provided a “.onion” contact site for negotiations and dropped ransom notes named How to decrypt files.txt. Meanwhile, later variants of the TargetCompany ransomware no longer use the name of the targeted enterprise as file name extensions. In mid- to late 2022, the group was given the name Fargo due to the extension that it added to its encrypted files in that period. extensions used by the ransomware group include “.mallox,” and “.xollam.” These later variants were observed using a combination of Chacha20, Curve 25519, and AES-128 algorithms to encrypt the victim’s files.\n\nThe ransomware group eventually established a data leak site under the name Mallox, and later variants dropped ransom notes as HOW TO RECOVER!!.txt.\n\nFor the purposes of this feature and to avoid confusion, we will refer to this piece of ransomware and the group behind it as TargetCompany.\n\nWhat organizations need to know about TargetCompany\n\nThe TargetCompany ransomware mostly launches attacks on vulnerable database servers. It implements reflective loading, where it connects to an IP address to download its payload. It is important to note that the contents of this IP address have been observed to only be available for approximately 24 hours, making it a challenge for threat analysts to replicate the infection for dynamic analysis.\n\nIn October 2022, our researchers caught a unique TargetCompany infection case from our internal telemetry data. This case relied on a different approach from previous infection chains and used different sets of defense evasion and reconnaissance tools, as well as remote access for execution.\n\nWe found that the aforementioned new approach entailed dropping the payload by first executing Remcos backdoor payload.\n\nThe Remcos backdoor payload is then executed via and the payload most likely arrives by exploiting public-facing websites and domains.\n\nMore recently, TargetCompany joined the current trend in phishing that involves using malicious OneNote files as an initial access technique to gain access to victim systems.\n\nThe TargetCompany ransomware gang comprises individualswho previously worked for other ransomware groups.In the same January 2023 interview, these members said they parted ways with their previous groups due to restrictions and inflexibility, which hindered their ability to make significant profits. According to the threat actors, TargetCompanyremains a small, closed group; however,Mallx, was observed recruiting affiliates for the Mallox ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate program.\n\nIt is also possible that TargetCompany has connections with other groups. While monitoring another group’s activities, we observed an attack that sharesTargetCompany’s behavior of downloading a PowerShell script from a command-and-control (C&C) remote server. In turn, this server is related to another piece of malware, the BlueSky ransomware.\n\nFurther investigation also links TargetCompany to threat actors that perform brute-force attacks on Microsoft SQL (MS SQL) Servers. Based on our research, these threat actors share several similarities with the group behind TargetCompany: Both have highly skilled Russian-speaking members who use advanced tactics to infiltrate MS SQL Servers, and both deploy Cobalt Strike and AnyDesk remote control through regasm.exe. Third, Anydesk.msi has also been observed as one of the contents of the open directory of TargetCompany’s C&C server. Notably, the linked threat actors also used this open directory.\n\nA group known as the BruteSQL ransomware has been identified as the culprit behind these brute-force attacks on MS SQL Servers. BruteSQL is known for deploying various types of ransomware in the past, such as the GlobeImposter ransomware in 2021, the LeakTheMall ransomware in 2022, and the BlueSky ransomware in July of the same year.\n\nWe also found that one of the excludedby the TargetCompany ransomware is TargetCompanyTargetCompany also uses an identical post-exploit command as the latter, the only difference being the C&C server used to download their respective payloads.\n\nIt is important to note that the piece of ransomware used by the TargetCompany actors was previously used by various other groups. In fact, the TargetCompany actors only purchased this piece of ransomware later on, after finding its foundations “impeccable.” Afterward, they then modified it to make it suitable for their operations.\n\nFigure 1.
