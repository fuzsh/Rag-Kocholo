        "text": "Avast and the Avast Foundation are proud of the countless members of our employee community who dedicate their time and resources to creating a safer, more inclusive and equitable future for all.\n\nAvastians tend to jump into action the moment crises affect their communities, and the Foundation is proud to support them in their efforts. Following a devastating tornado that affected a number of villages in South Moravia, Czech Republic, Avastians from the local office in Brno immediately organized colleagues to begin donating money and sharing ways to help. The Avast Foundation supported these efforts with a public fundraiser that aimed to quickly raise $30,000 USD. Within days, Avastians and their friends and family had exceeded the goal - ultimately raising $XX,000 USD within just 4 days! The Avast Foundation matched 5x the original fundraising goal, and 1x the additional funds collected - ultimately allowing the Avast community to provide $XXX,000 USD for direct aid to families impacted by the disaster.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, hundreds of Avastians supported non-profit organizations around the globe through a global donation plan. Our employees collected $121,430, matched 5 x by Avast to provide $728,579 to 11 organisations across the globe with significant funds to help local communities influenced by the pandemic.\n\nDuring the pandemic many Avastians volunteered in various activities. Some of them dedicated their free time to support local organisations, artists, helping most vulnerable ones and underprivileged communities. Number of employees engaged in expert volunteering, developing various apps and technologies, significantly helping Czech citizens to stay safe during COVID-19."
