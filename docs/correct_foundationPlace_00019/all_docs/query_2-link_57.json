        "text": "Non-Profit, The Shadowserver Foundation Launches Alliance to Continue to Build a Safer, More Secure Internet\n\nNew Alliance partner program will accelerate growth and scale up delivery of no cost cybersecurity and cyber threat intelligence services to internet defender organizations and law enforcement\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – October 4th, 2022 —The Shadowserver Foundation today announced a significant expansion to its freely provided internet security services with the launch of its Shadowserver Alliance. The Alliance enables partners, including some of the world’s most trusted organizations such as Mastercard, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Avast, Trend Micro and Akamai, to aid its mission to create a safer, more secure Internet.\n\nThe Shadowserver Foundation fulfills a special role in the cybersecurity ecosystem by supplying vital security information to internet defenders and law enforcement at no cost. As the largest provider of free, daily, baseline cyber threat intelligence to the world, Shadowserver has a proven track record of delivering high-quality, actionable, cyber threat intelligence for over 15 years. It supports more than 7000 organizations worldwide as a trusted, neutral third party – including 201 National CSIRTs across 175 countries & territories.\n\nShadowserver has mostly been funded by a series of one-off donations and sponsorships, as well as individual funded projects and service expansions. By partnering with leading organizations and individuals who share a belief in the importance of a free, open, secure Internet, the new Shadowserver Alliance will ensure that these essential cybersecurity services are financially sustainable and can continue to be enhanced.\n\nAlliance partners provide funding to enable the continued delivery of mutually beneficial, high quality, timely, actionable cyber threat intelligence, and essential public benefit services. This ensures that all network owners, national CSIRTs and other internet defenders can continue to receive and effectively act on a broad range of free, daily cyber threat intelligence.\n\nAlliance partner tiers also provide partners with several benefits – from access to discussion channels, collaboration opportunities and involvement in prioritizing which threats Shadowserver focuses on next, through to strategic governance and financial oversight roles at the highest Diamond Alliance tier.\n\nIn addition to ensuring the continued operation and enhancements of Shadowserver’s public benefit services, Alliance partners also help enable Shadowserver’s long history of providing free support for Law Enforcement in disrupting cybercrime:\n\n“Shadowserver is a valuable partner of INTERPOL in reducing the global impact of cybercrime and protecting communities for a safer world through our Gateway initiative,” said Craig Jones, Head of Cybercrime, Interpol. “As a not-for-profit organization, it shares its expertise, technology, and resources to address the challenges faced by law enforcement and society as a whole in countering and combating cybercrime. It is unique as it partners with law enforcement, national CSIRTs and network owners globally at no cost, providing information that allows them to better prevent, detect, investigate and disrupt cyber threats and cybercriminals.”\n\n“Shadowserver is among our key private sector partners assisting in our shared fight against cybercrime,” said FBI Cyber Division.\n\nAlliance partnerships help thousands of organizations and millions of Internet users globally every day – including each partner’s own organizations and countries. Together, Shadowserver Alliance partners jointly improve global cyber security and contribute to achieving a more stable, resilient, and secure Internet for all.\n\nFounding Alliance Partner and Selected Stakeholder Quotes:\n\n“It’s no exaggeration to say that Shadowserver has single handedly kept large parts of the internet safe, especially for those who otherwise could not protect themselves. This work directly aligns to Trend Micro’s mission, and we are proud to be a founding member of the Shadowserver Alliance. Partnering with others who are also working to make the digital world safer is the best way to make a true impact on cybercrime.” – Ed Cabrera, Chief Cybersecurity Officer, Trend Micro.\n\n“Our partnership with Shadowserver continues to be one of our most enduring and vital in the fight against cybercrime. Their unique capabilities help the NCSC defend the UK at scale and ensure we continue to make the UK the safest place to live and work online.” – Paul Chichester, Director of Operations, UK National Cyber Security Centre.\n\n“We are proud to be a founding member of the Shadowserver Alliance. At Mastercard, we work to ensure that everyone in our global digital ecosystem can interact and transact securely – Shadowserver helps to further that mission.” – Ron Green, Chief Security Officer, Mastercard.\n\n“We all need to work together to protect each other, and that’s particularly true on the Internet. Shadowserver discovers and disrupts lots of cybercriminal activities that threaten Internet users and helps us better defend ourselves against those threats. My support is part of mutual #CyberCivilDefense.” – Craig Newmark, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, Craigslist founder.\n\n“One of the objectives of CERT-EU is to detect as quickly as possible vulnerabilities and compromises regarding the ICT infrastructure of the 80+ EU institutions, bodies and agencies. We then work hand-in-hand with our constituents to address these issues and keep their assets secure. The Shadowserver Foundation is a non-profit organization that scans the entire IPv4 internet space daily and collects vast amounts of threat data. They create reports out of this data and provide them free of charge to organizations worldwide. The Shadowserver Foundation thus provides a very valuable public service. CERT-EU uses their actionable outputs intensively, as they help us maintain the networks of our constituents clean and safe.” – Saâd Kadhi, Head of CERT-EU, CERT for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies.\n\n“Shadowserver’s efforts to collect threat intelligence and build relationships with industry players, national governments and law enforcement are crucial in the fight against cybercriminals and nation-state groups. The more knowledge that is shared, the better we can all come together, to keep up with and catch threat actors, to help make the internet a safer place, and to safeguard people’s digital freedom. That’s why Avast believes in and supports Shadowserver’s cause, and for more than a decade, has partnered with Shadowserver to share intelligence.” – Jaya Baloo, Chief Information Security Officer, Avast.\n\n“Shadowserver is an essential part of the internet ecosystem to provide us and others information on threats, infections, and vulnerable systems to be aware of the current threat landscape and mitigate vulnerable systems and infections. Shadowserver’s data has proven to be unique and reliable and is an essential building block for us as NCSC-NL and for many other CSIRTs. I am sure that over the years Shadowserver has put a large dent in many threats and helped to prevent a large number of attacks and damage, and will continue to do so.” – Hielke Bontius, Head of Operations, Dutch National Cyber Security Center.\n\n“Shadowserver’s daily reports are invaluable to Akamai’s security team. We use them to supplement a range of tools to help secure our vast network in thousands of locations all over the world. Shadowserver’s work helps us fulfill our mission to power and secure life online for billions of users. Akamai is proud to support Shadowserver in providing this security benefit to the public.” – Boaz Gelbord, Senior Vice President and Chief Security Officer, Akamai.\n\n“The APNIC Foundation, together with APNIC, has been actively involved in promoting security and building capacity in the Asia Pacific region. We believe that cybersecurity challenges can only be effectively addressed through strong partnerships and community engagement. We value the collaboration with The Shadowserver Foundation as their work positively impacts the stability and security of the Internet, which aligns with our vision.” – Duncan Macintosh, CEO and Executive Director, APNIC Foundation.\n\n“Shadowserver has worked quietly behind the scenes for many years, keeping the Internet as we know it safe and secure – not just for those in the industry, but for everyone. It is vital work. We are incredibly proud to be an inaugural supporter of the Shadowserver Alliance and to extend Tucows’ expertise to help safeguard the Open Internet.” – Elliot Noss, CEO, Tucows.\n\n“CIRCL really loves the work done by Shadowserver. For the past years, the commitment and tenacity of the Shadowserver team helped many organizations to secure their infrastructure. We strongly believe in the Alliance model – especially when international collaboration is creating a real value to the whole community.” – Alexandre Dulaunoy, Head of CIRCL.\n\n“Shadowserver plays an important role in strengthening cyber security by providing essential services to map and measure the Internet and its threat landscape. We at GOVCERT.LU highly appreciate the continuous development of innovative ideas and collaboration on different levels. We recommend that national CERTs use the valuable data provided by Shadowserver.”\n\n“The collaboration of Shadowserver and the Swiss National Center for Cybersecurity NCSC has contributed significantly to improve the cybersecurity and resilience of Swiss networks and the whole Internet over the years. The actionable insight provided by Shadowserver on infections in Switzerland paired with the capabilities of the NCSC to support Swiss critical infrastructure allows a proactive approach to secure our constituents.” – Florian Schütz, Federal Cybersecurity Delegate.\n\n“We at CERT.at, the national CSIRT of Austria, see it as one part of our mission to reduce the number of infections, vulnerable systems, and misconfigurations on the Austrian Internet. The feeds we receive from Shadowserver provide the foundation of our situational awareness on network health and enable us to notify our constituency of issues inside their network.” – Otmar Lendl.\n\nJoin the Shadowserver Alliance\n\nThe Shadowserver Alliance is actively seeking new partners to join us now in the next phase of our journey.
