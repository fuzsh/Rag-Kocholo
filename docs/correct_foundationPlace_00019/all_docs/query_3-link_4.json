This marked the start of their fight against viruses and other malware, resulting in the birth of Avast Software s.r.o. Today, their pioneering software, Avast Antivirus, is trusted and used by millions of people worldwide to safeguard their computers and mobile devices.\n\nTo fully understand the ownership of Avast Antivirus, one needs to delve deeper into the corporate structure of its parent company. The company’s equity is primarily held by its founders and a significant share is publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange, making it a publicly owned entity.\n\nAdditionally, Avast has also made multiple acquisitions over the years, thereby expanding its product portfolio and market presence. One of the notable acquisitions includes AVG Technologies in 2016, which further strengthened the company’s antivirus software offerings.\n\nWhile Avast’s home base remains in Prague, Czech Republic, the company has established numerous offices across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, testament to its global expansion.\n\nSo, who owns Avast Antivirus now? Ultimately, it’s a combination of its founders, public investors, and its employees, as the company operates with a stock option plan for its employees.

They have been part of the same company since 2016 when Avast Software acquired AVG Technologies.

It’s a multinational cybersecurity software company headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic. Avast has more than 435 million monthly active users and the largest market share among anti-malware application vendors worldwide as of January 2021. The company was founded by Pavel Baudiš and Eduard Kučera in 1988.\n\nWhat company first developed Avast Antivirus?\n\nThe company that first developed Avast Antivirus is Avast Software. The company was formerly known as ALWIL Software, which was founded in Czechoslovakia in 1988.\n\nHas the ownership of Avast Antivirus changed over the years?\n\nYes, the ownership of Avast Antivirus has indeed changed over the years. Originally, Avast was founded by Eduard Kučera and Pavel Baudiš in 1988. Over the years, it went through several ownership changes. In 2010, a significant investment was made by Summit Partners, a private equity firm.\n\nThe company then went public on the London Stock Exchange in May 2018. Today, it is publicly traded and is not owned by any single entity but rather a multitude of shareholders who own its publicly-traded stock. In 2021, NortonLifeLock, a leading global cybersecurity company, proposed to acquire Avast. In October 2021, Avast agreed to a merger with NortonLifeLock, which is expected to close in Q1 2022 subject to regulatory approvals. This merger signifies another substantial change in the ownership pattern for Avast Antivirus.\n\nWhat stake does the original developer still hold in Avast Antivirus?\n\nThe original developer of Avast Antivirus is a company called Avast Software. The company, originally known as Alwil Software, was founded in 1988 by Pavel Baudis and Eduard Kucera in the Czech Republic.\n\nIn terms of stake, Avast Software is now a publicly traded company on the London Stock Exchange. This means that the original developers’ financial stake in the company would depend on the shares they hold. The specifics of how much stake Pavel Baudis and Eduard Kucera still hold in the company is not publicly disclosed.\n\nIt’s worth noting that in 2016, Avast Software acquired AVG Technologies, another antivirus software company, further expanding their market share and impact in the cybersecurity industry. Today, Avast Antivirus is one of the most popular antivirus software solutions worldwide, boasting over 435 million users.\n\nWhich organizations have shares in Avast Antivirus?\n\nThe Avast Antivirus is a product of Avast Software s.r.o. The organization’s largest shareholder, with reportedly over 30% of shares, is the Czech entrepreneur Pavel Baudis. Other primary shareholders include Summit Partners, CVC Capital Partners, and institutional investors after it went public on the London Stock Exchange. However, the exact distribution of shares may vary according to market conditions and recent transactions.\n\nHow have the changes in ownership impacted the development of Avast Antivirus?\n\nThe ownership changes of Avast Antivirus have had a significant impact on its development. In 2010, Summit Partners purchased a minority stake in the company. This injection of capital allowed for expanded research and development efforts, leading to product improvements and innovation.\n\nThen, in 2014, CVC Capital Partners acquired a majority stake. This not only provided additional financial resources but also strategic guidance from a globally recognized private equity firm with considerable software industry experience. It led to a period of rapid growth, enhanced product offerings, and improved user interfaces.\n\nPiriform’s acquisition by Avast in 2017 is another noteworthy event. Piriform is the developer of CCleaner, a popular PC cleaning tool. This move expanded Avast’s portfolio and strengthened its position in the market. It has significantly impacted the development of Avast Antivirus as it brought new features and tools related to performance optimization.\n\nHowever, the changes have not been without controversy. For instance, there were customer concerns about data privacy following the Piriform acquisition because a security breach occurred shortly after the deal was completed. Some users also reported increased commercialization within the software, including more pop-ups and ads.\n\nIn 2020, Avast ended its data collection practices after facing backlash over user privacy. The incident resulted in Avast making significant modifications to its software, focusing on enhanced user privacy and security.\n\nWho are the main shareholders of Avast Antivirus?"
