        "text": "Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture. One of the interesting things she spoke about was a simple yet profound interview question they always ask: \"What have you learned over the last six months?\" At first, it seemed almost trivial to me. But then I tried asking myself the same question, and I was surprised by how deeply it made me reflect. Here are the top three things I realized: 1. Identity vs. Title. Often, people treat me based on my title, not who I am as a person. Invitations and interactions are frequently tied to my role rather than my individual self. This realization highlighted the importance of keeping my ego in check and staying true to my personal identity. 2. Right Environment for Growth. Being in the right market - or right environment more generally - is crucial. While it's possible to navigate any setting, growth is significantly more challenging in a space with constant headwinds compared to a buoyant market. Finding the right environment can make a world of difference. 3. The Power of Helping Others. Many people around me lead incredibly tough lives. Helping even one person can be a more potent source of positive energy than most other activities in my daily work. This insight has encouraged me to be more mindful and proactive in offering support. I encourage you to ask yourself the same question. You may be surprised by what you discover! ‚ú®\n\nThe magic of new beginnings! ‚ú® After nearly three decades of tremendous growth and learning, the time has come for me to say goodbye to Avast/Gen. And what a ride it has been! Starting as a seven-person team in a communist-era ‚Äúpanelak‚Äù building on the outskirts of Prague back in 1995, Avast was more than just a workplace for me; it was a launching pad for dreams fueled by ambition. In those early days, as the internet began making its way into everyday life, we knew our work in cybersecurity was not just important. It was essential. I still vividly remember battling infamous viruses like ILoveYou, Nimda, Blaster, and CodeRed. Our small team‚Äôs software knocked out every single one of them, cold! We were unstoppable! My career evolved as the company expanded. From software developer to team lead, then chief architect, CTO, and COO, each role offered new challenges and opportunities. Ultimately, in 2019, I took the reins as CEO. By then, Avast was already a force to be reckoned with, publicly listed, employing over 1,500 staff across 20+ locations, and serving 400M+ users globally. Stepping into the CEO role brought its own set of challenges, especially with the onset of the Covid pandemic. Adapting to a radically shifting world, I made some difficult decisions to ensure our resilience and continued growth, always striving to uphold our core values and maintain team spirit. A pivotal moment occurred when Vincent Pilette and I began discussing the possibility of merging Avast with NortonLifelock. What started as an informal chat between two newly appointed first-time CEOs resulted in a multi-billion dollar deal in September 2022 and the formation of Gen. This merger was not only a strategic achievement but a personal milestone as well. During the three years of my tenure as CEO, Avast's stock price more than tripled ‚Äì a clear indicator of our collective success. After establishing Gen, I remained in the role of President, focusing on ensuring a smooth integration of our combined strengths. However, that work is now complete, and that effectively concludes my mission here. Thinking about the whole journey fills me with a myriad of emotions and cherished memories. But the best part has always been the people. Throughout my tenure, I had the privilege of working alongside some of the most talented and dedicated individuals, whose passion and commitment have been nothing short of inspiring. So, to my amazing teams ‚Äì past and present ‚Äì THANK YOU for your unwavering support, camaraderie, and so many unforgettable victories. You have my deepest admiration and respect! My heart today is full of gratitude and excitement. While closing one chapter, I eagerly anticipate the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Here‚Äôs to new beginnings! It's time to build again -- so buckle up and LFG! üí•üí™üöÄ --- Special thanks to: Pavel Baudis Eda Kucera John Schwarz Vince Steckler Vincent Pilette\n\nThe AI race continues... üöÄ Executives at Microsoft and OpenAI have been drawing up plans for a data center project that would include a supercomputer with millions of specialized server chips to power OpenAI's artificial intelligence. The project could cost as much as $100 billion, or about 100 times the cost of some of today's largest data centers, demonstrating the enormous investment that may be needed to build computing capacity for AI in the coming years. The proposed U.S.-based supercomputer, called \"Stargate\", could be launched as early as 2028, and is a critical part of OpenAI's quest for artificial general intelligence (AGI). According to people involved in the discussions, the supercomputer will require up to 5 gigawatts of power, leading the project team to turn to nuclear energy. This is not a completely new concept, however, as last year Amazon purchased a data center in Pennsylvania that is connected directly to a nuclear power plant. Previously, Sam Altman has also said that the development of superintelligence will likely require a significant energy breakthrough. We certainly live in interesting times! üòä\n\nOpenAI just announced Sora, a new tool capable of creating realistic videos from text instructions. https://openai.com/sora It was encouraging to read that in this endavor, OpenAI is partnering with security researchers who will be adversarially testing the model, and that all content generated by the model will contain C2PA metada (https://c2pa.org). With that said, many concerns remain about how these safety measures can be bypassed and how this technology might be misused, especially in the hands of sophisticated adversaries. Gen is commited to fighting the problem and is building technology solutions to allow people take full advantage of the digital world -- safely, privately, and confidently. -- Prompt used in the below video: \"A cat waking up its sleeping owner demanding breakfast. The owner tries to ignore the cat, but the cat tries new tactics and finally the owner pulls out a secret stash of treats from under the pillow to hold the cat off a little longer.\""
