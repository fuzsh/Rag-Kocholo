        "text": "“Once we have automated canary analysis, it’s going to sell itself. Everybody wants that.”\n\n– David Byron, Avast\n\nDavid’s team faced the challenge of learning Kubernetes and Spinnaker simultaneously. “When we migrated to the Kubernetes V2 provider, that’s when the engineering organization got into Spinnaker, started using it, and started making and running pipelines.” There was a steep learning curve, but for David, “We’re getting there. It’s just trying to teach people to know what’s going on so they have a chance to figure it out themselves.”\n\nCounterintuitively, David feels that he could have made adopting Spinnaker easier on his team by requiring them to learn more on their own. Early on, he wrote a tool for his engineers to generate pipeline JSON because the SPIN CLI was new and not fully mature. According to David, “I made a company-specific, opinionated tool and custom DSLs that were supposed to make people’s lives easier but in the end, it covered up some details of Spinnaker that I wish I had asked people to learn.”\n\nInfrastructure teams also use Spinnaker to manage cluster-wide Kubernetes resources, often exploring parts of Spinnaker and passing on that knowledge to more product-focused teams.\n\nDavid and his team have become active members in the Spinnaker community, participating in the 8,000-person strong (and growing!) Spinnaker Slack channel, asking and answering questions, and helping to surface issues. They have also begun to contribute to the OSS code base, and David is a member of the Kubernetes SIG.\n\nWhat’s next\n\n“We’re headed to automated canary analysis,” says David. His team uses Datadog as their metrics aggregator, and they intend to feed that data into Spinnaker for automated canary analysis.\n\nIf you’re looking to learn more about the potential Spinnaker has to transform your business’ approach to app or microservice deployment, be sure to explore www.spinnaker.io to connect with our rich knowledge base of how-to guides and success stories."
