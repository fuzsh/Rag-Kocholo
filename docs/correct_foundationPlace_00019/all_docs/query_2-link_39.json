        "text": "Individuals and businesses alike are looking for ways to keep their data safe when browsing or working online. A virtual private network (VPN) is one of the best solutions. ExpressVPN and Avast SecureLine VPN are secure, fast and reliable VPNs that can work for personal or professional use, but one may be better suited to your needs. We compared Avast SecureLine VPN vs ExpressVPN based on features, pricing and more to help you decide which is the best for you.\n\nAvast SecureLine VPN vs. ExpressVPN: At a Glance\n\nAvast offers several privacy and security tools, most notably its antivirus software. Its VPN is a single product for those who want to connect to a server to protect their internet activity and mask their IP. It’s affordable and allows you to connect up to ten devices on one account.\n\nExpressVPN is a leader in the VPN world. It’s a popular choice because it’s reliable, offers fast connection and it has servers in 94 countries. All subscribers get an ad blocker as a bonus, but all the choices and features add up to a premium price—ExpressVPN is one of the most expensive options.\n\nFEATURED PARTNER OFFER\n\nAvast SecureLine VPN\n\n2.3\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPricing (annual)\n\nINR 4,996.03 ($59.88)\n\nDevices (max)\n\nTen\n\nServer locations\n\n34\n\nPricing (annual)\n\nINR 4,996.03 ($59.88)\n\nDevices (max)\n\nTen\n\nServer locations\n\n34\n\nWhy We Picked It\n\nYou may know Avast for its security tools, such as antivirus software, but it also provides a VPN service. Avast SecureLine VPN is strictly for protecting your active data online—there are no added features. However, it’s an affordable option. You get three term length choices: the first year at INR 4996.03 ($59.88), the first two years for INR 7,989.64 ($95.76), or pay INR 11,984.47 ($143.64) for the first three years of service.\n\nThe big benefit to using Avast SecureLine VPN is that you can connect up to 10 devices on one account, which makes it a good choice for a family or even a small business. Avast SecureLine VPN works on the most common platforms and operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows and Mac. If you have an Android smart TV, you can now use Avast on it, too. There’s no specific support for routers or Linux, though.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nAffordable plans\n\nDeeper discount for long-term contracts\n\nUse on ten devices\n\nNo added features\n\nDoesn’t work for Linux users\n\nVery few server locations\n\nFEATURED PARTNER OFFER\n\nExpressVPN\n\n3.2\n\nOur ratings take into account a product's cost, features, ease of use, customer service and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.\n\nPricing (annual)\n\nINR 6,678.06 ($80.04)\n\nDevices (max)\n\nFive\n\nServer locations\n\n94\n\nPricing (annual)\n\nINR 6,678.06 ($80.04)\n\nDevices (max)\n\nFive\n\nServer locations\n\n94\n\nWhy We Picked It\n\nExpressVPN is a well-known VPN service that offers one of the most comprehensive server location lists around—it has servers in 94 countries. Another benefit of using ExpressVPN is that you can use it on almost any device, including routers. You can configure the service to work on your home router, which will help you protect all your smart home devices at once. Additionally, ExpressVPN gives all subscribers an ad blocker, so you can prevent social media and snooping websites from targeting you for specific ads.\n\nAll these features come at a cost, though. ExpressVPN costs INR 6,678.06 ($80.04) per year, or INR 556.51 ($6.67) per month when paid annually (with three months added for free). You can also get a slight discount for a six-month contract and pay just INR 833.51 ($9.99) per month, if paid biannually or INR 5,001.04 ($59.94 total). You’ll only be able to connect up to five devices on one subscription, though.\n\nPros & Cons\n\nUse on routers\n\nIncludes ad blocker\n\nOffers 94 server locations\n\nExpensive plans\n\nOnly live chat support\n\nSupport only five devices\n\nHow Avast SecureLine VPN vs. ExpressVPN Stack Up\n\nWhen comparing Avast SecureLine VPN vs. ExpressVPN, we considered more than pricing, but it’s a good place to start. Avast SecureLine VPN’s annual plan is far more affordable than ExpressVPN—you’ll save more than INR 3,337.36 ($40). It’s important to also consider whether you can use the VPN service on your devices. ExpressVPN works on more platforms than Avast SecureLine VPN.\n\nAvast SecureLine VPN allows you twice as many connected devices as ExpressVPN, but remember that ExpressVPN lets you connect your router to a VPN, so you could cover a lot of devices with a protected home network. ExpressVPN really pulls ahead with 50 more server locations than Avast—that means far more choice for where you want to connect.\n\nBoth VPN services give you a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you aren’t satisfied with the speed of the service or server locations (or anything, really), you can get a refund in that month-long window. They also offer 24/7 customer support, but Avast offers phone support, which isn’t common among VPN services.\n\nNote: We didn’t include a comparison of security protocols used because what’s most important is that VPN services use industry-standard AES 256-bit keys, which both Avast SecureLine VPN and ExpressVPN do.\n\nAll-in-One Protection\n\nAlthough neither VPN service offers malware protection as a feature or an add-on, Avast does have a separate product that combines its antivirus software with a built-in VPN known as Avast One. If you’re looking to protect both online activity and what you download or click on, this might be a better choice for you. ExpressVPN offers nothing like this.\n\nAd Blocker\n\nExpressVPN includes an ad blocker that the company has labeled as a threat manager. What it does is block sites from using trackers on you, so you should stop getting those related ads that tend to pop up on your social media feeds. Essentially, this is a DNS blocker. Avast SecureLine VPN doesn’t include this feature.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIn our comparison of Avast SecureLine VPN vs. ExpressVPN, Forbes Advisor suggests ExpressVPN for most users. Although ExpressVPN is a much pricier choice, it offers global server coverage, which can unlock more content for you. You can connect your home router to a VPN and use the included ad blocker to gain more privacy, too. Avast SecureLine VPN is good for those who want nothing more than a secure and reliable VPN at a lower price.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)"
