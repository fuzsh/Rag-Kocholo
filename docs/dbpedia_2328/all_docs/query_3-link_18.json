When you enroll in any course, you become part of a supportive community made up of musicians and music professionals from around the world. Students regularly get feedback and contribute to each other. Some students even end up collaborating with each other.\n\nOutside of the community, that is accessible 24 hours a day, we offer live Q&As with our instructors and with industry professionals, to help guide you on your career in the new music business.\n\nIn select courses, ATA Students have the ability to showcase their music in front of industry professionals. This includes sync agencies, college booking agencies, and special events agencies."
