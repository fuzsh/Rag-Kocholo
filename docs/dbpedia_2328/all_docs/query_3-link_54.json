        "text": "Ari Fleisher manages visioning and operations for the NH UDL Innovation Network. She supports educators in exploring how UDL can help to further meaningful learning in their classrooms. Ari facilitates small and large teams as they identify barriers and design strategic, intentional ways to make learning more effective and inclusive.\n\nThrough her previous work with curriculum, school climate and culture, and social-emotional learning, Ari has loved to see learning environments come alive, both in and out of classrooms. Ari believes that UDL can help to deepen studentsâ€™ excitement about learning, sparking that innate joy of discovering something new. She is thrilled to be spreading UDL to help students, educators, schools and systems set up for long-term success.\n\nAri enjoys camping, biking and singing.\n\nEducation"
