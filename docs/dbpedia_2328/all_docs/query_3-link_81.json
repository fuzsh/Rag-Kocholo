        "text": "ARI manufactures advanced quality valves utilizing the latest state of the art manufacturing technology at three different locations: Schloss Holte-Stukenbrock, Homberg (Efze)-Holzhausen and Halle an der Saale. For us at ARI \"Made in Germany\" is our commitment to providing you with the very best of quality manufacturing.\n\nOur production processes are organised in specialised sections, which enable us to comply with our customers' requirements optimally in small, powerful and effective units. Our aim is to build lasting business relationships by combining speed, expertise and reliability with premium quality.\n\nWe are engaged in a continuous endeavour to improve our processes, products and services (CIP).\n\nThe close interaction between sales and customer service staff and our engineering office helps us maintain a sharp focus on our customers at all times.\n\nRegular further training and qualification opportunities are provided to our dedicated team of employees. Our staff are motivated to deliver peak performances by a combination of individual development prospects and maximum design freedom. In this way, we protect our company's most important resource â€“ the people who work for us.\n\nWebster, Texas\n\nIn June 2016 ARI-USA moved into its newly built, modern building to be close to the NASA Space Center in the technology center of Webster, Texas. Here ARI customers benefit from a significantly larger storage facility, comprehensive schooling/service area. Besides valves, systems for steam and condensate management are now being offered.\n\nSchloss Holte-Stukenbrock\n\nOur headquarters in Schloss Holte-Stukenbrock (north-west Germany) cover an area of more than 50,000 square metres. In addition to Production, the main facility also houses our Purchasing, Sales, Quality Management, Engineering Office and IT departments. This convenient location with its excellent transport links is the hub from which we ship to thirteen branch offices and sales partners in more than fifty countries worldwide.\n\nHomberg (Efze)-Holzhausen\n\nOur Homberg (Efze) branch was opened in February 1969. Approximately 130 of its staff are specialised in the manufacture of valves with large nominal diameters up to DN 500. They are also responsible for valves with butt weld ends bigger than DN 15 as well as butterfly valves from DN 250 to 600.\n\nHalle an der Saale\n\nOur facility in Halle an der Saale was established in 1878 as \"Hallesche Maschinen- und Dampfkessel-Armaturenfabrik Dicker & Werneburg\". It joined the ARI group in 1999. It is an independent subsidiary employing around 70 staff, who manufacture steam traps as well as compact manifolds for collecting and distributing various fluids up to PN 630 / Class 2500 according to DIN and ASME in a 5000 square meter production facility. These products add value to the ARI group's entire portfolio."
