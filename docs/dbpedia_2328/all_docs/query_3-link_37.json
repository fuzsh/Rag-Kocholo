Their soothing, peaceful and playful presence was a buoy when my psychic ship finally capsized after years of hurried fixes. Ari created a loving space for me to explore the deep recesses of my history and ideate in the future. Through a practice that is so uniquely Ari, I found confusion turning to clarity; repression overcome by honesty. Ari has this intuitive mirror that reflects and refracts back, and also isn’t afraid to reach out and call you out on some BS. Words can’t truly capture how much I recommend their service to any seekers or explorers on their own path.”\n\n– MICHAEL T.\n\n\"Ari is a remarkably talented facilitator. Ari creatively taps into deep sensory connection among members of a group or around a topic of interest, resulting in meaningful social connectedness and outcomes rooted in compassion, empathy, safety, and trust. Their engagement process is thought-provoking, honest, and welcoming of a diversity of thought that leads to enriched conversations and innovative results. Any client looking for genuine discourse, mindful feedback, and useful dialogue would benefit from Ari’s empowering and masterful skills.\"\n\n— ROBYN EASON, FMR. SUSTAINABILITY LEAD,\n\nCITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD\n\n“I sought out Ari as a coach because I want to transform myself and the world for the better, but I sometimes get in my own way. Coach Ari helped me see things about myself that I knew were there, but was maybe a little too scared to look at. Thanks to their loving and grounded presence, our sessions consistently led to breakthroughs and paradigm shifts that have helped me level up in my life and my work. I highly recommend getting support from Ari if you've got big dreams, but struggle with fear, self doubt, and self sabotage. You don't have to fight those spiritual battles alone!”\n\n– NICOLE D\n\n“Ari led the type of group that I wish went on forever. Our meetings were tender, expansive, and vulnerable. I was often in awe of Ari's ability to gracefully guide discussions and hold space for everyone's unique contributions. I grew so much just from listening to others and am forever grateful for the experience.”\n\n– GRETCHEN, WORKSHOP PARTICIPANT\n\n“I am so appreciative of Ari’s grace at teaching about the layers of dealing with grief in the workplace. They create comfortable spaces for colleagues to be vulnerable and open up about the emotional toll work can have on a public servant. I received a lot of gratitude and affirmation from Grief at Work participants on the importance of creating more of these offerings.”\n\n– UYEN NGO, VISION ZERO PROGRAM MANAGER, SFMTA (SF MUNI)\n\n\"Ari is one of the most thoughtful facilitators that I have ever had the privilege of working with. They encourage stakeholders to bring their whole selves to their professional work – and Ari is the living, breathing embodiment of this principle. Ari knows when it’s time to roll up their sleeves, and works hard – not just to faithfully document the spoken and written word, but also the emotion and intent behind it.”\n\n– CHRIS RHIE, FOUNDER, RHIE PLANNING LLC\n\n“Ari scooped me up at a time when I really needed some guidance on how to identify my priorities and better advocate for myself during a job transition. Working with Ari really helped me understand my internal driving forces and underlying thought processes circulating around the decisions I was facing. Surfacing these brought me much needed clarity and invited me to think critically about whether some of my patterns are really serving me. Ari's approach was playful, flexible, and challenging at the same time. Our work together pushed and inspired me in ways that I'm incredibly grateful for.”\n\n– C.J.\n\n“Working with Ari has helped broaden my perspective on what our organization is capable of. It has also helped me gain some much-needed clarity about my own leadership role in the group. With Ari’s approach, we work extensively towards the organization’s collective goals, and we also work on how I, on an individual level, am showing up for myself and my team.”\n\n– MICHAEL ALFERA, ARTS NONPROFIT EXEC DIR\n\nLet’s connect.\n\nReach out below:\n\nEmail *\n\nSubject *\n\nMessage *\n\nThank you!"
