        "text": "\"ARI has changed the game for us. The recruiting/roster/team management capabilities within ARI has made it a must for my program. The hands on training, and quick personal customer support makes it a no brainer choice when it comes to athletics databases. The system is intuitive, easy to use, and for Power Users it is dynamic enough to really make it your own!‚Äù\n\nSteve Paternostro (Ottawa University)\n\n\"ARI has provided amazing customer service as our program made the transition to their platform. Recruit profile information, interactions and admissions information is all very easy to find within the prospective student athlete profile. I also really appreciate that you can customize your view to make it work for you and what your staff needs to stay organized. Our CS rep. Sinead is awesome!\"\n\nMary Johnson from Macalester\n\n\"We are very happy with ARI and all the capabilities it has. It has helped us navigate our recruiting class with ease and cut done on the amount of time and work we previously had to do to maintain communication and information on our recruits. It is so easy to use the app on the road as well and makes scouting super easy and productive. We look forward to continuing our use of ARI and are excited for how it can help our program grow!\"\n\nWill Bernhardt, Wabash College - Swimming and Diving"
