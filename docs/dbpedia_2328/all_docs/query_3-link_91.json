The air flow lab was designed and operates according to the ISO 17025 global standard and was adapted to meet the ISO 9001 quality standard and the ISO 14001 environmental standard. Bench test assessments are carried out according to worldwide testing standards as well as the European standard EN 1074. The initial calibration for the air flow lab was based on results from the CESAME (France) High Pressure Test Bench used for flow calibration and testing. This lab calibrates large diameter gas meters based on the principle of the ORIFICE PLATE.\n\nThe A.R.I. air flow laboratory performs assessments of air flow rates during intake and discharge, air flow tests for air valve premature closure as well as a vacuum bench test which tests the flow rate for air intake into air valves when the pipeline is under negative pressure.\n\nThese tests are carried out and calculated in accordance with international standards for moisture and temperature variables.\n\nThe air flow laboratory tests all types of air valves (air release, air & vacuum, combination, non-slam, one-way etc.) that operate on water and wastewater systems and are in the diameter range of 1/2\" to 12\".\n\nThe air flow laboratory employs 4 air storage tanks, each one with a volume capacity of 10 cubic meters, plus an additional 10 cubic meter air tank that is employed as the working tank.\n\nThe air is stored at 13 bar of pressure and enables testing of air valves up to 12\" in diameter and, with an additional compressor, enables automatic air valves to be tested at a pressure of 16 bars.\n\nThe air flow laboratory is computerized; therefore, once the characteristics of the tested air valves are entered in the computer and the air valve is connected to the test bench, the test is run. At its conclusion, the test reports are immediately available on the computer without further processing.\n\nThe air flow lab is open to invited guests and trainees, who are able to view the testing and receive the results in real time, either viewed on a large screen or printed as a hard copy.\n\nA Professional Coatings Factory\n\nIn early 2010, A.R.I opened up a new coatings factory for the fusion bonded coating process of all A.R.I products. The equipment was purchased specifically for the A.R.I. Coatings Factory.
