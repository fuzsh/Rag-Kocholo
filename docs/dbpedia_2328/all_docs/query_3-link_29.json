        "text": "Biography\n\nAri Ginsberg is professor of entrepreneurship and management at NYU's Stern School of Business, and former Chair of the Management and Organizations Department and Director of the Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. He holds an Affiliate Professor appointment in the Technology Innovation and Management Department at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering, where he previously served as Academic Director of the Management of Technology Master of Science Program. Dr. Ginsberg teaches courses on business strategy analysis, new enterprise development, corporate venturing and innovation, and commercialization of frontier technology.\n\nAs inaugural head of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation area at the Stern School of Business in 2000, he brought together a group of faculty from a variety of disciplines collectively interested in advancing research and education on innovation and entrepreneurship. As part of this initiative, he introduced an MBA degree specialization in entrepreneurship and innovation and founded a co-curricular new venture development program that provided students and alumni with workshops, mentoring and seed funding provided through a business plan competition.\n\nOver the last decade, he has worked on curriculum development initiatives that integrate technology innovation with entrepreneurship and commercialization. These include designing an executive education program to prime seasoned managers to lead clean energy projects in New York City's key industries; serving on NYU’s Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship committee to advance innovation and entrepreneurship education throughout the university, and creating courses that enable Stern graduate students to access makerspace and technology development labs at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering and to work together with graduate engineering students to acquire the knowhow necessary to commercialize frontier technologies successfully.\n\nProfessor Ginsberg's current research focuses on understanding how corporate venturing activities facilitate organizational growth and profitability, how dynamic capabilities and organizational agility facilitate sustained competitive advantage, and how organization ecosystems facilitate company and industry renewal. He has published numerous articles in leading scholarly journals and is the recipient of multiple academic awards for his work on entrepreneurial strategies and the management of innovation and change. He has also served on the editorial boards of the top academic journals in the field of business administration, including the Academy of Management Review, the Journal of International Business, Organization Science, and the Strategic Management Journal.\n\nDuring his tenure at New York University, Professor Ginsberg has been the recipient of several honors, including the Citibank Excellence in Teaching Award, the Peter Drucker Fellowship, and the Harold Price Entrepreneurship and Innovation Professorship.\n\nProfessor Ginsberg received his MBA and Ph.D. in Strategic Planning and Policy from the University of Pittsburgh as well as a Master's Degree in Human Learning and Cognition from Columbia University."
