        "text": "As a working, independent musician, I understand you.\n\nI am you. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to distill all of the information not just for my music career, but more importantly, for yours. Through interviewing hundreds of movers and shakers of the industry and other successful musicians, I am passing along everything I’ve learned in a very intimate way.\n\nArisTake.com has little tidbits which are helpful, sure. My book, How To Make It in the New Music Business has a solid overview of everything you need to know. But these are just starting points. Jumping off points.\n\nI have broken down everything you need to know and master to become a star in your hometown and book full-fledged national tours.\n\nIf you want to sell out venues not just in your hometown, but all over the country, this course is for you. I know, not everyone wants to tour, and that’s fine. But what I’ve realized is that there are tons of incredible musicians who have built up hardcore fanbases online who would love to see them live, but have no idea how to book a tour to reach them. And there are even more musicians who are insanely talented, but cannot, for the life of them, figure out how to get people to their shows.\n\nThis is why I created this course. I am going to guide you through this and be with you every step of the way. Whether you have tens of thousands of fans online or 0 fans online, this course will help you. Whether you can draw 1,000 people locally or 10 people locally, this course will help you.\n\nTime Management\n\nI know one of the biggest pain points for musicians is time management. How do you balance your business with your music (and possibly your day job)? How do you balance the money gigs with the career building gigs? How do you make sure you’re working smarter, not harder?\n\nI have put together time management tools to keep you focused and on track, including sample calendars, to-do lists, checklists, spreadsheets and other resources to make sure you move forward, not sideways.\n\nConnections To The Industry\n\nI know that most musicians don’t have connections to the industry. I do. I will be bringing in some experts on booking and touring for live Q&As and interviews.\n\nJoining Our Community\n\nOne of the best aspects of this course is the community you will become a part of. We will have a private, members-only Facebook group which all students will be a part of to ask fellow members questions, get feedback on their work, get (and give) encouragement and be held accountable.\n\nStaying Inspired\n\nI want every person who joins the course to succeed. Nothing will bring me more joy than to hear about your successes. And I guarantee you will have them. If you’re ever feeling overwhelmed or lost, we are here for you.\n\nKeeping Up With Changes in the Field\n\nIt’s hard to keep up with all the new changes in the music business and even more difficult to know what you need to do to make sure you stay on top of everything. I (along with my team) are staying on top of everything so you don’t have to. The group will help you keep up with the changes and we will all keep each other up to date with the best new tools and strategies for success.\n\n“The poster child of DIY Music” – Forbes\n\nAri Herstand is the CEO and founder of the music business education and artist advocacy company, Ari’s Take. Started in 2012 as a blog, Ari’s Take has become the go-to resource for independent musicians on how to run a successful music career in the NEW music business. He is also the author of the best-selling book, How To Make It in the New Music Business which is a #1 Amazon best-seller in 3 categories and has been adopted by over 300 universities and translated into multiple languages. Herstand’s well-researched, relatable, no BS approach is why so many musicians continue to trust him for advice. He offers encouragement without condescension and maintains a “we’re all in it together” attitude not found elsewhere in the space.\n\nHe is also the host of the Webby Award winning podcast, The New Music Business Podcast where he interviews innovators and experts in the music industry. Since its launch in March of 2020, over 1 million people have listened to the show.\n\nAn independent musician who has played over 1,000 shows around the country, he has performed on Ellen, has had his music featured in countless TV shows, commercials and films, and has charted in the top 10 on iTunes. He currently leads the immersive funk/soul concert experience Brassroots District.\n\nHerstand has written for many of the top musician trade magazines and websites including Variety, Music Connection Magazine, American Songwriter, Digital Music News, Playback Magazine, CD Baby, Tunecore, Roland, Discmakers, ASCAP, Hypebot and others. He has been a featured speaker at SXSW, Music Biz, BBC One’s Amplify, NAMM, ASCAP Music Expo, SF MusicTech, CD Baby’s DIY Musician Conference, UCLA, Berklee College of Music and in music business classrooms worldwide."
