        "text": "Singer-songwriter Ari Hest says oftentimes, the instrument you don't play well winds up becoming your favorite.\n\nHe says that is what tends to happen when he puts down his guitar and puts his fingers to work on a piano.\n\n\"As a piano player, I'm nothing special,\" Hest says. \"I can write a song on it and it can turn out great because I don't think too hard (about it).\"\n\nThough he enjoys flip-flopping between the two instruments, Hest says he will be playing mostly guitar when he performs Saturday in the Gold Room at the Grand Eastonian Suites Hotel in Easton. The concert is part of Easton-based Mercantile Home's Distinctive Music Series.\n\n\"I first heard Ari when I was living in New York,\" says Mercantile Home co-owner Ron Morris. \"I always heard little bits of his music and I had friends who covered some of his songs.\"\n\nMorris adds, \"He's a really high-caliber singer-songwriter and I'm really excited to be a part of bringing him to Easton. I think it's going to a great show and experience for those who come to check it out.\"\n\nHest says he will be debuting new material during the performance. His most recent studio effort is 2012's \"The Fire Plays.\"\n\n\"The new material is a little more folky, a little more centered around the guitar playing and maybe more of a sort of folk format,\" he says. \"I think it's a natural shift, for really no particular reason.\"\n\nHest admits the new tunes may have been inspired by his recent tour opening for Judy Collins. (Collins performed at the Eastonian in 2010.) Some of the songs, Hest says, were written while on the tour.\n\n\"She is still a monster singer at (age) 74,\" Hest says of Collins. \"She has just like a tireless energy about her and her music.\"\n\nHest's resume, besides touring with Collins, includes a unique project in which he wrote a new song every week for 52 weeks. Each song was put online and available for purchase.\n\nHest says, overall, he was happy with the way the project and the music turned out, though there were a few songs he feels weren't up to snuff. He says the pressure he felt to come up with a new song every week for an entire year was self-imposed.\n\n\"I said to myself before starting, I knew there would not be a way for all of these songs to be keepers,\" Hest says. \"It was more of a project than to come up with 52 amazing songs ...There are definitely some I'd like to have back.\"\n\nHest says he is not opposed to tackling another, similar, endeavor, but played coy when asked what was next.\n\n\"I've kind of given myself a little bit of a rest as far as recording,\" Hest says. \"I'm used to putting out something new quite often. Right now, I'm just focusing on writing at a natural pace.\"\n\n***\n\nSinger-songwriter Ari Hest performs 8 p.m. Saturday in the Gold Room at The Grand Eastonian Suites Hotel, 140 Northampton St., Easton.\n\nTickets cost $18. They can be purchased at The Mercantile Home, 140 Northampton St., Easton."
