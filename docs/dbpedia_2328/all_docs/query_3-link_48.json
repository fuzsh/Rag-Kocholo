        "text": "I am originally from Mill Valley, California just north of San Francisco. Iâ€™m excited to be coming back to California and to continue my passionate career of golf instruction at Willowick!\n\nAs a multi-sport athlete growing up, I did not get into golf until age 14. I was named team captain of my high school golf team as a junior, made all-league teams three years and won the league championship individual title senior year. I would go on to play NCAA collegiate golf at Occidental College in Los Angeles, where again I was named team captain as a junior.\n\nAs a coach, I believe in an individualized and holistic approach. I have a passion for helping players of all ages and levels achieve their best and have a variety of tools to help each student. This includes incorporating modern technology (i.e., Trackman, Sportsbox 3D) with old-school fundamentals, health and fitness, course management, and mental game coaching. I enjoy introducing new players to the game, as well as coaching more experienced golfers looking for that competitive edge."
