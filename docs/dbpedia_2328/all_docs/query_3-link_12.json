        "text": "This month my employer, ARI (Automotive Resources International), was named to Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work for” list for the fifth year in a row. It’s an incredible honor to have bestowed upon the company and everyone throughout the various ARI offices is swelling with pride and patting each other on the back. Last year, when we found out we had made the list for the fourth time, I was a new employee that couldn’t help but ask the questions, “What’s the big deal?” and “So what?” It’s great that our company is a cool place to work, that we have fun office events, and we feel cared for by leadership, but how does being a great place to work translate into doing our jobs better and delivering a higher level of service to our customers? Over the last year I have witnessed the answers to those questions in many forms.\n\nPeople Want to Work Here…Forever = Experience\n\nBeing part of the millennial generation, known for our short attention spans and job hopping, I was amazed at how many people I met at ARI who had been here 10, 20, or even 30+ years. There is an amazing loyalty to the company, which breeds an incredible amount of experience. When employees aren’t leaving the company for greener grass (because this is the greenest grass), you develop and retain the experts in the field. This expertise means that our customers have access to many of the top professionals in the fleet world. For example, 40% of the world’s top technicians (as rated by Auto Service Excellence) work for ARI and have an unheard of turnover rate of less than 3%. This means our customers get a consistently high level of expertise and experience that’s unmatched in the industry. From Licensing to Account Management to Sales and more, this loyalty, experience, and expertise is exhibited throughout ARI.\n\nPeople like working with each other = Partnership\n\nHaving come from a different industry where I operated within the confines of my job responsibilities and didn’t interact with many other employees, ARI’s emphasis on teamwork was a pleasant adjustment. Fleet Management is not a simple industry. No one person knows all there is to know about every one of our many services, which makes teamwork so important. When people like coming to work every day and like the people they work with, working as a team becomes natural. The overflow of ARI operating in this manner is our partnership approach with customers. Our desire is not to tell customers what they should or should not do, but instead partner together to identify problem areas and design customized solutions. Customers benefit when we work together to solve complex issues. ARI employees have become experts at this approach, because we do it every day with each other.\n\nHappy Employees = Higher Productivity\n\nWe all know the coworkers that show up and mail it in. To them, work is a necessary evil or a bridge between weekends. When I first walked into ARI I knew something was different. Everywhere I went people said hi to me and greeted me pleasantly. When I began my training, I was in awe of how willing my coworkers were to help me learn the ropes. People genuinely liked to be here and in turn, cared about the work they did. Why does this matter to our customers? A recent study by several economists found that happiness in the workplace led to a 12% spike in productivity. When employees are happy, they care. And when they care, they work harder and become more productive. And when they are more productive, customers reap the benefits of quicker response times and higher quality work (not to mention, happier employees mean our customers get to interact with pleasant people).\n\nTop 100 Recognition = Better Applicants\n\nWhen I found out that I had gotten an interview with ARI I was in shock (imagine my reaction when I actually got the job). To be interviewed by one of the best companies to work for felt like a great accomplishment because so many people want to work here. The positive publicity ARI has received from making the Fortune 100 list has increased the number and quality of applications we receive. In the past year, ARI received over 15,000 applications with an average of 31 applicants per opening. This means that ARI gets to be extremely selective in who we hire. The more talented the new employees are, the quicker they can get up to speed and the better their service. In the end, our customers are the ones that reap the rewards of our quality workforce."
