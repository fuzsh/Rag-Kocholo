        "text": "Ari Up (born Ariane Forester), the German-born lead vocalist for seminal British punk band The Slits, has died at the age of 48 after a long battle with illness.\n\nHer immediate family has asked for privacy at this time and no public service is planned. She is survived by three sons, her mother Nora, and stepfather Johnny Lydon (also known as Johnny Rotten).\n\nNora Forster and John Lydon released the following statement earlier today via JohnLydon.com:\n\nJohn and Nora have asked us to let everyone know that Nora’s daughter Arianna (aka Ari-Up) died today (Wednesday, October 20th) after a serious illness. She will be sadly missed.\n\nEveryone at JohnLydon.com and PiLofficial.Com would like to pass on their heartfelt condolences to John , Nora and family.\n\nRest in Peace.\n\nThe bandâ€™s final work, the video for the song â€œLazy Slamâ€ from the 2009 album Trapped Animal, can be seen above. Ari Up was insistent that the video be seen and it was her wish to release it posthumously.\n\n“We had the privilege over the last couple of years getting to know Ari both professionally and as a friend,” says Shahin Ewalt of Narnack Records. “Ari was a rare and beautiful person. She had so much energy, and was full of life.\n\nThere is no one like her and I’m afraid there will never be another Ari Up. She was fearless, pushing the boundaries of music in unprecedented ways. You can hear her direct influence in punk, indie and reggae over the course of the past three decades.\n\n“She made life fun and was so passionate about music. Ariane very much wanted her music to live on. She was smiling and making things happen through the good and the bad. We will truly miss her.\n\n“Our heartfelt condolences go out to her family.”\n\nJeff Jacquin/Manager Statement:\n\n“In my 20 years as a manager I have never seen or felt such inspiration and unyielding passion for music and life as I had with my dear friend and client Ari Up. She was truly one of a kind, and there will never be another like her.\n\nShe influenced generations of women and created some of the most memorable music of our time, but Ariâ€™s true magic was how she affected people on the street, face to face, every day. S\n\nhe ate life up and spit it out. She lived it on her own terms and never gave an inch! The Slits will live on.” forever and continue to change the way people feel about music and themselves and thatâ€™s just the way Ari would want it! We will all miss you so much!”\n\nEveryone at JohnLydon.com and PiLofficial.Com would like to pass on their heartfelt condolences to John , Nora and family."
