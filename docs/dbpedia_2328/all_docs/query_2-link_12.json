        "text": "Welcome to 5-10-15-20, Pitchfork News feature in which we talk to artists about the music they loved at five-year interval points in their lives. Maybe we'll get a detailed roadmap of how their tastes and passions helped make them who they are. Maybe we'll just learn that they really liked hearing the \"Heathcliff\" theme song over and over when they were kids. Either way, it'll be fun.\n\nOr that was the idea, anyway, when we talked to Slits frontwoman Ari Up. Ari didn't want to follow the every-five-years format; she just wanted to talk about every kind of music that she ever loved. And she's loved a whole lot of music.\n\nTalking to Ari Up on the phone is kind of like riding the Gravitron at the State Fair. This interview took place over a few days, as Ari continued to call back to talk about bits of music that she'd forgotten. This piece, though long, is heavily edited, and it doesn't include what she had to say about Tchaikovsky or Don Cherry or Vybz Kartel or the \"PokĂŠmon\" theme song. Which was a lot.\n\n(For the full effect, read everything here in a hybrid German/English/Jamaican accent. Also, spin around really fast a few times)\n\nAge 5-ish\n\nYou've got to know my background. It's not about a favorite song. Since I was a baby, I was bombarded by music. I remember music since at least two years old. My memory doesn't go to five. My memory goes to when I was two. That was in the 60s. I come from a bohemian background, a very small family, but the generations of family that I have are all really involved in music one way or another.\n\nMy father was a singer, kind of a swing pop star, always appearing on TV back in the 60s. He was touring all over at that time, even in Russia. I was bombarded from his side, just hearing all the swing and jazz. And my mother is from a crazy bohemian background. She was already promoting back then, bringing in bands from England. People were walking around in the living room back then, like the Bee Gees and all these big groups. It was like just regular people for me. Barry Gibb was one of my stepfathers, so to speak. Every time he came to Munich, he would be playing harmonica, playing some song to me.\n\nEverything was blasting day and night. There wasn't one specific favorite song. I mean, there was [the Beatles'] \"I Am the Walrus\", which I thought was fascinating because it was very spooky. I always ran around when \"Walrus\" was playing. I'd run around in the living room in circles. It was a very eerie, horror movie type song.\n\nRadio Luxembourg-- that's important. Radio Luxembourg in the 60s was the only station that you could enjoy that was playing proper music, music from London or America. In Germany, they only played shit on the radio, really. Insignificant, terrible schlager. This type of stuff was absolutely atrocious to me-- all this march music. And there was this guy who was my godfather who was the most famous star in Germany at the time-- Udo JĂźrgens. He's still famous to this day. It was that type of music that was coming out that I couldn't stand. I couldn't relate to it. When my mother was hosting a band that she was promoting from London, she played Radio Luxembourg all the time.\n\nOh my god, we've still got another huge part of my whole childhood: Mary Poppins. Huge. Oh my god. I was five or six years old at the time. I loved West Side Story. My mom brought home the vinyl of that, and my mother hated it. Ironically, she had a lot of records that she hated. Because she was so trendy, she needed to know everything there was, and she had a collection of stuff like that that she couldn't stand. But I really enjoyed that whole West Side Story thing. This is all coming into the Slits. If you listen to the Slits, you can hear all the influences of musicals, classical. Everything is in there that I grew up with.\n\n10-ish\n\nWhen I was eight, I moved to London with my mom. We were living in the car for a while, and it was the greatest time of my life. Everything was silky and velvet. My mom made this cushiony, velvety, little tiny bedroom for me in the backseat of the car. Back then, the 70s, the cars were fairly big, fairly robust. And we just, like, drove everywhere until we found somewhere to stay. By the time she found somewhere to rent, we were mostly in the hands of Yes. Jon Anderson of Yes was my godfather. When I was about 10 or 11, I used to come back from boarding school, and there was always people walking through. Jimi Hendrix was just a normal thing to see. He was just another dude, another guy. I didn't have a clue-- didn't listen to his music, didn't know it, didn't care.\n\nWhat really struck with me was A Clockwork Orange. When I heard the soundtrack at eight years old, I think I was never the same. All of that computer stuff put me in such a mode. When I heard Clockwork Orange, I was a bit spooked out. It sounded a bit alien, a bit scary. And the way the guy looked, with that eye, it just was so scary. It just really made my range of music open up in a crazy way.\n\nI was listening back to a lot of 60s vinyl records because my mother wanted to get rid of all the 60s vinyl records. She didn't care about them. That's when I became obsessed with Tom Jones' \"She's a Lady\". I heard soul records. In my mother's Mercedes-- it was an old green Mercedes-- she had this big cassette player that was a whole selection of all the 50s doo-wop, so I got into those. \"In the jungle, the mighty jungle,\" right? So by the time I'm picking up on the Slits, which is when I'm 14, I've got such a musically rich background.\n\n15-ish\n\nIn '75, my mom took me to a Sex Pistols concert. I was visually taken in. John [Lydon] was in front, moving spastically, frantically, like a nutcase coming out of a straitjacket, trying to free himself. It was just totally nuts. There's no way I would have discovered punk or been born into punk if it wasn't for my mother. By '76 everyone was walking in. Joe Strummer was teaching me guitar chords. He was the first to teach me guitar. Everywhere that Joe Strummer went, he didn't really talk. He just took his guitar and let his guitar do the speaking.\n\nI was still listening to ABBA. I was a little schoolgirl in my poofy dress and long hair. I wasn't listening to rebel music, really. I was just listening to everything that was around me. \"Dancing Queen\" was my favorite. But I didn't take to none of these people. Like, who were they, these chicks in costumes? I couldn't relate to any of these women, whether they were like \"Charlie's Angels\" type glossy pop people, or disco slutty-looking whorey-looking women, or hippie scruffy women. I found my identity through punk. I found it by going to a Clash rehearsal in '76. I was never the same. I came back with spray paint all over me, tearing up my clothes and putting on an old shirt like a mini that barely covered my butt. That was it. I stopped combing my hair, and I found my identity.\n\nMy mom took me to a Clash concert. People kept saying it was a Patti Smith concert, but it wasn't. That's where I met [Slits drummer] Palmolive. She had a little earring made out of a little pig, and she looked out of this world with her spiky hair and her motorbike boots and her tiny little mini. She just looked crazy. She knew that I was Nora's daughter, and Nora was everybody's mom at that time. All the punk people had a sanctuary with her. My mother kept a sanctuary for us few people: our little circle, us against the world, the world against us. Palmolive just came up to me and said, \"Let's do an all-girl band. Can you sing? Come tomorrow to rehearsal.\" And the Slits were made the next day. It started with me singing \"Blitzkrieg Bop\". Palmolive had a set of songs already written.\n\nWe had nothing big to inspire us. That's when I was bombarded with reggae-- roots reggae, which wasn't Bob Marley. I don't come from the Bob Marley school. I come from the Jamaican roots reggae school. I wasn't aware of reggae until the punk revolution started exploding around me. My peers were bombarding me with all this reggae stuff. That's when the heavy bass came in. You don't just go for the favorite songs. I could tell you a million reggae songs that were my favorite songs, but really it was more of the sound that I just started loving: Joe Gibbs, Lee Perry. When [the Congos] came out with \"Row Fisherman Row\", I heard that with John [Lydon]. I'll never forget. John was one of my mom's boyfriends at the time, and he became my stepfather. He was obsessed with reggae, and when I came to his place, I heard so much of it.\n\nDon Letts came and played reggae at the Roxy club. This was the first club that was only for us few punks. There was no punk record out yet. Punk was not signed yet. Punk was only playing live. We were all watching each other's shows and admiring each other's music live. We knew each other. If I heard the Buzzcocks, I knew all their shit from live shows. No one had recorded at that time. There was only a few, bit by bit, who started being recorded in '77. We had nothing to really go on except reggae and of course the odd stuff like Kraftwerk, or some New York stuff coming out, like Blondie or Patti Smith or New York Dolls. And a couple of forbidden, secret records like Diana Ross' \"Love Hangover\"-- that was the forbidden disco record that we played. We're not supposed to hear or like any disco, but we loved that.\n\nThere was, of course, different preferences for everybody individually. For instance, Tessa Pollitt, the bass player, she liked the Doors a lot. What's that guy, Van Morrison? Jim Morrison. She was really into him. Meanwhile, I had my forbidden fruits, like Cat Stevens. But all of that was our personal little thing that we liked in our childhood, and we kind of put aside.\n\nThe Slits days, stuff like \"The Jungle Book\" was a big influence on me. The bear and the monkeys and stuff singing in \"Jungle Book\"-- huge. We got into ethnic music a lot too. After the Cut album, we did Return of the Giant Slits, which was evolutionary in its own way. We made another evolution there. Like PokĂŠmon-- they have three evolutions. The Slits did that. We had the early raw, punk, tribal-sounding sort of singing.\n\nWe were listening to commercials. We loved commercials. There was a song about Weetabix. And there was a great Wrigley Spearmint Gum song. [Sings Wrigley's Gum song.] We liked all of the silly stuff. We made jokes of it. There's a lot of humor in the Slits' music. We never take ourselves too serious, and it's never segregated. It's never more female than male, and it's always multicultural, a hybrid of music of different ethnic influences. And that goes back to Return of the Giant Slits, which was so underrated, sadly. I think it just didn't get enough credit. The Japanese finally know; they released it again, big time.\n\n20-ish\n\nThe Slits broke up by the time I was 20. I was pregnant with twins and didn't know it. I basically left England completely in the 80s. I also left the world. I lived naked in the jungle for a while with my kids and listened to only trees and water and wind, listened to silence, no music at all. I was in the depths of the jungle in Belize and in Indonesia. I was living with this tribe of people, and they were hunting and shit like that. I wasn't listening to any music. I was just there listening to the jungle.\n\nIf I went to Indonesia, I would be very influenced by the Muslim sounds that came out in the city. Indonesia always has prayers in the morning, the dawn, and in the evening, the twilight. And you hear all these churches. You're standing in the middle of just anywhere, and you suddenly hear all these amazing voices coming out, incredible singing.\n\nI was into instruments-- just feeling them and seeing them in real life. I became aware of what they sound like and how they're played. For instance, my father everywhere in Africa in the 70s. He traveled everywhere in Africa and filmed it. He went to the strangest tribal spots, not just big city places. He went to these tribal spots, and every tribe looked totally different. He never forgets how he regretted not filming one of the villages that he went through. His partner just said, \"Oh, there will be a ton more when we go further south,\" and he never saw any people like that anymore. He said the women could carry a plate on their ass. Their butt was so big and so like a table, and their breasts were standing out, like, up. And the way he described these women, he wasn't describing them sexually, like a pervert. He went to this tribe that played tribal music with these instruments that I can't even describe. These guys who had hardly no clothes on, they were in some kind of desert, and they played this guitar that was standing up like a bass with just one string on it. And it made these incredible notes and sounds. It just fascinated me.\n\n25-ish\n\nI lived with Neneh Cherry in Queens, where [her father] Don Cherry had a loft. Tina [Weymouth] from the Talking Heads lived above with her man. From the 80s, me and Neneh Cherry were picking up all the first hip-hop stuff, the records that nobody knew about. Nobody knew those beats. Do you remember the Funky Four + 1? With the girl? Stuff like that, it was great. I was always into hip-hop from the early breakdance stage. I went to the Roxy in New York and I saw Madonna. Everyone was on their cardboard boxes, breakdancing. There's a whole New York culture in me. I loved hip-hop from the birth. And the graffiti, the good graffiti that was on the Lower East Side, beautiful war paintings and stuff.\n\nMe and Neneh were obsessing with the radio, all them disco joints from '80-'83. We liked all of that too. We loved that Grace Jones stuff. No one really knows-- the Jamaicans don't even know-- that Morgan Heritage had a huge disco hit. We liked that. If they rapped on all of those beats back then, that would have been really great. I know Biggie did it later; he took a few, \"Juicy Fruit\" and all of that. A few rap artists caught onto that train of using those beats from the early 80s, but they should have done it at that time. That would have been great.\n\n30-ish\n\nI went back to Jamaica big-time in the 90s. I was in Jamaica a lot in the 80s, too, but I was just turned off in general even by reggae in the 80s. But then something happened in '91, '92. A revolution happened in Jamaica. It all started with a dance called Bogle by a dancer called Bogle, and Jamaica and reggae music was never the same again. It was the birth of incredible dancehall culture.\n\nI mean, people looked like we looked like in '76. People started wearing the spiky hair with the heavy leather stuff, the crazy belts with the chains. Women were just totally X-rated. They looked like when Siouxsie was walking around like a Matrix girl in her leather gear with her breasts out and stuff. Jamaica just totally lived what they had missed. They didn't even know they missed punk in England in '76, '77. They looked crazy. They did what they wanted.\n\n35-ish and on\n\nThat brings us to the new album. And with the new album, really, it's like we never really left the Slits. The new album is really just another third recorded album. It's just a continuation of the Slits. It's not really as much of a reunion or a comeback thing; it's just a continuation of what we already come from. We don't deny our roots. We're very old school and rootsy from where we came from, but we're very modern, very new. We're not vintage.\n\nWe don't try to imitate what we were back then. We're too young for that, and you see it in the pictures we've got. I mean I've got twins and another boy, and I've got no stretch-marks. My belly is clean. When I went to the doctor one day, they kept saying to me, \"Did you ever have any children before? Did you give birth yet?\" And I'm like, \"Uh, yes.\" They couldn't understand why my body was so young. But we keep it going, and that's the same way we are musically.\n\nDancehall is really the missing ingredient that I'm throwing into the Slits thing. So the Slits' new album has a little dancehall flavor as well. It's got a bit of everything, going back to the John Peel session roots, to the early '77 style. And it goes back to Cut and Return of the Giant Slits. It has a mixture of all of that ethnic stuff in it, and then it has the punky reggae stuff. It has the new elements of everything we've been listening to and growing over the years with. Tessa, I'm sure, listened to different things in her 20s and 30s than I did, but it all seems to come together again. Once you're born the way you are, you don't change. I haven't changed that much in my philosophy or opinions or attitude in life, and neither has Tessa. We're pretty much the same. We're not very much tamed. Nobody was able to tame us over the years. So you'd be surprised. We're just revolutionary because that's just what we are."
