        "text": "Ari Up, the vocalist of the UK punk band The Slits, died today. She was 48.\n\nThe news of Up’s death was first announced in a statement issued by Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon (via Dangerous Minds):\n\n“John and Nora have asked us to let everyone know that Noras daughter Arianna (aka Ari Up) died today (Wednesday, October 20th) after a serious illness. She will be sadly missed.”\n\nThe exact cause of death remains unknown.\n\nBorn Ariane Forster in Munich, Germany, the future punk rock goddess was only fourteen when she formed The Slits in 1976. Before breaking up in 1981, the band released two full-length efforts including their iconic 1979 debut, Cut. The Slits reformed in 2006 and released a new album, Trapped Animal, in 2009. Up also released a solo album, Dread More Dan Dead, in 2005 and appeared in the classic Clash documentary, Rude Boy.\n\nRelated Video\n\nBelow, you can watch the video for The Slits track “Typical Girl”, off the aforementioned Cut."
