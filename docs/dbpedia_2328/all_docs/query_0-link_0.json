        "text": "Ari Up, frontwoman of the celebrated British post-punk band the Slits, has died at the age of 48.\n\nThe singer, born Arianna Forster, passed away yesterday (20 October) after a \"serious illness\".\n\nThe announcement was made by representatives of Forster's stepfather, John Lydon, last night. A statement on his website reads: \"John and Nora have asked us to let everyone know that Nora's daughter Arianna (Ari Up) died today after a serious illness. She will be sadly missed. Everyone at JohnLydon.com and PiLOfficial.com would like me to pass on our heartfelt condolences to John, Nora and family. Rest In Peace.\"\n\nThe Slits emerged from the British punk scene and became known for their fusion of post-punk with dub and reggae. They released two albums, 1979's Cut and 1981's Return of the Giant Slits, as well as an untitled collection of demos in 1980.\n\nAfter the band split, Forster moved with her husband and children to the jungle regions of Indonesia and Belize, before heading to Jamaica and settling in Kingston. There, she continued to make music in the New Age Steppers and released solo material as Baby Ari, Ari Up and Madussa.\n\nIn 2005 the Slits re-formed and the following year they released a new EP, Revenge of the Killer Slits."
