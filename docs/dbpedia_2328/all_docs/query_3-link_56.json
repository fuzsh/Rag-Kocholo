        "text": "Steven Adler played at M3 festival. Fans didn’t know quite what to expect. All the fans knew was we would be hearing some Guns N Roses classics. Fans didn’t know quite what to expect from Ari Kamin didn’t disappoint fans by the end of the set everyone was wondering who is this guy. It was one of the biggest surprises. Afterwards Ari was nice enough to take pictures and talk to the fans many of them wishing him the best and telling him how much they enjoyed his set. He has a great vocal style. It’s good to know that the future of rock n roll is in great hands. What I admire most about Ariel he reminds me of what makes rock n roll fun. He has a great stage presence and charisma\n\nAngel Alamo: Who were your influences growing up?\n\nAri Kamin: My first musical influence of all time was Michael Jackson. I was 5 years old when Dangerous album was released and I still can remember me playing that record over and over again thinking “Ok, that’s what I wanna do”. Then they came Queen, Aerosmith, Extreme and obviusly Guns N’ Roses.\n\nAA: How did you get into music?\n\nAK: As I said before, I knew I wanted to be a singer since I was a little child so my parents tried to stimulate that desire taking me to piano lessons and guitar lessons. In elementary school, while kids of my age were playing sports games or trading cards I drawing my band’s logo and trying to write songs. But it wasn’t till high school that I was able to step on a stage for the very first time. I still remember that night, it was awesome!\n\nAA: How did you get the gig to be the new singer in Adler’s Appetite?\n\nAK: Before being Steven’s singer I used to play in two bands back in Argentina. “Criaturas Salvajes” and “Son Of a Gun”, a GNR cover band. In 2016 Steven went to Argentina to play as a special guest of Guns N’ Roses at River Plate stadium and after the show he joined Son of a Gun at The Roxy club for a 3 hours jam where we played the entire “Appetite for Destruction” and a couple of songs from the Use your Illusion albums. Two years after that gig I receive a call from Steven asking me to join his band. How cool is that?\n\nAA: What was the first show like with Adler’s Appetite?\n\nAK: Picture yourself as an Argentine guy who never left his country except to go to neighboring countries a couple of times. Suddenly you are sitting on a plane heading Hollywood to play with one of your heroes, the drummer of the most dangerous band in the world. It was mind blowing! I will always be grateful to Steven, he is one of the nicest human being I met in my life and he and his wife Carolina took care of me from the first moment.\n\nAA: Any plans for the band to perform overseas?\n\nAK: Thing’s been growing up since last year when I joined the band, we’ve played in a couple big festivals, we have a couple more ahead and the Kiss Kruise in October. We are writing new material, something really exciting! So I think it’s just a matter of time for us to be playing near your area, wherever you live!\n\nAA: Did you take voice lessons?\n\nAK: I had a great teacher named Diego Valdez who taught me how to get the most out of my voice. It’s funny, because a few years ago Diego and I took separate paths and we did not see each other again, but while I’m working with Steven I know he’s living in Spain and he’s been working with hard rock legends like Craig Goldy, Rudy Sarzo and Simon Wright.\n\nAA: Growing up who were your favorite singers?\n\nAK: While growing up my favourite singers were Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Steven Tyler, Axl Rose and Meat Loaf. Then I started listening to Ray Charles, Louis Armstrong, Aretha Franklin. The last few years I’ve been listening to a lot of southern rock and country music I love Charlie Starr from Blackberry Smoke and Jaren Johnston from The Cadillac Three and I’m also into Kid Rock, Blake Shelton and Alan Jackson. But the only one for me was and will ever be Freddie.\n\nAA: Are there any Guns N Roses songs that you haven’t performed yet that you would still like to perform?\n\nAK: In more than 15 years of career I think I have given myself the pleasure of playing almost all GNR songs and I have enjoyed them all but now I’m focused on our originals. It’s a very important step in my career and there’s nothing more exciting for me than thinking about putting my voice together with Steven’s drums on a new album."
