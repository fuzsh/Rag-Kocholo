Speaking on the song, Ari Abdul says, “DFHMPU is about self-worth. It describes being mistreated and recognizing you deserve better.

The EP features six tracks, all expertly crafted to resonate with fans on a deeply personal level.\n\nCCTV is horror story dressed as a mixtape. I wanted to tell a story from beginning to end that could be open to interpretation for not only my fans but also for people who aren’t familiar with ‘Ari Abdul’ yet,” says Ari. “The lyrics still have a dark feel, but I wanted to go even heavier with the production on this project. I’m excited to share a different, more intense side of myself with this release.”\n\nShe also performed at Chicago’s biggest music festival Lollapalooza and embarked on her first tour HELLGIRL, selling out shows in New York, Los Angeles, and London, among others.\n\nABOUT ARI ABDUL\n\nHailing from Brooklyn, New York, Ari Abdul has forged her own brand of dark alternative pop. Music quickly became a second language for Ari Abdul growing up in Brooklyn. Her Ecuadorian mom loved Latin music while her Costa Rican/ Palestinian father introduced her to classic rock. Rounding everything out were her brothers who were all about hip-hop and metal. She graduated to electric guitar at 14 and started playing grunge songs inspired by Nirvana. But she was too nervous to share her work – let alone her voice- with anyone. She had friends in choir, but that wasn’t the musical direction she saw herself going. It wasn’t until LaRosa’s mom encouraged Abdul to create her own music in July 2021 that lit the spark to share her voice with the world.\n\nShe combines the reverb-heavy swells of your favorite shoegaze artists such as The Neighborhood and Lana Del Rey. Combining an array of visual and stylistic influences, Ari has cultivated a mysterious edge to her artistic endeavors. In 2022, she released her debut single “BABYDOLL” followed by the sped-up version “BABYDOLL (Speed).” Both versions garnered viral success with over 83M global streams, 400M TikTok views, and 420K TikTok creations."
