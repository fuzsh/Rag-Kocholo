        "text": "Ari Up, the frontwoman of the British punk band The Slits, died Oct. 20, 2010, at age 48, reportedly from cancer.\n\nShe was born Ariane Forster on Jan. 17, 1962, in Munich, Germany; her stepfather was John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten) and she has noted that her godfather is Jon Anderson, the singer of Yes.\n\nThe Slits formed in 1976 when Up teamed up with drummer Palmolive (Paloma Romero), guitarist Kate Korus and bassist Suzi Gutsy. That year, The Slits shared the bill with The Clash and The Buzzcocks on the “White Riot” tour. The Slits produced two landmark albums — “Cut” and “Return of The Giant Slits” — by 1981, before splitting up. The Slits reformed in 2005 and had remained together until Up’s death.\n\nUp later became part of The New Age Steppers. She released a solo album, “Dread More Dan Dead,” in 2005."
