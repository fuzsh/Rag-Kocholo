        "text": "Soulful storyteller Ari Tibi pens her melodies straight from the heart into anthems of freedom and acceptance.\n\nI don’t feel so alone with my feelings when I put them in a song. They become like an advocate, speaking with and for me\n\nWho are your biggest musical influences? Do you find them to seep into your own songwriting?\n\nI discovered the blues in college which got me into a type of journalistic and expressive songwriting, then after moving to LA I fell for country, which has such a clever way with words I began to study it a lot. That led me right back to folk, so now I basically write poems and put them to music.\n\nBrandi Carlile is who I listen to the most these days, but because we have such similar styles to begin with, it more-so encourages me to be myself than anything else. To be completely honest, in hearing her music I realised there was someone else out there like me…I needed that extra push to realise I had a musical place in the world!\n\nWalk is such a hard-hitting song, what is the story behind it? Especially the lyrics ‘Walk in peace’, what do these three words mean to you?\n\nThe story behind walk is a very long one, appropriately so in a way. Walking through life, you’re bound to come across hardships and troubles, and you have a few different choices in how to react. You can be resentful and paralyzed (first verse); consumed with anger and join the fight (second verse); or do your best to stay peaceful, calm, and work past it. ‘Walk In Peace’ is like a prayer or mantra to myself to tread with light and an open heart.\n\nI came out in college to a very accepting family and community. It was a huge relief and honestly, the best year of my life at that point. I joined the gospel choir my sophomore year and while the music infiltrated my soul in a way I still hold close, I ran into a group of people who tried over and over again to change me, saying the ‘devil’ was inside my love for another girl. It horrified me that they wouldn’t let up, and that was where ‘Walk’ originally stemmed from. With the help of one of the choir leaders, I wrote the song at a bus stop in San Francisco. Having her support and a song that helped me stand for what I believed in made the difference.\n\nI also heard that over the years since it was written, it has around 29 versions! It must hold a really special place in your heart for it to constantly be there with you on your journey through music. Do you find it to be a catharsis, unleashing your emotions into song?\n\nYeah, it’s like with any art. I feel that with painting and drawing too. It materialises emotions which can be so difficult to understand. This year I went through a plethora of many major transitions, including a job change and a break up, that rocked my world. I didn’t know which way was up. I needed to release something to feel like my emotions were anywhere but inside of me so I met with Dreux, my producer, and asked him to work with me on ‘Walk.’ We reinvented the verses to fit what I was going through this year, and voila. I still listen to it when I need to feel strong!\n\nIt’s wonderful to have something cathartic like that, that’s why I like working out, dancing, or singing rock because it helps me physically sweat something out. What’s more, though, is I don’t feel so alone with my feelings when I put them in a song. They become like an advocate, speaking with and for me.\n\nThey say when you sing you’re praying twice.\n\nWalk holds some gospel elements, giving you goosebumps with its harmonies, but does religion still hold a place in your heart as well as your lyrics?\n\nOrganized religion is not something I grew up with whatsoever, so it never really ruled my life in the way it’s supposed to. I understood God to be in creativity and love when I was a child, and looked at nature as the safe haven I needed. However, I had periods in my life where I went to church every couple of months and I was able to find my version of spirituality there.\n\nThey say when you sing you’re praying twice. I’m very intentional with what I say and have to be in a meditative state when I write. For me, that’s when I’m the most honest.\n\nAs a songwriter, how does it feel to see people relate to your words? Have many people reached out to you and spoke about their own experiences?\n\nMusic feels like a gift. Once I perform or release a song, it doesn’t feel like mine anymore. If someone relates to something I’ve written, I know I’m doing it right! It’s a wonderful thing for both the audience and myself to connect with music, to feel validated in whatever that sentiment was.\n\nI wrote a song for my friend Melanie after she passed away. I didn’t know the family at all, but there were some metaphors in the song that directly correlated with their experience to her death. The song is called Rosary and it ended up bonding us; we’re now really close and it started with the song.\n\nYou’re also a part of Luci, a LA female trio, how does the dynamic of performing change in a band compared to solo work?\n\nPerforming with a band is something I’ve always done. I kind of grew up in a family band so collaborating for me is in the nature of music. When you’re on stage with multiple people though, you have to understand that there is more than one leader, more than one energy creating the experience. Finding harmony or peace between the members is when the magic happens.\n\nWriting with Luci is entirely special because I’ve never had collaborators quite like them. Our bond is unparalleled. When it’s just me up there, in control of the room and music, whatever journey I feel like going on, we can go. It’s easy to get lost in someone else’s rhythm after a while so I believe it’s important to develop leadership skills on your own, too.\n\nAs a queer woman, do you think the modern music scene is more accepting of those in the LGBT community than when you first joined?\n\nYes! I’ve seen so many role models nowadays than what I grew up with. I was ashamed to admit that I liked girls and felt different – not because of any religion or my parents – but because I didn’t see anyone else like me. I’m grateful the younger generations have so much of that.\n\nQueer is also becoming a trend in the mainstream, which is cute, so it’s perceived as being very accepting. You have King Princess who is killing it, Troye Sivan, Kehlani, Brandi Carlile, and even Ariana Grande writing anthems for the community. But when Lil Nas X came out, in my opinion it was too much of a ‘thing,’ so clearly we haven’t normalized sexuality yet. But all in all, we’ve come leaps and bounds for artists to be themselves.\n\nDo you have any messages for those discovering their sexuality?\n\nYou are as unique as your fingerprint. There is literally nobody else like you, so when you’re discovering who you are, be patient. Remember that you may feel different everyday and you are so allowed to evolve. Surround yourself with people who are loyal and bring out the absolute best in you. Conversely you may know right away what your gender or sexuality is and that’s a privilege: trust yourself. Show the world. Know that love and gender are a spectrum; you give it the colors you want it to have."
