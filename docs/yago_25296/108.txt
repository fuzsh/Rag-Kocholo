Prince of Denmark. Son of Christian IX and Louise of Hesse-Kassel. Married in 1885 to the French Princess Marie d’Orléans. The couple had five children who were nicknamed the “naughty children from the Yellow Palace”.

Prince Valdemar had an enthusiasm for ships and was trained in the Navy. Consequently, he was often at sea for long periods. The sea voyages continued after his marriage to Princess Marie who supported his sea faring interest so much as to have the picture of an anchor tattooed on her upper arm, which was very unusual at the time.

Valdemar was offered the Bulgarian throne in 1878 but chose to decline the offer. This was mostly due to the fact that he did not wish to risk going to war against his brother, George I of Greece, as Bulgaria and Greece were likely to end up waging war against each other. Prince Valdemar and Princess Marie instead chose to stay in Denmark where they enjoyed great popularity.
