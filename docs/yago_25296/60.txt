Prince George Valdemar Carl Axel of Denmark (16 April 1920 in Bernstorff Palace – 29 September 1986 in Copenhagen) was a Danish prince.

Early life

Prince George was the eldest son of Prince Axel of Denmark (himself a son of Prince Valdemar of Denmark) and Princess Margaretha of Sweden. As a result of the Danish Act of Succession of 1953, which restricts the throne to those descended from Christian X and his wife, Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, through approved marriages, he lost his place in the line of succession.

Marriage

On 16 September 1950, at Glamis Castle, he married Anne, Viscountess Anson, the divorced wife of Thomas, Viscount Anson, and daughter of Hon. John Bowes-Lyon and Hon. Fenella Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis.

His wife was a first cousin of Elizabeth II. Prince George himself was a second cousin of Edward VIII and George VI. He served as defence attaché to London and military, naval and air attaché at Paris.
