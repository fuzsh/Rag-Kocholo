He well deserves his nickname of father-in-law of Europe… His children married into the most prestigious Royal houses of Europe: United Kingdom, Russia, Greece, Hanover, Belgium, Luxembourg, Romania and Norway. Let’s see how!\n\nKing Christian IX of Denmark and his Queen Louise had six children:\n\nFrederick VIII of Denmark\n\nFrederick was born on 3 June 1843 in the Yellow Palace in Copenhagen. In July 1868, Crown Prince Frederick became engaged to Princess Louise, the 17-year-old only daughter of King Charles XV of Sweden. Princess Louise belonged to the Bernadotte dynasty (founded by Désiree Clary, Napoleon’s ex-fiancée). The marriage was suggested as a way of creating friendship between Denmark and Sweden.\n\nThe couple had four sons and four daughters; their eldest sons, Christian and Carl, would become kings of Denmark and Norway respectively. Amonst their currently living descendants are:\n\nQueen Margaretha of Denmark\n\nex-Queen Anne-Marie of Greece\n\nKing Harald V of Norway\n\nKing Philippe of Belgium\n\nHenri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg\n\nAlexandra of Denmark\n\nAlexandra married on March 10, 1863 with the British Prince Albert Eduard, Prince of Wales, also known as “Bertie”. Alexandra was not Victoria’s first choice because the Danes could not agree with Prussia (country where her eldest daugher Vicky now lived). But when they actually met, Queen Victoria was overwhelmed by the beauty of the young Alexandra. Victoria gave her approval for the wedding. Eduard too was charmed by his future wife. The marriage was closed on March 10, 1863 in St. George’s Chapel in Windsor.\n\nThe couple had three sons and three daughters; their second son became King George V of England and their daughter Maud became Queen of Norway. Amonst their currently living descendants are:\n\nQueen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom\n\nGeorge I of Greece\n\nBorn in 1845, he was only 17 years old when he was elected king by the Greek National Assembly, which had deposed the unpopular Otto. He married Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia in 1867, and became the first monarch of a new Greek dynasty.\n\nThe couple had five sons and three daughters. Their son King Constantine I became King of Greece after his father. Amonst their currently living descendants are:\n\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh\n\nMargareta, head of the Royal family of Romania\n\nex-King Constantine II of Greece\n\nMaria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)\n\nBorn in 1847, she was considered a good bride for the heir apparent, Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich. In 1864, Nicholas met Dagmar and the became betrothed. Before they were married, he died in 1865 from meningitis. His last wish was that Dagmar would marry his younger brother, the future Alexander III. At first, she was too distraught to consider it, but after a while she received an affectionate letter from Tsar Alexander II where he told that he hoped she would still consider herself a member of their family. In June 1866, while on a visit to Copenhagen, the Tsarevich Alexander asked Dagmar for her hand.\n\nShe converted to Orthodoxy and became Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia. The lavish wedding took place on 9 November [O.S. 28 October] 1866 in the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Her unfortunate son Tsar Nicholas II, his wife Alexandra and five children would eventually be executed by the Bolcheviks during the Russian Revolution.\n\nPrincess Thyra of Denmark\n\nBorn in 1853, she was the youngest daughter of Christian IX of Denmark. In 1878, she married Ernest Augustus, the exiled heir to the Kingdom of Hanover. Unfortunately, she didn’t get a throne, just like her siblings. The Kingdom of Hanover had been annexed by Prussia in 1866, she spent most of her life in exile with her husband in Austria.\n\nThe couple had three sons and three daughters. Amonst their currently living descendants are:\n\nex-King Constantine II of Greece\n\nPrince Ernst August of Hanover\n\nPrince Valdemar of Denmark\n\nBorn in 1858, he was King Christian’s youngest child. He was only four when his older sister Alexandra married. In 1885, he married Princess Marie of Orléans. Valdemar had a lifelong naval career.\n\nThe couple had four sons and one daughter. Amonst their currently living descendants are:\n\nMargareta, Head of Royal family of Romania\n\nFamily tree\n\nDo you want to know more about this family? Have a look at the family tree I made.
