        "text": "Based on the British Scandinavia thread and my comment in it\n\nIt's not that hard you just need to have a male child of Prince-Consort George of Denmark and Queen Anne of England survive to adulthood, afterward if we arrange a accident for Christian VI before 1723 Georges offsprings are the nearest heir to the kingdom of Denmark-Norway, the duchies of Schleswig-Holstein and the county of Oldenburg when Frederik IV dies in 1730.\n\nSo let's say that William, Duke of Gloucester, son of Queen Anne of England and George of Denmark are healthier and survive to adulthood and produce a few sons of his owns. After his cousin Frederik IV dies he inheriate the Danish throne in 1730. OTL Christian VI dies in 1722 before the conception of his first son. So we have 8 year when William (likely Wilhelm in Denmark) are herediaty prince to the Danish crown\n\nBut what difference will we see in European politic and warfare in the periode from his death in OTL until he inheriate the Danish throne, who are a likely marriage partner for him, how will it affect England, Scotland and Ireland that there are no Act of Settlement, how will it effect the Great Northen War that a member of the Oldenburg dynasty sit on the English throne?\n\nIn OTL Hanover got Bremen from Denmark (which had occupied in since 1712) in 1715 for entering the war and recognise the Danish claim to Schleswig-Gottorp. But it's doubtful that Denmark would have seen a need for that if George I hadn't been such a powerful prince with position as King of UK too.\n\nThe question are whether this would put Denmark in a better position at the peacw negotiation later on that they still are occupying Bremen, in OTL the Russians left the Danes to dry.\n\nI've thought about some possible names. As the Hanoverians were the next Protestant family in the line of succession maybe it would make sense marry William to one of them. So the only choice would be Princess Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, who IOTL was the wife of Frederick William I of Prussia. However, it seems that her Prussian marriage was arranged very soon in her life, I don't how likely would be to have it changed.\n\nGood suggestion, it wouldn't be bad marriage, while William doesn't need the legitimecy it's still a good marriage, they're not too closely related, it put the ERnglish Oldenburgs in a better position if they're going inheriate Denmark (even before Christian death they're close to the Danish throne). For Hanover a marriage with a Oldenburg aren't bad either especially if Denmark are occupying Bremen-Verden (I expect the marriage to happen somewhere in the periode 1712-1721).\n\nIf a Danish succession in Britain would make Sweden be worried, maybe they could try to ensure peace by a marriage. A possible option would be Marie Luise of Hesse-Kassel, a sister of king Frederick of Sweden. IOTL she was the wife of John William Friso, Prince of Orange.\n\nI find it unlikely Denmark and Sweden are going through the Great Northen War, which de facto make the English a semi-hostile power.\n\nThis gives other idea, a Dutch option, in order to keep the links between Britain and Netherlands after the death of William III. The prince could be married to one of the sisters of John William Friso, Prince of Orange, as Marie Amalie, Sophia Hedwig or Isabella Charlotte. But apparently they had some problem, as the two sisters who married IOTL were both childless, and the others never married.\n\nA possible neutral option would be Sophie Louise of Mecklenburg, who IOTL was the third wife of Frederick I of Prussia.\n\nUnlikely there are little reason for this marriage, the Mecklenburgians are singular unimportant for the British. It was a poor and depopulated duchy in a unimportant strategic position, with a weak and powerless Prince, while the Danish Oldenburg and Hohenzollern sometimes married them, they had a incentiment as close neighbours.\n\nInteresting idea. Given Denmark's position in European wars of this period, it seems likely that these dominions (there may still be an Act of Union, as I imagine the Scottish Jacobites wouldn't like the Oldenburgs any more than the Hanoverians) would be less involved in European wars compared to OTL, which has consequences for the rest of\n\nthe world.\n\nInteresting, through I agree with Gonzaga on the Act of Union point. Military I think England are more likely to be the dog and Denmark the tail than vice versa. Denmark are going to be pulled into wars by the English. Through England are going to have enourmous advantage of Denmark as \"allied\" in those wars rather than Hanover. Denmark are easier to defend, it's richer, military more powerful, more centralise with a weaker nobility and have around 3 times the population of Hanover. This are going to benefit both Prussia and England in the coming wars. Denmark on the other hand will lose it ability to be a neutral power, but its possesions around the world and merchant marine are going to be defended by the English and it may gain some territorial concessions in those wars.\n\nThe cultural effects might be significant - OTL Britain and especially her colonies were enriched by immigration from Hanover in this period (see Handel and Herschel for instance) so what would be the effects of Danish artists, natural philosophers and intellectuals coming over instead? Assuming of course the kings hold court in London; Denmark is a tad more significant a continental possession than Hanover. I suppose they could alternate between courts and appoint a viceroy/governor-general type person in the other.\n\nHere are a significant difference, Denmark proper in this periode was primary a immigration country rather than emigration, but on the other hand it has Norway which was primary a emigration country (through mostly to Copenhagen) and Holstein and Oldenburg are almost as big of Hanover, especially if Denmark gain Bremen-Verden from Sweden (quite likely with the better position of the Danish king with a member of his dynasty on the English throne). There also the difference of a much bigger Danish population thanm Hanovean which mean that even if the Danish emigration are only 50% of the Hanovean emigration in precent of the Danish population, it's still 50% more than the Hanovean send. Another significant difference are eductions, there was attempt to establish universal education in 1739, but was dropped thanks to a weak financial position. Here where Denmark does better in the Great Northen War, and are likely to receive pension from England for use of the Danish army. Denmark can quite likely afford it. Which mean a greater educated population to get expertice from, that are mixed with a large and very meritory low nobility give Denmark a quite significant pool to draw experts and intellectuals from.\n\nI think the main court would still be in London. By the POD William becomes the Danish king only in 1730, that would be almost 15 years after he inherits the British throne (assuming that Anne dies on schedule). So he would probably feel himself much more British than Danish. However, he might have to spend some time in Copenhagen.\n\nI agree through I'm not sure how often he need to visit Copenhagen, more likely he will make a relative viceroy and send him to Copenhagen, if he's just somewhat competent and doesn't try to weaken the burghers rights, he's going to do fine."
