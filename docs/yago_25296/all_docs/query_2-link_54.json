        "text": "Queen Mary and her husband King Frederik X are parents to four children.\n\nThe Australian-born royal welcomed her first child Crown Prince Christian in 2005, when she was 33 years old, and in the years that followed the royal couple had three more children.\n\nPrincess Isabella came next before Mary fell pregnant with twins, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine, who arrived in 2011.\n\nREAD MORE: Frederik's tears echo beautiful wedding day moment 20 years on\n\nDenmark's highest honour, the Order if the Elephant, has already been given to Crown Prince Christian, now it has been given to the youngest three.\n\nRepresenting the strength of Europe, this highly coveted honour is already held by Denmark's King and Queen , awarded by the Sovereign of Denmark.\n\nA statement from The Royal House revealed: \"HRH Princess Isabella, HRH Prince Vincent and HRH Princess Josephine are Knights of the Order of the Elephant from 14 January 2024 onwards.\"\n\n\"The three new elephant knights are expected to be presented with the insignia of the Order of the Elephant on their 18th birthday.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Australia's Mary is Queen of Denmark as King Frederik takes throne\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the children of Queen Mary and King Frederik.\n\nCrown Prince Christian\n\nThe heir to the Danish throne after his father, Prince Christian, 18, is the eldest child of King Frederik and Queen Mary of Denmark.\n\nHe was born on October 15, 2005, at the Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen University Hospital).\n\nChristian's official titles are His Royal Highness, Crown Prince of Denmark and Count of Monpezat.\n\nHe was baptised at the Christiansborg Palace Chapel on January 21, 2006.\n\nREAD MORE: Secret link between Queen Mary's proclamation dress and her wedding gown\n\nIt was then his full name was revealed for the first time to the Danish public, as per tradition – Christian Valdemar Henri John. Christian's two middle names, Henri and John, are taken from his two grandfathers.\n\nChristian wore a christening gown that has been part of the Danish royal family since 1870.\n\nHis parents first brought their baby son to Australia in 2006 when he was just over a year old. The private visit, in November, saw the couple take the young royal to visit Mary's family in Tasmania.\n\nChristian's first official royal engagement took place in 2012, when he accompanied his grandmother Queen Margrethe II at an event inside the Amalienborg Palace complex in Copenhagen.\n\nCrown Prince Christian started nursey school on March 27, 2007. He walked hand-in-hand with his parents on his first day at Queen Louise's Kindergarten in Fredensborg.\n\nHe then began 'big school' on August 12, 2011, at Tranegårdskolen (Tranegård School) in Gentofte.\n\nIn January 2020, Prince Christian and his siblings began a 12-week program at the Lemania-Verbier International School, in the ski resort town of Verbier in Switzerland. But their stay was cut short by a few weeks when the coronavirus pandemic began spreading across the world, forcing the family back to Denmark.\n\nREAD MORE: How Princess Mary becomes Queen of Denmark\n\nNearly 12 months later, Christian contracted COVID-19 from a classmate, sending his family into isolation inside their Copenhagen palace.\n\nThe palace announced Christian was due to attend Herlufsholm School in Næstved in mid-2021.\n\nThe private day and boarding is located south of Copenhagen and was founded in 1565 as a boarding school for the Danish nobility. He'll become the first future king to be educated at the school. His cousin, Count Nikolai, attended the school several years ago.\n\nOn May 15, 2021, Prince Christian made his confirmation at the Fredensborg Palace Church, an important rite in the Lutheran Church that marks the passage from childhood to youth.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Without Mary, Frederik would not be the King he is today'\n\nPrince Christian speaks Danish, English and French and is very interested in sports. He plays soccer, rides horses and regularly takes part in runs with his mum and dad.\n\nPrince Christian of Denmark's life in photos\n\nPrincess Isabella\n\nThe second child of Queen Mary and King Frederik of Denmark, Princess Isabella, 16, is third in line to the throne after her brother Prince Christian.\n\nShe was born on April 21, 2007, at the Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen University Hospital).\n\nIsabella's official titles are Her Royal Highness, Princess of Denmark and Countess of Monpezat.\n\nShe was christened in the Fredensborg Palace Chapel on July 1, 2007. Royal christenings are not tied to a particular church, so Isabella and her siblings were baptised in three different places of worship.\n\nAt her baptism, her full name was revealed for the first time - Isabella Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe. Henrietta was the name of Queen Mary's mother, who died when Mary was just 25. Isabella also shares the first name of her grandmother the Queen and her great-grandmother Queen Ingrid.\n\nREAD MORE: King Frederik and Australian-born Queen Mary's accession to the Danish throne in pictures\n\nIn 2008, Princess Isabella – then aged 14 months – made her first visit to Australia and was introduced to the media at Government House in Sydney, where she and Prince Christian did what all children do and started to whinge.\n\nHowever, the public lapped it up as Mary and Frederik tried their best to wrangle the kids while smiling for the cameras.\n\nIsabella joined her big brother at Tranegårdskolen (Tranegård School) in Gentofte on August 13, 2013, posing with her parents beforehand outside Amalienborg Palace as per tradition.\n\nIn 2015 – aged eight – Isabella carried out her first official royal engagement, accompanying her mother to the island of Samsø.\n\nShe is a keen horseback rider, much like her mum. Isabella is also into running and often takes part in the family's Royal Run event.\n\nLike her brother, Isabella speaks Danish, English and French.\n\nREAD MORE: Queen Mary's surprise appearance in front of rapturous crowd\n\nIsabella recently began wearing items from her mother's wardrobe at official events and has been seen borrowing items from Mary's jewellery box, too.\n\nAnd she seems to have a bit of a feisty attitude – at Christian's confirmation, Isabella was caught on camera appearing to backchat to Queen Mary when she was asked to move positions while posing for photographs in front of the media.\n\nPrincess Isabella of Denmark's best moments\n\nPrince Vincent and Princess Josephine\n\nPrince Vincent and Princess Josephine, 13, are the youngest children of Queen Mary and King Frederik.\n\nIn August 2010, the palace announced Queen Mary was expecting twins, the first set of twins born in line to the Danish throne in more than 350 years.\n\nMary was 38 when she gave birth on January 8, 2011 at the Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen University Hospital).\n\nThey are fourth and fifth in the line of succession after their father and two older siblings.\n\nPrince Vincent arrived at 10.30am and 26 minutes later came Princess Josephine.\n\nREAD MORE: Official portrait revealed of King Frederik X after abdication in 900-year first\n\nThey both have the titles of Their Royal Highnesses, Prince/Princess of Denmark and Count/Countess of Monpezat\n\nVincent and Josephine were christened inside Holmen's Church on April 14, 2011.\n\nTheir full names are Vincent Frederik Minik Alexander and Princess Josephine Sophia Ivalo Mathilda.\n\nWhile Prince Vincent wore the royal family's historic christening gown, Josephine was dressed in a gown from Queen Ingrid's belongings. It was made around 1940 but had never been worn.\n\nIn 2011, Mary and Frederik brought all four children to Australia for a royal tour. Mary travelled on a plane with her twins, while King ueenFrederik landed a few hours later on a separate flight with Prince Christian and Princess Isabella, due to royal protocol.\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Mary becomes Queen of Denmark - how the day unfolded\n\nThe eight-month-old twins were introduced to Australia at Admiralty House in Sydney and were on their best behaviour. Perhaps the secret was the Aussie toys they were holding – a koala and kangaroo.\n\nOn August 15, 2017, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine started at the Tranegårdskolen (Tranegård School) in Gentofte, joining their older brother and sister.\n\nWhile Princess Josephine was happy about the prospect of starting school, Prince Vincent was a little teary and only smiled after a few hugs from mum.\n\nThe twins are quickly increasing their repertoire of royal duties. Vincent and Josephine accompany their parents and siblings at many official engagements and enjoy the same sports as Christian and Isabella, with a focus on horse riding and athletics."
