        "text": "The Queen is in mourning following the news that her relative, Lady Elizabeth Shakerley, has died at the age of 79.\n\nShe was one of the Queen's closest confidantes, her party-planner as well as a cousin on her mother's side, throwing numerous soirées for Her Majesty over six decades.\n\nShe was born The Hon. Elizabeth Georgiana Anson at Windsor Castle on 7 June 1941, her parents were Thomas Anson, Viscount Anson, and Anne Bowes-Lyon, the cousin of the Queen (Anne was a niece of the Queen Mother). The families were close - the Queen's father, King George VI, was Elizabeth's godfather. After her parents divorce, her mother married Prince George Valdemar of Denmark and became Princess Anne of Denmark.\n\nHer royal connections meant that she was a regular at royal events across Europe, from being a bridesmaid at the wedding of Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands and Jonkheer Claus van Amsberg, to attending the 80th birthday celebrations in Oslo of The King and Queen of Norway.\n\nShe became a party planner for the Queen in 1960, working on events including Her Majesty's 80th birthday, as well as a reception on the evening ahead of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding. Through this work, she also ended up organising other high society soirées, from Sting's wedding to Margaret Thatcher's 70th, to the wedding of Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece, and Marie-Chantal Miller.\n\nAt her own wedding to Sir Geoffrey Shakerley, 6th Baronet at Westminster Abbey in 1972, guests included the Queen, Queen Mother and Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, with Princess Anne acting as one of the bridesmaids.\n\nThe couple had one daughter together, Fiona, and two grandchildren, Noah and Ruby, but divorced in 2009.\n\nDiscreet and professional, she rarely gave interviews or spoke publically about the Queen, but did reveal some of her tastes during a rare interview with Tatler in 2012: 'For years it was believed that the Queen loved only yellow freesia. They appeared on every table decoration. Until I offered her an alternative and we discovered that she loved all sorts of blooms, from peonies to white roses. The Queen is the most meticulous host. She checks every dining-room setting, every flower, every guest bedroom and always chooses her own menu. We could all learn something from that.'\n\nHer death comes just months after the Queen made her a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, as the Court Circular outlined in April: 'The Lady Elizabeth Shakerley has been appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order by The Queen today and has received the Insignia.'"
