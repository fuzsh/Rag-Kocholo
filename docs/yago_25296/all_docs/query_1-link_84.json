        "text": "Early life\n\nPrince Valdemar was born on 27 October 1858 at Bernstorff Palace in Gentofte north of Copenhagen. His father was Prince Christian of Denmark, later King Christian IX. His mother was Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel. He was baptised on 21 December 1858.\n\nIn March 1863, the Danish royal family, including four-year-old Valdemar, travelled to London for the wedding of his eldest sister, Alexandra, to the Prince of Wales, the son and heir of Queen Victoria. That November, his parents succeeded to the throne of Denmark following the death of King Frederick VII.\n\nPrince Valdemar received his early education from tutors. In the summer of 1874, he accompanied his father during his visit to Iceland for the millennium celebrations. After his confirmation in 1874, as was customary for princes at that time, he started a military education and entered the naval college. In 1879, he was sub-lieutenant and in 1880 lieutenant. In the following years, he participated in several naval expeditions. From 1883, Valdemar lived at Bernstorff Palace near Copenhagen with his nephew Prince George of Greece, who had been taken as a boy to Denmark to be enlisted in the Danish royal navy, and be consigned to the care of Valdemar, who was an admiral in the Danish fleet. Feeling abandoned by his father on this occasion, George would later describe to his fiancée the profound attachment he developed for his uncle from that day forward.\n\nMarriage\n\nHe married Princess Marie d'Orleans on 20 October 1885 in a civil ceremony in Paris. They had a religious ceremony on 22 October 1885 at the Château d'Eu, the residence of Prince Philippe, Count of Paris. Among the most notable attendants were Valdemar's mother Queen Louise of Denmark, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and Marie's parents the Duke and Duchess of Chartres.\n\nThe wedding was believed by one source to have been politically arranged, and in France, it was believed that the Count of Paris (the bride's uncle) was personally responsible for the match. However, the same source claimed that \"there was every reason to believe that [it was] a genuine love match\".\n\nAt the time of their marriage, it was decided that any sons would be brought up in Valdemar's Lutheran faith, while any daughters would be raised as Catholics, the faith of their mother. The couple's four sons were consequently Lutherans, while their only daughter, Margaret was raised a Catholic and married a Catholic prince.\n\nLater life\n\nValdemar had a lifelong naval career, but things could have been much different for the prince. He was offered two European thrones, those of Bulgaria and Norway, but declined them due to international pressures. He was the first president of the Seamen's Association of 1856.\n\nHe died on 14 January 1939 in the Yellow Palace in Copenhagen and was buried in Roskilde Cathedral. He was the last surviving child of Christian IX.\n\nIssue\n\nPrince Aage of Denmark (1887–1940), married Matilda Calvi dei conti di Bergolo in 1914 and had one son\n\nPrince Axel of Denmark (1888–1964), married Margaretha of Sweden in 1919 and had two sons\n\nPrince Erik of Denmark (1890–1950), married Lois Frances Booth in Ottawa, Canada 1924, divorced 1937, and had a son and a daughter.\n\nPrince Viggo of Denmark (1893–1970), created Count of Rosenborg, married Eleonora Green, and had no children\n\nPrincess Margaret of Denmark (1895–1992), married Prince René of Bourbon-Parma. Her daughter Anne was the wife of Michael, former King of Romania.\n\nTitles and styles\n\n27 October 1858 – 14 January 1939: His Royal Highness Prince Valdemar of Denmark\n\nHonours\n\nUnited Kingdom - Honorary Knight Grand Cross (Civil) of the Order of the Bath (GCB) - 17 September 1901 - - during a private visit to Denmark by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra"
