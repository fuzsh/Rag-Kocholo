        "text": "This Sunday, when Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary ride to Frederik VIII’s Palace in Amalienborg to become the Queen and King of Denmark, one particular person will be by their side: their son, Prince Christian. At a mere 18 years old, the teenager will then be named first in line for the Danish throne following the abdication of his grandmother, Queen Margrethe—and, in the process, will become one of the youngest crown princes in the modern day.\n\nWith his father’s new role, both Christian and his three younger siblings—Isabella, Vincent, and Josephine—are stepping into a global spotlight that will likely be a permanent one. There will be more official appearances and roles for each, especially since Queen Margrethe streamlined the Danish monarchy to include fewer working members. Here’s everything you need to know about Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary’s four children.\n\nPrince Christian\n\nUpon his father’s succession, H.R.H. Prince Christian will become next in line for the throne. At age 18, he’s already amassed the impressive title of Christian Valdemar Henri John, Prince of Denmark, Count of Monpezat. Currently, he attends high school in Gentofte, a suburb north of Copenhagen. In August 2024, he will likely be heading to university.\n\nThis past October, he threw a grand royal gala dinner at Christiansborg Castle to celebrate his 18th birthday. Young European royals such as Princess Elisabeth of Belgium, Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway, and Princess Estelle of Sweden all attended.\n\nPrincess Isabella\n\nPrincess Isabella Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe was born on April 21, 2007, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Currently, she attends high school in the Copenhagen suburb of Hellerup. (In January 2020, she was set to do a term at the international school Lemania-Verbier in Switzerland, however that was cut short due to COVID-19.)\n\nThe 16-year-old has been making more public appearances as of late, including attending her brother’s 18th birthday earlier this year and posing for a photo call for her confirmation in April 2022.\n\nPrince Vincent and Princess Josephine\n\nThe 13-year-old Prince Vincent was born on January 11, 2001. Come January 14, 2024, he will be third in line for the Danish throne.\n\nAs a young teenager, Prince Vincent remains on the fringes of the royal spotlight–however, his parents shared a portrait for his recent birthday, where he posed alongside his twin sister Josephine. In it, he looks polished in a simple navy blue suit.\n\nBorn a mere few minutes after her brother, Vincent, Princess Josephine is currently in sixth grade at Kildegård Privatskole. The fifth in line for the throne occasionally makes official appearances alongside her famous family, including during a 2018 trip to the Faroe Islands. In her most recent birthday portrait, she wore a light blue blouse and a brooch on her lapel."
