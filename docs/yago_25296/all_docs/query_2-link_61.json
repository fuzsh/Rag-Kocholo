        "text": "Christian IX (April 8, 1818 – January 29, 1906) was King of Denmark from November 15, 1863 until his death in 1906. From 1863 to 1864, he was concurrently Duke of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg.\n\nA younger son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse-Cassel who was born at Gottorp, Schleswig, in the Duchy of Schleswig, to Prince Charles of Hesse-Cassel and his wife Princess Louise of Denmark, the daughter of King Frederik V of Denmark and Louise of Great Britain.\n\nHer elder sister Marie Sophie of Hesse-Cassel became Queen consort of King Frederik VI of Denmark.\n\nPrince Christian grew up in the Duchy of Schleswig as a Prince of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a junior branch of the House of Oldenburg which had ruled Denmark since 1448.\n\nAlthough having close family ties to the Danish royal family, he was originally not in the immediate line of succession to the Danish throne.\n\nFollowing the early death of his father in 1831, Christian grew up in Denmark and was educated at the Military Academy of Copenhagen. After unsuccessfully seeking the hand of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in marriage, he married his double second cousin, Princess Louise of Hesse-Cassel, in 1842.\n\nPrincess Louise of Hesse-Cassel Louise was born as the daughter of Prince Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel and Princess Charlotte of Denmark. Princess Charlotte was a daughter to Prince Frederik, Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway, and Princess Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nHer father, Prince Frederik, Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway, was a younger son of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway, while her mother was a daughter of Duke Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. At birth she had two older siblings, Prince Christian Frederik (who later became King of Norway in 1814 and was King of Denmark as Christian VIII from 1839) and Princess Juliane Sophie. She later had a younger brother, Prince Frederik Ferdinand.\n\nPrincess Louise of Hesse-Cassel lived in Denmark from the age of three.\n\nIn 1852, Christian was chosen as heir-presumptive to the Danish throne in light of the expected extinction of the senior line of the House of Oldenburg. Upon the death of King Frederik VII of Denmark in 1863, Christian (who was Frederik’s second cousin and husband of Frederik’s paternal first cousin, Louise of Hesse-Cassel) acceded to the throne as the first Danish monarch of the House of Glücksburg.\n\nThe beginning of his reign was marked by the Danish defeat in the Second Schleswig War and the subsequent loss of the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg which made the king immensely unpopular. The following years of his reign were dominated by political disputes, for Denmark had only become a constitutional monarchy in 1849 and the balance of power between the sovereign and parliament was still in dispute.\n\nIn spite of his initial unpopularity and the many years of political strife, in which the king was in conflict with large parts of the population, his popularity recovered towards the end of his reign, and he became a national icon due to the length of his reign and the high standards of personal morality with which he was identified.\n\nQueen Louise died at age 81 on September 29, 1898 at Bernstorff Palace near Copenhagen. King Christian IX survived his wife by seven years, and died peacefully of old age, at age 87, on 29 January 1906 at his residence, Christian IX’s Palace at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, after a reign of 42 years and 75 days.\n\nAfter lying in state at the chapel at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, he was interred on 16 February 1906 beside Queen Louise in Christian IX’s Chapel in Roskilde Cathedral on the island of Zealand, the traditional burial site for Danish monarchs since the 15th century.\n\nChristian’s family links with Europe’s royal families earned him the sobriquet “the father-in-law of Europe”. Four of Christian’s children sat on the thrones (either as monarchs or as consorts) of Denmark, Greece, the United Kingdom and Russia. His youngest son, Valdemar, was on 10 November 1886 elected as new Prince of Bulgaria by The 3rd Grand National Assembly of Bulgaria but Christian IX refused to allow Prince Valdemar to receive the election.\n\nThe great dynastic success of the six children was to a great extent not attributable to Christian himself, but the result of the ambitions of his wife Louise of Hesse-Cassel. An additional factor was that Denmark was not one of the Great Powers, so the other powers did not fear that the balance of power in Europe would be upset by a marriage of one of its royalty to another royal house.\n\nChristian’s grandsons included Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, King Constantine I of the Hellenes, King George V of the United Kingdom, King Christian X of Denmark and King Haakon VII of Norway.\n\nToday, most of Europe’s reigning and ex-reigning royal families are direct descendants of King Christian IX, and most current European monarchs are descended from him, including King Frederik X of Denmark, King Charles III of the United Kingdom, King Philippe of Belgium, King Harald V of Norway, King Felipe VI of Spain and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg.\n\nThe former consort Queen Sofía of Spain is also an agnatic descendant of King Christian IX, as was King Constantine II, the former and last King of the Hellenes, and his consort the former Queen Anne-Marie. Former King Michael I of Romania and his wife Queen Anne were also descendants of King Christian IX.\n\nPrincess Marina of Greece and Denmark, Duchess of Kent (December 13, 1906 – August 27, 1968).\n\nShe was a daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, the only daughter and youngest child of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia and Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nWhile her mother, Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, was the only daughter Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, also a granddaughter of Emperor Alexander II of Russia, her father, Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, was a grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\nGrand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, and her husband, Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, were both first cousins of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia.\n\nPrincess Marina was a granddaughter of King George I of the Hellenes and his wife Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russi, the oldest daughter of Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich and his wife, Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg.\n\nMarina spent her early years in Greece, and lived with her parents and paternal grandparents at Tatoi Palace. Along with her sisters, she was raised to be devout and religious, which was encouraged by her grandmother, Queen Olga of Greece. Marina’s family travelled outside of Greece often, especially during the summer months.\n\nHer first recorded visit to Britain was in 1910, when she was 3, after the death of her godfather, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom. During that visit, she met her other godmother and future mother-in-law, Queen Mary, who treated Marina and her sisters like her own children.\n\nPrincess Marina married Prince George of the United Kingdom, Duke of Kent, fourth son of King George V of the United Kingdom and his wife Princess Mary of Teck, in 1934. They had three children: Prince Edward, Princess Alexandra, and Prince Michael.\n\nMarina was widowed in 1942, when her husband was killed in a plane crash on active service. In later life she carried out many royal engagements, including the independence celebrations for Ghana and Botswan.\n\nPrincess Marina had two elder sisters, Princess Olga and Princess Elizabeth. Princess Olga married Prince Paul of Yugoslavia in 1923.\n\nAfter the assassination of his cousin, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, Paul served as Prince Regent of Yugoslavia from 1934 to 1941. Princess Elizabeth married Carl Theodor, Count of Toeering-Jettenbach in 1934. One of their paternal uncles was Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, the father of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (making Marina and her sisters Philip’s first cousins).\n\nPrincess Marina, Duchess of Kent, died of a brain tumour at Kensington Palace at 11.40 am on August 27, 1968, aged 61. The funeral service for the Princess was held at St. George’s Chapel on August 30th.\n\nShe was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore. Her funeral was the last royal ceremony attended by her brother-in-law, the former King Edward VIII. Her will was sealed in London after her death in 1968. Her estate was valued at £76,166 (or £940,600 in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).\n\nLater years and death\n\nBetween March 22 and 24, 1905, Princess Victoria, along with her mother, her younger sister Princess Maud (future Queen Maud of Norway) and her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Denmark (future Haakon VII, King of Norway), made an official visit to Portugal on the royal yacht HMY Victoria and Albert following a visit by the Portuguese monarch to the United Kingdom a year prior.\n\nOn the first day of her arrival, Victoria stayed on the royal yacht due to poor health. Queen Alexandra with her daughter Princess Maud and Prince Charles met with Queen Amélie and Queen Dowager Maria Pia.\n\nThe next day, accompanied by her sister, Victoria paid a visit to King Carlos of Portugal and Queen Amélie and their sons. Queen Amélie was born a Princess of Orléans and was the eldest daughter of Prince Philippe of Orléans, Count of Paris and Princess Marie Isabelle d’Orleans. On March 24, the British guests left for their homeland.\n\nAfter the death of her father, King Edward VII, in 1910, Victoria remained in the shadow of her mother. Queen Alexandra suffered from constant depression and was practically deaf. Victoria accompanied her mother during her visits to various institutions and on holidays.\n\nOnce, when the dowager queen was unable to attend the charity event Alexandra Rose Day, she sent her daughters Louise and Victoria together, and the latter later recorded in her diary that “it was terrible to be there without dear Mama.” With continuing public hostility toward Germany during World War I, King George V decided to renounce all German titles and honours.\n\nWith the passing of the Titles Deprivation Act all members of the royal family did the same. King George V renamed the ruling dynasty from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor, after his favourite castle. Princess Victoria followed suit and adopted the surname Windsor.\n\nAfter the death of Queen Alexandra in 1925, Victoria moved to Coppins, in the village of Iver, Buckinghamshire, where she lived until her death. In her final years, Victoria enjoyed listening to music, gardening, and taking an active part in addressing local issues and problems. Victoria became a patron to the young cellist Beatrice Harrison and her sisters May and Margaret, who also studied music, and she paid for Harrison’s valuable Guarneri cello.\n\nVictoria received the Harrison sisters regularly at her home and at Sandringham, and attended concerts at the Wigmore Hall with them. She also commissioned HMV to make her some private recordings in August 1928: the recordings, capturing Victoria at the piano accompanying Beatrice Harrison on the cello and May Harrison on the violin, would many years later be commercially released, though Victoria’s musicianship would generate mixed reviews.\n\nOther friends of Victoria included members of the Musgrave family, the widowed 5th Earl of Rosebery, and Violet Vivian, a former lady-in-waiting to Queen Alexandra. Lady Musgrave was Victoria’s lifelong friend and lady-in-waiting. The princess assisted Violet Vivian in the design of the Cestyll Garden near the village of Cemaes on the northwest coast of Anglesey.\n\nVictoria died in the early hours of December 3, 1935 at the age of 67 at her home. She had been in poor health over the previous month, culminating in a severe haemorrhage on December 1st. The State Opening of Parliament, planned for December 3rd, was cancelled in response to her death, and instead the already-written King’s Speech was read to Parliamentarians by the Lord Chancellor without ceremony.\n\nHer funeral took place on December 7, 1935 at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, where she was initially buried. The mourners at the funeral included Victoria’s brother George V. George himself was in poor health, and his doctor pushed for the funeral service to be shortened; he was unsuccessful, and George’s final deterioration and death on January 20, 1936 would later be blamed on the physical strain of the long event.\n\nVictoria’s remains were later moved and reburied at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, Windsor Great Park, on January 8, 1936. Her will was sealed in London in 1936. Her estate was valued at £237,455 (or £11.7 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).\n\nVictoria Alexandra Olga Maria was born on July 6, 1868 at Marlborough House, London. She was the fourth child of Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, (future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom) and his wife Princess Alexandra of Denmark, Princess of Wales.\n\nVictoria’s father was the eldest son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert, the Prince Consort, Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Her mother was the eldest daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Princess Louise of Hesse-Cassel .\n\nAmong those close to her, the Princess was known as Toria. From birth, as the granddaughter of the British monarch, she had the title Her Royal Highness Princess Victoria of Wales. When her father became King she was styled as Her Royal Highness The Princess Victoria.\n\nIn 1885, Princess Victoria was a bridesmaid at the wedding of her aunt Princess Beatrice to Prince Henry of Battenberg. She was also a bridesmaid at the wedding of her brother Prince George, Duke of York and Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, the future King George V and Queen Mary of the United Kingdom.\n\nPrincess Victoria was educated at home with her sisters. The princess grew up at Marlborough House and Sandringham under the supervision of tutors. She occasionally spent the summer in Denmark, her mother’s homeland. In her youth, she was described as “a lively, mischievous girl … smart, tall and elegant; she had a wonderful sense of humour and was a good friend to everyone; she had big expressive blue eyes; there was no pretense or hint of a high position in her.”\n\nVictoria loved horse riding, cycling, reading, listening to music and dancing. The princess’s particular passion was photography. She compiled several albums of family photographs. Victoria’s works have been displayed at several different exhibitions. She was very fond of animals. Her favorites were dogs named Sam, Mas and Punchy. For six years Victoria had a tamed pigeon, which she took with her on walks and travels in a small basket.\n\nVictoria maintained friendly relations with her cousins in Russia and Greece. The future Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, who was her first cousin (son of Princess Dagmar of Denmark who was a sister to Victoria’s mother, Princess Alexandra of Denmark), and exactly the same age as her, was in love with her in his youth.\n\nThe Tsarevich liked Princess Victoria for her seriousness, thoroughness, and “unfeminine mind.” In 1889, describing the princess, Tsarevich Nicholas told his close friend, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich: “She is a truly wonderful creature, and the more and deeper you delve into her soul, the clearer you see all her virtues and qualities.\n\nI must confess that it is very difficult to figure it out at first, i.e. to learn her view of things and people, but this difficulty is a special charm for me, which I am unable to explain.” The princess also caught the eyes of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, and later, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich was fascinated by her.\n\nAnother candidate to seek Victoria’s hand in marriage was her cousin, Crown Prince Christian of Denmark, who later became King Christian X of Denmark.\n\nPrincess Victoria rejected him, much to the disappointment of her parents. Yet another contender for marriage was King Carlos I of Portugal. He demanded that Victoria accept the Catholic faith, which did not sit well with her parents. The 5th Earl of Rosebery also attempted to win her attention, in vain. Victoria never married, and her mother was said to be supportive of this decision.\n\nVictoria was particularly close to her parents, and if she appeared in public, it was usually in their company, as was usual in those days for a spinster. The princess accompanied her parents during official events and ceremonies, and helped them in private life. Her first cousin, the Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, remarked in later life that she “felt so very sorry” for Victoria, as she seemed within her family to be “a glorified maid to her mother,” attributing her staying unmarried to a disinclination to oppose her mother. “I’d something of a rebel in me. Toria had not.”\n\nClose as she was to her parents, the person to whom Victoria was closest was her older brother Prince George, who in 1910 became King George V of the United Kingdom and Emperor of India. Throughout their lives, which ended within a month of each other, the king-emperor and his sister maintained a warm relationship. They had similar characters and a mutual sense of humour.\n\nShe was not close to his wife, Queen Mary, née Princess Mary of Teck, whom she described as “terribly boring”. This was attributed to their different characters, education and interests.\n\nEmperor Alexander II of Russia and Empress Maria Alexandrovna had grown fond of Dagmar, and they wanted her to marry their new heir, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich. In an affectionate letter, Emperor Alexander II told Dagmar that he hoped she would still consider herself a member of their family.\n\nEmpress Maria Alexandrovna tried to convince Louise of Hesse-Cassel to send Dagmar to Russia immediately, but Louise insisted that Dagmar must “strengthen her nerves… [and] avoid emotional upsets.” Dagmar, who sincerely mourned Nicholas, and Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich, who was in love with his mother’s lady-in-waiting Mariya Meshcherskaya, and attempted to renounce his place as heir to the throne in order to marry her, were both initially reluctant. However, under pressure from his parents, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich decided to go to Denmark.\n\nIn June 1866, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich arrived in Copenhagen with his brothers Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich. While looking over photographs of Nicholas, Alexander asked Dagmar if “she could love him after having loved Nixa, to whom they were both devoted.” She answered that she could love no one but him, because he had been so close to his brother.\n\nTsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich recalled that “we both burst into tears… [and] I told her that my dear Nixa helped us much in this situation and that now of course he prays about our happiness.” On June 17, he proposed to her during a picnic to the beach at Hellebæk by the coast of the Øresund strait near Elsinore and received a yes.\n\nThe engagement was announced on June 23rd at Fredensborg Palace. Both Dagmar and Alexander quickly embraced the prospect of marrying each other, and were soon described as genuinely enthusiastic.\n\nIn the time leading up to Dagmar’s departure to Russia, many festive events took place in Copenhagen, On September 22, 1866, Dagmar left Copenhagen on board the Danish royal yacht Slesvig escorted by the armoured frigate Peder Skram, and accompanied by her brother, Crown Prince Frederik.\n\nHans Christian Andersen, who had occasionally been invited to tell stories to Dagmar and her siblings when they were children, was among the crowd which flocked to the quay in order to see her off. The writer remarked in his diary, “Yesterday, at the quay, while passing me by, she stopped and took me by the hand.\n\nMy eyes were full of tears. What a poor child! Oh Lord, be kind and merciful to her! They say that there is a brilliant court in Saint Petersburg and the tsar’s family is nice; still, she heads for an unfamiliar country, where people are different and religion is different and where she will have none of her former acquaintances by her side.”\n\nDagmar was warmly welcomed in Kronstadt by the emperor’s brother Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich of Russia and escorted to St. Petersburg, where she was greeted by her future mother-in-law and sister-in-law on September 24th.\n\nThe weather on this September day was almost summery with temperatures of more than 20 degrees, which was noted by the poet Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev in the welcome poem dedicated to the arrival of the princess: The sky is light blue… On the 29th, she made her formal entry in to the Russian capital dressed in a Russian national costume in blue and gold and traveled with the Empress to the Winter Palace where she was introduced to the Russian public on a balcony.\n\nCatherine Radziwill described the occasion: “rarely has a foreign princess been greeted with such enthusiasm… from the moment she set foot on Russian soil, succeeded in winning to herself all hearts. Her smile, the delightful way she had of bowing to the crowds…, laid immediately the foundation of …popularity”\n\nIn the following weeks, Dagmar was educated in Russian court etiquette. She converted to Russian Orthodoxy on October 24, 1866 and became Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia the following day. However, at the Russian court, where French was practically the first language, she was often called “Marie”.\n\nThe lavish wedding took place on November 9 , 1866 in the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the wedding, and in their stead, they sent her brother, Crown Prince Frederik. Her brother-in-law, Prince Albert Edward of the United Kingdom, the Prince of Wales, had also travelled to Saint Petersburg for the ceremony; pregnancy had Prevented Princess Alexandra, the Princess of Wales, from attending.\n\nAfter the wedding night, Tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich wrote in his diary, “I took off my slippers and my silver embroidered robe and felt the body of my beloved next to mine… How I felt then, I do not wish to describe here. Afterwards we talked for a long time.”\n\nFrom The Emperor’s Desk: Before I address the wedding of Princess Dagmar of Denmark and Emperor Alexander III of Russia, I will cover Dagmar’s engagement to Alexander’s brother, Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia.\n\nPrincess Dagmar of Denmark [Maria Feodorovna] (November 26, 1847 – October 13, 1928), known before her marriage as Princess Dagmar of Denmark, was Empress of Russia from 1881 to 1894 as the wife of Emperor Alexander III.\n\nShe was the fourth child and second daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Cassel, the daughter of Prince Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel and Princess Charlotte of Denmark, a daughter of Frederik, Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway, and Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Her\n\nPrincess Charlotte of Denmark’s father was a younger son of King Frederik V of Denmark and Norway, while her mother was a daughter of Duke Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nAt birth she had two older siblings, Prince Christian Frederik of Denmark and Norway (who later became King Christian Frederik of Norway in 1814 and was King Christian VIII of Denmark from 1839) and Princess Juliane Sophie. She later had a younger brother, Prince Frederik Ferdinand.\n\nGrowing up, she was known by the name Dagmar. Most of her adult life, however, she was known as Maria Feodorovna, the name which she took when she converted to Russian Orthodoxy immediately before her 1866 marriage to the future Emperor Alexander III. Within her family, she was known as “Minnie” throughout her life.\n\nAt the end of 1863, as the daughter and sister of the kings of Denmark and Greece and sister-in-law of the Prince of Wales, Dagmar was now considered one of Europe’s most coveted princesses. She received a proposal from Crown Prince Umberto of Italy, but was reluctant to marry him because she found him unattractive.\n\nHer mother was also reluctant to support such a marriage as she saw a greater status in the prospect of Dagmar marrying into the Russian imperial family. Due to the rise of Slavophile ideology in the Russian Empire, Alexander II of Russia searched for a bride for the heir apparent, Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia, in countries other than the German states that had traditionally provided consorts for the tsars.\n\nPrincess Dagmar was one of the candidates, and as early as 1860 the emperor had made his first inquiries about a possible engagement. There were also already family ties between the two families, as Dagmar’s uncle, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel, had been married to the Emperor’s sister, Grand Duchess Alexandra Nikolaevna of Russia.\n\nIn 1864, the Russian Empress Maria Alexandrovna announced that her son would visit Denmark, and during the summer Nicholas, or “Nixa” as he was known in his family, arrived at Fredensborg Palace, where the Danish royal family was staying. Nicholas had never met Dagmar, but had for a number of years collected photographs of her, and both families wanted the marriage. When they met, Dagmar and Nicholas were mutually attracted, and Nicholas wrote to his mother:\n\nI came here as if in a fever (…) I can not describe to you what came over me, when we approached Fredenborg and I finally saw the sweet Dagmar. How can I describe it? She is so beautiful, direct, intelligent, experienced, and yet shy at the same time. She is even more beautiful in reality than in the pictures we have seen so far.\n\nAfter returning to Russia to obtain his father’s permission, Nicholas proposed to Dagmar on September 28, 1864 in the Bernstorff Palace Gardens and received a yes. The engagement was announced at Bernstorff Palace later the same day. Her future mother-in-law Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse and By Rhine) gave her a six-strand pearl necklace and Nicholas gave her a diamond bracelet. In total, the betrothal gifts Dagmar received from her future in-laws cost 1.5 million rubles.\n\nThe engagement was popular in both countries and at the same time ensured the Danish royal family even better connections. The engagement took place right during the Second Schleswig War between Denmark on one side and Prussia and Austria on the other, and during the peace negotiations after the war in October 1864, Dagmar unsuccessfully asked her future father-in-law to help Denmark against Prussia over the disputed territory of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nIn a letter, she asked Emperor Alexander II of Russia: “Use your power to mitigate the terrible conditions which the Germans have brutally forced Papa to accept… the sad plight of my fatherland, which makes my heart heavy, has inspired me to turn to you.” It is believed that she did it with the consent of her parents, but it is not known if it was at their request. Her appeal was in vain, but from that moment on she became known for her anti-Prussian views.\n\nDeathbed of Tsarevich Nicholas.\n\nAs Nicholas continued on his journey to Florence, Dagmar and Nicholas exchanged daily love letters for months. When he grew ill, Nicholas sent fewer letters and Dagmar teasingly asked him if he had fallen in love with “a dark-eyed Italian”. In April, Nicholas grew gravely ill with cerebrospinal meningitis.\n\nEmperor Alexander II of Russia sent a telegram to Dagmar: “Nicholas has received the Last Rites. Pray for us and come if you can.” On April 22, 1865, Nicholas died in the presence of his parents, brothers, and Dagmar. His last wish was that Dagmar would marry his younger brother, the future Alexander III.\n\nDagmar was devastated by Nicholas’ death. Nicholas’ parents struggled to “pull Princess Dagmar away from the corpse and carry her out.” She was so heartbroken when she returned to her homeland that her relatives were seriously worried about her health. She had already become emotionally attached to Russia and often thought of the huge, remote country that was to have been her home.\n\nMany were sympathetic towards Dagmar. Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge wrote of “poor dear Minny’s sorrow and the blight which has fallen upon her young life.” Queen Victoria wrote “how terrible for poor Dagmar… the poor parents and bride are most deeply to be pitied.”\n\nChristian X (September 26, 1870 – April 20, 1947) was King of Denmark from 1912 to his death in 1947, and the only King of Iceland as Kristján X, in the form of a personal union rather than a political union between 1918 and 1944.\n\nChristian was born on September 26, 1870 at his parents’ country residence, the Charlottenlund Palace, located on the shores of the Øresund Strait 10 kilometers north of Copenhagen on the island of Zealand in Denmark, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Christian IX.\n\nChristian was the first child of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Louise of Sweden. His father was the eldest son of King Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Cassel, and his mother was the only daughter of King Carl XV of Sweden and Norway and Louise of the Netherlands.\n\nHe was a member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sondenburg-Glücksburg, a branch of the House of Oldenburg, and the first monarch since King Frederik VII born into the Danish royal family; both his father and his grandfather were born as princes of a ducal family from Schleswig.\n\nAmong his siblings was King Haakon VII of Norway. His son became Frederik IX of Denmark. Among his cousins were King George V of the United Kingdom, Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, and King Constantine I of Greece, while Queen Maud of Norway, was both his cousin and sister-in-law.\n\nAs a young man, Prince Christian fell in love with the French Princess Marguerite of Orléans, who was the younger sister of his uncle Prince Valdemar’s wife Princess Marie of Orléans.\n\nPrincess Marguerite of Orléans (1869 – 1940) was a member of the House of Orléans, daughter of Prince Robert d’Orléans, Duke of Chartres and Princess Françoise d’Orléans. She bore the courtesy title of Princess of Orleans. Both of her parents were grandchildren of the French King, Louis Philippe I of France.\n\nPrince Christian’s feelings, however, were not reciprocated, and after a few years of unhappy infatuation, she married in 1896 Marie Armand Patrice de Mac Mahon, 2nd Duke of Magenta, son of the French Marshal and President Patrice de MacMahon.\n\nChristian married Duchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in Cannes on 26 April 1898; she was a daughter of Friedrich Franz III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, the only daughter and second child of Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievich of Russia and his wife Princess Cecilie of Baden. Paternally, she was a granddaughter of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia.\n\nDuchess Alexandrine had a sister, Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, (1886 – 1954), who married Prince Wilhelm of Prussia German Crown Prince the eldest son and child of the eldest child of Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia and his wife Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, and thus a great-grandson of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. As Emperor Wilhelm’s heir, he was the last Crown Prince of the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, until the abolition of the monarchy.\n\nDuchess Alexandrine eventually became his queen consort. They had two sons:\n\n1. Prince Frederik (1899–1972), later King Frederik IX of Denmark\n\n2. Prince Knud (1900–1976), later Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark\n\nThe couple were given Christian VIII’s Palace at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen as their residence and Sorgenfri Palace north of Copenhagen as a summer residence. Furthermore, the couple received Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus as a wedding present from the people of Denmark in 1898. In 1914, the King also built the villa Klitgården in Skagen.\n\nOn May 14, 1912, King Frederik VIII died at the age of 68 after collapsing from shortness of breath while taking an evening walk in Hamburg, Germany. He had been returning from a recuperation stay in Nice, France, and was staying anonymously in the city before continuing to Copenhagen.\n\nPrince Christian was in Copenhagen when he heard about his father’s demise and succeeded to the throne at the age of 41. He was proclaimed king from the balcony of Christian VII’s Palace at Amalienborg by the Prime Minister Klaus Berntsen as King Christian X.\n\nHis character has been described as authoritarian and he strongly stressed the importance of royal dignity and power. His reluctance to fully embrace democracy resulted in the Easter Crisis of 1920, in which he dismissed the democratically elected Social Liberal cabinet with which he disagreed, and installed one of his own choosing.\n\nThis action was in accordance with the letter of the constitution, but the principle of parliamentarianism had been considered a constitutional custom since 1901.\n\nFaced with mass demonstrations, a general strike organized by the Social Democrats and the risk of the monarchy being overthrown he was forced to accept that a monarch could not keep a government in office against the will of parliament, as well as his reduced role as a symbolic head of state.\n\nDuring the German occupation of Denmark, Christian became a popular symbol of resistance, particularly because of the symbolic value of the fact that he rode every day through the streets of Copenhagen unaccompanied by guards.\n\nWith a reign spanning two world wars, and his role as a rallying symbol for Danish national sentiment during the German occupation, he became one of the most popular Danish monarchs of modern times. King Christian X was known to parade through town on his horse, Jubilee.\n\nDeath\n\nOn his death in Amalienborg Palace, Copenhagen, in 1947, Christian X was interred along with other members of the Danish royal family in Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen. Although he had been behind the politics of Erik Scavenius, a cloth armband of the type worn by members of the Danish resistance movement was placed on his coffin under a castrum doloris.\n\nKing Christian X of Denmark was succeeded by his eldest son Prince Frederik who became King Frederik IX of Denmark.\n\nHaakon VII (August 3, 1872 – September 21, 1957) was King of Norway from November 1905 until his death in September 1957.\n\nPrince Carl of Denmark was born on August 3, 1872 at his parents’ country residence, Charlottenlund Palace north of Copenhagen, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Christian IX. He was the second son of Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark (the future King Frederik VIII), and his wife Louise of Sweden. His father was the eldest son of King Christian IX and Louise of Hesse-Cassel, and his mother was the only daughter of King Carl XV of Sweden (who was also king of Norway as Carl IV), and Louise of the Netherlands.\n\nAt birth, he was third in the succession to the Danish throne after his father and older brother, but without any real prospect of inheriting the throne. The young prince was baptised at Charlottenlund Palace on September 7, 1872 by the Bishop of Zealand, Hans Lassen Martensen. He was baptised with the names Christian Frederik Carl Georg Valdemar Axel, and was known as Prince Carl (namesake of his maternal grandfather the King Carl XV of Sweden-Norway).\n\nPrince Carl belonged to the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (often shortened to Glücksburg) branch of the House of Oldenburg. The House of Oldenburg had been the Danish royal family since 1448; between 1536 and 1814 it also ruled Norway, which was then part of the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway.\n\nThe house was originally from northern Germany, where the Glücksburg (Lyksborg) branch held their small fief. The family had links with Norway beginning from the 15th century. Several of his paternal ancestors had been kings of Norway in union with Denmark and at times Sweden. They included Christian I of Norway, Frederik I, Christian III, Frederik II, Christian IV, as well as Frederik III of Norway who integrated Norway into the Oldenburg state with Denmark, Schleswig and Holstein. His subsequent paternal ancestors had been dukes in Schleswig-Holstein. Christian Frederik, who was King of Norway briefly in 1814, the first king of the Norwegian 1814 constitution and struggle for independence, was his great-granduncle.\n\nOn October 28, 1895, at the age of 23, Prince Carl was engaged to his first cousin Princess Maud of Wales. Princess Maud was the youngest daughter of the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, and his wife, Princess Alexandra of Denmark, who was Prince Carl’s aunt as the eldest daughter of King Christian IX and Louise of Hesse-Cassel.The wedding was celebrated on July 22, 1896, in the Private Chapel of Buckingham Palace, and was attended by the bride’s grandmother, the 77-year-old Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter the wedding, the couple settled in Copenhagen, where Prince Carl continued his career as a naval officer. They took up residence in the Bernstorff Mansion, an 18th-century Rococo style townhouse owned by Prince Carl’s uncle King George I of Greece, situated in Bredgade immediately adjacent to the Amalienborg Palace complex. Furthermore, the bride’s father gave them Appleton House on the Sandringham Estate as a country residence for his daughter’s frequent visits to England. It was there that the couple’s only child, Prince Alexander, the future Crown Prince Olav (and eventually King Olav V of Norway), was born on 2 July 1903.\n\nPrince Carl was educated at the Royal Danish Naval Academy and served in the Royal Danish Navy. After the 1905 dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway, Prince Carl was offered the Norwegian crown. Following a November plebiscite, he accepted the offer and was formally elected King of Norway by the Storting. He took the Old Norse name Haakon and ascended to the throne as Haakon VII, becoming the first independent Norwegian monarch since 1387.\n\nAs king, Haakon VII gained much sympathy from the Norwegian people. Although the Constitution of Norway vests the King with considerable executive powers, in practice Haakon confined himself to a representative and ceremonial role while rarely interfering in politics, a practice continued by his son and grandson.\n\nNorway was invaded by Nazi Germany in April 1940. Haakon rejected German demands to legitimise the Quisling regime’s puppet government, vowing to abdicate rather than do so. He refused to abdicate after going into exile in Great Britain. As such, he played a pivotal role in uniting the Norwegian nation in its resistance to the invasion and the subsequent five-year-long occupation during the Second World War. He returned to Norway in June 1945 after the defeat of Germany.\n\nHe became King of Norway when his grandfather Christian IX was still reigning in Denmark, and before his father and elder brother became kings of Denmark. During his reign he saw his father Frederick VIII, his elder brother Christian X, and his nephew Frederik IX ascend the throne of Denmark, in 1906, 1912 (also of Iceland from 1918 to 1944), and 1947 respectively. King Haakon VII met with his Queen Elizabeth II of the United the great granddaughter of his father-in-law and uncle King Edward VII of the United Kingdom.\n\nKing Haakon VII died at the age of 85 in September 1957, after having reigned for nearly 52 years. He was succeeded by his only son, who ascended to the throne as Olav V.\n\nPaul (December 14, 1901 – March 6, 1964) was King of Greece from April 1, 1947 until his death in 1964. He was succeeded by his son, Constantine II.\n\nPaul was first cousin to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and father-in-law to King Juan Carlos I of Spain, and the grandfather of Spain’s curent monarch, King Felipe VI.\n\nPaul was born on December 14, 1901 at the Tatoi Palace in Attica north of Athens, the third son of King Constantine I of the Hellenes and his wife, Princess Sophia of Prussia,nthe daughter of Friedrich III, German Emperor, and Victoria, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom.\n\nHe trained as an army officer at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and later at the Hellenic Military Academy in Kypseli, Athens. Paul was an army officer cadet in the Coldstream Guards and Lieutenant with the Evzones. To his family, he was known as Palo.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1920, Paul lived in exile with his father, Constantine I. From 1923 to 1935, he lived in exile again in England, this time with his brother, George II. He worked briefly in an aircraft factory under an alias, and through Viscount Tredegar met and befriended notorious literary muse Denham Fouts, who later alleged an affair, claiming they had themselves identically tattooed with a small blue insignia above the heart. A friend of Fouts, John B. L. Goodwin said Fouts often made up stories about his life, and literary critic Katherine Bucknell thought many of the tales about him were myths. Henry Ch14, annon wrote in his diary that Paul was a bisexual rake before his marriage.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nOn January 9, 1938, Paul married Princess Frederica of Hanover, Princess of Great Britain and Ireland, and Princess of Brunswick-Lüneburg. She was born on April 18, 1917 in Blankenburg am Harz, in the German Duchy of Brunswick, she was the only daughter and third child of Prince Ernst August, then reigning Duke of Brunswick, and his wife Princess Viktoria Luise of Prussia, herself the only daughter of the German Emperor Wilhelm II.\n\nErnst August was born at Penzing near Vienna, the sixth and youngest child of former Crown Prince Ernst August of Hanover, Duke of Cumberland and his wife, Princess Thyra of Denmark, daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark. His great-grandfather, Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, the fifth son of George III of the United Kingdom, became king of Hanover in 1837 because Salic Law barred Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom, from inheriting the Hanoverian throne.\n\nPrincess Thyra of Denmark was the sister of King George I of the Hellenes the grandfather of King Paul of the Hellenes.\n\nPrincess Frederica of Hanover was Paul’s first cousin once removed through Friedrich III, German Emperor, and Victoria, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom, and second cousin through Christian IX of Denmark, in Athens. They had three children:\n\n1. Sophia, Queen of Spain (born 1938)\n\n2. Constantine II, King of the Hellenes (1940–2023)\n\n3. Irene (born 1942)\n\nWorld War II\n\nDuring most of World War II, from 1941 to 1946, when Greece was under German occupation, Paul was with the Greek government-in-exile in London and Cairo. From Cairo, he broadcast messages to the Greek people.\n\nReign\n\nPaul returned to Greece in 1946. He succeeded to the throne in 1947, upon the death of his childless elder brother, King George II, during the Greek Civil War (between Greek Communists and the non-communist Greek government). In 1947 he was unable to attend the wedding of his first cousin, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh to the future Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom as he was suffering from typhoid fever.\n\nBy 1949 the Civil War was effectively over, with the Communist insurgents ceasing the majority of their operations, and the task of rebuilding the shattered north of the country began.\n\nIn the 1950s Greece recovered economically, and diplomatic and trade links were strengthened by Paul’s state visits abroad. He became the first Greek Monarch to visit a Turkish Head of State. However, links with Britain became strained over Cyprus, where the majority Greek population favored union with Greece, which Britain, as the colonial power, would not endorse. Eventually, Cyprus became an independent state in 1960.\n\nIn December 1959, Prince Maximillian of Bavaria presented King Otto’s coronation regalia to Paul. It had been almost a century since they were last in Greece.\n\nMeanwhile, republican sentiment was growing in Greece. Both Paul and Frederica attracted criticism for their interference in politics, frequent foreign travels, and the cost of maintaining the Royal Family. Paul responded by economising and donated his private estate at Polidendri to the State.\n\nIn 1959, he had an operation for a cataract, and in 1963 an emergency operation for appendicitis. In late February 1964, he underwent a further operation for stomach cancer, and about a week later on March 6, 1964, King Paul died in Athens. He was succeeded by his son, Constantine II.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: Yesterday I did a blog entry of Prince Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. I had done a blog entry of her sister Princess Alexandra Victoria a short while ago. Today I am doing an entry of their entire family.\n\nFriedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (12 October 12, 1855 – January 21, 1934), was born in Kiel, Duchy of Holstein, the eldest son of Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Princess Adelheid of Schaumburg-Lippe and a nephew of King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\nAlbert of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (February 26, 1869 – April 27, 1931), was a grandson of Queen Victoria. He was the second son of Victoria’s daughter Princess Helena by her husband Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg.\n\nIn 1921, Prince Albert succeeded his childless cousin Duke Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. This was the senior branch of the House of Oldenburg, to which the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, the Emperor of Russia, the King of Denmark, the King of Norway, the King of the Hellenes, the King of the United Kingdom and the Grand Duke of Oldenburg belonged.\n\nDuke Albert was succeeded by his distant cousin Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (who happened to be also the husband of a daughter of Albert’s uncle Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg).\n\nIssue\n\nMarriage and Issue\n\nFriedrich Ferdinand married Princess Caroline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, second daughter of Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and his wife Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, on March 19, 1885 at Primkenau. Princess Caroline Mathilde was the younger sister of Prince Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg the wife of German Emperor Wilhelm II.\n\nFriedrich Ferdinand and Caroline Mathilde had six children:\n\n1.
