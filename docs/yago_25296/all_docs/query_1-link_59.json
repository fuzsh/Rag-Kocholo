        "text": "Crown Princess Mary turns 50-years-old on 6 February 2022, only a few weeks after her mother-in-law celebrated her 50th anniversary on the throne. And she does so, surrounded by the family she created when she married the future King.\n\nCrown Prince Frederik met Mary Donaldson in a Sydney pub while on a break from the 2000 Olympic Games. The two maintained a long-distance relationship before Mary moved to Europe, first in Paris and then to Copenhagen.\n\nOn 8 October 2003, the couple became officially engaged, with Queen Margrethe consenting to the marriage during the State Council and the couple appearing for a joint press conference, during which Mary demonstrated her language skills, answering a few reporter questions in Danish.\n\nThe engagement ring, a symbol of the country that was to adopt the Aussie-born future Princess, showcased a diamond flanked by two rubies. Two more diamonds were added in 2012 at each side of the rubies, for a total of five stones on a simple band.\n\nAnd then, the fairytale wedding at Copenhagen Cathedral, in the presence of hundreds of guests that included members of both families, was a clear sign of what their future was going to look like.\n\nSeventeen months after saying “I do,” Crown Princess Mary gave birth to the couple’s first child, Prince Christian Valdemar Henri John, on 15 October 2005.\n\nPrincess Isabella Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe was soon to follow, arriving into the world on 21 April 2007 (interesting fact, she shares a birthday with Queen Elisabeth II, albeit with an 81 years difference).\n\nLastly, the couple welcomed twins Prince Vincent Frederik Minik Alexander and Princess Josephine Sophia Ivalo Mathilda on 8 January 2011.\n\nSince she entered Crown Prince Frederik’s life, she has also been praised for fitting seamlessly into her new family. It was clear from the beginning that Queen Margrethe very much approved of her, and the fact that she could speak French made her a favourite with Prince Henrik.\n\nBut the excellent relations she maintains with her in-laws doesn’t mean she has distanced herself from her own family. Her father took up jobs in Europe and ever guest lectured in Denmark to be closer to his daughter, and the Crown Princess visits her siblings as often as she can.\n\nAnd surely, if the situation will allow it, her family, in its most extended sense, will gather around Crown Princess Mary to celebrate such a milestone birthday."
