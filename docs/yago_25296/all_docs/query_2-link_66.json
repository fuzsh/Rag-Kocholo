        "text": "1913- death of George I of Greece. I know Greek royal, but he was born Prince William of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg. His first name was Christian but he went by William, which was in honor of both of his grandfathers. He was the second son of Christian IX and Louise of Hesse-Kassel. They were a relatively obscure branch of the royal family when he was born. His father was made the heir of Frederick VII in 1852. One of the main reasons seemed to be Louise. Louise's mother was Princess Charlotte of Denmark, a niece of Christian VII (Charlotte's father was Frederick, hereditary prince of Denmark was Christian's half brother and served as his regent until a coup put Frederick V as regent). Christian's own claim was weaker then his wife. The closest claim was his maternal grandmother was Louise of Denmark, a daughter of Frederick V.\n\nWilliam/George was the 3 of 6 children of his parents. His father becoming known as the father in law of Europe.\n\nHis siblings included:\n\n-Christian: who became Frederick VIII and married Louise of Sweden. He was the great-grandfather of Queen Margrethe, King Harald and King Albert of Belgium, and great great grandfather of GD Henri of Luxembourg.\n\n-Alexandra: married future Edward VII of UK. Great-grandmother of Queen Elizabeth II and King Harald of Norway.\n\n-Dagmar: she married Alexander III of Russia and was mother of Nicholas II. She had living descendants from her younger children.\n\n-Thyra-married prince Ernst August of Hannover.

Their sons were raised in his faith, and their one daughter a Catholic. Three of his sons renounced their titles and became Counts of Rosenberg. His only son who didn't was Prince Axel who married Princess Margarethe of Sweden (Margarethe's mother was Valdemar's niece). Their son George married a niece of the Queen Mum. The couple's only daughter Margaret married Prince Rene of Bourbon-Parma. She was the mother of Queen Anne of Romania.\n\nFollowing the overthrow of Otto of Greece, and refusal to allow his brother Lutipold to succeed, the Greeks were looking for a new monarch. Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh was their top choice and won the election. Victoria though was opposed to her son taking the throne. The queen's brother in law and nephew were both considered. William received 6 votes and at the age of 17 he was elected as the new king of Greece. He took the throne before his father did.\n\nHe met Grand Duchess Olga at first when she was 12, and later when he was visiting his sister Dagmar. Olga was a cousin of Dagmar's husband Alexander. Olga's father was the younger brother of Tsar Alexander II. They married in 1867 in Russia when she was 16. Marriage to an Orthodox princess was meant to assure the people of Greece that the royal children would be raised Orthodox which was the main religion in Greece.\n\nThe couple had eight children:\n\n-Constantine: Became Constantine I of Greece and married Sophie of Prussia. He was the grandfather of King Constantine II and Queen Sofia of Spain.\n\n-George: who married Princess Marie Bonaparte. Marie's great-grandfather was Lucien Bonaparte, a younger brother of Napoleon.\n\n-Alexandra: married Grand Duke Paul of Russia. Paul was a brother in law to George's sister Dagmar as he was younger brother of Alexander III.\n\n-Nicholas: married Grand Duchess Elena. Her father was a younger brother of Alexander III. Their children included Princess Marina, the late Duchess of Kent, mother of the current Duke of Kent.\n\n-Maria- married Grand Duke George, a grandson of Tsar Nicholas. Her first husband was killed by firing squad during the Russian revolution.\n\n-Olga-died in infancy\n\n-Andrew-married to Prince Alice of Battenberg. Father of Prince Philip.\n\n-Christopher- his first marriage to Anastasia Worthington Leeds was childless. His stepson though William married one of his nieces, Princess Xenia (daughter of Marie). His second marriage was to Princess Francois of Orleans and they had one son Michael born shortly before his death. Michael had two daughters, one of whom is Princess Olga, Duchess of Apulia.\n\nHe was assassinated in 1913. He had planned to abdicate in favor of his son after his jubilee. His assassin was arrested and tortured before falling out a police window six weeks later to his death.\n\nGeorge I's coffin was draped in the flags of both Denmark and Greece. He was buried in a tomb at his palace Tatoi.\n\nMarch 24, 1628 birth of Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Luneburg. Sophie was the consort of Frederick III of Denmark.\n\nShe was the daughter of George, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg. Her paternal grandmother was Dorothea of Denmark. Sophie and her husband's fathers were first cousins, her husband's paternal grandfather being Frederick II. Frederick and Dorothea were the children of Christian III. Her mother was Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt. She was the fifth of their 8 children.\n\nHer siblings:\n\n-Magdalene died the same year she was born\n\n-Christian married Dorothea of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg but he died childless and was succeeded by a brother\n\n-George William succeeded Christian.

She was later divorced, and exiled to Celle, but her son was George II.\n\n-John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Calenberg. He married Benedicta Henrietta of the Palatinate. They had 2 daughters reach adulthood. One married Rinaldo III, Duke of Modena. And the other married Joseph I, Holy Roman emperor.\n\n-Dorothea Magdalene of Brunswick-Luneburg (her first younger sibling) died at the age of one\n\n-Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover married of Sophia of the Palatinate, a maternal granddaughter of James VI through his daughter Elizabeth. Through Sophia, his eldest son would become George I.\n\n-Anna Marie Eleonore of Brunswick-Luneburg lived to be 36 but doesn't seem to have been married.\n\nShe was born at Herzberg castle. She was married to Frederick in 1643. Frederick was the Prince-archbishop of Bremen and not expected to be king. He was the son of Christian IV and his first wife Anne Catherine of Brandenberg. He was the 5th of 6 children of his parents (not including the stillbirth). Elizabeth, Frederik and Sophie had all died young, but his older brother Christian was alive. His younger brother Ulrik died in 1633. He had a number of half-siblings as well. Christian married Magdalene Sibylle of Saxony but they were childless. Christian was a heavy drinker and gambler, heavily in debt when he died. He died in 1647, 4 years after his brother married Sophie. Their father Christian IV would die a year later.\n\nFrederick's election was not a simple one. There were many opposed to him due to his numerous conflicts during his previous posts. He was only named king after he signed an agreement.\n\nSophie and her husband had lived humbly after he had been driven out of Bremen during the war with Sweden. When he was elected crown prince she moved with him to Denmark.Sophie was the life of the court and introduced balls and masquerades. The Danish opera and ballet were both introduced during her husband's reign because of her. She held great influence politically over her husband, serving as his advisor.\n\nIn 1670 she was widowed. She fought with her daughter in law for years, not wanting to give up her power. The new queen wasn't about to back down either from her. They fought over many things including the imprisonment of Leonora Christina Ulfeldt who was Frederick's half sister. She was imprisoned as her husband's power. She had been arrested when she went to England to reclaim money from Charles II (her cousin) her husband loaned him in exile. He repaid her by arresting her and sending her back to Frederick.She spent 22 years in prison, her husband never trying to free her. The new queen took pity, and made her husband swear that if she bore him a son, he would release her. When Frederick was born, Christian would have freed her, but his mother found out. She refused to attend her grandson's baptism if Leonora was freed, so she was not. Leonora was released from her prison cell after Sophie died.\n\nShe died in Copenhagen in 1685 and was buried at Roskilde cathedral\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roskilde_Cathedral\n\nHer and her husband had eight children.\n\n-Christian: became Christian V.

Her sister was raising her grandson Augustus III of Poland.\n\n-Frederick- died in infancy\n\n-George-husband of Queen Anne of Great Britain.
