        "text": "Five-year-old Prince George is the oldest child and firstborn son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and the great-grandson of Queen Elizabeth II. The tot is currently third in line for the throne following his grandfather, Prince Charles, and his father, Prince William.\n\nFour-year-old Princess Charlotte is fourth in line for the British throne, following her big brother, Prince George. The Succession Crown Act 2013 was a major game changer for Princess Charlotte's ranking in line for the British crown. While men previously outranked women in line to the throne, the new Act meant that birth order superseded gender. So even though Charlotte's younger brother Prince Louis is a boy, she still holds her ranking.\n\nPrincess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant, is the eldest child of King Philippe and Queen Mathilde. The 17-year-old is the immediate heir to the throne, and impressively opened the Princess Elisabeth Children's Hospital in 2011.\n\nAccording to the palace, she loves playing sports, has been playing piano for a few years and enjoys volunteer work. She currently goes to school in Brussels.\n\nPrince Gabriel is the second child of the King and Queen of Belgium, and the second in line for the throne, following his older sister. Like Princess Elisabeth, the 15-year-old also goes to school in Brussels and enjoys a variety of sports, from football to sailing.\n\nBhutan's crown prince is the first child of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema (the world's youngest living queen, at 27 years old).\n\nHere, the one-year-old Dragon Prince is photographed with his father and Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj. He also melts hearts monthly in adorable calendar photos.\n\nThirteen-year-old Christian Valdemar Henri John, Prince of Denmark, Count of Monpezat is the first son of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary and grandson of Queen Margrethe II, the reigning monarch, and Prince Henrik. He also holds the title of Count of Monpezat and is second in line for the throne, following his father.\n\nPrincess Isabella Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe, 12, is the second child of the crown prince and princess. Thanks to a recent amendment in the Danish law of royal succession—which changed inheritance from male-preferred primogeniture to absolute primogeniture—she's next in line for the throne, following her older brother, Prince Christian.\n\nPrince Nikolai William Alexander Frederik, 19, is the oldest son of Prince Joachim (Crown Prince Frederik's younger brother) and Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg. Like Prince Frederik's children, he and his siblings are also grandchildren to Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik. He also holds title of Count of Monpezat.\n\nAlthough his parents divorced in 2004, Prince Nikolai is still in line for the throne, in seventh place, after his dad.\n\nPrince Henrik Carl Joachim Alain, Count of Monpezat, is Prince Joachim and Princess Mary's first child together. (They wed in 2008, four years after he divorced Countess Alexandra.) The ten-year-old is ninth in line for the throne, after his half-brother Prince Felix.\n\nSeven-year-old Princess Athena Françoise Marie, Countess of Monpezat is the youngest of Queen Margrethe II and Prince Henrik's grandchildren. She's also the younger of Prince Joachim and Princess Marie's two children together. She follows her brother Prince Henrik as the 10th in line for the throne.\n\nThe grandson of Japan's Emperor Akihito is third in line for the Imperial Throne. His parents are Prince Akishino, the Emperor's younger son, and Princess Kiko. The royal tween will turn 13 this September.\n\nPrince Hisahito's older sister Princess Mako, 27, famously announced this year that she's giving up her royal status to marry her commoner fiancé, Kei Komuro.\n\nPrincess Salma, 17, is the third child and first daughter of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania Al Abdullah. She has three siblings: Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II, 25, Princess Princess Iman, 23, and Prince Hashem, 14.\n\nThe royal teen is not an heir to the throne because the Jordanian constitution states that the royal title is passed from the king to his eldest son.\n\nFourteen-year-old Prince Hashem is the fourth and youngest child of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania Al Abdullah.\n\nSince his older brother, Crown Prince Al Hussein, currently has no male heirs, according to the Jordanian constitution, Prince Hashem is technically next in line for the throne, but that will change if Al Hussein bears a son."
