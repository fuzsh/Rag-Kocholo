He, when Mayor, introduced the custom of going from London to Westminster by barge instead of on horseback to be presented to the King or his representative. The alteration was made in consideration of the Mayor's infirmity, but it was continued until 1657, when the horseback procession was revived. 1442 Jul 20\n\nWelles Nicholas Wyfold, Grocer Castle Baynard 1442-51. Tower 1451. Cornhill 1451-6. Sheriff 1443-4. Mayor 1450-1.\n\nAuditor 1442-4; Master Grocers 1443-4, 1451-2. Died 1456; Will (PCC 8 Stokton) dd 22 Jun 1456.

Died 18 Sep 1458; Will (PCC 13 Stokton) cod. 16 Apr; proved 11 Nov 1458. Originally an upholsterer, was admitted to the freedom of the Drapers' Company Apr 4, 1419 (Letter Book I, fo. 128b). He built Leadenhall as a granary for the City. His son Thomas married a daughter of Robert Large (Mayor 1439-40). Fuller in his Worthies says of him that he left 3,000 marks to charitable uses, so that \"his bounty, like Saul, stands higher than any other from the shoulder upwards.\" 1444 Nov 23\n\nYoo John Derby, Draper Candlewick 1444-54. Sheriff 1445-6.\n\nAuditor 1443-5, 1449-51; Master Tailors 1461-2. Will (HR 210 (12)) 17 Feb 1479; enrolled 9 Oct 1480. Fabyan relates a story of his being fined Â£50 for not removing a dead dog from his door and for using opprobrious language to the Mayor (John Yonge). 1445 Apr\n\nSevenok Thomas Pomeroy, Prior of Holy Trinity Portsoken 1445-81. Died Aug 1481. His election as Prior of Holy Trinity was disputed, and although it received the Royal assent on Apr 21, 1445, similar recognition was accorded William Westkarre on May 23 following. Pomeroy was finally confirmed and received the temporalities on 19 Feb 1446. 1445 Oct 19\n\nReynwell Thomas Canynges, Grocer Aldgate 1445-61. Sheriff 1449-50. Mayor 1456-7.\n\nM.P. London 1459; Auditor 1446-8; Master Grocers 1448, 1454-5, 1460-1. Elder brother of William Canynges, the founder of St. Mary Redcliffe Church, Bristol, of which city both were natives. He appears to have been the ancestor of George Canning, Earl Canning (Viceroy of India) and Lord Stratford de Redcliffe (\"the Great Eltchi\"), and this descent is ascribed to those statesmen in the Dictionary of National Biography (s.v. William Canynges), but this work contradicts itself Â a not uncommon occurrence Â by making William Canynges their ancestor, a few pages earlier in the same volume (s.v. George Canning). To add to the difficulty Burke's Peerage (s.v. Garvagh) gives Thomas as the ancestor, while Burke's Extinct Peerage (s.v. Canning) substitutes John, the eldest brother of Thomas and William. 1446 Apr 26\n\nMelreth Geoffrey Feldynge, Mercer Farringdon Within 1446-60. Sheriff 1445-6. Mayor 1452-3.\n\nM.P. London 1439, 1455; Auditor 1439-43, 1445-6, 1448-50; Master Mercers 1448, 1453. The assumption of Orridge (The Citizens of London and their Rulers) that he was the ancestor of the Earls of Denbigh appears to be erroneous, and I have not found satisfactory confirmation of Stow's statement that he was a member of the Privy Council under Henry VI and Edward IV. 1446 Apr 29\n\nWotton Thomas Scott, Draper Dowgate 1446-51. Walbrook 1451-63. Sheriff 1447-8. Mayor 1458-9.\n\nAuditor 1452-4. Died ca Nov 1470; Will (PCC 32 Godyn) 30 Oct; proved 14 Dec 1470. 1446 May 27\n\nEstfeld Sir William Cantelowe, Mercer Cripplegate 1446-61. Sheriff 1448-9.\n\nK.B. 1461; M.P. London 1453, 1455; Auditor 1450-2; Master Mercers 1450, 1456, 1462. Will (PCC 4 Godyn) 21 Feb 1463; proved 11 May 1464. He was imprisoned in Dudley Castle in the year 1456 as being supposed to be concerned in an attack made by the young mercers of London on the houses of the Lombard merchants (Dr. Sharpe's London and the Kingdom, i., 292). 1446 Aug 17\n\nWandesford William Abraham, Vintner Vintry 1446-56. Sheriff 1447-8.\n\n1448\n\nClopton Phillip Malpas, Draper Lime St 1448-50. Sheriff 1439-40.\n\nM.P. London 1432, 1442; Auditor 1431-3; Will (PCC 27 Godyn) 26 Apr; proved 8 May 1469.\n\nA strong adherent of the Lancastrian Party and elected an Alderman at the personal recommendation of the King (Henry VI). He was specially obnoxious to Jack Cade's followers, who sacked his house, having previously induced the Common Council to petition for his dismissal from the Aldermanry. It may be inferred from a passage in the Chronicle III, Vitellius A xvi, fo. 120, that he had gone over to the Yorkists by 1461. His two daughters married respectively Sir Thomas Cook (Mayor 1462-3), and Sir Ralph Josselyn (Mayor 1464-5, 1476-7). 1449\n\nGedney William Marowe, Grocer Broad St 1449-51. Tower 1451-64. Sheriff 1448-9. Mayor 1455-6.\n\nM.P. London 1447, 1453, 1460, 1463; Auditor 1444-6, 1451-3; Master Grocers 1450-1, 1457-8, 1463-4. Will (PCC 9, 11 Godyn) 8 Oct 1464; proved 15 May 1465. His daughter married Robert Throckmorton, said to have been a Privy Councillor to Henry VII and ancestor to the Throckmorton Baronets. 1450 Jul 10\n\n(on or bef 15)\n\nMalpas William Hulyn, Fishmonger Lime St 1450-70. Sheriff 1449-50. Mayor 1459-60.\n\nAuditor 1454-6. 1450 Jul 10\n\n(on or bef 15)\n\nSutton Matthew Philip, Goldsmith Aldersgate 1450-76. Sheriff 1451-2. Mayor 1463-4.\n\nKnighted 21 May 1471; Auditor 1455-7; Prime Warden Goldsmiths 1442. Died ca Oct 1476; Will (PCC 27 Wateys) 24 Oct 1475; proved 30 Oct 1476. See Notes and Queries, 11th Series ii. 24 (9 Jul 1910). 1451 Feb 16\n\n(18)\n\nCatteworth Christopher Warter, Skinner Farringdon Without 1451. Broad St 1451-8. Sheriff 1451-2. 1451 Jul 16\n\nWhetenhall William Dere Dowgate 1451-1. Sheriff 1450-1.\n\nWill (PCC 3 Godyn) 6 Jun 1459; proved 4 Feb 1464. I can find no mention of his Company during his Aldermanic period, but he is not improbably identical with the William Dere, \"peautrer,\" named in Letter Book K, fo. 165b, about Dec, 1436. 1451 Aug 2\n\nPaddesle Richard Alley, Skinner Farringdon Without 1451-6. Dowgate 1456-60. Sheriff 1452-3.\n\nAuditor 1444-6, 1456-8; Master Skinners 1451. 1452\n\nCombes Geoffrey Boleyn, Mercer Castle Baynard 1452-7. Bassishaw 1457-63. Sheriff 1446-7. Mayor 1457-8.\n\nM.P. London 1449; Master Mercers 1454. Died Jun 1463; Will (PCC 1 Godyn) 14 Jun; proved 2 Jul 1463. He married the daughter and heiress of Lord Hoo and Hastings, and was grandfather of Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire, whose daughter married Henry VIII and was mother of Queen Elizabeth. He was also (through Mary, Anne Boleyn's elder sister) ancestor of Nelson and of the late Earl of Kimberley (see pedigree in Orridge The Citizens of London and their Rulers, p. 186). He had originally been a hatter and was translated to the Mercers Feb 1, 1486 (Letter Book K, fo. 158b). 1452 Aug 7\n\nChalton Richard Lee, Grocer Bishopsgate 1452-69. Walbrook 1469-72. Sheriff 1452-3. Mayor 1460-1, 1469-70.\n\nKnighted 21 May 1471; M.P. London 1450; Auditor 1446-8, 1453-5; Master Grocers 1452-4, 1459-60, 1468-9. Died 1472; Will (PCC 5 Wateys) 4 Sep 1470; proved 4 Mar 1472. 1454 Oct 24\n\nDerby John Walderne, Grocer Candlewick 1454-64. Sheriff 1453-4.\n\nM.P. London 1453; Auditor 1448-50, 1457-9; Master Grocers 1455-6, 1462-3. Died 1464. 1456 Mar\n\nDere John Middleton, Mercer Farringdon Without 1456-8. Bread St 1458-62. Sheriff 1450-1.\n\nCity Chamberlain 1449-50; M.P. London 1453; Auditor 1449-50, 1458-60; Master Mercers 1452, 1458, 1469, 1475. Died 1477; Will (PCC 30 Wateys) 20 May; proved 8 Aug 1477. 1456\n\nAbraham Sir Thomas Cook, Draper Vintry 1456-8. Broad St 1458-68. Bread St 1470-1. Sheriff 1453-4. Mayor 1462-3.\n\nK.B. 26 May 1465; M.P. London 1460, 1470; Auditor 1445-7. Died ca May 1478; Will (PCC 36 Wateys) 15 Apr; proved 1 Jun 1478.\n\nSee Notes and Queries, 11th Series ii. 6 (2 Jul 1910). The mistake in the original D.N.B. article of ante-dating by a year Cook's return to the Court of Aldermen is a serious one, as it tends to obscure the fact that his actual reinstatement synchronized with the temporary re-establishment of Lancastrian ascendency. Son-in-law of Phillip Malpas (Alderman, Sheriff 1439-40). His great grandson, Sir Anthony Cooke, had two daughters, who married respectively William Cecil, Lord Burghley (Queen Elizabeth's chief adviser) and Lord Keeper Sir Nicholas Bacon, whose son was Francis Bacon (Lord Chancellor) the great philosopher. Mr. Welch (in The Dictionary of National Biography) and Mr. C.L. Kingsford in his notes to Chronicles of London, speak of him as a Yorkist leader in the city, the former explicitly and the latter apparently regarding his knighthood at the coronation of Edward IV's Queen as evidence of his political sympathies. But that batch of knights included John de Vere, Earl of Oxford, a keen Lancastrian partisan, and also Sir John Plomer who appears to have belonged to that party. If Cook ever had any Yorkist sympathies they were not very deep or lasting, and he was certainly a partisan of Henry VI at the time of his restoration in 1470, and suffered heavily afterwards for his support of the Lancastrians. 1456\n\nWyfold Sir Ralph Josselyn, Draper Cornhill 1456-78. Sheriff 1458-9. Mayor 1464-5, 1476-7.\n\nK.B. 26 May 1465; M.P. London 1467; Auditor 1464; Master Drapers 1457-8. A younger brother of Thomas Josselyn from whom the Earls of Roden are descended. Fuller (Worthies, ii., 57) in reference to his knighthood of the Bath, remarks that \"there is more of the carpet than of the camp in that Order.\" He repaired the City wall between Aldgate and Aldersgate. ca 1456\n\nHorn John Feelde, Stockfishmonger Bridge ca 1456-63.

They were victims of an epidemic called the \"Sweating Sickness\".\n\nI have not found the exact dates of death of these six Aldermen, and I have therefore ex abundanti cautela state the period as within the space of a month. Dr. Sharpe (London and the Kingdom, i. 317) says that \"the pestilence carried off two Mayors and six Aldermen within the space of a week, referring as authority to Hecker's Epidemics of the Middle Ages, p. 168. The \"six Aldermen\" were certainly inclusive of, not additional to, the \"two Mayors.\" See also Kingsford Chronicles of London, p. 193. 1474 Aug 26\n\nBromer Robert Colwyche, Tailor Farringdon Without 1474-6.

There is an interesting account of the forcible ejectment of Percy from the Priorate in 1494 by the Bishop of London (Richard Hill) and of his restoration and resignation later in the year, in Cotton MS. Vitellius A xvi. See Kingsford's Chronicles of London, pp. 199, 201, 203, also Victorian History of the Counties of England - London, p. 474. Twelve years later, after two successors had intervened, Percy was restored to the Priorate which he retained till his death in 1512. There is a curious error in the Victorian County History, the writer asserting that Percy was not Prior in 1506 or 1509, referring to Letters and Papers Henry VIII, xvi, 503 (15) and Calendar of Ancient Deeds A 1773. It happens that the document at the first of these references is a lease by Prior Newton in Feb, 1506, some months before his death and Percy's restoration, and the second, in which Bradwell is mentioned as Prior, is wrongly calendared under date 4 May, 1 Henry VIII (1509), whereas the MS. itself, which I have inspected in the presence of an official at the Record Office, is quite clearly dated 8 Henry VIII (1516) - an instance of the way in which errors are perpetuated.\n\nPat's note: the titles here should be Victoria County History, with no final 'n'. 1481 Oct 11\n\nIlome John Fisher, Mercer Farringdon Without 1481-3.

He was goldsmith to Cardinal Wolsey, and married Elizabeth Bryce, a grand-daughter of Sir Hugh Bryce (Mayor 1485/6 - d. 22 Sep 1496). They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Thomasine. In 1526, Robert Amadas was appointed Master of the Jewel House to Henry VIII. Amadas owned a house in Aldersgate and land in Essex. Upon his death, Elizabeth inherited Jenkins, a Âmansion houseÂ in Barking, and on 28 Aug 1532, married Sir Thomas Neville in the chapel there. Mrs. Amadas \"began, in 1533, to spread ÂungraciousÂ statements about the kingÂs occult destinyÂ. The story that Mrs. Amadas claimed, in 1532, that she had once been the KingÂs mistress, has fairly wide circulation. Since she specified that she met him in Sir William ComptonÂs house in Thames Street, this must have been before ComptonÂs death in 1528 . Elizabeth Amadas was arrested for her treasonous statements and Amadas was ordered to pay several hundred pounds to the crown, although whether to free his wife or because there was plate missing from the Jewel House is not clear. Sharon Jansen, in Dangerous Talk and Strange Behavior, doesn't think the self-proclaimed prophet was Elizabeth Bryce at all. Jansen identifies the Mrs. Amadas who compared herself with Catalina of Aragon and Elizabeth Stafford, Duchess of Norfolk as an abused wife as the wife of John Amadas (b. 1489 - d. 1554/5), a member of the King's household with properties in Devon, Cornwall, and Kent. He was married by 1519, but his wife's name is unknown.
