        "text": "Sir Ralph Verney, who has died aged 86, was a Buckinghamshire landowner who used his birthright to work passionately in the cause of the countryside and conservation. In this capacity, he was president of the Country Landowners' Association, a member of the Forestry Commission Committee for England (1968-80), producing a plan for the creation of an area of outstanding natural beauty in the Chiltern Hills in 1971.\n\nHe was also chairman of the Nature Conservancy Council from 1980-83. At that time, the NCC was active in promoting \"sites of special scientific interest\" under the Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981. Opposition was sometimes fierce and Verney had the distinction of being hanged in effigy in Somerset for his efforts to safeguard the Somerset Levels at West Sedgemoor, Somerset.\n\nFrom 1973- 79 he was a member of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. Its report, Sinews For Survival, which Verney wrote, gave many notable warnings about the future. He spoke sense and people listened to him, respecting his integrity.\n\nThroughout his life, he was active in his home county of Buckinghamshire. Elected to the county council in 1951, he was vice-lord-lieutenant from 1965-84. He was a member of Milton Keynes New Town Corporation (1967-74) and of the Council of Buckingham University (1983-87) which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1991. A keen freemason, he was grand superintendent for Buckinghamshire (1966-91) and provincial grand master (1970-76).\n\nRalph Verney was the eldest son of Sir Harry Verney, the fourth baronet, Liberal MP for Buckingham and a junior minister in Herbert Asquith's 1909-16 government. Educated at Canford and Balliol College, Oxford, during the second world war, he served in the Far East, leaving with the rank of major in 1945.\n\nAfter the war, he turned his energies into the restoration of his home, Claydon House. One of the most beautiful houses in England, it has been in the Verney family since the 15th century. In 1957, the Verneys gave it to the National Trust, but continued to live in it until 1994. He was made a KBE for his public services in 1974, and inherited the family baronetcy on the death of his father in the same year.\n\nFor 35 years, Verney and his wife, Mary, a notable performer on the pianofort√©, organised the Claydon Concerts in the wonderful atmosphere of the salon at Claydon House. Sir Ralph did readings as part of the concerts, notably with Peggy Ashcroft and Julian Bream, and the whole family took part in a presentation of the Verney letters.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Mary, whom he married in 1948, and by his son and three daughters."
