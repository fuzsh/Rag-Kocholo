Margaret died in 1641, and was buried at Claydon.[3]\n\nchildren\n\nHis children include:\n\nSir Ralph Verney, 1st Baronet (1613–1696)\n\nHenry Verney\n\nSir Edmund Verney (1616–1649) who commanded the troops Royalist infantry in Drogheda at the Siege of Drogheda and was slain during the final assault (mentioned in Cromwell's letter to John Bradshaw, Esquire, President of the Council of State, dated 16 September 1649).[4]\n\nSusanna (Mrs Alport)\n\nPenelope (Lady Osborn, Mrs Denton)\n\nMargaret (Lady Margaret Elmes\n\nCary\n\nm.

Charles Adams\n\nThis and extensive further information about the children of Sir Edmund Verney can be found here.[7]\n\nEvents\n\nKnighted by King James in 1611, Edmund was sent to Madrid, and returned to join the household of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, to which his uncle Francis Verney was one of the falconers.[8]When Henry died in 1612, Edmund became a gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles, Duke of York, later Charles I.[9]\n\nFrom 1620 he made his family home at Middle Claydon, Buckinghamshire (which the Giffard family had held by lease from the Verneys[10]), where he was the near neighbour of Sir Thomas Chaloner of Steeple Claydon.[11] He was severely in debt by the early 1620s.\n\nIn 1623, he accompanied Charles and the Duke of Buckingham to Spain to court the Infanta Maria. While there, he protected a dying Englishman from a Catholic priest by punching the priest in the face, which did not endear him to the Spaniards.\n\nUpon his return, he was elected Member of Parliament for Buckingham in 1624, and for New Romney in 1625. After the coronation of Charles that year, he was appointed Knight Marshal of England for life, the duties of which office required him to be extensively at court. He was returned for Aylesbury in 1629. Despite his income from the Knight Marshalsy, several business ventures ended in failure, and his debts were largely unrelieved.[12]\n\nWith the approach of the English Civil War, he found himself in a painful conflict. While personally loyal to the King, he resisted the Laudian religious policies. Verney was returned to the Short Parliament and then the Long Parliament as member for Wycombe, and often found himself in opposition to the King.\n\nAt the outbreak of war, Verney remained loyal to King Charles, but his eldest son Ralph joined the Parliamentary forces.\n\nDeath\n\nMade standard-bearer of the Royal army, Verney was killed at the Battle of Edgehill. According to the tradition of his family, his body was never identified, except for his severed hand, found still grasping the banner.[13]\n\nClaydon House was the family seat in Middle Claydon\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 W.H.
