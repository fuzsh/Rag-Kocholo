        "text": "Ancestors Descendants\n\nProfile last modified 14 Feb 2023 | Created 12 Sep 2010\n\nThis page has been accessed 3,559 times.\n\nBiography\n\nIn 1572, Edmond Verney of Penley, Hertfordshire, told the visiting Herald that he was the son of Sir Ralph Verney, knt., of Penley, who was the son of another Sir Ralph Verney, by his first wife Margaret, daughter and co-heir of Inwardby of Quinton Mallet, co. Bucks.[1]\n\n\"A few words comprise all that has been found of the history of Ralph, or as he was termed after his knighthood, 'Sir Ralph the younger,' to distinguish him from his uncle Sir Ralph the courtier, who was his godfather and friend through life, and also his survivor. The third Sir Ralph continued to occupy Pendley, but was drawn, probably by the influence of his uncle, a little closer to the court than his family had ever been. In 1511 he served as sheriff for the joint counties of Bucks and Bedford, and again in 1524. In 1525 [should read 1520] he was of that goodly band of knights--the representatives of English chivalry--who attended Queen Katherine to the Field of the Cloth of Gold. He was three times married. His first wife was Margery, second daughter and one of three co-heiresses of John Iwardby of Quainton, in the county of Bucks. This marriage brought into the family of the Verneys the manor of Quainton with lands at Swanborne and Great Missenden, both in the same county. In the selection of his second wife we probably trace the influence of his courtier uncle. She was Anne, daughter of Edmund Weston of Boston, in the county of Lincoln, sister of Richard... Anne Weston and her brother Richard were both in the household of Elizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII, at the same time as Lady Eleanor Verney. After the death of queen Elizabeth of York, Anne entered the service of Katherine of Aragon, and remained there until 1511, when she was married to sir Ralph Verney. Queen Katherine gave her a marriage portion of 200 marks... This marriage constituted another link between the Verneys and the court. All Sir Ralph's friends are henceforth persons holding offices in the royal household, and for several subsequent generations one or more of his direct descendants held similar appointments.\"[2]\n\n\"...After the death of Sir Ralph Verney, it was found by an inquisition (17 Henry VIII)... that Ralph Verney made his will, 8 May 1525, and died, the same day, leaving by Margaret Iwardby, his first wife, 'Ralph Verney, son and heir both of his father and his mother, aged 15 years and a half and upwards.'\"[3]\n\nMarried 1: Margaret IWARDBY ABT 1507, Quainton, Buckinghamshire, England Children: 1.
