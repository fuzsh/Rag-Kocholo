This was erected on the order of Queen Victoria; note that the inscription, in typical aristocratic manner, refers to the Earl of Beaconfield with no mention of Disraeli, by which he is known by just about everyone else. Marble with bust by R C Belt.\n\nBelow can just be see a cadaver efigy of the earl 16th C There is also a knight with cross legs in 13th century style which is a fake, time Henry VIII, so that the then lords of the manor, the Wellesbourne family, could 'prove' their descent from Simon de Montford. The genuine 14th century knight also received a bogus coat of arms at this time. Three fake 15 th century knights were also made as well as fake seals and deeds. (Pevsner) Sir John (1608) & Elizabeth Croke (1611) Alabaster, in the Croke chapel.

Maria Small (1829) aged 21; her husband Rev Harry Alexander Small (1876) aged 64. 4. Alicia Payn (1427) Brass restored in 1884 according to the added inscription. This brass is placed high on the south chancel wall and is very difficult to make out. 5. John Maunsell (1605) Skeleton type; chancel floor, under carpet. Above: 'Sacred to the memory of Thomas Isham (1676) late of Middle Temple London gent only sonne of Thomas Isham of Pinchley in the county of Bucks knight. He deceased July 7th in ye 30th year of his age.\n\nLeaving behind him a great example of kindness to his relations, fidelity to his friends and charity to all ye knew him. in coelo quies.'\n\nRight:Alexander Denton (1576) son of Thomas Denton (q.v.). Signed by Thomas Kirkby. His first wife was Anne Williston who died in childbirth; she has a monument in Hereford Cathedral where she lies with effigies of her baby and husband. His second wife Mary Martin is recorded on this monument; she died in 1574\n\nFar Right: Sir Alexander (1739) and Lady Agnes Denton (1753) Originally erected for Alexander's first wife Catherine (1733), who is represented by the lion footed black marble sarcophagus in the centre of the monument, on it large obelisk. Signed by Henry Cheere. On the left is the bust of Alexander & on the right that of his second wife Agnes.\n\nSir Edmund (1642) & Dame Margaret (1641) Verney; their son Sir Ralph (___) and his wife Mary (1640)\n\nThis monument of dark and white marbles was set up by Sir Ralph in memory of his father, mother and wife. These three busts were modeled from paintings that hung in Claydon House. When he returned to England in 1653 he signed a contract with the sculptor Edward Marshall to make the monument for Â£130; it took three and a half years to construct and was finished and unveiled in 1653.\n\nEdmund Verney (1590-1642) fought for the Royalists in the Civil War, becoming standard bearer, and was killed at the Battle of Edgehill. His body was never recovered, only his gauntlet covered hand, which had been hacked off, being found; this hangs with his helmet in the chancel.\n\nRalph Verney (1613-1696) He declared for Parliament in the Civil War, but refused to sign the Solemn League and Covenant and was forced into exile. He was imprisoned on his return to England but three years later was fined and released. When Amanda visited Stoke Manderville she found it locked but saw an effigy though the window which she found attractive and interesting; she photographed it thought the window. As she expected the photograph was not a good one but we both thought it worthy of publication. The church is the new church built in the 1860's to replace the nearby Norman church that had fallen into dereliction; it is kept locked except during services. The monument was moved from the old to the new in the 1880's. The old church is at the time of writing subject to an archaeological dig as HS2 will unfortunately (and unnecessarily) run over the remains.\n\nO/S Ref: SP 834 104\n\n'Crvell death by mortall blades/ Hath slain fovre of my tender babesWherof Mary Thomas and Dorathye/ Within this place ther bodies lye.But God which never man deceaved/ Hath ther soules to Him receavedThis death to them is greatest gayne/ Increasing their joy freeing them from payneO Dorathye my blessed Childe/ Whichlovingly lyved and dyed myld\n\nThou wert my tenth even God's own choys/ In thee exceedingly I did reioyse\n\nUpon Good Friday at night my doll depted/ Adew my sweet and most trveheartedMy bodye with thine I desire should lye/ When God hath appointed me to dyeHoping through Christ he will provide/ For my soul with thyne in heaven to abideAnd I your father Edmund Brundenell/ Until the resurection with thee will dwellAnd so adew my sweet lambs three/ Until in heaven I shall you seeSuch is my hope of Richard my son/ Whose body lieth buried in Kings Sutton\n\nMartha, Lady Prenystone (1620 age 25) & Hester (1612 <1) White marble effigy in shroud. The infant daughter is shown at her feet. She died of smallpox. She lived with her husband, Thomas, at Bruce Castle, Tottenham, which was leased from the 3rd Earl of Dorset, whose mistress she became in 1619. The monument was erected by her father. Attributed to Nicholas Stone. The baby appears to be resting on a separate (or at least lower) slab below the mother's feet; I can just see the baby's hand in the photograph above. Above: 'Here lyeth Thomas Pygott in the countey of Buk late sergeant at lawe & Agnesand Elizabeth one of the daughters & Hyeres of John Iwardeby esquyer hys Wyffes which Thomas dyed the 24 day of February the yere of oure Lorde 1520 and the seyd Elizabeth dyed the ...day of...the yere of oure Lord...on whose souls Jesu have mercy'. The brass is on the back plate of the tomb structure which consists of tomb chest and canopy, a design common in early 16th century. Purbeck marble.\n\nRight: : Margart Myssenden (Hodges) (1612) with her son shown as a skeleton Sir Robert Dormer (1552). This monument may have been made at least 15 years later for his son Sir William (1575) . The brass on the back panel refers to his granddaughter, Jane, who was the wife of the Duke of Feria, a titled not conferred on him until1567.His wife, Jane, chose to live abroad because of the Catholic intolerance during Elizabeth I's reign and is buried in the Charterhouse in Louvain."
