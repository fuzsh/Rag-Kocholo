Bucks.[2]\n\n\"The Verney family can be traced in Buckinghamshire from the 13th century, but its earliest property at Middle Claydon was acquired by the first Sir Ralph Verney about 1467 and the house at Pendley across the Hertfordshire border by his son Sir John. Thereafter the family continued to prosper although its successive heads were short-lived; the fourth Sir Ralph was 37 when he died in April 1546 leaving the 18 year-old Edmund as the eldest of his ten children.\" This eldest son Edmund died in December 1558 and was succeeded by Ralph Verney's fourth son, also named Edmund (as the younger Edmund's elder brothers John and Francis had already died childless).[3]\n\nChildren:\n\nEdmund (the elder) Verney 1529–1558. (no children)\n\nFrancis Verney 1531-1559. (no children)\n\nJohn Verney 1533–1557.
