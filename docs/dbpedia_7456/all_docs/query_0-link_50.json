        "text": "The Ancestry of Dorothea Poyntz\n\nfor Five Generations\n\nIt is most unusual that a complete four generation ancestry can be compiled for someone born in 1631. But such is the case for Dorothea Poyntz, whose known ancestry includes both parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents and all sixteen great-great-grandparents. A total of 30 ancestors. This ancestry was first presented in the December 1990 issue of the Owsley Family Historical Society Newsletter. Further details have been added in the ensuing years. A bibliography to cited sources may be found at the end. (Updated from four to five generations on January 3, 2011.)\n\n1. DOROTHEA POYNTZ. Baptized 3 Jan 1631 at Benefield, Northamptonshire; died 2 Aug 1705 and was buried near her husband in GloostonChurch, Leicestershire. She was married c1650 to Rev. JOHN OWSLEY.
