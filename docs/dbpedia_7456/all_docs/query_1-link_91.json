Other works such as Dod's Peerage and Who's Who continued to show the Viscountcy in a normal fashion. In any event, the status of the peerage was resolved in June 1959 as reported in 'The Times' of 11 June:- 'Brigadier Francis Dighton Annesley, of Barton Grange, Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, has established his claim to the title of Viscount Valencia in the Irish peerage, which has been considered dormant since 1844. 'Yesterday's House of Lords papers stated: \"Viscountcy of Valentia - report made from the Lord Chancellor that Francis Dighton Viscount Valentia in the peerage of Ireland has established his succession to the Viscountcy of Valentia and his right to vote at any elections of representative peers for Ireland which may be held in future under statutes in force relating thereto, to the satisfaction of the Lord Chancellor: read, and ordered to lie on the table.\" 'Lord Valentia, who is 70, retired in 1948 as a brigadier of the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was awarded the Military Cross and the Belgian Croix de Guerre in the First World War and between the wars served in India and China. He is still professionally engaged as a doctor. 'Our Special Correspondent writes:- 'Francis Annesley was created in 1621 Lord Mountnorris and Viscount Valentia in reversion, to take effect on the death of the then Viscount, Sir Henry Power, which occurred in 1642. Both dignities were in the peerage of Ireland. His eldest son Arthur was created Earl of Anglesey in the peerage of England, and all the dignities descended together as far as Richard Annesley, who succeeded as sixth Earl and seventh Viscount in 1737. 'After him there was dispute. His eldest son was the child of his second (acknowledged) wife Juliana Donovan, whom he married as a widower in 1741. But there was still living one Anne Simpson, styled Countess of Anglesey, whom he is alleged to have married when she was 15, a few days before his wedding to his first (acknowledged) wife, Ann Prust, in 1715. \"Countess\" Anne left only daughters. The validity of this first marriage and the consequent bigamous character of the other two were accepted by the English and rejected by the Irish House of Lords; so that his son Arthur succeeded as Viscount Valentia but not as Earl of Anglesey. 'The male line of the eldest son of the first Viscount was believed, but not conclusively proved, to have become extinct with the death of the first [ninth] Viscount in 1844, and from then until the present case no one has proved his right to the dignity. 'It was generally supposed that the senior surviving branch was that originating in Francis, the fourth son of the grantee; and the heirs of this line have successively assumed the title of Viscount Valentia and been accepted as such by the courtesy of society and even at Court. To elevate this courtesy into a legal right it was necessary to prove the extinction of the issue in the male line of all the three eldest sons of the first Viscount; and this, it is presumed, has now been done to the satisfaction of the Lord Chancellor. 'The usual method of testing a claim to peerage is for the claimant to petition the Crown for a writ of summons to Parliament. The petition is then generally referred through the Attorney- General to the House of Lords, which hears genealogical and other evidence in the Committee for Privileges, a committee of the whole House, and advises whether the right has been made out. 'This procedure is not available to the claimant of an Irish dignity, for there is no longer an Irish Parliament to which he can be summoned; nor can he, like a Scot, claim to be admitted to vote for representative peers, for the Republican Government of Ireland has not kept up the machinery for election (in fact, the breed is all but extinct). But it would presumably be open to the Parliament of the United Kingdom to provide alternate machinery to take its place; and, if ever that is done, the Lord Chancellor's certificate will no doubt give Lord Valentia an unchallengeable right to record his vote or to stand for election by his peers.' The special remainders to the Viscountcy of Seaham and the Earldom of Vane From the \"London Gazette\" of 29 March 1823 (issue 17909, page 498):- \"The King has been pleased to direct letters patent to be passed under the Great Seal granting the dignities of Viscount and Earl of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to Charles William Marquess of Londonderry, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath, Lieutenant-General of His Majesty's Forces, and late His Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Emperor of Austria, and to the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten, or to be begotten on the body of his present wife Frances Ann, by the names, styles, and titles of Viscount Seaham, of Seaham, in the county palatine of Durham, and Earl Vane.\" The abeyances of the barony of Vaux of Harrowden The following article appeared in \"The Times\" on 13 July 1938:- Last night's London Gazette announces that the King has been pleased, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm, bearing date the 8th instant, to declare that Grace Mary Eleanor Gilbey, commonly called the Hon. Grace Mary Eleanor Gilbey, wife of William Gordon Gilbey, the eldest of the three daughters and co-heirs of Hubert George Charles, seventh Baron Vaux of Harrowden, deceased, is and shall be Baroness Vaux of Harrowden, and giving, granting and confirming to the said Grace Mary Eleanor Gilbey the ancient barony of Vaux of Harrowden, to have and to hold the said Barony together with all the rights, privileges, pre-eminences, immunities and advantages and the place and precedence belonging thereto to her and the heirs of her body lawfully begotten and to be begotten in as full and ample a manner as the said Hubert George Charles, Baron Vaux of Harrowden or any of his ancestors held and enjoyed the same.' In a footnote, the following history of the barony is outlined:- 'The Barony with which Sir Nicholas Vaux of Harrowden, Lieutenant of Guisnes Castle, near Calais, and poet, was invested by King Henry VIII at Bridewell Palace on April 27, 1523, passed from father to son until Edward, the fourth lord, died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Henry, who died in 1663 without having taken his seat in the House of Lords. In 1838 the House of Lords decided that this Barony had been created by writ and that it had in 1663 fallen into abeyance between the fifth lord's second sister Joyce, at that time a nun at Eye; Elizabeth Viscountess Mountgarret, only child of Mary, his deceased elder sister; and George Lord Abergavenny, first surviving son and heir of Catherine, his deceased youngest sister. It was also found that in 1838 the Barony was in abeyance between three co-heirs - George Charles Mostyn, who represented a moiety as being through his mother, the daughter of George Butler of Ballyragget, the heir of Elizabeth Viscountess Mountgarret, his mother's great-great-great grandmother; and Robert Henry, twelfth Earl of Pembroke, and Edward Bourchier Hartopp, who were each representatives of one-fourth of the Barony as heirs respectively of the two daughters of Frances Viscount FitzWilliam, granddaughter of George Lord Abergavenny. Accordingly, on March 12, 1838, Queen Victoria called the Barony out of abeyance in favour of Mr. Mostyn, who succeeded as sixth Lord Vaux of Harrowden. He died in 1883 and was succeeded as seventh lord by his grandson, Mr. Hubert George Charles Mostyn, who died on October 25, 1935, when, for the second time, the Barony fell into abeyance between his three daughters. By the recent decision of the House of Lords, they were found to be co-heirs of the Barony.' Arthur Frederick Daubeney Olav Eveleigh-de-Moleyns, 7th Baron Ventry Ventry was educated at Wellington College, where he became interested in balloons. During World War I, he transferred from the Irish Guards to the County of London Balloon Squadron in the Auxiliary Air Force. In World War II he served as a Flight Lieutenant in Balloon Command. After the war he became an advocate for the advantages of balloons over aircraft. A balloon, for instance, would make an ideal observation post from which to spot the Loch Ness Monster. In 1949, he began to build the Bournemouth, the first airship to be built in Britain since the crash of the R 101 in 1930. On 19 July 1951 the Bournemouth was ready to take its first flight at the RAF Balloon Centre at Cardington, Bedfordshire. The flight was reasonably successful, being airborne for 18 minutes, although on landing the crew reported that it was stern-heavy and difficult to get down. After making some modifications, a second flight occurred on 16 August 1951. As the airship was coming in to land, it approached a too low a height and one of the guy ropes caught the railings on a workshop roof, bringing the airship to a sudden halt. The balloon's gondola struck the roof, but no-one was injured. Ventry commented 'Perfectly ordinary flight. Then one of the handling guy ropes caught on the catwalk and there we sat like a broody hen. Chance in a million.' James Walter Grimston, 4th Earl of Verulam The 4th Earl died as the result of a car crash. The proceedings of the inquest into his death were reported in the \"Daily Telegraph\" on 2 December 1949:- 'A verdict of \"death by misadventure\" was recorded at the Newmarket inquest yesterday on the Earl of Verulam, 69, of Gorhambury, St. Albans, who died in hospital after his car had been in collision with a lorry on Tuesday evening. Police evidence was given that Lord Verulam's car was found jammed under the rear of the lorry and that a 64ft long brake-mark led to the rear of the car. 'The lorry driver, John Ambrose Freeman, of Hartley-street, Bethnal Green, said he was stationary behind another lorry for what seemed to be about a minute when something hit the back of his lorry. 'Leonard Vincent Tapscott, of Garage Cottages, Gorhambury, chauffeur to Lord Verulam, said he was travelling at about 45 m.p.h. when he saw in front the rear light of a lorry which he thought was moving. He pulled out to pass and then saw another car coming in the opposite direction. He also saw two tank transporters in front of the lorry. 'He braked, but the car skidded into the rear of the lorry. Mr. T. Wilson, the coroner, said there appeared to be no evidence that Lord Verulam's chauffeur was driving in any dangerous or very fast manner.' Charles Crespigny Vivian, 2nd Baron Vivian The 2nd Baron Vivian was well-known in his day as a result of a remarkable dream which predicted the result of a horse race. In April 1879 there occurred the death of General Richard Taylor, son of the former President of the United States, Zachary Taylor, and a General in the Confederate cause in the American Civil War. As part of its death notice, the 'Daily Telegraph' included the following story:- 'On the morning of the day when the City and Suburban Handicap was won by Aldrich [on 28 April 1874], a little fancied outsider, it so chanced that General Taylor travelled down to Epsom in company with Lord Vivian, and heard from him that it was his intention to back Lord Rosebery's horse, because he had dreamt that he saw the primrose and rose hoops borne to victory in the race which they were on their road to witness. Acting upon this hint, General Taylor took a thousand to thirty about Aldrich, and was not a little elated at the success of what he justly called \"a leap in the dark.\" But for the accident which caused Lemnos, another much-backed candidate for the race, to fall at Tattenham Corner, there is a little probability that the dream of Lord Vivian would have found the interpretation upon which General Taylor counted.' As a result of General Taylor's death notice, Lord Vivian wrote to the 'Daily Telegraph' the following letter:- 'Sir - In your 'leader' on General Taylor, in this day's paper, you introduce an anecdote relative to a dream of mine. The facts are these:- I did dream, on the morning of the race for the City and Suburban Handicap, that I had fallen asleep in the weighing-room of the Stand at Epsom, prior to that race, and that after it had been run, I was awakened by a gentleman - the owner of another horse in the race - who informed me that the Teacher had won. Of this horse, so far as my recollection serves me, I had never before heard. On reaching Victoria Station, the first person I saw was the gentleman who had appeared to me in my dream, and to him I mentioned it, observing that I could not find any horse so named in the race. He replied, 'There is a horse now called Aldrich, who was previously called the Teacher.' The dream had so vividly impressed me, that I declared my intention of backing Aldrich for £100, and was in course of doing this when I was questioned by his owner as to 'why I was backing his horse.' I replied, because I had dreamt he had won the race.' To this I was answered, 'As against your dream, I will tell you this fact - I tried the horse last week with a hurdle-jumper, and he was beaten a distance,' I thanked my informant, and discontinued backing Aldrich. General Taylor, who had overheard what passed, asked me, if I did not intend backing the horse again for myself, to win him £1,000 by him. This I did by taking for him 1,000 to 30 about Aldrich. Such is the true account of my dream, and of General Taylor's profit from it. - Yours faithfully, VIVIAN' Anthony Crespigny Claude Vivian, 5th Baron Vivian The 5th Lord Vivian was at the centre of a scandal in the latter half of 1954 after he had been shot by his lover. The case featured prominently in the newspapers, but I have contented myself with the following summary, which appeared in 'The Washington Post and Times Herald' of 1 May 1955, at the time of Lord Vivian's lover's release from prison:- 'The car stopped in front of a thatched cottage in the little village of Potterne, England [near Devizes in Wiltshire]. A man and a woman stepped out and hurried up the walk, as though they were afraid of being observed. The door closed behind them. They were back once more in the cosy retreat where a pistol shot had first publicized their defiance of convention. Meanwhile, Britishers wondered whether the moral code, which they are expected to live by and which these two, Lord Vivian and his so-called \"Golden Girl\" had brazenly flouted, would now destroy the romance a bullet couldn't kill. 'The last time the couple had entered the cottage together was under different circumstances and in a gayer mood. Lord Vivian, a handsome 48-year-old baron with a wife and family was wealthy brother of Mrs. Neville Chamberlain and a perpetual wit who was called \"King of the Practical Jokers.\" After his death in 1936, she was married for three years to Mortimer Wheeler [1890-1976] who was later knighted for his research in archaeology. England's best painters vied to paint her portrait. They called her the Golden Girl. 'She met the baron late in 1953. He was Anthony Crespigny Claude Vivian, Tony to his friends. He had been educated at Eton before going to Canada as a student farmer. He moved on to San Francisco, became a call boy in a theatre, went into theatre publicity and finally emerged as a theatrical producer in London. In 1930 he married Victoria Oliphant, a Navy captain's daughter, by whom he had two sons and a daughter. 'Despite all this, it was \"love at first sight\" for the baron and the Golden Girl. She sent him back to his family for the Christmas holidays, but as soon as they were over he disappeared as quickly as the tree. He returned to her London apartment and went on living there illicitly until it was time to take off for Potterne last July. 'No sooner had they unpacked than they walked down the lane to the George and Dragon tavern for a few drinks. They had some sherry at the home of friends, returned to the tavern for some stout and finally arrived back at Pilgrim Cottage about 10 p.m. so hilarious that when the key seemed hard to locate they laughingly climbed in through a window. 'About half an hour later Mrs. Wheeler phoned hysterically for an ambulance, which arrived to find Lord Vivian lying in the garden, shot in the stomach. He was hospitalized and she was was arrested, charged with shooting him in a jealous rage. 'When she went on trial two months later, Lord Vivian had recovered sufficiently to testify. The accounts of both principals agreed up to the point of the shooting. After they had climbed in in the window, they hugged and kissed and Mrs. Wheeler went to the kitchen to prepare a meal. The baron, without her knowledge, returned to the George and Dragon. He reappeared a few minutes later at the open window. \"In a joking voice, I heard him say 'Stick 'em up,' \" Mrs. Wheeler testified. \"Then he said, 'Look what I've brought you,' and held up two bottles of stout. He had a pistol in his hand, my pistol, and he was laughing about it. \"I said. 'Oh, it probably won't go off. It's rusty.' I took it from him and pointed it at the fireplace and pulled the trigger. It did go off. I was quite astonished and fired again. Lord Vivian said, 'Stop it. You are frightening Mr. Pip' (her dog). I said, 'Just one more' and he tried to take the gun from me and it went off. I had no idea of shooting him.\" 'Lord Vivian, obviously pained to be disagreeing with Mrs. Wheeler, had a somewhat different account. When he arrived back at the cottage with the two bottles of stout, he said, \"Darling, I am coming in\" and put his leg through the window. Then there was a shot. I said something to the effect of 'Don't be silly, darling; put that revolver down.' 'Then he heard another report. He thought there were three shots altogether and the second or third must have hit him. \"I think I pushed myself out of the window and said, 'Darling, I am in pain; can you call an ambulance?' She seemed to come from nowhere and did everything possible for me. We comforted each other until the ambulance arrived.\" 'Lady Vivian, accompanied by her 18-year-old son, Nicholas, was in court to hear her husband say he was dearly in love with Mrs. Wheeler (courts have to listen to all sorts of nonsense). Mrs. Wheeler's son by her first marriage, Tristan de Vere Cole, a 19-year-old naval cadet, heard his mother testify that she truly loved Lord Vivian. 'Mrs. Wheeler was acquitted of a deliberate attempt at murder but convicted of \"unlawfully and maliciously wounding\" Lord Vivian. She was sentenced to six months in prison. When she was released from prison four months later, with time off for good behaviour - better, in fact, than she had exhibited on the outside - Lord Vivian was waiting for her. \"I think we know each other a good deal better now,\" the baron said. \"We are eternally in love.\" 'The baron must have been aware that there was little public sympathy for his troubles and that people frowned on his \"romantic\" behaviour. But he didn't seem to mind. The matter of a divorce, he said, was up to his wife. 'And there his ricochet romance rests at the moment. The whole thing, some of their acquaintances feel, might have been a tasteless bit of tomfoolery dreamed up by Mrs. Wheeler's first husband, the practical joker.'"
