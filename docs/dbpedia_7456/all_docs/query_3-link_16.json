        "text": "Dear Newsgroup:\n\nPedigree charts prepared during the reign of King Henry VII show that\n\nhis kinswoman, Eleanor Pole, daughter of Sir Geoffrey and Edith (Saint\n\nJohn) Pole, married Ralph Verney, Esq., and had issue, a son, John\n\nVerney, and other children (not named)[Reference: Collectanea Top. &\n\nGen., 1 (1834): 310].\n\nLipscomb's History & Antiquities of the County of Buckingham, 1\n\n(1847): 178 includes a chart of Verney family descendants. It shows\n\nthat Sir Ralph Verney (died 1478) and his wife, Eleanor Pole, had four\n\nchildren, Sir John, Sir Ralph, Margaret (wife of Sir Edward Raleigh)\n\nand Beatrice (wife of ____ Danvers).\n\nIs anyone knowledgeable of the Verney family who can tell if the list\n\nof children assigned by Lipscomb to Eleanor (Pole) Verney is correct?\n\nAlso, does anyone know of any American descendants of this woman?\n\nBest always, Douglas Richardson, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\nE-mail: royala...@msn.com\n\nDear Kay,\n\nFor what it is worth, Gerald Paget agrees with the line displayed by Douglas\n\nRichardson. What Richardson, sadly, did not do was give us a fuller picture\n\nby simply adding David Faris's remark that Ralph Verney, Lord Mayor of\n\nLondon, had another wife Emme.\n\n(I presume you using the name Richard Verney, was a typo?)\n\nThis makes the whole picture a little muddled. According to Paget Ralph\n\nVerney, Lord Mayor of London in 1465, died in June 1478. I cannot find any\n\nindications when John Verney was born, but his wife, Margaret Whittington,\n\nwas born before 1455. Daughter Margaret (by Emme) see PA edition 1, page\n\n184, married in 1467.\n\nWe can start guessing now, who was the first wife, Emme or Eleanor Pole, or\n\nare you correct and are Paget and Richardson wrong? Just a thought.\n\nBest wishes\n\nLeo van de Pas\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: \"Kay Allen AG\" <all...@pacbell.net>\n\nTo: <GEN-MED...@rootsweb.com>\n\nSent: Tuesday, April 02, 2002 9:23 AM\n\nSubject: Re: Descendants of Eleanor (Pole) Verney\n\n> If the marriage to Richard Verney d. 1478 were true, she would be the\n\n> ancestress of, among others, Grace Chetwode and the Marburys.

Daughter Margaret (by Emme) see PA edition 1, page\n\n> 184, married in 1467.\n\nAccording to Wedgwood, John was an MP whose dates were 1450-1505 and that\n\nEleanor was the first wife and Emma, widow of Pickering was the second.\n\nUnfortunately, Wedgwood is frequently wrong :-(\n\nSir Ralph the elder d. in 1478, John was his eldest son and heir. There appears\n\nto have been no guardianship, so we can figure he was born before 1457. The\n\nquestion is, how much before?\n\nUnder Bierton, Bucks. in VCH Bucks. p. 322, it relates that the elder Ralph\n\npurched it in 1469 and settled it on his younger son, Ralph. The younger Ralph\n\nsettled it on John Cheney for the use of Ralph and his wife, ELEANOR, and their\n\nson John. See Ct. of Requests, bdle. iv, no. 3.\n\nMy post querying the accuracy of this pedigree is dated 16 Jan. 1999. So you\n\ncan see it in the archives. It is titled, \"Raleigh, Verney, Pole, and St.\n\nJohn.\" There is an earlier thread, \"Too many Raplh [sic] Verneys\" [later this\n\nwas corrected in the head] and another \"Which Ralph Verney\".\n\nPersonally, I think I am correct :-) Look at the chronology.\n\n1. Mary Raleigh; b. c. 1500; child marriage, 1508; only child b. c. 1517/18; d.\n\n1522.\n\n2. Edward Raleigh; d. 1508; md. c. 1495/1505.\n\n3. Anne Chamberlayne; b. after 1475; d. after 1530.\n\n4. Edward Raleigh; b. before 1442; d. 1509/13; md. 1467.\n\n5. Margaret Verney; b. later than husband, probably 1447-1455.\n\n10. Sir Ralph Verney apprenticed in 1434 and was a member of the Mercer's co.\n\nby 1457.\n\nIn 1447, he was an attorney, So he had to have been born before 1426, possibly\n\nquite a bit before. He d. 1478.\n\n11. Alianore Pole. To have been the mother of children b. in the 1450s, she\n\nneeded to be born c.1430-37.\n\n22. Geoffey Pole/Poole, d. c. 1474/74.\n\n23. Edith St. John, b. c. 1425/37. If these dates are anywhere near accurate.\n\nAlianor couldn't have been born early enough to have been the Verney children's\n\nmother.\n\n46. Oliver St. John; b. before 1398; d. 1437.\n\n47, Margaret Beauchamp; b. 1409/10; d. 1482/3.\n\nKay Allen AG\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> We can start guessing now, who was the first wife, Emme or Eleanor Pole, or\n\n> are you correct and are Paget and Richardson wrong?

Almost certainly his grandson, the one who provided supposed\n\ninformation on his brother under torture and which then led, in part at\n\nleast, to the execution first of his brother and later of his\n\n68-year-old mother.\n\nBut I'm glad to see that the spelling was maintained for a couple more\n\ngenerations. The same spelling of Poole was also used in the 1612 Essex\n\nvisitation under Barrington, though with a minor detail of genealogy\n\ncompletely wrong.\n\nArthur Plaisted thoguht that the first Geoffrey Poole came from the\n\nWelshpool area of Wales in the company of with Owen Tudor and hence the\n\nadoption of that surname.\n\n"
