        "text": "PREFACE:\n\nI wrote the following piece about Geoffrey in 2005 for Countryside Books in Newbury after he received his OBE It was part of a series about county heroes – chosen in this case by the author – me – so totally biased! He was kind enough to refer to it as his C.V. It was hardly that, but it was written with love and affection for such a genuine man with a wicked twinkle – We met many times, had many chuckles.\n\nWhen news of his passing broke on November 5th 2020, it was so very very sad. There was also a very strange serendipity moment for me personally. That same day before the news broke I had been sorting out some books and a card fell out. It was one of Geoffrey’s – he had a penchant for writing on a personalised post card which he placed in an envelope to keep the contents private. Always hand written with his fountain pen and a joy to receive. None were ever dated.\n\nThis one said in response to some earlier chats we had had; ‘no great excitement in my life. Very little work, not that that’s a bad thing at my age, still fishing and getting to a lot of home games with my son to see Arsenal. See you somewhere soon no doubt! Hope all is well with you and yours, best wishes G.’\n\nWell, could be better Geoffrey, could be better! God bless and what a privilege to have known you.\n\n‘If there’s a gentle smile….that’s the nicest thing.’\n\nMany ‘gentle smiles’ are directed towards our final county hero.\n\nSmiles associated with pleasure and good memories. The constant flickers of recognition that Geoffrey Palmer encounters exude a warmth of, ‘here is someone I know, someone I like. ‘\n\nOf course, if you are in the public eye, if you are a well-known professional actor, such recognition comes with the territory, but in Geoffrey’s case he carved himself a unique international persona as well as a special local relationship with Buckinghamshire and the Great Missenden area where he lived for the last forty-three years.\n\nThe magic of Roald Dahl’s stories and rhymes that began our tour of county heroes now come full circle when we encounter the additional ingredients of Geoffrey Palmer’s voice, and acting skills as he brings the BFG and so many other tales, stories and plays to audio life. This is the other powerful and highly recognisable quality that he holds and uses to perfection – his voice. Flickers of recognition occur in exactly the same way on hearing his warm, controlled, perfectly pitched tones that guide us through the television world of Grumpy Old Men or famously lending his articulate, clipped British tones to the German language to inform us about Audi cars and “Vorsprung durch Technik.”\n\nGeoffrey Palmer is a comfortable presence in so many people’s lives. For many he is, and will always be, Lionel Hardcastle romancing Jean (Judi Dench) in As Time Goes By. For others he’ll always be Ben Parkinson, father to Russell and Adam and husband to Ria (Wendy Craig – ‘Butterflies.’) . Yet others recall the hapless Jimmy, brother-in-law to Reginald Perrin (Leonard Rossiter – The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin\n\nOr, like me, do you miss the batty Major Harry Kitchener Wellington Truscott (Fairly Secret Army) or perhaps look forward to meeting Admiral Roebuck again as he and ‘M’ (Judi Dench) deal with a belligerent James Bond (Tomorrow Never Dies).? A very long list indeed is possible here but before such a list of credited performances began its genesis, Geoffrey Palmer’s own entry to the world was on June 4th 1927 in North Finchley, a companion for his three-year old brother.\n\nAs you explore Geoffrey’s early life with him, it becomes clear that he was keen on following a military career of some kind. At Highgate School he ended up as Captain of Shooting, claiming it was the only thing he was good at unless you count the award of a ‘really naff dictionary of quotations for “the reading in chapel prize.”‘\n\nAs a teenager he aspired to what he regarded as the glamour of the Fleet Air Arm but at the medical discovered he was marginally colour blind so that avenue was closed off. In the event, by 1946, he had opted for the Marines as an HO (Hostilities Only) recruit, reporting to 928 Squad at Deal. He looks back on this time, not with misplaced nostalgia, but with a real affection that not only did he enjoy being a Royal Marine, he was also quite good at it. Indeed, his talent for shooting, which had won him accolades at school, came into its own as he undertook a small arms instructor course and eventually was promoted to full Corporal Instructor\n\nIn 1948, as an NCO, he left the Service, receiving a special grant given to ex-servicemen for re-training in ‘Civvy Street.’ In Geoffrey’s case this involved something to do with Dutch baked beans and Swedish salad cream in an import-export business but more importantly he confided, ‘I just spent the time looking at the girls and thinking, “Oh gosh, I wish I were brave enough to ask them out.”‘\n\nThis ex-corporal instructor, now trainee business man, but hopelessly shy when it came to dating, was still living with his parents in North Finchly. He did break through his shyness enough to have a girlfriend and it is to her that credit must go for introducing Geoffrey Palmer to the acting profession he was to make so much his own.\n\nWhile he enjoyed the world of the local Woodside Park Players, his disillusionment with the business world was growing. He recalls, ‘The girlfriend had got me into the local amateur dramatic society around this time and I suddenly thought one day, I really cannot do this bean rubbish anymore. I was twenty-one or twenty-two and had no interest in trying to sell Dutch baked beans and I remember thinking I’d better go and see the personnel manager, Mr. Ritter. So I spoke to his secretary, it was a Friday I remember, and I said I’d like to see Mr. Ritter. “What’s it about?” she demanded. “Well I think I want to leave,” I said. “I’ll see if he’s free,” and I went in.\n\n“Yes Palmer. What is it?”\n\n“I want to leave sir.”\n\n“What are we paying you?”\n\n“Five pounds a week sir.”\n\n“Suppose we give you seven?”\n\nAnd I though, “You s**t. If I was worth seven why didn’t you give me seven last year?” I said, “No thank you,” and left.’\n\nHe drifted a little, helping an accountant friend but that was not his forte. ‘I couldn’t add up or anything.’ He persevered with the amateur dramatics, discovering to his amazement that some people actually made a living out of being an actor. He also found it was very pleasurable to experience people laughing and clapping at the end of a performance. He was hooked.\n\nSo in his early twenties, he placed his foot on the first rung of his theatrical ladder, landing a job with the Q Theatre on the north side of Kew Bridge. The catch was that he was an unpaid trainee assistant manager.\n\nSurviving for around a year he did achieve waged status of about three pounds a week or so before moving to the Grand Theatre, Croydon, as an assistant stage manager. Locating props and playing incidental parts, his theatrical apprenticeship steadily progressed until he was taken into the repertory company as ‘juvenile character.’ He began working in rep, e.g. Leatherhead, Canterbury, Guilford, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh, building a reputation by his mid-twenties as a ‘youngish leading man.’\n\nDespite having what Geoffrey told me was a ‘grotty agent,’ it was right time, right place, right age, that worked in Geoffrey’s favour as his theatrical training was ideal for the new doors opening in commercial television around the mid 1950’s.\n\nAt this time, Geoffrey was sharing a sparse flat ‘at the wrong end of Chelsea’ close to Granada’s London studios, so picked up lots of bits and pieces with them. He also worked for ATV when they had the Wood Green Empire and the Hackney Empire before they were at Elstree. He worked with some of the top variety shows and comedians of that time such as Arthur Askey, Harry Worth, Dickie Valentine and his own hero, Jimmy James.\n\nGeoffrey’s famous career, yet to be realized, as a voice-over artist, could have been said to have started at that time when he was given ‘out of vision’ announcements:\n\n‘From the North, Granada presents, THE ARMY GAME, starring Michael Medwin, William Hartnell, Alfie Bass, etc. etc. .’\n\nGeoffrey loved working on The Army Game. Apart from the fact that the studio was only five-hundred yards from his flat, and it ran for over four years, Geoffrey fondly recalls, ‘I got seven guineas for nothing – for half a minute’s work every Friday night and then I’d do something for the odd quiz show – I was the local, cheap, jack-of-all-trades.’\n\nWhat really got him closer to being in front of the television cameras was his job on The Alan Young Show around 1957. Geoffrey explains. ‘Alan Young wasn’t happy the way the show was shot when they did the first one – so he wanted someone (this was live television as well) to act his part in the dress rehearsal of the two main sketches – brilliantly funny sketches – that made up the show. He wanted someone to do what he did on camera so he could see if the camera shots were right and decide what he thought should be a close up. So that was my job. I did what he did on the rehearsal and then I was finished. But again, being around, I did the ‘out of vision’ announcement, “From the North, Granada, it’s The Alan Young Show, starring Alan Young, Petula Clark our guest star this week,” (or Pearl Carr and Teddy Johnson) or whoever it was. It wasn’t because I had a wonderful voice. I just happened to be there.’\n\nSorry Geoffrey – the voice cannot be discounted so easily. His television commercial work has become legendary. The pitch, the diction, shading and richness of his voice, honed by thousands of hours of acting was excellent then and remained first class throughout that professional strand of his long career. Way back in 1984, the Audi car advertisement is something still associated with him.\n\n‘A German lady who lived opposite,’ recalled Geoffrey, ‘said it was a pity that everyone talked about that commercial. “This is very silly,” she said, “because Geoffrey does not pronounce it correctly,” totally missing the point!’\n\nGeoffrey’s theatrical career and television work continued apace during the 1960’s when he was wining parts in some of the legendary series of that decade: Police Surgeon; The Avengers; The Saint; Top Secret; Out Of The Unknown; Z-Cars; Paul Temple; Dr. Who: and many many more were collected along the way. However one series in particular had another significance for him.\n\nIt was a series for Granada called Family Solicitor, and it was , while staying in digs, he met the woman he was to fall in love with. Still a shy, quiet man, he pluck up the courage to propose to and marry Sally Green in 1963. That same autumn, they moved to Buckinghamshire, the county they have loved and lived in for over forty-three years.\n\nGeoffrey continued to become more and more sought after for television work – his face now very recognizable, even if the name was still one yet to be more firmly established in people’s minds. His work in the 1970’s however, soon put that right. In 1971, John Osborne cast him in his play West Of Suez at The Royal Court Theatre and Lindsay Anderson grabbed him for a key role as the doctor in his hit film O Lucky Man (1973). But for Geoffrey, it was a telephone call to his Buckinghamshire home in 1974, that really confirmed he had arrived.\n\nThe call was from Sir Laurence Olivier who offered him a part in his National Theatre production of J.B. Priestly’s play Eden End. He did not audition him as he knew he wanted Geoffrey Palmer to play Priestly’s Geoffrey Farrant in this plot of family undercurrents, which he did to great acclaim. Other substantial parts with legendary actors were on the cards, so whatever else he went on to achieve he ended up not only working for Sir Laurence Olivier, but with, and for, Sir John Gielgud, Paul Scofield and Sir Ralph Richardson. ‘Not a bad bunch to work with, is it?’ he said to me.\n\nThe fame that was to come his way, though, did not rest in his highly regarded theatrical performances, but as one of television’s favourite sit-com stars. This began in the mid 1970’s with The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, and the role of Jimmy. However, it may never had been, as Geoffrey explained to me, ‘John Howard Davies directed the pilot – the first one they did – and the pilot worked so then they commissioned a whole series, but Jimmy didn’t appear in the first one and I did not know Howard Davies. So if Jimmy had appeared in the pilot, someone else would have got the job. Then my career would have been very, very different.’\n\nGeoffrey knew Gareth Gwenlan who directed the series, as he had previously worked on some pilots with him written by Carla Lane and by Michael Frayn. After the first series of Fall and Rise, Gareth came down to Geoffrey’s Buckinghamshire home with another Carla Lane script to show him and that was Butterflies.’ So it is very much a toss of the coin’, he told me.\n\nI have refrained (until now) from mentioning what have become almost obligatory and usually first line introductory descriptions of Geoffrey’s face. It is very personal to refer to someone as lugubrious, to refer to their hangdog countenance or blood-hound looks, or see see them as having an archetypal middle-class, possibly slightly dull, down-trodden husband expression (whatever that may be). Sue Lawley began a Desert Island Discs radio programme with the words, ‘His mournful expression and rich voice have made him a household name.’\n\nThese descriptions and many more abound, not with the taint of insult but affection, and, as his sit-com fame increased, so did the ways of describing him. When we spoke of this, he did seem to have sneaking preferences for one piece that began, ‘The rugged, craggy face that has often dominated our television screens in recent years.’\n\nCan you be rugged, craggy and lugubrious? I’m not sure but in the final analysis, he has an actor’s face – one of expression and interest that holds the viewers, theatre audiences and film-goers alike. He has a voice that similarly compels listening attention and a superb acting talent that sees him range from Trollope to Shakespeare to Dickens and Priestly on the one hand, and to John Cleese, Carla Lane, David Nobbs and Bob Larbey on the other. It was no surprise, except to Geoffrey, that his ‘Services to the Theatre’ were rewarded in the 2005 honours list with an OBE.\n\nHis role as Lionel Hardcastl, romancing Jean in As Time Goes By has scored quite an astounding following. In some cases, as in America, this is their first introduction to Geoffrey Palmer, British actor. For American ladies of a certain age who fantasize about being Judy Dench’s Jean, they have dedicated websites and even meet up for ‘Lionel Hardcastle Lunches.’\n\nOf course Lionel is never there but imagine the scene should one Geoffrey Palmer happen to call by! Geoffrey is more realistic about As Time Goes By. ‘You would think it was a Bertrand Russell or something the way people talk about it – I know it is not. I think it is a very clever situation comedy – end of story. That’s all there is.’\n\nGeoffrey’s celebrity status does not sit easily on his shoulders as one might imagine. For him, his job happens to be that of an actor, albeit now a very successful and well-known one who is very much a part of the Buckinghamshire scene – a local celebrity of course, but the label is not of his choice, it just comes with the territory. Had he not been Geoffrey Palmer, actor, he quite fancied his hand at farming – not so many ‘gentle smiles’ in farming and probably not so many requests to support good causes and turn up at local events – something he does with a refreshing frankness. Commenting on a recent charity wristband campaign for the local Iain Rennie Hospice at Home, for which he is patron, he explained to me,’If they want publicity, the’ve got a better chance of doing it if they have a quasi-celeb. otherwise the Bucks Free Press, or the Gazette or the Herald won’t turn up at all. I don’t do much.’\n\nGeoffrey does have a friendly, accessible character that endears him to his local community, and it is the same accessibility he would extend to anyone whom he felt he could assist: a willingness to turn up and be Geoffrey Palmer – we might see Lionel, Jimmy or Ben – that’s up to us – and bring publicity and attention to the cause in hand.\n\nHe doesn’t do much – he’s just Geoffrey Palmer, OBE, actor and Buckinghamshire Hero\n\nFlorence Nightingale, thankfully, is a well-acknowledged international hero. A legend of nursing and female fortitude in an unscrupulous male world, her nursing heroism in the thick of the Crimean War of 1854 is well known and revered the world over. Service to Commemorate Florence Nightingale: The Ceremony of Handing over the Lamp every year on her birthday 12th May.\n\nHere is my glimpse of the other side of the ‘Lady of the Lamp’ inspired by a letter I stumbled across written by her close friend Benjamin Jowett* on 31st December 1879.\n\nI have reproduced the relevant extracts that made me determined to learn more about my ‘local’ Florence Nightingale so I too, could share in Jowett’s gratitude to this incredible woman. Hence dear blog-reader – I do hope it will similarly, provide another side to your existing perception of Ms. Nightingale – I am still in awe of what I learnt from what Jowett refers to as Florence’s ‘Silent Work’ at Claydon House, Buckinghamshire.\n\n“There was a great deal of romantic feeling about you twenty-three years ago when you returned from the Crimea* and now you work on in silence and nobody knows how many lives are saved by your nurses in hospitals; how many thousand soldiers are now alive owing to your forethought and diligence ; how many natives of India in this generation and in generations to come have been preserved from famine and oppression and the load of debt by the energy of a sick lady who can scarcely rise from her bed. The world does not know all this or think about it. But I know it and often think about it.” * (Benjamin Jowett (1817-1893) Master of Balliol College, Oxford)\n\n*Typical example of Jowett’s ‘romantic feeling’: A Brasso Polish ‘Reward’ Card 1910-1920?\n\nHere are the quite remarkable Buckinghamshire days at Claydon House, not acknowledged nor known about as much they should be, especially in this current Covid-19 Pandemic. In this 21st century, her work then, can still inform modern health expertise today, especially in how to approach the continuous and profound need to efficiently, effectively and dramatically, improve public hygiene year on year. Certainly in terms of conscientious and moral attitudes and genuine concern for humanity, there is no equal.\n\nSo many lessons are still to be learned from this hero of heroes on this current 200th celebration of her birth – in particular – her genuine love for humanity and a passion that knows no politics or selfish thoughts in the endeavours to deliver the highest possible nursing care, sanitary and healthy living environments of its kind anywhere in the world.\n\nIt was from Claydon House in Middle Claydon, near Buckingham when Florence was in her forties and living with older sister, Frances Parthenhope Nightingale, (Lady Verney, by marriage), that Florence created detailed and profound treatises on hygiene and nursing training to the highest standards. It is where she regaled against the dangers of ‘innocent’ rural ignorance about issues of sanitation and too much reliance upon traditional folk-driven patterns of behaviour, writing from her heart to her “Bucks Cottage Mothers.”\n\nCLAYDON HOUSE\n\nIt was also the place from where she wrote countless letters to others, who she felt might campaign with her on matters of nursing practice and issues of improving hygiene by the creation of health visitors. She gave unstinting support to Buckingham doctor George De’Ath, whose goal was to make Buckingham, ..’one of the healthiest, cleanest and most attractive towns in the country.’\n\nSo how did this remarkable woman, born on 12th May 1820 to wealthy English parents in Florence, Italy, come to be living and working in Buckinghamshire?\n\nWe do know from her many conversations and letters, that Florence believed in fate and at seventeen years of age claimed to have had a mystical and religious experience that was going to lead her, she knew not where, but not to the conventional family expectations of marriage , children and a womanly domestic life. She was emphatic that was not to be her destiny. Both her and her older sister (by one year), Frances Parthenhope had a rigorous home education from their Cambridge-educated father, William Edward Nightingale. The family maintained two homes, one in Embley Park in Hampshire and their country home in Derbyshire.\n\nIt was however, at the age of 31, that Florence found herself at an important crossroads in her life. Weary of her relatively inactive home life in a wealthy family and the polite rigours of being ‘on show’, she wrote:\n\n“I was always expected to be in the drawing-room. Our society consisted of clever intellectual men, all of very good society…they never talked gossip or foolishly. But they took up all our time.”\n\nShe also recorded, “..a sickly childhood, the climate of England did not suit me after that of Italy where I was born. I could never like the plays of other children. But the happiest time of my life, was during a year’s illness which I had when I was six years old. I never learnt to write ‘till I was eleven or twelve, owing to a weakness in my hands. And I was shy to misery. At seven years of age we had a governess, who brought me up most severely. She was just and well intentioned. But the first idea I can recollect when I was a child was a desire to nurse the sick. My daydreams were all of hospitals and I visited them whenever I could. I never communicated it to any one. It would have been laughed at; but I thought God had called me to serve Him in that way.”\n\nThis was written on 24th July 1851 and from that year onward her life was never to be the same again. From lamenting her private, undeclared desire to nurse the sick, she was able, that same year, to spend three months at the ‘Institution of Protestant Deaconesses’ in Germany [Kaiserwerth, near to Dusseldorf] where she learnt professional nursing skills. This made her determined to introduce such nursing training into English hospitals, but Florence was not an experienced nurse yet and her family were totally against her pursuing such a vocation.\n\nShe wrote. “…while the intellectual foot has made a step in advance, the practical foot has remained behind. Woman stands askew. Her education for action has not kept pace with her education for acquirement.”\n\nFlorence was an intellectual ‘time-bomb’ of untold knowledge and determination and so it was the Crimean War of 1854, which literally exploded into her life.\n\nShe commented how it almost ‘drowned’ her in her desire for ‘education for action’ and it was this determination not to drown that turned her into the remarkable nursing pioneer that the world now reveres. Her great friend, Benjamin Jowett, Master of Balliol College Oxford, said to her,\n\n“You are a myth in your own lifetime.”\n\nFlorence herself said when she returned after three years witnessing the horrors of the Crimea, “I stand at the alter of the murdered men and while I live I fight their cause.”\n\nImmortalised by the famous poet Henry Longfellow in 1857, she became affectionately known as the “Lady of the Lamp.”\n\nLo! In that house of misery\n\nA Lady with a lamp I see,\n\nPass through the glimmering gloom\n\nAnd flit from room to room\n\nAnd slow, as in a dream of bliss,\n\nThe speechless sufferer turns to kiss\n\nHer shadow, as it falls\n\nUpon the darkened walls. However, her nursing work in Crimea was only to be a tiny part of a career spanning over half a century. Crimea was her catalyst, the springboard, as some observers have called it – to transform not only the lowly image of the British soldier, but the disreputable public perception of nursing.\n\nAt thirty-six years of age, Florence Nightingale began a long journey to revolutionize nursing practices and sanitation policies as well as hospital designs. It was a revolution that would influence the world. Over two hundred books, reports and pamphlets came from her pen following her profound nursing experiences in the Crimean war, not to mention her highly informative letters to doctors, practitioners, friends and colleagues, more often than not, written from her desk at Claydon House.\n\nSo what of her Buckinghamshire roots? What part of her legendary life as a world hero and the first woman to receive the British Order of Merit, was spend in this county?\n\nHer county connection lies in a romance that was never to be.\n\nWhile Florence was always to be ‘the lady of the lamp,’ her brother-in-law, Sir Harry Verney, MP and 2nd Baronet of Claydon House, was to be the gentleman ‘holding a torch.’\n\nA torch for Florence to whom he proposed in 1857. Florence turned him down. However, while staying with the Nightingale family at Embery Park, Harry fell in love with Florence’s sister Frances and so in June 1858, they were married. Florence’s strong Buckinghamshire roots took hold therefore when her sister became Lady Verney and Claydon House became her second home.\n\nFlorence photographed in 1858\n\nFlorence went to stay at Claydon House over a period of 30 years, from 1860 when she was aged forty to 1894, aged seventy-four.\n\nFlorence Nightingale’s sister: Frances Parthenhope Nightingale (Lady Verney)\n\nSir Harry remained so devoted to Florence, so supportive of her work, particularly in his constant attempts to lobby the House of Commons on her behalf, he became affectionately known by other MP’s as “The Member for Florence Nightingale.”\n\nSir Harry Verney: Florence Nightingale’s brother-in-law.\n\nIt was in her Buckinghamshire days that Florence continued her ‘silent work’ as her friend Benjamin Jowett called it. Here she devised plans and policies that were to revolutionise the future of medical care, rural living and sanitary issues, as she became immersed in the health and nursing interests of the county.\n\nBenjamin Jowett (1817-1893) Master of Balliol College, Oxford\n\nShe had already published a book entitled “Notes on Hospitals,” in 1859 and so her remarkable expertise in detailing the best possible hospital provision and management was sought for a new Buckinghamshire hospital to be built in Aylesbury – The Royal Bucks Hospital.\n\nShe took to planning what she felt would be the perfect, small country hospital; from its inception in the Spring of 1860 until the laying of the foundation stone by her sister, Lady Verney, the following April, to its completion in June 1862. Her remarkable knowledge of the best possible interior layout, spaciousness, ventilation and natural light for nursing efficiency, disease control and patient health and comfort led to Aylesbury’s Royal Bucks Hospital being a pioneer hospital in all respects.\n\nAt the same time she had begun her Aylesbury project in 1860, she celebrated the opening of the Nightingale School and Home for Nurses at St, Thomas’s Hospital in London. The very first training facility of its kind. Florence would entertain the nurse probationers and their ‘Home Sister’ from St. Thomas’s Training Home, at Claydon House where they could relax in the countryside with ‘Mother-Chief’ as they affectionately renamed Florence.\n\nRemarkably, Florence was in her seventies when she produced some of her most detailed and supportive plans for Buckinghamshire, outlining her philosophies and practical remedies for what she termed, “Civil and Military Science of Life and Death.”\n\nHer real passion in those days was directed at the rural poor and their health; her “Bucks Cottage Mothers”, as she called them. She wanted to transform their homes into healthy places to live and bring up their children by educating them by means of trained visitors who could “..be in touch and in love, so to speak, with the rural poor mothers and girls, and know how to show them better things without giving offence.”\n\nFrom 1891-2, she worked with North Bucks Technical Education Committee and, in particular, with the Medical Officer of Health For North Bucks, Dr. De’Ath.\n\nIn this endeavour, she gave advice and lots of encouragement to the dedicated and enthusiastic Dr. De’Ath who was determined to develop the highest standards of rural nursing possible. This meant training suitable local ladies and then trying to persuade families to allow these ladies into their cottages to deal with often disastrously unsanitary environments. The ‘Health Missioners’ as they were called, were to be trained by the indefatigable Dr. De’Ath. This was quite a remarkable scheme and Buckinghamshire was the very first county to benefit from Florence Nightingale’s vision and Dr. De’Ath’s practical skills.\n\nWriting from Claydon House on 17th October 1891, Miss Nightingale in a confidential letter to the North Bucks Technical Education Committee Chairman, Frederick Verney, said of Dr. De’Ath,\n\n“I have seen him and have good hope that he will prove himself to be as competent as he certainly is willing, from a high sense of duty, to undertake this work – the work, that is, of training those who are to teach practical domestic sanitation to the mothers and girls, and who will be qualified by a course of work , theoretical – that is, to give them the ‘reason why’ and practical to show them how to do it, under Dr. De’Ath. I know of no such school of health now in existence for teaching of this kind as would be started in Buckingham, if this is project is carried out successfully. Buckingham may become a centre of supply of trained Health Missioners – not only for its immediate neighbourhood only, but for many parts of England where such work is sorely needed.”\n\nFlorence concluded by wishing North Bucks , “distinguish itself by its wisdom and success in giving such an education to rural mothers and in waging the war against national deterioration of health and vigour.”\n\nIndeed, by May 1892, North Bucks, in the capable hands of Dr. De’Ath, did distinguish itself by providing a quite remarkable training system of comprehensive lectures and an examination paper which he gave to sixteen ladies who wanted to be Rural Health Missioners but also around seventy other ladies attending out of personal interest to learn more about sanitation issues and Florence Nightingale’s claim that:\n\n“Life or Death may lie in a grain of dust or a drop of water.”\n\nIn a letter to Dr. De’Ath dated 13th October 1892, written from Claydon House, she said, “I give you joy with all my heart and soul at the success of your opening Lady Lectures – especially as it appears that at least Miss Bartlett had so many invitations to visit cottages. This is capital. Go on and prosper. God bless your work. I hope the Lady Missioners always report to you how many invitations they had had to Cottagers.”\n\nThen in a section she headed ‘Private’ and showing her faith in Dr. De’Ath by seeking his advice, she added;\n\n“Could you give us a simple wholesome way for Cottage Mothers to stop up the gaping chinks between the boards of the floor? Tow and red lead is recommended – but babies might find red lead dangerous. Tow and tar is messy. What is the best thing? May all your measures prove successful. But we must not expect too much practical progress at first.”\n\nYours ever sincerely\n\nF. Nightingale. (13th October 1892)\n\nDr. De’Ath did expect a great deal and worked far too hard for his health to make his plans come true. Margaret Verney recorded, “Death came to him at the age of thirty-nine, hastened by the over-strain of continual work. But his example is one of those influences which raise and build up the whole community.”\n\nDr. De’Ath had built up the community desire for healthy and sanitary living, whilst Florence had been building up an international movement towards the same goals – two heroes in perfect accord.\n\nFlorence, who had become more and more bedridden, continued to stay for prolonged periods at Claydon House, throwing herself behind all manner of local schemes to improve rural education, health and happiness. She became involved in the idea to provide a Village Free Library in the Claydons and she personally donated £50 towards buying books.\n\nThis extraordinary pioneer of so many beneficial developments for health and well-being did not confine her thoughts solely to assisting people. She delighted the children of Claydon House with the most entertaining and story-like notes sent from the confines of her bed. They would receive these pencil messages from Aunt Florence urging them to suspend mutton bones outside to help the birds get through the winter months.\n\nShe would say, “The Tom-tits have sent me a Deputation headed by the little one who, if it were to take off its clothes, would find a roomy dwelling in a walnut. They state that two gigantic black parties, called, they believe, rooks, have feloniously carried off their two best bones – Haste for thy life, post haste.”\n\nFlorence Nightingale, the perfect mixture of kindness, determination, and remarkable foresight, passed away in her ninetieth year on 13th August 1910. She was mourned by so many across the world but also they rejoiced in her many achievements.\n\nIn her Buckinghamshire days when she pioneered the Health Missioners Scheme in Buckingham, she prepared a letter for the visiting ladies to show or read to her ‘Bucks Cottage Mothers’ It began ,\n\n“Dear Hard-working friends,\n\nI am a hard working woman too\n\nMay I speak with you?\n\nAnd will you excuse me tho’ not a mother?”\n\nIndeed, she was a mother, A Buckinghamshire Hero and “Mother-Chief.”\n\n********\n\n(This article was taken and adapted from the paperback book titled “Buckinghamshire Heroes , written by David Kidd-Hewitt (Countryside Books & first published in 2005: ISBN 1 85306 929 9: other articles in this book are about, Road Dahl; Bletchley Park: Station X; Sir John Mills; Ken,’Snakehips’ Johnson; Thomas Ball; John Hampden; Dame Francis Dove; John Newton; & Geoffrey Palmer, OBE.\n\nSee: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Buckinghamshire-Heroes-S-David-Kidd-Hewitt/dp/1853069299\n\nIf you’ve a musical bent……………………."
