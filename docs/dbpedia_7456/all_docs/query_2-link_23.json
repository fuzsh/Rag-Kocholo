        "text": "page 23 note * Among the ancient deeds relating to Middle Claydon is one of the time of Edward I., by which William de Cantilupe, then lord of the manor of Middle Claydon, granted for the health of his own soul and the souls of his ancestors a rent-charge of 13s. 4d. for the provision of two wax tapers of twelve pounds weight, to be ready annually on Easter eve, and to be used daily at every mass, at the elevation of the host. The provisions of the deed are so curious that it is thought worth while to give an abstract of it.\n\n“Omnibus ad quos, &c. Willielmus de Cantilupo salutem, &c.

On this account, and also because it may save some future inquirer trouble, I mention that the will of John Verney proved in 1508 is not the will of sir John Verney, nor of any member of this family. It is the will of a John Verney of Somersetshire or Dorsetshire, I forget which, and, contrary to the practice in all other record offices, no one who searches in that office is allowed to take notes. The testator is merely described as “John Verney esquire.” In the course of researches in connection with my present subject I have been frequently stopped by the barrier which the regulations of the record office at Doctors' Commons oppose to all literary inquirers. To the best of my knowledge and belief, that office is the only depository of historical documents—I had almost said the only office of any kind in the kingdom—in which there is no feeling whatever in favour of literature and historical inquiry.\n\npage 59 note * In an original document in the State Paper office (Domestic, 26 March, 1556,) there occurs the following passage: “He likewise told me of the talk between the queen and my lady Dudley, that she asked her where her brother Henry was? and she made answer, ‘In France, as I hear say, for I knew not of his going.’ And then the queen asked her for what cause he went over; and then she answered, she thought for debt. To whom the queen answered, that he needed not for debt, for we have given him iiijxx li by year. And my lady affirmed and said, ‘And like your grace, that is true, but, notwithstanding all, that did not serve him. He was so afeard of his creditors that be durst not tarry here any longer.’ To whom the queen's majesty said, ‘If it had been for debt, if we had been made privy he should not have gone to the French king to pay his debt, for as we are credibly advertised, he is so received at the king's hand, and so entertained, that if he had been the most noble man coming from-us thither [he] could not have been better or the like—marvelling much,’ said the queen's majesty, ‘for what cause the French king should entertain any subject of ours in such sort.” We have quoted the whole of this long passage, because the conversation is characteristic, and will be found to tell upon the future history of the conspiracy; but in reference to the question, of Who was Dudley the conspirator, the chief importance of the extract consists in establishing that he was a brother of a lady Dudley who was in the court temp. Mary. The lady Dudley whom this description at once brings to mind was Katherine Brydges, daughter of the first lord Chandos of Sudeley, and wife of Edward lord Dudley of the family of Sutton de Dudley, one of the gentlewomen in ordinary attendance on queen Mary. By letters patent, dated 31st December, 2 and 3 Philip and Mary, A.D. 1555, the queen made a settlement upon that lady and her intended husband, and she was then described as “una generosarum ordinariarum super personam dictæ reginæ attendentium,” whom lord Dudley, “deo favente, in uxorem ducere intendit.” (Rot. Pat. 2 and 3 Philip and Mary, part 2.) This looks very like the lady who was Henry Dudley's sister, that is, sister-in-law; nor is proof wanting that a brother of Edward lord Dudley might have been called by the name of Dudley. The family name was Sutton, Sutton de Dudley, but the branch of the family seated at Yanwith in Westmorland, and which was descended from Edmund the eldest son of John the fourth lord Dudley, was called Dudley and not Sutton. One of them, a John Duddeleye, lies buried in Stoke Newington church. His widow (a connection of the Verneys) was afterwards married to another Sutton, the founder of the Charter house. (Nicholson and Burn's Westmoreland, i. 412; Hist. Stoke Newington in Bibl. Topog. 10, 33). If it be thought that Henry Dudley was a son of some nearer connection of the duke of Northumberland as, for example, of sir Andrew Dudley, K.G., then the question arises: Who was Henry Dudley's sister, the lady Dudley mentioned in the quotation we have just given? It is altogether a puzzle which at present we cannot unravel with any certainty.\n\npage 153 note § Venetia, daughter of sir Edward Stanley, of Tongue castle, in Shropshire, and wife of sir Kenelm Digby, a lady celebrated for beauty, frailty, and, after her marriage, for the strict practice of a ceremonial religion. Ben Jonson commemorated what he terms her “fair fame,” in his poem of Eupheme, and the other wits of the time were no less affected by her death than Mr. Dillon. Her husband, it will be remembered, racked his chemical skill to preserve her beauty by cosmetics, and, after her death, strove to immortalise her features by a bust of copper gilt, set up in Christ church, Newgate street. The cosmetics availed but little against the great conqueror. The bust was injured in the fire of London, and was last seen, ten years afterwards, by a strolling antiquary, at a broker's stall in Newgate street. Equally unfortunate were the plaster casts which sir Kenelm possessed of her hands and feet, as well as of her face. Every memorial of her beauty has disappeared, except the lines of Ben Jonson— “Sitting and ready to be drawn”—and her portraits by Vandyke. These constitute a double immortality, whatever else may have been lost.\n\npage 189 note * William, first baron and ultimately earl of Craven, one of the prime notabilities of this period. Three of his peculiarities are touched upon in the present letter; his want of a pedigree, evidently deemed a great offence; his vast wealth; and his almost boundless liberality. He soon afterwards proved himself in the wars of the palatinate to be a brave soldier, and was finally united, as is thought, by a private marriage, with the rash but beautiful princess who stirred up all that strife. The ambition which led her to urge her incompetent husband to accept the proffered crown, in order that she might be a queen, probably induced her to prefer an ambiguous connection rather than an open marriage with the titled but meanly descended man whose wealth was her support, and his devotion to her service her best protection, for many years. Lord Craven's father was a London tradesman. He was lord mayor in 1611. Lord Craven contributed 10,000l. at one time for the purpose alluded to in this letter. Charles II. received from him 50,000l. at the least before the Restoration.\n\npage 190 note ¶ Henry Verney to Ralph Verney. This letter relates to the siege of Breda, an atchievment of great importance in those days. The Spaniards had taken the place by famine, after a dreadful siege of nearly eleven months, in 1625. Their garrison had been a great trouble to the surrounding country, and the prince of Orange determined to regain the town. After long preparations, the object of which was kept profoundly secret, the prince suddenly concentrated his forces round Breda, at the end of July 1637. The result appears in the report of young Henry Verney. Among the prominent Englishmen who served and suffered on this occasion, one to whose after career we have already alluded was in considerable danger. We read, in a contemporary account, that on the 23rd August, young colonel Goring, whose valour, it was said, appears in his youth, not “in blossomes but in fruits,” received “a fauleon-shot in his ancle, which, to the eye of the chirurgeons, appeared so dangerous that they concluded he could not escape unlesse his legge were cut off: the noble gentleman bore the hurt patiently, but not the conclusion of his chyrurgeons; he resolved rather to lose his life than his limb.” His chaplain, “Doctor Calfe,” ultimately induced him to give his consent, and the surgeons were preparing to perform the operation, when “an old expert chyrurgeon cpmmeth in, undertaketh the cure, and performed it happily, it being now scarce a blemish to the eye, and discernable onely by a little halting.” Biatelesma.

Now for ammunition; twenty good musketts, twenty amunition swords, with twenty belts and twenty pair of bandiliers.\n\nItem; two great iron kettles containing twelve gallons a peece, two great iron potts, one holding eight gallons the other six, two little potts about two or three gallons a peece, and a stew pan: Now for necessaries for the plantation; flue dozen of broad hoes and three dozen of narrow hoes, flue dozen of axes, a dozen of bills, and two dozen of hatchetts. Nayles of all sorts to build with, ten thousand of double tens, ten thousand of single tens, and ten thousand of six peny nayles. Now for thread to mend their cloths, and twine to mend their shoes, and cours bedtick to make them hamacks to lye in; for thread ten pound, ten dozen of twine, and an hundred yards of cours bedtick with fifty dozen of hamack lines; soe much for that; yet I had allmost forgott fouer dozen of spades, and fouer dozen of pickaxes, a hunderd pound weight of powder, half a hunderd of pistoll bulletts, and a quarter of a hunderd of good cotton match. Now for some necessaries concerning myself. As first, for one good cloth sute, and one taby or good stuff sute. Now for necessaries concerning houshold prouision: First, fouer hogsheads of good beef, fouer firkins of butter putt up in earthen potts, beeaus of keeping, fouer jarrs of good sweet oyle, ten pound of sugar, [a proof that the cultivation of the sugarcane had not then been introduced into Barbadoes,] as much pepper, some nuttmeggs, cloues, and cinamon, twenty holland cheeses, or good chessheir chees, a hogshead of good bay salt, an hunderd weight of good castle sope, three pound of starch, and a pound of blew starch, an hunderd weight of good wax light, that keeps best from melting in this countery. Six cases of strong waters that the men may euery morning drink a dram to keep them in health; for my part I drink non. I need not putt downe tooles for euery tradesman, for I beleeue you will not send them unfurnished, for if you doe they will doe mee but little seruice.\n\nFouer bolts of canvas to send cotton home in.\n\npage 229 note * “Received 6 May, 1639.” The commitment of lord Saye arose thus:—Strafford, then viscount Wentworth, imposed upon all the Scots employed in the royal service in Ireland an oath that they would submit to all his majesty's royal commands, and not enter into any covenant or bond for mutual defence without the king's authority. The king, approving the example, not only imposed the same oath upon all Seotish persons employed in his service in England, but caused it, or something very like it, to be tendered generally. Two English peers, lord Saye and lord Brooke, “ positively refused,” says Clarendon, whose statement of the contents of the oath is very inaccurate, “in the king's own presence, to make any such protestation. They said,” If the king suspected their loyalty, he might proceed against them as he thought fit; but that it was against the law to impose any oath or protestation upon them which were not enjoined by the law; and in that respect, that they might not betray the common liberty, they would not submit to it. ‘... They two were committed, at least restrained of their liberty; yet they discovered too much the humour and spirit of the court in their daily discourses upon that subject, so that the king thought it best to dismiss those lords, and require them to return to their houses.”—Hist. Rebell. lib. ii.\n\npage 232 note * In a letter of the same date as this from Edmund Terney, he states, “We rose from Celby within a little after the writing of my first letter [p. 213 J, and then upon the march I had divers shrewd fitts of an ague, but now I thank God it hath left me, and I am as well as ever I was in my lyfe. We are now at Ryton, within five miles of Newcastle, but we dayly expect orders to march away, though I beleeve it will not be above twelve miles beyond Newcastle, when I am confident we shall stay till the foote come up to us, which I beleeve will be at least this fortnight, for wee left them at Celby, and not half of them gathered together. * * * I verily beleeve that within one month or sixe weekes wee shall see what businesses will come to. Wee that either are or would be souldgers feare the best and hope the worst.”"
