I. LONDON LONG M A N S, . G R E E N, A N D C 0. AND NEW YORK : 15 EAST 16'\" STREET 1892 A II rig fits reserved INTRODUCTORY NOTE In 1845 Mr. Bruce edited for the Camden Society ' Notes of Proceedings in the Long Parliament,' from the jottings of Sir Ralph Verney, and in 1853 he fol- lowed them up by a volume of ' Letters and Papers of the Verney Family ' reaching down to the end of the year 1639, published by the same Society. The extraordinary value of the collection of MSS. pre- served at Claydon House thus became sufficiently known, but though Mr. Bruce contemplated the pre- paration of another volume, he had not taken any steps towards it at the time of his death. The great mass of the papers was still in disorder, and much had to be done before progress could be made in this direction. Not long after her marriage, which took place in 1858, the late Lady Verney 's attention was attracted to the treasures contained in the house. Some of the numerous portraits were stacked in outhouses, one of them being fastened over a hole to keep out rats. These she arranged, and with the help of descriptions in old lists managed to identify most of the subjects. vi VERNE Y FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR No less care did she devote to the collection of papers, one bundle of which was endorsed by some fatuous person, ' Private letters of no interest.' She soon began to read them, all the more eagerly perhaps because she was even at that time somewhat of an invalid and compelled to pass a considerable part of her time on the sofa. The arrangement of the letters in chronological order was gradually completed, and many whole letters or extracts copied for easier re- ference. Then the idea of writing the story of the family dawned on Lady Verney's mind. For this task she had admirable qualifications in addition to her extreme interest in the subject. She had received from her father, Mr. Nightingale, an excellent education, in- cluding; a good knowledge of English literature. Her bright intelligence was quickened by her warm sym- pathy, and to her the personages of the seventeenth century, whose joys and sorrows are told in their writings, were as living as her own contemporaries. Gossip about the love affairs or the pecuniary embar- rassments of Pen or Sue Yerney, who lived during the Civil War and Commonwealth, flowed as readily from her lips when she found a fitting listener as tittle-tattle about the pictures in the London exhibi- tions or about the latest fashions flows from the lips of others. Nor was it only with the actions of these persons that she was familiar. She sounded their hearts, and came to know instinctively what each one of them was capable or incapable of doing. INTRODUCTORY NOTE Vll No wonder, therefore, that the work which Lady Verney had undertaken fascinated her mind. Before she had proceeded far, she was attacked by the acutest form of rheumatism, arthritis, and lived for years under the infliction of constant pain. Yet she never from this cause laid her work aside, which indeed to some extent alleviated her suffering by drawing her attention away from herself, the last ob- ject of which, in her days of health, she would have been likely to think. At first she was able to use a stylograph pen with difficulty, but at last the condi- tion of her hands became such that not only did this become impossible, but she was unable to turn over the pages of the letters which she wished to consult. How great a difficulty was thereby thrown in the way of the composition of her narrative may be easily imagined. Mr. Bruce's books were of great assist- ance to Lady Verney in writing the first volume, and she has used them freely in the earlier part of the story, in some places adopting whole paragraphs. What could be done for her by helpful friends was freely offered. Her own loving nature made helpful service easy. Her husband Sir Harry Verney cheered her by his constant interest in and sympathy with her work. Prominent amongst those who at this time rendered assistance were the Hon. Misses Frederica and Catherine Spring Rice, who were most energetic in collecting materials and verifying quota- tions, whilst much work in copying was entrusted to Lady Verney's faithful amanuensis, Mr. W. J. Morey. Viil VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR After some hesitation Lady Yerney decided on bringing1 down her work to 1650, the year of the death of Sir Ralph's wife, which formed an epoch in the domestic history of the family ; the appearance on the scene of Sir Ralph's son, young Edmund, opening as it were a new chapter, and bringing a reader of the correspondence into the presence of the genera- tion which took part in the overthrow of Puritan supremacy and the restoration of the monarchy. Lady Yerney herself had almost completed the first, and had sketched out and partly written the second, of the two volumes now issued. What remained to be done by filling in gaps, by inserting quotations, and by some excisions where the narrative strayed too far into the domain of political history, has been accomplished by her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Verney, with the assistance of the Misses Spring Rice. Mrs. Yerney wishes me to add that she would be glad to receive any information from readers of the book who may have at their command any further evidence to offer on the history of the Yerneys in the seventeenth century, or of other families connected with the Yerneys, and that such communications should be addressed to her at Clayclon House, Win slow, Bucks. Samuel R. Gardiner. February 20, 1892. PREFACE The value of contemporary records, even of the purely private life of the letter-writers of bygone centuries, has only been acknowledged within very late years. It almost required an apology when such home-spun materials were presented to the public. Now, however, we are deluged by a mass of documents unearthed by the Historical Commission ; and it will be long before the information thus acquired can be worked into the common stock. The period before and during the Civil Wars, to which the Yerney letters so largely belong, must always be supremely interesting to us as the turn- ing point in English History, especially when seen through the eyes of those who lived and wrote in those anxious times. Though facts may have been misapprehended by them, though their opinions may have been mistaken, what cannot be wronsr is the vivid record of the atmosphere in which these men and women lived. and of the beliefs and impressions that surrounded them and produced the overt acts which alone have been chronicled. X VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIYIL WAR The ' dignity of history ' has a great deal to answer for. It has been supposed to concern itself only with reigns of kings, conquests and defeats, alliances and treaties, and the intermarriages of rather uninteresting personages, while the great stream of life of common-place people, what they thought and what they felt, has till lately been only considered important when the mass of convictions became powerful enough to create an upheaval of some definite kind. History is indeed written in a different spirit at the present day. The collection of original letters belonging to private families is probably larger in England than in any other country. The great houses in France, Germany and Italy have been ransacked by foreign armies ; millions of papers have been destroyed in political and religious persecutions, fire and the sword have made away with the owners and their homes, and what remains has generally been swallowed up in the national collections. In England the papers still exist in their original homes, but till now they have been a sealed book. The stories of the perils they have gone through are harrowing to an antiquary. At YVroxton some peculiar writing was noticed on the paper cap of a carpenter by an observant boy ; ' waste paper,' they said, ' taken out of those dirty old boxes ' — in which were afterwards found the correspondence of a Chancellor of the days of Henry VIII. In another house some bags of rubbish were removed out of a closet to make way for jam and PREFACE XI soap, and a parchment of a Knight of the Garter of Elizabeth's time dropped out. ' Oh. that's only the old paper the housemaids have to light the fire with,' said the housekeeper. When Sir R. Puleston of Emral sold his goods and chattels, the Jews who were carrying them away asked leave to pack the smaller valuables in the piles of old papers which they said they found in the garrets. Some wise man took the trouble to look into them before they were removed, and a number of letters of Margaret of Anjou were found amongst them, of whose writing not a scrap had previously been known to exist. When the present possessor of Claydon, Sir Harry Verney, came to live there, he found a wainscoted gallery at the top of the house, forty feet long, full of boxes on tressels containing bundles of letters, acres of parchment, charters and pardons with the great seals attached, early editions of plays, account books, terriers and rent-rolls — these literally, as their name implies, strips of paper stitched together, many feet in length, and in this case dating from the time of Henry VII. — ' Mercuries,' diurnals of the period of the Civil Wars, ' newes letters ' — the early form of news- paper before the printed manner of promulgating news had been invented — all these were ' stacked ' round the room. Some few were touched by damp ; some, where the paper was at all greasy, gnawed by rats ; but the}r were generally in very good condition. The letters related to the private concerns of the Verneys, who owned the Manor of Claydon for four- xii VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR teen generations, beginning with Sir Ralph, Lord Mayor of London in 1465 and M.P. for London in 147 2, and going down to Mary Verney created Baroness Fermanagh, who died unmarried in 1810. These years include the most stirring periods of English history. The Verney records are only those of an ordinary gentleman's family of the higher class. mixing a good deal in the politics of their times, with considerable county and local influence ; Members of Parliament, sheriffs, magistrates, soldiers — never place-men — marrying in their own degree, with no splendid talents or position to boast of, no crimes either noble or ignoble to make them notorious, and, for that very reason, good average specimens of hundreds of men and women of their age. Their actions, their opinions and beliefs, their thoughts about public affairs and home perplexities, their joys and sorrows, their habits of life and manners were not too fair and good, or again too evil, to be shared by households of their own class, so that we come nearer to the ordinary public opinion and social standards of their day than by reading of those exceptionally great men who only partially represent their age, and yet which history has brought before us almost exclusively. Most of the work of the world is done by average men and women, and the personal records of the Verney s, touching on small matters as they generally must, are not without a very general interest in the great history of their country. The materials are only too voluminous — PREFACE xiii there are 30.000 letters up to the date of Sir Ralph's death in 1696. Sometimes there is a letter for every day in the year, with a copy of the reply subjoined by Sir Ralph and carefully docketed by his son Lord Fermanagh, with an interpretation of the ciphers, initials, devices to conceal names of places and persons which in these troublous times were frequently used. The paper on which they write is coarse, with un- trimmed edges, but is strong and lasting. The hand- writing of the men is for the most part bold, clear and o-ood, but the education of the women in the seventeenth century was evidently very inferior to that of the time of Elizabeth ; their penmanship is execrable, and their spelling purely phonetic. Lady Sussex (a clever woman and very great lady, who married three Earls in succession after the death of her first husband, Sir Henry Lee) has considerable doubts about her Hs — ' Mr. Bakon,' half-nephew of the Chancellor, ' his heer and is brother ' — ' will you get me a Member of the hoper hose' (the upper house). It requires some apprenticeship to recognise Yorkshire, St. Alban's, and Lincoln's-inn-Fields in ' 0}Tskescher,' ' Sentarbones,' and k Lingeslinds tildes.' ' Amazes me ' is written ; A maisis mee.' And Lady Sussex was no exception. Lady Verney's two sisters, clever women of the world and accus- tomed to the best society of the day, write and spell much after the same fashion. The great mass of letters were preserved by Sir Ralph Verney, the then head of the family. He was Xiv VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR one of those useful men who seem to regard every scrap of written paper as snored. lie kept every- thing ; notes in answer to invitations, old bills, broadsides, doggerel verses, foul copies of orders to bailiffs, attorneys' accounts, tailors' bills, &c, leaving it to posterity to select what was valuable. Posterity however is very capricious, and is apt to cast aside all sorts of grand things committed to its charge, and to find interest in petty details supposed to be beneath its notice. The materials are so abundant that in two volumes it has been only possible to reach the year 1649-50, after the execution of the king and the death of some of the principal actors in the family history. This period includes the story of the chivalrous, high- minded, honourable Knight Marshal, Sir Edmund Yerney, torn in pieces by his attachment for his master Charles, whom he had served almost from their common boyhood, and his belief that the party of the Parliament was in the main right ; who chose rather to lose his life in battle than to continue the struggle to fulfil such conflicting duties. His son, the painstaking, conscientious Sir Ralph, somewhat formal and precise, most upright of men, writer of ' Notes of the Long Parliament,' of which he was a Member, who, when he considered that his party was going too far, preferred exile for about seven years rather than sign the Covenant in which he did not believe, or agree to measures which he thought to be wrong (for this his estate was se- PREFACE XV questered, and lie himself ousted from Parlia- ment) ; the gallant young Cavalier, Sir Edmund the younger, brother to Ralph, brave, loyal, affectionate, unswerving; in his convictions and in what he believed to be his duty, who, when little more than thirty, was put to death in cold blood after the storming of Drogheda ; the scapegrace Tom ; the clever, shrewd, worldly, exacting Lady Sussex, and the two sisters Mrs. Eure and Mrs. Isham, Ralph's aunts, figure in the earlier part of these volumes. Later, especially after Ralph is exiled to Blois, are long letters, describing what is going on in London from 1643 to 1649, from Dr. Denton, a mild Royalist, kind-hearted, cynical, clever ; from Sir Roger Burgoyne, M.P. for Bedfordshire, who had espoused the ultra side in Parliament ; from Colonel Henry A^erney, selfish, self-seeking, faithless, who changed from side to side according to his interests, and from the charming Mary, Ralph's wife, painted by Yandyck, who was sent by her husband to London to try and negotiate his return. Married to him as the heiress of Abingdon, &c, when only a child herself, most devoted of wives and most tender of mothers, she wore herself out by her exertions and her journeys, generally on horseback, and died when only thirty- three after her return to her husband at Blois, just as her efforts had been crowned with success. The materials had to be collected painfully, a few lines here and a few words there, out of hundreds of vol. i. a XVI VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR letters otherwise perhaps quite uninteresting ; but in such a case as that of Sir Ralph, after reading again and again, in thousands of different forms, the most minute details of his thoughts, his feelings, his diffi- culties and anxieties on every possible subject, one grows almost more intimate with him than with any living friend of the present generation, and it becomes a work of conscience to attempt, with the best skill one can bring to bear on the subject, to piece together into a coherent whole the character and fortunes of men and women so mixed up with the political struggles and the Civil War in England during those momentous }^ears from 1630 to 1650.

The names and stories of some have been hope- lessly lost, and a whole series which were sent up to ' Lundun to be cleand and vernist,' were literally flayed alive, while at least one Yandyck and two Jansens have disappeared altogether. Happily among the letters were several old lists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which, together with some dates and inscriptions on the pictures themselves, have led to the identification of all the portraits here given. The illustrations are photo-intaglio copper plates, carefully reproduced from photographs taken of the original pictures at Claydon ; the autographs are facsimiles of signatures from old letters and deeds. We are greatly indebted to Messrs. Walker and Boutall for the infinite pains they have bestowed in producing such artistic and beautiful engravings. The descriptions of the pictures, given with quotation marks, are from old lists. Sir Edmund Verney, Kt. ..... Frontispiece From a picture painted in Spain, at Claydon House. ' Over the door of the Print-room is the picture of Sir Edmond Verney, Kt. Marshall, with short hair,' — mentioned in all the lists.

This portrait, by Cornelius Jansen, is one of the most difficult to identify, because there is a hopeless confusion in the lists between the Hobarts and Herberts, both families having been intimate with the Verneys. The picture itself is described as ' in a Persian habit, furred,' and it probably represents Anne Leeke, wife of Sir Nathaniel Hobart.

' .... an English home gray twilight pour'd On dewy pastures, dewy trees, .... all things in order stored, A haunt of ancient peace.' — Tennyson. The house at Claydon is spoken of as having been rebuilt in the reign of Henry VII., but there had been an ' ancient seat ' on the spot in the days of the De la Zouchs and Cantelupes, from whose descendants Sir Ralph Verney, the Lord Mayor ip 1465, acquired the property. A pencil sketch exists, of uncertain date, which represents one phase of the old building, with gables in ' corbel steps.' Its lines were framed on the initial letter of the king's name, H during the reign of the Henries, E during that of Edward and Elizabeth, and the fashion seems to have lasted into the reign of James I. Although altered, added to, almost transmogrified, the form of the ancient manor house may still be VOL. i. b 2 VEKNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR traced at the core of the present building. The central narrow part, joining the two blocks, consisted, until thirty years ago, of two rows of rooms back to back, so that the ends of the house could only be reached by passing through a whole suite ; passages were unknown at that period of architecture. None of the walls were at right angles ; the floors rose and fell again in the same room to a difference of three or four inches in level ; it was like walking over a ridge in a ploughed field ; and a ceiling would vary in height as much as six inches in a length of thirty feet. A great chimney, with chimney corners on the ground floor, ran up the centre of the house, belonging pro- bably to the hall-kitchen ; another was in what was called the ' Tenants' Hall.' These were probably the only two which the house contained at the time it was built. As late as the reign of Elizabeth, Har- rison, quoted by Holinshed, observes, ' Old men have noted three things marvellously altered in England within their sound remembrance. One is the multi- tude of chimnies — in their younger days there were not above two or three, if so many, in most upland ish \" towns \" in the realm (the religious houses and manor places of the lords excepted), but each made his fire against a reredosse in the hall, where he dined and dressed his meat. . . .' ' Now we have many chimneys and yet our tenderlings complain of rheums, catarrhs and poses. Then had we none but reredosses ; and our heads did never ache.' Originally the fire was made in a hole in the HOUSE-KEEPING AT CLAYDOX 3 earth or hearth,1 shut down by a cover when the family went to bed — the ' couvrefeu ' (curfew) of William the Conqueror's edict. The reredos was a movable back to the fire, which was in time trans- ferred to the wall, the chimney formed a small chamber with settles on each side, and ' dos; irons ' or ' andirons ' 2 in front to support the logs of wood. Three ' reredosses ' with the family crest of the Phoenix in flames, were found in the outhouses at Claydon (one dated 1664, belonging to Sir Ralph), and several pair of andirons. In the central chimney at Claydon, a small chamber of concealment was found (when the house, was repaired thirty years ago), in which ten men could stand upright, a ' priest's hole or conveyance,' the secret of which had been so well kept as to be altogether forgotten ; such hiding-places were known only to the owner of a house and his eldest son, and were handed down with solemn secrecy to the next generation. At Claydon it was ingeniously masked by a blind passage in the middle storey, and was com- pletely dark. It must have been entered by a trap- door in the muniment room, at the top of the house ; where, too, was a concealed door leading to a small private stair, long since destroyed, but of which the stone heads of the steps could still be traced. If enemies forced their way into the house, a man might 1 Hearth is defined by Dryden as the ' pavement of a room where a fire is made.' 2 ' Her andirons I had forgot, two winking Cupids done in silver.

A similar stair still exists at Mancetter, near Atherstone, with a break half way, where a man must let himself down several feet. It is an illustration of the probable origin of half the ghost stories de rigueur in old houses, that this room where the trap-door and stairhead required that all prying investigations should be discouraged, was the haunted chamber of the place. The particular apparition inost likely varied with the period ; at Clay don the ghost of Sir Edmund Verney, the Knight Marshal, as the most marked man of the family, was the one whose appearance had survived up to the present. He was supposed to be always looking for his hand, severed from his body at the battle of Edgehill, which, according to tradition, had been found still holding the king's standard, though the body itself was lost. There was probably little or no glass in the house of Henry VII. 's time ; linen steeped in oil was the substitute, or wooden shutters closed only at night, still to be seen in Spain and South Italy. The glazed casements of the Dukes of Northumberland were removed for safety when the family left Alnwick, and Sir Thomas More in his ' Utopia ' mentions that ' there were glass windows in most of the houses ' of his ideal country, as a proof of its advanced civili- sation . The rough walls of the rooms were covered with HOUSE-KEEPING AT CLAYDON 5 tapestry or wainscot. The tapestry at Claydon, mentioned in the old lists, has all disappeared, but much of the wainscot remained in garrets and out- houses. The ' use of the wainscot ' was esteemed so important that it is specifically granted to Sir Edmund in 1634, in the lease of the house which he took in Covent Garden, and all the separate pieces are enumerated. ' Stock-locks ' on the doors were also a luxury ; they were kept loose ' in the closet,' says the Claydon inventory ; and in 1650, when this same London house was let, it is mentioned as quite a new idea that, as the doors are so badly injured by the continual pulling off and on of the locks, they might as well be left on permanently. All classes were content to endure an amount of cold which we should find unbearable, from the absence of fires and the extreme airiness of houses, where no windows or doors ever fitted. In 1620, when Sir Edmund took possession of Claydon, after buying back from the Giffards the end of a hundred years' lease, he was so hampered by the expense thus incurred, and by the bad condition in which the estate was left by his tenants, that he could do little to improve the house. There are three inventories and descriptions of it, the first ordered by Sir Ralph soon after his father's death in 1645, the next about eighty years later, and the third quite at the end of the last century, which together give some idea of the growth of a country house. 6 VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR Sir Ralph, then an exile in France, tells his brother that ' since the beginning of the Civil Wars, the best goods have been removed from ye right places to bee more saifly layed upp, and noates must be taken of what by my order are stored up, lent, sould or given away.' He mentions ' ye studdy over the greate porch,' Sir Edmund Verney's closet. Most of the rooms seem to have had an inner dressing- room with no separate access. Wheat had been stored on the oak floor of the dining-room when threshed, but it must be seen that ' the cullor of the boards be not hurt.' ' The odd things in the roome my mother keept herself, the iron closet, the little roome betweene her beds head and the backstairs ' — evidently a secret place — ' the little and greate Frip- peries [i.e. hanging closets for gowns] your owne greene wrought velvet furniture, the red velvet fur- niture, the looking-glasses (there should bee at least four), leather carpets for the dininge and drawinge rooms, the stooles with nailes guilt, the great cabanet like yours, the tapestry, the great branch candlestick, all such wrought worke as my mother had from London and was not finished, the booke of martirs and other bookes in the withclrawing-room, the pre- serving-room, the spicery with furnaces and brewing vessels, plat left for the children's use, all the lockes that are loose in the closet ' — such was the interior of the old house in 1G45. The house is situated on a gentle slope sheltered from the east and north — our ancestors showed a g— ^T CLAYDON HOUSE IX THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY NOKTH FKONT (From an old Pencil Drauiinj.) HOUSE-KEEPING AT CLAYDON 7 strange dislike to wind in the positions they chose for their dwellings (as opposed to castles intended for defence), and none at all to damp, which is to us more objectionable ; the difficulty of obtaining fuel may account for their preference of what seemed to them warm — and to us low situations. To the east of the courtyard and stables which bear the modern date of 1764, lies a straggling mass of buildings of every possible description. A great house provisioned itself, with little help from the outer world ; the inhabitants brewed and baked, they churned and ground their meal, they bred up, fed and slew their beeves and sheep, and brought up their pigeons and poultry at their own doors. Their horses wrere shod at home, their planks were sawn, their rough iron work was forged and mended. Accordingly the mill-house, the slaughter-house, the blacksmiths', carpenters' and painters' shops, the malting and brewhouse, the wood-yard full of large and small timber, the sawpit, the outhouses full of all sorts of odds and ends of stone, iron, bits of marble, carved woodwork, and logs cut for burning — the riding- house, the laundry, the dairy with a large churn turned by a horse, the stalls and styes for all manner of cattle and pigs, the apple and root chambers, show how complete was the idea of self-supply and inde- pendence of trade of any kind at Claydon as in other country houses. Of the ' Dove Cotts,' we read continually in the letters, as a dozen pigeons were an acceptable present to friends in London, almost S VERiXEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR preferred indeed to the venison, which Sir Ralph is very generous in distributing. In a series of graduated little pools in the garden called ' the Stews,' belonging to the Old Roman Catholic days, the fish caught in the larger ponds below was kept for immediate use. A supply of wild fowl was obtained from a Decoy ' celebrated in the neighbourhood,' observes Browne Willis, leading by a long watercourse from a great pool about a mile away into the heart of the ' Charndon and great sea woods.' The difficulty of keeping cattle and sheep alive in winter on the scanty stores of hay was so great that until the middle of the 17th century they were killed and salted down early in the autumn. In the Northumberland household book of the reign of Henry YIL, it appears that fresh meat was eaten only between Midsummer and Michaelmas. The frequent mention of skin diseases in the Verney letters shows how the salt diet, almost unrelieved by vegetables for many months, told upon the health particularly of the women and children ; any little relief from fish and game was valuable. Matters were however improving in the days of James and Charles I. Salt meat was now only used after Martinmas, potatoes had been introduced by Sir Walter Raleigh, and Sir Ralph is intent upon many sorts of salad and vegetables which he sends from France between 164l and 1653. That they were not altogether new, however, is evident from the cynical remarks of his uncle, Dr. Denton. On receiving HOUSE-KEEPING AT CLAYDON 9 the presents of seeds and plants from his nephew, he often declares that he ' cannot see they are much better than the sallats he has already.' Ralph on his return is very anxious for the welfare of the vines and no- trees, the roots, seeds, flowers, and THE GAUDEN. (From a sketch by Lady Yerney.) ornamental trees, which he gets over from Holland and France, and in spite of Lord Macaulay's state- ment to the contrary, it is clear that great attention was beginning to be paid to gardens and pleasure grounds. We hear of the ' Persian tulips and ranon- 10 VERNE Y FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR cules ' sent him by his son John at his particular request, apparently from Holland ; the pinks, gilli- flowers, melon seeds and pear-grafts, and ' the exact fine gardens' at Claydon are mentioned in 1694 by Cecilia Fiennes. The woods were always a great feature of the Claydon Estate, and the arts of wood- craft and forestry amongst the constant interests of its owners. Sir Ralph desires his steward to go and see ' Cozen Smith's hedges at Akeley,' which are grown in a west-country fashion, and to give him his opinion of them. Within doors the activity of the family and house- hold was as great and as multifarious as without. The spinning of wool and flax (so universal that an unmarried woman of any class was called ' a spinster'), the fine and coarse needlework, the embroidery, the fine cooking, the curing, the preserving, the distillery that went on, were incessant. The excellent linen spun at home and woven in the cottage handlooms (well described in ' Silas Maimer '), was so valuable that it was left by will with great particularity. Margaret, Lady Verney, is as careful to which of her daughters she will leave her 'best sheets,' and to whom ' the second best,' and the ' table clothes,' as about the destination of her diamonds, and though her children are a loving family, there is nearly a disagreeable quarrel between Sir Ralph and his sister Pen, when she prefers money, and he allows her only 8Z. for the sheets in question. As 10/. at the time is the price of a good horse, this sounds a quite sufficient sum. HOUSE-KEEPING AT CLAYDON 11 The work with the needle and the wheel was a very necessary part of a lady's education, and as some of the poorer relations of the family resided in great houses as ' lady helps ' (the equivalents of the pages of the other sex), they were useful and welcome in carrying out these important household labours. There are letters from five or six of these ladies, connected with the Verneys, well born, well bred, and as well educated as their neighbours, who seem to have been treated with great consideration. ' Sir George Strickland's daughter is my lady's gentle- woman ' to Lady Sussex, and Sir Ralph's cousin, Lady Hobart, is very anxious when she becomes poor and a widow, that he should obtain the place for her daughter ' Frank.' Doll Leake, another cousin, is living with Lady Vere Gaudy and her daughter-in- law, Lady Mary Fielding, who are both warmly attached to her. She is busy embroidering a bed on one occasion, and writes to Sir Ralph in London to help her with the silks and crewels required for it. Lace-making had been introduced into Bucks by Catherine of Aragon, whose dowry was derived from the revenues of Steeple Claydon. She was visiting at a house- in Buckingham, still standing in Sir Ralph's days, when she received the news of the victory at Flodden Field. ' St. Katern's day ' was held as a festival in her honour until not long ago, by the makers of pillow-lace in Buckinghamshire ; and the allusion to ' The spinsters and the knitters in the sun, And the free maids who weave their thread with bones,' 12 VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR whom Viola quotes as her authority for a song, shows that pillow-lace was commonly made in England in Shakespeare's time. The work of the still-room, the 'preserving, conserving, candying, making syrupes, jellies, beauti- fying washes, pomatum essences, and other such secrets,' the making of vinegar and pickles, must have been held by the family to be quite as important a j)art of their business. Accordingly in the fruit season the ladies are very fully occupied. Lady Gardiner is excused by her husband from writing to Sir Ralph — ' being almost melted with the double heat of the weather and her hotter employment, because the fruit is suddenly ripe and she is so busy preserving,' and this though their household is very large, consisting of thirty persons. Mrs. Isham sends word to Lady Yerney, through Sir Ralph, ' I praye tell yore mother (in London) I will doe oup hur sugar if she hath corrantes a nowe, for this last wicke of windes hath bine so bige that most of them was bloed off the treeses.' The remains of queer tin vessels of many shapes with spouts at all angles, in the ancient cupboards of the Claydon still-room, and the endless recipes amongst the papers, show how the ' decoctions, infusions and essences of herbs and simples ' were prepared. When a doctor wrote a prescription, he directed how the medicine was to be made. ' The snail water, the hiera picra, the mithridates, orbiculi, Bezoartis,' and the like, are all thus explained. HOUSE-KEEPING AT CLAYDOX 13 The fruit syrups, raspberry vinegar, home-made wines, currant, cowslip, and elder, were important drinks when tea, coffee, and chocolate were unknown. All three were introduced about the time of the Restoration. When Sir Ralph was young, the health of his bride was drunk by Sir Nathaniel Hobart ' in ale and cake, my wife and aunt will do the like,' showing it was the beverage for women as well as for men.1 Some twenty years later, in 1650, Sir Ralph, in exile at Blois, writes anxiously to London for ' the quite new drink chocolate,' for his dying wife ; his uncle sends directions how to make it, because ' the thing itselfe is not knowne in France.' The fashion however spread quickly, for a few months after another exile sends the invalid a still better kind from Paris. The next year Sir Ralph, travelling after his wife's death with his little boy through Lyons, mentions ' coffee, a berry out of Turkey, ground for a drink,' as a curious novelty, and Pepys, as is well known, partakes of ' the new China drink, tea,' for the first time in 1660, after which the use of it became common. Claydon must have looked melancholy enough to Sir Ralph, on his return from exile in the autumn of 1653, 'to keepe company with the ghostes,' a widower and alone in the deserted house. The estate had been so long without a head, under the management of 1 The bitter and sweet do not sound pleasant to our taste, but that it was a favourite combination is evident from Sir Toby's speech in Twelfth Night : ' Dost thou think because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale ? ' 14 VERNE Y FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR the steward, that, as Sir Ralph wrote to a friend, ' In these times our old servants are become our new masters ; ' but after the Restoration his finances were once more set in order ; the pictures, which had been rolled up for safety, or carried abroad, were hung ao-ain in their places, and there is much told of- rebuilding in the house and of improvements in the gardens. Clay don is once more a centre of hospitality. Sir Ralph's aunt, Margaret Sherard, laments that ' my ill helth prevented me of coming to Sweet Claydon this somer for thers noe company nor plas y* I like better than what I had found ther.' ' My wife and I are thinking what new peice of plate we shall find next time we come to Claydon,' writes Sir Roger Burgoyne in 1671. Sir Ralph delights to share his plants with his friends. ' I have received your presant,' says Lady Vere Gaudy in March of the same year, ' and I shall indeavour to make them grow, but our soile is not for raritys, thorns and thistles is my portion in it, but now you are goeing to your parradise, may it afford you all the pleasure can bee injoyed on earth.' Little as Sir Ralph sympathised with Charles II., he found that they had one taste in common, for he sends him more than once some young trees from his nursery at Claydon. Sir William Boreman writes to Sir Ralph from ' Whitehall this 12th of May 1671 ' :— ' So I begg yr pardon that I have bin soe long before I return'd yu the king's kind acceptance of & HOUSE-KEEPING AT CLAYDON 15 thankes for the Quickenbury trees 1 yu sent his Maty to whorne I deliverVl them in yor name & told him howe bountifull y11 had bin before in furnishing, or rather beautifying Greenwch park wth plants of that kind ; they thrive exceeding well, & I should bee very happy to see y11 there, that yu may see howe well they florish upon a piece of as barren ground as is in England. However, yor kindnes is not barren, wch upon all occasions I have receaved the fruite of, weh is most thankfully acknowledg'd by,' &c. We hear of l the spicery with a brass skillett,' of ' the fir walk ' where the old man totters along-, of ' the orange chamber ' where he sits coughing and reading during his last illness, and where his meals are brought when ' he is too ill to get up for supper or prayers during his last week of life,' as his faithful factotum observes sadly ; of the brick parlour and of the great hall opening out of the porch into the best court, which were hung with black cloth when he died ' loved and honoured by all the country round,' as his niece writes. Next comes a catalogue of the eighteenth century.

Miller says : ' In Italy they have many varieties from seed, but I have not observed in the English gardens more than three, and those, are very scarce. . . . There was one in the garden of John Tradescant at South Lambeth (Charles I.'s Italian gardener) near 40 feet high, which produced a great quantity of fruit annually, shaped like pears.' 16 VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR with brass head/ in my lady's chamber ; chairs covered with gilt leather are in the matted gallery ; chairs with walnut-tree frames, covered with yellow silk flowered with silver, are in the white drawing- room, while the ' middle brown lodgings ' have ' iron dogges, tapstry hangings, a silk quilt and Modena window curtains.' There are new pictures of my lord and my lady, but, alas ! by Walker and Lenthall, instead of the Yandycks and Cornelius Jansens of the former generation. The last account is quite at the end of the century, when the last Verney of the old blood, Lady Fer- managh, inherited from her uncle, Ralph Earl Verney. He was a second son, and his elder brother died leaving a widow with an unborn child, so that for five months he did not know whether he should ever possess the large estates which he dissipated so unwisely. He was a man of magnificent instincts, great artistic taste and knowledge, and boundless extravagance. He besran to build soon after his father's death in 1752, the architect Adams, of the Adelphi, giving the plans. Three large rooms, a great central hall with marble pillars, and a ball room 120 feet long, were filled with carved woodwork, doors inlaid with ebony, ivory, and satin wood, and plaister mouldings on the ceilings done by Italian artists of great beauty and variety. A central stair- case, with steps like marqueterie, is a beautiful feature ; the wrought-iron scrolls and wreaths of % HOUSE-KEEPING AT CLAYDOX 17 wheatears forming the banisters are of such delicacy and finish as to rustle at the tread of a passer-by. The proportion of the new rooms is very fine ; the library is nearly a double cube, 50 feet long and 25 feet high ; the pink parlour or summer dining- room, a single cube of 25 feet with lovely carvings, gives the impression of being much higher. Lord Houghton, sitting down to dinner there, exclaimed, ' I like a room where one feels one can stand upright.' The pictures, the books, the furniture were all on the same scale of lavish expenditure and taste ; one bedroom was ' furnisht all with silver,' of which only a lovely little mirror now remains. Lord Verney fought the county in the Liberal interest against his rivals, the Temples of Stowe, and finally came to utter ruin. Before the house was finished the creditors rushed in and carried off every- thing, even to a marble chimneypiece for the library which had not yet been put into its place ; the pic- tures were happily heirlooms. His wife died in the crisis of their troubles, and he himself was said to have escaped in the empty hearse which had removed her body. After a while he returned, probably to get a little money, and hid in the desolate house, ' to keep company with the ghosts ' in a still sadder fashion than his ancestor. An old man used to describe, within living memory, how, as a boy of fourteen, he had ' seen the old lord a lookin' out of a window, and a beckonin' to me.' The house was perfectly bare, but the boy and a neighbour got vol. i. c 18 YERXEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR him a table, a chair, and some food, and later a bed.

The estate now comprises the chief part of the manors of the four Claydons, Middel, Est, Botyl, and Steppel, as they are termed in the old deeds, but it was only gradually that the Yerneys obtained possession of them, parting sometimes with land in other parts of Bucks and the adjoining counties of Oxford and Herts — Fleet Marston near Aylesbury, Penley near Tring, &c. — to consolidate their property. The home chapel of Middle Claydon, which is much the oldest and the smallest of the three, stands within a few yards of the house, with the l priest's door ' at the top of a flight of stone steps over- shadowed by yew trees, close to the library windows. It was during the long lease of 100 years granted by the Yerneys to the Giffards, with whom they had twice intermarried, that the chancel was built, over the high narrow door of which is carved ' Rogerus Giffard et Maria uxor ejus hanc cancellam fieri 20 VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR fecerunt an'o D'ni 1519,' the work beginning in 1509.

Even with the utter disregard of symmetry evinced by our ancestors, which is one secret of the picturesqueness of their groups of buildings, it is almost impossible to fancy THE FOUR CLAYDONS 21 that the house should, without any reason of space or lie of ground, have been built askew with the church; whereas when ' St. Michael and all angels ' was the patron chosen from some unknown associations of affection, the line from east to west, settled as usual §& \"i-7'g* ' .'- wm ■Si I mm ^y?&t- >^y^S: •& ••■ THE PRIEST'S BOOK, MIDDLE CLAYDOX CHURCH.

Close to the chancel step lies a large brass of a knight in armour, Roger Giffard, builder of the chancel and first holder of the lease of Clay don, with Mary ( Yerney) l his wife in coif and wimple by his side, thirteen little sons in gowns kneeling at his feet, seven little daughters in coifs at hers, small as befitted their inferior status to their parents (dignity was denoted by size, as in the reliefs on an Egyptian tomb), 'On whose sowlls Jh'u have m'cy, 1543,' says the inscription. The brass of the last Roman Catholic vicar, another Giffard, is at the foot of the pulpit, with a label proceeding out of the mouth of his portrait, ' Miserere mei Deus,' and ' orate pro a'i'a D'ni Alesandri Anne p'sbiteri ' below. He bequeathed a great bell and a legacy to the high altar of Middle Clay don and for the repairs of the church.

(the mark was only money of account, not a coin, and represented about £8 of present money in 1390), to supply the torches which were to be newly furnished on the vigil of Easter, ' and to be kept burning for ever.' ' What- soever remains is to be made into other candles before the Holy Cross, the Blessed Virgin, and elsewhere in the Church, as the Bailiff of the Lords of Middle Claydon and the Churchwardens shall think most meet.' They are also to be witnesses of the weight of wax, and the provisions for the execution of his wishes are many and stringent.

Urian Verney and his wife Lettice (Giffard) have secured a place for themselves as close to the altar and the candles as possible, which seems to have been considered a position of great comfort and honour to the souls of the occupants. They kneel one on each side of a sort of altar, their hands joined in prayer, and between them is a small son who lived to be ' oon prest.' The epitaph contains a most inex- tricable confusion of pronouns and relationships. ' I Urian, the sixt of seaven sonnes and daughters of Sir Ralph Verney Kt. at his death made this monument for myself and my wife Lettice daughter of Sir George Giffard, issue one sonne and I the survivoreof my six brothers and twoe daughters [meaning sisters], the one married to Sir Francis Hynde Kt., and the other to Sir Nicholas Pointz,1 &c, &c. a.d. 1608.' The south side of the chancel is almost filled by an immense monument which Sir Ralph caused to be designed and executed at Rome when he went there in 1()52, to the memory of his father and mother, his wife and himself. Four fine busts in niches are sur- mounted by Faith and Hope, cherubs, skulls, and ' There is a fine chalk head by Holbein of Sir Nicholas in the Queen's collection.

Below is the bust of Sir Ralph of the Long Parliament, quiet, sedentary, reflective, cautious, and conscientious, and the ' Lady 26 VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR Mary,' his charming wife, whom lie loved and reverenced so fondly in life, and after her death, during his forty-six years of widowhood. The churchyard was altered by the last Lord Verney, and the tradition still exists in the village that ' he never prospered arter that, ye know, for why, he moved the dead. But they was all back again next marnin ! safe in their graves ! ' ' What, some- one carried them back, you mean ? ' said the hearer. ' Nay, none knew how, but there they all was/ replied the narrator solemnly, as befitted her super- natural history. The respect for the last home of those who can no longer defend it, is very deep-seated in this country. ' Est ' Claydon is the type of an old English village ; a number of half-timbered black and white houses, with an occasional date from 1650, inter- spersed with great elms, stand in and out of narrow twisting lanes at every sort of picturesque angle, leading up to an old manor house, now a farm, where Mr. Abel, sheriff in 1658, kept four horses, ' the 'Sizes being then held at Buckingham.' In 1662 his only child Mary married Edmund Verney, the eldest son of Sir Ralph, and both he and his wife lived and died in the White House, which has hardly been touched since. It is now a farmhouse, but preserves the dignity of ' keeping a ghost.' The un- fortunate Mary, who went out of her mind shortly after her marriage and often wandered at night about the churchyard and gardens in a weird manner, is THE FOUR CLAYDOXS 27 probably the unquiet spirit. The story, as told in the cottages, is that the white lady, who had been much beloved by her husband, haunted the house and especially her former room so persistently after her death that the unhappy widower got no rest. He removed the boarded floor, but without avail ; the COTTAGES AT EAST CLAYDON. ghost walked along the joists ; then in despair he drove nails into the joists, and filed their projecting heads into sharp points ; the poor wounded ghost appeared no more ! A brutal tradition to be asso- ciated with the memory of one who ' was very pious and gentle,' notwithstanding her sad state, with occa- sional respites of sanity, and who, in defiance of the 28 VERNE Y FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR legend, survived her husband several years. The inn, ' the half-way house,' belonging to her was re- built by Edmund Verney with their joint arms and initials over the door. It stood by what was once the higdi road from Buckingham to London, diverted to its present course in the reign of Queen Anne ; it can still be traced as a mere track across the fields ; it is probably quite as good now as it was then ; the ruts were so deep that Sir Ralph describes his coach as sticking fast near Aylesbury, and only to be dragged out by cart horses. The church dedicated to St. Margaret stands on a little eminence surrounded by high elms and over- looking the vale of Aylesbury. The distant Chiltern range bounds the view, with the chalk hills above Hampden and Chequers still in possession of a descendant of Oliver Cromwell, beyond which lies Chalfont, where Milton took refuge at the time of the plague. Two bells, inscribed ' in melodise nomen Magdalenae,' and a ' Mary bell,' with ' ora pro nobis ' on it, still remain. ' Botyl ' Clay don, from a word meaning a hamlet or place enclosed from the waste, belongs to the same church. Botolph and East Claydon, after belonging to the De Mandevilles and De Greys, were owned, like Steeple Claydon, by Lionel, Duke of Clarence, and passed from him to the crown in the time of Edward IV. They were connected with the order of St. John of Jerusalem, and a well approached by steps, called St. Botolph's well (a corruption of THE FOUR CLAYDOXK 29 Botyl), and the name of an adjacent farm, Muxwell (Monk's well), probably refer to some old monastic establishment, of which all trace is lost. A number of small parchment deeds, measuring two or three inches deep by seven or eight wide (the more ancient the EAST CLAYDON CHURCH. deed, the smaller are its dimensions), still remaining in the muniment room, concern little purchases aud arrangements between the rector or the owner of Claydon and the inhabitants, small parcels of land, 'tofts,' 'crofts,' and ' pickels,' which passed into the hands of the Verneys at different times. The earliest 30 VEKNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR in date are generally witnessed on Sundays, as learned men, able to write their names, were always rare in the country, and it was convenient to get a deed signed at the church door where there would be a greater choice of ' clerks ' in the congregation. A deed of 16 Edward II. concerns the 'toft of Alice Avenel of Est Claydone,' and is witnessed by ' John called the monck, Roger le prest, and John le Bonde,' showing that either he or his fathers had been bondsmen.1 Botolph House, a substantial brick and stone manor house, stands at the east end of the village shaded by an old cedar, and a magnificent sycamore, the largest in the neighbourhood. The tradition is that the last Lord Verney gave his steward seven acres of land and 3,000/. to build a house on it, and that the money was all spent in the foundations and the ground floor. In a distant part of the estate, in the midst of lonely meadows and woods, far removed from any road or even footpath, is a spur of land called Finmere, standing out into the flat plain towards Oxford, with a far-reaching view over fields, copses, hill and dale, arable and grass, stretching for thirty miles or more, to Edge Hill in one direction to the north-west, and to Cumnor Hurst, the home of Amy Robsart, in another to the south-west. In this most appropriate situation there was a tiny hermitage, 1 'Dom' (Dominus) 'John, Rector of the Church of Middele Claydone,' signs another. THE FOUR CLAYDONS 31 wliicli with ' meadow pasture and wood for repairing fences and houses ' and ' passage for swine ' was given by Henry II. to a religious house of the ascetic order of Augustines, who allowed the hermit 135. 4d. xi year. If the holy man did not live on acorns and the beauty of the position, it is difficult to see on what he fed, unless he condescended to a goat and perhaps a garden of herbs, for the distance from human help in the way of alms must have been great indeed in the thirteenth century, as it can hardly be reached now in bad and muddy weather. Steppul or Steeple Claydon is much the largest village of the four. In the days of William the Conqueror ' it was considered the most populous town ' (indeed, a sort of capital) of the Lamua hundred ; when ' Alric the cook holds of the King, Claydon,' it is described in Domesday Book as possessing fifty copyholders or villeins, and three cottagers having nineteen ploughs, mast for 100 hogs, and as being worth 16/. a year, a sort of gauge of the inhabited state of the country round. In 1120 Henry I. granted the manor to Edith, ' amasiam suam,' as a portion, when he caused her to marry Robert de Olleyo (de Oily or Doyley), son of the Lord of Oxford. After this she is called ' an eminent and devout matron,' and was buried in the Abbey of Oseney ' in the abbite of a vowess ' on the north side of the high altar, in the church she had built in expiation of her misdeeds ; being miraculously directed to the spot by chattering pyes, who were o2 VERNE Y FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR painted over her tomb. She bestowed much land at Claydon on the Priory, and bequeathed ' one of the villeins of Claydon, with his wife, children, and cattle in perpetual alms,' as slaves, in fact ! A curious little deed in the muniment room concerns the granting of a piece of ground in order to build a ' common house,' a sort of village town- hall, where business might be transacted which was otherwise done in the church, greatly to the distress of the clerics. This house is to be 56 feet lono- and 18 feet broad, to the north side of the rectory threshing floor. ' The religious man John by divine permission Abbot of Oseney grants it to the proctors and parishioners of the Ville of Steppul Glaydon to have and to hold.' They are to pay fourpence rent at the feast of the Blessed Virgin for ever, but if they do not ' pay up,' the convent, after three demands, may distrain and impound ; and if the house go to ruin without hope of restoration they may resume the ground. The deed is signed and sealed by an official of Buckingham, ' because the seals of the churchwardens are not known to many.' Probably, indeed, they had none ! The whole transaction shows an interesting little bit of village government, the tiny parliament of Steeple Claydon holding business transactions with the great Abbot. The Mote or Court for the meeting of the Hundred of Lamua was anciently held in the park meadow below the church (where are a number of ditches and earthworks) — another link in the intricate series of THE FOUR CLAYDONS 33 little local assemblies culminating in the Witenagemot,1 the parent of our present Parliaments, which our ancestors had devised with that curious instinct of self-government inherent in the English race. Steeple Claydon has been the dowry of a great number of royal ladies since William the Conqueror first granted it to his niece Judith, Countess of Huntingdon. ' Edith, King Edward's Queen [query Isabella], held this Manor,' says Brown Willis. It was afterwards held by Philippa, granddaughter of Edward III., wife of Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March ; then by Cecily, Duchess of York, and was given by Henry VII. to his wife, Elizabeth of York, Duchess Cecily's granddaughter. In 1508 Henry VII. granted it to Catherine of Aragon, Princess of Wales, on her marriage with Prince Arthur, and she held it again as the wife of Henry VIII. Queen Elizabeth made a grant of some land charged with a ' mainten- ance of lamps in the Church of Steeple Claydon.' At the time of the Civil War the Chaloners were lords of the manor.2 Sir Thomas Chaloner was tutor and chamberlain to Prince Henry, eldest son of James I. ; his nearest neighbour, Sir Edmund Verney, being also of the prince's household ; ' which Sir 1 ' Our present Parliament is the true and lawful representative, by true and lawful succession, of the ancient \"Meetings of the Wise.\" ' — Freeman. 2 For a fuller account of Sir Thomas Chaloner and his duties, moral, ceremonial and sanitary, in Prince Henry's household, see Birch's Life of Henry, Prince of Wales, where the discovery of the alum mine is attributed to him and not to his son. VOL. I. D 34 VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR Thomas,' as the monument in the church records, ' was son of the famous Sir Thomas Chaloner, a great soldier and scholar, knighted by the Protector of Edward VI. He was by Queen Elizabeth for his bravery and learning sent ambassador to the Emperor Ferdinand and to Philip II. , King of Spain.' Another Thomas Chaloner, grandson of the ambassador, described as ' a well-bred gentleman, of very good naturall parts and of an agreeable humour/ had a strange career. He discovered while hunting in Yorkshire that there was alum in a certain kind of soil, such as he had seen in Germany, and he got a patent from Charles I. for the first alum works in England. The profits proving considerable, the king did his best to deprive Chaloner of the fruits of his discovery, which so incensed him that he threw himself into the Parliament cause, and was one of the king's judges. He was a man with a good deal of cynical wit. He would spread a false rumour in the morning in Westminster Hall for the sake of seeing how the scandal would have grown by the afternoon ; and he greatly exercised his friends the Puritan ministers, for whom he had scant sympathy, by publishing an anonymous pamphlet on ' The Discovery of Moyses' Tomb,' which they long thought to be genuine. At the Restoration ' the Regicide Chaloner ' was attainted and his estates forfeited. They were bought back by another member of the family, and then sold in 1705 to Sir John Verney, Lord Fermanagh. There THE FOUR CLAYDOXS 35 is a monument in the church to Edward Chaloner, who died in 1766, 'a Lieutenant in the Navy above STEEPLE CLAYDON CHURCH. 30 years ; he showed his courage in 10 expeditions in Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern Seas.' The church dedicated to St. Michael is the largest and the least interestiDg of the Claydon churches. D 2 36 VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL AVAR The vicarage has an oak-panelled parlour, with an elaborate plaister ceiling richly and grotesquely ornamented, said to be of the time of Henry A^II. An old stone barn close to the church, on a ridge commanding a very extensive view, bears this inscription, written by Mr. Bruce: — ' The Camp Barn. ' Around this spot, the Army of the Parliament, under the command of Cromwell, was encamped March 1644, and on the 3rd of that month, advanced from hence to the attack on Hillesdon House.' A school-house was built by the Chaloners, and furnished with a. clock ; but so far had that ancient seat of learning decayed, that when Sir Harry Verney first came to Ckydon, the school was in rums and the yard was used for bull-baiting. The name, still existing, of Bull Lane, shows the route by which the bulls entered Steeple Claydon. The lower part of the village belongs, as seems to have been the case for at least 300 years, to a number of small proprietors, from the owner of an acre to ' King Dodge, a farmer.' Some of these cottages are wretched, small, and insanitary, mostly built on the waste — i.e. the space which, before hard roads were made, it was necessary to leave on each side the muddy track, amounting sometimes to 60 or <S0 feet in a clay country. The old letters show how much the aspect of the country has been altered by cultivation. Sir Ralph, THE FOUR CLAYDONS 37 writing to his steward, mentions a piece of moorland and rushy, boggy swamp between Bottel Claydon and the rectory, now part of the park and excellent pasture. Colonel Henry Verney complains that his horses are 'fleeted' — i.e. tethered — which injures them, and Sir Ralph, who is keeping them for him, replies that as all the meadows are unenclosed they would otherwise escape. Quainton Seech, about five miles from the outer border of the estate, was a swamp given up to bittern and woodcock. Cromwell on his return from Bicester was met there by the mayor and aldermen of Ayles- bury, and had a day's hawking on the wild marshy plain, now all cultivated fields. Not far from Thornborough is a public-house still called ' The Lone Tree,' showing that there was once a wild treeless common here, though, it now stands in the midst of hedgerow timber. 38 VERNE Y FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAE CHAPTER III. THE EARLY HISTOEY OF THE VERNEYS, 1456-1599. Thronging through the cloud rift, whose are they, the faces Faint revealed yet sure divined, the famous ones of old ? ' \"What ' — they smile — ' our names, our deeds, so soon erases Time upon his tablet where Life's glory lies enrolled ? ' Browning. Although there are different mentions of Yerneys from the time of King John, Sir Ralph Verney, Lord Mayor of London, is the first of the family of whom we gain a distinct notion. He was a successful mer- chant living near the Great Market, or Cheap, where was the hall of his Company of Mercers, close to 1 Paul's Walk, the general resort for business and gossip ; ' he was chosen sheriff in 1456. The contest of York and Lancaster had lasted eighteen years, and cost the lives of 100,000 of the people ; it was ended by the battle of Tewkesbury, and Edward IV., representing the White Rose, which was considered the party of progress, was popular in London ; he testified his gratitude by knighting twelve citizens, of whom Sir Ralph stands first, on the very day that the dead body of Henry VI. was exposed to public view in St. Paul's. EARLY HISTORY OF THE VERNE YS, 1456-1599 39 The year after, Sir Ralph was elected one of the members for London in the Parliament which finally settled the succession. Edward, ' considering the good and gratuitous service rendered by Sir Ralph,' granted him several forfeited lands in Buckinghamshire ; he bought back the old family property at Fleet Marston, and pur- chased the manor and advowson of Middle Claydon, on which he had advanced money. He did not however live there, but leased it for a hundred years to the Giffards, and died in 1478, when he was buried in the church of ' St. Martin's Pomary,' so called from the many orchards which, as ' large void places,' were to be found even in the reign of Elizabeth, in what is now the very heart of that wilderness of houses called the City. He ordered his tomb to be placed ' between the quire and our Lady's Chapel ; ' both church and tomb were destroyed by the great fire in 1666. His will is in English. He bequeaths his ' soule vnto Allmyghty God in trinite, fardir, and sone, and holy gost, to the moost glorious virgyn, our lady saint Marie, modir to the ijde person in trinite, our blissed Lord Crist Jesu my redemer and saviour.' After providing for his widow Emme, his daughters Dame Margaret Raleghe and Beatrice Danvers, and his two sons, he gives legacies for the 1 reperacione ' of the church of St. Martin : '100 marks to fynde an honest and convenable preest to syng for my soule, and the soules of my fadir and modir, my brothrene, my sustren, my children, and 40 VERNE Y FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR the soules of my speciall frendes Thomas Fauconere,' &c. To the ' oolde werks of the Cathedrall Chirche of saint Paule ' he gives ' xxs.' He does not forget ' poure and nedy prisinors ' in Newgate and Ludgate, Marshalsea and King's Bench, and other prisons. For the ' reparacione ' of the church at Fleet Marston, his country home, he gives ' cs.' A bequest for ' thamending of foule and ruynous weies about the citee of London, and nere aboute Aylesbury and Flete Merston,' shows the state of the roads at that time. To his twelve servants he gives liberally : ' xs to John Jakke, child of my kichen.' To his ' trewe lover,' John Brown, alderman of London, he be- queaths one of his ' cuppes covred of silver gilt.' Gifts for ' good dedes and werks of charite and pitee ' are to be added ' to profite unto the helthe of my soule.' His eldest son, Sir John, married the great-grand- daughter of Sir Robert Whittingham, stated in the pedigrees to have been Sheriff of London in 1419, often confounded with Whittino-ton of o'ood cat memory ( ' who was certainly neither sheriff nor lord mayor'). Sir Robert's son was ' Squier of household and servant ' to King Henry VI., and his grandson, another Sir Robert, was a staunch Lancastrian, who held several important offices and stood by Queen Margaret against the offer of Parliament that Edward should succeed instead of the infant prince. After the disastrous battle of Wakefield, in which he fouirht, a price of 100/. (equal to 1,500/. of our present money) was put on his head, as one of her most dis- EARLY HISTORY OF THE VERNEYS, 1456-1599 41 tinguished adherents. When Margaret, the only child of so loyal a Lancastrian house and named after the queen, married John Verney, son of an equally strong partisan on the Yorkist side, there was probably much opposition in both families. Whether it was some old-world story of Capulets and Montagus, the hatred of the parents staunched by the loves of the children, or only a ' canny ' political alliance, cannot now be found out. Sir Robert the father was, however, attainted of treason after the defeat of his party, and all his possessions and lord- ships, his rights of fairs and markets, his houses and advowsons in London, &c, were forfeited, and Mar- garet was left penniless. But again the tide turned in favour of the Red Rose ; Sir Robert took the field for the queen, while Sir Ralph was as strenuous as ever for Edward IV. in the city. The Yorkists soon regained their ascendency, however, and at the battle of Tewkes- bury Sir Robert died an honourable death. Sir Ralph was returned to Parliament, and brought all his influence to bear with the kino- in favour of his o son's wife. In consideration of his own humble and faithful service, the lands of her father were restored to Margaret : unfortunately, however, the kino; had given them for life to Sir Thomas Mont- gomery, and to his brother the Duke of Gloucester (Richard III.), and for years the struggle with them went on unsuccessfully, even after the death of Sir Ralph. 42 VERNE Y FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR After the battle of Bosworth and the death of Richard III., everything, however, was changed, and Sir John Verney changed his tack also ; he sank all mention of his father's services to the House of York, and brought prominently forward the sufferings and losses of his wife's father to the House of Lancaster — ' it is contrary to all reason and conscience ' that the land should be taken away because of the service ' he did and owed to the blessed Prince Henry VI.' There must have been a great deal of such tergiver- sation where one party succeeded another so quickly on the throne. Sir John Verney now took possession of the different estates of his wife, and they lived a quiet, secluded life at Penley Hall, which he rebuilt. He served as sheriff for Bucks in 1494, and for Hertford and Essex, where he had property, in 1499, and was much occupied with a number of lawsuits entailed by the difficulties concerning his wife's estates. Just before his death in 1505, aged only fifty-five, he renewed the lease of Claydon to the Giffards for eighty years, at a rental of 13/. 6s. Sd., with the important exception of the great woods, which were leased soon after to Sir Harry Lee of Ditchley. Only once he is mentioned as joining in the court ceremonials, when he was present at the coronation of Elizabeth of York. He was buried at the beautiful convent at Ashridge, near Penley, with his wife's relations, and four years after, at her particular wish, she was laid by the body of her husband. She had sold in her husband's lifetime, 1501, theadvowson of St. Stephen EAELY HISTORY OF THE VERNE YS, 1456-1599 43 Walbrook, bought by the Whittiiighams in 1432 ; the sale of livings is no new or Protestant institution. In these early days when there are few or no letters, more can be learnt from the wills concerning family life than from any other source. Lady Verney leaves her lands, manors, lordships, and tenements among her three sons, but her ' horses, oxon, shepe, and other catell ' at Salden go to her son John ; to her daughter Cecilia and her husband ' on fader bed, on bolster, on payre off blanketts, and a hanging for a chamber as shalbe thought convenient by my executor and broder sir Rauffe Verney ; also I beqweth to my doughter Anne Dame on kyrtyll off Make damaske, and on gowne of blake cloth, purfeld [bordered] with tawney velvet.' . . . ' The resydew of all my goodds and catall, my detts and beqwests fully content,' she gives to her brother Sir Ralph Verney, executor of her last will, ' he to dys- posse for the well off my soule and all my frynds soulls as he shall thynke most expedient.' Among the ' certen detts ' due from Dame Mar- garet Verney, ' wedewe late wyfe to sir John Verney knyght, the Lady Colett claymeth xxxyj li ' : she was mother of Colet, Dean of St. Paul's, one of the most marked among the Oxford reformers, celebrated by Erasmus — ' when I listen to him it seems like listening to Plato himself.' He was the first to attempt the reform of English education, and his good work may still be seen in St. Paul's school, which he founded. 44 VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR The younger brother of Sir John, a second Sir Ralph, passed his life at Court. At the coronation procession of Elizabeth of York, in 1487, he rode as one of ' two esquiers of honor, well-horsed, in gowns of crimson velvet, having mantles of ermine ... on their heads hats of red cloth of gold, ermines, the beaks forward.' They came with the lord mayor, next before the queen. Soon after Sir Ralph Verney married Elea- nor Pole, a lady-in-waiting to the queen, and related to Henry VII. Her grandmother secondly married John, Duke of Somerset, and became the mother of Margaret, ' the good Countess of Richmond,' whose memory was long held dear, and whose beautiful altar-tomb is to be found on the south side of the royal chapel in Westminster Abbey, erected by her son Henry VII. ; the king thus had the same grandmother as Lady Verney. When young Prince Arthur had a separate household arranged for him, his cousin Sir Richard Pole was made chief gentleman of the bedchamber. He married the last of the Plantagenets, the Lady Margaret, niece to Edward IV., who was afterwards created Countess of Salisbury. She was barbarously beheaded by Henry VIII. in her old age, nominally for receiving letters from her son, Cardinal Pole, then conspiring against the king as a heretic, but really for the crime of having blood royal in her veins ; the Cardinal was one of Lady Verney's nephews. Eleanor, Lady Verney, in right of her cousinhood to the king, had a considerable position in the household of the queen, with whom she seems to have lived in familiar EARLY HISTORY OF THE VERNEYS, 1456-1599 45 intercourse ; she has a salary of 20/. a year, equal to more than 200/. now. An account of a year's ex- penses of the privy purse of Elizabeth of York exists, and during that time Lady Verney lends the queen ' fifteen shillings suddenly,' and is repaid ; again she supplies ' 3*. 4cd. as her Majesty's alms to a poor per- son,' the same to the ferryman at Datchet when the queen crossed the Thames, twice as much to 'an old servant of her Majesty's father,' and 17 s. on St. Peter's Eve, when there was always much jollification in the streets of London, bonfires, pageants, &c, indeed the city carnival was one of the sights of London ; 3*. 4d. to Robert Fyll, ' the king's painter,' and 10s. ' to John Reynolds,' another artist, for ' making of divers beasts and other pleasures for the Queen at Windsor,' shows that there was entertainment going on. Then comes 20c/. to a man who brought a present of cherries to her majesty, to ' Carvenelle for his costs, riding to the Princess [Catherine of Aragon], 56'.,' 'for making and lining a kirtle and other gear 2s. ,' 'an offering at the altar of St. Frideswyde at Oxford on the Queen's progress into Wales in the summer of 1502, 20d.' Another item, the keep of the horse of Margaret Yone, a servant of the queen's household apparently in attendance on Lady Verney, 4d. a day for 125 days, shows how all the ladies with their attendants went on horseback, as did the queen her- self on the ' summer progress,' and reads like a page out of the idyl ' Guinevere.' When the Princess Margaret, Henry VIII. 's 46 VERNE Y FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR sister, was betrothed to James IV. of Scotland, through whose blood the Stuarts claimed the throne of England, her chamberlain, Sir Ralph Verney, was present. In the following year he and his wife accompanied his mistress on her brilliant progress through England to join her husband, ' the dresses, the viands, the pageants, even the many kisses of the bridegroom to the impetuous bride — a true sister of Henry VIII. — are minutely chronicled by the English herald.' ' With the said Queen was deputed Sir Ralph Verney, her chamberlain, the which well and nobly exercised his office in the said voyage.' As Chief Commissioner appointed to look after Margaret's dowry he was present at a meeting of the Scottish Parliament, where King James's engagements were solemnly ratified. On his return Sir Ralph was appointed to the same post in the household of the king's other sister, the Princess Mary, and in 1514 was present at the high ceremonies of her betrothal to the aged King of France, Louis XIL, who died a few months after ; two of the other witnesses were Wolsey, not yet a cardinal, and Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, whom she married almost immediately after her return from France. The eldest son of Eleanor and Ralph soon after married Dorothy, a ward of the Duke of Suffolk. Meantime at Penley Sir John had been succeeded by his son the third Sir Ralph, who was sheriff for Bucks and Beds in 1511 and 1524. In 1525 he EARLY HISTORY OF THE VERNE YS, 1456-1599 47 was one of a goodly band of knights who attended Queen Catherine to the ' Field of the Cloth of Gold, having twelve men and horses eche in the Queen's Trayne, which consisted of 1,158 persons and 910 horses.' A bas-relief of the meeting of the two kings is still in existence, and shows the dress and appear- ance of the queen's knights. We hardly realise, when we speak of the Field of the Cloth of Gold, the enormous expense and difficulty there must have been in transporting such an immense crowd as attended the king and the queen — ' persons 5,696, horses 4,325 ' — but apparently it was done without any national or individual murmur. Sir Ralph was three times married ; his first wife, Margaret Iwardby, brought him the manor of Quain- ton, where she lies buried ; her brass, with the effigies of one son and three daughters, has been removed from its place near the altar in the old church, which has lately been cruelly defaced by a restoring, or rather destroying, rector. Ralph's second wife was Anne Weston ; she and her brother Richard were in the household of Elizabeth of York at the same time as Eleanor, Lady Verney. After the death of the queen she became maid-of-honour to Catherine of Aragon, who was already connected with Steeple Claydon, and when she married Sir Ralph Queen Catherine gave her a marriage portion of 200 marks and the custody of the lands and person of John Ganers, a minor, always a lucrative charge. The wardships of lunatics and minors were in the hands 48 VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL AVAR of the king, and the grievance was one against which the Commons complained ineffectually for the next hundred years. Sir Francis Weston, Lady Ver- ney's nephew, was afterwards beheaded for treason with Anne Boleyn in 1536. Sir Ralph was for the second time serving as sheriff for Bucks and Beds in 1525, when his death occurred very suddenly ; he made his will and died the same day. The list of his estates comprises seven manors in the county of Bucks, and many else- where. His children were all under age ; each daughter was to have 500 marks, but ' if anny of my foresaid daughters wolle not be advised nor ruled in the preferrement of hir manage, by my executours and supervisoures, it shall be at their liberty to mynishe parte of the somme bequethid until she wil be refourmed.' His third wife, Elizabeth Broughton, was to have all his moveable goods and a large join- ture ; his sons Francis and Rauffe take his ' manours and landes ' ; for the ' reparacion of the churche of Albury ' he gives 2>l. 6s. 8c/., and there is a curious bequest of the gowns of his second wife (and gowns were then magnificent garments, lasting more than one generation) ' to make vestiments [i.e. priests' robes] according to the discrecion of myn execu- tours. . . . Myn uncle Sir Raaf Verney thelder knight ' is to have ' my blacke gowne of satten, furrid with marternes ; ' while his cousin John is to have his ' gowne of tawny velvit, fore parte lincl with damaske.' The robe of a man of a certain age was a sort of EAKLY HISTORY OF THE VERNEYS, 1456-1599 49 dressing-gown at home, as distinguished from his armour and riding-gear when he went abroad. ' My cowsen Paule Darrell,' who is ' debutye and under- sherif,' is to have an annuity of 61. 13.?. 4d. for keep- ing the courts and receiving the rents of the testator. 1 Item, that Richard Verney my servaunte have the house and landehedwellith in during his life naturall, for keping of my woddes in Claydon ; . . . also that Richard Yerney's wife have a cowe. Also, that my servauntes have delivericl to theim every man his hole yeres wages. Also, that parte of them have certaine of my gildinges geven them at the discrecion of myne executours, and to each a blacke gowne.' As a sort of afterthought comes twenty shillings to ' Sir Thomas, Chauntry preest of Albery, to pray for my soule.' He has begun his will ' in the name of God, our blissid Lady, and all the holly company of heven : ' there is no trace as yet of the Reformation. His courtier uncle, who had been rewarded for his services to the late king and queen by a valuable manor given by Henry VIII., died soon after. He was buried at King's Langley in 1528, in a splendid altar-tomb with coats of arms of the Verneys and Poles, which also ornament the surcoat of the ' recum- bent figure of the knight and are reversed on the magnificent mantle of the lady.' This tomb has been lately torn from its place within the altar rails by an innovating clergyman. The fourth Sir Ralph, his son, was only fifteen when he inherited his father's large property ; he VOL. i. e 50 VERNEY FAMILY DURING THE CIVIL WAR married when he was nineteen, and took up his abode at Penley. Soon after we hear of a dispute concern- ing the estate at Claydon, with his tenant, Sir George Giffard. The house and church had been suffered to fall into ruinous decay, and Giffard at last agreed to pay 200 marks and to repair both, if Sir Ralph would renew his lease for 100 years instead of eighty, ' to which Yerney said he would not doe it for nothing.' So Giffard said he would give him a hunting-horse which he valued at 30/. (probably an exceedingly fine one, for the sum is now equivalent to 300/. or more), ' so Verney consented to it.' The church was repaired and the house rebuilt, ' but the Verneys paid dear for the hunter,' Lord Ferman"
