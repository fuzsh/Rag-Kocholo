Earl Verney, in the Province of Leinster, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. Sir Ralph Verney sat as a member of parliament for Aylesbury, for Great Bedwyn and for Buckingham. In 1661 he was created a Baronet, of Middle Claydon in the County of Buckingham, in the Baronetage of England. His son Sir John Verney, Bt, was a member of parliament for Buckinghamshire and for Amersham. In 1703, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Verney of Belturbet, in the County of Cavan, and Viscount Fermanagh. His son, the second Viscount, represented Amersham and Wendover in Parliament. In 1742 he was created Earl Verney, in the Province of Leinster, in the Peerage of Ireland. However, all titles became extinct on the death of his son, the second Earl, in 1791.

The Fermanagh title was revived in 1792 for Mary Verney, who was created Baroness Fermanagh in the Peerage of Ireland. She was the posthumous daughter of Hon. John Verney, second son of the first Earl Verney. However, Lady Fermanagh never married and on her death this title became extinct as well.

The original seat of Earl Verney was Claydon House near the villages of Botolph Claydon, Middle Claydon (hence the title), Steeple Claydon and East Claydon.
