        "text": "Sport for Jove’s Richard III play in Sydney returns after a hugely successful season in 2023. Seen through the eyes of Elizabeth I this production gives students an incredible insight into the play and when it was written.\n\nThis production is an essential tool for students to come to grips with this play’s innate theatricality and plethora of challenging characters when comparing it to Al Pacino’s Looking for Richard. Don’t let your students miss this opportunity to see and hear the play live.\n\nPeace at last in the land of the free!\n\nBut while a gruesome war has ended and the world dances, one dangerous mind is still in the trenches, his language weaponised and targeted on every point of weakness around him. He will take no prisoners on his rampage to the top.\n\nThe production includes a detailed 30-minute lecture on the play by director Damien Ryan and Q&A with the students to deepen their relationship to the work.\n\nImage credit: Kathy Luu\n\nTickets\n\n$33 per student. One teacher free per 10 students; $33 for each additional teacher.\n\nPayment\n\nFind out how our school bookings process works.
