        "text": "Philippa Langley MBE\n\nLed the Search for Richard III\n\nPhilippa Langley conceived, facilitated and commissioned the quest for King Richard III’s lost grave as part of her ongoing research into history’s most controversial monarch. Her Looking For Richard Project marked the first-ever search for the grave of an anointed King of England, and was made into the award-winning TV documentary The King in the Car Park for Channel 4. The documentary became Channel 4’s highest rated specialist factual show in its thirty year history garnering a combined audience of over 6 million.\n\nPhilippa is a writer, award-winning producer, and President of the Scottish Branch of the Richard III Society, receiving the Society’s highest accolade, the Robert Hamblin Award in 2012, for finding the remains of Richard III.\n\nIn 2013, she co-authored the best-selling history book The Lost King: The Search for Richard III (first published as The King’s Grave) with military historian Michael Jones. The Lost King tells the remarkable story of Philippa’s seven and a half year search for Richard III in alternating chapters with Mike Jones on the King’s life and times.\n\nIn 2014, she co-authored Finding Richard III: The Official Account an academic work that details the research behind her Looking For Richard Project that got her to the northern end of the Social Services car park in Leicester in search of the King’s grave. The book includes three chapters from Dr John Ashdown-Hill, a chapter from Dr David and Wendy Johnson and is edited by acclaimed historical biographer Annette Carson; all members of her Looking For Richard Project team. Also published for the first time within The Official Account are some of Philippa’s original materials including her agreements with the landowner and contractor.\n\nIn the spring of 2014, Philippa initiated and conceived the Hidden Abbey Project for the people and town of Reading. She now sits on its Steering Group, led by Reading Borough Council.\n\nIn 2015, she was awarded Membership of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE) by HM The Queen for services to the exhumation and identification of Richard III.\n\nIn 2016 Philippa launched The Missing Princes Project – a new research initiative that is using modern police investigative techniques to examine one of history’s most enduring mysteries – the disappearance of the sons of King Edward IV of England, the so-called ‘Princes in the Tower’.\n\nIn 2023, on the 10th anniversary of the identification of King Richard and the premiere of King in the Car Park, Philippa is publishing her much anticipated new work: The Princes in the Tower: Solving History’s Greatest Cold Case. A feature length Channel 4 Specialist Factual TV documentary will accompany the book to reveal the remarkable discoveries made by The Missing Princes Project.\n\nIn October 2022, the acclaimed cinematic feature film, The Lost King, celebrated its premiere, Directed by the multi award winning Sir Stephen Frears and written by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope (Philomena, 2013) it tells the story of Philippa’s search for the lost grave of King Richard III. Double Oscar-nominated actor Sally Hawkins portrays Philippa in the leading role.\n\nTo find out more about Philippa’s work, please visit:\n\nhttp://www.philippalangley.co.uk\n\nhttp://www.revealingrichardiii.com/langley.html\n\nDr John Ashdown-Hill\n\nJohn was a historian and author, and for many years was a member of the Richard III Society Executive Committee. He also discovered the mtDNA sequence of King Richard III. John published several books on medieval history and numerous research articles. Most contained new evidence or new interpretations. A book on Cecily Neville was published in 2018 and a book on The Mythology of the ‘Princes in the Tower’ was published in July 2018, with Elizabeth Widville, Lady Grey published in 2019. His first degree was joint, in languages and history, so for many years John taught languages in the UK and abroad, including latterly at a university in Turkey, and his role as a linguist helped him to discover or correct evidence in respect of Richard III. He was an Hon. Senior Lecturer of the History Department of the University of Essex (which also awarded him an honorary second doctorate for his role in finding Richard III). The Richard III archaeological project in Leicester was partly inspired by original research relating to King Richard III’s burial published in his book The Last Days of Richard III and also by his remarkable discovery of King Richard’s mtDNA sequence. John died in May 2018."
