Salome and Wilde Salome are a big deal here and The Local Stigmatic on the big screen would be something to see.\n\nCovers his whole career and Cruising is included (!) and so is Revolution (?!?) but not Phil Spector, Angels in America, Godfather Part III or Danny Collins...............hmmmmm\n\nquadcinema.com/program/pacinos-way/\n\nPost by Viced on\n\nVery interesting...\n\nIs it just me or does it not say which ones Pacino will be in attendance for?\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nI think for now he's only confirmed for Salome/Wilde Salome (if you click on the titles they list him) and they either will update the website link or send out Twitter updates for when he will make a couple of other appearances.\n\nPost by Viced on\n\nI wish this was more convenient for me. -_-\n\nSeeing Carlito's Way and Heat back to back on the big screen on the 22nd would be legendary.\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nMost of the screenings will be presented in 35mm! Very cool. I'm away most of the month unfortunately; but will definitely try to see Dog Day and Sea of Love and Wilde Salome....\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nWherever I go I'm always packing Red Vines anyway..........the most Pacinoesque of all the snack foods.......don't get high on your own supply............\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nNice career overview that runs parallel to the festival.\n\nOnly Pacino could get a career overview that's (mostly) positive and have no mention of his best performance of the 80s (Local Stigmatic), 00s (Angels in America), his best recent performance (Phil Spector) and among some others not mentioned at all : Merchant of Venice, And Justice For All, Carlito's Way, Scent of a Woman, Donnie Brasco - because nobody ever sees the same Pacino ......\n\nwww.slantmagazine.com/features/article/pacinos-way\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nFrom today's NY Times - regarding his appearances:\n\nThe survey also leads up to the U.S. premieres on March 30 of “Wilde Salomé,” his 2011 documentary exploration of the Oscar Wilde play; and “Salomé,” his 2013 dramatic companion piece, both starring Jessica Chastain.\n\nMr. Pacino will be on hand at Q & As following a sneak peek of those films on March 28, as well “Sea of Love” and “Revolution” on March 29\n\nPost by Viced on\n\nListening to Mamet on the WTF podcast... he says Pacino called him up a year ago to adapt the Chayefsky play Middle of the Night for the screen. Mamet wrote it and is hoping it’ll happen.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nMan, that is a real wtf story. It's not a real contemporary piece but the film version (Frederic March-Kim Novak) is quite good but - Al is too old, you can't be 80 and playing that part Al, come on!!\n\nPost by Viced on\n\nMan, that is a real wtf story. It's not a real contemporary piece but the film version (Frederic March-Kim Novak) is quite good but - Al is too old, you can't be 80 and playing that part Al, come on!!\n\nMaybe he wants to direct it? I don't know.... Mamet didn't go into it too much outside of saying he \"made it better\" and something about Pacino having the rights to it.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nThat was a priceless interview btw - sort of dissing O'Neill, sort of praising Odets, totally dissing the rehearsal process (Actors take 5 weeks pretending they don't know the play and the playwright pretends he does....), and the most succinct summing up of Kennedy and not remotely talking politics either \"won a Pulitzer Prize for a book he didn't write, f'ing a Russian spy, f'ing the girlfriend of the head of the mafia .......lol\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nWas not expecting to hear Mamet do a Daffy Duck impression.\n\nPremise iffy - maybe Al relates bc of Lucila Scola? - but I mean there’s gotta be a better Chayefsky role for him, no....?\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nYet another interesting article and it's no coincidence that I don't agree with this one either at all about Cruising or Donnie Brasco (how is that \"underrated\" now? Oh no Oscar nod, right......come on) or how much this writer values \"subtle\" (UGH)......but this goes back to an argument I always make - nobody sees the same Pacino - this article, the Village Voice one, the Slant one all are more less talking about his greatness in entirely different ways and entering their own evidence...........in this era of BS consensus building where we are all supposed to see things \"the same\" way, his very career is a glorious testament to weirdness, uniqueness, contradiction.\n\nwww.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/03/the-many-eras-of-al-pacinos-stardom/556406/\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nThis is a good one, talking about Salome/Wilde Salome, and pretty lucid and interesting. I don't know if he's touched on this in these in person appearances, but this one, with fellow actor Stephen Fry is basically a good summation for all of us who didn't get to go.\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nwww.interviewmagazine.com/film/jessica-chastain-christopher-nolan-al-pacino-retrospective\n\nChastain, Christopher Nolan, Mike Newell, Michael Radford each briefly interview Pacino.\n\nwww.vulture.com/2018/03/every-al-pacino-movie-ranked-from-worst-to-best.html\n\nVulture ranking all his perfs, but leaving off his great TV work for some reason. Mostly a wonky list with infuriating writeups on the films. They rank Revolution and Author Author above fairly better perfs in Manglehorn, People I Know, etc. Only interesting ranking is how highly they put The Insider, where Pacino is indeed underrated.\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nSeveral new articles and essays on Pacino coming at us daily. You gotta love it, especially for us fans.\n\nNYT review of Wilde Salome / Salome ....\n\nwww.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/movies/wilde-salome-review-al-pacino.html\n\nAlso....Leo showed up to the double-bill last night in NYC.\n\nPost by Viced on\n\nAlso....Leo showed up to the double-bill last night in NYC.\n\nPacino officially confirmed for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nThe only world where Revolution and (especially) Author Author are better performances than Manglehorn and People I Know is some awful bizarro world where pacinoyes is clearly not being consulted for his opinion by the people at Vulture.\n\nWhatever!!\n\nSide note: I would stab myself in the neck with a plastic fork to hear what Al and DiCaprio talk about.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nThe two Salome films will be streaming next week for those interested - I guess you can see them as part of the free trial(?) -\n\nI assume a US dvd release will happen down the road but ya never know exactly when with him and these plays into film things he does.\n\nwww.broadwayworld.com/article/SALOME-Starring-Al-Pacino-and-Jessica-Chastain-Will-Stream-on-BroadwayHD-20180425"
