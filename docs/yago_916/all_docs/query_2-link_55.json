        "text": "Born April 25, 1940 in New York City, New York. Hailed as one of the greatest screen actors of all time, the diminutive but fiery Pacino first gained acclaim on the New York stage - earning both a Tony and an Obie award - before he made his film debut with 1969's Me, Natalie.\n\nAfter his acclaimed performance in 1971's Panic in Needle Park, Pacino was cast in the role that would define his career, that of the brooding, tragic Mafia heir Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. The 1972 film, which starred Marlon Brando as Michael's father Don Vito Corleone, made Pacino a star and earned him his first Oscar nomination (as Best Supporting Actor).\n\nPacino would reprise his role for The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990). In addition to The Godfather and its sequel, the 1970s saw Pacino star in several modern classics: Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and Scarecrow. Pacino then endured a string of flops, including Bobby Deerfield and Cruising, but his iconic turn as gangster Tony Montana in Brian De Palma's ultra-violent 1983 remake of Scarface has become as prominent in pop culture as his Godfather role.\n\nAfter starring in the 1985 bomb Revolution, Pacino retreated from Hollywood for four years before returning in the hit thriller Sea of Love. The 1990s saw Pacino regain his footing with films such as Glengarry Glen Ross, Dick Tracy, Heat, Donnie Brasco, The Insider and Any Given Sunday. And after seven Oscar nominations, Pacino finally won the Academy Award as Best Actor for 1992's Scent of a Woman."
