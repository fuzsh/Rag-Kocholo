        "text": "Al Pacino, who is 56 and has been a movie star for a quarter century, has a favorite story about acting. It took place in 1972, the year he'd come to stardom as Michael Corleone in ''The Godfather,'' and he was performing in a Boston production of David Rabe's ''Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel.''\n\n''One night during a performance I found myself relating to a pair of eyes in the audience,'' Mr. Pacino recalled. ''Which was something unusual for me. I'd heard other actors talk about it, but I'd never done that. And I found I was gearing my performance to that section of the audience. By the time the curtain call came, I had to see, I had to find out who it was. And sitting there, of course, was a seeing eye dog.''\n\nOf course? The story, which caused Mr. Pacino to erupt in gravelly laughter, is emblematic of what even his friends call his quixotic sensibility: the anecdote is poignant, provocative, a little eerie, but has no clear point. Mr. Pacino acknowledged as much.\n\n''As Kipling says, 'I learned about women from her,' '' he said, though like Kipling's, his lesson was ambiguous. ''I learned something that day. There's something there, but you can't put your finger on it.''\n\nIt is his perennial posture: slouching toward discovery, something more easily associated with stage actors wrestling with roles than with film stars. And Mr. Pacino is lately reminding Broadway theatergoers of his prowess, in Eugene O'Neill's ''Hughie'' at Circle in the Square. But for those who have seen him only on screen, the side of Mr. Pacino that is uncertain, process-oriented and comfortable with ambiguity may not be apparent.\n\nBesides Michael Corleone, his best-known film characters have all been men of clear motivation -- among them Frank Serpico, the idealistic New York City cop who turned on his fellow officers in exposing police department corruption, in the 1973 film ''Serpico''; Sonny, the bisexual bank robber exposed to the glare of the news media as he holds hostages in ''Dog Day Afternoon'' (1975), and Lieut. Col. Frank Slade, the blind ex-military man in ''Scent of a Woman'' (1992), for which Mr. Pacino won an Oscar. Their images, fixed on celluloid, have left the impression of a forceful, cogent actor.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
