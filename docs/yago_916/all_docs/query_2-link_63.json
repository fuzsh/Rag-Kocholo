        "text": "Tribeca's Oxford Shakespeare Company (OSC) has named Pacino the first recipient of its Oxford Prize \"in honor of the actor's outstanding artistic achievements in bringing Shakespeare to the public,\" according to press notes.\n\nThe award, which will be presented to Pacino later this summer, also consists of a scholarship named in the recipient's honor, which is given to a promising actor at the OSC's theatre school, allowing the student to attend classes and production workshops at no cost. The Al Pacino Scholarship honoree is Frank Franconeri.\n\nPacino's Shakespeare credits include a recent film version of Merchant; Looking for Richard, the semi-documentary meditation on Richard III in which he appeared and directed; and a Broadway production of Richard III. Other stage credits include a staged reading of Salome, The Resistable Rise of Arturo Ui, The Indian Wants the Bronx (Obie Award), American Buffalo, The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel (Tony Award) and Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie? (Tony Award). Screen credits include \"You Don't Know Jack,\" \"Angels in America\" (Emmy Award), \"Scent of a Woman\" (Academy Award), \"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" \"Scarface,\" \"Dog Day Afternoon\" and \"The Godfather\" films, among many others."
