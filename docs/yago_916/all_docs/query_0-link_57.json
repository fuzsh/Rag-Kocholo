        "text": "The film then shows Pacino and the author Fredric Kimball interviewing people in New York about Shakespeare. Most have nothing to say. One man replies ‘Shakespeare? What the fuck do you know about Shakespeare?’ which is ironically the exact question the film is seeking to answer.\n\nKenneth Branagh is then shown, reflecting on what it was like to learn Shakespeare at school. He says it was uninteresting and boring: ‘it made no real sense because there was no real connection made.’ He continues to say ‘by taking this one play, King Richard III, we could communicate our passion for it.’ In doing so, he articulates the film’s purpose: to highlight to audiences the reasons for Shakespeare’s enduring relevance.\n\nWe then see Pacino lament ‘I don’t know why we even bother doing this at all. But we’ll give it a little try.’ He then provides some historical background for the play, while the scholar Barbara Everett explains the significance of Richard’s physical deformity. This sequence emphasises the importance of approaching Shakespeare’s work with an academic background.\n\nPacino is then shown performing his speech, and we get the impression that he did it perfectly.\n\nThe film returns to exploring the idea that Americans in particular are hesitant to engage with Shakespeare’s works. But, this is contrasted with Pacino and Kevin Kline explaining the nature of the play in colloquial terms, reflecting how accessible it can be.\n\nWhat follows is a brief exploration of the power of language to communicate truths and feelings: Vanessa Redgrave claims that for centuries, words have been ‘divorced from truth.’ The man with one tooth states that we would ‘say less and mean more’ if only we expressed our emotions more honestly.\n\nPacino and Kimball go to Shakespeare’s home in Stratford. Pacino claims he had an ‘inner’ epiphany, but it is mostly left to the audience to gauge whether the experience had any spiritual or creative impact on either man.\n\nPacino requests that a young actress who is capable of doing Shakespeare plays Lady Anne: they get Winona Ryder to fill the role. Kimball is furious that Pacino has been talking to scholars about Shakespeare, believing that it betrays the film’s purpose."
