        "text": "Richard\n\nby Dame Carol Ann Duffy\n\nThe Poet Laureateâs eulogy, written for Richard IIIâs re-interment on 26 March 2015, was read by Benedict Cumberbatch and dedicated that evening to Philippa Langley by Leicester Cathedral who commissioned it. It was perhaps an olive branch at the end of a gruelling two year battle fought behind the scenes with the cathedral and university authorities to see the medieval king honoured in the way that had been planned and agreed from the start. On Saturday 22 August 2015, at the 530th anniversary of the Battle of Bosworth, Philippa read the poem at the service of remembrance to all those fallen in battle.\n\nRichard\n\nMy bones, scripted in light, upon cold soil,\n\na human braille. My skull, scarred by a crown,\n\nemptied of history. Describe my soul\n\nas incense, votive, vanishing; your own\n\nthe same. Grant me the carving of my name.\n\nThese relics, bless. Imagine you re-tie\n\na broken string and on it thread a cross,\n\nthe symbol severed from me when I died.\n\nThe end of time â an unknown, unfelt loss â\n\nunless the Resurrection of the Dead...\n\nor I once dreamed of this, your future breath\n\nin prayer for me, lost long, forever found;\n\nor sensed you from the backstage of my death,\n\nas kings glimpse shadows on a battleground.\n\nPhilippa's Research\n\nAs part of the 2022 ten-year anniversary of the discovery of Richard III on 25 August 2012, Philippa has published her research work. Her papers cover a period of seven years from 2004/5 to 2011. We hope you enjoy seeing Philippaâs journey that got her to the northern end of the Social Services car park in Leicester where the king was found. This takes Philippa's journey to her final research with the Ground Penetrating Radar survey on 28 August 2011 prior to the dig getting underway.\n\nPhilippa's research was first published in 2014 in Finding Richard III: The Official Account of Research by the Retrieval and Reburial Project. For more information, please see here.\n\nPhilippa will publish more research papers and documents shortly.\n\nPhilippa's Agreements\n\nTo commemorate the tenth anniversary in 2022 of the discovery of Richard III on 25 August 2012, Philippa has published the agreements which preceded the commencement of her archaeological search. Philippa applied for, and was granted, three permissions by the landowner, Leicester City Council. These included authorization to commission and fund a 2-week dig (plus 1-week of restitution work). The kingâs remains were uncovered on day 1 of the dig and exhumed on day 12, in the precise location indentified by Philippaâs research (and intuition). As the projectâs client, Philippa also instructed exhumation of the remains (at the northern end of the Social Services car park) with the last of the funding raised by her International Appeal to the members of the Richard III Society. This eleventh-hour intervention not only averted cancellation of Philippa's 2-week dig, but also established the Society members as her principal funding body, providing 53% of the required finance.\n\nPhilippa's story is fully documented in The Lost King: The Search for Richard III (first published as The King's Grave: The Search for Richard III, 2013) and in Finding Richard III: The Official Account of Research by the Retrieval and Reburial Project, 2014. Her instruction to exhume the remains in Trench One is recorded in both accounts (p.100 & p.54 respectively). In 2014 Philippa was informed by Leicester City Council that her story in the soon to be opened Richard III Visitor Centre had been rewritten by Leicester University. This was undertaken without her knowledge or consent. As a result, Philippa had no alternative but to seek legal representation. Immediately prior to the kingâs reinterment week in March 2015, Philippaâs story was reinstated. This included her instruction for exhumation and payment of the last of her funding from the Ricardian International Appeal.\n\nFinancing the Dig\n\nAs the 25th August 2022 marks the tenth anniversary of the discovery of Richard III, Philippa has published a breakdown of the financial contributions raised to pay for the archaeological search which discovered the king. As the projectâs client (see Agreements above), Philippa was responsible for securing the funding that enabled the 2-week dig (with one week restitution work) to go ahead. The landowner, Leicester City Council, Philippaâs Lead Partner in the search for Richard III, underwrote the 2-week dig with a Â£5,000 contingency budget (please see below):\n\nFunding (in order of contribution):\n\nRichard III Society and members17,367(52.84%)*\n\nLeicester University10,000(30.43%)\n\nLeicestershire Promotions Ltd5,000(15.21%)\n\nLeicester Adult Schools500(1.52%)\n\nTotal:Â£32,867(100%)**\n\n*Plus a further payment to ULAS of Â£716 to cover costs including exhumation of Richard IIIâs mortal remains (total: Â£18,083)\n\n**Leicester City Council - Â£5,000 contingency\n\nFollowing the discovery and exhumation of the king (which took place on day 1 and 12 respectively, as above), the dig was extended into a third week, utilising the city councilâs Â£5,000 contingency budget. Leicester University then stepped in to underwrite the third week of digging work. Following discovery the university funded post excavation costs, including the scientific identification of King Richardâs remains. For Philippaâs pre-dig commissions and funding (Desk-Based Assessment, Â£1,140; Ground Penetrating Radar Survey, Â£5,043), see Finding Richard III: The Official Account (2014), pp.44, 46-48, 52.\n\nLeicestershire Promotions was the first party to 100% finance Philippaâs 2-week dig. When this funding was withdrawn, the first person to make a financial contribution to the project was Dr Phil Stone, former Chairman of the Richard III Society. Phil generously donated Â£5,000 of his own money. For more on the project and its funding, see above and here. For Philippaâs receipts, see here. For original costings see here. Costings would eventually be reduced to Â£32,867 following minor adjustment of trenches to allow for additional parking and removal of coffin and pall costs.\n\nThe universityâs costs can be viewed here. Please note: the university conflates all costings and is incorrect in its assertion that they were the first to contribute funding and underwrite the dig project that discovered the king.\n\nDr John Ashdown-Hill self-funded his research and discovery of King Richardâs mtDNA sequence (published 2005). This original research work amounted to over Â£3,000.\n\nFor full funding including Langleyâs costs from 2010-12 (comprising research and development, travel, accommodation, rights and permissions) see FAQs here.\n\nYou can discover more about Philippaâs incredible story and 8-year journey to find the king in: The Lost King: The Search for Richard III (2013) and Finding Richard III: The Official Account of Research by the Retrieval and Reburial Project (2014). See here\n\nMemorandum of Understanding\n\nMemorandum of Agreement regarding the use of images of King Richardâs remains - 28 September 2016\n\nA Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement with the University of Leicester regarding the appropriate use of the images of King Richardâs remains has been obtained. This came about because of the concern expressed following the discovery of a University tee shirt with a photograph of the kingâs skull and, following this, the graphic artwork by Alexander de Cadenet, using a radiograph, or x-ray image, of the same.\n\nFollowing a meeting with the University on 29th July to discuss the use of images, Philippa and I are pleased to announce that the MoU between our two organisations has now been signed and is published here. Publication of the agreement is so that all observers, as well as those who supported Philippaâs Looking For Richard Project with funding and everyone who bought into the âdignity and honourâ ethos that governed our whole project, can see that not only do we have this agreement in perpetuity, but that nothing is hidden.\n\nYou will see that the University maintains its right to use the images of the kingâs remains for the purposes of âresearch, education, learning and teachingâ. It also maintains its right as the copyright holder of the images to have the final say on any future use. The agreement does not stop the University from allowing the use of images but if they dishonour the spirit of the agreement in the future, the Society, and the public, will be able to hold them to account for it.\n\nIn securing this agreement, Philippa has fought a long battle, with my full support, to achieve this result. It is a great achievement and we believe, moreover, a moral victory. The Universityâs stance had been that Philippa had no agreements or understandings with them but Point 9 of the MoU now reflects the actual position for the first time. Philippa has confirmed that the signing of the agreement marks the end for her of a long and difficult journey in Leicester to honour Richard in the way that had been planned and agreed from the start. In seeing the Societyâs signature in perpetuity upon the agreement, she is now able to draw a line in the sand. She is, as she put it,âfinally freeâ.\n\nDr Phil Stone (1946-2020)\n\nChairman\n\nRichard III Society\n\nRead the Memorandum of Understanding\n\nYou can also view the Statement and Memorandum of Understanding here on the home page of the Richard III Society.\n\nAll images Â© Colin G.
