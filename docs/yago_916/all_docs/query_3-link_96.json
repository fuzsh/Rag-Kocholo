        "text": "American President, The\n\nIt's hard to believe that The American President was made by the same man responsible for the no-holds-barred satire of This Is Spinal Tap. Is there any element of American culture more ripe for the humorist's razor-sharp wit than presidential pol...\n\nAstronaut\n\nWhen we last saw Richard Dreyfuss gazing skyward, he was about to have a close encounter of the third kind. Now, some four-plus decades later, the still-working actor is again looking up, although this time the reasons are less extraterrestria...\n\nBook Club\n\nA romantic comedy – any romantic comedy regardless of the ages, genders, or races of the participants – has two primary goals: generate laughter and give viewers at least a moment of smile-inducing giddiness. It’s all about being uplifti...\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nIn late 1977, everyone seemed to believe this. Although UFOs have been a popular subject for speculation, rumination, and investigation for more than 50 years, at no time was the phenomenon more popular than during the 1970s. Along with the Loch ...\n\nJames and the Giant Peach\n\nAlmost everything that was true of 1993's Nightmare Before Christmas holds for 1996's James and the Giant Peach.

Now, with Mr. Holland's Opus, another Capra-esque motion picture has ...\n\nMy Life in Ruins\n\nWords cannot express how weary I am of watching lifeless, hollow movies like My Life in Ruins - generic romantic comedies that have no clue when it comes to either \"romance\" or \"comedy.\" The films aren't quite poorly enough made to label them \"bad...\n\nNight Falls on Manhattan\n\nInto the calm before the box-office storm of The Lost World rises Night Falls on Manhattan, Sidney Lumet's triumphant return to worthwhile movie-making. The director of such memorable films as Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and Network has been in a ...\n\nParanoia\n\nI've seen movies like this more often than I'd like to admit: glitzy thrillers with less intelligence than a smart rutabaga where big-name actors pick up a paycheck while trying with limited success not to embarrass themselves and the studio keeps ..."
