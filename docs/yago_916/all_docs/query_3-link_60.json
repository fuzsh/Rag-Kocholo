In Shakespeare’s text, Richard challenges the dominant notion of providence with the emerging concept of free will. Pacino mirrors this in his text with the more contextually relevant idea of usurping the British claim over the cultural hegemony of Shakespeare.\n\nShakespeare’s text\n\nThere are many ways you may have seen this concept framed. Some say determinism and humanism, others say fate and free will. Whatever you call it, it is clear that Shakespeare was addressing contextual tensions relevant to his audience. In the Elizabethan era, the belief in providence, determinism, or the will of God, had been the dominant discourse for as long as anyone could remember. This is where things such as the Levitical doctrine come in. However, Richard does not merely sit by and let people tell him that because he is deformed that he will be this foul creature as expected. Instead, Richard is “determined to prove a villain”. The opening soliloquy begins decisively in an inverted rhythm, the troche placed on “now” in the iambic “now is the winter of our discontent”. This authority demands the audience’s attention and allows Richard to challenge the contextual tension between free will and providentialism. This is the first glimpse we get into the tension between the discourses and the fact that Richard wishes to assert his authority over his own life and subsequently over the audience’s belief in determinism. This leaves the audience with the question, are Richard’s actions truly independent or are they part of some greater course that has already been determined? More specifically, are his actions by his own free will, or is that simply a mask covering the reality of fatalism?\n\nPacino’s text\n\nLooking for Richard resonates this idea of challenging prominent discourses through his own usurping of British hegemony over Shakespearean literature. The British hegemony can be\n\ndeterminism and fatalism that we discussed before go hand in hand with ontological questioning. As for the idea of British hegemony, not so much. Shakespeare’s text offers a complexity of ontological conversations through presenting original religious motifs. This is a lot of information to wrap your head around so once we have looked widely at how Pacino’s addresses this theme, let’s break this down into the main ideas Shakespeare addresses and how Pacino subverts theme. These include morality, punishment, and control.\n\nHowever, despite first appearances, Pacino does his best to show that, even though there is no longer a need for ontological debate, this can be substituted with other similar ideas more relevant to his context. This will be shown through his portrayal of the Ghost scene and characterisation of Fredric Kimble.\n\nOverview of Pacino’s take on ontology\n\nIn Pacino’s post-modern, secular context the ultimate consequence of the damnation of Richard’s soul is not applicable, and thus there is a clash in ontological exploration, leaving the character explored in Looking for Richard to seem somewhat more hollow. We also know that Pacino’s purpose is to make the text more accessible. These complex notions of morality can be seen to keep American audiences away from Shakespeare as it is too hard to understand. Therefore, due to the change in context the ontological conversations within Richard III become obsolete. This makes Richards relentless pursuit of power, previously examined at a cost, hollow due to the morally uncertain post-modernist view. Pacino examines the consequence of Richards actions being psychological fragmentation rather than damnation of his soul. Catholic ideology that “God will revenge” Richards actions clash with Pacino’s reframing of Shakespeare’s play. Pacino is therefore able to reposition the modern audience to sympathise with Richard more so than Shakespeare. Pacino’s conversation offers new insight into the moral relativism by conveying contemporary ambiguity between the boundaries of performance and reality. Pacino also demonstrates duplicity in his character through the heavily constructed and edited nature of the cinema verité film as well as his method acting encroaching on his purpose in constructing the docu-drama. Thus, Pacino’s reconceptualization deepens the understanding of Richard’s duplicate identity whilst subverting it from original contextual influences, interplaying philosophical conversations with the original text.\n\nMorality or lack thereof\n\nShakespeare inadvertently looks at morality in depth. However, this is done through the contextual lens of religion. Shakespeare develops a complex, multifaceted character enabling him to explore current ideologies about morality and engage in ontological conversations within the text about the damnation of the soul. Pacino reduction in the complexity of Shakespeare’s original text eliminating aspects no longer relevant to his context. This makes the audience reconsider what influenced Shakespeare's view of morality. Was Shakespeare’s understanding of morality, good and evil purely a religious bias? In the 20th century are these ideas of good and evil still relevant within the secular framework of our society? Thus, Pacino’s conversation offers new insight into moral relativism by conveying contemporary ambiguity surrounding the role of religion in moral standards.\n\nPunishment\n\nFor Shakespeare’s Richard there is an extreme price to pay for his actions, he will face damnation of the soul by God. Shakespeare establishes a duplicity of Richards character to explore concerns of morality and the consequences for a relentless pursuit of power. Looking\n\nfor Richard resonates the characterisation of Richard but exclusively explores his phycology, rather than the expected punishment that comes from religious beliefs. Pacino enriches the understanding of the villainous, vice character displayed in Richard III. However, due to the post-modern, secular context the ultimate consequence of the damnation of Richard’s soul is not applicable, and thus there is a clash in ontological exploration, leaving the character explored in Looking for Richard to seem somewhat more hollow\n\nControl\n\nAs mentioned in the dominant discourse section, the Levitical doctrine means that, due to Richard’s physiognomy, it was inevitable he would be villainous. This instigates an internal ontological conversation about human authority over morals. When it came down to it, despite his attempts to appear authoritative, was Richard able to control his actions? This adds a level of complexity and depth to the exploration of his character.\n\nHowever, Pacino conveys Richard’s physical deformities in stark contrast. Whilst Shakespeare’s Richard had a hunch back (and yes in some scenes so does Pacino’s), Pacino’s Richard has an American accent, baseball cap and generally unkempt appearance. These superficial ‘deformities’ lean into Pacino’s challenge of dominant discourse but ultimately cause a reduction in their symbolic importance. This demonstrates Pacino’s disbelief in the relevance of these outdated concept of determinism and rather the modern cultural connotations of nationality.\n\nThe Ghost Scene\n\nPacino focuses on this scene to show Richard’s psyche rather than the religious idea of damnation of the soul and the divine right of kings like Shakespeare did. The scholar asserts that “the battle goes for very little ... the battle is really the ghost scene”. What’s interesting about this is that in Pacino’s rendition to follow, he does the exact opposite. He cuts a large portion of the dialogue from the ghost scene out and extends the fighting in the battle. Richard’s dilemma of conscience is taken upon by Pacino in such a way that has nothing to do with God’s punishment, but rather his own psychological paranoia. We see this through the cuts of identically played out scenes, one with Pacino in 20th century clothes being himself, the actor, and one of him as Richard in full costume. This display inner turmoil is a very long scene in the original play however, Pacino chose to convey this with a montage of quick cut scenes instead, not dwelling on detail. Pacino’s audience is used to fast paced pop culture and so instead of focusing on hard to understand, complex dialogue which revolves around religious punishment, he uses film techniques to pique their interest. An example of this is the use of close-up shots to create climatic tension. Shakespearean audiences traditionally knew this as the ghost scene, but Pacino calls them dreams. This further reflects the elimination of religious ideals. However, Pacino’s rendition of this scene still shows that Richard’s conscience is plagued, just as Shakespeare intended, demonstrating its timeless nature.\n\nSuperficiality of Religion\n\nDespite all this, whilst we know Shakespeare is contemplating the role of religion in his text, the character of Richard himself only mentions religion in superficial ways for his own benefit in winning over the audience. We see Pacino mirror this idea through his characterisation of Kimble.\n\nReligion is something clearly prevalent to Shakespeare’s audience, and Richard knows this. In Act 3, Scene 7 Richard wants to win the people, therefore Catesby and Buckingham\n\nduplicitous identity as both actor and director. Duplicity can also be seen through the heavily constructed and edited nature of the cinema verité film as well as his method acting encroaching on his purpose in constructing the docu-drama. Pacino uses form to present staged situations in a spontaneous manner, showing duplicity in what the audience believes is real. In the 7 minute scene about Lady Anne, there are 98 cuts between clips. This scene is a great example of the heavily constructed pastiche. Staging of documentary clips can be seen when, Michael Hadge, Pacino’s co-producer, appears to be discussing logistics of the film with Pacino. Although these clips appear in the documentary style, they are scripted and included for a purpose. Hadge makes colloquial, flippant comments such as “We’re never gonna finish this movie” and “How much more are we gonna shoot?” to make the film seem organic and disguise the agenda Pacino truly has.\n\nPacino is also duplicitous in the way he presents Shakespeare’s text, the audience believes it is the original and correct text, however there are many times where Pacino inserts or removes lines to meet his agenda. For example, In Act 5, Scene 3 Shakespeare’s text has Catesby delivering dialogue, however Pacino substitutes him for Ratcliff, by ‘accident’. This demonstrates that he can change the text and people will just assume he is telling the truth. Most people wouldn’t have checked or even noticed this substitution because they believe in his self-asserted authority. Another example is at the beginning of the Lady Anne scene Pacino includes Act 1, Scene 2, Line 217. Obviously, this comes at the end of Act 1, Scene 2 however he places it first and the audience is not supposed to know that he has edited Shakespeare’s work like this. This demonstrates Pacino to exercise his power in shaping the audience’s perception of Shakespeare’s work.\n\nPerformance and Theatricality\n\nThe motif of theatricality and role playing is common to both texts and utilised to explore themes of duplicity. The motif of performance and theatricality is maintained by Pacino to explore the timeless gap between appearance and reality. Similarly, to Shakespeare, Pacino is fascinated by the many masks we wear and the multifaceted nature of existence. Actor and role merge in Looking for Richard, highlighting that we are all actors. The duplicitous identities shaped in both Richard III and Looking for Richard reflect how performance is utilised as a weapon in the relentless pursuit of power. Shakespeare opens Richard III in soliloquy, fostering complicity with the audience. This allows us to firstly understand that a lot of how he presents himself to other characters in the play is a performance, and secondly to understand why he performs. As already explained, the Levitical doctrine means that Richard has to act like someone he isn’t to go against preconceived notions of who he will me. In his performance, Richard heavily manipulates language such as the use of homophony in the “son of York” and double entendre such as “My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart”. This word play emphasises how language can be used as a theatrical weapon so to speak. Similarly, Pacino utilises the heavily constructed cinema verte form to present staged situations in a spontaneous manner. His unprompted documentary style clips such as “who’s gonna say action around here” layered with a dazzling mosaic of comic documentary and dramatic performance resonates Shakespeare’s manipulation of language. Pacino layers further complexity upon Shakespeare’s representation of Richard in utilising post-modern techniques, such as directing the camera to show Richard’s face in half light and half dark, to symbolise dual identity. This aligns with Shakespeare’s emphasises on performance as Richards seductive rhetoric is established as his most valuable asset. The value of controlling language and thus performing a role is emphasised in Richard’s demise. The degradation of language is highlighted in a metaphoric decent in bestial imagery from “tiger” to “toad” and finally a “foul lump of matter”. In Richard’s final soliloquy the uncertainty in questioning “Is\n\nthere a murderer here? No, Yes I am” demonstrates the disintegration of control over his performance. Pacino mirrors this through the utilisation of method acting in his monosyllabic exclamation of “I want to be king already” and accosting crew members, highlighting his loss of control. Both Shakespeare and Pacino fashion beguiling texts to demonstrate the complex nature of identity which is shaped by performance in the pursuit of power.\n\nEgocentricity\n\nYet, through Pacino’s egocentric construction, Looking for Richard simplifies Shakespeare’s text and marginalises characters which reflect a depth of motivation and success in Richard’s deceit. Through this striping of Shakespeare’s text of character’s which illuminate Richard’s identity and performance, Pacino presents a nuanced version of morality in the 20th century. Pacino exclusively explores Richard’s phycology and enriching the understanding of the villainous, vice character displayed in Richard III.\n\nHow Pacino looks for Richard\n\nIn Looking for Richard, Pacino narrows focus onto the central character, Richard, to explore in further depth the multidimensional, villainous character developed in Richard III, without focusing on complex relationships and historical context. Pacino’s hemogenic American milieu establishes his purposes in making Shakespeare accessible to an American viewer. Thus, in the docu-drama form, he aims to eliminate the convoluted familial relationships and historical allusions which he believes makes Shakespeare’s play “hard play to get.” Pacino utilises colloquial rhetoric to appeal to the audience in asking “We need relationships between all those characters. Who can keep it straight?”. Pacino claims he is “confused just saying it” and therefore his focus narrows to, as the title suggests, explore Richard’s characterisation. Pacino summarises his preface of the play to the phrase “I’m not the king and I want to be! It’s that simple!” providing a clear foundation in which a new understanding of Richards characterisation will be built. Pacino repositions the modern audience to sympathise with Richard more so than Shakespeare as Pacino aligns himself with Richard’s character. Thus, Pacino’s reconceptualization deepens the understanding of Richard’s duplicate identity whilst subverting it from original contextual influences, interplaying philosophical conversations with the original text.\n\nMarginalisation of other Characters\n\nThrough Pacino’s egocentric construction, Looking for Richard simplifies Shakespeare’s text and marginalises characters which reflect a depth of motivation and success in Richard’s deceit. For Shakespeare, Richmond symbolises the idealised solution to all the dynastic and political turmoil that has been dramatized to support to contextual Tudor myth. The antithesis of the ghosts wishes for Richard to “Despair and die” with the blessing for Richmond to “awake and win the day” highlights how Shakespeare aims to foreground the lack of moral integrity in Richard’s identity and use of performance. However, in Pacino’s docudrama, Richmond is marginalised to the extent where he becomes a simple plot device in order for Richard’s dramatic demise. This creates a clash with the moral internal conversations of Shakespeare, highlighting how purpose and context force composers to reshape in order to resonate with a specific audience. Other characters who in Shakespeare’s text create resistance, such as Lady Anne and Queen Elizabeth, are also silenced. Richard’s task to persuade Lady Anne seems nearly impossible, so when he does, it shows the audience just how strong, cunning, and deceitful he really is. However, Pacino cuts away the scathing retorts. Whilst this may be to focus on Richard himself, some may question whether this\n\ncourse in making sure that their reputations aren’t so big they would outshine him. If we look at each individual there is a reason for example Spacey is well known for playing supporting roles and that’s exactly what his character Buckingham is. The women are no different. Pacino himself tells us this, explicitly stating “I want somebody very young” to play Lady Anne. This is because he wants to play up her naivety. Shakespeare’s Lady Anne as a character was much stronger however Pacino uses his authority to reframe the modern audiences view of this character. Pacino emphasises that this reframing is possible due to the medium available to him in the 20th century as shown through his comment “we don’t have the problem of projecting the role ... because it’s a film”.\n\nEnhancing the women’s role in mourning.\n\nThe women are established as mourners for the dead in both Shakespeare’s text and Pacino’s text, yet the depiction of female grief has no historical precedent. In Shakespeare’s text each time we see women in mourning and a man with a clear aim to conquer them. In Pacino’s docudrama it is no different. Pacino enhances this especially where he inserts a dramatic staging of Elizabeth mourning the death of her children, something that was not originally explored. This is done through slow cross fading of the camera moving to different angles of the one scene, highlighting the confusion and overwhelming sorrow she is feeling, as if dizzy and cannot think straight. Elizabeth being inconsolable once more reinforces Pacino’s perspective that the women are weak and hysterical. One reason Shakespeare may not have included such an intense moment of grieving is because throughout his text the women are portrayed as strong.\n\nOpinions of the Women in the 20th Century\n\nWinona Ryder, the actress of Lady Anne, is literally silenced by Pacino, only managing to state “her mourning is genuine because she loved...” before being dominated by Pacino and reduced to mere giggles. This is the only line Ryder is allowed to contribute in the documentary style clips, all other dialogue comes directly from Shakespeare. This creates the idea that Pacino has power over her, which alludes to the fact he has sole authority (again relating back to his purpose in making the docudrama). It also showcases the idea that women in the 20th century do not have valuable input. We also see this more subtly in Penelope Allen’s more bespoke clips. Allen believes that the strength of the women are important to the development of Richards character. If they are strong, it makes Richard’s ability to conquer them even more impressive. This is evident by the rhetorical question “Why make them weak? ... By diminishing their importance, you diminish his actions” and the passionate statement “then it is no great deed on his part if you make them weak”. However, Kimble calls Queen Elizabeth “a hysteric” and adds that “they’ve got a lady here who is way out of control”. This is the point of view which Pacino shares. Immediately after Kimble states that Elizabeth is “a hysteric” there is a long shot of Allen with her hands thrown in the air as if she is hysterical. Throughout the rest of the docudrama we see things such as the queen throwing herself upon the dead king is not a stage direction included in the original text. Pacino’s insertion of this links back to the idea women are hysterical. Showing her distressed and unable to control her emotions would make Pacino’s opinion on her character more believable, despite this being something Shakespeare did not script.\n\nYet, despite this Pacino voices the opinions of female scholars and British actresses. Namely, Pacino features Vanessa Redgrave quite predominantly throughout the docudrama. Redgrave’s opinions and commentary are included to give a sense of legitimacy to Pacino’s docudrama. The difference between Redgrave and the other actresses is that she is British. Pacino is trying to usurp British authority over Shakespeare, therefore he already perceives\n\nhimself as the underdog to actresses such as Redgrave. Whereas, Pacino already believes he has superior knowledge to contribute than the American actresses in his context and therefore silences their opinions in his work. Allen’s opinion contradicts his own and has no value in legitimising his work so therefore he discredits it. Pacino wants to show Ryder’s character as passive and naïve in Shakespeare’s text so why would he allow her a voice in this context either?\n\nSample essays\n\nSample Essay 1\n\nThis essay is a slightly modified version of the essay I wrote under time conditions in my trials which received 20/20. The essay addresses the NSW Module A ‘Textual Conversations’ and thus includes in depth analysis of the Shakespearean play as well as analysis of Looking for Richard. This is a good example of how to write an integrated essay where you examine the texts side by side and look at how they interact with each other. Even if you are not studying the two texts together, there is no harm in understanding the specifics of Shakespeare’s text as it will encourage greater understanding of what Pacino was trying to achieve. As I said I wrote this in trials so it shows you approximately the length that is expected of a top response.\n\nQuestion: How does the textual conversation between Shakespeare’s Richard III and\n\nPacino’s Looking for Richard grant new insights into the timeless nature of deceit?\n\nThus, the contextual disparity highlights whilst deceit is utilised timelessly, the nature and focus of such will be moulded to suit present day values and purpose.\n\nParagraph 3 – Resonance: Challenging dominant discourses The challenging of dominant discourses in both RIII and LFR is made possible through the dichotomous nature of deceit and ultimately resonates the ability to have authority in one’s own context. The opening soliloquy begins decisively in an inverted rhythm, the troche placed on “now” in the iambic “now is the winter of our discontent”. This authority demands the audience’s attention and allows Richard to challenge the contextual tension between free will and providentialism. This is aided by the indicative use of diction in “I am determined to prove a villain”. Furthermore, in the metaphor “leave the world for me to bustle in” the ability to utilise deceit for means of establishing agency is brought to attention. Pacino mirrors this in his challenge to usurp British hegemony over Shakespearean literature. The colloquial nature of Pacino’s docudrama form allows the canonisation of Shakespeare’s work to be challenged. In stating “they’ve got it in their heads they can’t (do Shakespeare)” Pacino expresses his purpose to change this. The fragmented pastiche of the opening soliloquy represents this disconnect through dry cuts and a lack of understanding portrayed through interspersed comic clips. Yet, as Pacino manipulates the form to foster an American specific understanding of Shakespeare’s text, the film builds to a cohesive composition through the crescendo in music, representing the new authority which has been established. Through manipulating form, both Shakespeare and Pacino are able to deceive the audience and establish authority over their respective dominant discourses.\n\nConclusion The timeless nature of deceit is shaped through the textual conversation between RIII and LFR as contextual complexities present a multiplicity of meaning upon the disparate texts. The use of performance to deceive, in both texts, demonstrates the manipulation of language to meet the purpose of the text whilst in vastly different contexts. However, the marginalisation of characters from Shakespeare’s text emphasises how the purpose and context of a text can change the focus to different aspects of deceit, as Pacino focuses on psychological disruption. Yet, both ultimately utilise means of deceit to challenge dominant discourses within their context.\n\nSample Essay 2\n\nThis essay is just about Al Pacino’s text. Obviously, there will still be references to Shakespeare, as that is what his text is about, but I won’t quote Shakespeare directly as for this essay we don’t need analysis of Shakespeare’s techniques. The themes of this essay are similar to the last one so that you can see the difference between writing an essay comparing the texts and one that is just about Pacino’s text. Also notice how the style of question is different as we are no longer looking at the link between texts, instead doing more of a closed, critical study.\n\nQuestion: What is Al Pacino’s purpose in crafting Looking for Richard?\n\nIntroduction Pacino explicitly outlines that his purpose in crafting Looking for Richard is to make Shakespeare accessible to the American population of his current context. Pacino creates an egocentric portrayal of Richard III’s identity, marginalising other characters and historical context, to make this text more accessible. Similarly, Pacino eliminates the ontological\n\nconversations present in Shakespeare’s Richard III, which were relevant exclusively to Shakespeare’s context, in order to reduce complexity which modern audiences may find confusing. However, through mirroring Shakespeare’s challenge of dominant discourses, Pacino demonstrates an ulterior motive to assert his own authority over the Shakespearean text thus usurping British hegemony. Pacino therefore displays a duality between his explicit purpose of making Richard III accessible, and his ulterior purpose of asserting his personal authority by crafting Looking for Richard.\n\nParagraph 1 – Egocentricity In Looking for Richard, Pacino narrows the focus onto Richard, for the purpose of exploring the multidimensional, villainous character developed in Richard III, without the complex relationships and historical context. Pacino’s hemogenic American milieu establishes his purpose of making Shakespeare accessible to an American viewer. Thus, in the docu-drama form, he aims to eliminate the convoluted familial relationships and historical allusions which he believes makes Shakespeare’s play “hard play to get.” Pacino utilises colloquial rhetoric to appeal to the audience in asking “We need relationships between all those characters. Who can keep it straight?”. Pacino claims he is “confused just saying it” and therefore his focus narrows to, as the title suggests, explore Richard’s characterisation. Pacino makes many monosyllabic exclamations such as “I’m not the king and I want to be! It’s that simple!” to provide a clear foundation in which a new understanding of Richards characterisation will be built. Furthermore, Pacino marginalises other characters which were prevalent in Shakespeare’s play in order to simplify the text and make it accessible. Richmond was significant in Shakespeare’s text due to the contextual Tudor myth, however, for Pacino Richmond is reduced to a mere plot device. Pacino further marginalises Lady Anne by removing the stichomythic exchanges, reducing her character to be passive. Wenona Ryder is similarly marginalised, to focus solely on Pacino’s psychology of deceit. In her attempt to state “her mourning was genuine because she...” Pacino cuts her off, reducing her to mere giggles. Hence, Pacino’s purpose to make Shakespeare’s Richard III more accessible is achieved through his egocentric construction of his text.\n\nParagraph 2 – ontological conversations In order to make the text accessible to the contemporary audience, Pacino removes the ontological conversations within Richard III which have contextually become obsolete. This makes Richards relentless pursuit of power, previously examined at a cost, hollow due to the morally uncertain post-modernist view. In Pacino’s post-modern, secular context the ultimate consequence of the damnation of Richard’s soul is not applicable, and thus there is a clash in ontological exploration. However, Pacino examines the consequence of Richards actions being psychological fragmentation rather than damnation of his soul. This is demonstrated through the scholars simile that Richard is “like a kind of boar who has subsumed into himself”, emphasising his downfall is his own doing rather than due to disobeying God. Pacino is therefore able to reposition the modern audience to sympathise with Richard more so than Shakespeare. Pacino offers new insight into moral relativism by conveying contemporary ambiguity between the boundaries of performance and reality. This is done through exclamations such as “it’s an act and these people are buying it, it’s a complete lie!” whilst being supported by a heroic portrayal of his death. Despite understanding his villainous characters, Pacino portrays his character’s death with a certain heroism and a certain stoic honour right to the end of the play. Thus, Pacino’s reconceptualization deepens\n\nreality in the 20th century context. In Looking for Richard, Actor and role merge as seen in Pacino method acting, exclaiming “I want to be king already” despite referring to his character Richard, highlighting that we are all actors. Pacino’s duplicitous identity shaped in Looking for Richard reflects how performance is utilised as a weapon in the relentless pursuit of power. Pacino utilises the heavily constructed cinema verte form to present staged situations in a spontaneous manner. His unprompted documentary style clips such as “who’s gonna say action around here” layered with a dazzling mosaic of comic documentary and dramatic performance demonstrating the lack of value placed on integrity. Pacino creates further layers of deception through utilising post-modern techniques, such as directing the camera to show Richard’s face in half light and half dark, to symbolise dual identity. Pacino’s manipulation of form thus shows the increased importance in controlling perceptions, through performing a role. At the end of the docudrama, Pacino’s degradation of language is shown, again through use of method acting, in his monosyllabic exclamation of “I want to be king already” and accosting crew members. This exposes Pacino’s true character emphasising the importance of rhetoric in being able to perform a role in society. Pacino’s emphasis on performance and theatricality throughout his docudrama creates an engaging character which makes the audience question their societies morals.\n\nParagraph 2: Egocentricity. Pacino’s egocentric construction of his character reframes Shakespeare’s text, heralding secular humanist values and focusing on the psychological motivations of Richard rather than his position in the broader Christian order. The symbolic title fade-in from “King Richard '' to “Looking for Richard '' emphasises the reframing of contemporary values of analysis and understanding of the human psyche. Antithetical to Shakespeare’s Machivallian portrayal, Pacino displaces the Great Chain of being in the modern context, subverting Richard as a “hunted boar”, hence, evoking the audience’s empathy by overturning Richard’s motivation as a result of psychological fragmentation rather than innate evil. Pacino emphasises empathy and relatability to Richard’s character by consistently linking himself to Richard through first person pronouns “I” and directly confiding Richard’s intention as his own through disruptive cuts. Pacino’s method acting implies that Richard’s ambition transcends time and resonates with the contemporary audience as a universal aspect of the human condition. These values are further epitomised through Pacino’s reimagining of Richard’s death, where his stoicism in the face of Richmond is celebrated rather than maligned. Pacino positions the audience to identify with Richard's self determination through a point of view shot of Richmond, suggesting that modern viewers and Richard aligns in values. Ultimately, by casualising Richard’s death scene in the contemporary setting, Pacino dismantles the notion of Divine wrath and celebrates Renaissance humanist interest in autonomy, enhancing Richard’s relatability as the modern audience resonates with his extreme sense of self. Thus, Pacino shapes his character to align with Richard’s in order to engage audiences and demonstrate the psychological motivations of Richard.\n\nParagraph 3: Villainy and Deceit Pacino constructs a duplicitous, villainous character, mirroring that of Richard himself, in order to engage the audience in a contemplation of human nature and the pursuit of power. Driven by Postmodern values of human agency, Pacino subverts the Elizabethan perspective on one’s multifaceted nature, instead, implying that it resides in the human condition. Pacino resonates Richard’s multifaceted character by abusing power and authority over the authenticity of the text, reframing Richard III with contemporary values to serve his own agenda. In balancing the roles of an actor and director, Pacino carefully constructs a routine\n\nof cluelessness and chaos, advising to “get the gist.. Just trust you’ll get it”. This lulls the viewer into a sense of security in navigating a complex play, emphasising the significance of feelings, rather than cognitive comprehension in understanding Shakespeare. This postmodern self-consciousness permeates the film though the pastiche of styles - stage drama, documentary, academic discussion and vox populis - allowing him to enhance Shakespeare’s accessibility through a hybrid. Responding to the linguistic confusion that hinders modern engagement with Shakespeare, Pacino deliberately reshapes the profundity of Shakespeare’s traditional language through changing the name in the prophecy from “G” to “C” and degrades the role of iambics through a simile, comparing to the physical appearance of an “anteater... very high in the back and very short little front legs”. This feigned ignorance is a surreptitious manipulation itself. While Pacino’s reimagining enhances the modern responer’s appreciation of Shakespeare, they are deceived by his own ‘palpable device’ that is Looking for Richard as a construction. However, in playing multiple roles, Pacino’s identity as a man who values Shakespeare clashes with his multifaceted role in contextualising the play for his modern audience. In abusing power and authority over the play, Pacino undermines the authenticity of Shakespeare’s work, as suggested by the disappointment of the personified Shakespeare at the end of the film. Pacino’s multifaceted, duplicitous character is effectively shaped to engage the audience in understanding Shakespeare. contextualising the play for his modern audience. In abusing power and authority over the play, Pacino undermines the authenticity of Shakespeare’s work, as suggested by the disappointment of the personified Shakespeare at the end of the film.\n\n[CONCLUSION]\n\nSample Essay 4\n\nQuestion: Explore the ways in which Looking for Richard reveals the values and\n\nattitudes of Pacino’s context.\n\nIntroduction Pacino reveals the values and attitudes prevalent in the 1990’s American context through the way in which he manipulates the reconstruction of Shakespeare’s Richard III.

In the opening of Pacino’s docudrama, he establishes his purpose through saying “it has always been a dream of mine to communicate how I feel about Shakespeare to other people”. This alludes to aspirations in relation to the American Dream, the ideal by which equality of opportunity is available to any American, allowing the highest aspirations and goals to be achieved. Pacino’s wish to communicate Shakespeare is traditionally seen as the role of the British and therefore his attempt to assert authority over the subject matter can be to reflect the belief in equal\n\nPacino’s opinion on her character more believable, despite this being something Shakespeare did not script. Pacino paints an unfavourable portrayal of the female actresses, demonstrating the values of his context.\n\nConclusion In Looking for Richard, Pacino reveals a wide scope of predominant values and attitudes present in his 20th century, American context.
