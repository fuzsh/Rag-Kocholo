        "text": "Looking For Richard Essay\n\n1218 Words | 5 Pages\n\nPacino’s Looking for Richard is a modern reinterpretation of the underlying themes from Shakespeare’s Richard III. Power, ambition, and free will are recurrent themes in both, yet they also relate to the more basic elements of what makes us human. It is what has changed between Shakespeare’s portrayal of a monster and Pacino’s subversion of the character which gives insight into the respective contextual concerns. Pacino’s Looking for Richard demonstrates how the reshaping of an original text, Richard III, is influenced by the cultural assumptions, context and key values. P1 - Cultural assumptions - the pursuit of power Shakespeare makes symbolic use of cultural assumptions Religion was a very integral and key part of the Elizabethan era.\n\nShakespeare explores the idea of self determination through his pursuit of power in Richard III as he attempts to behold the throne for the Elizabethan audience. Shakespear profoundly encapsulates Richard's cunning, manipulative and ambitious nature that demonstrates his pursuit of power as he states “Since I cannot prove a lover I am determined to prove a villain”. Richard, during the opening soliloquy of the play expresses his motivation of becoming a villain through his paradoxical pun that also foreshadows his ambition to obtain the throne of England, ultimately going against God. Pacino, like Shakespeare, provides insight into the pursuit of power for Richard that\n\nInsanity In Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet\n\n1792 Words | 8 Pages\n\nThere has always been something absolutely mesmerizing about a madman, be he present in a dark psychological thriller, a heart wrenching drama or otherwise. As a product of its time, Shakespeare’s Hamlet is in no dissension of this fact, with audiences young and old enraptured by the title character’s violent insanity and his love interest’s frail and tragic instability. However, as a product of its time and its time alone, there are certainly things lost in translation when the play is presented to a less than medieval audience. This is why it is always so important that the play be reinterpreted for the audience that will be viewing it. Franco Zeffirelli's 1990 Hamlet is most definitely a product of its time as well, a fine example of Shakespeare\n\nUnlike Shakespeare, Pacino and his team reframe the chain of being and how it appeals to Elizabethan audiences by subverting the traditional hierarchy through casting choices. The use of aerial shots of castles and other grand buildings associated with the monarchy mirrors the importance of the chain of being in LFR. A shot of Windsor Castle is captured from a low angle, emphasising the size and power of the building, and is accompanied by a non-diegetic voiceover discussing the monarchy's power and influence, assisting in developing a personal connection with the audience and reinforcing the idea that the chain of affecting everyone such as monarchs and the common people. Close-up shots of actors and academics discussing KRIII emphasises show the Chain of Being affects everyone, including monarchs and commoners, developing a personal connection with audiences. Pacino states \"In Search of Shakespeare, we've found ourselves.\n\nHamlet in Cinema: Branagh vs Zeffirelli\n\n1041 Words | 5 Pages\n\nKnown for producing one of the most renowned and successful depictions of Hamlet, director Kenneth Branagh has transformed the world of Shakespearean films.

However, Josephine Tey's novel, The Daughter of Time, provides a fresh perspective on Richard's character and actions, challenging the accepted historiography and calling into question the veracity of the sources used to construct his image. In this paper, I will assess Tey's approach, compare it with the traditional portrayal of Richard III, and argue that her book provides a compelling case for the revision of the historical narrative. Richard III is often depicted as a\n\nRichard III Is Evil Essay\n\n1571 Words | 7 Pages\n\nDuring the first act, it becomes clear that Richard is wicked.

A compelling way to analyze “Hamlet” is through the marxist lens, comparing how different characters use power to exploit others weaknesses, or other insights into the plays social and political dynamics. By examining the characters Polonius and Claudius, we can gain a deeper understanding as to the contradictions and conflicts within the ruling class, as well as to how these dynamics shape the events within the play. Hamlet is a tragedy by william shakespeare that tells the story of Prince Hamlet of denmark, consumed by grief and seeking revenge on his\n\nLady Macbeth A Misogynist Analysis\n\n1551 Words | 7 Pages\n\nIt may seem like Shakespeare treats his female characters worse than his male characters, but it is his female characters that drive the plot\n\nFeminism In Hamlet Essay\n\n1441 Words | 6 Pages\n\nFeminism has gained a new definition a new understanding of female roles since the Elizabethan Era. Hamlet, a play written by William Shakespeare, is about a young prince, Hamlet, being visited by his father’s apparition urging him to avenge his death by murdering Prince Hamlet’s uncle, Claudius. All the while, Hamlet is enraged by his mother’s hasty marriage to Claudius and is showering his supposed love, Ophelia, with gifts and words of affection. Queen Gertrude and Ophelia are blindly obedient to male authority due to the influence of the social standards that require women to be submissive to men. Queen Gertrude and Ophelia’s actions and outcomes as characters are affected by male influence, the social norms of this time, and the females’ consequences of following these norms.\n\nMasculinity In Othello\n\n1010 Words | 5 Pages\n\nFor Shakespeare’s plays to contain enduring ideas, it must illustrate concepts that still remain relevant today, in modern society. Shakespeare utilises his tragic play Othello, to make an important social commentary on the common gender stereotypes. During early modern England, Shakespeare had to comply to the strict social expectations where women were viewed as tools, platonic and mellow, and where men were displayed as masculine, powerful, tempered, violent and manipulative. As distinct as this context is to the 21st century, the play exposes how women were victimised by the men who hold primary power in the community in which they compelled women to conform to the ideal world of a perfect wife or confront an appalling destiny for challenging the system. Moreover, Shakespeare utilises the main antagonist, Iago, to portray how men are desperate to achieve what they want and to indirectly fulfil the stereotype of masculinity and power through manipulation.\n\nSimilarities Between Hamlet And Julius Caesar\n\n933 Words | 4 Pages\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was well versed in the English language, whether it be poetry or playwrights. The Tragedy of Julius Caesar and Hamlet are playwrights that entail odd, but heavy struggles for both characters. Using Brutus’s and Hamlet’s interaction with their female counterparts, their thirst for vengeance, and specific character traits, Shakespeare develops two tragic heroes of different time periods. When comparing and contrasting Brutus and Hamlet it is important to note their interactions with women within the play. Both Hamlet and Brutus have significant female influences throughout each of their stories.\n\nMadness In Hamlet Analysis\n\n1457 Words | 6 Pages\n\nIn the play, Hamlet, William Shakespeare reflects the common early modern beliefs and perspectives about madness by using the character development of the protagonist who feigns madness throughout the play. Given Hamlet 's status as a prince, current knowledge of madness during the time period, and the contrast of the different types of madness of other characters in the play, Elizabethan audiences would have found it plausible that Hamlet feigns madness as part of his plot to avenge his father 's death. This new historicist perspective steers the modern reader away from anachronistic psychological interpretations of the play. Hamlet’s status as a prince gives the character certain roles and expectations to fulfill, such as avenging his father’s\n\nJan-Erik Aavik IB English HL B.
