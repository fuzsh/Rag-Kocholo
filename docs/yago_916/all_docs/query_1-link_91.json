        "text": "Through Al Pacino’s clever unpacking of Shakespeare’s historical play ‘Richard-III’, Pacino has created the opportunity for the texts to have been in conversation, discussing the value of integrity and the power of women. “Richard-III” and “Looking for Richard” are products of differing cultural, social, contextual, and political paradigms, instinctively composed to engage opposing audiences. Shakespeare’s tragedy play ‘Richard-III’ takes place in 15th century England at the end of Edward IV’s reign, focusing upon Richards III’s heinous attempt to become king. England, during this period, was exceedingly religious, with theocentric views being extremely prominent. Pacino’s postmodern docudrama was filmed in 1996 and is an evaluation of Shakespeare’s unchanging relevancy in modern society. Pacino’s society is predominately secular, with less of a focus on god, but rather an emphasis on individualism – where one’s self-worth is not determined by god, but rather by goals and achievements. Thus, the text's dissonances underline society’s shift in beliefs, values, and ideas. Yet still, the text's resonances show that the texts are linked through the exploration of similar ideas, the consistency of fundamental values and characteristics in human nature. Furthermore, the Resonances and Dissonances between and within the texts can be clearly identified through an array of literary and film devices, and once acknowledged can reveal the broader textual conversations being had.\n\nRegardless of humanity's fluctuating views on ambition, the constant representation of characters struggling with their moral dilemmas demonstrates that integrity is universally appreciated. Within Richard-III, Shakespeare argues that those with ambition were ‘innately evil’, but, because of the prevalent ideal of the American dream, Pacino argues that anybody in society can lose their integrity from their unrestrained ambition. The Elizabethan belief that an individual’s identity is pre-determined by God, is revealed through Shakespeare’s allusion to the Levitical Doctrine. This is established in Richard’s opening soliloquy, where he uses an unpleasant tone whilst lamenting that he has been “cheated of feature by dissembling nature / deformed, unfinish’d, sent before my time”. This quote acts as a metaphor outlining Richards's devilish nature, with the adjectives “unfished” and “deformed” suggesting that Richard is physically flawed. This further reinforces the Elizabethan Tudor myth that an evil appearance signifies a sinful nature, and thus symbolises Richards's lack of integrity in an Elizabethan setting. Shakespeare creates dissonance within ‘Richard-III’ through the inclusion of Richmond, who is a direct contrast to Richard. England had a strong sense of dichotomy existing between good and evil throughout this period, thus Richmond serves to be a foil to Richards's evilness. “god and our good cause fight upon our side. The prayers of holy saints” - Richmond’s consistent use of biblical references, highlight that he is a man of religion and hence a man of integrity, unalike Richard. Reflective of modern America’s secular understanding of the intricacy of the human psyche, Al Pacino dissonates with Shakespeare’s text by offering a more psychologically complex and vulnerable version of Richard. Richard is faced with pursuing his ambitions or upholding a relationship with his brother Clarence. Pacino captures his moral dilemma through the use of close-ups of his conflicted and saddened facial expressions whilst he strokes his brother's face. These film devices position a modern audience to sympathise with Pacino’s Richard more so than Shakespeare’s. Pacino characterizes Richard to be a product of his individualistic society, rather than an innately evil being like he is in the original play. Though similarly, both texts' consistent exploration of the nature of evil symbolizes that both contrasting societies value integrity. However, Pacino’s intercut of Fredric Kimball recounting Shakespeare’s opening soliloquy as “a sick king and everybody maneuvering around” illustrates how humanity, including Richard, is so compelled by their ambitions that they often use duplicity in the quest for power. Although humanity's view of a\n\nperson’s identity has altered, a comparative study underlines the unchanging value of integrity, whereby, beings aren’t to use deceitfulness to accomplish goals.\n\nIndividual power is significantly affected by gender, and representation of the power of women fluctuates between both texts. In ‘Richard-III’, the females serve not only to establish Richard’s power but additionally to be a force of providentialism and that of the ethically correct, whereas this is underemphasized in ‘Looking for Richard’ in favor of sexualization, to focus on the dynamics within the character of Richard himself. Due to the Calvinistic beliefs of Shakespeare’s times, he uses women to communicate providentialism, juxtaposing Richard who believes in free will. Although women were considered to be socially inferior to men these days, Shakespeare installs them with prophetic power, which is out of reach from men, thus giving them a power of their own. Their emotional energy hoists them to a position of power in terms of influencing the spectator’s thoughts. Only when a woman comes onto stage do we truly see the emotional reality of Richards's manipulation. Margaret, whose husband has been murdered by Richard, plays a character that mirrors the trust in the supernatural and divine will, cursing Richard through biblical allusions and seasonal metaphors to depict her as bitter. Using her prophecy control she questions “If heaven has and grievous plague in store/.../Oh, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe”, referring to the Egyptians and the ten plagues that were set upon them during the persecution of the Israelites. This further associates Richard with a murderous Tyrant that deserves God’s reprimand in the afterlife, foreshadowing future events. Margret’s ripening imagery, again a component of the extended metaphor, connects her to autumn which is associated with change. Dissonances can be found within the play as Richard is associated with winter and King Edward with summer, demonstrating that Margaret as a female character has an equally powerful role within the play. Though Pacino resonates with Shakespeare by using females to add viewpoint and to generate forms of empathy, ultimately his focus is on the portrayal of sexual power. By placing importance on the exploration of Richard’s motivations, Pacino weakens the role of females. In the scene where Richard pursues Anne, Al Pacino sexualizes Anne, objectifying her to indicate Richard’s power. Resonances can be identified in the film, in both the re- enactments and the apparently ‘real world’ circumstances, representing Winona (Anne), as submissive and weak, genuine to her character. Pacino previously states, he wishes to hire somebody who is “very young”, to serve his commitment of intensifying Richard’s individual power and transporting it into a modern context. In modern society, sexualization is commonly used to convince the audience of something and to achieve power over them. Because of Pacino’s secular society, he has been given the freedom he requires to transform a play that has been profoundly influenced by Queen Elizabeth I and her strict censorship laws. The use of cinematic techniques aids Pacino’s process of making ‘Richard-III’ comprehensible to contemporary audiences and is beneficial in forming resonances between the modern world and the play, such as in the scenes with Richard(Pacino)/Anne(Winona). By casting Winona Ryder, who is widely seen as desirable, Pacino lures his watchers to be wooed alongside Anne and assists in her objectification. Pacino’s use of sexualization is further seen when, he has the two characters sensually kiss rather than copying the original script with formal Farwell’s, displaying Richards's power to make Lady Anne surrender to him. By using ‘MTV cuts’, Al Pacino switches from this scene to a hand-held camera, displaying a close-up of Winona Ryder turning to Pacino for comfort. Following this, Kimball interrupts Winona, mocking her, thus emphasizing his dominance over her. Pacino’s use of camera angles turning away and side lighting reinforces Anna/Winona as being submissive. This is contrasted with a later scene of Pacino outside roaring and laughing “I’ll have her, but I will not keep her long”, further diminishing Anna as a sexual conquest rather"
