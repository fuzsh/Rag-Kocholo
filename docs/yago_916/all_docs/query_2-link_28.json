        "text": "Actor, producer, director. Born Alfredo James Pacino, on April 25, 1940, in New York City. Pacino's mother left Al's father Sal, to go back and be with her mother who was against the marriage in the first place,Sal & Rose finally divorced and Salremarried. The young boy was raised by his father Salfor a short time than Sal was drafted by the Army/Airforce when Al was two years old and than raised by his mother and Sicilian grandparents raised Al in Manhattans notoriously tough area of East Harlem. An avid moviegoer, Pacino was known around the neighborhood for his dead-on impersonations of film legends.\n\nAs a teenager he held various odd jobs, including theater usher and building superintendent. However, Pacino aspired for more creative pursuits and soon enrolled in New Yorks Herbert Berghof Studio, where he flourished in drama and the arts.\n\nAt the age of 17, Pacino relocated to the Greenwich Village area, which served as New Yorks hub for performing arts in the 1950s and 1960s. Shortly after, he landed his first part in the stage production Hello Out There, which was directed by his mentor and friend Charles Laughton. In the mid 1960s, he worked as an actor at Caf√© La Mama and The Living Theatre, where he enjoyed a steady stream of supporting roles and bit parts. Pacino went on to study under Lee Strasberg at the famed Actors Studio. He adopted the Method-acting approach (described as a technique by which an actor seeks to gain complete identification with the personality he or she is portraying), which would later influence his portrayal of some of cinemas most complex characters.\n\nDuring the late 60s, Pacino worked with the Charles Playhouse in Boston, where he appeared in a number of productions including America Hurrah and Awake and Sing (both 1967). In 1968, Pacino returned to New York and made his off-Broadway debut in the one-act play The Indian Wants the Bronx, for which he earned a Best Actor Obie Award. He soon graduated to Broadway, where he appeared in Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie? (1969), for which he received a Tony Award for Best Supporting Actor, as well as the Drama Desk and Theatre World Awards. That same year, Varietys poll of metropolitan drama critics chose him as Broadways most promising new actor.\n\nAfter conquering the stage, Pacino tried his hand at the screen, making his film debut in 1969s Me, Natalie. Shortly after, he landed his first lead role (as a heroin addict) in Panic in Needle Park (1971). Director Francis Ford Coppola was so impressed by his performance that he cast Pacino in the coveted role of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972). Arguably one of the greatest roles in modern American cinema, studio executives were extremely skeptical when Hollywood heavyweights Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson were passed over for the virtually unknown Pacino. In his portrayal of the brooding Mafia heir, Pacinos raw talent exploded onto the screen. The Godfather was hailed by critics and audiences alike, and Pacino received his first Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor in 1972. Two years later, he reprised his role as the more mature Corleone in 1974s sequel The Godfather, Part II (this time securing his first Oscar nod for Best Actor).\n\nIn his next projects, Pacino collaborated with director Sidney Lumet and earned two more Oscar nominations for his roles as the incorruptible cop in Serpico (1973) and as a bisexual bank robber in Dog Day Afternoon (1975). Both unconventional films were extremely well received, only further confirming Pacinos success as a multifaceted actor.\n\nPacino secured his fourth Academy Award nomination for his role as a crusading lawyer in And Justice For All (1979). In Brian DePalmas Scarface (1983), Pacino played the infamous Cuban drug lord Tony Montana, opposite Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Loggia. After Scarface, Pacino took a four-year sabbatical from film, returning to star in 1989s sultry thriller Sea of Love, with Ellen Barkin. Later that year, he added directing to his repertoire with a personal project titled The Local Stigmatic (1989), which was not intended for national release.\n\nThe 1990s proved to be a very productive decade for Pacino, when he made a number of acclaimed films and portrayed a wide range of characters. In 1990, he earned yet another Best Supporting Actor nomination for his role in Warren Beattys Dick Tracy and (for the third time) played Michael Corleone in The Godfather, Part III. He captured his first Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as a blind veteran in 1992s Scent of a Woman, and simultaneously earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance in David Mamets play Glengarry Glen Ross. In 1993, he reunited with DePalma for Carlitos Way.\n\nPacino paid homage to his grandfather in the Depression-era film Two Bits (1995), in which he played a character based on his late relative. Later that year, he starred as a determined detective in Michael Manns Heat (1995), alongside Robert DeNiro, who played the equally determined criminal. Heat reunited Pacino and DeNiro for the first time since the The Godfather: Part II and also marked their first appearance on screen together.\n\nIn 1997, Pacino received praise for his portrayal of a small-time mobster in Donnie Brasco, which co-starred Johnny Depp. He delivered two no-holds-barred performances as a modern-day Satan in 1997sThe Devils Advocate(opposite Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron) and as 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman in 1999s Oscar-nominated The Insider (opposite Russell Crowe). Later in 1999, Pacino headlined Oliver Stones Any Given Sunday, in which he played an aging football coach at odds with the establishment.\n\nThroughout his career, Pacino moved between screen and stage. In 1977, he won a second Tony Award for his part in the Broadway production The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel. In the fall of 1979, he took on the challenging title role in the play Richard III; and from 1980-83 he intermittently appeared as Walter Cole in David Mamets American Buffalo, performing in different venues throughout the U.S and Britain.\n\nAlthough Pacino considers himself first and foremost a stage actor, his films are the medium that propelled him to stardom. His career has spanned five decades and over 30 films, the majority of which have produced some of Hollywoods most memorable characters. Pacino has never been married despite a few long-term relationships with actresses Jill Clayburgh, Marthe Keller, and Diane Keaton. In 1989, Pacinos relationship with acting teacher Jan Tarrant produced a daughter, Julie who lives with her mother.\n\nAl has 4 sisters Josette Pacino(school teacher) twin sisters Roberta Pacino-Richman (a filmaker, with her husband Mark Richman)and Paula, (Homemaker), and the youngest sister, Desiree Pacino(Food and Beverage industry)."
