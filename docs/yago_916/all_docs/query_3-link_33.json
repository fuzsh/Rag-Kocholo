        "text": "NARRATOR:\n\nOur revels now are ended.\n\nThese our actors, as I foretold you...\n\n... were all spirits\n\nand are melted into air...\n\n... into thin air.\n\nAnd, like the baseless fabric\n\nof this vision...\n\n... the cloud-capp'd towers...\n\n... the gorgeous palaces...\n\n... the solemn temples...\n\n... the great globe itself...\n\n... ye all which it inherit...\n\n... shall dissolve...\n\n... and, like this insubstantial pageant\n\nfaded...\n\n... leave not a wisp behind.\n\nWe are such stuff\n\nas dreams are made on...\n\n... and our little life\n\nis rounded with a sleep.\n\nWho's gonna say, \"Action\"?\n\nShould I say it, or should you?\n\n- You wanna say it?\n\nHADGE:\n\nYou can say it.\n\n- I don't want to. Say it.\n\nSPACEY:\n\nYou say it.\n\nKIMBALL:\n\nAnd action!\n\n- How do I look?\n\nI can't see anything.\n\nAre they out there?\n\nThis is my entrance.\n\nF***.\n\n[GROWLS]\n\nMAN 1:\n\nI'm actually reading Richard III...\n\n...and I can't get on with it.\n\nI've been reading it for six months.\n\nYou want to do it\n\nwith your American accent?\n\nWe're getting $40 a day\n\nand all the doughnuts we can eat.\n\nShakespeare? What the f***\n\ndo you know about Shakespeare?\n\nArise, fair sun...\n\n...and kill the envious moon.\n\nLike eager droppings into milk,\n\nit doth posset and curd.\n\nSome are born great,\n\nsome achieve greatness...\n\n...and some have greatness\n\nthrust upon them.\n\nMAN 2:\n\nIntelligence is hooked with language.\n\nWhen we speak with no feeling,\n\nwe get nothing out of our society.\n\nWe should speak like Shakespeare.\n\nWe should introduce Shakespeare\n\ninto the academics.\n\nYou know why? Because then\n\nthe kids would have feelings.\n\nPACINO:\n\nThat's right.\n\n- We have no feelings.\n\nThat's why it's easy for us\n\nto shoot each other.\n\nWe don't feel for each other,\n\nbut if we were taught to feel...\n\n...we wouldn't be so violent.\n\nPACINO:\n\nShakespeare helps us?\n\nHe did more than help us.\n\nHe instructed us.\n\nPACINO:\n\nHi. You gonna see the play tonight?\n\nYou're gonna see it, huh?\n\nHello.\n\nMAN 3:\n\nHow much it cost?\n\nPACINO:\n\nIt's for free.\n\n- Okay, I'm going.\n\n- Okay.\n\nMAN 4:\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n- Your first Shakespeare play?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- It'll be interesting. Give it a try.\n\n- I saw Hamlet recently.\n\n- How did you feel about it?\n\n- Did you see it live? It what?\n\n- It sucked.\n\n- It what?\n\n- It sucked. I saw it live.\n\n- It sucked?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nPACINO:\n\nAnything in Shakespeare that\n\nmade you think it's not close to you...\n\n...or connected to you in any way?\n\n- Yeah, it's boring.\n\nA bank in England uses\n\nShakespeare as...\n\nCover my account number.\n\nSee, it's a hologram.\n\nThey use it as ID to prove\n\nit's a real card.\n\nPACINO:\n\nWhat do you think of Shakespeare?\n\nHe's a great export.\n\nWho's moving in on Shakespeare?\n\nThe Japanese.\n\nBecause they're kicking\n\nthe Americans' ass.\n\nAnd they're all interested\n\nin Shakespeare.\n\nYou know Shakespeare?\n\nWilliam Shakespeare?\n\nWe're peddling him on the streets.\n\nI remember our English teacher\n\nsent us to see...\n\n... a local college production\n\nof King Lear.\n\nI went with my girlfriend...\n\n...and after about 10 minutes\n\nof these people:\n\n[BABBLING]\n\nThey were doing this kind\n\nof Shakespearean acting.\n\nI just tuned right out. We made out\n\nin the back row and left at intermission.\n\nI was brought up in a school...\n\n...where Shakespeare was taught\n\nvery kind of...\n\n...straightforwardly and dully,\n\nto be honest.\n\nWe read it aloud and it made no sense,\n\nbecause there was no connection made.\n\nMy own experience...\n\n...was in the fields in Michigan,\n\nwhere I was raised on a farm...\n\n...and an uncle, who was a Northern\n\nguy, black Northern guy...\n\n...came out of the field one day\n\nand started narrating...\n\n...Antony's speech, the funeral oration.\n\n- From Shakespeare's Julius Caesar?\n\n- Yeah. We'd heard stuff from the Bible...\n\n...but my first time as a kid,\n\nI was hearing...\n\n...great words having great meaning.\n\nKIMBALL:\n\nWhat brings us to Montreal?\n\nTo Paris? To London?\n\nWhat takes us into dungeons,\n\nto parapets...\n\n- To Japan next.\n\n- To Japan, maybe, is a quest.\n\nPACINO:\n\nIt has always been a dream of mine...\n\n... to communicate how I feel\n\nabout Shakespeare to other people.\n\nSo I asked my friend Frederic Kimball,\n\nwho is an actor and a writer...\n\n... and also our colleagues\n\nMichael Hadge...\n\n... and James Bulleit, to join me.\n\nAnd by taking this one play,\n\nRichard III...\n\n... analyzing it, approaching it\n\nfrom different angles...\n\n... putting on costumes,\n\nplaying out scenes...\n\n... we could communicate\n\nboth our passion for it...\n\n... our understanding\n\nthat we've come to...\n\n... and in doing that...\n\n... communicate a Shakespeare\n\nthat is about how we feel...\n\n... and how we think today. That's\n\nthe effort we're gonna give it here.\n\nKIMBALL:\n\nWe've done Richard three times. Twice.\n\nYou did it at the Studio, we've done it\n\nin Boston and on Broadway.\n\nAt least, the head start is that\n\nI've done it. You've done it.\n\n- But the problem, Frederic...\n\nKIMBALL:\n\nThe audience hasn't done it.\n\n- They haven't done it.\n\n- It's a difficult play.\n\nPACINO:\n\nIf someone were to ask you\n\nabout Richard III...\n\n...what would you remember about it?\n\nTo be honest, I really don't remember\n\nthat much, if anything at all.\n\nPACINO:\n\nDid you know that Richard llI\n\nhad a deformed arm and a deformed back?\n\n- No, I didn't.\n\nPACINO:\n\nYou didn't know that?\n\nThe play, Richard III,\n\nabout the guy with the humpback?\n\n- No.\n\n- You got me there.\n\nMm-mm.\n\nPACINO:\n\nHe was a humpback? \"A\n\nhorse. A horse. My kingdom for a horse\"?\n\n- That comes from Richard III.\n\nMAN 5:\n\nIt does, yes.\n\nI mean, nobody knows\n\nwho Richard llI is.\n\n- Nobody.\n\nHADGE:\n\nIt's a tough play to get.\n\nThe relationships between\n\nthose characters.\n\n- Who can keep it straight?\n\n- Well, I think the question is...\n\n...what is the understanding?\n\nI mean, the understanding is...\n\nIt's a simply... Can you\n\nfollow the story line and the plot?\n\nWe've provided this kind of\n\ndocudrama-type thing...\n\n...to inform some of the scenes\n\nso you know where you are.\n\nFor instance, there's an early scene\n\nwith the queen...\n\n... and her brother and her two sons...\n\n... which is outside in an anteroom...\n\n...waiting for the king to call them in\n\nbecause he is inside, sick.\n\nThe queen is worried. She's afraid\n\nthe king will die, who is her husband.\n\nAnd when he dies, the only...\n\nThe only people left to inherit the throne\n\nare her two young sons...\n\n...by the king himself.\n\nShe has two sons by a previous\n\nmarriage, which are in the scene.\n\nAnd she's afraid that the character I\n\nplay, Richard llI of Gloucester...\n\n...is going to take hold\n\nof the situation...\n\n...and somehow manipulate them\n\ninto thinking...\n\n...that they're, you know...\n\nThat the kids are...\n\nI'm confused just saying it.\n\nI can imagine how you must feel...\n\n...hearing me talk. It's confusing.\n\nI don't know why we even bother\n\ndoing this at all.\n\nBut we'll give it a little try.\n\nLet's see what we can come up with.\n\nFirst of all, let's get a smaller...\n\nLet's work out of a smaller book\n\nthan this. This is hard to carry.\n\n- Excuse me, but look at this. \"Hello?\"\n\n- I think...\n\n\"Yes. It's my entrance? Oh, I see. \""
