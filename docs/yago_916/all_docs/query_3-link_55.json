        "text": "Historical Allusion: Richard here is referring to the ‘Wars of Roses’, allowing the viewers to comprehend the outcome of this long withstanding English civil war, and the effect it had on the power dynamics of the monarchy.\n\nMetaphor: the terms “summer” and “winter” here suggest that the reign of King Edward IV has turned sadness (associated with winter) to celebration (summer), which further emphasizes the York’s victory in the Wars of Roses.\n\nPun/ Homonym: “son of York'' which rests in the country-side of York (the location of this play) and “son of York” referring to Richard’s family name (York).\n\nLink to Module A Rubric\n\nPacino’s personal experience with American culture allows him to explore the complexities of Richard and present in a perspective that will resonate in modern-audiences.\n\nWhilst Shakespeare’s notions and values transcend time, allowing it to impart contemporaneous relevance. Pacino further exacerbates this concept by expressing the need to simplify Shakespeare's language to present his timeless themes to contemporary audiences.\n\nLink to Module A Rubic\n\nPower and authority in Shakespeare’s time were conferred through heredity, not merit, and the Wars of the Roses tell us that England was still quite politically unstable only a hundred years before the play was written.\n\nShakespeare examines the nature of power and authority, showing through Richard’s actions that the ends do not justify the means, and that there is a moral dimension to the acquisition and exercise of power.\n\nand physically crippled and twisted to reflect the deformity and corruption of his soul. Shakespeare provides a clear moral message through Richard.\n\nPacino does not portray Richard as the complex and deformed creature which he is in Shakespeare’s play rather a: Manipulative character whose trickery connects to modern politicians who deceive to gain power. The reason why he targets that particular aspect of Richard’s character is because Pacino is trying to make the play more accessible to the modern audience by fulfilling Hollywood’s obsession with the dark villain.\n\nPacino takes Shakespeare's ideas and translates them for a modern audience. Throughout the film, Richard is clothed in black and depicted in gloom and half-light, a visual interpretation of the “shadow” motif that tells the audience of the darkness of his character. In modern democratic societies, a close equivalent of a hereditary absolute monarch is the head of an organised crime family, so Pacino comments before the scene where Hastings is set up and despatched that the council meeting is like “all the dons together”, a group of “gangsters, high-class, upper-class thugs.”"
