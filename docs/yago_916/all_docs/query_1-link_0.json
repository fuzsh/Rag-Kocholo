It is a hybrid film, including both a filmed performance of selected scenes of William Shakespeare's Richard III and a documentary element which explores a broader examination of Shakespeare's continuing role and relevance in popular culture. The film was featured at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1996[1] and it was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.[2] Al Pacino won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing â€“ Documentaries.\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nPacino plays both himself and the title character, Richard III. The film guides the audience through the play's plot and historical background.[3] Pacino and several fellow actors, including Penelope Allen and Harris Yulin,[4] act out scenes from the play.[5]\n\nIn addition, the actors comment on their roles. Pacino also features other actors famous for performing Shakespeare, such as Vanessa Redgrave, Kenneth Branagh, John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, James Earl Jones, and Kevin Kline.[6] Pacino includes interviews with Shakespeare scholars such as Barbara Everett,[7] as well as ordinary people on the street.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAl Pacino as Richard III\n\nPenelope Allen as Queen Elizabeth\n\nHarris Yulin as King Edward\n\nKevin Spacey as Buckingham\n\nWinona Ryder as Lady Anne\n\nMadison Arnold as Rivers\n\nVincent Angell as Grey\n\nGordon MacDonald as Dorset\n\nKevin Conway as Lord Hastings\n\nJulie Moret as Mistress Shore\n\nEstelle Parsons as Queen Margaret\n\nAlec Baldwin as Clarence\n\nAidan Quinn as Richmond\n\nBruce MacVittie 1st Murderer\n\nPaul Guilfoyle 2nd Murderer\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics.
