        "text": "Through the study of Shakespeare’s ‘Richard III’ and Pacino’s ‘Looking for Richard’, a heightened understanding of and engagement with each text is achieved. Exploring the effects context has on the values questioned and assessing the explicit and implicit relations between the texts evolve a greater awareness of each text. Both composers were faced with issues relating to the time of production in conveying their messages. Studying the connections between ‘Richard III’ and ‘Looking for Richard’ convey the significance in evaluating Shakespeare and his universal lessons.\n\nChanges in times and nationality, lead to changed perceptions and values within texts. Shakespeare wrote ‘Richard III’ in 1591. Written during the Elizabethan period for Queen …show more content…\n\nOne theme that Pacino explores at length is the nature of human frailty.

Her unwillingness to believe Richard is shown in both texts when she berates Richard, “O God … revenge his death” and spits at him. However, due to circumstances, Lady Anne is forced to accept Richard’s …show more content…\n\nHe expresses the rise and fall of those in power and the struggles this journey causes. Power hungry Richard openly reflects upon his nature, “determined to prove a villain”, frequently throughout his soliloquies. Pacino helps modern audiences to relate to this peculiar man by using a hand held camera and quick consecutive cuts between scenes, bringing the audience into the moment. The exploration of scenes through voice overs lead to a better understanding of the play. His genuine efforts to bring Shakespeare to the streets of America result in a sense of spontaneity.
