For the first time in his lengthy career, Al Pacino dons three hats as creator, director and star of Looking for Richard. In the vein of Truffaut's Day for Night or Fellini's 8 1/2, Pacino's impassioned project intertwines the telling of Richard III -- Shakespeare's gripping drama of power, lust and betrayal -- with an intimate look at the actors' and filmmakers' processes as they grapple with their characterizations and with translating their enthusiasm for the play on to film. Pacino takes the cameras on a free-spirited comic romp through the streets of New York, to the birthplace of Shakespeare, and finally, to an emotionally-charged production of Richard III.
