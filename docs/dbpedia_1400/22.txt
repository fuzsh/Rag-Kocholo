Robert B. Redman (September 6, 1908 – June 9, 1960)[1] was an American football, basketball, and baseball player, coach, and educator. He served as the head football coach at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania from 1947 to 1951, compiling a record of 38–4 and winning three Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference champions (1948, 1949, and 1951). After leaving Bloomsburg, Redman coached football and baseball at East Orange High School in East Orange, New Jersey from 1952 to 1956. He served as the principal there from 1956 until 1960, when he was named superintendent of schools. Before assuming that role, Redman died of a heart attack at the age of 51 on June 9, 1960.[2][3] Bloomsburg's home football stadium, Robert B. Redman Stadium, was named for the coach when it opened in 1974.
