        "text": "Dear Alumni and Friends of Marywood University,\n\nIn September, we celebrated a significant milestone in the history of Marywood University — the public launch of our transformative fundraising campaign, EMPOWER. The EMPOWER Campaign is a testament to the collective spirit and dedication of our Marywood Community. The impact of your generosity empowers our students to become leaders in the workforce, in society, and in the world.\n\nThe threefold purpose of the EMPOWER campaign is the creation of scholarships, the reimagining of campus structures to provide contemporary learning spaces for our students, and the enhancement of the Marywood experience that will enrich the lives of our students. Your generosity inspires us to reach our goals and stretch far beyond. When you share in our mission, we embrace it all the more.\n\nWe never stop believing in the power of education to change lives. You’ll never know the lives you have changed because of your contribution to this campaign. However, you can be assured that somewhere, somehow, sometime it will make a positive difference for someone.\n\nThank you for being an important part of this meaningful leg of our journey. We embarked upon it at a time when people said our goals could not be reached. As the Marywood community, there is nothing we can’t do if we do it together. When the journey was begun in 1915, there were those who said it couldn’t be done. In 2023, because of you, we’re still proving them wrong.\n\nWith Gratitude,\n\nSister Mary Persico, IHM, Ed.D. ’69\n\nPresident of Marywood University\n\nAnnual Report 2022-2023\n\nUniversity and Program Distinctions\n\nMarywood University continued to offer the “Best Value” among Northeast Pennsylvania universities, according to the 2022-2023 U.S. News & World Report’s Best Colleges ranking. Marywood also remained the highest ranked of only two local institutions included in the “Best Colleges for Veterans” category, along with repeating and advancing its strong showing in the “Top Performers in Social Media” category.\n\nMarywood University was recognized as one of America’s best colleges for student voting by Washington Monthly. The 2022 honor roll recognized 230 schools out of a total 850 that received consideration. Of those on the list of 230 schools, 127 had a registration rate of 85 percent or more—compared to only 16 such schools on 2021’s honor roll. Marywood is among those institutions with a greater than 85 percent voter registration rate, thus meriting this national recognition.\n\nSeveral of Marywood’s programs earned noteworthy distinctions. The online Master of Public Administration Program ranked 30 among the best in the nation. The MFA Program ranks #4 among Top 10 in the nation. The Aviation Program ranks as #5 as “2023 Top Ten Flight Schools and Universities” in Pennsylvania.\n\nMarywood University’s 2022-2023 Military Friendly School Designation was published in the May and October issues of G.I Jobs magazine.\n\nMarywood also received NEPA's Best Places to Work for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nNew and Innovative Academic Programs\n\nA new Executive Master of Public Administration (EMPA) Program was launched to fast track graduate degree completion for those working in the public, nonprofit, and private sectors. Designed for working professionals with at least five years of post-bachelor’s degree experience, the EMPA program allows students to take graduate courses in public policy and administration without taking time off from their careers.\n\nThose who have already invested time, money, and efforts into pursuing doctoral studies, but haven’t quite finished (also known as “All But Dissertation” or ABD), now have an accelerated path to degree completion at Marywood University, even if they did their coursework at another institution. Marywood’s Ph.D. Program in Strategic Leadership and Administrative Studies offers those individuals in the ABD categorythe opportunity to finish their doctoral studies without retaking or repeating the courses already taken. The ABD pathway is designed for professionals who are seeking to complete their doctoral studies and earn their Ph.D. without taking time off from their careers.\n\nBuilding on the successof its existing Biotechnology program and meeting emerging educational and professional needs within this growing science industry, Marywood launched a completely online Biotechnology master’s degree program. Featuring a competitive, affordable pricing structure for all students, along with the convenience and flexibility of asynchronous online learning, the 32-credit program began in June 2023. The program cost is $515 per credit, making it one of the most competitively priced graduate biotechnology degree programs in the Northeast region of the U.S.\n\nCommunity-Focused Events and Outreach\n\nIn commemoration of Veterans Day, Marywood’s Office of Military and Veteran Services and its Student Veteran Alliance (SVA) honored those who are serving and those who have served our country on Friday, November 10, 2023. The event featured Jeffrey Rutter, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist and psychology professor at Marywood University and U.S. Air Force Veteran as speaker. Students Isiah Oritz played “Echo Taps” on the trumpet, while vocalist Beatrice Chindemi sang “The Star Spangled Banner.” The ceremony site featured “Flags for the Fallen,” an outdoor display of thousands of U.S. flags that honor those who have fallen while serving our country.\n\nFor the first time since the pandemic, Marywood University and Chestnut Hill College students were given the opportunity to travel to Ghana with the African Sister Education Collaborative (ASEC), to work with local schools and a center for individuals with disabilities. The trip was overseen by Dr. Yerodin Lucas, Executive Director of Equity and Inclusion.\n\nSeveral mental health screenings were held, including depression, mood disorder, and memory screenings, to connect the public to mental health resources and assist people concerned about developing signs of memory loss.\n\nThe Department of Communications and Science Disorders attended Children’s Career Day to raise awareness of different aspects of speech-pathology and audiology professions by engaging children in hands-on learning activities. Additionally, CSD Students and faculty provided hearing screenings at Scranton Treasure House, participated in an Alzheimer’s Walk, and held a Trunk or Treat for clients, friends, and family of members of the Speech and Language Clinic.\n\nMarywood University’s S.T.A.R.S. Program received a Robert H. Spitz Foundation Grant for $8,000. The S.T.A.R.S Program helps first generation Latin X students with career exploration and academic support, along with providing monthly workshops, tutoring, and providing their parents with information regarding higher education. This past year, S.T.A.R.S Program students took part in an interactive workshop at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine.\n\nThe Dialogue and Awareness Night focusing on Women’s History Month took place on Wednesday March 29, 2023. Each participating club was asked to set up a table relating to women’s history and/or women’s rights. Discussions served to help others see issues and potentially find common ground.\n\nBenefactor Events\n\nMajor Marywood benefactors were recognized at a Presidential Society Dinner. Pia Ferrario, the vice chair of the Marywood Board of Trustees, was awarded the Presidential Mission Medal and inducted into Saint Alphonsus Society. Daniel and Kathleen Damico, as well as the Pascucci Family Foundation were inducted into Saint Alphonsus Society.\n\nMarywood honored Sister Cor Immaculatum Heffernan, IHM during the 10th Annual Community Leadership Celebration held on Thursday May 4, 2023. Sister Cor received the Lead on Award, in recognition of her lifelong commitment to education, to service, and to the common good. An art auction occurred during this event that included an art piece by Sister Cor.\n\nMarywood University announced four new endowed scholarships, six new annual scholarships, and a new endowed special gift at the 2023 Scholarship Luncheon. The annual luncheon brought together students, donors, and esteemed guests to acknowledge the impact of scholarships and express heartfelt appreciation for their support. Marywood remains dedicated to fostering a vibrant community of learners, where scholarships play an instrumental role in breaking barriers and creating opportunities. The Scholarship Luncheon serves as a testament to the university's commitment to ensuring access to quality education for deserving students, regardless of their financial circumstances. Marywood awarded 389 named scholarships, exceeding one million dollars, in the 2022-2023 academic year.\n\nEvents and News on Campus\n\nMarywood University broke ground on Friday, April 28, 2023, for the Pascucci Family Health Sciences Pavilion during a 4 p.m. ceremony. The new pavilion is being named in honor of the Pascucci Family, major benefactors of the project. This exciting addition to the Keith J. O’Neill Center for Healthy Families, further expands the university’s deep commitment to health and wellness. It will be a space where health professions students can learn and grow together, sharing state-of-the-art labs, classrooms, conference areas, and the latest technologies. Construction has already begun, and the project completion is expected in the summer of 2024, in time for fall 2024 classes.\n\nMarywood joined the eight-week long Race to Zero Waste where colleges competed to make the biggest environmental impact. The goal of this event was to get students to be more environmentally conscious. The competition ended March 24.\n\nMarywood’s first-ever Kindness Week was organized by Madison “Maddie” and Elizabeth “Liz” Adams. This week was inspired by their podcast, Courageously Kind. The Adams twins started their podcast in an attempt to inspire people to be kinder to each other. Eventually Kindness Week transpired and during that week activities to inspire people to be kind took place. These activities included: taking an action of kindness from a bowl and performing it, writing an affirmation message and sticking it on the walls of the Learning Commons, writing cards to the residents at Marywood Heights, and recording kindness quotes to be read over the radio.\n\nStudent and Faculty Achievements\n\nMarywood University’s School of Architecture (MUSOA) captured second place honors in the Retrofit Housing division in the final stage of the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon® 2023 Design Challenge, which took place in Colorado on April 22, 2023.
