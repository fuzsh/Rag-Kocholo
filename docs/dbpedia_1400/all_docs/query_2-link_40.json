These tests may be used to help make early diagnosis, improve risk prediction, and target therapies for both traditional gene-based disorders as well as common chronic diseases. Thus, data are needed for public health surveillance of the utilization of gene-based tests to be able to monitor trends in use, appropriateness of use, and potential disparities in utilization. Health care policymakers, providers, and payers need data on how specific genetic tests and related interventions impact short- and long-term health outcomes, including information on cost-effectiveness. Information, however, is currently lacking on the use of gene-based tests and the outcomes of clinical interventions based on these tests.\n\nObjectives: Our objectives were twofold: (1) to conduct an assessment of existing databases in the US health care system for monitoring the utilization and outcomes of gene-based applications (including tests and related interventions) in the health care system; and (2) to provide recommendations to establish appropriate and practical systems to assess use and outcomes of gene-based clinical applications.\n\nCurrent Databases: The assessment included targeted reviews of the published and gray literature, discussions with key informants (some of whom formed a Technical Expert Panel [TEP] to provide additional guidance to the project), and information gathering about the capabilities of specific databases and surveillance systems. The project also included a small workshop in which experts and stakeholders discussed the initial findings of the assessment, gave their input on the strengths and weaknesses of different options and approaches for monitoring gene-based applications, and developed recommendations for future research and development.\n\nOnly limited, sporadic information is available on the utilization of gene-based tests over time. Some research and surveys suggest that knowledge on the part of some providers about the availability and utility of tests may be reasonably widespread and accurate. Little or nothing is known about the extent to which patients and their families are aware of tests and knowledgeable about their benefits and harms. Finally, there are few longitudinal data to indicate the benefits and risks of using genetic tests to guide interventions and medical decisions, such as in the selection of therapies, and their short- or long-term outcomes.\n\nRecommendations and Future Directions: We identified no databases that could provide all the information desired about gene-based testing broadly. Current databases might be used alone or in combination to address specific questions about gene-based testing, although whether they would provide an adequate \"monitoring\" capability remains unclear. A number of challenges will have to be addressed before the ideal of being able to compile and link data from existing health databases and surveys for public health surveillance and health services research can be realized. These include developing standard codes for genetic tests and database architecture standards to allow interoperability between databases; addressing concerns about privacy and confidentiality; and reducing the proprietary and regulatory barriers that inhibit sharing of data. The needed technical advances, such as standards to facilitate database interoperability, are beginning to be addressed by national initiatives to improve health information technology and promote personalized health care.\n\nTo further the development of databases for monitoring utilization and outcomes of gene-based applications, the following recommendations are made for additional research and development:\n\nImprove the coding of gene-based tests in many of the relevant databases so that the test type, reason for the test, and test results can be readily determined;\n\nDevelop or adopt standards for the proper collection and storage of data from genetic testing laboratories for archiving the tests performed and facilitating interoperability between databases;\n\nExplore the possibility of adding questions to ongoing surveys or developing new surveys to monitor the availability of genetic testing centers, adequate counseling, and barriers to accessing counseling services;\n\nConsider establishing a survey of genetic testing laboratories similar to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) for medical clinics and the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for hospitals; and\n\nDevelop pilot studies for a small set of diseases and tests.\n\nUltimately, the development and operation of databases and other data collection efforts to monitor utilization and outcomes of gene-based tests and related interventions will require public trust and support. This in turn will require confidence in the security built into the databases or information systems to protect personal health information and an understanding of the value of the databases in improving personal health care.\n\nKey Words: Genomic, genetic, database, laboratory testing, utilization, pharmacogenomics, health outcomes, surveillance.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nCurrent Available Databases\n\nRecommendations and Future Directions\n\nReferences\n\nGlossary\n\nAppendixes\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nThe Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing (SACGT) defined a genetic test as:\n\nâ€¦ an analysis performed on human DNA, RNA, genes, and/or chromosomes to detect heritable or acquired genotypes, mutations, phenotypes, or karyotypes that cause or are likely to cause a specific disease or condition. A genetic test is also the analysis of human proteins and certain metabolites, which are predominantly used to detect heritable or acquired genotypes, mutations, or phenotypes.1(p3)\n\nMore than 1,000 gene-based tests are now clinically available, with an additional 300 available for research purposes only (e.g., GeneTests2). By 2009, the world market for gene-based testing is expected to reach $12.5 billion.3 Much remains unknown about the effectiveness and appropriate use of these tests. Most are used for diagnosis of rare gene-based diseases, but a growing number have population-based applications, including carrier identification, predictive testing for inherited risk for common diseases, and pharmacogenetic testing for predicting drug response.\n\nWith the completion of the human genome sequence, new gene-based tests are expected to be rapidly developed; these are likely to include concurrent testing of multiple gene-based markers using microarray technologies (i.e., multiplex testing). These new tests may be used to screen populations or at-risk groups, help make early diagnosis, improve risk prediction, and target therapies for both traditional gene-based disorders and common chronic diseases. Conceivably, genetic tests might help explicate individual differences that account for disproportionate health outcomes or disparities among individuals and populations. These anticipated applications of genomic technologies have the potential for broad public health impact.\n\nUnderstanding Gene-Based Tests and Interventions\n\nCurrently, little information is available on the validity and utility of gene-based tests. Analytical validity (the ability to measure genotype accurately and reliably) and, to a lesser extent, clinical validity (the ability to detect or predict the associated disorder or phenotype) are evaluated for some tests by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). FDA regulates the sale of kits for standardized tests under its mandate to regulate medical devices. CMS monitors laboratory practices and quality under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA). Clinical utility (the net balance of risks and benefits associated with using a test in routine practice), however, has not been systematically evaluated for many gene-based tests. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began a model project in 2004â€”Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP)â€”to evaluate the evidence on validity and clinical utility of gene-based tests that are being transitioned from research to clinical and public health practice. (More information about EGAPP can be found online at http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/gTesting.htm.) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) also conducts clinical utility reviews of selected gene-based tests.4\n\nAlthough efforts such as EGAPP are under way to examine the validity and utility of gene-based tests, the need to understand the use of specific tests and gene-based clinical interventions and their short- or long-term outcomes is growing. The proliferation of new gene-based tests makes it essential that clinicians or researchers develop criteria to distinguish tests that promote health and prevent disease from those that have limited or no benefit or that may even pose harm to the public. Examining whether gene-based tests are being used appropriately for screening purposes or for diagnostic or predictive testing (e.g., based on early signs and symptoms of disease or family history) is critical, as is determining whether laboratories and clinical settings are exchanging relevant and useful information that promotes appropriate use and fosters improved patient care. The Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society (SACGHS) has endorsed the need for public health surveillance to assess the public health impact of genetic testing, including appropriate utilization and health outcomes.5\n\nMonitoring Use and Outcomes of Gene-Based Tests and Interventions\n\nDespite these federal efforts to date, very little is known about the use of gene-based tests and the outcomes of clinical interventions based on these tests. No system exists for monitoring these tests after they become part of routine health care. No agency tracks the utilization of genetic tests, whether tests are used appropriately, and the impact of the tests on clinical and public health outcomes. Postmarketing surveillance and research are needed to provide information on health care delivery, outcomes, and costs to support the translation of genetic tests into clinical practice.\n\nAs noted below, this project was concerned with understanding whether a monitoring system is needed and, if so, of what it might consist. Monitoring, in this context, might be conceptualized as a process or system for data acquisition, aggregation, and assessment. Among the capacities one might expect such a system to have is the ability to link information from disparate sources and to establish new ways to associate events, interventions, and outcomes. This capability requires an infrastructure, appropriate methods to capture data, and the inferential abilities to analyze the data to develop meaning and context. Generally, we use the term \"monitoring\" to connote this entire spectrum of qualities and resources; some apply the term \"surveillance\" to such activities, particularly in public health applications, but of course no implication of investigation of individuals is intended.\n\nMonitoring the integration of gene-based testing into health care requires a combination of approaches because no single information source on gene-based testing exists. These approaches include activities that might best be considered surveillance and others that fall more into a \"research\" framework (particularly, in this context, applied research). In either case, creating new databases, modifying existing databases, linking these databases, and making information from them readily available to administrators, regulators, researchers, and others are all critical steps. Thus, a coordinated system for monitoring gene-based testing might include analyses of administrative and clinical databases (including diagnostic, pharmacy, hospital, and health plan databases), periodic surveys of health systems including clinics and laboratories, surveys of patient populations, or collaborative outcomes research carried out by a network of research centers.\n\nWith such a monitoring system for gene-based testing and applications, policymakers and clinicians could address numerous important public health issues. Three critical topics have high priority:\n\nTest Utilization and Knowledge of Test Results. Utilization patterns include the number and type of tests performed, indications for testing, characteristics and practice setting of the providers ordering the tests, and basic demographics and health characteristics of the patients tested. Having access to reliable information of this type will allow public and private health care delivery systems to plan for increased demand for services related to genetic testing. It will also allow public health programs to identify activities that increase demand for testing, such as highly publicized cases and marketing campaigns. For example, one health maintenance organization found that referrals for genetic testing for breast cancer increased 244 percent during a direct-to-consumer marketing campaign.6 In consumer and provider surveys, CDC also found increased consumer awareness of, interest in, and requests for testing following direct-to-consumer marketing, but population data were not available to assess testing trends.7 With the introduction and proliferation of direct-to-consumer marketing of specific genetic tests and large genome-wide scans of hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), developing information on the validity and utility of such tests and making that information available to consumers and health care providers will be essential.8 Monitoring the utilization of direct-to-consumer tests will require conduct of self-report surveys rather than reliance on health care databases.\n\nThe hope is that genetic tests can help address individual differences in outcome that account for disproportionate differences or disparities among individuals and populations. Barriers to equitable access to gene-based tests and interventions, however, may arise in many circumstances. Physicians may lack access to information about the tests and their reliability, validity, and utility; be unclear when to order the tests and how to interpret them; or be resistant to using them. Patients may also fear gene-based tests and may be reluctant to agree to them. The EGAPP project is providing evidence-based information on gene-based tests. A monitoring system could address how well physicians are aware of and use the evidence-based information, and it could also address whether differences in the use of gene-based tests can be attributed to true differential access, patient choice, or other factors. For example, although several studies have shown disparities in the utilization of prenatal genetic screening tests, a recent study found few disparities in the proportion of women who reported that their health care providers discussed these tests with them.9\n\nImpact on Treatment Choices and Short-Term Clinical Outcomes. Gene-based tests and interventions will profoundly affect, in predictable and unpredictable ways, the US health care system, providers and clinicians, and patients and their families. New opportunities for interventions will be identified; current preventive interventions or treatments may be modified for some patients. A monitoring system to assess the impact of gene-based tests in guiding treatment decisions, the appropriateness of those decisions, and response to therapy (including adverse events) could provide essential information for clinicians and health care policymakers.\n\nHealth and Long-Term Outcomes. Ultimately, timely and accurate information on the impact of gene-based tests and interventions, if appropriately distributed and used, may help reduce mortality and morbidity, reduce health care costs, and improve quality of life among patients. With appropriate safeguards, this information will also allow public and private insurers to ensure that their clients have access to cost-effective tests and interventions.\n\nThe information needed to assess the utilization and impact of gene-based tests and interventions is both extensive and highly varied. It is also likely to be more sensitive to patients' and others' concerns about privacy, especially insofar as information from genetic tests for one person may have significant ramifications for his or her relatives.\n\nSimilarly, the sources of these types of information on use and outcomes of gene-based interventions will likely be diverse, reside in both the public and private sectors, and be variably accessible to decision makers and clinicians. Computerized databases of health care agencies; medical and genetic testing laboratories; and various state, regional, or national health surveys (e.g., National Health Interview Survey, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey) may serve as the source for monitoring use of tests and certain interventions, particularly those based on lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet). Administrative and insurance claims data from both public and private insurers and payers may also play an important role in these monitoring efforts. The linkage of electronic medical records with genetic test results also affords opportunities for monitoring utilization and outcomes of gene-based applications. More specific data on provider and patient knowledge about gene-based tests and interventions, the appropriateness of their use, and the benefits and harms that they pose for patients may, however, require specially focused data collection efforts.\n\nAims of the Project\n\nTo foster progress in systematic acquisition and use of information for addressing the issues related to gene-based applications, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in collaboration with the CDC, commissioned the RTI International Developing Evidence to Inform Decisions about Effectiveness (DEcIDE) Center to examine what would be needed to develop a monitoring system on genetic testing and related health care interventions in the US health care system. Clearly other forms of preventive and therapeutic strategies are critical to the levels of health and well-being in this country-and no comprehensive or single surveillance or monitoring system covers those health care interventions. Thus, in a broader policy context, readers cannot ignore issues such as the competing uses of health care resources, alternative health goals, and choices that must be made about what services to monitor for their impact on the quality and costs of health care. Nonetheless, compelling reasons exist to conduct an assessment specifically of gene-based tests and applications, including: (1) concerns about potential discrimination and the need for stringent privacy and confidentiality safeguards; (2) the implications of genetic test results for family members; (3) the increasing marketing of genetic tests directly to consumers; and (4) the immense expectations that have been generated about the potential benefits for personal health care stemming from advances in genomics.\n\nWe were thus asked to concentrate on gene-based applications, which is the focus of this report. Specifically, the project had two primary goals: first, to assess existing systems and databases for monitoring the utilization and outcomes of gene-based applications in the health care system and, second, to provide recommendations to establish appropriate and practical systems to track use and outcomes of gene-based clinical applications.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, we conducted targeted reviews of the published and gray literature, held interviews with key informants in different health-related organizations, and gathered data about the capabilities of specific databases and surveillance systems. Consistent with the SACGT definition, we took a broad view of \"genetic test\" and included both germ line and somatic testing, as well as DNA-based tests and biochemical tests that have a genetic basis. Throughout our assessment, we sought guidance from a technical expert panel (TEP).\n\nThe core activity was a small workshop to bring together experts and a small number of well-defined stakeholders; they discussed the initial findings of the assessment presented in a preliminary report, gave their input on the strengths and weaknesses of different options and approaches for monitoring gene-based applications, and considered opportunities that may evolve from new initiatives such as the increasing use of electronic medical records and the development of data standards to facilitate data linkage and sharing. An important outcome of the assessment and workshop was guidance and recommendations that federal agencies, private health organizations, academia, and others can use to set priorities in establishing monitoring systems and research activities to ensure the safe and effective integration of gene-based clinical interventions into the health care system.\n\nFollowing the workshop, we developed a draft report that was subjected to extensive eternal peer review. This final report is the ultimate product of the project.\n\nOrganization of This Report\n\nIn this report, we describe the current landscape of available administrative and clinical databases (such as diagnostic, pharmacy, hospital, health plan, and electronic health records ) and compare the information available across different databases related to gene-based testing (e.g., rates of utilization of gene-based tests, indications for testing, subsequent treatment choices, outcomes). We also briefly assess the available health services research related to the use of gene-based testing and describe the gaps in what is known about the uptake and impact of gene-based testing and other gene-based interventions for the US population. We also summarize workshop deliberations.\n\nFinally, from all these diverse sources, we develop an extensive set of recommendations for public agencies and private organizations to consider in establishing mechanisms for monitoring use and outcomes of gene-based interventions. Insofar as a comprehensive surveillance system (i.e., a single, national monitoring structure) is infeasible, we also note ways, based on rigorous research, to generate information useful for both policymaking and clinical decisionmaking.\n\nCurrent Available Databases provides an overview of our assessment process and our findings on current available databases. In Recommendations and Future Directions we discuss the implications of our findings and make recommendations for future database development and research needs.\n\nAppendix A provides details of our methods of data collection. Key informants are listed in Appendix B; Appendix C reproduces the key informants discussion guidelines-protocol. Appendices D and E give the workshop agenda and participants, respectively. Our literature search abstraction forms can be found in Appendix F. Finally, Appendix G lists additional databases that were suggested by our peer reviewers.\n\nCurrent Available Databases\n\nThe first step in the project was to conduct an assessment of current databases that might be used to monitor utilization, clinical impact, and outcomes of gene-based tests and related interventions. Data collection for the assessment comprised several related activities: reviewing both published and gray literature, conducting key informant interviews, reviewing genomics testing databases of several types, and, most critical, convening an invitational workshop to discuss issues relating to databases that could provide information on both use and outcomes of gene-based applications. This section briefly reviews our assessment methodology and then presents our findings on the assessment of current databases.\n\nOverview of Assessment Process\n\nIn this section we provide a brief overview of our assessment methodology. A detailed description of our methods can be found in Appendix A.\n\nTechnical Expert Panel\n\nAt the beginning of the project, we convened a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) to guide the development of our assessment approach and methodology. The panel comprised experts from a variety of disciplines and organizations. TEP members provided consultation on the project methodology, helped identify additional experts to participate in the workshop, and provided comments on our final report. Three TEP members were also able to participate in the invitational workshop; several others served as peer reviewers of the draft final report.\n\nReview of Peer-Reviewed Literature\n\nWe conducted a targeted literature review of the scientific literature that was intended to supplement both our gray literature search and our key informant interviews. These latter two data sources served as the primary methods of identifying relevant databases, but the scientific literature review provided some preliminary information. This activity was not meant to be a comprehensive review of the literature on the use or outcomes of gene-based tests. With more than 1,100 genetic tests in clinical use, and more than 15,000 publications on genetic screening, a complete review was beyond the scope of this project. Rather, the literature review was designed to identify:\n\nExisting information about the utilization and outcomes of gene-based tests and interventions;\n\nDatabases and resources available and their strengths and limitations for assessing utilization and outcomes of gene-based applications; and\n\nInformation regarding the optimal characteristics of a database or information network that could be used to assess the utilization and outcomes of gene-based tests and interventions.\n\nGray Literature Search\n\nThe sources for gray literature consisted of unpublished reports, news briefings, press conferences, web pages, and other information available electronically on the Internet. We appraised the documents identified through these searches for their relevance to the project. A majority of the documents addressed various aspects of genetic testing without referring to data or files containing data on genetic testing. In other cases, health information databases were cited without any specific reference to genetic testing. As a final step, we included only those documents containing information about data regarding genetic testing in this review.\n\nKey Informant Interviews\n\nRTI, with inputs from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), compiled an initial listing of individuals with knowledge of genetic databases. We included people who serve as data stewards or users of genetic testing data and completed interviews with 21 individuals (Appendix B). We sought representatives in each of five key areas: health services research, clinical laboratory management, genetics, industry (e.g., development of genetic tests), and federal agencies. We also received suggestions of other candidates who met our criteria from individuals who could not participate in the interviews but wanted to make sure that their organization or their expertise in the genetic database arena was represented. The goal of the interviews was to identify databases and mechanisms that might offer information about use of gene-based tests and interventions in health care in this country. Appendix C presents the semistructured interview protocols.\n\nLaboratory Database Review\n\nWe also sought to understand the environment of genetic laboratories and their attendant databases, computer infrastructures, and related software programs. For this part of the assessment, we focused on molecular diagnostic laboratories to identify individuals who manage genetic testing data as part of their daily operations. We initially searched websites to identify these individuals. The next step was to identify key people who had knowledge of laboratory computer infrastructure and the strategic decisionmaking process, such as laboratory directors. Appendix B lists the individuals with whom we spoke specifically about laboratory databases.\n\nInvitational Workshop\n\nRTI organized the workshop, convened October 3-4, 2007, at the AHRQ Conference Center in Rockville, Maryland. The purpose was to elicit from participants guidance or possible recommendations for linking or modifying existing database systems or developing a new data system for monitoring and other uses set out by AHRQ. The final program, which included both plenary and breakout working sessions, appears in Appendix D. Three work group sessions were organized around the main themes of the project:\n\nTest utilization and knowledge of test results.\n\nImpact on treatment choices and short-term clinical outcomes.\n\nHealth and long-term outcomes.\n\nWorkshop participants included the following: TEP members; representatives of key stakeholder groups for this topic; experts on specific topics; key staff from AHRQ, CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and other interested federal agencies, including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA); and RTI project staff. Appendix E shows the final list of participants.\n\nWe sent a preliminary draft of the current report to the participants to provide background information for the workshop deliberations. We asked workshop participants to review the initial findings in the preliminary draft report, identify strengths and weaknesses, discuss various possibilities for monitoring gene-based interventions, and consider opportunities that may be presented by developments in health information technologies, such as electronic medical records and standards for linking and sharing electronic health care data. They were also asked to propose a research agenda that would guide development of such systems and allow ongoing assessment of the use and outcomes of gene-based clinical interventions in the US health care system.\n\nMuch of the substantive work of the workshop was conducted in the three separate workgroups. To focus the workshop discussion, RTI staff provided a set of questions to the participants in a case study format. The selected case studies covered a range of issues: prevalence (common or rare), type of genetic variation (inherited or acquired), and clinical context (treatment or prevention), including two distinct examples of pharmacogenomics.\n\nThe examples were designed to focus the discussion on availability of information in the database on the following issues: (1) Patient population: asymptomatic persons or those diagnosed with a disease, (2) Test: type and results, and its utilization, (3) Impact on choice of intervention: screening/surveillance with another test such as mammography, surgery, or therapeutics, and (4) Impact on patient outcomes: mortality, morbidity. The selected case studies were intended to help identify to what extent information may be available from existing databases and to what extent we need to modify or create new databases and analytic tools.\n\nPeer Review\n\nAfter the workshop, the RTI Developing Evidence to Inform Decisions about Effectiveness (DEcIDE) team revised and completed the draft report to take account of the workshop deliberations, conclusions, and recommendations. The report was then subjected to formal, external peer review by about 17 outside experts in the field. We revised the final report based on the comments and suggestions received in the peer-review process.\n\nFindings on Current Databases\n\nWe present our findings in three sections. The first section provides a summary of the databases that were identified through the peer-reviewed and gray literature searches and the key informant interviews.\n\nThe second section provides more detailed findings on how identified databases have been used or could be used to address various questions according to the three broad purposes identified for our assessment. We follow the gene-based testing process from test awareness to health outcomes. For each step of the process, we discuss the existing information available on that step and the data sources from which that knowledge is derived; we also note other potential data sources. We describe each type of data source in detail the first time it is mentioned and then refer back to it when relevant, in subsequent steps.\n\nThe final section includes a summary assessment of current databases, including their limitations and their potential for contributing to a monitoring system for gene-based tests.\n\nIdentified Databases\n\nCharacteristics of Identified Databases. A summary of the characteristics and potential uses of databases identified in our assessment is provided in Table 1. The table presents the main categories of databases that will be described below and a few illustrative databases under each category. Key characteristics of each database are presented in the first section of table columns, including if the data are derived from a defined population, the geographic area covered by the database, the ability to link individual-level records in the database to medical records (such as an electronic medical records system), the ability to link records in the database to other public health databases (such as mortality records), and the availability of summary data. The second section of table columns (Information on Gene-based Testing Process Steps) summarizes the availability of data that would be relevant to various steps in the gene-based testing process as will be described below.\n\nTable 1.

To the extent possible, we relied on information published in the peer-reviewed literature, but much of the information on databases came from the gray literature and key informants.\n\nThrough the gray literature search, we identified one integrated electronic health record system, the Kaiser Permanente HealthConnect system that will eventually include the medical records of all Kaiser Permanente members. We also identified 18 laboratories that perform genetic tests. We identified them either directly from the Internet search or from the particularly comprehensive and informative website maintained by the University of Kansas Medical Center.10 More detailed information was available from the websites of two laboratories that provide summary information on newborn screening: the National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center11 and the Genetics Home Reference.12 Three large cancer databases were identified: the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries, a network of population-based state and regional cancer registries covering 26 percent of the United States, which maintains a pooled database; the NCI Breast and Colon Cancer Family Registries, a multi-site research infrastructure of registries of families with high cancer risk, also with a pooled database; and the Women's Environment, Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology study of breast cancer. Basic information on which genetic tests are available and clinical and laboratory directories are available from the GeneTests website (http://www.genetests.org/). A future resource is the Kaiser Permanente Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health.13\n\nThrough the gray literature search, we also identified research resources that may be useful for special studies. The Human Genetics Initiative (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-funding/grants/nimh-human-genetics-initiative.shtml) has clinical or diagnostic information and immortalized cell lines for DNA extraction. The Autism Genetic Resources Exchange has biospecimens and clinical data from families with more than one case of autism spectrum disorder.14,15\n\nFifteen databases were identified during the key informant interviews (Table 2). These databases included electronic medical record systems, research databases including large research cohorts, laboratory performance system databases, newborn screening databases, registries, and insurance claims databases.\n\nTable 2. Databases identified during key informant interviews Database Type of Database Medicare and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Linked database: claims data linked to registry data CanCORS Research cohort Cancer Research Network HMO Network Clinical and administrative Marshfield Clinic Database Clinical Marshfield Center for Human Genetics Database Research database including clinical, laboratory and genotyping data Kaiser Permanente HealthConnectâ„¢ Electronic medical record National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Scheduled survey with physical examinations Market Scan Databases Vendor integrated clinical and claims database caBIGâ„¢ Research network CAP Accreditation and Lab Improvement database Laboratory proficiency testing database Newborn screening databases (several) Public health databases with newborn screening results Cancer Family Registry Registry Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry Blue Cross/Blue Shield Databases Claims data Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan Claims data Myriad Genetics Laboratory data\n\ncaBIG, cancer bioinformatics grid; CanCORS, Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium; CAP, College of American Pathologists.\n\nOur peer reviewers also suggested several databases that may have relevant information on gene-based applications. These suggestions were received after our formal assessment had been completed, but we list the suggested databases in Appendix G.\n\nWe may well have missed some relevant databases or other potentially useful sources of ongoing information about the use and outcomes of gene-based tests. We sought to identify possible databases through focused reviews of the peer-reviewed and gray literature and key informant interviews. The workshop also identified a few additional databases. Although the review of the literature was fairly comprehensive, it identified relatively few articles that described databases that could be used for monitoring utilization and impacts of gene-based tests. The gray literature review focused on identifying websites with relevant information; again, relatively little information was identified on databases of gene-based tests. Thus, much of the information that we were able to gather on potentially relevant databases came from key informants and workshop participants. We tried to identify key informants and workshop participants covering a broad range of expertise and with knowledge of a diverse set of databases.\n\nDespite our efforts to be as comprehensive as possible in our search, we undoubtedly missed some relevant databases. Thus, our compilation of databases should not be viewed as exhaustive. For example, we focused on data from Kaiser Permanente as an example of databases from managed care organizations (MCOs) or integrated health care delivery systems. We are fully aware that similar data may be available from other MCOs, such as Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, or from other types of health plans, such as those of the family of services within the United HealthGroup umbrella. Similarly, Blue Cross Blue Shield is but one of many large insurance plans that may maintain potentially useful databases. Similarly, there are several commercial laboratory databases in addition to those we specifically mention. (A number of potentially relevant databases that were suggested by peer reviewers of this report are listed in Appendix G.) Nonetheless, we believe that we have fairly completely captured the various categories of databases. Although the listing may be incomplete, the specific databases that we identified can be considered exemplars of databases in each category.\n\nEssentially no evidence base exists about the value of gene-based tests or interventions. Many, if not most, of the gene-based tests that are currently available have not been evaluated for their efficacy, effectiveness, or cost-effectiveness. We were concerned only with identifying databases that could be used to monitor utilization and impacts of the tests. We make no judgments on the utility of the tests, which is the focus of the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) program at the CDC.\n\nCurrent and Potential Uses of Existing Databases\n\nIn this section, we present our findings on the existing information and data sources on gene-based testing and related interventions and outcomes, organized by the three main categories of our assessment and specific questions within those categories (Table 3).\n\nTable 3. Three assessment categories and related questions for the gene-based testing process\n\nTest utilization and knowledge of test results\n\nPhysician and patient awareness\n\nScreening criteria\n\nScreening tests\n\nInterpretation and followup of screening tests\n\nDiagnostic testing\n\nInterpretation of diagnostic tests\n\nImpact on treatment choices and short-term clinical outcomes\n\nAppropriate clinical management of patients\n\nAppropriate family followup\n\nHealth and long-term outcomes\n\nFor each step of the process, we list \"questions of interest,\" which AHRQ had suggested in the initial request for the project, that a monitoring system might be able to answer. We then discuss the existing information available for that step and describe the data sources from which that knowledge is derived. We classify sources as:\n\nPublic health databases\n\nElectronic medical records\n\nClinical databases\n\nLaboratory databases\n\nAdministrative databases\n\nScheduled surveys\n\nPoint-in-time surveys\n\nOngoing research cohorts\n\nRegistries\n\nOther sources, and\n\nLinked databases.\n\nEach data source or type of data source is described in detail the first time it is mentioned, when relevant in subsequent steps, we refer readers back to those initial descriptions.\n\nTest Utilization and Knowledge of Test Results\n\nPhysician and Patient Awareness\n\nQuestions of Interest. A monitoring system might answer the following questions related to physician and patient awareness:\n\nDo providers have access to information about the validity and utility of tests?\n\nDo patients have access to tests?\n\nAre there disparities in access?\n\nExisting Information. Before a gene-based testing protocol can be implemented, either the physician or the patient must be aware of the test and interested in determining if it is applicable to the patient. We identified 12 articles that provided information on physician or patient awareness of one or more genetic tests.16-27 The articles were published between 2000 and 2004 and reported on data from 1998 to 2001.\n\nMountcastle-Shah and Holtzman reported that 75 percent of primary care physicians (45 of 60) in the Washington, DC, area, who were interviewed in 1999, knew that carrier testing for cystic fibrosis was available; 90 percent knew that a test was available to identify an inherited susceptibility for breast cancer.16 Batra et al. found that 34 percent of gastroenterologists in New York were aware that a test was available for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC); 52 percent were aware of the test for familial adenomatous polyposis.17 Chase et al. reported that among physicians who treated patients enrolled in a genetic linkage study of Alzheimer's disease, 65 percent were aware of the test for apolipoprotein E (APOE, a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease in symptomatic individuals) and 37 percent were aware of the presenilin 1 test (a susceptibility or diagnostic test for use in families with multiple cases of early-onset Alzheimer's disease).18\n\nCho et al. reported that physicians who requested information or ordered a BRCA1/2 test at the University of Pennsylvania between October 1995 and October 1997 had learned about the test from journals (54 percent), professional meetings (47 percent), colleagues (29 percent), the lay media (11 percent), patients (4 percent), and other sources (10 percent).19 Advertising also was found to increase awareness of gene-based tests. CDC found that, in 2003, both physician and patient awareness of BRCA1/2 testing was higher in Denver and Atlanta, where an advertising campaign had been conducted, than in Raleigh-Durham and Seattle, where no advertising campaign had taken place.7 Physician awareness was 44 percent in Atlanta, 39 percent in Denver, 29 percent in Raleigh-Durham, and 18 percent in Seattle. Twenty-eight percent of physicians in Atlanta, but only 10 percent of physicians in Raleigh-Durham, reported that their patients had asked about testing.\n\nOne-third of physicians who treated Alzheimer's disease patients had received literature on APOE testing; slightly more than one-tenth had received literature on presenilin testing. Respectively, these figures represent approximately two-thirds of the physicians who had heard of APOE testing (65 percent) and one-third of those who had heard of presenilin testing.18 Wideroff et al. reported that physicians who had received advertising for cancer susceptibility tests were twice as likely to have ordered a test as those who had not received advertising.20\n\nPatient awareness is a major factor in the use of gene-based tests. Primary care practitioners in the Cincinnati region reported that patient interest was among the strongest motivations to refer patients for evaluation for hereditary breast cancer.21 Forty-four percent of HMO-affiliated primary care clinicians in southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey reported that a patient had asked about cancer susceptibility testing. Among providers who reported that a patient had asked about testing, 70 percent actually ordered a cancer susceptibility test or referred a patient for testing; among those who had not been asked about testing by a patient, 11 percent ordered a test.22\n\nAfter an advertising campaign for BRCA1/2 testing, physicians in Atlanta and Denver reported that patient requests for referrals and for testing increased and that they had ordered more BRCA1/2 tests.7 Friedman et al. reported that 51 percent of primary care physicians in Texas had discussed cancer susceptibility testing when a patient initiated the inquiry, 51 percent had initiated a discussion of cancer susceptibility testing, and almost 30 percent had never discussed cancer susceptibility testing.23 Wideroff et al. reported that physicians whose patients had asked about cancer susceptibility testing within the past year were more than 5 times as likely to report having requested a cancer susceptibility test.20\n\nFifty-four percent of US obstetricians and gynecologists reported that they offer carrier screening for cystic fibrosis if a patient requests it; 13 percent routinely offer carrier testing.24 Among the 22 percent of US obstetricians and gynecologists who do not routinely discuss aneuploidy screening, 74 percent discuss it if the patient initiates discussion.25 Among the one-third who do not discuss carrier screening for heritable disorders with all patients, 53 percent discussed it if the patient initiated discussions.25\n\nNearly two-thirds of obstetricians and gynecologists provided informational pamphlets on preconceptional screening, and more than one-third provided pamphlets on breast or ovarian cancer susceptibility testing.26 Among New York gastroenterologists, 64 percent discussed genetic testing occasionally, 8 percent frequently, and 28 percent never.17\n\nData Sources. Existing information regarding physician and patient awareness of gene-based testing is drawn from surveys of physicians. Obtaining such data routinely through point-in-time surveys may be possible. Collecting such information would be difficult using any methodology other than surveys. Ongoing research may be another mechanism for extending knowledge about awareness and existing information.\n\nPublic Health Databases. Public health databases are compiled for a public health purpose, such as population screening or surveillance of one or more diseases, exposures, or risk factors. Some examples of public health databases are newborn screening databases, lead surveillance databases, and reportable disease surveillance files. We identified no public health databases with information on physician, population, or patient awareness of gene-based tests.\n\nElectronic Medical Records. Electronic medical records may provide inferential data on physician awareness of gene-based tests, but they do not provide data on patient awareness of gene-based tests.\n\nClinical Databases. No clinical databases were identified that provide satisfactory information on physician or patient awareness.\n\nLaboratory Databases. No laboratory databases were identified that provide information on physician or patient awareness.\n\nAdministrative Databases. Administrative databases do not provide information on physician or patient awareness.\n\nScheduled Surveys. Two articles used data from the NCI Physician Survey on Cancer Susceptibility Testing, a nationally representative survey of physicians in selected specialties. NCI conducted the survey, which questioned physicians about their practices and attitudes regarding cancer susceptibility testing, in 1996 and 2001.20,27 This survey could be incorporated into an ongoing surveillance system on gene-based tests to provide information on physicians' knowledge of gene-based tests if NCI plans to repeat it periodically.\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducts two annual surveys of outpatient clinics: the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). The NAMCS is a national survey of physicians that yields information about the provision and use of ambulatory medical care services based on a sample of patient visits to physicians engaged primarily in direct patient care. The current instrument does not collect any information on gene-based testing, but the section on testing could be expanded, or a gene-based testing supplement, as is currently being done for a cervical cancer screening supplement, could be developed. NAMCS public use data files are available.28 NHAMCS collects data on ambulatory care services provided through hospital emergency and outpatient departments. The NHAMCS instruments do not collect information on gene-based testing, but the instruments could be expanded or a supplement could be developed.29\n\nUsing existing national health surveys to collect information on the general awareness and attitudes about gene-based testing among the general population and some subpopulations is possible, although few surveys currently collect such information. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a cross-sectional household interview survey of approximately 43,000 households, including about 106,000 persons, conducted annually. NHIS monitors the health of the US population on a broad range of health topics.30\n\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provides much broader information than NHIS. The NHANES detailed interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical and dental examinations, physiological measurements, and laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel. The survey has become continuous, with a changing focus that addresses emerging health topics. The sample size, however, is limited to about 5,000 persons each year.31\n\nThe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an on-going survey conducted by state and territorial health departments that produces more than 350,000 interviews per year. The BRFSS tracks health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and hypertension and risk behaviors such as health care access, alcohol and tobacco use, obesity, cancer screening, and nutrition and physical activity.32 The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), an ongoing survey of women with a recent live birth, could be a source of data on patient knowledge and awareness of prenatal or neonatal gene-based tests.9\n\nPoint-in-Time Surveys. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) maintains the Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network, a volunteer sample of obstetricians and gynecologists who are willing to be surveyed on knowledge and practices; three of the studies that we identified on this topic used this source.24-26 The survey panel was designed to be representative of the population of US obstetricians and gynecologists and it may be a resource for relatively quick surveys of gene-based testing knowledge or attitudes in the obstetrical and gynecological communities.\n\nOngoing Research Cohorts. Ongoing longitudinal prospective studies or research collaboration could provide data on several aspects of gene-based testing. An example of such a study is the Framingham Heart Study, which has studied cardiovascular disease since 1948. The study follows participants over a long period of time and collects detailed information from participants, including medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. This study may contain information related to awareness of gene-based testing, or if not, could collect such information with the researchers' collaboration. The study is currently recruiting a Generation III cohort.\n\nRegistries. Some registries may serve as a sampling frame for surveys of patient awareness, although they do not routinely collect such information.\n\nOther Sources. The Cancer Research Network consists of research programs, enrolled populations, and data systems of 12 health maintenance organizations (HMOs) nationwide. As part of its early detection cancer research programs, the Network has the potential to collect information on patient and physician awareness regarding gene-based testing.\n\nLinked Databases. No databases were identified that could be linked to provide information on physician or patient awareness.\n\nScreening Criteria\n\nQuestions of Interest. A monitoring system might answer the following question related to screening criteria: Are patients referred appropriately for gene-based testing?\n\nExisting Information. For this report, we defined screening criteria as a questionnaire or other clinical tool that determines who should be referred for screening or diagnostic gene-based testing. Screening criteria for many conditions are based on family history information, although tests may also apply to entire segments of the population (such as pregnant women) or be based on disease symptoms.\n\nMany physicians do not collect the information that they would need to assess whether patients meet the criteria for relevant gene-based tests. Wilkins-Haug found that 24 percent of US obstetricians and gynecologists reported that they did no assessment of family history or DNA-based testing.26 Morgan et al. found that only 48 percent routinely asked their nonpregnant patients about family history, although an additional 35 percent asked about family history if the women were trying to get pregnant.24 Although 89 percent of obstetricians and gynecologists ask their pregnant patients about a family history of cystic fibrosis, only 36 percent asked women who were trying to get pregnant about a family history of cystic fibrosis.24 Only 13 percent routinely asked their nonpregnant patients about a family history of cystic fibrosis.\n\nSummerton and Garwood found that although the majority of the British physicians they surveyed felt that family history was important in decisionmaking in several clinical scenarios, fewer than half collected family history information on any of the specified conditions except coronary heart disease.33 Screening criteria for cancer susceptibility testing can be guided by cancer history, including the age at diagnosis, in first-, second-, and third-degree relatives. Almost all primary care physicians and gastroenterologists surveyed on this issue reported that they collect data on first-degree relatives (90 percent and 99 percent, respectively), but only 56 percent of primary care providers and 76 percent of gastroenterologists collected data on second-degree relatives.17,22 Only 39 percent of gastroenterologists collected data for third-degree relatives.17\n\nThe simplest screening criteria are those that apply to an entire population, such as newborn or prenatal screening. For more than 10 years, clinical practice guidelines have recommended that all pregnant women be offered screening for neural tube defects and Down syndrome.34 In 2004, only 78 percent of US obstetricians and gynecologists routinely discussed aneuploidy screening with their patients.25 A higher percentage discussed aneuploidy screening with women with an identified risk factor, such as advanced maternal age (92 percent), a significant medical or family history (85 percent), or an abnormal ultrasound (80 percent). Eighty-six percent of women in a large multistate study who began care in the first trimester reported receiving information on genetic screening.9 Women under 18, Spanish-speaking women, and women whose prenatal care was not covered by insurance were less likely to have received information on genetic screening than other women. Among women in central New York who received care in hospital or community clinic settings, African-American women were less likely than white women to be offered a maternal serum-alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) test.35\n\nIn 1997, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference recommended that carrier screening for cystic fibrosis be offered to all couples planning a pregnancy or seeking prenatal care, to adults with a family history of cystic fibrosis, and to partners of persons with cystic fibrosis.12 In 2004, only 67 percent of US obstetricians and gynecologists reported that they discussed carrier screening for heritable diseases with all their patients.25 Eighty-eight percent discussed carrier testing if a woman had a family history of a heritable disease, but only 58 percent discussed it with women whose partners had a heritable disease. According to Morgan et al., 13 percent of US obstetricians and gynecologists routinely offer cystic fibrosis screening to their nonpregnant patients, 18 percent would offer testing in all scenarios covered by the screening guidelines, but 19 percent never offer cystic fibrosis screening to their patients. 24 Almost two-thirds of obstetricians and gynecologists offer cystic fibrosis carrier screening to all their pregnant patients, and only 2.2 percent said they never offer cystic fibrosis carrier screening. Of those who offered testing in some scenarios, however, only 27 percent offered screening in all scenarios covered by the screening guidelines.24\n\nCarrier screening may also be performed when it is not recommended. One national testing laboratory reported a 30-fold increase in testing for Fragile X syndrome between 1992 and 2006, with most of the increase occurring during the most recent years because of increased testing of adult women.36 Very few males or females were tested because of a positive family history, and the authors concluded that the increase could be attributed to population-based carrier screening, which is not currently recommended by any professional organization.36\n\nGene-based testing screening criteria for conditions that can be either familial or sporadic, such as breast or colorectal cancer or Alzheimer's disease are more complex. The Amsterdam I and II criteria are used to identify families that should have gene sequencing performed to identify hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes.37,38 The Bethesda Guidelines identify which tumors with colorectal cancer should be tested for microsatellite instability, a marker of HNPCC colorectal tumors.37 Kievit et al. conducted a meta-analysis of the sensitivity (the probability that a person with the condition of interest is identified by the screening test or guidelines) and predictive value positive (the probability that a person with a positive screening test or who meets the guideline criteria has the condition of interest) of these criteria. They found considerable heterogeneity among articles in both the sensitivity and predictive value of the Amsterdam criteria I with regard to identifying mutations; sensitivity ranged from 54 percent to 91 percent, and predictive value positive ranged from 62 percent to 84 percent. For the Amsterdam criteria II with regard to identifying mutations, sensitivity was 78 percent and positive predictive value ranged from 46 percent to 68 percent. The Bethesda guidelines, which identify patients whose tumors exhibit microsatellite instability as probable cases of HNPCC, had a sensitivity of 89 percent and predictive value positive of 53 percent.37 A more complete description of the performance of various types of screening for HNPCC is available from a recent evidence-based review.39\n\nLynch et al. illustrated in several case scenarios the difficulty of applying these criteria in clinical practice.38 Rarer mutations in mutation repair genes can result in atypical HNPCC presentation, or atypical presentation of other familial cancer syndromes can result in HNPCC phenocopies.38 Physicians may fail to apply the screening criteria appropriately, either because they are not knowledgeable about genetic cancer syndromes or because they collect insufficient family history.38 Seventy-nine percent of gastroenterologists could recognize pedigree as strongly suggestive of HNPCC.17 Almost 91 percent of physicians who were aware of APOE testing for Alzheimer's disease understood that it should not be used for testing asymptomatic individuals. However, only 39 percent of physicians who were aware of the presenilin 1 test understood that it is an appropriate screening test for asymptomatic individuals who are under 50 years of age and have many family members with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.18\n\nData Sources. Existing information on physicians' knowledge and application of screening criteria for gene-based testing is based on data from clinical and laboratory databases and physician surveys.\n\nPublic Health Databases. Birth defects surveillance program data and vital statistics data could be combined to provide information on the appropriate application of prenatal screening. The Central New York Regional Perinatal Data System (RPDS), which is a population-based birth registry that includes information on demographics, antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care, and neonatal outcomes, has been used for this purpose.35 Similar data systems are available for other regions of New York. The RPDS and similar databases could be used to monitor utilization and outcomes of pregnancy-associated gene-based tests.\n\nElectronic Medical Records. Linked electronic medical records are a potential source of data for almost all aspects of gene-based testing, including adherence to screening criteria. As one example, Kaiser Permanente's electronic health record system, KP HealthConnectâ„¢, is a comprehensive health information system that includes one of the most advanced electronic health records available in the United States. When fully deployed, the data system will have information on 8.6 million people; it will capture data from the physician's office, the hospital, the radiology department, the laboratory, and the pharmacy. It is an integrated data system; similar data are maintained in all facilities within a region and then synchronized across the region. Its primary purpose is to improve the quality of care and service to KP members. The database could provide extensive information on genetic testing services for Kaiser's patients. Kaiser Permanente of Northern California has five genetic centers with medical geneticists with subspecialty training, molecular and cytogenetics laboratories, genetic counselors, genetic nurses, and metabolic nutritionists. The program includes prenatal screening and diagnostic services, neonatal screening, multispecialty clinics for common genetic disorders, and adult genetic services, including cancer genetics, clinical genetics, and carrier screening.13\n\nClinical Databases. Lynch et al. drew their case studies' clinical records from their own practice and those of colleagues in a neighboring state.38 The studies included in the meta-analysis by Kievit et al. were based on clinical records and research studies.37\n\nNCI maintains the Cancer Research Network (CRN), a network of 12 large health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that use the group or staff model of service provision, with combined memberships of 11 million people. The HMOs provide annual clinical and administrative database updates. Currently 8 or 9 years of data are available. The overall goal of the CRN is to conduct research on cancer prevention, early detection, treatment, long-term care, and surveillance. Data elements commonly used on multiple CRN projects are identified and prioritized through a data mapping initiative. Conceptual and operational definitions of the variables are established; from these definitions, analysts write computer programs that can be used at all sites to extract data. Ultimately a library of programs and macros will be created. Through this effort, CRN sites are also able to identify limitations to data, including quality and availability, and other idiosyncrasies (personal communication, Arnold Potosky, Ph.D., NIH, Health Services and Economics Branch, Applied Research Program, July 31, 2007).\n\nLaboratory Databases. Laboratory databases may include information on family history or the reason for the test, although at least one laboratory, Quest Diagnostics, finds that the indication for testing is rarely provided.36 Information on the testing indication and the appropriateness of testing can sometimes be inferred from other information in the database, as in the discussion of changing trends in Fragile X testing by Strom et al.36 The potential role of laboratory databases as a component of a surveillance system on gene-based tests is discussed in more detail in the next section.\n\nAdministrative Databases. Administrative databases are usually not specific enough to provide information on the correct application of screening criteria. Some databases, however, may contain codes for genetic counseling or the collection of family history.\n\nScheduled Surveys. PRAMS, an ongoing survey of women with a recent live birth, includes questions on the provision of information regarding genetic screening during prenatal care.9 Questions on sickle cell testing are being considered for inclusion on the new questionnaire. (personal communication, Tonya Stancil, Ph.D., DC, August 18, 2007). This survey accepts question submissions from the public health community and may be a source of data about prenatal or neonatal gene-based tests.\n\nPoint-in-Time Surveys. Most of the existing information on the use of screening criteria and physicians' understanding of risk are based on point-in-time surveys that are conducted for a specific research project and that examine screening criteria for a specific condition. The populations surveyed are frequently limited to a small or specific group of physicians.\n\nOngoing Research Cohorts. Clinical data sets that are supplemented with genetic information for research purposes may also provide useful data. One large HMO currently maintains such a database through its research foundation; a second is designing a similar database.\n\nThe Center for Human Genetics at the Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation maintains the Personalized Medicine Research Project, a population-based biobank with nearly 20,000 subjects ages 18 years and older, access to electronic medical records to classify phenotype, as well as DNA, plasma, and serum samples. The Kaiser Permanente Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health is designed to identify genes and other factors that can lead to disease or affect a person's response to medications. The project will include background, medical, lifestyle, and genetic information for as many as 500,000 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members who are representative of the population. The data will be combined with their medical history records in a database that will allow research on many hereditary diseases, including cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, diabetes, and reproductive problems.14\n\nSimilar initiatives are under way at other organizations (http://www.aspe.hhs.gov/PHC/rfi/), such as Intermountain Healthcare in Utah and surrounding states (http://intermountainhealthcare.org/xp/public/) and Partners HealthCare in Boston (http://www.partners.org/).\n\nRegistries. No registries of patients or families with genetic diseases include sufficient clinical information to assess whether screening criteria for gene-based testing have been appropriately applied.\n\nOther Sources. None was identified.\n\nLinked Databases. None was identified. Patient-level linkage of clinic and laboratory data would be required.\n\nScreening Tests\n\nQuestions of Interest. A monitoring system might answer the following questions related to screening tests:\n\nWhat gene-based tests are being used and how frequently are they used?\n\nWhat health care providers order gene-based tests and where are these providers located?\n\nAre there changes over time in the types of tests and the frequency at which they are ordered?\n\nAre laboratories receiving the information needed to conduct and interpret the test from health care providers?\n\nDo providers have access to evidence-based information about the validity and utility of gene-based tests?\n\nDo patients have access to gene-based tests? Are there disparities in access to gene-based tests and are there underserved populations?\n\nAre referrals for gene-based testing appropriate based on indications such as family history and early signs and symptoms of disease?\n\nExisting Information. For this report, we defined screening tests as tests on asymptomatic people to identify people who have an increased risk of developing or having a disease. Screening tests include population-based screening tests, such as prenatal or newborn screening and carrier screening tests.\n\nNewborn screening programs in the United States began in the 1960s with the development of a screening test for phenylketonuria. States routinely test blood spots collected from newborns for up to 30 metabolic and genetic diseases; the four most commonly included are phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism, galactosemia, and sickle cell disease. To encourage uniform and comprehensive newborn screening throughout the United States, HRSA issued a report in 2005 that recommends screening for 29 conditions.40 Disorders detected through newborn screening are described at NIH's Genetics Home Reference.12\n\nTen percent of 60 primary care physicians interviewed in 1999 in the DC area had ordered a cystic fibrosis carrier test.16 Among US obstetricians surveyed in 2003, carrier screening varied by the patient's plans for pregnancy.24 Strom et al. reported on 335,204 postnatal tests for cystic fibrosis conducted by Quest Diagnostics from July 2001 through 2003.41 They were unable to separate tests for carrier status and diagnostic tests, but the majority was believed to be carrier screening tests. They identified 10,139 carriers, for a frequency of 1:33, and 239 homozygotes. Four homozygotes who were asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms were apparently identified serendipitously.\n\nQuest also conducts a panel of tests for eight diseases that are prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews, including cystic fibrosis. Quest conducted 2,427 of these panel tests before 2004 (exact time period covered is unclear). Of the tested individuals, 14 percent were carriers of one of the tested diseases and 0.8 percent were carriers of two. No information was reported on trends in the use of testing or on the demographics of those tested.42\n\nStrom et al. discussed Quest Diagnostic's experience with Fragile X testing from 1992 through 2006.36 They conducted 1,192,323 postnatal tests during this period. Testing volume increased 30-fold; the sex ratio of persons tested reversed over the 14-year period. During the first 7 years, the male:female ratio was 2:1, but by the end of the reported period the ratio had become 1:1.5. The relative mean age of males (8.1 years) and females (28.3 years) tested suggests that testing for males is primarily diagnostic, whereas testing for females is primarily carrier testing. Among tested females, the prevalence rates were 0.61 percent for a full Fragile X mutation, 1.69 percent for premutations, and 2.16 percent for gray zone mutations.\n\nIn August 2004, 78 percent of obstetricians in the Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network routinely discussed aneuploidy screening with all their pregnant patients.25 Fifty-five percent offered first trimester screening tests: 7 percent offered maternal serum screening (free Î²-human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A); 15 percent offered nuchal transparency ultrasound; and 33 percent offered combined maternal serum and ultrasound screening. More than 99 percent offered second trimester screening tests: 49 percent offered the quad screen (MSAFP, hCG, unconjugated estriol, inhibin-A); 44 percent offered the triple screen (MSAFP, hCG, unconjugated estriol); 6 percent offered integrated first and second trimester screening; and less than 1 percent offered the double screen (MSAFP and hCG).\n\nTwo Australian studies provide examples of the potential for building a monitoring system through linked databases.43,44 Muller et al. reported on trends in the utilization of different types of Down syndrome screening from 1995 to 2005.43 They did not find any significant trend over the period in the total proportion of women screened, which ranged from 69 percent to 79 percent. Major changes in the type of screening occurred, however. Second trimester screening declined from 75 percent of confinements in 1995 to 25 percent in 2005, while first trimester screening increased from 0.8 percent of confinements in 2000 to 49 percent of confinements in 2005.\n\nThis article also provided data on testing outcomes, at least in regard to clinical validity.43 Changes in the type of testing did not affect sensitivity; 74 percent of cases were detected overall, with no significant trend over time. By 2005, however, fewer than half as many invasive tests were performed to diagnosis one Down syndrome fetus (57 percent reduction) or one aneuploid fetus (68 percent reduction) than at the peak in 1996.\n\nO'Leary et al. reported on the clinical validity of first trimester screening for Down syndrome.44 The screening protocol used 1:300 risk of Down syndrome as a cutoff. The detection rate for Down syndrome was 83 percent and the false-negative rate was 1 in 2,277 tests. The positive predictive value was 1 case for every 17.5 positive screening tests for Down syndrome and 1 case for every 3.8 positive screening tests for all congenital defects. It identified 25 percent of all congenital defects.\n\nIn the United States, Benn and Ying examined the benefit of adding a screening protocol for Turner Syndrome (45, X) to existing screening protocols for chromosome abnormalities.45 Detection did not improve, and the false-positive rate was significantly increased.\n\nData Sources. Data on the utilization of screening tests come from several sources.\n\nPublic Health Databases. All states maintain a newborn screening database; some have a genetic services plan.11 The National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center (NNSGRC), which is a cooperative agreement between HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), Genetic Services Branch, and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Department of Pediatrics, provides data on newborn genetic tests. NNSGRC maintains the National Newborn Screening Information System (NNSIS) database, which is a state self-reported Internet-based, real-time information collection and reporting system for capturing state and territorial newborn screening information. The system provides reports on the numbers of cases and births and puts out a series of reports on newborn screening programs.\n\nElectronic Medical Records. Electronic medical records systems may provide data on screening tests. The Veterans Administration (VA) uses a single electronic medical record, called VistA, in more than 1,300 sites. A similar system is used in Department of Defense facilities. Linkage between the two systems is currently underway. All VA patient records are accessible to any facility within the system through Web-based access. MEDCINÂ®, the knowledge engine underlying the VA and Department of Defense systems, has more specific coding of laboratory tests than other coding systems, but the codes may still not be specific enough for monitoring genetic tests. The system incorporates the patient's health history, medications, laboratory testing, and other diagnostic testing. The KP Health Connectâ„¢ electronic medical record system was described above under screening criteria.\n\nClinical Databases. Clinical databases were not used for the studies of screening test utilization that we reviewed. Clinical databases, such as the CRN database described above, could provide information on the course of gene-based screening and testing for patients, as in the two Australian studies discussed above.43,44\n\nLaboratory Databases. Four studies were drawn from a testing laboratory database.36,41,42,45 Laboratory databases contribute key data to monitoring gene-based tests, but they have both strengths and drawbacks. For some gene-based tests, only one laboratory provides the test, so their data on that test are population based. Other tests are offered by many laboratories; thus, including data from all providers of a certain test may be difficult.\n\nAccessing genetic testing data to be combined for surveillance may face additional difficulties. For example, these laboratories tend not to be open to sharing data, partly because of patient privacy issues but also because of their own concerns about data control and proprietary issues (e.g., the possibility that others might be able to compute market share is a barrier to sharing).\n\nAlthough compiling information about genetic testing data from all laboratories was neither possible nor intended given the scope of this review, briefs about selected laboratories involved in genetic testing are outlined below. The GeneTests website (www.genetests.org) provides probably the most complete list of laboratories conducting gene-based testing. Two large commercial laboratories conducting gene-based tests are LabCorp, including their subsidiary National Genetics Institute, and Quest Diagnostics.\n\nLabCorp is one of the world's largest clinical laboratories and offers a broad range of genomic tests. Their molecular genetics testing center was involved with the original research and subsequent standardization of Her-2Neu testing for breast cancer. The National Genetics Institute (NGI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Laboratory Corporation of AmericaÂ® Holdings (LabCorpÂ®) provides advanced clinical genetics testing services for blood screening, medical testing, and clinical research.46 Like most other testing laboratories, NGI does not make any data public.\n\nQuest Diagnostics is among the nation's leading providers of gene-based medical testing, with a focus on infectious diseases, oncology, and hereditary conditions. It was the first commercial laboratory to offer several gene-based tests, including HIV resistance testing, national availability of the HER2 gene test for breast cancer patients, and human papillomavirus reflex testing. Quest's key areas of focus include commercialization of diagnostic applications in functional genomics (the analysis of genes and their functions) and proteomics (the discovery of new proteins).47\n\nAdministrative Databases. CMS allows limited use of beneficiary claims data under a series of procedures, depending on the level of personal identifiable information. The available data do not appear to contain the specific or longitudinal information needed to monitor gene-based testing. Administrative codes, such as International Classification of Diseases (ICD), are usually not specific enough for such purposes.\n\nThe 38 Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans each have a database to track claims filed by health care providers for services rendered to plan enrollees. In addition, these plans examine utilization, the appropriateness of care delivery, and outcomes of care. Some plans flag genetic tests using S codes (temporary codes until Common Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes become available) and BRCA diagnoses. Each plan's database includes the standard claims information-laboratory codes, S-Codes (temporary), CPT codes and some aggregators for procedural codes that identify a set of procedures that constitute a specific genetic test. Other modifiers provide more information about the test and the condition for which the test was given, but the plans do not necessarily include them in their information systems. Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) databases provide information on all federal employees and the covered health services that they receive. Non-FEHBP data could be provided, but access would have to be investigated with each individual plan.\n\nScheduled Surveys. No article with data on utilization of screening tests used scheduled surveys. Several states have attempted to use PRAMS to examine the use of newborn hearing screening but, to our knowledge, no attempt has been made to validate the results.\n\nThe Medicare Health Outcomes Survey is used to gather valid and reliable health status data on Medicare managed care beneficiaries for use in quality improvement activities, plan accountability, public reporting, and improving health. All managed care plans with Medicare Advantage (MA) contracts must participate. A random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, who were continuously enrolled for a 6-month period, is drawn from each participating plan and surveyed every spring (i.e., a survey is administered to a different baseline cohort, or group, each year). Two years later, these same respondents are surveyed again for follow-up measurement. Effective in 2007, the plan sample size was increased to 1,200. This survey could potentially be linked to Medicare claims data to monitor outcomes in patients who have had a gene-based test, although the sample size is probably insufficient to address outcomes of uncommon gene-based disorders. Additionally, young people are poorly represented in this population.\n\nPoint-in-Time Surveys. Single point-in-time surveys were the source of most of the data on US screening test utilization.\n\nOngoing Research Cohorts. None was identified.\n\nRegistries. None was identified with data on gene-based testing.\n\nOther Sources. NCI has launched the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Gridâ„¢ (caBIGâ„¢) initiative to link researchers, physicians, and patients throughout the cancer community. caBIGâ„¢ is a voluntary network that enables the collection, analysis, and sharing of data and knowledge along the entire research pathway from laboratory bench to patient bedside. This network could serve as a source of information on gene-based testing or advise on the collection of information regarding gene-based testing.48 None was identified.\n\nLinked Databases. Both Australian studies cited earlier linked laboratory and public health databases, including data from antenatal and neonatal screening programs, cytogenetics laboratories, ultrasound facilities, birth and abortion registries, and birth defects registries.43,44 Although not reported in either analysis, the databases used in these studies should also be able to provide information on pregnancy outcome and, possibly, on complications and treatment decisions and outcomes for live born infants.\n\nLaboratory testing in the United States is less centralized, which would complicate any attempt for a similar data linkage. Newborn genetics screening and birth certificates are linked in some states, although not many.49 Further linking these data to those of genetics laboratories and ultrasound facilities, particularly in regions that have one or two major providers, might be possible.\n\nNineteen states have a genetic services plan listed in the NNSIS. Some genetics services plan to discuss integration of data, but the outlook was not promising in the states reviewed (Georgia and Texas).\n\nInterpretation and Followup of Screening Tests\n\nQuestions of Interest. A monitoring system might answer the following questions related to the interpretation and followup of screening tests:\n\nAre referrals for gene-based testing appropriate based on indications such as family history and early signs and symptoms of disease?\n\nAre patients receiving appropriate counseling about the implications of taking the tests and about test results?\n\nAre health care providers receiving from laboratories the information needed to interpret correctly test results and implications for their patients?\n\nExisting Information. Physician uncertainty about risk factors for disease and the magnitude of risk associated with susceptibility genes may contribute to inappropriate screening practices. In one study, physicians who treated patients with Alzheimer's disease were surprisingly inaccurate in estimating the lifetime risk of this disorder in patients with or without an affected parent and in identifying risk factors for the disease;18 30 percent to 45 percent identified risk factors associated with other forms of dementia as a possible cause of Alzheimer's disease.18\n\nCleary-Goldman et al. reported the following levels of knowledge among surveyed obstetricians:25 46 percent knew the risk of a 40 year-old patient having a liveborn child with Down syndrome; 23 percent knew the risk of aneuploidy associated with a first trimester cystic hygroma; 40 percent could identify the second trimester maternal serum results associated with an increased risk of Down syndrome; and 30 percent could identify how much a woman's age-related Down syndrome risk drops if an ultrasound of the fetus is normal.25\n\nLynch et al. reported a case in which multiple family members had colorectal cancer, strongly indicating a diagnosis of HNPCC.38 The proband was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 45. At age 57, she developed vaginal bleeding but was told by her physician, who apparently did not recognize her high risk of endometrial cancer, that the bleeding was the result of a \"vaginal yeast infection.\"\n\nMany physicians are aware of their uncertainty in interpreting genetic screening and testing information for their patients. In one study, only 29 percent of all physicians felt qualified to provide genetic counseling regarding cancer susceptibility testing to their patients.27 Specialists may be more comfortable with genetic testing; 84 percent of oncologists felt qualified to recommend genetic testing, compared with 58 percent of other tertiary care providers and 41 percent of primary care providers.27\n\nMost obstetricians felt somewhat qualified to counsel patients about prenatal genetics. In one study, 89 percent said they were somewhat or well qualified to provide general prenatal genetic counseling, 83 percent felt qualified to provide counseling to patients at elevated risk of fetal aneuploidy, and 80 percent felt qualified to provide counseling to patients screening positive for fetal aneuploidy.25 Fewer obstetricians were comfortable interpreting genetic tests for cancer; the proportion that were not very confident or not at all confident interpreting tests was 65 percent for breast cancer, 61 percent for ovarian cancer, and 77 percent for colon cancer.26 Two-thirds reported they would refer a patient with a family history of an untreatable disease to a medical geneticist or a genetic counselor.26\n\nPhysicians who felt qualified to recommend cancer susceptibility testing were twice as likely to have used testing.20 Thirty-four percent of primary care physicians in Texas felt that difficulty in interpreting genetic tests was a barrier to their use.23\n\nReferral to a genetic counselor or geneticist could compensate for physician uncertainty regarding genetic risk and genetic testing, and many physicians use these services. Twenty-one percent of obstetricians provided counseling themselves, 54 percent referred women to a geneticist, and 22 percent did both.26 Forty-eight percent of primary care physicians in Cincinnati would refer patients who were candidates for breast cancer susceptibility testing to a genetic counselor and 34 percent would refer them to a geneticist.21 Twelve percent did not know to whom they would refer such patients.21 Eighty-five percent of New York gastroenterologists said they would provide genetic counseling before testing for hereditary cancer susceptibility. Twenty-nine percent would provide the counseling themselves, and 51 percent would refer to a genetic counselor. Only 26 percent, however, would have referred a hypothetical HNPCC patient for genetic counseling.17\n\nA lack of available genetic counseling creates a substantial barrier to genetic testing. Ninety-one percent of physicians agreed that patients should not have genetic testing unless genetic counseling was available.27 Physicians who reported that local counseling and testing were available were 50 percent more likely to have used cancer susceptibility testing.20 Sixty percent of obstetricians have access to community-based counselors, and only 1 percent do not have access to any counselors.26 However, 44 percent of primary care physicians in Texas reported that genetic evaluation services were not available.23 Among physicians who requested testing for or information about breast cancer susceptibility testing, only 12 percent did not have access to genetic counseling services.19\n\nData Sources. Existing information regarding the interpretation and appropriate followup of newborn screening tests is based primarily on survey data, with some information drawn from clinical databases described above.\n\nPublic Health Databases. State newborn screening programs may be able to provide information on the interpretation and followup of newborn screening tests.\n\nElectronic Medical Records. Electronic medical records, such as KP HealthConnectâ„¢ discussed above, may provide additional information on the interpretation of gene-based screening tests, but such information will probably be imbedded in text fields of physicians or other notes in the record. Such information may be difficult to extract.\n\nClinical Databases. Clinical databases could potentially provide information on the proportion of patients with abnormal screening test results who received referrals for genetic counseling or for follow-up testing. It would be difficult, however, to determine whether patients received appropriate advice on followup and their adherence to recommendations. This level of detail would probably require medical record abstraction, such as was used by Lynch et al. to provide the HNPCC case scenarios.38\n\nLaboratory Databases. Laboratory databases provide little information on how test results are used or interpreted. If the same laboratory is used for the screening test and the diagnostic test, it may be possible to infer whether or not the test was interpreted correctly.\n\nAdministrative Databases. None was identified, although some information may be available from the Blue Cross/Blue Shield FEHBP database described under screening tests.\n\nScheduled Surveys. The NCI physician survey and the NCHS NAMCS could be potential sources of data on physician interpretation of gene-based screening test results.\n\nPoint-in-Time Surveys. With the exception of the case scenarios by Lynch et al.,38 all the existing information on physician interpretation and followup of screening tests is based on surveys of physicians.\n\nOngoing Research Cohorts. See discussion under screening criteria regarding the Center for Human Genetics at the Marshfield Clinics Research Foundation and Kaiser Permanente Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health.\n\nRegistries.
