Despite growing evidence that inter-patient variation affects treatment responses after radiotherapy, patients receiving these treatments continue to be treated with the same or similar doses. We seek to develop an information capability at the forefront of personalized radiotherapy treatments. We achieve this through the assembly of experimental scaffolds that span the translational research spectrum and help us understand tumor complexity and predict clinical outcomes.\n\nBriefly, we conduct large-scale projects that capture the diversity of our patients and provide a rich substrate for computational and mathematical models of cancer’s propensity to resist our treatments. Three large-scale projects have been completed or are currently in progress including: 1) The X-ray Target Discovery and Development (XTD2) project, which profiled 533 cancer cell line survival comprising 26 cancer types to ionizing radiation. This project represented the largest profiling effort of cancer cell line survival after irradiation ever conducted. 2) The Pan-cancer Radiogenomic Atlas is a gene variant profiling project that interrogated >1000 common and rare genetic variants for response to ionizing radiation in immortalized human cells (non-cancer cells). Current work is building on the unary profiling methodology to study the interaction between varied gene variants, thus building toward greater complexity. 3) The 10,000 Avatar Project was inaugurated by our group in 2019. This will be the largest patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse experiment conducted to date by any group. ~10,000 mice engrafted with ~500 genetically annotated PDXs will be irradiated using a singular experimental platform. This work will correlate genetic and other omic (e.g. transcriptomic, metabolomic, et cetera) alterations with the likelihood of response to radiotherapy and matched recurrent tumors.\n\nConcurrent with the large-scale biological profiling approaches described above, we have developed a clinomic dataset that integrates clinical information (e.g. demographics, treatments, outcomes) and patient avatar models (patient-derived xenografts) with omic outputs for individual patients. The latter include radiomics (embedded quantitative data derived from imaging modalities like computed tomography), genomics (genetic information derived from the patient’s tumor or germline), transcriptomics (gene expression), and others. Using this information, we seek to design and implement tools that can augment the physician’s ability to estimate the probability of treatment failures and modulate failure by individualized treatment recommendations.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Mohamed Abazeed's, MD,PhD, faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Abazeed's publications in PubMed.\n\nContact Us\n\nContact the Abazeed Lab at 312-503-2195.

Our approach includes the genomic analysis of human tumors, cell culture studies and the use of genetically engineered mouse models. We have a strong interest in genomics and gene regulation, oncogenic kinases as potential molecular therapeutic targets and the use of in vivo lineage tracing to define the fates of specific cell populations in tumorigenesis.\n\nSpecific projects include:\n\nThe role of the oncogenic serine/threonine kinase PIM1 in prostate cancer - PIM1 is coexpressed with c-MYC and dramatically enhances c-MYC-driven prostate tumorigenesis in a kinase-dependent manner. Notably, PIM1 is induced in tumors by hypoxia, radiation and treatment with docetaxel, a common but largely ineffective option for patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer. PIM1 induction by hypoxia/radiation/docetaxel promotes prostate cancer cell survival and therapeutic resistance. Therefore, PIM1 may represent a valuable therapeutic target in prostate cancer. We are using new mouse models of prostate cancer for testing the efficacy of novel PIM1 kinase inhibitors in treating prostate cancer and reversing therapeutic resistance. We have also identified novel candidate PIM1-interacting proteins in prostate epithelial cells. Among the proteins identified are a MYC transcriptional cofactor and a prostate stem cell marker/regulator. We are investigating how PIM1 promotes prostate tumorigenesis by phosphorylating these substrates involved in regulating MYC transcriptional activity and stem cell function.\n\nCellular and molecular determinants of prostate cancer recurrence - A major clinical problem in prostate cancer is that of tumor recurrence following initial apparently successful therapy. Recurrent tumors may arise from a small number of \"cancer stem-like cells\" that survive the initial therapeutic intervention and have the capacity to regenerate the tumor. We are using lineage tracing to examine the competence of specific prostate epithelial cell types to regenerate tumors following therapy in mice.\n\nTargeting lethal prostate cancer – We are using our mouse model of lethal prostate cancer based on alterations in Myc, Pten and Tp53 to develop new targeted therapies. One current project involves the targeting of EphB4 receptor tyrosine kinase using an antagonist as a therapeutic strategy.\n\nFor more information, see Dr. Abdulkadir's faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Abdulkadir's full publications in PubMed.\n\nContact Us\n\nDr. Abdulkadir\n\nLab Telephone: 312-503-5031\n\nAtique U Ahmed\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Immunology; Neurobiology; Pharmacology\n\nAtique Ahmed, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor in the Department of Neurosurgery at Northwestern University and a distinguished Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center member. He completed his BSc (Hons) degree at Winona State University in Minnesota and earned his Ph.D. from the Mayo Clinic School of Medicine. He pursued postdoctoral training at the University of Chicago.\n\nAhmed's lab research focuses on cancer cell plasticity and its implications for tumor progression and therapy resistance. He investigates how cancer cells adapt and alters their characteristics in response to the tumor microenvironment, including their resistance to therapy and potential for metastasis. Dr. Ahmed aims to develop innovative therapies to prevent the transition to more aggressive states and inhibit tumor spread by studying the mechanisms underlying cancer cell plasticity.\n\nOne significant aspect of Lab research is exploring epigenetic changes in cancer. Epigenetic alterations can influence gene expression in cell growth and division, rendering cancer cells more aggressive and resistant to treatment. Dr. Ahmed's lab has demonstrated that anti-cancer therapies can induce epigenetic plasticity, enabling cancer cells to adapt and evade treatment. Through his investigations, he seeks to identify strategies that reverse or block these changes, ultimately preventing cancer cells from becoming more aggressive or resistant to therapy.\n\nA recent milestone from Ahmed Lab is the initiation of a clinical trial that investigates the repurposing of Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an FDA-approved drug, to target plasticity-driven chemoresistance in brain tumors. The lab's promising findings suggest that MMF can sensitize tumor cells to treatment and potentially improve outcomes for glioblastoma (GBM) patients. By evaluating the safety and efficacy of MMF in a clinical setting, Dr. Ahmed aims to enhance current GBM therapies and pave the way for novel treatment approaches in other cancer types.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Atique Ahmed's faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Ahmed's publications in PubMed.\n\nContact Us\n\nDr. Ahmed\n\nDaniel Arango\n\nResearch Area(s): Biochemistry and Structural Biology; Cancer Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Pharmacology\n\nTranslation is the mechanism by which proteins are made from the information stored in the genetic code. This process is achieved with the help of RNA molecules such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and messenger RNA (mRNA). While translation is a tightly regulated process, global perturbations in protein synthesis are observed in stress conditions, cancer, and aging, highlighting the regulatory mechanisms of translation as potential targets in cancer and age-related disorders. One poorly characterized layer of translation regulation is the epitranscriptome, defined as the set of more than 140 ribonucleotide modifications that alter the biochemical properties and function of all classes of RNA, including rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. While the distribution and function for most ribonucleotide modifications are undefined, the enzymes responsible for depositing RNA modifications are dynamic and sensitive to metabolic alterations, potentially regulating the temporal response to stress or the onset of human diseases such as cancer.\n\nOur group investigates the mechanisms by which RNA modifications regulate protein synthesis and how these mechanisms affect cell fate decisions such as cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation in cancer and stress conditions. By integrating RNA biology, transcriptomics, and cell biology, we aim to uncover novel mechanisms of gene expression regulation and generate new tools that can be harnessed to develop anti-cancer therapies.\n\nFor more information, see Dr. Arango's faculty profile or the Arango lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Arango’s publications in PubMed.\n\nContact Us\n\nDr. Arango\n\nHossein Ardehali\n\nResearch Area(s): Biochemistry and Structural Biology; Cancer Biology; Cardiovascular and Renal Biology; Cell Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Immunology; Metabolism and Endocrinology; Pharmacology\n\nOur lab focuses on three major areas of research:\n\nRole of hexokinase enzymes in immune function, cancer growth and stem cell differentiation\n\nHexokinase (HK) enzymes phosphorylate glucose to trap it inside the cell. There are 5 mammalian HKs (named HK1-5), with two of them having a hydrophobic region at their N-terminus that allows them to bind to the mitochondria. We have made mouse models and developed in vitro systems to allow us to study the role of mitochondrial binding of HKs in glucose metabolism. We have determined that HK1 binding to the mitochondria determines whether glucose is used for anabolic processes (ie, pentose-phosphate pathway) or catabolism (ie, glycolysis). Thus, the non-enzymatic function of this protein and its subcellular location determines the fate of glucose. We are now studying this process in T-cells, vascular cells and cancer cells. We are also in the process of generating several mouse models of hexokinase enzymes, including HK2 without the mitochondrial binding domain and HK3 knockout mice. We will study these models in different disease and physiological conditions.\n\nCharacterization of cellular and mitochondrial iron regulation\n\nOur lab has identified a novel mitochondrial protein, ATP-Binding Cassette-B8 (ABCB8), which plays a role in mitochondrial iron homeostasis and mitochondrial iron export. Mice with ABCB8 knocked out in the heart develop cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial iron accumulation. In addition, we have shown that a pathway involving mTOR and tristetraprolin, treatment with doxorubicin (an anticancer drug that also causes cardiomyopathy) and SIRT2 protein also impact cellular and/or mitochondrial iron regulation. Current studies in this area include: 1) further characterization of ABCB8 in iron homeostasis in other organs and disorders, 2) characterization of the mechanism for iron regulation by SIRT2, 3) identification of the mechanism by which mTOR is regulated by iron through epigenetic changes, 4) role of iron in viral infection, particularly HIV, 5) characterization of the effects of iron on mitochondrial dynamics and 6) identification of novel mitochondrial-specific iron chelators.\n\nRole of mRNA-binding proteins in cellular and systemic metabolism\n\nTTP is a protein that binds to AU-rich regions in the 3’ UTR of mRNA molecules and causes their degradation. It has been studied extensively in the field of inflammation. We recently showed that it also plays a role in cellular iron conservation. We have also shown that TTP is a key mediator of cellular metabolic processes. Our studies have demonstrated that TTP regulates glucose, fatty acid and branched-chain amino acid metabolism in the liver and muscle tissue. We also have evidence that TTP directly regulates mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) by targeting specific proteins in the ETC complexes. Finally, recent studies demonstrated that TTP also regulates systemic metabolism by targeting FGF-21 expression. We have both TTP Floxed mice (for the generation of tissue specific TTP knockout mice) and TTP knockout mice in the background of TNF-alpha receptor 1/2 knockout mice (to reduce the inflammatory burden). Current studies include: 1) role of TTP in liver metabolism of fatty acids and glucose, 2) effects of TTP on mitochondrial proteins, 3) mechanism of TTP regulation of branched-chain amino acid levels and 4) role of TTP in cardiac metabolism.\n\nFor more information, see Dr. Ardehali's faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Ardehali's publications in PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nDr. Ardehali\n\nRajeshwar Awatramani\n\nResearch Area(s): Cell Biology; Developmental and Stem Cell Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Neurobiology\n\nTopic 1. Mechanisms underlying dopamine neurogenesis\n\nThe floor plate, the ventral organizing center in the embryonic neural tube, patterns the neural tube by secreting the potent morphogen Shh. Using genetic fate mapping, we have recently shown that the midbrain floor plate, unlike the hindbrain and spinal cord floor plate, is neurogenic and is the source of midbrain dopamine neurons (Joksimovic, et al, 2009 Nature Neuroscience, Joksimovic et al. 2009 PNAS). We are interested in understanding pathways that are involved in floor plate neurogenesis and production of dopamine neurons. We have shown that Wnt signaling is critical for the establishment of the dopamine progenitor pool and that miRNAs may modulate the dosage and timing of the Wnt pathway (Anderegg et al, PloS Genetics 2013).\n\nTopic 2. Deconstructing Dopaminergic Diversity\n\nThe neurotransmitter dopamine, produced mainly by midbrain dopaminergic neurons, influences a spectrum of behaviors including motor, learning, reward, motivation and cognition. In accordance with its diverse functions, dopaminergic dysfunction is implicated in a range of disorders affecting millions of people, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), schizophrenia, addiction and depression. How a small group of neurons underpins a gamut of key behaviors and diseases remains enigmatic. We postulated that there must exist several molecularly distinct dopaminergic neuron populations that, in part, can account for the plethora of dopaminergic functions and disorders. We are currently working to test this hypothesis and define dopamine neuron subtypes.\n\nTopic 3. MicroRNAs in Schwann cell (SC) differentiation\n\nMicroRNAs, by modulating gene expression, have been implicated as regulators of various cellular and physiological processes including differentiation, proliferation and cancer. We have studied the role of microRNAs in Schwann cell (SC) differentiation by conditional removal of the microRNA processing enzyme, Dicer1 (Yun et al, 2010, J Neurosci) . We reveal that mice lacking Dicer1 in SC (Dicer1 cKO) display a severe neurological phenotype resembling congenital hypomyelination. SC lacking Dicer1 are stalled in differentiation at the promyelinating state and fail to myelinate axons. We are beginning to determine the molecular basis of this phenotype. Understanding this will be important not only for congenital hypomyelination, but also for peripheral nerve regeneration and SC cancers.\n\nFor more information, please see Dr. Awatramani's faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nView Dr. Awatramani's complete list of publications in PubMed.\n\nContact Us\n\nDr. Awatramani, PhD at 312-503-0690\n\nGrant D Barish\n\nResearch Area(s): Cardiovascular and Renal Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Immunology; Metabolism and Endocrinology; Reproductive Biology\n\nThe burgeoning epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus presents a major health and therapeutic challenge. Transcriptional regulation is the fundamental control mechanism for metabolism, but a gap remains in our knowledge of gene regulatory pathways that control lipid and glucose homeostasis. Thus, we seek to identify modulable pathways that may be leveraged to counteract diabetes mellitus and its comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease. In this effort, we use a variety of genetic, molecular, next-generation sequencing, biochemical methods and physiological models. Our recent work has helped to reveal the genomic architecture for transcriptional regulation in innate immunity, which plays a key role in both diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Surprisingly, although macrophage regulatory elements are often at significant linear distance from their associated genes, we identified interplay between transcriptional activators and repressors that is highly proximate, occurring at shared nucleosomal domains (Genes & Development, 2010). Moreover, we discovered a powerful role for the BCL6 transcriptional repressor to maintain macrophage quiescence and prevent atherosclerosis (Cell Metabolism, 2012).\n\nCurrently, we are exploring the impact of activator–repressor interactions on enhancer function and transcription, the signal-dependent control of repression and the functional impact of transcriptional activators and repressors on inflammatory and metabolic disease. In particular, we strive to further understand the role for B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), a C2H2-type zinc finger repressor, in innate immunity and metabolism.\n\nIn related work, we are developing new methods for cell-specific isolation of RNA and chromatin from tissues composed of mixed cell populations. These genetic tools will allow us to explore transcriptional regulation in living animals with unprecedented precision and global scope using transcriptome sequencing and ChIP-sequencing. We anticipate that these approaches will identify new candidate regulators and mechanisms underlying cardiovascular and metabolic disease.\n\nFor more information, please see Dr. Barish's faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Barish's publications in PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nDr. Barish\n\nJoseph T Bass\n\nResearch Area(s): Cell Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Metabolism and Endocrinology\n\nCircadian and metabolic gene networks in the development of diabetes and obesity\n\nAn epidemic of obesity and diabetes has continued to sweep through the industrialized world, already posing a risk to over one-third of the US population who are overweight or obese. Although both physical inactivity and overnutrition are tied to “diabesity,” recent evidence indicates that disruption of internal circadian clocks and sleep also play a role. The primary research focus in our laboratory is to apply genetic and biochemical approaches to understand the basic mechanisms through which the circadian clock regulates organismal metabolism. We anticipate that a better understanding of clock processes will lead to innovative therapeutics for a spectrum of diseases including diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and cancer.\n\nStudies of Clock Function in Beta Cell Failure and Metabolic Disease\n\nGlucose homeostasis is a dynamic process subject to rhythmic variation throughout the day and night. Impaired glucose regulation leads to metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus, disorders that are also associated with sleep-wake disruption, although the molecular underpinnings of circadian glucose regulation have been unknown. Work from our laboratory first demonstrated an essential role of the intrinsic pancreatic clock in insulin secretion and diabetes mellitus and present efforts focus on dissecting the genomic and cell biologic link between clock function and beta cell failure (Nature, 2010, 2013).\n\nStudies of Clock Regulation of Metabolic Epigenetics\n\nIn 2009 we first reported discovery that the circadian system plays a central role in metabolism through regulation of NAD+ biosynthesis (Science, 2009). NAD+ is a precursor of NADP+ and is required for macromolecule biosynthesis, in addition to functioning as an oxidoreductase carrier. NAD+ is also a required cofactor for the class III histone deacetylases (silencer of information regulators, SIRTs), nutrient-responsive epigenetic regulators Biochemical analyses show that SIRT1 deacetylates substrate proteins generating O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide, which is then regenerated to NAD+ by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT). We originally showed that CLOCK/BMAL1 directly control the transcription of Nampt and in turn control the activity of SIRT1—identifying a feedback loop composed of CLOCK/BMAL1-NAMPT/SIRT1. More recently, we have identified a role for the clock-NAD+ pathway in mitochondrial respiration (Science, 2013), and our present efforts include the analysis of clock-NAD+ regulation of cellular redox and epigenetic regulation, with the ultimate aim of applying such knowledge to studies of cell growth and stress response.\n\nFor more information, please see Dr. Bass' faculty profile or lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Bass' publications in PubMed.\n\nContact Info\n\nDr. Bass\n\nIssam Ben-Sahra\n\nResearch Area(s): Cell Biology; Metabolism and Endocrinology\n\nThe Ben-Sahra lab seeks to identify novel connections between oncogenic and physiological signals and cellular metabolism. My previous studies revealed new connections between mTORC1 (mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex I) signaling and de novo nucleotide synthesis pathways.\n\nUsing isotopic tracing experiments and genetic approaches, my lab investigates whether the additional signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, RAF/Erk, Hippo/Yap or AMPK could regulate metabolic pathways that supply small metabolites to sustain nucleotide synthesis independently of mTORC1 signaling. Furthermore, we are also interested in understanding how cells can sense changes in nucleotide levels. In addition to nucleotide metabolism, we also study connections between signaling pathway and global cancer cell metabolism. I predict that there could be points of regulations which could give selective advantages to cancer cells to grow and proliferate. The initial discovery that cancer cells exhibit atypical metabolic characteristics can be traced to the pioneering work of Otto Warburg, over the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nDeciphering the interplay between oncogenic processes and metabolic pathways that contribute to metabolic reprogramming in a given setting may serve as a critical factor in determining therapeutic targets that yield greatest drug efficacy with marginal harmful effect on normal cells. Our research will enable further progress in the exploitation of unusual metabolic features in cancer as a means of therapeutic intervention.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Ben-Sahra's faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Ben-Sahra's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Ben-Sahra.\n\nSergejs Berdnikovs\n\nResearch Area(s): Immunology\n\nThe question of primary interest in my lab is why only select individuals, despite being genetically similar and living in the same allergen environment, are prone to developing allergic disease, and which processes drive this predisposition? To address this, we employ a systems biology approach and bioinformatics to explore whether there is underlying unity in the pathogenesis of seemingly disparate allergic diseases. By synthesizing large volumes of biological data, we link departures from homeostatic conditions (including changes in metabolic, developmental, and endocrine systems) at the epithelial barriers of the skin, gut, and airways with innate immune system responses as a possible suite of mechanisms driving initiation of allergic disease. Specifically, we are asking the following questions: Are allergic diseases at different barrier sites caused by common systemic processes? Do hormones (estrogen, androgen, growth hormones) maintain homeostasis of the mucosal barriers? Why are developmental pathways for maintenance of tissue homeostasis linked to early susceptibility of asthma? What is the impact of environmentally relevant xenobiotics (xenoestrogens, aromatic hydrocarbons) on epithelial barriers and priming of allergic responses?\n\nSecondarily, I keep being fascinated by a cell type that is intimately tied into mucosal biology, and plays central roles in many aspects of allergic disease - the eosinophil. I am intrigued by the fact that aside from being destructive in allergy, eosinophils play prominent roles in homeostasis and assist in normal development of tissues and maturation of other cell types – however, these alternate aspects of eosinophil biology remain largely unexplored. In my lab, we are studying the nature of reciprocal interactions between eosinophils and the mucosa in health and disease by asking the following questions: When and why are eosinophils homeostatic in the mucosa? What is their role in priming of immune responses?\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Berdnikovs' faculty profile\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Berdnikovs' publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nEmail Dr. Berdnikovs\n\nPhone 312-503-6924\n\nMarcelo G Bonini\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Immunology\n\nOur laboratory is focused on understanding how the declining of metabolic performance with aging changes biophysical cellular parameters relevant for the regulation of gene expression. In particular, we are focused on the hypothesis that an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species by \"short-circuited\" mitochondria modifies the redox microenvironment of the nucleus changing chromatin structure, compaction and interactions with transcription factors. Based on this idea we aim at developing new first in class therapeutics with ROS modulating function that are targeted to specific organelles. Examples of projects in the laboratory include:\n\nRegulation of EMT by mitochondria ROS - In this project we explore how changes in the nuclear redox state activates (or prevents shutting down) of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes. While EMT is essential for development, tissue remodeling and healing, persisting EMT may promote cancer progression and metastasis. We propose that persistent changes to the redox state of the nucleus prolong EMT and facilitates malignant transformation particularly in elderly patients prone to experience declines in mitochondrial performance.\n\nPollution by heavy metals and cancer - Lower income populations around the world are disproportionally more exposed to pollution by heavy metals than wealthier communities. A recent example was drinking water pollution by lead in Flint, Michigan. We found that heavy metals promote mitochondrial dysfunction mimicking the process of aging. As such heavy metals promote the dysregulation of gene expression via redox mechanisms. This project is important because it may enable the development of short term pharmacologic solutions for environmental health inequalities issues likely to be aggravated by wars and climate change.\n\nRedox regulation of inflammatory gene expression - The recent COVID crisis has put in full display the increased susceptibility of elderly patients to infection-induced hyper-inflammatory states. We propose that the accumulation of oxidants in the nucleus of macrophages (immune cells that regulate inflammation) increases the accessibility of pro-inflammatory genes while disabling the transcription of anti-inflammatory ones involved in inflammation resolution and tissue healing. This project is relevant because it may indicate novel mechanisms that can be targeted to \"rejuvenate\" innate immune cells to react appropriately against pathogens.\n\nPublications\n\nView lab publications via PubMed.\n\nFor more information, please see Dr. Bonini's faculty profile\n\nContact Us\n\nEmail Dr. Bonini\n\nDaniel J Brat\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Computational Biology and Bioinformatics; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Neurobiology\n\nMechanisms Underlying Glioblastoma Progression\n\nWe investigate mechanisms of progression to glioblastoma (GBM), the highest grade astrocytoma, including genetics, hypoxia, and angiogenesis. Progression is characterized by tumor necrosis, severe hypoxia and microvascular hyperplasia, a type of angiogenesis. We propose that vaso-occlusion and intravascular thrombosis within a high grade glioma results in hypoxia, necrosis and hypoxia-induced microvascular hyperplasia in the tumor periphery, leading to neoplastic expansion outward. Since the pro-thrombotic protein tissue factor is upregulated in gliomas, we investigate mechanisms of increased expression and pro-coagulant effects.\n\nIn Silico Brain Tumor Research\n\nWe initiated an In Silico Center for Brain Tumor Research to investigate the molecular correlates of pathologic, radiologic and clinical features of gliomas using pre-existing databases, including as TCGA and Rembrandt. Using datasets and image analysis algorithms, we study whether elements of the tumor micro-environment, such as tumor necrosis, angiogenesis, inflammatory infiltrates and thrombosis, may correlate with gene expression subtypes in TCGA gliomas. We also have demonstrated the clinical relevance of TCGA subclasses within the lower grade gliomas using the Rembrandt dataset.\n\nRegulators of Asymmetric Cellular Division in Glioblastoma Stem Cells\n\nWe study mechanisms that confer specialized biologic properties to glioma stem cells (GSC) in GBM. The Drosophila brain tumor (brat) gene normally regulates asymmetric cellular division and neural progenitor differentiation in the CNS of flies and, when mutated, leads to a massive brain containing only neuroblastic cells with tumor-like properties. We study the human homolog of Drosophila brat, Trim3, for its role in regulating asymmetric cell division and stem-like properties in GSCs. Trim3 may elicit its effects is through repression of c-Myc.\n\nFor more information, visit the faculty profile of Daniel Brat, MD, PhD or the Brat Lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Brat's publications in PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nEmail Dr. Brat\n\nMelissa A Brown\n\nResearch Area(s): Immunology; Neurobiology\n\nMast cells are found in most tissues including the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, pancreas, synovium, brain, spinal cord and the secondary lymphoid organs. Best studied in the context of allergic disease, the widespread location of mast cells, the plethora of inflammatory mediators they produce and their ability to directly interact with T and B cells made them good candidates for exacerbating the inflammation associated with autoimmune diseases such as diabetes, arthritis and multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nWe have utilized KitW/Wv mice, which are mast cell deficient, to study the contribution of these cells in a rodent model of MS, Experimental autoimmune/allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE is characterized by the T cell mediated orchestration that damages myelin and myelin producing cells in the CNS leading to severe neurological deficits due to loss of normal nerve conduction. We have shown that mast cells in the meninges are activated early in this disease and promote the opening of the blood brain barrier (BBB), vasculature that is relatively impermeable and normally sequesters the CNS from the entry of inflammatory cells. Our current studies focus on understanding how these mast cells influence these events. In the process, we have established a new paradigm for the mast cell mediated inflammation of the meninges in immunity and believe this information will likely impact the understanding of other CNS diseases.\n\nA second line of research investigates the development of mast cells from early myeloid precursors. Mast cells share a common precursor with a related cell type, basophils. While mast cells are resident in tissues and their numbers remain relatively stable, basophils are induced in high numbers in the blood only in certain infection settings. We have demonstrated the Ikaros, a transcription factor, is essential for proper mast cell development. In Ikaros deficient mice, mast cell development is aberrant and basophils predominate in the absence of inflammatory signals. We are studying the events that underlie mast cell basophil-lineage choice in development by examining the molecular targets of Ikaros and its mode of action under basal and infection conditions.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Brown’s faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Brown's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Brown at 312-503-0108 or the lab at 312-503-1013.\n\nIrina V Budunova\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Cell Biology; Developmental and Stem Cell Biology; Immunology; Pharmacology\n\nThe current projects in Dr. Budunova’s lab are centered on the role of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a tumor suppressor gene in skin. We showed that skin-specific GR transgenic animals are resistant to skin carcinogenesis and GR KO animals are more sensitive to skin tumor development. We are also interested in the role of GR in the maintenance of skin stem cells (SC). We found that GR/glucocorticoids inhibit the expression of numerous SC markers in skin including CD34- a marker of hair follicular epithelial SC and reduce the proliferative potential of skin SCs.\n\nThe glucocorticoids remain among the most effective and frequently used anti-inflammatory drugs in dermatology. Unfortunately, patients chronically treated with topical glucocorticoids, develop side effects including cutaneous atrophy. GR controls gene expression via (i) transactivation that requires GR dimerization and binding as homo-dimer to gene promoters and (ii) transrepression that is chiefly mediated via negative interaction between GR and other transcription factors including pro-inflammatory factor NF-kB. In general, GR transrepression is the leading mechanism of glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory effects, while many adverse effects of glucocorticoids are driven by GR transactivation.\n\nOur laboratory has been involved in delineation of mechanisms underlying side effects of glucocorticoids in skin. Using GRdim knockin mice characterized by impaired GR dimerization and activation, we found that GR transactivation plays an important role in skin atrophy. These data suggested that non-steroidal selective GR activators (SEGRA) that do not support GR dimerization, could preserve therapeutic potential of classical glucocorticoids but have reduced adverse effects in skin. We are testing effects of the novel SEGRA called Compound A– a synthetic analog of natural aziridine precursor from African bush Salsola Botch in skin. We have also established anti-cancer GR-dependent activity of Compound A in epithelial and lymphoma cells.\n\nUsing knockout mice for the major GR target genes including Fkbp5 (GR chaperone) and DDIT4/REDD1 (one of the major negative regulators of mTORC), we discovered that blockage of Fkbp5 and REDD1 significantly changes GR function and greatly protects skin against glucocorticoid-induced atrophy. This suggests a novel GR-targeted anti-inflammatory therapy where glucocorticoids are combined with inhibitors of GR target genes.\n\nFor more information, please see Dr. Budunova’s faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Budunova's publications in PubMed.\n\nContact Budunova Lab\n\nContact the Budunova Lab at 312-503-4669 or visit in the Montgomery Ward Building, 303 E.

Bulun, MD, focuses on studying estrogen biosynthesis and metabolism, in particular aromatase expression, in hormone-dependent human diseases such as breast cancer, endometriosis and uterine fibroids.\n\nA team of investigators works on understanding the epithelial-stromal interactions and aromatase overexpression in breast cancer tissue. Because aromatase inhibitors treat breast tumors primarily via suppressing intratumoral estrogen biosynthesis, these efforts are important for discovering new targets of treatment.\n\nAnother team studies endometriosis. Basic data from this laboratory led to the introduction of aromatase inhibitors into endometriosis treatment. Human tissues and a primate model are used to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of endometriosis.\n\nRegulation of aromatase expression is also studied in uterine fibroids, benign tumors that are dependent on estrogen for growth, by a third team.\n\nA fourth team is investigating the link between progesterone action and estrogen inactivation in normal endometrium and endometriosis.\n\nLastly, a fifth team has identified novel mutations that cause familial excessive estrogen formation syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by short stature, gynecomastia and hypogonadism in males and early breast development and irregular menses in females. In this syndrome, heterozygous inversions in chromosome 15q21, which cause the coding region of the aromatase gene to lie adjacent to constitutively active cryptic promoters that normally transcribe other genes, result in estrogen excess owing to the overexpression of aromatase in many tissues.\n\nFor more information, please see Dr. Bulun's faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Bulun's publications in PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nDr. Bulun\n\nDebabrata Chakravarti\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Cell Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Pharmacology; Reproductive Biology\n\nDr. Chakravarti’s research is focused on understanding epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of human tumorigenesis.

Dr. Chandel’s work has elucidated that mitochondria have a third distinct role whereby they participate in cellular signaling processes through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and metabolites independent of ATP and macromolecule production. Our work has implicated the necessity of mitochondrial ROS for multiple biological processes including hypoxic activation of HIFs, cellular differentiation, and adaptive immunity. Previously, the dogma in the field had been that mitochondrial ROS are only produced in pathological settings to cause both lipid, protein and DNA damage. However, our work demonstrates that mitochondrial ROS are utilized as messengers to maintain normal biological and physiological functions. Our studies suggest that the current widespread use of antioxidants is likely to be detrimental rather than beneficial for alleviating a myriad of diseases as this could interfere with normal physiological processes. Recently, our work has shown that mitochondria release the metabolite L-2HG, which increases histone and DNA methylation to control hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation and regulatory T cell (Treg) function, respectively. In summary, our lab has been instrumental in changing our view of mitochondria from the “powerhouses\" of cell to “signaling organelles”. He has trained past/present 27 graduate students.\n\n​Current Projects\n\nCancer Metabolism:\n\nIn the field of cancer, our work was the first to genetically demonstrate the necessity of mitochondrial respiratory chain is necessary for tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Our recent work points to key role of the respiratory chain in supporting biomass of cancer cells needed for in vivo tumor growth. These findings were seminal for the cancer metabolism field since the 1920s the prevailing idea was that only increased aerobic glycolysis (i.e. the Warburg Effect) was the dominant metabolic reprogramming event in cancer cells and endothelial cells. Another key finding in the lab was genetically elucidating that the anti-diabetic drug metformin prevents tumorigenesis by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I within cancer cells. Finally, our work provided a conceptual model whereby mitochondria generated ROS can trigger local signaling events in the cells to promote growth but can be elevated to levels that are detrimental. Thus, tumor cells increase their antioxidant capacity to prevent ROS induced cell death. Our current projects involve the use of CRISPR based genetic screens to uncover metabolic vulnerabilities in the presence of standard care of therapy.\n\nViral Pneumonia:\n\nViral pneumonia is currently among the most common causes of death in the world. Viral pneumonia impairs tissue repair leading to both in-hospital death and prolonged hospital-acquired disability. Two leading causes of viral pneumonia are influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus. We use mouse models to test whether metabolism can modulate inflammation, host defense and repair to the lungs upon exposure to influenza A virus.\n\nAging:\n\nMetformin is a biguanide drug that boosts healthspan in multiple model organisms and humans. Metformin in humans is used as the first-line therapy for type II diabetes. In addition, metformin has anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects which likely contribute to its geroprotective activity. Currently, the TAME trial will test whether metformin can delay age-related chronic diseases in humans. However, metformin’s the direct mechanism of action is poorly understood. The mechanism of metformin action must be considered at two levels: (1) the molecular target of metformin and (2) the therapeutic pathways triggered by metformin acting on its molecular target in different cell types. A leading hypothesis is that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) to exert anti-aging effects. Currently, we are using genetic models to determine the essentiality of mitochondrial complex I inhibition in gut epithelium, hepatocytes, and immune cells for metformin to exert its anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nNeurological diseases:\n\nNeurological diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Alzheimer disease (AD) have all been linked to metabolic dysregulation. We are using mouse models and IPSCs to test whether metabolic dysfunction is a causal agent rather than a hallmark of these diseases. This work is complemented by our work on primary mitochondrial disease mouse models that manifest neurological symptoms.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Chandel's publications in PubMed.\n\nFor more information, please see Dr. Chandel's faculty profile or visit the Chandel Lab website.\n\nContact Us\n\nContact Dr. Chandel’s Lab at 312-503-1792\n\nDr. Chandel\n\nShi-Yuan Cheng\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Cell Biology; Developmental and Stem Cell Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Metabolism and Endocrinology; Neurobiology\n\nOur lab broadly studies cancer stem cell biology, cellular signaling, RNA biology, and therapy responses in human brain tumors, in particular, glioblastoma (GBM). We have a range of different projects currently underway in glioma cell lines, gliomas stem-like cells (GSCs), patient-derived xenograft (PDX) GBM model, human iPSC-derived glioma organoid model, orthotopic glioma xenograft model in mice, and clinical glioma tumor specimens. Our current research focuses on novel mechanisms/cellular signaling of GSC biology, tumorigenesis, progression, and therapy responses of GSCs and GBMs.\n\nRoles of RNA alternative splicing and RNA-binding proteins in glioma\n\nRNA alternative splicing (AS), an evolutionarily conserved co-transcriptional process, is an important and influential determinant of transcriptome and proteome landscapes in normal and disease states such as cancer. AS is regulated by a group of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that bind to the cis-acting elements in proximity to a splice site thus affecting spliceosome assembly. In cancers, altered expression of or mutations in RBPs result in dysregulated AS that impacts cancer biologic properties. We have established AS/RBP networks that are dysregulated in both adult and pediatric gliomas through bioinformatic analysis of both public and our own datasets of clinical glioma tumors. We are investigating the biological significance of AS/RBPs dysregulation in glioma progression and therapy response by using human iPSC-derived glioma organoid model and GSC brain xenograft models in animals. In addition, we are exploring novel therapeutic approaches of targeting glioma-associated AS/RBP networks to treat GBMs.\n\nRoles of Non-coding RNAs in glioma\n\nNon-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), act as transcription repressors or inducers of gene expression or functional modulators in all multicellular organisms. Dysregulated ncRNAs plays critical roles in cancer initiation, progression and responses to therapy. We study the mechanisms by which deregulated expression of lncRNAs or circRNAs influence GBM malignant phenotypes through interactions with signaling pathways. We study the molecular consequences and explore clinical applications of modulating ncRNAs and related oncogenic signaling pathways in GBM. We are establishing profiles of ncRNAs in clinical gliomas and patient-derived GSCs, and study mechanisms and biological influences of these ncRNAs in regulating GSC biology and GBM phenotypes.\n\nAberrant DNA and RNA structures in therapy-resistant GBM\n\nStandard of care treatment for GBM includes the DNA damaging agent temozolomide (TMZ), which has a known mechanism of action to target and mutate guanine bases. With this knowledge in hand, we sought to determine the effects of guanine (G) mutations in DNA and RNA secondary structure. G’s are important for creating structures like g-quadruplexes in both DNA and RNA which can affect changes in translation or be used as docking sites for DNA repair and RNA binding proteins. Using whole genome sequencing data along with isogenic drug sensitive and resistant lines, we are investigating the role of G mutations in DNA and RNA secondary structure to determine potential therapeutic avenues with the help of a chemical biologist to create novel drugs to target these TMZ-induced aberrant pathways.\n\nTargeting autophagy to treat glioma\n\nAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that removes unnecessary or dysfunctional components through a lysosome-dependent regulated mechanism, thus serving as a protective mechanism against stressors and diverse pathologies including cancer. We study mechanisms by which phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination of autophagy-related proteins regulate GSC and GBM phenotypes and autophagic response, which, in turn contributes to tumor cell survival, growth and resistance to therapy. We investigate whether disruption of these post-translational processes in autophagy-related proteins inhibits autophagy and enhances the efficacy of combination therapies in GBMs. In collaboration with a medicinal chemist, we are characterizing a next generation of novel autophagy inhibitors that specifically target a key autophagy regulator that we recently reported.\n\nMulti-omics and GBM non-responsiveness to immunotherapies\n\nGBM is categorized as a “cold” tumor that does not respond to current immunotherapies using various immune-checkpoint blockers. Although extensive efforts have been made to sensitize GBM to immunotherapies, the mechanistic studies to determine alternative therapies from understanding the underlying signaling and clinical trial results are still disappointing. We are interested in utilizing the information of multi-omics of clinical gliomas, in particular, proteomics profiling in relation to genomic and epigenomic profiling, to identify potential protein targets that could be the major modulators through post-translational modifications in these “cold” GBM tumors. We will also consider the involvement of tumor microenvironment and immune cells in these conditions. These studies are a brand-new direction that are high-risk and high-reward to turn “cold” GBM tumors to immunotherapy responsive tumors.\n\nFor more information, please see Dr. Cheng's faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nView Dr. Cheng's complete list of publications in PubMed.\n\nContact Us\n\nShi-Yuan Cheng, PhD at 312-503-5314\n\nVisit us on campus in the Lurie Building, Room 6-119, 303 E Superior Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611.\n\nRex L Chisholm\n\nResearch Area(s): Cell Biology; Computational Biology and Bioinformatics; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics\n\nMovement is a fundamental characteristic of life. Cell movement is critical for normal embryogenesis, tissue formation, wound healing and defense against infection. It is also an important factor in diseases such as cancer metastasis and birth defects. Movement of components within cells is necessary for mitosis, hormone secretion, phagocytosis and endocytosis. Molecular motors that move along microfilaments (myosin) and microtubules (dynein) power these movements. Our goal is to understand how these motors produce movement and are regulated. We wish to define their involvement in intracellular, cellular and tissue function and disease—with the long-term goal of developing therapies for the treatment of diseases caused by defects in these molecular motors.\n\nOur work involves the manipulation of myosin and dynein function in the single celled eukaryote Dictyostelium, cultured mammalian cells and transgenic and knockout mice. Yeast two-hybrid screens to identify proteins that interact with or regulate myosin and dynein and characterization of gene expression are being used to define the pathways regulating myosin and dynein. To analyze the biological significance of myosin and dynein, we use confocal and digital microscopy of living cells, analysis of cell movement, vesicle transport and cell division. We employ biochemical techniques including heterologous expression, enzyme purification and characterization and analysis of how phosphorylation state affects physiological function. We are pursuing signal transduction studies to understand the physiologically important pathways that regulate cell motility and biophysical studies such as in vitro motility assays to understand how these molecular motors function at the molecular level.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Chisholm's faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Chisholm's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Chisholm at 312-503-3209.\n\nCarla Marie Cuda\n\nResearch Area(s): Computational Biology and Bioinformatics; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Immunology; Neurobiology\n\nMy research program centers on uncovering mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) via basic and translational methodology. SLE is a chronic and multi-systemic autoimmune disease plaguing 1.5 million Americans. Among the many organ systems affected, symptoms associated with the nervous system (NP-SLE) may appear in up to 90% of SLE patients depending on the attribution model and be among the earliest signs of SLE. NP-SLE can manifest in seizures, strokes, movement disorders, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, acute confusional state, psychosis, acute encephalopathy and/or chronic neurocognitive dysfunction. Despite the devastating impact of NP-SLE on health-related quality-of-life, our understanding of causal mechanisms is limited.\n\nMicroglia, the resident innate immune cell of the brain, have recently been implicated in NP-SLE. Studies show histological evidence of microglia activation in NP-SLE patients and mouse models of disease. Microglia display regional, functional, and disease-associated heterogeneity; in particular, a disease-associated microglia (DAM) subset was recently identified in Alzheimer’s disease and aging. DAM co-localize with amyloid-b plaques, are enriched for genes involved in lysosomal, lipid metabolism and phagocytic pathways and may play a protective role in the early stages of AD by reducing amyloid-b plaque burden. However, very few studies have examined microglial heterogeneity or contributions to NP-SLE. Our group is the first to show that expression of a shared NP-SLE transcriptional signature and DAM-associated genes correlates with the severity of hippocampal- and cerebellar-associated behavioral deficits in microglia isolated from two NP-SLE models prior to overt systemic disease. Further, our single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data identify DAM NP-SLE-prone mice. However, DAM in NP-SLE are enriched for genes associated with antigen presentation but depleted for genes associated with phagocytosis, which is in contrast to DAM in AD that are critical for amyloid-b plaque-associated phagocytic functions. We also find that restricted expression of the DAM transcriptional program in NP-SLE DAM corresponds to improved behavioral outcomes in NP-SLE-prone mice following treatment with fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator that reduces microglia activation and improves blood brain barrier integrity. These discoveries mark the first to implicate DAM as a potentially pathogenic microglia subset in NP-SLE, which is in contrast to their proposed protective role in early AD development.\n\nWe also find that increasing numbers of macrophages in the brain correlates with worsening severity of behavioral deficits early in life and an expanded brain macrophage subset in end-stage disease via scRNA-seq analysis that is detectable at two months of age. Since a worse prognosis is suggested when NP-SLE accompanies lupus nephritis and infiltrating macrophages contribute to organ-specific SLE pathogenesis, we hypothesize that macrophage-specific mechanisms underlying systemic disease are conserved in kidney and brain and detectable in circulating monocytes prior to extravasation into the affected end-organ.\n\nFurther, we are translating our findings to human disease by evaluating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-resident microglia-like cells and macrophages as well as circulating monocyte subsets from NP-SLE patients via scRNA-seq to interrogate the penetrance of causative mechanisms. Thus, we are interrogating microglial and macrophage heterogeneity to dissect cell subset-specific contributions to disease with the ultimate goal of identifying critical populations and/or pathways that may serve to improve diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies in NP-SLE.\n\nPublications\n\nView lab publications via PubMed.\n\nFor more information, visit the faculty profile page of Carla Cuda, PhD.\n\nContact Us\n\nEmail Dr. Cuda\n\nPaul G DeCaen\n\nResearch Area(s): Pharmacology\n\nWe study the biophysics, pharmacology and physiology of ion channels. Currently, we are focused on two divergent groups: voltage gated sodium channels (Nav) and Polycystin channels (also called Polycystic Kidney Disease Proteins, PKDs). Aside from these foci, we actively explore novel ion channels found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells with the goal of understanding their function in cell physiology.\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nVoltage Gated Sodium Channels\n\nNavs conduct sodium ions into excitable cells like muscle and neurons, causing the cell membrane to depolarize on the microsecond time scale, a process essential for rapid communication in multicellular organisms. Potentially fatal conditions such as forms of epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmias arise when Navs are mutated.\n\nWith our collaborators, we continue to examine key questions:\n\nHow do these transmembrane proteins sense electrical potential and change from nonconductive to conductive states?\n\nHow do these transmembrane proteins select for sodium ions and not allow passage of the other ions present?\n\nWhat are the mechanisms of action of clinically relevant drugs (e.g. Valproate and Lamotrigine) and where are their receptor sites?\n\nPolycystin Channels and Primary Cilia\n\nMutations in PKD1 and PKD2 are associated with Autosomal Dominant Kidney Disease (ADPKD). ADPKD is one of the most common monogenetic diseases in mankind, where progressive cyst formation results in kidney failure. Several members of the polycystins (PKD1, PKD1-L1, PKD2 and PKD2-L1) have been found in the primary cilia from cells of various tissues besides the kidney. The primary cilium is a solitary, small (5-15 mM in length) protuberance from the apical side of polarized cells.\n\nWith help from our collaborators, our research is directed to answer key questions:\n\nHow do ADPKD mutations alter PKD2 function? Do some mutations ‘turned on’ while others ‘turn off ’ the PKD2 channel?\n\nHow does PKD1/2 channel dysfunction result in cyst formation? Or conversely, what normal function do they serve for the primary cilium and how do PKDs maintain cell polarity?\n\nWhat are the receptor sites within PKD2s that can modulation its ion channel function and are they drug-able?\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. DeCaen's faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. DeCaen's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. DeCaen at 312-503-5930.\n\nFrancesca Elizabeth Duncan\n\nResearch Area(s): Developmental and Stem Cell Biology; Reproductive Biology\n\nAging is associated with cellular and tissue deterioration and is a prime risk factor for chronic\n\ndiseases and declining health. The female reproductive system is the first to age in humans, with\n\na decline in egg quantity and quality beginning at ~35 years of age and menopause ensuing at\n\n~50 years of age. Female reproductive aging has significant health consequences as it results in\n\nendocrine function loss and is a leading cause of infertility, miscarriages, and birth defects.\n\nAlthough aging hallmarks and mechanisms have been enumerated across multiple organ\n\nsystems and species, they have not been investigated in the context of mammalian reproductive\n\naging.\n\nMy research program integrates and builds upon my 18-year history in the field of reproductive\n\nscience and medicine to investigate the overarching hypothesis that deterioration of oocyte-intrinsic\n\ncellular pathways together with alterations in the ovarian environment underlie the age-associated\n\ndecline in female gamete quantity and quality. Our work is at the interface of\n\nreproductive aging and systemic aging; physiologic and iatrogenic reproductive aging; gamete,\n\nfollicle, and ovarian biology; and reproductive science and medicine. Our comprehensive insights\n\nwill help us design targeted interventions to potentially slow or counteract reproductive aging,\n\nlaying the foundation to simultaneously improve women’s fertile-span and health-span across\n\ngenerations. In addition, reproductive aging mechanisms may inform those that precipitate\n\ngeneral aging, which occur up to decades later in life. Moreover, the mechanisms involved in\n\nreproductive aging that we are investigating - aneuploidy, protein metabolism dysregulation,\n\nand fibrosis and inflammation – are also central to other conditions such as cancer\n\npathogenesis. Thus, our research has broad impact and collaborative opportunities across\n\ndisciplines, which already include biochemistry, biophysics, toxicology and pharmacology, and\n\nreproductive endocrinology and infertility.\n\nUltimately our work in reproductive aging will have direct impacts on public health in two ways.\n\nFirst, reproductive aging affects all women, and menopause and premature aging of the ovary\n\naccelerates aging in general. Such health consequences occur because ovarian hormones such\n\nas estrogen, for example, are critical for cardiovascular, bone, immune, and cognitive functions.\n\nSecond, reproductive aging is associated with age-associated infertility, which has significant\n\nsocietal, clinical, and health ramifications as more women globally are delaying childbearing.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Duncan's faculty profile.\n\nVisit the Duncan Lab website\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Duncan's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nEmail Dr. Duncan\n\n312-503-2172\n\nMatthew Feinstein\n\nResearch Area(s): Cardiovascular and Renal Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Immunology\n\nOur lab focuses on clinical and translational immunocardiology. The central approach we use is one of reverse translation: This enables us to take insights from human phenotypes and models of disease, test and refine these insights and hypotheses in experimental models, and ultimately bring these insights to clinic. Leveraging our expertise in clinical and epidemiological research as well as translational and basic investigation, we utilize techniques including single-cell RNA-seq, spatial sequencing (in myocardial and vascular tissue), cutting edge tissue visualization techniques, and traditional immune phenotyping methods (e.g. flow cytometry) to probe the immunopathogenesis of specific cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). To support our investigation of these tissue- and disease-specific processes, we have linked complex individual-level clinical data to stored FFPE tissue specimens from >2000 patients who underwent autopsy, enabling interrogation of multi-organ interactions in the immunopathogenesis of CVDs. We developed the first model of closed-chest ischemia-reperfusion injury in nonhuman primates and use this to interrogate local and peripheral immune responses to myocardial ischemia and infarction in immune-competent and immune-dysregulated models. After we generate target- and tissue-specific hypotheses in human and large animal models, our close collaboration with the Thorp Lab through our shared Clinical and Translational Immunocardiology Program (sites.northwestern.edu/ctip) enables us to experimentally probe processes of interest in small animal and in-vitro models, then ultimately bring these insights and potential therapies to NHP models and back to humans.\n\nFor more information, see Dr. Feinstein's faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nView Dr. Feinstein's full list of publications on PubMed.\n\nContact Us\n\nMatthew Feinstein, MD\n\nDaniel R Foltz\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics\n\nMy research program is focused on the important basic question of how chromosomes are segregated during cell division to ensure the complete and accurate inheritance of the genome. Chromosome instability is a hallmark of cancer and can drive tumorigenesis. Therefore, how centromere specification is controlled is a basic biological question with great therapeutic potential. Centromeres are specified by the incorporation of a histone variant CENP-A in a centromere specific nucleosome. The stable inheritance of this locus is controlled by an epigenetic pathway and does not depend on the underlying DNA sequence. My research program is using a combination of cell biology, biochemical purification and in vitro reconstitution of centromeric chromatin to discover the mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance and CENP-A function during mitosis. A key to understanding the epigenetic inheritance of centromeres is determining the process by which new CENP-A nucleosomes are deposited. Our lab is studying how activity of the CENP-A chromatin assembly factor HJURP is coupled to existing centromeres. Non-coding RNAs, as well as chromatin modifying enzymes have been implicated in the process and we are exploring how these factors contribute to specific assembly of the CENP-A nucleosomes. We have identified novel post translational modifications of the CENP-A amino-terminus and we are working to determine how these modifications contribute to genomic stability and accurate chromosome segregation. Our immediate goal is to determine the mechanism of epigenetic centromere inheritance, with a long-term goal of delineating the role of this process in tumorigenesis so as to translate our basic understanding of the enzymes and proteins involved in this process into therapeutic approaches for genomic instability in cancer.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Foltz's faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Foltz's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Foltz at 312-503-5684.\n\nWilliam E Funk\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology\n\nRecent findings suggest that more than 70% of the risk for developing chronic diseases and cancers are due to environmental factors, which include interactions between our environment and our genes. However, the role of the environment in disease etiology remains largely unknown. To address this need, research in my laboratory is focused on biomarker discovery and targeted methods that utilize simple and non-invasive blood collection strategies to extend biomarker applications to epidemiological research.\n\nA major focus of my research is on an important class of chemical toxicants, reactive electrophiles. Because electrophiles are reactive, adducts of abundant blood proteins are used as biomarkers of exposure. Since stable adducts persist in the blood for the life span of the protein, adducts reflect an integration of exposure over weeks to months. We are applying an “adductomics” approach to a single nucleophilic ‘hot spot” on human serum albumin (HSA), HSA-Cys34, to generate adduct maps as molecular fingerprints of exposure. These adduct maps can be compared across groups to pinpoint candidate biomarkers. We are currently applying this strategy to investigate unknown risk factors associated with several cancers, congenital disorders and chronic diseases, including ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, cleft lip and cleft palate, spina bifida and cardiovascular disease.\n\nA second line of research in my laboratory focuses on the logistics of measuring biomarkers to assess environmental exposures in population-based research. An obstacle to the measurement of biomarkers is the requirement for venipuncture to obtain samples, which is expensive, invasive and needs to be performed by a trained phlebotomist near a laboratory where the blood can be immediately processed. In contrast, dried blood spots (DBS)—drops of whole blood collected on filter paper—are a simple and non-invasive alternative that can be collected in non-clinical settings. Current DBS projects in our laboratory are focused on prenatal, early childhood and adult exposures to toxic metals, including lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium. We have several ongoing collaborative projects applying DBS to assess heavy metal exposures in newborns using state-archived DBS (retrospective studies) and in pediatric populations and young children (prospective studies) using a newly developed blood collection device (Funk & McDade, Patent Pending).\n\nFuture studies are planned to combine both lines of my research and apply adductomics to DBS samples. In collaboration with the CDC’s Centers for Birth Defects Research and Prevention, we will be obtaining newborn DBS from State Public Health Laboratories to explore unknown prenatal risk factors for a variety of birth defects.\n\nFor more information visit the faculty profile of William Funk, PhD.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Funk's publications in PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nDr. Funk\n\nJaime Garcia-Anoveros\n\nResearch Area(s): Developmental and Stem Cell Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Neurobiology\n\nWe study the development of the cochlea and its innervation because it is a model organ in which to elucidate fundamental principles of development and neuroscience. Our research aims at overcoming the obstacles that lay in the way towards therapeutic regeneration and restoration of lost hearing. Current projects address how inner and outer sensory hair cells form, how they assemble with specialized supporting cells into the cellular mosaic that is the organ of Corti, and how they become innervated so as to communicate with the brain.\n\nDevelopment of inner and outer hair cells: The two mechanosensory cells in the cochlea, inner (IHC) and outer (OHC) hair cells, play complementary roles in hearing. Cochlear hair cells are produced exclusively during an early developmental period, and hence their death throughout life, whether caused by age, noise or ototoxic drugs, result in irreversible deafness. Attempts at generating new hair cells from cochlear supporting cells are under way, but we need to know how to specifically generate IHCs and OHCs, each in their appropriate location. We found that this involves a morphogen, a transcription factor that renders OHCs insensitive to it, and a master regulator that induces IHC formation and maintenance (Wiwatpanit et al., 2018, Nature; García-Añoveros et al., 2022, Nature). Having identified the major regulators, we are now able to elucidate how they execute their molecular functions and to use this information to drive the therapeutic generation of new hair cells into specifically forming IHCs or OHCs.\n\nFigure 1: Summary of the molecular mechanisms for the generation of IHCs vs OHCs.\n\nIntercellular arrangement of hair and specialized supporting cells. We are also exploring how the specialized supporting cells for IHCs and OHC are generated and assemble with them into the near crystalline mosaic that is the organ of Corti. This basic information will be critical for any regenerative attempt to restore hearing; it will also reveal fundamental mechanisms for how multiple cell types assemble to make an organ.\n\nFigure 2: Mosaic intercellular arrangement of the organ of Corti and indication of the specialized supporting cell types paired with, and separating, IHCs and OHCs.\n\nAssembly of cochlear neural circuits. The cochlea communicates with the brain via an iterative but relatively simple circuit composed of a distinct pair of afferent plus efferent neurons for IHCs, and another for OHCs. Taking advantage of our ability to interconvert IHCs into OHCs and vice versa, we begun to discover general steps for the formation of this circuit (Webber et al., 2021, Science Advances). We expect to elucidate first the general principles, and then the molecular mechanisms, guiding the development of cochlear innervation, essential for hearing and paradigmatic for neuroscience.\n\nFigure 3: Innervation of the cochlea and the sequence of signals (attractive in green and repulsive in red) by which it is achieved.\n\nFor more information, view the faculty profile of Jaime García-Añoveros, PhD or visit the Añoveros & Duggan lab site.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. García-Añoveros' publications on PubMed.\n\nVladimir I Gelfand\n\nResearch Area(s): Cell Biology; Developmental and Stem Cell Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Neurobiology; Reproductive Biology\n\nOne of the remarkable features of eukaryotic cells is their ability for rapid transport of intracellular organelles in the cytoplasm. Examples of such transport include segregation of chromosomes during cell division and the transport of organelles in neurons from the cell body into axons and dendrites. Movements of organelles are powered by molecular motors. Microtubule motors(kinesins and dyneins) move along microtubules and myosins move along microfilaments.\n\nWe use two cellular models to discover how multiple motors on the surface of the same cargo work together in organelle movement and how these motors are attached to the surface of organelles and what regulates their activity. One model is cultured pigment cells (melanophores). These cells activate movement of pigment organelles in response to hormone-modulated changes of cAMP concentration. The movement of pigment organelles is powered by three different motors (two microtubule motors of different polarity and a myosin) and this system is very convenient for analysis of motor regulation. A second model is cultured Drosophila cells that we use to individual components of transport machinery by using RNAi. In our work, we employ techniques of cell and molecular biology and computer-assisted microscopy of living cells and purified organelles as well as high-resolution and high-sensitivity biophysical methods.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Gelfand's faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Gelfand's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Gelfand at 312-503-0530.\n\nLucy A Godley\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Developmental and Stem Cell Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Immunology\n\nDr. Godley received scientific training in the Marchesi (Yale), Wiley (Harvard), and Varmus (UCSF/NIH) laboratories and medical training at Northwestern. After training in Internal Medicine and Hematology-Oncology at The University of Chicago, she held a long-time faculty position at the University of Chicago and recently relocated to Northwestern University where she is the Jeffrey and Marianne Silver Family Professor of Oncology; Director of the Silver Family Blood Cancer Institute and Clinical Director of Cancer Genetics for the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center and Division of Hematology/Oncology. Dr. Godley also runs an independent research laboratory focused on understanding the molecular pathways that drive hematopoietic malignancies, especially how germline predisposition alleles contribute to individual and family risk. Dr. Godley has contributed to the recognition of germline DDX41, ETV6, and CSF3R variants as risk factors to developing hematopoietic malignancies. She is also studying how deleterious germline RUNX1, CHEK2, and BRCA1/2 variants drive these cancers, especially considering how the development of clonal hematopoiesis and inflammatory pathways contribute to tumorigenesis. Dr. Godley has shown that germline contribution to hematopoietic malignancies occurs throughout the entire age range of life and is more common than previously anticipated, which has important implications for the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell donor pool. Along with David Wu (Univ of Washington), Dr. Godley co-chairs the Myeloid Malignancy Variant Curation Expert Panel, which has provided variant curation rules for RUNX1 that are now in use throughout the world and is currently developing similar rules for GATA2 and DDX41. Dr. Godley’s group also studies how covalently modified cytosines in DNA control cellular differentiation, specifically how hypoxia alters epigenetic modifications with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, especially during erythropoiesis. Dr. Godley practices bench to bedside medicine that advances patient care through a deep appreciation of the latest scientific findings.\n\nTo learn more, please visit Dr. Godley's faculty profile\n\nPublications\n\nSee the Dr. Godley's publications on the PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nDr. Godley.\n\nRobert Goldman\n\nResearch Area(s): Biochemistry and Structural Biology; Cancer Biology; Cell Biology; Neurobiology\n\nWe focus on the structure and function of cytoskeletal systems, particularly the intermediate filament (IF) system in fibroblasts, epithelial cells and nerve cells. IFs are composed of large families of proteins that vary in composition from one cell type to another, even among cells in the same tissue. Using a variety of techniques, we have demonstrated that IFs form elaborate networks that course throughout the cytoplasm and establish connections with both the nuclear and cell surfaces.\n\nAt the nuclear surface, they are linked either directly or indirectly with the nuclear lamins, which are chromatin-associated IF protein family members. At the level of the plasma membrane, IFs are involved as cytoskeletal linkages to the focal adhesion of fibroblasts and the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes of epithelial cells. Throughout the cytoplasm, we have shown that IFs are associated with the other cytoskeletal elements, such as microtubules and microfilaments.\n\nOur approach to studying the IF system involves biochemical, morphological, immunological, cell physiological and molecular techniques. Our hypothesis is that the IF system forms a continuous network linking the nuclear and cell surfaces, functioning in such diverse activities as the establishment and maintenance of cell shape, organelle movements within the cytoplasm, nuclear positioning, nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions and signal transduction.\n\nSince many human diseases have been linked to changes in cytoskeletal IF systems, we are also developing models to study the mechanisms involved in IF alterations in various diseases. One example is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) in which we have been able to induce neurofibrillary tangles to form in single cultured nerve cells. These tangles are similar to those found in ALS neurons. Therefore, we are able to study the effects of neurofilament tangle formation in single cells. During the summer, researchers from this laboratory also conduct studies on the mechanisms of chromatin/nuclear envelope interactions in eggs of the surf clam at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Goldman's faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Goldman's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Goldman at 312-503-4215.\n\nEva Henriette Gottwein\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Microbiology\n\nViruses commonly modify their cellular environment to optimize viral replication and persistence. Much has been learned about the intervention of viral proteins with cellular pathways. More recently, it has become clear that herpesviruses also encode large numbers of microRNAs (miRNAs). The modest amount of space miRNA precursors occupy in the viral genome, their lack of immunogenicity and their potential as regulators of gene expression make miRNAs ideal candidates for viral effectors.\n\nThe lab’s research focuses on identifying targets and functions of miRNAs encoded by the human herpesvirus Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KSHV causes cancer in immuno-compromised individuals. The clinically most relevant KSHV-induced disease is Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), a complex tumor driven by KSHV-infected endothelial cells. Due to the AIDS epidemic, KS has become the most common cancer in parts of Africa. KSHV also infects B lymphocytes and can consequently cause B cell lymphomas, including primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). KSHV constitutively expresses viral miRNAs from 12 precursors, suggesting a role of these miRNAs in viral replication and pathogenesis.\n\nMy lab is currently pursuing the comprehensive identification of mRNA targets of these miRNAs in primary effusion lymphoma cell lines and KSHV-infected endothelial cells. Our data suggest that, together, the KSHV miRNAs directly target hundreds of cellular mRNAs encoding proteins with roles in several different biological pathways. Our goal is to use this knowledge to characterize the most important functions of the KSHV miRNAs.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Gottwein's faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Gottwein's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Gottwein at 312-503-3075 or the lab at 312-503-3076.\n\nAlan R Hauser\n\nResearch Area(s): Computational Biology and Bioinformatics; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Lung Biology; Microbiology\n\nWe are using genomic approaches to examine why some bacterial strains within a species are more virulent or transmissible than others. These investigations have been applied to multidrug-resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. To date, studies have led to the identification of several novel virulence factors such as CdiA, which is a contact-dependent inhibition protein that represents a new family of virulence factors. Other studies have identified “high-risk” strains of multidrug resistant bacteria that have spread locally at our hospital or globally. We are expanding these studies to identify additional novel virulence, colonization, and antibiotic resistance factors that will then be characterized using molecular techniques, microscopy, tissue culture and mouse models to explore their mechanisms.\n\nIn a second project, we investigate the role of the type III secretion system of P. aeruginosa in pathogenesis. Type III secretion pathways form needle-like apparatuses that inject toxins directly into the cytoplasm of host cells. They are used by many gram-negative bacteria to injure or kill human cells and thus cause disease. We focus on the interaction of the secreted toxins with the host. Current projects involve the use of molecular and biochemical techniques to identify novel type III secretion effector proteins and to examine co-factors that modulate type III secretion phenotypes.\n\nThe common theme of these projects is to better understand the mechanisms by which multidrug-resistant bacteria cause disease, resist antibiotics, and spread.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Hauser's faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Hauser's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Hauser at 312-503-1044 or the lab at 312-503-1081.\n\nAmy B Heimberger\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Immunology; Pharmacology\n\nOur laboratory studies the unique immunobiology of CNS tumors that informs our development of immuno-oncology therapeutics. The laboratory has been intricately involved in a wide variety of bench-to-bedside immune therapeutics, including those that developed in the laboratory and arising from our own patents. We work collaboratively with industry on their pipeline agents to clarify indications and companion biomarkers. The laboratory carries unique expertise in the investigational new drug process and window-of-opportunity clinical trials. The laboratory conducts extensive immune profiling of patient tumors including ex vivo functional assays. Our studies are directed to how various cells interact within the tumor microenvironment and the functional implications using multiplex imaging, methylation profiling, single cell sequencing and transcriptomic analysis. Areas in which we have contributed to science include the following:\n\nEGFRvIII peptide vaccines Our laboratory co-developed with Duke University from bench-to-bedside a peptide (PEP-3-KLH/CDX-110) vaccine strategy that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII), that demonstrated induction of anti-tumor immune responses.\n\nSTAT3 mediated immune suppression and therapeutic targeting We clarified that the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 STAT3 pathway is a key molecular hub of gliomagenesis and tumor-mediated immune suppression and conducted the preclinical development of a novel small molecule inhibitor of STAT3, WP1066, for which I hold the IND. STAT3 has been considered an “un-druggable” target and this is a first-in-man agent with specificity to STAT3. This drug has been licensed to Moleculin and is now in clinical trials.\n\nGlioblastoma mediated mechanisms of immune suppression We have demonstrated that glioblastoma subverts the immune system to become tumor protective, especially by 1) driving tumor-associated microglia/macrophages to assist in potentiating gliomagenesis; 2) by recruitment of Tregs; 3) and by the intrinsic properties of cancer stem cells which are immunosuppressive on both adaptive and innate immunity. This investigative direction has provided potential therapeutic targets/strategies and biomarker elucidation.\n\nmiRNA and nanoparticle therapeutics The laboratory has elucidated the role of epigenetic microRNA regulation on tumor-mediated immune suppression, with an emphasis on potential translational therapeutic approaches. One of these strategies, miR-124 delivered with lipid nanoparticles to the immune compartment entered clinical trials in spontaneously arising gliomas in canines.\n\nImmune checkpoint therapeutics and response biomarkers Given the recent FDA approvals of immune checkpoint inhibitors for malignancies, there is great enthusiasm for their use in glioblastoma. Recent work in our lab has been focused on clarification of potential response biomarkers and identification of GBM patient subsets that may benefit.\n\nFor more information, please visit Dr. Heimberger's faculty profile or the Amy Heimberger Lab page.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Heimberger's publications on PubMed\n\nContact\n\nDr. Heimberger\n\nThomas J Hope\n\nResearch Area(s): Biochemistry and Structural Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Microbiology; Reproductive Biology\n\nWe study the posttranscriptional regulation of intronless viral messages. Intronless messages must be efficiently processed in the absence of splicing. Therefore, intronless messages must uncouple RNA processing and export from the splicing process making a simpler model system. We are currently focused on the posttranscriptional regulatory element (PRE) of the Hepadnaviruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and woodchuck hepatitis virus (WPRE). Our goal is to understand the novel mechanism of the stimulation of heterologous gene expression by the WPRE. Understanding WPRE function will allow the development of even more efficient gene expression for a variety of applications from gene therapy to large scale protein production.\n\nAlthough much is known about the molecular biology of HIV, little is known about the details of interactions between the virus and cellular components such as the cytoskeleton. To gain insights into these processes we are combining the disciplines of virology and cell biology to develop the field of cellular virology. We are especially excited by new methods we have developed – such as time-lapse analysis and fluorescent tagging – that allow for HIV to be visualized in living cells.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Hope's faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Hope's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Hope at 312-503-1360.\n\nRobert G Kalb\n\nResearch Area(s): Neurobiology\n\nGlutamatergic synapses that include the GluA1 subunit have a privileged role in activity-dependent brain development and this is driven, in part, through the assembly of a large multi-protein complex in the post-synaptic density. A critical molecular component of this complex is the scaffolding protein SAP97. Among the >90 known SAP97 binding partners we have determined that a novel protein called CRIPT plays an essential role in this process. Humans with mutations in CRIPT have a severe developmental brain disorder. We are using a variety of approaches to understand the mechanisms by which CRIPT controls synapse biology and dendrite growth including: 1) study of a conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse that we built, 2) super-resolution imaging of glutamate receptors/TARPs/MAGUKs using neurons derived from patient iPS cells and 3) electrophysiology of dissociated neurons and hippocampal slices from the cKO mice. Insight into the molecular logic of SAP97/CRIPT function will have implications for childhood maladies such as intellectual disability and autism/autism-spectrum disorders.\n\nIn our studies of adult onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia we find evidence for maladaptive changes in cellular intermediary metabolism and proteostasis. Ongoing metabolomics interrogations are uncovering why changes in fuel utilization are toxic and discovering new targets for therapeutic intervention. The relationship between altered metabolism and perturbed protein homeostasis is also an area of intense interest with special focus on a proteasome adaptor protein called RAD23. Our experimental platforms are: 1) cells from patients with various genetic abnormalities (i.e., mutations in C9orf72, TDP43, etc.) differentiated into neurons, 2) C.elegans, and 3) primary rat/mouse neurons. Targeting proximal events in neurodegenerative diseases will lead to novel therapeutic approaches.\n\nFor lab information and more, visit Dr. Kalb's faculty profile or the Kalb Lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Kalb's publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Kalb at 312-503-5358\n\nAtsushi Kato\n\nResearch Area(s): Immunology\n\nThe Kato Lab primarily focuses on the mechanism of type 2 inflammation in airway inflammatory diseases in humans. Currently, we use chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) as a model disease of type 2 inflammation. CRS is an inflammation of the nose and sinuses that blocks the air passages, causes headache and leads to loss of sleep, depression and reduced quality of life. CRSwNP which is a severe case of CRS, is well characterized by tissue eosinophilia with high levels of type 2 cytokines including IL-5 and IL-13. However, the mechanisms of type 2 inflammation in nasal polyps are still not well understood. The Kato Lab is currently focused on an epithelial-derived cytokine, TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin), that is an IL-7-like cytokine molecule and is now recognized as an important regulator of type 2 inflammation in nasal polyps. We recently identified that TSLP is highly up-regulated in nasal polyps. TSLP is known to directly and indirectly induce type 2 inflammation via the activation of dendritic cells, Th2 cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and mast cells which are all elevated in nasal polyps. My laboratory is currently investigating the role of Th2 cells, ILC2s, mast cells and dendritic cells in the amplification of type 2 inflammation and how TSLP contributes to type 2 inflammation through these cell types in nasal polyps. In contrast to CRSwNP, inflammatory patterns in non-polypoid CRS (CRSsNP) are much less understood. Recently, the PI’s laboratory fully characterized patterns of inflammatory cytokines in the nasal mucosa of control subjects and patients with CRS. We found that CRSsNP displays heterogenous inflammation and this heterogeneity in CRSsNP might be responsible for the inconsistency of results in CRSsNP-related studies. We are also currently working on understanding the effect of inflammatory endotypes on clinical phenotypes in CRSsNP.\n\nFor more information, view the faculty profile for Atsushi Kato, PhD.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Kato's publications in PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nDr. Kato\n\nNeil Lindstrom Kelleher\n\nResearch Area(s): Biochemistry and Structural Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics\n\nThe main focus for our Top Down Proteomics subgroup is to push the limits for whole proteome analysis of mammalian cells, striving for a future in which Top Down analysis rivals that of Bottom Up in the number of protein identifications per run. Recently, we have seen progress toward this very goal with the introduction of a separation platform specifically designed to minimize the most common problem in Top Down Proteomics, intact protein separations. This platform effectively reduces sample complexity and separates proteins depending on size, resulting in an opportunity for the scientist to select the optimal analysis method for the sample.\n\nOur Natural Products subgroup is focused on the discovery and biosynthesis of novel natural products. Developments from this subgroup include the introduction of the PrISM platform, geared towards the identification of natural products synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) without prior knowledge of a gene sequence. This is made possible by our ability to detect a phosphopantetheinyl (Ppant) ejection marker ion for NRPS/PKS thiolation domains. We also work in collaboration with groups from other universities to provide mass spectrometry analysis of novel biochemical systems.\n\nWe also have a long-standing interest in histone analysis. Our Chromatin Oncobiology and DNA-Damage subgroup continues to dig deeper into the \"histone code\", a complex mixture of post-translational modifications that together determine a host of cellular processes. We are interested in visualizing dynamic histone PTM changes simultaneously on multiple sites. Through application of technology developed in our Top Down Proteomics subgroup, we are able to apply \"Precision Proteomics\" to histone analysis.\n\nFor more information, visit the Kelleher Lab Web Page or see Dr. Kelleher's faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nView lab publications via PubMed.\n\nContact Us\n\nContact Dr. Kelleher or the Kelleher Lab at 847-467-1086 or 847-467-4362.\n\nDavid J Klumpp\n\nResearch Area(s): Immunology; Microbiology; Pharmacology\n\nOur laboratory employs state-of-the-art cell culture and animal models to pursue multi-disciplinary projects in bacterial pathogenesis and neuro-immune interactions in a crippling pain syndrome. A key to our success is the rich training environment resulting from the close collaboration between clinical and basic scientists.\n\nUrinary tract infection (UTI) is both a major medical issue and a fascinating problem of bacterial pathogenesis. We investigate all aspects of host pathogen interactions, from the immediate biochemical signaling evoked in bladder cells, to the associated inflammation, to the development of adaptive immune responses. We recently identified a novel signaling response of bladder cells induced by binding of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) that mediates the mutually exclusive processes of epithelial cell apoptosis and bacterial invasion of bladder epithelial cells; how this occurs is an active area of study. We have also identified a candidate live-attenuated UTI vaccine based on a UPEC mutant. We find that the UPEC mutant vaccine induces protective responses 100-fold greater than wild type UPEC. We are now determining the mechanism of this enhanced response by testing the hypothesis that the UPEC mutant skews the normal immune response and thus generates a more effective immunity.\n\nAlthough pelvic pain can result from acute infection, interstitial cystitis (IC) is a debilitating chronic pelvic pain syndrome of unknown origin that is often considered a chronic bladder inflammation. We utilize a herpesvirus to induce an IC-like condition in mice Using this model, we have identified the mechanisms that result in both bladder pathophysiology and pelvic pain. Interestingly, while both pain and bladder damage require mast cell activation, pelvic pain results from the release of mast cell histamine, whereas bladder pathology is driven by mast cell release of tumor necrosis alpha (TNF). Current studies include the genetic basis of pain susceptibility, the spinal regulation of histamine and TNF release and the viral basis of pain. In addition, we recently were awarded a prestigious NIH center grant to study pelvic pain syndromes. The center award will extend our bladder pelvic pain studies to prostate- and bowel-associated pelvic pain and determine the mechanisms of pelvic organ crosstalk and signal integration in the spinal cord in mice. Our center collaborators will examine cortical and cognitive changes in pelvic pain patients using a combination of functional MRI and behavioral tests and develop novel quality-of-life tests to characterize pelvic pain non-invasively within populations. Thus, this center will illuminate pelvic pain mechanisms in clinical, epidemiologic and basic animal studies.\n\nFor more information, visit Dr. Klumpp's faculty profile.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Klumpp's publications in PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nDr. Klumpp\n\nLaimonis A Laimins\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Microbiology; Reproductive Biology\n\nOur efforts are divided into two main categories:\n\nAn examination of how the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 contribute to the development of malignancy\n\nStudies on the mechanisms controlling the viral life cycle in differentiating epithelia\n\nMore than 100 distinct types of human papillomavirus have been identified and approximately one-third specifically target squamous epithelial cells in the genital tract. Of these genital papillomaviruses, a subset including types 16,18 and 31 have been shown to be the etiological agents of most cervical cancers.\n\nOne of our goals is to understand why infection by specific HPV types contributes to the development of malignancy. For these studies we have examined the interaction of the oncoproteins E6 and E7 with cellular proteins. In particular, E6 binds the p53 protein and facilitates its degradation by a ubiquitin-mediated pathway. It also activates telomerase as well as associates with PDZ-domain containing proteins. The interactions of the E6 and E7 proteins with these cellular proteins are being examined at both the biochemical and genetic level.\n\nIn examining the papillomavirus life cycle, we have used organotypic tissue culture systems to faithfully reproduce the differentiation program of epithelial cells in the laboratory. Using this system, the viral life cycle has been duplicated. We are studying the mechanisms that regulate viral DNA replication, cell entry, immune evasion and gene expression. These studies should provide insight into viral pathogenesis as well as the mechanisms regulating epithelial differentiation.\n\nFor lab information and more, see Dr. Laimins' faculty profile and lab website.\n\nPublications\n\nSee Dr. Laimins' publications on PubMed.\n\nContact\n\nContact Dr. Laimins at 312-503-0648 or the lab at 312-503-0650.\n\nShannon M Lauberth\n\nResearch Area(s): Cancer Biology; Cell Biology; Genetics, Epigenetics and Genomics; Immunology\n\nThe Lauberth Lab is located in the department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and is located"
