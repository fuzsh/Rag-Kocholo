All declared Physics majors meeting the above criteria will be considered for this scholarship.\n\nAlice Estes Martin Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship is awarded annually to a qualified physics major who is committed to teaching physics in secondary education. The recipient must be a rising junior or senior with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.7, and is chosen on the basis of (1) evidence of dedication to excellence in the teaching profession and (2) academic achievement. No application form is necessary. All declared Physics majors meeting the above criteria will be considered for this scholarship.\n\nWebster and Sara Schoene Richardson Memorial Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship is awarded annually to a Physics major who exemplifies excellence in scholarhsip and departmental service. No application form is necessary. All declared Physics majors meeting the above criteria will be considered for this scholarship.\n\nHugh D. Ussery Scholarship\n\nThis scholarhsip is given annually to a rising junior Physics major who exemplifies excellence in scholarhsip and promise for a rewarding career in Physics. No application form is necessary. All declared Physics mjors meeting the above criteria will be considered for this scholarship.\n\nFrank Leigh Robeson Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship is awarded to a Physics major who has demonstrated achievement, personal integrity, extracurricular leadership, community services, and an appreciation of Physics. No application form is necessary. All declared Physics majors meeting the above criteria will be considered for this scholarship.\n\nColonel Nelson Carey Brown Memorial Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship is awarded annually to an incoming freshman who demonstrates both academic ability (as evidence by the maintenance of at least a 3.0 grade point average) and financial need. No application form is necessary. All declared Physics majors meeting the above criteria will be considered for this scholarship.\n\nDaniel C. and Delia F. Grant Endowed Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship is given (1) to an incoming freshman with preference for a national merit scholarship, which is renewable for three more years if the awardee is a national merit scholar and maintains the minimum of 3.5 GPA, and (2) to an outstanding rising junior or senior, if the second scholarship is not already awarded to a continuing merit scholar. No application form is necessary. All declared Physics majors meeting the above criteria will be considered for this scholarship.\n\nRobert Lee Bowden, Jr. Essay Prize\n\nIn today's world, writing and communication skills for science students are becoming ever more critical. Almost all career paths require effective communication with non-technical audiences and the general public. In 2008, the Bowden Prize was established in order to encourage and reward excellent science writing.\n\nH. Y. Loh Award\n\nThis award is given annually to one or more graduating seniors in Physics who exemplify excellence in scholarship. No application form is necessary. All declared Physics majors meeting the above criteria will be considered for this scholarship.\n\nRobert C. Richardson Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship is awarded annually to a Physics major.
