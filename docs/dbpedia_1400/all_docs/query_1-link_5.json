        "text": "General | 6/30/2020 11:46:00 AM\n\nBLOOMSBURG, Pa. - The Bloomsburg University athletic department is excited to announce its six major postseason award winners and team MVPs for the 2019-20 season. The awards consist of the Danny Litwhiler Underclass Male Athlete of the Year, the Joanne McComb Underclass Female Athlete of the Year, the Robert B. Redman Senior Male Athlete of the Year, the Eleanor Wray Senior Female Athlete of the Year, and the Outstanding Senior Male and Female Scholar-Athletes of the Year.\n\nJOANNE MCCOMB UNDERCLASS FEMALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nLauren Hoelke - Women's Soccer\n\nHoelke helped the Huskies to another impressive campaign in 2019. The Huskies won their second consecutive Atlantic Regional title and finished the 2019 season with an 18-3-1 and a second straight trip to the Elite Eight. Bloomsburg's 18 wins tied the program record for most victories in a season, which was initially established in 1996 when the Huskies went 18-3-1 under Hall of Fame coach Chuck Laudermilch. Meanwhile, the Huskies' 35 wins over the last two seasons established a new program record.\n\nOn the pitch, Hoelke, highlighted by her Second Team All-American honors by both United Soccer Coaches and the Division II Conference Commissioners Association (D2CCA), enjoyed her best season in a Huskies' uniform as she established career-highs in goals (13) and points (36) while adding a team-high ten assists to lead Bloomsburg in scoring during the 2019 campaign. Hoelke's 13 goals marked the most by a Bloomsburg player in a single season since Katie Walczuk scored 13 during the 2010 season. Meanwhile, Hoelke's 36 points are tied for eighth-most in a single season in program history and are the most since Alea Balthaser (45) and Renee Williams (37) during the 2001 campaign. The junior midfielder was tied for second on the team with three game-winning goals and led the team with 71 shot attempts and 32 shots on goal.\n\nHoelke scored at least one goal in half of Bloomsburg's 22 matches and registered at least one point in 16 different contests. She started all 22 contests and was also tops on the team by going 5-for-5 on penalty kick opportunities, including the Huskies' lone goal in the 2-1 loss to St. Rose in the Elite Eight.\n\nShe will enter her senior season with 19 goals and 25 assists for 63 career points. She ranks fourth in program history in career helpers and tenth all-time in career points.\n\nOff the field, Hoelke has a 3.41 cumulative grade point average (GPA) while majoring in elementary education and special education and was named a 2019 NCAA Division II Second Team Scholar All-American by United Soccer Coaches.\n\nDANNY LITWHILER UNDERCLASS MALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nColton Schnars – Men's Swimming\n\nSchnars had a strong sophomore season in the pool for the Huskies and helped the men's swimming team to conclude the 2019-20 season ranked 25th in the country according to the final College Swimming and Diving Coaches Association of America (CSCAA) Division II dual meet poll.\n\nSchnars earned his first two All-American honors at the 2020 NCAA Division II National Championships in the 200-yard freestyle relay and the 100-yard backstroke. Earlier in the year, Schnars was a four-time PSAC champion after earning gold in the 200-yard backstroke, the 200-yard freestyle relay, and the 200- and 400-yard medley relays. He added a second-place result in the 100-yard backstroke at the conference meet. During the course of the season, he broke the school record in both the 100-yard backstroke (48.75) and the 200-yard backstroke (1:48.31).\n\nIn just two seasons, Schnars is a two-time All-American, a five-time PSAC champion, and a ten-time All-PSAC member. He also won the program's Performance Award in 2018-19.\n\nSchnars was named PSAC Swimmer of the Week once this past season.\n\nSchnars holds a 3.52 GPA while majoring in health sciences. He was a PSAC Scholar-Athlete following the 2018-19 and the 2019-20 campaigns.\n\nELEANOR WRAY SENIOR FEMALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nOUTSTANDING SENIOR FEMALE SCHOLAR-ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nBecca Cubbler – Women's Swimming\n\nCubbler capped her illustrious career with the women's swimming team as she was named both the Senior Female Athlete of the Year and Outstanding Senior Female Scholar-Athlete of the Year following her performance both in and out of the pool during the 2019-20 academic year. Cubbler became just the third student-athlete from Bloomsburg to be named the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) Pete Nevins Female Scholar-Athlete of the Year and the first to receive the honor since Shelly Miller (field hockey/softball) following the 1994-95 season.\n\nCubbler wrapped up a sensational four-year career with the Huskies by earning three All-American honors at the 2020 NCAA Division II National Championships. The senior placed tenth in the 1000-yard freestyle with a time of 10:02.63 in the only event she was able to compete in at the championships. However, based on adjusted criteria announced following the cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cubbler earned two more All-American nods in the events she was also invited to participate in, finishing 11th in the 500-yard freestyle (4:53.82) and 16th in the 1650-yard freestyle (17:00.21). Before the NCAAs, Cubbler won her first career individual title at the PSAC championships after finishing first in the 200-yard freestyle (1:51.14).\n\nAlso, at this year's conference championships, Cubbler was a six-time All-PSAC honoree after winning the 200-yard freestyle and finishing second in the 500-yard freestyle, 1000-yard freestyle, and 1650-yard freestyle. She also was a part of the 800-yard freestyle relay and 400-yard medley relay teams that finished third at the conference meet.\n\nCubbler graduates as one of the top swimmers in program history. She wraps up her brilliant career as a six-time All-American, an 18-time All-PSAC honoree, a two-time PSAC Champion, and competed at the NCAA Division II National Championships in each of her four seasons. She also owns six school records - the 200-yard freestyle, the 500-yard freestyle, the 1000-yard freestyle, the 400-yard medley relay, the 400-yard freestyle relay, and the 800-yard freestyle relay.\n\nOut of the pool, Cubbler is a three-time D2 ADA Scholar-Athlete, a four-time PSAC Scholar-Athlete, a three-time NCAA Academic All-American, a two-time College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) First Team Academic All-American®, and a two-time member of the PSAC Winter Top Ten list.\n\nCubbler, who majors in early childhood education and special education, finished out her four-year career with a 3.91 cumulative GPA.\n\nLast week, Cubbler became the 11th different student-athlete ever at Bloomsburg to capture the Academic All-America® honor from CoSIDA in back-to-back seasons. However, she became the first female in school history - third overall - to earn First Team Academic All-America® honors in consecutive years. Only a pair of men's soccer student-athletes - Bryce Shaffer (2011, 2012) and Josh Smith (2015, 2016) - accomplished that feat prior to Cubbler.\n\nROBERT B. REDMAN SENIOR MALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nKyle Dix – Men's Swimming\n\nDix helped the Huskies to a second-place finish at the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) championships for the fifth-straight year and collected six All-PSAC honors to cap his incredibly successful career. All told, Dix won 11 PSAC titles and was an eight-time All-American for Bloomsburg. Dix competed at NCAAs four times, including the shortened championship meet in 2020. The redshirt season earned 25 All-PSAC performances throughout his career and was named the PSAC Freshman of the Year in 2016 and won the Danny Litwhiler Award in 2019.\n\nDuring the 2020 PSAC championships, Dix won four titles, including the individual title in the 100-yard breaststroke for the second-straight year. Dix helped the 200-yard medley relay, 400-yard medley relay, and the 200-yard freestyle relay teams to titles as well. Dix picked up the silver medal in the 50-yard freestyle and the 100-yard freestyle while taking the bronze in the 100-yard butterfly.\n\nThe 200-yrd freestyle relay team earned an NCAA 'B' cut with a time of 1:21.02 and earned a spot in the NCAA championships.\n\nDix holds seven school records, including having a hand in all five relay records at Bloomsburg.\n\nDix was named a PSAC Scholar-Athlete following the 2019-20 season.\n\nOUTSTANDING SENIOR MALE SCHOLAR-ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\nTrevor Allard - Wrestling\n\nAllard spent most of the 2019-20 season nationally-ranked at 184 pounds and earned an at-large bid to the NCAA championships following the season. Allard posted a 24-4 overall record following his fifth-place finish at the Mid-American Conference (MAC) tournament and went 3-2 in the championships and was four wins shy of becoming the 19th member of the 100-win club in program history.\n\nFollowing the season, Allard was named to the 2019-20 MAC All-Academic Team. To be named to the MAC All-Academic Team, a student-athlete must have at least a 3.20 cumulative grade-point average (GPA) and have participated in at least 50 percent of the regular season meets.
