        "text": "August 2024\n\nIt is time! The return of the 2024-25 student-athletes is just around the corner. The Huskies men’s soccer team is currently participating in a Foreign Tour in Portugal, with the football squad returning to campus for the first practice on August 12. The following Monday the remainder of the traditional fall sports report back to Pettit Athletic Complex, with men’s and women’s soccer, volleyball, field hockey, and men’s and women’s cross country beginning their fall seasons. The week after, tennis and golf will begin preparing for their fall campaigns as well. It is time … A great time to be a Husky!\n\nA lot has occurred since I last scribed the happenings of Husky Athletics in June through the From the ADs Desk column. Let me try to give you a quick recap. Regarding our staffing, we are in the final stages of hiring a new Wrestling coach staff, following the departure of Marcus Gordon and Russ Hughes. Additionally, we have added to the Football staff with Tim Landis (Offensive Coordinator/Quarterbacks), Zach Martin (Defensive Coordinator/Linebackers), Johnathan Pruden (Defensive Backs), Greg Kahn (Defensive Line), and Josh Bernocco (Wide Receives/Special Teams Coordinator). In track and field and cross country, Coach Bernie Empie welcomed Marcus Disbrow as an assistant coach.\n\nIn the next edition of From the ADs Desk, I will provide you with the new Graduate Assistant Coaches and Administration who are joining or returning to the Huskies.\n\nA couple of other exciting elements for the Husky Athletic program occurred in July. Mary Raskob, Bloomsburg’s director of athletic communications and marketing, was named the President of the Eastern Athletic Communications Association (EAST-COMM). And, yours truly, Dr. McFarland was named President of the Division 2 Athletic Directors Association for the 2024-25 year.\n\nWith the start of the year upon us, please be sure to join us for the Second Annual Tyler Horst Run/Walk to kick-off the year. This year’s event will be Sunday, August 25 and we look forward to having you join us. The event will begin at 9 a.m. and will start and finish at Danny Hale Field at Redman Stadium with the one-mile occurring around the track and the 5K run will be out on the cross country course around the practice/intramural fields. Last year’s event was a huge success with all the proceeds from this event directly funding the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center. It is open to everyone. For registration information, please visit. Thanks for your continued support.\n\nSpeaking of supporting our student-athletes. We also want to take a moment to honor them.\n\nThe Bloomsburg Athletics department announced its seven major award winners on July 17. These awards include the Outstanding Senior Scholar-Athlete of the Year (male and female), the Senior Athlete of the Year (Robert B. Redman male honoree and Eleanor Wray female awardee), and the Underclass Athlete of the Year (Danny Litwhiler male and Joanne McComb female). Past winners of these prestigious honors can be found here. This year’s class includes: Bella Culp, Joanne McComb Underclass Female Athlete of the Year; Kody Besser, Danny Litwhiler Underclass Male Athlete of the Year; Madison Coyle, Eleanor Wray Senior Female Athlete of the Year; Nick Fiddler, Robert B. Redman Senior Male Athlete of the Year; Amanda Stoll, Outstanding Senior Female Scholar-Athlete of the Year; and, Andrew Basile, Outstanding Senior Male Scholar-Athlete of the Year. Congratulations to each of these amazing Husky student-athletes.\n\nAdditionally, the Bloomsburg Huskies led the PSAC with 307 Scholar-Athletes during the 2023-24 season – that is remarkable and telling of the academic drive of our students. There were 18 institutions eligible for the Scholar-Athlete honors and for Bloom to top all of them is a great feat by our student-athletes – and our coaches who support their academics! Way to go Huskies!\n\nAlso, the Bloomsburg Athletics Hall of Fame Committee has established Sunday, Oct. 13 as this fall’s induction date for the 2024 Class. There will be an announcement during the first week in August for the induction class. But, please mark your calendars to join us at the Homecoming Weekend to celebrate some great history.\n\nTime to download your Huskies schedule by visiting the website, and to stay current with any other happenings within Husky Athletics. And, in the coming days, IT IS TIME – Go Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nJune/July 2024\n\nWelcome to the end of spring and the start of summer with this edition of From the ADs Desk. The academic year has concluded, now we enter camp/clinic season and other events to support our student-athletes.\n\nWe just wrapped up an extremely successful event at our home golf course Frosty Valley. Football hosted, in conjunction with the Devlin family (thank you to all the family members who attended) the 25th Anniversary of the John S. Devlin Memorial Golf Tournament. At the conclusion of the golf event we honored former Head Coach Danny Hale with a picnic and celebration, in honor of his induction into the College Football Hall of Fame this coming December. If you are planning to attend the December event, please let me know so we can ensure we have all the Bloomsburg Huskies sitting together to honor Coach Hale. We also welcomed the Husky Legacy Club at the event, with a lot more information coming so please check your e-mail regarding this great group that will further support the efforts of the football program.\n\nA special Thank You to Tim and Carol Wagner, from the Class of 1974, for their continued support of the Huskies and helping us succeed in advancing our student-athlete opportunities. First, they supported the John S. Devlin Golf Outing this year commemorating the 25th anniversary of the event, and second have agreed to partner with Husky Athletics to provide Game Plan, an educational software service that provides a host of holistic learning modules for the student-athletes. We cannot thank them enough for their continued support.\n\nI am also pleased to announce that Bloomsburg Athletics has extended its partnership with Under Armour and BSN Sports to outfit our student-athletes, coaches, and staff. This is our third contract overall with UA/BSN and we are pleased to partner as the official equipment supplier to all 23 varsity programs.\n\nThere are a host of awards and honors to recap. The highlight will be the Bloomsburg Athletics major award winners which will be announced on July 17. These awards include the Outstanding Senior Scholar-Athlete of the Year (male and female), the Senior Athlete of the Year (Robert B. Redman male honoree and Eleanor Wray female awardee), and the Underclass Athlete of the Year (Danny Litwhiler male and Joanne McComb female). Past winners of these prestigious honors can be found here.\n\nOther highlights from the spring include Head Baseball Coach Mike Collins winning his 400th career game this season. Coach Collins continues to do things right while leading the Huskies.\n\nOn the student-athlete side, women’s lacrosse capped their 2024 season with the Freshman of the Year, as well as an All-Conference honoree. Kayla Stressman captured the PSAC East Freshman of the Year honors while Madison Coyle earned a spot on the All-PSAC East first team. As a team, the Huskies finished the regular season ranked number one in NCAA DII in caused turnovers per game (15.29) and ground balls per game (25.24) and are receiving votes in the final IWLCA poll of the regular season. In softball, there were five student-athletes being named to the CSC Academic All-District team, while junior Callie Sowers earned D2CCA All-Athletic Region athletic honors. Men’s and Women’s tennis featured academic and athletic awards. Men’s tennis posted two CSC Academic All-District selections, while having Denis Dementev earn was named PSAC Freshman of the Year, along with two all-conference awardees. The women’s team boasted three players on the PSAC Eastern Division All-Conference roster, earning four honors.\n\nIn other exciting news, two former Husky football standouts are now on the 2024-25 College Football Hall of Fame ballot. As you know, Coach Hale will be inducted this December, and both Jahri Evans and Franklyn Quiteh are now on the ballot for consideration to the Hall of Fame. This is a tremendous honor for two great men.\n\nAlso, the Bloomsburg Athletics Hall of Fame Committee has established Sunday, Oct. 13 as this fall’s induction date for the 2024 Class. There will be an announcement later in June/early July for the induction class. But, please mark your calendars to join us at the Homecoming Weekend to celebrate some great history.\n\nWe are excited for some work at the Pettit Athletic Complex this summer. The projects may not be glamorous, but will benefit our student-athletes. First, we will be completing court repairs at the Burt Reese Tennis Center and finalizing the viewing platform, thanks to a gift from former head coach Marty Coyne. Second, there are going to be roof repairs on Nelson Fieldhouse over the gymnasium. And, finally, we are completing the stages of bidding for a full light replacement at Steph Pettit Stadium converting to energy efficient LED lights while increasing the candle-wattage by almost double. As always, there will be other projects and general up-keep throughout the Pettit Athletic Complex at each venue as well.\n\nTwo glamorous projects are occurring this summer. The first gift comes to us from Bob and Gigi Gibble as we finalize the naming of the baseball scoreboard, which was installed at Danny Litwhiler Field in 2022. The scoreboard will bear the name “Bob Gibble Scoreboard” later this summer, in time for the fall season. Thank you, Bob, and family for your continued support.\n\nThe second gift is from former student-athlete and long-time supporter of Bloomsburg Athletics, Sharon Gettel who has established an endowment to name the student-athlete lounge in Nelson Fieldhouse. The “Sharon Gettel Student-Athlete Lounge” will allow further enhancements to the room that features computers, a group workspace, and individual study areas. We cannot thank Sharon enough for supporting our current student-athletes academically, and through scholarship support.\n\nFrom the ADs Desk will return in August as we prepare for the fall season!\n\nPlease remember to visit the website regularly as we will be announcing recruits for the 2024-25 season, as well as the team schedules, and any other happenings within Husky Athletics.\n\nEnjoy summer and if you are in Bloomsburg, please visit us in Nelson Fieldhouse!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nMay 2024\n\nThat’s a wrap … Well, almost. April brings with it PSAC Championships and the end of the academic year. May wraps it all up nicely. Exams are next week, along with Commencement, while PSAC Championships have completed in women’s golf, start in tennis, softball, and track this week, with lacrosse next week.\n\nThe women’s golf team, in their short history, finished the championship with its best-ever finish of seventh. Two players were in the top-25 and there is excitement for the future of the program. Women’s tennis heads to West Chester as the third seed, while the men’s team wrapped up the fourth seed and will compete this weekend at the Burt Reese Tennis Center on the campus of Bloomsburg. The fourth-ranked team in the region, Bloomsburg softball, finished as the Eastern Division’s fifth-seed and will battle for the PSAC crown in Quakertown, May 1-4. The men’s and women’s track teams will battle at the Outdoor PSAC Championship, May 3-5 at Shippensburg. In women’s lacrosse, there are two games left for the Huskies and winning both would solidify a spot in the PSAC post-season. These are exciting times for sure for the Husky student-athletes and coaches.\n\nThis past weekend saw the coaches and teams of Field Hockey, Women’s Soccer, and Men’s Soccer welcome back alumni. There were alumni games and gatherings for the teams. It was great seeing former Huskies back on campus supporting the current student-athletes! Thank you for the impact and mark you left on your program, and most importantly, for still playing a part in the future success of our teams.\n\nWhen I last wrote, we are embarking on the Huskies Annual Day of Giving. The two-day, 24-hour event saw the Husky faithful support a majority of our teams, support the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center, and support of athletics in general. The Husky Athletics team WON the day with the highest giving of all of the areas at Bloomsburg. We cannot thank you enough for your support of our teams, student-athletes, and projects.\n\nWe are in the process of finalizing and connecting with the 2024 Hall of Fame Class. This great group of individuals will join 208 members with the 42nd Annual induction on Sunday, Oct. 13, 2024, as part of the Homecoming Weekend events. Make sure to review the previous inductees and nominate any deserving Huskies for future years’ selections.\n\nI will be back in June to give some additional and full updates as we enter the summer months!\n\nPlease visit the website for the latest team schedules and Husky updates as we navigate the PSAC post-season.\n\nEnjoy the end of the year (academic and athletic) and if you are headed to Bloomsburg, please stop in as we would love to see you and show you all the great things happening in athletics!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nApril 2024\n\nIn higher education, as in intercollegiate athletics, April is the dreaded month. The weather is still sketchy with constant changes needed in games, the academic schedule is winding down with post-mid-terms, final assignments and finals, and conference and NCAA championships loom around the corner. But April is not short on activity either! Every day brings a new challenge, a new game, and new goals.\n\nOne of the elements is the annual Officials Appreciation Week. This year, the thrice-annual event, falls April 1-7 where student-athletes and coaches will celebrate and thank officials for what they do day-in and day-out. If you are attending a Huskies contest be sure to listen for the PA announcement and help us Thank an Official.\n\nIn the theme of thank yous … Please be sure to join us on the Huskies Annual Day of Giving as a way to thank those who came before you. The two-day, 24-hour event is your opportunity to support the Huskies, support the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center, and to support the team of your choice. As with athletics, this two-day Day of Giving competition, is a challenge to all current and former Huskies, fans and friends, parents and supporters, to help us “win” the day!\n\nAcademic awards are starting to come in – with PSAC awards still to come as well. Two members of the Bloomsburg women’s basketball were named CSC Academic All-District selections. The honorees include junior guards Allison Hileman and Lauren Kirsch. Our student-athletes continue to amaze with their performances in the classroom and in their sport.\n\nHusky Athletics continues to make some moves. Lee Anderson has joined the family as the new Huskies volleyball coach, while Tim Landis has joined the football staff. Rounding out the athletic training room is Carl Andrews, who joins the first-class team of trainers serving the Husky student-athletes. Join me in welcoming this great group of individuals to Bloomsburg Athletics.\n\nMore awards are coming soon too! In the coming weeks, Bloomsburg should be announcing the 2024 Hall of Fame Class. This great group of individuals will join 208 members with the 42nd Annual induction on Sunday, Oct. 13, 2024, as part of the Homecoming Weekend events. Make sure to review the previous inductees and nominate any deserving Huskies for future years’ selections.\n\nBloomsburg Athletics has applied for two grants to support our student-athletes and community. The first is an NCAA Coaching Education Grant to support expansion of the Cross Country and Track programs while adding an additional coach to the growing roster. The second grant, awarded on March 19, 2024, was the USTA and ITA Collegiate Community Hub Award. The tennis grant’s intent is to defray some of the costs associated with providing tennis programs that are open to the public through your Collegiate Community Hub. Both of these grants support Bloomsburg Athletics and continue to advance the offerings to our student-athletes and through the community.\n\nApril, as I mentioned is packed with events – from the Spring Football Game (April 12 at 6pm) to conference games, to championships. Be sure to stay tuned to the website for the latest schedules and other Husky updates through the website as games may be adjusted based on weather.\n\nWe hope to see you soon!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nMarch 2024\n\nAs I sit waiting for today’s rainy-day lacrosse home opener, we are turning the page on winter sports and welcoming spring activity – and hopefully improved weather.\n\nThe spring season brings, not only, warmer days but the return of outside sports with track, tennis, lacrosse, baseball, golf, and softball. Upcoming, the Bloomsburg Foundation will be hosting its annual Day of Giving, April 18-19. The two-day, 24-hour event is your opportunity to support the Huskies, support the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center, and to support the team of your choice. As with athletics, this two-day Day of Giving competition, is a challenge to all current and former Huskies, fans and friends, parents and supporters, to help us “win” the day! We appreciate any and all support you can provide.\n\nIn other celebratory events, the Field Hockey program will host its annual Alumni Game and Social on April 28, while men’s soccer will also host an alumni weekend April 26-27. The 25th anniversary of the John S. Devlin Golf Tournament will be Saturday, June 1 at Frosty Valley to support Bloomsburg Football. Stay tuned to the Alumni website for any new or additional events.\n\nLater this spring we will be announcing some special details for a Make-A-Wish (MAW) Reveal. Bloomsburg student-athletes fundraised for MAW and have been awarded a third reveal since 2018. This honor is amazing as the student-athletes must raise more than $10,000 in a year to be awarded a wish.\n\nTo wrap-up the winter championship season, swimming and indoor track have completed while wrestling (MAC Championship at Kent State, March 8-9) is still to be contested.\n\nKeystone Aquatics Center hosted the 2024 swimming event and the Huskies finished in third for both the men and the women. There were some amazing finishes from both squads and junior Rylee Wenzel and freshman Grace McBlain posted NCAA qualifying times for the NCAA Championships.\n\nIn the men’s and women’s PSAC Indoor Track Championship, the Huskies were led by Kelley Selheimer on the women’s side and Doug Walsh on the men’s side. Selheimer picked up two medals as the Bloomsburg women's indoor track and field team racked up seven podium finishes during day two of the Championships. The women’s team finished in ninth place with 34 team points. For the men, Walsh broke his own school record in the heptathlon en route to a third-place finish, as the Huskies men’s team placed tenth.\n\nThe Huskies continue to battle into the spring season so stay tuned to the website for the latest on team schedules and other Husky updates.\n\nLet’s hope for warm weather and no more snow so spring sports can get the best opportunity to practice and compete. Join us for any event – home or on the road – as we would love to see you and appreciate your support of the Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nFebruary 2024\n\nThere is so much going on this February, thus the delay in providing my From the ADs Desk. A few key updates include:\n\nNCAA DII football coaching legend, Danny Hale, has gotten the call for enshrinement in the 2024 College Football Hall of Fame, as announced by the National Football Foundation and ESPN. Hale, one of the winningest coaches in all of NCAA DII, retired June 28, 2013, after spending 20 seasons as the Huskies head coach and 25 years coaching overall. Hale joins current Huskies' head coach Frank Sheptock in the College Football Hall of Fame. Sheptock was inducted in 2007 after a prolific career as a linebacker for the Huskies. Hale’s induction is set for December 10, 2024 at the 66th NFF Annual Awards Dinner at the Bellagio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.\n\nMary Raskob, Bloomsburg’s director of athletic communications and marketing, was selected for the 2024-25 NCAA Division II Athletics Directors Association Mentoring Program. The NCAA and D2 ADA Women and Minorities Mentoring Program began in 2011-12. It pairs mentees together with their own mentor, a sitting Division II athletics director. Director of Athletics, Dr. Michael McFarland, is a current and five-time mentor with the program and the First Vice President for D2 ADA.\n\nEight Huskies earned College Sport Communicators (CSC) Academic All-District honors (3.50 GPA and participated in 80% of season) between volleyball and football in December. For volleyball, Liz Bopp and Emily Jackson earned their second All-District honor this season while Jenna Dubosky earned her first. On the football team, Owen Anderson and Cobe Frycklund were repeat honorees, while Kevin Carrigan, Brady Thompson, and Kenny Yurkonis were first time honorees.\n\nThe Bloomsburg athletic department hosted National Girl and Women in Sports Day (NGWSD) on February 10 during the Huskies’ women’s basketball game.

Young athletes from several local elementary schools were in attendance to learn from the Husky student-athletes.\n\nStay tuned to the website to keep up-to-date on all the schedules and other updates on the Huskies.\n\nWe hope to see you soon on campus or at a venue near you to support the Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nJanuary 2024\n\n2024 … Yes, it is officially 2024!\n\nWinter sports are in full swing with their championships right around the corner. In the next 20-or-so-days all the student-athletes – not just swimming, track, wrestling, and basketball – will be back in Nelson preparing for the spring semester, academically and athletically. Classes for the spring semester formally begin January 22, 2024, while most spring sport contests will begin in February.\n\nIn the middle of February, the men’s and women’s Swimming Championship will be held at Keystone Aquatic Center in Carlisle, Pa.

And, the Husky wrestling team will battle in the MAC Championship March 8-9, 2024, hosted by Kent State University. We are expecting big things from the Huskies in their respective championships!\n\nThis year’s NCAA Convention will be held January 9-13, 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona with five major pieces of legislation, along with continual review of the NCAA Constitution. I thoroughly expect detailed discussion and hopeful for further clarification on the NCAA Division I Board of Directors Roadmap from Committee Recommendations to Transformation, which can guide the initial actions taken by the board and provide detail on what the future of intercollegiate athletics will look like overall, and specifically for Bloomsburg. These are ever-changing and challenging times ahead based on Transformation Committee’s recommendations, the changing Name, Image, and Likeness space, and all the movement with the Transfer Portal. This is an encouraging time of fluid movement within the NCAA.\n\nThere will be a host of learning opportunities for future Huskies to participate in Winter Camps/clinics. The baseball team will be hosting two this winter, while softball will feature several opportunities in January and February. Joining head coach Susan Kocher for these clinics will be Doug Lynn. Lynn joined the Huskies coaching start at the start of December – Welcome Aboard!\n\nA bunch of awards have been announced since my last From the ADs Desk.\n\nTwo field hockey players were named to the National Field Hockey Coaches Association All-America team, with Bella Culp and Aydan McFarland earning Second Team honors. The pair are the first NFHCA All-Americans for Bloomsburg since Tali Wehner in 2018. They join the historic list of Huskies' field hockey All-Americans that includes Head Coach Nikki Hartranft, who was a three-time NFHCA All-American from 2001-2003.\n\nIn volleyball, Liz Bopp, Emily Jackson, and Jenna Dubosky earned CSC Academic All-District selections, while football had five players earn Academic All-District accolades (Owen Anderson, Cobe Frycklund, Kevin Carrigan, Brady Thompson, and Kenny Yurkonis).\n\nIn soccer, Kody Besser continues to add to his honors while Erin Ranegan also has more hardware to add to her list.

Good luck to the Huskies with their exams and with the winter seasons … Let’s Go Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nNovember 2023\n\nOne day it is 77 degrees in Bloomsburg to end October and the next we have a frost warning and high temperatures of 50 degrees. Welcome, officially, to the change of seasons. The fall championships are upon us and the winter seasons are underway!\n\nThis is the final week for the PSAC men’s and women’s soccer schedules with the men facing either a #2 or #3 seed in the post-season, and the women’s team has secured a slot in the post-season and will learn their ranking Friday. Volleyball still has two weeks of competition ahead and are looking to secure a post-season berth.\n\nIn men’s golf, the Huskies finished the PSAC Championship in 10th place with Jake Taylor earning 31st place toping the Bloom individual players. The women’s golf team will compete in the spring for the PSAC Championship.\n\nThe men’s and women’s cross country teams excelled during the PSAC Championship and prepare for the NCAA Mid-Atlantic Regional this weekend, Nov. 4. The women’s team finished second in the conference championship and Kelley Selheimer paced the team with a 4th place finish, earning All-Conference accolades with teammates Amanda Kelly and Alyssa Cunningham. The men’s squad tallied an 8th place finish in the PSAC event, with Ryan Duff earning first-team All-Conference honors.\n\nThe Field Hockey team earned the 5th seed in the PSAC post-season and battled through to an overtime 1-0 defeat at Mansfield. It was a great showing for the squad finishing the season 14-5, which is the most wins since 2012 and the 33rd time in program history the field hockey team has won at least 14 games in a season. Congratulations to Head Coach Nicole Hartranft on being named the PSAC Coach of the Year, joined by student-athletes Bella Culp (First Team), Genna Bush (Freshman of the Year; Second Team), Aydan McFarland (Second Team), Emily Swineford (Second Team), Megan Barnard (Third Team) and Jackie Nevel (Third Team).\n\nWith the conclusion of the fall sports, we are looking forward to seeing many more Huskies listed among the All-Conference teams, which will be released in conjunction with their respective championships. Stay tuned to the website to see our Husky honorees. You can also stay up-to-date on the schedule of events.\n\nThis weekend also opens the season for the Husky Wrestling team as they visit New Jersey for the Princeton Open on Sunday, following the Maroon & Gold Dual. Be sure to check out their schedule and roster, as we open up the 2023-24 season this weekend.\n\nThis year marks the 50th Anniversary of NCAA and Division II. Bloomsburg athletics nominated Jan Hutchinson and Jahri Evans for this prestigious award. After a conference-wide vote by the Pennsylvania State Athlete Conference’s athletic directors, senior woman administrators, and sports information directors, Bloomsburg's Jan Hutchinson and Pitt-Johnstown's Pat Pecora have been selected as the conference’s representatives and finalists for the NCAA Division II 50th Anniversary Gold Award.\n\nThe Gold Award recognizes two individuals (one who identifies as male and one who identifies as female) who have made a positive impact in Division II—whether it be a current or former student-athlete, coach, faculty member, or administrator from an active member school or conference who has distinguished themselves in the areas of athletics, professional achievement, service, and leadership and who have helped shape Division II over time.\n\nThe NCAA Division II Management Council Identity Subcommittee will review each conference’s finalists and select two overall winners, who will be recognized at the 2024 NCAA Convention in Phoenix, Ariz.\n\nAs the year concludes, we cannot thank our friends, families, fans, and alumni enough for their support. Our corporate partners continue to provide much needed relief to our programs and we cannot be more thankful. If you are considering supporting the Huskies, there are multiple methods. One is through the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center in Nelson Field House that benefits all student-athletes. If you are inclined, you can support and donate to the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center it provides our student-athletes with a much needed nutritional boost following a practice or game in case there is not time for a full meal. We also encourage you to visit our corporate partners and support those businesses that support our student-athletes. Finally, we appreciate your consideration to support our Athletic Scholarship Fund, that truly provides an academic and athletic experience for student-athletes. You can visit the BU Foundation’s page to initiate your tax-deductible support of a Husky!\n\nWe hope to see you on campus cheering on the Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nOctober 2023\n\nThe Bloomsburg Fair has concluded. Fall sports have ended their non-conference schedules – with an exception here and there. And, the Huskies are challenging for the PSAC championships. Winter sports are just around the corner as well.\n\nWith October comes PSAC Championships. Bloomsburg is the host site for the tennis individual championships October 7-9, followed by the Huskies hosting the Cross Country championship October 21. The men’s golf championship will be October 19-22 at Iron Valley Golf Club in Lebanon, Pa. And, the PSAC Field Hockey championship opens on October 31 with the top six seeds qualifying. Men’s and women’s soccer and volleyball will be in November, along with football.\n\nHopefully, Bloomsburg captures a host of honors this fall. The accolades have started for the women’s golf team, where we opened the month with a program first. Junior Olivia Martinez notched the program’s first-ever hole in one during the Arcadia University Golden Oaks Shootout. Another first is the NCAA’s 50th Anniversary Celebration and Gold Awards. The Gold Award recognizes two individuals who have made a positive impact in Division II—whether it be a current or former student-athlete, coach, faculty member, or administrator from an active member school or conference who has distinguished themselves in the areas of athletics, professional achievement, service, and leadership and who have helped shape Division II over time. Bloomsburg has nominated legendary field hockey and softball coach Jan Hutchison and football hall of fame member and NFL veteran Jahri Evans for the NCAA Gold Award. Both individuals embody the virtues of Division II and are true Husky leaders.\n\nStay on top of all the Husky action by visiting our composite schedule to make sure you have the latest schedules of all the teams. Thanks to our partners with BUSN, many of the games are web streamed and can be accessed through the website.\n\nThis is the last week to register – as an early bird – for the 2023 Husky Athletics Hall of Fame. This year’s class includes Lindy (Altadonna) McKinney ’99 (Women’s Lacrosse), Amber (Hackenberg) Brosius ’08 (Women’s Track & Field/Cross Country), Bill Paule ’65 (Wrestling), Franklyn Quiteh ’13 (Football), Tracy Wirth ’00 (Women’s Soccer), and Sheila (Zilinski) Hughes ’04/’06M (Field Hockey/Lacrosse). This group marks the 41st Athletic Hall of Fame class and, with the addition of six individuals, brings the number of members enshrined to 208. Make sure to join us!\n\nDuring the Homecoming game, Bloomsburg Athletics will celebrate the 2013 PSAC Championship football team in a special ceremony in-game, along with honoring Husky great Brian Clarke and honoring his jersey. We hope you can join us for the 1pm honoring of Brian Clarke and during the game celebrating our Hall of Fame class, along with honoring the 2013 Team. Please contact me if you would like additional information.\n\nAnd, with increased games and events, we will have increased use of the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center in Nelson Field House that benefits all student-athletes. If you are inclined, you can support and donate to the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center year-round. I know our student-athletes can always use that little bit extra.\n\nAs the leaves turn and we enter fall, make sure to join us for some exciting events in Bloomsburg. We hope to see you on campus in support of the Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nAs August ends, we of course hit a heat wave to mark summer is not gone yet! Our student-athletes continue to battle through and strive for continued success. From the first practice to open the 2023 season to today, we remain committed to bringing home some hardware to celebrate the success of Bloomsburg Athletics. This is not an easy task – I know that should be no surprise, but sometimes it is. If we all had the special recipe for success that would be remarkable. What we have is Huskies who are diligently trying to get better every day – in the classroom and in their sport.\n\nWe seek your support and positivity as much as possible. As Theodore Roosevelt said, “Nothing worth having comes easy.” That is so true in sports. And, there is not one person in Nelson Field House who does not work every day to drive a winning attitude. Together, and within our teams, we will get there.\n\nOur first home contest of the 2023-24 season will be today with Field Hockey opening the Huskies home campaign, followed by the men’s and women’s tennis invitational this weekend. It is not until next week that we will have men’s and women’s soccer, and football at home as well, with our first home volleyball match on Sept. 22. The first home cross country event will be the BU Invitational on Oct. 7, followed by Bloomsburg hosting the PSAC Championship on Oct. 21. It plans to be an exciting fall.\n\nPlease visit our composite schedule to make sure you have the latest schedules of all the teams. As previously mentioned, as we plan the 2023 Football Season, pay special attention to the Homecoming Weekend and the 2023 Athletics Hall of Fame (Sunday, Oct. 15 during Homecoming weekend). Make sure you book early for the game and tailgating.\n\nSpecifically, the 2023 class includes Lindy (Altadonna) McKinney ’99 (Women’s Lacrosse), Amber (Hackenberg) Brosius ’08 (Women’s Track & Field/Cross Country), Bill Paule ’65 (Wrestling), Franklyn Quiteh ’13 (Football), Tracy Wirth ’00 (Women’s Soccer), and Sheila (Zilinski) Hughes ’04/’06M (Field Hockey/Lacrosse). This group marks the 41st Athletic Hall of Fame class and, with the addition of six individuals, brings the number of members enshrined to 208. Make sure to join us!\n\nAnother upcoming event will be Sept. 30 when the women’s soccer team will host an Alumni Day/PSAC Championship Celebration. This is in conjunction with the game against West Chester. The Huskies will honor both the 1998 and 2018 Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) teams during the day while welcoming all alumni back to campus. The celebration of the 1998 and 2018 teams is the 25th and fifth anniversary, respectively, of the Huskies PSAC Championships. We hope you can join us!\n\nAnd, with increased games and events, we will have increased use of the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center in Nelson Field House that benefits all student-athletes. If you are inclined, you can support and donate to the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center year-round. I know our student-athletes can always use that little bit extra.\n\nWhile the temperature continues to rise outside, so do the team’s competitions! We hope to see you on campus this fall in support of the Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nAugust 2023\n\nWow does time fly! As I sit in my office on the first Friday of August, I am what seems like hours away from the first football practice and the remainder of the fall team's arrivals on campus in a week. This is exciting. I have missed seeing all the student-athletes grace the hallways, study lounge, and the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center.\n\nSpeaking of the Horst Nutritional Center, please make sure to sign up for the Tyler Horst 5K Run/Walk to support the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center directly impacting the Bloom student-athletes. The event will be Sunday, August 20, at Pettit Athletic Complex beginning at 9 a.m. To register, please click here. We hope you can join us for this tremendous event. If you are unable to join us, you can always donate to support the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center.\n\nA lot is happening in Athletics. Please visit our composite schedule to make sure you have the latest schedules of all the teams. Additionally, as we plan the 2023 Football Season, pay special attention to the Homecoming Weekend and the 2023 Athletics Hall of Fame (Sunday, Oct. 15 during Homecoming weekend).

This group marks the 41st Athletic Hall of Fame class and, with the addition of six individuals, brings the number of members enshrined to 208. Make sure to join us!\n\nAnother event to put on your calendar is this year's Huddle with the Huskies. Head Football Coach Frank Sheptock returns this fall to Quaker Steak and Lube located on Columbia Mall Drive for the 2023 season series. The first one will be Thursday, September 7 at the start of the season and the final edition will be Thursday, October 12 - two days prior to the Huskies' Homecoming date against Lock Haven and the Hall of Fame celebration weekend when standout running back, Franklyn Quiteh, is inducted in the Bloomsburg athletics Hall of Fame. The Huskies will honor the 2013 team during the Homecoming game, as well as adding the late Brian Clarke's number, #77, to the list of honored jerseys at Bloomsburg. Huddle with the Huskies are open to the public with dinner beginning at 6:00 p.m. and a short program to follow. A buffet dinner will be held each night with the cost of the meal being $14 per person - including a non-alcoholic beverage. Following the dinner, Coach Sheptock will speak about the season, preview the upcoming game(s), and introduce members of the coaching staff and players from this year's roster.\n\nOur student-athletes continue to excel in the classroom with a school-record 164 honorees in the D2 ADA Academic Achievement award list. Student-athlete must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.5 or higher on a 4.0 scale to be eligible for the annual award which started in 2007-08.\n\nTwo of our Husky teams are enjoying August right now. The Women's Basketball team is participating in an international trip to Italy, while the Field Hockey team is over in Ireland. These are great opportunities for our student-athletes as they prepare for their seasons.\n\nTime to walk through the building to make sure we are ready for Husky Arrival! We hope to see you soon and please stay tuned to our website to get an update on our staff this fall.\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nJune/July 2023\n\nWelcome to the summer edition of From the ADs Desk. This column will cover the year in review and preview for June and July, with an August edition jumping in the fall seasons and academic year.\n\nComing at the end of the summer we have two exciting pre-season trips as well. The women's basketball team will be heading to Italy at the start of August, while the field hockey team will head to Ireland. Both squads have fundraised for these transformational trips where they will immerse in the culture while participating in their sports. A tremendous opportunity for the student-athletes in these programs as they launch into the 2023-24 academic and athletic year.\n\nCurrently, while those teams are preparing their plans, our tennis staff and student-athletes will return this fall to a newly resurfaced and remodeled facility. We completed a new sound system last year and will resurface all three tiers of courts this summer. Additionally, we will be adding new windscreens and repairing the viewing platform for increase opportunities of coaching and viewing. Very exciting times on the hill as we prepare for the return of the student-athletes.\n\nAs you have previously read, Stu Marvin has retired from Bloomsburg Swimming as the head coach. Additionally, Mike Gilger, from Athletic Communications has left Bloomsburg for an opportunity teaching, coaching, and serving as a high school athletic director. At the end of June, Brenda Pitonyak will be retiring from Bloomsburg Athletics as well. We wish all three of them the best with their next steps.\n\nThe John S. Devlin Golf Classic, celebrating Irma Devlin as well this year, was held at the start of June at Frosty Valley Resort and Golf Club. This was a tremendous event that draws back supporters to the BU Football program and it did not fail. Thank you to the Devlin family, and the football alumni, friends, and fans – along with our sponsors – in having a first-class event.\n\nAs we review the calendar of events for the summer and into the fall there is a lot happening in Bloomsburg Athletics. Make sure to visit our camps page for the latest happenings in athletic and educational opportunities. Our composite schedule continues to get updates with adding the fall and winter sports schedules in. And, we have finalized details on the 2023 Athletics Hall of Fame, which will be held Sunday, Oct. 15 during Homecoming weekend.\n\nThe 2023 class includes Lindy (Altadonna) McKinney '99 (Women's Lacrosse), Amber (Hackenberg) Brosius '08 (Women's Track & Field/Cross Country), Bill Paule '65 (Wrestling), Franklyn Quiteh '13 (Football), Tracy Wirth '00 (Women's Soccer), and Sheila (Zilinski) Hughes '04/'06M (Field Hockey/Lacrosse). This group marks the 41st Athletic Hall of Fame class and, with the addition of six individuals, brings the number of members enshrined to 208. Stay tuned to the website for ticket information.\n\nTickets and Tailgate passes are also now on-sale for the 2023 Huskies' Football season. Make sure to check out the schedule and reserve your spot early!\n\nA special THANK YOU to all the Husky fans, supporters, alumni, and friends who cheered us on, your time, and donated to support our Husky student-athletes. We cannot do it without you as part of our team!\n\nEnjoy the summer and I will provide more updates in August – including the balance of our staff updates.\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nMay 2023\n\nExams, Championships, and the end of another academic year!\n\nIt is Championship season … with exams next week.\n\nCongratulations to the Husky softball team that qualified for the PSAC Championship at Veteran's Park in Quakertown, May 3-7, 2023. The squad punched their championship ticket needing one win over Millersville and pulled of the two-game sweep in the regular-season finale to join the Championship field.\n\nThe baseball team needs a strong weekend in the regular season series final to qualify for the 2023 PSAC Championship to be hosted by Slippery Rock University, May 10-13, 2023. The Rock will be a busy location as the campus will also be host to the 2023 PSAC Men's and Women's Outdoor Track & Field Championships, May 11-13, 2023. Good luck to baseball and track as they prepare to qualify for each championship.\n\nThe women's golf team battled in a rain-shortened PSAC Championship and finished 7th overall during the last weekend in April. Olivia Martinez topped all Bloomsburg golfers finishing 17th overall, while Ryleigh Faust (30th), Julia Zonca (33rd), Sarah Vietmeier (35th), and Gianna Pelzer (38th) rounding out the finishing order for the Huskies. There was a 15-shot improvement between days one and two, prior to the cancellation of the championship. We look forward to the fall when the Huskies return to the course!\n\nSpeaking of golf, June 3 this year is the return of the John S. Devlin Golf Tournament – now in its 24th year. The event will again be held at Frosty Valley Country Club in Danville, Pa., and it promises to be an amazing event. Please mark your calendars and we hope you can join us for this tremendous event in honor of John, and a special honoring of Irma Devlin who passed away in January 2023, that benefits our football student-athletes.\n\nA special THANK YOU to all the Husky fans, supporters, alumni, and friends who donated during the Huskies ALL IN Day of Giving, April 13-14, 2023. Your support is immeasurable and directly benefits our student-athletes. We cannot do it with you as part of our team!\n\nWith the 2023 Commencement approaching (May 13), I would be remiss if I did not congratulate all the seniors and student-athletes, who have exhausted their eligibility. Each Husky has left their mark on Bloomsburg Athletics and know that each of you will always have a home with the Huskies. Good luck in your future endeavors, and remember \"Once A Husky … Always A Husky.\" Be sure to remember that and support those who supported you!\n\nA lot of work still remains for the Huskies to finish the year between softball, baseball, and track still competing. Most importantly, this is the last week of classes and then exams, to end strong in the classroom. Good luck Huskies!\n\nPlease be safe as we transition through the spring and we hope to see you at a Huskies contest or on-campus soon!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nApril 2023\n\nOh, how April's weather is more troubling than anything. Between the cancelations and movement of games – baseball, softball, and tennis mainly – it seems as though every day there may be a game scheduled or rescheduled, and every day we are working to adjust. The life of a spring season, I guess.\n\nThe next few weeks are my favorites though, as we are approaching the mid-way point of the season in preparation for the post-season opportunities, along with all the fall and winter sports holding practices and competing as well. Another part of this week is the thrice annual PSAC / D2 Officials Appreciation Week where we honor and thank the officials for the work they do. It is a job where you are always wrong (in one team's eyes) or always right (in the other team's view), but a necessary evil for the safety of the student-athletes and the security of the games to be played and managed properly. So, THANK YOU Officials and Umpires.\n\nAdditionally, on April 14, we have the pleasure of hosting the Bloomsburg University Athletics Advisory Board meeting. This group of alumni, supporters, and friends is very special to the Athletic Department and our decision-making, as well as to me professionally and personally. A true group of leaders that support BU Athletics in so many ways. I cannot wait to learn more from this talented group.\n\nThat same day, spring football will almost wrap up. We will host the annual Maroon and Gold Spring Football game at 6:00 p.m. on Danny Hale Field at Redman Stadium. This contest is open to the community and a great opportunity to visit campus as we will also have softball, baseball, and lacrosse at home that weekend. The Athletics Department will have information on next fall's season too with schedule cards, tailgating information, other exciting activities. We hope you can join us.\n\nAs promised, I would recap the NCAA Wrestling Championship too. For the fifth consecutive season, BU had an NCAA Qualifier – indicating one of the top 133 wrestlers in the country – with senior Josh Mason. Josh concluded his BU career at the Championships in Tulsa and leaves a great legacy. Our next goal is to continue to qualify student-athletes for the Championship and step on the All-America platform. The team crushed it again in the classroom and finished with four scholars making the 2022-23 Mid-American Conference (MAC) All-Academic Team.\n\nA big thank you to soon-to-be retired Stu Marvin on his amazing BU career. As the announcement states, it is the End of an Era as he retires from BU. The swimming program is in excellent hands though as alum and current Assistant Coach Bridget Hilferty will take the reigns as head coach. Joining the staff will be former All-American BU standout and current Millersville Women's Head Swimming Coach Eric Usbeck, effective June 3, 2023. The announcement of the new coaching staff broke on April 3, 2023.\n\nThere have been some record-setting outings and performances already this year. First, women's swimmer Rylee Wenzel earned PSAC Women's Swimming Freshman of the Year honors, joined by 12 members of her team earning All-Conference accolades. In baseball, Jared Marshman set the program record for career wins as he led the Huskies to a victory over Shepherd in late March at Danny Litwhiler Field. While in men's swimming, Patrick Agnew was named a College Sports Communicators Academic All-American, not to forget about his in-pool accolades as well. We have also featured a host of PSAC weekly award winners this spring and hope to keep those awards coming.\n\nI would also like to personally thank Steph and Allie Pettit for hosting an alumni event on March 11, 2023 in Tampa. It was great to see a lot of familiar faces at the event.\n\nTime to get out to the fields and courts for some schedule and/or rescheduled events, in support of our student-athletes. Please stay up-to-date by visiting our webpage and by reviewing our schedule on the web – whether following the Huskies at home and on the road.\n\nPlease be safe this spring and we hope to see you at a Huskies contest or on-campus soon!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nMarch 2023\n\nSpring Break! I cannot wait for Spring Break. This is an opportunity to recharge, visit with friends, and enjoy a little down time. Wait, we have 26 athletic events from March 10 through March 19, an alumni event in Tampa, Fla., hosted by Steph and Allie Pettit, and the possibility of NCAA Wrestling Championships! I cannot wait for Spring Break … This is such an exciting time and a great launch into the spring season while concluding the winter campaign.\n\nWe hope you can join us for some amazing upcoming alumni events, including the annual Huskies in Tampa event, hosted by Steph and Allie Pettit, Saturday, March 11 from 3-5pm. Other events will be held in Charlotte and Atlanta if you are able to join us to celebrate, engage, and connect.\n\nThe biggest down fall to the spring seasons is the unpredictability of the weather and the constant need to adjust baseball and softball games and tennis matches. Be sure to stay on top of the schedule by visiting our webpage and by reviewing our schedule on the web – whether following the Huskies at home and on the road.\n\nI would like to personally thank Mike Kogut (Bloomsburg High School Athletic Director and football coach) and Chuck Baker (Bloomsburg High School Building Supervisor and field hockey coach) for accommodating our teams when needed this spring. We have always had a great partnership with area high schools and it is great to have support when needed for our teams and student-athletes.\n\nRegarding our student-athletes, we have recently had multiple honorees on the College Sports Communicators (CSC) Academic All-District teams. Leading the way in men's swimming are Pat Agnew, Tucker Ball, Nick Fiddler, and Luke Scoboria, while the women's quartet of Grace Beierschmitt, Courtney Hubric, Tara Kupsky, and Anna Sugra earned the honor. In women's basketball, four ladies joined the CSC Academic All-District Team (Emma Gochnauer, Allison Hileman, Ella Kale, and Lauren Kirsch), while the men's squad featured three All-District Academic honorees (Jake Nelson, Dylan Harris, and Matt Bengel).\n\nSome championships have concluded since I last wrote From the ADs Desk. In men's swimming, the GOAT, Andy Thomas lead the Huskies men's squad to a fourth place finish overall, while capping an amazing career being named the PSAC Male Swimmer of the Meet for the second-straight season. Equally as impressive was the women's team's third-place finish that included multiple record setting times. Sophomore Rylee Wenzel capped her first-ever PSAC tournament with an all-conference and school record swim in the 100-yard freestyle. The previous record was set by Nikki Young in 2018, who just made an appearance at Nelson Field House to say hello!\n\nDuring the 2023 indoor PSAC Championships, Madison Baudille led the Huskies with a school record in the shot put, along with a host of other Huskies earning podium finishes en route to an overall 11th place finish. The Husky men's team garnered numerous podium slots while finishing 12th during the two-day championship held at Bucknell University.\n\nAs always, we welcome back any and all athletic alumni, including friends of the program too. Let us know when you are in town as we would love to see you! Time to hit the road to the MAC Wrestling Championships (which I will recap next month) to cheer on the Huskies. Hope to see you cheering on the Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nI cannot believe it is already February! The best part of this month (no, not the cold and constant threat of snow) is that all teams are working and preparing whether in-season, out-of-season, or just conditioning. My office sits above Nelson Gym and to hear and witness all the activity is one of the great elements of college athletics. Whether it is watching student-athletes run and condition, to plying their trade hitting, pitching, shooting, etc., there is nothing like the constant activity and a full gym of student-athletes working harder each day.\n\nAs our winter sports wrap-up their seasons, we are excited about the upcoming championships. The first one to hit is the swimming championship from Feb. 15-18 at Graham Aquatic Center in York, Pa. Our senior swimmers just celebrated with senior day as they prepare to challenge for medals in the PSACs. The second championship this winter will be the men's and women's indoor track and field event held at Bucknell University this year. Our teams have worked extremely hard and we are expecting solid results. The basketball championships run Feb. 27, March 1, 4-5. The women's team is on the brink of qualifying for this year's PSAC event. The final conference championship is March 3-4 with the MAC wrestling championship to be hosted by George Mason University this year. The Huskies are hoping to win some weight classes and earn qualification to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe efforts so far this year, despite the ups and downs of athletics, by our coaches, athletic trainers, staff, and student-athletes has been nothing shy of remarkable. We desire to win and have not quit in any event even if the results have not been in our favor. That is another one of the great elements of college athletics – the grit and grind by our folks as they battle every day to get better.\n\nSpeaking of getting better … Many of our teams have been signing and growing rosters daily. This year, for National Signing Day in Football, the Husky Football program added 20 new recruits which will make us better on the field and in the classroom. I am excited to welcome all the new student-athletes to the Husky program – in all sports – and to watch them grow, develop, and win some championships.\n\nWe just celebrated, as an athletic department, National Girls and Women in Sports Day, Feb. 1 – the 37th annual NGWSD event and 11th time BU has sponsored an event. This tradition celebrates female student-athletes while bringing local and national attention to the promise of girls and women in sports. A big thank you to our female student-athletes and their coaches for supporting this event and showing how you can make a difference.\n\nSpeaking of making a difference … Our Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) did just that. As I mentioned in a previous edition, BU was selected to host its second-ever Make-A-Wish Reveal. I cannot be prouder of our team and what they accomplished with the Reveal on December 1, 2022. Grab some tissues and watch the Reveal recap to relive this life-changing event.\n\nRight around the corner will be an amazing basketball celebration, focusing on the 50th Anniversary of Nelson Field House, honoring past champions, 1,000-point scorers – including our first-ever 1,000-point scorer Bill Swisher – and other accomplishments of basketball. We hope you can join us for the basketball event (one night, two games, and three celebrations) and you can register here.\n\nAdditionally, our spring schedules are up and posted so please review our schedule and check our website and follow the Huskies at home and on the road.\n\nBefore we know it, we will be hitting Spring Break! With that comes the annual Huskies in Tampa event, hosted by Steph and Allie Pettit, Saturday, March 11 from 3-5pm. Please visit the Alumni page, as there are also events in Charlotte, and Atlanta. We hope you can join us to celebrate, engage, and connect.\n\nTime to start arranging my calendar to make it to the winter championships and some alumni events. As always, Go Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nAs we reflect on 2022 and launch into 2023 there is so much to be thankful for. Where does one start?\n\nFirst, a thank you to our student-athletes who have taken part in making Bloomsburg Athletics the excellent leader it has become. This has never been more evident than now. BU was selected to host its second-ever Make-A-Wish Reveal. Led by Courtney Noll, assistant field hockey coach, and a host of other coaches and staff, the BU Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) made Harley's wish come true on December 1, 2022. To say I was honored would be an understatement and humbled would be disingenuous. I have never been more proud of our student-athletes and campus community who came together to make the 2022 Make-A-Wish Reveal nothing shy of spectacular. Be sure to visit our website to view a wrap-up video of the Reveal sometime in January.\n\nI am also thankful for our corporate partners and supporters of Bloomsburg University. We could not do what we do without your generous support of your time, your treasure, and your talent. Our Corporate Partners keep us rolling through enhanced support for our student-athletes and we ask that you support these businesses and groups that support the Huskies. A special thank you to Tim Wagner, owner of Wagner's Trophies in downtown Bloomsburg. After 38 years in business – and supporting the Huskies – Tim is retiring from Wagner's Trophies. The store will remain open with Amelia Davis (a former Huskies intern in the athletic department) taking over effective January 1, 2023. We wish Tim (and Carol) Wagner happiness with the upcoming retirement and want to thank him for supporting the Huskies for all these years. I am extremely happy to call you a colleague, a business acquittance, and most importantly a friend.\n\nWe have some exciting events upcoming with baseball, softball, basketball, and wrestling. These alumni events include the Fifth Annual Professional Engagement Night for the baseball team, the softball Virtual Networking Night, and the wrestling programs Alumni night. Registration for the Wrestling event on January 28 can be found here. The basketball celebration, also focusing on the 50th Anniversary of Nelson Field House, will celebrate past champions, 1,000-point scorers – including our first-ever 1,000-point scorer Bill Swisher – and other accomplishments of basketball. We hope you can join us for the basketball event (one night, two games, and three celebrations) and you can register here. All these events help celebrate our past, honor our present, and prepare for our future – I am so thankful for everyone's efforts.\n\nIf you cannot make it to a home winter event, please review our schedule and check our website and follow the Huskies at home and on the road. As I mentioned previously, men's and women's basketball games can be heard on WHSK, 91.1 The Husky, and streamed online through BUSN – along with other Husky events, including wrestling. Links to the broadcasts can be found on each sports' webpage or on the main web site.\n\nHappy New Year to all! Let's go Huskies … As the winter seasons hit mid-stride and we begin to launch into the spring campaigns, I am thankful to be a Husky! We appreciate all your support and hope to see you all soon.\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nDecember 2022\n\nEnd of the athletic season = check\n\nExams at the end of the academic semester = check (by Friday, Dec. 9 that is)\n\nMoving into winter sports = check\n\nThat was a whirlwind of a fall. As we look back, there have been a host of academic accolades bestowed on our deserving student-athletes. Academic awards have been named, so far, in men's soccer, women's soccer, volleyball, and football. Expect more honors to come to our student-athletes in cross country and field hockey, as well. Congratulations to those Huskies who continue to excel in their respective sport and in the classroom.\n\nAs awards are named in the coming weeks, we hope and expect to have additional Huskies honored. To date, we have had football standout Chris Monaco named to the D2CCA All-Super 1 Region second team and women's soccer leaders Nicole Varano and Lorelei Hartzfeld earned 2022 United Soccer Coaches All-Atlantic Region honors, joined by Hartzeld and Riley Spingler being named to the D2CCA All-Athletic Region squad.\n\nThe Bloomsburg women's cross country team finished ninth overall at the recent NCAA Atlantic Regional Championships in the middle of November. Kelley Selheimer paced the Huskies and finished 22nd overall to earn All-Atlantic Region honors. The men's team finished 11th overall at the NCAA regional event. Congratulations to both teams and all the student-athletes.\n\nThe Huskies were one of the 18 PSAC institutions joining college athletics to celebrate International Student-Athlete Week. During International Student-Athlete Week, Bloomsburg celebrated 16 international student-athletes with students from men's soccer, men's tennis, and women's tennis.\n\nWinter commencement is Saturday, Dec. 10 with two ceremonies being held in Haas Center for the Arts, Mitrani Hall. Congratulations to all the student-athletes who will be celebrating and graduating this weekend and good luck with the next step in your professional or academic career. Once a Husky, Always a Husky! You will always have a place to visit and we look forward to seeing you again at Pettit Athletic Complex.\n\nOn the staffing front, we would like to welcome Sarah Zbierski to the Huskies team as the Athletic Success and Student Support Coordinator. We would also like to thank Aaron Trumino who has served BU, in partnership with the Social Work department, as Student-Athlete Support Services Graduate Assistant. We expect big things from Aaron as he has truly made an impact on supporting all student-athletes.\n\nIf you cannot make it to a home winter event, please review our schedule and check our website and follow the Huskies at home and on the road. As I mentioned previously, men's and women's basketball games can be heard on WHSK, 91.1 The Husky, and streamed online through BUSN – along with other Husky events, including wrestling. Links to the broadcasts can be found on each sports' webpage or on the main web site.\n\nI sincerely hope everyone has a great Holiday season and welcomes in the New Year with hope, pride, and achievable goals. We appreciate all your support and hope to see you all soon. Go Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nNovember 2022\n\nThe fall is coming to an end. As the leaves hit the ground and the temperatures change – along with Daylight Savings Time kicking in – we wrap up fall seasons with Senior Days and Championships as we move indoors. Seems like yesterday I was referencing mid-terms and mid-season and now we are almost at the end of the Academic term and already into PSAC and NCAA playoffs.\n\nCongratulations to all the seniors who have exhausted their eligibility and will be graduating and taking the next step in their professional or academic career. The men and women from Football, Field Hockey, Men's Soccer, Women's Soccer, Volleyball, and Cross Country (Men and Women) are going to exceed in whatever they do next. Just remember, Once a Husky, Always a Husky!\n\nIn October, I was asked to be the keynote speaker at the annual Bocce Bash in Nelson Field House. It was an amazing experience to be able to join so many talented athletes and the campus community at this event. To be able to play a small part in this student-led event filled with volunteers and professionals from across campus was a tremendous honor in my 12 years at Bloomsburg!\n\nAs the outdoor focus moves indoors, we are excited about the start of the wrestling, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's swimming, and the indoor men's and women's track seasons. While many of these have been going, a few are just starting to compete outside of the daily practice grind. For a full look at the schedules, please check our website and follow the Huskies at home and on the road.\n\nThe men's and women's basketball games return to WHSK, 91.1 The Husky this winter too. Jim Doyle and Larry White return to call the men's and women's action. For wrestling and swimming, we will also stream the home events and links can be found on each sports' webpage or on the main web site.\n\nThe Championship season featured the Men's Soccer Huskies earning hosting rights as the number one seed with a win against Gannon (West, #2) before losing in the final to West #1 Mercyhurst, the Women's Soccer Huskies earned the number two seed in the East and fell to Gannon (West #1), and the men's cross country team earned a 10th place finish in the PSAC meet at Mansfield while the women's team placed eighth. There is still one week remaining in the Husky Field Hockey season with a PSAC berth on the line during senior day versus Slippery Rock, Nov. 12. Football will wrap-up the regular season at Mercyhurst and volleyball ended the season with a five-set win at Kutztown.\n\nAs I have stated for the past few From the ADs Desk columns, we are still seeking support for the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center. To address the on-going need, we have been provided a matching gift by the Tyler J. Horst Foundation to give a dollar-for-dollar match up to $5,000. If you can, please consider making a gift today to support BU athletes in memory of their Husky teammate. As mentioned, the first $5,000 will be matched by the Tyler J. Horst Foundation to double the impact of your gift.\n\nNCAA Soccer selection shows aired Monday night and the Women's Soccer team earned an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament as the No. 4 seed in the Atlantic Region. The Huskies will travel to West Chester on Thursday to take on No. 5 West Virigina State in the opening round at 1:00 pm!\n\nHope to see you all at a contest soon. Go Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nOctober 2022\n\nAnd just like that … Summer is over, the start of the fall semester is now past us and we are entering mid-terms, mid-season, and a change in the seasons with cooler temperatures and less daylight. But things are just heating up in Husky athletics!\n\nOur women's golf team, led by first-time PSAC Golfer of the Week Gianna Pelzer, was the low scorer guiding the team to its first-ever title at the Ursinus Invitational. Her round of 77 is the best of her Husky career and set the table for the Huskies as they are battling through the fall. The men's team will be competing in the Fall PSAC Championships Oct, 14-16 at the Iron Valley Golf Club in Lebanon, Pa.\n\nPrior to the golf championship, BU will host the men's and women's individual tennis championships which was moved due to weather from Oct. 1-3 to Oct. 8-10. We are excited to host this championship and look forward to seeing the growth and development of the Husky squads.\n\nThe next conference championships will be in November with Mansfield hosting the men's and women's cross country event (Nov. 5). The teams are preparing and competing well with the goals of improving on last year's finishes.\n\nWhile we have a host of non-traditional games and events – softball this coming weekend at home, women's lacrosse alumni game and contests to name a few – there are a couple of other events I want to recap as well. Recently, the Husky Elite Wrestling Club hosted its annual golf outing at Frosty Valley to an amazing turnout. The HEWC directly supports the BU wrestling program and we continue to see advancements on the mat through this partnership. Additionally, the baseball program has had three big occurrences. First, join me in welcoming assistant coach Adam Sinkoe to the program supporting Coach Mike Collins staff. Second, there was a great turnout at the alumni game – even with the threat of rain. And, third, the 2022 Baseball Golf Outing and Wall of Honor Luncheon – with the induction of Chet Henicle ('95) – was a tremendous day celebrating the past and supporting the baseball team to remain at the top of the PSAC.\n\nThis is only the tip of the iceberg with events for Husky fans. We will have our second \"Huddle with the Huskies\" gathering on Oct. 20 to review the football season. The events are open to everyone and begin at 6 p.m. at the Quaker Steak and Lube located on Columbia Mall Drive.\n\nHuddle with the Huskies kicks-off the 2022 Homecoming and Parents and Family Weekend activities that ends with the BU Athletics Hall of Fame induction. The Homecoming and Parents and Family Weekend event will be Oct. 21-22-23, 2022. For information on this year's induction class and tickets to the Oct. 23, 2022 brunch, please click here. Please purchase your tickets soon so you don't miss out on being able to celebrate with us this year's induction class.\n\nIn our ongoing partnership with University police, the Huskies will be supporting \"Faith & Blue\" and Trunk or Treat. BUPD will be participating in a national community outreach program called \"Faith & Blue Weekend,\" which hosts events around the country from October 7-9. On Saturday, Oct. 8, the BUPD will join us at Steph Pettit Stadium for the home game and Alumni welcome back. There will be \"Welky's Wieners\" in the Faculty/Staff Lot providing complimentary hot dogs, drinks with BUPD giveaways and interactions with students, student athletes, parents, and alumni. This is a great opportunity to see our BUPD in action. At the end of October, athletics will join forces with campus in the BUPD coordinated \"Trunk or Treat\" event on lower campus Oct. 27. We will have candy and wooden nickels which allow complimentary admission to non-championship events for all children who attend. Two great engagement opportunities featuring Husky student-athletes and partnering with BUPD.\n\nAs I have listed for the past few From the ADs Desk columns, we are still seeking support for the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center. To address the on-going need, we have been provided a matching gift by the Tyler J. Horst Foundation to give a dollar-for-dollar match up to $5,000. If you can, please consider Making a gift today to support BU athletes in memory of their Husky teammate. As mentioned, the first $5,000 will be matched by the Tyler J. Horst Foundation to double the impact of your gift.\n\nWith a heavy heart and a lot of sadness, I need to mention the loss of two of our important Husky alumni, with football player Moritz (Morrie) Schultz and two-sport Hall of Famer Joseph Gerst.\n\nSchultz, who passed on his 88th birthday (Sept. 12) was a 1959 graduate earning a degree in audiology. He went on to become an audiologist in Florida where he passed. As a football standout, Morrie's love of the Huskies earned him one of the Huskies Donors of the Decade honor as he created athletic scholarships in football, women's track, women's soccer, and wrestling. Gerst was a 1968 BU graduate earning a master's in education. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2000 for his football and wrestling career. We will miss both of these individuals and the impact they have had on their institution.\n\nTime to get back to it here with upcoming events and contests. Hope to see you all at a contest soon. Go Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nI love the sound of whistles – not really. But when we hear them, that usually means there is a game. That I truly do love. After a fall pre-season (as early as August 6 for many of the fall teams), we are back to playing. The road to the PSAC Championship starts now and our student-athletes, coaches, and the administration are ready to battle and support!\n\nEach fall team has begun the battle with a competition now under everyone's belt. Some teams are multiple games into their campaigns and are looking for success. Through our fans, friends, and alums supporting it will let our student-athletes compete at the highest level. Even when our teams come out to support other teams it truly bonds the athletic department and that support is monumental to earning championships. Keep up that support.\n\nWe have some new faces and some returning faces in our athletics department to support the student-athletes as well. Those closest to the action are our graduate assistants who support everything we do in athletics. Join me in welcoming the following class of GAs with their area: Maci Mazzatesta (Athletic Operations), Eric Peterson (Baseball), Natalie Holmes (Women's Soccer), Nik Verma (Men's Soccer), Vitoria Nery (Men's and Women's Tennis), Kate Lindholm (Volleyball), Oliver Whitham (Strength & Conditioning), and Nechole Hill-Perry (Track and Field). These outstanding scholars make us all better each day. Additionally, Isaiah Smiley has rounded out men's basketball head coach Chris Bess' staff, while Adam Sinkoe joins Mike Collins' baseball bench.\n\nWe hope you can join us at a game or event in athletics this year – or many of them. To open the fall, we return with \"Huddle with the Huskies\" to review the football season. There are three events this fall (Sept. 15, Oct. 20, and Nov. 3). The events are open to everyone and begin at 6 p.m. at the Quaker Steak and Lube located on Columbia Mall Drive.\n\nThe next non-game event aligns with the 2022 Homecoming and Parents and Family Weekend where BU will host the Athletics Hall of Fame induction. The Homecoming and Parents and Family Weekend event will be Oct. 21-22-23, 2022. For information on this year's induction class and tickets to the Oct. 23, 2022 brunch, please click here.\n\nThese are great ways to support our student-athletes. Another way is to help us provide nutritional sustenance for the student-athletes through the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center. To address the on-going need, we have been provided a matching gift by the Tyler J. Horst Foundation to give a dollar-for-dollar match up to $5,000. We hope that you can check it out and even if you can give a dollar, we have two. Make your gift today to support BU athletes in memory of their Husky teammate. As mentioned, the first $5,000 will be matched by the Tyler J. Horst Foundation to double the impact of your gift.\n\nNamed for Tyler Horst, the Nutritional Center will provide healthy food and beverage snack options for all Husky student-athletes to help them perform at the highest level. Tyler excelled on the field and in the classroom and aspired to serve his country as a Navy SEAL. He passed away unexpectedly in 2021. Even though Tyler was only 22 years old, he impacted the lives of everyone around him. His legacy of caring and compassion continues today with the creation of the Tyler Horst Nutritional Center. Located in Nelson Field House, the center will be available to all Husky student-athletes and provide nutritional snacks and beverages for pre and post-practice activities.\n\nPlease take the time to review our schedules which are now complete and we hope you can make it to a game near or far. Additionally, you can still join us by purchasing tickets and tailgate packages. We would love to have you join us before we sell out of spaces in the Husky Tailgate Zone.\n\nMore games around the corner. Time to get out to support the student-athletes … Let's Go Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nAugust 2022\n\nLike turning on the light switch upon entering a gymnasium, August is upon us and the start of the Fall sports campaign is starting to warm-up like the light bulbs brightening the facility. This time of year always brings anticipation and a newness unmatched throughout the year. The schedules are complete and the teams begin moving in this coming weekend. It's Go Time!\n\nAugust 25 is the first allowable and countable date of competition and the Huskies will be ready. If you haven't made plans to visit and attend a game, don't wait too long. We have an action packed fall opening on August 25 with women's soccer hosting Mercyhurst, volleyball traveling to California (Pa.) for a weekend tournament, men's soccer hosting College of Staten Island on Saturday, August 27, and field hockey opening on the road at Belmont Abbey on Sept. 1. Along with the cross country season opening on Sept. 3 at Mansfield, the Huskies kickoff the 2022 Football Schedule hosting Stonehill College on Sept. 3. Don't miss your chance to join the action by purchasing tickets and tailgate packages. We would love to have you join us before we sell out of spaces in the Husky Tailgate Zone.\n\nThis time of year, we finalize our staff and enter the year re-charged. Joining us in our Athletic Training area are two familiar faces. Dr. Kristin Funk Maguire returns to BU and former student Ryan Flanagan joins the Athletic Training team as well. Other familiar faces in new roles include women's soccer standout Natalie Holmes joining Coach Matt Haney's coaching staff, men's soccer graduate Oliver \"Olly\" Whitham joins Andrew Foran's strength and conditioning staff, tennis graduate Vitoria Nery returning to join head tennis coach Rebecca Helt's staff, and Maci Mazzatesta will serve in the role of Operations Graduate Assistant at her alma mater. In Athletic Communications and Marketing, Michael Gilger returns to the BU team, and football student-athlete Aaron Trumino will serve as the student-athlete support services graduate assistant. Other new additions include Stephen Pribble on the football staff and with men's soccer Devon Shapiro and PJ Steiner.\n\nIn the middle of July, the athletic department announced its 2021-22 seven major postseason award winners. The awards consist of the Danny Litwhiler Underclass Male Athlete of the Year, the Joanne McComb Underclass Female Athlete of the Year, the Robert B. Redman Senior Male Athlete of the Year, the Eleanor Wray Senior Female Athlete of the Year, and the Outstanding Senior Male and Female Scholar-Athletes of the Year. The winners include: Co-Outstanding Senior Female Scholar-Athlete, Kathryn Blair (Women's Cross Country/Track & Field) and Emma Saxton (Women's Basketball); Outstanding Senior Male Scholar-Athlete, Bryce Evans (Men's Soccer); Robert B. Redman Senior Male Athlete of the Year, Ben Newbert (Baseball); Eleanor Wray Senior Female Athlete of the Year, Natalie Holmes (Women's Soccer); Joanne McComb Underclass Female Athlete of the Year, Callie Sowers (Softball); Danny Litwhiler Underclass Male Athlete of the Year, Jared Marshman (Baseball). Congratulations to each of these deserving Huskies.\n\nLater this week, there will be an announcement of the 2022 Athletics Hall of Fame class. This year's event will be in conjunction with Homecoming Weekend and will feature a Sunday Brunch induction. Visit the website for additional information on this exciting weekend as we honor the past with some amazing and deserving new HOF members.\n\nAnd, as we enter into the fall, you will see a refresh of Robert B. Redman Stadium's banners. The new banners are being hung right now on the back of the home bleachers. The banners will feature new, updated pictures of current and/or former student-athletes. All outdoor sports will be represented on seven separate banners that will be imbedded between BU maroon banners that spell out \"Huskies.\" Soccer, track and field, tennis and golf will share a banner that features one woman and one male student-athlete. Baseball and softball will be represented on the same banner as will field hockey and lacrosse. There will also be banners on each side of the home bleachers that read \"Pettit Athletic Complex.\" Thank you to a gift from Steph Pettit allowing us to update the banners as we continue to highlight our pride in Husky Athletics.\n\nTime to get out to the fields … Let's Go Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nJune and July 2022\n\nWe have finally made it to June … Not officially to summer yet, as that begins June 21 … but it is the semester break with commencement concluded and camps and clinics now in full force. Fall planning is 300% underway with some great and exciting initiatives planned for the 2022-23 academic and athletic year. This is also the time where I combine my From the ADs desk column into a June/July edition, thus coming out later in the month.\n\nPlanning, planning, and more planning is on the docket for the summer. If you missed it, we just announced the 2022 Football Schedule, along with ticket information, and tailgate packages. This is a great time to arrange for the fall campaign. I encourage you to visit our composite schedule page too as the Office of Athletic Communications will continue updating and announcing each team's home and away schedule over the coming weeks.\n\nAs we prepare for the fall, we do have some special announcements that were shared recently too. First, Chris Bess has joined the Huskies as the new Head Men's Basketball Coach. We are excited to have Coach Bess and his family here in Bloomsburg. As I do yearly, in August I will provide additional staffing updates with any additional changes and with our Graduate Assistants who are instrumental in our structure and success.\n\nSecond, it is always great talking about awards and honors for our student-athletes and coaches. Former Bloomsburg University football greats Danny Hale and Jahri Evans are among the 96 athletes and 33 coaches from the divisional ranks on the 2023 ballot for potential induction into the College Football Hall of Fame as announced by the National Football Foundation (NFF) and the College Hall of Fame. We hope this is the year for these extremely deserving Husky greats.\n\nIn other award information, two more Husky baseball standouts become All-Americans. Ben Newbert was named to the Second Team by the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) and Third Team by the National College Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA), while teammate Jared Marshman, on the list as the starting pitcher, picked up his second All-American nod by being named to the ABCA/Rawlings Second Team. Marshman was also named to the NCBWA's honorable mention All-American squad.\n\nAnd, in August, we will be announcing our 2022 Athletics Hall of Fame class. These are exciting times for BU as we conclude the year and prepare for the future.\n\nDuring our planning time for the fall, we want to offer a continued thank you to everyone who donated to help establish our The Tyler Horst Nutritional Center. There are still opportunities to donate and support our student-athletes in Tyler's Honor, so if you are able, please consider making your gift today.\n\nEnjoy the summer break and with the NACDA Convention right around the corner, and the Division II Athletic Directors Association (D2ADA) meetings to conclude the month of June, it promises to be an engaging month with a host of learning and networking opportunities. On a personal note, I was just elected to serve as the 3rd Vice President for the D2ADA Board of Directors (previously, I was a board member for two years prior to being elected to 3rd Vice President). This is on the heels of a recent announcement of promotion to a Full Professor, effective with the start of the fall semester, at Bloomsburg. Exciting times for me personally as we wrap up 2021-22 and enter into 2022-23.\n\nSee you on a field soon … And, Go Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nMay 2022\n\nIt's OFFICIAL! As the headline reads, NCAA Approves Plan to Retain Full Complement of Athletic Programs at Bloomsburg … This is tremendous news for our student-athletes, coaches, prospects, alumni, and fans! And, from an academic standpoint, your student-athletes will have expanded opportunities as the curriculum is finalized.\n\nWith that hurdle passed, it is time to focus on the remaining Spring championships and begin planning for the summer and fall. We are in the process of finalizing our Summer Camp, Clinic, and ID schedule so visit our camp page and remain locked into the main website for additional information.\n\nIt is time for the PSAC Spring Championships too. The Husky Softball team qualified as the #3 seed from the East and opens play on Wednesday, May 4. The Huskies are coming off an impressive sweep of East Stroudsburg to end the regular season with a 25-16 overall record and a 10-6 mark in conference play. The tournament will be at Veterans Park in Quakertown, Pa.\n\nWomen's and men's tennis wrapped up the 2022 season earning berths into the PSAC post-season. The third ranked women's team fell to West Chester in the quarterfinals, while the men dropped a match to Edinboro in the semifinals. Senior Oliver Wiesemann was named the PSAC Champion Scholar Athlete at the men's championship. The PSAC Champion Scholar Awards are modeled after the NCAA's Elite 89 award and honor the student-athlete with the top-grade point average who is competing at the site of each of the PSAC's 23 championship finals. The selection criteria for the Champion Scholar Awards are identical to that of the NCAA Elite 89 awards, which honor the student-athlete with the top GPA at each of the championship finals sites of the 89 NCAA championships across all three divisions – I, II, and III. Congratulations to Oliver!\n\nThe men's and women's track and field programs have experienced a ton of success this spring. They will battle in the 2022 PSAC Championship at Millersville University, May 12-14, 2022.\n\nThe women's lacrosse team concluded the 2022 season with a 10-7 record and a 6-6 mark in the PSAC. The future looks bright for the Huskies!\n\nThis was the first year of the women's golf team competing in the PSAC Championship held April 22-24 at the Berkleigh Golf Club, with the Huskies finishing 7th. The team is looking to build on its first-year finish.\n\nThe 2022 PSAC Baseball Championship will be held at Slippery Rock University, May 11-14, 2022. The Huskies have a final weekend of regular-season play to determine if they will be defending their PSAC title.\n\nThis June is the return of the John S. Devlin Golf Tournament – now in its 23rd year. The event will again be held at Frost Valley Country Club in Danville, Pa., and it promises to be an amazing event. Please mark your calendars and we hope you can join us for this tremendous event in honor of John that benefits our football student-athletes.\n\nA lot of work still remains for the Huskies to finish the year. Most importantly is the last week of classes and then exams to end strong in the classroom.\n\nA big thank you to everyone who donated to help establish our The Tyler Horst Nutritional Center. There are still opportunities to donate and support our student-athletes in Tyler's Honor, so if you are able, please consider making your gift today.\n\nWith Commencement right around the corner as well (May 15), I would be remiss if I did not congratulate all the seniors and student-athletes who have exhausted their eligibility. You have left your mark on Bloomsburg Athletics and know that you always have a home with the Huskies. Good luck where your future takes you but remember \"Once A Husky … Always A Husky.\" Be sure to remember that and support those who supported you!\n\nEnjoy the May weather as we all prepare for a much needed academic and athletic break. Be well and Go Huskies!\n\nDr. Michael McFarland\n\nDirector of Athletics\n\nFrom the ADs Desk\n\nApril 2022\n\nIt is GO TIME. April is the final chance for the Huskies to win some additional conference games and catapult into the Spring Championships. For the fall sports, it is time to install new formations and styles of play while honing skills and improving fitness. The winter sports are not too far behind in being able to roll out the planning for 2022-23.\n\nWow, it is odd saying 2022-23 (I am still typing getting used to using 2022 instead of 2021). There is so much more ahead this spring to be contested on the fields, courts, and track, and more importantly in the classroom.\n\nRecently Bloomsburg Athletics celebrated and honored our Scholar-Athletes with a virtual celebration for those student-athletes who achieved a grade point average of 3.25 or higher during the past two semesters or student-athletes who have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.25. We honored a record-number of 255 student-athletes who meet that criterion from the Spring 2021 and Fall 2022 semesters. There were also 83 freshmen or transfer student-athletes who posted a 3.25 grade point average or higher in their first semester at Bloomsburg University, thus showing promise to become future scholar-athletes.\n\nPart of the unique nature of the Scholar-Athlete Celebration, we also use the platform to honor the various faculty members – identified by our student-athletes – who are influential to their academic endeavors and who have contributed to their overall academic well-being. There were 125 faculty members celebrated.\n\nIt is important to use this Scholar-Athlete honor as a time to thank all the faculty for their support and encouragement throughout the academic year, and for some student-athletes, their entire Bloomsburg University career. Bloomsburg University Athletics strives for a proper balance of academics and athletics. The NCAA and Bloomsburg University are committed to the best interests of our student-athletes. To that end, aligned with the PSAC and NCAA goals, Bloomsburg Athletics strives to provide a quality athletic experience while supporting each student-athlete's pursuit of higher education.\n\nIt is important to make an impact with student-athletes. In our structure at BU, the athletic administration and athletic trainers continue to make an impact on the academic, social, and athletic careers of the student-athletes. One element that supports this is the Department of Athletics Faculty recently applied for a Teacher-Scholar Grant, through The Teaching and Learning Enhancement Center (TALE) office, to support the growth of the members in direct support of the student-athletes. The Department was awarded the grant and will be enrolling in the Return on Inclusion Leadership Certificate program to further grow communication opportunities.\n\nAs I touched on last month, we are over half-way funded to completely finish The Tyler Horst Nutritional Center and every donation helps to get us to our goal. If you are able, please consider making your gift today to support BU athletes in memory Tyler J. Horst. Fallen Husky Tyler Horst from the BU Football Team, in conjunction with the Tyler J. Horst Foundation have developed a room and student support area that will allow his legacy to live on for eternity in Bloomsburg Athletics.\n\nAnother opportunity, that I touched on briefly in March, is the first-ever 1867 Minutes of Giving Challenge at Bloomsburg. We hope that you, our loyal Huskies Athletics fans, alumni, and donors, can make a gift to support our student-athletes from Thursday, April 7 at 8 a.m. through Friday, April 8 at 3:07 p.m. By making a gift to the areas and athletic programs that you care about the most during this time, you will be helping to provide funds our student-athletes need, while also coming together to show our Huskies that our strong community of fans and supporters has their backs and is here to help them build a championship culture.
