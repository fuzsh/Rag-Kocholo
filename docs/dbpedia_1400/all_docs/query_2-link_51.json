        "meta_description": "The gut microbiome (GM) has been implicated in a vast number of human pathologies and has become a focus of oncology research over the past 5 years. The normal gut microbiota imparts specific function in host nutrient metabolism, xenobiotic and drug metabolism, maintenance of structural integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, immunomodulation and protection against pathogens. Strong evidence is emerging to support the effects of the GM on the development of some malignancies but also on responses to cancer therapies, most notably, immune checkpoint inhibition. Tools for manipulating the GM including dietary modification, probiotics and faecal microbiota transfer (FMT) are in development. Current understandings of the many complex interrelationships between the GM, cancer, the immune system, nutrition and medication are ultimately based on a combination of short‐term clinical trials and observational studies, paired with an ever-evolving understanding of cancer biology. The next generation of personalised cancer therapies focusses on molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity, tumour evolution and immune status; it is distinctly possible that the GM will become an increasingly central focus amongst them. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with an overview of microbiome science and our current understanding of the role the GM plays in cancer.",

        "text": "The GM has been linked to the development of a number of predominantly gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary malignancies including oesophageal [24], liver [25], pancreatic [26] and, most notably, colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is the third most prevalent cancer worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, having been the second leading cause of cancer death globally in 2018 [27]. Incidence rates have been rising in individuals <50 years old and this has been linked to alcohol, smoking, obesity, diabetes and physical inactivity [27]. Of particular interest, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study in 2016 validated findings that a diet rich in processed foods, animal fats and red meat, coupled with a low intake of fibre and fruits, was an important risk factor for developing sporadic CRC [28]. Pathogenesis involves a multistep process with accumulating genetic alterations in association with morphological changes and genetic instability. Of note, distinct metagenomic and metabolomic shifts have been identified in various stages of CRC pathogenesis, including in polypoid adenomas, intramucosal carcinomas and more advanced, metastatic lesions. They found a relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum, which increased continuously from intramucosal carcinomas to more advanced stages (p < 0.005). Furthermore, Atopobium parvulum and Acintomyces ondontolyticus were significantly increased only in multiple polypoid adenomas and intramucosal carcinomas, compared to solitary lesions (p < 0.005). This large cohort study (n = 616) suggests that microbial and metabolomic changes may occur very early in the pathogenesis of CRC, which may be of clinical and diagnostic relevance [28]. Figure 2 illustrates the complex pathways putatively identified in maintaining GM homeostasis by beneficial commensal bacteria and probiotics, and the potential relationships between colorectal carcinogenesis and anti-tumour effects [29].\n\nThe GM supports a variety of mechanisms aimed to support probiotic growth and resist enteropathogenic colonisation independent of immune function, including the formation of bactericidal or bacteriostatic small molecules (bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis microcin by Escherichia coli Nissle), antimicrobial peptide induction (lugdunin from Staphylococcus lugdunensis) and, crucially, fermentation of dietary fibres into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Colonocytes use the three major SCFAs, namely, acetate, propionate and butyrate, as energy sources, while transformed CRC cells primarily undergo aerobic glycolysis. Compared to normal colonocytes, CRC cells exhibit an increased sensitivity to SCFAs, demonstrating that they likely have a vital role in cell homeostasis [30]. Manipulation of SCFA levels in the gut, through changes in the GM, has therefore emerged as a potential preventive/therapeutic strategy for CRC. Several SCFA transporters like sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter-1, monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT-1) and aquaporins have been identified as the main transmembrane transporters in intestinal cells [31]. It has recently been shown that MCT-1 promotes tumour metastasis independent of its activity as a lactate transporter [32].\n\nGut mucosal dysfunction has also been implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis by the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition and subsequent increase in gut permeability through the loss of tight-junction proteins such as zona occludins (ZO) 1 and 2, claudin-1 and occludin [33]. This may result in the translocation of bacteria and pathogenic metabolites, increasing the risk of local and systemic inflammation and subsequent carcinogenesis. In recent years, several species of bacteria have been identified to play a causal role in CRC pathogenesis by facilitating a detrimental intestinal microbial ecosystem. These species include, but are not necessarily limited to, F. nucleatum, Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly known as Streptococcus bovis type 1), enterotoxic strains of Bacterioides fragilis (produces B. fragilis toxin BFT), polyketide synthase-positive (PKS+ve) strains of E. coli (produces colibactin), E. faecalis and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which have been implicated in tumour proliferation [34], induction of pro-inflammatory states [35] and evasion of anti-tumour immunity [34]. In particular, bacteraemia and endocarditis associated with S. gallolyticus have been linked to an increased risk of CRC in observational studies. Colibactin, a genotoxic polyketide-peptide produced in the gut by PKS+ve E. coli, has been shown in murine models to induce DNA strand breaks, promote tumour formation, induce chromosomal aberrations, alter cell cycle behaviour, and increase mutation frequency rates [36, 37]. Bacterioides fragilis, on the other hand, has been linked to early neoplastic changes through the production of the metalloproteinase enterotoxin BTF, which is thought to induce cleavage of E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule, leading to an increase in paracellular permeability and activation of β-catenin resulting in increased cellular proliferation [38, 39]. Moreover, some bacteria, such as Lachnospiraceae species, Bifidobacterium animalis and Streptococcus thermophilus, are found to be depleted in CRC patients [40, 41].\n\nFusobacterium nucleatum, a well-known peridontal commensal and opportunistic pathogen, became relevant in the context of cancer as a result of sequencing-based studies of human CRC samples [42, 43], and mechanistic data from pre-clinical models that demonstrated a multitude of roles. In vitro, F. nucleatum promotes CRC cell proliferation, and in mouse models, promotes tumour growth in patient-derived CRC xenografts, modulated by the F. nucleatum adhesin, FadA, which binds to E-cadherin on the CRC cell surface and activates oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signalling, thereby promoting cell proliferation [44, 45]. Fusobacterium nucleatum can also inhibit immunosurveillance by suppressing the cytotoxic functions of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells by binding to the inhibitory immune receptor TIGIT through another adhesin, Fap2 [46]. Fusobacterium nucleatum may also play a role to facilitate resistance to chemotherapy, with a large cohort study associating an abundance of F. nucleatum with reduced overall survival (OS) [47]. Functional investigations later revealed the role of F. nucleatum in promoting chemoresistance in CRC patients by activating autophagy through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expressed on CRC cells, rendering those tumours more resistant to oxaliplatin-induced cell death, with consequent treatment failure [46].\n\nAn in-depth discussion of the GM and its complex relationship with CRC pathogenesis and potential modulation is beyond the scope of this article, but is elegantly reviewed by Fong et al. [29], while a separate article by Brennan and Garrett undertakes a critical reappraisal of Fusobacteria with a focus on F. nucleatum as a mutualist, infectious agent and oncobacterium [46]. Whilst mechanistic and supportive evidence from human and animal studies are encouraging, a recent consensus statement published by the International Cancer Microbiome Consortium in 2019 concluded that there is currently no direct evidence that the human commensal microbiome is a key determinate in the aetiopathogenesis of cancer, and data from high-quality longitudinal cohort studies are needed to confirm this role [48].\n\nThe GM and immune checkpoint inhibition\n\nTherapeutic targeting of immune checkpoints, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA4) with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), has revolutionised the treatment landscape of multiple malignancies, with several landmark randomised control trials showing significant survival benefits, resulting in changes to standard of care in specific patient subtypes [49, 50]. However, the efficacy of ICIs varies considerably between different cancer types. Several host genetic and immune factors, in addition to tumour-related biomarkers, have been elucidated to dictate response [51,52,53,54]. Nature deemed the influence of the GM on ICI in cancer to be amongst the five greatest discoveries of 2018 [55] following a number of seminal publications that we will discuss.\n\nIn 2015, two studies suggested the potential involvement of the GM in modulating the efficacy of anti-CTLA4- and anti-PD-1-based therapies [56, 57]. Vétizou et al. demonstrated that the efficacy of anti-CTLA4 antibodies in reducing sarcoma tumour growth in mice is significantly increased when the GM is enriched with B. fragilis and Burkholderia cepacia [56]. Furthermore, Sivan et al. found the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibodies in melanoma is improved in the presence of a GM enriched with Bifidobacterium spp. in murine models [57]. In addition, they demonstrated that the oral administration of Bifidobacterium spp., combined with anti-PD-L1 antibodies, specifically boosts T cell responses with augmented dendritic cell function, leading to enhanced CD8+ T cell priming and accumulation in the tumour microenvironment, inhibiting melanoma growth [57].\n\nMultiple translational studies were published in 2018, which further supported the role of the GM in modulating the response to ICIs [58,59,60]. Routy et al. found that melanoma patients treated with antibiotics, alongside anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 ICI, had a lower survival rate, and metagenomic analyses of patients’ faecal GM showed a compositional difference [58]. Anti-PD-1 responders were enriched in two phyla, Akkermansia and Alistipes. Performing faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from patients to germ-free mice, the authors found that Akkermansia muciniphila increased intra-tumoral cytotoxic T cell infiltrates, thus increasing PD-1 blockade response in mice [58]. In parallel, Gopalakrishnan et al. demonstrated, through shotgun metagenomic sequencing of faecal samples from melanoma patients, that the anti-PD-1 responders’ GM was different in composition compared to non-responders [59]. The authors observed an increase in the abundance of Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae amongst responders. Functional studies performed with FMT in germ-free mice further demonstrated how inoculating mice with the identified bacteria, along with the anti-PD-1 therapy, enhanced the anti-cancer effects and inhibited melanoma growth [59]. Matson et al. performed metagenomic characterisation of stool samples from melanoma patients treated with ICI, further corroborating the finding that the stools of responders have a different GM compared to those of non-responders [60]. They identified and proved in vivo the functional importance of Bifidobacterium longum, Enterococcus faecium and Collinsella aerofaciens in ameliorating anti-PD-L1 efficacy [60]. Gharaibeh and Jobin re-analysed the sequencing data of the three aforementioned studies [58,59,60] with the same pipeline and demonstrated that the analytical pipeline did not drive heterogeneity in microbial signals across these studies [61]. In their analysis, microbial gene content had a greater predictive power and shared signal compared to microbial composition, suggesting that microbial signals are intrinsic to each study but may be functionally related. Additional groups have performed similar studies, identifying further species associated with a potential response to ICI [62]; a number of these single small datasets were recently meta-analysed [63] to verify the partially conflicting biomarkers of response to ICI across different patient cohorts [59, 60, 62, 64,65,66]. They identified both known microbial features enriched in ICI responders, including the prevailing taxa Faecalibacterium, and additional features including an over-representation of Barnesiella intestinihominis and vitamin B metabolites. Crucially, they were able to predict ICI responders in an independent cohort (n = 27), which was also predictive of prognosis. It is clear that the role of the GM appears far more complex than previously thought, extending beyond specific species and functions present in responders and non-responders, and suggests the existence of a unique, multi-mechanistic interplay of biological factors, which may be reflected in the faecal microbiome signatures, offering the potential for therapeutic and diagnostic exploitation.\n\nTreatment-related toxicity remains a major challenge with ICI, frequently leading to delay and discontinuation of treatment [67]. Patients receiving combination anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 blockade are counselled that their risk of high-grade toxicity requiring hospital admission exceeds 50%, based on relevant studies [50]. In pre-clinical models, oral gavage of B. fragilis and B. cepacia demonstrated an amelioration of such immune-related adverse events (irAEs) [56]. In line with this observation, it has been shown in patients treated with anti-CTLA4 antibodies that irAEs are mediated by an increased abundance of Firmicutes and a decreased abundance of Bacterioides [62, 68]. Altogether, this suggests a strong association between the composition of the GM in modulating the effects of both ICI response and irAEs.\n\nHowever, many important questions remain—the most obvious of these relating to mechanisms. ICI responses likely occur at least in part because their microbiota gives patients a pre-existing immune response that is amplified by ICI, and the microbiota may potentially prime cells for an effective immune response. For example, bacterial species B. animalis, Lachnospiraceae spp. and S. thermophilus were found to be depleted in CRC patients, and are thought to exert a protective effect against CRC carcinogenesis [29, 41, 69]. However, it is uncertain whether a favourable response can be tied to a single bacterium or even a specific combination of species. Recently, Mager et al. discovered that Bifidobacterium pseudolongum produced a metabolite called inosine, which enhanced the effect of ICI in mouse models [70]. The effect of inosine was dependent on T cell expression of the adenosine A2A receptor and required co-stimulation. Moreover, Wang et al. have recently demonstrated in elegant pre-clinical studies that inosine supplementation enhances the anti-tumour efficacy of ICI and adoptive T cell transfer in solid tumours defective in metabolising inosine, demonstrating the capability of inosine to relieve tumour-imposed metabolic restrictions on T cells [71]. Metabolites such as inosine represent the functional output of the GM, and conceivably may be shown to be more exploitable than bacterial taxa in the development of microbial-based therapies.\n\nThe GM and stem cell transplantation\n\nThere is mounting evidence for the considerable effect of the human intestinal microbiome on the clinical course following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [72,73,74]. Microbial abundances in the intestinal ecosystem may be potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for preventing relapse and improving survival rates after HSCT [75]. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of the microbiota to be used as a predictor of mortality in allogeneic HSCT [75]. In addition, studies have shown that targeted modulation of the GM in HSCT patients may have potential therapeutic implications [76]. Complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remain a major cause of illness and death, limiting the broader applicability of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation; a number of pre-clinical studies have shown that commensal bacteria influence the pathophysiology of GVHD [10, 17,18,19,20]. Two different strategies with targeted modulation of the GM, pre-emptive and therapeutic, have been used for the prevention and treatment of imbalances of microbial ecosystems in patients with HSCT, succinctly summarised by Yu et al. [77] and many of these are currently being investigated in clinical trials.\n\nThe GM and other anti-cancer therapies\n\nIn the majority of patients with advanced malignancies, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. Investigations into the relationship between the GM and chemotherapy remain scarce, and the majority of available data is pre-clinical. However, there is some emerging evidence to suggest a link between the GM and chemotherapy efficacy, toxicity and failure. In either germ-free tumour-bearing mice or mice that have had their GM depleted with antibiotics, responses to oxaliplatin were found to be inefficient compared to those in which the GM was left intact [78]. Mechanistically, it has been hypothesised that commensal microbiota act by regulating TLR agonists, which promote a rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS) with subsequent tumour cell death [78]. Consistently, lung-tumour-bearing mice treated with cisplatin and GM-depleting antibiotics were shown to develop larger tumours and have poorer survival. Yet, a combination of cisplatin with probiotics such as Lactobacillus showed an improved response to therapy. The induction of pro-apoptotic genes and the enhancement of immunosurveillance may play a key role in this finding [79]. When combined with oral administration of Lactobacillus johnsonii and Enterococcus hirae, cyclophosphamide therapy led to the conversion of naive T cells to pro-inflammatory Th17, with the final effect of improving cyclophosphamide efficacy in tumour-bearing mice [80].\n\nFurthermore, the GM has been implicated in chemotherapy-induced neurological toxicities, including the development of peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment and psychological sequelae [81, 82]. The development of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CINP) is thought to be modulated by systemic translocation of bacterial metabolites across a compromised mucosal barrier to modulate the gut–immune axis, resulting in altered central pain processing, and the potentiation of CINP. Paclitaxel, in this instance, has been implicated by decreasing the abundance of favourable A. muciniphila, resulting in the impairment of mucosal barrier integrity and allowing for pathognomonic translocation of pro-inflammatory and neuromodulatory metabolites [83].\n\nThe therapeutic potential to improve patient outcomes by manipulating the GM is an exciting one. However, despite decades of research, the composition of an “ideal” GM remains unknown. While favourable and unfavourable bacteria have been identified, the complexity of the GM, coupled with our limited understanding of the vast number of complex interactions, may prove that the simple identification of microbes represents only the tip of the iceberg. There is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all GM, and the ideal GM of any particular individual may be dependent on a number of modifiable and non-modifiable factors (Fig. 1). Globally, many interventional studies are currently underway focusing on ICI in various cancers as well as other human diseases. Crucial to this is an integrated understanding of how existing oncological treatments impact microbiome-based interventions. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, which summarises the complex relationship between GM-based treatment interventions and the ongoing need for scientific innovation through proof-of-concept studies, molecular and biological research and omics analyses—with the aim of accelerating and optimising novel and existing therapeutic strategies to shape the ideal, therapeutic GM, which in turn can be validated in high-quality clinical trials.\n\nFaecal microbiota transplantation\n\nFMT is the process by which the liquidised stool (or its cryopreserved microbial contents) of a healthy donor is introduced into the colon of another individual through acid-resistant capsules, a nasogastric tube or rectally. Theoretically, faecal samples could be prepared from either anti-PD-1 responders showing a favourable GM or simply a relatively young and healthy person with a diverse GM, and then transplanted into anti-PD-1 resistant patients [98]. In Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), FMT has been used successfully to manage treatment-resistant CDI colitis [99]. Moreover, FMT has been used in the management of GVHD following allogeneic stem cell transplantation [100]. Pre-clinical murine studies have demonstrated the efficacy of FMT in reducing colorectal tumorigenesis; however, further research is required to determine whether this can be replicated in humans [101]. Recently, a Phase 1 clinical trial assessed the safety and feasibility of FMT and reinduction of anti-PD-1 ICI in 10 patients with anti-PD-1-refractory melanoma [102]. Three patients responded (two partial responses and one complete response). Of note, FMT was associated with favourable changes in immune cell infiltrates and gene expression profiles in both the gut lamina propria and the tumour microenvironment. In addition, a small number of case reports of FMT successfully treating ICI-associated colitis have been published [103, 104], representing an area of potential research interest.\n\nProbiotics, synbiotics and bacterial consortia\n\nIt is possible that beneficial immune-potentiating bacteria could be prepared as therapeutic adjuncts or even independent anti-cancer agents for administration to patients. Probiotics are live bacteria that are thought to provide health benefits and aid in GM homeostasis, while synbiotics are a combination of prebiotics and probiotics in a single formulation. Bacterial consortia are formed from the combination of two or more microbial groups to create a defined mixture with the aim of harnessing specific functions of individual microbiota, or synergistic effects of multiple microbiotas, to be administered as an intervention with therapeutic potential. Historically, some difficulties have been shown to exist in the transportation of live bacteria beyond the acidic environment of the upper GI tract, but efforts are underway to combat this. Table 1 shows a number of clinical trials underway to treat patients with various solid tumours using therapeutic microbiome material (sometimes referred to as “next-generation probiotics” (NGPs), a concept that overlaps with the emerging concept of live biotherapeutic products (LBPs)) in combination with conventional ICI. These are all early phase trials, designed to generate early data on product formulations, doses and safety. It is worth noting that while NGPs may conform to the normal definition of a probiotic, they are more likely to be delivered within the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition of an LBP. As such, the likely route to market for these LBPs/NGPs follows a path marked by studies of the pre-clinical mode of action, safety pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and Phase 1–3 trials, accompanied by the standard regulatory approval hurdles. The increasingly complicated domain of LBPs, the regulatory frameworks they face and how scientists must manage this are discussed by O’Toole et al. [105].\n\nMany patients currently take commercially -available, “conventional” probiotics, which are generally drawn from a narrow range of genera, which mainly include Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. However, the clinical evidence surrounding these conventional probiotics does not appear to confer any significant health benefits, especially amongst healthy individuals [106]. In fact, recent studies have expressed concerns that probiotic use after antibiotic administration could delay the restoration of the GM [107]. In the context of cancer, a number of human studies have suggested non-specific probiotic intake for patients receiving ICI may actually be detrimental; one small study of 46 melanoma patients presented at the American Association for Cancer Research annual conference in 2019 showed that the consumption of conventional probiotic supplements (purchased from pharmacies or online) was associated with a 70% reduced response rate to ICI [108], although this evidence has not yet been published and, therefore, should be interpreted with caution. Another study of 312 melanoma patients receiving ICI reported 42% of patients were taking probiotics and this group was found to have lower GM diversity, which was associated with inferior responses and reduced survival [109]. In addition, although such agents are generally regarded as safe, there are emerging concerns around the administration of live bacteria to immunocompromised individuals, with the potential risk of opportunistic infections, as well as the transfer of antibiotic resistance [110]. Despite this, probiotic administration in multiple trials has shown beneficial effects in ameliorating chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea and other gut-related side effects, which in part is thought to be due to the establishment of a healthy and resilient GM [111]. Furthermore, major international bodies in oncology including the MASCC/ISOO (Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral Oncology) and ESMO (European Society of Medical Oncology) now formally recommend probiotic administration with Lactobacillus spp. to prevent diarrhoea in patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for pelvic malignancies [112].\n\nSynbiotics and bacterial consortia represent emerging areas of probiotic and microbiome-based treatments. In a pre-clinical rodent model, a synbiotic cocktail upregulated gene associated with tight-junction formation and mucous production and inhibited the development of CRC [113]. Furthermore, a synbiotic preparation containing Lactobacillus casei has been shown to enhance NK cell activity in rodent models [114]. A randomised control trial, which compared synbiotic administration to placebo in polypectomised or CRC patients, demonstrated an improvement in several CRC biomarkers, such as DNA damage and cellular proliferation, in the synbiotic group including interleukin-2 and interferon-γ (t3) [115].\n\nDue to synergy and interactions such as horizontal gene transfer, cross-feeding and inter-signalling, bacterial consortia may provide a physiological advantage when compared to single organisms [116]. For example, VE800 is a collection of 11 commensal gut bacterial strains shown in pre-clinical models to be capable of robustly inducing interferon-γ-producing CD8+ T cells in the intestine [117]. An open-label clinical study (NCT04208958) is currently exploring the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of VE800 in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced malignancies (Table 1).\n\nDietary change\n\nDietary interventions have the advantage of being safe, cost-efficient, and readily accessible. A change in diet can alter the composition of the GM, with evidence showing significant microbial shifts within 5 days of commencing dietary interventions [118]. While easily modified, complexities around compliance, administration schedules and uncertainty around sustained benefits in any GM changes exist. Everything that we ingest has the potential to alter the composition of our microbiome, but we will focus on dietary fibres, prebiotics and probiotics, polyphenols, fermented foods, animal meat and sweeteners and preservatives.\n\nDietary fibres and prebiotics\n\nDietary fibres are edible carbohydrate polymers with ≥3 monomeric units resistant to endogenous digestive enzymes. Prebiotics are food components (mostly dietary fibres) or ingredients that are not digestible by the human body, but specifically or selectively nourish beneficial colonic microbes. Dietary fibre is not hydrolysed by human digestive enzymes, but acted upon by gut microbes resulting in metabolites such as SCFAs. Average dietary fibre consumption amongst healthy individuals in the United Kingdom is less than half of the recommended 30 g/day [119]. Such low fibre intakes reduce the production of SCFAs and shifts the GM metabolism to utilise less favourable nutrients [120], which may result in the production of potentially detrimental metabolites. The American Gut Project has demonstrated that people who consume ≥30 different plant species (many of which have prebiotic properties) weekly have the healthiest and most diverse microbiomes [121], regardless of whether they also ate dairy, fish or red meat. An unpublished study examined the effect of diet and amongst 46 patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICI for melanoma and demonstrated that patients reporting high-fibre diets were approximately 5 times more likely to respond to therapy when compared to those with low-fibre diets [108]. However, as with all unpublished data, such results should be approached with caution and should not be overinterpreted, at least until published—at which point methods and potential biases can be closely examined and critiqued.\n\nPolyphenols\n\nPolyphenols are compounds containing more than one phenolic hydroxyl group and make up the biggest group of phytochemicals. They are found abundantly in a wide variety of foods, such as colourful fruits, vegetables, herbs, seeds, cereals, coffee, tea, cocoa and wine [122]. Phenolic compounds and their metabolites are thought to contribute to beneficial gastrointestinal health effects by modulating gut microbial balance with the simultaneous inhibition of pathogens. Consumption of cocoa-derived polyphenols has been linked with significant increases in plasma high-density lipoprotein and significant reductions in plasma triglyceride and C-reactive protein concentrations [123]. Reductions in pathogenic Clostridium spp. have been noted after consumption of fruit, seed, wine and tea polyphenols [123].\n\nFermented foods\n\nFermented products (e.g., kefir, many yoghurt products, sauerkraut, sourdough breads, kimchi, kombucha) are made by microbial organisms and enzymatic conversions of major and minor food components and have garnered some optimism due to their potential to prevent and manage a range of disease, including cancer [124]. A meta-analysis of 61 studies with >1.9 million participants demonstrated statistical evidence supporting an association with fermented dairy food intake and an overall decrease in cancer risk [124]. Associations varied, with yoghurt consumption associated with decreased bladder cancer and CRC risk, but an increase in prostate and renal cancer risk. Other meta-analyses have shown protective effects of yoghurt consumption on breast cancer [125].\n\nSweeteners and preservatives\n\nHigh-intensity sweeteners are commonly used as low-calorie sugar alternatives. Despite being “generally recognised as safe” by regulatory agencies including the FDA, animal studies have shown that these substitutes may have negative effects on the gut microbiota [126]. Suez et al. demonstrated non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) to alter microbial metabolic pathways linked to host susceptibility to metabolic disease and showed similar NAS-induced microbiome perturbations and glucose intolerance in healthy human subjects [107]. Sucralose, aspartame and saccharin have been shown to disrupt microbiome balance and diversity in both humans and animal models [127]. Food additives, such as emulsifiers, which are ubiquitous in processed foods, have also been shown to affect the gut microbiota in animal models [128]. Mice fed relatively low concentrations of two commonly used emulsifiers showed reduced microbial diversity compared with controls. Bacteroidales and Verrucomicrobia were decreased and inflammation-promoting Proteobacteria was enriched [128].\n\nAnimal meat\n\nThe current literature supports a 15–20% increased risk of CRC with each 100 g of red meat or 50 g of processed meat consumed daily [129]. While plant protein has been observed to increase levels of intestinal SCFA levels associated with a favourable GM, counts of unfavourable bile-tolerant anaerobes such as Bacteroides, Alistipes and Bilophila have been noted to increase with animal meat consumption [118]. One study found that subjects with a high animal meat diet have reduced Roseburia and Agathobacter rectalis (formerly known as Eubacterium rectale) in their gut microbiota and a decreased proportion of butyrate in their faeces [130]. Overall, the current opinion suggests that meat-eaters in Western populations should reduce their processed meat consumption [131]."
