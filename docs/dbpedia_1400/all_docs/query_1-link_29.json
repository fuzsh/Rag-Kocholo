Early projects focused on characterizing alterations in substrate metabolism in various models of disparate insulin sensitivity at the whole body level, as well as in isolated organelle preparations (mitochondria and peroxisomes), tissue homogenates, intact tissue strips, and cell culture models. Many of these investigations involved interventions intended to augment glucose tolerance, such as exercise training and pharmacotherapy, to identify potentially important mechanisms involved in restoring metabolic control. Recently I have begun investigating such mechanisms involved in skeletal muscle substrate handling using molecular physiology techniques, like recombinant adenovirus-mediated gene delivery and RNAi-mediated gene silencing, to manipulate gene expression in cell culture (rodent and human) and animal models. The use of cell culture, rodent, and human models to characterize and explore mechanisms involved in the regulation/dysregulation of fuel metabolism has provided comprehensive and informative results which will ultimately be used to determine logical pathways to target therapeutically in order to improve metabolic outcomes in human disease.\n\nDepartment: John S.
