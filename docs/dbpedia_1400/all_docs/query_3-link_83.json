        "text": "Redman, Robert L. of Hull formerly of Quincy, November 28, 2005. Beloved husband of 60 years to Barbara E. (Wentzell) of Hull. Loving father of Kathleen M. Osborn of Rockland, Colleen A. of VA, Cheryl T. Pidgeon of Marshfield, John B. of MN, Joseph M. of Hanover, Robert L., Jr. of Plymouth, Patricia E. Bowen of Hanover and the late James M. and Daniel M. Redman. Robert was pre-deceased by 4 sisters and 6 brothers. Robert was fond of saying that he was the youngest of 11 children and that he was the 7th son of a 7th son. He is also survived by 20 grandchildren, 6 great grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. Relatives and friends are respectfully invited to attend the funeral from the Pyne Keohane Funeral Home, 21 Emerald St., HINGHAM Saturday at 10 AM. Funeral Mass in Saint Ann’s Church, Hull at 11 AM. Visiting hours Friday 4-8 PM. Burial in Hull Village Cemetery, Hull. Donations in memory of Mr. Redman may be made to the WWII Memorial Fund, Attn: GR048, PO Box 96074 Washington D.C., 20090-6074. Robert and Barbara have been married for 60 years. He was an avid Red Sox and New England Patriots fan for many years. Mr. Redman is a collector of movies from the classics right up to the present time. The family home of five bedrooms is stocked full to the equivalent of five video stores worth of movies. It was truly a passion of his. He also collected coins prior to his movies. He enjoyed the music of the World War II era, especially “Big Band”. Robert did all the grocery shopping for his family and he enjoyed his weekly chore. His family knew he was happy when he whistled and he whistled often. He had a nickname for everyone in his family. If you became acquainted with him it was’nt long before he gave you your own special nickname. “Daddo” as his children called him was always available to lend a compassionate ear to his children. He was more than a father, he was their friend and mentor. They knew they could speak to him at any time concerning any subjct and felt comfortable that he would help them make the best decision. His grandchildren called him “Poppa” and the great grandchildren called him “Great Poppa”. Robert had a special place in his heart for children, both his own family and others. Youngsters naturally gravitated towards him. Mr. Redman learned early on that it was always better to give than to receive. He supported many causes over the years and felt especially close to many of the veteran’s charities. He was also a champion of the underdog and was willing to help out anyone that needed an extra hand. Robert was a veteran of both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army and was extremely proud of his country. He was a member of the Braintree VFW as well as the Disabled American Veteran’s. Robert was proud of his family name and had it on display anywhere he could find the room. He had a great affection for Ireland, the birthplace of his parents."
