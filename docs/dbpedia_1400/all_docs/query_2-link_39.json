        "text": "IN SHORT\n\nAVMA HONORED WITH PET HERO AWARD\n\nThis past October, the AVMA was named Animal Health Organization of the Year at the Pet Hero Awards 6th Anniversary Ceremony at Gotham Hall in New York City.\n\nThe Pet Philanthropy Circle Pet Hero Awards recognize outstanding contributions to the health and welfare of animals. AVMA President John de Jong accepted the award on behalf of the association.\n\n“Providing much needed regular, affordable care to animals of all species is part of every veterinarian's DNA,” Dr. de Jong said in an AVMA press release. “The AVMA is committed to providing veterinarians with the resources needed to use their skills to save and enhance the quality of animal lives. Organizations such as the Pet Philanthropy Circle and the American Veterinary Medical Foundation's Veterinary Care Charitable Fund help us realize this goal.”\n\nOther 2018 winners included Zoetis Inc. as Corporation of the Year and the surviving family of Steve Irwin, who hosted the television show “The Crocodile Hunter,” as recipients of the inaugural Humanitarian Family of the Year Award.\n\nVBMA SEEKS OUT FORMER MEMBERS\n\nThe Veterinary Business Management Association is endeavoring to start an alumni network.\n\nThe VBMA is a veterinary student-run organization aimed at educating members on how to get hired, become a successful associate, and own or buy a practice. Students get a crash course in money matters as diverse as Roth IRAs, exchange-traded funds, and loan repayment and consolidation.\n\nThe VBMA currently has over 5,000 active members at 35 universities in the U.S. and Caribbean. The association estimates it has 10,000 alumni.\n\nFormer members, now graduated, have expressed interest in staying involved. Some are now working with the association to create a VBMA alumni association. Colleagues are encouraged to fill out a form, available at https://jav.ma/VBMAalumni. It asks for contact information along with veterinary college attended and graduation year.\n\nRicky Walther, 2019 VBMA president, said, “We are in the process of forming a committee of alumni to head this arm of our organization, and details about member benefits and the dues structure will be determined soon. The primary goal of this endeavor is to create a network of like-minded veterinarians who can share ideas and connect with people at similar stages of their careers. We also hope to find ways to connect our alumni to current students for mentorship and advice as we enter our careers.”\n\nV FOUNDATION EXPANDS FUNDING FOR CANINE CANCER STUDIES\n\nThe V Foundation announced this past October plans for a grant-making program to accelerate research in the field of canine comparative oncology. The aim is to discover faster and less costly drug therapies for dogs and humans as well as better-informed research designs for both species.\n\nIn recent years, the V Foundation has awarded more than $700,000 for canine comparative oncology studies through a collaboration between the North Carolina State College of Veterinary Medicine and Duke Cancer Institute.\n\n“This program will not only provide benefits to the millions of canine and human patients each year that get cancer, it will make the challenging process of identifying new approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment more efficient and effective,” said Michael Kastan, MD, executive director of Duke Cancer Institute, in a press release.\n\nThe V Foundation is working with advisers from several veterinary colleges and paired cancer centers to evaluate research needs and select the best grant topics.\n\nAntimicrobial sales decline on farms\n\nFDA report shows largest decline among drugs shared with human medicine\n\nBy Greg Cima\n\nIn 2017, livestock industries bought one-third less of antimicrobials in the same drug classes as those given to people.\n\nThe amount, by weight, of those drugs sold for use in livestock dropped 33 percent from 2016, a single-year difference of 6 million pounds, according to a Food and Drug Administration report published in December 2018. Sales of those drugs also dropped 14 percent from 2015 to 2016, for a two-year decline of 43 percent.\n\nRon Phillips is vice president for legislative and public affairs for the Animal Health Institute, a pharmaceutical trade organization. He said various factors affect sales and use volumes, totals of which can differ. But he said the decline in sales reflects efforts to use those drugs only where needed.\n\nLeah Wilkinson, vice president of public policy and education for the American Feed Industry Association, provided a statement saying that the reductions in drug sales likely were related to the FDA's changes regarding drug approvals in 2016 and to the public's demand for reduced use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals.\n\nIn December 2016, FDA officials removed all over-the-counter access to antimicrobials that are both used in human medicine and given to livestock in feed or water. Use of those drugs for production purposes, such as growth promotion, was also eliminated. Those drugs now can be given only with veterinarian approval for disease-related reasons.\n\nFDA officials were unavailable to talk about the report in late December and early January, when federal agencies furloughed workers as a result of the government shutdown.\n\nSALES, USE DIFFER\n\nIn December 2013, FDA officials proposed revising hundreds of approved drug applications to end what they saw as improper drug uses that contributed to drug resistance. The affected drug makers agreed under the threat of regulatory proceedings.\n\nThe changes affected drugs the agency lists as “medically important” because of their usefulness in human medicine. December's report indicates the decrease in sales of those drugs coincided with a 5 percent drop in sales of agriculture-use antimicrobials that are considered medically unimportant, especially ionophore-class drugs.\n\nFDA officials also announced in 2018 plans to require prescriptions to access the remaining medically important antimicrobials available over the counter, now about 5 percent of all such drugs, and develop recommended treatment times for those drugs for which guidance is absent.\n\nA year ago, AVMA leaders enacted a policy that says veterinarians can preserve effectiveness and availability of antimicrobial drugs through oversight of drug use and responsible decisions. The policy, “Antimicrobial Stewardship Definition and Core Principles,” states that stewardship involves disease prevention and management as well as drug use that is evidence-based, sparing, and completed with evaluating outcomes.\n\nDr. Michael Costin, assistant director of the AVMA Division of Animal and Public Health, said that, in 2019, the AVMA Committee on Antimicrobials will monitor Federal Register notices related to the FDA's strategy on antimicrobials and prepare positions and responses.\n\nDr. Michael Apley, a professor of pharmacology at Kansas State University and immediate past president of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, cautioned that many factors could contribute to declines in antimicrobial sales, among them differences in animal health and population sizes. But he also heard from cattle veterinarians that the drug approval changes had led to discussions with clients about when drugs can and should be used, and he had expected to see a decrease in tetracycline sales.\n\nTetracycline drugs have made up the bulk of medically important antimicrobials sold in agriculture since the FDA began collecting data in 2009. That remained true in 2017 despite a 40 percent drop in sales since 2016, a difference of more than 5 million pounds.\n\nDr. Apley also said the data provide no indication how changes in antimicrobial use affected animal welfare. If animals are receiving less antimicrobials, he wants to know how that is changing illness and death rates.\n\nPhillips, of AHI, said that, while the sales decrease is evidence of the impact of judicious use, efforts to improve use should continue. He expects an FDA report this year will provide some analysis of drug resistance surveillance, sales data, and use information.\n\nEFFECTS ON RESISTANCE UNKNOWN\n\nReports from the Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service show drug sales declined even though populations and production were stable across major livestock industries. From 2016–17, NASS data show slight rises in cattle inventories, milk production, milk produced per cow, beef production, swine inventories, pork production, layer hen populations, egg production, broiler chicks hatched, and chicken meat production, while the number of turkeys declined about 0.5 percent and turkey meat production was unchanged.\n\nAt the same time, the FDA data show the amounts of medically important antimicrobials sold for use in cattle and swine each dropped 35 percent, the volume sold for use in turkeys dropped 11 percent, and the amount used in chickens dropped 47 percent.\n\nConsumer Reports’ advocacy division, formerly Consumers Union, published a statement that the sales report shows that FDA oversight and market pressures are curbing misuse of critical medications. The organization called on beef and pork industries to further reduce administration and preserve drug effectiveness.\n\nJean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives for Consumer Reports, said in an interview that the sales declines in the beef and pork industries were better than expected. In the chicken industry, companies had pledged to reduce use and she was pleased the sales data bore out those promises.\n\nShe expressed hope the improvements made in the chicken industry will be replicated in the turkey, cattle, and swine industries.\n\nDr. Suzanne Dougherty, executive vice president of the American Association of Avian Pathologists, said knowing which species received a drug is difficult even without considering extralabel use.\n\nWhile drug administration likely decreased, she said the amount of reduction and its causes are difficult to attribute. The sales data likely are influenced by sales of meat from birds raised without antibiotics, removal of growth promotion-use antimicrobials, and implementation of veterinary feed directives, she said.\n\n“We are concerned about antimicrobial resistance, and we would like to see data if the reduction of antimicrobial use is improving any of the resistance,” Dr. Dougherty said.\n\nAsked whether changes in health could contribute to the difference in sales, Dr. Dougherty said poultry industries continue improving management of their birds to reduce disease, but she knew of no specific and substantial health or disease changes that would influence the antimicrobial sales. She said poultry veterinarians are cautious to use medically important antimicrobials only when necessary.\n\nDr. Harry Snelson, communications director of the American Association of Swine Veterinarians, said it's always good to see a decline in antimicrobial sales.\n\n“Certainly, as veterinarians, what we're interested in is how these products are actually used on the farm—and are there on-farm use practices that could contribute to increased antimicrobial resistance in the animal or human population?” Dr. Snelson said. “And what we want to know is how to identify those practices and alter those practices to minimize the risk of antimicrobial resistance.”\n\nThe AASV supports efforts at the USDA, for example, to examine administration practices on farms, he said.\n\nDr. Snelson shared others’ caution about extrapolating sales data. But he also said the decrease in sales reflects responses to drug stewardship policies published by AASV and other veterinary groups, as well as the restrictions mandated by the FDA.\n\n“Obviously, if there's fewer products sold, it's likely there's fewer products actually being used,” Dr. Snelson said.\n\nBut how a product is used—rather than how much is used—is connected with resistance development and animal health, he said.\n\n“Do you have adequate diagnostics in place to make the appropriate antimicrobial selections, and are those antimicrobials applied in a judicious and responsible use manner?” he said.\n\nLINCOLN MEMORIAL CELEBRATES ACCREDITED STATUS\n\nBy Malinda Larkin\n\nLincoln Memorial University College of Veterinary Medicine was granted accredited status by the AVMA Council on Education during a special meeting this past December. LMU's veterinary college was initially granted provisional accreditation status four years ago by the COE when it was established as the 30th veterinary college in the United States. The COE's decision was effective Jan. 7 and provides accredited status for up to seven years.\n\nDr. Jason Johnson, vice president and dean of the LMU veterinary college, said in a press release, “This achievement is a testament to the collaborative work of the students, faculty and staff, LMU administration and clinical partners in developing an innovative, high-quality, practical-based and student-centered program that graduates confident, career-ready veterinarians.”\n\nLMU is based in Harrogate, Tennessee, and has a hybrid distributive learning model, which provides students with hands-on experience at over 240 veterinary practices around the country. In addition, students gain clinical experience at the university's DeBusk Veterinary Teaching Center from their first semester onward. Students also have opportunities to collaborate on research projects and one-health initiatives through the Center for Animal and Human Health in Appalachia.\n\nLMU announced in 2011 that it was developing a College of Veterinary Medicine. In 2014, the veterinary college welcomed the members of its inaugural class, who graduated in May 2018.\n\nAt the COE meeting in September 2018, council members voted to continue LMU's provisional accreditation status following a comprehensive site visit in March 2018. The council then held a meeting Dec. 20 to address questions raised by LMU, according to Mark Cushing, lobbyist with the Animal Policy Group and a lawyer for the university.\n\n“There was no major issue, just a few unrelated issues or processes questioned by the council,” at the September meeting, Cushing said. LMU addressed these “quickly and decisively,” he said, leading the COE to determine the veterinary college should be granted accredited status.\n\nGains for animal health in farm bill\n\nLawmakers fund new animal health program, vaccine bank, other veterinary priorities\n\nBy R. Scott Nolen\n\nBy Malinda Larkin\n\nRecently passed federal legislation will improve national animal disease detection and response capabilities.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in late December signed into law an $867 billion farm bill that received strong bipartisan support from Congress.\n\nIn a 386–47 vote, the House of Representatives on Dec. 12 approved the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, which the Senate had passed a day earlier in an 87–13 vote. The new law authorizes funding to create a new National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program, enhances resources for the existing National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and establishes the new National Animal Vaccine and Countermeasures Bank with immediate attention on foot-and-mouth disease.\n\n“These programs will provide vital improvements to our national animal disease response capabilities and help protect the livelihoods of ranchers and farmers. This bill is great news for everyone who cares about animal agriculture,” said AVMA President John de Jong.\n\nThe five-year spending law provides $120 million in the first four years for animal health and disease preparedness initiatives. At least $20 million of that will go to the National Animal Disease Preparedness Program. Funding is also allotted for the national animal disease vaccine bank and the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.\n\nA U.S.-specific livestock vaccine bank would initially provide the United States with a supply of FMD vaccine that could be used to prevent the spread of an outbreak. The nation's current supply of FMD vaccines, shared with Mexico and Canada, is seen as inadequate by animal scientists, livestock producers, and veterinarians.\n\nThe Animal Agriculture Coalition, whose members represent much of the nation's livestock, poultry, and veterinary organizations, including the AVMA, was pleased with the federal support. “Livestock and poultry producers, working together with veterinarians, work hard to ensure the health of the animals they raise,” the coalition said in a statement.\n\n“They play a central role in feeding the nation's families, as well as providing jobs that contribute to economic stability. That's why producers and veterinarians agree that preventing the impact of devastating animal diseases must be a high priority.”\n\nThe farm bill also included the Pet and Women Safety Act, which expands existing federal protections for domestic violence victims to include their pets, service animals, and emotional support animals, and horses, and allows the establishment of a federal grant program to assist victims with these animals in finding safe shelter. Now renamed as “Protecting Animals with Shelter,” this will also provide for the coverage of veterinary costs in restitution for domestic violence cases involving abuse against pets and these other animals. Further, the law specifies the applicable criminal penalty—a prison term of up to five years, a fine, or both—for a person who commits such an offense.\n\nVital funding for USDA research programs was included in the farm bill as well, plus language emphasizing the Veterinary Services Grant Program's priority towards food animal medicine.\n\nFinally, the farm bill legalized the growing and cultivating of industrial hemp under certain conditions. The law defines industrial hemp as all parts of the marijuana plant (Cannabis sativa L.) containing no more than 0.3 percent tetrahydrocannabinol. The plant and its derivatives and extracts are now exempt from the Controlled Substances Act, meaning they are no longer considered Schedule 1 controlled substances as long as they fall under the threshold concentration for THC.\n\nLaws regulating the approval process for prospective pharmaceutical products and the criteria to conduct research on such products were not amended, however.\n\n“There are potential implications for a variety of substances that fall into this category, including CBD, but how that space develops will depend on how the (Food and Drug Administration) proceeds and chooses to regulate. The FDA has stated they will take a close look at that in the future, and we'll engage with them in that process,” said Dr. Lauren Stump, assistant director with the AVMA Government Relations Division.\n\nCOMMENTS SOUGHT ON PROPOSED SPECIALTY IN NEPHROLOGY AND UROLOGY\n\nVeterinary nephrology and urology have advanced in scope, complexity, and delivery of care, say those who regularly see animals with conditions affecting the urinary system.\n\nThese practitioners have now petitioned the AVMA American Board of Veterinary Specialties for recognition of nephrology and urology as a new specialty within the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine. In compliance with ABVS procedures, the board is seeking comment from the public and the profession regarding the proposed specialty.\n\nThe organizing committee of the proposed specialty submitted a letter of intent to the ABVS in 2017. In December 2018, the committee submitted a request to begin the period of public comment.\n\nAccording to information provided by the organizing committee, “The diagnosis and treatment of urinary disease can no longer be practiced or developed at its highest levels by veterinary internists and warrants establishment of a unique specialty within ACVIM to steward its ongoing development and provision of care.”\n\nTraining requirements for the proposed specialty include completion of a one-year, web-based core curriculum and at least three full-time-equivalent years of focused experience in nephrology and urology. Another feature of the specialty is the establishment of a virtual clinical training program to provide broad training opportunities for candidate diplomates.\n\nAll AVMA-recognized specialty organizations and specialties comply with recognition guidelines outlined in the ABVS Policies and Procedures manual, which is available at http://jav.ma/ABVSpolicies. Refer to those guidelines when developing comments regarding the proposed specialty of nephrology and urology.\n\nA link to the information about the proposed specialty can be found on the ABVS website at http://jav.ma/ABVS. Send comments regarding consideration of recognition of nephrology and urology as a veterinary specialty to ABVS@avma.org. Comments must be signed and received no later than March 12.\n\nFDA WANTS LABEL WARNINGS ABOUT ANTIPARASITIC RESISTANCE\n\nFood and Drug Administration officials want labels for anthelmintics used to deworm horses and livestock to include a warning that these drugs can select for resistant parasites.\n\nThe proposal is a response to growing resistance to those drugs among parasites. The drug labels also would state that proper dosing is important, animal owners should work with veterinarians to monitor antiparasitic resistance, and dewormers should be considered just one part of a comprehensive parasite control program.\n\nIn December 2018, agency officials announced they were asking that drug companies agree to revise in 2019 labels for over-the-counter and prescription anthelmintics given to horses, cattle, sheep, goats, swine, and poultry. They also said new anthelmintics administered to those species should include the same information.\n\n“Although antiparasitic resistance in livestock and horses does not directly affect human health in the U.S., it is a growing animal health threat in this country,” the announcement states.\n\nHelminths that survive anthelmintic treatment can pass resistance to offspring, selecting for resistant populations, the announcement states.\n\nIn a letter to veterinarians also published in December, FDA officials wrote that antiparasitic resistance in general—and resistance among nematodes in particular—threatens animal health, animal welfare, and agriculture.\n\n“In the U.S., many veterinarians and livestock producers acknowledge that antiparasitic resistance is a severe problem in small ruminants and a growing problem in horses,” the letter states. “However, awareness of antiparasitic resistance in cattle is relatively low, even while reports of antiparasitic resistance in this species are increasing.”\n\nRelying on antiparasitic drugs alone to control parasites, without also altering management practices, increases the risk that parasites soon will develop widespread resistance to all major families of broad-spectrum anthelmintics.\n\nThe FDA wants labels to say that those who are considering administering anthelmintics should assess parasite management history and perform fecal examinations or other diagnostic tests, the letter to veterinarians states. Those who administer the drugs should monitor treatment effectiveness.\n\nExtended-release macrocyclic lactones should have an additional warning that prolonged drug exposure can increase selection pressure for resistance, the letter states.\n\nZOO VETERINARIAN CLEARED OF MANATEE DEATHS\n\nOfficials at ZooTampa at Lowry Park in Tampa, Florida, have determined that the actions of a zoo veterinarian did not cause the deaths of any manatees.\n\nThe zoo announced on Dec. 10 that it had completed a review of its manatee care program, which rehabilitates wild manatees, and responded to questions raised by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service about manatee treatments. Informed by an independent panel's assessment, the zoo found that actions by lead zoo veterinarian Dr. Ray Ball did not cause the deaths of two manatees in the zoo's care.\n\nJoe Couceiro, the zoo's CEO and president, said Dr. Ball did not cause any manatees to die, nor did he amputate the flipper of an injured manatee in 2015. Dr. Ball returned to work after being on leave during the internal investigation conducted by the independent panel. Going forward, Dr. Ball will treat other animals at the zoo but not manatees.\n\n“Many of the complaints made with respect to Dr. Ball were the results of misunderstandings and misinterpretations,” Couceiro told reporters on a conference call.\n\nZooTampa is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and is one of a handful of U.S. institutions authorized by the USFWS to rescue and rehabilitate West Indian manatees, which are protected under the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The zoo's manatee program has treated more than 400 sick or injured manatees since 1991. The number of wild West Indian manatees is estimated around 13,000 animals, with more than 6,500 in the southeastern United States and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe zoo will be making changes to its Animal Welfare Committee, which conducts internal reviews, and its process for examining and following up on complaints. The committee will regularly report to zoo leadership and staff on its activities and the resolution of concerns, according to the zoo.\n\nSTUDY OF CARDIOMYOPATHY IN DOBERMANS UNDERWAY\n\nA team of veterinary cardiology specialists is undertaking a first-ever lifetime investigation of the influence of genetic mutations on dilated cardiomyopathy, a potentially fatal disease that affects nearly half of all Doberman pinschers.\n\nThe investigative team, which has spent nearly a decade studying the disease in more than a thousand Dobermans, includes Drs. Amara Estrada, professor of cardiology at the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine; Ryan Fries, assistant professor of cardiology at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine; and Nancy Morris, a specialist at Mass Veterinary Cardiology Services in Agawam, Massachusetts.\n\n“While much has been learned over this timeline, there are still many unknowns that require long-term investigation, as well as collaboration with scientists here at UF and other institutions across the country,” Dr. Estrada said in a November UF press release.\n\nAlthough dilated cardiomyopathy affects many breeds of dogs, it strikes Dobermans more than any other breed, according to researchers. The inherited disorder can cause sudden death or can eventually lead to congestive heart failure.\n\n“Important questions have arisen during these evaluations, and we have now launched a prospective clinical trial enrolling 300 Dobermans that have been screened for DCM and followed longitudinally at our respective veterinary practices, national and regional shows,” Dr. Estrada said in the release.\n\nThe Doberman Pinscher Club of America is contributing $12,250 to the study, which will cover the costs of genetic testing for participating Dobermans from cheek swab samples submitted to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Lab. Participating dogs will be followed over their lifetime, with screening tests, owner surveys, and outcomes recorded for each dog.\n\n“Although there are two known genetic mutations associated with DCM, dogs without either mutation have developed the disease, and dogs with one or both mutations might not ever develop the disease. We have multiple projects happening simultaneously that are designed to understand why some of these Doberman pinschers develop the disease and others do not,” Estrada said.\n\nAlthough genetics determine a risk for developing a disease, scientists don't really know much beyond that, according to Dr. Fries.\n\n“If you look at a population and all you know is the genetic status, you can make a statement such as 80 percent of dogs with this mutation will develop the disease,” Dr. Fries explained in the release. “But what is unique about those 20 percent? What factors influence the 80 percent? Maybe our study will shed some light on those factors in addition to providing basic information about the entire population.”\n\nInvestigators acknowledge that tracking each dog will require a full complement of collaborators. “We will call on our cardiologist colleagues around the country to help us follow these dogs, as well as provide regular screening at national shows, regional shows, and at our respective institutions,” Dr. Fries added.\n\nWINN ANNOUNCES GRANTS FOR SIX FELINE HEALTH STUDIES\n\nThe Winn Feline Foundation announced funding in December for feline health studies on the following topics: the effects of antibiotics on microbiota, the efficacy of novel gastroprotectants, a novel hepadnavirus, identification of genes that cause disease, the effects of brachycephalic conformation on cardiopulmonary health, and evaluation of commercial diets for calcium and phosphorus.\n\nIn partnership with the George Sydney and Phyllis Redman Miller Trust, Winn announced grants for the following studies:\n\n• “Metagenomic and metabolomic analysis of the short-term and long term effects of antibiotic therapy on the intestinal microbiota in growing kittens and their relation to the overall health status of these kittens,” Dr. Jan Suchodolski, Texas A&M University, and Dr. Panagiotis Xenoulis, University of Thessaly, $34,800.\n\n• “Evaluating the efficacy of novel gastroprotectants in cats,” Drs. M. Katherine Tolbert and Adesola Odunayo, University of Tennessee, $18,080.\n\n• “Estimating the significance of a novel feline hepadnavirus in hepatitis and liver cancer,” Dr. Patricia Pesavento, University of California-Davis, $34,880.\n\n• “Precision medicine genomics for cats,” Leslie Lyons, PhD, University of Missouri-Columbia, $12,648, with an additional $21,651 from Winn.\n\n• “The effects of brachycephalic conformation on cardiopulmonary health in cats,” Drs. Heidi Phillips and Hadley Gleason, University of Illinois, $31,696.\n\nWinn also announced a $9,103 grant through the Feline Kidney Disease Campaign for the study “Evaluation of commercial feline diets for calcium, phosphorous and the calcium to phosphorous ratio” by Dr. Jonathan Stockman at Colorado State University.\n\nNIOSH GIVES SAFETY GUIDE FOR FLOODED FARMS\n\nBy Greg Cima\n\nFloodwaters on and around farms can sicken people with pathogens and chemical contaminants, and they can hide physical dangers.\n\nPeople working on or near inundated farms can learn how to reduce the risks from manure, pesticides, cleaning agents, downed power lines, and barbed-wire fences, among other hazards, with guidance from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Agriculture. The document, “Interim guidance for protecting workers from livestock and poultry wastewater and sludge during and after floods,” is available as a PDF file at https://jav.ma/Floodpdf.\n\nIt describes infectious diseases associated with swine and poultry, symptoms in humans, and potential sources of harmful chemicals, as well as recommendations on immunizations, personal protective equipment, hygiene, work in confined spaces, animal handling, and carcass disposal.\n\nIn an Oct. 15 post on the NIOSH Science Blog, Capt. Lisa Delaney, associate director for Emergency Preparedness and Response, wrote that NIOSH already had guidance for storm, flood, and hurricane responses. But the September 2018 deluge from Hurricane Florence in areas with livestock production showed the need to address the unique problems when floodwaters mix with animal wastewater and sludge.\n\nFlorence brought the Carolinas 20–30 inches of rainfall and a storm surge of 9–13 feet, with catastrophic flooding, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nCDC spokeswoman Nura Sadeghpour provided a statement that said the agency has no information on how often people are injured or sickened during emergencies on farms, livestock production sites, or processing plants.\n\nNIOSH provides other guidance documents for storm, flood, and hurricane response—such as information for health care workers, animal shelter workers, and those working with hazardous materials—at https://jav.ma/NIOSHresources.\n\nNIOSH TO HELP IMPROVE DRUG SAFETY IN VETERINARY CLINICS\n\nBy Greg Cima\n\nVeterinary clinic employees have higher exposure to chemotherapy drugs than counterparts in human medicine because of not taking proper precautions.\n\nResearchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are studying the risks and developing training and guidance for veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and veterinary students. Deborah V.L. Hirst, PhD, acting deputy chief of the Engineering and Physical Hazards Branch of the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, said she hopes her project will help bridge a gap between veterinary and human medicine in use of technologies and practices that protect workers against hazardous drug exposure.\n\n“The two are very similar in some respects,” she said. “They're also very different in how they handle the drugs.”\n\nExposure to oncology drugs can have serious side effects, Dr. Hirst said. Veterinary clinic staff need to know the risks to themselves and how to protect themselves through proper controls—personal protective equipment and ventilated equipment, for example.\n\nThe project, “Bridging the gap between human and veterinary medicine: Different patients—same hazardous drugs,” has involved field studies at seven veterinary hospitals throughout the U.S. in 2018. NIOSH researchers documented the practices and equipment used to prevent exposures as well as used surface wipes to sample for drug contamination.\n\n“Our chemical branch also is developing analytical methods for some of these drugs,” Dr. Hirst said. She is also a research environmental engineer.\n\nDr. Hirst said her team already is developing a training prototype for testing with small groups of veterinarians, veterinary technicians, and veterinary students.\n\nTrudi McCleery, a health communication specialist for NIOSH, said the research is funded through September 2020, and the products of that research likely will become available after the research ends. That will include a free curriculum through which veterinarians can earn continuing education credit and view updated public resources and manuscripts.\n\n“I think we have a lot of good recommendations that are out there now, but they're not packaged in a way that's easily transferable or viewed—or accessible to the audience,” she said.\n\nDr. Hirst also described the project in December during a CDC Zoonoses and One Health Updates call, during which she said more than 500,000 people work in veterinary medicine and animal care, most of them women of reproductive age.\n\n“Of these workers who are handling—meaning manipulating or administrating—chemotherapeutics, they're exposed to hazardous drug concentrations 15 times higher than a human health care worker,” she said.\n\nCost, time, convenience, and discomfort are some of the barriers workers described to using safe practices and other exposure controls.\n\nNIOSH has guidance for veterinary safety and health at https://jav.ma/NIOSHvet.\n\nREPORT OUTLINES BARRIERS TO ACCESSING VETERINARY CARE, POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS\n\nBy Kaitlyn Mattson\n\nOne out of four pet owners experiences barriers to obtaining veterinary care, and the primary obstacle for all pet owners seeking any type of care is finances, according to a report from the Access to Veterinary Care Coalition.\n\n“The study results did two things: It confirmed our suspicions, but also, we were able to measure the frequency of some of the other reasons,” said Dr. Michael Blackwell, chair of the coalition and director of the Program for Pet Health Equity at the University of Tennessee College of Social Work. “Access to Veterinary Care: Barriers, Current Practices, and Public Policy,” was released in December 2018 and highlights several areas where pet owners face hurdles in obtaining care for their pets, including lack of transportation, no knowledge of where a veterinary facility is, and no equipment, such as crates or leashes, to move an animal. The AVCC is a group of for-profit and nonprofit veterinary service providers, animal welfare and social service professionals, and educators, working in collaboration with the UT's social work college.\n\nThe research is a part of a three-year effort financed by a $2.8 million grant from Maddie's Fund to support research about care access barriers for pet owners and development of a subsidized veterinary care system, AlignCare, designed to improve veterinary care access for underserved families.\n\nThe report includes information about attitudes toward pet insurance, animal welfare laws, public health, a model comparison of for-profit and nonprofit veterinary practices, and research on pet owners experiencing housing insecurity. It also confirmed that the majority of responding veterinary providers recognized the severity of the problem, and four out of five respondents indicated they had made efforts to reduce the problem.\n\n“This is a critical report for the future of the veterinary profession and the animals we made an oath to help,” said Dr. Laurie Peek, of the Maddie's Fund executive leadership team, in a press release. “It will truly revolutionize the status and well-being of companion animals.”\n\nThe study outlined the following five recommendations for stakeholders to consider:\n\n• Improve veterinary care delivery systems to serve all socioeconomic groups.\n\n• Provide incremental care to avoid nontreatment.\n\n• Improve availability of valid and reliable information to educate pet owners.\n\n• Develop public policies that improve access to veterinary care and pet retention.\n\n• Perform further research in other areas to understand the impact of how pets are obtained.\n\n“We are asking that stakeholders really revisit the service delivery model of veterinary medicine-most veterinary medicine provides a service (in the form of a) for-profit, small business with limited bandwidth, and while that model serves the middle class in an excellent way, it fails to meet the (needs) of the lowest-economic families,” said Dr. Blackwell. “We can't take a middle-class, for-profit business model and expect it to reach all socioeconomic groups. … This societal challenge can be addressed, but we do have to do some things differently. … We have to figure it out because these pets are not only in these families but will continue to be.”\n\nHOMEWARD BOUND\n\nCompanion animal house call veterinarians see rise in interest as owners seek convenient, stress-free, personalized care\n\nBy Kaitlyn Mattson\n\nDr. Dawn Straily walks into an apartment building in Chicago with a medical bag on her shoulder. She waves to the doorman as she steps into an elevator. “I know a lot of security guards and doormen from doing this job.”\n\nDr. Straily is a house call veterinarian who provides annual examinations, vaccinations, and support for chronic conditions, among other services, to dogs and cats.\n\nHouse call veterinary practice may not be new to the profession but has been almost exclusively confined to equine and large animal practice. Today, more small animal veterinarians have seen the benefit of providing at-home care, especially as pet owners seek a stress-free environment for their animals, younger pet owners push for personalized, convenient care, and the growing population of older pet owners explores care alternatives because of mobility issues.\n\n“I started it really not knowing what I was getting into; I just thought it would be fun,” said Dr. Straily. “It's sort of a weird thing when you do house calls. People don't quite know how to treat you. Are you their veterinarian or their guest? … It's a vulnerable thing to let someone into your house, and so it tends to be a different dynamic.”\n\nDr. Straily finds that people who seek out home care services are proactive about their pet's health. But when she started out, clients were hard to find.\n\n“I didn't know how to market to them, because most people find their veterinarian (based on location) and I didn't have a location,” said Dr. Straily.\n\nInterest in her practice has increased over the years, Dr. Straily said. She points to a few keys to that success: A virtual office location so that her practice is searchable online, the millennial desire for concierge services, and word-of-mouth marketing. Dr. Straily estimates she has about 1,000 clients.\n\nA friend recommended Dr. Straily to Andrew and Megan Lapish. Remy, their 5-month-old Bulldog, has seen Dr. Straily since he was 8 weeks old.\n\n“(She) has seen Remy grow up,” said Megan Lapish. “Remy knows them (Dr. Straily and her assistant, Daisy Miranda) and he's not scared of them,” adding that they feel Remy receives care that is more comfortable and convenient because it is in their home.\n\nA GROWING NICHE\n\nHome-based care potentially benefits cats the most in addition to animals that have had traumatic veterinary experiences and multi-pet households, according to house call veterinarians.\n\n“We find that in a home setting we are able to help a lot of pets that a regular clinic normally can't because we are in a more stress-free situation,” said Dr. Jess Trimble, head of health at Fuzzy Pet Health, which provides in-home veterinary services in San Francisco and New York City. “We (try to) remove the stressors, the smell and the sounds of a veterinary clinic. We don't wear a white coat … we try to wear normal clothing as much as possible, and we find that really helps the pet think that we are just their owner's friends over for a play date.”\n\nIn addition to its house call veterinarians, Fuzzy provides telemedicine services. Since 2016, the company has provided services to about 10,000 people's pets virtually and in-home. Fuzzy plans to expand to other cities depending on demand.\n\nAccording to Ali Shahid, co-founder and COO at Vetted Petcare, the veterinary industry could see a surge in spending if more cats receive care through innovative strategies such as house calls.\n\nHe estimates that annual spending on veterinary care could be around $20-$24 billion if more cats received care, compared with the $17.07 billion spent on veterinary care in 2017, according to statistics gathered by the American Pet Products Association.\n\n“I like to think of it as we are capturing those lost patients. … All those pets that otherwise wouldn't be making it into the clinic,” said Dr. Sabrina Meldrum, a Vetted Petcare veterinarian based in Los Angeles.\n\nVetted is a startup offering in-home veterinary care in five cities. The company employs over 30 veterinarians and more than 30 veterinary technicians.\n\nThe popularity of in-home veterinary practice could be seeing a rise also because it naturally allows for transparency within the care process, according to Dr. Trimble.\n\n“We have a lot of people that say: ‘When I go to the regular veterinarian to have my dog's nails trimmed or his blood drawn, they take him to the back—the elusive back. What is that? What happens back there?'” she said.\n\nFor the millennial generation, pets are more like children than animals. And so, upcoming generations are expecting a more in-depth experience.\n\nHowever, younger pet owners are not the only population benefiting from on-demand concierge services, said Dr. Trimble.\n\n“We (also) appeal to an older generation that has pets but has mobility difficulties and to people that don't own a car. Getting your dog into a Lyft or an Uber can be a complete disaster sometimes.”\n\nIS THE PRICE RIGHT?\n\nVeterinary clinics, hospitals, and veterinarians who perform house calls charge, on average, $138 per visit for routine or preventive care for dogs and $109 for cats, according to the 2017–18 edition of the U.S. Pet Ownership & Demographics Sourcebook published by the AVMA.\n\nWhen Dr. Straily gets an initial client call, people are expecting the service to be much more expensive. However, the price for an appointment is at the discretion of the veterinarian or company, some of which include a convenience fee in the bill.\n\n“The price should be appropriate,” said Dr. John de Jong, AVMA president and a companion animal veterinarian who also does house calls. “(House call veterinarians should) charge more than they would for a brick-and-mortar hospital.”\n\nSome startups in the space, including FetchMyVet and Fuzzy, offer a subscription plan.\n\nFetchMyVet, a Florida-based in-home veterinary service provider, has plans based on monthly payments for clients.\n\nFuzzy uses a membership payment model that covers vaccines, preventive care, and access to a veterinarian and has found that pet owners with fixed incomes appreciate a plan that allows for monthly payments.\n\n“We have been able to help a lot of people that couldn't afford a basic level of care for their pets before,” said Dr. Trimble.\n\nNECESSARY VETERINARY SKILLS\n\nThe upfront costs to start a house call practice are less than those associated with starting a clinic, potentially giving veterinarians an opportunity to become owners earlier in their career.\n\n“(House calls) are a good way for veterinarians to make a decent income without massive overhead,” said Dr. de Jong.\n\nOn the other hand, although appointment fees may be similar to the prices charged by clinics, house call veterinarians see fewer patients in a day—typically between six and eight.\n\n“Financially, it is cheaper, but it's harder to recoup the money because you have (fewer) appointments,” said Dr. Straily.\n\nHouse call appointments also tend to last longer. Appointments within a clinic may take about 25 minutes, but a house call appointment can be around 30 minutes to an hour.\n\n“Seeing a pet in its home environment is incredibly useful in managing disease and maintaining wellness. You might notice environmental factors that could influence the pet's health,” said Dr. Carin A. Smith, president of Smith Veterinary Consulting and author of several books including “House Call: The House Call Veterinarian's Manual.”\n\nIndividuals interested in house call work should have some clinical experience, according to working house call veterinarians.\n\nThe ideal candidate would have solid clinical skills, be comfortable handling different animal personalities, and have a sense of adventure, said Dr. Jeremy Gransky, partner and consultant at MVS Pet Care, a house call veterinary practice. Dr. Gransky also owns a veterinary house call practice in suburban Boston.\n\n“Every day is different, and you really never know what you are walking into. I love that aspect of it. After working in a windowless exam room for so many years, I really love being out on the road,” he said. But “there is some physicality to this style of practice that may be more rigorous than a hospital setting. The environment is a little less controlled—think about someone's whole house versus an exam room.”\n\nMVS Pet Care operates on a franchise model in 31 territories across several states. The company has plans to go nationwide.\n\nThere are also outside factors and challenges to consider when taking on this kind of work, such as managing time properly between appointments, handling unexpected weather conditions, dealing with traffic, finding parking, and figuring out where to go to the bathroom.\n\nOne of the bigger challenges, said Dr. Straily, is navigating people's homes. “People have varying degrees of clutter, furniture, and space. So that's hard sometimes,” she said.\n\nTHE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND THE CARE\n\nSome startups have brought their technology into the house call sector, including software for back-office duties and mobile apps.\n\n“We took the medical expertise of our veterinarians and our expertise in building software and technology,” said Ali Shahid of Vetted Petcare. “We have a lot of software that we built to ensure that our veterinarians are safe, and we know where they are at any given point in time. We built our own medical records software because we didn't like (what was) available in the market, so ours was built by us and it works really well for a house call practice.”\n\nVetted also uses a call center with emergency veterinarians who can triage animals and instruct owners on whether they should take their pet to an emergency clinic.\n\nWhile the business models behind these companies vary, MVS Petcare is possibly the only veterinary house call company working on a franchise model.\n\nThe franchise fee per territory, which includes about 200,000 households, is $25,000, plus $15,000-$20,000 in startup costs, and a weekly royalty fee of 9 percent, said CEO of MVS Pet Care, Todd Giatrellis.\n\nHe adds that with this setup, veterinarians have the ability to be their own boss and just have to work a minimum of 20 hours per week. “We want to make it so veterinarians (have) a great quality of life, much less stress,” Giatrellis said.\n\nMVS Pet Care handles all the phone calls, scheduling, and marketing for the franchisees.\n\nBRICK-AND-MORTAR IS STILL ALIVE AND WELL\n\nHouse call veterinarians may be able to handle a lot inside a home, but some things just can't be done on a kitchen table, said Tarek El Gammel, president of FetchMyVet.\n\nAnd, in fact, many house call veterinarians partner with clinics to use their space or to send clients to in case such services are required, such as surgeries, X-rays, and specialty cases.\n\n“We work hand in hand with brick-and-mortar practices. I have been doing house calls exclusively for almost 14 years, and there really is a nice back and forth there. I think as there becomes more of an awareness that house call practice is an option, it will continue to build, but it is never going to replace a brick-and-mortar hospital entirely,” said Gransky.\n\nADVICE FOR STARTING A HOUSE CALL PRACTICE\n\nDr. John de Jong, AVMA president and past president of the American Association of Housecall Veterinarians, has the following advice for veterinarians considering starting their own house call practice:\n\n• Start small; don't buy too much equipment, just what's needed.\n\n• Build a relationship with a brick-and-mortar practice that can be used for procedures that can't be done at home.\n\n• Get the word out to local media and use social media to market your services.\n\n• Keep track of mileage and vehicle expenses, which can be written off as business expenses on your taxes.\n\n• Think about offering in-home euthanasia.\n\n• Find a place to dispose of sharps appropriately.\n\n• Train the owner, if there isn't a veterinary technician, to restrain the animal, if necessary for things such as blood sample collection. Make sure that proper animal restraint methods are used.\n\nPeople\n\n2018 ELECTED AAAS FELLOWS INCLUDE VETERINARY FACULTY\n\nSeven faculty at U.S. veterinary colleges are among 417 fellows chosen this past year by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which is the world's largest scientific society.
