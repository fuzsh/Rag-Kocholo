Therefore, professors carefully select grading practices and communicate those grading practices to students to ensure fair treatment of all students. But what happens when those practices are unfair in ways that are hidden from both professors and students? I compare two numerical scales: the 4-point scale (where each integer 0-4 corresponds to a letter grade) and the percent scale (where letter grades A through D are uniformly distributed in the top 40% of the scale). I share data collected from over 15,000 students enrolled in an introductory college physics course that clearly indicate that students graded using the percent scale are significantly more likely to fail, that students from underrepresented minority groups are disproportionally impacted by this phenomenon, and that this effect is consistent across all instructors in this study. I also briefly discuss alternative grading and assessment practices, and how they are implemented at San Jose State University.\n\nStudent Research Panel: nEXO\n\nNovember 30, 2021 | 4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. | YouTube\n\nShannon Hoang, Jiries Kaileh, Madelaine McSwain, & Brendan Murtagh | Skyline College Students\n\nEarlier this year, Skyline College‚Äôs physics department, led by Prof Emilie Hein and Prof Kolo Wamba, formally became a part of an international nuclear physics experiment called nEXO and was awarded a grant by the US Department of Energy‚Äôs Office of Science to participate in this research.

As drones fly they need to dodge buildings, trees, and even people to avoid smashing themselves to pieces. Working with Professor Schwager he explored how to help drones ‚Äòsee‚Äô and ‚Äòthink‚Äô to avoid collisions. He worked to help develop software that helps drones navigate safely using Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO). It sounds like a simple task, but the issue is that racing drone's design follows a very bare-bones philosophy - they are designed to be ultra light-weight and fast. He had to find a way to extract data from the drone, and his day-to-day tasks varied throughout the project. The first day, alone, consisted of trouble-shooting and diagnosing issues to get the quad-rotor off the ground, installing new rotors that would produce enough thrust to lift the drone and the camera, and designing and 3D printing a custom frame to hold the camera steady. Finding the VIO package was the easy part, but getting it to work was the biggest challenge, which required learning about Linux, a ROS (Robotic Operating System), C++, and Python. After two weeks of dead-ends and failures, including a hard-drive failure, he finally succeeded, and was able to compile a ‚ÄòROS Bag‚Äô using a test set of data, to help the drone understand what it was ‚Äòseeing.' During his time in the AACREs program, Ned found that research is like a black box ‚Äì until you explore the data, you don‚Äôt know what you are going to learn. Come join us for an insightful reflection on Ned's summer research experience and how he was able to apply and join the AACRE program!\n\nPanel Discussion: Data Science at CSU East Bay\n\nOctober 19, 2021 | 4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. | YouTube\n\nPanelists: Jessica Brungard & Bradley Silva\n\nScience in Action continues our exploration of the emerging field of Data Science.

He is a second-generation Palestinian-American who was born and raised in San Francisco with a long-held ambition to find a meaningful career with which to have a positive impact on the world. By the end of high school, he decided that that path would be science, specifically chemistry. While attending Skyline College, with the encouragement of his professors, he was able to participate in summer programs that would foster his interest in nuclear chemistry. This further inspired him to transfer to UC Berkeley, which has had historically strong ties to nuclear science, and where he earned his BS degree in Chemistry. He is currently working on studying ùõΩ-decay properties of isotopes important for astrophysics research in order to inform models that help describe how elements are made in astrophysical events such as neutron star mergers. An important factor as to why he decided to get his PH.D. and become a career scientist was the lack of role models in his community and a desire to change the narrative of who Palestinians are and can be.\n\nPanel Discussion: Data Science at UC Berkeley\n\nSeptember 28, 2021 | 4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. | YouTube\n\nPanelists: Elda Pere, Rosey Stone, and Ellen Zheng\n\nExperiences in a Virtual Summer Research Internship\n\nSeptember 14, 2021 | 4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. | YouTube\n\nCarissa Avina-Beltran, Hollywood Banayad, & Aidan Morson | Students at San Francisco State University\n\nGet a chance to hear a first-hand perspective on what it is like to do a summer research internship virtually. Join us for Science In Action to hear from three San Francisco State University (SFSU) students who participated in a virtual research internship during the summer of 2021!\n\nCarissa Avina-Beltran is a rising senior majoring in Physics with a concentration in Astrophysics at San Francisco State. After transferring from Santa Monica College, she had the opportunity to assist in cube satellite integration and prep at USC's Space Engineering Research Center. This, along with a summer at the Center for Astrophysics characterizing exoplanets, fueled her interest in the spectrograph installation she is currently working on through the Exoplanets group at SFSU. Carissa will share her research from studying TYC 8830 410 1, a ~600 million-year-old solar-mass star surrounded by inner planetary system dust. This dust lies along our line of sight and blocks out significant portions of the star's light. The research focuses on assessing the origin and evolution of the dust by analyzing multi-band monitoring obtained from the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescopes.\n\nHollywood Banayad is a rising senior at SFSU majoring in physics. He transferred from Skyline College in 2020 and earned an AS-T in Physics & Mathematics. He plans on applying to graduate school at the end of the year and eventually earn a PhD in Biophysics. Hollywood's research focused on utilizing MATLAB Interface to communicate with Hardware (Lock-in Amplifier) Techniques, such as lock-in amplifier (LIA), which are commonly found in engineering and physics research labs. MATLAB interfacing is useful to communicate with various instruments and data acquisition, thereby data analysis as well. There are normally three main types of devices we aim to communicate within the lab: having only input, only output, and both input & output. His research goal is to build a MATLAB library with codes to communicate with LIA in terms of sending read, write, and status query commands.\n\nAidan Morson is involved in two research groups, one at San Francisco State and one at the University of Washington. At San Francisco State he does computational work with photonic crystals and quasicrystals studying bandgap geometry. The second group is with the University of Washington doing computational work with the international collaboration working on the HERA telescope. HERA is a radio interferometer trying to look at the Epoch of Reionization by observing the 21cm line produced by Hydrogen. His future research interests lie in high energy physics, specifically neutrinos and their role in explaining the early universe.\n\nIdentifying Ways to Support Students in STEM\n\nSeptember 7, 2021 | 4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. |\n\nJing Folsom & Emilie Hein | Skyline College Professors\n\nThe STEM Division at Skyline College is applying for a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant titled ‚ÄúNSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Program (S-STEM)‚Äù.\n\nThe main goal of this grant is to support our students to pursue successful careers in promising STEM fields.

Budding yeast divide asymmetrically, as their name implies, through budding where the daughter cell begins to grow from the periphery of the mother and its contents are inherited through a small opening called the bud neck. The movement of organelles through this bud neck requires the cell to set up cytoskeletal elements to the bud site for transporting cargo and is a well researched field. Given this necessity for a transport architecture, I am interested to see how the initial positions of the organelles before budding vary so as to not disturb this network. In particular I am studying the nucleus' position using the cell center and bud site as landmarks to establish a frame of reference. I use focus stack fluorescence microscopy to obtain images of our fluorescently labeled yeast and I write image processing pipelines to annotate, analyze, and visualize organelle position in 3D space.\n\nI originally graduated from College of San Mateo as a Computer Science major and transferred to UCSC as a Computer Engineer with emphasis on Robotics but ended up coming back to Skyline to change paths into Biology and transferred to SFSU where I will be completing my BS in Cell/Molecular Biology. I have worked at Skyline as a tutor at the MESA center as well as an IT Student Technician and Media Services Student Technician. I'm an athlete who loves bouldering, swimming, and running as well as other activities. When I'm indoors I love to play video games with friends, read books, watch anime, or just learn new skills. I might be addicted to Vietnamese food.\n\nBioinformatics and Sequence Company\n\nMarch 17, 2020 | 4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. | YouTube\n\nCory Padilla\n\nAchieving the Impossible\n\nMarch 10, 2020 | 4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m.\n\nIrene Yim and Susan Wu | R&D Culinary Supervisor and Stability Technician, Impossible Foods\n\nIrene Yim is currently the R&D Culinary Supervisor at Impossible Foods, Inc.
