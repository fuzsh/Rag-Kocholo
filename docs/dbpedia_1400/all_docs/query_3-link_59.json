        "text": "On your calendar for 1961 be sure to put a red circle around the dates of June 9, 10, and 11. And do it now.\n\nThe 55th Reunion Committee, consisting of Francis Childs, chairman, Walter Powers,Norman Russell, Arthur Chapin and your secretary held a meeting in Boston the night before the Harvard game and decided unanimously to hold the reunion in Hanover at Commencement time, June 9, 10, and 11.\n\nDetails of the program will be sent to the members in due time but the committee hopes that everyone will make plans to attend. We especially want all of our loyal class widows to be with us and a special invitation will be sent to them.\n\nAt the pre-Harvard dinner, held at the Algonquin Club in Boston on Friday, October 21, the following members were present, Chapin, Childs, Cooke, Cromwell and his son-in-law, Dr. Hills, Denison, Powers, Redman, Russell, and his son Robert, and Whittemore. We were also honored to have with us Roger Brown and Halsey Loder of the ancient class of 1905.\n\nWe were sorry so many of the faithful couldn't make it for it was a very interesting and enjoyable evening. Walter Powers presided and after telling several \"legal\" stories succeeded in getting most of the fellows to say a few words. He also read letters of regret from Chellis, Charles French, Glaze (via his wife, Winifred), Gordon, Leverone and Mathes. Max Hartmann had planned to be with us but hurricane Donna made it necessary to stay at Ft. Myers Beach and repair the damage to his property.\n\nAs usual Harvey Whittemore supplied all of us with a beautiful white carnation. This dinner wouldn't be the same without this yearly gesture by Harvey.\n\nA letter from Earl Cutting, 1912, advises that his brother Raymond is able to sit up every day and go for an auto ride once in a while but cannot walk or move around without assistance.\n\nCon and Grace Chellis have gone into hibernation for the winter at 350 First Street North, St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nNew Addresses: Jack Kingsbury, 412 42nd Ave., North Myrtle Beach, S.
