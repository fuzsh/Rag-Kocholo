        "text": "While you were spending that late Sept. Saturday afternoon at the golf course or with the wife and kids, this scribe was enjoying the view high from Memorial Field in Hanover as the Big Green shut out New Hampshire. Making the game most pleasant was a wonderful visit with Jim Murar.\n\nJim was in New York on business and flew up for the game. The old roomie reports that wife Jan and children Robbi and Mandy all work together to keep Jim's Newport Beach, Calif., home pretty busy. Jim's brother-in-law, Dave Walsh, stops in often along with wife Emmy and their two children.\n\nLate in the summer I bumped into ChuckPreuss at my brother's wedding. Chuck is winding up his third year at Stanford Law School and spends his spare time on the tennis courts with Phil Meyer. Wonder if Phil ever recovered from that last trip West?\n\nAt Nha Trang Air Base in Vietnam, Captain Art Pettengill received the U.S. Air Force Commendation Medal. He was decorated for meritorious service as a communications officer while at Tachikawa Air Base in Japan. Art's citation notes his outstanding professional skill, knowledge, and managerial ability in performance of his duties. He is now assigned to Nha Trang as a member of the Air Force Communications Service in support of the Pacific Air Forces.\n\nWord has it that Don Samuelson was in Boston recruiting for the University of Chicago Law School. Sam made it up to the Princeton game along with Gordi Williamson. Rumor is that Gordi wore his light blue shirt for the occasion.\n\nSyracuse University has announced the appointment of Robert Sprafkin as an assistant professor of psychology. Bob has been pretty busy since leaving Dartmouth as he picked up his master's at Columbia and is presently pursuing his Ph.D. at Ohio State where he was a teaching associate. Bob also found time to labor for the Veterans Administration, the Ohio State Rehabilitation Center, and the New York State Division of Vocational Rehabilitation. Another busy paper grader is Stan Sclove who does his magic for the department of statistics at Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. Stan comes to Carnegie from Stanford where he was a research associate. Previously Stan served as a mathematical statistician at the Taft Center, U.S. Public Health Service, and was a teaching preceptor at Columbia where he received his Ph.D.\n\nBucknell University has also taken on a '62 professor as Ted Rochow lectures from the biology department. Ted headed for Bucknell after a stay at Duke University where he gathered up a master's and Ph.D.\n\nSomehow those marriage announcements keep rolling in. Dick Briggs said his \"I do\" to Gwynne Fowler in June. Gwynne is a graduate of Cornell while Dick performs as an M.D. at Hartford Hospital in Conn. Dick was awarded his degree in medicine by the University of Virgina.\n\nA newcomer to Boston is Tom Parsons along with the Mrs., Toni, and daughter Sarah. Tom is presently the New England Director of the Inter Variety Christian Fellowship which is aimed at college and university students.\n\nNext time you're strolling down the mam street in Helsinki, give a call to Chip Simpson who is spending his days in Finland. I finally know whom to thank for the refrigerator breaks during the tube hours. Bruce McCollom produces TV commercials for the advertising firm of Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborne in New York.\n\nJim Young returned to Hanover to pick up his degree in '66 following four years in the service, and now spends the hours with his wife cracking those medical books at the University of Vermont Medical School.\n\nThat former alien, Manuel Buchwald, is back home in Toronto where he operates as a research fellow at the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. Manuel previously was presented his Ph.D. in Biochemistry at Brandeis where he met his wife Barbara who, according to Manuel, is blonde and blue-eyed and speaks French, but not Spanish.\n\nFrom Manchester, N. H., Bruce Keller sends word that he is handling the advertising and is national sales manager for Kalwall Corporation. Bruce and the t'amuy (two daughters) arrived in Manchester following graduation from Tuck in '65.\n\nSusan informs me that the leaves are ganging up on the yard. Reading some letters from you fellows will gain me a reprieve. A little help?\n\nSecretary, 58 High St. Somersworth, N. H. 03878\n\nTreasurer, 6 Claflin Circle Hanover, N. H. 03755"
