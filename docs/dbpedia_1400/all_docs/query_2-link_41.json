If a grant is approved, the grant funds will be disbursed to your student account. If you have not already signed up for direct deposit, please do so in DuckWeb in order to facilitate the swift deposit of funds if you are approved for a grant. Importantly, disbursements from this fund will not be applied to outstanding balances on your student account (if any). Rather, the funds will be made available directly to you to defray any COVID-19-related expenses you may have incurred, consistent with HEERF funding guidelines. more...\n\nCraig Walker Communications Scholarship\n\nScholarship for Oregon or Washington residents who are full-time undergraduate students (freshmen ineligible) attending Oregon State University and are majoring in Radio Broadcasting or Communications.
