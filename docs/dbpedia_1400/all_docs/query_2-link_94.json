After beginning his career in academic cardiology at McGill University in Montreal, he moved to Toronto as Head of Cardiology at St. Michael's Hospital and later Director of the Division of Cardiology, and Executive Director of the McLaughlin Centre for Molecular Medicine at the University of Toronto. He was recruited to lead the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) in 2007. Dr. Stewart has made a number of seminal discoveries elucidating the importance of endothelial factors in health and disease, notably the role of the nitric oxide system in angiogenesis and the role of endothelin-1 in pulmonary hypertension. He is also a leader in developing cell and gene based therapies for cardiovascular disease. He led the first Canadian clinical trial to test an angiogenic gene therapy – using VEGF to try to stimulate heart repair in people who had suffered heart attacks. He is also spearheading the world's first clinical trial of a gene-enhanced cell therapy for pulmonary hypertension, using endothelial progenitor cells engineered to over-express endothelial nitric oxide synthase. He is also poised to launch the first enhanced progenitor cell therapy trial for post heart-attack repair, and he is leading a Canadian effort to initiate the world's first trial of mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Dr. Stewart has published more than 200 peer-reviewed manuscripts and has received a number of distinctions and prizes, including the Dexter Man Chair of Cardiology and Research Achievement Award of the University of Toronto, and the Research Achievement Award of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society. Throughout his career, Dr. Stewart has demonstrated leadership in bringing diverse groups of clinicians and scientists together to put Canada on the world stage for translational cardiovascular and regenerative medicine research.\n\nIRP Member – Professor Victor Dzau\n\nChancellor for Health Affairs, Duke University\n\nPresident and CEO, Duke University Health System\n\nJames B.

He has responsibility for developing not only the research strategy but also for ensuring appropriate career opportunities for those wishing to pursue an academic career. His remit also covers Arthritis Research UK's educational role from patient information to ensuring training for all health professionals. Until 2007 he was the director of Arthritis Research UK's Epidemiology Unit in Manchester and had research interests in several areas of rheumatology.\n\nHe has published over 500 original articles and a few books, and is one of the 5 joint editors of the major international reference work \"Rheumatology\".

Lupski\n\nThe Cullen Endowed Chair in Molecular Genetics\n\nProfessor, Department of Molecular and Human Genetics and Department of Pediatrics\n\nBaylor College of Medicine, Houston TX USA\n\nAfter completing an MD/PhD at New York University, Jim Lupski moved to Houston, Texas in 1986 for clinical training in paediatrics and medical genetics. He then established his own laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine where he remains, and as of 1995, as the Cullen Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics. The Lupski laboratory has developed the concept of genomic disorders, diseases due to rearrangements of the human genome rather than DNA sequence base changes, and established the critical role of gene dosage in conveying human disease phenotypes. An increasing number of diseases are recognized to result from Copy Number Variation (CNV) involving unstable genomic regions; recent examples include both autism and schizophrenia. The laboratory focuses on the delineation of specific genomic disorders, elucidating the mechanisms for human genomic rearrangements resulting in CNV, and clinical implementation of high resolution human genome analysis to link structural variants with clinical phenotypes. Professor Lupski has co-authored over 450 scientific publications, is an inventor on more than 20 patents and has delivered over 325 invited lectures in 26 countries.\n\nIRP Member – Professor Rudi Balling\n\nDirector - Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine\n\nUniversity of Luxembourg"
