        "text": "In the past, I have been enormously helped by people who recorded audio of various lectures and conferences and then kindly posted it on the web. I have recorded a few of the sessions from the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL) and the American Academy of Religion (AAR) annual meetings November 17-20, 2007 in San Diego. See my previous post about attending the meetings. There are literally thousands of lectures at the meetings but I thought I would give you a sample of the ones I attended. At each time slot, there are about 30-40 choices to choose from. Sometimes I bounce from one to another. Other times I find someone to talk to and skip the sessions. So some of the talks are not complete. But I still thought I would post what my little MP3 player recorded and see if anyone was interested.\n\nFor the next couple of years, SBL and AAR will not meet together. Some AAR people led this divorce but people in my circles are hopeful that after a couple of years people will reconsider. Typically theologians, historians, practical theology, and people who study other religions than Christianity attend AAR. Biblical studies people attend SBL. But in the past these have occurred together so that many of us have enjoyed sessions from both. April 28, 2008 Update: the AAR has decide to begin meeting with SBL again when they are able to work out the logistics in a few years again.\n\nOther places to find great audio:\n\nIf you like audio, see my now outdated Best Audio for Church Leaders (Aug 2006) but still useful list of MP3’s on the internet and my instructions about listening to podcasts in my also outdated post Best Podcasts for Church Leaders (Oct 2006).\n\nAlso Evangelical Theological Society (ETS) has this on their site:\n\nAs in previous years, ACTS, inc. will be recording all sessions at the conference. Online orders for these recordings may be placed on their web site at the following address: http://actsonline.biz/ets_21_ctg.htm. The entire conference costs $149.00.\n\nI do not think AAR and SBL record their sessions at all.\n\nIf you dislike my low quality recordings, check out christianaudio.com which has quite a good selection of Christian books on audio. For example, you can download the unabridged 6 hour audiobook of Eugene Peterson’s Eat This Book for $20.98. (This is the book Duke Divinity School first year students were required to read this year). That would be a very rich six hour car drive. They also offer a free download each month. This month (November) it is The Religious Affections (Unabridged) by Jonathan Edwards. In December it is Dark Night of the Soul (Unabridged) by St. John of the Cross.\n\nInstructions for playing MP3’s:\n\nI have given you MP3’s which play on any computer. You just right click on it and click “Save Link As . . .” or “Save Target As . . .” and you can save it to your desktop (and it will be on your computer and you can listen to it whenever you want). If you have an MP3 player, you just plug in to your computer like a memory stick and move the MP3’s from your computer to your player.\n\nI have pasted below the SBL or AAR description of the session (S is for SBL and A is for AAR) and then put a note in italics with my comment about the recording. I’m sorry to say that I have not listened to these recordings nor edited them. If you are interested, I thought you would appreciate them anyway.\n\nLet me know in the comments if you appreciated them or if they were too poor quality to be helpful. I haven’t done this before so I just thought I would give it a shot. I have emailed the speakers to let them know I have posted these and I will take down the talks if any of them wish. But I do think this is good publicity for AAR, SBL and each of the speakers.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the MP3’s I recorded from 9 presentations I heard at SBL/AAR this past weekend.\n\nAM17-28\n\n________________________________________\n\nEmergent Church Forum\n\n11/17/2007\n\n9:00 AM to 11:30 AM\n\nRoom: 29 C – CC\n\nThe panelists are Tony Jones, Diana Butler Bass and Scot McKnight and the moderator, from Azusa Pacific University, is Keith Matthews.\n\nI missed the first ten minutes of this one. Tony was speaking when I arrived.\n\nEmergent Church Forum.mp3 (131 MB; 2 hrs. 19 min.)\n\nUpdate: December 18: The first hour of this lecture is also available now on the Emergent Village podcast website but honestly you didn’t miss too much in the 10 minutes I missed but Tony’s recording is a better recording. I would expect that they would put up part 2 (the second hour) at the end of December.\n\nAM17-53\n\n________________________________________\n\nMission and Biblical Interpretation: toward a Missional Hermeneutic\n\n11/17/2007\n\n1:00 PM to 3:30 PM\n\nRoom: 28 C – CC\n\nWhat would it mean to read the Bible with an explicit methodological starting point in an ecclesial location understood as fundamentally missional? Join us for our sixth annual session focused on such questions, as Princeton Theological Seminary professors Darrell Guder and J. Ross Wagner present their work on missional hermeneutics in the seminary classroom. We anticipate a thought-provoking and productive discussion.\n\nI only taped Ross’s brief comments about Philippians.

In particular the session will discuss the impact of Professor Ochs’ work on the recently developed set of practices referred to as scriptural reasoning. Panelists will speak from the perspective of their various disciplines including, philosophy of religion, Christian theology and contemporary Jewish philosophy.\n\nI recorded until from the beginning of the session until Smith was finished (the first three speakers).

The Marty Forum provides an informal setting in which Dr. Bellah will talk about his work with Professor of American Religion Randall Balmer and will engage in discussion with the audience.\n\nI taped all of it except the last ten minutes when my battery ran out.

Deeper theological engagement with economic theory is needed because (a) much contemporary religious discussion of economics is ill-informed and superficial (b) economics dominates contemporary culture. In the session panel members will consider a number of recent theological readings of economics, followed by discussion. The emphasis will be economic theory rather than particular economic issues because religious engagement with particular issues depends on our view of the relationship between theology and the economic tools we use to consider the various issues. At the end of the session we will discuss the proposal for a new AAR group on religion and economics and its relationship to the Religion and Social Sciences Section.\n\nI taped Milbank and Barrera.

The first part has Barclay and Wright. In the second part, Jewett responds and Barclay and Wright respond. They then took some questions but I skipped out at that point. Many New Testament scholars were there. There is lots of talk on the blogosphere about this one. If you google, Wright Barclay Paul Empire, you’ll get lots of hits.\n\nNew link March 6, 2020\n\nPaul and Empire – Part 1 of 2\n\n(84 MB; 1 hr. 30 min.)\n\nPaul and Empire – Part 2 of 2\n\n(30 MB; 33 min.)\n\nSome students at Taylor University, where I taught the last two years, have asked me eight questions about worship. Their questions touch on a number of issues related to contemporary worship but also worship in general. Here are my responses.\n\n#1: What is your definition of worship?\n\nIt is not really a definition but I like 1 Corinthians 14:15 (TNIV)\n\n\"So what shall I do? I\n\nwill pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I\n\nwill sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding.\"\n\nPaul here is arguing that there should be an affective (emotional, hearty,\n\ntongues) part of worship but also a part that is cognitive\n\n(intellectual, heady, prophecy). He actually thinks that tongues are a\n\ngood thing but if you do focus too much on emotional stuff in worship that only\n\nresonates with you (uninterrupted tongues) than a lot of other people\n\nwill be annoyed and not edified (built up).\n\nI think Communion/Lord’s Supper/Eucharist is probably the best example of what worship is. It is centered on\n\nChrist, communal, symbolic, looks forward to him coming again, tangible\n\n(you eat and drink something), involves prayer, and singing (in the\n\ngospel accounts), remembers back, and builds on the Old Testament\n\n(Passover). You can’t go wrong with this as a starting point.\n\nCatholics and Anglicans/Episcopalians center their worship around the\n\nEucharist for this reason. Jesus told people to celebrate it in the gospels and\n\nthen we see people doing it (Paul in 1 Cor 11).\n\nWith regard to definition: one Hebrew word means work/worship; a Greek word means bow.\n\nDeclaring to God what he’s worth (worth-ship = worship).\n\nThe chief end of human beings is to worship God and enjoy him forever (Westminster Catechism).\n\nPeople often look at Isaiah 6 and Revelation 4-5 as other paradigm examples on which to build your theology of worship.\n\n#2: How do you wrestle with the \"me\" focus and making a meaningful response to God?\n\nSome people go crazy turning \"me\" songs into \"we\"\n\nsongs but I think this is too simplistic. Even if we are a community,\n\nwe are still a community of individuals, right? Also, the Psalms have\n\nlots of first person singular language (me, I) and they were used in\n\nthe temple and then in the church (John Calvin especially) as the\n\ncorporate prayerbook. Monks have prayed the\n\nwhole Psalter (all 150) every week. However, those who think that they would be\n\nbetter off worshipping by themselves on a mountain top rather than joining a\n\ncommunity, have missed Christianity. But again, there is a place for\n\npersonal retreats. The thing to emphasize is that we become part of\n\nthe people of God when we become Christians. Becoming a Christian is\n\nnot just fire insurance for when you die someday, then you can go to\n\nheaven. Yes, it is that but it is about being part of a community of\n\ndisciples of Jesus who God has called to be his ambassadors here on\n\nearth and that we embody the kingdom of God already but not yet fully.\n\n#3: How do you choose worship music? Are there certain themes that you look for? Does that change depending on environment?\n\nBy\n\nthe way, these are excellent questions. Yes, choosing worship music.\n\nI have a blog post about some of the practical ways we tried to plan\n\nworship at the church. I\n\nwould recommend reading that. It is very practical.\n\nHow to plan and lead worship\n\nDoes\n\nit change depending on the environment? Yes. I think as worship\n\nleaders we should think of ourselves as missionaries or educators.\n\n(Here is where your Christian Educational Ministries classes might help. We need to know our audience /\n\nstudents, etc. and help them to praise the Lord. We need to speak\n\ntheir language and begin where they are at. As Thomas Groome, in Shared Christian Praxis would\n\nsay, we need to bring people from where they are at (their \"present\n\naction\" = Movement 1) to reflecting on that (Movement 2 = Confession) to God (Movement\n\n3) to action (Movements 4-5). In order to do that, we need to know the\n\npeople. For many years before Vatican II in the 1950’s, all Roman\n\nCatholic worship services or \"mass\" as they call it, were in Latin.\n\nBut most people couldn’t understand it. They decided at Vatican II (a\n\nbig conference of Catholics) to let the mass be done in people’s\n\neveryday languages! Similarly, I think we should lead\n\nworship in a way that \"speaks the language\" of teenage African American\n\nkids (hip-hop) or whatever language the group understands. This is\n\nwhat a good missionary does and what a good educator does.\n\n#4: How do you react to the statement \"One cannot sing praise songs\n\nwithout noticing how first person pronouns tend to eclipse every other subject?\"\n\nI\n\nthink the person who is saying it (I don’t know who but I know the\n\ntype) wants to beware of narcissistic (self-centered) tendencies. They\n\nwant to correct the excesses of consumer culture which says everything\n\nonly has value in what it can do for me. But I think they are reacting\n\nin the wrong sort of way. Like I said above, the Psalms are often\n\nfirst person singular. We/us songs can be just as vacuous (shallow) as\n\nI/me songs. I would be sympathetic to the person’s concerns in that\n\nwe want people to focus on God, not themselves, but the pronouns I and\n\nme are just part of the way we speak and are not inherently bad.\n\nAgain, I would want to sympathize with the person making the criticism\n\nthat Christianity is more than just praying a prayer to go to heaven.\n\nIt is not just individualistic one-time thing that excludes ethical\n\ncommitments, commitments to Christian friendships/community/church /accountability/critique.\n\nAgain, the danger of the individualistic thing (me and my Bible on a\n\nmountaintop – I don’t need anyone else ever in my life) is not\n\ngenerally the problem with people who are passionate about contemporary\n\nworship in my opinion. But there may be exceptions. I see the\n\nVineyard, Matt Redman, Chris Tomlin worship folks as quite committed to\n\nChristian community despite some of their I/me songs.\n\n#5: How does the corporate worship that occurs on Sunday morning\n\ndiffer from the corporate worship of chapel or other Christian formation experiences throughout the week?\n\nAgain,\n\nexcellent question. I think it makes sense to worship with those who are your primary\n\ncommunity. I think it makes sense that those who hold you accountable\n\n(those who would call you on sin in your life) that those people are\n\nthe people you worship with. Thus, I think there is some rationale for\n\nchapel at a Christian college or even worship in a small group.\n\nThere is some reason by Christian tradition to worship\n\non Sunday (the Lord’s day) but I don’t think this is crucial. I think\n\nSat night services (or any other day) is fine! Additionally, I think\n\nthat Sunday worship in a church may offer some things you don’t get in\n\nchapel and dorm floor prayer and praise. For example,\n\nintergenerational relationships (we can learn from older people and\n\nfrom kids); stability (it is not an entirely new group of people every\n\nfour years); and locality (ministry to people locally). Again, I\n\nthink there is great value in extended evenings of singing (it teaches\n\nmusicians new music, people learn to sing better, it is good to\n\nrefocus, etc.) but just a worship night and never being part of a\n\ncommunity would be a deficient Christianity (need discipleship,\n\nevangelism, ministry to the poor, and community care).\n\n#6: What can seekers gain from worshiping?\n\nSee 1 Corinthians 14:23-25 (TNIV).\n\n23 So if the whole church\n\ncomes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or\n\nunbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? 24\n\nBut if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is\n\nprophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment\n\nby all, 25 as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, \"God is really among you!\"\n\nWhat\n\nPaul is saying here is that worship should be comprehensible to\n\nnon-Christians. That does not mean it should be watered down. Paul is\n\nsimply saying that new people will probably attend every worship\n\nservice and the basics of the service should be fairly understandable\n\nto them. If everyone in the room is speaking in tongues, than the new\n\nperson would understandably be confused. Paul thinks that it is\n\npossible that the observer will be moved by what he or she sees when\n\nthey observe Christians in worship when the service is intelligible.\n\nNow there is a wide range of applications of this that I think are\n\nlegitimate. A Roman Catholic feels they have made it understandable\n\nenough by having the liturgy in the hymnal and in the common language.\n\nAndy Stanley / Willow Creek / and Granger Community Church (Granger,\n\nIN) would say these verses are their primary purpose. Their primary\n\ngoal is to inspire and intrigue seekers to come back and to say, \"God\n\nis really among you!\" In order to do that, they meticulously plan\n\ntheir worship services to praise God and tell about his truth but doing\n\nso in a way that the average non-Christian in their community would\n\nunderstand. They try to rid their services of extraneous theological\n\njargon while still conveying accurately the truths about God. Some\n\nwould say that this is putting the cart before the horse or having the\n\ntail wag the dog, \"Why would you let non-Christians decide what\n\nChristian worship is? Worship is for Christians!\" But the seeker\n\ndriven people would respond, \"But aren’t we supposed to be ‘the one\n\norganization that exists for non-members’ (William Temple)? Isn’t the\n\npoint to ‘make disciples’ (Matt 28:18-20 Great Commission)?\" I would\n\nurge the seeker-driven church proponent people to make sure they are\n\nnot just reaching people where they are at but also helping them\n\ndevelop into sacrificial close imitators of Jesus. I would urge the\n\nworship purists to make sure they have other ways of reaching\n\nnon-Christians for Christ (such as the Alpha course or vibrant personal\n\nevangelism). I think either approach can be legitimate.\n\n#7: What kind of music we should sing, particularly in regards to worship music?\n\nThere\n\nwas a time that drums were seen as the music of the devil. But people\n\nresponded by saying, \"Martin Luther put hymns to bar tunes\" and\n\nredeemed that musical genre. (I’m not sure if that Luther thing is\n\nactually true. Perhaps it is. People repeat it a lot though). I\n\nthink it is conceivable that some music in itself is incompatible with\n\nChristian worship. I think of shrieking heavy metal where the words\n\nare incomprehensible. I think this is comparable to the discussion by\n\nPaul in 1 Cor 12-14 about tongues. That just because it moves you\n\nemotionally and it is done with a Christian motivation, doesn’t mean it\n\nis appropriate for Christian worship. But maybe those people who\n\nshriek the 23rd Psalm can do it by themselves or with a small group of\n\npeople who appreciate that in a setting outside of corporate worship.\n\nThey should still be going to a church service where there is in Paul’s\n\nwords \"intelligible\" content to the worship services.\n\n#8: What part do you think that traditional worship should play in corporate worship?\n\nAgain,\n\nas an educator or missionary, you are trying to help the whole audience\n\nunderstand the message. Thus, I think if you have lots of older people\n\nwho have difficulty comprehending the words and singing contemporary\n\nworship, then it is your job to help them do so or to incorporate\n\naspects of worship that they do understand (like hymns). This is what\n\nwe did in our church as you can see from the worship guidelines I\n\nmention above in number 3. However, I would also try to make the case\n\nto the older people that \"the church is an organization that exists for\n\nthe purpose of its non-members\" and thus we need to continue to pursue\n\nmethods that make it more likely that when \"inquirers or\n\nunbelievers come in\" (1 Cor 14:23) and young people come in, \"they will\n\nfall down and worship God, exclaiming, ‘God is really among you!’\" (1\n\nCor 14:25) because the service is designed to be intelligible (1 Cor\n\n12-14) to them."
