Both films, which have a focus on ants, are fully 3D animated. Antz was animated by PDI and is the company's first fully 3D animated film. PDI uses a special Crowd Animation System technology, developed in-house, to be able and show scenes that have over 60,000 ants on screen at one time! Antz is the adventure of one ant who wants to make something of his life--to be noted as an individual instead of another number.\n\nSteve Jobs and John Lasseter of Pixar Animation claimed DreamWorks stole A Bug's Life concept. They say SKG principal Jeffrey Katzenberg lifted the idea when he was second in command at Disney several years ago. \"The bad guys rarely win,\" Jobs tells the Los Angeles Times. Nonsense, replied DreamWorks execs, claiming Disney was just sore because they lost the race to get their film into the theaters. \"Steve Jobs should take a pill,\" DreamWorks marketing exec Terry Press told the Times. \"He looks ridiculous.\" Press also told the Hollywood Reporter that if Katzenberg had had anything to do with A Bug's Life while employed at Disney, all such matters would have been taken care of during his contract buyout. DreamWorks also flatly denied reports--made in both Time and Newsweek this week--that it decided on the Disney-disadvantageous release date only after head mouse Michael Eisner refused to delay Bugs to accommodate Katzenberg's DreamWorks pet project Prince of Egypt.\n\nMeryl Streep supposedly recorded a part that was either cut or replaced in the final version of the movie.\n\nDreamWorks animator Aaron Estrada made the following public comments on ANTZ: \"As far as ANTZ goes, I thought it was pretty fun. I guess a lot of other people liked it too, because it had the biggest October opening of any film to date ($17.2 million). I'm happy that DreamWorks is making films for a wider audience.\""
