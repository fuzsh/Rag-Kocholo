        "text": "by KE Monahan Huntley\n\nPre and Z are American heroes. Steve Prefontaine, the dramatic biographical subject of Robert Towne's Without Limits, and Z, Dreamworks' insecure animated warrior in Antz, initially may not appear to have anything in common, however, each embody the indomitable spirit of individual achievement. In terms of Dramatica, each film provides a grand argument story in which main characters Z and Pre invite the audience to take their point of view.\n\nIn his opening dialogue, Z introduces the underground world in which he resides, and the societal infrastructure of which he is a necessary (albeit reluctant) part.\n\nThe ants are \"part of the fastest growing species in the whole world\" (os benchmark-progress). Working on a \"megatunnel,\" they are concerned with this task at hand (os concern-present), despite not knowing its purpose:\n\nOstensibly in charge is the Queen, but the real power behind the throne is General Formica:\n\nFormica intends to entrench his position by marrying Princess Bala (influence character), although they are mere acquaintances:\n\nBala \"followed by her handmaidens, who are in a state of giggling infatuation over Formica\" (os thematic issue-attraction)conceives (ic concern) of a plan to squelch her \"pre-wedding jitters\"-slumming it at the worker bar:\n\nAt the worker bar, Z learns (mc concern) of Insectopia from a \"grizzled old SCOUT ant\" with a buzz on. Before he has time to assess (mc focus-evaluation) this information, the music starts up and the ants (with the exception of Z) line up to dance-\"in perfect synch\"-of course.\n\nFrom the sidelines, Z kvetches:\n\nUntil the beautiful Bala asks him to dance (rs focus-proaction). \"Z is instantly smitten\" (rs direction-reaction). Their rumba causes a rumble, and Bala pulls a Cinderella running off-leaving Z clutching her Chanel scarf.\n\nConvinced it's true love (rs problem-certainty), Z talks his sidekick Weaver, a soldier in the Queen's army, into trading places (mc approach-doer). His attempt (rs inhibitor) to reunite with Bala fails: \"Who is that idiot?\"-and Z is swept into battle (mc benchmark-doing). The ensuing massacre leaves Z as the only survivor: \"I've never seen such bloodthirstiness, such bad manners\"-and consequently a war hero:\n\nIn the midst of the celebration Z is caught out as a worker masquerading as a warmonger: \"It was more what I'd call a clever ruse.\" Holding Bala as hostage, he backs up from the ballroom to the kitchen and they both fall backwards down the garbage chute. They discover the perils of the great outdoors-magnifying glasses that fry, sneakers that stomp-and their immediate response (rs benchmark-preconscious) is to bicker in true romantic comedic fashion:\n\nBala is fixated on returning to the colony; Z is just as determined to find Insectopia (rs domain-mind): \"Now you follow the yellow egg . . . that direction\" (male mental sex).\n\nMeanwhile, back at the colony, the workers are restless (os focus-proaction) and Formica, sensing Z's influence, sends Ant Team Six, his \"crack team of hardcore flying-ant commandos\" to eliminate the upstart and retrieve Bala (os direction-reaction).\n\nZ and Bala happen upon Insectopia (rs catalyst-investigation), a veritable pest paradise. After partaking of a feast \"they smile shyly as if they just met for the first time\" (rs thematic counterpoint-reappraisal). Courtship is cut short, however, as Major Mandible's attempt (rs inhibitor) to capture Bala succeeds. The princess, deducing (ic driver) what kind of man Formica really is lies to protect Z (\"He was eaten by a praying mantis\"), and announces \"I could never go through marrying you. I'm an individual, and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose (ic solution-induction). Bala is locked away. Z returns to rescue her, and in true hero fashion, save the day:\n\nZ changes (mc resolve) from a worker ant, camouflaging his feelings of insignificance with false bravado (mc growth-stop), to a real leader. He commands the other ants, now individuals, to work (os catalyst) together as a team (mc unique ability-prerequisites) to successfully (outcome) preserve the society in which they wish to be a part (os goal-present).\n\nSteve Prefontaine has none of Z's insecurities. A track star in high school, he is courted by top colleges-the only one he wishes to attend, however, is the University of Oregon. Before he enrolls, Pre wants Bill Bowerman (influence character), a coach (ic concern-being) who doesn't believe in the value (ic critical flaw) of himself recruiting, to invite him. Pre's confidence (rs catalyst) in his skill (unique ability) as a runner accelerates the relationship between Bill Bowerman and himself:\n\nBowerman considers (rs signpost 1-conscious) Dellinger's advice and writes to Pre: \"If you do us the honor of attending the University of Oregon (story driver-action), there is no doubt in my mind that you can become (os precondition) the nation's finest distance runner, perhaps the world's\" (os benchmark-future).\n\nThe objective story domain is explored in the confines of amateur track and field competition (universe) where athletes are ranked individually and in teams, whether for college or country. The goal centers on Steve Prefontaine's progress as a college distance runner. To make his development meaningful, a requirement of the future is put in place (Olympics)-Pre's basic competitive drive (subconscious) is the prerequisite, and his insistence on becoming part of Oregon's team an unessential restriction placed on the effort to achieve the goal.\n\nIn the objective story, proven (os problem) records drive the athletes to break them; in the influence character throughline, Bowerman's proven (ic problem) method of coaching is what Pre challenges (mc approach-doer):\n\nPre's natural instinct (rs concern-preconscious) as a frontrunner leads to a contentious relationship with Bowerman-but his (in)experience (mc thematic issue), particularly in international competition, necessitates Bowerman's ability (ic unique ability) as a coach.\n\nPre is driven by the expectations (mc problem) he places upon himself. He arrogantly refuses to acknowledge any innate talent-he believes it is only by sheer guts (mc solution-determination) that he crosses the finish line first. The epitome of poetry in motion, Pre died instantly in an auto accident the evening of winning the American 5000-meter-a record still held today. In his eulogy, Bill Bowerman illuminates how the coach who went on to create Nike shoes and his \"showboat\" runner who embodied the phrase \"Just do it\"-make Without Limits a success story (outcome), despite Steve Prefontaine's tragic end.\n\nPre is based on fact, Z on fantasy. Their heroics relayed in the context of a well structured and tightly woven grand argument story makes their compelling characters even more so-and absolutely worth the price of a second admission ticket."
