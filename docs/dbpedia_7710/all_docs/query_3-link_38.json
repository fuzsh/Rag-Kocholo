The decaying ruins of an Ant Colony, the monarchy are weak, decadent and powerless; a fascist ant ruler is seizing power for himself, while a lowly intellectual Jew ant is pushing for a workers revolution to overthrow the existing order.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>68640184\n\nNotice how Z was the only one who was against the collectivism in every facet of life. They even had a single correct dance to be done collectively. He was against the government deciding who does what job and how their lives should be lived.
