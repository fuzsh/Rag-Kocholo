        "text": "Image: ‘Z’ and Princess Bala choosing to make up their own dance style. Notice the symmetrical lines of ants in the background, all dancing identically.\n\n(The Film Festivals Server. nd. Antz. Retrieved June 1, 2010 from http://www.filmfestivals.com/review/antz/antz.htm)\n\nAn obvious reading of Darnell and Johnson’s 1998 film Antz is a Marxist one. In the film, the military and the overseers force the worker ants to work. The worker ants, who are designated their role at birth, are expected to work continuously (without social interaction) on a project they have no control over. The resolution of the film is a collective uprising against the military general. All very Marxist (Moon, 1992, p82; Falzon, 2005). Another prominent theory in the film is the utilitarian view: the insignificance of each ant, and the repetition of the ants’ code: ‘for the good of the colony’, is echoed throughout the film (Mill, 1863). This view is also an existentialist one, where the limitations of society are a threat to individual freedom and identity (Falzon, 2005, p 117).\n\nThere is another very interesting idea within Antz to be considered. While the regime of the ant colony is oppressive by western standards, most ants, apart from the main characters Z and Princess Bala, are initially satisfied with their lives. Azteca, a worker ant, tells Z, “I love my work. You just think too much. Help us build a bigger better colony… and be happy about it” (Darnell and Johnson, 1998). The society of the ant colony has conditioned its workers to believe that this is the life they want. If the ants are satisfied and do not want for more, are they free individuals, or merely a faceless society?\n\nPlato, Locke and Hobbes believed that society, along with its government, laws and law enforcement, was necessary to prevent chaos (Falzon, 2002). Liberalism agrees with these theorists, however it maintains that there must be a minimum amount of freedom owed to individuals (Tait, 2004, p 16). To determine whether the ants in the film were free individuals within their society, freedom must be defined.\n\nImmanuel Kant believed that individual freedom was a matter of self-determination; being able to choose and pursue one’s own goals (Falzon, 2002). For Berlin, it is a matter of autonomy (Steinbock, 2007, p85; Falzon, 2002). The ants, designated their roles at birth, are clearly not free in this sense. However, once being given their goals, if they choose to adopt and pursue these goals as their own, it could be argued that this satisfied Kant’s criteria for freedom.\n\nMill argues that freedom consists of the right to develop one’s individuality (Falzon, 2005). According this criterion, the ants are not free. All of the worker ants are delegated the same tasks and there is no room for individuality. Even in their free time, the ants are expected to train or to dance in the same way (Darnell and Johnson, 1998).\n\nThere is one more important point to consider. Freedom of thought. While the ants succeed in their uprising and overthrow one of their dictators, the resolution is to return to the colony life. Z says, “I finally found my place. It was right back where I started, but this time I chose it” (Darnell and Johnson, 1998). Clearly Z feels that he made this choice independently, but surely his wants were shaped by the society in which he was conditioned? If so, is he truly free?\n\nThe film Antz portrays an ant colony that is similar to human societies. It has laws, government, employers and employees, and a place for everyone. While western society allows its individuals to choose their occupations, how free are they to choose? The conditioning of society ensures that most people, whether satisfied with their lives or not, will continue to maintain the status quo because they feel they should be satisfied. The film Antz should not be viewed in contrast to our societies, but as a warning commentary on them.\n\nSuggested for further reading:\n\nMill, J.
