        "text": "Join a Discussion on Film\n\nBy JANET MASLIN\n\nomputer animation has advanced to the point where it can make a cute romantic couple out of Woody Allen and Sharon Stone, not to mention back-slapping buddies out of Allen and Sylvester Stallone. These and other surreal tricks are shown off in Dreamworks' funny new insect picture, the first one out of the anthill.\n\nDreamworks In \"Antz,\" Princess Bala, left, has the voice of Sharon Stone. Her friend Z replies in Woody Allen's voice.\n\nStriving for the clever anthropomorphism of \"Toy Story,\" \"Antz\" recruits above-the-title voice talent to create tiny characters with big personalities. Its shrewd computer animators have great fun seeing the world from an ant's-eye point of view.\n\nHowever well it works at first, though, \"Antz\" winds up overplotted in bizarrely grandiose ways. Must every child-friendly adventure film boil down to a struggle for world domination? And did this one really need to invoke genocide in its final reel? Surely a threat of bug spray in the picnic basket could have done the trick.\n\nOn the bright side, which is substantial enough to make \"Antz\" at least as amusing for adults as for children, Allen sounds wonderfully invigorated by the chance to play a guy with all those legs -- and all those ant-specific reasons for angst. The film, handily directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson, begins with Allen's Z in therapy, lying on a leaf in a nutshell as he laments being the middle child in a family of five million. He complains of feeling insignificant, only to be told by his psychologist (Paul Mazursky) that he IS. Allen's lines, delivered with his sharpest comic timing, sound just like his own writing. (The screenplay is by Todd Alcott, Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz.) He dismisses one group of curly-antennaed ant females by saying: \"They're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.\"\n\nOne night, breaking away from the crowd in what \"Antz\" pictures wittily as a totalitarian workers' paradise, Z meets Princess Bala (extra imperious, as played by Ms. Stone) at a bar, where they dance a la \"Pulp Fiction\" to suit the film's knowing tone.\n\nBut soon after this the ant colony is caught up in a war effort against termites (\"Why don't we just try to influence their political process with campaign contributions?\" Z wonders), and the film starts showing signs of a heavier hand. The military leader General Mandible (Gene Hackman) has big dreams that involve sacrificing the little people, to the point where \"Antz\" invokes the Holocaust with jarring abruptness. The film can't comfortably go from celebrating the bug's-eye glories of a full trash can to expecting nice-guy ant heroes to save the world.\n\n\"Antz\" works best just showing off its prodigious voice talent (Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez and Christopher Walken are also in the cast) and playing lightheartedly with the curious possibilities of a buggy world. Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin fly into the film as Chip and Muffy, behaving like the very WASPiest of wasps, while at another point in the story, spaced-out teen-age ants sit around oh-wowing about whether they're part of a larger world. Ambitiously designed crowd sequences manipulate huge numbers of tiny figures much more fluidly than other recent animated features have done.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES\n\nANTZ\n\nRating: \"Antz\" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).
