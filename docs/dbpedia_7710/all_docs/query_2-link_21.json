        "text": "Welcome back film explorers!!! This week I want to watch Antz (1998). This movie has a lot of political and social agendas in play. However, I want to talk about a more basic theme going on. Each character, whether they realize it or not, needs someone or something they don’t or can’t have.\n\nZ (Woody Allen) is searching for some meaning in life and motivation to keep moving forward. He seems to despise his existence. Then he meets Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) and his perspective on life changes.\n\nAfter leaving the colony, Z and Bala need each other to survive everything from fire lines penetrating from a magnifying glass to almost drowning in a single drop of water. When Z is drowning in the water drop, I realized how terrible that would be. There is no swimming, breathing, or living in that situation. However, Bala was there and she cared enough to save him. He definitely needed her at that moment.\n\nThen we have Weaver (Sylvester Stallone) in need of a girl. He trades places with Z so he can meet “worker girls”. He wants companionship and connectedness. By changing positions, he gets a woman and more friends.\n\nGeneral Mandible (Gene Hackman) needs to rid himself of the old colony so he can start a new one. That is why he sends “the Queen’s finest” out to fight the termites. He wants them to fall so no one can fight back against his destructive plan.\n\nPhoto from The Big Picture Review.\n\nHowever, I do not think Mandible thought very hard about how he was going to build a new colony. He wants to drown all the workers at the “Tunnel Opening Ceremonies”. He wants to “rid the filth”, but how is he going to create a new colony without any workers to dig and build a structure for their home?\n\nAll these characters need someone. They need a change in their lives. Some prosper after the change, and some simply drown in their own ambition.\n\nThis film definitely addresses a lot of political and social movements. A presentation walks you through some of the different concepts associated with this film.\n\nThis film can be looked at through how Z effects society and class, too.\n\nThanks for reading! See you next week!"
