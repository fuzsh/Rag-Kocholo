        "text": "Before Shrek became the face for Dreamworks Animation, and changed the game in terms of animated family entertainment, there was a little film in 1998 that kickstarted the brand, and that movie was called “Antz“. When people talk about this movie, it is usually brought up alongside A Bugs’ Life, as both movies came out the same year, and had similar themes. But they could not be any more different. While A Bugs’ Life appealed mostly to children and featured a whole slew of bugs in their fight against the grasshopper clan, Antz was more adult-centered and mostly dealt with a colony of ants as they tried to deal with the roles they have been given in their little society. In a way, both movies seem to have been forgotten about as both Pixar and Dreamworks have been filling their animation slate and trying to get families to come to their movies. I happened to see both movies with my parents in theaters, and while I ended up loving both movies, I mostly preferred A Bugs’ Life due to its colorful and entertaining characters. While something felt off about Antz. If it wasn’t its edgy darkness, or adult content, it was the uncanny facial features of the ants. Watching it again recently made me realize that it was a much better movie than I had given it credit for, and I could not help but want to write about it in the hopes that it would finally get the remembrance it deserves.\n\nIn case you never heard of it, or even forgot it existed, Antz tells the story of a neurotic worker ant named Z-4195, or Z for short (Voiced by Woody Allen) as he struggles to cope with the role he has been given in life. During a meeting with his therapist, he talks about his personal life, his childhood, and how insignificant he feels due to said role (and not just because he’s voiced by Allen, who is prone to playing extremely neurotic characters), to which his therapist agrees. The life of an ant is divided into two categories: Workers and soldiers; the workers dig tunnels all day, while soldiers serve under the rule of the ruthless General Mandible (Voice of Gene Hackman), who sees all ants as puny and insignificant beings. As an ant, you are literally born into one of those two categories, and whatever is given to you, you have to do for the rest of your life; it’s no wonder Z sees his life as mundane.\n\nDuring a night out at the bar to drown his sorrows, with some help from his best friend, a soldier named Weaver (Voiced by Sylvester Stallone), he meets and falls in love with Princess Bala (Voiced by Sharon Stone), who is also seeking to escape her life i.e. one that involves being expected to provide a bunch of larvae every 10 seconds as the successor to her mother, the Queen (Voiced by Anne Bancroft). This chance meeting causes Z to switch places with Weaver, so he can get closer to the princess by serving in the army against a group of acid-spewing termites. Though, he becomes the only survivor and ends up getting closer to the princess. Once he is found out as a worker, Z pretends to take Bala hostage, and they get sent out of the anthill and into the world, where they reluctantly have to work together to get back home. Their journey also leads them to Insectopia, a sanctuary for insects to live their wildest dreams.\n\nAntz plays like a romantic-adventure-comedy where a meet-cute happens between two opposites, who find each other annoying, yet learn to like each other through a journey, eventually falling in love. Under the surface, Antz is a lot more clever than a movie with human-faced ants had any right to be. Its commentary on class and social standards mixed with an anti-totalitarian message made me think a myrmecologist (ant scientist) read too much dystopian fiction (Mainly Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and the works of Ayn Rand) and decided to end the night with a couple of Woody Allen movies. While A Bugs’ Life uses the same type of message in its storytelling, Antz does so in a way that feels witty, adult, and grounded. Just the idea of a group of ants living in a monotonous cycle of work and/or service is brilliant. Another thing that struck me on rewatch is exactly how non-kid friendly Antz really is. Sure, I already figured with the language scattered throughout, but there is a level of darkness with its violence; ants getting decimated either by acid-spewing termites or a child’s magnifying glass, a wasp dying by fly-swatter, etc. How my parents didn’t have a problem with me watching it at four years old is beyond me. Not that these scenes bothered me much, but it really amazes me how it was passed off as a family movie.\n\nWith all that being said, Antz was really ahead of its time in terms of family entertainment. While Shrek made Dreamworks Animation a household name, it was Antz that proved that animation could be more edgy while still being something that children could enjoy. Along with this, and The Prince of Egypt which came out the same year, Dreamworks proved to be a formidable foe for Disney for years to come!"
