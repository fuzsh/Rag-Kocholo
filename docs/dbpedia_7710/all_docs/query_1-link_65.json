        "text": "UNOFFICIAL TYPING by chipmunkfanno1love\n\nIntroverted Feeling (Fi): Z is an extremely individualistic ant, who is desperate to be able to truly express himself and attend to his own needs, which is practically impossible in his totalitarian colony. Z is hurt at being considered insignificant, but he doesn’t outwardly say so. Any attempts he makes to fit in appear forced, and are simply to keep out of trouble. He is unaffected by others disagreeing with his views and ideas (see Ne), and doesn’t look for much affirmation from others (although he wishes they would show more care for him and his needs). While Z’s reckless behavior may make him appear rather selfish at times, deep down he has a heart of gold. He is greatly affected by the death of his friend, Barbatus (of whom he holds much gratitude for saving his life), in the termite/ant massacre, and holds his words of advice to “think for yourself” close to his heart. He uses this as his life motto, of which he uses to influence the colony, as he believes passionately that this statement is necessary and true for everyone, as well as himself. He’s usually correct in his assessments of others, as he instantly recognizes that Mandible is a “…raving lunatic” after hearing his ruthless totalitarian speech, and his view of him only worsens after he sees the results of the leader’s cruel dictatorship (see Si). Only once he is able to make his own choices does he become happier and develop a more positive attitude towards his life in the colony (see Si). Z also shows himself to be quite a romantic, as shown when he falls in love with Princess Bala at first sight, of which he expresses more through his actions, e.g. singing \"Almost Like Being in Love\" to himself during work, going back to the colony to save her, and attempting earlier when she’s caught on the gum of somebody’s shoe, etc.\n\nExtroverted Intuition (Ne): Z is correctly called “an ant with ideas”, of which he has endless supply of. Though he knows his ideas are logically flawed, such as the chance that he could land the hand of Princess Bala, or the possibility the legendary Insectopia exists, he still remains determined to act upon ideas, desperate to find his place in life (see Fi). Although he originally believes that Insectopia is that “better place” he is looking for, he eventually finds himself happily settling into his old life in the colony (Si) with Bala, but only because it changed for the better, and because he chose it (Fi). He’s very good at improvising (e.g. tricking the guards into letting him past by acting completely nonchalant, and ignoring their attempts to order him around), and thinks mostly on his feet. He tends to use metaphors in his speech, such as referring to the war between the ants and termites as a “…massacre upon a massacre”.\n\nIntroverted Sensing (Si): A lot of Z’s insecurities are related to his sad and (as he states) “rather anxious” childhood. Everything, from his mother’s neglect to his father’s abandonment, have severely made a bad impact on Z’s weak self-esteem. Though, to a small degree, he does treasure some things about his past, such as his friendship with Weaver, who was born “two seconds after him”. He has a very good memory of all the events in his life, and uses his terrific memory as evidence of how corrupt General Mandible and his leadership is (e.g. the ant termite massacre, etc.). He uses his memory of the drunken patron Grebs’ story for the journey to Insectopia, recognizing places he mentioned, like the Monolith and the lake, as evidence that Insectopia exists (Si), to further influence his stronger Ne.\n\n“Yeah, well, I happen to have it on a very reliable source *clears throat*. Or should I say, uh…a drunken raving source, but the point is, I’m convinced the place definitely exists”.\n\nExtroverted Thinking (Te): Despite being Z’s weakest function, it’s one that he often uses. He constantly questions “the gung-ho super organism” system of the colony, and often does so out loud, which often makes others and even himself consider that he “thinks too much.” His extroverted thinking is very blunt and critical, as shown when Azteca (an Fe-Ti user) makes a gesture towards the colony in reference to who and what all their work is for, and he takes it at face value by calling it “a giant hole in the ground”. At the start of the film, he uses his Te as a rather unhealthy way of expressing his frustration at the way things are in the colony, but by the end of the film, he learns to use it in a more healthy way, as shown when he organizes the workers to form a ladder (Si-Te) to escape drowning.\n\nNote: This is my first typing, so I’m a little unconfident in fleshing it out by each function. I’m very thankful to Rose for all the help she’s given me regarding my typing, though. I did consider INTP for a little while, as I thought his pessimistic attitude may be inferior Fe, although to me, his passionate individualism seems more Fi to me, and plus, since he acts more on his feelings rather than logic, it suggests his Fi is dominant. I did even consider ENFP, due to how talkative he is, but after hearing of his fear of crowds and tight spaces, plus the fact that he seems comfortable in his own company, suggests strongly to me that he is an introvert"
