DEVELOPMENT AND EFFECTIVE TEAM\n\nIn the movie each ant is expected to take their place in the system and serve the greater good of the colony, sacrificing their time, energy, and even their lives. There are three central characters in the film: Z, Princess Bala, and the evil General Vandible. Z is the main character, and he is a disgruntled worker ant desperate to find his individual significance in the midst of a social system that focuses solely on the good of the colony. He dreams of a better place and longs to go in search of \"Insectopia\" where you can \"be your own ant\". An interesting theme of the movie is how the ants have very similar qualities that of humans.\n\nIn the movie \"Antz\" the ants posses very many qualities which are similar, and some the same as humans. The first quality that is similar to humans, is that the ants all try to work themselves to the top of the ant colony, this is one quality that the character Z has more then the others. Another quality that the ants have to live by which is they live and follow instructions by one controller. The ants also posses many similar human characteristics. They also show similar emotions that us humans show. The ants in the movie also posses the same actions, and there is great similarity to their interaction with each other, as us humans have. These qualities are all clearly shown throughout the whole movie, and are very much similar, and some are exactly the same as human qualities. As we all know, a humans dream in general, it to get to the top of their succes\n\nIllustrates types of work, worker relationships, and supervisory behavior. Explain\n\nusing an example from the movie.\n\nDreamWorks Pistures, Antz, is an animated comedy that explores the work behavior\n\nof an organization that presents itself as a colony of ants. Here, Z, a pessimistic worker ant is\n\nexpected to be a pert of a colony. His big dilemma is his desire for personal advancement. Z\n\ndoes not understand the idea of a gung-ho super organism. According to Dictionary,\n\nback in World War II the Chinese phrase literally meant to work together with cooperative\n\nspirits especially during combat. In Z’s world, thinking of oneself is considered unethical\n\nbecause the colony comes first. He mentions how dinging dirt is not his idea of a rewarding\n\ncareer but his friends, Azteca and Weaver, would disagree. They find dinging tunnels is\n\neverything they could every dream of. The infatuation with the idea of being part of a greater\n\ncolony is what motivates them to work with.\n\nThere are certain work environments with unwritten rules of behavior that people, in\n\nthis case ants, that must follow in order to work effectively. This is what is considered an\n\norganization norm. For example, the norm a soldier ant is to fight in a time of war and a\n\nworker ant is expected to be productive when it comes to making their colony greater. Even\n\nthe royals\n\nThere are certain work environments with unwritten rules of behavior that people, in this case ants, that must follow in order to work effectively. This is what is considered an organizational norm. For example, the norm for a soldier ant is to fight in a time of war and a worker ant is expected to be productive when it comes to making their colony greater. Even the royals are expected to take part in bettering the colony. The queen reminds Princess Bala that everyone has their place even if they do not like their job. In this film, the colony as a whole is seen as a work group. This means that a collection of individuals come together to collaborate and share similar goals relating to the job. In the colony, millions of ants interact and share the same task goal: to make the colony bigger and better. The workers and the soldiers are seen as individual teams. Three characteristics must be met in order for a team to stand out from a work group.\n\nThe first one states that the group tasks must be affiliated with one another. These tasks are also organized. Secondly, each member must have a specific goal assigned to them. Lastly, for a team to be effective all members must carry out common objectives. Both teams are interdependent and coordinated with a specific goal of accomplishing objectives assigned to each ant. Each ant may have their own role but they strive for a brighter future. For instance, affiliation and organization within a job are met in the scene where the tunnel was being built, the audience can see that each ant had a different job classification such as soldiers, supervisors, diggers, and as Z likes to call himself a soil relocation engineer. The way they have specific jobs makes the whole process of building a colony an organized system. These jobs come with goals to either protect and fight for the colony or to build the colony In the case of the soldiers, their main goal was to fight when necessary.\n\nThe scene where Colonel Cutter is impressed by the tunnel acknowledges the point that one tiny ant may not be strong or be able to do much but when many ants form a team they can do great things and that is something General Mandible has a hard time realizing. The idea of group cohesiveness. Group cohesiveness is the sum of forces attracting group members and keeping the group together (Spector, P. p. 284). Of course this requires motivation and commitment to stay in the group, which is probably why Z could not hold on to the ball. His motivation to reach the ultimate goal of a better colony was simply not there.\n\nBesides that, a conflict happens during the scene where the colony are digging the\n\ntunnel. The order to dig the tunnel which comes from General Mandible is not right as it will\n\nflood them. Z tries to stop the work. However, General Mandible who is a higher-up doesn’t\n\nwant to hear anything from him and ignore the advice (storming stage). As the interaction\n\nbetween the leader and the workers are not that good, it will eventually affect the system (the\n\ncolony) as the leader (General Mandible) ignores the talk from the worker (Z), it causes the\n\nflood to the colony because of his own act (He slams the digging tool that causes a hole and\n\nfinally let the water in and flood happens."
