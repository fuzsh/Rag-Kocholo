Start at the introduction.)\n\nhttps://inkandpaintzoology.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/introduction-animals-and-animation/\n\nHooray for first review!! Let’s kick things off with a bang.\n\nI knew reviewing the DreamWorks films will probably be one of the more arduous tasks I will preform on this blog, so I figured it would be best I start here. Thankfully, in keeping with the theme I want to give this blog, DreamWorks’ first animated film does star anthropomorphic animals; insects to be specific.\n\nBefore I get started, I would like to show you guys exactly how I plan on reviewing these films. I will critique the movie in five categories; Story, Characters, Animation, Cast, and Personal Enjoyment. Each category will be judged on a scale from 1 to 100, and I will average out the scores to give my final verdict. However, when the film deals with anthropomorphic characters, I will also add a section titled Animal Characterization; in which I examine how the character’s species affects how he/she is portrayed and personified. This won’t factor into the overall score, but it will instead give me a chance to discuss how species can effect characterization. Now, let’s get started!\n\nThe story has been reiterated on the Internet so many times it almost seems pointless to bring it up again. But for those of you who don’t know the story behind this film’s creation, here’s the Cliffs Notes version of it.\n\n1. Jeffrey Katzenberg, former chairman of The Walt Disney Company, decides he hates the place and goes off to make his own animation company.\n\n2. An idea for a movie about bugs floated around in the studio, and no one can decide whether the idea belonged to Disney or Jeffrey. So the two companies focused all their effort into seeing who can release their own CGI animated bug film first.\n\n3. Disney releases A Bugs Life, DreamWorks releases Antz. They still hate each other.\n\nSo yeah, Jeffrey basically set up DreamWorks animation to be the anti-Disney, doing everything in the exact opposite way Disney would do it. While A Bugs Life is bright, colorful, and certainly family friendly; Antz has a very muted color tone (composed mostly in shades of brown) and it’s position as a family film is somewhat dubious. Sure, it has a PG rating, but this was back in the day when a PG rating actually meant something!\n\nAnyway, let’s get into it.\n\nStory\n\nZ-4195 (or just Z for short), is a jaded worker ant who has lost all sense of individuality in a colony full of order takers and feels life has become nothing more than a meaningless cycle. This all changes when he meets the princess of the colony named Bala and his lust for her gives him some meaning in his life. He tries to meet up with her by switching places with a soldier and sneaking into the army during a briefing. However, in the process he is accidentally sent to war. Out of shear coincidence he is the only one to survive the battle and is lauded back home as a hero. Unfortunately, it doesn’t take much time for his charade to fall apart in front of him; and in trying to cover his tracks he accidentally gets hims himself and Bala thrown out of the ant hill and in doing so get’s charged with kidnapping the princess. Z takes this opportunity to escape his oppressive home and find a fabled paradise called Insectopia. Meanwhile, his story begins to spread throughout the colony, and the other ants begin to realize they don’t have to always follow orders. This new revolution upsets General Mandible, who is trying to use his position of power to rid the colony of the supposed ‘weaker’ worker ants.\n\nThe story is certainly a lot heavier than most animated films at the time, especially in comparison to it’s Disney counterpart A Bugs Life. Most animated films at the time had a simple, black and white set of morals. This movie certainly has a lot more grays, and the film plays out more like an adult drama in a fantasy setting. Z deals with a lot of adult problems that only those in the working force can really relate to; not really the kind of stuff you expect in an animated general audience film. Z suffers with self identity, and wishes for a more fulfilling life than simply following the same orders every day until he dies. Anyone caught in a menial dead end job they absolutely hate can certainly relate to this.\n\nCreating an animated film with such an adult narrative was certainly a risk for DreamWorks, and definitely keeps in line with them being the Anti-Disney and deviating from the then established Disney formula. Still, the movie does take some pretty expected narrative turns. The villainous plot from General Mandible is pretty obvious from the get go, but to be honest, I don’t really expect villainous subtly in a mainstream animated film. When I do get it, great! But an obvious villain doesn’t kill a movie for me, and I still think Mandible is an intimidating and effective antagonist.\n\nI’m going to give the story of this movie a 75 out of 100.\n\nCharacters\n\nZ is a neurotic worker who longs to express himself as an individual.He lives in a society that he feels only uses him as a pawn for some ‘greater good’ that he can’t get behind. Although many audience members may be able to sympathize with his identity crisis, and for the most part that aspect of him is handled rather well, sometimes he comes off more whiny than anything. I’m pretty sure I’ve heard some of his exact complaints about society on a teenager’s Tumblr post complaining about the ‘oppressive’ system simply because he doesn’t want to grow up. This may have been deliberate, however, as the character does come to an interesting compromise at the end when he realizes the importance of both individuality and working together. So in the end, I do enjoy his character and his development.\n\nPrincess Bala starts out as the fairly typical princess who wants more in life than the sheltered royalty she’s been cursed with (oh boo hoo). After escaping her home one day for a night clubbing she meets Z and totally leads him on. But when Z returns later in the film to see her again (right after he’d been through hell and back) she totally treats him like dirt and constantly reminds him she’s ‘out of [his] league’.\n\nYeah, the main problem with Bala is that through most of the movie she’s just so unlikable. Even in the beginning when she’s talking about how she wants more in life it comes off more as complaining than striving for achievement. I mean sure, she’s being forced to marry the homicidal maniac of a general this colony has, so her problems may be a bit more justified. And yes, as the film goes on and she begins warming up to Z’s awkward charm she certainly gets better, I still can’t like her as much as her Disney/Pixar counterpart Princess Atta.\n\nEven though Atta found Flik annoying at first, she never came off as snobbish or rude as Bala does. Plus Atta has a much more defined personality (a neurotic perfectionist), while sometimes I can only define Bala’s character type as ‘princess’. Still, I’ve seen worse princess characters than Bala in the past and she certainly doesn’t kill the movie for me.\n\nGeneral Mandible is the colonies totalitarian military commander and serves as the main antagonist of the movie. His evil scheme is to kill as the weaker worker ants and start again with a new colony composed of the physically stronger soldier ants. Although he’s a pretty obvious villain and his evil plan has been played out several time before in film (and unfortunately in real life as well), I still find him to be an effective antagonist. He’s smart, manipulative, and incredibly intimidating. It’s cool to see a villain who’s both imposing mentally and physically, which is somewhat rare when you think about it. Sure, we’ve seen villains with this type of ideology before, but I think the film plays it out well enough that most people wouldn’t care.\n\nWeaver is Z’s soldier friend. He plays a somewhat typical ‘best friend’ role but it’s certainly done well. Despite being a big shot soldier, he’s not a jerk and certainly isn’t ashamed of his friendship with Z. He’s a tad bit of a show off, but in the end he’s always willing to sacrifice himself to do the right thing (and not in a preachy way either). He’s actually a pretty admirable character, and certainly isn’t the stereotypical meat head buff guy you normally see this type of character portrayed as. He still has a brain inside there.\n\nMost of the other supporting characters are basically smaller roles and don’t have a lot of development, but they’re still worth mentioning. We have Azteca, a female worker ant and friend of Z.\n\nShe’s a tough, no nonsense kind of girl but done in a way that isn’t annoying. Personally, I think she would make a better love interest for Z than Bala, but in the end she goes with Weaver. Still, I guess it’s good to see a guy and a girl character be friends and not necessarily be love interests, which is actually somewhat rare in movies.\n\nWe’ve also got Colonel Cutter, Mandible’s second in command. He basically plays the role of the redemptive bad guy who discovers the error of his ways so that we can have a contrast to the main villain who doesn’t learn his lesson. Not much more to him really.\n\nWe’ve also got Barbatus, an old soldier who despite only having limited screen time seems to be fondly remembered by fans of the film. He takes on the ‘cool old man’ archetype and takes Z under his wing when he’s accidentally shipped off to war. I certainly see why everyone likes him, as he has this fearless yet humorous attitude about him. He may have had only a small role, but it was certainly a memorable one.\n\nThe characters, for the most part, where a lot more dynamic than in other animated films at the time. Even when they were playing typical film archetypes, they still felt like real people simply because of their dialogue and the way they interacted with each other (you know, despite being ants). Still, some characters are better realized than others, and the main leads Z and Bala certainly have their annoying moments. But in the end, these characters still kept me invested.\n\nI give the characters of this film and 80 out of 100.\n\nAnimation\n\nFor the studio’s first attempt at a full length CGI film and for being the second computer animated film released, I think the animation still holds up really good. The lighting and textures are still very impressive, and the movie certainly has a distinct look that separates it from other CG films at the time (specifically Pixar’s). While A Bug’s Life has a lot of bright, vibrant colors; the color palate of this film is much more earthy and naturalistic (compare the bright blue and purple ants of A Bugs Life to the the brown and rusty ants of this film).\n\nStill, compared to later CG, the animation hasn’t held up immensely well. I think the biggest problem may be the faces of the characters, which were modeled to look like the actors who play them. In the end, they may look a bit too human-like and they sometimes fall into the uncanny valley. Because of that attempt at realism, the faces also don’t emote as well as the characters from A Bugs Life, which had more stylized faces but were much more expressive. I’ve heard some people straight up call this film ugly because of the stylistic direction it took, but that may have been only because most people were used to the more child friendly designs Disney and Pixar have given us. I think the grittier design choices reflect well on the film’s more adult themes, and I feel the only drawback may be on the facial animations.\n\nI give the animation of this film a 75 out of 100.\n\nCast\n\nDreamWorks has become famous for their tendency to over stuff their movies with as much celebrity talent as they can, and this film is definitely no exception. Many animation fans have criticized the company for doing this, as they feel it takes away jobs from professional voice actors who do this kind of work for a living. Personally, I’m a huge fan of professional VA’s, and I’m always glad to see them get leading roles in mainstream animated films. That being said, I’m not totally against the idea of celebrities starring in such movies. But if you’re going to cast a celebrity to voice your character, ask yourself two things: (1) Does this actor bring something to the character that no one else could? (2) Does the character itself bring out the strengths and quirks this actor is known to have or does it challenge the actor to do something different (any one of those things is good BTW)? If the celebrity can bring something to the table that no one else could, if he can use his strengths as an actor to better realize the character, or if he can use this character do do something different than he’s done before, then by all means cast him. But if you’re just adding him in simply for the name, than it really becomes obvious and it can come off as pandering to the audience. How does the cast of this film hold up? Let’s see.\n\nWoody Allen voices Z, and if you know the typical Woody Allen shtick (a neurotic philosopher chasing after a girl out of his league) then you know the casting is pretty spot on. Then again, if you’ve seen a lot of Woody Allen movies before you probably won’t be able to look past the fact that this is just Woody Allen as an ant. Still, Woody brings a lot of his trademark humor to the role (he even had a part rewriting dialogue in the script to better suit his comedic style) and I can certainly tell they tailored it just for him (I did here somewhere that he hated the voice over process because he had to recite his lines over and over; he found the task so tedious he vowed never to do another animated film ever again. Apparently he kept that promise).\n\nSharon Stone voices Princess Bala. She pulls off the role adequately enough, but there’s nothing about it that’s very noteworthy. She plays it pretty straight, adding nothing to the character any other actress couldn’t do. She’s not terrible per se, it’s just an average performance.\n\nGene Hackman voices General Mandible, and although he doesn’t give a very subtle or nuanced performance, it’s still certainly an effective one. He’s tough, boisterous, but can also show off moments of great cunning and intellect. He’s also one of the few performances that doesn’t make it obvious that a known actor is playing the role (unless you’ve seen a lot of Gene Hackman films, which admittedly I have not) and you can see him more as a character than a performance. With what the actor had to work with, I think he pulls it off well.\n\nSylvester Stallone plays Weaver…\n\n…as if you couldn’t tell just by looking at him.\n\nI’ve never considered Stallone a brilliant actor, but surprisingly he elevates this character into being something much more than he could have been. He could have been just a stereotypical macho man, even the stereotypical macho man with a heart of gold. But something about him seems more genuine than the above archetypes. Most characters like him always seem to be hiding something; they put up a tough front but inside they’re really sweet and/or intuitive. Weaver wears it all on his sleeve, you know immediately that he’s tough and a bit of a show off but he’s still a good and smart guy. I think that makes him more genuine, making him feel like an actual person as opposed to a Hollywood archetype. And surprisingly, I have to hand it to Stallone for bringing that out.\n\nJennifer Lopez plays Azteca, Z’s feisty co worker and friend. She plays the tough and sassy role pretty well, and it does work with what the actress is known for,but nothing about it is very memorable. She’s good, just nothing to write home about.\n\nChristopher Walken plays Colonel Cutter in probably the oddest casting choice of the film. Walken is known for his quirky and over the top roles, so you would think he could bring out something interesting in this character. But disappointingly, he plays the character fairly straight. No quirks, no one liners, nothing really remarkable at all. Sure, it’s certainly a different kind of role than he is usually offered, but I don’t ever want to walk out of a movie and say the Christopher Walken performance was the most boring one out of the movie. That just feels like blasphemy.\n\nFinally, Danny Glover plays Barbatus. Now, I’ve never seen a Danny Glover role I didn’t like. He just has an ability to elevate a character to the point of being memorable even if originally he wasn’t all that remarkable. Danny adds his trademark charisma and charm to the role, as well as making the character sound genuinely rugged and capable. No wonder he became a stand out character.\n\nThe cast here is a bit of a mixed bag, with some actors elevating their characters to new heights while others seem content to play it safe/straight. Still, I think there’s enough here to like and overall this is an impressive ensemble.\n\nI’ll give the cast of this film an 85 out of 100.\n\nPersonal Enjoyment\n\nLike I said before, DreamWorks was basically founded so Jeffrey Katzenberg could make animated films that Disney wouldn’t allow him to make. Because of this, Antz does a lot of things that were basically unheard of in animated ‘family’ films at the time. Disney films strove not to get a PG rating at the time, but DreamWorks aimed for that kind of audience. Disney didn’t allow non religious swearing (hell and damned were allowed to slip in every once and a while, but always in a religious context), but Dreamworks broke that boundary completely. A couple dozen times characters say words and phrases that would make a conservative parent showing this film to their 4 year old kids slightly gasp (I saw this movie when I was little, and I certainly learned a lot of new words I could repeat in inappropriate and inopportune occasions).\n\nAnother way it differs from other animated films at the time is the way it portrays it’s moral. Even though the villain itself is an obvious black and white antagonist, the characters themselves hold a lot of grays in their values. This makes them feel realistic and certainly adds some depth. Even the film’s ultimate lesson isn’t portrayed in extremes like most good vs evil narratives are. Z spends the entire movie complaining about the oppressive system and longing for a way to express himself. People who relate to Z’s plight may feel like he is completely in the right, especially when they see how corrupt the ant political system is. But in the end, Z and the entire colony realize that individuality is important, but when people work together great things can be accomplished. It’s all about balance. That is a refreshingly mature moral that no other mainstream animated film at the time really had.\n\nI personally found a lot to like about in this movie. I’m going to give my personal enjoyment of the film a 90 out of 100.\n\nAnimal Characterization\n\nOne of the refreshing things about this movie is that the insects are actually shown to scale. If you look at the characters in A Bugs Life, you can see the characters are more or less similarly sized.\n\nBut if you’ve seen an ant compared to an insect like a grasshopper or mantis, you know they look absolutely gargantuan in comparison. This movie takes advantage of that fact by making the ants the smallest things in their environment. This gives an impressive amount of scale to the movie, and shows how a simple four step walk for a human is an arduous journey for out main characters.\n\nAnts being portrayed in a totalitarian society is nothing new, and us projecting our political and military images onto the creatures is certainly an old comparison (where do you think the term ‘army ant’ came from?). But this movie is a more adult deconstruction of the image, with the characters actually engaging in political corruption and militaristic Darwinism. Certainly an interesting spin on an old analogy.\n\nThe movie also presents us with an interesting case of species racism. A couple of wasp characters (voiced by Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin) make a brief appearance in the film. These characters view themselves as somewhat high cultured compared to other bugs because they can fly. When the male wasp notices Z and Bala, he negatively describes them as ‘crawling insects’. He even goes as far to refer to them as ‘Euro-trash’ when Bala remarks that she is a princess (that moment was priceless BTW). His wife, on the other hand, portrays a different form of racism (if you could call it that). She’s the kind of person who wants to help those less fortunate than her, but in doing so she condescends to them anyway. She speaks in slow, disjointed words to make sure they can understand her, and overall behaves like the person who does work to help minorities but believes they would all kill each other or starve to death if she doesn’t come to save the day. Still, she isn’t portrayed overtly negatively, and all that talking down to them was probably just a result of ignorance. It’s still pretty sad to see her bite the dust (oh yeah, spoilers).\n\nThe entire film almost seems to be a deconstruction of the consequences animals having human intellect and societies would have. It pulls apart the idea of adding human characteristics to little cartoon animals to a more negative extreme, showing the insects with some of the more negative traits humans as a species have. Oh, we like to think ants run like little armies? Let’s add corruption of military power. Oh, some insects can fly and others can’t? Let’s have that as a grounds for racism!\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nAs a first film for the studio, this movie gives a pretty good idea of the kind of movies to expect from DreamWorks. I certainly feel this is one of their stronger features. It has a mature story, well realized characters, impressive animation, and the ambition to do something different from the then norm. I give this movie and 81 out of 100, a B-.\n\nNow, here’s the real question, which movie do I like better: Antz or A Bugs Life?\n\nWell, despite the many plot parallels, tonally these films are completely different. And in what they are trying to accomplish, I think both films succeed. I certainly like them both, and it really depends on my mood over which movie I prefer. I have more a nostalgic connection with A Bugs Life, but I have grown to appreciate Antz more as I got older. But both are still very strong films in their own right.\n\nThank you so much for attending my first review. More are on the way, so don’t miss out."
