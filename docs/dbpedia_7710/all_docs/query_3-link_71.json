Being that the film is a Dream Works animation, it has a simple and attention grabbing plot that is given to the viewer through the perspective of a hero, and in this context an colony ant worker named Z (Darnell et al., 1998). This peculiar, open-minded ant portrayed several topics related to industrial organizational psychology such as leadership, occupational stress, and job satisfaction. In addition to the prevalent presence of industrial psychology that can be seen in the main character, other characters and details of the plot are representative of industrial psychology as well. Elements such as organizational commitment and employee selection are intriguingly exemplified through this moralistic story of ants (Darnell et al., 1998).\n\nIn the film Antz, the once miserable and dissatisfied protagonist finds bliss and hope in the colony princess, Princess Bala at a worker’s bar. Z leaves the work colony for a day to pursue his newfound love interest by pretending to be a soldier for a day. Unfortunately and unexpectedly, Z is sent into battle during his quest to re connect with Princess Bala (Darnell et al., 1998). However, he turns out to be the only “soldier “ to survive the battle. This results in him seeing the princess again, insulting the General, kidnapping Princess"
