        "text": "Apologies in advANTZ\n\nOK, so it goes without saying that Antz is a classic and timeless film. I'm also willing to say it's probably the best animated film about bugs.\n\nNow, if you're like me there's a scene in particular embedded in your head...\n\n...and that scene is when Z and Princess Bala arrive at what they think is Insectopia.\n\nThey then meet the super bougie couple of wasps, Chip and Muffy...\n\n...and then (spoiler alert) Muffy fucking DIES.\n\nI eventually got over that, but there's one thing in this scene that has plagued me for 18 years!!\n\nAnd it's the BIG ASS UNNECESSARY step this person at the picnic takes.\n\nNow, before you say \"Go home, you're drunk,\" allow me to waste a little more of your valuable time with this analysis.\n\nOK, so check out this super accurate drawing of the picnic I did. Then, take note of the placement of the left foot (LF) and right foot (RF), because WTF?!\n\nThat is one, very large, inhuman step.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking, (other than I have too much time on my hands) \"What if the tablecloth was smaller?\"\n\nNow if you're still thinking, \"That cloth is too small and it's probably somewhere in between those two sizes.\" Quit thinking that.\n\nBecause I'd like to believe that Shaq was having a picnic.\n\nNow, in conclusion, you gotta admit that was a pretty uncomfortable looking step to take right?\n\nShare This Article"
