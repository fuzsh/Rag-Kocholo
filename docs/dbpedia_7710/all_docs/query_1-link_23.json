Undaunted by the colony’s unyielding caste system, Z enlists the aid of his best friend to get the princess. When a remarkable twist of fate turns Z from a common drone into an unlikely hero, he puts a bug in the General’s plan to liquidate the colony and remake it in his own image. Z soon finds himself leading a revolution that becomes a celebration of individuality in the face of conformity. Once the most insignificant of workers, Z may just prove to be the biggest hero of them all.",

        "text": "I have always loved this movie. It is the classic tale of one rising up to lead many. The actors are so well fit for their characters that it is like you are watching a real creature. The animation is spectacular. Some of the scenes look as though you are standing in the middle of an ant colony. The characters move and speak with ease. Pixar did a magnificent job with the story and the animation. I recommend this movie to families everywhere."
