        "text": "In the 90s, Disney was the king of animated movies, their animation studio was in the midst of a second renaissance including such classics as The Little Mermaid, The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, & The Lion King. In the middle of this, they found big success with the world’s first fully computer animated film in Toy Story, created by Pixar, and thus creating a new form of family entertainment.\n\nNaturally, they made a second film in 1998 in the form of A Bug’s Life:\n\nThe film involves a misfit ant, Flik, that is looking for “tough warriors” to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers, only to recruit a group of bugs that turn out to be an inept circus troupe.\n\nIt was a big success and thus Pixar was able to continue making more movies after this and surely, nobody could ever top what Pixar was able to present with A Bug’s Life, right?\n\nWell, one month prior to the release of A Bug’s Life, there was another CG animated insect movie by the name of Antz:\n\nAntz was the debut feature film by Dreamworks Animation, co-run by former Disney animation studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg.\n\nIn an anthill with millions of inhabitants, Z 4195 is a worker ant. Feeling insignificant in a conformity system, he accidentally meets beautiful Princess Bala, who has a similar problem on the other end of the social scale. In order to meet her again, Z switches sides with his soldier friend Weaver – only to become a hero in the course of events. By this he unwillingly crosses the sinister plans of ambitious General Mandible (Bala’s fiancé, by the way), who wants to divide the ant society into a superior, strong race (soldiers) and an inferior, to-be-eliminated race (the workers). But Z and Bala, both unaware of the dangerous situation, try to leave the oppressive system by heading for Insectopia, a place where food paves the streets.\n\nYeah, very similar, don’t you think? Yeah, so did John Lasseter and Disney.\n\nAfter DreamWorks’ acquisition of PDI, Pixar director John Lasseter, Steve Jobs, and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI’s first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz. By this time, Pixar’s project, then similarly called Bugs, was well-known within the animation community. In general, both Antz and A Bug’s Life center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies, who struggles to win a princess’s hand by saving their society. Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Walt Disney Studios lot, where DreamWorks was also located, Lasseter and Andrew Stanton visited Kaztenberg and they discussed their plans for Bugs in detail. Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story, and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. “If this hits, it’s going to be like space movies after Star Wars” for computer-animation companies, he told various friends. “I should have been wary,” Lasseter later recalled. “Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.”\n\nWhen the trades indicated production on Antz, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, Katzenberg confirming it. Katzenberg recalled Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg’s executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. Lasseter would not believe Katzenberg’s story. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was “out to get him” and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg’s fight with Disney. Eisner had decided not to pay Katzenberg his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney’s board not to give him anything. Lasseter grimly relayed the news of Antz to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down.\n\nAt the time, the current Disney studio executives were starting a bitter competitive rivalry with Jeffrey Katzenberg and his new DreamWorks films. In 1995, Katzenberg announced The Prince of Egypt to debut in November 1998 as DreamWorks’ first animated release. A year later, Disney scheduled Bugs to open on the same week, which infuriated Katzenberg. Katzenberg invited Disney executives to DreamWorks to negotiate a release date change for Bugs, to which Disney kept the date unchanged. DreamWorks pushed Prince of Egypt to the Christmas season and the studio planned to not begin full marketing for Antz before their planned first film. Disney afterward announced release dates for films that were going to compete with Egypt. Katzenberg suddenly moved the opening of Antz from March 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar’s release.\n\nDavid Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, “never confirmed”, was that Katzenberg had given PDI “rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have Antz ready first, despite Pixar’s head start”. Jobs furiously called Katzenberg, during the call he explained to Katzenberg that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg said to him that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar’s rescue from near bankruptcy by making the deal for Toy Story with Disney. He suggested that Jobs had enough power with Disney to convince them to change specific plans on their films. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with a final proposition to delay Antz if Disney and Pixar changed the date of Bug’s Life, but Katzenberg denied this later. Jobs believed it was “a blatant extortion attempt”.\n\nAs the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep quiet on Antz and the feud concerning DreamWorks. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed Antz as a “schlock version” of A Bug’s Life. Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen Antz, told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it. Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. “The bad guys rarely win,” Jobs told the Los Angeles Times. In response, DreamWorks’ head of marketing Terry Press suggested, “Steve Jobs should take a pill.” Tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years after the release of both films. According to Jobs, years later Katzenberg came to him after the opening of Shrek. He insisted that he had never heard the pitch for A Bug’s Life, reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so. In the end, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from working in computer animation for years before feature films.\n\nThe final product of both films are generally perceived to contrast one another in tone and certain plot points. Antz in the end seemed to be more geared towards teenagers and adults, featuring moderate violence and death, mild sexual humor, as well as social and political satire. A Bug’s Life was more family-friendly and lighthearted in tone and story. In design they too share noticeable differences, Antz played off real aspects of ants and how they relate to other bugs, like termites and bees, while Bug’s Life offered a more fanciful look at insects to better suit its story. PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek III compared the two films and wrote, “The feud deepened with both teams making accusations and excuses and a release date war ensued. While Antz beat A Bug’s Life to the big screen by two months, the latter film significantly out grossed its predecessor. Rip off or not, Antz’s critical response has proven to be almost exactly as positive as what A Bug’s Life has enjoyed.”\n\nSo, yeah, this was a pretty big deal back then that you had these two competing animated films of the same ideas coming out within a span of two months. A Bug’s Life clearly won the financial war but both movies did very well commercially and critically.\n\nSo, which one was the better film, well, that’s what we’re here to find out, let’s delve into this month’s battle between Antz and A Bug’s Life:\n\nANTZ VS. A BUG’S LIFE\n\nLet’s take a look at who’s the better main character, Flik or Z?\n\nBEST MAIN CHARACTER\n\nIn the movie Antz, Woody Allen plays the voice of Z, an individualistic but meek worker ant.\n\nIn A Bug’s Life, Dave Foley plays the voice of Flik, an ant and inventor.\n\nThere is a little bit of difference between both characters, most of the insects in A Bug’s Life are aware of Flik’s existence but they see him as too much of an individualist and usually causes the most mayhem in the colony.\n\nIn Antz, Z is one of millions of ants down to the point where nobody really knows him too much except for his co-worker ant friend, Azteca (voiced by Jennifer Lopez) and his soldier friend Weaver (voiced by Sylvester Stallone).\n\nIn terms of the better character, it’s a tough call. Z’s character is made up to literally be like Woody Allen, right down to the point where his facial structures and his animation is made to look like Allen. For that, you could make the assumption that Z is the better character because you could see the similarity to Allen the actor.\n\nWith Flik, you could’ve put any actor in that role and it wouldn’t have made a real difference. And also, Flik is seen as kind of a generic character, whose main purpose is, “you know what, we’re tired of this shit we’re taking from grasshoppers, let’s get bigger bugs to come in and kick the snot out of him.” Essentially, Flik basically says “hey, let’s be lazy and get bigger guys to come and punch these guys out.”\n\nIn fact, there’s even a scene where Hopper basically says that the ants have the upper hand over the grasshoppers and if they ever found that out, they’d be fucked. Well, they do eventually find out and of course, they got fucked over. So in a way, Flik basically says the truth. But again, nobody ever figures it out? It took this one guy that everybody hated to finally have the guts to figure out that the ants had the upper hand this whole time.\n\nWith Z, he basically just says, “hey, I really want to see this chick I met at the bar the other night so I’ll convince my soldier friend to switch places with me so I can see her.” And of course, hijinks ensue in which he becomes the only ant to survive a maggot battle and thus, everybody believes that Z kidnapped the princess but it’s a series of unfortunate events that made it seem like that and…they just decide to uprise against the other ants because…of that. Yeah, that doesn’t really make a whole lot of sense there.\n\nSo, who’s the better character? Z or Flik? It’s too close of a call but I have to give it over to Flik, just barely, because he’s the one who seemed to be the most determined and he’s the one who eventually says the honest truth of the situation, even though he fucked up in his plan beforehand, while Z was just in the most selective of situations to be in.\n\nPoint goes to A Bug’s Life.\n\nBEST MAIN CHARACTER WINNER: Flik, A Bug’s Life\n\nBoth movies also have a leading female character too and both of them just so happen to be princesses, let’s take a look at the best female leads:\n\nBEST FEMALE LEAD CHARACTER\n\nIn A Bug’s Life, Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays the voice of Princess Atta, who eventually will become the soon-to-be queen of the colony.\n\nAntz has Sharon Stone as the voice of Princess Bala, daughter of the queen ant.\n\nAgain, we have a really tough call here. Common sense would say, hey go with Atta because she seems to be the one that gives Flik more confidence and understands his situation more but at the same time, she still sees him as somewhat of an outcast.\n\nWith Bala, she could give two shits about Z at first. She literally just picks the most random ant in the entire bar that they are in and it turns out it’s Z and Z just falls for her instantly. So when he shows up as the lone survivor of the maggot battle and the two eventually end up outside of the colony, she wants nothing to do to him whatsoever but slowly but surely, she starts to come around to him and understands the situations he’s in by the end.\n\nAgain, a very tough call but for this one, I will give it to Bala mostly because the progression of here coming around to Z was nicely handled, she understands that he had no idea what he was getting into and at least appreciates him for trying his damndest to get her back to the colony.\n\nWith Atta, she’s not really strict enough to Flik to create that strong of a connection. I thought the chemistry between Z & Bala was handled much better than A Bug’s Life had it.\n\nPoint goes to Antz.\n\nBEST FEMALE LEAD CHARACTER WINNER: Bala, Antz\n\nBut what about the rest of the characters, there’s a ton in the supporting cast to look at so let’s get to it:\n\nBEST SUPPORTING CHARACTERS\n\nAntz’s supporting characters include the previously mentioned Azteca and Weaver but also, Colonel Cutter (Christopher Walken), the Queen (Anne Bancroft), Barbatus (Danny Glover), Chip (Dan Aykroyd), Muffin (Jane Curtin), and Grebs (John Mahoney).\n\nIn A Bug’s Life, the supporting cast includes the Queen (Phyllis Diller), Dot (Hayden Panettierre), Molt (Richard Kind), Slim (David Hyde Pierce), Francis (Denis Leary), Heimlich (Joe Ranft), Rosie (Bonnie Hunt), Dim (Brad Garrett), Manny (Jonathan Harris), Gypsy (Madeline Kahn), and P.T. (John Ratzenberger).\n\nThere’s a lot of characters in these movies and both movies do a good job working them into the main storyline.\n\nIn terms of which one did it better, I would honestly say Antz. Not only did they do a really good job capturing the images of the actors on the ants but the voice actors do a really good job with the material given to them.\n\nBug’s Life has decent characters too but they aren’t quite as memorable as the characters in Antz.\n\nPoint goes again to Antz.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING CHARACTERS WINNER: Antz\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the main antagonists for our films, Hopper and General Mandible:\n\nBEST VILLAIN\n\nHopper is the main villain in A Bug’s Life, voiced by Kevin Spacey, the dictator of the grasshopper gang.\n\nGeneral Mandible is Antz’s main bad guy, voiced by Gene Hackman, the manipulative and deluded supreme commander of the ant military.\n\nFunny how both of the villains are voiced by people who have played Lex Luthor in a Superman live-action film.\n\nBut in terms of the better villain, this one is actually more easier to choose, Hopper clearly has more of a motive and a sneakier plan behind him. Not only is he fully aware of the ants’ capability and does a good job hiding that fact but he’s just much more focused on his evil intentions much more than what the villain in Antz is.\n\nGeneral Manidble, my god, this is a really bland villain. Don’t get me wrong, he’s played very well by Gene Hackman, but his motivation and evil plan really is lame. He basically wants to kill the queen and marry her daughter to take over the colony and…that’s it, that’s his only real plan. He really does not have a motivation behind his plan except “I want to take over.” Yeah, not a whole lot of motivation there dude.\n\nPoint goes to Bug’s Life.\n\nBEST VILLAIN WINNER: Hopper, A Bug’s Life\n\nNow it comes down to who made the better movie, Pixar or Dreamworks, this is the best overall movie:\n\nBEST OVERALL MOVIE\n\nLike I said, Pixar has had more of a proven track record over the years so you’d think they would’ve taken this one easy right? Well, not exactly.\n\nA Bug’s Life is a solid movie, it’s a fun and enjoyable movie, the animation is really nice, the characters are fun to watch, the voice acting is really good, but the story, it’s very predictable. We get those lazy clichés such as the liars revealed among many other things and it really doesn’t do anything new or creative with it. Plus, when you really look at some of the CG animation again on A Bug’s Life, it doesn’t really hold up, specifically the rain, it looks really fake by today’s standards, even the bird in this movie looks a little too fake compared to what Pixar has done today.\n\nWhat I think is the better movie of the two is Antz, because not only is this a strong first film for a rookie animation studio but it had a better story to tell, the animation still holds up, the voice acting is really good, the characters are nicely done, there’s very few clichés in the this, although the liar revealed aspect is in here too, it’s done a little more cleverly than Bug’s Life did it. The movie just comes off much better overall than A Bug’s Life does.\n\nSo, all-in-all, the overall winner of this battle is Dreamworks’ Antz, the superior film.\n\nBEST OVERALL MOVIE WINNER: Antz"
