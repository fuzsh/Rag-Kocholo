        "text": "“I’ve got to believe there’s some place out there that’s better than this.”\n\n-Z\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nCELEBRATING 25 YEARS!\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nOriginal release date: Premiered September 19, 1998 at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nWide release on October 2.\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nHow many of you remember the days of VCDs? They were around before the age of the DVD really began, when discs had enough storage to not only include the movie itself but also interactive menus, bonus content, soundtracks, artwork, mini games and more. Before that, though, we had VCDs. These were playthrough discs with limited storage, meaning most movies came in two or more parts on multiple discs that you had to replace in your player. The danger was that you had to be very careful to put your discs away after each viewing. If you lost one, you were left with watching either the first half or the second half of the movie.\n\nAntz was one of those movies for me. Released in 1998 a mere month ahead of A Bug’s Life, Antz tells the story of Z, an anxious worker ant living in a thriving but strictly conformist military colony. His life is a simple one: get to work digging in the new Mega Tunnel Project with his colleague and friend Azteca and spend his free time with his buddy, a soldier ant named Weaver. Constantly dreaming of more besides his regimented existence, Z one day falls in love with Princess Bala who is fed up with her limited life as a royal ant. Convincing Weaver to switch places with him so he can see Bala again at a military inspection, Z’s act of individualism soon prompts a growing wave of social change and revolutionary thought in the colony. Soon, Z’s experiences culminate in a quest to search for Insectopia, a legendary paradise for bugs of all kinds.\n\nAgain, as with films from the early part of my childhood including A Bug’s Life, I cannot remember the exact time I first watched Antz. It was discovered as a two-parter in the video cabinet underneath the television in my parents’ living room, and we gobbled it up as quick as a whip. At the time, Antz had everything a kid like me could ask for in a movie: nice animation, a romantic sideplot, action scenes, humorous gimmicks, exploration, heroism and themes of teamwork and above all, a great, great soundtrack. Does this sound familiar at all? These are all things that I praised A Bug’s Life for. I’ll do a proper comparison in the podcast episode, but for now, lemme fill out the chart as far as Antz is concerned.\n\nDarn. As soon as I wrote that last sentence I realized how impossible it is for me to talk about the merits of this movie without comparing it to A Bug’s Life. I’ll start at the top. Then, as a kid and now still, as a grownup, one of the first things I recall when I think about Antz is the sarcastic sense of humor. And boy, is it a glorious sense of sarcasm. This movie carries an ever-so-slight semblance of realism as far as resemblances to the human world is concerned, and it makes a point of making jabs at some elements of our lives. For instance, the film opens with Z making a visit to his psychiatrist, and he addresses many things that make humans uneasy. He says: “My mother never had time for me. When you’re the middle child in a family of five million, you don’t get any attention. I mean, how’s it possible?” Nevermind the fact that the psychiatrist he’s speaking to is his brother by dint of being a fellow ant in a colony sired by a single queen, Z continues: “My father was basically a drone like I’ve said, and the guy flew away when I was just a larva.” Z’s sharing ultimately culminates in a declaration that the “system” makes him feel insignificant. His psychiatrist responds by saying “You’ve made a real breakthrough!…You are insignificant.” A short while later, Z returns to work refreshed, determined to keep a positive attitude despite his being utterly insignificant. He is called to be part of a wrecking crew in the mines, and the ants form a wrecking ball with their own bodies, with Z as the one holding it up at the end of a cable also made of ants. Z, after a sigh, acknowledges that he has indeed dropped the ball. In this single scene we see the fact that life in this community is geared towards the collective good, the disregard for the individual, and Z’s impeccable sense of sarcastic humor- in fact, I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if you told me that the entire wrecking ball scene was put together for the sole purpose of cracking that dropped the ball pun.\n\nEven as a kid and more so as I grew up, one of the most interesting things about Antz was the sideplot driven by General Mandible. Ants being insects with a caste system, General Mandible is appropriately a viciously-classist individual who believes that the colony would be far better off without the workers, whom he believes are weak, insignificant and unworthy of the world he is planning to build. To this end he plans to send the army units loyal to the queen to die in a pointless war so he can stage a coup. As a kid I picked that up, and all I could think about was quite a neat plot-driver. That, and we were treated to some of the most horrifying battle scenes in any animated movie that I can think of, which shows soldier ants being chewed up, crushed to death and being dissolved in the acid sprayed at them by the termites’ fontanellar guns. Now, at the time, action scenes involving insects weren’t anything new to me- heck, I first saw Starship Troopers when I was six or seven. In hindsight though- quite immediately, in fact- I was surprised at how mature the film’s approach to storytelling was. Come to think of it, as DreamWorks Animation’s first film, Antz would set a standard going forward that you can recognize almost immediately in Shrek and its sequels, that being a fictional world built on satirical humor and filled with adult-oriented dialog. I’m sure at the time everybody knew that DreamWorks Animation would be here to stay and that they would become arguably the fiercest rival to powerhouses like Disney and emerging players like Pixar.\n\nThat still remains one of the most daring things about Antz. Its dialog is adolescent if not adult on several occasions. The most censor-worthy words are delivered in brisk ways that, I figure, were deliberately designed so that the youngest viewers would miss them. For instance in his very first scene Weaver asks Z almost under his breath, “Come on, what are you bitching about?” Other instances are humorous, like when one bug remarks that her food tastes “like crap,” to which another bug asks for a taste and exclaims that it is crap. As the movie escalates, however, the script stops being subtle. In a display of strength and fury Bala bellows “dammit” while chucking a chair through a window. All this was coupled with the fact that Antz has equal parts appeal towards older viewers as it does for children- a fact that it received high acclaim for- with its all-star voice cast being one of the most notable examples of this. The cast features Woody Allen, Christopher Walken, Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez and Sharon Stone, among a cast of equally-famous names. Their characters’ faces were modeled to resemble them- the instant Colonel Cutter appears onscreen you know it’s Christopher Walken’s voice coming out of that mouth. To this day, Christopher Walken is the actor among the cast whom I am the biggest fan of. I first heard his voice at the movies in Antz and first saw him in the flesh in Balls of Fury. Now, he has been cast as Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV in Dune’s sequel, Dune: Part Two, which is a movie that I absolutely cannot wait to see.\n\nFinally, I’ve come to my still-favorite part of the movie that is its soundtrack, same as A Bug’s Life. This glorious score was written by then up-and-coming composes Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell, two names who would turn big in the decades to come. The two of them would team up again for later films including Chicken Run and the entirety of the Shrek series. Individually, Gregson-Williams would write another one of my favorite movie scores for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and John Powell would give the world the amazing tunes from How to Train Your Dragon (read our reviews for parts 2 and 3!). In Antz, the two of them composed an array of sounds for so many different moods. The film opens with a calm piano tune that is one of the movie’s leitmotifs, and the segue into the title called “The Colony”, my single favorite piece from the soundtrack, plays as we are shown a montage of scenes from the ant colony’s daily life. When the soldier ants march to attack the termite nest, an ominous tune is heard as the insect swarms clash in the dark under the moon. Then we have another of the film’s signatures, “There is a Better Place…”, which plays during a conversation with a drunk soldier at the bar who inspires Z to set out on his journey to find Insectopia. I’ve carried these tunes with me all my life, and I know I will be passing them onto my younger friends and my own children one day.\n\nI’m feeling very conscious of my word limit here and am still itching about things I haven’t said. That’s what we have the podcast for. Tune in for the next episode of At the Movies Extras, coming soon to any device from which you can access the Internet!
