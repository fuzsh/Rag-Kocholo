Start at the introduction.)\n\nhttps://inkandpaintzoology.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/introduction-animals-and-animation/\n\nHey guys! After a kind of long hiatus on both of my blogs I have finally come back with some more regular content. This will be another recurring segment on this blog, ‘Ink & Paint Zoology’; where I review animated films with animal main characters. The first one I will be reviewing is arguably one of the most popular of this genre: The Lion King!\n\nI think some people forget just how big this movie was in its hay day. Back in the 90’s The Lion King was literally EVERYWHERE! The movie was a massive hit; the highest grossing animated movie of its time, and was a critical darling. The merchandise was everywhere, you couldn’t go anywhere without seeing something with Simba or Timon and Pumbaa plastered onto it. Spin offs were produced, the movie was constantly talked about years after it’s release, and if you had kids (and even if you didn’t) the music was INESCAPABLE!!! And with all this praise and attention, people would start to more closely analyze the movie and see it’s faults and plot holes. Suddenly a huge legion of people then sounded off claiming that The Lion King is an overrated monopolized cash cow and {INSERT FAVORITE DISNEY FILM HERE} deserves so much more attention.\n\nDon’t you see?\n\nLion King was Frozen before Frozen.\n\nYou mean to tell me there was a time before Frozen?\n\nSo, is this movie as good as the fans say? Is it as bad as the naysayers say? Let’s take a look.\n\nStory\n\nSimba is the son of the great king Mufasa, a lion who rules over a part of the African savanna known as the Pride Lands. Simba is eager to take his fathers place one day, but unbeknownst to him his uncle Scar is planning on getting rid of both Simba and his father so the throne can go to him. Scar is successful in killing Mufasa (I know that is a pretty major spoiler, but come on, everyone has seen Lion King by this point) and Simba is forced into exile. Upon doing so he meets up with the infamous meerkat/warthog duo Timon and Pumbaa, who raise Simba in a carefree environment free of responsibility. However, when Simba becomes and adult he must learn to face his responsibility head on and take his place as the rightful ruler of the Pride Lands and save the savanna from Scar’s rule.\n\nThe story of The Lion King is a classic ‘coming of age’ heroes journey tale. A young man must grow into his adult responsibility and while doing so he accomplishes something great. It is a tried and true storyline that has been around nearly as long as people have been telling stories. There are hints of the biblical Moses in the story, as well as the Prodigal Son. and of course, it is well known that this movie takes many story beats from Hamlet (although the final film bares little resemblance to the actual play than earlier production originally planned). Despite that, The Lion King tells a story that still stands on it’s own. The movie creates a world that is visually unlike anything movie goers had ever seen, a world both colorful and dangerous, fantastical yet realistic. And it completely sucked audiences in.\n\nThat being said, there are a few problems in terms of plot and coherent storytelling, which I will touch upon a bit more as we go along. However, the story itself is timeless, wonderfully executed, and identifiable for people of all ages. I’m going to give this film’s story an 80 out of 100.\n\nCharacters\n\nSimba as a cub is optimistic and well meaning if not as bit naive and mischievous. He looks into his future with anticipation, but completely collapses when the world starts to turn on him. I personally think that Simba is an incredibly well written kid character. His character could have easily been written as a product of the times, but I think Simba’s general attitude accurately reflects that of a kid that spans multiple generations. Simba could be a kid from any era, not just the 90’s. Simba can bee reckless and impulsive, but he’s still not a bad kid. And it’s not done in that cliche ‘jerk with a heart of gold’ way either. Real kids can do stupid things, but that doesn’t make them inherently bad. Simba reacts to situations like I think any real kid would, and that makes him both empathetic and identifiable.\n\nBy the time we see Simba as an adult, he has undergone quite a change. His viewpoint of the world has been altered, and has become by all intents and purposes a hippy. He has been raised by the philosophy that bad things are going to happen so there is no use worrying about them. however, he must learn to take on responsibility in order to save his home land from his nefarious uncle.\n\nI will admit, Simba to me isn’t nearly as compelling of a character as an adult than he is as a child. He does kind of lose some of his quote unquote ‘personality’, but that doesn’t necessarily make him boring. He still goes through a compelling story arch and faces challenges that we can all relate to. But I don’t know if I can really describe Simba’s personality. Still, that doesn’t make him a bad character. Most of the second half of the movie is him trying to move the plot along, so there’s not a lot of time for character defining antics. He’s really just sort of your everyman type of hero who is meant to be an analogue for members of the audience who must also face challenges as they gain responsibility in their adulthood. And in that respect he does a fantastic job.\n\nNow, Mufasa has been granted the title of ‘Greatest Dad in Animation’, and I have to say that this reputation is not without merit. There is a reason why his death is so remembered and traumatizing.\n\nSpoilers. I know.\n\nThe worst part about his death was the fact that we got to know Mufasa beforehand as a character. We knew his and Simba’s relationship together. They interacted, and their relationship felt real. Heck, Mufasa almost felt like a main character in the beginning of the movie, which was one of the reasons his death was so surprising.\n\nMufasa is shown as a capable and pragmatic ruler, who always seems to know the right thing to do. He’s also shown as a capable fighter, with strength matched only by his bravery. In short, Mufasa represents an idealistic authority figure, which many may argue makes for a boring character. But Mufasa is more than that. We do know he has weaknesses. His heart to heart with Simba after he had to save him from the hyena’s showed just how scared he was in that situation. It gave him so much more dimension than just being the always right king. That scene also paints Mufasa as a realistic father figure. The relationship between him and Simba feel real, which makes it all the more painful when he passes away.\n\nScar, the main villain of the film, longs to be king but knows he doesn’t have a chance at the throne unless he gets both Mufasa and Simba out of the way. And surprisingly, he mostly succeeds in his plans. He manages to kill Mufasa, get Simba out of the picture, and remains the king for probably a few years after that.\n\nScar is often cited as one of the all time greatest Disney villains, and there is certainly a lot to like about him. He’s crafty, charismatic, and just oozes with spite; just like every great Disney villain should.\n\nHowever, I’m not going to lie and say that Scar somewhat loses some of his charm once he gains the throne, and he kind of comes off as more petty than threatening toward the end. But he still has a silver tongue that gets him out of situations, and proves to still be an effective antagonist all the way to the end.\n\nStrangely enough, Scar on the internet has gained a lot of supporters, and he is a frequent victim of ‘Draco in Leather Pants’ syndrome. What is that you may ask? It’s a fan term used when a villainous or detestable character has fans that paint him as merely misunderstood or even in the right, playing up his good characteristics but ignoring the truly terrible things the character may have done. This also leads to a lot of artwork of the character portrayed as rather….attractive.\n\nUm, OK….\n\nTimon and Pumbaa are the infamous meerkat/warthog duo and serve as the designated comic relief of the movie. They find Simba at the lowest point of his life and decide to take him in; indoctrinating him to the easy going philosophy of ‘Hakuna Matata’, an actual African phrase that means no worries.\n\nSome people have really started to pick apart these characters in recent years as being the actual reason for the conflict of the story. They see them as the ones who teach Simba to run away from his problems, and in the end he has to get rid of that mind set in order to fulfill his duties. And since those same people usually also find them to be annoying, they see the characters as having no redeeming value.\n\nI’m going to go out and say that these guys don’t deserve nearly as much hate as they’ve been getting recently. Yes, they may have taught Simba a philosophy that may have been detrimental at the end, but for the longest time they actually raised him like any parents would. It wasn’t like three friends hanging out at the beginning, they were legitimate parents for those first few years as the film The Lion King 1 1/2 shows us.\n\nThat is the face of a parent who has had enough.\n\nNot only that, but these guys did provide Simba the only happiness he could find after seeing his father die and getting exiled from his home. These two saved him, and gave him a hope for a better life. If they never came, Simba probably would have died. And then the Pride Lands really wouldn’t have any hope.\n\nAnd yes, they are kid appeal characters. They make corny jokes and act hyperactive. What do you expect, it’s a Disney movie. I personally think we could have done a lot worse.\n\nCase in point.\n\nAnd here we have Rafiki, otherwise known as ‘my favorite freakin’ character in the whole dang movie’. It’s an official title. Rafiki is a….um….\n\n….mandrill…?\n\n…baboon…?\n\n….ape hybrid of some sort?\n\nOK, so Rafiki doesn’t look like any known primate on the planet, but shares features from several different species. Early concept art shows that the character was originally going to look much more like an actual baboon you would find on the African savanna.\n\nSome point later in production it was decided he would look more like a mandrill, probably because the facial markings resembled traditional African body paint and Rafiki was given the role of a wise and traditional soothsayer. He was later given long arms like a chimpanzee or an orangutan, probably to make his animation swinging through trees much more lively.\n\nAnyway, let’s talk about the actual character. Like I said in the previous paragraph. Rafiki is a wise sort of spiritual leader in the Pride Lands. He can be crazy and cooky, but in the end has an undeniable wisdom. He’s kind of the Yoda of this movie.\n\nYou see, in you he lives…\n\nRafiki fits the classic mentor archetype, but also serves as almost a surrogate father figure after Mufasa’s death. He actually kick starts Simba’s actions into finally owning up to his responsibility.\n\nRafiki has proven to be a very popular character; with his wisdom, humor, and all around likability resonating extremely well with audiences. In fact, people love him so much that even though he’s a monkey voiced by a black guy with a heavy African accent nobody seems to care even in this overly sensitive Tumblr society we live in.\n\nThis guy has gotten more flack, and he’s voiced by a white guy.\n\nNala serves as Simba’s childhood friend and eventual adult love interest.As a kid she’s feisty and tomboyish, a pretty good match to Simba’s own personality. As an adult she matures quite a bit, in reality a lot more than Simba. After Scar takes over the Pride Lands she leaves in order to find help and comes across Simba. She also tries to convince Simba to take care of his responsibility, but her pleas fall on deaf ears.\n\nI’ll admit, even though she has an active and necessary role in the film, there isn’t much to adult Nala’s personality. She kind of falls into the same trap as Simba, she just kind of becomes generically good. Another thing holding her back is the fact that her romance with Simba is focused on a lot more than her personality in the latter half of the film. Now, this isn’t a bad thing, and the love between her and Simba does feel genuine, it just gives us less time to know Nala as a person…I mean lion. But like Simba, she is in no way bad, and her relationship with Simba does give us one of the greatest love songs Disney has ever made.\n\nAs well as this face.\n\nUm, should I cover the children’s eyes?\n\nZazu serves as the Pride Lands’ adviser, and thankfully for once the king’s adviser isn’t evil!\n\nI’m looking at you, Jafar!\n\nBut he is British, so we can’t escape all the cliches.\n\nFunny thing, as a kid I thought Zazu was supposed to be a toucan, which made me so mad because I knew toucans didn’t live in Africa. It bugged me every time I saw the movie until I found out he was supposed to be a hornbill, a bird native to Africa.\n\nI couldn’t have been the only one though, right?\n\nZazu doesn’t have too much impact on the actual plot of the movie, and mostly serves as secondary comic relief. That being said, I do find him to be genuinely entertaining, and he often does add a bit of levity to scenes when they need it, so I will say that I do believe his role in the film was necessary.\n\nThe hyenas Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed serves as secondary villains and comic relief to the movie. The work under the bidding of Scar and are rewarded for their services by making a home in the fertile Pride Lands. Under Mufasa’s reign, they resided in the Elephant Graveyard, and were ran off the land if they ever entered Mufasa’s territory.\n\nNow, these characters have led to a bit of controversy on the interwebs. There are those people who like to over analyze Disney movies looking for sinister agendas hidden in the plot lines. Some people see the hyena’s of this movie as an example of pro segregation. They see the hyena’s as being an oppressed race forced to live in the desolate Elephant Graveyard, being chased off if they ever enter the Pride Lands. But once Scar becomes King they ruin the land and it can only be saved once the hyena’s leave. It doesn’t help that the two main hyenas a voiced by actors of black and Hispanic descent.\n\nNow, I can see why people would come to this conclusion, but I highly doubt that the people behind this film did any of this intentionally.I could see what they were going for, but I’ll get into that later in my Animal Characterization and Personal Enjoyment segment. Meanwhile, how are the characters themselves? Well, the hyenas are memorable for being both good comic relief and threatening villains, with character traits that make them both goofball underlings to the main villain but also competent antagonists in their own right. They are incredibly versatile characters. One moment you can be laughing at their antics…\n\n…and the next moment you can be actually terrified by them.\n\nI think that’s what makes them such good and memorable characters. They play several story and character functions, fully deliver on all of them, and none of the time does it feel forced. They can be funny, they can be threatening, they can be dumb, but they can also be smart. And it all just works.\n\nThe characters of this movie have become Disney icons in their own right, with their very silhouettes being recognizable to people all around the world. They are all classic, even if a few seem a bit one note. Still, there isn’t a person in the world that doesn’t adore at least ONE of these characters, unless you just really really hate this movie. I’m giving the characters of this film an 89 out of 100.\n\nAnimation\n\nEven those who can’t get behind the story and characters of The Lion King can’t deny that this movie delivers visually. Disney has been the on the top of the animation game for decades now, and it has many films in it’s library that are a testament to that fact. Fantasia, Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Tarzan, Tangled, and so many others come to mind when people think of great Disney animation. But still, Lion King still seems to be the one that pops up first when the subject is brought up. Why is that?\n\nWell, many Disney films are known for bring a fantastical world to life, or at least a very exaggerated world. The Lion King is notable for animating a much more naturalistic world, creating a land that actually exists and not make a caricature of it. Landscapes are animated realistically, and the animals are designed fairly anatomically correct. The film also uses a very intense color palette.The greens of the grassland, the blue of the sky, the oranges and reds of the sunrise, it all just pops out of the screen. Yet, the colors still look very naturalistic, and they are never used in a way that looks out of place, but instead used to amplify the mood and feel of a scene/environment.\n\nCharacter animation is also very impressive. Characters are animated fluidly and expressively, and each character has a recognizable personality in the way they move. It’s all very impressive, and it’s hard to imagine that this film was animated by Disney’s so called ‘B’ Team of animators, while the A Team worked on Pocahontas. Both films have very impressive animation, but this one still seems to top it.\n\nThat being said, one of the few complaints I hear from people about good Disney animation is the fact that it looks too polished, too clean, and too generic. Although Lion King looks very different from other films in the Disney library, if you aren’t a fan of that style I don’t think this movie will win you over. Still, the animation in this film just blows me away, and I can’t help but give it a very high score. I give the animation of this movie a 95 out of 100.\n\nCast\n\nMatthew Broderick voices adult Simba. To some, it may seem weird that the soft spoken voice this actor is known for would be a good fit to play a lion, but I say for the most part it really works. Now, it has been really popular to harp on this man’s acting ability, with the opinion of a certain critic of nostalgia being quite popular on the interwebs not to mention some of the less than stellar movies this guy has been a part of, but I honestly never had a problem with his performance as Simba or really any of Matthew’s performances. His softer voice is great when Simba feels somewhat unsure of himself, but he can still perform when Simba begins to act more seriously.\n\nJonathan Taylor Thomas plays young Simba, and I don’t think any would disagree when I say that JTT was the quintessential 90’s kid. But like I said before, he plays Simba like he could be a kid from any era, which is an incredibly hard thing to do. He gives a suitably youthful and energetic performance, but is surprisingly effective when the character goes through rougher moments. When Simba’s being scolded by Mufasa, his regret sounds genuine. When Simba goes through depression, you believe it. And man, does he really sell the crying scene in Mufasa’s death. Long and short of it, JTT did a wonderful job.\n\nJames Earl Jones plays Mufasa in one of his most beloved and memorable roles as an actor.\n\nAnd that’s saying something.\n\nJames was cast because it was said that his voice already kind of sounds like a lion’s roar, and that’s as good of a reason as I could come up with. James is completely perfect for the role. His voice is deep and regal, but it never sounds forced. He can play a competent ruler but also a sort of goofy dad. Since James’ voice is just naturally awesome, he can play the role in whatever way the script wants.\n\nYou need him to be scary?\n\nHe can do that.\n\nHow about nurturing and caring?\n\nHe can do that too.\n\nAbsolutely bonkers?\n\n….\n\nJeremy Irons plays Scar, and of course we can’t have the villain and have it not be British. Joking aside, Jeremy was the perfect choice for this character. He just oozes so much personality, and it all comes out in the performance. He is very threatening, but can also come off as a bit goofy at times, but in a good way. I think the appropriate term is ‘hammy’.\n\nOr maybe even ‘flamboyant’.\n\nYes, Irons chews the scenery, but it his highly entertaining. And like I said, he can be very scary too. I think the best Disney villains are always a little over the top, but when they need to be threatening they fully deliver. Maleficent was this, Jafar was this, Dr. Facilier was this, and Scar is this in spades.\n\nNathan Lane and Ernie Sabella play Timon and Pumbaa, respectively. These two actors have worked together before, and as such share a quite believable onscreen comradery. They originally auditioned for different roles, and the directors brought them together read for hyenas. In the end the worked off each other so well that they were cast as Timon and Pumbaa. And yes, probably the most enjoyable part of the characters Timon and Pumbaa is the fact that they feel like close companions. And the fact that the two are both great comic actors also helps the characters feel more natural.\n\nRobert Guillaume plays Rafiki, and in my personal opinion he gives probably the best vocal performance in the movie. Not only does Robert give the character’s voice believable age and wisdom, he can also go super crazy and wild. The inflections in some of Rafiki’s lines are incredible, and Robert makes it all completely believable. His performance as Rafiki is so energetic, yet when he needs to he can tone it down a bit. You can tell he has a lot of fun with the character, and it’s hard to see anyone else in the role. Robert just gave it the perfect amount of energy and intelligence.\n\nLet’s see how Khary Paton takes up the mantle.\n\nMoira Kelly voices Nala, and all in all I say she does a good job. To be honest, she’s nothing spectacular, but don’t take that as a negative criticism. I only think a performance is spectacular if I simply can’t imagine another actor playing the role. I can’t see anyone but James Earl Jones playing Mufasa, or Jeremy Irons playing Scar, or Robert Guillaume playing Rafiki. Kelly is fine, she just doesn’t bring anything that I think another actress couldn’t bring. Still, she puts forth a fine effort. She sounds suitably sweet and caring, but also pulls off the scenes when she needs to tell off Simba and make him get off his lazy bum.\n\nRowan Atkinson plays Zazu. Strangely enough, I’ve heard that the casting guys for this movie asked pretty much every popular British comedian if they wanted to play the part, but all of them were either too busy or simply turned the role down. So Rowan basically got the part out of necessity. That being said, I think they got the perfect choice. Rowan does sound suitably snooty and for lack of a better word British, but he doesn’t come off as completely uptight. Thanks to Rowan’s fairly goofy comedy background, he also brings a bit of levity to the character, so he’s not always a stuffy higher up. That could have made the character rather boring, but thankfully Rowan gave Zazu the much needed energy the character needed.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jim Cummings voice the hyenas Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Whoopi and Cheech, being pretty popular comedic actors at the time, obviously play the humorous aspects of the characters very well. But like I said before, the hyenas were simultaneously hilarious and terrifying, and the actors did a great job at capturing both aspects of the characters.\n\nJim Cummings, the voice of Ed, is a well known cartoon voice actor who has brought characters such as Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Darkwing Duck, Ray the Dragonfly, and many many others. Sure, all Ed does is laugh maniacally, but that takes a lot more effort than you may realize. Killer on your vocal cords. Not only that, but Ed also reminds me of one of Jim’s other iconic roles…\n\nI guess Jim is just really good at babbling like an idiot. In a good way.\n\nAnyway, many of the actors in this movie were absolutely perfectly cast, to the point where I can’t imagine anyone else playing the characters. There were some better than others though, and I think it’s kind of bad that the lead characters’ actor and his love interest are some of the less interesting performances in the movie, but for the most part this cast has gone on to be iconic. I’ll give the cast of this movie a 90 out of 100.\n\nPersonal Enjoyment\n\nNow this is truly the part where I talk about what I think truly works in this movie, what doesn’t, and the things that I think some people are taking way out of hand. First off, I’ll talk about the things I really love about this movie.\n\nThe first thing is obviously the animation, the characters, and the cast, but I’ve already gushed about them. But really, I think my absolute favorite thing about this movie is the music. Or in layman’s terms: OH MY GOD THE MUSIC!!!!!\n\nI think the music in this movie is the absolute greatest score in the entire Disney library, and perhaps my favorite score in any movie. I love each and every song in this film, but there only the icing on the cake. But for now, let’s talk about those infamous musical numbers.\n\nThe Circle of Life is probably the most perfect opening to any film ever. Everything about it is just chill inducing, and really sets the tone for the epic film we are about to experience. It is true cinematic art.\n\nI Just Can’t Wait To Be King is an incredibly catchy fun romp of a song that has great visuals and a great beat. It is gorgeous to look at an fun to listen to.\n\nBe Prepared is a quintessential Disney villain song, and is lauded by many to be the greatest villain song of them all. It has an incredibly dark tone but also has unique moments that make it sound more like uptempo pop, making this strange mixture of dark and light. Yet, it really works, as it fits Scar’s personality of being both hateful and a bit flamboyant. But in the end, it crescendos into utter villainous chaos, and is gorgeous to behold.\n\nHakuna Matata is probably the most famous song from The Lion King, and perhaps the most divisive. Some see it as a delightfully catchy tune that brings a touch of cheerfulness after the horrible tragedy we had just witnessed, while others find the song extremely annoying and over-saturated. Back in the 90’s during The Lion King’s heyday, this song was everywhere. Kids would constantly sing it, Disney would constantly push it on the masses, if you didn’t like it there was no escape. It was the Let It Go of the 90’s, and it would have been much worse if the internet was more of a thing back then.\n\nOverplayed power ballad or overplayed kid appeal song. Take your pick.\n\nBut personally, I like the song. It’s catchy, lighthearted, and bouncy in just the way I like. And really, the film needed something like this after the darkness that preceded it. I will admit, I have a hard time watching the sequence with someone who I know is annoyed by it, and I would much rather listen to the song on my own.\n\nThe final song of the film is Can You Feel The Love Tonight, and it is wonderful. It’s sweet, heartfelt, and wonderfully composed. It has truly made a place as the best love song ever in a Disney movie.\n\nMan, all the songs in this movie are amazing! If they aren’t catchy and fun then they’re powerful and chill inducing. They cover such a broad spectrum of emotions, which is exactly what a musical should do. It also helps the songs were composed by one of my favorite musical artists of all time.\n\nElton John, every song of yours drifts me into euphoria.\n\nYet even though I genuinely love every song in the movie, the songs sung by the characters aren’t my favorite musical aspect of the film. No, that honor goes to some of the other members of the musical team behind this film and one of my other favorite musical artists of all time.\n\nHans freakin’ Zimmer!\n\nHans Zimmer has provided the score to many Hollywood films including The Pirates of the Caribbean, Man of Steel, The Dark Knight, The Prince of Egypt, and many others. And although I adore his work in all those films, I think The Lion King displays some of his best work ever. Seriously, I can listen to the score of this movie all day. Take a listen for yourself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY46TpPsL4M\n\nIt’s exceedingly powerful and breathtaking, and every time I listen to the score I get goosebumps. But really, the score would be nothing without Lebo M, a South African musical artist who provided the African chanting in the movie. Yes, including the beginning line from the Circle of Life, which he improvised on the spot.\n\nYes, that one.\n\nWithout Lebo M and his choir, the film wouldn’t have had quite the authentic sound that it does (although Lebo M and his team are singing in Zulu, and based on the names and locations shown in the film it probably should have been Swahili. Of course, the film was originally supposed to be set in the Kalahari, which would have made sense for Zulu, but the final film shows MT. Kilimanjaro, which obviously means it now takes place in either Kenya or Tanzania).\n\nBut now that I’ve gushed about the things I liked, what about the things in the film that don’t work as well? Like I’ve said before, there is a group of people who think this movie is overrated or even think the movie is outright bad. There are several reasons for this, and I’ll go through some of the more popular ones.\n\nIt is well known by now that many claim that The Lion King completely ripped off or at least took inspiration from the popular Japanese anime Kimba the White Lion, and there are certainly some similarities. Many characters from The Lion King look and behave remarkably similarly to characters from Kimba, but I think it should be noted that the plots are are completely different and the only real parallels are in character design and personalities.\n\nDespite what people say, I don’t think Disney intended to rip off this series. Disney itself claims the similarities are coincidences, but most people would just see that as the cogs of a multi billion dollar corporation trying to cover their tracks. The directors, however, claim they never heard of the show until the movie was just about to be released. I’m more inclined to take their word for it, but why should I? They could have been told by Disney to deny everything pertaining to the controversy. Well, the reason I take their word for it is because early versions of the film were completely different, with different personalities and different characters and even different animals used in the story, and a lot of these early story ideas looked nothing like Kimba the White Lion. If Disney wanted to make something like Kimba from the start, it would have been more apparent in the older stuff. Maybe some of the crew added stuff to the story inspired from Kimba without the director’s or the higher up’s knowledge, but then it wouldn’t have been deliberate. And if you think this is all some cover up from Disney to cover their tracks for making a movie based on something that isn’t theirs, really, why would they? Do you really think this happened?\n\nDisney: Hmm, I like this movie your making, but put stuff in it that kind of looks like this cartoon from Japan from the sixties.\n\nLion King Filmmakers: Um OK….why?\n\nDisney: Because WE’RE EVIL!!!! MWAHAHAHA!!!!\n\nReally, what do they have to gain?\n\nOf course, there are also people who don’t like the movie all that much because the film’s any plot holes are just too much for them to enjoy. And yes, the film has many many plot holes, with the most notable one being at the end. When Scar gains control over the Pride Lands, why does the land suddenly dry up. What did he do that was so bad that the entire land was turned basically uninhabitable? Was it because he brought the hyenas, because that brings in some unfortunate implications on its own. But then when Simba comes, it begins to rain and the land is brought back to it’s former glory. So was the drought natural then and beyond Scar’s control. Was the only bad thing Scar did was force the pride to stay even though there wasn’t any food? But would that have been the right call because the drought would have ended that night even if Simba never came?\n\nAnd this is all just one plot hole out of many!\n\nBut then again, this is a Disney movie, and events in Disney movies are often dictated by emotion, not logic. Thew land is in ruin because the film wants you to feel hopeless, and the rain and fertility comes back in the end because the film wants you to feel triumphant. It doesn’t make any logical sense, but the movie gives you what you want as an audience member. And yes, that does feel manipulative, but it’s all to give you an emotional experience. And the reason this film has remained so popular after all these years is because it is an emotional experience.\n\nOf course, one of the biggest complaints toward this movie is the idea that it’s portrayal of the hyenas have unfortunate implications and may even be downright racist. It is shown that the hyenas make their home in the Elephant Graveyard, a place much less green than the Pride Lands. It is also shown that Mufasa would chase off any hyena that entered the Pride Lands. This have given some the idea that Mufasa oppresses the hyenas into living in the ‘ghetto’ of the elephant graveyard. What makes things worse is that when the hyenas enter the Pride Lands once Scar takes over the entire land is ruined.\n\nThey lowered the property values.\n\nAnd on top of allllll that, the two main hyenas are voiced by an African American actress and a Hispanic actor, and the other one acts like a blubbering idiot. As you can see, the charges against this film on this point are piling up. But I highly doubt any of this was intentional, or that Disney or it’s filmmakers have some race hating agenda.\n\nFirst of all, I don’t think the hyenas are really oppressed into living in the Elephant Graveyard, I think that’s their actual territory. The Pride Lands aren’t infinite, and the area of Mufasa’s rule may just end there. It’s shown that the hyenas have the same rights on their land as Mufasa has on his; when young Simba says they can’t do anything to him, Zazu mentions they can because it’s their land. And the reason Mufasa runs them off from his land is because he’s simply protecting his territory like real lions or any leader would do. Besides, don’t hyenas eat baby lions anyway?\n\nAs for casting a black actress and Hispanic actor to play the main hyenas I’m sure was just coincidence, as Cheech Marin and Whoopi Goldberg where both popular comic actors at the time. As for the end where the hyenas seemingly ruin the land, I’ll just chalk that up to Disney films appealing to emotion over logic.\n\nWith all that being said, I still find so much to like about this film. It’s look, it’s atmosphere, it’s music, it’s characters, I just can’t help myself. I’m giving my personal enjoyment a 95 out of 100.\n\nAnimal Characterization\n\nThe Lion King takes full advantage of the idea that lions are the king of their domain and then runs full speed with that idea. The lions are depicted as running an actual monarchy, with a lineage that continues the kings rule and the animals living on the savanna serving as their ‘subjects’. In fact, the lions seem to be on top of an actual governmental system, and it’s in their hands that the ‘Circle of Life’ continues as it normally would. I think it’s a really interesting take on the ‘king of the jungle’ idea lions are usually associated with, and I can’t think of another piece of media that depicts it in quite this way.\n\nOf course, this movie also plays up the known rivalry that lions and hyenas have as competing predators. However, in the movie it is quite exaggerated and played in the lion’s favor. In real life lions and hyenas are both very effective predators and have a pretty equal playing field. So then, why do the hyenas make obvious villains? Well, hyenas are often thought of as scavengers, even though they hunt live prey just as much as lions and lions scavenge just as much as hyenas. Because of that misconception, hyenas are often thought of as dirty and thieves. Lions for the most part are depicted as noble hunters, much more kingly than the conniving hyenas. So when your movie stars royal lions, hyenas being the villains does make logical sense when putting animal stereotypes to mind. That being said nature is never that black and white.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nSo, does the Lion King deserve all the love it gets? Well, I can see why something that is so overexposed may be tedious to some, but personally I still absolutely love this film. It’s beautiful, epic, fun, and all around exemplifies what Disney should be: quality entertainment for the entire family. For me, The Lion King gets a 90 out of 100; an A+.\n\n(This blog is not for profit. All copyrighted images belong to their respective owners and are used for review. New to the blog? Start at the introduction.)\n\nhttps://inkandpaintzoology.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/introduction-animals-and-animation/\n\nHooray for first review!! Let’s kick things off with a bang.\n\nI knew reviewing the DreamWorks films will probably be one of the more arduous tasks I will preform on this blog, so I figured it would be best I start here. Thankfully, in keeping with the theme I want to give this blog, DreamWorks’ first animated film does star anthropomorphic animals; insects to be specific.\n\nBefore I get started, I would like to show you guys exactly how I plan on reviewing these films. I will critique the movie in five categories; Story, Characters, Animation, Cast, and Personal Enjoyment. Each category will be judged on a scale from 1 to 100, and I will average out the scores to give my final verdict. However, when the film deals with anthropomorphic characters, I will also add a section titled Animal Characterization; in which I examine how the character’s species affects how he/she is portrayed and personified. This won’t factor into the overall score, but it will instead give me a chance to discuss how species can effect characterization. Now, let’s get started!\n\nThe story has been reiterated on the Internet so many times it almost seems pointless to bring it up again. But for those of you who don’t know the story behind this film’s creation, here’s the Cliffs Notes version of it.\n\n1. Jeffrey Katzenberg, former chairman of The Walt Disney Company, decides he hates the place and goes off to make his own animation company.\n\n2. An idea for a movie about bugs floated around in the studio, and no one can decide whether the idea belonged to Disney or Jeffrey. So the two companies focused all their effort into seeing who can release their own CGI animated bug film first.\n\n3. Disney releases A Bugs Life, DreamWorks releases Antz. They still hate each other.\n\nSo yeah, Jeffrey basically set up DreamWorks animation to be the anti-Disney, doing everything in the exact opposite way Disney would do it. While A Bugs Life is bright, colorful, and certainly family friendly; Antz has a very muted color tone (composed mostly in shades of brown) and it’s position as a family film is somewhat dubious. Sure, it has a PG rating, but this was back in the day when a PG rating actually meant something!\n\nAnyway, let’s get into it.\n\nStory\n\nZ-4195 (or just Z for short), is a jaded worker ant who has lost all sense of individuality in a colony full of order takers and feels life has become nothing more than a meaningless cycle. This all changes when he meets the princess of the colony named Bala and his lust for her gives him some meaning in his life. He tries to meet up with her by switching places with a soldier and sneaking into the army during a briefing. However, in the process he is accidentally sent to war. Out of shear coincidence he is the only one to survive the battle and is lauded back home as a hero. Unfortunately, it doesn’t take much time for his charade to fall apart in front of him; and in trying to cover his tracks he accidentally gets hims himself and Bala thrown out of the ant hill and in doing so get’s charged with kidnapping the princess. Z takes this opportunity to escape his oppressive home and find a fabled paradise called Insectopia. Meanwhile, his story begins to spread throughout the colony, and the other ants begin to realize they don’t have to always follow orders. This new revolution upsets General Mandible, who is trying to use his position of power to rid the colony of the supposed ‘weaker’ worker ants.\n\nThe story is certainly a lot heavier than most animated films at the time, especially in comparison to it’s Disney counterpart A Bugs Life. Most animated films at the time had a simple, black and white set of morals. This movie certainly has a lot more grays, and the film plays out more like an adult drama in a fantasy setting. Z deals with a lot of adult problems that only those in the working force can really relate to; not really the kind of stuff you expect in an animated general audience film. Z suffers with self identity, and wishes for a more fulfilling life than simply following the same orders every day until he dies. Anyone caught in a menial dead end job they absolutely hate can certainly relate to this.\n\nCreating an animated film with such an adult narrative was certainly a risk for DreamWorks, and definitely keeps in line with them being the Anti-Disney and deviating from the then established Disney formula. Still, the movie does take some pretty expected narrative turns. The villainous plot from General Mandible is pretty obvious from the get go, but to be honest, I don’t really expect villainous subtly in a mainstream animated film. When I do get it, great! But an obvious villain doesn’t kill a movie for me, and I still think Mandible is an intimidating and effective antagonist.\n\nI’m going to give the story of this movie a 75 out of 100.\n\nCharacters\n\nZ is a neurotic worker who longs to express himself as an individual.He lives in a society that he feels only uses him as a pawn for some ‘greater good’ that he can’t get behind. Although many audience members may be able to sympathize with his identity crisis, and for the most part that aspect of him is handled rather well, sometimes he comes off more whiny than anything. I’m pretty sure I’ve heard some of his exact complaints about society on a teenager’s Tumblr post complaining about the ‘oppressive’ system simply because he doesn’t want to grow up. This may have been deliberate, however, as the character does come to an interesting compromise at the end when he realizes the importance of both individuality and working together. So in the end, I do enjoy his character and his development.\n\nPrincess Bala starts out as the fairly typical princess who wants more in life than the sheltered royalty she’s been cursed with (oh boo hoo). After escaping her home one day for a night clubbing she meets Z and totally leads him on. But when Z returns later in the film to see her again (right after he’d been through hell and back) she totally treats him like dirt and constantly reminds him she’s ‘out of [his] league’.\n\nYeah, the main problem with Bala is that through most of the movie she’s just so unlikable. Even in the beginning when she’s talking about how she wants more in life it comes off more as complaining than striving for achievement. I mean sure, she’s being forced to marry the homicidal maniac of a general this colony has, so her problems may be a bit more justified. And yes, as the film goes on and she begins warming up to Z’s awkward charm she certainly gets better, I still can’t like her as much as her Disney/Pixar counterpart Princess Atta.\n\nEven though Atta found Flik annoying at first, she never came off as snobbish or rude as Bala does. Plus Atta has a much more defined personality (a neurotic perfectionist), while sometimes I can only define Bala’s character type as ‘princess’. Still, I’ve seen worse princess characters than Bala in the past and she certainly doesn’t kill the movie for me.\n\nGeneral Mandible is the colonies totalitarian military commander and serves as the main antagonist of the movie. His evil scheme is to kill as the weaker worker ants and start again with a new colony composed of the physically stronger soldier ants. Although he’s a pretty obvious villain and his evil plan has been played out several time before in film (and unfortunately in real life as well), I still find him to be an effective antagonist. He’s smart, manipulative, and incredibly intimidating. It’s cool to see a villain who’s both imposing mentally and physically, which is somewhat rare when you think about it. Sure, we’ve seen villains with this type of ideology before, but I think the film plays it out well enough that most people wouldn’t care.\n\nWeaver is Z’s soldier friend. He plays a somewhat typical ‘best friend’ role but it’s certainly done well. Despite being a big shot soldier, he’s not a jerk and certainly isn’t ashamed of his friendship with Z. He’s a tad bit of a show off, but in the end he’s always willing to sacrifice himself to do the right thing (and not in a preachy way either). He’s actually a pretty admirable character, and certainly isn’t the stereotypical meat head buff guy you normally see this type of character portrayed as. He still has a brain inside there.\n\nMost of the other supporting characters are basically smaller roles and don’t have a lot of development, but they’re still worth mentioning. We have Azteca, a female worker ant and friend of Z.\n\nShe’s a tough, no nonsense kind of girl but done in a way that isn’t annoying. Personally, I think she would make a better love interest for Z than Bala, but in the end she goes with Weaver. Still, I guess it’s good to see a guy and a girl character be friends and not necessarily be love interests, which is actually somewhat rare in movies.\n\nWe’ve also got Colonel Cutter, Mandible’s second in command. He basically plays the role of the redemptive bad guy who discovers the error of his ways so that we can have a contrast to the main villain who doesn’t learn his lesson. Not much more to him really.\n\nWe’ve also got Barbatus, an old soldier who despite only having limited screen time seems to be fondly remembered by fans of the film. He takes on the ‘cool old man’ archetype and takes Z under his wing when he’s accidentally shipped off to war. I certainly see why everyone likes him, as he has this fearless yet humorous attitude about him. He may have had only a small role, but it was certainly a memorable one.\n\nThe characters, for the most part, where a lot more dynamic than in other animated films at the time. Even when they were playing typical film archetypes, they still felt like real people simply because of their dialogue and the way they interacted with each other (you know, despite being ants). Still, some characters are better realized than others, and the main leads Z and Bala certainly have their annoying moments. But in the end, these characters still kept me invested.\n\nI give the characters of this film and 80 out of 100.\n\nAnimation\n\nFor the studio’s first attempt at a full length CGI film and for being the second computer animated film released, I think the animation still holds up really good. The lighting and textures are still very impressive, and the movie certainly has a distinct look that separates it from other CG films at the time (specifically Pixar’s). While A Bug’s Life has a lot of bright, vibrant colors; the color palate of this film is much more earthy and naturalistic (compare the bright blue and purple ants of A Bugs Life to the the brown and rusty ants of this film).\n\nStill, compared to later CG, the animation hasn’t held up immensely well. I think the biggest problem may be the faces of the characters, which were modeled to look like the actors who play them. In the end, they may look a bit too human-like and they sometimes fall into the uncanny valley. Because of that attempt at realism, the faces also don’t emote as well as the characters from A Bugs Life, which had more stylized faces but were much more expressive. I’ve heard some people straight up call this film ugly because of the stylistic direction it took, but that may have been only because most people were used to the more child friendly designs Disney and Pixar have given us. I think the grittier design choices reflect well on the film’s more adult themes, and I feel the only drawback may be on the facial animations.\n\nI give the animation of this film a 75 out of 100.\n\nCast\n\nDreamWorks has become famous for their tendency to over stuff their movies with as much celebrity talent as they can, and this film is definitely no exception. Many animation fans have criticized the company for doing this, as they feel it takes away jobs from professional voice actors who do this kind of work for a living. Personally, I’m a huge fan of professional VA’s, and I’m always glad to see them get leading roles in mainstream animated films. That being said, I’m not totally against the idea of celebrities starring in such movies. But if you’re going to cast a celebrity to voice your character, ask yourself two things: (1) Does this actor bring something to the character that no one else could? (2) Does the character itself bring out the strengths and quirks this actor is known to have or does it challenge the actor to do something different (any one of those things is good BTW)? If the celebrity can bring something to the table that no one else could, if he can use his strengths as an actor to better realize the character, or if he can use this character do do something different than he’s done before, then by all means cast him. But if you’re just adding him in simply for the name, than it really becomes obvious and it can come off as pandering to the audience. How does the cast of this film hold up? Let’s see.\n\nWoody Allen voices Z, and if you know the typical Woody Allen shtick (a neurotic philosopher chasing after a girl out of his league) then you know the casting is pretty spot on. Then again, if you’ve seen a lot of Woody Allen movies before you probably won’t be able to look past the fact that this is just Woody Allen as an ant. Still, Woody brings a lot of his trademark humor to the role (he even had a part rewriting dialogue in the script to better suit his comedic style) and I can certainly tell they tailored it just for him (I did here somewhere that he hated the voice over process because he had to recite his lines over and over; he found the task so tedious he vowed never to do another animated film ever again. Apparently he kept that promise).\n\nSharon Stone voices Princess Bala. She pulls off the role adequately enough, but there’s nothing about it that’s very noteworthy. She plays it pretty straight, adding nothing to the character any other actress couldn’t do. She’s not terrible per se, it’s just an average performance.\n\nGene Hackman voices General Mandible, and although he doesn’t give a very subtle or nuanced performance, it’s still certainly an effective one. He’s tough, boisterous, but can also show off moments of great cunning and intellect. He’s also one of the few performances that doesn’t make it obvious that a known actor is playing the role (unless you’ve seen a lot of Gene Hackman films, which admittedly I have not) and you can see him more as a character than a performance. With what the actor had to work with, I think he pulls it off well.\n\nSylvester Stallone plays Weaver…\n\n…as if you couldn’t tell just by looking at him.\n\nI’ve never considered Stallone a brilliant actor, but surprisingly he elevates this character into being something much more than he could have been. He could have been just a stereotypical macho man, even the stereotypical macho man with a heart of gold. But something about him seems more genuine than the above archetypes. Most characters like him always seem to be hiding something; they put up a tough front but inside they’re really sweet and/or intuitive. Weaver wears it all on his sleeve, you know immediately that he’s tough and a bit of a show off but he’s still a good and smart guy. I think that makes him more genuine, making him feel like an actual person as opposed to a Hollywood archetype. And surprisingly, I have to hand it to Stallone for bringing that out.\n\nJennifer Lopez plays Azteca, Z’s feisty co worker and friend. She plays the tough and sassy role pretty well, and it does work with what the actress is known for,but nothing about it is very memorable. She’s good, just nothing to write home about.\n\nChristopher Walken plays Colonel Cutter in probably the oddest casting choice of the film. Walken is known for his quirky and over the top roles, so you would think he could bring out something interesting in this character. But disappointingly, he plays the character fairly straight. No quirks, no one liners, nothing really remarkable at all. Sure, it’s certainly a different kind of role than he is usually offered, but I don’t ever want to walk out of a movie and say the Christopher Walken performance was the most boring one out of the movie. That just feels like blasphemy.\n\nFinally, Danny Glover plays Barbatus. Now, I’ve never seen a Danny Glover role I didn’t like. He just has an ability to elevate a character to the point of being memorable even if originally he wasn’t all that remarkable. Danny adds his trademark charisma and charm to the role, as well as making the character sound genuinely rugged and capable. No wonder he became a stand out character.\n\nThe cast here is a bit of a mixed bag, with some actors elevating their characters to new heights while others seem content to play it safe/straight. Still, I think there’s enough here to like and overall this is an impressive ensemble.\n\nI’ll give the cast of this film an 85 out of 100.\n\nPersonal Enjoyment\n\nLike I said before, DreamWorks was basically founded so Jeffrey Katzenberg could make animated films that Disney wouldn’t allow him to make. Because of this, Antz does a lot of things that were basically unheard of in animated ‘family’ films at the time. Disney films strove not to get a PG rating at the time, but DreamWorks aimed for that kind of audience. Disney didn’t allow non religious swearing (hell and damned were allowed to slip in every once and a while, but always in a religious context), but Dreamworks broke that boundary completely. A couple dozen times characters say words and phrases that would make a conservative parent showing this film to their 4 year old kids slightly gasp (I saw this movie when I was little, and I certainly learned a lot of new words I could repeat in inappropriate and inopportune occasions).\n\nAnother way it differs from other animated films at the time is the way it portrays it’s moral. Even though the villain itself is an obvious black and white antagonist, the characters themselves hold a lot of grays in their values. This makes them feel realistic and certainly adds some depth. Even the film’s ultimate lesson isn’t portrayed in extremes like most good vs evil narratives are. Z spends the entire movie complaining about the oppressive system and longing for a way to express himself. People who relate to Z’s plight may feel like he is completely in the right, especially when they see how corrupt the ant political system is. But in the end, Z and the entire colony realize that individuality is important, but when people work together great things can be accomplished. It’s all about balance. That is a refreshingly mature moral that no other mainstream animated film at the time really had.\n\nI personally found a lot to like about in this movie. I’m going to give my personal enjoyment of the film a 90 out of 100.\n\nAnimal Characterization\n\nOne of the refreshing things about this movie is that the insects are actually shown to scale. If you look at the characters in A Bugs Life, you can see the characters are more or less similarly sized.\n\nBut if you’ve seen an ant compared to an insect like a grasshopper or mantis, you know they look absolutely gargantuan in comparison. This movie takes advantage of that fact by making the ants the smallest things in their environment. This gives an impressive amount of scale to the movie, and shows how a simple four step walk for a human is an arduous journey for out main characters.\n\nAnts being portrayed in a totalitarian society is nothing new, and us projecting our political and military images onto the creatures is certainly an old comparison (where do you think the term ‘army ant’ came from?). But this movie is a more adult deconstruction of the image, with the characters actually engaging in political corruption and militaristic Darwinism. Certainly an interesting spin on an old analogy.\n\nThe movie also presents us with an interesting case of species racism. A couple of wasp characters (voiced by Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin) make a brief appearance in the film. These characters view themselves as somewhat high cultured compared to other bugs because they can fly. When the male wasp notices Z and Bala, he negatively describes them as ‘crawling insects’. He even goes as far to refer to them as ‘Euro-trash’ when Bala remarks that she is a princess (that moment was priceless BTW). His wife, on the other hand, portrays a different form of racism (if you could call it that). She’s the kind of person who wants to help those less fortunate than her, but in doing so she condescends to them anyway. She speaks in slow, disjointed words to make sure they can understand her, and overall behaves like the person who does work to help minorities but believes they would all kill each other or starve to death if she doesn’t come to save the day. Still, she isn’t portrayed overtly negatively, and all that talking down to them was probably just a result of ignorance. It’s still pretty sad to see her bite the dust (oh yeah, spoilers).\n\nThe entire film almost seems to be a deconstruction of the consequences animals having human intellect and societies would have. It pulls apart the idea of adding human characteristics to little cartoon animals to a more negative extreme, showing the insects with some of the more negative traits humans as a species have. Oh, we like to think ants run like little armies? Let’s add corruption of military power. Oh, some insects can fly and others can’t? Let’s have that as a grounds for racism!\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nAs a first film for the studio, this movie gives a pretty good idea of the kind of movies to expect from DreamWorks. I certainly feel this is one of their stronger features. It has a mature story, well realized characters, impressive animation, and the ambition to do something different from the then norm. I give this movie and 81 out of 100, a B-.\n\nNow, here’s the real question, which movie do I like better: Antz or A Bugs Life?\n\nWell, despite the many plot parallels, tonally these films are completely different. And in what they are trying to accomplish, I think both films succeed. I certainly like them both, and it really depends on my mood over which movie I prefer. I have more a nostalgic connection with A Bugs Life, but I have grown to appreciate Antz more as I got older. But both are still very strong films in their own right.\n\nThank you so much for attending my first review. More are on the way, so don’t miss out."
