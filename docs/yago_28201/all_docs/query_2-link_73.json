        "text": "@TheeHistoryBuff , I apologize for sort-of bumping this, but I was actually thinking about this very topic for a potential non-hemophiliac Alexei TL. I agree that all German Princesses would be excluded form consideration in a post-WWI TL, but haven't been able to find a really good pick beyond that. I do have some thoughts on the various ideas mentioned here though. I think Astrid of Sweden would be a very good pick; she came from a well-established nation with good connections, a dynasty that already had previous ties to the Romanovs (her cousin the Duke of Södermanland had been married to Nicholas II's first cousin Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna previously) and she was quite charming. The only potential issue is her lower rank; the Romanovs tended to prefer the daughter of a reigning monarch for their Empresses, though considering the post-WWI limitations (and Astrid's sister being the Crown Princess of Norway), this might be enough for the Russians to overcome their snootiness.\n\n1. @Lalli I think both Bulgaria and Serbia would be out, as neither had princesses of the right age (Tsar Ferdinand's daughters Exodia and Nadezhda were six and five years older, and Bulgaria had sided with the Central powers, while Peter I's only surviving daughter was much too old and already married to Prince Ioann Konstantinovich). Which leaves Greece (whose neutrality and close ties to the Hohenzollerns likely makes them suspect) and Romania (probably the best candidate due to existing close ties between Marie of Edinburgh and the Romanovs). Another potential candidate might be Princess Ingrid of Sweden, mother of today's Queen Margarethe II of Denmark. A little young, but it could work.\n\n3. @Welshroyalhistory actually, that would be the exact opposite. The Vladimirovichi were especially hatted by Alix and Nicky, and under no circumstances would they want closer ties. That would be rewarding them for plotting against the Tsar, and also ignoring the fact that the Vladimirs were never a threat to Alexei, only Alix. Plus, if we're going with a Vladimirovich, why not one of Grand Duke Kirill's daughters, Maria and Kira? They'd be actual Romanovs with closer ties to the next in line, rather then his distant nieces.\n\nPersonally, I wonder if there's a chance that, with an increasingly limited pool of marriage partners, Nicky might open up the House laws to include various mediatized Russian nobles who descended from more distant royal lines. These would be the legitimate male-line descendants of various Rurikid lines, the Gediminids, the Bagrationi and any remaining Tatar lines (I think the Yusupovs were among that rank). This might not be the solution the Romanovs want, but I think they'd have to seriously think about. Like how George V allowed his children to marry members of the British nobility.\n\n2. @Rattenfänger von Memphis , Giovanna would only be a candidate for Empress if she was willing to convert to Orthodoxy. Her being married in an Orthodox ceremony is all well and good, but the Russians would not except a heathen/heretic as Empress. The only exception to Orthodox conversion that was ever made was for Grand Duke Vladimir's wife Miechen, who did eventually convert later on. Moreover, she wasn't the future Empress, just the wife of the Tsar's second son. So unless Giovanna is willing to make the leap, she's out. Same for any Princess really.\n\n3. @Welshroyalhistory actually, that would be the exact opposite.

This might not be the solution the Romanovs want, but I think they'd have to seriously think about. Like how George V allowed his children to marry members of the British nobility.\n\nThe scenario we were starting from about is a weakened Tsar/Romanov dynasty. One who likely has to build allies, even moreso with his enemies and threats within his own family.\n\nThe likelihood is that this marriage is not taking place until the mid to late 1920s by which time both Tsarina Alexandra and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, who fuelled much of the enmity are probably dead. The latter died in 1920 but lets assume a significant element of that was stress related that likely gives her a few more years at most. Similarly Alexandra's heart issues likely meant she was never going to live to an old lady. The likelihood is that they are both dead.\n\nThe Greek girls have the advantage unlike the Kirill daughters of being without any mark on their heritage - there were still questions over Kirill and Victoria Melita's marriage which was made without the Tsar's consent (although he subsequently granted approval) and was in breach of Russian orthodoxy. Don't under estimate this factor, its still used as a particular stick to beat their descendant Grand Duchess Maria's claim to be the head of the Romanov dynasty in 2023.\n\nI'm not sure if the Tsar had particularly strong feelings for his first cousin Elena but he was particularly fond of her husband Nicholas, who was also the Tsar' first cousin. He even went to the extent of paying to build Nicholas and Elena's palace in Athens, now the Italian Embassy. The Tsar had no affection for Kirill and I am not aware that he was particularly fond of Victoria Melita despite them being first cousins (her mother was his father's only sister), certainly none of the books on Nicholas and the few biographies of VM and her sister Marie of Romania make little mention of them being close but there was a 10 year age gap.\n\nTsarina Maria Feodrovna (who likely outlives Alexandra) loathed Germans and is likely to have advocated for her grandson marrying someone from her own family and the Greek girls fell into that category, the Kirill girls did not.\n\nThe Tsar blocked any changes to the marriage laws to reduce the standards of royal spouses for female Romanovs (notwithstanding their limited succession rights) as late as 1914 refusing to consider the marriage of his own niece Irina to Prince Yusupov, arguably Russia's richest nobleman as meeting the Pauline standards. Read the wikipedia entry on Princess Tatiana, which details the attempts various Romanovs made to try and convince the Tsar to reduce marital standards for female Romanovs (who had limited succession rights) as late as 1911. He refused, so its pretty impossible to imagine approximately a decade and a bit later he would make such a huge change for male dynasts.\n\nIt would have created a ticking time bomb and introduced a whole new bunch of threats to his own son and heir.\n\nThe Tsar refused to recognise his brother Michael's morganatic marriage and Michael had a perfectly healthy son albeit subject of a non-equal union. Change the law for Alexei and suddenly his first cousin looks a much better prospect for Tsar or the very least as Alexei's heir. Same goes for any number of male Romanovs who had contracted morganatic marriages and produced children.\n\nThe Tsar had to stick to the rules to protect his own son's inheritance as introducing a bunch of new alternative, healthy males was not going to help Alexei."
