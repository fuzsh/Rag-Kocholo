        "text": "Grigory Rasputin, a mystic peasant who captivated the Russian imperial court, met his death at the hands of aristocratic enemies 100 years ago.\n\nArtem Krechetnikov of BBC Russian examines the grisly murder of Rasputin and finds that some details are more myth than reality.\n\nFew characters in Russian history are as well-known as the mystic from Tobolsk in Siberia, whose name is forever linked to scandal.\n\nHe has been called a \"sex machine\" and \"lover\" of the Tsarina, Alexandra Feodorovna. The first description is probably an exaggeration, and the second is simply false.\n\nRussians' opinions of him, at the time and later, ranged from \"holy man\" to \"reptile\". The latter was how the reformist prime minister of the time, Pyotr Stolypin, contemptuously spoke of him.\n\nWith the outbreak of war in 1914 there was hysteria about \"dark forces around the throne\".\n\nThe Empress Alexandra, wife of Tsar Nicholas II, believed Rasputin had mystical healing powers that could help her haemophiliac son Alexei, the heir to the throne.\n\nRasputin was uneducated, but no fool. The Yusupovs were fabulously rich - Irina was a member of the royal family - so Rasputin could hardly have thought she would let herself be seduced so easily.\n\nAccording to Rasputin's daughter Maria, Russian Interior Minister Alexander Protopopov had warned Rasputin that there was a plot to kill him. He advised him to avoid socialising for a few days, but Rasputin told him \"it's too late\".\n\nSo it remains a mystery why he visited the Yusupovs. It cannot have been just for the Madeira and jolly music.\n\nThere were rumours that the Empress Alexandra and Protopopov were planning to dissolve parliament - the Duma - introduce a state of emergency and sue for peace.\n\nIt was quite feasible for Yusupov to lure Rasputin by promising a meeting with allies of the empress.\n\nThe rest of the assassins' account of what happened reads like the screenplay of a horror movie.\n\nAfter the poison allegedly failed to work, Yusupov had to open fire, but Rasputin rose up again, like a monster. Even blows to the temple failed to stop Rasputin, who pursued Yusupov out across the courtyard.\n\nThen allegedly Purishkevich fired four shots into Rasputin's back, felling him.\n\nSo, what of the poisoned cakes? People who knew Rasputin well said he always refused sweet things, believing them to be harmful to his special powers.\n\nGuards questioned about the murder reported hearing about four shots, in quick succession.\n\nA pathologist determined the cause of death to be a shot to the stomach, causing heavy blood loss.\n\nAccording to another myth, Rasputin's defiance of death was such that the plotters had to drown him in icy water.\n\nBut the autopsy said: \"No evidence of drowning was found. Rasputin was already dead when he was thrown into the water.\"\n\nYusupov went into exile in Paris after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and lived to 80.\n\nPurishkevich was arrested in Petrograd in 1918, then released on the orders of secret police chief Felix Dzerzhinsky. He died of typhus in 1920, during the Russian civil war.\n\nThe violence and chaos of the revolution and Bolshevik terror make Rasputin's words sound prophetic: \"Without me everything will collapse.\"\n\nHe had also predicted his own murder, in a letter to Nicholas II. If nobles did it, he warned, it would bring down the monarchy.\n\nCommunist revolutionaries murdered the royal family in 1918."
