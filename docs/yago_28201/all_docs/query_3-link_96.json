When this was unsuccessful - or seemed to be too prolonged - he was shot a number of times. The conspirators then left but Prince Felix Yusupov had forgotten his coat and returned to the cellar to retrieve it. Rasputin struggled to his feet and attempted to strangle the prince. The other conspirators, arriving on the scene, shot the monk again and, when this did not seem entirely successful, finally clubbed him to death. The body was then thrown into the Neva River from the bridge to Krestovsky island.\n\n\nThis is a translation into English of this 1967 interview in French:\n\nInterviewer:   Prince Felix Yusupov, you killed Rasputin?\n\nPrince:   Yes\n\nInterviewer:   How old are you prince?\n\nPrince:   Nearly eighty\n\nInterviewer: How old were you when you killed Rasputin?\n\nPrince: Twenty-nine\n\nInterviewer:   Prince, are you part of the Imperial Russian family?\n\nPrince:   No, but my wife is the niece of the Emperor Nicholas the Second\n\nInterviewer: Princess, were you aware of the plan of your husband?\n\nPrincess: Yes, I was aware of it.\n\nInterviewer: And did you approve?\n\nPrincess: Yes.\n\nInterviewer: Princess, we have said - we have repeated, that you had been in (unclear) Rasputin to his home the night of the murder?
