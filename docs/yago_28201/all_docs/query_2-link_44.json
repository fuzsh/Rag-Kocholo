        "text": "Details\n\nEleven original antique black and white photos of the Memorial Service for Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia (1875-1960), held at the Russian Orthodox Church of the Assumption at Emperor's Gate in Kensington in London, April 26th 1960. Four photocopies of her obituaries in English paper is also included. There are two additional copies of two photos and there is a photo of her grave in France marked with an 'x'. There are also photocopies of contemporary newspaper reports of her obituary. I have been able to identify the following people in the photos:\n\nPrincess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia (Princess Irina Yusupov ) (1895 - 1970)\n\nPrince Dmitri Alexandrovich of Russia (1901 - 1980)\n\nPrincess Xenia Andreevna Romanoff (1919 - 2000)\n\nPrince Alexander Nikitich Romanov (1929 - 2002)\n\nCount Vladimir Petrovich Kleinmichel (1901 - 1982)\n\nArkady Georgievich Rakoff (1895 - 1972)\n\nFather George Sheremetiev (d.1971)\n\nFather John of Shanghai\n\nMarquess of Milford Haven\n\nShe was the elder daughter of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia (nÃ©e Princess Dagmar of Denmark) and the sister of Emperor Nicholas II. She married her cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia, with whom she had seven children. During her brother's reign she recorded in her diary and letters increasing concern about his rule. After the fall of the monarchy in February 1917 she fled Russia, eventually settling in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn 26 February 1933, Xenia's husband Sandro Grand Duke Alexander Michailovich died. Xenia and her sons were present at his funeral on 1 March, in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in the south of France. By March 1937, Xenia had moved from Frogmore Cottage in Windsor Great Park to Wilderness House in the grounds of Hampton Court Palace, where she continued to live until she died on 20 April 1960. Despite reduced circumstances during her lifetime, Xenia left a small estate to her remaining relatives.\n\nSize: 14 x 9 cm approx"
