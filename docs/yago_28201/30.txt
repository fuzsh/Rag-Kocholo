Thanks for sharing interesting photos!

I have read Pikul's account of this wedding. He mentioned that a truly grand ceremony preceded by a beautiful courtship was the society event of the year. Prince Felix splurged on magnificent pieces of jewellery that would emphasise his bride's beauty. Looking at the photo of Princess Yousoupov, I have to say that she was a stunning woman, indeed.
