The latest importation from Argentina to arrive in Harlem, "Jettatore," is an extremely lightweight comedy, but it moves fast and keeps the patrons of the Radio Teatro Hispano laughing most of the time. It seems that a "jettatore" (the word is more Italian than Spanish) is a possessor of the "evil eye" magnified to the 'steenth degree. Consequently when a likable young man (Tito Lusiardo) of the middle class finds that his pretty sweetheart (Alito Roman) is in danger of being married off by her parents to a rich old idler (Enrique Serrano), he proceeds to make almost everybody, including the victim, believe that the ancient suitor is a "jettatore" of the first water. The players are good and so is the direction of Luis Bayon Herrera. The picture is a Lumiton production.
