        "text": "Blanquita Amaro (June 30, 1923 in San Antonio de los BaÃ±os, Cuba â March 15, 2007 in Miami, United States) was a Cuban film actress of the 1940s and early 1950s who starred in the Golden Age of Argentine Cinema. She appeared in some 17 films between 1939 and 1954 appearing often in films involving her native Cuba in co-production with Argentina such as A La Habana me voy (I'm Coming to Havana), working under director Luis BayÃ³n Herrera. She also appeared in films such as Buenos Aires a la vista in 1950 though which on the contrary had strong Argentine themes in it. She retired from films in 1954."
