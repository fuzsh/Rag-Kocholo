        "text": "Rothenburg ob der Tauber has been on my travel bucket list for years. And I finally got there last November. It is an enchanting place. With its half-timbered houses, clock towers, colorful façades, schneeballs and beer steins, Rothenburg ODT oozes with medieval charm.\n\nIt's no surprise that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I was partially filmed in Rothenburg ODT.\n\nThis is a common dilemma in Rothenburg ODT. Which direction to take? It's hard to choose because every cobblestone street seems to be competing for the best dressed street award. And they are all winners in my book.\n\nAfter walking half a day, an inviting table for two with colorful flowers to warm a cold November day.\n\nI love how these two half-timbered buildings anchor a street that leads to another intriguing square.\n\nThe Plönlein (Little Square) is the most photographed square in Rothenburg ODT. But I found more picturesque neighborhoods than this. That's the beauty of Rothenburg ODT. So many choices to get that enviable shot.\n\nI entered St. Jacob's Church (St. James Church) about 10 minutes before it closed for lunch break. And the cashier was kind enough to let me in for free. So I hurried to see as much as I could. On the main altar is the altarpiece of the Twelve Apostles and the Crucifixion by Friedrich Herlin from 1466. It was a sunny day and the centuries-old stained glass windows behind the altar were brilliantly lit by the late morning light.\n\nThe most important treasure of the church is the carved Altar of the Holy Blood by Tilman Riemenschneider. Unfortunately, I didn´t get to see it this time.\n\nSt. Jacob's Church is on the Jakobsweg (St. James Way), the medieval pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela. Today, people still go to St. Jacob's as a pilgrimage destination to pay homage to St. James, the Apostle.\n\nThe Markplatz is also the site of the annual Christmas market. It’s a beautiful square dominated by the Rathaus (Town Hall). The white building with a clock in the center is the tourist information office.* How dazzling it must be with Christmas decorations and lights!\n\n*Note: Make sure to pick up a map at the tourist office. It makes navigating and identifying historical landmarks much easier.\n\nThis staircase leads up to the wall walk for a panoramic view of the old town. Not all stairs or gates are open in the off season. This particular one was closed in November.\n\nThe best views of Rothenburg ODT and its red rooftops can be had from the old town walls. Towers and gatehouses dot the ramparts along the way.\n\nWhen someone says,\"I'll drink to that!\"\n\nWhere to stay in Würzburg:\n\nWurzburger Hof\n\nBarbarossaplatz, 2\n\nConvenient location. Walking distance to most attractions in the city. Helpful and friendly staff.\n\n*****\n\nImages by TravelswithCharie\n\nLabels\n\nPre-colonial period Pag-unlad ng Panggagamot sa Pilipinas (The Progress of Medicine in the Philippines) is a group of four large-scale paintings depicting healing practices in the Philippines from pre-colonial times to the modern period. Carlos Botong Francisco was commissioned in 1953 by Dr. Agerico Sison who was then the director of Philippine General Hospital (PGH) together with Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing of the National Museum, Dr. Florentino Herrera, Jr. and Dr. Constantino Manahan. These oil on canvas paintings measure 2.92 meters in height and 2.76 meters in width (9.71 ft x 8.92 ft) and were displayed at the main entrance hall of PGH for over five decades. Owing to its location, the artworks were in a state of \"severe deterioration\" at the beginning of the 21st century from exposure to heat, humidity, dirt, dust, smoke, insect stains, grime, termites and an oxidized synthetic resin used in an earlier restoration. These canvases were restored three times, the last was\n\nIn 1968, Antonio Villegas (then Mayor of Manila), commissioned Carlos \"Botong\" Francisco to paint the history of Manila for Manila City Hall. The series of large scale paintings was called Kasaysayan ng Maynila (History of Manila). The paintings deteriorated over time and no attempt was made to preserve these historical canvases until 2013 when Mayor Amado Lim sent them to the National Museum for extensive restoration. Four years later, in 2017, Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada and the Manila City Council signed an agreement with the National Museum to leave the paintings at the museum so they may reach a larger audience in exchange for museum grade reproductions to replace the originals. Kasaysayan ng Maynila was later renamed Filipino Struggles in History and is now on display at the Senate Hall of the National Museum . Carlos \"Botong\" Francisco died in March 1969, a few months after completing the paintings. He is one of the first Filipino modernists and\n\nLizares Mansion The province of Iloilo on the island of Panay has a rich trove of heritage houses, left over from the sugar industry boom in the 19th century. Iloilo also had the largest port in the Philippines at that time which facilitated the export of sugar to foreign shores and deposited money in the hands of the sugar barons. The barons dropped their earnings into the acquisition of properties in Negros and the construction of beautiful homes in Iloilo, many of which are located in the vicinity of the Jaro Cathedral. The Lizares Mansion was built in 1937 by Don Emiliano Lizares for his wife, Concepcion Gamboa and five children. The family fled to safety when World War II broke out and the house was occupied by the Japanese military. The family returned to the house after the war but left once again after the demise of Don Emiliano. It was sold to the Dominican order in the 1960s and was converted in 1978 to a private school, Angelicum School. The mansion now houses the"
