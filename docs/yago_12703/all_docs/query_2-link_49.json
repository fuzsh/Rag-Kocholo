        "text": "Malocchio\n\nFrom Dominick A. Faust, 29 Dec 1995 (Reggio di Calabria & Siracusa):\n\nI have a question about superstitions. I've watched the movie the \"A Bronx Tale\" several times. I have noticed that \"C\" the young character and \"Sonny\" the \"Don\" for lack of another descriptive word, exchanged a sign of friendship with a hand gesture. When I was young, my father had told me the same hand gesture was for wishing evil on someone. Or he called it \"horns\". !???!\n\nFrom Margie Vaughan, 29 Dec 1995:\n\nMy Nana Pauline Russo use to say that hand sign (the one from Bronx Tale) was a sign to keep the evil eye away. She believed one of her babies died becuase of the evil eye. A women kept saying how beautiful her baby was.\n\nWhen my Nana told her mother-in-law about the woman, my great grandmother told her not to walk that way any more. The woman still found my Nana & Michael and told her the baby was to beautiful to live. Until the day my Nana passed away she believed this was why her son got sick & died. We were always told never say a baby is beautiful, whenever you felt like saying this you should always say instead, God bless this baby.\n\nFrom GRACE E DEASY (Sicily):\n\nto all the piesani,best wishes for the new year,my great aunt used the oil and water to cure a headache and maybe a heartache too.i would likk up in that book about superstitions about the horns,we had a cow horn set over back door that were painted blue with rings of green around the ends!!to keep the evil spirit away.?anyone else have this decoration?\n\nFrom Edna Rober, 31 Dec 1995:\n\nThree years ago in Ferrazano (Campobasso), I was suffering from a migraine while Marie and I were researching old family records at the \"city\" hall. Needing lunch (or something) we went to the restaurant (the only). The young waiter recognized me as a sick puppy and was very solicitous. After I had ordered plain rice, he returned and asked me my name. Married? Maiden? No. First. I asked why. His grandmother was in the kitchen and wanted to help. She was going to write my name in oil drops in a pan on the stove.\n\nOkaaaay.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, I told my sister I really was feeling a lot better!!! I don't question anything - as long as it works. I met grandmother in the kitchen, chatted with the family and left feeling my normal self.\n\nThought your readers would like to hear a first-hand experience.\n\nFrom EDWARD F MOMORELLA, 1 Jan 1996:\n\nI remember a great aunt who would rush home when anyone would tell her she was pushing around a \"beautiful baby\" and pour holy water in a dish and put in drops of oil. If the oil spread out over the water, that was a bad sign and she had to say some prayers to rid the evil.\n\nIf the drops stayed relatively in the same place, things were ok. She would bless herself and be calm again.\n\nFrom Albert Pasquino, 5 Jan 1996\n\nHow well I remember those festivals in Hammonton, NJ. As a boy growing up inthe 30's in Paulsboro, NJ going to the festival was an annual event. Most of all I remember the fireworks display at the end of the days celebration.\n\nAnd oh yes, about the oil and water bit. Whenever we got a headache, the\"Evil eye\" was the cause, of course. Mom would get a soup bowl and oil.\n\nThen she would dip her finger in the oil and make the sign of the cross continually on our forehead all the while saying some prayers in Italian, which I could not understand, even though I understood Italian in my youth. After the prayers she would dip her fingers in the oil and let drops fall into the water. As I remember, the shape the oil took in the surface of the water indicated whether the \"Evil eye\" had been removed. If it had the headache was gone! If not she would repeat the ritual a second time and it usually did the trick. Never had an aspiren until I enlisted the the Air Force in 1948 and any veteran knows the cure for everything was 2 APCs. Oh yes, in 1954 I was sent to Korea and my wife, who is British, stayed with my parents for that year. Not only did she become an accomplished Italian cook but attests to the fact that Mom's oil and water really worked on her too!\n\nFrom Bob Collins, 20 Jan 1996:\n\nThe following is from HYGEIA, June, 1926, \"The Immigrant Mother as Seen by a Social Worker\" by Dorothy G. Spicer:\n\n\"There was Mrs. Vitelli's baby, who was so plump that a neighbor said, 'Oh, doesn't Tony look just like a cow?' Immediately...the baby grew black and frothed at the mouth. To see if he was 'overlooked,' or afflicted by the dreaded Evil Eye, a drop of oil was put into a glass of water. Instead of spreading over the surface of the water, the oil stayed in one place and looked just like an eye, thus proving the nature of the baby's ailment. A cure was wrought by bringing in a woman whosaid an incantation learned on Christmas eve. Anyone taught the incantation on the eve of Christ's birth haspower to cure 'overlooked; persons; consequently, old wives knowing the charmed words are still much sought after, even in this country.\" (P. 319).\n\nFrom Arthur Urbano, 26 Apr 1996:\n\nWhenever my grandfather tells his stories about his grandparents when they came over from Italy, we all sigh and say \"Not that one again!\" It's funny.\n\nI am so thankful now that my grandfather repeated his stories over and over again, because I've committed tham to memory and they've helped me with my research. It's been fun trying to prove and disprove these legends. I'm surprised, most of the legends my grandfather tells are 90% true! My grandfather, Tony CUCCA, was born in Providence, RI. In fact so was his father! But both of his grandfathers, Stazio CUCCA from Ciorlano and Luigi PEZZA from Prata Sannita (both in Caserta), came to America in the 1890s.\n\nThere was one legend in particular which I love to hear, but my grandmother cringes whenever my grandfather is about to tell it. She always tries to change the subject.\n\nMy grandfather tells us that his grandmother Filomena SQUEZIA from Capriati a Volturno was a really mean lady. She never got along with my grandfather's mother Filomena PEZZA (her daughter-in-law). They used to argue all the time. FInally, when Filomena Pezza was pregnant with my grandfather, her mother-in-law told her that she hoped they would take the baby out with a pitchfork! In response my grandfather's mother said \"I hope you never see him!\" At this point my grandfather will pause, look at all of us with his finger pointed straight up and conclude, \"She died a month before I was born! It's the truth!\"\n\nWell, I wasn't sure if it was the truth, so I went to the Rhode Island State Archives and looked up Filomena Squezia's death record. You know, she died Jan 15, 1911 and my grandfather was born Feb 8, 1911! It was true. A real live family curse and a legend proved to be true.\n\nNow I'm trying to figure out how she died. The death record says she died of \"Acute Cholecystitis\" or something like that. Maybe some of you doctors out there can help me out.\n\nFrom Tony La Bella:\n\nMy father has told me of many occasions that my nonna performed the ritual for a variety of reasons. That included curing a sickness, answering a particular question, or to remove a curse that someone might have placed on an individual in the family. While he doesn't remember the exact incantations, my grandmothe would place water in a bowl, and while making the sign of the cornu, drop oil into the water. If the oil combined it was a favorable sign, if they separated, it was not. She would repeat this a number of times until, I believe, until she was pleased with the outcome.\n\nMy father seemed to indicate that this skill was passed down from generation to generation. As a matter of fact, he said that my grandmother once told him that her \"mentor\" (her aunt) would not teach her certain spells and incantations because they were too terrible and dangerous.\n\nFrom Jo Tedesco - 8 May 1996 (Reggio Calabria):\n\nThe other thing to add was that the 'power' had to be renewed yearly at Christmas time I think! Grandfather had mother taught as an insurance to make sure the oxen didn't get sick!\n\nFrom Vincent Paratore - 8 May 1996 (Sicily):\n\nMy father was one of these that could perform the removal of curses or \"evil eye\". But as I recall, he would not pass on this ritual to me,when he the ritual was completed he would cut thru the water oil mixture with a knife making the sign of the cross. He was always reluctant to perform this ritual. It always took something out of him.\n\nFrom Maria Seminara Commodore, 8 May 1996:\n\nTony and PIEsani, Many times this procedure was done on me when I lived in Sicily and even after we came to the USA. Mostly to get rid of a terrible headache (possibly caused by Malocchio?).\n\nThere was always a lot of jealousy among relatives anÝbody stared at you too long, it was taken as Malocchio and for whatever reason you ended up with a splitting head-ache!\n\nPersonally I believe the cooleness of the ceramic with cold water on your head always brought relief and of course a little of mind over matter might have helped.\n\nFrom Arthur Urbano, 08 May 1996:\n\nTonight I asked my grandmother about the malocchio. She's 80 and was born in the USA, her mother, from Teano, used to perform it. Apparently my g-grandmother would perform this ritual to get rid of headaches. She would get a bowl of water and pour some oil into it. If the oil formed a large circle in the middle of the bowl, the ritual worked and the headache would go away; if not, well, it didn't work.\n\nThis seems similar to other rituals that people have been describing. It seems that paganism persisted in the old world.\n\nFrom Tom Lazzara, 9 May 1996:\n\nSubject: Sole a Testa/headache\n\nPie-sanos, Not sure if this comes under superstitions or home remedies bt it works. On hot summer days after playing outside all day I would sometimes have a headache in the evening. My mother would place a hankerchief over a glass of water and with my head in her lap would turn the glass over on my forehead. Done rapidly none of the water would spill. After about 30 seconds bubbles would start to rise up in the inverted glass. When there were no more bubbles she would remove the glass and the headache would soon be gone.\n\nShe said the headache was caused from \"sole a testa\" (sun in the head). I don't remember how old I was when I questioned the Authenticity, but being a dubting Thomas I did. I had her do it a second time and a 3rd time to see if it would produce bubbles again. It didn't. I figured it was just air bubbles from water that may have leaked out, so I had her do it when I didn't have a headache, No bubbles. But the next time I had a headache, guess what, there were bubbles. Try this on a hot day sometime, I think it works better then a cold wash cloth. It draws the heat out of your head. Maybe thats why I have never been known as a Hot Headed Italian, Hard Yes, Hot No. Given some the messages that have been burning up the keyboards\n\nMaybe now would be a good time for all of us to try it.(myself included) Water use to be cheaper\n\n\"VIVA L'ULIVO\" Gianfranco\n\nFrom Nick.DiValerio, 9 May 1996:\n\nMy mother, born in Italy, always had this ritual performed on her when her headaches became unbearable. She explained that the headaches were so bad because someone had evil thoughts about you. Call it supersition, but it seemed to work more than it doesn't. However, the ritual can only be performed by certain people. It has to be taught by someone who practices.\n\nFrom Nick - 25 Aug 1996:\n\nMy GM was born on Christmas day in 1882, and as such, was reputed to be able to cure the unfotunates who'd been given the Evil Eye by a \"Jettatori\". I recall adults & children coming to her home, where she would place cold water in a dish, then say something in Italian, which ended with the afflicted 's name. Next, she would let a few drops of olive oil run down her little finger, into the water. At this point, all gathered around the dish to se if the oil would disperse or conglutinate. She would then make the sign of the cross above the water with scissors, screwrdiver, & knife.\n\nFrom Joe Tambe - 26 Aug 1996:\n\nMal Occhio is a subject I have some knowledge about from my Sicilian heritage. Mal Occhio literally means the \"evil eye\". Many people believe that with a strong, severe look, someone could put a curse on you. In this case, the curse caused sickness, (fever, headache, stomach ache, etc.).\n\nWhen there was the belief that perhaps the illness was caused by \"mal occhio\", an aged woman (preferably a relative), was called in. The afflicted person was made to lie down or sit in a chair.\n\nA large, shallow bowl was filled with water and held over the head of the afflicted. With the index finger, three drops of olive oil were dropped into the bowl of water. At the same time, she said and made the sign of the cross to bless the afflicted. If the olive oil drops remained in normal single drops, it was concluded that the sickness was not caused by \"mal occhio\". However, if the olive oil spread out over the water, sometimes even sputtering, then that was \"proof\" that mal occhio was the culprit. At that point, the woman shifted into a curative prayer: \"Let the mal occhio get behind you and God bring you ahead\". After several repetitions, the water was changed and the olive oil applied again. If the drops were normal, the curse was lifted and the person would get well in a short time. If the drops continued to diffuse, the prayers were repeated and the process repeated over and over sometimes with success, sometimes not.\n\nFrom Maryann Ruperto - 27 Aug 1996 (Abruzzi):\n\nHi Nick, Last night when I read your posting about the evil eye to my mother, I asked her if she had ever heard of this. She looked at me very seriously and said not only had she heard of it, she had seen it done many times! Her sister, my aunt, used to do this. Not everyone can do this, only people with some \"special\" abilty. Anyway, my aunt used to pour the oil (as you indicated) into a dish, if the oil disappeared, it meant that someone had put the evil eye on you. She would then pray over this dish. This little ritual was also able to \"break the spell\". My mother said that she had seen it where the oil disappeared and there was no sign of it anywhere. You could put the dish away, it was clean. My mother did not know anything about scissors, screwdrivers, or knives.\n\nThis ritual is only supposed to be passed on to the persons godchild. I hope this sheds some light on the subject.\n\nFrom Arleen Gould - 27 Aug 1996 (Calabria):\n\nJust got off the phone with the mother-in-law and read her the letter about the 'Mal Occhio'. Her mother would use this on them as children when they had headaches, etc. but she asked if any one remembers the prayer that went along with it. She said that you could only pass it on to someone on Christmas Eve. (So let's a pretend it is Christmas Eve, I won't tell if you don't.) Also she said that a 'Red Ribbon' would protect you from the Mal Occhio. So make sure you have it on before you type the prayer.\n\nFrom Bob Fanelli:\n\nMy father, whose grandparents were from Riccia, Campobasso, said that his grandmother used to cure the Malocchio for children in their family. She would take a saucer or bowl, put a little water in it, pour in some oil, then take sewing threads and lay them in the shape of a cross in the floating oil. Afterwards, she would take the thread cross and lay it on the stomach of the sick child.\n\nHe also remembers that it was the practice among the neighborhood boys, in Edge Hill, PA, if they wanted to give someone the Malocchio, to make the sign of the horns and jab it towards the person. At the same time they would make a mean face at the victim. But, he said, it was just kid's stuff and not taken seriously.\n\nFrom Bob Fanelli:\n\nPhiladelphian Charles Godfrey Leland collected folk beliefs in Tuscany in the late 19th century. Here's what he had to say about the \"oil on water\" custom we've been discussing, as he learned it from a woman (a strega) in Florence.\n\n\"I am making an incantesimo with oil....\n\nTake the flask with oil - a small one- make with it thrice the sign of the cross on the head and face, saying:\n\n'In nome del cielo,\n\nDelle stelle e della luna,\n\nMi levo questo malocchio (o altra cosa),\n\nPer mia maggior fortuna!'\n\nThen with the same bottle or vial, make three crosses with the right hand over the glass of water, exactly from side to side, also making the corna or jettatura with the forefinger and little finger of the left hand extended, and the middle and ring finger closed, or held by the thumb. And these extended fingers rest on the edge of the tumbler.\n\nWhile doing this the strega repeats:\n\n'Befania! Befania! Befania!\n\nChi mi ha dato il malocchio,\n\nMe lo porte via!'\n\nThen pour in, or let fall, very carefully , three drops of oil. If they combine at once, it is a good sign, or an affirmative to any question. If you wish to know whether you are to find what you seek, or meet a friend, or anything of the kind, all will go as you desire. But if the three drops remain apart it is a bad or negative sign.\n\nThen to thoroughly explore all the chances, this ceremony is renewed three times. And every time throw the water and oil into the street, or a court. Should a man be the first to pass, all will yet go well. If a woman, the omens are still unfavorable. And then once more make the castagna or chestnut, the sign of the thumb between the fore and middle fingers, which is far more potent than the corna (even the Roman writers call it terrible); note that this also is on the edge of the glass, with the left hand, while with the right, the oil is dropped skillfully so as to make a cross of oil, repeating the Befania invocation three times as before.\n\nAnd if, after all, the oracle is unpropitious, drop into the glass about a teaspoonful of salt, and repeat the formula of 'Befania'. Should the oil turn a whitish color, this is a sign that the Befania relents and that all may yet go well.\n\nBut if she be deaf to every spell... Then drop into the glass a hot coal....This mixes the oil and water despite of all the devils. And this done you go forth with the fierce, proud feeling that, though every omen is against you, you are to prevail by a strong will.\"\n\n-from Charles Godfrey Leland, \"Etruscan Magic & Occult Remedies\", University Books, 1963, pp.311-312.\n\nThe author makes the point that, if at first you don't get the answer you want (or the result you want, in the case of the headache cures mentioned on PIE earlier), then you must persevere and bend the problem to your will. Catholic priests handled the important stuff - baptisms, communion, marriages, deaths - but the common people handled the simple, immediate problems you couldn't call a priest for. I mean, what do you think your parish priest would say if you asked him to come over and get rid of your kid's headache?\n\nJettatore\n\nFrom Nick - 27 Aug 1996:\n\nCertain individuals, usually having a physical mark-such as thick eyebrows or a scar, or belonging to an uncommon cultural or physical type, were regarded as Jettatore: that is, they are capable of giving the evil eye or another magic spell, both willingly and unwillingly. A person born on Christmas eve or day was thought to have the power to overcome that of the Jettatore (as was my grandmother, born Dec 25, 1882.)\n\nSome of this info comes from \"The Two Rosetos,\" (Roseto Valfortore in Foggia) by Carla Bianco U. of Indiana Press, 1971.\n\nFrom Joe Tambe (my parents were born in Sicilia) - 28 Aug 1996:\n\nJettare is Sicilian for \"Buttare\" (Italian) which means to throw(out), or fling or cast(out). Jettatore (Buttatore) is one who throws(out) or casts(out). Throw out the dirty water, throw out the discards, etc. In this case , a person who casts out the evil spell. (As an aside, there is no \"J\" in Italian. In Sicilian, \"J\" is used in conjunction with a vowel-i or e to create a sound like \"ye\" as in \"yet\". So, \"jettatore\" in pronounced \"yettatore\" in Sicilian.)\n\nFrom Steve Saviello - 8 Dec 1996:\n\nLa Befana\n\nIn a little village high atop a hill, in Via della Padella number 2 to be precise, an old lady, part fairy part witch, passes the entire year in company with her grotesque assistants (the Befanucci) preparing coal, making sweets and toys and darning old stockings and socks. These are all to be distributed to children on Rome's magical night of nights, between the 5th and 6th of January. This seems the longest night of all. Every child is in awe of 'La Befana' a sentiment tinged with love and fear.\n\nDressed in black and huge, she comes, entering the houses down the chimney to leave her presents for the children: coal for the bad boys and girlsand sweets and candies for the good ones. The children prepare a plate of soft ricotta cheese for her, for everyone knows that she doesn't have many good teeth left. In origin this character is even older than Babbo Natale (Father Christmas or Santa Claus). Her festival has usurped an ancient pagan feast set celebrated on the Magic Night, the 6th day of the New Year, chosen by ancient Eastern astronomers according to their complicated calculations.\n\nEpiphany was, therefore, pagan in origin. Only later was the day associated with the life of Christ. So strong was the remembrance of things past that two other events in Jesus' life were calculated to have taken place on this day: His Baptism and the Wedding at Cana. Indeed until the forth century Christmas itself was celebrated on 6 January. Until the end of last century La Befana could be found in Piazza Sant'Eustachio or in Piazza dei Cappellari where the annual Christmas fair with cribs and toys took place. Then because of the fashion for crinolins and large hooped skirts the fair was moved to Piazza Navona (where it is still today) taking the place of the four hundread years old spices market which had to bemoved over to Campo de'Fiori.\n\nFrom Velma - 13 Dec 1996:\n\nNonnavelma's Befana Story\n\nI've been off-line for a bit so please excuse me if I'm overloading you with Befana Stories. This is how my grandmother told it to me:\n\nThe three wise men were on their journey when they were stopped by an old woman with a broom who asked them where they were going. They told her that they were following a star that would lead them to a newborn baby. They asked her if she would like to come along with them at which she replied that she was too busy sweeping and cleaning up to go along with such nonsense. Of course, when the realization came to her that the baby was Jesus the Redeemer her regret for not having gone along with the wise men was so great that she is spending eternity taking gifts to good children on Christmas.\n\nMy mother was born in 1903. She lived with her mother and sister in a small village in Tuscany. Her father was a \"figurista\" and traveled all over the world with a band of men selling figurines door-to-door and was never at home. They were very poor as were most of the people in the village. I don't remember they're ever talking about a great Christmas Eve meal. I believe their big treat before going to Midnight Mass was roasting chestnuts in the fireplace. Midnight Mass was the highlight of the holiday. They would walk in the dark along the snowy \"viotoli\" to the bright and warm candle-lit church and together with their friends and relatives greet the Newborn King singing carols such as \"Tu Vieni da Le Stelle, O Re Del Cielo.\" They would then return to their humble homes and set out their wooden shoes (zocoli) and wait for the Befana to come in the night. If they were lucky there might be a sweet bright orange waiting for them in the morning. The very fortunate might find a small sliver of chocolate along with the orange. A few nuts or berries would also be a special treat. But, if you had been bad -- a piece of charcoal would greet you when you awakened.\n\nWe have four children, three in-law children, and eight grandchildren. I am at a loss as to what to buy for them at Christmas since they already have so much. Christmas Eve is at Nonna and Nonno's house and we open the gifts we are exchanging. We have a very large living room that is so filled with Christmas packages that we can hardly move. I often think of my mother who had made for herself a little straw doll which as a child she cherished. She often told me that she dreamed of having a little piece of fabric to make a little dress for the doll. How much we have to be grateful for those men and women who left their homes for far away places who deprived themselves of luxuries to save every penny, so that we would have a better life than they.\n\nLet us remember those immigrants as we sit at our overladen tables and beautifully decorated trees at Christmas and thank il Re Del Cielo for their courage and foresight.\n\nFrom Bob Russo - 13 Dec 96:\n\nFather Carrillo, a missionary priest from Bari visited our town last week, and provided the following information:\n\nThe legend of La Befana is quaint. She is a very old and bent woman dressed all in black. Her hair is long and straggly, her nose is hooked, and she rides a broomstick. The legend tells how the custom of giving presents at Christmas began.\n\nAccording to Fr. Carrillo, th legend says the three wise men visited her on their journey to Bethlehem in search of the Holy Christ Child. They asked her to accompany them but she said she was too busy. Later, after changing her mind, La Befana goes off on her own to find the Child. She continues to wander about Italy and at the Epiphany (January 6, when the Wise Men finally found the Christ Child), begins rewarding good children while cheating those who deserve punishment for their misdeeds. That's why in Italy, children receive their gifts on the Feast of the Epiphany (from La Befana) rather than from St. Nicholas(Santa Claus) on Christmas as do most of the world's children.\n\nLa Befana is the great gift-bringer in Italy. She comes quietly in inconspicuous garb. For those who are deserving, the reward is candy and gifts in their stockings. But for others, it is either a switch or a piece of coal or both. Fr. Carrilo says parents in Italy today can purchase a commercial candy that resembles pieces of coal.\n\nWas Befana a witch or merely a pre-occupied old lady too greatly encumbered by her own household duties to assist the Wise Men? It is interesting to note, too, that St. Nicolas (accepted by many as the person we recognize as Santa Claus) is buried in Bari. He was born either in Greece or Turkey and was known for giving gifts to the needy.\n\nHopefully this is not a repeat of other La Befana stories already posted on PIE. I thought it interesting and consider it pretty authentic since it came from an Italian priest who is familiar with the legend, and of course, St. Nicholas who is buried in Fr. Carrillo's home town of Bari.\n\nFrom Martin M. Morales\n\nThe following appeared in La Voce Italiana from Houston, Texas in 1993. I thought you would all enjoy it.\n\nCAFONE\n\nA witch on a broomstick isnt usually associated in this country with Christmas, but in Italy, all the buoni ragazzi (good kids) cant wait for old Befana to come riding in on January 6 for lEpifania (the Epifany).\n\nThe average Italian child has been busy writing to this buona strega (good witch), posting the letters in letter mailboxes attached to the presepio (nativity scene) in the piazza. Some of the furbini (little wise guys) know who really delivers the goods and make sure Babbo (Daddy) sees or even gets the letters, just for insurance.\n\nSome believe that Befana is a version of the word Epifania, but apparantly there was also a character with a broom call Befana found on some Etruscan scratchings. The people in remote areas of the Emilia still call on her by that version of the name present or cure malocchio (evil eye). Even la scopa (the broom) is considered against evil.\n\nIn the Christian legend, she was a woman who had lost her husband and son about the same time that the Magi passed through town and asked her to join them. She was so involved in her sweeping (or purification) that she refused. When she finally decided to follow them, she could not find them, and ended up meandering forever with her broom and small sack of gifts, giving them out to kids like you (I hope.)\n\nIn the paesi (towns), groups of men will dress up like old ladies, just as soon as they get off work, to participate in the strange ritual associated with Befana. Wearing old dresses and carrying brooms, guitars and mandolins, their heads wrapped in kerchiefs and cigars in their mouths, they march up to the door of a neighbor and begin to sing:\n\nToca a voi, padrondi casa,\n\nAmandarci la figiola,\n\nCon una bell grembolata.\n\n(The head of the household has a duty,\n\nTo send his daughter to us,\n\nSend her alone down to us,\n\nWith an apron full of booty.)\n\nAt this point, the neighbor should open the door and offer the carolers some wine, cookies, oranges, and other little edibles. Sometimes, however, there are those who do not want to play. In these cases, the singers sing:\n\nSu, venite, buona gente,\n\nSon venute le Befan.\n\n(Come on, and be good sports,\n\nThe Befane have come to you.)\n\nIf that doesnt do it, they end the chorus with:\n\nO figliaci di puttene,\n\nTi pigliasse un accidente!\n\nOftentimes they are accompanied by their children, who carry panierini (little baskets) with which to receive the little gifts themselves. At night, their stockings will be hung to receive other little gifts, which also can appear in their panierini. The little diavoli (devils) can expect carbone e cenere (coal and ashes) and in some cases its even mixed with good stuff. Dipende (it depends.)\n\nFrom Patricia J. Triaca:\n\nYour post on La Befana seems most accurate from what I had been told about the custom from my father. He lived in Italy, Calamecca/Pistoia from the time he was 6 until he was l6. The custom must have travelled through all of Italy as Calamecca is in the Tuscan Apennines. He never remembers a Santa Claus as custom in Italy at the time he was growing up. Presents from the Befana did come on the 12th day and we always had a \"Little Christmas\" celebration at our house in honor of La Befana. There is also a cookie called Befana, very thin, almost like a sand tart, does anybody have the recipe? Would love to have it. Christmas trees were not a custom at all in my father's youth and I remember my paternal grandmother always being a bit shocked at people wanting to have a tree in the house! As my father was gravely ill this past summmer, his last memories were of La Befana and he kept speaking to me (in Italian) about it. So I think he was having happy memories!\n\nFrom Bob Collins:\n\nIn the following, from 'Christ Stopped at Eboli' by Carlo Levi, the author, who is a prisoner of the Mussolini regime, describes a Christmas moment in the Basilicata mountain village of Gagliano:\n\n\"It was Christmas Eve and the forsaken land was piled high with snow. The wind carried the funereal tolling of the church bell, which seemed to come down from the sky. From every doorway good wishes and blessings were called down upon my head as I went by. Bands of children made their last rounds with a cupi-cupi [primitive noisemaker], and the peasants and their women took gifts to the gentry. Here the ancient custom prevails that the poor pay homage to the wealthy; their gifts are received as a matter of course and are not reciprocated. I, too, on Christmas Eve, had to accept bottles of oil and wine, eggs and baskets of dried figs; the donors were surprised that I did not treat them as well deserved tributes, but tried to evade them or at least make some simple return.\n\nWhat strange sort of gentleman was I, not to countenance the reversal of the story of the Three Wise Men, but rather to welcome those who came to my house empty-handed?\"\n\nCiao and Buon Natale\n\nFrom John Monzo:\n\nDoes anyone have any stories about La Befana? I remember as a young child my Grandmother would dress up as La Befana and give out gifts to all the grandchildren.\n\nI have not seen anything like this since my childhood and I guess as the older generation passed on so did the tradition of Befana in the U.S. I know that it is still alive and well in Italy since all of my relatives who still live there tell me about it.\n\nI have a small Befana doll that my relatives sent back with my wife the last time she visited them in Italy and we have it out all year round in our house.\n\nI live in South Philadelphia in a largely populated Italian neighborhood but you still do not see anything relating to Befana around the Feast of the Epiphany.\n\nWhen I visited my family in Italy 4 years ago I was there during the month of January. So it was prime time for the visit of La Befana. I noticed in the candy shop windows that they sold \"carbone\" or black rock candy that actually looked just like pieces of coal. It was a very interesting time to be there and see all of my little cousins eagerly awaiting the visit of La Befana.\n\nBuon Anno A Tutti\n\nFrom Lou Alfano:\n\nEgregi PIEsani: In reading the messages about La Befana and the mention of Babbo Natale, let\n\nme offer my 2 cents' worth:\n\nI believe that La Befana is the indiginous Italian Christmas time gift-giver, while Babbo Natale is merely an italianization of the British Father Christmas (the name translates as \"Daddy (or Father) Christmas\").\n\nLa Befana is a personification of the \"spirit of the Epiphany\" and can almost be considered a nickname for \"Epifania,\" the proper Italian word for epiphany. This is quite fitting for a gift-giver since the Feast of the Epiphany commemorates the visit of the Magi (or 3 Wise Men) to the infant Jesus, with their gifts of gold, frankinsence, and myrrh. The Magi were named Balthazar, Melchior, and Gaspar, according to tradition.\n\nVIVA LA FAMIGLIA!\n\nFrom Lorenzo Calvelli (Venice, Italy):\n\nDid you know this ?\n\nLa Befana vien di notte\n\ncon le scarpe tutte rotte\n\ncol vestito alla \"romana\"\n\nviva viva la Befana !!\n\nPorta cenere e carboni\n\nai bambini cattivoni\n\nai bambini belli e buoni\n\nporta chicchi e tanti doni !\n\nFrom Louis Alfano:\n\nI did not know this poem before. Thank you for sharing it with us all, and adding to our knowledge of the legend of La Befana. A rough translation into English would be:\n\nLa Befana comes at night\n\nIn tattered shoes\n\nDressed in the Roman style\n\nLong live la Befana!!\n\nShe brings cinders and coals\n\nTo the naughty children\n\nTo the good children\n\nShe brings sweets and lots of gifts.\n\nWhen I was a child in Brooklyn, New York, the grandson of Italian immigrants, I was told that Santa Claus would bring me coal if I was a bad little boy. I wonder if this idea originated in the legend of La Befana, or if bad children around the world are all told that they will get coals and cinders for Christmas.\n\nVIVA LA FAMIGLIA!\n\nFrom Lorenzo Calvelli (Venice, Italy):\n\nOn Sat, 6 Jan 1996, JOHN MONZO wrote: \"That is a real nice little poem. Where did you get it from?\"\n\nI've just heard it since I was a child every January 6th, along with this \"ninna nanna\" (lullaby):\n\nNinna nanna, ninna oh,\n\nquesto bimbo a chi lo do ?\n\nLo daro' alla Befana,\n\nche lo tenga una settimana.\n\nLo daro' all'Uomo Nero,\n\nche lo tenga un anno intero.\n\n[...]\n\nLo daro' alla sua mamma,\n\nche gli faccia far la nanna !\n\nBest Greetings\n\nFrom Bob Fanelli:\n\nFor those of you with kids or grandchildren, there's a good picture book by Tomie dePaola, \"The Legend of Old Befana\", Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1980. dePaola is a great children's illustrator, who seems to be particularly fond of drawing old Italian ladies. He did another, very funny series about a witch, Strega Nona, as well as other Italian legends.\n\nI enjoyed the various postings about Befana, but couldn't track down that reference to Etruscan Befana images. It may be that people have seen Etruscan drawings of a person with a broom and interpreted them to be Befana. There may be a good reason, too. The Etruscan were fond of depicting demons and such, and from what others have alluded to here, Befana was not simply a good, toy-dispensing witch. She was also seen as someone to be scared of - the bringer of ill fortune.\n\nHere is an incantation to drive away bad luck, collected from Tuscany in the late 19th century. It may well be that these people inherited their folk religion from their ancestors who lived in the same place, the Etruscans.\n\n\"Take frankincense, both of the best and the inferior kind, also cummin seed. Have ready a new scaldino, which is kept only for this purpose. And should it happen that affairs of any kind go badly, fill the scaldino (or earthen fire-dish) with glowing coals, then take three pinches of best incense and three of the second quality, and put them all 'in fila', in a row, on the threshold of the door. Then take the rest of your incense and the cummin, and put it into the burning coal, and carry it about, and wave it over the bed and in every corner, saying:-\n\nIn nome del cielo!\n\nDelle stelle e della luna!\n\nMi levo questo mal d'occhio\n\nPer mia maggior' fortuna!\n\nBefania! Befania! Befania!\n\nChe mi date mal d'occhio maladetta sia\n\nBefania! Befania! Befania!\n\nChi mi ha dato il maldocchio\n\nMe lo porta via\n\nE maggior fortuna\n\nMi venga in casa mia!\n\n(In the name of heaven\n\nAnd of the stars and moon,\n\nMay this trouble change\n\nTo better fortune soon!\n\nBefania! Befania! Befania!\n\nShould this deed be thine;\n\nBefania! Befania! Befania!\n\nTake it away, bring luck, I pray,\n\nInto this house of mine!)\n\nThen when all is consumed in the scaldino, light the little piles of incense on the threshold of the door, and go over it three times, and spit behind you over your shoulder three times, and say:-\n\nBefania! Befania! Befania!\n\nChi me ha dato maldocchio!\n\nMe lo porta via!\n\n(Befania! Befania!\n\nBefania! I say,\n\nSince thou gavest this bad luck,\n\nCarry it away!)\n\nThen pass thrice backwards and forwards before the fire, spitting over the left shoulder, and repeating the same incantation.\"\n\n-from \"Etruscan Magic & Occult Remedies\", Charles Godfrey Leland, University Books, NY, 1963. Sorry for the silly translations, but that's what was written. The author collected folk beliefs in Tuscany, and appears to have believed them himself.\n\nThanks to Martin Morales for that great posting about \"The Befane\", men dressed as Befana who go from door to door begging sweets. That's the first Italian example I've come across of mumming in Italy - a tradition I'm more familiar with in England and Ireland, and - of course - in America. Here it survives in the Mummers' Parade in Philadelphia, held on New Year's Day, and in the kids who come knocking on Halloween. Anybody have any first-hand examples or family traditions?"
