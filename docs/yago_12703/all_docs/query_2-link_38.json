The moody Bracco, Huschke von Hanstein (he will kill me for saying it), robbed like so many others of his best years by the War. Ernie McAfee....who knows how far he could have gone. Masten Gregory.

So many drivers have had the essential elements of greatness but have missed out for reasons of personality (a book could be written on that alone), finances, accidents, or just opportunity.\n\nYou could say much the same about Pete Lyons of course, another of the greats, but now we have Mark Hughes, what more do you want?"
