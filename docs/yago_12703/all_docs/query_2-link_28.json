        "text": "thanks for the continued feedback!\n\nshadowmaster: well, you might… I’ve itching to make him move but I may not have time for a little while.\n\nfeureau: thanks! nope, no displacements… I just exported the sDiv level that held up the silhouette enough to not need one, and used normal maps for the internal detail. The rendered mesh is about 350k. So not ‘light’, and for rigging/animation purposes it would be wiser to export lower res meshes and use displacements… so if I do rig/animate him I may end up going in that direction.\n\nboozy floozie: thank you! I was happy that he did end up pretty much being locked onto the original sketch… main reason I spent the time doing the base mesh in Maya instead of banging it out in Zbrush.\n\ncoolkonrad: thank you… I kept the pose from the sketch… I actually did a ‘quickrig’ on him to pose him, but in the end I liked him rigid.\n\nScott Spencer: dude… thanks! yeah… I agree on the sounds he would make.\n\nSantis: Thank you.\n\niatriki: thats cool… glad you like the modeling.\n\nsavagliani: being compared to Brom is a compliment that I take with much humility as he is definitely one of my artistic heroes. When he was at Gnomon a few months ago presenting at our GW live event I was definitely giddy. We should perhaps put the presentation he did online. We did record the entire weekend. His presentation was awesome and surprisingly, very funny!\n\nwell, thanks everyone! I’m very happy to hear these comments.\n\n-Alex\n\nhey alex really like the concept gives the eary feeling down your spine and i will be waiting for the making of it i have to say thank you for all that you have done with gnomon because it has helped me so much in learning 3d graphics and is really responsible for getting me into the world of 3d i still have your zbrush 2 head dvd which helped me alot also when first starting to learn zbrush and also it would be kind of cool if you could post footage of more gnomon events i know i would apprciate it greatly and im sure other people would as well especially for those of us who cant go maybey post some of the zbrush usergroups footage if you could i would love to see what goes on durring them but i just needed thank you you personaly for bringing me into to the realm of 3d most of all and for the inspiration.\n\nTHANK YOU ALEX!!\n\nI think it’s great that even before I see your name on the piece, I can tell you created it. Awesome work, great style, thanks for sharing and congrats on top row!\n\nwow Alex, to see Brom workshop would great too!! for us that live outside the US its our only chance to see him and the live workshops…very few artists have that unique style as Brom has. What a mind!!! I guess we both have this strange taste for the bizarre…d\n\nand here a wish list for Gnomon:\n\nDamien Canderle, Mastering Shading and Sculpting\n\nRik Baker, ZBrush and Modo, Creepy Zbrushing\n\nSébastien Legrain, Organic and Mecanical Combs\n\nJeremy Engleman- Live Figure Sculpting with ZBrush\n\nAlex Alvarez, Jester from sketch to render\n\nBrom, Inside the Mind of a True Genius…wow…that would be so great…its it finished, Jester?..thanks bye\n\nI really like this creation, but I would love to see an animation. A nice slow camera move with your character twiching in a disturbing manor.\n\nWicked\n\nVery cool Alex! I like this a lot ! I think you got his legs on backwards though:)\n\nC’mon Rick… we ALL know the upper torso’s back-to-front… not the legs\n\nFantastic stuff Alex!!.. and further spoilt: a post from your girlfriend too!\n\nVery nice concept and sculpting\n\nChris\n\nI like it but it would look alot better if you posed it, which in ZB3 should take all of about 15 minutes…\n\nAnyways, thank you for your great Gnomon videos, I’ve learned so much from you since way back when you guys used to use VHS.\n\n-Cheers\n\nHi Alex.Your Work Always Goooood\n\npretty cool concept.\n\nYou are My Master.I Learn Everything In maya And ZBrush With Your DvD Learning…\n\nAwesome!!\n\nI’d love to see how this guy move.\n\nPerhaps it’d solve the forward-backward enigma a bit\n\nGreat job, and thanks for the tip!!\n\nOriginal idea for a special character Alex , neat concept design and the model looks great even in ZBrush without the textures, and yes your tutorials always adding more and more information for artists from different levels, thanks.\n\ngood luck with more creative work.\n\nHEY Alex!\n\nMy name is Alex as well and i just wanted to let you know that i have been following your various tutorials online and they are great, you explain everything in a precise manner where a novie and an intermediate user can understand. I just recently purchased the Making of Jester tutorial package from gnomonology.com and i must say it’s great!! It is inspires me to create characters and use the workflow that you use. Even though i consider myself an intermediate user of Maya and Zbrush i still find new things i did not know about the softwares, thanks for the little tips. So to all the members of the community i would greatly recommend The Making of Jester tutorials which you can find at www.gnomonology.com, there are also many other usefull tutorials on the website which i find very interesting.\n\nAlex i want to thank you and all the instructors at Gnomon personally for putting your time into these tutorials, you are helping the community a lot, kepe up the good work!!!\n\nHey Alex!\n\nGreat work man, i just got the tutorials on the Making of Jester, i love your workflow and how you explanations. I love the fact the you sticked to the sketch, it looks identical. i highly recommend the tutorials which can be found at www.gnomonology.com it is very inspiring.\n\nAlex thank you for these tutorials, hopefully there are more to come, keep up the great work!!!\n\nHi Alex;\n\nLots of positive feedback here for you\n\nHowever, I’m curious as to why you decided to leave the ‘stretched UV’s’ in the foreground (a design decision perhaps?) It just looks ‘wrong’ to me…\n\nMaybe all will made abundantly clear in your DVD - but an answer here would VERY much appreciated\n\nThank you!\n\nChris\n\nthanks soooo much everyone! I’m very happy to hear the positive feedback about the tutorial as well.\n\nAtwooki: Nope, not a design decision. I put a 2k texture on the platform when it should be 4k. Something I’m fixing for a big print that I’m doing. Just a dumb decision when I chose a resolution for that texture.\n\n-Alex\n\ni always love seeing this kind of tutorials, because they give more insight as well as understanding on the workflow that goes into a still like this. being given wip-screenshots makes you see so much more details that you’d probably miss just looking at the end result. great work Alex, keep’m coming"
