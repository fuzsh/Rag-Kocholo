I don't know when I first became interested in the theatre. As a youngster I built miniature stages and wrote plays for cardboard actors. One of my first writings accepted for publication was an immature play appropriately named Nothing Doing. Then when I went to Chile in 1917 I found the theatre the best place to brush up on spoken Spanish; so I started writing about plays and translating them. I began accumulating plays and critical works into a collection that now fills thirty-five feet of shelf space and numbers a thousand volumes. From that to an acquaintance with Latin American playwrights and actors was a short step. After I had written several series of articles about the South American stage, Pedro de Andrea of Mexico asked me to compile a Breve historia del teatro latinoamericano (1956), the first general work to cover the whole Latin American theatrical scene. Behind Spanish American Footlights is the pioneer attempt to survey in English the same ground, and over a period of nearly five centuries. It makes use of notes accumulated during forty years, in visits to almost all of the countries, the latest in 1958. Too frequently a historian of the theatre, looking for a play known to have been written, comes upon the blank wall of \"inédita? And almost as frequently, none of the few printed copies has survived. I searched Asunción for copies of three plays proclaimed the best of the early twentieth century. Neither libraries nor families of the authors could provide even one. All a critic can do to evaluate such work is to depend on contemporary accounts, always a dangerous procedure. Biographical details also present problems in countries where bibliographical accuracy is not always practiced. Not only did the birth and death of early writers go unrecorded, but even the dates of\n\nviii\n\nForeword\n\ncontemporaries frequently present difficulties. Two different birthdates of one writer, in histories\" of literature, were corrected by the author himself and by his son with two new dates. One authoress told me her real age but added that, as a friend, I ought not to object to postdating her birth three or four years. Even the dates of writing and producing plays may differ, according to sources. Authentic corrections, therefore, will be welcomed. My findings could be presented in several ways. One would be a consideration of trends, which would merely retrace the progress of the theatres in Europe and in the United States that have served as inspiration to the playwrights in Latin America. Another would be the listing of only the outstanding dramatists. Following that procedure, the Chilean theatrical history, for instance, could be summed up on a page, listing Daniel Barros Grez and perhaps Daniel Caldera of the nineteenth century, and Antonio Acevedo Hernández, Armando Moock, and Germán Luco Cruchaga of the first half of the twentieth century. That procedure would provide a cursory survey, since most of Chile's other dramatists are antiquated and, for the most part, disregarded even by lecturers on the theatre in their native Chile. I have chosen to assemble the names of the earlier and the minor playwrights too and to tell something about their productions. So I have tried to provide a fairly complete picture and to offer guidance to those who may wish to explore further. And I have proceeded similarly with all the other countries, beginning in the far south and journeying northward geographically to the Río Grande. I hope the details provided will offer more pleasant reading than merely a catalog of writers and plays. Miami University Oxford, Ohio\n\nW. K.

To cover the theatrical efforts of nineteen nations over a period of 475 years is a big task. Only by borrowing from the results of previous groundbreaking by others can one person do it. John Milton described the process in his Brief Historie of Moscovia: \"What was scattered in many volumes, with no cursory pains I have laine together to save the Reader a far longer travaile.\" Many who pioneered in the study of Spanish American drama are still alive. They have been most generous with their aid. José Juan Arrom of Yale and Harvey L. Johnson of Indiana have sent me copies of their many writings and useful suggestions and criticisms. I think of a rainy Saturday when with Mariano Latorre and Ricardo Latcham I combed the secondhand book stores of Santiago in search of out-of-print copies of Chilean plays and critical works; of the packages of books from Juan Bautista Devoto of Argentina containing plays he thought I ought to know, and of his guidance among actors and dramatists during my two weeks' stay in his country; of Raúl Castagnino of Buenos Aires and Guillermo Ugarte Chamorro of Lima, generously sharing with me the treasures of their drama collections. Walter Rela was an invaluable cicerone during my stay in Uruguay, as were Juan Carlos Sabat Pebet and Fernán Silva Valdés; and Dr. Américo Abad cast his eyes on what I later wrote about Uruguayan theatrical activity. Dr. José Chioino made much easier my investigations in Peru. The active new generation in Chile was no less hospitable. Nené Aguirre, instructor in a course on the Chilean Theatre, turned over to me her lecture notes, and read in early form my chapters on Chile, as did Orlando Rodríguez. Hugo Miller and Tito Heiremans spent a morning discussing the activities of their group, and Gabriela Roepke supplied me with a file of theatre programs. Enrique Gajardo Velás-\n\nχ\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nquez loaded me down with mimeograph versions of many of the best Chilean contemporary plays, and mailed a second instalment to me a year later. In Asunción, Josefina Pla put at my disposal her unpublished study of the Paraguayan theatre and helped out my faulty Guaraní so that the chapter on Paraguay's Indian theatre might be completed. She assembled actors and dramatists at a picnic with me, and later did me the honor to translate part of what I wrote into Spanish, for local publication. Franklin Domínguez shared with me his knowledge of theatrical activities in the Dominican Republic, provided me with copies of practically all the published drama of his country, and later took time to see that I remained close to the truth in what I wrote. René Marques was a delightful host at a party of drama lovers at his home in San Juan after our day of visiting theatres and playwrights. Then he generously read what I wrote about the Puerto Rican theatre after my return to the United States. The aid of Rafael Pineda was invaluable in assaying the position of drama in Venezuela. Armando Maria y Campos has for years shared with me his helpful volumes on phases of Mexico's theatrical history, and Demetrio Aguilera Malta has been my guide, philosopher, and friend for even longer in everything pertaining to the culture of Ecuador. There have been many others, each contributing something. Even from Castro's Cuba have come magazines and books to bring the Cuban picture up to date. A number of Central American officials have generously briefed me upon their countries' theatrical progress. Finally, Miami University, in providing me with typing assistance, occasional reductions in teaching load, and a grant to spend the summer of 1958 visiting the Latin American theatrical centers, has encouraged me to complete something begun forty years ago. To all who helped in this concoction, my gratitude. For errors still remaining in it they are not responsible. The cook who combines the ingredients gets the blame as well as the credit. As I have benefited from the work of many who preceded me, I hope that others will build on this work, so that a definitive study worthy of the growing Spanish American theatre will eventually take form.

Even more is needed to produce great dramatists. Scratch a Latin American and you will find a poet. Poets need no long period of apprenticeship, no prolonged concentration to write an intuitive poem that can be reproduced by hand for general distribution, or published in a newspaper or magazine, frequently founded by the writer and lasting for a couple of issues. To write an acceptable play, however, requires some acquaintance with the technique of drama, as well as persistence during a relatively extended period of uninterrupted writing time. And that is only the beginning. Before he can get a public, the playwright must find either money to publish it or people to perform it. Since all these essentials are so rarely present at the same time, it is easy to understand why Latin America has not yet produced a dramatist equal to the quartet of Spain's Golden Age. After all, the death of Calderón in 1681 left some four thousand other practicing dramatists in Spain. It is doubtful if in all the period of the Spanish American theatre that many people have been ambitious to become a second Calderón. But that need not mean there is no drama south of the Río Grande. Certainly the head of an Argentine university was wrong sometime ago in answering the suggestion for a course on Latin American literature with the declaration that there was no such thing. The poetry of the New World, where modernism started, has long pleased and influenced writers abroad. Readers have even found an epic or two to compare with those of the rest of the world. More recent has been the discovery of excellent short stories and novels, beginning with the jungle tales, that are unmistakably Latin American. And so a number of studies of Latin American literature have already appeared, beginning in 1896 with Manuel Poncelis' Literatura hispanoamericana. In 1916 Alfred Coester pioneered with Literary History of Spanish\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nAmenca in English, and by 1945 Julio A. Leguizamón needed two volumes and 1,417 pages to cover the field. To most scholars, however, the Spanish American theatre has been an orphan child. Literary historians have long been content with a nod at Uruguay's Florencio Sánchez and the comment that he exerted no influence abroad and very little at home. True, no one seriously claims superiority in world drama for Latin America. It has the flaws of youth. Its playwrights are sometimes childish or pompous, and often excited by ideas already threadbare. Its theatre still struggles against handicaps. National poverty and a lack of concentrated populations and socially minded audiences to inspire dramatists help to explain why the writers so often turn out unfinished plays with undigested ideas. England and Spain, during their theatrical Golden Ages, had leisure and the impetus of excited patriotism. The United States, when its theatre began developing, did not have to meet the competition with the movies that faced Latin American playwrights when the theatre to the south first really tried to achieve maturity. However these are no reasons to ignore drama in our neighboring continent. Signs of life do exist. The sporadic folk theatre, from the carpas of Mexico to the circus pantomimes of Argentina, gives evidence of development. An increasing number of pleasant comedies and powerful tragedies are also being produced. The rising curtain often signals the treatment of a timely social problem. Several comedies have had as many as a thousand performances; one gaucho play was produced three thousand times, and a Mexican musical comedy can boast ten thousand performances. Though this may not prove quality, at least it indicates activity. There is no \"typical Spanish American play\" any more than there is an \"average Latin American.\" Any uniformity is too often the result of the many aping one European or North American success. One could logically, perhaps, expect many plays about Indians or revolutions, themes that have inspired excellent Latin American novels. But the Indians' patient and unresisting acceptance for centuries of the white man's civilization has left them too stolid to make good subjects for drama. What an Indian feels may be studied in a psychological novel; what he does is to suffer in silence, and dramas are not composed of silences. Nor do revolutions, despite the common North American impression, provide subjects for comedies. Even in\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nan Argentine farce like \"Juan de Dios, Soldier and Countryman\" by Pico and González Pacheco, a revolution is regarded merely as a change in yokes, and the attempt to synthesize a revolution in the life of a character or two has never been very successful. The pages of this study will show that Spanish American drama grew from Spanish seed. Pre-Columbian Indian spectacles had litde effect on early white dramatists. But New World drama did not long merely copy Spain. The Peninsular stage followed an evolutionary pattern; in America, however, the classical and romantic strata are not easily separated. Many literary movements existed at the same time. So the Spanish American theatre did lead an independent existence. Why did no world-amazing dramatists emerge, such as those produced by tiny Norway? The answer might be found in Spanish history where after the advent of a quartet of great playwrights during the Golden Age two centuries went by before Spain had another renaissance of the theatre. When Lope and Calderón were evolving, the embryonic New World dramatists had neither the time nor the theatres to perfect their techniques. Then while Madrid's dramatists became inbred imitating Lope, and brought on the cultural decline of the eighteenth century, the ingenios of Lima and Mexico were imitating the imitators. Certainly the breaking of new ground in the theatre of Spain with the coming of romanticism in 1833 helped produce a new generation of noteworthy dramatists, and today increased independence is evident in South America, too. Not many playwrights yet may challenge O'Neill and Arthur Miller, but at least many are becoming national. Their quality is improving. If the stage is a mirror of nature, one important way of learning about Latin American life and customs is to study its drama. A person need not shut his eyes to the attraction of a flower garden just because there are no breathtaking, prize-winning blooms in it. Much that is striking and interesting and even charming is to be found by those who roam among the variegated offerings of Spanish American dramatists. True, some of the earlier plays seem artificial to modern tastes. The grandiloquence, for instance, of Olmedo's characters is objectionable unless the reader has some knowledge of Spanish American history and cultural background. To the Ecuadorians of the 1830's Olmedo's flowery speeches were as much to be admired as is an operatic aria of today, and they were presented in much the\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nsame way. Plays and playwrights must be studied against their period and background. And if some of the plays even today reveal dramatists unacquainted with the mechanics of the stage and the frailties of the actors, a reader must remember the difficulties they face in finding opportunities to watch their work in rehearsals and before audiences. Until given presentation, their plays are only something lying flat on a printed page, if indeed they have been lucky enough to get beyond the manuscript version. However, the quickening tempo of dramatic activity south of the Río Grande gives hopes that playwrights will be increasingly able to discover their shortcomings through actual performances. The curtain seems to be rising on the Spanish American theatre.\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nPre-Columbian Drama ín America\n\nIf no great dramas were produced in the New World before the arrival of Columbus, that is no surprise. Even in Spain, as will be seen in the next chapter, the popular theatre did not come into being until years after the caravels of Columbus had set sail. But the earliest white visitors to America saw and described evidences of PreColumbian drama there. 1 Cortés, in his Second Letter to Charles V, while describing the punishment of a thief, mentions un como teatro in the market place of Tenochtitlán (Mexico City) on which a crier stood while giving details of the crime. Aroused by his words, the crowd attacked the criminal and beat him to death. In his Third Letter, Cortés describes the stage in more detail as being \"fecho de cal y canto, cuadrado, de altura de dos estados y medio [about fourteen feet], y de esquina a esquina había treinta pasos.\" On it the representadores stood to be seen by all in the plaza.2 While it no longer survives here, a primitive theatre is still visible near Cuzco, Peru. What took place on this platform? No records have been found of the steps in the development of an Indian drama, but from the evolution in ancient Greece one can surmise. First came religious dances that eventually turned into pantomimes. Then, as in the case of Argentina circus performances in the nineteenth century, dialog was provided. This is as far as the Indians had progressed, with dialogs about gods and tribal heroes, when the Spaniards arrived. The Aztecs called them mitotes, from 1 For more details, see José Juan Arrom, \"Raíces indígenas del teatro americano,\" Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Congress of Americanists, II, 299-305. See also Harvey L. Johnson, \"Noticias dadas por Tomás Gage,\" Revista Iberoamericana, VIII, No. 16 (November, 1944), 269-271, n.20; and Arrom, El teatro de Hispanoamérica en la época colonial, pp. 13-35. 2 José J. Rojas Garcidueñas, El teatro de Nueva España en el Siglo XVI, p. 23. Arrom, \"Raíces indígenas,\" Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Congress, p. 15, has a picture of its restoration. He also, p. 28, pictures the theatre near Cuzco, Peru.\n\n4\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\nthe Náhuatl mitotl, \"a dance.\" The Caribbean Indians referred to them as areitos, from the Arahuaco aririn, \"to recite.\" With justice, therefore, did the chronicler Fernández de Oviedo (1479-1557) refer to them as \"singing dances.\"3 The mid-sixteenth-century Códice Ramírez* supposedly written by Juan de Tovar (1543-1626), uses the phrase gracioso entremés in describing a performance in the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, in Cholula, that took place on a stage somewhat more elaborate than the one in Cortés' account, since it was decorated with arches and flowers. Padre José de Acosta (1539-1600), a chronicler of colonial times from Mexico to Peru, quoted part of the Códice Ramírez account, here translated: This temple had a fair-sized patio where in festival days there were dances and pastimes and amusing short plays for which there existed in the midst of the patio a little theatre, thirty feet square and whitewashed, attractively decorated with branches and flowers . . . where the people gathered after banqueting. The players came out and presented short plays, pretending to be the deaf, the halt, and the blind, coming to beg the idol to cure them; the deaf answering stupidly, the sick coughing, and the lame limping and complaining about their miseries. All this would make anybody laugh. Some of the players represented reptiles, others beetles, others frogs or lizards, and . . . they played flutes, which pleased the audience greatly... and it all ended in a dance.\"5 Padre Diego Durán (?-1588 ) adds more details as he describes boys, dressed like butterflies, who climbed trees on the stage and were shot at by Indians with blowguns. Finally the Goddess of Roses arrived and disarmed the Indians to protect the birds. 6 Durán tells of other fiestas de danzas y farsas y entremeses y cantares, some with dancing humpbacks, others with drunkards, and servants who pretended deafness when their masters gave them orders. The appearance of the cripples apparently seemed hilarious to the spectators. Certainly all these sound more like pageants than a European3 Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, Historia general y natural de las Indias, Part I, Book V. Chapter 1. 4 Published in Mexico, 1944, pp. 159-161. See Arrom, \"Raíces indígenas,\" Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Congress, p. 16; and Luis Leal, \"El Códice Ramírez,\" Historia mexicana, III, 11-33. 5 José de Acosta, Historia natural y moral de las índias, Book V, Chapter 30. 6 Diego Durán, Historia de las Indias de Nueva España, II, 231. This dance is also discussed by Angel María Garibay in La poesía indígena de la altiplanicie.\n\nPre-Columbian Drama in America\n\n5\n\nstyle play, for they lack that clash of interest necessary for good drama. Another performance, Turn teleche, described by Rojas Garcidueñas, did provide drama and suspense, at least for the chief actor, though he never took a curtain call. One warrior, tied by his foot to the Temalacatl or sacrificial stone, fought against a half dozen better-armed opponents, till he was wounded. Then he was laid on the circular stone and his heart was ripped out. Needless to say, the first Catholic priests to witness it forbade any repeat performances.7 Yucatán too had its spectacles. Fray Diego de Landa (1524-1579) found at Chichén Itzá \"two small, tiled platforms with four stairways, on which farces and comedies are said to have been performed for the entertainment of the people,\"8 and Padre Sánchez de Aguilar, also of Yucatán, wrote of the \"farsantes que representaban fábulas e historias antiguas.\"9 Much more has been written about the pre-Columbian theatre of Mexico than of any other nation, but there was activity elsewhere. A Venezuelan, Gilberto Antolinez, recently found what he believes to be a modernization of another ancient Andean Indian ritual, changed, but not destroyed by the white man's religion.10 Flagellation formed part of it, as well as enactment of the birth and death of vegetation. He considers the performance that he saw a degeneration of what was originally a dramatization of the legend of Yurupari, including his birth, his education, his murder by the parents of those killed for eating the fruit of the tree Wakú, and his resurrection and ascent to the skies by means of a palm tree. The play preceded his ceremonial worship. In this aboriginal play Antolinez saw tragedy and comedy as it epitomized Indian life—lively, but serious as befitting a people that rarely smile, and serving as release for the group sense of fear. This last, if true, aligns it with the Greek idea of katharsis. In Uyumbichu, Ecuador, a rural school successfully presented some of these rituals in 1941, modernized and with the pagan religious elements omitted. Farther south the Indians of the High Andes, according to the first explorers, were found to have constructed large corrales ( as the 7\n\nRojas Garcidueñas, El teatro de Nueva España, pp. 29-31. Diego de Landa, Relación de las cosas de Yucatán, p. 120. 9 Arrom, \"Raíces indígenas,\" Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Congress, p. 26. 10 Gilberto Antolinez, \"El teatro, institución de los Muku y Jirajara,\" Revista de Cultura, No. 56 (May, 1946), 113-129. 8\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\n6\n\nSpaniard called their innyard theatres) with high walls, in which to worship (mochar) their \"false trinity,\"11 One of the Spanish priests, Cieza de León (1518-1560), writes of large theatres with gradas (bleachers) where the Inca and his princes went to worship in a five-day-long festival that included taquis (perhaps dramatic songs or sketches, from Quechua taki, \"a song\"). The Quechuaspeaking mestizo Juan Santa Cruz Pachacuti, who knew Spanish well enough to understand the significance of what he wrote, told how the Inca Huascar ordered a hundred Indian llamallamas (which Arrom, in quoting him, translates as \"grotesquely masked actors\") to perform sus comedias in the plaza of Pomapampa. 12 The Indian terms for some of the actors, as set down by the earlyseventeenth-century Felipe Poma,13 imply that they did more than sing religious chants. He wrote that both the civilized Indians of Huancavilca and the jungle Indians of the Yungas had their farsas y fiestas, and mentioned the sanca-rimac ( one who says gay things ) and the sanca chicuy asichicuj (clown who makes people laugh). 14 Juan Polo (?-1575), a trained lawyer, pointed out the parallel between performances in honor of the Inca Feast of Intiraymi, with its dances, dialogs, and songs, and the observance of the Christian Corpus Christi.15 And scholars continue to debate the significance of details, set down by the sixteenth-century Peruvian mestizo Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1558-1616), in his Comentarios reales que tratan del origen de los Incas (1609). Using information obtained from his Inca princess mother and his aunts, he reported (Book 2, Chapter 27 ), after he had lived in Spain and had seen comedies and tragedies in Madrid theatres: The amantas, who were the philosophers, were skilled at composing comedies and tragedies that on solemn feast days were performed before the rulers and their guests at court. The actors were not base-born, but 11\n\nColección de documentos inéditos del Archivo de Indias, III, 14-15; Arrom, \"Raíces indígenas,\" Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Congress, p. 28. 12 Juan Santa Cruz Pachacuti, Relación de antigüedad deste regno del Perú, ρ. 210; Arrom, \"Raíces indígenas,\" Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Congress, p. 30. 13 Felipe Huamán Poma de Ayala, El primer nueva crónica y buen gobierno, p. 331. 14 Arrom, \"Raíces indígenas,\" Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Congress, p. 30 n. 15 Juan Polo de Ondegardo, Información acerca de la religión y gobierno de los Incas, pp. 21-22.\n\nPre-Columbian Drama in America\n\n7\n\nIncas and noble lords and children of governors, and the governors themselves, and war leaders, even to the commanders, in order that the dramas might be properly performed, since they dealt with military deeds, triumphs, and victories, with the deeds and grandeur of dead kings and of other heroic men. The plots of comedies dealt with agriculture and homey and familiar things . . . They never performed shameful, vile or low entremeses; all dealt with serious and honorable affairs. And those who performed well received jewels and gifts. Of course, all these accounts are colored by the prejudices of the writers. For one thing, most of them were scornful of \"those backward pagans.\" For another, they knew the nomenclature of the theatre in Spain and frequently used that vocabulary for things that were not the same at all, because they knew no other term to use. Arrom points out one chronicler's misleading description of llamas as \"sheep of the land,\" and guinea pigs as \"Indian rabbits.\" 16 Cortés described the Aztec temples as \"mosques.\" So the dramatic forms of the New World called \"comedy,\" \"tragedy,\" and \"farce\" were not always the equivalent of the Peninsular drama. And \"theatre,\" with its connotations of stage, audience, actors, and written play with clash of interests, could certainly not be used to cover all these Indian performances. Some have been so classified, however. For years scholars believed that the play Ollanta17 (or Ollantay) in the Quechua language represented something authentically Incan, preserved by oral tradition until the white man came to write it down.

Olivares, Poesía dramática de los incas. Ricardo Rojas, Un titán de los Andes, makes a study of the legend from its beginning to his own Ollantay of 1939. For summary and discussion in English, see E. C. Hills, \"The Quechua Drama 'Oitenta',\" Romanic Review, V ( 1914 ), reprinted in Hills, Hispanic Studies, pp. 47-105. Jesús Lara, La poesía quechua, pp. 58-60 and 95-111, arguing for a Quechua original of Ollantay, mentions and summarizes three others that he calls \"pre-Columbian plays distorted by Spanish missionaries.\"\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\n8\n\nous colors, while it could represent mathematical information, could not transmit literature. Some reference books still call Ollantay a \"native play.\" The one known performance, directed by Padre Antonio Valdés, priest of Tinta and Sicuani—towns fifty miles southeast of Cuzco—can be roughly dated, because the guest of honor was José Gabriel Condorcanqui, who as Tupac Amarú II claimed the ancient throne of the Incas. The performance, therefore, shortly (Condorcanqui only rebelled in 1780) preceded 1781, when Tupac Amarú II was executed for rebellion against the rule of Spain. Dr. Valdés made no assertion that he was reviving an older play. Others made that claim for him. Clements Markham, who published an English version,18 states in his introduction that Dr. Pablo Justiniani, the Indian who helped translate it, assured him that Valdés had merely set down the dialog as dictated by Indians. In corroboration, a number of versions, apparently earlier, have been discovered since then, one in the Convent of Santo Domingo, another in Sahuaraura. One version bears the date \"Nuestra Señora de La Paz, June 18, 1735,\" years before the birth of Valdês. In their Antigüedades peruanas (1851), Manuel Eduardo Rivero and Juan Diego de Tschudi reported discoveries of still other manuscripts from the seventeenth and even the sixteenth centuries. 19 Historical antecedents have also turned up. Cieza de León described a rebellion of nobles suppressed by the Inca, who magnanimously spared the ringleader and gave him a princess for a wife. The names Ollanta and Ollantay also appear in early chronicles. The inclusion of real people and places motivated the original conviction, expressed by von Tschudi in his 1853 Vienna edition, that Ollanta was an old Inca play recently set down. Some corroboration was provided by José Sebastián Barranca, in his transcription of the Santo Domingo manuscript (Lima, 1868). He labeled both the characters and their customs \"pagan.\" He also declared its Quechua language archaic and free of Spanish neologisms, and said he found no traces of Christianity such as a Spanish priest would have inserted. On the other side, the discoverer of the manuscript in 1816, Val18\n\nC. R. Markham, Ottanta, an Ancient Inca Drama. See also Frances C. Wenrich, Ollanta, an Ancient Peruvian Drama. 19 Arrom, \"Raíces indígenas,\" Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Congress, pp. 192-201, gives a more detailed analysis. For the Cuzco version in Quechua and Spanish, see Ediciones populares del primer Festival del Libro Cuzqueño.\n\nPre-Columbian Drama in America\n\n9\n\ndés' nephew, Narciso Cuentas, a doctor who claimed descent from Túpac Yupanqui, declared it an original composition by his uncle, a statement repeated by José Palacios in his Mundo erudito (1836, Nos. 5-9). Argument from the play itself proves Spanish influence, as a summary will show. The play recounts the rise of Ollanta, an Indian of humble birth, to the command of the Inca armies. In spite of the warnings of his servant Piqui-Chaqui (\"Flea-Foot\") that he will be beheaded, Ollanta aspires to marry Cusi-Coyllur (\"Happy Star\"), daughter of Emperor Pachacutec. The Queen summons dancing girls to entertain the unhappy Princess, who is sure that Ollanta has deserted her. Their idea of comfort is to sing a gloomy yaraví, most ancient of Peruvian poetic forms, describing two loving doves, separated by cruel fate. One finally \"flutters and sinks down dead.\" Daring to ask permission to marry the Princess, Ollanta is so violently refused that in a monolog that is one of the gems of the play, he vows to revolt, and with an army of rebels he captures the city of Cuzco. The act concludes with praise of the Princess by invisible singers. Two of the lines are: A red flower blooms on her face in the midst of snow . . . Her soft neck, smooth as crystal, is white as snow. The beginning of the next act dates the action of the play as 1448 because Pachacutec has just been succeeded on the throne by his son Túpac-Upanqui. The young ruler receives reports that Ollanta's army has defeated his own new general, Rumiñahui, at Ollantatambo, a town still standing thirty-five miles from Cuzco. In the final act, Star's betrayal of her vows as Virgin of the Sun, and the discovery that she and Ollanta have a daughter, Ima-Sumac (\"Beautiful Maiden\"), have brought her imprisonment in the Temple of the Sun. By treachery, Rumiñahui has captured Ollanta. Now appears the first of the many reconciliatory children found in Latin American plays. Twelve-year-old Ima, so lovely that she softens her uncle's heart, wins pardon for both her parents. They all go to the Temple of the Sun to release the Emperor's sister, and after their marriage, since the Inca must make his traditional visits to all parts of his kingdom, he asks Ollanta to replace him temporarily on the throne. In addition to the impossibility of preserving through memory alone for more than two centuries a play of such length, its whole form is that of a Spanish Golden Age product. Indian plays had no\n\n10\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\ndivision into acts. Its basic redondilla with its rhyme was a verse form unknown to them. In small details, too, its Spanish ancestry is revealed. Garcilaso boasted that the Inca theatre dealt with serious affairs and noble characters. But noble characters could never have included the cowardly, deceitful servant, Flea-Foot, who even in his name is a gracioso straight out of a Lope de Vega comedy. And the play is full of Spanish ideology. In a primitive culture that lacked edged weapons, strangling, not beheading, was the common punishment. It seems doubtful, too, that an Indian would compare the neck of his copper-colored sweetheart to snow, as in the verses quoted. On the other hand, Spanish Golden Age lovers often used the \"fire and snow\" compliment. Even greater departure from Indian customs can be found. None but the Inca's blood kin could marry a princess or could rule, even temporarily; yet here was a commoner doing both. The final scene reveals the most flagrant disregard of Inca traditions. The Temple of the Virgins of the Sun was the holiest place in Cuzco. Prescott's Conquest of Peru, Chapter III, cites terrible punishment for any man entering its premises: he was to be strangled and the town from which he came utterly destroyed. Yet not only do the Inca and the Queen go into the sacred precincts to release Star, but many of the nobles and even the common soldiers tag along. Thoughtful reasoning from the play, therefore, indicates that Padre Valdés, or some other man well acquainted with the Quechua language, but only shghtly familiar with Inca customs, employed the technique of Lope or Calderón to give new form to an old Indian legend. 20 The so-called earlier-dated manuscripts have never been thoroughly examined by competent scholars. This Inca stepchild has had considerable influence on later playwrights. In Peru it inspired Ollanta (Lima, 1876) by Constantino Carrasco, with prolog by Ricardo Palma; Hima Sumac (1892) by Clorinda Matto de Turner; and a modern adaptation (Lima, 1953) by César Miró and Sebastián Salazar Bondy; as well as an operetta in 1920 by Federico Blume and Luis Fernán Cisneros, with music by J. H. Valle-Riestra. In 1932 Buenos Aires was treated to a novelized version by Carlos Monsave and to an opera, followed in 1939 by its finest descendant, the tragedy Ollantay by Ricardo Rojas. 20 Augusto Tamayo Vargas, \"Tema, drama, y problema de Ollantay\" El Comercio, July 13,1953.\n\nPre-Columbian Drama in America\n\n11\n\nWith Ollantay disposed of as a pre-Columbian drama, there still remains a Central American claimant for the honor: Rabinal Achí (\"The Rabinal Champion\"), composed in the Quiché language. This is no play lost for centuries, as scholars once supposed Ollantay to be. In backwoods San Pablo de Rabinal, Guatemala, it had been frequently performed till finally forbidden by the Church about 1825. In 1855 a parish priest, Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg heard about it and wrote it down as dictated by an Indian of exceptional memory, Bartolomé Zis. For its performance on Sunday, January 20, 1856, his parishioners supplied music with an orchestra that included a tun, or drum made of a hollow log, calabash rattles and scratchers, flutes, whistles, and trumpets. Certainly no priest could be suspected as author of a tragedy ending with a human sacrifice upon a stone altar. Its unrimed speeches resemble neither the medieval Spanish religious plays nor the Golden Age comedia. Everything from simplicity of plot to repetition of speeches marks it as an authentic Indian composition. The setting is a Guatemala village with a long name, Cak-Yug-Zilic-CakacaonicTepicanic, whose ruins still exist a few miles north of Rabinal. The time is the thirteenth century, when there were still small, independent tribes, not yet united in the Quiché Empire. Five speaking roles are for men, one for a woman, and twenty-six parts are nonspeaking. Women in the Indian plays are traditionally silent, as are the supernumeraries for dancing and background.21 Act I opens with a song by the Rabinal Achí, champion of his 21 There is a French translation in Collection de documents dans les langues indigènes, Vol. II. A Spanish version by Luis Cardoza de Aragón, \"El varón de Rabinal,\" appears in Anales de la Sociedad de Geografía e Historia, VI (Guatemala, 1929); also in Revue de l'Institut Françaisd'Amerique Latine, II (September, 1945), 115-140, with a prolog by F.

He and his soldiers are making a sortie from their besieged city. The Achí of the Quiché encircling army breaks into their circle, brandishing his spear. Quickly captured, he offers to ransom himself, naming the treasures he will pay for his freedom. The Rabinal champion replies that for 260 nights and days, the army of Quiché has deprived them of sleep, while killing warriors and destroying towns. He agrees, however, to go back to town and carry the captive's proposal to Governor Hobtoh (\"Five Showers\"). In Act II the Governor is holding court inside the city of the long name. Beside him sits his wife, an admirable woman who says not a word during the whole act. The Governor agrees to spare their enemy's life only if he becomes one of the Council of Twelve Eagles and Jaguars and agrees to fight for him. In the third act, upon hearing the terms, the prisoner angrily refuses, with insulting words that almost bring execution on the spot, but on the chance that the Governor can persuade him, he is taken into the city. In the final act the enemy champion is brought before the Governor and given his last chance to change allegiance or be sacrificed. He chooses death, with a final request to be allowed to dance with the Mother of the Green Bird, probably the sweetheart of Rabinal Achí. After a banquet and a ceremonial dance and time to say farewell to his valleys and his mountains, the prisoner is led to the altar where his chest is laid open and his heart snatched out to the final melancholy strains of the weird music. Padre Brasseur observed that the acting entailed a severe strain on the actors, weighted down as they were by heavy wooden masks, but he also reported the use of substitute actors who occasionally donned the masks to give the stars a breathing spell. His preface also mentions seeing another play in Quiche, \"The Old Man,\" whose dialog he was unable to obtain. In a modernized form by Carlos Girón Cerna, as Quiché-Achî, Rabinal-Achí was successfully staged in 1950 with Carlos Alberto Mencos of the San Carlos University Theatre and his wife in the leading roles. The revised version, while departing somewhat from the original, is still far from a European drama. In the first act the Princess Tzam Cam Carchaj (\"Precious Emerald\"), though betrothed to Prince Rabinal Achí, falls in love with the Quiché cham-\n\nPre-Columbian Drama in America\n\n13\n\npion, whom she knows only by reputation. In the second act, before the palace of Job Toj of Rabinal, the tribal champion is condemning to death some of his captives when the Lord of Cagüek breaks through the crowd. First they duel with words and the Rabinal champion is angered by his adversary's boast that he can win away the heart of the Princess. In Act III the boastful enemy is put to the test. When he finishes dancing with the Princess, she swoons! \"Thirteen times twenty days and nights,\" he is allowed for saying farewell to his home before the final duel. His return in the fourth act finds the Princess dead of love, with the Lords of Death and the chorus bemoaning her passing. Nothing is left in life for Quiché-Achí. He dances the dance of resignation. As the play ends, the Rabinal warriors close upon him and take him to the sacrificial altar. There may have been other pre-Columbian spectacles. The Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Quiché-Maya people, tells of one that took place when two brothers descended to Xibalba, the underworld, to avenge their father. To quote from the English version: Transformed into old men, they performed the dance of the owl, the dance of the weasel, and the dance of the armadillo . . . Furthermore, they burned houses as though they were really burning and instantly they were as they had been before.22 Obviously many of these examples do not conform with the modern idea of a play. However, the basic theatre was there whenever Indians staged even a Rain Dance or went through a pantomime in masks. Imitation is the genesis of the theatre; Shakespeare was not the only one who conceived of it as a mirror of life. And admonition is a source of drama, whether it be advice by precept or warning by horrible example. The seed of the primitive drama was the expression of religious worship or the development of a martial spirit by tales of heroes. And finally the primitive actors added comedy, chiefly for entertainment. That investigator of American cuitare, Pedro Henríquez Ureña, has summed up the scholarly research into pre-Columbian drama. He points out that while no plays in the New World were like those of Spain, all the elements existed separately on the American continent: 22\n\nDelia Goetz and Silvanus G. Morley translation, Part II, Chapter 13, p. 156.\n\n14\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\nthe stage and the scenery in Mexico, the Peruvian division into heroic and comic themes, the comic improvisation, and the pageants concerned with agriculture. 23 Each represents a type of dramatic entertainment enjoyed by Indians before the arrival of the white man. But among all their theatrical production that survived, no combination resembling European drama has been found. That had to await the arrival of the Spanish. 23 Pedro Henríquez Ureña, \"El teatro en la América durante la época colonial,\" Cuaderno de Cultura Teatral ( hereafter referred to as Cuaderno ), No. 3 ( 1936), 9-50 (includes ten pages of bibliographical material).\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nNew World ElementsínEarly American Drama\n\nFirst of the European plays to be performed in the New World was probably seen in Hispaniola, the earliest center of Spanish administration. The unrecorded performances in seminaries, antedating Llerena, will be discussed in the section on the Dominican Republic. Probably the earliest plays on the mainland were performed by puppeteers accompanying Cortés on his expedition to Hibueras. When he left Mexico City in October, 1524, according to the chronicler Bernai Díaz del Castillo he took with him to entertain his troops \"otro que jugaba a manos y hacía títeres.\" 1 Mexico was one more stop in the pilgrimage of the little figures that, according to Raimundo Lull ( 1235-1315), reached Spain from India, by way of Italy, in 1211.2 These were not, however, the first puppets in America. Díaz del Castillo reported that the early Indians also \"saben hacer títeres.\" 3 After their start, the puppets frequently provided the only local theatrical entertainment in places where there were no human actors. And they continued to thrive here and there. In 1625, when Mexico had three theatres, Lima two, and even inland Potosí, Bolivia, was supporting one, the only playhouse for the entertainment of Buenos Aires was a puppet theatre. Two hundred years later Pérez Rosales had to admit that in Chile plays were \"almost unknown.\" Punch and Judy shows had to suffice.4 Even after theatres were built in Mexico, puppets alternated with live actors throughout the year, and replaced them during Lent. In 1786 the capital had four permanent puppet theatres, with uncounted portable stages that roamed the streets and villages to let young and old enjoy the antics of Juan 1\n\nPaul McPharlin, The Puppet Theatre in America, 1524-1949.

Ever since then puppets have remained popular in Latin America, with a recent flurry of activity, judging by advertisements of puppets and cardboard theatres in Argentine and Chilean newspapers and children's magazines. Schools in many Latin American nations use them in their teaching programs. Under the sponsorship of Mexico's Ministry of Education, Roberto Lago and Lola V. Cueto deserted their permanent puppet theatre in the capital in 1934 to take into the remote villages of Mexico some of the cleverest hand puppets that ever appeared on any stage. Under United Nations auspices a puppet show toured Central America in 1952 to impress health habits on the illiterate Indians. Part of the celebration of the fourth centenary of Cervantes' birth was a puppet performance of Don Quixote in the Palace of Fine Arts, Mexico, using a script by the well-known author Salvador Novo. Mexicans also enjoyed at least one puppet play for adults, Bernardo Ortiz de Montellano's El sombrerón (Mexico, 1946), in which a mythical Quiche-Mayan servant, with a human face and a big straw hat, symbolized the struggle between friendly fire and evil.7 The New World's first plays with human actors, however, had other purposes than entertainment. They were performed to impress Christian doctrines upon the pagans, a purpose always supposed to be in the minds of the conquistadors. Columbus had priestly companions in his caravels, sent along to convert any heathens they might encounter, and immediately after the conquest of Mexico in 1521, Charles V sent three of his closest religious advisors to help Christianize the mainland. They reached Tenochtitlán (Mexico City) in 5 Ada M. Coe, \"Notes on Puppetry,\" Hispania, XXVIII (1945), 197-207, with bibliography of puppet plays written by famous authors. 6 Armando de Maria y Campos, Teatro mexicano de muñecas. 7 See José J. Arrom, \"Perfil del teatro contemporáneo,\" Hispania, XXXVI (February, 1953), 29-30.\n\nNew World Elements in Early American Drama\n\n17\n\nMay, 1523. By the following May twelve Franciscans had followed them. A number of Dominicans got there in 1526, and an Augustinian contingent arrived in 1535. Discovering the uselessness of proselyting through interpreters, the priests determined to learn the many languages spoken by the inhabitants of Middle America, where at least thirty separate linguistic stocks still exist.8 Putting down unwritten languages into the Roman alphabet and devising native grammars were only part of their task. In 1539 Juan Cromberger moved part of his printing equipment from Seville to Mexico City to help in the linguistics efforts. A Nahuatl grammar was printed in 1547, and between then and 1569 Fray Bernardino de Sahagún (1499 ?-1590) wrote his General History of the Affairs of New Spain in that language. It was not translated into Spanish till later. Looking for ways to impress Christian doctrines on their Indian parishioners, the priests were glad at first to use plays brought over from Spain. Even if not of high literary caliber, they lent vividness to the sermons. But, after all, even in Spain the drama was not very advanced. Ruins of the Sagunto amphitheatre near Valencia do go back, in the opinion of some archaeologists, to the time of the Greeks, while remains of Roman theatres at Bilbilis (now Calatayud), Marida, and a half-dozen other sites prove that early inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula knew the delight of dramatic performances, some of them elaborate. Enough still remains of the amphitheatre of Itálica, near Seville, to indicate that a mock naval battle could be fought there on real water. Too, Spain was the birthplace of the dramatist Seneca (4 B.C-A.D. 65) and one may surmise that some of his nine tragedies had been performed in his home town of Córdoba. But, as in Rome, the theatre of ancient Spain fell on evil days. Performances became so immoral that in the fifth century St. Chrysostom refused Holy Sacrament to theatregoers. In 425 Spanish civil authorities, to make sure that believers had no counterattractions to keep them from church, forbade performances on feast days. Sundays were later included in the prohibition and finally, in 633, the Council of Toledo abolished the theatre altogether. When the Moors, who possessed no theatrical traditions, overran the Peninsula a century later, even the memory of the stage disappeared. 8 Cyrus Thomas and John H. Swanton, Indian Languages of Mexico and Central America.\n\n18\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\nScholars date the slow rebirth of the theatre from the trope of Tútilo, a handsome monk in the Benedictine Abbey of St. Gall, Switzerland, in 860.9 Originally given in Latin, these dramatizations of the Christmas and Easter stories, like the fragmentary Auto de los reyes magos written in the Cathedral of Toledo in the twelfth century, were eventually performed in Spanish, and they continued to be written and performed, sometimes by priests not as dedicated as Tútilo, till once more the theatre fell into disrepute. King Alfonso X (1226-1284) declared in his Siete partidas, Título VI, Libro 34, that priests who performed in plays were as bad as those vile persons the minstrels and troubadours, who danced and sang before the public for the sake of the money received. Alfonso XI (1300 ?-1350) repeated the censure at Compluto (now Alcalá) in 1348 and a half century later the Council of Arana and Compluto threatened excommunication to all priest-actors. Still, religious pageants were being performed before the altar in Saragosa in 1399 and in Barcelona in 1424, and perhaps the New World priests thought themselves far enough away to perform them, especially since their purposes were godly. The earliest drama in America was the nativity play Los pastores performed by friars with Cortés. It has had a long life, and will be discussed in the chapter on Mexico. Los pastores was transferred bodily to the New World and at first had no American elements. But as soon as the priests learned the Indian dialects they began writing plays in those languages, and almost immediately New World drama began taking on the color of its environment. The development occurred in three steps: first the use of local dialects, then the inclusion of New World characters, and finally the dramatization of New World events. The first New World play in a native tongue was probably \"The Last Judgment,\" in the Nahuatl language of Mexico, written by Fray Andrés de Olmos (c. 1491-1571), and performed in Mexico in 1533. It was a good old fire-and-brimstone affair but slanted to a local problem. The priests had been worried about the number of Spanish soldiers who had acquired Indian mistresses. So Olmos put onto the 9 The first Easter Introit, from Folio 484, p. 110 of St. Gall, is reproduced in Classical Outlook, XXXIX, No. 7 (Oxford, Ohio, April 1952). See also Edmund K. Chambers, The Medieval Stage, II, 309.\n\nNew World Elements in Early American Drama\n\n19\n\nstage the Indian Lucía, who was living with a man to whom she was not married. Two characters symbolizing Time and The Church visited her with the warning that the Day of Judgment was approaching. They urged her, under threat of terrible punishment, to repent and regularize her status. The frightened Indian woman hurried to her confessor, only to be told that there could be no mercy for a sinner like her. To us that statement may seem to be a contradiction of the Church's preaching about repentance and pardon, but the sixteenth-century dramatist probably figured that if Lucía was forgiven, other Indians might believe that they could sin for awhile and eventually repent and be pardoned. At any rate the play achieved its purpose. Father Juan de Torquemada writing about it later, testified: \"It opened the eyes of many Indians and Spaniards to turn to virtue and abandon their evil ways, and many erring women, moved by terror, became converted.\" Some of these religious plays carried political overtones, like one performed in Asunción, Paraguay, in 1544. Father Juan Gabriel Lezcano wrote an Epiphany play that he and others performed on the steps of the cathedral. In the course of it, one shepherd brought echoes of Spain's fifteenth-century Mingo Revulgo by using the epithet \"scurvy wolf\" to refer to their former governor, Cabeza de Vaca, who had been deposed the previous April in America's first revolution. Throughout the colonial period the chief occasions for theatrical performances were Church holy days, especially Corpus Christi, Christmas, and Easter; welcoming ceremonies for visiting dignitaries; and festivals to demonstrate loyalty to Spain, such as royal birthdays and coronations. Because of the close connections of all these to the mother country, they would seem to offer few opportunities for the introduction of Hemisphere accents; yet those gradually crept in. Old World and New mingled in what is believed to be America's first play by a native-born dramatist—\"The Spiritual Marriage between Shepherd Pedro and the Mexican Church,\" by Juan Pérez Ramírez (1545-1580?). It was written in 1574 to welcome Archbishop Pedro Moya de Contreras, the Pedro of the play, to his new charge in the cathedral in Mexico. This brief religious play shows its Spanish ancestry by the use of such symbolic characters as Divine\n\n20\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\nLove and Theological Virtues as well as the typical bobo, or comic character. The language, too, is that of any cultured Spaniard, but the shepherds provide a local and American flavor. Still more Mexican touches can be observed in Coloquio III, written for the same occasion by the Spanish-born Fernán González de Eslava (1534-1601), perhaps with the help of Juan de la Cueva, the sixteenth-century dramatist of Spain who started Don Juan Tenorio on his theatrical career. Cueva is known to have been in Mexico between 1574 and 1577. The prose and poetry of the seven scenes in this play are full of popular words and local slang. The characters as well as the themes are Mexican, so much so in fact that Viceroy Martin Henriquez, one of the spectators, took offense at the comic character whose make-up included a beard such as distinguished the Viceroy and who appealed for civil disobedience against the Viceroy's recently established sales tax. Henriquez complained to the archbishop, who claimed complete innocence. Their quarrel was eventually carried to the emperor in Spain, but meantime poor Eslava went to jail for seventeen days as punishment for his too successful attempt to mingle local politics with religion. For those looking for American touches, Eslava provides a fertile territory. His sixteen surviving short plays, termed by him \"Coloquios,\" combine Spanish forms with local customs and background. In Coloquio V, for instance, this sixteenth-century dramatist sounded a Mexican note by following the Soul on a sort of Pilgrim's Progress along the fortified road recently built by Viceroy Henriquez between Mexico City and the silver mines in Zacatecas, with each of the seven forts symbolizing some test of faith. Even more completely Mexican is the curtain raiser for Eslava's Coloquio VII, written about 1570. Teresa, proud of her descent from a conquistador, begs her husband, Diego Moreno, to take her away from Mexico with its edicts against the wearing of silken finery. He gets them passage on a China-bound galleon. On board, they find Jonah fleeing from Nineveh, and the rest of the play is devoted to the Biblical story of Jonah and the whale. Across the Caribbean in Santo Domingo, Cristóbal de Llerena ( c. 1545-1610), a musician and university professor, was writing a play so full of local allusions that it roused the wrath of the city fathers. For the Corpus Christi celebration of 1588 he introduced a typical bobo of the Spanish entremés, but one who criticized the corrupt\n\nNew World Elements in Early American Drama\n\n21\n\ngovernment of the island, the freedom allowed women, and the surfeit of priests and lawyers in the city. Shortly afterward, its author was hauled out of bed early one morning and shipped away from Santo Domingo. As time passed, drama broadened and became a recognized weapon to criticize local political and social abuse. It was therefore more realistic than religious. After it was cast out of the Church, it took refuge with the populace, both in the homes of the wealthy and in the public squares, where it was the delight of the common people. The nobles, perhaps because their interests were still deeply rooted in Spain, liked plays that came from Madrid's stages. The lower classes cared little for tradition, provided they were entertained. Between the two tastes, considerable dramatic activity seems to have been encouraged. The examples so far have been Spanish in form with New World elements added. Now was to come the next step. Though still developed according to Madrid's dramatic technique, the plays told stories about the New World. The first ones were short. As the impresario Arias de Villalobos of Mexico was to declare in 1621: \" O n l y plays from Castile are performed; those from around here turn out badly.\" And so the only chance for a local dramatist to see his play on the stage was to write something that could be sandwiched between the acts of a play from Madrid. Even established dramatists with powerful patrons, like the Peruvian Pedro de Peralta Barnuevo (1664-1743), friend of the viceroy, stuck to surefire European material and wrote of gods and royalty. The first time he ventured to use a local theme was in the entremés introduced between the acts of his translation of Corneille's Rodogune, about 1716. In it he introduced four masked beauties of Lima, who joined with their typical Peruvian suitors to avoid a father's vigilance. This delightful little skit has been characterized by José Arrom in his study of the American colonial theatre as the one ancient play best able to stand the test of a performance today. It is completely national and full of the American spirit. Actually, during the seventeenth century Spaniards saw more plays based on New World themes than were performed in America. Most of Spain's Golden Age dramatists wrote plays based on overseas events and people because of their romantic appeal to stay-athome Castilians. Lope de Vega finished El Nuevo Mundo descubierto\n\n22\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\npor Colón about 1604. He put Cortés onto the stage in El Marqués de Valle, Hurtado de Mendoza in Arauco domado, and even composed a curious Corpus Christi play based on characters from Ercilla's great epic poem of Chile, La araucana. Tirso de Molina wrote a trilogy about the Pizarro family: La lealtad contra la envidia, Las hazañas de los Pizarro, and Amazonas de las Indias. Calderón put Pizarro, his rival Almagro, and a crowd of Indians into a hodgepodge Peruvian religious play, La aurora en Copacabana (1672), that reveals how badly a great dramatist can sometimes write. Lesser dramatists like Francisco González Bustos wrote the much-performed Los españoles en Chile, while others turned out Santa Rosa de Lima and Algunas hazañas de las muchas de García Hurtado de Mendoza. Lesser-known Americans also figured in plays by Spaniards; Doña Mencia de Nidos was represented in La belígera española by \"Ricardo de Turia,\" and the much-traveled Ordóñez de Ceballos of Jaen inspired the fertile mind of Fray Alonso Remón to write Un español entre muchas naciones (Jaen, 1629). But of all the New World subjects for drama, one of the most romantic was the nun Catalina de Erauso, truly a self-made man, because she sneaked out of her convent, converted her nun's habit into a uniform, and sailed to America as a soldier of fortune. Several dramatists in Spain, including González Bustos and Pérez de Montalván, friend of Lope, told her story. The curious fact is that no playwrights living in America saw the dramatic possibilities of such striking personalities or wrote plays about them. Failing such subjects, the most obvious subject for a truly national theatre in America would seem to be the Indians. The dramatists were surrounded by them, but to most settlers they represented either a potential peril or a source of cheap labor, neither concept likely to turn the Indian into the hero of a play. One sixteenth-century Peruvian dramatist, however, Gabriel Centeno de Osma, wrote in the Quechua language a play about Indians called \"The Richest Poor Man.\" His model was the German Faust legend. The poor Indian contracted to sell his soul to the Devil (Nina Quiru), but when the time came to pay five years later, upon advice of an angel he appealed to the Virgin of Copacabana at her shrine on Lake Titicaca. She redeemed him and gave him spiritual gifts to make him the richest of poor men. In the eighteenth century this play received a skillful reworking as Usca Páucar, in which dignity was given the man who\n\nNew World Elements in Early American Drama\n\n23\n\nreneged on his bargain, by making him an impoverished but noble descendant of the Incas. From then on, only chieftains were considered worthy of consideration by the dramatists. They were called \"kings\" in a play supposed to have been written about 1619 by Cristóbal Gutiérrez de Luna of Mexico and entitled Coloquio de la nueva conversión y bautismo de los cuatro últimos, reyes de Tlaxcala en la Nueva España. It was a pageant introducing Cortés and Doña Marina. A chief also figured in a Chilean play whose title alone has been preserved, but with that much we can reconstruct the plot, because \"E1 Hércules chileno\" (1693) must have dealt with that stalwart figure of Ercilla's epic, Caupolicán, who proved his right to be the war chief of the Araucanians by sustaining a heavy tree trunk on his shoulder longer than any other Indian could. This lost play, written by a couple of local amateurs, was part of the welcoming ceremonies of the frontier city of Concepción for Chile's Governor Marín Poveda. He had left Spain as a bachelor, met Juana de Urdanegui in Lima, and married her in Concepción, in 1693. But the manuscript of the play, which was intended to give him an idea of the military problems facing him and his subjects, probably burned during one of the many raids by those same Indians on Chile's frontier city. A century later, as stated in Chapter 1, Padre Valdés of Peru dramatized a legend of the Inca, his general, and his daughter in Ollantay (c. 1780), long mistaken for a survivor of pre-Columbian Indian drama. Across the Andes about the same time, Manuel José de Lavardén (1754-1809 ?) wrote about Indians in Siripo, telling of a chief who fell in love with the wife of one of the first explorers of the River Plate and who killed the husband to get her. When Lucía Miranda understandably refused to marry the murderer of her husband, the Indian also killed her. This play, too, has been lost, probably destroyed when Buenos Aires' first theatre burned in 1792. With the passing of years the attitude of the dramatists toward the Indian changed according to the literary fad in vogue at the time they were writing. Two plays by some unknown Mexican about 1790 found humor in the ignorance and stupidity of the lower-class Indian. Their plots are simple. Their interest lies in the use of the vernacular language. One of them, El entremés de las Tosadas, its plot based on the custom of making visits at Christmas, introduces a picaresque Indian, Pascual, who jabbers amusing broken Spanish with a servant\n\n24\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\ngirl and a couple of sweethearts. The play ends with the singing of a Christmas carol. The other entremés, El criado indio, presents the worries of a hungry lad who has stolen some cloth and then, remembering how his brother and his Uncle Pegro had been punished for a similar theft, tries to get rid of his loot. The nineteenth-century rise of neoclassicism in the continent brought a number of plays presenting the Indian as a great but tragic figure. In the first quarter of the century Luis Vargas Tejada (1802-1829), founder of Colombia's theatre, dramatized in Sugamaxi ( 1818) the practice of human sacrifice before the coming of the white man, and followed with other tragedies of the aborigines: Saquesazipa (1818) and Witikindo (1820). His countryman, José Fernández Madrid (1788-1830), wrote a play, Guatimocín (1824), about the Aztec noble who suffered death by fire rather than reveal to Cortés the hiding place of the tribal treasure. He also put the daughter of a North American Indian chief onto the stage in the tragedy Atala ( 1825), developed in pseudoclassical style. A few of the romanticists also introduced the noble redskin into their plays, but most of them, when they could tear their attention from Crusaders and Moors, turned to their own colonial history. The coming of realism ought, perhaps, to have filled the stages with downtrodden and exploited Indians, but Indian protagonists are hard to find. The Mexican novelist Mariano Azuela (1873-1952) made an unsuccessful dramatization in 1950 of his 1916 novel, Los de abajo. Ecuador, which contains all the ingredients for a Tobacco Road of underprivileged Indians, has produced only one realistic play about them, Flagelo, by the country's outstanding Indianist novelist, Jorge Icaza (1906- ). Its history will serve to explain the dearth of such plays there and elsewhere. After his success with the novel Huasipungo, Icaza, originally a dramatist, decided to write a play about Indians. The result was a realistic yet symbolic mingling of drama and ballet, called Flagelo. It was printed in 1936, but no one in Ecuador would stage it and he had to go to Buenos Aires for a performance. His fellow countrymen, who will cue up to see an American movie and will patronize a theatrical performance of O'Neill or Arsenic and Old Lace or even Charley's Aunt, neither bought the published version nor attended the performances; so Icaza returned to the novels that do bring him glory and cash.\n\nNew World Elements in Early American Drama\n\n25\n\nThough the drama of Brazil is not given a place in this history of the Spanish American theatre, it might be said to parallel the development of Spain's colonies, though with a cultural lag. Its first play, Pregaçao universal e o mistério de Jesús (by Padre José de Anchieta [1534-1597], produced in Nicteroi in 1566), was purely European. Succeeding dramatists also failed to treat of local people or themes. They were not inspired by either Indians or Negroes, both of whom lacked theatrical traditions. Both Manoel Botelho de Oliveira ( 16361711), whose native Bahia named its first theatre (1733) after him, and António José de Silva (1705-1739) based their dramas on European stories. Indeed, not till 1838 was any national drama achieved in Brazil. Then Domingo Gonçalves de Magalhães ( 18111882) returned from Europe with his romantic tragedy António José ou o poeta e a Inquisição about a trial in Lisbon in 1739 of the dramatist mentioned above, who was charged with being a Jew. Six months later in the same year, Luis Carlos Martins Pena (1815-1848), produced a thoroughly Brazilian comedy, O juiz de paz na roça (\"A Rural Justice of the Peace\"). After that, Brazilian themes and types frequently appeared on the stage. Dramatists in other parts of the continent were also slow to attempt full-length plays based on local stories. Juan María Domínguez of Colombia learned the perils of dramatizing contemporary events when in 1826 he wrote a five-act tragedy about the Colombian revolutionary heroine Juana de Salabarrieta, who had been executed as a spy by the Spaniards nine years earlier. During the first performance of his play in Bogotá, while the condemned La Pola was being led from the chapel to execution, the audience screamed its protests and refused to let the actors be heard. Finally the author had to go before the curtain to announce that because of the demands of the \"respected public,\" the sentence of La Pola had been changed by Viceroy Sámano to banishment. The public then cried for the death of the Viceroy. The romantic movement, however, was responsible for many plays about local history. Ignacio Rodríguez Galván (1816-1842) delved into Mexico's past for his Muñoz, visitador de México ( 1838 ), an early example of romanticism in his country. Its title character was sent by Philip II to inspect conditions in Spain's colony, but he became more interested in the wife of one of Mexico's officials, a situation that precipitated a revolt. Even more indebted to Mexico's colonial period\n\n26\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\nwas the prolific romanticist José Peón y Contreras (1843-1907), who unfortunately began too late, when romanticism was already dying. Writers in other countries looked about themselves and dramatized what they saw. In Lima, Felipe Pardo (1806-1868) and especially Manuel Ascensio Segura (1805-1871) dealt with the early days of Peru's independence. The Chileans Daniel Barros Grez (1834-1903), Juan Rafael Allende ( 1850-1909), and the satirist Román Vial ( 18331896), left a dramatic picture of the Santiago of their time. Paul Groussac (1848-1925) and Roberto Payró (1867-1928) dealt with the period of Dictator Rosas of Argentina, and a host of dramatists on both sides of the River Plate have given immortality to the gauchos. These works formed the transition stage that culminated in the thoroughly national theatres that have today developed in the different countries, and in plays that cannot be confused with the output of other regions. Completely Mexican were the tent shows, that provided safety valves for political tension and trained many of the outstanding comedians of the current Mexican stage and movies. The series of topical plays written and performed by Ernesto Albán, in which the character Evaristo looks at contemporary problems, are likewise unmistakably Ecuadorian. The Cuban bufo, a modern cornmedia dell ' arte built about an unscrupulous Negro, a comic mulatto girl, and a newly arrived and stupid Galician, are no less Cuban. The majority of the thoroughly national plays are comedies; it seems easier to hit a national note in humor than in seriousness. But one cannot overlook the serious plays about the jibaro, the Puerto Rican farmer, by Ramón Méndez Quiñones (1847-1889), Manuel Méndez Ballester (1909- ), and René Marqués (1919- ). AU of these plays have departed so far from the traditions of the Spanish theatre that notes and glossary would probably be needed for their complete comprehension by a Madrid audience. In short, the Americanization of the New World theatre is today complete. The rest of this volume will follow its slow development in the various countries.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nParaguayan Drama\n\nDrama in Paraguay parallels the race of the hare with the tortoise. Though off to an early start with a play performed as early as 1544, it later lagged so badly that the Montevideo Theatre Congress of 1941 declared it one of two Latin American countries (Panama was the other ) that lacked any national theatre activity. The deficiency was not for want of lovers of literature in its early days. Captain Juan de Salazar, who founded Asunción in 1537, was one; his will of 1557 mentions several volumes in Spanish ( libros de romance) left to his children. These lost volumes may have been accounts of his own adventures in the New World. Perhaps he even had something to do with the first recorded play of Paraguay, when, to celebrate Corpus Christi in 1544, Father Juan Gabriel Lezcano wrote a pastoral farce in which he and others performed on the steps of the cathedral. Lezcano was a native of Valladolid, Spain, who had accompanied the Mendoza expedition to settle Buenos Aires. Harassed by the hostile Indians, he had fled with the survivors to settle among the more hospitable Guaraní Indians of Paraguay. He had been made chaplain by Irala on June 10, 1540, and priest three years later by Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca. Lezcano's play was more political than religious. In April, 1543, the citizens of Asunción, in America's first political uprising, had deposed and jailed their adelantado, Cabeza de Vaca. In a manner reminiscent of Spain's satirical Mingo Revulgo (c. 1475), the priestplaywright-actor refers in his play to the ex-Governor as a \"scurvy wolf\" (lobo rrebaço).1 Enough other local references and color are 1 Julio Caillet Bois, \"El teatro en la Asunción a mediados del siglo XVI,\" Revista de Filología Hispánica, IV (1942), 1; Walter Rela, \"Fundamentos para una historia del teatro paraguayo,\" Jornadas de Cultura (November, 1955), p. 28.

Ulrich Schmidl and Barco Centenera have discovered mention of other dramatic performances in 1545 and 1551, the latter to celebrate the wedding of Francisco Ortiz de Vergara to Irala's sister.2 Then comes a gap in recorded drama. Two Jesuit priests, Ortega and Filds, reached Paraguay in 16093 to begin building up a theocratic empire in the heart of South America between the Paraná and the Uruguay Rivers. Thirty settlements, from San Ignacio Guazú in 1609 to the unfinished Misión de Jesús in 1764, housed 100,000 Indians. From the first, drama was part of their pedagogic equipment, provided by the priests in the language of their parishioners. 4 This theatre in Guaraní is discussed in the next chapter. During the flurry of theatrical performances in the Indian language, drama in Spanish continued to languish. True, there were a few signs of life after the end of activity with the Guaraní black-out. Josefina Pla, in her unpublished \"historia crítica del teatro paraguayo,\" mentions performances in the Plaza de Asunción between 1767 and 1817, among them La vida es sueño and several plays by Moreto. In 1812 there was even a showing by an unnamed local dramatist. But in general one can say that the drama of Paraguay went into a decline. The reasons are not hard to find. Fate and geography have treated this region shabbily. Not only is it far inland, with thick jungles on three sides, but it gave no promise of quick wealth to prospective colonists at the conclusion of their long river journey. Its climate is not pleasant; Paraguay offers only a brief period of agreeable weather and then nine months of burning summer. The banks open at seven and close at eleven and that concludes business for the day. At the end of the eighteenth century Asunción had less than twenty thousand inhabitants. Spain showed its low opinion of the value of its colony by making no attempt to reclaim it when, on May 24, 1811, the citizens declared their independence and told their Spanish governor to go home. For a short time, a junta took over the government, but in 1814 Dr. José Gaspar Rodríguez Francia came into power to begin twenty2\n\nRela, \"Fundamentos,\" Jornadas de Cultura (November, 1955), p. 30.

He also lists, pp. 117-133, the dramatic offerings in Asunción, by years. 4 Die missionem der Jesuiten in Paraguay (Gütersloh, Germany, 1891), quoted in Boettner, Música y músicos, p. 53. 3\n\nParaguayan Drama\n\n29\n\nsix years of dictatorship. Realizing that his neighboring countries were casting covetous eyes on the territory, Dr. Francia practically sealed his frontiers and turned Paraguay into a hermit nation, with himself as \"E1 Supremo.\" Everything from marriages to the sale of cattle required his personal approval. He disapproved of education. He left open only one primary school in Asunción, and with the declaration that \"Minerva can sleep while Mars watches,\" he closed the only Paraguayan college in order to have more money for his army. To him the theatre was a frivolity, and the only national play recorded during his period of power was El rosario perseguido ( 1817), by José del Rosario Ayala. A few years after Francia's death, in 1840, a more paternal dictator, Carlos Antonio López, came into power. López was ambitious for the cultural advance of his country. He brought a railroad and a telegraph system to Paraguay and sent to Uruguay for an Italian architect, Alejandro Ravizza, to build him a palace and a theatre. In addition, in 1852 he sent his son to Europe in search of someone to establish an adequate school system and to inaugurate a theatrical movement. He also decreed establishment of the first newspaper, El Semanario, which appeared on May 21,1853. The man selected as educator of the nation was Ildefonso Antonio Bermejo ( 1820-1892), born in Cádiz but a fugitive in Paris since the Spanish insurrection of 1846. Bermejo had written a half-dozen plays, including El poder de un fabo amigo (1849), before Francisco Solano López arrived in Paris in 1852 to persuade him to bring literacy and culture to Paraguay. Arriving in Asunción in February, 1855, Bermejo first founded the newspaper Eco del Paraguay, and then the normal school, but eventually directed his attention to Don Carlos' theatre. The building was already being used. Flor de un día and Los hijos de Eduardo are listed as having been performed there, probably by amateurs directed by Bermejo. According to an advertisement in El Semanario, a Compañía Dramática Española was visiting Asunción. For Sunday, April 18, 1858, the paper announced that Carmen Rodriguez and Enrique López would offer Dumas' Los colegiales de Saint Cyr and the one-act Inesilla la de Pinto. On May 23 they performed El duende by Ramón de la Cruz, and the musical El rapto de doña Savina. Don Juan Tenorio opened on August 7, and Traidor, inconfeso, y martir, also by Zorrilla, on October 8. December 4, 1858, however, was the gala day for the Paraguayan\n\n30\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\ntheatre. The same El Semanario advertised the approaching presentation in Don Carlos' theatre by the Spanish Company of Dramas and Comedies of the first poetic play written in Paraguay, Un paraguayo leal,5 by Bermejo (Asunción, 1898). The announcement failed to mention that it was a revision of his 1849 tragedy, with new names, places, and some minor incidents, and with local color and phrases in Guaraní provided by his student, the poet Natalicio Talavera ( 18391867). The Dictator's son, Francisco, now back from Paris with his Irish mistress, Elisa Lynch, 6 occupied one of the boxes, and when López, who had kept his military hat on during the whole evening, expressed displeasure with the performance, the diamond-studded Madame Lynch explained to the Dictator that if the play had satisfied him, it would have been too sophisticated for the Paraguayans. Somewhat appeased, President López ordered Bermejo to try again, this time with the Dictator's tastes in mind. Apparently the Spaniard did not follow instructions. While he directed national actors in plays by García Gutiérrez, de la Cruz, Bretón de los Herreros, and other Spaniards, the only other known writings by him in Paraguay are some costumbrista dialogs (La Aurora, 1860). After seven years he and his disgruntled wife returned to Europe where he wrote a violent attack on the \"uncouth\" Paraguayans and turned out a total of thirty-one plays, none of which was important. 7 Dictator López died in 1862, with his desire for plays still unappeased. He was succeeded by his son, former Vice-President Francisco Solano López. The father had built the best army in South America and the son decided to use it, first in an alliance with Brazil and Uruguay against Argentina to protect Uruguay. His successes encouraged a visiting Spanish company of actors, headed by Pelayo Ascona, to flatter him with La divertida historia de la triple alianza (1864), a three-act comedy originally written in English by the American consul, Peter Bliss.8 Before long the Paraguayan War began. Ascona tried to give benefit performances to raise money for the army, but with the nation's 5\n\nJ.

The outbreak of war also ended Marshal López' efforts to give his people a replica of La Scala of Milan. It remained half finished. However, in the palace that he built for Madame Lynch he did construct a theatre, a spacious room at present serving as the dining room in the hotel into which the old building has now been converted. Overwhelming superiority of manpower and geographic location of the three neighboring countries proved too much for Paraguay, though its citizens fought courageously from 1865 to 1870. During allied occupation of Asunción, some Argentine soldiers produced plays imported from Spain for the entertainment of their comrades. Gradually the citizens of Paraguay began the struggle to restore their nation and its culture. From 1880 on, a few hardy companies of foreign actors sailed their slow way up the river to perform in the capital. 9 Francisco Rodriguez and Enriqueta Quintana headed a company from Spain that reached Asunción in December, 1881. They found the National Theatre in such disrepair that they had to restore it and paint its boxes before they could open. Because so few patronized the performances, a continuous change in offerings was necessary, making the prompter more essential than usual. The newspaper comment following Moratín's Lo positivo was: \"Excellent, but the prompter should lower his voice.\" Among their other offerings were: Larra's Flores y perlas, Echegaray's La esposa del vengador, Navarrete y Zárate's Más vale maña que fuerza, and Gil y Zárate's Guzmán el bueno. The Paraguayan public, however, preferred zarzuelas, a type requiring more rehearsals than did the spoken plays. One such performance was so ragged that the manager went before the curtain to apologize that the orchestra was not prepared. That brought a denial from the pianist, Billordo. A fight followed. Then someone shouted \"Fire!\" and the theatre was emptied. A new pianist arrived from Buenos Aires before the next performance. To boost attendance, various schemes were attempted. Prizes were raffled during the performances. Tickets were sent to leading families of Asunción, with bills following later. Still the theatre remained half empty. Discouraged, the players gave their \"final performance.\" 9\n\nBoettner, Música y músicos, pp. 117-133, lists their offerings by years.\n\n32\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\nThe next day, December 16, 1882, a newspaper advertisement declared that the company had not collected enough money for their return fare to Buenos Aires and would have to stay on in the bedraggled theatre. Eventually came a change. In 1887 Teatro Olimpo came into existence. In 1888 an Italian physician, Dr. Silvio Andreuzzi, for sixteen years a resident of Asunción, built El Teatro Andreuzzi, now the dining room of Hotel del Paraguay. And finally even the National Theatre was reconditioned. A society was formed to take it over, install acetylene gas lights, and repaint it. Each contributing member was repaid by being assigned a box for all performances. The building was ready for the Fernández Company of Zarzuelas and Comedies that arrived from Buenos Aires in August, 1898, bringing something new, the idea of matinees besides evening performances. And to entice Paraguayans the director added three plays by local dramatists to the repertory. On August 22 they revived Bermejo's two-act play in verse, Un paraguayo leal, which, according to the newspapers, was \"short but fairly successful.\" On August 29 the company staged El Dr. Francia by Benigno Tejeiro Martínez. El heroísmo de una madre o la guerra del Paraguay by Segundo San Martin followed on September 6. The critics approved the last, though noting the omission of some details necessary for an understanding of the action, and indicating such anachronisms as horsecars in Asunción in 1862. The de la Vega players, in April, 1899, brought Calderón's Vida es sueño and works by Dicenta, Zorrilla, and others, and these were followed by a succession of foreign troupes. Around 1900 a zarzuela, La rosa paraguaya, was written by the Spanish poet Victorino Abente y Lago. It was published about 1910, but there is doubt that it was ever performed. The next Paraguayan play came on November 21, 1906, when the Enrique Sánchiz Company of Zarzuelas performed the three-act poetic drama La cámara obscura, by the poet Alejandro Guanes (1872-1925). Also in 1906 Asunción got its first look at movies, about which it had been reading since 1900, when the Teatro Nacional offered a program billed as \"Bioscopio Lírico,\" apparently a film with accompanying phonograph music. The next year, twelve films were run, with interspersed orchestra music. The theatre used gas for lighting, and spectators had to help by turning the lights up and down; not till 1912 was electricity installed in the National Theatre. Since that entering wedge, it has been movies that have at-\n\nParaguayan Drama\n\n33\n\ntracted the crowds and brought the profits. The country's dramatists complain that their National Theatre is open to them only between the runs of profitable films. The end of romanticism and the beginnings of modernism came in 1910, and a few local playwrights were lucky enough to get a showing. A satirical paso de comedia, Diálogo de los muertos, was written in 1909 by Fulgencio R. Moreno and published in 1910. In it President Francia talks with his aides. Juan O'Leary wrote Una danza ( 1910 ) and a historical play, La gasparina ( 1920 ), named from a dance originated during the epoch of Dr. Gaspar Francia. It was published in one of the magazines through whose pages scholars search today for plays of the early period. In 1912 a group of theatreloving friends of Luis Ruiz Gómez performed two of his plays: Amemos a nuestros hijos and Mostrarse humano. The manuscripts have disappeared. December, 1912, saw Paraguay's first revue, when Domínguez' Tierra guaraní, three scenes in one act of talking and singing, was performed. In 1915 visiting players held a competition for plays by Paraguayan dramatists, but results are not recorded. Perhaps La flor del valle, the three-act offering by Rafael Rodríguez Rojas (1859-1918), published in El Liberal that year, was one of the winners. Rojas later wrote Maria Victoria, which was performed in Concepción. His other plays were neither performed nor published locally, so eventually he moved to Buenos Aires, where he acquired a reputation as a bohemian. In May, 1915, the Chico de la Peña Dramatic Company, with the Paraguay-born Aurora Mendoza as leading lady, brought Asunción a repertory of plays by Ibsen, Benavente, and the Quinteros, as well as Nuestros hijos by Florencio Sánchez of Uruguay. The two-act comedy La cena de los románticos by Leopoldo Centurión (1893-1922), and his slow-moving but well-developed two-act drama El huracán, reminiscent of Spain's rural dramas, were performed the following year, after having previously been published in Letras.10 El huracán was influenced by El rento, by the Spaniard Vicente Medina. It is about a rural family who cannot pay the landlord; so they force the daughter to marry him instead of the farmer she loves. While the Centurion version does not specify time or setting, it has a few local ex10\n\nLetras, II (Asunción, 1916), 75-98.\n\n34\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\npressions and references. Centurión himself, tall, lean, and handsome, acted in it. Leo-Cen, as his friends called him, thus became the earliest contributor to the national Paraguayan theatre, whose activities were now beginning. He was one of an erratic group of drug-takers and suicides, though his own death came through tuberculosis. He founded the magazine La Crónica in 1913, in which he revealed himself as an ironic political commentator, but his last comedy of manners, El final de un cuento, performed in 1920, also reveals his caustic nature and his cynicism about human frailties. None of his plays is completely national. Other names should be included in this first wave of national dramatists. From the pen of Ignacio Alberto Pane (1880-1920) came La canción de las tijeras (1917), one of the three best plays composed by the generation of 1900. The other two were Una danza by O'Leary and the ironic Diálogo de los muertos by Moreno. AU are lost. Another of this group is Eloy Fariña Nuñez (1885-1929). This poet and philosopher was called \"The Guaraní with the Greek soul.\" He wrote a tragedy, Entre naranjos y cocoteros; a comedy La ciudad silenciosa; and two dramas, El Santo and El sonador. They still exist, because Fariña ended his career as a newspaper man in Buenos Aires, where the plays were performed and preserved. Now appeared what might be called the 1916-1923 school of dramatists, who wrote without stages or actors or much hope of performance.11 First was the dramatist who really put life into the Paraguayan theatre, Eusebio Aveiro Lugo (1890- ), whose first play, the three-act drama La chala, was performed by a group of Paraguayan amateurs at the National Theatre, November 5, 1917. Lugo's group, La Compañía Paraguaya de Dramas y Comedias, also performed other plays by him, which include the one-act Las ruinas del rosal (published in La Liberal, as was the one-act El camino de la fuente); a dialog, El hispano y la india; and the three-act drama La muerte de la quimera, also published in El Liberal. His last plays were the one-act Biblical Maria de Magdala and the historical La epopeya del mariscal, in three acts, about Dictator López, performed in 1926 by Carlos Brussa. Lugo was also the first president of the Sociedad Paraguaya de Autores Teatrales. 11 An unsigned article in La Democracia (Asunción), August 14, 1938, p. 5, lists as \"outstanding\" the six dramatists mentioned here.\n\nParaguayan Drama\n\n35\n\nAnother of this group was the poet and journalist Leopoldo Ramos Jiménez, ( 1896- ) who pioneered in Paraguay's social drama with his La inquisición del oro (1917), a tragedy about labor problems in the selva where the herb maté is grown. It was performed by the author and his friends in the Teatro Nacional. Later he wrote La herencia. Most productive of all playwrights of this period was the busy Dr. Pedro Juan Caballero (1900-1946), who was congressman, journalist, and professor at the School of Medicine, as well as the founder of the Compañía Paraguaya de Comedias, and author of nine realistic plays performed by it. Though he wrote with no national theatrical tradition behind him, his works were serious and sincere, with no striving for the easy laugh. They were realistic pictures of everyday life and were therefore national in spirit and locale. They included the four-act comedy about divorce, El pasado ( 1917) ; the three-act, back-to-nature comedy El imán ( 1918 ) ; the three-act El vencido (1923), about a medical student; followed by the medical El clinico ( 1923); Los buitres ( 1925), a tragedy about a girl who gave up an honest rustic lover for the snares of the city; El castigo; De pura cepa; and Cuestión de honor. None of them survives. After his death, his family, to whom his medical reputation was more important than his playwrighting, burned all his papers. In the years following, Carlos Frutos (1888-1926) wrote Para el amor no hay barreras (1918); and a priest, Arturo Tavarozz (1886- ), wrote the patriotic three-act tragedy El abanderado del Batallón 40 (1922), about the Paraguayan War of 1864-1870. Miguel Pecci Saavedra ( 1890- ), critic and humanist, wrote some excellent plays under the pen name \"Arnaldo Miriel,\" before he exiled himself to Buenos Aires—some say because of López Decoud's violent criticism of his Mona Lisa y Leonardo. His plays include the one-act Los convidados a una cena (1923); the three-act Maria del Carmen (1925), performed in Buenos Aires; Mona Lisa y Leonardo (1927); and the monolog Manos blancas ( 1924 ). J. Demetrio Morínigo (1895- ) was another dramatist of this period. Among his plays are Martirios de una madre o La venganza del coronel (1915), a three-act drama of the Paraguay War; Sor Felisa (1920), in three acts set in Venezuela and Paris; a two-act comedy, Amor que redime; El castigo, in three acts; and a three-act high comedy, Flor de arroyo. His most recent plays are El testamento de don Torcuato and Reivindacación.\n\n36\n\nBehind Spanish American Footlights\n\nBecause he began writing dramas at an early age, Benigno Villa ( 1901- ) must be included in this chapter. Practically all his plays are set in the country districts, with all or part of each written in the Guaraní language. In collaboration with Juan B. Otaño, Jr., he wrote a comedy, Chifladuras del día (1920), followed in 1926 by a bilingual, rural comedy, the costumbrista Guavirami. The brief Kurusu Isabel (\"The Cross of Isabel,\" 1930), based on a legend about miraculous powers ascribed to a cross placed at the scene of a tragic accident, was followed by the comedies Apayuai (\"Hodgepodge\") and Anichevene che yvro (\"No Longer a Fool\"), both of 1936. El amor rondaba cerca (1937), and the three-act Comedia de aficionados mark the end of his first period. In 1958 Villa began again with Casilda, an Enoch Arden play of the Paraguayan War, published in the first number of the Juvi series of plays started by two young Asunción publishers, Juan Villa Cabanas, the playwright's son, and Manuel Argüello. The series was intended to include the outstanding plays of the Paraguayan repertory. Twelve were announced for 1958-1959, and the fact that Casilda had gone into a"
