        "text": "‘ … and the dead shall inherit the Earth’\n\nCurse of the Blue Lights is a 1988 American supernatural horror film written and directed by John Henry Johnson, based on a story by Bryan Sisson. It stars Brent Ritter, Bettina Julius, Kent E. Fritzell and Willard Hall.\n\nA group of teenagers drive out of town to Make-Out Hill. While there they notice two mysterious blue lights floating around black surroundings.\n\nInvestigating a nearby cemetery, the teens discover demonic creatures attempting to bring an ancient demon god back to life so they enlist the help of a local witch to prevent this…\n\nReviews:\n\n“The acting contributes heavily to the hilarity at hand here, as well as the line delivery and how Loath and his minions always speak with a lisp due to the fake teeth they have to wear. Then there’s the climactic sword battle between Loath and one of the teens, which is easily the worst sword battle anyone has ever seen.” James Oxyer, Obscure Cinema 101\n\n“The prosthetic work on the monster characters was good enough to give them a creepy look but it also rendered their speech incomprehensible. At times, I would hear that a character was reciting their lines, but I would only understand a few of the words they said.” Jesse, HorrorNews.net\n\n” …has in interesting production design (particularly Loath’s dungeon), lighting, and make-up effects (courtesy of Return of the Living Dead’s Michael Spatola and The Resurrected’s Mark Sisson) what it almost thoroughly lacks in acting and storytelling.” Eric Cotenas, DVD Drive-In\n\n“Curse of the Blue Lights means well, and in spots shows some shimmer of a good concept, but stale and dated dialogue along with some of the worst acting I’ve ever seen damage the film far too much to even be remotely worth recommending.” Chris Nichols, The Trash Pile\n\n“The limited budget effects and talentless acting cripple an atmosphere otherwise served well by close attention to lore […] The zombies are unobjectionable, if conventional – certainly more interesting than the actors in the fake ghoul masks.” Peter Dendle, The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia\n\nBuy: Amazon.com | Amazon.co.uk | Amazon.ca\n\n“Curse of the Blue Lights exists almost entirely to showcase its monster effects and gory set pieces at the expense of any reasonable character development. That’s fine in this case, however, since the film manages to work up a reasonable level of charm and enthusiasm for its subject matter…” Nathaniel Thompson, Mondo Digital\n\n“Totally laughable with very weak make-up effects (which are, of course, called ‘spectacular’ on the box) and amateurish acting this is only good for laughs at the many horrid moments; otherwise it’s a miserable, miserable time. After an okay scarecrow opening attack it’s all into the toilet…” The Video Graveyard\n\nRelease:\n\nReleased in the US on videocassette by Magnum Entertainment in both rated (92m:30s) and unrated (95m:13s) editions.\n\nCode Red’s 2013 DVD release is an anamorphic widescreen (1.66:1) transfer of the R-rated version. The gore differences, other than a dissolving head and another head crushed by the Muldoon Man, are minor. Approximately 3m 16s of the difference is taken up by a daylight-set dialogue scene in a car that follows the opening attack by a scarecrow.\n\nFilming locations:\n\nPueblo, near Pikes Peak, Colorado, USA\n\nPC Game:\n\nIn 2015, a Hungarian team of game developers apparently created a 1980s Sierra-style PC game based on the movie.\n\nThere is also a version of the film dubbed into Hungarian:\n\nIMDb | Watch whole film online\n\nRelease info: DVD Drive-In | Image credits: HorrorNews.net | Mondo Digital\n\nAtacan las brujas “Attack of the Witches” aka Santo en Atacan las brujas – is a 1968 Mexican supernatural horror film directed by José Díaz Morales from a story and screenplay by Rafael García Travesi and Fernando Osés. It stars Santo, Lorena Velázquez and María Eugenia San Martín.\n\nA young woman has a strange dream featuring stuffed animals, lizards, sexy witches and their brawny henchmen, and a masked superman who is able to ward off evil by raising his arms in the sign of the cross.\n\nThe masked man turns out to be Santo and she asks for his help when her boyfriend is abducted by a witches’ coven…\n\nBuy DVD with English subs: Amazon.com | Amazon.co.uk\n\nReviews:\n\n“This dreamlike, atmospheric Santo effort is very different from the conventional Rene Cardona entries, and if you think it reminds you of Horror Hotel (aka City of the Dead), watch out for a clip borrowed from that very film!” George R. Reis, DVD Drive-In\n\n“The problem is that it really doesn’t have any story; it has some exposition to set up the situation, and then a series of repetitive events […] lots of low cut gowns and cleavage, miniskirted nighties on the big-legged minions of Satan, and somewhat sluggish fight scenes with Santo.” Dave Sindelar, Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings\n\n“This is a strange entry when compared to the more straightforward ‘monster mash’ Santo titles that seem to be more popular amongst fans. Not only does it have a moodier and darker atmosphere about it, and a few surreal moments…” Ian Jane, Rock! Shock! Pop!\n\nBasically, this is a cheaper remake of Santo vs. los mujeres vampiros, borrowing many plot and stylistic (the female vampires’ costumes, for instance) points from the earlier picture […] It isn’t as good as it’s predecessor, but it is, overall, mildly entertaining at best.” D.

The production was the brainchild of producer Steve Krantz, in an attempt to capitalize on the phenomenal success of ABC’s daytime serial Dark Shadows.\n\nKrantz hired actor-writer Ian Martin and veteran TV and radio producer Jerry Layton. The series was produced in Ottawa at CTV affiliate CJOH-TV and aired for 39 weeks, presenting three separate thirteen-week story arcs.\n\nBillionaire Jean Paul Desmond is a tragic character whose absolute refusal to accept the death of his beloved wife Erica on the remote Caribbean island of Maljardin leads him to a blasphemous defiance of God. He strikes an ill-fated bargain with the spirit of his sinister ancestor, Jacques Eloi des Mondes…\n\nReview:\n\nLike Dark Shadows, this TV horror soap opera suffers from the typical grueling combination of an excruciatingly low budget and rapid production schedule. Under such pressures, the actors barely have time for prep, and it shows, while the writers have little time to write, and it also shows; but this is neither the fault of the actors nor the writers, so they can’t be held responsible for much of the creative output.\n\nOn the contrary, they should be complimented for their relatively accomplished efforts under such parsimonious conditions. Although Strange Paradise was directly inspired by Dark Shadows, the writers were able to bring several original flourishes to the show, emphasizing intangibles such as voodoo, witchcraft, ghosts, curses, and transmigration, which contrasted subtly with Dark Shadows‘ focus on the more tangible creatures of the night.\n\nBoth programs abound in boring expositions, traces of silliness, and ample illogic, yet both also occasionally achieve magical, Brigadoonish flashes, capturing rare moments of Aeaean enchantment. It’s easy to toss Strange Paradise aside as kitschy trash but it’s more forthright and insightful to recognize its position as a minor fairy tale of the macabre.\n\nBen Spurling, HORRORPEDIA\n\nOther reviews:\n\n“The actors are poor and quite often struggle with their lines, the scripts are alternately boring and outrageous, the locations limited (many episodes simply cut back and forth between two sets) and, best of all, it occasionally tries to be hip and happening with highly amusing results….” Island of Terror\n\n“Strange Paradise, you heartless little minx, I wanted to hate you! And then first crack out of the box, you serve up a pixel-perfect artist’s rendering of what people who have never seen Dark Shadows think that Dark Shadows is like. The only way you could improve on this is to have a raven-haired girl run past, clad in a flimsy nightgown, and chased by a stagehand with a bat on a string.” Dark Shadows Every Day\n\nLater distribution:\n\nIn 1993, Centaur Distribution began issuing the series on videocassette. Eventually, 21 volumes were released on VHS, encompassing the first 105 installments of the series, before the project folded.\n\nWikipedia | IMDb\n\nImage credits: My Love-Haunted Heart\n\n‘A secret cult of lust-crazed witches torturing their victims with fire and desire!’\n\nDaughters of Satan is a 1972 American horror film directed by Hollingsworth Morse (The Ghost & Mrs. Muir; Pufnstuf) from a screenplay by John C. Higgins (The Black Sleep). The movie stars Tom Selleck, Barra Grant, Tani Guthrie, Paraluman, Vic Silayan and Vic Díaz.\n\nJames Robertson (Tom Selleck) buys a painting depicting witches being burned at the stake, one of whom bears an uncanny resemblance to his wife, Chris.\n\nUnfortunately, Chris is gradually taken over by the personality of the witch in the painting that she resembles, allies herself with two other reincarnated witches to plan James’ death, as he proves to be a descendant of the man responsible for the witches’ fate…\n\nDaughters of Satan will be released on Blu-ray by Scream Factory on April 24, 2018.\n\nBuy Blu-ray: Amazon.com\n\nReviews:\n\n“ …Daughters of Satan sports a slow first act, but it completely changes tones after about half an hour. The idea of evil witches emerging from a centuries old painting is cool enough to keep the eyes on the screen, and Tom Selleck really reminds the audience that in his prime, he was one bad ass dude.” Matt Molgaard, Horrorfreak News\n\n“The soundtrack is sure to appeal to those into oddball horror themes, as it’s filled with all sorts of those wacky ‘ooooeeeeeooooo’ sounds that are used all too infrequently these days. There are also a couple of nude flagellation scenes involving the lovely Ms. Grant that, while appealing from an exploitation standpoint, feel pretty out of place in what would otherwise be a strictly PG rated outing.” Ian Jane, Rock! Shock! Pop!\n\n“The whole thing plays like an extremely lame episode of The Twilight Zone, and Selleck doesn’t play at all.” TV Guide\n\n“It’s kind of silly satanic fun, and is so poorly made and acted that it’s all rather amusing. And there’s enough spookiness and people dying every few minutes to keep you interested. This is for lovers of bad movies only, as there really is nothing at all good about it, and the only amusement it can offer is in how very cheesy it is.” CdMScott, Cinema de Merde\n\n” …an early 1970s R-rated drive-in horror affair (with an abundance of bare breasts throughout). The film starts off promising with a light S&M sequence where a secret coven of witches whip a tied-up, nude Filipino woman over a bed of spikes. What follows is a mildly entertaining B flick, with more than a usual amount of confusion setting in.” George R. Reis, DVD Drive-In\n\n“The predictability of the plot and lifelessness of the direction render Daughters of Satan tame and, at 90 minutes overlong and rather dull. In minor ways it anticipates The Omen: aloof, menacing housekeeper turns up out of nowhere, hires herself to protect her satanic interests, keeps a big Rottweiler, a “familiar,” around the house and it growls menacingly at the protagonist, etc., etc.” Stuart Galbraith IV, DVD Talk\n\n” …some metaphysical mumbo jumbo, a few, obligatory seminude scenes and explicitly sexy talk. Miss Grant and Miss Guthrie are photogenic, if little else, and Mr. Selleck, a handsome, virile, mustachioed type, is natural in his confusion about the bewitchery.” A.H. Weiler, The New York Times\n\nChoice dialogue:\n\nKitty Duarte: “We were married for eleven years and he never once touched my breasts!”\n\nKitty Duarte: “Prove that you recommitted to Our Lord Satan.

Male witchcraft in evil terror!’\n\nHouse of the Black Death is a 1965 American film directed by Harold Daniels (Annabelle Lee; My World Dies Screaming) and Jerry Warren from a screenplay by Rich Mahoney, apparently based on R. Warner-Crozetti’s novel The Widderburn Horror. It stars Lon Chaney Jr., John Carradine and Andrea King.\n\nThe film is also known as Blood of the Man Beast (American alternative title), Blood of the Man Devil (American reissue title) and Night of the Beast (shooting title).\n\nReginald Le Borg (Diary of a Madman; The Black Sleep; The Mummy’s Ghost; et al) was the 2nd unit director.\n\nTwo brothers, both of whom are warlocks, use their powers and covens of witches to battle over the family fortune…\n\nReviews:\n\n“It’s embarrassing to see old time acting pros in such a rock-bottom movie, although in the cases of Carradine and Chaney, fans ought to have been used to it by this point. Chaney, in robe and cowl and sporting little forehead horns, often looks and acts quite innocent and amiable in his role as the evil warlock while Carradine, playing the kindly warlock, is scowly and sour-bellied.” Tom Weaver, John Carradine: The Films\n\n“John Carradine and Chaney give good performances as a pair of warlocks plagues by werewolves and belly dancers. With the teaming of hacks Warren and Le Borg, the cast is rendered powerless against this dull mess.” Alfred Eaker\n\nBuy DVD: Amazon.com\n\n“The only thing that saves this film from being a total failure are Lon Chaney Jr. and John Carradine who have the ability to make even the crappiest material palatable. And while the script was garbage, the basic story and premise of the film was actually okay. All it lacked was execution.” The Telltale Mind\n\n” …this incoherent mess of werewolves and witchcraft is pretty bottom of the barrel, though it is enlivened by good performances from Lon Chaney Jr. and John Carradine, and the occasional effective use of smoke and fog. Beyond that, this is good cure for insomnia.” Dave Sindelar, Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings\n\n“What’s really missing are any scenes with Carradine and Chaney together. There may have been scheduling difficulties but they do appear on the same set (a desperately unconvincing village square) so a ‘cutaway’ conversation should have been possible.” Mark David Welsh\n\n“This lackluster production is hampered by a weak story overstuffed with metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and spiced up with belly-dancers and cut-price werewolves, and it keeps its dueling warlocks (who look decidedly bored with the entire ordeal) from sharing any scenes together.” AllMovie\n\nMain cast and characters:\n\nLon Chaney Jr. as Belial Desard\n\nJohn Carradine as Andre Desard\n\nAndrea King as Dr. Katherine Mallory – Blackenstein; The Beast with Five Fingers\n\nTom Drake as Paul Dessard – Kolchak: The Night Stalker; The Spectre of Edgar Allan Poe; Deadly Inheritance\n\nDolores Faith as Valerie Dessard\n\nSabrina as Belly-dancer\n\nJerome Thor as Dr. Eric Campion\n\nSherwood Keith\n\nCatherine Petty\n\nGeorge Mitchell\n\nKatherine Victor as Lila\n\nMargaret Shinn\n\nWikipedia | IMDb\n\n‘A nightmare of illusion and betrayal’\n\nSpellbinder is a 1988 American romantic horror film directed by Janet Greek from a screenplay by Tracy Tormé. It stars Tim Daly, Kelly Preston, and Rick Rossovich.\n\nLos Angeles attorney Jeff Mills and his friend Derek Clayton rescue a young beautiful woman, Miranda Reed, from an apparently abusive boyfriend.\n\nMiranda has no home so Jeff offers her to stay at his house. But as the two became lovers, Jeff learns that Miranda is on the run from a witches’ coven.\n\nUnfortunately, the coven needs Miranda back as a sacrifice at the winter solstice. She must, however, go to them of her own free will, and the coven tries to force her into doing so, using sorcery to taunt and terrify the two of them. Miranda tells Jeff about her grim situation, but not the entire truth…\n\nReviews:\n\n“Spellbinder doesn’t wind up as tightly as it could, but select moments are pulled off with care, finding Torme channeling The Wicker Man as Jeff encounters forces he doesn’t understand, focused intently on his mission to defend his love. Daly deserves credit for committing entirely to the picture, which retains its fair share of silly business, including a showdown around Jeff’s home as Satanists gather outside, peering and bending the windows.” Brian Orndorf, Blu-ray.com\n\n“Spellbinder isn’t all that good but it is oddly watchable. Besides, you have to stay until the end to see Kelly Preston’s devil dance in the sheer white nightie. [..] What this movie really needed was some kind of dynamic lighting to help with the mood. I mean this is a Satan movie with lots of potentially eerie images but everything was so broadly lit across the board that it kind of just sapped away at the creepiness…” Christopher Armstead, Film Critics United\n\n“A pretty hokey mix of occult chills and marginally sexy thrills, Spellbinder is deadly in its predictability and more or less screams in your face about where it’s heading very quickly but it moves at a good pace and offers up enough skin and satanic hijinks that easily amused trash movie fans will dig what this movie delivers.” Ian Jane, Rock! Shock! Pop!\n\n“The movie also has a few good scare scenes, like one in which the faces of all the members of the coven suddenly appear crowded around a window, staring in. A slickly made example of how Hollywood made money off of the Satanic panic of the 1980s, Spellbinder is essentially The Wicker Man set in Los Angeles and is more entertaining than Neil LaBute’s actual remake.” Jedadiah Leland, Through the Shattered Lens\n\nCast and characters:\n\nTimothy Daly as Jeff Mills\n\nKelly Preston as Miranda Reed\n\nRick Rossovich as Derek Clayton\n\nAudra Lindley as Mrs. White\n\nAnthony Crivello as Aldys\n\nCary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Lieutenant Lee\n\nDiana Bellamy as Grace Woods\n\nJames Watkins as Tim Weatherly\n\nKyle T.

It grossed $657,446 domestically at the box office.\n\nWikipedia | IMDb\n\nHex is a 2017 British folk horror drama film written and directed by George Popov and Jonathan Russell. It stars Tony Broadbent, Suzie Frances Garton and Daniel Oldroyd.\n\nDuring the English Civil War, two opposing soldiers find themselves trapped in a forest controlled by a witch…\n\nReviews:\n\n” …Popov and Russell are able to kit out their few characters in authentic-seeming period gear and make good use of the wilderness. Performances are fine, and the gradual stress on eeriness is effective – there are comparatively few outright scare scenes, and some depend on odd details…” The Kim Newman Web Site\n\n“The build of tension is a little too slow at first, but by the final scenes you won’t be able to look away as the men finally uncover something of the truth. I loved the historical setting, but despite the distance of centuries there’s a great deal here that anyone can relate to, thanks to a solid script and convincing acting.” The Movie Critic Next Door\n\n“There is more happening here than you realize, and it’s to the filmmakers’ credit that you only recognize the film’s purpose when they are ready for you to do so. The result is a satisfying tale with more power than just magic.” Hope Madden, Madd Wolf\n\n“The silent imagery was purposeful, and it doesn’t fill the story with traditional horror elements, but still crafts some eerie scenes that capture the dread of the plots subject-matter with thought provoking result. This is a movie any film-maker should watch if they feel their current project is hindered by a budget.” The Silverscreen Analysis\n\n“Despite some slowness in the film at places and dark nighttime scenes overall it is well done […] But this additionally has rich dialogue, taut direction, beautiful cinematography and some of the best audio capture I’ve heard that captures every distinct sound, as well what lies beneath the story is thought provoking.” Toxic Fletch\n\nIMDb"
