        "text": "Cine Las Americas International Film Festival, the annual Austin celebration of movies from across the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, returns to the big screen after two pandemic years tomorrow night with El Buen PatrÃ³n.\n\nWritten and directed by Fernando LeÃ³n de Aranoa (Loving Pablo), the satire stars Javier Bardem as a factory boss who goes to increasingly extreme ends to protect his shot at an award. The festival opener was Spain's submission for the 94th Academy Awards for Best International Feature Film, and so it's only fitting that the fest ends with another Oscar hopeful: Deserto Particular (Private Desert), Brazil's contender from last year.\n\nAs always, Cine Las Americas is global in its reach, with films from as far afield as Uruguay, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Canada, and, yes, the U.S. Executive Director Gabriel Ornelas said, âThis year marks another huge step both in a return to theatregoing normalcy, but also looking very much toward the future and filmmaker development for our Austin and Texas-based filmmakers as well as our student filmmakers. Interweaving that focus with the wonderful lineup of films we have this year offers the best of both worlds as far as we are concerned.â\n\nLeading the lineup for the HET film (that's Hecho en Tejas) programming is double South by Southwest award winner What We Leave Behind, Iliana Soza's moving documentary about her grandfather and his life across the border. It's complemented by a wide array of shorts from across the Lone Star State, including Maximiliano Benitez's \"Lift a Weight\" and Elias Posada's \"Save the Block,\" filmed in Austin.\n\nCine Las Americas runs June 8-12 at at AFS Cinema, 6406 N. I-35, and the Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center, 600 River. Tickets and info at cinelasamericas.org/film-festival.

The immediate execution of all Haitians on Dominican soil has been ordered â the so-called âCutâ â and what seals a victimâs fate is whether or not they can pronounce \"perejil\" (\"parsley\").

However, Valero is not at all comfortable with Pep retiring. He doubts Moha has what it takes, or that customers will accept a Moroccan worker. Maybe six days are not enough to make somebody change, to make him overcome his prejudices. Maybe it's not enough time to make a new friend.
