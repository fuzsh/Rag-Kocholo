My father, Georg Wiltheis, died 2 years ago an I received his papers conce rning our familytree (please forgive my english, but I hope you will unter stand me.) I found it amazing. My father died to early, because he could n ot see, that the Mormones opend their archives. And one day I gave in t he name \"Wiltheis\" and \"Wiltheis\" and it was surprise what I found ther e. We knew that Georg Heinrich Wiltheis, born 13.10.1847, emigrated to t he USA, but that was all. And now..... it is overwelming to see how many W iltheis and Wiltheiss live in the USA an they are ALL related. Their ances tors came all from Friedberg, a little town in Hessen, Germany. And tod ay I found your Homepage and your question about Jacob. Perhaps I can he lp you if you habe a birthdate of Jacob and the name of his wife - if he h as one. I have all the papers here with me. Our familytree \"starts\" in t he year 1642. I have to go to bed now - this is difficult because of all t he news I found here. I have already contact with a woman called Lydia Sta nds, she is the doughter of Barry van Hoogen and Carla Wiltheis. I ho pe I will hear from you and I am looking forward to this... greetings fr om Germany and thang God for the Internet!!!

On the 22d of October, 1829, he married Miss Elizabeth Short, of Hamilton County, Ohio, where s he was born January 20, 1809. Mr. Botkin moved to Shelby County with his f amily in 1832, entered, made improvements, and settled on a part of Secti on 5, Dinsmore Township, on which he lived and conducted the business of f arming in connection with dealing in stock, until the time of his death, w hich occurred April 29, 1858. His companion died March 19, 1839, leaving h im with four small children, viz., Martha, Russell, Robert, and Hanna h. In the fall of 1840 he married Miss Jane Elliott, daughter of Corneli us and Elizabeth Elliott, who was born in Licking County, Ohio, April 4, 1 824, and came to Shelby County with her parents in 1835. By this uni on he reared a family of six children, viz., Sarah M., John W., Alexande r, Selvenis, Emma J., and Charles S., all of whom are now living except Em ma J., who died in October, 1878. Mrs. Botkin is still residing on the o ld home farm near Botkins Station. Mr. Botkin was one of the most energetic, enterprising bu siness men in the township, and at his death the church of which he w as a member (viz., the Methodist Episcopal) lost one of its best member s, and Dinsmore Township one of its leading citizens. After Mr. Botkin's f irst entry of land, he made other purchases of land until he owned sever al hundred acres in the vicinity of where Botkins village is now located. During the erection of the Dayton and Michigan Rai lroad, he contracted and graded three miles of the roadbed. He donat ed to the railroad company the right of way through his land, nearly a mi le in length, with the understanding that the company would give him a sta tion on his land, at the most convenient point for the accommodation of the citize ns in the neighborhood. In his will, a short time prior to his death, he o rdered a town to be laid out, which was done soon after his death, and giv en the name of Botkins in honor of him and to perpetuate his name.\" Hope t his explains the origins of the Village of Botkins.\n\n[HI68691] (Research):1860 Shelby Co., OH census Page: p. 319b Text: 611/611 Jane Botkin, 36fOH, farmer worth 4000/800; John W., 15mOH; Alexander, 12mOH; Sylvanus, 9mOH; Emily 6fOH;\n\nCharles 3mOH\n\n[HI68692] (Research):Shelby County Guardianship Pg 366 5/8/1858 Joseph Elliott appt gdn for J ohn Westley Botkin 13 yrs 1 Nov 1857; Alexander Botkin, 9 yrs Nov __ 185 7; Sylvanus Botkin 7 yrs 4 June 1858; Emma Jane Botkin 4 yrs 22Jan 1858; a nd Charles Sumner Botkin 1 yr 6 Mar 1858 ; minor heirs of Richard Botki n, deceased.

He was born in Harris on township, Champaign County and lived there until fifteen years of age w hen he went to Zanesfield, Logan county, where he was employed as a cle rk in Samuel Taylor's store. Thence to West Liberty where he clerked in t he dry goods store of 0. T. Candiff and was bookkeeper in R. E. Runkle's w arehouse, and cashier in the Logan County and West Liberty banks. In 18 59 he moved to Urbana where he was employed as bookkeeper at the old ste am tannery, which was then rather extensively engaged in the manufactu re of patent leather,R.E. Runkle, his old employer, being its proprieto r. For a short period during Col. James B. Armstrong's term of servi ce in the army in the war for the Union, Mr. Davis was cashier of his ban k, then the Citizens' and now the Citizens' National Bank. in 1862 he enga ged in the tanning business on his own account and as an instance of the r isk business undertakings then involved, it may be mentioned that Mr. Dav is borrowed his capital of Henry Weaver, at twelve per cent, per annum pay able semi-annually in advance. He was successful in this enterprise, b ut on the close of the war in 1865 went to Mechanicsburg and with R. D. Wi lliams, Esq., organized the Fanner's Bank, with which he is still connecte d. Williams & Davis were sole proprietors until 1873 when it was reorganiz ed as a joint stock company and its capital increased to $100,000, a ll of which was immediately paid in. Its business is large and increasi ng and it may be truthfully characterized as one of the strongest and be st managed private banks in Central Ohio. It recently moved into its new o ffice, one of the finest in the country and is an institution in which Mec hanicsburg takes a pardonable pride. Mr. Davis is the son of the late Benj amin Davis, Esq., of Harrison township, who was for many years one of t he Commissioners of Champaign county and for forty years a Justice of t he Peace of his own township. He has two daughters-Miss Lizzie Williams, t he widow of Mr. R. Cool Williams, son of R. D Williams, Esq., Preside nt of the Farmers' Bank and Mrs. Pet Hunt, wife of E. C.

For the fir st time a resident of the city has been visited by a crowd of masked me n, who have felt called upon to take the law into their own ~hands and adm inister a punishment which they believed due. Whether the law-abiding peop le of this city approve or denounce such action as lawful or unlawfu l, we are not fully prepared to state.\n\nThe CITIZEN does not propose to shield anybody, nor does it desire to s it by and see WHITE CAPS come in to this city, under the cover of night, a nd take the law into their own hands. We believe there is a law adequate f or the punishment of all offenses and that it should be meted out prompt ly and fearlessly. If such was the case, there would be fewer offenses com mitted.\n\nlast night about midnight a body of men called at the residence of A N Mid dleton, on East Court Street. They cane for the purpose of putting into ex ecution the tactics of the WHITE CAPS. They gathered with a quietness th at did not in the leastdisturb the neighborsï¿½-indeed so quietly did they c ome, that the slumbers of the nearest neighbors were not disturbed. The ch astisement was inflicted and the WHITE CAPS gone, before anyone else kn ew that they were in the neighborhood.\n\nSince the trouble in the Middleton household, Mrs If iddleton and the chil dren have been staying at the home of her uncle west of the city. A few da ys since her father Darius Taylor arrived from Dakota with the intenti on of taking his daughter and children to his Western home. Since Mrs Midd leton left, her husband has been staying alone at his home except taht Jer ry Wornell, a colored man, was in the habit of staying with and watching h im.\n\nMiddieton was sitting in front of his house, while Wornell was upstairs ge tting his bed ready to retire. While this was going on a party of WHITE CA PS came in through the back yeard, and quietly slipped up to where the obj ect of their viist WaS sitting. Instantly a rope was thrown over the he ad of their victim, and he was seized by a half dozen strong men, and drag ged into the house. He was bound hands and feet and and gagged. His clothi ng was torn from his body, excepting his pants and shoes. The leader thenc alled out, ï¿½Number Seven, do your work.ï¿½ With this command one of the WHI TE CAPS began to lash their victim with a whip, Just what was used is n ot known, but it is supposed to have been a raw hide. The blows did n ot do much damage, but left the marks upon the back of the object of the ir wrath. After they had completed their work they left.\n\nJerry Wornell, who was upstaris, head the commotion, and started to come d own. He was immediately confronted by three men, with drawn revolvers a nd ordered back. He went to a side room and climbed out the second story w indow and ran up the street for the police. He met officer Williams, who b lew his whistle for assistance. This brought officer Kinna and Kanenau gh to his help, and they hastened .to the scene. But the WHITE CAPS had fi nished their work and had gone. Soon Sheriff Saxbe appeared on the scen e, but it was too late to capture any of the perpetrators. When the office rs arrived, the victim had regained consiciousness and succeeded in getti ng his hand loose and cutting the strings that held the gag and those whi ch bound his feet and hands.\n\nWho the party~was composed of is not known, though Hr Niddleton is of t he opinion that he knew some of them. Some believe they came from Westvill e, others from another direction. But the probabilities are that they resi de in Urbana. Sheriff Saxbe has the pieces of rope that bound their victi m. There are two pieces of quarter inch rope about ten feet long and anoth er piece about five feet long. No clue has been found to the crowd and pro bably never will be. The statutesmake this offense. liable to.a penitentia ry sentence and for that reason those engaged will not be likely to say mu ch about it.\n\nNiddleton was able to be out this morning but was so weak physically th at he could hardly offer resistance to a boy of twelve years, so that he w as in no condition to offer any defense. This the first visit of WHITE CA PS to Urbana and we trust that it will be the last.\n\nURBANA DAILY CITIZEN Fri, Aug 2 1889\n\nTHE REASON ?\n\nLast night Officers Kinna and Kavanaugh arrested A N Ptiddleton, and lock ed him up on three charges, namely:for being intoxicated, for disorderly c onduct and abusiing his famiIy. This morning a suit was filed in the Cou rt Of Common Pleas by his wife, Allie Middleton, for an injunction and ali mony, Pending a hearing of the charge Mrs Middleton and her three childr en are staying at her uncleï¿½s, Simeon Taylorï¿½s west of the city.\n\nTHE URBANA CITIZEN Sat 20 Jul 1889abstracted by Pat Stickley\n\n[HI68862] (Research):The News last week mentioned the romantic reunion of two brothers who h ad been parted from infancy. The facts. have since been obtained fr om Mr Ed Williams, who say be considered the hero of the story whi ch is as follows.\n\nSome forty years ago in a small town in Champaign County, Ohio, the paren ts of Edward and William Williams resided. The mother died when William w as but two days old and Edward between four and five years. Ed, as he is k nown by all his acquaintances, remembers that shortly after this his fath er with himself and the babe, his uncle and aunt, and some other partie s, went in a stage to a large town.\n\nThe babe, was left and he and his father continued on some days longer. T he large town he has since learned was Columbus and the place where he a nd his father stopped, and where his uncle Richard Williams then reside d, was Coshocton. Two years and a half after that his father was drowned [ in the White Woman River) and he went to live with his uncle, Richard Will iams, where he remained until ten years of age, when the uncleï¿½s wife di ed and he was thrown on the world and shifted for himself from that time f orward. His uncle went away, giving him in care of John Martin, a citiz en of Kenton, Ohio. He had a dim shadowy recollection of numerous relative s, but had forgotten their names or where they lived. He managed to exsi st ~ his wits and labor, obtaining most of his education in the scho ol of the world, until the war came on when he enlisted and served a te rn in the army.\n\nAfterwards he formed the acquaintance of Irene N Caldwell, daughter of Cha rles W Caldwell, of Pretty Prairie, Champaign County, and was married Augu st 1,1869, and settled in business at Kenton, Ohio, where he seems to ha ve been fairly prosperous. Some two years ago he concluded to try to fi nd his relatives, and with this object advertised in the Cincinnati Enquir er. By this it was learned that the uncle with whom he had lived w as in St Joseph, Missouri. Through him he learned that the maiden na me of his mother was French, and he got the address of seven of his brothe rs, all living. Some of these lived in Ohio, and he hunted them up and for med their acquaintance, all of his uncles and aunts remembering him as a c hild, but never having heard from him since the death of his mother. Throu gh them he learned that the baby brother had been adopted by a family nam ed Huntington, in Columbus, who subsequently removed to New York. The ne xt step was to advertise in the New York papers for this family, and the n ame and address of one of.the daughters was obtained. Through corresponden ce with her it was learned that another daughter was Mrs Gardner P Wood s, of Sugar loaf, in this [Boulder) County. She informed him that the ba by had taken the name of Orrin Williams Huntington, and grown up as a memb er of the family meyer knew he was adopted] and was also a resident of th is county. He then wrote to Mrs Woods and his brother, and this was the fi rst intimation to the brother that he was adopted and had a brother. Mrs W oods reeesbered Ed as a child. This correspondence led to a visit by the e lder b~rother last week, and the two strangely reunited brothers gazed up on each other for the first tue since infancy. After spending some weeks t ogether he started for home, as he expressed hmiself thoroughly satisfie d, intending to visit two uncles [his motherï¿½s brothers] in Ewing, Nebrask a, on his way back, and his uncle Richard Williams, at St Joseph, n o. Ed is a hearty whole-souled, wide awake man of the world, who evident ly enjoys life, while Orrin is well known in this communtiy as a quiet, ho nest, good citizen, still single, but they sees to be entirely dissimil ar in appearance and temperament. [Boulder Newsï¿½Colo Mrs Ed Williams, now of Ada, Ohio, not Kenton, is well known in this ci ty and vicinity. She is we think related to the Rawlings, Knight, Todd a nd Caidwell families, a most respectable connection and is herself a wort hy lady.
