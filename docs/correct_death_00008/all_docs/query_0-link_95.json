Johnson. Services were held in his memory at the First Presbyterian church by his pastor, Rev. J.B. Brice. Mr. McCann was 85 years, 7 months and 5 days old at the time of his death. He is survived by one daughter, Mrs. George Cline, two sons, A. J. of Fairchance, and Hugh at home, besides a number of grandchildren. Jackson McCann was a son of Hugh McCann, a soldier of the War of 1812, whose remains lie in the vacant lot along the Water street on the east side of town. Mr. McCann was among the first who went out to battle for his country's flag and was in the first battle of Bull Run, on that notable Sunday of July 21, 1861. He has often described the battle and the panic that followed. There were thousands who had gone out from Washington to see the battle, just like people go out today to see a ball game. Mr. McCann was a hard working man all his life, up until recent years. He was kindly rewarded by his government with a liberal pension which enabled him to live comfortably in his own home during his old age.\n\nMorning Herald, \"Klondike Happenings,\" by John W.

Oliver W. Martin of Dunbar found the remains, partially covered by a coat, at 9 a.m., in Irishtown, in a heavily-wooded area. When the victim disappeared four years ago, it was believed that she was on her way to visit his parents, Dennis Martin, since deceased, and Mrs. Agnes Martin, now of Dunbar, who at the time lived in the Irishtown area. Mrs. David Foltz of Connellsville, a niece of the missing woman, identified the coat found with the body as one she had given her aunt in 1960. Also used to establish identification were a torn dress, a pair of glasses and dentures. The victim apparently became lost and died of exposure, according to state police and Deputy Coronor F. Todd Burhans of Dunbar. At the time an unsuccessful search was conducted in a heavy snowstorm. She was born Sept. 12, 1886, in Dunbar Township, near where the body was found. She was a daughter of the late John and Lois Swope McClain. Surviving are a son, William of Dunbar; two brothers, Frank of Allison and Charles of Smithfield, and a grandchild.
