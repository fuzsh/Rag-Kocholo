        "text": "Jazz died in 1959.\n\nThere may be cool individuals who say they play Jazz, but ain’t shit cool about Jazz as a whole.\n\nJazz died when cool stopped being hip.\n\nJazz was a limited idea to begin with.\n\nJazz is a label that was forced upon the musicians.\n\nThe musicians should’ve never accepted that idea.\n\nJazz ain’t shit.\n\nJazz is incestuous.\n\nJazz separated itself from American popular music.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nThe music never recovered.\n\nOrnette tried to save Jazz from itself by taking the music back to its New Orleanian roots, but his efforts were too esoteric.\n\nJazz died in 1959, that’s why Ornette tried to “Free Jazz” in 1960.\n\nJazz is only cool if you don’t actually play it for a living.\n\nJazz musicians have accepted the idea that it’s OK to be poor.\n\nJohn Coltrane is a bad cat, but Jazz stopped being cool in 1959.\n\nThe very fact that so many people are holding on to this idea of what Jazz is supposed to be is exactly what makes it not cool.\n\nPeople are holding on to an idea that died long ago.\n\nJazz, like the Buddha, is dead.\n\nLet it go, people, let it go.\n\nPaul Whiteman was the King of Jazz and someday all kings must fall.\n\nJazz ain’t cool, it’s cold, like necrophilia.\n\nStop fucking the dead and embrace the living.\n\nJazz worries way too much about itself for it to be cool.\n\nJazz died in 1959.\n\nThe number one Jazz record is Miles Davis’ Kind Of Blue.\n\nDave Brubeck’s Time Out was released in 1959.\n\n1959 was the coolest year in Jazz.\n\nJazz is haunted by its own hungry ghosts.\n\nLet it die.\n\nYou can be martyrs for an idea that died over a half a century if y’all want.\n\nJazz has proven itself to be limited, and therefore, not cool.\n\nLot’s wife turned to a pillar of salt from looking back.\n\nJazz is dead.\n\nMiles ahead.\n\nSome may say that I’m no longer the same dude who recorded the album with Doc Cheatham.\n\nCorrect: I’m not the same dude I was 14 years ago.\n\nIsn’t that the point?\n\nOur whole purpose on this planet is to evolve.\n\nThe Golden Age of Jazz is gone.\n\nLet it go.\n\nToo many necrophiliacs in Jazz.\n\nYou’re making my case for me.\n\nSome people may say we are defined by our limitations.\n\nI don’t believe in limitations, but yes, if you believe you are limited that will define you.\n\nDefinitions are retrospective.\n\nAnd if you find yourself getting mad, it’s probably because you know Jazz is dead.\n\nWhy get upset if what I’m saying doesn’t ring true?\n\nI can’t speak for anyone else, but I don’t play Jazz.\n\nI play Postmodern New Orleans music.\n\nLouis Armstrong and Danny Barker play Traditional New Orleans Music.\n\nEllis Marsalis and James Black play Modern New Orleans music.\n\nKidd Jordan and Clyde Kerr play Avant-garde New Orleans music.\n\nDonald Harrison plays Neoclassical New Orleans music.\n\nI play Postmodern New Orleans music.\n\nI am a part of a lineage.\n\nI am a part of a blood line.\n\nMy ancestors didn’t play Jazz, they played Traditional, Modern and Avant-garde New Orleans Music.\n\nI don’t play Jazz.\n\nI don’t let others define who I am.\n\nI am a Postmodern New Orleans musician.\n\nI create music for the head and the heart, for the beauty and the booty.\n\nThe man who lets others define him is a dead man.\n\nWith all due respect to the masters, they were victims of a colonialist mentality.\n\nBlacks have been conditioned for centuries to be grateful for whatever crumbs thrown to them.\n\nAs a postmodern musician, it’s my duty to do better than my predecessors.\n\nTo question, reexamine and redefine what it is that we do.\n\nThey accepted it because they had to.\n\nBecause my ancestors opened the door for me, I don’t have to accept it.\n\nLouis bowed and scraped so Miles could turn his back.\n\nIt’s called evolution.\n\nIt’s the colonialist mentality that glorifies being treated like a slave.\n\nThere is nothing romantic about poor, scuffling Jazz musicians.\n\nFuck that idea.\n\nIt’s not cool.\n\nJazz is a lie.\n\nAmerica is a lie.\n\nPlaying Jazz is like running on a treadmill: you may break a sweat, but ultimately you ain’t going nowhere.\n\nSome people may say we are limited.\n\nI say, we are as limited as we think.\n\nI am not limited.\n\nJazz is a marketing ploy that serves an elite few.\n\nThe elite make all the money while they tell the true artists it’s cool to be broke.\n\nOccupy Jazz!\n\nI am not speaking of so-called Jazz’s improvisational aspects.\n\nImprovisation by its very nature can never be passé, but mindsets are invariably deadly.\n\nNot knowing is the most you can ever know.\n\nIt’s only when you don’t know that “everything” is possible.\n\nJazz has nothing to do with music or being cool.\n\nIt’s a marketing idea.\n\nA glaring example of what’s wrong with Jazz is how people fight over it.\n\nPeople are too afraid to let go of a name that is killing the spirit of the music.\n\nLife is bigger than music, unless you love and/or play Jazz.\n\nThe art, or lack thereof, is just a reflection.\n\nMiles Davis personified cool and he hated Jazz.\n\nWhat is Jazz anyway?\n\nLife isn’t linear, it’s concentric.\n\nWhen you’re truly creating you don’t have time to think about what to call it.\n\nWho thinks of what they’ll name the baby while they’re fucking?\n\nPlaying Jazz is like using the rear-view mirror to drive your car on the freeway.\n\nIf you think Jazz is a style of music, you’ll never begin to understand.\n\nIt’s ultimately on the musicians.\n\nPeople are fickle and follow the pack.\n\nNot enough artists willing to soldier for their shit.\n\nPeople follow trends and brands.\n\nSo do musicians, sadly.\n\nJazz is a brand.\n\nJazz ain’t music, it’s marketing, and bad marketing at that.\n\nIt has never been, nor will it ever be, music.\n\nHere lies Jazz (1916 – 1959).\n\nToo many musicians and not enough artists.\n\nI believe music to be more of a medium than a brand.\n\nSilence is music, too.\n\nYou can’t practice art.\n\nIn order for it to be true, one must live it.\n\nExistence is not contingent upon thought.\n\nIt’s where you choose to put silence that makes sound music.\n\nSound and silence equals music.\n\nSometimes when I’m soloing, I don’t play shit.\n\nI just move blocks of silence around.\n\nThe notes are an afterthought.\n\nSilence is what makes music sexy.\n\nSilence is cool.\n\nThe End\n\n– Nicholas Payton"
