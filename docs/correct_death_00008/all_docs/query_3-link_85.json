        "text": "Joseph “Joe” Myrle Davis, age 82, passed into eternal life with his heavenly Father on December 21, 2023 at ShareHaven Evergreen in Oshkosh, WI, with his family at his side.\n\nJoe was born November 5, 1941 in Oshkosh, WI, the youngest son of James Burton and Blanche Genarose (Mares) Davis. He attended St. Peter’s Catholic School before graduating from Oshkosh High School in 1959. It was in high school that Joe, remembered as confident and boisterous, met the quieter Kathleen Ann Hudy. Their unwavering love brought Joe and Kathy together in marriage on May 25, 1963, at St. Peter’s in Oshkosh.\n\nAfter several years of working as a diesel mechanic, Joe and Kathy moved their growing family in 1971 to the small town of Princeton, WI. At their house in the countryside they remained for the next 50 years, raising their four children, Cindy, Missy, Tim, and Jessie, and later welcoming their ten grandchildren for birthdays and family holidays. Joe was a long-time member of St. John the Baptist Parish and liked attending the Princeton flea market.\n\nJoe was a committed father and husband, supporting his family through millions of miles on the road as he drove semi-trucks for the Condon Companies. He hauled gas and tires to countless cities across the state and country, known by his fellow drivers as “The Bean Picker” for all the green bean farms around the Princeton area. He loved taking his children, and later his grandchildren, for rides in the semi-truck, proudly explaining how to operate the stick shift.\n\nHe retired in 2006 after 35 years of reliable service.\n\nWhen back home and off the road, Joe spent time with his numerous hobbies, which included expanding his treasured coin collection, performing meticulous yard work, and feeding the birds. He also enjoyed crafting hundreds of homemade bird houses, along with harvesting hickory nuts from his trees in the fall. A passionate outdoorsman, Joe’s favorite stories were from his numerous fishing and hunting trips with family and friends. An avid hunter and fisherman, Joe loved maintaining his hunting land, as he was always on the lookout for next season’s trophy buck. He was a proud member of the National Rifle Association. It was seldom to pass by any lake that Joe had not fished, taking his boat to local spots and favorite places up north in Michigan or Canada. He patiently unwound “bird’s nests” from his eager grandkids’ fishing lines and excitedly point out bald eagles flying high above.\n\nWith a love to travel, Joe looked forward to road trips with his family, pulling his big fifth-wheel camper to beautiful state parks and national landmarks. He enjoyed spending time around a campfire, playing favorite card games, and telling stories of his pet raccoon. With a hilarious sense of humor and joy for life unlike any other, Joe will live on in our hearts and minds with each new ray of sunlight and every song of birds in the air.\n\nJoe will be remembered dearly by his wife, Kathy, in which they celebrated 60 years of marriage this year. He will be known forever as “Dad” to his children and their spouses: Cynthia (Bruce) Beilfuss of Crystal Falls, MI; Michelle (Mel) Tuchowski of Kingsford, MI; Timothy (Nancy) Davis of Ripon, WI; and Jessica Davis (Chad Agamaite) of Ripon, WI.\n\n“Papa” will be missed by his ten grandchildren: Brendan (Caroline) Tuchowski; Alec Tuchowski (Lauren Myers); Brianna (Mitch) Jorgensen; Marissa Davis; Marena (Brandon) Miller; Porter Beilfuss; Wilson Agamaite; Kai Agamaite; Cale Agamaite; and Cash Agamaite.\n\nJoe is survived by his brother, Dan (Pat) Davis of Oshkosh, WI; sisters, Ceil Breister of Oshkosh, WI, Marilyn (Stan) Breager of Oshkosh, WI, Colleen (Louie) Wilmot of Sheboygan, WI; and sister-in-law, Nancy Davis of Oshkosh, WI. He is also survived by numerous nieces and nephews, along with special friends and long-time neighbors.\n\nJoe was preceded in death by his parents, James B. “Jim” and Blanche Davis; in-laws, Julius and Lucille Hudy; brother, James G. “Jerry” Davis; brother-in-law, Dave Breister; and nephews Gregory Davis and Scott Davis.\n\nThe family would like to express their gratitude for the staff and hospice care team at the ShareHaven Evergreen memory care unit for taking care of Joe as his condition progressed. As his diagnosis took his mind further and further away from us, your compassion and support meant the world, especially in his final days."
