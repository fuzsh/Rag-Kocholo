        "text": "Oh it's true. I'm a rock music fan. I don't get jazz. I don't understand what they're doing or why it's interesting. I can get into the slippery groove for a few minutes, but then quickly lose my way in all the improvisations, solos and such. Plus there's not enough really loud guitars. I've tried though. I've got some John Coltrane, some Eric Dolphy, a little Herbie Mann, some Thelonius Monk, a bit of Ornette Coleman, a smidge of Cannonball Adderly, a dollop of Dave Brubeck - and WAY too many Miles Davis records. All for your pleasure! Having played and recorded from 1946 pretty darn regularly until his death in 1991, trumpet player/bandleader Miles Davis has an infinite number of albums, the entirety of which I have no intention of ever purchasing. However, my particular collection hits on what I'm told are the pinnacles of his career - his \"bop,\" his early quintet \"cool jazz\" days, his orchestral work, his modal stuff, his fusion experiments and most importantly his Cyndi Lauper cover. So read on to see what a guy who doesn't know or care much at all about jazz has to say about one of the most famous jazz musicians of all time! With no further adoodoo, Mild David! Birth Of The Cool - Capitol 1989.\n\nLots of tootin'! This was recorded in 1948 and I suppose is what you'd call \"Cool Jazz.\" All the tunes are mellow, with none of those loud trumpet blasts that make me hate horns so much. The musicians sound exceptionally well practiced, with nine different fellows playing the same melodies together until one of them gets his chance to solo, then they hop back in to the main riff. Some of these jazz melodies are really nice and catchy - not to mention COMPLICATED AS HELL (I'm particularly fond of the upbeat shindig \"Move,\" the beautiful, slow \"Moon Dreams,\" plus \"Deception\" and \"Rocker,\" though I've forgotten what they sound like at the moment), but too much of this is just... I don't know. I don't want to throw the term \"elevator music\" around, but this crap is WAY before my time - way before even the advent of my beloved rock and roll. It's not that I hate the style. The style itself lends itself to some incredibly listenable, calming music. Everybody uses lots of mutes and nobody tries to blast your head off. So the style is fine. It's the actual songs that seem lacking to me. First of all, I have no interest in hearing people solo. I realize that it's a main component of jazz music (and even rock), but it's just not what I'm into. I prefer the parts where they do all kinds of complex stuff together. And there IS a lot of that on here. But not enough. Too many of the songs just don't DO IT. Tunes like \"Venus De Milo,\" \"Israel\" and \"Rouge\" just don't seem to have any GrOuNdInG or HOOK to them. Nothing interesting to grab and squeeze. Maybe old people can dig it. I could see using it as background music, but not listening all that often. I guess that's what happens when you don't like jazz!\n\nGreat damn production though, for how old it is! Everything's clear as a window pane!\n\nReader Comments\n\nColin T.\n\nlook: you don't have to \"understand jazz\" in order to get it. it's just music. don't you like music? for all the outrageous celebration mark does about how you really have to sit down and listen to the thinking fellers in order to understand it, one would think that he'd listen to his own advice. clearly, he hasn't.\n\nthis is real music (and i'm referring not only to this one album), effective, energetic, magical........ it does what all good music does: gets all up in you like a motherfucker just to dance dance dance.\n\nahmz5000@hotmail.com (Adam)\n\nif you are looking for a nice melody with some interplay, try listening to boplicity again. if that doesnt do it for you, i dont know what will.\n\njohnnyalpha01@yahoo.co.uk\n\nI've been listening to John Coltrane today. I downloaded 'A Love Supreme', but I figure he doesn't need the money any more. After about two minutes, it hit me what I hate about jazz, aside from the sneery superior types who hold this music in such high esteem. It's just all wrong. The saxophone is way, way too loud. It hits notes that makes the synovial fluid rush to the base of my neck and sit there, twanking on my nerves until I just HAVE to turn it off. And it's not that I can't take extreme or avant-garde music. I've got everything Glenn Branca put out, though I don't have to prove my credentials. It's just all wrong. Any music where you place one instrument much higher than the rest is going to suck. Whenever my band get a soundboard mix through the PA, there's no snare 'cos our drummer hits too hard and my voice is always much too high over the top and it sounds DREADFUL. Jazz - it does have some cookin' interplay, moments where you think - \"wow, a rock band would never do that\" - but it's largely drowned out by my quick dash for the volume control, followed by 'stop'. And the WORST thing is, jazzbos convince you that this is the source, this is the real deal and the largely white indie-rock I like is just fake shit. Well fuck that.\n\nddickso2@uccs.edu\n\nEh, I'm going to have to slightly agree with Mark on this one, but for opposite reasons. These songs, to me, seem pretty much all catchy in a \"jazzbo\" kind of way. Very little soloing, everyone tight as a Cannonball Adderley drum. However, it kind of goes right through one's brain like a Maroon 5 tune. All fun and games, no resonance. Light as a feather, in other words. That \"Darn That Dream\" sub-Sinatra shit at the end only reinforces that impression. I give it a low 7 for sheer listenability. As far as \"Love Supreme\" goes, in reference to the commenter above, though, I must disagree. True, \"Supreme\"'s not nearly as perfect as it's made out to be--it's less than half an hour long, for Chrissakes. I think, however, the lack of any other instrument than the sax gives it focus and keeps it from sounding boring and generic. At least you've only got ONE asshole musically masturbating for twenty-eight minutes, as opposed to six. (Speaking of which, \"Blue Train\"--now THAT'S an overrated Trane album. Whoever said its high sales proved its lasting quality must be strapped to a chair and forced to listen to Guns 'n Roses' debut for the rest of time. THAT'll teach 'em.)\n\nAdd your thoughts? The Complete Birth Of The Cool - Capitol 1998.\n\nThis CD compiles that last album I reviewed, plus a bunch of live versions of the material. Pleasant enough background music, but soloing out the ass. Literally! BRAP!\n\nYou know what? I was very tolerant about 20 seconds ago, but it's time to come clean about something: Everybody who likes jazz is stupid. Yes, if it's a rainy day and you need something smooth and inoffensive playing in the background, it totally does the trick. But if you sit there and devote all your attention to it, the music is just boring. All the songs start off really cool, then devolve into ridiculously unmusical, uninteresting jerking off before the band finally returns to the really good, complex part that you wished hadn't gone away for two and a half minutes so Junior Collins could show off how many disconnected notes he could blow out of that stupid metal toilet pipe thing he calls an instrument.\n\nI suppose jazz really isn't that bad, but it'd be better if they got rid of all those horns and replaced the piano with a bunch of really loud guitars and had a guy screaming and a drummer playing ninety miles an hour and had a big fancy lightshow and a flaming pentagram and a dead person bleeding all over the place.\n\nSpeaking of great music, have you heard that Mark Prindle CD Nature's Smelly Ass? Now that's jazz. Who needs Gerry Mulligan and Lee Konitz when you've got the sensuous sounds of America's Sweetheart glued to the stereo of your sex organ?\n\nAdd your thoughts? Dig - Prestige 1951\n\n2005 - Hi everybody. If you're a longtime visitor to www.markprindle.com/davis.htm#diggin, you may recall that in early 2001, I jokingly posted a page of basically honest but purposely over-the-toppingly insulting reviews of about 20 Miles Davis albums. It quickly became one of the most controversial things I'd ever done, thanks to (a) people who didn't realize that my insults were a joke (the key joke being that I, the reviewer, felt that it was somehow the music's fault that I didn't like it), (b) several passages that were more offensive than witty, and (c) people who care too much about things that don't matter. I accept full responsibility for problems (a) and (b), but the people who got actively ANGRY about the reviews need to reswizzle their priorities a bit, as far as I'm concerned. \"You don't have to like Miles, but you better respect him!!!\" Why? Isn't it enough that he's respected by, oh, EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD WHO LIKES JAZZ? I think he'll live without mine. Or at least, he'll remain dead without it.\n\nBut that's not my point. My point is that I have recently come into possession of 16 more Miles Davis albums. I've already done the \"insult\" schtick, however, so I'm not going to be doing that again. Instead, I'm going to try to, as clearly as possible, explain how each album sounds and why I do or do not like it. Obviously, due to my lack of genre understanding (I took a Jazz Appreciation course in college, but all we really ever did was memorize the beginnings of songs), I'm not going to be able to describe the records in actual Jazz terms (except \"groovy\" and \"heroin addict\"). But I'll tell you what I, as a rock fan, hear when I put each record on. And I'll tell you why I do or don't (mostly don't) like it. And then I'll toss in a few light-hearted insults for old time's nostalgia.\n\nHowever, something interesting has happened to me over the past four years. Something that surprised even I, Mark Prindle, who share a brain and several lungs with the proprietor of this fine site. You ready for it? You might want to stand down.\n\nAs it turns out, I have even less tolerance for jazz now than I did when I wrote the original blasphemous reviews. So what I've decided to do is preface each of the new reviews with the year \"2005.\" That way, you don't have to wonder why I would give, say, a 5 to Steamin' but only a 3 to Workin'. It has nothing to do with relative quality - it has to do with me no longer having any patience at all for jerks who bleat out a bunch of boring horn notes over a tepid 12-bar blues. If you see a new 2, read the description and you might be surprised to see that my opinion reads awfully similar to an old 5. That's just personal growth. Or lack of, one of the two. However, please rest assured that all grades higher than a 6 remain accurate. If I found something to be quite good in my youth, I continue to do so today. And any 2005 grades represent how I feel right now and for the rest of my life since people don't change once they hit 30.\n\nBut I'll tell you one thing -- I'm no longer ashamed of my inability to \"get into\" jazz. I'm old enough now to realize that the problem is not the fact that I don't play any brass instruments, nor that I grew up surrounded by the sounds of rock and roll -- the reason that I dislike this music so much is because of all the soloing. To me, sitting down and listening to some asshole bleat, blat and bloop 4000 notes in no particular order on top of mediocre jazz chord sequences is no more a sign of 'cultured taste' than listening to a Joe Satriani album. Both styles of music are completely self-indulgent, violate nearly every rule of musical composition that I respect, and bore the living loving maid out of me. Does this then exclude ALL jazz from my taste cabinet? Actually, no. I really like interesting instrumental interplay, and I don't even mind a guy soloing as long as the other band members are playing a neat, hypnotic chord sequence. It's just the basic endless improvisation over blah music that makes me scream in violent impatience and sassiness.\n\nLike, say, THIS ALBUM. Featuring Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Jackie McLean and Walter Bishop, Jr., it's a collection of very long hard bop songs, most of which begin life as a 12-second groovy riff and then immediately deteriorate into a series of showing-off sessions. Although there are seven different titles listed on the CD case, there are really only two different songs -- the slow one and the fast one. And the really neat thing is: I don't like either one of them!\n\nAs such, you'd think that I'd give the album a 1 out of 10. I actually considered doing so for several tentative hours, but changed my mind for one reason: this collection of Davis-penned horseshit (and \"It's Only A Paper Moon\") makes GREAT background music. It sounds like air! You don't notice it's there at all; you just know that your apartment suddenly FEELS cool for some reason. It's not until you devote 100% of your attention to the music that you realize it's a bunch of worthless throwaway crap. Let's put it this way -- which would you rather listen to: (a) a hilarious comedian with a finely-honed act who makes you laugh with every single pre-planned joke and nuance? Or (b) Robin Williams? See, as far as I'm concerned, Dig is as intellectually exciting and aurally stimulating as Reality...What A Concept. I know I'm supposed to \"appreciate\" it, but it just makes me want to scream, \"DO SOMETHING INTERESTING OR SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!\"\n\nAlso, Miles Davis smothered poop in his hair to attract stray animals to sodomize, a hobby I disagree with.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Miles Davis And Horns - Prestige 1955\n\n2011 - It has now been a full decade since I posted my original, highly valued Miles Davis review page on the Internet -- and five years since I last put pen to screen to get ink all over my screen. In this time, I have learned a lot, grown a plenty, lost a wife, gained a girlfriend, drank 5,000,000 gallons of vodka, stopped drinking even a sip of vodka and, most importantly, nurtured an honest and unexpectedly deep respect for Miles Davis as a man and musical pioneer.\n\nBut first a little joke: What's the difference between a redneck with a cellphone and a 165-pound bag of shit? One DIALS MAVIS, and the other is M\n\nActually, if I can be serious for a moment -- about ten minutes ago, as I was preparing to review Miles Davis And Horns, I heard a loud and persistent hacking noise coming from my bedroom. Turning to investigate, I saw that Henry The Dog had vomited a chunky, malodorous soup-like substance all over the bed. And I thought to myself, \"My, how my two worlds have collided.\"\n\nAs one of my BFBFFs (Best FaceBook Friends Forever) recently noted in reference to this title, \"Is there a Miles Davis album WITHOUT horns!?\" Presumably the Album Titler was referring to trombonist Bernie Green and tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins (who appear on five of these tracks), as well as trombonist Sonny Truitt and tenor saxophonists Zoot Sims and Al Cohn (who appear on the other four). Either that he was acknowledging that Miles Davis is the Devil.\n\nThe next time the kids ask you to take them on a vacation, put this record on the Turn-Go-Round and say, \"Pack your bags! We're taking a trip to Bland Solo City!\" Say! That reminds me of a great joke:\n\nWhat's the difference between Star Wars and this album?\n\nStar Wars had HAN SOLO and this album, no hang on you'll love this\n\nFive of these songs of bitches were recorded on January 17th, 1951. These are lo-fi and far too devoted to soloing to hold my interest much past the opening riffs. See, this is what bores the pantsuit off of me about Cool Jazz and Bop: I understand that it must've been terribly exciting for these musicians to remove the shackles of pro-written melody and just go wild with their note-happy finger talents, but my musical brain finds nothing of interest in a bunch of random notes blurting all over the place for minutes at a stretch. Sure, I'm impressed that these guys can solo over multiple chord changes without ever hitting a wrong note, but how many goddamned variations on this schtick am I expected to sit through without longing for a motherfucking MELODY to happen along? Some have told me, \"When they solo, it's like they're telling a story,\" but how good a story is it going to be if they only have 12 notes to work with? Am I likewise supposed to be spellbound by a story with only twelve different words!? Here, let's see:\n\nA man walked outside, saw a dog, saw another man and laughed heartily at the sun. Another man walked a dog and laughed. Heartily, the dog saw the sun and walked at another man. The sun laughed heartily. Another man walked outside and laughed at the saw. The saw walked at the sun. Heartily, the saw saw another sun outside the dog. A man and another man laughed outside at the sun dog. The sun heartily laughed at a man and saw another dog. A saw outside walked a man.\n\nThere! Did you enjoy my solo?\n\nThe other four songs of bitches were recorded on February 19th, 1953 under much stronger recording conditions. These tracks, all credited to Al Cohn, are actually pretty groovy! Between the Sneaky Pete horns of \"Tasty Pudding,\" the festive dance mood of \"Willie the Wailer,\" and the speedy, sprightly \"Floppy,\" you'd have the makings of a pretty good record if you'd cram all the solos up your ass.\n\nLow points include two takes of Rodgers & Hart's schmaltzy \"The Blue Room,\" which sounds identical to Cream's \"White Room\" but with all the notes replaced by ones that suck.\n\nI know what you're thinking. You're thinking, \"Hay Jurk, you obviously don't like this kind of music: why did you bother returning to the till for a third time!?\" The answer is simple: (a) I discovered that my page lacked reviews of only 21 Miles Davis studio albums, and (b) I would never, ever illegally download music because it's illegal. So thank God I woke up one day and all 21 of those albums had miraculously appeared on my hard drive.\n\nReader Comments\n\nMark\n\nDear Mr. Prindle:\n\nI appreciate your irreverant and often accurate critiques of the excesses of jazz. I do love jazz when it's performed with balanced egos and a balanced mix. I'm glad to read to that you gave praise to the Laswell reconstructions of Miles, as I think he managed to improve vastly upon the original versions.\n\nHowever, I must question this point: \"Am I likewise supposed to be spellbound by a story with only twelve different words!?\"\n\nAs you know, most Western music - including rock - based on the 12 tones of the diatonic scale. So why wouldn't this same criticism be equally damning of all this music, not only jazz?\n\nOne could offer other equally valid metaphors, also. Why not consider the 12 tones as letters of an alphabet, from which one can generate an infinity of words and sentences? Extend this to the other octaves, and there are at least 88 such letters on a piano keyboard. Include note length, accent, dynamics, pitch bending, etc., and the language becomes even more complex and varied.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Blue Haze - Prestige 1954\n\n2011 - I believe it was top-selling record producer Steve Albini who said, \"Jazz serves a cultural function in the music scene. It is a signifier for musical 'adulthood'. To embrace jazz is to don a kind of graduation cap, signifying a broadening of tastes outside 'mere' rock music. This ostentatious display of 'sophistication' is an insult, and I find the graduation cappers transparent and tedious. Certainly there must be interesting music one could call 'jazz'. There must be. I've never heard it, but I grant that it is out there somewhere. Jazz has a non-musical parallel: Christiania, the 'free' zone in Copenhagen. In Christiania, like in jazz, there is no law. People are left to their own inventions to create and act as they see fit. In Jazz, the musicians are allowed to improvise over and beside structural elements that may themselves be extemporaneous. Sounds good, doesn't it? Freedom  sounds good. The reality is much bleaker. Christiania is a squalid, trashy string of alleys with rag-and-bone men selling drugs, tie-dye and wretched food. Granted Total Freedom, and this is what they've chosen to do with it, sell hash and lentil soup? Jazz is similar. The results are so far beneath the conception that there is no English word for the disappointment one feels when forced to confront it. Granted Total Freedom, you've chosen to play II V I and blow a goddamn trill on the saxophone? Only by willfully ignoring its failings can one pretend to appreciate it as an idiom and don the cap.\"\n\nThen again, I believe it was former Mark Prindle colleague Matt Van Ryn who said, \"I know you hate improvisation, so of course you're going to hate most jazz. That's like saying I hate impressionist painting because it's spontaneous - but you would likewise probably say because it's bland and bourgeouis. But these idioms have only become that way thru time. Both were just as radical as your beloved punk rockers in their time and historical context. I think that's what you need to look at more, to come to find your own level of jazz appreciation - the history and context.\"\n\nOn the other hand, I believe it was comedian funnyperson Paul F. Tompkins who said, \"Jazz music is all about making the common man feel dumb. It's just a bunch of dudes playing solos at the same time. It's like a genre of music that's defying you to like it. 'Badada Boodly-bip-doo-dip! Bee-dee-bwap bee-dee-bwap! Boodoo doodoo baydaywop.' It's like the record is saying, 'What's the matter, man? Don't you like our smart people's music!?\"\n\nBut building on the original point, I believe it was Facebook Friend Putzy Schwanger who said, \"The appeal of jazz has to do with harmonic sophistication (chords with more notes in them), rhythmic syncopation (Hey, the drummer stressed THIS beat when I thought he was going to stress that OTHER one!), the musicians ability to swing (not straight-eighth feel which is 99.9% of rock) as well as to draw spontaneously from a rich musical language to create well-structured improvisations. If these things do not interest you, youre better off sticking to rock.\"\n\nUnfortunately, I believe it was record reviewer Mark Prindle who said, \"THIS ALBUM FUCKING SUCKS!!!!\"\n\nIn fact, let's look at how these songs stack up to some similarly-titled hits of the day:\n\n\"I Remember You\" by The Ramones - Soft and slow, but sweet!\n\n\"I'll Remember April\" by Miles Davis - An old Judy Garland song. In fact, I believe it was Facebook friend Robert Harland who said, \"I think the reason you dislike old jazz is that a lot of it is based around old Broadway and Tin Pan Alley songs, which give a built-in structure to the wanky improvisations. I forced myself to get used to the improv, but imagine how horrible life would be if you found jazz a breeze to get into because you had a bunch of Judy Garland songs running around your head?\"\n\n\"Free Four\" by Pink Floyd - Roger Waters lays on the depression as a jaunty riff taps your toe in defiance\n\n\"Four\" by Miles Davis - Friendly laidback harmless predictable boring wallpaper\n\n\"Hooch\" by The Melvins - Can't remember how it goes right now, but it's probably heavy, mean and awesome\n\n\"Smooch\" by Miles Davis - Can't remember how it goes right now, but it probably doesn't have a melody or anything good about it at all\n\n\"Purple Haze\" by Jimi Hendrix - A blistering acid rock classic\n\n\"Blue Haze\" by Miles Davis - SO FUCKING BORING! GOD!!! JUST BRAP BRAP BRAP SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!\n\n\"When Friends Fall Out\" by The Guess Who - Great Burton Cummings singalong!\n\n\"When Lights Are Low\" - Most of the melody is one single note tooted over and over again. Fuck you, Benny Carter! You were a terrible president!\n\n\"I Can See For Miles\" by The Who - Possibly the greatest rock recording of all time.\n\n\"Miles Ahead\" by Miles Davis - Miles sticks his dick in a trumpet and wiggles it around so it goes \"eee eee\" against the sides.\n\nI hate this album more than most people hate their own newborn babies. It's just a bunch of boring old toodly-doo bullshit, like you'd hear in a department store. Boring chord sequences, boring solos -- boring album!\n\nSeriously, when the only memorable melody on your album is a cover of \"Old Devil Moon,\" it's time to sell your horn on ebay and enroll in business school. Luckily, Miles Davis did just that, and his recording career came to a sudden, permanent halt in 1954.\n\nReader Comments\n\nDavid Dickson\n\nSo. You decided to finish off this guy with a flourish. And did so by reviewing like a dozen albums that even I'VE never heard of and three fairly well-known ones that bore me to death. You know what your problem is? You like Miles too much, THAT'S what your problem is.\n\nHonestly, though, I think it's time to say something that needs to be said and no one seems to be saying. (And NOT \"jazz is for elitist pussies\"--I am not Mr. Generic Guy today.) This is something that gets my goat, burns my canoli, GRINDS MY GEARS, and prevents (non-Prindle) rock fans from having more than a \"duh-level\" knowledge of any music that features soloing horns.\n\nMiles Davis gets held up as Mr. Quintessential Jazz Man way too goddamn often. Sure, he's famous--who ISN'T famous these days? But dammit, he's just NOT THAT GREAT. He's just an intermittently pleasant, tastefully cool, occasionally-innovative-on-a-band-level, mostly boring man with like two great albums in his catalog. Neither of which are Kind of Blue, Bitches' Brew, or Birth of the Cool. There, I said it. I appreciate the existence of those albums, and that's as far as I throw them. And him. He's JUST A PLEASANTLY MEDIOCRE MAN who broke ground on a few things and whose band played the best instrumental covers around back in the mid-Fifties. Cripes, I even think his solos stink. And I'm Mr. Pretentiousness-Rules Guy!\n\nSpeaking of pretentiousness, though. That quote above from Steve Albini. . . look, God knows, we all enjoyed his production work on In Utero, and I'm sure he's fun enough to have an ascerbic, nasty, extra-bitter beer with. But that said, considering the career that quote comes from, that is about the biggest garbage I've read yet this week. Replace every reference to \"jazz\" and \"saxophones\" in it with \"my own boring shit music\", (or better yet, \"Fugazi both before and after their first album\") and you have my own attitude towards Steve Albini and the whole scene he came from summed up in a nutshell. Steve hates improvised horns and considers them nothing more than a badge for tools trying to make themselves part of an intellectual elite. He apparently has no sense of irony. I've been told over and over again (sometimes even by commenters on this site!) that only appreciation of three \"creative\" simple notes played at top screeching volume on bass and/or garagey guitar from the late Eighties topped off by someone tone-deafly talking/shouting/screeching impressionist nonsense at you is the only and true gateway to \"musical sophistication\". In that case, musical sophistication can jump off a cliff. Sure, rock and roll distilled according to scraggly back-alley rules has its virtues, but it, like jazz, is just one genre among many, many others. It is not the end-all and be-all of musical existence. Those who say otherwise are cracked, selling something, or Robert Christgau.\n\nAnd just to show you I'm not a completely narrow-minded anti-noise pencil-necked person, I do quite enjoy D.O.A.'s debut, Something Better Change. It has good songs on it. The rest of simplistic tone-deaf noise rock in general (at least, all the albums I've listened to in order to, as they say, \"expand my corporate boundaries\") can go eat a dick. (With a duck.)\n\nNow, speaking of ducks, and instruments that sound like them. I kind of disagree with the critics when they wax all orgasmic about \"Round About Midnight\". Not sure what they see in that song, other than its coolness and jazzy stuff. Thelonious Monk has a pretty dark-sounding original version of the song from the late-Forties--it's on his \"Genius of Modern Music\" thing, and it's better than the one on Miles Davis' album of the same name. Bags Groove the album--well, I agree it's not exactly a Mt. Rushmore of horn wanking, but eh, Mark, a ONE. . . eh. . . Even I would never do that to the Pixies. (Because they're just so goldarn CUTE.)\n\nAnd I told you Miles Smiles was mediocre. Still, I give it a 6, not a 3. (Or a negative kazillion.)\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I must show off my graduation cap and make Steve Albini blithering mad. (Cause when he's mad, he's just so CUTE)\n\nJAZZ ALBUMS WORTH A GODDAMN:\n\nSteamin' (Miles Davis, 1956)--Marvelous! Adult! Sophisticated!! All covers!!! (Miles can't write that many good songs, see.)\n\nWorkin' (Miles Davis, 1956)--Splendid!! Magnificent!! Reminiscent of Christiania!!! (Except with good songs, some of which are original. And it was recorded on the SAME SINGLE DAY as Steamin', which, regardless of one's musical biases/demonic hatreds, is some kind of awesome.)\n\nMingus Ah Um (Charles Mingus, 1959)--Beauteous!! How droll!! Broadens my tastes outside \"mere rock music\"!!! (More to the point, it's probably the \"catchiest\" traditional small-group jazz album in existence--like, every song has an actual melody, as opposed to just \"groovy atmosphere\".)\n\nOut There (Eric Dolphy, 1960)--Lentil soupy!! Trills on the saxophone!!! Urge Overkill isn't the worst stain on humanity!!! (That was just to piss him off; I actually don't like Urge Overkill that much.)\n\nFree Jazz (ORNETTE COLEMAN, 1960)--(*ORGASMS, IN AN INTELLECTUAL FASHION*)!!! (Actually, I'm not sure if Mark would like this or not. It's kind of like \"Bitches Brew\", the song, except without bluesy guitar and squawky keyboards, and ten minutes longer. Normally, I wouldn't like it that much, but it gets all dramatic and weirdo and Eastern-like in the second half. Also, it has a transparent and tedious graduation capper, with Total Freedom, and shit.)\n\nIn addition, Smashing Pumpkins. Liz Phair.\n\n(*giggles*)\n\nAdd your thoughts? Walkin' - Prestige 1954\n\n2011 - On two April dates in 1954, Miley Cyrus slithered his fat ass into Rudy Van Gelder Studio Studio in Hackensack, New Jersey to record an album of hard bop with six other musicians (five in one session, four in the other) who would be named \"Miles Davis All Stars\" on the album cover, for some reason. These lucky men included: tenor (soprano?) saxophonist Eli \"Lucky\" Thompson, who not so luckily developed Alzheimers Disease and died in 2005; trombonist James Louis \"J.J.\" Johnson (the second \"J\" stands for \"Louis\"), who developed prostate cancer before committing suicide in February 2001; bassist Percy Heath, who developed bone cancer and died in 2005; alto saxophonist Dave Schildkraut, who died of obscurity in 1998; drummer Kenny Clarke, who died of Paris in 1985; and pianist Horace Silver, who somehow evaded the \"Miles Davis All Stars Curse\" and lives to this very day.\n\nThe album begins with the six-piece line-up performing a thirteen-and-a-half-minute version of jazz composer Richard Carpenter's \"Walkin'\" that's highlighted by a cool Pink Panther-style opening followed by twelve minutes of the musicians shoving horns up each others' asses as a 12-bar blues bores the world to death in the background. Next to bat is Dizzy Gillespie's \"Blue 'n' Boogie,\" a fast and jubilant 12-bar excretion that showcases some delightfully spirited soloing from Mr. Thompson. Track number three brings us to the five-player session and a romantic (yet peppy!) Miles Davis original called \"Solar\". Though it features some lovely moments, it's unfortunately still just a bunch of fucken solos -- which nonetheless elevates it above the next track, pianist Gene De Paul's boring ballad \"You Don't Know What Love Is.\" Yeah, Gene? Well, you don't know what A DECENT SONG is. Prick. GO DIE! (In 1988)\n\nBut none of the above could possibly prepare the listener for the speedy, catchy trumpet riff that propels final track \"Love Me Or Leave Me\" (a Walter Donaldson composition from the 1920's play Whoopee!)! Unfortunately, ALL of the above could prepare the listener for the fact that 75% of the song is tuneless 'brapp-dee-dapp-dee-do.'\n\nGod I love that cartoon. \"Brapp-dee-dapp-dee-do! Where are you? We've got some (and so forth).\"\n\nOh, but don't get me STARTED on SCRAPP-dee-dapp-dee-do!\n\nThe bottom line is clear, as is the conclusion, in terms of the final word: Jazz would be bonus if it weren't for all the solos.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Bags' Groove - Prestige 1957\n\n2011 - My girlfriend likes the vibraphone solo in the title track. You've now read every positive comment I have to make about this album.\n\nTaking its title from the fact that only old \"bags\" could possibly \"groove\" to its safe, staid pleasantries, this album features seven tracks recorded on June 29 and December 24, 1954. World-famous tenor saxophonist and spoken word artist Henry \"Sonny\" Rollins appears on five of the tracks, three of which he wrote himself! And they suck!\n\nAnd by \"they suck,\" I of course mean \"they're jazz\"!\n\nYou know, as a fan of AC/DC, The Ramones and Motorhead, I'm no stranger to accusations of my favorite artists' albums \"all sounding the same.\" I've no argument with this assessment; hell, I can't even tell one Motorhead album from another! But even though these blueprint-following rock artists are content to mine one stylistic shaft for decades on end, they at least make an effort to write new riffs. All of these Miles Davis albums, on the other hand, sound EXACTLY THE SAME. Every song begins with roughly 30 seconds of an actual melody, and then the solos begin. And the solos are ALWAYS boring as fucking living fucking hell. I'm not saying that every jazz solo in the world is boring (for just one example, John Coltrane kicks some ass in his \"My Favorite Things\" solo), but on this particular stretch of Miles Davis records (the cool/bop years), sweet Jesus America are they interchangeable. Perhaps because he was recording like 15 albums a year at this point?\n\nHere is a precise, second-by-second rundown of the LP's seven tracks:\n\n1. \"Bags' Groove (Take 1)\" - My girlfriend likes the vibraphone solo; she thinks it sounds like he's having a lot of fun. Well, of course he is. He's jurkin' off!\n\n2. \"Bags' Groove (Take 2)\" - Look out, kids! This IS your father's jazz!\n\n3. \"Airegin\" - The title is \"Nigeria\" spelled backwards! The song is \"Diarrhea\" played forwards!\n\n4. \"Oleo\" - Like an Oreo, but with dogshit in the middle.\n\n5. \"But Not For Me (Take 2)\" - A George Gershwin composition from the musical Girl Crazy. This is ironic, in that the entire reason Miles Davis took up the trumpet in the first place was to teach himself proper fellatio technique.\n\n6. \"Doxy\" - I may be thinking of a different song, but I'm pretty sure this is the one with the solo.\n\n7. \"But Not For Me (Take 1)\" - I like how one of the notes is repeated multiple times during each refrain, as if it's planning to break out into a pre-written melody at any moment. This never happens though.\n\nIn conclusion, if you at some point in your life suddenly become a Miles Davis fan, call 911 immediately because you have almost definitely suffered severe brain damage.\n\nReader Comments\n\nMatt\n\nFirst of all I'd like to offer my deepest condolences about Henry the Dog. Based on the Weekly Waggly Wphotos, it seems like he lived a very full life. I wouldn't say something that trite if my ancient dog hadn't died about a year ago, and I did take consolation in knowing he'd... lived a very full life.\n\nI'm glad to see this page expanding, and your mention of John Coltrane on \"My Favorite Things\" made me wonder, have many people tried to \"explain\" jazz to you? One of the things for following the solos is that it's good to keep the song's melody in mind during them. The harmonies are more obvious when you've already got a rough idea about them just from knowing the tune. That might be one reason why you appreciate uber-familiar \"My Favorite Things\" more than bop songs, which almost always have wonky difficult melodies. I'm not saying this like to scold you, I bet if I listened to all of Miles Davis's records, my satisfaction would be similar to what you've gotten. I've just been trying to acquire a taste for jazz recently and that's one of the more useful concepts I've found.\n\nAdd your thoughts?

The Musings Of Miles - Prestige 1955\n\n2011 - So I was fucking your wife the other day when she suddenly turned to me and said, \"My husband, whom I'm cuckolding right now, thinks that you're silly for not liking Miles Davis. Would you care to respond to these allegations?\"\n\nThinking deeply as I wiped my goo-coated tallywhacker on your finest tie, I replied, \"I just don't get any joy out of listening to solos. My mind craves either repetition or novelty, and -- although I acknowledge that Miles may have been an innovator in his day -- all I hear in his cool and bop work is a bunch of interchangeable random notes. Key-appropriate notes, yes, but not arranged into any pattern that sets off the Enjoyment Ball in my music-loving hemisphere. And believe me, I've tried to enjoy them! Many, many times.\"\n\n\"You don't even like The Musings of Miles?\" she queried, stifling a laugh about how small your penis is.\n\n\"That one actually starts off okay,\" I responded, urinating in your sock drawer. \"I enjoy the cool chord sequence of the speedy yet romantic 'Will You Still Be Mine?,' the gentle calming mood of 'I See Your Face Before Mine' and the cute musical joke of 'I Didn't' (the opening riff is a slight variation on Thelonius Monk's 'Well, You Needn't' -- GET IT!?). But there's just no avoiding the fact that jazz is based heavily on improvisation, so even these tracks are mostly given over to boring notes bleating like a dying musical pig.\"\n\n\"But what about 'A Night in Tunisia'?\" your wife wondered aloud while telling your children that you're not their real father and are, in fact, impotent. \"Don't you love the way Philly Joe Jones has bells nailed to his drumsticks on that one?\"\n\n\"You know what? Shut up and suck on this,\" I responded impatiently, handing her a popsicle that you'd saved especially for yourself but will now not have the opportunity to enjoy. \"'A Night in Tunisia' features one of the eeriest intros and oddest chord sequences I've ever heard in a jazz song, but just when I started thinking, 'Wow! A jazz song that doesn't suck!,' it immediately turned into standard jazz bullshit.\"\n\n\"Maybe the problem is that it's just Miles and a three-piece band. He doesn't have a trombonist, saxophonist or vibraphonist to interact with,\" your wife suggested, busily replacing your face in all the family photos with a shot of my pud.\n\n\"Even if he had other players to interact with, he wouldn't. He just likes to go brappity brappity brappity like an egotistical shitbird,\" I shouted, waving my fist angrily in the air as your children called me 'Dad' and referred to you as 'that impotent asshole.'\n\n\"I see your point,\" your wife concluded, relieving her bowels on your college diploma. \"And 'Green Haze' isn't anywhere near as good as Jimi Hendrix's 'Purple Haze'!\"\n\n\"I know!\" I agreed excitedly, selling your wife's wedding ring to a pawn shop and spending the proceeds on a new bed frame because we'd destroyed the other one with our fervent banging, the likes of which she had never experienced. \"I said the same thing about 'Blue Haze' earlier on this page!\"\n\nThen we set your car on fire and told your boss you fuck little kids.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Blue Moods - Debut 1955\n\n2011 - It's not often you run across a perfectly average (rather than completely putrid) Miles Davis album, so I think it might be worthwhile to address those aspects that render Blue Moods so impressively mediocre (rather than vomit-inducingly stench-riddled).\n\n1. No Piano - How does this help? It gives the record an idiosyncratic \"hey, there's no piano!\" feel.\n\n2. Trombone/Trumpet Interplay - The first two of these four songs mix and mesh the two brass instruments into both tangled double-leads and an intriguing lead-trumpet/rhythm-trombone arrangment. You'll be all like, \"What is this, the Thinking Fellers? But with horns?\"\n\n3. Vibrato Vibes - Vibraphonist Teddy Charles runs his instrument through a Leslie speaker or oscillating fan or some confounded thing to give it a really eerie vibrating tone.\n\n4. The Song \"Nature Boy\" - Neither a Primus cover nor a Nick Cave cover but in fact an all-original Eden Ahbez cover, \"Nature Boy\" combines a melodic trumpet line with lamentful trombone toots, creepy vibraphone chords and cool Charles Mingus bass for a down-in-the-dumps pre-Tom Waits mood of pure midnight blue.\n\nUnfortunately, the second half shanghais every progressive element of the first, telling it \"23-Skiddoo!\" to make way for 13 minutes of easy listening Vegasy schmaltz.\n\nIf you're looking for a good jazz album, try Alice Coltrane's Journey In Satchidananda. If you're looking for a bad jazz album, try 95% of Miles Davis's discography.\n\nNow here's a little joke for all you Jazzheads out there:\n\nWhat do you get when you cross Miles Davis with an army vehicle?\n\nA septic tank!\n\nThat sucked. I'm about to fall asleep. Here's a poem:\n\nWhose woods these are I think I know.\n\nHis house is in the village though;\n\nHe will not see me stopping here\n\nTo watch his woods fill up with snow.\n\nMy little horse must think it queer\n\nTo stop without a farmhouse near\n\nBetween the woods and frozen lake\n\nThe darkest evening of the year.\n\nHe gives his harness bells a shake\n\nTo ask if there is some mistake.\n\nThe only other sound's the sweep\n\nOf easy wind and downy flake.\n\nThe woods are lovely, dark and deep.\n\nBut I have promises to keep,\n\nAnd miles davis sucks\n\nAdd your thoughts? Quintet/Sextet (with Milt Jackson) - Prestige 1955\n\n2011 - Hi, I'm Milt \"Bags\" Jackson. You know, when my friend Smiley Davidson asked me to record an album with him, I thought, \"Say, that'd be a-ok. After all, he loves music and so do I.\" But then what happened!? What happened!? Well, I'll tell you what happened.\n\nFirst of all, I show up at the studio and he's not wearing any pants. Now that's fine; it was a hot August day and you know how humid Hackensack can be. But you wouldn't believe the next thing he says to me. He turns to me and says, \"Bags?\" he says. \"Bags, I left my trumpet at the Blimpie on Main Street.\" And I'm like, \"Come on, man. You knew we were recording today! What were you doing at Blimpie?\"\n\nAnd he says to me he says, and I couldn't believe this, he says to me, \"Well, since the album we're going to record isn't going to have any melodies on it AT ALL, I figured I'd just bounce a sandwich up and down on the little trumpet buttons -- you know, as a goof. Nobody will care. Jazz fans are infantile; they'll rave about it no matter how shitty and boring it is.\"\n\nAnd that was the day I joined Limp Bizkit.\n\n- Excerpt from Bags O' Shit: The Milt \"Bags\" Jackson Story by Milt \"Bags\" Jackson\n\n--------------------------\n\nHey fucker, this is John Lenwood \"Jackie\" McLean. When Smiley Davidson and Jesse \"Reggie\" Jackson called me up and said, \"Come on down here to Rudy Van Gelder Studio and record an album with us,\" I was hyped, psyched and double-diked. So I grabbed two of my most tuneful and hooky compositions, hopped on my Segway, and was there in a jiffy flash. Unfortunately, something went terribly, terribly wrong.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that Smiley wasn't wearing any pants. Now I ain't no prude, but it can get right chilly inside those air conditioned studios and I'll be honest with you, I didn't want some guy catching a cold and sneezing all over my alto saxophone. Nevertheless, I handed out the sheet music for \"Dr. Jackle\" and \"Minor March\" and we started tuning up.\n\n17 minutes later, Smiley shouted, \"Okay, cut!\" Apparently we'd just recorded the mother fucking songs! Now please excuse me if I don't recall writing \"Dr. Jackle\" as a 12-bar cocktail blues song or doing away with melody entirely when penning \"Mirror March,\" but hey it wasn't MY name on the album cover so who cares what I have to say about ANYTHING!?\n\nPricks.\n\n- Excerpt from Jackie'n' Off: A John Lenwood \"Jackie\" McLean Autobiography by John Lenwood \"Jackie\" McLean\n\n---------------------------------\n\nYou may know me. Some do. Others don't. But some do. My name is best known as Raphael Homer \"Ray\" Bryant. I play the piano for jazz records all over society. One day in August 5th at about 19:55 PM, Smiley Davidson, Jesse \"Reggie\" Jackson and Jake Elwood \"Don\" McLean called me up after midnight, told me I'm wrong, told me I'm right and asked if I wanted to bring my piano down to the studio and play some tasty licks on a hot new jazz platter they were preparing. \"A jazz platter?\" I responded. \"Why would I want to eat a plate full of ejaculate?\" But, as fate turned out to be, they were using slang terminology. As such, I folded up my piano, placed it into a knapsack and walked on down to Hackensack from my home in Juneau, Alaska.\n\nThe first thing I thought when I got there was, \"Hey, I have a new song called 'Changes' that I think you guys will really like.\" Then, just for shits and grins, I played them the first verse of \"Changes\" by Black Sabbath and then that killer intro to \"Changes\" by Yes. At this, Smiley turned to me and said, \"Remember when you were lugging your piano in here and we were all taking naps while holding our instruments? I'm going to call THAT 'Changes' and attribute it to you on the album. Prick.\"\n\nPrick.\n\n- Excerpt from 'Paul Revere'? No!

Workin' - Prestige 1956.\n\nFirst of all, let me point out that rock and roll had existed for a good several months when The Miles Davis Quintet recorded this album so it would have been really nice had he acknowledged its importance and invited Eddie Van Halen to sit in with the band, but perhaps some people are just too old and set in their ways to accept change. Miles Davis was clearly one of these people.\n\nThis little band featured a young John Coltrane on something called a \"tenor saxophone,\" which I'm pretty sure is just a made-up name for him using both hands to exacerbate his womanrod (get his joke? \"tenner sexophone\"? funny guy, that John Coltrane. A regular Jackie Mason of Chicken Soup fame). There are also three other musicians portraying a pianist, bassist and drummer. The CD starts off excellent, with a lovely little straightforward Rodgers-Hart tune called \"It Never Entered My Mind.\" After that, it turns into \"jazz\" though, with all the useless solos and boring key changes that that would suggest. The piano sounds great on the whole thing and I just love it when them jazz dudes play really fast note runs at the same time to show that they actually are pre-written and not just made up on the spot like a Frank Zappa guitar solo - but too much of the CD is just more of what I don't like about jazz. Individual showing off on the part of every performer. If I wanted showing off, I'd watch Greg Louganis die of AIDS, thanks!\n\nThat wasn't the most sensitive thing I've ever written.\n\nReader Comments\n\nddickso2@uccs.edu\n\nA HA! I think I've just figured out the reason behind my impression of Dirty Rotten LP. I'd just finished listening to Frank Sinatra's Songs for Swingin' Lovers!! (1955). And you know what THAT man said about rock and roll at the year in question. . .\n\n\"THAT isn't music!! It's just. . . just. . . NOISE!!!\"\n\nDarn that fellow AND his Oleo--may they burn in Havana!\n\nNow. About Workin. Jazz, in the right proportions, gives one what doctors refer to as \"Neat-o Syndrome\". Being a big fan of \"neat-o\" and that song from West Side Story that goes \"cool.\", I'd say this album is rightly proportioned. It's not overloaded with air (Kind of Blue), nor overloaded with lack of air (Blue Train), nor not loaded with much of anything at all (A Love Supreme--twenty-eight minutes short!!). It's just perfectly balanced. I can't say these songs are the most well-written ever (I mean, it's JAZZ. They make it up on the spot for Chrissakes.) But they give you a generalized \"cool, neat-o\", or \"cooeato\" feeling, like your sweater just walked off your body, snapped its sleeves to the beat, and said, \"Let's groove.\" So I'd say if I could pick any instrumental album to eat a romantic wild quail dinner to, it would be this one as of now. Can you do that to hardcore punk?? Can you, I ask??\n\nWell, of course you can do it to \"Damaged I.\" It's jazz too--but dammit, my point stands.\n\nedoslan@gmail.com\n\nactually, Mr. Rock Expert, rock n roll had existed for several *years* in 1956 - Bill Haley and the Comets scored the first rock hit with 'Crazy Man, Crazy' in 1953... HOWEVER it must be stated that I read somewhere from someone who said that, despite what the movies and documentaries tell you, rock didn't just all of a sudden turn the world upside down. In 1955 or whatever songs like 'Rock Around the Clock' were just considered catchy singles on the hit parade, no different than other big hits of the time.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Steamin' - Prestige 1956.\n\nStill playin' COOL, dude with more tunes recorded on the same day that they \"cut\" Workin' (more like JERKIN', if you ask me....). Not sure why this one is called Steamin' instead of Relaxin' - it's an awfully relaxed record! It also features one of my all-time favorite jazz riffs (yes, I do like a few of them!) - Thelonius Monk's \"Well You Needn't.\" Elsewhere you'll find a rollicking, wildass rendition of \"Salt Peanuts\" that I honestly didn't recognize as \"Salt Peanuts\" at all, plus a gorgeous Rodgers-Hammerstein tune. However - and here's a shocker that may make you fall off your chair and bang your ass against my face as I peer up your trouser leg - the rest of the disc is marred by lots of haphazard hootin' and some other slow stuff that just doesn't cut the melodic mustard of my musical marmalade man.\n\nSpeaking of which, I just got an email from the singer of the Crucifucks!!! Doesn't that kick ass, all you Miles Davis fans???\n\nReader Comments\n\nddickso2@uccs.edu\n\nWhat the fuck dudes. No one's commented on these four albums and Kind of Blue gets like a billion responses? Pfft. Typical.\n\nNow, I won't pretend to be objective here--like Prindle, I'm not the biggest jazzbo wankity wank-wank fan in the world. Kind of Blue, despite its blueness and kindness, slightly bores me (despite me sending a semi-fanboyish comment on it a while back--must've sent that one when I gave a flaming fuck what intellectualoids liked). I don't like saxophone solos as a general rule, I actively DESPISE jazz fusion, and Giant Steps makes me want to go punch something. Not even A Love Supreme, in all its bombastic wanky glory, impresses me beyond the \"my, but this fellow sure can play plenty notes really really fast\" level.\n\nBut good GOD. These '56 Quintet records are just golden, golden, GOLDEN, I tell you! Why didn't you tell me about them sooner, jazz fans? No \"experimentation\" or \"groundbreaking\" here, just five classy fellows playing jazz boppity songs they happen to like. With HOOKS! Bonus! And everyone gets a solo, not just the sax guy! Yup, this sure beats modal scales and electric piano skronk any week of the month.\n\nNow, for all you indie rock fans that know of no other Miles Davis records other than Kind of Blue and Bitches Brew, rest assured these albums are not all that experimental, historical, or groundbreaking. However, the music rules regardless--it's like your own shoes want to walk off your body, tap to the jazzbo beat, and say something classy and Fifties-like, like \"Mack,\" \"Oleo,\" or \"what a handsome, gay day it is today, Bertram, wouldn't you say good fellow? *coughs on cigar, uses lead-based paint*\"\n\nIt helps that most of the songs are covers--that way we're guaranteed a hook on most of the songs. Workin's the album with all the classic songs, Cookin's the one with the long marijuana jams, and Relaxin's the one with the most complicated playing (what with that \"Oleo\" and what-not), but I think we can all agree that Steamin's the one that holds together best as an album. See? The Beatles weren't the first to record cohesive LPs! (Neither was Miles, for that matter, but who cares about stupid facts anyway gadnavvit.)\n\nAnyway, if you're looking to get into jazz and you don't care about no stinkin' experimental crap dude, pick up these four albums--Workin' and Steamin' especially. They make you classy just by sitting on the shelf/in your CD wallet/in your hard drive.\n\nIncidentally, I was listening to Shania Twain's \"Whatever You Do!! Don't!!!\" when writing this. Jazzy modal fusiony gal, that Shania Twain.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Relaxin' - Prestige 1956\n\nI guess I just have to come to terms with the fact that jazz is a different type of music than rock. Inferior, yes, but no less different. Every song is always going to feature sixty-lillion solos and many of the melodies will seem non-melodic to me simply because they're based on \"jazz scales\" or some related non-rock silliness. This is yet another album recorded in two \"MARATHON\" sessions (where the whole band sat around eating Marathon candy bars) back in '56 when The Fonz was going \"Aaaaaaay!\". But it seems more consistent than the last two somehow. More catchy melodies and pretty passages. Maybe not, I don't know. Quite frankly, it's pretty hard to give an adequate summation of a bunch of albums I've only heard 2 or 3 times in my life. Especially a musical form as complex as jazz, where it could take a dozen listens for one to become familiar with all the changes, nooks and crannies of each song.\n\nStupid old Miles Davis, making music whose qualities aren't readily apparent to me within 10 minutes of putting the CD in.\n\nReader Comments\n\nddickso2@uccs.edu\n\nEh, must disagree with Prindle on this one being better than the previous two. I think it's rather the weakest of the four. Probably because there's no wickedass awesome speedy skronk like \"Salt Peanuts\" and \"Half Nelson\" or beauteous piano etherealness like \"Something I Dreamed Last Night\" or the last chord of \"A Day in the Life\" or what-not. It's just, y'know. . . jazzy. Unpretentious n' cool. And damn that \"Oleo\" sure is complicated. And there's no really long-ass jammy songs on here, so if you like your jazzbo music short, this might be your bag.\n\nStill, Workin'. And Steamin', man. Great hooks AND great jamming. And all fitting together on the album like a glove. How did they record BOTH those albums on the same day? They were magic people, that's how.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Cookin' - Prestige 1956\n\n2005 - I am one exhaustible fellow. I don't know if it's the humidity, the lack of sleep or what, but something's got me feeling like an awfully tired attractive man. Actually, maybe it's all the tiny annoyances that have been infecting my life like a pus milkshake over the past couple of weeks. First there was a rigmarole with the dumbass asshole management company that overcharges us for maintenance every month. What happened specifically is that the pricks forgot to mail us a maintenance notice for May, then in early June sent us a notice saying that we'd logged a $25 late fee for not paying. So I called the asshole idiot bitch whore cunt slag lesbian woman who sent the letter, left her a very detailed voicemail and asked her to call me back so we could discuss the late fee and what-have-you. So she didn't call back. For a WEEK. So instead I decided on my own to not pay the $25 late fee, and sent in a check for two months' maintenance at the price quoted in her letter, along with a note explaining why I opted to forfeit the late fee. So the very next day, I got my official June maintenance notice -- and the amount was $200 MORE than her fucking dumbass letter had said it was!!! So I had to write (waste) yet another check for the balance, along with another letter explaining that I'd paid the rest of it a day earlier. How much you wanna bet I get a notice in July saying that I've logged $50 in late fees? How much you wanna bet this woman weighs 700 pounds and defecates through her nose?\n\nBut that's only the first annoyance. Next up would be my right ear, which alerted me during an otherwise lovely shower a few weeks ago that it no longer wants water to naturally drain out of it. So I've been walking around half-deaf for a couple weeks now, with my ear constantly plugged with - what? Water? Wax? A tick's nest? I don't know, but I've twice used this ear wax cleaning shit that makes it sound like there's a steak sizzling in my ear and the problem has only gotten worse. So don't try to shout \"Watch out for that falling anvil!\" because I can't hear a word you're saying.\n\nAnnoyance #3 is that my boss switched our payroll account to a new bank without telling me, resulting in two May paychecks being returned to me as having bounced. FUCK! Was I supposed to send in the goddamned things the exact day I received them!? Now she has to write me out a new personal check covering the past two payment periods, along with the $10 \"bounced check\" fee that my bank charges (because, after all, it's the RECIPIENT'S fault if a check bounces. Pricks.). Not to mention the fact that I still haven't been paid for LAST AUGUST. Which was, oh, ELEVEN MONTHS AGO.\n\nAnd finally we reach Annoyance #4. Last night my wife gave me a lovely haircut about which I've no complaint. Unfortunately she then instructed me, a man whose fingers constantly shake and occasionally lop off, to \"cut (my) own pubic hair.\" I agreed that with bathing suit season coming up it would be best if my short & curlies no longer dangled past my knees, and took to the task with gusto. Unfortunately, after the job was complete, a regrettable thought entered my head: \"Say! Maybe I'll cut some of this BALL hair too!\" So I began snipping away at the ball hair, carefully but clearly not carefully enough, as it was at this inopportune time that my wife began asking me if I wanted some \"apple slices with cheese.\" Having never heard of such a ghastly vomitous snack in all my years, my mind conjured up images of sweet-meets-cheese, sour-meets-cheese, nature-meets-cheese and the next thing you know I'd nicked my ballsac. If you've never experienced the slicing of the great philosopher Testicles, I tell you what: it bleeds. Bleeds out the ASS, though not literally. So I applied pressure to my nutsac until it stopped bleeding, then cautiously applied a Band-Aid to my scrote. I've taken two showers since, and both times the fuckin' thing has started bleeding again. How am I supposed to go to Tae Kwon Do tonight? What if I do some awesome kick and my ballsac splits in two, flinging balls and nutjuice all willy-nilly over the rest of the class? Fuckin' scissors can eat a dick.\n\nAnd these are just the MAJOR annoyances. Like everybody else, I regularly encounter the minor ones too. Like the way the stall door kept opening while I was taking an hour-long poop this morning. But I consider that less of an annoyance than a golden opportunity to showcase my colossal pecker for the other guys in the office. Hopefully they didn't see my ballsac Band-Aid. The last thing I need are rumors flying about a discount vasectomy.\n\nSo you put together all of these irritants into a big bag of plastic and what do you get? A Miles Davis album! Specifically Cookin', which finds Mr. Davis sharing his recipes for a variety of fine dishes including Shrimp Scampi, Trout A La Peppercorn, and Inability To Write A Decent Song. A further example of \"hard bop,\" this record is yet another batch of Quintet performances from the October 1956 sessions that created Suckin', Blowin' and Jerkin' Off. Lord knows I love Philly Joe Jones Cheese Sandwiches and Christmasy Red Garlands, and everybody knows that a Coltrane John is necessary to keep the engineer from just pissing over the side, but I'll be both good and goddamned if Miles Davis isn't the messiest trumpet player God ever allowed to pick up an instrument. Is he just the Jimmy Page of jazz? Because I like Jimmy Page's messiness - it gives his playing a specific character. If that's the case, then way to go Miles! However, if he's just messy because he sucks, then up your ass Miles! Here's a non-hilarious joke not to ever say to anybody ever -- if you've been listening to music all day and it's midnight and this album is playing and your wife says \"Come up to bed, sweetheart,\" say, \"Sorry honey. I've got Miles to go before I sleep!\" Then try not to listen as she grudge fucks your brother for an hour and a half.\n\nFour tracks rest astride this album. Some of them have crazy names like \"Airegin\" and \"Tune-Up/When The Lights Are Low\"; others go for more traditional titles such as \"My Funny Valentine\" and \"Blues By Five.\" Some are Miles Davis originals; others are the compositions of popular songwriters of the day like Rodgers/Hart and Sonny Rollins. Many of the tracks are slow as dirt with a pleasant enough piano line but ugly, raspy trumpet that's WAY too loud in the mix; several others begin with a piano line reminiscent of \"The Woody Woodpecker Show\" before shittaking into a boring 12-bar blues with solos a gogo; thousands more are fast boppin' big fuckin' yawnin' jazz chord changes of no consequences that suddenly turn into cutesy midtempo swing pop songs halfway through. But through all of these many, many, countless tracks, only one appeals (for more than 15-20 seconds) to the discerning ears of Mark \"Mr. Jazzbo\" Prindle. This is Sonny Rollins' \"Airegin,\" a speedy Spanish Tango Hotcha Intrigue number that cruises along on groovy piano and rhythm section backing horns that actually return to the MELODY several times during the course of four and a half minutes. See? Not all jazz has to be bad! When the musicians finally stop masturbating all over each other and bother to play a hook, it can result in some darned nice ear candy! And this isn't the first time I've used the words \"masturbating\" and \"candy\" in the same sentence, so you might want to shop at a different grocery store.\n\nLet this be a lesson to all you jazz players out there -- stop practicing your solos and start writing some killer riffs. With just a bit more structure and a few more actual songwriters, jazz could become every bit as popular as shitty modern R'n'B!\n\nAlso, Miles Davis forewent the traditional instrument case in favor of an orphaned boy's large intestine, a practice that I find lamentable.\n\nReader Comments\n\nMetalloSoran@aol.com\n\nMark, are you sure that's water in your ear? I had that same thing going on a while ago and what it turned out to be was a virus that caused like post-nasal drip and made me cough a bit and that crazy thing happen to my right ear. I thought I was going deaf or something from my crazy rock and roll lifestyle but luckily I took some allergy medicine (or cold medicine, anything that dries mucus up) and it cleared up. If it really is just water stuck in your ear for no reason then I'm sorry and it appears life hates you. Also, way to go puncturing your scrote. That sucks. Next time use one of those adjustable electric razors like I do. Ok, I hope my retarded advice helps but it probably won't. Good luck.\n\nddickso2@uccs.edu\n\nYeah, not surprised Prindle hates this album most of the four. I don't think the passage of time since his last reviews has much to do with his low rating--it's the most jam-happy of the quartet, and hence the most aimless.\n\nHowever, if you like the style of music, you might get off on it. Personally, that Philly Joe Jones and Paul Chambers dude are too addictive for me NOT to enjoy most anything they toss off, and damn that piano player shore can play, so I'm sold. Overall, for me, the album's too short (about 34 minutes) and too dominated by the two long jams, but it makes a bigger impression than Relaxin, so I give it a four stars (out of five) and use it as vacuuming music.\n\nSpeaking of balls, it's pretty good background music for other, non-family, activities too. But I can't say I've had the problems Mark speaks of above (yet). I seem to have ball pattern baldness, as it were; such is my good fortune.\n\nAdd your thoughts? 'Round About Midnight - Columbia 1957\n\n2011 - \"'Round About Midnight is widely recognized by jazz critics as a landmark album in hard bop and one of the greatest jazz albums of all time.\" - Wikipedia\n\n\"Musically, this sound is as unusual and as beautiful as it was when issued in 1956. Davis had already led the charge through two changes in jazz -- both cool jazz and hard bop -- and was beginning to move in another direction here that wouldn't be defined for another two years.\" - All Music Guide\n\n\"The spare and elliptical trumpet phrasing of Davis hypnotically contrasted with the striving ferocity of Coltrane's tenor sax, and a jazz rhythm section (this one included drummer Philly Joe Jones) had never before sounded so unerringly swinging and yet so effortlessly and provocatively flexible.\" - The Guardian\n\n\"Garland's block-chord accompaniment and lyrical phrasing would influence a whole generation of pianists. Chambers and Jones were like conjoined twins linked at both the head and heart, with an ability to define groove and swing at any tempo.\" - All About Jazz\n\n\"Round Midnight' opens proceedings and is worth the cover price alone. Perhaps the most beautiful of modern standards it is one of Davis finest outingsa masterpiece of understated eloquence.\" - Pop Matters\n\n\"If you want to hear the origins of post-bop modern jazz, this is it.\" - Amazon.com\n\nThere you go, Jazzheads -- a review by critics who actually comprehend the appeal of this boring bleating bullshit. I get the distinct feeling that even if I understood the mechanics of what they were doing, I still wouldn't enjoy listening to it. I sort of like the dark chord changes of Swedish folk cover \"Dear Old Stockholm\" and Miles' surprisingly melodic solo in Thelonius Monk's \"'Round Midnight,\" but the only piece of music that truly makes my beard leap off my face is the awesomely speedy sax/trumpet interplay at the beginning and end of Charlie Parker's \"Ah-Leu-Cha.\" Sadly, the rest of the song does what every other jazz song in the world does: \"doody-doody-doody-doody!\" for four and a half hours.\n\nSpare? Elliptical? Ferocious? Lyrical? Come on, it's just a bunch of jerks blowing carbon dioxide into metal tubes. I've heard more \"unerringly swinging\" expulsions from an iron lung.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Miles Ahead - Columbia 1957.\n\nNow this is the kind of jazz that I loathe more than other. This is one of four LPs that Miley did with arranger Gil Evans and a 19-piece orchestra. An orchestra that keeps playing these piercing, annoying, loud, assholish brass blasts of screaming shit. I can't listen to it. Who has ears that can deal with listening to noise at this frequency? No wonder all jazz fans are like five billion years old - they're the only ones deaf enough to tolerate this earpiss!\n\n\"New Rhumba\" is awesome though. And the quiet parts are nice. Until the fucking BRASS SECTION COMES BACK IN TO YELL IN YOUR FUCKING EAR AGAIN!!!!!!\n\nReader Comments\n\nddickso2@uccs.edu\n\nOh, sakes alive, Prindle, if you hate this stuff, you will simply LOATHE Blood Sweat and Tears' self-titled. They make Dizzy Gillespie look like Marky BASS.\n\nBesides, what's wrong with a little ear-yelling from time to time? I don't hear any complaining on THIS site about Industrial Overdrive, and that's the shrillest song song ever recorded by anyone of all time ever.\n\nAll that said, I consider this album mere light entertainment that happens to appeal to jazzbos. True, it's more sophisticated and artsy-fartsy than Birth of the Cool (each side is just one long suite), and I agree that \"New Rhumba\" owns, but the songs range from decently moody to happily dull. Fortunately, I've been watching a lot of '50's movies lately, and I AM all hopped up on old man ethers, so I'll give it a 7.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Ascenseur Pour L'echafaud - Fontana 1958\n\n2011 - Saaaaaay, this one doesn't suck complete dick at all! For once in his buttfucking life, Miles \"Buttfucker\" Davis has been given a directive: \"Make a soundtrack for my film noir movie\" and VOLIA! There's melody, there's moodiness, there's speedy be-bop, there's groovy cool jazz and trumpet/sax interplay, there's Pink Panther-style intrigue, there's bass bass bass, there's DARK COMPELLING ATMOSPHERE! Most of the time, \"atmosphere\" for Miles Davis means the rotten egg smell emanating from his ass all over the studio, but this time he pulls out a can of Not Just Dicking Around Juice and pours it all over your stereo system for 26 heart-nullifying minutes. VOLIA!\n\nRecorded on December 4th and 5th, 1957 in Paris, France for the Louis Malle film Ascenseur Pour L'echafaud (The Garbage Pail Kids Movie), this brief LP is positive proof that Mr. Davis is capable of writing actual music with actual hooks and actual ambiance. In fact, if it weren't for the usual \"theme repetition\" factor endemic in film soundtrackery (the bluesy \"Florence Sur les Champs-Elysees\" is just a reprise of \"Generique,\" creepy sliterhing \"Julien Dans l'Ascenseur\" is just a reprise of \"L'Assassinat de Carala,\" speedy be-bopper \"Diner au Motel\" is just an extension of \"Sur l'Autoroute\"), it'd probably get a grade so high you wouldn't believe it.\n\nWARNING THOUGH: This 6-rating applies only to the original 26-minute LP, not the suicide-inducingly tedious 77-minute CD reissue.\n\nNow here's a bunch of euphemisms for \"Miles Davis sucks\":\n\n- \"Miles Davis plays melody like most people play backgammon: not at all.\"\n\n- \"Give Miles Davis a trumpet and he'll play it for one day. Teach Miles Davis to play trumpet... Please!\"\n\n- \"Outside a dog, a trumpet is Miles Davis's best friend. Inside a dog, there are bowels capable of creating greater art than 95% of Miles Davis's discography.\n\n- \"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and Miles Davis sucks.\"\n\n- \"...As he poured WD-40 all over his tightly-wedged penis, the haughty British playboy angrily shouted, 'I thought you said Miles Davis's strumpet!'\"\n\n- \"The Who wrote two songs for Miles Davis: one in the case of his going blind ('I Can See For Miles'), the other in the case of his continuing to release albums ('Music Must Change'). Also, 'Boris the Spider' is about Miles Davis buttfucking a spider.\"\n\nAdd your thoughts? Milestones - Columbia 1958.\n\nFeaturing John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderly, this album starts with an astonishing whirlwind flurry of way way WAY too-fast-to-be-human note runs in an incredible speed thrash death grindcore jazz song called \"Dr. Jekyll.\" But after that, it's Business As Usual featuring \"Be Good, Be Good, Be Good Johnny\". The horns are a good 58 frillion times louder than the bass, piano and drums, so any concept of \"melody\" or \"repetition\" is kicked in the windpipe from moment two. And I don't know that I've ever sat through so much endless, mindless soloing in all my days. Thelonius Monk's \"Straight, No Chaser\" comes dangerously close to a hook (later quoted by Ray Manzarek in The Doors' \"We Could Be So Good Together\"!), so the band nips that in the bud superfast, dumping any semblance of catchiness for yet more frenzied, directionless blooping and bleeping.\n\nFuck jazz up the ass. What a worthless piece of shit form of musical expression. Anybody who claims to like it is lying and probably very unpopular and smelly.\n\nReader Comments\n\nglenn.lester@hope.edu\n\nLike others, I've got to give you credit for reviewing Miles. It's unhealthy to worship a musician and you level some fair criticism against jazz as a music. I too, though I try to play and study jazz, am sometimes unnerved by the lack of melodies in solos and the sameness of a lot of tunes. But there's nothing like a well-played jazz solo. And this album is full of 'em. All uptempo (except Sid's Ahead, which is a slow blues) swingers; kind of the antithesis to Kind of Blue. If you were to purchase Kind of Blue, I'd recommend picking up Milestones the same day. Where KoB is slow, soft, cool, Milestones is fast, loud, and just fun. Milestones was recorded a year or so before KoB and features almost the same personnel (Red Garland plays piano here, and the great Philly Joe Jones is on drums). Some highlights of this record: Miles's tension-filled solo on \"Sid's Ahead,\" all of \"Milestones\" (which might be called \"Miles\" on the label), Cannonball and Coltrane trading choruses on \"Dr. Jekyll.\" I understand and agree with some of your criticisms, but try listening to the energy that's going on in all these solos, and how they differ from each other (Miles plays shorter phrases and develops them, Trane spits our run-on sentences from another planet, Cannonball slides and shakes like a preacher). For rockers who want to get into straightahead jazz, I'd recommend this record, along with any Charles Mingus (especially Mingus Ah Um, Blues and Roots, The Clown, and Live in Antibes) or John Coltrane (My Favorite Things or Blue Trane). If I had to give a ten, this would probably be it.\n\nbrandonschooldistrict@hotmail.com (Brandon Schools)\n\nAs an administrator of a Michigan public school, I must complain to you, sir, over the content of your profane website which has become increasingly popular with my students, who are reading it with the computers in the school library, which is for research purposes only. I highly doubt my students have been assigned research papers on the subject of heavy rock bands such as Black Sabbath and AC/DC. These are not artists whom we would even be encouraging our students to listen to, due to their anti-social lyrical content. I browsed through your Miles Davis reviews and was shocked at some of your statements. Allow me to quote: \"F--- jazz up the a--. What a worthless piece of s--- form of musical expression. Anybody who claims to like it is lying and probably very unpopular and smelly.\"\n\nThis, I hope you realize, is an unfair assessment of a perfectly valid form of musical expression as well as the people who enjoy it. I, for one, enjoy jazz a great deal, and I can assure you that I am not \"unpopular\" or \"smelly.\"\n\nThe fact is, Mr. Prindle, that the students at my school do not use profane language. Here at Brandon we have taught them to be respectful and kind. I fear your website will be a negative influence on the student body here, and we are taking steps to block access from the school computers. Mark Prindle's Rock and Roll Record Reviews are no longer welcome at Brandon High School. I hope this message will cause you to reconsider the harmful effect you are having on today's youth.\n\nThank you for your time\n\neric.neuser@umusic.com\n\nYou are an extremely SILLY man Mark. Why have you bothered I wonder? This is the Mark Prindle Rock And Roll Review website after all. You haven't even reviewed Deep Purple or Alice Cooper. But I appreciate your audacity as always. Do not review Muddy Waters, do not collect $200 - head straight for shit's creek and pop a squat on your own paddle. Nice work! I will read all your Miles reviews for entertainment purposes when my boss stops circling my desk looking for more reasons to pass me over for one of the super size cubicles. I confess I had hopes though. There's gotta be other people out there who can get off on D.R.I. and be-bop alike. Especially \"Milestones\". Intense and scary shit lurks within these winds and brass sometimes. And Philly Jo Jones makes Dave Lombardo sound like Lars Ulrich.\n\nthepublicimage79@hotmail.com\n\nIs that comment from the school administrator in Michigan an actual comment?\n\nI mean, I know Michigan's a hole (I live here, for God's sake), but is that actually something someone wrote? I mean...it sounds like some kind of joke! On SNL when it was good!\n\nWow. I just can't believe that - \"the harmful effect you are having on America's youth\" - what is this, the fucking '50's?\n\nddickso2@uccs.edu\n\nBoring. The Quintet albums actually had good songs--this is just show-off speedy experimental doodoo that appeals to people who also play brass instruments and play them really really really fast.\n\nBut DUDE! I actually RECOGNIZE \"Milestones!\" Haven't had that happen to me since Dave Brubeck's \"Take Five.\"\n\nGroudbreaking, but unenjoyable. Get Steamin'. It's entertaining.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Miles 1958 - CBS Japan\n\nIt's appropriate that you can rearrange the letters in \"Miles Davis\" to spell \"Saliva Demon\" because every time he spits into that brass urinal he carries around, it sounds like HELL! King Midas himself would be proud of the way Miles miraculously changed everything he touched into shit. See if you can find old video footage of this era of Miles' development because you can clearly see a thick brown chunky liquid pouring out the loud end of his horn. His colleagues chalked it up to quirkiness or heroin, but I think Miles just had certain special talents that couldn't be heard on record. At least I assume so, because he definitely didn't have any talents that COULD be heard on record!\n\n(*is shot dead by Miles Davis fan*)\n\nHey there! Prindle reporting here from Heaven. I was apparently due for Hell, but Miles is stinkin' up the joint so much, everybody else moved out. This album was released in Japan only, and features Miles sucking balls alongside such talented musicians as John Coltrane, Cannonball \"Julian\" Adderly, Bill Evans, Red Garland, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb and \"Joe\" Philly Jones. The band does a delicious job of running through such mellow, inoffensive elevator music as \"Fran-Dance\" and \"Stella By Starlight,\" as well as some indistinguishable peppy-jazz-by-numbers tracks by the name of \"On Green Dolphin Street\" and \"Love For Sale.\" The one honestly good tune is \"Little Melonae,\" which -- almost startlingly -- has a HOOK! The rest just vacillates between pretty sax playing and horrendously fuckbad splatches of incorrectly performed trumpet.\n\nSee, the great thing about rock music is that you can pick up an electric guitar or bass and just start thwacking around having never seen one before in your life, and the results would STILL be more pleasant on the ears than any note Miles Davis ever played on his trumpet.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Porgy And Bess - Columbia 1958\n\n2005 - Say! Have you heard this one? It's not bad at all! And they say I'm not \"cultured\" and can't appreciate \"jass\" music. Well, you can tell that to the Sheriff of Wrongtown because I'm all over select portions of this swingin' swayin' records playin' rendition of two white guys' \"Porgy And Bess.\" Yes, two white guys have brought us many handy-dandy things in life -- wine coolers, \"The Sounds Of Silence,\" Watergate -- but not since Adam and Steve have two white guys brought us such luxuriant, romantic splendor as select portions of Porgy And Bess. So let's hear it for two white guys! Huzzah! Wade ago! For they're a jolly good fellows, mailboxes etc.\n\nSpecifically, these two white guys are Rodgers and Hammerstein, the finest American pop song composers of their day, aside from the Gershwin Brothers of \"Porgy And Bess\" fame. And when Miles Davis, Gil Evans, Cannonball Adderly, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb, Danny Banks and a whole lotta hornyass motherfuKKKas got together to ride the Gershey Highway on a custom-built jalopy of Orchestral/Big Band/Cool Jazz, the results were on many occasions as melodic, melodious and unmalodorous as other artists' pretty songs (ex. \"Seagull\" by Bad Company).\n\nFirst of all, thank GODD for prewritten material. There ain't jackass wrong with billions of brass instruments if they're playing an actual *SONG* instead of leading the listener on a wild goose chase of random notes with no destination in sight. These arrangements are extremely well-done, with crazy syncopation, weird chords changing over groovy bass/drum combinations, and oodles of multiple-horn harmonies and interplay. I'm not afraid to say \"Why are there so godmanydamned ballads on this fuckface?\" for I find the Gershwin's old school balladry devoid of both humanity and hooks. But the great songs are so good, they're not half bad at all!\n\nThese great songs include:\n\n- \"The Buzzard Song,\" with its sad trumpet vocalizing over REALLY nice multiple sorrowful horns galore playing odd, weepy, neat, interesting chords and sequences over a groovin' bass/drum combo arrangements -- and a tuba solo(!)\n\n- \"Gone,\" highlighted by its kooky syncopation, intriguing and really fun stop-start drum breaks, odd songwriting and snazzy fast thingy\n\n- \"Gone, Gone, Gone\" which is not the previous track repeated three times but a very short dark melancholy ballad with some clever, spooky chord changes, lots of empty spaces and quieter moments, and even a little church music influence for the religious (gullible) at heart\n\n- the ultra-classic \"Summertime,\" with its violently non-summerish eerie-as-an-ear ascending chord sequence that's impossible to ruin (even with a shitty frumpy trumpet tone)\n\n- \"Prayer (Oh Doctor Jesus),\" beloved for its awesome call-response intro (bizarre trumpet swooping and clucking, followed by harmonized response horns), evil tone, morbid drama and dark descending chord sequence, culminating in an extremely loud and bright ending that YELLS ALL UP YOU AS THE MUSICIANS DO THEY THANG!\n\n- and finally the itsy-bitsy \"Here Come De Honey Man,\" a spider of a song that climbs up the waterspout of \"Silent Night\" until a rain of toodly-doodly horns come down and wash the spider of a song out, before the sun of VERY well-done instrumental interplay comes out and dries up all the rain of toodly-doodly horns so the itsy-bitsy spider of a song can climb up the waterspout of \"Silent Night\" again.\n\nHowever, the rest of the album eats shit off a spoon made of other, harder shit.\n\nNo no, I'm kidding! Parts are fine, parts are dandy. I've simply named the tracks that actually hold my attention all the way through from start to finish without running off at the mouth with improvised brapp crapp. Best of all, the remixed CD buries the trumpet where it belongs - ALONGSIDE the other instruments, rather than towering above them and smothering their beauty like a big ugly trumpet-playing stepsister hiding a beautiful horny Cinderella in the closet.\n\nThat was a metaphor, incidentally. When I said 'horny,' I meant as in 'trumpets' and 'trombones' and things.\n\nThat's what Cinderella was jamming up her thingy in the closet.\n\nDon't you love the phrase \"jilling off\"? It's great because its coy gentle cuteness makes it sound like girls can actually enjoy self-pleasure even with the knowledge that they could be nailing Mark Prindle right now.\n\nActually that's not true. I'm married and have a band-aid on my testicle. But otherwise - wham bam thank you man!\n\nShit, I fucked a guy.\n\nReader Comments\n\nddickso2@uccs.edu\n\nI'm with the Sheriff of Wrongtown on this one. Yeah, all the songs are based on classics of some kind, but eh, maybe Gil Evans just isn't my bag. I like it better when Miles goes all crazy and wickedass with his heroin-addicted buddies and solos at top speed for like two thousand years. (But not when he does it on Milestones. That one doesn't count.)\n\nSo far I've listened to eleven frigging Miles Davis albums in less than two weeks, including Kind of Blue, Birth of the Cool, and Bitches Brew for the second buttmunching time. So far, only Workin' and Steamin' justify the hype.\n\nHey, that's two classics from the same artist. Better record than Radiohead, I'd say.\n\nP.S. Say, does the album Bags' Groove even exist? All Music Guide says it does, but I think they lie. I can't even DOWNLOAD the thing.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Kind Of Blue - Columbia 1959.\n\nI'm not gonna name any names here but a guy I used to work with wrote an entire book about this album. Again, no names will be discussed here because it's all water under the bridge, but I really, really, REALLY actively despised this human being while I worked with him. It was my first job out of college and he constantly berated me, treated me like an idiot, forced me to stay late to correct his mistakes, blamed me for his errors, yelled at me any time I didn't kiss his ass and essentially made me despise my life for a good three months until my boss finally canned his bastard ass. Chances are decent that he's an okay guy outside of work, but my god what an insufferable, egotistical prick he was to work with. You have no idea how happy I was the day he got fired - not just because it made my life much more pleasant but because he got the comeuppance that he so dreadfully deserved.\n\nOf course, now he's a published author and I'm writing press releases about online checkers, but at the time it certainly felt like vengeance! So if you happen to run across a book about this album, take a look at the author's picture and wonder to yourself if it just might be the fellow I'm talking about............\n\nAs for the record, it's another one with John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderly that features a good forty minutes of group improv. Everyone seems to love this album and I'm happy for them but aside from the great main hooks in \"All Blues\" and the classic \"So What,\" I have no tolerance for nor interest in hearing a bunch of guys making crap up on the spot. So watch for my book Kind Of Blew: The Making Of Another Miles Davis Album That Sounds Just Like All His Others in a bookstore near me loose!\n\nReader Comments\n\njamshidi@purdue.edu\n\nok Mark, now i've been a loyal Prindle Record Review site visiter and contributor for years now, but i think you've crossed some sort of line with these miles davis reviews. Now i realize that you could very well be joking around throught all these reviews, but i think you're totally out of line here. Some of the things you say just totally piss me off, for example: \"I have no tolerance for nor interest in hearing a bunch of guys making crap up on the spot.\" The fact that you would even dare to say that anything coming out of miles', trane's, or cannonball's mouth is crap insults me honestly. These guys are some of the most brilliant musicians the world has ever known, and whether you know that or not, you should respect them. I'm not saying that you should like their records or like jazz for that matter, just respect them and don't treat their work like it's meaningless, because they put their heart and soul into their work, and if you listen hard enough and open up your mind a bit, you can hear their emotions. I admit that most of the time when i hear jazz, i just think it's cool cause they're such good musicians, but i try to hear what they're saying...whether i do or not is another thing. Which leads me to something you wrote in the Milestones review: \"Fuck jazz up the ass. What a worthless piece of shit form of musical expression.\" Ok, i'll tell you what a worthless piece of shit form of musical expresson is. Try any punk band that ever existed, even the misfits who i like. And every stupid shit pop band out these days. None of those dumb fucks could express the way they feel just by playing a note.\n\nThese guys spoke novels practically, only if you can open your mind up to them. Well, i could go on and on about how what you're saying is offensive, but i think i'll stop and actually review the album.\n\nWell, this was the first jazz album i actually purchased, and it's a great way to start a collection. Everyone on the album is a master, EVERYONE. I like it pretty well, although i'm not as big of a fan of cool jazz as i am more up-tempo bop kind of stuff. But a lot of memorable solos, whether you think so or not Mark. I mean, i can hum along with a bunch of parts in trane's and cannonball's solos. i'd give the album an 8.\n\nAnyway, bottom line is, if you don't like jazz, fine, but you better damn well respect the people behind it, cause they deserve it.\n\nInMyEyes82@aol.com (Zach English)\n\nLook: the last thing I feel like doing is preaching about how jazz should be listened to. I can perfectly understand the argument about how the instrumental interplay is too homogenous, how endless improvisation seems to overtake the central melodies sometimes, how goddamn piercing a saxophone can sound after a while, etc. Hell, I hated the shit too at first.\n\nBut now it's an indispensable tangent of my listening tastes. It's really true that you have to hear some songs (especially the more oblique stuff by Ornette Coleman and Monk) ten or fifteen times to let them properly sink in. But it's worth it; no music I've ever heard has so many surprises stuffed in its cracks. Take Monk's Brilliant Corners, for example: one of the most astonishing examples of composition/improvisation this country has ever spat out, easily on a plane with Stravinsky and Louis Armstrong. When I first heard that album I was annoyed with how difficult and plodding the structures seemed to be and how Monk keeps playing the 'wrong' notes on the piano. But some music just demands time to settle into the folds and crimps in your brain, and most jazz I love requires rapt attention: Ornette, Dolphy, Monk among them.\n\nAnd Kind of Blue is a revelation, but like Mark I prefer the Bitches Brew/Silent Way/Jack Johnson stuff just because at heart I'm a rock 'n' roll fan too.\n\nP.S.-Mark, this guy sounds like a real asshole!\n\ncola@together.net\n\nMark, I can understand your contempt for the Velvet Underground. I happen to like the band, but most of the people to whom I've introduced their records hate them.\n\nBUT KIND OF BLUE GETTING FOUR LITTLE GODDAMN RED DOTS???\n\nPeople: for once, listen to the critics. Kind of Blue is Miles Davis' masterpiece. He made some other great albums, but had he only released this one he'd still be a jazz giant. Every song is a standard, more or less. The style of playing, while not exactly revolutionary, crystallized and immortalized the genre. Kind of Blue's only peer in the pantheon of jazz albums is John Coltrane's A Love Supreme (not counting box sets or compilations, else Louis Armstrong's Hot Five & Seven recordings would tower above them all).\n\nIf you only own one jazz record, this should...no, this must be it. Even if you don't like the stuff, it's an essential document of twentieth-century music. And pick up Woody Guthrie's Dust Bowl Ballads, which is basically to folk music what Kind of Blue is to jazz.\n\nkatsman7@hotmail.com (Madd Hunter)\n\nI'm not really into jazz (like you, Mark) and I'm a classic rock/prog rock fan (Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull etc). However, I love \"Kind Of Blue\". It's the essential jazz album. My favourites are \"Freddie Freeloader\" and \"So What\". And I have only two jazz albums! This and John Coltrane's \"Blue Train\". Both are pretty good. Except Miles, there are playing various musicians piano, keyboards, saxophone, drums etc. Listen to this album again. It will grow on you. A perfect 10 of 10.\n\njstallin@usc.edu\n\nI've read many of your reviews on this site with interest and appreciation, and, more often than not, find compatibility with your taste. Your style too is often brilliant, when it is not going off half-cocked. At any rate, your insights in re: the Ramones, the Clash, Pavement, the Fall, and others seem to me dead on target. I can cavil over matters of subtlety in your opinion of the Stones (I'd argue Exile is their best - and indeed the best rock album of all time), as well as Sonic Youth (I place Dirty substantially above Goo, for example - I don't buy for a second the view that they sold out to grunge), but you never stray so far off base that anyone could accuse you of ignorance or bad taste.\n\nUntil now. You need to take this nonsense - meaning all of your Miles Davis reviews -- down from your site. Not only is it ill-considered - demonstrating at times a regrettable culmination of some of the presumably drug or alcohol induced rants elsewhere on the site -- it makes a badge of ignorance. What chemical elicited from you the crazed review of Agharta? How many times have you actually listened to Miles Ahead?\n\nAs much as I revere rock and roll, there is not one rock artist or group - with the possible exception of Dylan -- who can stand shoulder to shoulder with Miles. As a musician, writer, bandleader and innovator, he simply towers above most rock artists. He is one of the truly great artists of the second half of the twentieth century. And this reputation is secure. You only do yourself - and others who may actually be influenced by these reviews - a disservice by posting this bullshit.\n\nerrado@dipnoi.com (Bernardo Pacheco)\n\nI thought it was pretty cool that Prindle did this page saying what he's saying. He is being very honest and in no moment speaks from a supposed authority position or puts it in a way that might mislead you. He's being clear about what HE likes in music and about what HE fails to find in jazz. Instead of writing pages of half-assed theory (by which I'm NOT suggesting all theory is half-assed) or making sad attempts at being a poet among critics. He's not pretending to pass some definitive judgment on these (or any) albums, which is a far worse and very common sin of music critics. And I don't think he's being any bit as insulting as a good part of the negative reviews I've read in my life. He's not saying Miles sucks at what he does, he's saying he can't find much interest in jazz at all. I'm sure he'll get enough complaints and insults to fill books and books for this, but as far as I'm concerned that will be the result of the readers' view of this music as sacred. Which is pretty sad.\n\nAs far as this album goes, I've only heard it once a couple of years ago and I can't remember it enough to have an opinion.\n\nglenn.lester@hope.edu\n\nThis one is commonly called the greatest jazz recording ever, but like Sgt. Pepper's, it ain't true. It's certainly great, amazing (all the solos on \"So What\" blow me away), but there's no real burners, and the mood gets real mellow on the second half of the record. But it's essential amazing listening nonetheless. The way to listen to this album is just concentrating one tune at a time, looking for all the intracacies in the solos, how they build from simple phrases into longer melodies. But Mark, I think your criticism that all jazz guys are just showing off and wanking is pretty inaccurate when it comes to Miles. He's famous for leaving space in his solos, playing short, odd phrases. I can see how you wouldn't like Coltrane's playing, but his playing just sounds so urgent and otherworldly. Not many other players can do what he does.\n\nThe 60s quintet of Miles, Wayne Shorter (tenor), Ron Carter (bass), Herbie Hancock (piano), and Tony Williams (drums) probably had the best rhythm sections ever. Miles Smiles is the essential album by this group. Almost free sometimes, but still grounded in hard bop and modal playing. Tony Williams was like 19 when that album was recorded. Also check out the album 1964: The Complete Concert. It's two discs originally released seperately, one with all ballads and mid-tempo tunes, and the other with super-fast versions of \"So What,\" \"Joshua,\" \"Four,\" and others. It has the Carter-Hancock-Williams rhythm section, Miles, and some tenor player named George Coleman who preceded Wayne Shorter in the group. It has amazing interaction between the soloists and the rhythm section, especially Miles and Herbie on the first (ballads) disc, on \"My Funny Valentine\" and \"Stella by Starlight.\" Probably the Miles album I listen to most, because of the searing intensity of the playing and the ESP-like interaction among players.\n\nvictorprose@yahoo.com (Victor Prose)\n\nListen, Mark. If you dont' fucking get jazz, DON'T FUCKING REVIEW IT! Stick to your obscure punk bands and classic rock'n'roll artists, but don't berate a style of music you don't truly understand! This doesn't go for me, 'cuz I'm a classically trained pianist as well as rock aficianado, but while shit like Black Aria and Pictures at an Exhibition are okay to lambaste because they're done by rock artists and you understand rock and are familiar with its various styles and you know what's good and bad in it, but a rock critic cannot pick up a Beethoven and realize its true genius because he hasn't been exposed to music so dull or methodical in comparison to his other stuff, and therefore should not review it! MY SENTENCES ARE BECOMING ILL-FORMED, BECAUSE THE FACT THAT MILES DAVIS IS MAKING AN APPEARANCE ON A ROCK'N'ROLL SITE AND BEING CALLED \"STUPID\" IS AN UNBELIEVABLE THING! YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT FUCKING CRITIC AND WRITER MARK, BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND ROCK'N'ROLL! Now go apologize to Kind of Blue and retire to your room without supper.\n\nmatti.alakulju@peterstar.ru\n\nFirst I'd like to say here: This guy Mark is running a site called \"rock and roll reviews\" or something like that. Then he announces that he doesn't understand jazz at all. People who understand and love jazz, should not look at this site to find proper reviews of jazz records. Go read Downbeat instead. Mark has decided to say his humble opinion about so"
