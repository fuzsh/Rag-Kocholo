        "text": "Miles Davis, the trumpeter whose lyrical simplicity often reduced his audiences to tears but whose demonic habits sometimes overshadowed his genius for jazz, died Saturday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center. Davis, who was 65, died from a combination of pneumonia, respiratory failure and a stroke, according to hospital spokeswoman Pat Kirk, who quoted Davis' physician, Dr. Jeff Harris.\n\nThe ailments that finally killed him were only the latest in a series of maladies. These included a throat operation for polyps which subsequently affected his voice, hip surgery necessitated by sickle-cell anemia, leg infections, ulcers, gallstones and addictions to heroin and cocaine.\n\nCalled jazz's only true superstar for his wide appeal that cut across socioeconomic barriers and the \"Black Prince\" for the distant elegance that was his persona, Davis was a series of enigmas and contradictions.\n\nHe was short and slender with a delicate, almost feminine face, yet he was a skilled boxer and physical culture enthusiast and who also admitted to being at one time a pimp and drug addict.\n\nProfessionally he was an artist who crossed over from the freneticism of be-bop to the era of \"cool jazz\" to the realm of fusion and rock 'n' roll. And, his recordings, unlike those of most of his peers, remained in catalogs four decades after they were issued _ commercial testimony to his continuing popularity.\n\nAlthough he never used the word jazz to describe his music _ for Davis said the word diminished the importance of a form of music primarily identified with blacks _ it was impossible to separate him from the genre.\n\nFrom the flea-infested hotel rooms and heroin-laden saloons he shared with Charlie \"Yardbird\" Parker in the infancy of bop, to the synthesized melding of Latin rhythms and Afro soul, Davis was a jazzman.\n\nBut unlike most of the struggling artists involved in the post-World War II spawning of modern, \"cool,\" jazz, Miles Dewey Davis III never needed the money.\n\nHe was born the son of a dentist and oral surgeon who owned hundreds of acres of Alton, Ill., and whose mother taught music.\n\nIt was that financial independence, said his sister Dorothy, that made her brother able to \"turn his back on people he didn't like when he sensed a racial snub. . . . He always spoke his mind.\"\n\nWhile his father hoped he would become a doctor, the 12-year-old Miles gravitated to the trumpet and lessons with Elwood Buchanan in St. Louis.\n\nHe was encouraged to emulate the grace of Bobby Hackett and not the heated virtuosity of Louis Armstrong. He would one day be called by his friend, the arranger Gil Evans, \"the first man to change the sound of the trumpet since Armstrong.\"\n\n\"Play without vibrato,\" Davis said he was once told. \"You're gonna get old anyway and start shaking.\"\n\nFrom that he developed a lyric, often melancholy manner of phrasing with expressive nuances. It was a sound once described as that \"of a man walking on egg shells.\" Critic Ira Gitler described the tone like \"a diamond cutting into opaque glass.\"\n\nAt its purest, the Davis sound sent writers scurrying for synonyms for \"lyrical.\" At its depths it was once offered as a hangover cure.\n\n\"However gloomy life may be,\" said a long-ago reviewer, \"it cannot possibly be as gloomy as Davis makes it out to be.\"\n\nDavis normally strived for simplicity, unlike the labyrinthian techniques of another of the trumpet's acknowledged masters: Dizzy Gillespie.\n\nAnd as time passed Davis became even less a radical improvisationist and more a thematic entrepreneur, unafraid to repeat and polish his ideas during his solos. Because of that drive toward melodic perfection, he was sometimes accused of having composed his impromptu reflections.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Davis went to New York where he met his idol, Parker, and then Gillespie. At the urging of his parents he enrolled in the prestigious Juilliard School of Music but spent more time hanging out in 52nd Street nightclubs where a new sound called \"be-bop\" was incubating.\n\n\"Up at Juilliard,\" Davis said, \"I played in the symphony, two notes, \"bop-bop,' every 90 bars. . . . So I said let me out of here and then I left.\"\n\nHe sat in with the bands of Benny Carter and Billy Eckstine and made his first records with saxophonist Coleman Hawkins. Through Hawkins, Davis developed a taste for expensive clothes that in later years evolved into polka-dot smoking jackets, plaid pants and oversized sunglasses positioned under a head of hair most male lions would have envied.\n\nDavis always enjoyed the material success that his fame produced and loved to twit people, particularly whites, who would see his expensive cars and lavish wardrobes and approach him on the street.\n\n\"You must be an entertainer,\" they would say. Davis loved to respond: \"No, I'm a janitor.\"\n\nHe spent four years with Parker and in the early 1950s formed his own group, the Capitol Band, named for a series of recordings for that record company. It was a nine-man combo that played arrangements by Evans, formerly with Claude Thornhill, although Davis by now was writing much of his own material.\n\nHe also was participating in experimental workshops led by Evans and began collaborating with Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis and Johnny Carisi in a series of records reissued years later as Birth of the Cool.\n\nDavis' own group featured a unique sound centered around lower register brass instruments with muted dynamics. This was to be a forerunner of \"cool jazz,\" itself an alternative to the frantic pace of \"be-bop.\" Many credit the Davis quintet (or sextet on occasion) as setting the stage for the small jazz ensembles that were to follow.\n\nBut by the late 1940s Davis had become a heroin addict (some blamed Parker's influence) and within a few years had become so debilitated he was unable to perform, although he did make a few recordings with Horace Silver, Parker, Sonny Rollins and Art Blakey.\n\nIn 1954, however, despite what George Wein and most of the music world knew of Davis' plight, the founder of the Newport Jazz Festival took a chance and signed Davis for that legendary musical gathering.\n\nDavis came on stage and joined a jam session in progress, playing a muted solo on Round Midnight. Whether it was the performance itself or whether the crowd was reacting to Davis' struggle with narcotics is arguable. The ovation he received was so overwhelming that the trumpeter was encouraged to form a quintet that featured a then-unknown tenor saxophonist named John William Coltrane playing alongside pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers and drummer Philly Joe Jones.\n\nIn 1954 he first put a stemless mute on his horn, adding to the delicate phrasing heard on such albums as Bye Bye Blackbird and 'Round Midnight.\n\nIn 1957 he made the first of several remarkable solo recordings on trumpet and flugelhorn and added cornetist and trumpeter Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley to the quintet. Later such giants of the medium as Herbie Hancock, Sonny Stitt, Hank Mobley and Shorter moved in and out of his quintet or sextet.\n\nOn stage, Davis continued to draw accolades for his experimentation and his artistry but not for his demeanor. Unlike most performers, Davis never played to an audience, sometimes even turning his back on the crowd while refusing to announce the songs he was playing.\n\nThere also were times when he didn't show up for his concerts at all and times when he showed up but walked off the stage without any apparent provocation.\n\n\"I play for myself and I play for musicians,\" was all that Davis would say publicly about his antics.\n\nIn his 1989 Miles: The Autobiography, Davis confirmed his drug addictions, his violent episodes with women, including his three wives (one of them actress Cicely Tyson), his imprisonment for non-support of one wife, and his general unpleasantness to those around him.\n\n\"In my life I have few regrets and little guilt,\" he wrote. \"Those regrets I do have I don't want to talk about.\" How he behaved was irrelevant, he suggested. How he played was not.\n\nAs he aged, the raspy-voiced horn player publicly rejected the \"living legend\" aphorism that was increasingly used to describe him. He said it didn't square with his drive to stay in the forefront of contemporary, evolving music.\n\nHis eagerness to remain in music's mainstream didn't endear him to all.\n\nIn 1990 The New Republic critic Stanley Crouch accused him of \"mining the fool's gold of rock 'n' roll\" in a reproach headlined \"Miles Davis: \"The Most Brilliant Sellout in the History of Jazz.\"\n\nBut generally, he was admired for his fluent and frequent shifts in direction.\n\n\"Perhaps more than any other musician in the history of jazz,\" said Los Angeles Times jazz critic Leonard Feather, \"Miles Davis changed directions time and again . . .\n\n\"During every move, Davis took a sizable portion of the jazz community along with him, acquiring new musicians and new audiences to keep pace with each trend. Whichever of his many facets one admires _ and few of his followers are neutral about some of his more radical moves _ he left an impact that will last well into the next century and arguably beyond.\"\n\nIn a 1981 New York Times interview Davis was asked if during any of his physical and emotional turmoil he had ever thought about losing his ability to play.\n\n\"It doesn't go like that with me,\" he replied. \"I never think about not being able to do anything. I just pick up my horn and play the hell out of it.\"\n\nIn August he was made a chevalier in the French Legion d'Honneur. Minister of Culture Jack Lang called him \"the Picasso of jazz.\"\n\nIn what could well be an epitaph, Lang said that Davis \"has imposed his law on the world of show business: esthetic intransigence.\"\n\nMemorial services are pending in New York City and East St. Louis, Ill."
