        "text": "Miles Davis, (born May 26, 1926, Alton, Ill., U.S.—died Sept. 28, 1991, Santa Monica, Calif.), U.S. trumpeter and bandleader. Davis grew up in East St. Louis, Ill., and began study at the Juilliard School in New York City in 1944. He worked with Charlie Parker (1946–48). His early efforts as a bandleader resulted in a series of recordings (1949–50) later released as the album Birth of the Cool (1957), in which a relaxed aesthetic replaced the more frenetic bebop with the “cool jazz” of the 1950s. From 1955 Davis’s groups framed his spare, lyrical approach in contrast to the dense complexity of saxophonists such as John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter. His dark, brooding tone, logically paced improvisations, and frequent use of the metal mute were major influences on jazz trumpet soloists. The 1959 album Kind of Blue was a pioneering example of modal harmonic jazz. His music became more aggressive during the 1960s, and his use of electronic instruments by the end of the decade (Bitches Brew, 1969) gave rise to the jazz-rock fusion of the 1970s. Davis was one of the most original and influential jazz musicians. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006."
