        "text": "Francis (“Frank”) Dawson Elkins was a realtor and insurance broker.\n\nHe lived at 1900 Comox Street at the time of the 1911 Canada census.\n\nFamily Background\n\nFrancis Dawson Elkins was born on November 27, 1874, in Reading, Berkshire, England. (Some sources say that he was born in 1876 or 1877.) His parents were Frederick Elkins (1843-1887) and Agnes Mitchell (1842-1935).\n\nFrederick Elkins was baptized in Guildford, Surrey on May 10, 1843.\n\nFrederick trained to become a solicitor.\n\nHe married Agnes Mitchell in London, England, on January 25, 1870.\n\nFrederick died in Reading, Berkshire on March 31, 1887.\n\nAgnes Elkins died in Santa Monica, California on November 8, 1935.\n\nTo Canada\n\nFrank arrived in Canada about 1890. It appears that he was in Broadview, Manitoba in 1891, and that he was working as a carpenter.\n\nBy 1901, Frank was living in Winnipeg, Manitoba, along with his widowed mother, Agnes, who had arrived in Canada in 1898.\n\nTo Vancouver\n\nBy 1906, Frank was in Vancouver. He was the British Columbia superintendent for the London Guarantee and Accident Company.\n\nFrank and his brother James Edgar Elkins later established a real estate and insurance business called Elkins Brothers. Their offices were in the Union Building at 536 West Hastings Street.\n\nElkins Brothers – Henderson’s City of Vancouver and North Vancouver Directory – 1909 – page 34.\n\nMarriage to Edna Cook\n\nOn April 21, 1908, in Vancouver, Frank married Edna Jacqueline Cook. She was born in the Rural District of Minnedosa, Manitoba, on March 14, 1883. Her parents were Edward Cook (1854-1940) and Maria Douglas (1856-1940).\n\nLife in Vancouver\n\nFrank and Edna lived in Vancouver after their marriage.\n\nIn 1911, they moved to 1900 Comox Street for the summer.\n\nLater in 1911, they moved to Shaughnessy Heights.\n\nMilitary Service\n\nDuring the First World War, Frank joined the Canadian Expeditionary Forces.\n\nHe served in Canada, England and France. He became a captain, and he was released from the military forces on August 23, 1919, during the general demobilization at the end of the war.\n\nReturn to Vancouver\n\nAfter the war, Frank returned to Vancouver.\n\nHe and Edna lived in Vancouver until 1925.\n\nTo California\n\nIn August 1925, Frank and Edna moved to the United States.\n\nBy 1930, they were living in Santa Monica, California.\n\nIn 1931, Frank and Edna applied to become naturalized United States citizens. They were living at 520 Montana Avenue in Santa Monica.\n\nIn 1940, Frank and Edna were still in Santa Monica. Frank was the owner of a wholesale and retail antique business.\n\nEdna died in Santa Monica on September 28, 1954.\n\nFrank died in Santa Monica on February 17, 1956.\n\nIt appears that Frank and Edna did not have any children.\n\nSources\n\nFrederick Elkins (father of Francis Dawson Elkins)\n\nFrederick Elkins (1843–1887); Birth: APRIL 1843, Guildford, Surrey; Death: APRIL 1887, Reading, Berkshire (ancestry.ca).\n\nFrederick Elkins (10 May 1843 – from April 1887 to June 1887); https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/MXVB-L57.\n\n“England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975”, database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NPYR-7B6 : 21 March 2020), Frederick Elkins, 1843.\n\n“England, Surrey Parish Registers, 1536-1992,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QGZR-VYHR : 8 March 2018), Frederick Elkins, 10 May 1843; citing Baptism, , London Metropolitan Archives, England; FHL microfilm 307,812.\n\n“England and Wales Birth Registration Index, 1837-2008,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2N7P-WMG : 1 October 2014), Frederick Elkins, 1843; from “England & Wales Births, 1837-2006,” database, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : 2012); citing Birth Registration, Guildford, Surrey, England, citing General Register Office, Southport, England.\n\n“England and Wales Census, 1851,” database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:SGJK-YYR : 9 November 2019), Frederick Elkins in household of William Edmund Elkins, , Surrey, England; citing , Surrey, England, p. 25, from “1851 England, Scotland and Wales census,” database and images, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : n.d.); citing PRO HO 107, The National Archives of the UK, Kew, Surrey.\n\nAncestry.com. 1861 England Census [database on-line].
