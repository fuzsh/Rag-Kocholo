        "text": "To create this list, we combed Wikipedia for every English page that links to the Miles Davis entry, which is about 2,452 articles across hundreds of topics. A few highlights:\n\nPages like these give us a wider, more comprehensive view of Miles’ impact on culture. His Wikipedia page is an amazingly condense synopsis of Miles’ life, but it only links to about 10% of the dataset. ← the Miles Davis Wikipedia entry links to pages highlighted in red\n\nLet’s get a better understanding of the 2,000 pages that mention Miles Davis. Here’s a breakdown by category:\n\nThe People pages include typical jazz icons such as John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, and Herbie Hancock, but also contemporaries (James Baldwin, The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix) and influencees (including Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, Joni Mitchell).\n\nRecordings are the next largest category, which includes anything you can listen to: tracks, albums, compositions, and compilations. Most of these are in Miles Davis’ discography or involve him in some way. Other recording pages include To Pimp a Butterfly (Kendrick Lamar was influenced by Miles), 2001 (Dr. Dre was compared to Miles Davis by critics), and Ready to Die (Biggie sampled Miles on a track)."
