His parents, dentist Miles Davis, Jr and his wife,Cleota Henry, a music teacher and violinist, were from Arkansas, and owned a farm there. He had an older sister, Dorothy, and a younger brother, Vernon.[2] He was nine when he received his first trumpet as a gift and soon began lessons with Elwood Buchanan, a jazz trumpeter and music teacher Davis later credited with greatly influencing his technique. In January of 1944, he finished high school and went to New York to study music at Julliard. He soon dropped out of school to join the New York music scene as a member of Charlie Parker's Quintet, until 1948.[1]\n\nin July of 1944, he and his high school girlfriend, Irene Cawthon Birth, had their first child, Cheryl Davis. Irene and Cheryl joined him in New York.[1] At least one source describes his relationship with Irene as a common-law marriage.[3]\n\nHis children with Irene Cawthon Birth:\n\nCheryl Davis (1944)\n\nGregory Davis (1946)\n\nMiles (Davis) Abdullah (1950-2015)\n\nIn the spring of 1949, in Paris, he met French singer and actress Juliette Gréco while she was performing on the stage of a cabaret. Their \"love at first sight\" was mutual. The racial segregation prevailing across the Atlantic at that time prevented them from considering a common future on American soil. Miles Davis returned to the United States alone, but they remained friends for the rest of his life.[4]\n\nHe married Broadway dancer Frances Elizabeth Taylor in Toledo, Ohio in 1959. They had no children and she filed for divorce in 1966.[5]\n\nIn 1968 he married model and singer-songwriter Betty Mabry; they divorced the following year, with no children.[1] She introduced him to musical innovators Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone, who greatly influenced his electric, or jazz fusion, period.[6]\n\nHe had a relationship with Marguerite Eskridge in the seventies, and they had a son:\n\nErin Davis (1970)[1]\n\nHe married the actress Cicely Tyson in Massachusetts in 1981; they divorced in 1989, with no children. She helped him overcome his drug addiction, but his health continued to decline.[1]\n\nMiles Davis died on 28 September 1991 in Santa Monica, California,[7] and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York.[8]\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 Wikipedia contributors, \"Miles Davis,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Miles_Davis&oldid=1021250209 (accessed May 6, 2021).\n\n↑ \"United States Census, 1940,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KWZD-NL9 : accessed 26 October 2017), Miles Davis in household of Miles Davis, Tract SCC-9, East St. Louis, East St. Louis Township, St. Clair, Illinois, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 82-67, sheet 8B, line 62, family 155, Sixteenth Census of the United States, 1940, NARA digital publication T627.
