        "text": "'This wide-ranging and imaginative volume offers invaluable insight into the work of one of the most important cultural theorists and creative writers of our time. One can only applaud the contributors' efforts to do justice to the scope and depth of Anzaldua's dazzlingly original poetry and prose. This bold and illuminating book will help scholars in American Studies, Cultural Studies, Gender Studies, Religious Studies and a range of other fields, come to terms with the rich, multivalent achievement of the incomparable Gloria Anzaldua.' - Shelley Fisher\n\nFishkin, Stanford University, past-president American Studies Association\n\n\"Reading this intellectually delicious anthology reminded me of Anzaldúa's stunning genius. It provides further evidence that she belonged to all of us and none of us at the same time. This book is a tantalizing invitation to expand our understanding of Anzaldúa's ideas. As an educator and as a Chicana, I have been yearning for this anthology for some time.\" - Edén Torres, University of Minnesota"
