        "text": "The King of Cool, Miles Davis, was posthumously inducted into Hollywood’s RockWalk on Thursday. The event was attended by musicians and members of the Davis family, including his son, Erin, and daughter, Cheryl.\n\nWhile living icons have had their handprints immortalized on the sidewalk gallery outside the Guitar Center on Sunset Boulevard, a bronze bust of Davis will be put on display outside the store instead. Davis died in 1991 at age 65.\n\nDavis first picked up the trumpet at age 13 and made his recording debut in 1947. He was renowned for morphing his cool jazz into fusion and experimental sounds that later gave way to jazz funk and hip-hop grooves. His many many legendary albums include “Round About Midnight,” “The Birth of Cool” and “Kind of Blue.”\n\nRecently, a DVD, a movie, a Smithsonian museum exhibit and induction in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame have all renewed Davis’ popularity in what would have been his 80th-birthday year. Don Cheadle has agreed to play Davis in an upcoming biopic and a new Davis CD will be released this fall called “Evolution of the Groove” featuring guitarist Santana and rapper Nas.\n\nThe RockWalk was established in 1985 to honor musicians who have made a significant contribution to the history of music."
