        "text": "Thomas Albert Davis peacefully passed away at home on February 20, 2024, surrounded by his family.\n\nTom was born on May 10, 1939, in Brigham City, Utah, to Lloyd Nelson Davis and Annie Grace Thompson Davis. He was raised in Brigham City where he and his friends spent their formative years exploring the foothills and canyon above town, forging lifelong friendships along the way. He graduated from Box Elder High School in 1957.\n\nHe received an education at Utah State University, where he was a member of the swim team and the Sigma Chi Fraternity. The years at USU would have a lasting effect as lifelong friendships developed there as well. Tom graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1962. After graduation, he taught math at Box Elder High School. It was here in January 1964, during her student teaching, that he met Pearl Ann Brown. They married on July 18, 1964, and their marriage was later solemnized in the Logan LDS Temple.\n\nFrom a young age, Tom had a special love for homing pigeons and various other animals. He operated the Davis Ranch for many years before returning to school to pursue a Master of Art, a lifelong passion of his. In 1987, he took a teaching position at Bear River High School, where he taught art and math until his retirement in 2005. He thoroughly enjoyed teaching math, but his true passion was teaching his art students, which brought him a lot of joy. Throughout this time, he continued to run the family horse and cattle ranch, always taking the time to teach his children and grandchildren the value of hard work.\n\nHe was a fervent supporter of his eight children's numerous activities. Always a sports enthusiast, he imparted this love to his children and grandchildren, coaching many of them along with neighborhood children. Tom took immense pride in his family's talents and achievements and expressed it at every opportunity. Some of Tomâ€™s favorite memories were made spending time with his grandchildren attending their activities or patiently teaching them how to paint and sculpt."
