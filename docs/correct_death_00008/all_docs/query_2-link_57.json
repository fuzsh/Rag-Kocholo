        "text": "As a composer, bandleader and trumpeter Miles Davis is acknowledged as the most important jazz figure of the second half of the 20th century.\n\nBut the Miles Davis legacy is an extraordinary and irresistible one. Jazzmatazz chronicles the life and times of a tortured genius who is acclaimed as one of the greatest jazz innovators.\n\nTo listen to an extract from the programme, please click here\n\nIt’s ten years since the death of trumpeter Miles Davis, the most influential jazz musician of the second half of the 20th century, and the most consistently innovative bandleader in jazz history.\n\nHe made some of the most serene records of all, including the perennial favourites Birth Of The Cool and Kind Of Blue, but he was also one of the most volatile characters in the world of music.\n\nHe died after losing his temper with his doctor during a bout of pneumonia, having been made so angry by the suggestion that he should have a tube fitted to help him breathe, that he suffered a fatal stroke.\n\nBebop\n\nHe grew up in the midwestern town of East St Louis, and during his teens sat alongside jazz legends Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker when they passed through the city with singer Billy Eckstine.\n\nThis had a major impact on the young trumpeter, and only a couple of years later, in 1945, Davis dropped out of the Juilliard School of Music in New York, in order to become a full-time member of Charlie Parker’s own band.\n\nThey played the modern jazz style called bebop in a 52nd Street club, where pianist Sir Charles Thompson and drummer Stan Levey worked alongside Davis and Parker on the crowded bandstand.\n\nBirth of the cool\n\nDespite Parker’s well-known drug habit, Davis remained clean-living, always seeking ways to improve his playing. However, when he left the band, Davis found himself drawn into the world of drugs.\n\nBefore his habit became too entrenched, he produced the legendary Birth Of The Cool recordings, showing the world a new direction in which bebop could develop.\n\nBut then Davis’s career hit the buffers.\n\nNevertheless, he made a few remarkable discs during this period.\n\nIn the mid 1950s, Davis took himself in hand and quit drugs. He was invited as a guest to appear at the 1955 Newport Jazz festival, and he produced the performance of his life with a pick-up band in front of the massive festival crowd.\n\nProducer George Avakian heard him there, and resolved to help the trumpeter restart his career.\n\nThe result was the album Miles Ahead, and a renewed working relationship with Gil Evans that eventually led to the famous discs Sketches Of Spain and Porgy And Bess, where Davis’s beautiful trumpet soars across the sounds of a large studio orchestra.\n\nDavis always had an uneasy relationship with his producers, but Avakian and his successor at the Columbia label, Teo Macero, overcame the temper tantrums, the fights, the rows over money and occasional walkouts, to help create Davis’s greatest albums.\n\nLegendary life-style\n\nOf his outstanding groups of the 1950s and ’60s, first came a marvellous quintet with saxophonist John Coltrane, and then in due course his legendary band with saxophonist Wayne Shorter, pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams.\n\nWith this latter group, he started the exploration of free jazz, and also of jazz rock. He continued these ideas with his subsequent line-up, including bassist Dave Holland, pianist Chick Corea and drummer Jack deJohnette.\n\nOn stage his sleek Italian suits gave way to the scarves and hipsters of the flower power era, a trend which culminated in his appearances at pioneer rock festivals, including the Isle of Wight in Britain.\n\nAs he sought a new audience for his music away from small jazz clubs, he found new ways of making discs, by recording whenever the mood took him, and leaving Macero to assemble the results into finished albums.\n\nPrince of darkness\n\nIn the mid 1970s, Davis withdrew from the public eye. Health problems, and a renewed interest in drugs – this time cocaine – made him retreat into a half-life in his New York house, justifying his nickname the ‘Prince of Darkness’.\n\nTeo Macero vividly remembers this difficult time in Davis’s life, his depression, his retreat into himself, and how he was finally coaxed into an eventual return to playing with his triumphal fusion bands of the 1980s.\n\nAmazingly, the Miles Davis of the 1980s had reinvented himself again. There were still elements of the jazz rock of the 1970s, but now there was a firmer popular beat, and catchy funk themes, which were totally in tune with the times.\n\nWhile many of his colleagues looked backwards, Davis always looked forwards, to the music of Prince and other rock heroes.\n\nNever look back\n\nDavis always said he would never look back – that his old music no longer interested him, but in 1991 he was persuaded to join Quincy Jones for a retrospective concert at Montreux, where he once again performed his great collaborations with Gil Evans.\n\nThe music was not easy. Davis was joined by his protégé, the young trumpeter Wallace Roney, to handle the solo duties, but the concert was a triumph.\n\nIt showed that Davis was still able to produce the haunting, beautiful music of his past as well as the aggressive funk of the present, right up until the end of his life.\n\nHis sudden death aged just 65 shocked the world, but his influence is as strong today as it ever was during his lifetime.\n\nRelated Stories 29 June, 2001\n\nThe Sound of Jazz in Montreal 25 May, 2001\n\nElectric Explorations 24 May, 2001\n\nWynton Marsalis: The Ambassador For Jazz 17 April, 2001\n\nRay Charles: The Father Of Soul 09 March, 2001\n\nCourtney Pine: The Cosmic Dread\n\nInternet Sites Miles Davis official site Miles beyond The sound of Miles Davis The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites"
