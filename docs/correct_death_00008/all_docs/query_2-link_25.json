        "text": "One of Miles Davis’ final live performances took place at France’s Jazz à Vienne festival on July 1, 1991, months before he died in September. Now, a recording of that set is being released for the first time: Merci Miles! Live at Vienne arrives June 25 as part of Rhino’s Black Music Month celebration. It features a selection of the songs performed that night, including Davis and his group’s renditions of Prince’s “Penetration” and “Jailbait.” Find the tracklist below.\n\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
