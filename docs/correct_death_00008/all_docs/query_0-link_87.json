His actual movements are difficult to trace, but between 1816 and 1822 he lived part of the time in Cuba and he undoubtedly learned Spanish and studied dentistry in this time. In 1822 Dr. W. S. Parrott, dentist, went to Mexico. By the time he returned to the United States in August of 1826, he acquired a wife by the name of Adele Parrott. A family story says the first wife of William Stuart Parrott (ie, Adele) died and was buried at sea. This story may or may not be true.

The San Mateo Creek, with numerous Bay trees alongside it, formed the northern boundary of the property. John immediately began remodeling the old Macondray house that was on the property and, by 1868, he had created a Second Empire-style house that he and wife Abby could enjoy in the summer when they ventured down from San Francisco.\n\nJohn Parrott had been the U.S. Consul at Mazatlan, Mexico at the height of the Mexican American War in the 1840s. In this role, he corresponded with important national leaders such as James Buchanan and Daniel Webster, as well as California leaders such as Thomas Larkin.\n\nThese contacts proved valuable later when Parrott moved to San Francisco and started a financial and shipping empire that made him very rich. Commerce and banking became Parrott's life. He built a legendary \"fire proof\" business building at Montgomery and California streets out of granite imported from China. In 1853, he married Abby Eastman Maher in Mobile, Ala. and settled at their home on Rincon Hill in San Francisco.\n\nIn the summers, the Parrotts attended the Catholic Church in San Mateo. They were very conservative people, not the typical big party givers that one associates with the wealthy people on the Peninsula. When in residence there, Parrott often commuted to and from San Francisco by train. The arrival of the train often became a big event in the lives of the locals who would gather on Main Street to observe the comings and goings of the well-to-do.\n\nParrott's family grew to include six daughters and one son. The eldest daughter, Mary Katherine Parrott was married in 1879 to an aristocratic young Frenchman Christian de Guigne. De Guigne was an agent for a French banking firm. After their marriage, they bought the property fronting Third Avenue and El Camino Real that the Husing family had used for their first general store. The Husing store now sat on the corner of B Street and Third Avenue.\n\nThe Ben Franklin Hotel was built on this site in 1927. The de Guignes named the property \"Minne-haha\" after Katherine's nickname \"Minnie.\" De Guigne was the co-founder of the Stauffer Chemical Company and served as president. He also was a partner with C. E. Whitney, John Stauffer, and August H. Schilling when the Leslie Salt Company was formed. After the 1906 earthquake damaged their Catholic Church, the members met in the large stable that the de Guignes had on their property.\n\nDaughter Abby Josephine (\"Daisy\") married Captain A. H. Payson in 1884. Payson became director of the Spring Valley Water Company (now the San Francisco Water Department) after a distinguished career in the Army.\n\nHe had been an Army engineer and taught at West Point for a few years until 1877 when he was transferred to San Francisco. His work included overseeing construction of lighthouses while with the Lighthouse, Rivers and Harbors Department.\n\nHe bought the property in San Mateo south of the de Guignes, facing Fifth Avenue and El Camino Real.\n\nBaywood proper became the residence of son John Jr. who married Mary E. Donohoe. Daughter Grace married attorney Robert Young Hayne in 1881.\n\nThe Haynes lived on today's West Fifth Avenue.\n\nJohn Parrott Sr. died in 1884 at age 74. His wife Abby died in 1917 at age 89. They are buried at St. John's Cemetery.\n\nhttps://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/local/san-mateos-john-parrott-family/article_7d835793-0fbd-5265-b824-8b0b9a781d20.html\n\n==================================\n\nTIBURCIO PARROTT\n\n1840 - 1894\n\nThe Man Who Built Miravalle - Falcon Crest\n\nJourdan George Myers\n\nDeer Park, California 1987\n\n\"Although John Parrott joined William Stuart Parrott in Mexico in 1829, the earliest passport for John was 1711 issued on 5 July 1832. He is described as 22 years of age, Stature 6 feet, Eyes hazel, Nose pug, Mouth large, Chin broad, Hair dark, Complexion fair, and Face round. After working with William Stuart in Mexico City, John started working as a clerk in the mercantile business that William Stuart Parrott and Samuel Talbot established in Mazatlan. Some years later in 1837 John applied to the U.S. Government to be U.S. Consul in Mazatlan. A series of letters in the National Archives, Department of State, Consul Dispatches Mazatlan, 1828-1906 lists the recommendations, qualifications, etc., that John had for the job. It was on 30 December 1837 that John Forsyth wrote John Parrott of his appointment as U.S. Consul in Mazatlan.\n\n\"Besides his consular duties, he also had his mercantile business. In 1838 William Talbot left the firm of Parrott, Talbot and Co. The firm dissolved and John Parrott organized a new mercantile house called Parrott and Co.\n\n\"During the two-year Mexican-American war period John went from Mexico City to Vera Cruz to New Orleans to Havana to Washington, D.C. He was not reappointed to U.S. Consul to Mazatlan until mid-1848.\n\n\"John's resignation as U.S. Consul in Mazatlan was submitted to the department of State on 9 April 1850 and later that same month he left for San Francisco. In the next two years, John bounced back and forth between San Francisco and Guadalajara and paid two visits to Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, in 1851 a fire leveled three of the buildings that he owned in San Francisco; consequently, he decided to build a fireproof granite building.\"\n\nSan Francisco Bulletin dated 31 March 1884 (obituary)\n\n\"The Banker [Mr. Parrott] for a long time had disappeared from Montgomery Street, where his face was once so familiar. His declining years have been spent in the quiet of domestic life. Mr. Parrott was a pioneer of pioneers. He was one of the few Argonauts who brought money with him . . . His bank was one of the strongest institutions in San Francisco. It is withstood all the storms unshaken.\n\n\"Mr. Parrott belonged to a class of conservative bankers. He preferred that his money should remain in his vaults to be loaned out on weak security. There was no amount of interest that could tempt him. Only one case of a loan on doubtful collateral was quoted, and that was on a lot of hams which subsequently spoiled. 'No more hams' was the usual rejoiner when paper not gilt-edged was ever afterwards presented to the veteran financier . . .\"\n\n----\n\n\"In 1845 Captain Andre Castillero formed the New Almaden Company and John Parrott bought on Barra, 1/24th ownership in the mine. By the end of 1861 he had acquired another Barra from James Alexander Forbes. This gave Parrott 1/12th of the ownership, the additional Barra cost Parrott some $34,000. Parrott must have been very proud of the mine as he gave one of his children the middle name of Almaden (Grace Almaden Parrott 1860-1945).\"\n\n----\n\nFrom The Nob Hill Gazette, May 1982, by J. Roger Jobson.\n\nJohn Parrott: Portrait of a Pioneer\n\nBaywood was the name John Parrott chose for his 450-acre San Mateo estate. Amid rolling hills, native oak and bay trees, this wealthy financier and shipping magnate built in 1868 a home for his wife, nine children, as staff of 10, plus gardeners and a dozen or more Chinese laborers.\n\nThe vast reaches of Baywood were once included in the great Rancho de las Pulgas, a Spanish grant to that distinguished branch of the Arguello family which gave two governors to California 'before the Gringo came.'\n\nThe house was a modified Queen Anne Victorian design with finials rising from a balustrade that swept along the length of the second floor. Th unusually symmetrical architecture and the elegant but restrained interior furnishings made an impression as dignified as was the owner himself.\n\nAlthough the family also had an impressive residence in the city, it was at Baywood amid landscaped gardens and surrounded by his children that Parrott, then aged 57, lived out the active and well-ordered routine of his life. This gracious existence was the culmination of 40 years of adventure, work and shrewd investment.\n\nTennessee born, John Parrott at age 18 joined his brother's mercantile and importing business at Mexico City. His passport at that time describes him as 'six feet tall, hazel eyes, large mouth, round face and fair of complexion.' The business was successful and flourished. He was appointed United States Consul at Mazatlan from 1837 to 1846 and reappointed in 1848 until his resignation and move to San Francisco in 1850.\n\nAfter leaving Mexico, but before settling permanently in San Francisco, 42-year-old Parrott traveled to Mobile, Alabama. There he met and married 24-year-old Abby Meaher. Miss Meaher was reluctant to marry at first and so Parrott, reminiscent of his years in Mexico, engaged musicians to serenade her in front of the hotel where she and her family were staying.\n\nIt is true that many of the pioneers to California were men of restricted means and education. Some came to seek their fortune, others to make a fresh start, or in some cases to escape capture and punishment by the law of the land. None of this can be said of Parrott, however, who by 1849 with his California interests well-established from previous visits, arrived in San Francisco with a fortune. He had already proven to be a man of learning and astute business accumen.\n\nWithin a few years, Parrott established a banking exchange to purchase gold dust and bullion that adventurous men were digging from the hills and panning from the Sierra streams. A partner in this adventure was W.B. Comstock, the man whose name lives in the annals of the West as the famed Comstock Lode.\n\nThe mid-nineteenth century on the Pacific Coast was a period of expanding commerce. California, no longer restricted by Spanish and Mexican jurisdictions, began to attract the shipping attention of the world. A notable characteristic of Parrott was his ability to foresee and adapt to the times. Soon sailing vessels owned or chartered by the Parrott Company sailed the trade routes: quicksilver to Hong Kong, wheat to Liverpool, rice and spices from the Orient and coffee from Central and South America.\n\nMeanwhile, John and Abby Parrott's nine children grew, attended school'96 here, in England and in France'96 traveled abroad, married, participated in the social and cultural life of the city, continued their father's business interests and had children of their own.\n\nToday's descendants of the private and conservative Parrotts continue to be a force in the Bay Area where their lives thread through and contribute richly to the tapestry of the city, giving it continuity, color and durability.\n\nWilliam G. Parrott heads the Parrott Estate Company and is a member of the Board of Directors of the Parrott Ranch Company. William and his poised and stately wife Mary have three sons who represent the fifth generation.\n\nA sampling of other fifth generation Parrott descendants are: Joseph A. Donahoe, V, an active and urbane member of the city's cultural and social life, a graduate student in viticulture at the University of California, Davis, and a member of the governing body of the University of San Francisco's annual symposium; Marc de Tristan, Jr., a graduate of Harvard's School of Business, charity fund-raiser and treasurer of the Nob Hill Association; Richard Thieriot, Editor and Publisher of the San Francisco Chronicle, and his brother Christopher, Vice-President of Western Communication, Inc.; Christian de Guigne, IV, a partner with his brother Charles in the Chateau Senejac Vineyards at Haut Medoc in France, part owner of the New York based travel firm, Ports of Call, and a leading authority in antique arms.\n\nIn her definitive biography of her illustrious ancestor, Barbara Donohoe Jostes tells of the death in 1884 at the age of 73 of John Parrott. 'His had been an active life, spanning the years of early trade on the West Coast of Mexico and the Gold Rush. His was the age of sail, the Pony Express, the Overland Mail, the Telegraph, the first steam ships and the building of the Transcontinental Railroad.\n\n'He experienced the devastating fires in the early years of San Francisco, the violent days that brought into being the Vigilantes, and survived the panics in the banking world. Friend of many, exacting himself and others, John Parrott contributed to the advancement of the state and to the city by choice.'\n\n============\n\nJohn lived in Mexico for a number of years before settling in CA.\n\nJohn had 2 illigimate children while living in Mexico, who he later brought to the US. He and Abigal had 8 children.\n\nJohn was a US Consul in Mexico. He became a millionaire, was president of a bank and owned a lot of land. There is a picture of him on the San Francisco Public Library website as well as pictures of his San Mateo mansion.\n\n=================\n\n< >\n\nThe Parrott family of San Francisco are perhaps the most exclusive people in that city. Mr. John Parrott, the head of the house, who has been dead for several years, was a very wealthy banker and lived, during his early life, in Mexico. There he married a beautiful Mexican girl, but in later years, after a family had come to them, it was whispered that there was some flaw in the ceremony which them one. Mr. Parrott was devotedly found, however, of his children and adopted them legally. The daughter of this marriage married a Scotch physician and had three children, two sons and a daughter. When Mr. Parrott married his second wife those children very very fond of calling her grandmamma, but the lady, with a stern determination that they should understand exactly the relationship they occupied toward her, was prone to resent the endearment.\n\n< >\n\nThe Brooklyn Daily Eagle, 01 Dec 1889, p 7\n\n=============\n\nSan Mateo's John Parrott family\n\nMarch 16, 2009, 12:00 AM By Darold Fredricks\n\nBorn in 1811 in Virginia, John Parrott had it all when he purchased the 260-acre Captain Macondray estate west of Ed Taylor's San Mateo House site on El Camino Real for $30,000.\n\nMacondray called his place Brookside, but Parrott changed it to Bayside.

Commerce and banking became Parrott's life. He built a legendary \"fire proof\" business building at Montgomery and California streets out of granite imported from China. In 1853, he married Abby Eastman Maher in Mobile, Ala. and settled at their home on Rincon Hill in San Francisco.\n\nIn the summers, the Parrotts attended the Catholic Church in San Mateo. They were very conservative people, not the typical big party givers that one associates with the wealthy people on the Peninsula. When in residence there, Parrott often commuted to and from San Francisco by train. The arrival of the train often became a big event in the lives of the locals who would gather on Main Street to observe the comings and goings of the well-to-do.\n\nParrott's family grew to include six daughters and one son.\n\n< >\n\nJohn Parrott Sr. died in 1884 at age 74.

Tiburcio came to San Francisco at age twenty-two to live with his father and stepmother.\n\nThe St. Helena Star on 15 May 1885 reports: \"Tiburcio Parrott and Fritz Beringer left Friday morning behind a handsome four-in-hand driven by Judge Elgin for a trip to the Sulphur Bank Mine in which property Mr. Parrott is largely interested . . .\"\n\nDue to the increasing cost of operation and the declining price of quicksilver, the Sulphur Bank Mine declared bankruptcy in 1883. The final footnote of the operation by Tiburcio Parrott is found in an item in the Napa Register of 7 September 1883: \"On the 17th inst. A sale of delinquent stock in Sulphur Bank quicksilver mine of Lake County, will take place in San Francisco at the assessment being twenty-five cents per share. D.O. Mills holds about $4,000 and John Parrott $3,500 worth of the delinquent stock, but the bulk of the stock belongs to Tiburcio Parrott.\"\n\nBuilt Miravalle (used as the setting for Falcon Crest TV series) in 1885.\n\nthe St. Helena Star sate 4 September 1885 describes the house in construction and the property at that time:\n\nSomething less than a year ago, the well-known Forbes place, situated on Spring Mountain, south of the reservoir of the St. Helena Water Works, was purchased by Tiburcio Parrott, a prominent banker of San Francisco, and with the transfer of title commence a system of improvements on this property which has in a few short months changed it almost beyond recognition. Nearly two weeks ago we drove over this fine estate in company with Mr. Parrott, and on every hand our eyes rested on evidences of the wonderful changes accomplished by the well-directed expenditure of abundant means.\n\n===\n\nIn 1885, its very first year, the parrot Winery produced some 8,300 gallons of wine according to \"Vintage of 1885\" report published in the St. Helena Star on 20 November 1885. This was quite a respectable beginning for the winery which was to produce some very fine and famous wines. Leon D. Adams writes in The Wines of America, \"A duplicate of the Rhine House was built by their uphill neighbor, Tiburcio Parrott. Parrott grew grapes for the Beringers on his great estate, which he called 'Miravalle' for it view of the [Napa] valley. He also made his own wines, and the late Almond R.

PARROTT DEAD. ST. HELENA MOURNS THE LOSS OF HER GREATEST FRIEND. His death was unexpected. He entertained with a lavish hand, visitor from California, from all nations and was the friend of the rich and the poor. The people of St. Helena were shocking Monday morning upon hearing that Tiburcio Parrott had passed away.\n\nAlthough Mr. Parrott had been in ill health for several months, and for the past two years had been troubled at times with pains in the pit of his stomach, no one dreamed of his being in any immediate danger of death. Sunday night he was taken for worse and rapidly failed, dying at 7:05 the next morning [5 November 1894], the cause being cancer of the stomach. . . Since his marriage Villa Parrott was been open to all comers.

HELENA HOME.\n\nA Prince of Good Fellows Is No More.\n\nGENEROUS EVEN TO A FAULT.\n\nDeath Visits When Least Expected at the Chateau de Mira-Valle in Napa County.\n\nTiburcio Parrott died rather suddenly yesterday morning at the Chateau de Mira-Valle, his country home near St. Helena. The news of his death was conveyed to his family in this city by telegraph, which simply stated that he died.\n\nAbout a month ago Mr. Parrott began to complain of pains and trouble in his digestive organs, but as no alarming symptoms showed themselves little attention was given the disorder. \"It is only an attack of indigestion,\" he would say, and then relying on a splendid constitution to carry him through he neglected to undergo treatment. Shortly before midnight Sunday he was taken suddenly with pains in the stomach. The pain grew into agony with great rapidity, and very soon the sick man was completely prostrated. He lived but a few hours, as the end came early in the morning.\n\nMrs. Parrott was at his bedside at the time. Mrs. A.M. Parrott, stepmother of the deceased, went to St. Helena on the first train yesterday, before the dispatch announcing Mr. Parrott.s unexpected taking off was received in this city.\n\nMr. Parrott was about 54 years of age. He was the son of the late John Parrott, the pioneer banker, who for many years was a leading man in the mercantile community. Tiburcio was born in Mexico, and when of an age to leave home he went to school at Jamaica Plains, near Boston. In later years he finished his education in Europe, where he acquired knowledge of French and Italian in addition to Spanish and English, in which he was already well read.\n\nReturning to America, he was placed in a position in the firm of William T. Coleman & Co. in New York. This was in 1860. Young Parrott did not make much of a success as a sedate clerk, being of a restless dispostion and rather inclined to enjoying the good things of life. So he was brought by his father in 1862 to San Francisco.\n\nImmediately on his arrival here went into his father's banking-house, then conducted as Parrott & Co.\n\nLater on he withdrew from that firm and formed the house of Alson & Co., together with the late William F. Babcock, about 1864. For six years he was a member of the Alsop & Co., but in December, 1869, the firm merged its business into that of Parrott & Co., which is still in existence, although Tiburcio Parrott had no interest in it for ten years past.\n\nShortly after the death of his father, John Parrott, Tiburcio withdrew from city life and took up his residence at Chateu de Mira-Valle in Napa County. And for a decade now the bons vivants missed his genial company. Meanwhile he was engrossed in producing high-grade wine which became a fad of his. He studied works on wine-making and improved his knowledge and skill in the alluring industry, so that it is said of him he could indentify wine from from almost every vineyard in California by smell or taste.\n\nAbour five years ago Mr. Parrott married Miss Tuffy of Carson City, Nev., whose father has been a prominent man in Nevada. There was no issue of this union.\n\nIn his younger days Tiburcio Parrott was noted for his profuse liberality and generosity. To a fault, his friends declare, he was generous. And though he retired to his ranch for a quiet life none of this characteristic forsook him, for the Parrott house was widely known though its princely host. This is brought out very vividly in the deciatory verse of a book by Adolphe Flamant to Mr. Parrott as follows:\n\nUn bon garÃ§on permi les princes,\n\nEt le prince des bons garÃ§ons.\n\nA good fellow among princes, and a prince of good fellows.\n\nIndeed it is said of him that he spnt over a million in the very abandon of hospitality and pleasures with his friends.\n\nTruly he lost fortunes in mining speculations. The Herman mine cost him an immense sum of money, and he also lost on his Guerneville quicksilver mines. These reverses, with extravagance in entertaining Bohemian friends and in social channels, reduced his wealth given him by his father to a comparatively nominal amount.\n\nTo his liberal patronage Tojetil, the painter, was deeply indebted. Mr. Parrott was a patron of art, as local artists attest. It was he who sent Toby Rosenthall to Munich, there to be educated in painting. While Rosenthal was in Munich Parrott ordered him to paint Elaine, a picture which has since become famous. The artist produced the picture, but Mrs. Johnson saw it in Munich and became its owner. It would have been Parrott's, only the painter raised the price over that already accepted, and his patron was so annoyed he fell out with Rosenthal. Tavernier and others of the old-time San Francisco artists looked upon Parrott as a benefactor.\n\nCancer of the stomach was the cause of Mr. Parrott's death.\n\nNo arrangements have as yet been made for the funeral.\n\nThe San Francisco Call, 6 Nov. 1894, p 12\n\n==========================================\n\nNothing remains of Parrott City, in fact, the site is on private property and even its exact location has been difficult to determine. Not even aerial photographs show foundations for of a town of approximately 50 structures. Obscure or not, this town was once the La Plata County seat and had its own newspaper and post office.\n\nAlthough historical accounts vary on the dates, Capt. John Moss and C.D. Posten explored the La Plata River area and found placer gold in the stream beds.\n\nMoss was from San Francisco, and at the time, he was around 45 years old. He had a slender, wiry build with long hair falling over his shoulders. Historians seriously doubt he held the rank of captain and believe the title was honorary.\n\nMoss returned with a group of fellow Californians in 1873. Realizing that he was trespassing on Ute Indian land, he made his own treaty with Chief Ignacio. The Indians granted the prospectors the right to mine and farm on a 36-square-mile section of land. In exchange, the prospectors gave the Indians blankets and 100 ponies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoss returned to his San Francisco home with the signed treaty and specimens of gold-bearing quartz. He showed them to a banker, Tibercio (also spelled Tiburcio) Parrott.\n\nA mining company was formed, and Parrott provided funds for Moss to continue exploration in the La Plata River area. In exchange, Moss named the small camp he had established Parrott City.\n\nIn 1873, the Ute Indians signed a formal treaty with the U.S. government relinquishing their rights on the San Juan Mountains, including the La Plata River drainage.\n\nThe Parrott City site is void of any original structures and is located southwest of Mayday. Modern homes occupy much of the site.\n\nThe Parrott City site is void of any original structures and is located southwest of Mayday. Modern homes occupy much of the site. (Map drawn by Kenneth Jessen)\n\nIn 1876, using equipment hauled in by wagon, the first sawmill began operation. At this time, about 50 people lived in Parrott City.\n\nAs milled lumber became available, two stores, a hotel and a number of shanties were constructed. Parrott City got its own post office in 1876 under the name \"Parrott.\"\n\nThe post office closed in 1885, then reopened two years later and remained active until 1898.\n\nOne visitor described Parrott City's residents as engaged in continuous celebration. Whiskey allegedly was carried around in a water bucket. Everyone in town was invited to take a dip in much the same manner as water is delivered to field hands.\n\nJohn Moss kept a large barrel of whisky in his office. It sat on its side and was tapped with a faucet. Tin dippers hung on the wall behind the barrel, and every visitor was invited to take a dipperful. No restrictions were placed on how many times during the day a visitor might call.\n\nIn 1876, the same year Colorado became a state, an election was held to establish a county seat in La Plata County.\n\nMoss rounded up his men to cast their votes for Parrott City. Parrott City won and remained the La Plata County seat until 1881 when it was moved to Durango.\n\nJohn Moss set a record as a state legislator by never attending single session.\n\nBy 1885, Parrott City had grown to 250, and more than 500 claims had been filed in the area. Out of these, only 20 were being mined.\n\nSome coal was mined nearby, and ranching and farming supported the town's economy. A mining engineer predicted placer mining at Parrott City would soon end after the removal of the surface gravel.\n\nLarge boulders, buried deep below the surface, limited placer mining. Tibercio Parrott read a report with these details and withdrew his financial support.\n\nParrott City died, and Moss returned to San Francisco.\n\nAs Parrott City declined, one old-timer and the postmaster were all that remained. Over the years, the buildings were razed, and the place became a cattle ranch.\n\nGhost town historian Muriel Sibell Wolle stated that most of structures were torn down in the 1940s and that the Barbee Hotel was the last structure at the site. It burned to the ground after being struck by lightning in 1963.\n\nKenneth Jessen has lived in Loveland since 1965 and has contributed to area newspapers for more than four decades. He has written more than 2,000 illustrated articles published along with 20 books. Jessen is in his third year teaching adult education at Colorado State University (OSHER program) and has lectured in Northern Colorado.\n\n05/19/2018\n\nhttp://www.reporterherald.com/columnists/colorado-history/ci_31880332/la-plata-county-seat-at-parrott-city-vanished\n\nTiburcio married Theresa F.

Although timely arrival of the San Mateo fire department enabled the firemen to bring the blaze under control, the beautiful old manssion, built in 1860, was damaged beyond the point of repair.\n\nIn recent months the old house has been preserved by the Baywood Park Company as an attractive landmark in conjunction with the subdivision of the big Parrott estate of 375 acres. A caretaker and his family resided in the rear part of the home, but there was no one in the hosue at 2 o'clock yesterday morning when the flames were discovered. The caretaker's family is now vacationing in Monterey and the man himself spent Saturday night in San Francisco. Considerable property belonging to the family was destroyed or badly damaged.\n\nIt is believed that the fire was started by defective wiring. The wood in the house was so seasoned that the slightest spark could have started the blaze. The theory that it was of incendiary origin was broken down when firemen found all doors and windows in place securely locked, just as they hada been left by the caretaker when he departed on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe old Parrott home was for years a show, placed of the peninsula. It was built 68 years ago by the late John and Abby Parrott, and for nearly 25 years was the center of social activity in the bay region. In recent years it was unoccupied, except by the caretaker. Only a short time ago the former servants' quarters went up in smoke, that fire having been started apparently by tramps who slept in the place. Several years ago the old stables and barns went up in smoke, destroying many carriages and vehicles of ancient vintage.\n\nJohn Williams, president of the Baywood Part Company, today expressed regret that the old place had burned.\n\n\"We had preserved the old Parrott mansion as a relic of former days and it blended well with the aristochratic layout of Baywood Park,\" said Wililams. \"Recently we used it for a builders' exhibit and everyone who entered the place was impressed with its stately appearance.\"\n\nSan MateoTimes, 06 Aug 1928, p 1\n\nNotes: DEATH SUMMONS ABBY M.

Polk Johnson, Wednesday, as we learn that the President commuted the sentence of John W. Parrott, under sentence of death in Arkansas for murder. In his order the President says: \"I am not quite willing to pardon absolutely this convict, after his conviction of murder and after a denial of a motion for a new trial, based substantially upon all the papers now before me. I am entirely satisfied that he ought not to suffer the extreme penalty of the law, but I do not think that when he killed the Elder McAdams he was so 'driven to the wall' by the attack of his assailant as to clearly excuse the taking of life. I do not think the convict invited the attack, but in considering the application for his pardon I can not overlook the fact that he armed himself and went to the place where the man was who had threatened to kill him before night. In the belief that the prisoner should be punished for the part he took in this homicide and that he is guilty of a crime much less than murder, I have determined to commute his sentence to imprisonment at hard labor for the term of five years.\" Parrott was formerly of this county and is a brother of Mrs. Peter Hamton, who was almost driven crazy by suspense.\n\nInterior Journal, Stanford KY, 7 Jan 1887, p 3\n\n=================\n\n-- Mr. Peyton Parrott, a brother of John W.
