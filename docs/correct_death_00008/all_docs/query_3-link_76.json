        "text": "Miles Davis fans should definitely drop the needle on “Merci Miles! Live at Vienne,” a stunning, newly released concert set from the jazz legend’s final tour.\n\nThe recording is from July 1, 1991 at the Jazz à Vienne festival in France, where the trumpeter/bandleader led his terrific Miles Davis Group — featuring saxophonist Kenny Garrett, keyboardist Deron Johnson, bassists Richard Patterson and Foley and drummer Ricky Wellman — through a memorable night of music.\n\nIt would be one of Davis’ last concerts. The acclaimed musician died just a few months later — on Sept. 28, 1991.\n\n“Merci Miles! Live at Vienne” is available as a double-LP for $31.98 and as a two-CD set for $24.98 through rhino.com and milesdavis.com. It’s also available for digital download and streaming through Amazon and other retailers.\n\nThe track list includes two Prince numbers — “Penetration” and “Jailbait” — as well as covers of “Time After Time” and Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature.” (The latter takes up the entire Side A of the second LP in the two-record set.)\n\nThe music is accompanied by liner notes by music historian/author Ashley Kahn.\n\nHere’s the complete track listing:\n\n“Hannibal”\n\n“Human Nature”\n\n“Time After Time”\n\n“Penetration”\n\n“Wrinkle”\n\n“Amandla”\n\n“Jailbait”\n\nUntitled finale – the Miles Davis Group only"
