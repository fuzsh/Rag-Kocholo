        "text": "(1926–91). The most important jazz bandleader after World War II was Miles Davis. Outstanding among trumpet soloists, he led many small ensembles, including three that were the original sources of major jazz idioms: cool jazz, modal jazz, and fusion.\n\nBorn in Alton, Ill., on May 25, 1926, Miles Dewey Davis III grew up in East St. Louis, Ill. His father, a prominent dentist and landowner, gave him a trumpet for his 13th birthday, and soon he was playing in local jazz bands. His father, delighted with his talent and determination, sent him to study at what is now the Juilliard School in New York City. Instead of attending classes, he joined Charlie Parker’s quintet, developed a simplified bop trumpet style, and performed on many of Parker’s greatest recordings. In 1948 Davis formed a nine-piece band to play a new kind of jazz that featured low, muted tone colors. This band, though never commercially successful, was the beginning of cool jazz, which became widespread during the 1950s.\n\nBy that time, however, Davis had abandoned cool jazz and was playing a more blues-influenced music, as in his solos on the albums Bags Groove and Walkin’. He performed with his quintet, which often included tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, and with Gil Evans’ big band. Davis began to create music based on the modes, or scales, used by ancient Greek musicians, instead of traditional keys and harmonic patterns. Kind of Blue by his sextet in 1959 was the first major modal jazz recording, beginning a trend that remained popular among jazz musicians for the next 10 years.\n\nDavis’ jazz quintets of the 1960s, which usually included drummer Tony Williams and tenor saxophonist Wayne Shorter, progressed steadily toward greater harmonic and rhythmic freedom. In 1969 Davis adopted a new approach that combined elements of rock music with jazz, resulting in fusion music. This featured several rhythms played at the same time. His fusion music recordings brought him to the height of his popularity, but in 1975, following a series of severe leg and hip injuries, he retired from performing. He began playing concerts again in 1980, resuming an active touring schedule. He died on Sept. 28, 1991, in Santa Monica, Calif.\n\nJohn Litweiler"
