        "text": "Apartment in Miles Davis’ Old Upper West Side Townhouse Asks $495K\n\nBy Annie Doge\n\nJazz legend Miles Davis lived in the Renaissance Revival brownstone at 312 West 77th Street from roughly 1960 until he moved to LA in the mid '80s. He often hung out on the stoop with his Upper West Side neighbors and hosted other jazz greats such as Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, and Tony Williams. It was also in this house that he wrote the music for his albums \"Kind of Blue\" and \"Bitches Brew.\" After he moved out, the five-story home was chopped up into six apartments. One of these units, a charming one-bedroom, has hit the market for $495,000, reports DNAinfo.\n\nSee more of the apartment\n\nAnnie Leibovitz sells UWS home for $2M over asking price\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nAnnie Leibovitz has sold her Upper West Side co-op for nearly 24 percent over the asking price. The duplex, located in the star-studded Brentmore building at 88 Central Park West, fetched $10,625,000, roughly $2,000,000 more than what it listed for in October. But the sale was still a loss for Leibovitz, who paid about $11,250,000 for the home in 2014. The Brentmore is known for its high-profile residents, including Robert DeNiro, Paul Simon, and Sting. Kim Cooper, a general counsel at Apple, and Gregg Zehr, the creator of the Kindle, are listed as buyers of the residence, as Curbed first reported.\n\nlearn more\n\nAnnie Leibovitz lists her Central Park West home for $8.6M\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nCelebrated photographer Annie Leibovitz has listed her home in the Brentmore co-op at 88 Central Park West for $8.6 million. As 6sqft previously reported, Leibovitz purchased the \"classic-seven\" co-op in 2014 for $11.25 million in a building known for celebrity residents like Robert DeNiro, Paul Simon, and Sting. Leibovitz, whose iconic images feature luminaries from John Lennon and Yoko Ono to Mick Jagger and Demi Moore, thoroughly renovated the Upper West Side co-op, her Manhattan home base in the ensuing years. As the New York Times reports, she also owns a home in the West Village as well as a family home in Rhinebeck, NY.\n\nGet a closer look\n\nThree modern penthouses added to Upper West Side’s historic Astor building\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nThree new modern penthouses are being added atop The Astor, a landmarked residential building on the Upper West Side built over 100 years ago. The brand-new apartments top one of New York City's most iconic condominiums, which consists of three interconnected towers on Broadway between West 75th and West 76th Streets. All three penthouses come with private outdoor areas, gas fireplaces, and interiors designed by Pembrooke & Ives. Before being listed publicly, one of the penthouses already found a buyer, who purchased a 3,400 square foot four-bedroom, four-and-a-half bathroom, and a three-bedroom unit below it, in a combo deal last listed for $15.495 million.\n\nSee more here\n\nEl Dorado childhood home of Beastie Boys’ Mike D finds a buyer after $4.5M price chop\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nThe childhood home of Beastie Boys rapper Mike D has found a buyer, after a year on the market and a $4.5 million price cut. The apartment at the Upper West Side's enviable El Dorado building belonged to the estate of Hester and Harold Diamond, owners of one of the world’s finest art collections and parents of Mike Diamond. The duplex co-op hit the market in May 2022 for $19,500,000 and relisted this past March for $14,995,000 before entering contract on Tuesday, as first reported by the New York Post.\n\nDetails here\n\nPeter Jennings’ classic nine on Central Park West asks $10.45M\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nCurrently owned by Kayce Freed Jennings, wife of the late \"ABC World News Tonight\" anchor Peter Jennings, this Upper West Side co-op is a three-bedroom classic nine–and a true classic. Asking $10,450,000, the sprawling home at 101 Central Park West overlooks the park–just one of its many covetable attributes mentioned in a recent Wall Street Journal description of the elegant pre-war home, modernized for 21st century living.\n\nTour this iconic Upper West Side home\n\nFor $6.5M, this townhouse-sized Apthorp condo offers old-world elegance accented by paintbox hues\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nKnown for some of the most impressive (and expensive) apartments in New York City, the historic Apthorp condominium building at 390 West End Avenue in the heart of the Upper West Side was built for William Waldorf Astor in 1908. Located just minutes from Central Park, the unique building surrounds an interior courtyard. Asking $6,499,999, this five-bedroom residence is one of the building's largest; distinguished by decorator-enhanced interiors accented with subtle painterly hues, the 4,200-square-foot home possesses the size and grandeur of a townhouse with condo convenience and amenities.\n\nFeast your eyes on this regal residence\n\nFormer UWS home of jazz legend Billie Holiday asks $14M\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nThe Upper West Side townhouse where legendary jazz singer Billie Holiday lived until her untimely death in 1959 is for sale. Located a block from Central Park at 26 West 87th Street, the historic Renaissance Revival-style brownstone measures over 6,300 square feet and has seven bedrooms and a rear garden. The home, which sold for $9,475,000 in 2017, is now on the market for $13,995,000 following a renovation by architect Amie Sachs, previously of Annabelle Selldorf Architects.\n\nMore this way\n\nJanet Jackson sells her Central Park West home for $8.8M\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nJanet Jackson sold her Upper West Side apartment for $8,800,000 last month, slightly below the initial asking price. As the Wall Street Journal first reported, the pop star's three-bedroom condo in the Trump International Hotel and Tower at 1 Central Park West hit the market in April for $8,995,000. Jackson has owned the home since 1998 but has not lived there since the pandemic.\n\nGet the details\n\nFor $7.5M, a two-condo combo means house-sized space and twice the high-floor views\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nNear the top of the sleek glass tower at 10 West End Avenue, this 3,383-square-foot condominium residence shares the floor with only one other apartment. The two-unit combination means there are two distinct wings–and two full kitchens–within its sprawling footprint, with a four-bedroom (with room for more) configuration that's perfect for entertaining while maintaining private living quarters. Glass-wrapped rooms with three exposures mean panoramic views of the Hudson River, the George Washington Bridge, and the Empire State Building through floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\nSee more of this sprawling glass-clad pad\n\nSpend the summer entertaining outdoors on the terrace at this $9.2M Upper West Side condo\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nPre-war apartments with their high ceilings and gracious proportions rarely come in condo form, so this 3,200-square-foot condominium residence in The Olcott at 27 West 72nd Street is something of a find to start with. In addition to three-convertible-to-four bedrooms, the Upper West Side home, asking $9,200,000, has plenty of indoor entertaining space. But the best thing about it might be the sprawling terrace that's the size of a townhouse garden–all in a full-service building on a Central Park block.\n\nPrivate outdoor living, this way\n\nFor $13.5M, live among the stars, oligarchs, and moguls at 15 Central Park West\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nWhen an apartment at the iconic Robert A.M. Stern-designed 15 Central Park West hits the market, a certain kind of discerning buyer takes notice. There's a mansion-sized 8,000-square-foot combo unit available in the coveted building for $58,000,000, so this available half-floor two-bedroom residence seems like a downright steal at $13,450,000. With interiors designed by Axel Vervoordt, the 26th-floor unit spans 2,367 square feet, with the building's signature high ceilings and, best of all, views that sweep out over Central Park, the Hudson River, and beyond.\n\nGet a closer look"
