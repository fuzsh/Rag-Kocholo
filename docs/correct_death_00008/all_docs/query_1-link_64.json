        "text": "Saxophonist Steve Grossman has died 69 years old. He burst on the scene in 1970 when he as a teenager replaced Wayne Shorter in the Miles Davis band.\n\nSaxophonist Steve Grossman has died 69 years old in New York City. The cause of death was cardiac arrest following a long illnes. Grossman who was born in New York City in 1951 also lived abroad in Italy and France for several years starting in the 1980s.\n\nGrossman started to play the saxophone at an early age and was already playing professionally in his teens. But nothing could have prepared him for taking the saxophone spot in Miles Davis’ band in 1970 when Wayne Shorter left. Suddenly Grossman was at the center of the jazz world with Miles Davis who at the time was reshaping his music from traditional jazz into rock and funk.\n\nGrossman only stayed with Davis for a couple of months but during that short period he made several live and studio recordings with Davis which was released the following years. Among them are Miles Davis at Fillmore (1970), Jack Johnson (1971), Black Beauty (1973), and Big Fun (1974).\n\nWhen Grossman turned Miles Davis down\n\nInterviewed about the experience ten years ago he said that he did not know what to play during his time with Davis, and that he did not feel comfortable playing with the experimental rhythm section of pianist Chick Corea and bassist Dave Holland:\n\n– For Miles they played time, but as soon as he stopped the music would turn into chaos. The only thing I enjoyed was playing duets on the tenor saxophone with drummer Jack DeJohnette. So, Miles decided to make some changes in the band. Soon after I got hired by drummer Elvin Jones. Later Davis asked me to rejoin his band, but I decided to stay with Elvin.\n\nAnother reason for Grossman not wanting to return may have been that he was heavily edited on the recordings he did with Davis, leaving only small sections of his solos. he was also heavily influenced by saxophonist John Coltrane and had a better oppurtunity to explore that way of playing with Coltrane’s former drummer Elvin Jones.\n\nFusion\n\nGrossman stayed with Jones for several years playing in a band with fellow saxophonist Dave Liebman who too would be hired by Miles Davis. In a post on Facebook Dave Liebman writes about his friend and collegue: “Someone jokingly commented that Liebman-Grossman sounded like a law firm! For sure we were tight in the early 70s. We had a lot of fun together, especially in Elvin’s group with the addition of bassist Gene Perla. The Live At The Lighthouse recording remains as a testament to Steve and myself reaching forth. Talking raw talent, that was Steve Grossman to the tee!”\n\nGrossman was also one of the old band members from Miles Davis’ career invited to join Davis on stage in Paris in 1991. Grossman joined Davis with pianist Chick Corea and bassist Dave Holland on a version of Davis’ “All Blues”. This time the rhythm section played time.\n\nListen to a playlist of Steve Grossman with McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones and Miles Davis, playing his original compositions and songs by John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk:\n\nFrom the mid-1970s Grossman recorded and performed as a leader on fusion albums like Some Shapes to Come (1974) and Terra Firma (1977) which were recorded by a group with keyboardist Jan Hammer who had played with guitarist John McLaughlin’s early Mahavishnu Orchestra, bassist Gene Perla, and drummer Don Alias who also had recorded with Miles Davis and Elvin Jones. The albums combine Grossman’s strong influences from saxophonist John Coltrane with the current fusion sounds.\n\nHe also formed the trio Stone Alliance with Perla and Alias recording several albums with them. On their first album Stone Alliance (1976) Grossman and Alias can be heard playing a tenor saxophone and drums duet much in the tradition from Coltrane and Elvin Jones.\n\nGrossman in music history\n\nGrossman was one of many jazz musicians who went back to playing acoustic in the 1980s as on the two volume set Way Out East (1984) with a trio with bassist Juini Both and drummer Joe Chambers. Grossman also played songs written by or associated with Charlie Parker, Miles Davis and John Coltrane in the 1950s on these albums. The title refers to saxophonist Sonny Rollins classic album Way Out West from 1957 which established the saxophone trio with bass and drums accompaniment.\n\nAlbums like Do It (1991) with pianist Barry Harris and drummer Art Taylor, In New York (1992) with pianist McCoy Tyner, A Small Hotel (1993) with pianist Cedar Walton and drummer Billy Higgins, and Steve Grossman with Michel Petrucciani (1998) are all beautiful hard bop records where Grossman explores the music associated with Charlie Parker, John Coltrane and others. Grossman displays an interest in ballads and melody on these records not always heard when he played with Miles Davis and Elvin Jones in his youth.\n\nGrossman has not been that active the last decade of his life. Even if his tenure with Davis was short-lived and Grossman was young at the time, it is such an important period in Davis’ music that it will grant Grossman a place in music history, and many of his solos has been restored on the expanded boxed sets which has been released in recent years, making it easier to understand his contribution."
