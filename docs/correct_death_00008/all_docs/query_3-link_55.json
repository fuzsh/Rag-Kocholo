        "text": "Doak Davis died on June 22, 2024, in Peoria, Illinois, surrounded by family, friends, and his partner, Melissa Vollbracht. In January 2022, Doak was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, or ALS, and was given one year to live. Had he stayed in Bozeman, Montana, his ashes would have been spread on the western slope of the Bridger Mountains overlooking his home. He moved back to Warren County in the spring of 2023 and will have a final resting place under the pine trees in Silent Home Cemetery outside of Cameron, IL.\n\nDoak was born in Effingham, IL on January 9, 1957, to Dolores (Reed) Davis and Coach Harold “Bud” Davis, the second of five children. He was raised in western Illinois in Warren County. At Warren High School, he played football and basketball. He was a hard-nosed running back and a sharp-eyed point guard.\n\nAfter high school, Doak worked for Joe Leary construction for over a year, then spent 1977 traveling back and forth across the United States - hitchhiking and driving from Key West, FL to Bonners Ferry, ID to Los Angeles, CA to Hattiesburg, MS, and beyond. During his expedition, he built a cabin in the northern Rockies on a tributary of the Kootenai River in Idaho. He also studied at the Strasburg Institute in Los Angeles and worked at a pizza parlor on Hollywood Boulevard. Doak saw his high school teammate, Terry Lovedahl, lead Southern Mississippi University to victory on the baseball diamond. During that year, Doak hitchhiked over 10,000 miles.\n\nIn 1978, Doak returned to Warren County and worked for Rich Britt construction, while attending night school at Carl Sandburg College. He lived with his friends, Ron Standard, Marc Hanson, and Todd Sprout in an old farmhouse they nicknamed \"Graceland.\"\n\nIn 1979, Doak attended Illinois State University in Normal, IL and roomed with Bob Standard. There, he studied Communications while bartending, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1982. After college, Doak worked for General Electric Cablevision in Peoria, IL, producing local commercials and community programming.\n\nIn 1984, Doak moved to Austin, TX, working for Austin Cablevision, producing local commercials, public affairs programming, and educational materials. During his time in Austin, he freelanced at the LBJ Presidential Library and Austin City Limits/Texas Music Network, as both producer and director. He won a Clio and an Ace award.\n\nDoak left Texas in 1988, traveling to Florida, where he reunited with ISU friends and worked for the Ryder Corporation, just outside of Miami, in television production. In short order, Doak decided it was far too hot to remain in southern Florida. In May of 1988, Doak traveled back again to Warren County, the place he always considered home, staying long enough to build a log cabin before moving to Minneapolis, MN where he quickly found work in the news department of KMSP-TV as a producer/photographer. He also worked in the TV studio of American Express Financial, producing and directing training materials and live satellite broadcasts.\n\nIn 1991, Doak became the executive producer of audio-visual for Carlson Marketing Group.\n\n“In 1994, Doak ran with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, and then trekked across the Pyrenees Mountains into France. Eventually, he made his way east to the Himalayas, crossing into Nepal to commune at a monastery of Buddhist monks, where he achieved total consciousness. Doak moved north to Mongolia, and briefly rode with the tribal horsemen of the Steppe. He ultimately picked his way across Asia and stole a ride on a Burmese Trawler, fishing for the elusive Aardo Tuna which took him to the coast of Chile. He then followed the ancient route of the Inca warriors, which led him north into Mexico and eventually back into the United States, where he returned to Minnesota and his television production career.” (Per Doak, sometimes a teller of tall tales.)\n\nIn 1995, Doak started a video production company with his friend and business partner, Shelli-Kae Foster. Over the next 14 years, Doak and Shelli-Kae produced more than 500 educational, training, and marketing videos, winning numerous national awards, while working with national clients.\n\nIn 2009, Doak moved to Bozeman, MT, along with his two Australian Cattle dogs Jimmy and Lyle, and built his rustic home in the mountains, which he called \"the Lazy D.\" A few years later, he began work as a carpenter and handyman, enjoying life in the west, while exploring the vast wilderness and contemplating the origins of the universe. Doak indulged himself in many pursuits through the years. He was a writer, producer/director, artist, musician, carpenter, and accomplished storyteller. His last years in Montana were shared with his dogs, Ejai, Suki, Butch, Red Ray, and Jimmy the II. His friends and neighbors were instrumental in allowing him to stay in his home as long as he did.\n\nDoak was preceded in death by his parents, his good friend Preston Haar, and his four Australian Cattle dogs - Ray, Jack, Jimmy, and Lyle. He is survived by his four sisters – Gayla (Paul) Betts, Suzanne (Randy) DeSutter, Kimberly Juraco, Christine (Greg) Handy, plus one aunt, and numerous cousins, nieces, and nephews. In the fall of 2022, Doak lived in Iowa for a brief period before returning home – once again – to Warren County in the spring of 2023, where he ultimately moved into a home with Melissa in Monmouth and fought to beat ALS with alternative approaches. They built a happy time together as Doak was able to reconnect with many friends and regale Melissa with his countless tales. Their door was always open. Though Doak never married or had children, he had enduring friendships that he made over the years. Doak often expressed his appreciation and gratitude for the many friends and family who helped him during his final years. He was eternally thankful for the help he received during his hard-fought battle. Doak considered the friends he’d made around the country the most valuable part of his life, along with Melissa and his family. He relished sharing love and laughter.\n\nThrough it all, Doak remained upbeat and hopeful – a brave fighter to the end. He felt he had gotten his money's worth out of this life. He believed if his fate was written in the stars long ago, so be it. He lived his life as a free man and left this world with no regrets.\n\nFuneral services will be 11:00 a.m., Saturday, June 29, 2024, at McGuire & Davies Funeral Home and Crematory, Monmouth. Interment will be at Silent Home Cemetery, Cameron, IL. Friends may call Saturday morning at the funeral home where the family will be present from 9:30-11:00 am. Memorials may be given to Western Illinois Animal Rescue and sent to the funeral home. For more information or to leave an online condolence please visit, www.mcguireanddaviesfuneralhome.com."
