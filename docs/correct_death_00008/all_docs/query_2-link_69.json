        "text": "Betty Davis, the funk music trailblazer and ex-wife of jazz legend Miles Davis, passed away on Wednesday at age 77.\n\nDavis died of natural causes in her hometown of Homestead, Pennsylvania, according to her close friend and ethnomusicologist Danielle Maggio and Allegheny County Communications Director Amie Downs who spoke with Rolling Stone. Davis's longtime friend Connie Portis said in a statement to the outlet, “It is with great sadness that I share the news of the passing of Betty Davis, a multi-talented music influencer and pioneer rock star, singer, songwriter, and fashion icon. Most of all, Betty was a friend, aunt, niece, and beloved member of her community of Homestead, Pennsylvania, and of the worldwide community of friends and fans.” She added, “At a time to be announced, we will pay tribute to her beautiful, bold, and brash persona. Today we cherish her memory as the sweet, thoughtful, and reflective person she was…There is no other.”\n\nDavis was born in North Carolina and grew up in Pennsylvania before moving to New York City to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology. After graduating, she had a successful career as a model. She began her music career writing songs that helped The Commodores get signed to Motown and penned The Chambers Brothers' 1967 hit “Uptown (to Harlem).” She went on to release five solo albums, mostly recorded between 1964 and 1975, that have gone on to influence music to this day. She was known for lyrics that promoted sexual liberation and performances that would serve as inspiration for future icons like Madonna and Prince. Her work has also been sampled by rappers such as Ice Cube and Talib Kweli. In 1968, Davis became the second wife of Miles Davis and appeared on the cover of his album Filles de Kilimanjaro. They divorced the following year, but she is credited with introducing him to rock and ushering in his more experimental era. Following this period, Davis abruptly quit music, moving back to the Pittsburgh area where she lived for the next 40 years.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with the New York Times, she said, “I wrote about love, really, and all the levels of love. When I was writing about it, nobody was writing about it. But now everybody's writing about it.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
