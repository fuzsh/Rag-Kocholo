Regarding the Dec. 12 article, “A big move on the radio dial”: It’s great news that our beloved classical music station WCLV-FM soon will be moving to 90.3 FM for much-improved reception. But it’s not necessarily the case that there will be “no losers” from Ideastream’s frequency switches. At present, neither 89.7 FM (current home of WKSU-FM) nor 104.9 FM (where WCLV is now) -- the two frequencies to which the merged WKSU-WCPN/National Public Radio is moving -- delivers consistent, quality reception on Cleveland’s East Side. While 89.7′s signal is a bit stronger than 104.9′s in this part of town, both are weak here. On several recent occasions while tuned to 89.7 FM in our University Circle home, WKSU’s usually staticky signal vanished, momentarily overpowered by a Pennsylvania rock-format station.

NPR listeners are going to be unhappy if Ideastream implements frequency switches without first taking effective action to improve reception on 89.7 or 104.9, or both.
