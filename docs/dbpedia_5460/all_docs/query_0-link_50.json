Warren Circuit Judge Chris Cohron ruled Aug. 16 that WKU must turn over “minimally redacted” records related to sexual misconduct investigations involving employees.\n\nOrganizers for the 120th Kentucky State Fair have themed this year’s event around celebrating all 120 counties. A local data expert shares how people move in and around those counties, and if he thinks that number could change.\n\nAt a roll call vote at the Democratic National Convention, Kentucky Democrats failed to acknowledge all of the votes cast by delegates — leaving out the three who lodged a protest vote against Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nKentucky Public Radio analyzed years of state fair entries. It turns out the most popular baking contest is the classic chocolate chip cookie. So what does it take to bake the perfect cookie?\n\nKentucky’s individual income tax rate will lower from 4% to 3.5% in 2026, as the final budget numbers from the 2024 fiscal year met the conditions for a tax cut under state law."
