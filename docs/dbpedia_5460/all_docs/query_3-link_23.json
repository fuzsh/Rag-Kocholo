        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The Kent State Board of Trustees approved a plan Wednesday to hand over day-to-day operations of WKSU 89.7, to Ideastream Public Media, the nonprofit that runs Northeast Ohio’s other public radio station, WCPN 90.3.\n\nThe agreement, which goes into effect on Oct. 1, is the culmination of a grant-funded study that explored ways for the two NPR stations to work together in order to strengthen and expand public service journalism in the region. The university will retain ownership of the station and its FCC license.\n\nThe arrangement represents a seismic shift in the local radio landscape.\n\nBeginning in 2022, WKSU will become the sole NPR station in Northeast Ohio, its journalistic efforts powered by the work of the newly combined newsroom based in Cleveland.\n\nThe new station’s programming will originate from WKSU’s 89.7 frequency and also be broadcast on its sister stations in Ashland, Mansfield, New Philadelphia, Norwalk, Thompson and Wooster. In Cleveland, it will also broadcast as a repeater station at 104.9 on the FM dial, where WCLV, Ideastream’s classical music station, currently resides.\n\n104.9 will take on WCPN’s call letters and reach NPR listeners in Cuyahoga County and eastern Lorain County, where 89.7′s signal is weak.\n\nWCLV and its classical-music programming will then move to 90.3 on the FM dial, and enjoy the benefit of its 50,000-watt reach.\n\n“The logic of this convergence stares us right in the face,” said WKSU Executive Director and General Manager Wendy Turner in a presentation before the trustees. “It is our duty to wisely and effectively utilize the investments made by our members, supporters and institutions. Currently, both Ideastream Public Media and WKSU allocate significant resources to deliver the same nationally syndicated programs, to the same population, often at exactly the same time. Nearly 90% of our news and information programming is duplicative.”\n\nIdeastream Public Media President and CEO Kevin Martin echoed those sentiments in an interview with cleveland.com, adding that the cost savings would allow the new station to expand news coverage.\n\n“I knew there would be cost-effective ways that would be a win for both institutions,” he said. “But what we really wanted to determine is how can we expand journalism, how can we look at this in creative ways that will allow us to utilize both newsrooms that are highly respected, not only in Ohio but nationally, and serve Northeast Ohio better.”\n\nPrior to the announcement, multiple sources with advance knowledge of the agreement told cleveland.com they believed WKSU’s $4 million debt was a factor in the university pursuing it. Kent State University President Todd Diacon confirmed the amount to reporters following the board meeting and said, following a year-long transition period, the $455,000 the school allocates annually to support the station will instead go towards paying that debt.\n\nMartin said no money changed hands in the deal.\n\n“There was no need for it,” he said. “WKSU now doesn’t have to worry about accounting, HR, or any of those back-office duties. (This) helps alleviate WKSU from having to supply that support.”\n\nWKSU employees are being offered jobs in the new operation, creating a combined workforce of 150 employees, including more than 40 staff members in the newsroom.\n\n“We’ve spoken to every WKSU employee to find out what their aspirations are,” Martin assured. “One of the things we have guaranteed is that their jobs would be the same.”\n\n“As I was driving home for our initial meeting I thought, yes, we should do this,” Diacon recalled at the board meeting. “But this agreement would need to enhance journalism, enhance reporting, enhance public affairs journalism for us to proceed and it certainly does that.”\n\nHis second priority was to make sure the deal met the university’s “Flashes take care of Flashes” commitment. That’s why he made sure WKSU staffers would be able to keep their tuition benefit for four years and remain in the Ohio Public Employee Retirement System if they wished. The university president initially indicated employees would receive 12-month job offers, but Ideastream later clarified that by saying the offers are for at-will employment with no limit on their terms just like current employees.\n\nIdeastream and Kent State also agreed that students will continue to be offered opportunities to gain valuable, real-world experience in the combined newsroom.\n\n“I’ve been reading read a lot of the published articles (about this) already and I was actually heartened to hear that there was some speculation or concern that we hadn’t thought about the student internship program when really that was the core of our thinking from the very beginning,” Martin said.\n\n“Expansion and collaboration with Kent State University’s journalism school and the College of Communication and Information is a marquee part of this vision,” Turner said. “Together, we will foster the next generation of public service journalists and expand the diversity of voices who are telling the stories of our communities.”\n\nBy adding WKSU and its regional stations, which together serve 22 counties, Ideastream Public Media will increase its potential audience from 2.4 million listeners to 3.6 million.\n\nStill, some longtime WKSU supporters wonder if the unified newsroom will be able to adequately cover areas like Summit, Portage, Trumbull and Mahoning counties from Ideastream’s headquarters in Playhouse Square.\n\n“Locally, WKSU has been a news leader and their newsroom has been a major contributor to NPR national newscasts,” said John Gorman, a former WMMS executive and an expert on the Cleveland radio market. “On the other hand, WCPN did not even have a full-fledged newsroom until a couple of years ago and their local coverage pales by comparison to WKSU.”\n\n“I can’t tell you how disappointing I believe this will be to all loyal KSU and WKSU supporters,” said Elizabeth Bartz, a former member of the WSKU Community Advisory Council. “But I have no reservations in saying if you go forward with this one-sided deal for Ideastream, our warnings will surely be replaced with ‘We told you so.’”\n\nMartin has heard those concerns, too. But he said having a larger staff will allow the newsroom to adopt a “more creative and expansive view” of what to cover.\n\n“Every newsroom has to prioritize what they can do with their limited resources. But what I’m excited about is this expands our resources,” he said. “We don’t need to have an unwritten agreement anymore to say, ‘Oh well, WKSU is obviously going to cover that because that’s in their backyard.’”\n\nListeners won’t notice much of a difference for now. WKSU and WCPN will continue to operate as separate NPR stations while leaders at the joint operation make plans for the transition. The consolidation of resources and frequency and format changes are expected to be completed by April.\n\nMartin said an added benefit of the deal is that it gives Ideastream a major opportunity to expand its classical-music audience in Cleveland, the home of Cleveland Orchestra, Apollo’s Fire and other internationally renowned musical arts groups.\n\n“When we looked at different scenarios, we thought this would be another huge win for Northeast Ohioans,” he said. “When 90.3 becomes WLCV, there’ll be upwards of a million more listeners of classical music.”\n\nDiacon acknowledged change can be difficult for listeners to accept but praised the deal. “Public radio listeners are a passionate bunch. They are a discerning public and they are a loyal audience,” the university president said. “But we know this means we will be bigger, we will be stronger, and more importantly, ever more committed to the expansion of journalistic excellence in Northeast Ohio.”"
