        "text": "?\n\nNumeris released its fall metered radio ratings last week, and as usual you can play around with the numbers all you want, but it’s clear there has been am impact on the ratings, particularly for The Beat 92.5 but also for Virgin Radio 95.9, that started around the time we went into lockdown. Both stations lost about a third of their audience since the spring.\n\nAverage minute audience, anglophone Montrealers 12+, Aug. 31 to Nov. 29:\n\nCJAD 800: 12,200\n\nThe Beat 92.5: 7,000\n\nCHOM 977: 5,500\n\nVirgin 95.9: 3,500\n\nCBC Radio One: 3,300\n\nCBC Music: 1,500\n\nTSN 690: 1,400\n\n98,5fm: 1,000\n\nRythme 105,7: 800\n\nICI Radio-Canada Première: 600\n\nCHOM and CJAD have slightly negative trendlines but have managed to hold their own during the pandemic. CHOM remains rated better than Virgin, while CJAD is still the highest-rated English-language station among anglophones, with a stronger share but fewer listeners on average than it had in 2016-18.\n\nAlso of note is that CBC Music, formerly Radio Two, has been improving its numbers in Montreal, and had edged out TSN 690 in overall audience. That doesn’t mean TSN is doing horribly, though. The Canadiens’ playoff run this summer prevented it from hitting a summer low as deep as it saw in 2018, and even though the team hasn’t played this fall, it remains on par with ratings in fall 2018 and 2017.\n\nAmong francophones, 98,5fm remains unsurprisingly the top-rated station. The average minute audience (12+) ranks as such:\n\n98,5fm: 32,600\n\nICI Radio-Canada Première 95,1: 23,000\n\n105,7 Rythme FM: 20,400\n\nCKOI 96,9: 13,800\n\n107,3 Rouge: 12,700\n\nÉnergie 94,3: 11,700\n\nCHOM 97.7: 8,100\n\nICI Musique 100,7: 6,700\n\nThe Beat 92.5: 5,900\n\nVirgin Radio 95.9: 4,900\n\nWKND 99,5: 2,600\n\n91,9 Sports: 1,200\n\nCBC Music: 1,000\n\nTSN 690: 600\n\nCJAD 800: 400\n\nOf course, that didn’t stop Bell from declaring victory, saying Énergie was the top-rated station in Montreal, based on counting only those ages 25-54 (the money demo for advertisers). Rythme FM countered that it was the highest-rated music station (using the “big number”), listing all the time periods it is #1 and conveniently ignoring that time period before 8:30am.\n\nThe newest kid on the block, WKND 99.5, started slow out of the gate, and still hasn’t built up an audience to match what it saw as Radio Classique. That’s to be expected, as a new radio station takes a while, and the pandemic isn’t helping. It almost doubled its audience from the summer, and we can probably expect those numbers to slowly improve over the coming year.\n\nNumeris cancelled its fall ratings for diary markets (Quebec City, Saguenay, Sherbrooke, Ottawa-Gatineau, etc.), so we’ll have to wait for next spring to find out how those stations are doing."
