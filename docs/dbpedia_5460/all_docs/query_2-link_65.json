        "text": "The blog is closing for the weekend, but Ideastream Public Media‚Äôs coverage of the winter storm continues. Here are a few ways to follow along:\n\nüñäÔ∏èSign up for The Daily Frequency, our email newsletter.\n\nüëç Follow us on Facebook.\n\n‚û°Ô∏èStay up to date with trustworthy local news at ideastream.org.\n\nüéß Listen to \"Morning Edition\" with Amy Eddings Tuesday morning at 6 a.m.\n\nThanks for joining us!\n\nGov. Mike DeWine is warning Ohioans to stay safe as dangerous weather conditions continue into the night.\n\n‚ÄúOur sympathy goes to those families who have lost a loved one during this severe weather situation in Ohio. Thus far four Ohioans have died and many more have been injured as a result of weather-related auto accidents,\" DeWine said in a statement.\n\n\"The road conditions continue to be very dangerous across the state, with white outs and extremely cold temperatures continuing,\" he said. \"Please continue to remain home if at all possible and be vigilant with these extremely dangerous road conditions.‚Äù\n\nOne person has died and several were injured in a 50 car pileup on the Ohio Turnpike in Erie County today.\n\nMost of Northeast Ohio remains under a snow emergency.\n\nWarming centers across Northeast Ohio opened Friday to provide a place for those who need it to get out of the subzero temperatures.\n\nEsaw Williams, a formerly unhoused man who said he spends his days seeking work, came to the Michael J. Zone Resource and Recreation Center, one of four Cleveland rec centers opened as warming centers, to warm up and use a computer.\n\n\"I understand why people are coming in here getting online, watching a movie -- to take their mind off of it being so cold, to take your mind off of being so hungry, to take your mind off of your feet hurting,‚Äù Williams said.\n\nIn Canton, at the Refuge of Hope warming center in Canton, about 10 people came in to warm up and receive new socks, gloves and a hat.\n\nRead more of reporter Gabriel Kramer's coverage of local warming centers.\n\nCleveland Water is offering tips on how to defrost a frozen pipe. They say you should act fast if a pipe is frozen. You can tell your pipe is frozen if you turn on the faucet and no water or only a slight trickle comes out.\n\nHere are some tools you can use to thaw a pipe:\n\nHairdryer\n\nHeating pad\n\nSpace heater\n\nHeat lamp\n\nYou can also contact a plumber to thaw your pipes.\n\nNever use a blow torch or open flame to thaw a pipe, they say, as it creates a fire hazard and can damage the pipe.\n\nCleveland Water warns that if frozen pipes burst, it can cause serious and expensive damage. If a pipe happens to burst, shut your water off at the main valve immediately to minimize flooding and call a plumber.\n\nTo avoid your pipes freezing, leave a thin flow of water from faucets during cold spells. If you're away from home for several days, set you thermostat to at least 55 degrees to keep interior plumbing warm.\n\nRead more of Cleveland Water's advice on water pipes during the cold weather.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms of frostbite and hypothermia can come on quickly when exposed to cold temperatures.\n\nSymptoms of hypothermia:\n\nShivering\n\nExhaustion or feeling very tired\n\nConfusion\n\nFumbling hands\n\nMemory loss\n\nSlurred speech\n\nDrowsiness\n\nBright red skin and/or low energy for babies\n\nThe CDC recommends getting medical attention as soon as possible for a person with symptoms. If that's not possible, remove wet clothing and move the individual to a warm space and use blankets, skin-to-skin contact and hot drinks to raise their body temperature.\n\nSymptoms of frostbite:\n\nredness or pain on the skin\n\nA white or grayish-yellow skin area\n\nSkin that feels unusually firm or waxy\n\nNumbness\n\nSeek medical attention for those with symptoms of frostbite, if possible. The CDC advises against rubbing or massaging the affected area or using heating pads, lamps or radiators to warm up. Instead, use warm ‚Äî not hot ‚Äî water, or use body heat to fight the frostbite.\n\nLook out for people at higher risk of hypothermia, such as babies in cold rooms, those drinking alcohol or using drugs, adults without food, winter clothing and heating, and those exposed to the elements for long periods of time, like the homeless or hikers\n\nVisit the CDC website to read more about prevention and treatment.\n\nHeavy winds are causing power outages across the region, with the hardest hit community being Sandusky.\n\nFirstEnergy's power outage web site says 7,172 Sandusky households are without power due to the severe weather.\n\nAbout 4,900 customers are without power in Summit County, with about 2,000 in Akron and 1,300 in Barberton.\n\nOnly about 1,300 customers are without power throughout Cuyahoga County and 2,100 in Portage County. Other Northeast Ohio counties have outages in the hundreds or less.\n\nIn Sandusky, Tom Horsman, the city's communications manager, said power went out at his home at 4:40 a.m. and was restored by around 10:30 a.m. That was long enough to make it very cold.\n\n\"Pipes are frozen ... in my kitchen,\" he said. \"Hopefully now with the heat back on, that will help.\"\n\nThe weather outside is frightful. Twenty-foot waves are predicted on Lake Erie and gusts of wind up to 60 miles per hour could buffet Northeast Ohio until Saturday.\n\nBut if you want to watch Mother Nature's formidable display without venturing out, Cleveland Water's live stream shows the view from the 5-Mile Crib in Lake Erie ‚Äî 3.5 miles from the shoreline.\n\nConditions on the lake are blustery and swirling snow is reducing visibility on the cam, but the waves are unmistakable.\n\nThe crib is the orange structure visible when looking out over the lake from the Shoreway and Downtown. It's the only one of the city's four water intakes that is visible above the water, according to the city.\n\nThe crib is more than 100 years old. Originally built in 1898, it was renovated in the 1990s, the city said.\n\nUntil the 1960s, workers would stay on the crib to operate a foghorn and navigational lights, which, from the looks of the live stream today, would have been a pretty chilly assignment during storms like this.\n\nThe Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless (NEOCH) has been reaching out to the unsheltered in Cleveland this week to alert them of the upcoming inclement weather, and places where they can stay warm, said Chris Knestrick, NEOCH executive director.\n\n‚ÄúA lot of our work has been just making sure we‚Äôre connecting with people this week and preparing them with ways to get inside,\" Knestrick said. \"For us, it just feels really urgent, and at times very scary, when we know weather‚Äôs going to be so dangerously cold outside.‚Äù\n\nThere is an overnight men‚Äôs shelter open at 2100 Lakeside Ave. and the Norma Herr women‚Äôs shelter at 2227 Payne Avenue in Cleveland, he said. They've also referred individuals to several churches that also do overnight homeless outreach, he said.\n\nIn Akron, there is one emergency overnight shelter, located at 111 East Voris Street. The Peter Maurin Center, a homeless outreach nonprofit, operates the shelter along with Summit County Continuum of Care and Community Support Services.\n\nWorkers and volunteers will provide unsheltered individuals with meals, toiletries and a place to sleep this weekend, said James Orenga, executive director of the Peter Maurin Center. Individuals do not have to be from Akron to stay there, he said.\n\nRead more about resources for people who are unsheltered.\n\nExtreme winter weather, such as subzero temperatures, wind chills and heavy snow, is impacting much of the U.S. this holiday weekend, and is expected to heavily impact travel and mail deliveries, and could even be deadly in some regions.\n\nThe intense conditions are piquing interest in the meteorological term \"bomb cyclone.\" Google searches for the term over the last seven days peaked Wednesday.\n\nWhat is a bomb cyclone?\n\nA bomb cyclone, also known as bombogenesis, is defined by a rapidly intensifying storm. That can happen when atmospheric pressure drops significantly, which is usually the result of warm and cold air masses overlapping, according to the National Ocean Service.\n\nContinue reading to learn where bomb cyclones are likely to happen this weekend.\n\nThe projected storm is ‚Äúunusual‚Äù because the trifecta of snow, single-digit temperatures and high winds could make for dangerous driving conditions ‚Äì and complicate crews‚Äô response, said Jim Hall, bureau manager of Akron‚Äôs public works department.\n\nAkron crews will attempt to pre-treat the roads ahead of the diving temperatures Thursday night, Hall said. They can‚Äôt use salt brine because of the rain, so they will have to use rock salt, he said.\n\nDrivers should be extra cautious Thursday night into Friday morning due to an expected ‚Äúflash freeze,‚Äù Hall added. The rain is expected to turn to freezing rain overnight, and temperatures will plummet - causing icy conditions.\n\nSnow is expected to begin Friday morning and while the amount of expected snowfall is still up in the air, the frigid temperatures and gusts of wind will increase the chances of blowing snow, Hall added.\n\n\"There could be moments of limited visibility, maybe even whiteouts, typical of a blizzard, and I think that's why you hear a lot of people talking about the blizzard, because those type of conditions can creep up on you in a hurry,‚Äù he said.\n\nAkron plows will prioritize expressways and main roads first, Hall said, then tackle local roads and residential streets.\n\nWhen it comes to the highways, 300 ODOT trucks will be out on highways across Northeast Ohio, said Ray Marsch, spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) region that covers Summit, Stark and Portage counties. Plow drivers will be working 12-hour shifts to stay on top of the conditions, Marsch said. But, he warned, ‚Äúif the snow‚Äôs coming down more than an inch in an hour, you are going to see snow on the roads.‚Äù\n\nMarsh encourages drivers to slow down and keep plenty of distance from the car ahead of them. Hall recommends keeping blankets and food supplies in your car in case of an emergency or breakdown in the freezing temperatures.\n\n‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking at single-digit temperatures and winds in the 40 to 30 miles an hour, you can get frostbite just filling up your gas tank,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of real dangers out there, not specifically related to the roadways and the ice and the snow, but just that level of cold and wind.‚Äù\n\nRead more about storm preparations around the region.\n\nMany major airlines are preparing for delayed and canceled flights going into the Christmas weekend by offering to waive the fee on flight changes. NPR reports, American, United, Southwest and even Spirit are among the airlines trying to accommodate changes to your air travel plans.\n\nFor those flying out of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, officials warned at a Wednesday press conference that the airport may have to close, depending on the conditions.\n\n‚ÄúIf it becomes too much, and it‚Äôs coming down too low and we just can‚Äôt, and it becomes a safety issue, we will possibly have to shut down the airport for a temporary period,‚Äù said spokesman John Goersmeyer.\n\nIndividuals should check the status of their flights on the airport‚Äôs website, he said, because delays and cancellations are expected.\n\nHe also recommends checking to see if rooms are available at local hotels in case flights are canceled.\n\nThe city of Canton will offer an overnight warming center beginning Thursday, Dec. 22 through Monday, Dec. 26. The American Red Cross is supplying cots, and SARTA is offering free transportation.\n\nEdward ‚ÄúPeel‚Äù Coleman Community Center\n\n1400 Sherrick Road SE, Canton\n\n330-489-3350\n\nThursday: 6 p.m. - 8 a.m.\n\nFriday: 6 p.m. - 8 a.m.\n\nSaturday: 4 p.m. - 8 a.m.\n\nSunday: 4 p.m. - 8 a.m.\n\nMonday: 4 p.m. - 8 a.m.\n\nRefuge of Hope\n\n715 Second Street NE, Canton\n\nFriday: 8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. (no overnight stays)\n\nSaturday: 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. (no overnight stays)\n\nResidents should tell their SARTA bus driver if they are headed to a warming center and the ride will be free. If transportation is needed but SARTA is not available, residents can call 330-649-5800 for assistance.\n\nThe city of Cleveland is extending the hours of several recreation centers to serve as warming centers this weekend. They will not be open for overnight stays.\n\nZelma George Neighborhood Resource & Recreation Center\n\n3155 Martin L. King Boulevard, Cleveland\n\nFriday: 11:30 a.m. - 10 p.m.\n\nSaturday: 9:30 a.m. - 10 p.m.\n\nSunday: 9:30 a.m. - 10 p.m.\n\nMonday: 9:30 a.m. - 10 p.m.\n\nMichael Zone Neighborhood Resource & Recreation Center\n\n6301 Lorain Avenue, Cleveland\n\nFriday: 11:30 a.m. - 10 p.m.\n\nSaturday: 9:30 a.m. - 10 p.m.\n\nSunday: 9:30 a.m. - 10 p.m.\n\nMonday: 9:30 a.m. - 10 p.m.\n\nCollinwood Neighborhood Resource & Recreation Center\n\n16300 Lakeshore Boulevard, Cleveland\n\nFriday: 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.\n\nSaturday: 9:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.\n\nSterling Neighborhood Resource & Recreation Center\n\n1380 East 32nd Street, Cleveland\n\nFriday: 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.\n\nSaturday: 9:30 a.m. to 10 p.m."
