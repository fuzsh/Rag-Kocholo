        "text": "Did you vote on a provisional ballot Tuesday because you forgot to bring a photo ID? Be sure your vote counts by going to your local board of elections and presenting a valid photo ID.\n\nThe deadline to cure your ballot is Monday, Nov. 13 at 5 p.m. Due to the Veterans Day holiday, boards of elections will be closed on Saturday.\n\nHours of operation for local boards of elections:\n\nThursday, November 9, 2023, 8:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.\n\nFriday, November 10, 2023, 8:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.\n\nMonday, November 13, 2023, 8:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m.\n\nA software error is to blame for the Summit County Board of Elections website causing some confusion for voters and candidates Tuesday night, Deputy Director Pete Zeigler said Wednesday.\n\nAt 10 p.m., the county’s overall unofficial results reflected only 4% of precincts reporting results countywide, while the individual contests indicated 100% of precincts reported.\n\nThe board’s website vendor labeled the percentages incorrectly, Zeigler said.\n\n“The results were all processed and reported accurately, just some of the labeling on the website was mislabeled,” Zeigler said. “It’s just a vendor issue in terms of handling the website.”\n\nThe board eventually took down the interactive page from its website and uploaded a PDF of the results.\n\nThe board’s information technology department is working with the vendor to fix the issue, he said.\n\nDespite strong opinions on Issues 1 and 2, voter turnout for Tuesday's general election was down compared to last November.\n\nAccording to unofficial county board of election data:\n\nCuyahoga County saw a 45% turnout, down from the 47.39% it saw in 2022.\n\nSummit County yielded a 51.5% turnout, down from last year's 54.64%.\n\nLorain County recorded a 50.67% turnout, down from last November's 51.93%.\n\nStark County saw a 52.01% turnout, down 54.5% from last year.\n\nPortage County recorded a 53.27% turnout, down from 56.59% last year.\n\nTurnout in Portage County was \"not bad,\" said Board of Elections Deputy Director Theresa Nielsen said.\n\nElection night went smoothly there, according to the board of elections, despite reports that results were coming in slowly.\n\nThis was because election staff had to hand count the results from several races with write-in candidates, Nielsen said.\n\n\"We actually had one entire race that was only write-in candidates, so we needed to process all of our write-in candidate information before we posted our final report,\" she said. \"That's a labor-intensive process and so most of our information was done by probably 10:00 or 10:30 but because we had to go and physically count the write-in votes that just took longer.\"\n\nNielson said this isn't out of the ordinary for the board of elections.\n\nElection night went smoothly in Portage County, according to the county's board of elections, despite reports that results were coming in slowly.

Every single status quo politician opposed Issue 38 and many worked for its defeat.\"\n\nSupporters gathered at Connect Lounge in Downtown Cleveland.\n\nAll 13 Akron City Council seats were up for election on Tuesday. The majority of incumbents will keep their seats, but some newcomers will join them as well.\n\nIn Ward 9, which includes Kenmore, as of 10:16 p.m., Democrat Tina Boyes was leading Republican Micah Townsend, 67% to 33% with seven of 10 precincts reporting, according to the Summit County Board of Elections.\n\nDemocrats swept the at-large seats.

Here's what a cross-section of voters at three different polling places had to say about it.\n\n🗣️ \"Just do it. Get it done and over with.

Issue 1, it's so important, not only for women's freedom, but for everyone's freedom. When we have other people making medical decisions based on their own personal beliefs, that's an extremely big issue. It should be medical professionals and people that choose for themselves,\" said Emily Erbs, of Medina.\n\n🗣️ \"I think this is more of a woman issue. I think they need to be represented in this issue. There's some hard boundary lines on it. That needs to be represented. It's going to be very important.

He says it will allow the school to continue to offer the “lowest tuition in the state of Ohio.”\n\nIt currently costs $125 per credit hour to attend the community college. That would jump to $556 per credit hour if the levy isn’t renewed, he said.\n\nThe 2.1-mill levy equals $73.50 per year per $100,000 of assessed property value in Cuyahoga County. The renewal request includes a .4-mill increase over the current levy, which represents an increase of $14.04 per year per $100,000 of assessed value.\n\n➡ Read more about Cuyahoga County Issue 5.\n\nEight candidates are vying for three open Akron Public Schools Board of Education seats in November, only one of whom is an incumbent.\n\nThe slate of candidates includes former Ohio Rep.

For example, a household with four eligible adults could only grow 12 plants, according to the law proposal's text.\n\nCultivators and dispensaries already licensed for medicinal marijuana will also receive adult-use recreational licenses within nine months, assuming they fit all requirements, according to the ballot text.
