        "text": "The transition to a professional public radio news station was gradual. For most of the station’s history, even with its student-produced lineup, the station featured classical music. The switch slowly came to life starting in 1974, when WKSU became an NPR affiliate. This change resulted in the addition of many NPR news programs throughout the years, such as Morning Edition, Fresh Air and All Things Considered.\n\nWKSU officially changed its format to news and information in August 2013 to better serve the region and provide quality journalism.\n\n“As a public radio station, WKSU is not driven solely by the quest for high ratings,” says Andrew Meyer, WKSU news director. Instead, the news team looks to create and share valuable content with the community. “Our goal is to make sure we’re pursuing the stories that are important to our audience, and we want to be engaged and connected with the communities we serve to make sure we are aware of what they need.”\n\nPrograms like OH Really? help connect the WKSU news team to the community. Through OH Really?, the community becomes part of the journalistic process, submitting and voting on questions online for the reporters to investigate.\n\nThe technology that today’s staff uses is a far cry from that available to the first student staff.\n\nThe technology that today’s staff uses is a far cry from that available to the first student staff. The station began its digital chapter in 1994 when WKSU.org was brought to life. Chuck Poulton, the current senior network administrator at WKSU, built the website 26 years ago.\n\n“At that time, we were one of the first dozen or so NPR stations to have a website,” Poulton says. “In early 1995, we were the first non-commercial station to use RealAudio technology to stream audio on a website, and we were the second radio station in the world to do so.”\n\nWKSU showed its innovative capabilities when it started its first online radio stations in 2005, allowing listeners to tune in on the web and access HD channels. Today, most listeners use their mobile devices with the WKSU app or website to hear their favorite on-air hosts, rather than moving the dial on their car radios.\n\nPoulton says, “Now we have so many ways to stay in touch: in multiple streams and formats, on a variety of platforms and devices, on demand and in real time, with sound, images and video, and with direct input and interaction from the audience.”\n\nTech advances constantly contribute to innovations that better fit the audience’s wants and needs. In March 2018, WKSU released its Pledge-Free Stream. When WKSU hosts on-air fundraising, a separate audio stream is available without fundraising messages, which is a huge benefit for its sustaining members—donors who contribute monthly to WKSU.\n\nThe staff of WKSU used their tech savvy to safely celebrate the station’s 70th anniversary. With coronavirus safety protocols still in place, WKSU hosted a live virtual presentation from NPR’s Morning Edition host, Steve Inskeep, broadcasting it to an audience watching from home.\n\nThe celebration looked far different from the events held in 2000 to commemorate the station’s 50th anniversary. Those events included guests such as Terry Gross from Fresh Air and Robert Siegel from All Things Considered, and a live presentation of A Prairie Home Companion at Blossom Music Center.\n\nHowever, this year’s celebration wasn’t any less meaningful. “Although we wanted to have a number of events throughout 2020 to celebrate our 70th year, we’ve obviously had to adjust our plans,” says Lindsay Kuntzman Hilewick, BA ’06, MA ’09, fundraising and communications director. “We have a history of persevering and being innovative here at WKSU and the virtual 70th anniversary event embodied those characteristics perfectly.”\n\nThe virtual event was sponsored by the Friends of WKSU, a nonprofit organization that raises funds to further the impact of the work produced by the news team.\n\nSuch innovation and expertise have not gone unrecognized. In 2020, WKSU again received a Best in Ohio award for the category of Best Radio Newscast (having received this award six times in the last seven years) and firsts in the categories of Radio News Website and Use of Social Media from the Ohio Excellence in Journalism Awards—a statewide competition for the best in print, broadcast and digital journalism. WKSU also placed first in the Best News Operation category from the Society of Professional Journalists Ohio Chapter, whose awards celebrate Ohio’s best journalism.\n\n“Expanding public service is our vision,” says Wendy Turner, WKSU’s general manager and executive director. “WKSU aspires to grow the reporting staff, deepen strategic journalism partnerships and widen our use and expertise with emerging digital tools and platforms.”\n\nAs WKSU strives to better serve its listening audience and strengthen its relationships with other organizations, it has one partnership it especially seeks to reinforce. The students at Walt Clarke’s Radio Workshop helped shape and mold the station 70 years ago. Their success created a ripple effect that has expanded across time and continues to inspire Kent State students today.\n\nFueling journalistic passion in students and graduates will remain a priority in the future, Turner says. “We look to strengthen our partnership with Kent State’s College of Communication and Information to identify, support and train the next generation of public service journalists.”\n\nIn that case, the future looks bright for another 70 years of loyal listeners, outstanding reporting, superior technological advances and a passionate staff to continue the WKSU legacy.\n\nSee a timeline of WKSU’s history at www.wksu.org/wksu-history.\n\nIn 1980, after 30 years on the air, it was big news when WKSU increased its power to 50,000 watts. This ad promoting WKSU ran in The Repository, the local newspaper of Canton, Ohio."
