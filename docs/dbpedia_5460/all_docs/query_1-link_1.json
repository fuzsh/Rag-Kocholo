        "text": "Why are Ideastream Public Media and WKSU coming together?\n\nConsolidating our resources allows us to provide more local, regional and statewide news coverage to more people, build a bigger regional newsroom and expand classical music programming.\n\nWhy did you choose WKSU as the NPR station?\n\nThe WKSU network of stations covers more than 20 counties in Ohio and is currently the largest FM station in the state. We will broadcast our news on the WKSU network, as well as on 104.9 FM (currently our classical station), which will help provide service in some of areas where the 89.7 FM signal has weaker reception.\n\nCollectively, this network of stations will provide local, state and regional news access to 3.6 million people in 22 counties. The change also allows us to use the 90.3 FM signal to make our classical service, accessible to one million more listeners in Northeast Ohio.\n\nThe results of all this work will become a reality on Monday, March 28, when we’ll rollout a new schedule on our news and information station WKSU. Many of our listeners may find their favorite programming has moved or is now airing at a different time. We know it will take time to adapt to these changes, but the result is going to give our region more opportunities to access the quality news and programming that only public radio provides.\n\nHow do I listen to news, information and NPR? Where is WCPN?\n\nAs of March 28, those who currently listen to WCPN 90.3 FM will be able to find their favorite news, reporters, programs and NPR coverage at WKSU 89.7 FM, as well as on 104.9 FM. They can also listen on the network of stations that carry WKSU including 89.1 Thompson, 89.3 Wooster, 90.7 Norwalk, 91.5 New Philadelphia, 94.7 Mansfield and 95.7 Ashland.\n\nI can’t access 89.7 or 104.9. What can I do?\n\nIn addition to tuning in at 89.7 FM or 104.9 FM for news & information, listeners can:\n\nStream: Go to ideastream.org to stream from a computer or mobile phone.\n\nUse a mobile App: Download the free Ideastream Public Media mobile app (available March 28) by going to the Apple App Store for iPhones and iPads, or the Google Play Store for Android devices.\n\nListen with WVIZ TV: Listeners can access WKSU programming at 25.7 on TVs that receive our WVIZ signal over the air.\n\nUse HD Radio: Listeners can find WKSU on 89.7 HD1 and 90.3 HD2. Additional news and information programming and more is available on WKSU HD4. HD Radio is standard in many newer vehicles and is a good choice for in-car listening if your vehicle is so equipped. HD radios for in-home use are also available.\n\nUse Smart TV: WKSU news and information is also accessible on smart TVs via the TuneIn app.\n\nUse Smart Speakers: Telling Alexa, Siri or your preferred smart speaker to \"Play WKSU\"\n\nI understand I may live in an area that has a weak signal for WKSU. What should I do?\n\nBecause of Northeast Ohio’s topography, there are areas of Cuyahoga and Lake County along the lake where the over-the-air 89.7 signal is not as strong as the 90.3 service. Especially when listening on a traditional radio inside the home, listeners may find that neither the 89.7 or the 104.9 signal is available, or as clear as they were used to. Listening via streaming, the Ideastream Public Media mobile app (available March 28), HD Radio, smart speaker or TV will provide the best quality service inside the home. We are actively pursuing a technological solution to increase the accessibility of the 89.7 signal. We hope to have this signal boosting solution in place by Fall 2022.\n\nAre there likely to be areas where over-the-air coverage will never be restored?\n\nWe hope not and are working hard to address this issue. We will keep the community informed as we work on a solution. However, since its inception radio frequencies have never been the perfect solution for perfect reception. Radio frequencies are vulnerable to topography, weather, indoor penetration, and the type of device that is used to receive the signal.\n\nWhat does this new arrangement mean to Northeast Ohio?\n\nThree very important changes will happen as a result of this new arrangement:\n\nMore local and statewide news coverage\n\nA bigger regional newsroom and more reporting\n\nExpanded classical music programming\n\nHow do I listen to classical music? Where is WCLV?\n\nWCLV, Ideastream Public Media’s classical service, will move from 104.9 FM to 90.3 FM beginning March 28. This change will make classical music accessible to approximately 1 million additional listeners.\n\nClassical music will also be available on 89.7 HD3, which is accessible free-of-charge on the new Ideastream Public Media App (available March 28), at ideastream.org and on HD-equipped radios. Anyone with a cell phone, smart speaker or computer or tablet with internet access will be able to listen to these programs and a variety of others on our digital channels. In addition, cars equipped with HD channel options are rapidly becoming the industry standard.\n\nHow has the schedule changed?\n\nFor many of our listeners, the place on the dial where they’ve gone to find their NPR programming has moved. In addition, listeners may find their favorite program is now airing at a different time. A full list of these programs is available here. We know it will take time to adapt to these changes, but we hope our listeners will agree the result is going to give our region more opportunities to access the quality news and programming that only public radio provides.\n\nWhat happens to the Hosts?\n\nWhen news broke that WCPN and WKSU were joining forces, many wondered what would happen to the hosts. We’re excited to share that they will all remain on-air!\n\nAmy Eddings will be the host of Morning Edition on WKSU, the show she’s hosted on WCPN for five years.\n\nAmanda Rabinowitz will move to hosting All Things Considered on weeknights, a move that interests her personally and professionally.\n\nRick Jackson will continue to host Sound of Ideas.\n\nJeff St. Clair, who previously hosted All Things Considered on WKSU will host midday newscasts as we expand that service.\n\nHow are you expanding news?\n\nThe entire weekday is now filled with news starting at 5am.\n\nMorning Edition begins every weekday at 5am with host Amy Eddings\n\nThe Sound of Ideas immediately follows at 9am with host Rick Jackson\n\nWe’re adding local midday news breaks with host Jeff St. Clair from Noon – 4pm\n\nThe City Club will broadcast live at noon beginning April 1\n\nAll Things Considered with host Amanda Rabinowitz begins at 4pm\n\nWe’re adding PBS NewsHour from 7-8pm\n\nRick Jackson returns at 9pm with a repeat of the Sound of Ideas\n\nCheck out the full schedule here\n\nBringing the Ideastream and WKSU news teams together will allow us to become a truly regional newsroom, add regional context, cover more local stories and establish an Akron/Canton news hub.\n\nWhat is happening to the nationality programming?\n\nWe’ve met with each of the nationality hosts to talk about the transition and are pleased that the Hungarian and Polish program hosts will take advantage of the opportunity to broadcast their programs on WKSU HD4 (digital) channel. WKSU HD4 is accessible free-of-charge on the new Ideastream Public Media App (available March 28), at ideastream.org and on HD-equipped radios.\n\nAnyone with a cell phone, smart speaker or computer or tablet with internet access will be able to listen to these programs and a variety of others on our digital channels. In addition, many cars today are equipped with HD channel options. The Hungarian and Polish programs will air will Sundays at 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., respectively. We will also help direct listeners to the new channel with a variety of promotional announcements.\n\nWhat happened to the programs I don’t see on the radio schedule?\n\nWe will continue to offer a variety of programs on our digital channels:\n\nWKSU’s digital channels will continue to offer Folk Alley on HD2, All Classical on HD3, and News and More on HD4.\n\nThe Hungarian and Polish programming that previously aired Sunday evenings on WCPN will now air on WKSU HD4 Sundays at 8 p.m. and 9 p.m.\n\nFans of The Takeaway, On Being, Sound Opinions, and the 2-hour Folk Alley Sunday shows can also find those programs and more on the HD4 channel.\n\nThese channels are available on the new Ideastream Public Media app, at ideastream.org and on HD-equipped radios.
