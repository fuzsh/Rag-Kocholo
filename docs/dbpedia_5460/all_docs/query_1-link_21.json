        "text": "“Don’t call classical music a niche. Not in Greater Cleveland,” writes Zachary Lewis in Saturday’s (12/11) Plain Dealer. “As the recent merger of Northeast Ohio’s public radio stations makes clear, classical music remains a powerhouse that commands attention and drives decisions. From a deal in which it seems there were no losers, WCLV-FM has emerged a clear winner, landing a stronger frequency and a significantly larger potential audience…. Since July of 2001, the classical station formerly known as 95.5 has been broadcasting on 104.9, a limited frequency primarily serving the region’s West Side. That’s about to change in a big way in 2022. Under the terms of a new arrangement announced in September, WCPN-FM 90.3 will combine with WKSU-FM 89.7 to form a large newsroom broadcasting on both 89.7 and 104.9, a class A radio station. That leaves WCLV to 90.3, a class B station, which spans 22 counties … With a broader range, WCLV will be better able to cover arts events … Ross Binnie, chief brand officer of the Cleveland Orchestra, [said], ‘We are thrilled to know that WCLV will be on a stronger signal, so more people will have free access to live Cleveland Orchestra performances.’ ”"
