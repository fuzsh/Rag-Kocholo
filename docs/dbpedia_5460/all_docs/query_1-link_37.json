        "text": "From Radio World’s Who’s Buying What page: Ideastream Public Media has deployed a MaxxCasting System from GeoBroadcast Solutions at noncommercial FM station WKSU in Cleveland.\n\nIdeastream operates WKSU under an agreement with Kent State University announced in 2021, after which it consolidated operations of its own WCPN(FM). The region’s NPR programming now airs on WKSU at 89.7 FM and a network of repeaters.\n\nGBS said the MaxxCasting system has improved the station’s signal and audience reach in northeast Ohio. “The most recent ratings showed a 6+ audience increase from the 4.2 in December to a 5.5 in February,” it said in its announcement.\n\nWKSU has deployed the first of a two-node single-frequency network including HD Radio.\n\nGBS quoted Chuck Poulton, senior director of technology at Ideastream Public Media, saying, “After the merger, WKSU needed improvements to reach the growing population of the metro-Cleveland aera. The nodes will do a tremendous job of filling the area and providing a signal that is clear and strong.”\n\nPaul Littleton, CTO of GeoBroadcast Solutions, was quoted saying, “Part of what our MaxxCasting system will accomplish for WKSU is not having to duplicate much coverage. It allows for the introduction of more content to more listeners, including the public service broadcasting to the communities the station serves.”\n\nAt bottom are before and after images of signal coverage provided by GBS.\n\nMaxxCasting is intended to help FM stations enhance their signals through deployment of a cluster of directionalized, synchronized booster sites."
