Today is the 40th anniversary of Dallas radio legend Mark Davis’ career as a professional broadcaster. What better way to celebrate it than being a guest on the award-winning PodcastOne series, “The Michael Harrison Interview?” Davis is one of the most successful and respected local news/talk radio hosts in America. For the past decade, this self-described libertarian-conservative has hosted the 7:00 am – 10:00 am CT morning show on Salem’s AM 660, The Answer – KSKY-AM – in the vibrant Dallas/Fort Worth market. Prior to that, he did a long stint at WBAP – also in the Dallas Metroplex. Along the way, he’s served as a regular fill-in for the late Rush Limbaugh and other national hosts in addition to having written two well-received books about politics published by Regnery. Harrison and Davis engage in a lively chat about the radio veteran’s career including changes over the past four decades in journalism, broadcasting technology, radio localism, the military (Davis grew up in a U.S. Air Force family) and partisanship in the national conversation.

The Audacy sports talk station reveals that it will move the current midday team of Joe DeCamara and Jon Ritchie to morning drive early next year when Angelo Cataldi retires from his historic run as SportsRadio 94WIP’s morning drive host. The new show will continue to feature longtime WIP morning anchor Rhea Hughes and producer James Seltzer. Audacy says it will name a new midday show in the coming months. WIP-FM brand manager Rod Lakin says, “We are very excited to announce Joe DeCamara and Jon Ritchie will be leading the WIP morning show. For the last three decades Angelo Cataldi set the standard for morning drive in Philadelphia and helped define the sports narrative of this great city. Joe and Jon, along with Rhea Hughes and the other talented members of the WIP morning show, will adhere to the standard that Angelo created and develop a connection with the Philadelphia sports audience for years to come.” DeCamara comments, “I am ecstatic for the opportunity to host mornings on WIP. There is a remarkable tradition of success long established by the legend, Angelo, and the entire current morning team, and my aim is to continue to uphold that level of excellence. I feel a tremendous sense of gratitude to WIP and Audacy management, to Angelo, and to WIP listeners and callers whose intense passion drives the heartbeat of Philly sports. We look forward to assembling the full team that will comprise our show as we move to mornings. And I look forward to multiple parades down Broad Street over the next four months!” Ritchie adds, “I’m grateful and honored that Joe and I have the opportunity to follow in Angelo Cataldi’s footsteps on WIP’s morning show. We’ll work hard to uphold the station’s tradition of emotional connection with the greatest sports fans in the world.”\n\nRadio Observers Reminisce and Analyze as Rock Gives Way to All-News on 92.3 FM in New York. Today’s move by Audacy that begins the simulcast of all-news WINS-AM on WNYL-FM (soon to become WINS-FM) was preceded by coverage of the change in the New York media that included reminiscing about the old “K-Rock” – for 20 years the flagship station of Howard Stern’s program – as well as the rock music and talk shows that also occupied the frequency over the years. In Verne Gay’s story on the change in Newsday, Audacy New York president Chris Oliviero is quoted saying, “Why now? That question has been bandied about for many years, but one of the major issues is that we’re still governed by FCC cap rules. Any time we wanted to add something to FM, we had to take something away. We had to make a choice [and] news and sports is what we do really well.” This change also comes at the same time as Audacy finalizes the newsroom merger of WINS and WCBS-AM. Audacy New York VP of news Ben Mevorach is quoted in the Newsday piece saying that “both stations will retain their separate identities, but that the merger ‘removes the redundancy of coverage’ and frees reporters up at each station to cover different stories. Mevorach added that there will be no layoffs but ‘actually the opposite: This is an all-out assault on becoming the dominant [radio] news leader here.’” Meanwhile, TALKERS magazine publisher Michael Harrison was asked about the changes and replied, “As natives of the 20th century, you and I still think there’s a difference between AM and FM but to natives of the 21st century, these are irrelevant facts. The flip doesn’t mean anything other than Audacy is doing the best it can to keep up with the times.” Regarding the end of rock music on 92.3 FM, Harrison adds, “It’s sad to see it go on a certain level, but radio gave up ownership of music years ago. It’s been a slow fade and this is another one of the lights going out. It doesn’t indicate anything beyond that.”\n\nAlpha Media Names Tim Spence Director of Sports Operations in San Antonio. Radio programming pro Tim Spence joins Alpha Media San Antonio as the new director of sports operations for KTFM-FM/KZDC-AM, San Antonio “Sports Star, 94.1 FM, 1250 AM.” Spence comes to Alpha from iHeartMedia Denver where he most recently served as program director for KHOW and KCOL and as APD for KOA. He was also affiliate relations manager for the 140-station radio network for the Denver Broncos and Colorado Rockies. Spence says, “I’d like to thank Lance Hawkins, Dax Davis and Greg Martin along with the entire Alpha Media family for this opportunity in San Antonio. This is a tremendous group of stations with a great staff, and I’m ready to get to work.”\n\nWABC, New York Names Studios in Honor or Bernard McGuirk.
