        "text": "The Wheeling Symphony Orchestra’s “A Not So Silent Night” holiday concert at the Cathedral of St. Joseph in Wheeling, West Virginia will be broadcast on WTRF-CBS and WTRF.com on December 16 at 7 p.m. Joining the orchestra on the one-hour program, conducted by Music Director John Devlin, will be mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke and the Wheeling Park High School Young Patriot Choir. The concert will include the world premiere of Quinn Mason’s Christmas Eve Festivities, and Cooke will perform opera and holiday music with the orchestra in arrangements by two frequent WSO collaborators: Michael Ellis Ingram’s Ave Maria, a U.S. premiere, and Enrico Lopez-Yañez’s Toyland, a world premiere. In 2020, the WSO created “A Not So Silent Night” in response to the restrictions on live music during the COVID-19 pandemic. “The feedback from the concert was so positive, we decided to do it again,” says WSO Executive Director Bryan Braunlich. “Staging both the holiday concert and Symphony on Ice in the same month is a lot of work, but well worth the effort. Community support for the orchestra is at an all-time high, and we are grateful to be part of the Ohio Valley’s holiday traditions.”\n\n“The past month has been a good one for music of Antonín Dvořák at Orchestra Hall,” writes Lawrence A. Johnson in Friday’s (12/10) Chicago Classical Review. “In November Jakub Hrůša led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in an exhilarating performance of the Czech composer’s infrequently heard Symphony No. 6. And Thursday night Hilary Hahn returned to Chicago as solo protagonist in Dvořák’s Violin Concerto … the first fruit of Hahn’s appointment as the orchestra’s debut artist-in-residence…. Hahn … brings not just sterling technical gleam but individuality and communicative expression to every performance…. Most striking was the way in which she conveyed the fantasia quality of Dvořák’s music…. Andrés Orozco-Estrada, the evening’s conductor, [drew] fiery and spirited playing from the orchestra…. The evening led off with the world premiere of Gabriela Lena Frank’s Haillí-Serenata [inspired by Frank’s] trip to Cajamarca, Peru, where the Incas were defeated by the Spanish army. There she saw cantadiores mestizos accompanying themselves on guitars while praying to their ancestors…. Scored solely for strings, Frank’s … score communicates a certain hypnotic aura in its spiritual melancholy. Orozco-Estrada led a dynamically alert performance … that made a worthy case.” Also on the program was Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 5.\n\n“Don’t call classical music a niche. Not in Greater Cleveland,” writes Zachary Lewis in Saturday’s (12/11) Plain Dealer. “As the recent merger of Northeast Ohio’s public radio stations makes clear, classical music remains a powerhouse that commands attention and drives decisions. From a deal in which it seems there were no losers, WCLV-FM has emerged a clear winner, landing a stronger frequency and a significantly larger potential audience…. Since July of 2001, the classical station formerly known as 95.5 has been broadcasting on 104.9, a limited frequency primarily serving the region’s West Side. That’s about to change in a big way in 2022. Under the terms of a new arrangement announced in September, WCPN-FM 90.3 will combine with WKSU-FM 89.7 to form a large newsroom broadcasting on both 89.7 and 104.9, a class A radio station. That leaves WCLV to 90.3, a class B station, which spans 22 counties … With a broader range, WCLV will be better able to cover arts events … Ross Binnie, chief brand officer of the Cleveland Orchestra, [said], ‘We are thrilled to know that WCLV will be on a stronger signal, so more people will have free access to live Cleveland Orchestra performances.’ ”\n\n“The Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra is going national in prime time, with help from Milwaukee PBS,” writes Chris Foran in Monday’s (12/13) Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Milwaukee PBS’s broadcast of the symphony’s Oct. 2 performance—the grand-opening weekend of the symphony’s new home, the Bradley Symphony Center—has been picked up by the national PBS for airing on Dec. 17. ‘Live From Bradley Symphony Center: Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra’ will air in Milwaukee at 8 p.m. Dec. 17 on both WMVS-TV (Channel 10) and WMVT-TV (Channel 36). The grand opening weekend concerts, with MSO music director Ken-David Masur at the baton, included the world premiere of ‘Opening,’ a work by composer Eric Nathan commissioned to christen the symphony’s new home. Other pieces on the program included George Gershwin’s ‘Rhapsody in Blue’ and Duke Ellington’s ‘New World A-Comin’,’ both featuring guest pianist Aaron Diehl. In Milwaukee, ‘A Symphonic Celebration: The Milwaukee Symphony’s New Home,’ an in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at the symphony and the restored Bradley Symphony Center, will get a repeat showing before the concert at 7:30 p.m. Dec. 17 on both Channel 10 and 36.”\n\n“Some of the most enchanting sounds of the Christmas season come from beloved holiday movies,” writes Kimberly Richard in Saturday’s (12/11) KXAS-TV (Dallas/Fort Worth). “The Dallas Symphony Orchestra will feature these nostalgic melodies with its ‘Hollywood Holidays’ concert series … December 17-19, Richard Kaufman, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra’s Pops Conductor Laureate, will conduct the concert series. Kaufman has devoted much of his career to the music of film and television…. Kaufman began studying the violin at age seven… He played in studios, recording with Ray Charles, Burt Bacharach and Henry Mancini…. ‘I was in my early 20s when I played on Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Those were incredible experiences playing the music and, of course, working with John Williams,’ Kaufman said. In 1984, Kaufman became the Music Coordinator in the Music Department of Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer Studios. For the next 18 years, he supervised music for all MGM television and animation projects…. For Kaufman, the great Christmas present of this concert series is working with the musicians of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. ‘The DSO musicians … bring the same dedication and quality to the performance of film music as they do to the great classical repertoire,’ Kaufman said.”\n\n“Three conductors are slated to make a joint debut in the San Francisco Symphony’s orchestral series next year, sharing conducting duties for the program that was originally scheduled to be led by the late Michael Morgan,” writes Joshua Kosman in Friday’s (12/10) San Francisco Chronicle. “Earl Lee, Daniel Bartholomew-Poyser and Akiko Fujimoto are scheduled to each conduct part of the program set for Feb. 17-19, which was planned by the longtime Oakland Symphony music director before he died on Aug. 20. Fujimoto, music director of the Mid-Texas Symphony in Seguin, Texas, will conduct the first Symphony performance of Florence Price’s Symphony No. 3, which Morgan had introduced to Bay Area audiences in Oakland in 2019. Lee, an assistant conductor with the Boston Symphony, will conduct Carlos Simon’s ‘Amen!’ and César Franck’s ‘Le Chasseur maudit,’ and Bartholomew-Poyser—the orchestra’s recently named resident conductor of engagement and education—will conduct Brahms’ ‘Alto Rhapsody’ and a group of spirituals featuring mezzo-soprano Melody Wilson.”\n\n“Students and faculty members from the Afghanistan National Institute of Music arrived with their families Monday in Portugal, where they are being granted asylum and where they hope to rebuild their acclaimed school,” writes Barry Hatton in Tuesday’s (12/14) Associated Press. “The 273-person group, including some 150 students, flew into Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, from Doha, Qatar. Their departure from Afghanistan was staggered in five airlifts … ‘The arrival of the (institute’s) community today means that the first and most important step of saving lives and insuring freedom is now over,’ said the institute’s founder and director, Dr. Ahmad Sarmast. Governments and corporate and private donors met the group’s evacuation and resettlement expenses…. The musicians are among tens of thousands of Afghans … who have fled since Taliban fighters seized Afghanistan in August … Many musicians fear for their futures under the Taliban, which rules according to a harsh interpretation of Islamic law. The Afghanistan National Institute of Music, founded in 2010 … became a symbol of a new Afghanistan, with boys and girls studying together and performing to full houses in the United States and Europe…. The plan is to recreate the school in Portugal, allowing the students to continue their educations.”\n\nPhiladelphia’s Curtis Institute of Music and the 92nd Street Y (92Y) in New York City have embarked on a collaboration entitled Curtis at 92Y, in which Curtis faculty and alumni will perform concerts and teach young students and adults at 92Y. Adult education classes taught by Curtis faculty and alumni will begin on January 19, 2022 with a multi-session, online adult education course taught by Jonathan Coopersmith, chair of musical studies at Curtis. Additional performances by Curtis musicians at 92Y are planned in fall 2022. Curtis and 92Y are developing educational activities around Curtis on Tour appearances on 92Y’s concert series for students enrolled in 92Y’s School of Music and 92Y’s Center for Arts Learning & Leadership, which pre-pandemic served over 15,000 primarily under-resourced New York City public school students in-person, and now has expanded online. In summer 2022, selected students from 92Y’s Recanati-Kaplan Program for Excellence in the Arts will study with Curtis alumni teaching artists in a new online instruction and mentorship program. The Recanati-Kaplan program offers merit-based scholarships for gifted students and offers individualized instruction, advanced classes, and mentoring.\n\nLatinx ticket buyers at orchestras increased from 8.7% in 2019 to 10.6% in 2021, according to the latest report from TRG Arts and Purple Seven in partnership with the League of American Orchestras. In the 2020 Census, more than half of the total U.S. population growth in the last decade came from growth in the Hispanic or Latino population. On Tuesday, December 14, 3:00pm Eastern/Noon Pacific, the League will present “Engaging the Latinx Community,” a 60-minute webinar led by Arts Consulting Group that explores the changing demographics and opportunities with the growing Latinx community. The webinar will include case study examples from the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the San Francisco Symphony as well as recommendations for inclusive practices and actionable insights from the LatinXperience Study.\n\n“Engaging the Latinx Community” takes place on Tuesday, December 14, 3:00pm Eastern/Noon Pacific. A recording will be available after the live event. The League is offering 50% off registrations to staff of NYC arts organizations, thanks to the Howard Gilman Foundation and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council.

After Chopin’s death in October 1849, the piano was bought by his Scottish student and friend, Jane Stirling, who then offered it to Chopin’s eldest sister, Ludwika Jedrzejewiczowa. The piano arrived in Warsaw in 1850…. It survived two world wars…. Texas-born McNulty says this is the ‘best preserved Pleyel piano in the world,’ despite having quite a dramatic history…. McNulty and museum authorities believe the current work will bring it as close as possible to the sound that Chopin heard…. The instrument will serve as a resource for research and maybe as a model for a replica, but is not intended for performances.”"
