The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:02 a.m. in room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria Cantwell, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON Senator Cantwell. Good morning, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation will come to order, and we're having a full Committee meeting this morning on the future of radio. We are joined by Carol Pierson, President and CEO of National Federation of Community Broadcasters, welcome. Ms. Dana Davis Rehm, Senior Vice President for Strategy and Partnerships from NPR, thank you for being here. Mr. S. Derek Turner, Research Director for the Free Press, thank you very much. Mr. Tim Westergren, Chief Strategy Officer and Co-Founder of Pandora Media, I'm sure we're going to hear more about what that is, thank you. And, Mr. Mac McCaughan, Founder of Merge Records, and member of Superchunk, and Mr. Russell Withers, Founder and Owner of Withers Broadcasting, on behalf of the National Association of Broadcasters. Welcome, all. This morning we are scheduled to have a vote at 11:00 which may be followed by a couple of votes, so I'm going to forego my opening statement and submit it to the record so that we might hear from you, and maybe even get to a question and answer period before that. But I'll see if any of my colleagues wish to do the same, or to make an opening statement. [The prepared statement of Senator Cantwell follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Maria Cantwell, U.S. Senator from Washington I want to welcome everyone to the hearing on the future of radio. I want to thank Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Stevens for calling this important hearing. Radio remains a vital means to inform and educate listeners throughout the country as well as serving to entertain them. Today, consumers have an overwhelming number of choices on how to spend their leisure time. Radio is but one among many choices consumers have and over-the-air radio broadcast is but only one means for distributing audio programming to listeners. There is also satellite radio, Internet radio, podcasts on iPods and MP3 players, as well as downloads on wireless phones. Consumers also can receive audio channels with subscriptions to cable or satellite television service. And they can always listen to CDs or old cassettes and albums. As the lines of traditional radio get blurred and the digital delivery of audio programming occurs over an increasing number of platforms, consumers will have more choices than they know what to do with as to what they listen to, how they listen to it, when they listen to it, and where they listen to it. But it is not going to all happen overnight. Unlike the transition to digital television, the transition to digital radio is voluntary. And there are still critical details that need to be worked through. For that reason alone, terrestrial radio will continue to play an essential role for a considerable time to come. Ultimately, I see these different audio platforms as complementing each other rather than competing with one another. The value of terrestrial radio in fulfilling the Commission's mission in promoting ``competition, diversity, and localism'' can't be understated. But unfortunately, the 1996 Telecom Act brought about massive radio industry consolidation, a loss of localism, and a lack of programming diversity. A recent bright spot, though, has been Low Power FM radio. These community-based, non-commercial radio stations create hours of original local programming, can tailor their services to niche populations, and are an inexpensive means of adding another voice to a consolidated radio market. After the FCC did its due diligence on potential interference, it launched the new Low Power FM service in 2000. A rider to an appropriations bill later that year, made a technical change to the FCC rule and required additional testing, effectively limiting the service from being licensed in more populated areas. Those additional tests by an outside lab cost the taxpayer millions of dollars and came up with the same conclusion as the FCC. Senator McCain and I have introduced legislation in the last three Congresses to try and set things right. And as we look ahead, we must also take stock of where we have been. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 lifted all nationwide ownership limits for radio station broadcasters, and permitted a single entity to own and operate as many as eight stations in the Nation's largest markets. Three years later, the FCC relaxed its television-radio cross- ownership rule. This was followed in 2003, by the FCC replacing its rules prohibiting newspaper-broadcast cross ownership as well as its 1999 local television-radio cross ownership rule, with a single rule on cross media limits. As we all know these specific rules were remanded by the Third Circuit Court in Philadelphia, and never went into effect. Last year, the Commission began the process for reviewing all of the remanded rules as well as conducting its required periodic review of media ownership rules. A number of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns how the Commission has conducted the review to date. At times, I have the impression that the Chairman has his answer, particularly with respect to eliminating the existing media cross ownership rules, and this whole process is all about checking off the necessary boxes rather than getting at the facts. I hope that is not the case. Based on statements made by Chairman Martin, it appears that he wants to wrap the proceeding up and issue rules by this December 18th. I think this would be a major miscalculation on his part. I want to assure Chairman Martin that people really care about media ownership. I know people back home in Washington State do. And they take every opportunity to tell me so. I hope that Chairman Martin will not short circuit the process. I look forward to hearing from the panel. STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA Senator Dorgan. Madam Chair, let me take just a minute and a half. Because of the time problem, I will be very brief. But, I want to say that I think this is a very important hearing. I'm a cosponsor of the Local Community Radio Act which deals with Low Power FM, I'm a cosponsor of the Internet Radio Equality Act. I've opposed the merger of satellite radio companies XM and Sirius. There's a lot to talk about with respect to the future of radio. But I want to talk just for 1 minute, especially about the proposed FCC proceedings, with respect to the concentration of ownership, that is, relaxing the ownership limits on broadcasters--radio and television--and also allowing cross- ownership of newspapers. Senator Trent Lott and I, we're having a press conference at noon today on that subject. But, I think those listening and those paying attention to the FCC should understand they're going to be in for a huge battle, if they think they're going to go now and begin, between now and the middle of December, relax the ownership limits on television and radio that has already had dramatic concentration--far more than is healthy for this country--and then at the same time, allow cross-ownership with newspapers. I just want people to understand, the FCC is going to be in for a big fight if it caves in to the interests that are pushing them to relax ownership rules, that is not in the interests of this country. So, I wanted to make that point. But, I know this is about radio, and I appreciate having the hearing. Senator Cantwell. Senator McCaskill, do you wish to make an opening statement? STATEMENT OF HON. CLAIRE McCASKILL, U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI Senator McCaskill. Briefly, Madam Chair, I agree with many of the things that Senator Dorgan has indicated. I, particularly, have heart palpitations about the idea that one company--having more spectrum than the entire FM band--I mean, just think about that. One company, having more spectrum than the entire FM band. And one national company with more channels than its local competition combined, in every market in America. I think those things are something that we need to be very focused on, I think it is our job to speak for those people out there that we don't hear, and there are a lot of people out there whose voices we don't hear in the halls of Congress. And, I think it's important that we do that, and I think this hearing is an important part of that, and I look forward to the testimony. Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, and again, welcome to the witnesses who are here to have a hearing on the future of radio. Mr. McCaughan, I think we'll start with you, and just go right down the line. And if people could keep their comments to 5 minutes, we are going to have a timer on this morning. But if you could keep track, and obviously we'll accept longer statements and information for the record. But, again, welcome Mr. McCaughan, thank you for being here. STATEMENT OF MAC McCAUGHAN, MUSICIAN AND CO-FOUNDER, MERGE RECORDS Mr. McCaughan. Madam Chair and Members of the Committee, it's an honor to testify before you today at such a crucial hearing. My name is Mac McCaughan, the Co-Founder of Merge Records, which is an independent record label, we're based in North Carolina. And, we've released over 300 albums from 60 different bands over the past 20 years. I'm also a musician and a songwriter with 11 full-length records released by my band Superchunk, 6 albums that I've recorded under the name Portastatic--and I'd like to apologize in advance for needing to refer to my notes today, I'm used to performing on stage, but I can, I have a memory for song lyrics, but I hope you trust me when I say, you do not want to hear me sing my testimony this morning. [Laughter.] Mr. McCaughan. Radio has always been important to me, in fact, I think it has a lot to do with why I sit here today. Unlike any other medium, I think radio fosters a direct relationship between music and the listener. As a kid, I went to sleep and woke up to the radio, and that was at a time when even album rock radio featured music that was chosen by the DJ--new records, his or her favorite new records. Around the age of 13, I began listening to college radio, which exposed me to all different kinds of music that you can never hear on Top 40 or album rock stations. And that music, that I discovered via college radio, really set me on the course of making music myself, and eventually starting a record label, which is Merge. As both a performer and a label owner, I've relied on radio as an essential component of the work that we do in getting our music out there to people who want to hear it. I come here today to offer my perspective on the current state, and possible future, of broadcasting, and I urge you to adopt policies that encourage localism, competition and diversity on the airwaves. I'd like first to talk about the value of community-based and noncommercial radio. Low power, college, NPR, and other noncommercial broadcasting enterprises are extremely important today, especially as local information and entertainment options become more scarce. Commercial radio is about aggregating the largest possible number of listeners in a targeted demographic, but community-based radio is about serving its audiences. It has a unique power and desire to be a conduit for news and culture, and is essential to the diversity that defines cultural life in this country. As a record label owner, I can tell you that noncommercial radio has been a leading source of support for the music that we release, and we would not have had the chance to introduce many of our artists to music listeners and build such a dedicated customer base without the help of noncommercial radio. Broadcasters such as KEXP, KCMP, KCRW, WXPN and in North Carolina, WXYC and WXTU continue to program a wide variety of independent and local music on the dial, in the community and on the web. And WXYC in Chapel Hill, incidentally, was the first radio station, 10 years ago, to begin broadcasting over the Internet, 24 hours. For a label like ours, and many other musicians out there, support of noncommercial radio which is programmed by people as passionate about music as we are, is essential. Congress should take action to allow for the growth of noncommercial radio, and the expansion of Low Power FM into more urban settings. In 2000, Congress passed legislation to limit the FCC's ability to issue noncommercial Low Power FM radio licenses in more populated communities across the country. And lifting this ban once and for all will lead to a significant expansion of community-based stations that will prioritize local and independent content and news, not to mention programming that highlights the kind of musical genres that are routinely ignored by commercial radio. I also want to urge this Committee to take the necessary steps to ensure that our media landscape does not become even more consolidated. The deregulation that followed the 1996 Telecommunications Act allowed for unprecedented consolidation in commercial radio which has resulted in homogeneity, is often out of step with artists, entrepreneurs, media professionals, and educators, not to mention the listeners. Back before the Telecom Act, this commercial radio industry was much more competitive. DJs and programmers in markets around the country were eager to play new music. This big piece of rock history is no longer, as corporate radio's sense of adventurism, localism, and risk-taking is a thing of the past. Nowadays, you are much more likely to hear new, independent music in a TV show, in a car commercial, in a video game, on satellite radio or community radio station than on commercial radio. Although label owners, artists and listeners would be thrilled to hear more independent music on commercial radio, in most cases this chance simply does not exist. As a specific example, from our experience at Merge, two of the albums that we've released in 2007 by the bands Arcade Fire and Spoon both debuted on the Billboard Top Ten. The bands both played on Saturday Night Live, which is a real coup for bands on a label of our size, and the mainstream print media has written extensively about them. Both bands tour the world, playing highly successful, sold-out concerts. Spoon performed here in D.C. last night at a sold out show at the 9:30 Club, which was broadcast on NPR, yet both of these bands have been virtually absent from the commercial airwaves throughout the trajectory of their careers. Instead, it's been noncommercial radio that has played a leading role in helping these bands reach a mainstream audience, just like it does with a majority of our other artists, bands like Camera Obscura, M. Ward, The Clientele, North Carolina's own Rosebuds. Because the independent music community's business model focuses on selling tens of thousands of albums instead of millions, Merge and other independent labels can rely on a combination of noncommercial radio and the Internet for promotion and distribution. But if Congress and the FCC implement policies that open up commercial radio for independent artists and labels, it could change the economics of the independent sector and the culture at large. It's been widely reported that the FCC is considering altering the media ownership rules again, and loosening the local ownership caps to allow major radio groups to buy even more stations in each market. And no matter what your taste in entertainment or news, if you value localism, competition and diversity, Congress and the FCC must recognize that further deregulation is not the answer. Finally, I'd like to talk about the value of the Internet-- -- Senator Cantwell. Mr. McCaughan, you're a little over your time. It's like, you know, song length. Mr. McCaughan. OK, sure. Senator Cantwell. So, if you could--we're interested in all that you have to say, kind of summarize and then we'll get onto our other panelists, and then we can take the rest of your testimony for the record. Mr. McCaughan. OK, great. Senator Cantwell. Thank you. Mr. McCaughan. I was going to summarize by saying that the Internet is incredibly important to a label like Merge, for getting our music out there, exposing it to people, and you know, we'd like to keep the information flowing and keep technology growing without resorting to the old bottleneck that would be created by a tiered Internet, things such as this. To conclude, artists who thrive outside the commercial realm depend on and deserve open access to public platforms such as the airwaves and the Internet. Likewise, communities and citizens should have access to localized and diverse media. This is not just a means of doing business, but also an important facet of American life that needs to be nurtured and protected. I'd like thank Chairman Inouye and the Members of the Committee for taking the time to consider these issues, and it's my hope that those involved in the decisionmaking process on these issues can take something from the statements I have made. I would be happy to answer your questions after the testimony. [The prepared statement of Mr. McCaughan follows:] Prepared Statement of Mac McCaughan, Co-Founder, Merge Records Chairman Inouye, Senator Stevens and members of the Committee, it is an honor to testify before you today at such a crucial hearing.

Nowadays, you are much more likely to hear new independent music in a TV show, in a car commercial, in a video game, on satellite radio or community radio stations than on commercial radio.

No matter what your tastes in entertainment or news, if you value localism, competition and diversity, Congress and the FCC must recognize that further deregulation is not the answer. Finally, I'd like to talk about the value of the Internet. Given that Merge Records and artists we represent have had little access to commercial radio, the Internet has become a powerful new platform through which we can promote, distribute and sell our music. Credit must go to non-commercial broadcasters and NPR, which are leading the way in using technologies to offer new content delivery methods such as webcasting and live concert feeds, in addition to their regular programming, but that's not all. An exciting range of emerging technologies such as Internet radio, satellite radio, music subscription services, digital music stores and new webcast services like Mog, Pandora and Last.fm that have expanded the opportunities for independent bands and labels worldwide. Not just our label, but any label and artist should have the benefit of competing on an equal playing field, as new technologies emerge that help musicians connect with audiences. An Internet based on the principles of network neutrality allows these experiments in commerce and technology to grow. Any policy decision that enables the reestablishment of old bottlenecks or creates a tiered Internet would be a tremendous step backward. To conclude, artists who thrive outside of the commercial realm depend on and deserve open access to public platforms such as the airwaves and the Internet. Likewise, communities and citizens should have access to localized and diverse media. This is not just a means of doing business, but also an important facet of American life that needs to be nurtured and protected. I want to thank Chairman Inouye and the members of this committee for taking the time to consider the issues surrounding community access to broadcasting and other important media concerns. It is my hope that those involved in the decision-making on these issues can take something from the statements I have made. Thank you for inviting me to testify today. I will be happy to answer your questions. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. McCaughan. Mr. Withers? STATEMENT OF W. RUSSELL WITHERS, JR., FOUNDER AND OWNER, WITHERS BROADCASTING COMPANIES, ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BROADCASTERS Mr. Withers. Good morning, Chairman Inouye, and members of the Committee, my name is Russ Withers, I'm the Owner of Withers Broadcasting Companies, which operates 30 local radio stations and 6 television stations in 7 states, including Missouri and West Virginia. I'm testifying on behalf of the National Association of Broadcasters where I serve as Chairman of the NAB Radio Board and a member of the Executive Committee. Radio's future is very bright, and I'll offer a perspective today from over 50 years working in radio, on a variety of issues, among them Low Power FM, media ownership and copyright fees. First, with respect to Low Power FM. Broadcasters strongly support the current third adjacent channel protection and have serious concerns with introducing thousands of micro-radio stations to the FM band. Broadcasters do not oppose licensing Low Power FM, in fact, the FCC has authorized 811 Low Power FM operators, others have received construction permits or have applications pending at the FCC, and we encourage the Commission to act on these within the existing policy. LPFM stations exist today within third adjacent protection for a reason, and that's to guard against interference to both LPFMs and full-power stations. With respect to media ownership, let me also be clear. Broadcasters are not asking for total deregulation. Our message is simple: We must have reasonable rules that reflect the current competitive radio environment. With reasonable rules, we can have a vibrant industry that will continue to provide the service that our local communities expect--whether that's lifeline service in times of emergency, or entertainment and informational programming every day. Some will argue that the changes to the broadcast ownership rules adopted in the 1996 Telecom Act have not served the public interest, but they forget that at least part of the reason that you, here in Congress, directed the FCC to make those changes, was because the fragmented broadcast industry-- particularly for radio--was in serious trouble. In the early 1990s, the FCC reported that more than half of all stations were losing money, and almost 300 stations had gone silent. You can't serve the public interests with no service. Since 1996, however, numerous studies have shown that the changes within local broadcast markets, especially among radio stations, have enhanced the diversity of programming offered by local stations, and another study demonstrated that localism is still alive and well, despite the rule changes. There are more radio stations today in the United States than at any time in our history. Despite claims that the radio industry has been swallowed up by a few corporate giants, there are more than 4,490 different owners of the approximately 13,500 full-power stations in this country, and according to the FCC, more than 6,498 of those are locally owned. I can assure you that I and my fellow broadcasters are on the job every day, serving and contributing to our communities. You need only look at the California wildfires this morning, as evidence of our commitment. We need reasonable ownership rules to allow us to keep providing the service. Turning now to the issue of copyright fees. The NAB supports legislation to vacate the Copyright Royalty Board decision, and to establish new rules for Internet streaming of music. The CRB decision earlier this year caused serious harm in two ways. First, the cost for radio stations to stream music will drastically increase, and second, the new CRB rates are a barrier to entry for many stations that want to be part of the Internet revolution. We support a new and fair rate structure that encourages Internet streaming. We've made attempts to work with the recording industry to reach compromise, and were left waiting 92 days for an answer. As a result of their stonewalling, we all face a very uncertain future for what was becoming a growing and exciting platform for music. Lastly, Mr. Chairman, I want to address the issue of performance fees, and the attempts by the recording industry to impose what broadcasters consider to be a performance tax on local radio. Local radio and the performing industry have always enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship that can be distilled down to one concept--free music for free promotion. Local radio offers the recording industry a listening audience of 232 million listeners a week, to promote and expose music. That drives consumers to go buy music, attend concerts, and purchase artist merchandise. Now, with slowing sales, and arguably a flawed business model for the digital age, the recording industry is looking to recoup their waning revenues through a performance tax on local radio broadcasters. Local radio, however, is not the reason the recording industry is suffering from declining profits, and local radio should not be used as a bail-out fund. Radio broadcasters will fight this tax to preserve a local radio system that remains free, essential and available to all consumers. Thank you for inviting me here today, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Withers follows:] Prepared Statement of W. Russell Withers, Jr., Founder and Owner, Withers Broadcasting Companies, on Behalf of the National Association of Broadcasters Good morning, Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, and members of the Committee, my name is W. Russell Withers, Jr., I am the Founder and Owner of the Withers Broadcasting Companies, which own and operate 30 local radio stations and six television stations in seven states.

NAB is a trade association that advocates on behalf of more than 8,300 free, local radio and television stations and also broadcast networks before Congress, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other Federal agencies, and the courts. This is a hearing about the future of the radio industry, so let me start with a simple fact: radio, as an industry, is not the same as it was 10 years ago, 20 years ago or 40 years ago. I have been a part of this industry for more than 50 years, and I have watched the media industry change. How people listen to music has changed. How they receive and engage with the news has changed. And for radio owners like myself, the competitive pressures are very different. Originally, we used to just compete with each other, and maybe a few local newspapers. Those days are long gone. Now, radio stations are competing for the same advertising dollars as television, cable, newspapers, Internet sites and huge Internet aggregators like Google. Even in the face of these changes and competitive pressures, however, my industry has not, and will not, forget that our primary task is service to the community. Our core product--top-quality music, news, local information, weather and emergency services for our local communities provided without charge--remains much the same. We are there for our local communities every day. We are there to help inform our communities when weather or other emergencies occur. And, importantly, we are there to help when the emergency is over. Unlike some national entities that show up to report disasters and such, we don't leave--we remain part of the community when the effects of the disaster linger on and on. In fact, broadcasters contribute more than ten billion dollars in community service every year. In short, you would be hard pressed to find an industry that contributes more to their local communities than broadcasters. There are some other interests that will try to tell you a different story. Some vocal groups regularly contend that the radio industry in this country has been swallowed up by a few corporate giants who do not care about the communities they serve. Well, here is another fact: there are more radio stations today in the United States than at any point previously. In fact, despite all the boisterous complaints about media consolidation, there are more radio station owners today than there were in 1972. Sure there are some large companies, as there are in any industry worth investing in. But, there are also thousands of other radio station owners. And we all serve our local communities. Media Ownership As a radio owner, I can tell you that we need to have reasonable media ownership rules. The rules that govern this industry should reflect the undeniable changes in the media marketplace. It is easy to see the past through rose colored glasses. But everyday, radio stations owners like myself have to deal with reality. And the reality is that outdated regulations can hold us back from competing with industries that are not regulated like ours. You here in Congress recognized the relationship between reasonable rules and a healthy radio industry back in 1996 when you mandated reform of the highly restrictive ownership rules then in place. Remember the state of the broadcast industry before 1996. In 1992, for example, the FCC found that, due to ``market fragmentation,'' many in the radio industry were ``experiencing serious economic stress.'' Revision of Radio Rules and Policies, Report and Order, 7 FCC Rcd 2755, 2756 (1992) (FCC Radio Order). Specifically, stations were experiencing ``sharp decrease[s]'' in operating profits and operating margins. Id. at 2759. By the early 1990s, ``more than half of all stations'' were losing money, and ``almost 300 radio stations'' had gone silent. Id. at 2760. Given that the radio industry's ability ``to function in the `public interest, convenience and necessity' is fundamentally premised on its economic viability,'' the Commission concluded that ``radio's ability to serve the public interest'' had become ``substantially threatened.'' Id. Accordingly, the Commission believed that it was ``time to allow the radio industry to adapt'' to the modern information marketplace, ``free of artificial constraints that prevent valuable efficiencies from being realized.'' Id. Congress agreed. That is why, in 1996, you acted to ``preserve and to promote the competitiveness of over-the-air broadcast stations.'' \\1\\ Congress found that ``significant changes'' in the ``audio and video marketplace'' called for a ``substantial reform of Congressional and Commission oversight of the way the broadcasting industry develops and competes.'' House Report at 54-55. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ H.R. Rep No. 204, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. at 48 (1995) (``House Report''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I submit that we should not ignore these important lessons of the past. Policies that would turn back the clock so that broadcasters are at a competitive disadvantage against other information and entertainment providers clearly would not serve the public interest. Like any industry, radio has to adapt to the changes in the marketplace. We are embracing new technologies and new plans to remain relevant in our local communities for decades to come. We are embracing the future by investing significant financial and human resources in new technologies, including high definition digital radio or, HD Radio, and Internet streaming, so that we can continue to compete in a digital marketplace and improve our service to local communities and listeners. All we ask is that the policies you adopt here in Washington recognize the reality that we face. Let us embrace the future--resist the calls of those who would embalm us in the past. XM and Sirius Merger This Committee has held a hearing and heard perspectives on the proposed merger of XM Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio. We'd like to thank the many Members of Congress who have opposed this proposed merger-to-monopoly. A monopoly in satellite radio would clearly harm consumers by inviting subscription price increases, stifling innovation and reducing program diversity. This monopoly would jeopardize the valuable free over-the-air, advertiser-supported services provided by local radio stations and their ability to serve local communities and audiences. All local stations ask is for a fair opportunity to compete in today's digital marketplace on a level playing field. Low Power FM Stations Let me focus for a minute on another subject that I am sure you will hear about today--Low Power FM (LPFM) broadcasting. I will speak about two issues: the relationship between LPFM and full power FM service and the relationship between LPFM and FM translators. Regarding the former, local broadcasters oppose S. 1675, the Local Community Radio Act of 2007. We believe this legislation would allow the FCC to license thousands of micro-radio stations that will cause harmful interference to full power FM radio stations providing valuable services to local communities and listeners. The proposed bill is based on the results of a well-intentioned, but fatally flawed study intended to determine the amount of interference these new micro-radio stations would cause. That study, however, was deficient in its methodology, implementation and analysis of results in assessing the need for third adjacent channel interference protection. To the contrary, multiple studies commissioned by NAB, the Consumer Electronics Association and others have all independently concluded that removal of the current adjacent channel protections is not practical because receivers will not be able to adequately reject the undesired signals that would be created. Today, under its current policy, the FCC has licensed over 811 LPFM stations around the country, and with many additional granted construction permits and applications still pending at the FCC. Broadcasters have encouraged the FCC to act on any pending LPFM applications and facilitate those that have received construction permits. Clearly, there is already an efficient process in place for LPFM stations to be licensed and to operate within the current third adjacent protection policy that all stations, both low power and full power, must follow. To be clear, local broadcasters do not oppose the licensing of LPFM stations. However, we do oppose the introduction of thousands of micro- radio stations that would cause significant harmful interference to existing full power FM radio stations. Third adjacent protection for all broadcasters exists for a reason--to guard against interference and to protect our lifeline service to communities. Reducing interference protection for subsequently-authorized full power FM service could also deny thousands of listeners the benefits of FM station upgrades or new FM services, including digital radio. Often lost amid the clamor for more LPFM stations is the fact that full power FM stations provide vast amounts of community-responsive public service. FM stations are a primary source for local news and information, political discourse, music programming in a wide variety of formats and emergency information. And these valuable services will only increase in the future, as more stations convert to digital and offer CD-quality audio, additional free programming streams and new services such as datacasting. We believe that, instead of risking significant interference to full power local FM stations, government should focus its efforts on creating constructive means by which an operating LPFM station that is displaced by new or upgraded full power FM service can be relocated without creating harmful interference. Such means could include granting the displaced LPFM station priority and expedited processing over other LPFM applications without the need for opening an application window. Indeed, the FCC has already granted such displacement relief in the context of low power television, and given the minimal number of LPFM stations in this situation, we would encourage that this type of relief be examined first, before other more problematic avenues are explored. With regard to FM translators, local broadcasters do not favor an approach where LPFM stations are granted preferential treatment over FM translators. Since the FCC first authorized FM translators in 1970 as a means of delivering radio service to areas and populations that were unable to receive FM signals because of distance and terrain obstacles, translators have proven to be a vital component for delivering essential news, weather, emergency information and AMBER Alerts, as well as entertainment to many communities. The FCC's current system of assigning FM frequencies on a first- come first-served basis has worked well, and there is no reason to think it will not continue to work well in the future. Affording preferential treatment to new LPFM stations would jeopardize FM stations' delivery of important, locally-oriented programming to many parts of the country via FM translators. Broadcasters have also urged the FCC to lift the freeze on pending FM translator applications and quickly process these applications. In 2003, the FCC imposed a freeze on the processing of FM translator applications presumably because granting translator licenses might adversely affect the licensing of future LPFM stations. Nothing could be farther from the truth, however. LPFM and translators are not mutually exclusive and both can be viable services alongside each other. As mentioned, broadcasters do not oppose the licensing of LPFM stations. We recognize that some of these stations may provide niche programming to local communities. However, that does not diminish the fact that FM translators are important tools that local full power broadcasters need to provide a full complement of diverse, quality programming to listeners throughout the country, especially in remote areas. The FCC has explicitly recognized that translators ``provide an opportunity to import programming formats otherwise unavailable'' in local markets. In this light, the valuable service that translators provide should be recognized and fostered. In sum, there is no demonstrated need for a change in regulatory priority status between LPFM stations and FM translators. Pending applications for FM translators have not impeded the FCC's ability to process LPFM applications under the existing rules. Moreover, to the extent that parties are urging Congress to change the law to enable LPFM stations to be placed on channels spaced third adjacent to full power FM stations, we would strongly encourage Congress to reject these calls. Internet Streaming Let me turn now to the issue of Internet streaming. A few moments ago, I mentioned Internet streaming as one way broadcasters can adapt their traditional business models to include new technologies that complement local free over-the-air radio. Unfortunately, current conditions make this difficult. Broadcasters are required to pay sound recording performance fees when they stream their signals on the Internet. However, the most recent rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) for these fees are so high that a viable business model for simulcast streaming is almost impossible. The increase in the sound recording performance fees over the next 4 years established by the CRB is unreasonable and debilitating to growing this exciting new service. There are numerous and serious flaws in the CRB's decision, but let me mention just two of them. First, the CRB gave no credit to radio broadcasters for the tremendous promotional value we provide to the recording companies and artists. This is a major factor in record sales and revenues from concerts. Second, the CRB based the rates it established on rates paid to the recording industry by interactive webcasting services that provide the ability to purchase recordings online. We believe there are fundamental differences between such services and the free advertiser-supported services broadcasters provide. This subject falls primarily within the purview of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and thus I will not dwell on it today. It is, however, very important for the future of radio, so let me briefly emphasize that the sound recording performance fee for Internet streaming--and the standard by which it is set--must be reformed. NAB supports H.R. 2060 and S. 1353 which would vacate the CRB decision, establish an interim royalty rate structure and change the current ``willing buyer, willing seller'' standard that has been a recipe for abuse and needlessly inflated royalty rates to levels that are suffocating radio streaming services. In fact, the ``willing buyer, willing seller'' standard has given rise to a presumption in favor of agreements negotiated by the major recording companies, acting under the antitrust exemption contained in the Copyright Act. The predictable result has been unreasonably high sound recording fees. In addition, the conditions imposed on broadcasters that stream should be modified. The statutory performance license imposed nine conditions on broadcasters that stream, at least three of which are wholly incompatible with broadcasters' over-the-air business model. For example, one condition prohibits the playing of any three tracks from the same album within a three-hour period. Another condition prohibits DJs from ``pre-announcing'' songs, and a third requires the transmitting entity to use a player that displays in textual data the name of the sound recording, the featured artist and the name of the source phonorecord as it is being performed. These conditions are designed to prevent copying of sound recordings from distribution mechanisms far different than radio. Radio stations should not be forced to choose between either radically altering their over-the-air programming practices or risking uncertain and costly copyright infringement litigation. Performance Tax On a related subject, let me address the efforts of the recording industry to convince Congress to impose a new levy on local broadcasters, in the form of an additional fee for playing recorded music on free, over-the-air radio. The imposition of such a performance tax would be inequitable and unfair to radio broadcasters, and could substantially harm our ability to serve our local communities. Radio broadcasters already contribute substantially to the United States' complex and carefully balanced music licensing system, a system which has evolved over many decades and has enabled the U.S. to produce the strongest music, recording and broadcasting industries in the world. For more than 80 years, Congress, for a number of very good reasons, has rejected repeated calls by the recording industry to impose a tax on the public performance of sound recordings that would upset this balance. There is no reason to change this carefully considered and mutually beneficial policy at this time. As we noted in NAB's July 2007 testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property, the recording industry's pursuit of a performance tax at this time appears from losses that result in part from illegal peer-to-peer sharing of sound recordings, and in part from the loss of revenues from the sale of recorded music and an inability of record companies to timely adapt to rapid developments in digital technology and consumer demands. Broadcasters are not responsible for either one of these phenomena, and, particularly in the current highly competitive environment, it makes little sense to siphon revenues from local broadcasters to support international record labels. For decades, radio broadcasters have substantially compensated the music and recording industries, including making annual payments of hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to music composers and publishers through ASCAP, BMI and SESAC and providing record labels and artists with free promotion of their recordings and concerts. Local radio stations have been the driving force behind record sales in this country for generations. Music producers and publishers receive royalty payments from producers of sound recordings who record their works, but those sums are small relative to the receipts by the record companies and artists who receive the vast majority of their revenues from the sale of sound recordings. In fact, the recording industry enjoys tremendous promotional value from radio airplay. From recording industry executives: ``I have yet to see the big reaction you want to see to a hit until it goes on the radio. I'm a big, big fan of radio.''--Richard Palmese, Executive Vice President of Promotion RCA (2007) ``It's still the biggest way to break a band or sell records: airplay. It's very difficult to get it, but when it happens, it's amazing.''--Erv Karwelis, Idol Records (2007) ``Radio has proven itself time and time again to be the biggest vehicle to expose new music.''--Ken Lane, Senior Vice President for Promotion, Island Def Jam Music Group (2005) ``It is clearly the number one way that we're getting our music exposed. Nothing else affects retail sales the way terrestrial radio does.''--Tom Biery, Senior Vice President for Promotion, Warner Bros. Records (2005) ``If a song's not on the radio, it'll never sell.''--Mark Wright, Senior Vice President, MCA Records (2001) Throughout the history of the debate over sound recording copyrights, Congress has consistently recognized the important and very significant promotional benefit from the exposure by radio stations, as well as the fact that placing burdensome restrictions on performances could alter that relationship, to the detriment of the music, sound recording and broadcasting industries. For that reason, in the 1920s and for five decades following, Congress regularly considered proposals to grant copyright rights in sound recordings, but repeatedly rejected such proposals. When Congress first afforded limited copyright protection to sound recordings in 1971, it prohibited only unauthorized reproduction and distribution of records, but did not create a sound recording performance fee. During the comprehensive revision of the Copyright Act in 1976, Congress again considered, but rejected, granting a sound recording performance fee. Congress continued to refuse to provide any sound recording performance fee for another twenty years, not withstanding a plea by the recording industry in the early 1990s that it do so. During that time, the recording industry thrived, due in large measure to the promotional value of radio performances of their records.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 93-983, at 225-26 (1974) (``The financial success of recording companies and artists who contract with these companies is directly related to the volume of record sales, which, in turn, depends in great measure on the promotion efforts of broadcasters.''). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- It was not until the Digital Performance Rights in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 (DPRA) that even a limited performance fee in sound recordings was created. In granting this limited right, Congress stated it ``should do nothing to change or jeopardize the mutually beneficial economic relationship between the recording and traditional broadcasting industries.'' \\3\\ As explained in the Senate Report accompanying the bill, ``[t]he underlying rationale for creation of this limited right is grounded in the way the market for prerecorded music has developed, and the potential impact on that market posed by subscriptions and interactive services--but not by broadcasting and related transmissions.'' \\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ S. Rep. No. 104-129, at 15 (``1995 Senate Report''); accord, id. at 13 (Congress sought to ensure that extensions of copyright protection in favor of the recording industry did not ``upset[] the long-standing business relationships among record producers and performers, music composers and publishers and broadcasters that have served all of these industries well for decades.''). \\4\\ Id. at 17. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Consistent with Congress' intent, the DPRA expressly did not include a sound recording performance fee for non-subscription, non- interactive transmissions, including ``non-subscription broadcast transmission[s]''--transmission[s] made by FCC licensed radio broadcasters.\\5\\ Congress made clear that the reason radio broadcasting was not subject to this new limited fee was to preserve the historical, mutually beneficial relationship among recording companies, radio stations and music composers: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ 17 U.S.C. 114(d)(1)(A). The Committee, in reviewing the record before it and the goals of this legislation, recognizes that the sale of many sound recordings and careers of many performers have benefited considerably from airplay and other promotional activities provided by both noncommercial and advertiser-supported, free over-the-air broadcasting. The Committee also recognizes that the radio industry has grown and prospered with the availability and use of prerecorded music. This legislation should do nothing to change or jeopardize the mutually beneficial economic relationship between the recording and traditional broadcasting industries.\\6\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ 1995 Senate Report, at 15. The Senate Report similarly confirmed that ``[i]t is the Committee's intent to provide copyright holders of sound recordings with the ability to control the distribution of their product by digital transmissions, without hampering the arrival of new technologies, and without imposing new and unreasonable burdens on radio and television broadcasters, which often promote, and appear to pose no threat to, the distribution of sound recordings.'' \\7\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Proponents of a performance tax for sound recordings in the U.S. often point to the laws of foreign jurisdictions to justify imposing such an additional fee on local radio broadcasters. This argument ignores key differences in the American industry structure, and simplistic comparisons using isolated provisions of foreign laws yield misleading results. For example, many foreign legal systems deny protection to sound recordings as works of ``authorship,'' while affording producers and performers a measure of protection under so- called ``neighboring rights'' schemes. While that protection may be more generous in some respects than sound recording copyright in the U.S., including the right to collect royalties in connection with public performances, it is distinctly less generous in others. Additionally, in many neighboring rights jurisdictions the number of years sound recordings are protected is much shorter than under U.S. law. Further, broadcast systems in many other countries that have a performance tax are, or have been, owned or heavily subsidized by the government and have cultural and social mandates accompanied by content requirements. The recording industry's legitimate difficulties with piracy and its failure to adjust to the public's changing patterns and habits in how it chooses to acquire sound recordings was not a problem created by broadcasters, and broadcasters should not be required, through a tax or fee, to provide a new funding source to make up for lost revenues of the record companies. Indeed, the imposition of such a tax could create the perverse result of less music being played on radio or a weakened radio industry. For example, to save money or avoid the tax, stations could cut back on the amount of pre-recorded music they play or change formats to all-talk, providing less exposure to music. This could not only adversely impact the recording industry, but the music composers and publishers as well. A performance tax would have a particularly adverse impact on radio stations in small and medium-sized markets that are already struggling financially. Were such additional royalties imposed, in the face of competition from other media, many of these stations would have to spend more time in search of off-setting revenues that could affect the time available for public service announcements for charities and other worthy causes, coverage of local news and public affairs and other valuable programming. With respect to the performance of sound recordings on over-the-air broadcasting, NAB urges the Committee to recognize that a new performance tax on broadcasters is neither warranted nor equitable. The frustrations of the recording industry in its inability to deal with piracy and an outdated business model are not sufficient justification for imposing a wealth transfer at the expense of the American broadcast industry, which has been instrumental in creating hit after hit for record labels and artists and whose significant contributions to the music and recording industries have been consistently recognized by Congress over the decades. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the future of free over-the- air radio broadcasting is bright. Our commitment to our local communities, coupled with the momentum for consumers to realize the benefits of HD Radio, will propel our industry forward. But to do so, we must remain free from interference in our signals and from regulations that will hamper our ability to serve our local listeners. We look forward to working with this Committee and are happy to answer any questions you may have. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Withers for your testimony. And Mr. Westergren, before you start, I'm going to allow the Chairman, Chairman Inouye, to make an opening statement. STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII The Chairman. I thank you very much. I'd like to commend Senator Cantwell for taking the leadership in this area on radio. I suppose radio is not as sexy as Internet, or the other high-tech matters before us. I recall, as a child, I was brought up on the radio. I knew what time the fishes were running, I knew what time was best to surf. But today, with all of the consolidation, I wonder if less local news will be the result. I'm not suggesting it should all be local, but, I'm nostalgic, that's all. There are many issues before us, and I'm so happy that Senator Cantwell has come out with this bill. And so, we're looking to the future, and we're asking your help, because frankly there are so many things happening, we don't know where to go. I was one of the authors of the 1996 Act, at that time if you would search the text of the bill, you will find the word ``Internet'' appearing three times. That's how important it was--just three times out of thousands of words. Today, everywhere you go, it's the Internet. So, with that, thank you very much. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman for those comments, and the Chairman was referring to the legislation that we've introduced again on Low Power FM radio. Senator Snowe, did you wish to make an opening statement at this time? STATEMENT OF HON. OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE Senator Snowe. I do have one, and I ask unanimous consent to submit it for the record. Senator Cantwell. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Snowe follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Olympia J. Snowe, U.S. Senator from Maine Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing on the state of the radio industry. Even with the advent of new media, radio still plays a crucial role in our lives and while most of the attention has been toward Internet and broadband innovation as well as the DTV transition, radio too has seen it's share of impressive advancements. Radio is one of, if not, the most reliable form of communication today. Oftentimes during natural disasters and other emergencies, many forms of communications become unavailable to the public but over-the- air radio is a ubiquitous form of mass media that is available to nearly every car and household in the Nation. The system cannot be overloaded and operates well under extreme weather conditions. Radio has been meeting the demands of local communities for nearly a century and is equipped to continue its service well into the next century. To meet that service, radio has evolved with the introduction of satellite, Internet, and even hybrid-digital or ``HD'' radio. The birth of satellite radio less than a decade ago has been a boon to consumers looking for increased variety in music, sports and talk programming. Never before have consumers had access to over one hundred streams of programming in a radio service. Satellite radio has served its niche well. Internet radio has also seen an amazing growth in popularity. Just last year Internet radio listening jumped dramatically, from 45 million listeners to 72 million listeners per month and more than seven million Americans listen to Internet radio every day. The SHOUTcast radio website, which enables users to ``tune-in'' to thousands of online radio stations around the world, has access to approximately 21,000 online radio stations. But probably the most significant advancement in radio broadcasting since the introduction of FM stereo more than 50 years ago has been ``HD'' radio. HD Radio technology enables AM and FM radio stations to broadcast their programs digitally an in doing so greatly improving audio quality for its listeners--FM radio achieves near CD-quality sound. Digital signals are also less vulnerable to reception problems and eliminate the static, pops, hisses, and fades caused by interference. More than 1,500 radio stations are currently broadcasting in HD. But with all this innovation there are areas that we should investigate further. We must look at how we can promote minority and women ownership within media. Currently only 6 percent of full-power commercial broadcast radio stations are owned by women and 7.7 percent are owned by minorities. But yet for general, non-farm business, women and minorities account for 28 and 18 percent ownership, respectively. The FCC has reported that nearly all of the broadcast stations with majority women and/or minority ownership are located in rural areas and small towns. The FCC is currently conducting six field hearings on media ownership and also held a hearing specifically on localism in my state of Maine. It was recently confirmed that the FCC Chairman has told the other Commissioners he wants to propose revised media ownership rules by November 13, provide a 28-day period for public comment, and vote on new rules on December 18. It is my belief that the 28-day comment period Chairman Martin is suggesting is inadequate for comprehensive public evaluation and comment for such a critical issue. That is why I have joined my colleagues Senators Dorgan and Lott to call for a committee hearing on this issue so that we can examine it further and get a better understanding of what direction the Commission plans to take. I look forward to hearing from our distinguished panels on this and other matters pertaining to the radio market. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Cantwell. So, Mr. Westergren, if you could re-start the testimony from the panel, thank you very much. STATEMENT OF TIM WESTERGREN, FOUNDER AND CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, PANDORA MEDIA; ON BEHALF OF THE DIGITAL MEDIA ASSOCIATION Mr. Westergren. Chairman Inouye and Members of the Committee, on behalf of Pandora, the Digital Media Association, and Internet radio industry, thank you for inviting me to speak about the future of radio. Today I will discuss how Pandora and Internet radio innovation offers unique benefits to listeners and artists, and I will ask your help as we confront our royalty crisis that threatens our innovative company, and our industry. Pandora, a company I founded after 10 years as a working musician, is radio that listeners enjoy on their personal computers, their home stereos, and on mobile phones. Pandora is the third-largest Internet radio service in America, with nearly 9 million registered listeners. Pandora is unique, because when you type in a song or artist you like, we instantly provide a radio station that you are certain to enjoy. We can do that because our programming is based on a sophisticated analytical tool called the ``Music Genome Project.'' Hundreds of musical attributes have been identified by our musicologists, and then used to analyze every song in our database. The Music Genome Project connects the dots between songs and artists, and the results are dramatic. Listeners enjoy radio with more music they like, and more new music they discover. Artists compete for listeners on a level playing field. Once in our database, a song will play on suitable stations, depending only on musical relevance and listener feedback. Being famous or having a big marketing budget won't change a thing. Every month we add roughly 14,000 songs to our database, which now includes several hundred thousand songs by more than 35 artists. More than 70 percent of our recordings, and 50 percent of our performances are by so-called ``Indie'' artists, unaffiliated with a major record label. As an example, on Mac's record label, his songs have spun over 25 million times. This compares to less than 10 percent of Indie music on broadcast radio. To listeners, Internet radio is looking more and more like broadcast and satellite radio. We are listening to a live Pandora radio transmitting over Sprint's cell phone network. This $2 connector can also plug into your home stereo or car stereo so media convergence is well underway. Sorry, that was a little loud. Senator Cantwell. I don't know, it was pretty good. Mr. Westergren. Ella Fitzgerald. But Internet radio is much more powerful. Rather than playing several stations for thousands or millions of listeners, the Internet can accommodate hundreds of thousands of simultaneous channels, allowing unlimited diversity, so listeners can hear music they are certain to enjoy, and discover new songs and artists that would otherwise be invisible to them. Musicians who cannot get airplay on broadcast radio have found a home and an audience on Internet radio--jazz, big band, klezmer, lute music--the list goes on. Internet radio also offers listeners the opportunity to immediately buy music or concert tickets, and they do. Pandora is a leading referral site for music purchasing, for both Amazon.com and the iTunes Music Store, and a recent study found that Pandora listeners are three to five times more likely to purchase music than the average American. But Pandora and Internet radio face early extinction, because the Copyright Royalty Board recently imposed absurdly high royalties on our industry. For example, in 2007, Pandora would pay royalties of nearly 50 percent of our revenue, and the rate increases by more than 25 percent in 2008, and again in 2009. In contrast, broadcast radio pays zero sound recording royalties. Satellite radio pays less than 3 percent of its revenue, and cable radio pays 7\\1/4\\ percent. I am proud that in 2006, Pandora paid more than $2 million in royalties. But in 2007, our invoice will exceed $6 million. The CRB ruling has rendered our business and the entire business economically unsustainable. After the CRB decision, Pandora joined the SaveNet Radio campaign, and together with several million Internet radio listeners and more than 6,000 artists, Pandora supporters have been calling Congress, and urging support for Internet radio. We thank Senators Kerry and Dorgan for cosponsoring the Internet Radio Equality Act, which would resolve this crisis by setting Internet radio royalties at a reasonable 7.5 percent of revenue. Today, we remain hopeful that the CRB royalty decision will be remedied through Congressional or judicial action, or through negotiation. But the moment we believe otherwise, is the moment we close down our company, lay off 117 employees, and disappoint millions of listeners, and many thousands of recording artists. As a musician, I am heartbroken at the prospect of silencing Internet radio, an extraordinary resource that offers artists a wonderful promotional platform. As a listener, I am depressed at possibly losing the most powerful music discovery tool ever created, and as a webcaster, I am dismayed at the prospect of telling 9 million listeners that their radio stations are dead. Everyone at Pandora, and the Internet radio industry wants artists to be paid fairly, but we also want Internet radio to survive, and that will not happen unless the CRB royalty decision is remedied. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Westergren follows:] Prepared Statement of Tim Westergren, Founder and Chief Strategy Officer, Pandora Media; on Behalf of the Digital Media Association Chairman Inouye, Vice Chairman Stevens, and members of the Committee: My name is Tim Westergren. I am the Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Pandora, and it is my pleasure today to speak with you on behalf of my company and the Digital Media Association (``DiMA''), about the radio industry, and particularly about innovation and the future of radio. What is Pandora? Pandora is an Internet radio service that listeners enjoy on their personal computers, through home entertainment products and on mobile phones. Pandora is powered by a very unique musical taxonomy, called the Music Genome Project, developed by our team of university-degreed musicologists. Our team has identified hundreds of musical attributes and they assign values to each attribute in each song. When applied across a repertoire of hundreds of thousands of songs, the Music Genome Project literally connects the dots between songs and artists that have something--often quite subtle things--in common. This is the foundation that enables Pandora to offer listeners--quickly and easily--radio stations that play music that matches their taste if the listener simply tells us the name of a favorite song or artist. The result is remarkable in many ways. More than 8.5 million registered Pandora listeners enjoy a better radio experience, and they are passionate about our service. They listen to more music, they re- engage with their music, and they find new artists whose recordings they purchase and whose performances they attend. Pandora is a bit of a phenom--in only 2 years since our launch we have become the third largest Internet radio service in America. But the real winners are music fans, artists, record companies, songwriters and music publishers. Something unique about Pandora is that all music, once analyzed by our musicologists and entered into our database, wins and loses audience in the purest of democratic processes. If listeners vote ``thumbs up'' a song and artist are electronically added to more station playlists, the exposure is greater, and more people can offer opinions about that music. If listeners consistently vote ``thumbs down'' then the song is performed and heard less. Not even my musical tastes or the CEO's favorites can modify the purity of how our musical taxonomy determines all Pandora radio performances. Equally unique is the breadth of our playlist. Pandora musicologists will review any CD that is delivered to us, and in most cases enter it into our database and make it available for our millions of listeners to hear. Pandora's collection includes hundreds of thousands of songs across the genres of Pop, Rock, Jazz, Electronica, Hip Hop, Country, Blues, R&B, Latin and in just a few weeks, Classical. These recordings range from the most popular artists to the completely obscure, and each month our nearly fifty musicologists analyze and add roughly 14,000 new songs to the catalogue--a very deliberate process that requires between 15 and 30 minutes per song. There are no prerequisites for inclusion in the Music Genome Project. Indeed, it is quite common for us to add amateur homemade CDs to the service. As a card-carrying independent musician I am proud to report that fully 70 percent of the sound recordings in our collection, representing over 35,000 artists, are recordings of artists who are not affiliated with a major record label. Most important, because we rely only on musical relevance to connect songs and create radio playlists, all artists are treated equally in the playlist selection process and as a result independent music is likely heard more on Pandora then perhaps any other popular radio service. More than 50 percent of Pandora radio performances are from independent musicians, compared to less than 10 percent on broadcast radio. What qualities are unique about ``new media'' radio, and what benefits are associated with those qualities? In one sense multimedia convergence has already blurred the line between traditional `terrestrial radio', Internet radio, mobile radio, cable radio, satellite radio and even community radio. For example: Your mobile phone today can transmit a ``webcast'', and with a $2 adaptor you can listen to that Internet radio through your car stereo. You can start a ``community'' radio station on the Internet and while content is focused locally, an audience is available (and may actually listen) globally. Your car stereo today comes pre-loaded with AM/FM and perhaps XM, but in only a few years cars will have WiMAX broadband access and you will be able to enjoy Internet radio directly and throw away the adaptor I just spoke of. To a listener who is hearing a single station at a given time, it is just radio and their choices are amazing--which content do I want to hear, when do I want to hear it, and on what device? But in another sense, Internet radio is uniquely different from broadcast, satellite and even low-power FM radio, because on the web there are virtually no spectrum limitations and therefore no capacity or scarcity issues. As a result, Internet radio offers almost unlimited ``stations'' which results in unlimited content diversity. For music fans, Internet radio means no longer being confined to local or even satellite stations playing homogenous music for broad audiences of thousands or tens of thousands of listeners. Instead, individuals can hear the types of music they enjoy and simultaneously discover new songs and artists that would otherwise be literally invisible to them. Unconstrained by spectrum limitations, webcasting has created a genuine explosion of accessible musical diversity. Lute music, classic country, jazz, klezmer, dixie, gospel, Latin and Hawaiian music--you name it and you can find it--every kind and color of music has found a home and connected with its audience, no matter how small, on the Internet. Another unique feature of Internet radio is click-to-buy purchasing opportunities, and immediate access to artist information, including the artist's promotional website and tour schedule. Pandora is a powerful platform for recording companies and artists during this tumultuous period for recorded music. An August 2007 Nielsen/NetRatings research study concluded that Pandora listeners are three to five times more likely to have purchased music in the last 90 days than the average American. Similarly, Pandora is one of the top referral sites for music purchasing from both Amazon.com and the iTunes Music Store. Other studies have documented that Internet radio listeners are generally more engaged with music, they talk about it more and attend more performances, and they inevitably promote artists and music through word-of-mouth marketing. Finally, of course, there is the issue of royalties to performers and recording companies. As you know, traditional broadcasters do not pay royalties but the rest of us--cable, satellite and Internet radio-- do pay. You may not be aware that Internet radio has the smallest of all radio revenue streams, but we pay proportionately the highest royalties. I am proud that in 2006 Pandora paid more than $2 million in royalties to artists and recording companies, and had the old royalties rates stayed in effect, then in 2007 we would be on track to pay over $4 million. Instead, unfortunately, the Copyright Royalty Board recently increased royalty rates more than 30 percent so our royalty in 2007 is now likely to reach over $6 million, almost 50 percent of our total revenue. And per listener per track royalty rates for Internet radio are scheduled to climb an additional 27 percent in 2008, and 29 percent more in 2009. Under the CRB decision Internet music radio is economically unsustainable; it is not even a close call. Pandora has skyrocketed from a standing start to millions of listeners in 2 years; we were getting within sight of cash-flow positive operations under the old rates, but now we are back under water with no hope of ever emerging as the royalty rates continue to increase. Of course our disappointment is magnified because our broadcast and satellite competitors enjoy no royalties or very reasonable royalties, respectively. It is for these reasons that Pandora and the entire Internet radio industry thank Senators Kerry and Dorgan for cosponsoring the Internet Radio Equality Act, S. 1353, which would resolve this industry crisis by reversing the Copyright Royalty Board's recent rate-setting decision and set royalties at a reasonable 7.5 percent of revenue--higher than that paid by any U.S.-based radio service and higher than the average royalties in Europe that the recording industry references as the bastion of sound recording performance royalty fairness. In the starkest possible terms, the Committee and the Congress should be aware that Pandora and the entire Internet music radio industry cannot afford the CRB royalty rates. Today, we still are hopeful and we believe that some combination of Congress, the courts, or a negotiated resolution with SoundExchange will favorably resolve this threat. But if we conclude that the CRB royalty rates are not going to be rectified, Pandora would shut down immediately. Congress should also understand that Pandora and our DiMA colleagues are not alone in our effort to reverse this unfair CRB royalty decision. Since the SaveNetRadio campaign began several hundred thousand people have contacted Congress and urged support for Internet radio and more than 6,000 artists have joined the effort in support of the Internet Radio Equality Act and more reasonable royalties for artists and recording companies. Everyone in the Coalition wants artists to be paid fairly and supports the growth of Internet radio which directly and indirectly benefits tens of thousands of working artists. But without reduced royalties there is simply no way for Pandora, or any other webcaster, to remain in business. * * * * * * * In just 10 years more than 70 million listeners have flocked to Internet radio, a virtual fountain of music discovery. Many of our listeners are returning to radio after years of exile spent listening to the same CDs they bought in college, or not listening to music at all. And musicians are back in business also, as they can now find fans and build community with people who want to buy their music and want to attend their performances. The Internet continues to be a remarkable democratizing force for creativity and innovation. It has been a wonderful experience to watch our service grow and to witness our listeners' passion and enthusiasm as they have rediscovered their love of music. I am Pandora's traveling minstrel, and in the last 18 months I have visited almost 100 different towns and cities meeting in ``town hall''-style with Pandora listeners. From Biloxi and Baton Rouge to Seattle and San Francisco I have met with tens and often hundreds of listeners at each meeting and enjoyed the energy of enthusiastic music fans and musicians who are re-engaged and re- committed to their music and their newfound radio experience. As a former performing musician and composer, it is exciting to be at the dawn of a new renaissance for musicians, who are empowered with new ways to market their music and successfully develop a fan base. I often wish I could start my band now instead of back in the early nineties when our resources were a van, a staple gun and a pile of flyers that we handed out or stapled to telephone poles. It is my hope, indeed the reason I started this company, that we are at the beginning of the development of a musicians' middle class, as radio services like Pandora allow musicians to find a fan base and maintain a steady career making music, which is a real alternative to the major-label system that makes you an enormous star or leaves you unemployed. These e-mails from Pandora listeners testify to this new era for independent musicians: ``I think the best thing you've done is introduced me to so many artists that I love but would have never known that they existed otherwise. Now I buy their albums and look for upcoming shows in my area. You've done the music industry a great service from what I can tell.'' ``Let me tell you that you are a blessing in my life. I'm 77 years old and the music I like and grew up with just isn't played much any more. Sometimes tears come to my eyes when I hear certain songs. They bring back so many memories. I don't think I have heard any songs I haven't liked. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I send you arms full of appreciation.'' And from a musician: ``Hi guys--just wanted to thank you for putting my music into your system. I have had sales all over the U.S. from people who found me via your site. Pandora is great. I use it all the time. And I can't believe what a promotional tool it has become for my own music.'' Since 1999 Pandora has survived the dot-com collapse thanks to more than 30 employees who worked months without salaries, and we are now one of the largest payors of sound recording performance rights in this great Nation. We employ more than 100 people, most of whom are trained and experienced musicians and most of whom work at our headquarters in an enterprise zone in Oakland, California. We have invested; we have innovated; and we have had some very good initial success. Please support resolution of the Internet radio royalty crisis by cosponsoring the Internet Radio Equality Act so our industry can continue to grow, and continue to benefit artists by paying fair royalties and developing new audiences. As a musician who spent a decade walking in the shoes of the working artist, I am heartbroken at the prospect of silencing what has become an extraordinary resource for the artist community. As a listener and music lover, I am depressed at the prospect of losing the most powerful music discovery tool ever put in the hands of music lovers. And as a webcaster, I am dismayed at the prospect of telling millions of devoted listeners that their radio stations are dead. Thank you for your time and consideration. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Westergren for the testimony and for the demonstration, we appreciate that. It's not every day we get a media demonstration. Mr. Turner, if you'd like to give your statement? STATEMENT OF S. DEREK TURNER, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, FREE PRESS; ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS UNION, CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA Mr. Turner. Madam Chair, Chairman Inouye, and Members of the Committee, I thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the important issues surrounding the future of radio. I'm the Research Director for Free Press, a public interest organization dedicated to public education and consumer advocacy on communications policy. Even in today's multimedia world, broadcast radio remains one of the most powerful media in our daily lives. Well over 90 percent of Americans tune to the radio each week, for an average of 19 hours a week. New technologies like HD Radio and Internet simulcasting hold great promise for the future of this industry, as do changing demographics. For example, while total time spent listening to radio has stagnated for the general population, it has actually increased substantially among African-Americans and Latinos, and it matters who owns these stations. In a democracy, the diversity of ownership should reflect the diversity of the population. Sadly, as my testimony will show, this is not the case. The FCC has a statutory obligation to promote ownership diversity. The Communications Act directs the Commission to, ``avoid excessive concentrations of licenses by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including businesses owned by women and members of minority groups.'' But the Commission lacks even the most basic understanding of what actually the true state of female and minority broadcast ownership is. Now, we can't evaluate the problems that we don't measure or study, let alone solve them. This is why my organization, Free Press, took on the task that the Commission has neglected. Using the Commission's own data, we found that despite comprising over half of the population, women in this country own just 6 percent of the radio stations. Minorities make up a full third of our population, but own just 7.7 percent of the radio stations, and the stations that women and minorities own are fundamentally different. Female and minority owners are more likely to own just one single station, and are more likely to be local owners, which fosters a deeper connection to the communities that they serve. Now, these characteristics are very important, for they are the precise characteristics of those owners who are most vulnerable to the pressures of media consolidation. The 1996 Telecom Act triggered a wave of consolidation in the radio industry, by removing the national ownership limit, and increasing local ownership caps. The impact on ownership diversity was clear, and it was devastating. Since 1996, there has been a whopping 40 percent decrease in the number of owners, even as the number of stations has increased. In the average local market, just two firms control 74 percent of the market's revenue--a highly concentrated level by any standard. Now, how do female and minority owners fare under this wave of consolidation? Our research demonstrates conclusively and empirically that more consolidation means less female and minority ownership. As concentration increases, these single- station and local owners find it increasingly difficult to compete against the big radio giants. Now, I mentioned earlier that the FCC has no idea what the true state of female and minority broadcast ownership is. This is not hyperbole. It may be hard to believe, but the Commission has never conducted an accurate count. Though the FCC collects information regarding the race, ethnicity and gender of every broadcast owner, they have done nothing meaningful with this information. Instead, they have issued bogus summaries that are deeply flawed. For example, our research conclusively showed that the Commission, in its most recent effort, missed over half of the radio stations owned by women and minorities. In television they fared far worse, missing over two-thirds of the television stations owned by women and minorities. This is simply a shocking testament to the FCC's indifference to the plight of women and people of color in this country, and it is also an embarrassing record of neglect and incompetence for a Federal agency. How can the Commission conduct any meaningful analysis regarding the effects of its policies, if it can't even conduct a basic count of who owns what? Congress must send a message to the FCC to stop its rush toward more media consolidation. The Commission needs to first adequately study the issue of minority ownership, before it moves forward with any rule changes. And the Commission needs to complete other related tasks, such as the dormant localism proceeding, and issue the long-overdue Section 257 report that Congress requires on the Commission's efforts to promote ownership diversity. We also support other measures that increase opportunities for women and minorities to access the public radio airwaves. The Local Community Radio Act, sponsored by Senators Cantwell and McCain, expands Low Power FM and will help create a more diverse broadcast system and will provide a crucial path to full ownership by women and people of color. In closing, ownership rules exist for a reason--to increase diversity and localism, which in turn produces more diverse speech, more choices for listeners, and more owners who are responsive to their local communities. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Turner follows:] Prepared Statement of S. Derek Turner, Research Director, Free Press; on Behalf of Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America Summary Free Press,i Consumers Union,ii and Consumer Federation of America iii appreciate the opportunity to testify on the important communications policy issues surrounding the future of radio. As consumer advocates, we strongly support policies that will fulfill the goals of the Communications Act ``to make available . . . to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex'' \\1\\ a media that favors a ``diversity of media voices'',\\2\\ characterized by ``vigorous economic competition, technological advancement'',\\3\\ and one that serves ``the public interest, convenience, and necessity.'' \\4\\ Ensuring a vibrant future for radio, as well as all other communications media, is vital to maintaining our economic and social well being in addition to our vigorous political discourse. Our democracy thrives on the dissemination of the widest possible sources of information, and radio remains one of the most important conduits for the propagation of local, national and international news, culture, entertainment and information. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\i\\ Free Press is a national, nonpartisan organization with over 350,000 members working to increase informed public participation in media and communications policy debates. \\ii\\ Consumers Union is a nonprofit membership organization chartered in 1936 under the laws of the state of New York to provide consumers with information, education and counsel about goods, services, health and personal finance, and to initiate and cooperate with individual and group efforts to maintain and enhance the quality of life for consumers. Consumers Union's income is solely derived from the sale of Consumer Reports, its other publications and from noncommercial contributions, grants and fees. In addition to reports on Consumers Union's own product testing, Consumer Reports with more than 5 million paid circulation, regularly, carries articles on health, product safety, marketplace economics and legislative, judicial and regulatory actions which affect consumer welfare. Consumers Union's publications carry no advertising and receive no commercial support. \\iii\\ The Consumer Federation of America is the Nation's largest consumer advocacy group, composed of over 280 state and local affiliates representing consumer, senior citizen, low-income, labor, farm, public power and cooperative organizations, with more than 50 million individual members. \\1\\ The Communications Act of 1934 (As Amended in 1996), Title I, Section 1. \\2\\ The Communications Act of 1934 (As Amended in 1996), Title II, Section 257. \\3\\ Ibid. \\4\\ Ibid. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The United States is a diverse melting pot of people and cultures. In such an environment it is not unreasonable to expect that the privilege of access to the scarce radio broadcast airwaves be distributed in a manner that reflects our racial, ethnic and gender diversity. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Women and people of color comprise 67 percent of our population, but own just 13 percent of our Nation's radio stations. This underrepresentation is a national disgrace and a true crisis for the millions of Americans who lack representative voices on the public airwaves. Compounding this tragedy is the simple fact that women and people of color are radio's future. African American's and Latinos spend 20 percent more of their time listening to radio than whites, over 22 hours each week. And while radio listenership has stagnated or declined among whites over the past decade, it has actually increased among people of color. Though the Communications Act explicitly directs the Federal Communications Commission to disseminate ``licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including . . . businesses owned by members of minority groups and women'',\\5\\ our research reveals that the FCC lacks even the most basic understanding of the current state of female and minority ownership, and therefore has no basis to assess the impacts of its broadcast regulatory policies on these underrepresented owners. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ The Communications Act of 1934 (As Amended in 1996), Title II, Section 309(j). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Our study, Off The Dial (attached to this testimony as an appendix),* is to date the only comprehensive assessment of the state of female and minority radio ownership and the impacts of FCC regulatory policy. Using the Commission's own data, we have done the work that the FCC has neglected to do. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\*\\ This document is retained in the Committee's files and is also available at http:"
