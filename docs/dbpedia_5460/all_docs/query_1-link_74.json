        "text": "NEW PHILADELPHIA A Northeast Ohio public radio station asked Tuscarawas County to talk about pressing issues facing the community.\n\nMany comments made by those who attended WKSU-FM's forum on Thursday related to abuse of heroin and other drugs.\n\n\"We have users in our probation department (who reported) starting (drug use) at age 9,\" said Elizabeth Stephenson, administrator of the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas. \"It's a big source of what we're seeing in the courts.\"\n\nShe estimated that 80 percent of cases are related to substance abuse.\n\nOn the positive side, she said, \"Drug court is doing wonders.\" The specialized docket handles nonviolent drug- and alcohol-related felonies through intensive treatment and supervision.\n\nCarey Gardner related his experience serving on a grand jury for four months. He said 75 percent of the cases were drug-related: dealing drugs, using drugs, stealing stuff to buy drugs.\n\n\"What a drain on our society,\" said Gardner, a former WKSU news director. \"It's just unbelievable. It cuts across all classes.\"\n\nGardner, now a spokesman for Union Hospital in Dover, said the hospital's emergency room doctors have seen a dramatic rise in the number of overdoses.\n\nThe community needs to have treatment available immediately for addicts who leave the emergency room if they want it, said crisis intervention specialist John Carroll.\n\n\"We've had to discharge people,\" Carroll said. \"Twenty-four hours in the ER, you'll calm down a little. The best we can do for them is 'Here is someplace where you can walk in for detox somewhere in the next week.' \"\n\nFran Gerbig of Dover said the stigma attached to mental health problems and addiction is a barrier to treatment.\n\n\"This truly is a disease, a disease that can be treated,\" she said. \"So much of homelessness is directly tied to mental health issues.\"\n\nAbout 25 people attended the event, one of the Kent-based station's Community Conversations, which are being held throughout its 22-county listening area.\n\nPanelists included Dover High School graduate Amanda Rabinowitz, the station's assistant news director, who is local host for NPR's Morning Edition.\n\n\"My alarm goes off at 2:30 in the morning,\" she said. \"Sleeping in is 6 a.m.\"\n\nAfter waking on a work day, while still in bed, she checks messages from the other six members of the station's news staff, newspaper websites and other online sources to see what has happened since she went to sleep. She gets to the office at 4 a.m.\n\n\"I have one hour to get the show ready as we go live at 5 a.m.,\" Rabinowitz said.\n\nShe was joined in the listening session by Ele Ellis, the station's director of programming, and Andrew Meyer, news director.\n\nMeyer discussed the station's plan to coordinate with NPR on covering the Republican National Convention in July in Cleveland. Collaboration is planned with WCPN-FM, a Cleveland-based NPR affiliate. He said the station plans to put a bureau in the Akron Beacon Journal's office building, a move which will pave the way for partnerships in coverage.\n\nMeyer also noted that he had met Republican presidential candidate and real-estate mogul Donald Trump during his prior work in the New York City media market.\n\n\"He was very nice to me,\" Meyer said.\n\nOther topics of concern mentioned at Thursday's event included the local oil and gas industry, the need for affordable housing, a lack of public transportation, poverty, harassment of the homeless, and whether Dover High School will be replaced.\n\nDebra Cahill said the state of local schools is a factor for many corporate executives who choose to commute from Stark County.\n\nPeople at the other end of the socio-economic spectrum were on the mind of Andrew Neuhauser, a staff attorney with Southeastern Ohio Legal Services.\n\n\"Things that most of us take for granted are not available to everyone in the community,\" he said. \"People in poverty, it affects all parts of their life. If you have cockroaches in the house, that's going to cause health problems.\"\n\nWKSU's home frequency is 89.7 FM. Its signal is also available at 91.5 FM over repeater station WKRJ in New Philadelphia."
