        "text": "The Internet Folk Radio List\n\nWhat's New in Version Nine?\n\nFor this version I'm experimenting with listing additions/modifications first. With the next revision, I'll incorporate them into the main list.\n\nMy thinking is that this will make it easier for repeat TIFL users to spot the changes.\n\nDoes this make TIFRL more or less useful? Let me know at jeremy@tcf.ua.edu.\n\nOur favorite site is still Folkbook, which generously provides space for TIFRL. But we'd be remiss if we didn't plug the Web sites for All Things Acoustic and Alabama Public Radio, where TIFRL originates.\n\nAnd Now, On to the List...\n\nThe following was compiled mostly from people responding to my requests for info on folk_music, rec.music.folk, FOLKDJ-L and FOLKTALK. Additional data were gleaned from folk publications: Dirty Linen, Sing Out!, and Crossroads (a trade publication for folk radio--acoustic@rtd.com; [520] 792-9891).\n\nI requested information in the following format:\n\nREGION: PROGRAM TITLE: PROGRAM HOST: RADIO STATION NAME (call letters): RADIO STATION FREQUENCY AND LOCATION: TIME/DAY BROADCAST: TYPE OF MUSIC FEATURED: ADDRESS (e-mail, Web, and standard post): COMMENTS (how cool is it?):\n\nThe responses I got were more free-form, however. Rather than regiment them into the form I arbitrarily devised, I've left them mostly in their original format. The comments regarding the programs are those of the contributors, not your humble collator.\n\nThe stations are clustered by regions, and alphabetically by state/province within regions--within individual states it gets a bit haphazard.\n\nRegions:\n\nMidwest\n\nNortheast\n\nNorthwest\n\nSouthwest (inc. CA and TX)\n\nSoutheast\n\nUnited States (i.e., national or syndicated)\n\nCanada\n\nInternational\n\nStations are separated by a line of hyphens; regions are separated by a line of asterisks. \"International\" refers to regions outside North America--in particular, Australia.\n\nLAST REVISED: September 6, 1997\n\nSend revisions/additions to:\n\nJeremy Butler\n\nHost, All Things Acoustic\n\nAlabama Public Radio: WUAL/WQPR/APR\n\njeremy@tcf.ua.edu\n\nP.O.
