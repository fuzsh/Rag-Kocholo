[ January 2000 update: currently being rewriten. ] READ THIS NOTE: I receive an average of hundreds of mail messages per day. If you want to make sure that your update/correction/reply to this article comes to my attention when I'm working on the next version, please send your message as a reply to this article, i.e. make absolutely certain that you preserve the \"Subject:\" line. If you don't do this, your reply may sit in one of my numerous mail queues for months or even years. Please don't send an update more than once -- doing so only adds to the queue that I have to process when doing updates. If you want to make certain that I've received something, then make a note of the information on the \"Version:\" line above. If it has changed when you next see this article, and your information isn't included, then I've missed it. Otherwise, it's safe to presume I've got it and it queued for inclusion. The FAQ may be reproduced and propagated via http, ftp, gopher or other common Internet protocols by anyone provided that (1) it is reproduced in its entirety (2) no fee is charged for access to it and (3) it's kept up-to-date. This latter is probably best accomplished by mirroring one of the FAQ archives -- that way you'll get a new copy everytime I update it, which is approximately monthly. (If you do put it up on the web, I'd like to know the URL, but that's not a requirement. It just would be nice.) Reproduction of this FAQ on paper, CDROM or other media which are sold is permissible only with the express written consent of its author. If you are reading a copy of this document which appears to be out-of-date, there are a variety of methods that you can use to retrieve the most current method. If you are familiar with access to the FAQ archives via mail, ftp, and www, then you already know how. If not, then send email to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the command \"send usenet/news.answers/news-answers/introduction\" in the message, and a complete guide to FAQ retrieval will be mailed to you. What's this about? In the US, most radio stations are commercial: they are owned by companies who are trying to make a profit from their operation. The way that they generate income for themselves is to sell airtime for commercials. But there's another group of radio stations, \"public radio\", which are not funded in this manner. They are almost always commercial-free, and get their money from (1) listeners, who \"subscribe\" to the station (2) grants from various foundations, and (3) other fundraisers, such as concerts. There are even radio networks (NPR, APR, etc.) which produce programming shared by many of these stations in the same way that commercial networks such as ABC or CBS produce programming for their stations. Public radio (and public television) are often the only independent sources of news information in many communities. (The paragraph above was written in response to a query from Roswitha Hahn-Drodofsky, who asked just what this \"public radio\" thing is all about. In my American-centrism, it had escaped me that this article might confuse people elsewhere in the world. Hopefully the short exposition above will clear it up a bit. ---Rsk ) Another view on what this is about: I recently received a fascinating note from Michael Carraher, providing another answer to the same question. I've been reading his note, re-reading mine, and then trying to figure out a way to integrate the two into a coherent presentation that's as accurate as I can make it. Well, I haven't figure that out -- but I do think he made some extremely insightful observations, and I think that until I get a chance to meld his work with mine, the best thing I can do is reprint it here just as he sent it to me. I hope that those of you who are reading this will find the juxtaposition of his opinion with mine to be useful, and that it will help you reach an understanding of your own. ----------begin note from Michael The distinction between commercial and noncommercial stations -- according to the FCC -- is commercials. Most, but not all, commercial stations are owned by corporations but some are community-based, or mom and pop, or owned by nonprofit organizations (churches, colleges, etc.). Not all radio stations make a profit. I am a bit uncomfortable with your statement which implies the profit motive underlies commercial broadcasting. That may be true much of the time but I assert we don't know the motives of the people who run commercial stations (or noncommercial stations for that matter). Sources of funding for public radio stations include: Corporate underwriting (currently the largest source for NPR/PRI stations), Foundation grants, CPB/government funds, listener contributions and other fund raisers. It should be noted that \"other fund-raisers\" includes businesses run by various public radio organizations on a for profit basis (e.g., NPR sells satellite time to commercial broadcasters, PRI runs a mail order catalog business, WHYY operates a TV production facility). The line between corporate underwriting and advertising is a fine one. The distinction appears to be that a corporate underwriting announcement cannot make product comparisons nor ask people to buy. Many corporate underwriting announcements do extoll a product's virtues. Public radio \"development\" people do solicit corporate underwriters, much as commercial broadcast \"sales people\" solicit advertisers -- and they often cite audience research data to justify the \"use\" of public radio as a promotional tool to underwriters. And, sometimes, public radio operations do show a surplus. Surplus money is invested, paid to staff/managers as bonuses, ploughed back into the operation (anything except paid to stockholders as dividends). The only \"independent\" source of news in many communities? You need to define terms here. Independent of what/whom? If you are suggesting corporate ownership means a lack of independence -- or quality -- in news presentation, I believe there are numerous examples to the contrary. There are also examples of public radio stations giving into to government and political pressures. Maybe by independent you mean \"locally-owned.\" That term would be more accurate, but locally owned does not necessarily mean better. You are in Philadelphia. KYW is commercial, owned by a corporation and not locally owned. Their news presentation is different from WHYY, but I would not say it is in anyway inferior nor compromised in its integrity. Also your definition of public radio would include many religious broadcasters (from whom contributions are their main -- sometimes only -- source of income). You might want to rework your definition to distinguish NPR/PRI/Pacifica type public radio from -- what to call it? -- \"parochial radio.\" BTW: I've never been that thrilled with the name \"public radio.\" All radio is public. \"Public\" is better than \"educational\" (the name used prior to the Carnegie Commission report in 1967). It's almost 30 years now, maybe these stations no longer need a generic name to distinguish themselves from other broadcasters. ----------end note from Michael Disclaimer: I don't work for NPR, or any public radio station at the moment; I once worked for WCBU (Peoria) and am currently a member of WHYY and WXPN (Philadelphia). But I'm certainly an unabashed supporter of public radio. Questions answered (or at least asked!) within: Q. What are the major NPR-carried shows and their contact info? Q. What are the NPR affiliates around the country? Q. How do you obtain a station list or programming schedule from NPR? Q. What's the difference between National Public Radio, American Public Radio, Public Radio International, Pacifica Radio, and all that? Q. How do I get my hands on general NPR info? Q. How can I find out about books and albums mentioned on the air? Q. How can I get my paws on some of the music I've heard on the air? Q. Are there are books and articles about, or by NPR or NPR people? Q. How about recordings made by NPR people? (i.e. non-broadcast material) Q. What's the relationship of NPR to PBS? Q. How did NPR originally come about? Q. Can I get NPR programming outside the US? Q. I've heard listener commentary on ATC/ME; how do I send mine in? Q. I like public radio so much I want to work for them; now what? Q. Where else can I look for radio info? Q. How is public radio funded? Q. Is anybody saving all this? Q. Are there any other resources out there? Q. Hey -- what about Mama Stamberg's Cranberry Relish recipe? Several people have commented that this list is NPR-centric; that's not intentional. If you have information to share, NPR-related or not, please send it along, and I'll try to incorporate it. If you find errors, omissions, or whatnot, please drop me a line; and remember that this is still mostly a draft document, with lots of work to be done on it before it's truly useful. Q. What are the major public radio shows and their contact info? I've alphabetized the list of shows below, which should make it a bit easier to deal with. A general note: all NPR programs have pages which can be found at http://www.npr.org; there's an NPR FAQ there as well. Afropop Worldwide: A mixture of African, pop, jazz, and rock musics.

Host: Dr. Moira Gunn This American Life: Examination of different bits of Americana. Host: Ira Glass To the Best of Our Knowledge: One-on-one interview/discussion show, often compared to \"Fresh Air\". Guests are less likely to be well known, and are chosen for their unusual viewpoints, rather than because they represent a particular \"side\" of an issue (many are authors). Interviewers often include their own comments, so it's more like a conversation than an interview. Three one-hour shows are produced each week, and local stations may air them together or separately. Usually one hour deals with politics and social trends, one with science and technology, and one with arts and culture. Each show consists of several one-one-one interviews by different interviewers, loosely based around a common topic.

Other stations had other origins and joined the network later. ) Wyoming Jackson KUWJ-FM, 90.3 Laramie KUWR-FM, 91.9 Q. How do you obtain a station list or programming schedule from NPR? As mentioned above, NPR does publish a station list. Send SASE to Listener Services, 635 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001 or become a member of your local station. Q. What's the difference between National Public Radio, American Public Radio, Public Radio International, Pacifica Radio, and all that? Steve's comments: I think APR became PRI because it was beginning to be distributed internationally. PRI is an alternate network to NPR that is carried by some NPR stations. Marketplace, Garrison Keilor's show are PRI shows- not NPR. I think APR was originally formed when Keilor couldn't get backing from NPR. PRI now produces a number of programs. Randall's comments: American Public Radio has changed it's name to Public Radio International. This is a competitive organization to NPR. In the past they only distributed programming to affiliates for re-broadcast; they recently announced that they will begin producing programs as well. NPR has always produced and distributed programming. Rich Dean's comments: A separate division of NPR (actually a separate company) manages the public radio satellite system. NPR does not own the satellite and must rent time like everyone else... [which includes PRI. In other words, NPR and PRI programming might wind up passing through the same transponders, but both of them have to rent the time.] Krishna's comments: During the late 70s and early 80s, Minnesota Public Radio wanted NPR to carry _A Prairie Home Companion_ nationally. NPR was cool to the idea; and MPR and the public radio stations of 3 states adjoining Minnesota formed American Public Radio. The names NPR and APR were sufficiently alike that most people assume that the two were either the same, or they did not bother to distinguish between the abbreviations and the organizations behind them. During the summer of 1994, APR finally decided to adopt the name Public Radio International. The \"official\" reason was that APR was starting to distribute BBC and CBC programs in the US, and was also distribution US programs to other countries, hence the \"American\" in its name is not very appropriate. Most people think that the \"real\" reason was to distance their name from NPR as much as possible. APR/PRI does not produce programs on its own; it distributes programs produced by other public radio stations and uses the NPR satellite network for its feed. WYK is one such program--- produced by Wisconsin Public Radio and distributed by PRI. Of course, everyone knows that on WYK PRI should be known as the International House of Radio (... whose employees are lucky to be working at all, let alone tying up the office phones trying to play the quiz ...). For the contemporary historians among us, the history of NPR is fairly well documented in many books and articles. The evolution of APR/PRI is less well documented. In any case, interested readers should check out the CPB and NPR Web pages for more information: http://www.cpb.org/ http://www.npr.org/ Public Radio International has a web site at http://www.pri.org with program descriptions, carriage lists, a bit of history of the network, etc. As well as WPR's own web site: i http://www.wpr.org The CPB comment line is 1-800-CPB-2190 (1-800-272-2190). Pacifica Radio is another independent network, not a part of NPR. There are different levels of affiliation with Pacifica; there seem to be about half a dozen or so fully-affiliated stations around the country. You can find Pacifica on the web at: http://www.pacifica.org And you can find all of the Pacifica stations at http://www.<call letters>.org where the <call letters>\" are KPFA, KPFK, KPFT, WBAI, and WPFW. Some of those stations have their own web sites; for example, WBAI is found at: http://www.wbai.org, or at 99.5 FM if you happen to be in New York. KPFT is at 90.1 FM is in Houston, Texas. Q. How do I get my hands on general NPR info? To order transcripts online: telnet pac.carl.org - select Information Databases, select Journal Graphics. For more info, e-mail to npr@jgi.com. Include as much info as possible, including your credit card number and they'll e-mail you the transcript. Don't feel safe throwing your credit card number thru unsecure (insecure?! :-) ) e-mail, call 202-414-3232, which is NPR's Audience Services, or send $12.90 (plus 2.50 shipping/handling) for cassettes of TALK programs (2 hours) to NPR Tapes, 635 Massachusetts Avenue N.W. Washington, DC 20001-3753 -- please indicate the date of the broadcast. By the way, transcripts are $10.00 (plus $1.50 shipping/handling). In fact, anybody who wants to contact NPR should call Audience Services between 10 AM and 5 PM ET Monday through Friday. (Sorry, folks no 800 number.) Q. How can I find out about books and albums mentioned on the air? The booklist and album list produced by Erika Grams at WUNC is posted weekly on alt.radio.networks.npr and other appropriate news groups. They list books and albums reviewed or discussed recently on the NPR news programs. The booklists 6/93-Present are available via gopher sunsite.unc.edu under the NEWS! option or via anaonymous ftp sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/academic/literature/book-reviews). Q. How can I get my paws on some of the music I've heard on the air? PRMS 800 # to order music: You can order WBFO music (and the music of many public radio stations, and music mentioned in many NPR features) through the MAIL with PRMS (Public Radio Music Source). Order recordings (CDs & cassettes) heard on WBFO with the 800 #. Call 1-800-75-MUSIC That's 1-800-756-8742. Hours are 8am -- 1am. The # is toll free. CDs go for retail plus shipping/handling. Participating Public Radio stations, like WBFO, benefit from PRMS sales. PRMS tries to keep up-to-date with music heard on public radio as a service to public radio listeners. Q. Are there are books and articles about, or by NPR or NPR people? \"NPR - A Cast of Characters\" Thomas Looker, \"The Sound and the Story\" 1995 Anecdotal look at NPR's news programming Linda Wertheimer's new book collecting text of stories, commentaries, etc. from ATC's first 25 years, entitled \"Listening to America\". Numerous books by Garrison Keillor \"Car Talk\" by Tom & Ray Magliozzi, with Terry Bisson, published by Dell, 1991. And really, really trivial: Dan Zwerdling and his wife used to write neighborhood restaurant reviews for the Virginia Weekly section of the Washington Post. Noah Adams' book \"Fridays With Red: A Radio Friendship\" by Bob Edwards, about his relationship with Red Barber. 1993, Simon & Schuster, ISBN 0-671-87013-0. Dave Isay His book, \"Holding On\" (Norton, 1996) is based on a radio series he did for ATC. There's also a companion CD on Shanachie. If you can't find it, email him at soundports@aol.com or give him a call at his non-profit radio production office in NYC at (212) 353-2548. He has another book. \"A Way Out of Nowhere\" (Scribner) based on radio documentaries he did with two kids growing up on South Side of Chicago, coming out in June '97. \"The Puzzlemasters Presents\" (Times Books) is a collection of 200 of Will's best mind twisters heard on NPR's Weekend Edition Sunday. Robert Siegel's \"The NPR Interviews 1994 Susan Stamberg's bibliography (fragmentary, could use help fleshing this out): All Things Considered--10th anniversary 1981 American Women, A Political Portrait. 1982 April continental magazine 1983 The Battle of Midway 1982 The Best of All Things Considered 1985 Comedy journal 1982 A Conversation with Poet Laureate Rita D 1993 A Decade of change the world's women gat 1985 Dying, death and bereavement 1993 Eleanor Roosevelt remembered 1984 Elevators 1978 Every night at five : Susan Stamberg's 1982 Family and intergenerational relationships 1993 FDR rememberedd 1982 February continental magazine 1983 The future of aging 1993 Goodbye Saigon, hello Ho Chi Minh City 1985 How the body ages 1993 Hungary's \"market socialism\" 1981 Illness and disability 1993 Intellect, personality and mental health 1993 January continental magazine 1983 Q. How about recordings made by NPR people? (i.e. non-broadcast material) Bailey White's \"First Words -- Dead on the Road\" is available on cassette, and maybe CD, read by the author. Many other NPR commentators' works are also available...including Andre Codrescu, Tom Bodett, and Lynda Barry. I think the label (\"Dove\") is an offshoot of the \"Windham Hill\" label. Q. What's the relationship of NPR to PBS? See above. Q. How did NPR originally come about? National Public Radio was founded in the early 1970s, soon after the creation of the CPB. NPR owns and operates many geosynchronous communication satellites that are used to transmit not just NPR-produced programs, but also programs produced by CPB affiliated organizations. Q. Can I get NPR programming outside the US? NPR and PRI (Public Radio Int'l, formerly APR) can be heard overseas via satellite...to get the info you want, e-mail to: uspubrad@npr.org Be sure and tell the folks there where you are writing from, they are trying to gauge what kind of listenership NPR (and PRI) have overseas, and what kind of interest there is in this service. --- danatk@globalnet.co.uk (Daniel Atkinson) writes: All Things Considered can be heard on AFN in Europe on Mediumwave. The best signal is on 873khz, and 1107 and 1143 are also used. I think the morning edition is also aired too, most probably in our mornings if I correctly recall their ads for it. It's best just to listen around to find interesting programmes and note their time. Around this time of year (December) AFN can propagate the best part of 24hrs on 873khz. ATC is aired at about 21/22 UTC or sometime around that. Reception isn't brilliant, but it's listenable. Q. I've heard listener commentary on ATC/ME; how do I send mine in? All Things Considered Commentary Guidelines (courtesy of Ori Hoffer, transcript guru) The following are guidelines for submitting commentaries for possible broadcast. - Send a sample tape on cassette. - Include up to three commentaries on the tape. - Each commentary should be between 2 to 3 minutes in length-- approximately 250 words. Occasionally we accept pieces that are shorter or longer. - The tape does not have to be broadcast quality. If we decide to use your commentary, we will arrange to have it professionally recorded. - If the subject matter of your commentary is timely, please indicate this on your package. - Scripts should be included. - Tapes and manuscripts will be returned if you send us a self-addressed, stamped padded envelope. Manuscripts will be returned if you include a self-addressed stamped envelope. - Payment for commentaries that air is $150.00. - Send your tapes to: Commentaries, All Things Considered, National Public Radio, 635 Massachusetts Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20001 - You will receive a response within approximately 6 weeks. Thanks for your interest in All Things Considered and please keep listening. Q. I like public radio so much I want to work for them; now what? From Rich Dean of NPR: You can find the public radio Job Opportunities bulletin on NPR's gopher and Web sites.... its a long file (~130k), but pretty comprehensive and will save you $25/year in subscription costs if you don't work at a public radio station! gopher://gopher.npr.org http://www.npr.org/ ftp://ftp.npr.org Q. Where else can I look for radio info? Besides the places already mentioned, try KZSU's (Stanford) web site at http://kzsu.stanford.edu. Also try Chuck Taggart's home page, which lists non-commercial stations all over the country: it's found at ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/eamon/. Q. How is public radio funded? [ under construction ] -- listener contributions -- general-purpose grants -- directed grants -- state/federal funds Q. Is anybody saving all this? A. Yes. Besides lots of radio show collectors who probably have switched from reels of half-track tape to DAT :-), there is an official archive. The National Public Broadcasting Archives are at the University of Maryland, and are the official repository of NPR, PBS, CPB and some other organizations. You can find them on the web at: http://www.itd.umd.edu/UMS/UMCP/NPBA/npba.html Q. Are there any other resources out there? A. Yup. Here's one that I think is quite interesting, even though I've just started exploring it: http://www.dorsai.org/~rkchin/radioguide/zradio3.html This site has program listings for radio stations in the New York City area, as well as links to other sites. It's maintained by Rob Chin, rkchin@dorsai.dorsai.org. Q. Hey -- what about Mama Stamberg's Cranberry Relish recipe? Mama Stamberg's cranberry relish Ingredients: 2 cups cooked cranberries 1 small onion 1/2 cup sugar 3/4 cup sour cream 2 tablespoons horseradish Grind onion and cranberries together. Add remaining ingredients and mix well. Put into plastic container and freeze. Thaw in refrigerator a few hours before serving. Makes 1 1/2 pints.
