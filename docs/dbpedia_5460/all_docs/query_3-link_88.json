        "text": "ABC Classic FM is a classical music radio station available in Australia, and internationally online. It is operated by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It was established in 1976 as \"ABC-FM\", and later for a short time was known as \"ABC Fine Music\", before adopting its current name. It was the ABC's first experiment in FM broadcasting – which had become a necessity in Australia as broadcasters ran out of AM frequencies on which to transmit. ABC Classic FM's studios were established at the ABC studios in Collinswood, a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia. Adelaide is Australia's arts capital. The ABC's decision to establish ABC Classic FM in Adelaide was significant because most of the ABC's radio and television national program origination infrastructure is located in Sydney. ABC Classic FM, inspired partly by the example of BBC Radio 3, broadcasts classical music, operas, recitals, live concerts, jazz and music analysis programs. ABC Classic 2, a music-only talk-free streaming station, was established in June 2014. It broadcasts only via an online stream and is available on the ABC's Android and iOS apps.\n\nBBC Radio 3 is a British radio network operated by the BBC. Its output centres on classical music and opera, but jazz, world music, drama, culture and the arts also feature. The station is the world’s most significant commissioner of new music, and through its New Generation Artists scheme promotes young musicians of all nationalities. The station is notable for its broadcast of the BBC Proms concerts, live and in full, each summer in addition to performances by the BBC Orchestras and Singers. There are regular productions of both classic plays and newly commissioned drama. Radio 3 won the Sony Radio Academy UK Station of the Year Gold Award for 2009 and was nominated again in 2011.\n\nCBAL-FM is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts SRC's Ici Musique network at 98.3 FM in Moncton, New Brunswick. The station went on the air as CBAF-FM on April 15, 1983. It was the first station in Radio-Canada's FM service that didn't serve any portion of Quebec. It adopted its current calls in 1989 after Radio-Canada AM outlet CBAF-AM moved to the FM band and picked up the CBAF-FM calls."
