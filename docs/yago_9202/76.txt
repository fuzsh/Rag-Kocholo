Flor silvestre

1943. Mexico. Directed by Emilio Fernández. Fernández’s personal style first coalesced in this 1943 feature, with Pedro Armendáriz as the son of a pre-revolutionary landowner in love with a poor Indian woman (played by the impossibly photogenic Dolores del Río). Screenwriter Mauricio Magdaleno and cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa here join Fernández’s ongoing project to create an essential, mythological vision of Mexico for both domestic and international audiences. In Spanish; English subtitles. 94 min.
