At first I wish that God would always take care of her, that in addition all the interpretations she does are with “love” and finally that she would make melodies with feeling, to which the interpreter of La Llorona, argued that in the first instance she would have to be in love to carry out her grandmother's counselors to the letter.\n\nCurrently the performer of En realidad is on her tour started this 2022, which was part of the promotion of her album Mexicana Enamorada which is the third studio album and the second solo album that Angela has worked on.
