        "meta_description": "Mexican postcard by Sello, no. 216. Collection: Marlene Pilaete.\n\t\n\tOn 25 November 2020, Mexican singer and actress <b>Flor Silvestre</b> (1930-2020) passed away. She was one of the most prominent and successful performers of Mexican and Latin American music and was a star of classic Mexican films. Famous for her melodious voice and unique singing style, she was nicknamed &quot;La Sentimental&quot; (The Sentimental One) and &quot;La Voz Que Acaricia&quot; (The Voice That Caresses). Her more than 70-year career included stage productions, radio programs, records, films, television programs, comics, and rodeo shows.\n\t\n\tFlor Silvestre was born Guillermina Jiménez Chabolla in 1930 in Salamanca, Guanajuato, Mexico. She was the third child and second daughter of Jesús Jiménez Cervantes, a butcher, and María de Jesús Chabolla Peña. Her sisters Enriqueta and María de la Luz also became singers. Guillermina was raised in Salamanca and began singing at an early age. Her parents, who were also fond of singing, encouraged her to sing. She loved the mariachi music of famous Mexican singers Jorge Negrete and Lucha Reyes, and also sang songs that belonged to the pasodoble, tango, and bolero genres, which were popular in Mexico in the late 1930s. Her family moved to Mexico City and there she began her singing career. In 1943, when she was 13 years old, she debuted at the Teatro del Pueblo. Her next performance at the Teatro del Pueblo was in the play 'La soldadera' (The female soldier), directed by López Santillán. She played a girl who comes out of a railway wagon and sings 'La soldadera', a song written for her by José de Jesús Morales. The play was also broadcast by Mexico's national radio station, XEFO, and 'La soldadera' became the first song she performed on radio. XEFO announcer Arturo Blancas chose the title of Dolores del Río's film Flor Silvestre (Emilio Fernández, 1943), as the young singer's new stage name, so Guillermina Jiménez became Flor Silvestre, which means 'wild flower'. In 1945, she was announced as the &quot;Alma de la Canción Ranchera&quot; (Soul of the Ranchera Song), and in 1950, the year in which she emerged as a radio star, she was proclaimed the &quot;Reina de la Canción Mexicana&quot; (Queen of Mexican Song). In February 1950, she was a part of the &quot;numerous, hybrid, but useful cast&quot; of '¡A los toros!', a revue about bullfighting staged at the Teatro Tívoli. It was written and presented by announcer Paco Malgesto, who would become her second husband. In the revue, she sang Mexican musical numbers associated with bullfights. Also in 1950, she signed a contract with Columbia Records and recorded her first hits, which include 'Imposible olvidarte', 'Que Dios te perdone', and 'Pobre corazón'. In 1957, she began recording for Musart Records and became one of the label's exclusive artists with numerous best-selling singles, such as 'Cielo rojo', 'Renunciación', and 'Gracias'. Many of her hits charted on Cashbox Mexico's Best Sellers and Record World Latin American Single Hit Parade. She also participated in her husband Antonio Aguilar's musical rodeo shows.\n\t\n\tFlor Silvestre made her film debut in 1949 singing in Te besaré en la boca/I will kiss you on the mouth (Fernando Cortés, 1950). In 1950, Flor signed a five-film contract with Gregorio Walerstein, a leading film producer known as &quot;the Tsar of Mexican films&quot; She made her acting debut in his production Primero soy mexicano/First I am Mexican (1950), co-starring Joaquín Pardavé (who also wrote and directed the film) and Luis Aguilar and featuring Francisco &quot;Charro&quot; Avitia. She was reunited with Luis Aguilar and Francisco Avitia in the film El tigre enmascarado/The masked tiger (Zacarías Gómez Urquiza, 1951). She then appeared as the leading lady of actor Dagoberto Rodríguez in a film trilogy, El lobo solitario/The lonely wolf (Vicente Oroná, 1952), La justicia del lobo/Wolf justice (Vicente Oroná, 1952), and Vuelve el lobo/The wolf returns (Vicente Oroná, 1952). Between 1950 and 1990, she appeared in more than seventy films. Beautiful and statuesque, she became one of the leading stars of the 'golden age' of the Mexican film industry. In 1955, she appeared in her first color film, La doncella de piedra/The stone maiden (Miguel M. Delgado, 1956), one of the first Mexican CinemaScope productions. An adaptation of Rómulo Gallegos' novel 'Sobre la misma tierra', the film features Flor Silvestre in the role of Cantaralia Barroso, the mother of the novel's protagonist, Remota Montiel (played by Elsa Aguirre). Silvestre played opposite famous comedians, such as Cantinflas in the Eastmancolor comedy El bolero de Raquel/Raquel's Shoeshiner (Miguel M. Delgado, 1957). She received for the first time top billing in Pueblo en Armas/People in arms (Miguel Contreras Torres, 1959) and its sequel ¡Viva la soldadera!/Long live the female soldiers!(Miguel Contreras Torres, 1960). Director Ismael Rodríguez gave her important roles in the Mexican Revolution epic La cucaracha/The Soldiers of Pancho Villa  (Ismael Rodríguez, 1959) opposite María Félix and Dolores del Río, and Ánimas Trujano/The Important Man (Ismael Rodríguez, 1962) with Toshiro Mifune, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and won a Golden Globe. In 1960, she starred opposite the popular comedy duo Viruta and Capulina in Dos locos en escena/Two Crazy Ones on the Scene (Agustín P. Delgado, 1960). \n\t\n\tIn 1973, Flor Silvestre played one of Pancho Villa's lovers in La muerte de Pancho Villa (Mario Hernández, 1973), and played Felipe Carrillo Puerto's wife, Isabel Palma, in Peregrina (Mario Hernández, 1974). She sang 'La palma' in Simón Blanco (Mario Hernández, 1975) and played the female leads in Don Herculano enamorado/Don Herculano in love (Mario Hernández, 1975), El moro de cumpas/The Moor of Cumpas (Mario Hernández, 1977), and Mi caballo el cantador/My horse the singer (Mario Hernández, 1979). She made her final film, Triste recuerdo/Sad memory (Mario Hernández, 1990). She was also the star of the comic book 'La Llanera Vengadora'. In 2013, the Association of Mexican Cinema Journalists honored her with the Special Silver Goddess Award. In 2015, her documentary 'Flor Silvestre: su destino fue querer' premiered at the Guadalajara International Film Festival. The 24-minute documentary features interviews with Flor Silvestre, who recounts her life and career; her five children, Dalia, Francisco, Marcela, Antonio, and Pepe; and singers Angélica María and Guadalupe Pineda. Flor Silvestre married her first husband, Andrés Nieto, in the 1940s. She gave birth to her first child, singer and dancer Dalia Inés Nieto, when she was 16 years old. Around 1953, Flor Silvestre married radio announcer and bullfighting chronicler Francisco Rubiales Calvo &quot;Paco Malgesto&quot;, who would later become a famous presenter and pioneer of Mexican television. They had two children, translator Francisco Rubiales and singer and actress Marcela Rubiales. They lived in a house in Mexico City's Lindavista neighborhood. The couple separated and began divorce proceedings in 1958. Flor Silvestre's third and last husband was singer and actor Antonio Aguilar, who died in 2007. He was the love of her life. Their relationship began when they made the film El rayo de Sinaloa in 1957. They married in 1959 (or 1960, according to some sources) and had two sons who also became singers and actors, Antonio &quot;Toño&quot; Aguilar and José &quot;Pepe&quot; Aguilar. Aguilar built her a spacious home and ranch, El Soyate, northeast of Tayahua, Zacatecas. Flor Silvestre died on 25 November 2020 at her home in Villanueva, Zacatecas. She was 90.\n\t\n\tSources: Wikipedia and IMDb.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
