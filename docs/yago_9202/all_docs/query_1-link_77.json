In 1925 she came to the United States to begin an acting career that continued into the 1970s. She worked in American and Mexican films (she won four Arieles, Mexico's equivalent to the Oscar), and international productions, with such major directors as Edwin Carewe (who discovered her at a Mexico City tea party, brought her to Hollywood, and was instrumental in helping her career), Busby Berkeley, Clarence Brown, Emilio Fernández, Roberto Gavaldón, Francesco Rosi, Don Siegel, Raoul Walsh, and Orson Welles.\n\nAmong the reasons for her remarkable staying power were her skill in creating believable characters and a beauty that transcended age—she was as lovely at 65 as she had been at 25. Most importantly, she never allowed herself to be typed as the sexy Mexican spitfire who fractures the English language. She brought dignity to both leading and character parts, portraying with ease women of all social classes.\n\nSilent films had allowed Del Rio great flexibility in the roles she could play, with nationalities ranging from American Indian to Russian, Acadian, Brazilian, French, Spanish, and, of course, Mexican. In sound films she was more often cast as a woman of Mexican or Spanish descent because of her accent. Some of her most memorable roles in American films were as Charmaine in the World War I classic What Price Glory?, the Acadian woman who searches the bayous of Louisiana for her lost love in Evangeline, the stunning Brazilian heiress in Flying Down to Rio, a beautiful Polynesian native in Bird of Paradise, the title role in Madame Du Barry, the dancer Josette in Journey into Fear, María Dolores in The Fugitive, and a Kiowa Indian married to a white settler in Flaming Star.\n\nThe first American phase of her career lasted from Edwin Carewe's Joanna in 1925 to Orson Welles's 1942 Journey into Fear, after which she returned to Mexico. She may have seen new opportunities in her native land: by brilliantly assembling a top director, Emilio Fernández, a top cinematographer, Gabriel Figueroa, and a top leading actor, Pedro Armendáriz, Del Rio shortly became one of Mexico's leading box-office attractions. She continued to appear occasionally in some American films and television programs (for example, John Ford's Cheyenne Autumn and an episode of Marcus Welby, M.D.). By the 1970s she was devoting less time to performing and more to charity work in Mexico.\n\nIn her article \"Achieving Stardom\" in Breaking into the Movies, Del Rio wrote, \"my conception of a great success is . . . being capable of reflecting and impersonating all the beauty and cleverness of every different type of woman.\" In her long and varied career, she conveyed both the inner and outer beauty of her characters, and she did so with authenticity and dignity.\n\n—H.
