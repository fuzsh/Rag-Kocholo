        "text": "Guillermina Jiménez Chabolla (born 16 August 1930), known by her stage name Flor Silvestre (Spanish pronunciation: [floɾ silˈβestɾe]) (\"Wild Flower\"), is a Mexican singer and actress whose multifaceted career spans more than seventy years in music, film, radio, television, and stage. Famed for her melodious voice and unique singing style, hence the nicknames \"La Sentimental\" (\"The Sentimental One\") and \"La Voz Que Acaricia\" (\"The Voice That Caresses\"), Flor Silvestre is one of the most prominent performers of Mexican music, within the ranchera, bolero, bolero ranchero, and huapango genres. She has recorded more than 300 songs for three labels: Columbia, RCA Víctor, and Musart. In 1945, she was announced as the \"Alma de la Canción Ranchera\" (\"Soul of Ranchera Song\"), and in 1950, the year in which she emerged as a radio star, she was proclaimed the \"Reina de la Canción Mexicana\" (\"Queen of Mexican Song\"). In the early 1950s, she signed a contract with Columbia Records and recorded her first hits, which include \"Imposible olvidarte\", \"Que Dios te perdone\", \"Pobre corazón\", \"Viejo nopal\", and \"Guadalajara\". In 1957, she began recording for Musart Records and became one of the label's exclusive artists with numerous best-selling singles, such as \"Cielo rojo\", \"Renunciación\", \"Gracias\", \"Cariño santo\", \"Mi destino fue quererte\", \"Mi casita de paja\", \"Toda una vida\", \"Amar y vivir\", \"Gaviota traidora\", \"El mar y la esperanza\", \"Celosa\", \"Vámonos\", \"Cachito de mi vida\", \"Miel amarga\", \"Perdámonos\", \"Tres días\", \"No vuelvo a amar\", \"Las noches las hago días\", \"Estrellita marinera\", and \"La basurita\", among others. She has sung on radio stations, stage plays, films, television programs, and was an equestrienne in her husband Antonio Aguilar's horse show. Flor Silvestre appeared in more than seventy films between 1950 and 1990. Beautiful and statuesque, she became one of the leading stars of the \"golden age\" of the Mexican film industry. She made her acting debut in the film Primero soy mexicano (1950), directed by and co-starring Joaquín Pardavé. She played opposite famous comedians, such as Cantinflas in El bolero de Raquel (1957). Director Ismael Rodríguez gave her important roles in La cucaracha (1959), and Ánimas Trujano (1962), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. She was also the star of the comic book La Llanera Vengadora. In 2013, the Association of Mexican Cinema Journalists honored her with the Special Silver Goddess Award."
