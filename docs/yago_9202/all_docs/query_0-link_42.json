        "text": "The film begins with a scene of a reporter repeatedly questioning an artist about one of their paintings, a work depicting a nude indigenous woman named María Candelaria. The film then begins a flashback which takes place in Xochimilco, México, where most of the film takes place. María Candelaria and her lover, an honest man named Lorenzo Rafael, want to get married despite fierce competition from Lupe, another lover of Lorenzo, and hostility from Don Damián, the local merchant and exploiter of indigenous women. In order to raise money the young couple raise a pig, which Don Damián kills. Don Damián, determined to destroy the couple's relationship, does not give María the medicine she needs to combat malaria. Furious, Lorenzo breaks into his store and steals the medicine, which leads to his imprisonment. In order to raise money for bail, María agrees to model for a painter who eventually asks her to take off her clothes. María refuses and leaves. The painter completes the naked image with another woman, and the finished product, the one the audience sees at the beginning of the movie, is seen by everyone in Xochimilco, who think it is María Candelaria. An angry mob of townspeople chase María and stone her to death at the foot of the prison which holds Lorenzo. Miraculously, Lorenzo escapes the prison and hears the last words of María. He carries her body to the \"Canal de los Muertos\", the Channel of the Dead.\n\nSetting\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the first scene when we were introduced to María Candelaria, we can see María approach her community in a boat. This scene utilizes the space, the clothes, and the light to communicate that María is the protagonist of the movie, and therefore we are supposed to support her as an audience. Throughout the scene there is much distance between María and her community. The water is a physical barrier that represents the tense relationship, both in the present and in the future. This separation precedes all of the violence and disconnect between the two groups.\n\nFilm Still\n\nExplanation\n\nOverhead Lighting\n\nLorenzo, dressed in all white, is illumined by the bright sun high in the sky, while the shadow of the cross from the top of the church is seen in front of him. This type of overhead and harsh lighting (of the sun) and the resulting shadows enhance the melodramatic essence of the movie, since it emphasizes the fervor of this frame, in which Lorenzo appears before god in the hope that he and María can marry, despite their adversity.\n\nTimecode\n\n30:08\n\nFilm Still\n\nCostume\n\nThe Representations of the Clothing\n\nExplanation\n\nThe costumes throughout the film are representative of many things – the most notable are the representation of social status and good versus evil. In this frame, we can see the contrast between María’s tattered clothing, which represents her lower social status, compared to the other woman who is well dressed with flowers adorning her hair. Furthermore, we can see that the priest, along with the protagonist Lorenzo, are dressed in white to represent their purity and goodness, while Don Damián is dressed in black, hinting at his evil nature.\n\nTimecode\n\n45:41\n\nFilm Still\n\nExample\n\nRepresentation of the Indigenous Population\n\nExplanation\n\nMaría enters the scene surrounded by white flowers and a white dress, which invokes the symbol of the Virgin Mary. Even though María is part of the indigenous community, she is a protagonist, and so the audience is bound to support her. Since the community is opposite and distant from her it is the antagonist. In the film frame the crowd of people densely packed along the riverbank appear to be part of the actual shoreline, and seem to blend in with the trees and natural geography. The loyalties of the audience are reinforced by the mixing of the community with nature and their association with darker colors, almost as if the portrayal of light and dark communicates a correlation with something positive and/or negative. The movie invokes stereotypes associated with indigenous people – like nature and dark colors – to communicate antagonistic status. There is a negative association with the indigenous even though this film is supposed to represent the culture and history of the indigenous population. And beyond that, even though the audience is supposed to take María’s side, the representation of her is still problematic in that her autonomy is robbed and she is reduced to labels in her community. This is made evident by her vilification in life and sanctification in death.\n\nFilm Still"
