        "text": "Spectacle Every Day: Mexican Popular Cinema\n\nJuly 26 - August 8, 2024\n\nFilm at Lincoln Center\n\n“Spectacle Every Day: Mexican Popular Cinema,” is a sweeping retrospective of Mexican cinema from the 1940s through the 1960s, to be presented at FLC from July 26 through August 8. With new restorations of many works rarely screened or some never before seen theatrically in the United States, and standout performances from the biggest screen stars of their day, this series offers New York audiences the rare opportunity to experience the breadth of this unique period of Mexican film history on the big screen.\n\nThe 1940s through the 1960s was a period of exceptional creativity in Mexico that ushered in a monumentally prolific era of major filmmakers (among them, Roberto Gavaldón, Emilio Fernández, Julio Bracho, Alejandro Galindo, and Chano Urueta) and screen titans (María Félix, Fernando Soler, Cantinflas, Tin Tan, Ninón Sevilla, El Santo, Pedro Infante, Rebeca Iturbide, David Silva, and more). This series goes well below the surface of the era’s most well-known works to show its vast wealth of innovative filmmaking, and spotlights the rich, at times undersung, but always fascinating period and the exceptionally diverse body of films that enthralled generations of moviegoers and artists alike. From pitch-black noir, delightful comedy, and lurid melodrama—sometimes all in one film—to a 3-D swashbuckler, luchador-vampire horror, and a superhero film, these exquisite tales interpreted and radically influenced popular culture through sweeping productions that take us to grandiose wrestling rings, frenetic cabarets and nightclubs, exquisite haciendas, restless cities, and everywhere in between.\n\nAll screenings at:\n\nFilm at Lincoln Center’s Walter Reade Theater\n\n165 West 65th St., New York City\n\nAdmission: General admission is $17; students, seniors (62+), and persons with disabilities discount of $14; and $12 for FLC Members. See more and save with a 3+ Film Package ($15 for GP; $12 for students, seniors (62+), and persons with disabilities; and $10 for FLC Members).\n\nwww.filmlinc.org/series/spectacle-every-day-mexican-popular-cinema\n\nOrganized by Tyler Wilson and Cecilia Barrionuevo of Film at Lincoln Center in partnership with the Locarno Film Festival and with support from Cinema Tropical. This program was selected from the retrospective curated by Olaf Möller and Roberto Turigliatto at the 2023 Locarno Film Festival.\n\n“Spectacle Every Day: Mexican Popular Cinema” is sponsored by MUBI, the global streaming service, production company and film distributor dedicated to elevating great cinema.\n\nThis series is made possible by the generous support of Almudena and Pablo Legorreta.\n\nView Event →\n\nLas Premieres Presents BLACK RIO! BLACK POWER!\n\nBLACK RIO! BLACK POWER!\n\nA film by Emílio Domingos\n\n(Brazil, 2023, 70 min. In Portuguese with English subtitles)\n\nCo-presented by Brasil Summerfest.\n\nDomingos’ fascinating documentary explores the transformative power of soul music in 1970s Rio de Janeiro, where dance events became crucial spaces for the political affirmation and resistance of the young black community. Through the lens of the Black Rio Movement, the film highlights the role of music in the struggle for racial equality during Brazil’s military dictatorship and traces its enduring influence on genres like hip–hop and funk. It also examines the movement’s legacy on Black pride, aesthetic values, and the ongoing fight for racial justice, as seen through the experiences of movement leaders like Dom Filó and the impact on subsequent generations.\n\nSunday, July 21, 1pm*\n\nMuseum of the Moving Image\n\n36-01 35 Ave, Astoria, New York City\n\nBuy tickets\n\nScreening introduced by Brazilian Music and Soul DJ Greg Caz\n\nWatch the trailer:\n\nView Event →\n\nTheatrical Release of THE HUMAN SURGE 3\n\nTHE HUMAN SURGE 3 / EL AUGE DEL HUMANO 3\n\nA film by Eduardo Williams\n\n(Argentina/Brazil/Portugal/Netherlands, 121 min. In Spanish, Tamil, Mandarin, and English with English subtitles)\n\nA staggeringly original voice in modern avant-garde cinema, director Eduardo Williams follows The Human Surge (2016) with this woozy, orphic sequel about bands of friends wandering through a rain-slicked, windy, 360-degree vision of late-capitalist reality. But as they try to distance themselves from their depressing jobs, the groups find themselves lured towards the elusive mystery of new possibilities in this radically immersive, continent-spanning film from one of Argentina’s most experimental directors.\n\nOpens Friday, June 28\n\nBrooklyn Academy of Music\n\n30 Lafayette Ave. Brooklyn, New York\n\nWatch the trailer:\n\nView Event →\n\nFilm Forum Presents THE HEADLESS WOMAN\n\nTHE HEADLESS WOMAN / LA MUJER SIN CABEZA\n\n(Lucrecia Martel, Argentina, 2008, 87 min. In Spanish with English subtitles)\n\nFrom the director of La Ciénaga, comes this oblique, compelling tale of a poster child for the South American haute bourgeoisie: blonde and bland, perfectly coiffed and made-up, usually sitting behind the wheel of a Mercedes. María Onetto plays a woman whose perfect life may be a dream or whose nightmare accident (was that a child her car hit? a dog? or nothing?) may indicate that her entire existence lacks reality. Critics have referenced David Lynch and Luis Buñuel as forerunners for the kind of hyper-reality the film exudes. When the film played at the 2008 New York Film Festival, the Village Voice’s J. Hoberman wrote: “The third feature by Lucrecia Martel, leading director of the Argentine renaissance, is her strongest to date — at the very least, this brilliantly edited, purposefully disorienting comedy about a middle-aged woman’s post-car-accident confusion is the movie I’m most looking forward to revisiting.”\n\nWednesday, June 26, 6:20pm*\n\nFilm Forum\n\n209 West Houston St., New York City\n\nFor tickets and more information visit: https://filmforum.org/film/the-headless-woman\n\nFriends at Cinema Tropical are eligible to use our partner promo code: YFFJUNE26 for discounted tickets ($11 instead of $17).

Despite his lavish lifestyle, darkness looms over him due to his father's criminal pursuits. Yet, Yolcaut, portrayed by Manuel García Rulfo (renowned for his role as lawyer Mickey Haller in The Lincoln Lawyer), indulges Tochtli's every whim, even if it means acquiring an endangered Namibian pygmy hippo for his private zoo.\n\nBased on the celebrated debut novel by Mexican author Juan Pablo Villalobos and adapted by Academy Award winner Nicolás Giacobone (Birdman), Down the Rabbit Hole delves into the dichotomy of privilege and peril. Directed by acclaimed Mexican writer-filmmaker Manolo Caro, known for Tales of an Immoral Couple, Perfect Strangers, and the popular series The House of Flowers, this satirical dramedy navigates the complexities of Tochtli's world with poignant precision, offering a compelling exploration of innocence and corruption within a realm of extravagance.\n\nSunday, June 23, 2:45pm\n\nMuseum of the Moving Image\n\n36-01 35 Ave, Astoria, New York City\n\nFor tickets and more information visit: https://movingimage.org/event/down-the-rabbit-hole/\n\n*Q&A with screenwriter Nicolás Giacobone\n\nWatch the trailer:\n\nView Event →\n\nWorld Premiere of DON'T YOU LET ME GO at Tribeca\n\nTribeca Film Festival Presents:\n\nDON’T YOU LET ME GO / AGÁRRAME FUERTE\n\n(Ana Guevara and Leticia Jorge, Uruguay, 2024, 74 min.

In Spanish and French with English subtitles)\n\n“Valparaíso, Chile. A swath of trees sway in the distance with the passing wind as smoke billows and hovers over the trees—then the smoke quickly turns a shade of orange. In one immediate moment, wildfires erupt around the trees, quickly and aggressively escalating the precarious condition in the Chilean wilderness.\n\nThese are the challenges and dangerous circumstances that the volunteer fire brigade in the port city of Valparaíso frequently find themselves in. They’re aided in these struggles by a French fire brigade that arrives in Valparaíso to train—and instill methodology to—their Chilean counterparts. A warm and hospitable camaraderie is fostered between the Chilean and French firefighters as the country’s leaders and citizenry brace for the drafting of a new Constitution to repudiate the remnants of the pro-Pinochet dictatorship. Soon, civil unrest erupts on the streets, and, in parallel fashion, the wildfires quickly escalate around the city, disastrously impacting rural communities and neighborhoods. The brigades’ unified collective action must be implemented to effectively combat the ferocious flames.\n\nNicolás Molina’s Pirópolis is a visually-stunning masterwork. With an impressive visual language and a patient observational approach to capturing these volatile circumstances, the film potently foregrounds the power of community — as well as the unpredictable nature of our climate crisis.” —Jose Rodriguez\n\nSaturday, June 8, 5:45pm at Village East by Angelika\n\nMonday, June 10, 9:30am at AMC 19th St. East 3\n\nMonday, June 10, 5:45pm at AMC 19th St. East 3\n\nTuesday, June 11, 6pm at AMC 19th St. East 4\n\nView Event →\n\nLatin American and US Latinx Films at Tribeca 2024\n\n23rd Tribeca Festival,\n\nJune 5—16, 2024\n\nWith strong roots in independent cinema and aiming to champion emerging and established voices, the Tribeca Festival has been synonymous with creative expression and entertainment for decades.
