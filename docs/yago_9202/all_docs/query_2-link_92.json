During this chaotic period, Rosalío Mendoza (Alfredo del Diestro), a wily, well-to-do rancher, thrives by opportunistically supporting whichever faction appears at his hacienda's doorstep. When troops loyal to Emiliano Zapata arrive, Mendoza befriends their general, Felipe Nieto (Antonio R. Frausto). They become so close that the Mendozas name their first child after Nieto, and he becomes the boy's godfather. But what will Mendoza do when a rival faction offers him a huge sum of money to betray Nieto? In a national survey of film critics and historians in 1994, \"El Compadre Mendoza\" was voted the third best Mexican film ever made. Directed by Juan Bustillo. Spanish with English subtitles, 1h 25 minutes.

As the months go by, however, their idealistic fervor is ground down: first by tedium, then by the savagery of combat. After two die in battle and a third is killed by friendly fire, the survivors' patriotic zeal is slowly erased by the war's brutality. A humane and increasingly sorrowful look at the perversion of the Revolution's best intentions, \"¡Vámonos con Pancho Villa!\" was voted the best Mexican film of all time in 1994.
