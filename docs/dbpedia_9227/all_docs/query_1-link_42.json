More than 30K passers-by enjoyed the performances. Presented in partnership with the Alphadyne Foundation, Musical Storefronts provided work to artists severely impacted by the cancellation of live performances in a format that took into account all necessary health and safety measures for both artists and audiences.\n\nMusical Storefronts Home\n\nSpecial thanks to Jay Dweck, Milstein Properties, Steinway & Sons, the Lincoln Square Business Improvement District and Breads Bakery.\n\nStream a Merkin Hall Performance\n\nTake a Class or Instrument Lesson at Lucy Moses School\n\nSupport Kaufman Music Center's Music Education & Performance Programs\n\nMatthew Shipp Bio\n\nMatthew Shipp is one of the most creatively restless musicians in contemporary music. He is most immediately identified with the free end of jazz, and his notable peers have included bassist William Parker, saxophonist Ivo Perelman, and the late saxophonist David S. Ware. His playing is rooted in the blues and features complex harmonies, a sound that is simultaneously rich and unstable—chameleonic. His robust musical personality and the intelligence and organic logic of his playing make him easy to spot in any context, whether improvising or playing with contemporary classical musicians like Daniel Bernard Roumain, or with hip-hop heavyweights like Beans. Since the early 1990s, he has been steadily prolific, and so far this year has released the solo CD The Piano Equation on drummer Whit Dickey’s new Tao Forms label, and appears with Dickey (and trumpeter Nate Wooley), on the double-CD Morph on ESP-Disk."
