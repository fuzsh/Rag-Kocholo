        "text": "On the eve of the 2020 Presidential Election, composer Darius Jones presents his newest work, inspired by and sharing a title with James Baldwin’s essay “We Can Change the Country.” Jones is joined by the ensemble Freedom Time, which brings together an innovative and bright group of musicians devoted to justice and change-making.\n\nIn this work, Jones creates a compositional environment where a multiverse of boxes and zones carries the sonic textural language of varying perspectives. The instrumentation for the piece is ten voices, violin, bass, banjo, fife, drums, conductor, and film. Everyone is wearing masks, the vocalists are placed in social distancing circles, the musicians are spread six to twelve feet apart from one another, and a film beams light and images on the performers and the space. We Can Change the Country creates an environment of sensory overload as an attempt to reflect the mania-by-design of these past four years.\n\n“I wanted to create a piece that reflects the chaos that I feel our society is in and how we can’t seem to find balance. I’m hoping through witnessing and experiencing art that embodies this, that maybe it helps us find ideas and ways to combat what we are experiencing.”\n\nWe Can Change the Country will be presented virtually and available for free on a variety of streaming platforms. Roulette’s theater is currently closed for public performances as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the safety measures that Roulette has put in place to keep staff, artists, and the public safe.\n\nPhotos: Darius Jones\n\n(From left to right) Fay Victor, Sara Serpa, Amanda Ekery, Amirtha Kidambi, Aviva Jaye , Cooper-Moore, Gelsey Bell, Darcy James Argue, Stephanie Lamprea, Gerald Cleaver, Jean Carla Rodea, Tanya Kalmanovitch, Laura Sofia Perez, Charlotte Mundy, Yoon Sun Choi, Sean Conley\n\nFreedom Time\n\nVoices\n\nGelsey Bell\n\nAmanda Ekery\n\nJean Carla Rodea\n\nSara Serpa\n\nAmirtha Kidambi\n\nYoon Sun Choi\n\nAviva Jaye\n\nCharlotte Mundy\n\nFay Victor\n\nStephanie Lamprea\n\nBand\n\nTanya Kalmanovitch: Violin\n\nSean Conly: Bass\n\nGerald Cleaver: Drums\n\nCooper-Moore: Flute/Banjo\n\nConductor\n\nDarcy James Argue\n\nLaura Sofia Perez: Filmmaker\n\nDarius Jones has created a recognizable voice as a critically acclaimed saxophonist and composer by embracing individuality and innovation in the tradition of African-American music.
