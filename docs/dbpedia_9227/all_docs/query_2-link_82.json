His main instrument is the electric bass. He is active in the fields of rock and jazz , including in the New York downtown scene.\n\nRyan Sawyer is a musician deeply rooted in the New York improvisation scene.

Morgan (ex-Sightings, ex-Silk Purse) has been jamming with The Mysterious Norwegian (electronics, loops, vocals) for a period of time, the length of which is none of your damn business. You’re allowed to know that The Mysterious Norwegian is conservatory-trained but doesn’t care about it at all (which is precisely why you should). All five people at Remember The Ümlaüt, a Nü Metal Surrealism festival held annually in a different sketchy dude’s basement, raved about Rump State’s merging of high-brow dream theory with fractured clang and fidelity-challenging dirt. They have a full-length album due any minute on the Paris-based label No Lagos.\n\nScott Kiernan is a multi-disciplinary artist living and working in New York City. Through his video, photo and installation works, electronically synthesized and photographic elements interact to address their own materiality and means of distribution.
