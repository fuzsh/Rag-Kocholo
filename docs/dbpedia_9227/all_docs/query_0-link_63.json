        "text": "By Martin Schray\n\n2023 was a year of great loss for the world of free jazz and free improvised music. Not only have great musicians passed away, but also label operators such as FMP's Jost Gebers. Martin Davidson also died at the beginning of the month, a man without whom the British improv scene in particular would have been unthinkable. Davidson was responsible for EMANEM, one of the most influential labels of the last five decades, which was also the parent label of Evan Parker’s Psi label.\n\nMany musicians appreciated Davidson not only for his technical expertise in mastering, but above all for his passion for this music and for his sharp humour. His releases were not only professional, they were a testament to his dedication to the craft and the artists he worked with. The careers of Derek Bailey, Anthony Braxton, the Spontaneous Music Ensemble, Evan Parker or John Russell - especially their reception in Europe - would certainly have been different without him.\n\nDamon Smith and Henry Kaiser have published a musical obituary for him, which you can see here:\n\nWe have decided to refer to some milestones of EMANEM label.\n\nAnthony Braxton / Derek Bailey: Duo (1974)\n\nAnthony Braxton and Derek Bailey were not a duo that would have immediately been described as a match made in heaven in 1974. Braxton, despite his very brittle philosophy of improvisation, represented an undeniably American approach, while Bailey was a singular phenomenon even among the abstract Brits. Moreover, both were in a transitional phase. For a while, Bailey had concentrated almost exclusively on extended techniques, pitches and chords were of no concern to him. It almost seemed as if the guitar was just a means to an end. And then they both came up with an album that placed great emphasis on truly collective improvisation and listening to each other in order to create something completely new and unique. That may sound trite today, but the music still sounds so incredibly fresh and homogeneous that you can’t tell how old it is. What is more, it has one of best album covers of all time.\n\nBarry Guy / Howard Riley / Philipp Wachsmann – Improvisations Are Forever Now (1977 - 79)\n\nMartin Davidson has not only helped new talents to make their way, EMANEM has also re-released outstanding albums on CD for which one would otherwise have had to pay exorbitant prices on vinyl. Improvisation Are Forever Now (1977 - 79 ) is one such album. As I’m a big fan of all three musicians anyway (especially Howard Riley, who I think is always underrated), the choice of this album is no surprise. Riley is the rhythmic and harmonic center of gravity, relying heavily on his trademark clusters. Wachsmann and Guy scrub, saw and scrape around this center with their pizzicatos and glissandos. Like many EMANEM releases, there is a smorgasbord of contrasts here too, with meditative sections and fast-paced musical chases alternating at an incredible speed. The music has often been referred to as “insect music“, but the pejorative connotation contained therein could not be more wrong. Instead, there is great expressivity and energy to marvel at, as well as an extremely subtle shaping of the forms presented.\n\nJohn Butcher/Phil Durrant/Paul Lovens/Radu Malfatti/John Russell: News From the Shed (1989/2005)\n\nAnother great re-issue. News From The Shed was something like my initiation into what is called improv - and it was radically different from what I knew as (free) jazz or new classical music. With improv there was no planned structure, no preconceived form, the pieces only have the form that they develop spontaneously and the listener has to search for such structures, textures or parameters themselves. It was listening as work, which is why I was very disturbed at first, but then found more and more pleasure in discovering something new with every listen. The music by John Butcher (saxophones), Phil Durrant (violin and electronics), Paul Lovens (drums, cymbals and saw), Radu Malfatti (trombone, zither and accessories) and John Russell (acoustic guitar) is metallic and brittle, but then again organic and real. Crashing and creaking sounds are contrasted with quiet, long tones, it takes a while to discover the beauty of the music, but it is undeniably there. The recording was originally released on the Acta label in 1989. This CD reissue from EMANEM includes four additional tracks from the same sessions, which are of the same high quality as the original album and complement it in that they include some effects not heard elsewhere.\n\n-----\n\nFrom Nick Metzger:\n\nPaul Rutherford - The Gentle Harm of the Bourgeoisie\n\nWell, in the album's liner notes Martin Davidson himself said that this one “is probably the finest solo trombone album ever made.” I tend to agree with him, along with Derek Bailey who said “…this is still the best record of solo free improvising you are likely to find.” The liner notes of the CD reissue are full of this sort of praise. I’m still not positively sure that Rutherford wasn’t from a different planet altogether. This album is gloriously wild, subtle, innovative, and funny in all the ways it needs to be - and it still sounds totally fresh. A record for the ages, and a testament to Paul Rutherford’s unique genius.\n\nEvan Parker & Paul Lytton - Three Other Stories (1971-1974)\n\nEvan Parker & Paul Lytton - Two Octobers (1972-1975)\n\nBetween 1972 to 1977 Evan Parker and Paul Lytton released 3 albums of wild, experimental electro-acoustic free improvisation before their duo morphed into a trio with Barry Guy and took on a life of its own. The early Parker/Lytton duo albums are worlds apart from their work with Guy, including their work with electronic sounds and noise (with the exception of the first trio album) and can be seen as precursors for Parker and Lytton’s future work in their Electro-Acoustic ensembles. After 1976’s “Ra” there was nothing to hear from the duo until these two releases compiled several live and studio performances from 71-75 into two volumes of never-before-heard manna. These were released in 95 & 96, respectively, and at that time their previous duo releases were long out of print, so these came as a revelation to many.\n\nEvan Parker, Paul Lytton, Paul Rutherford, & Hans Schneider - Waterloo 1985\n\nThis one is just a great set altogether with a great quartet, one that sees Parker and Lytton with Rutherford and bassist Hans Schneider - who was working with Lytton at the time - filling in for Barry Guy. The recording is from Le Festival Jazz Et Musiques Improvisees in Waterloo on August 17, 1985. Parker and Rutherford sound amazing, the subtle interactions and playful suggestions keep you coming back. You can tell Lytton and Schneider had a great rapport at the time and it comes through in their careful playing. An excellent record that I highly recommend.\n\n-----\n\nFrom Fotis Nikolakopoulos:\n\nSpontaneous Music Ensemble –Bare Essentials 1972-3\n\nThere are some recordings that have a big impact on you, the listener. Quite rightfully I should add. Whenever I think about the importance of Martin Davidson’s Emanem, what comes first in mind is Face to Face by SME –a duo at the time consisting, as always, John Stevens and Trevor Watts.\n\nThis cd came out in 2007 and is proof that there was a lot more radical material for us to listen. And a label to publish it, a label dedicated to free improvisation. Emanem supported this kind of musical practice without referring to any kind of trends or hip sounds. Connecting Stevens’ liner notes from Face to Face with this double cd, we discover the essentials in non idiomatic music making. Non-hierarchical, produced on the spot, on a constant dialogue between the players, who share a wealth of ideas.\n\nIt’s much more than just Essentials, it’s music of the highest order and we have to thank Martin Davidson for letting it out to the world.\n\n-----\n\nFrom Lee Rice Epstein:\n\nJohn Carter and Bobby Bradford - Tandem 1 (Enamem 4011) & Tandem 2 (Emanem 4012) (released in a remastered single edition as Emanem 5204)\n\nJohn Carter and Bobby Bradford had a rare and beautiful partnership. Musical soulmates, their deep connection led to the recording of some of the most important records in the history of American free jazz, drawing from folk music, blues, American history, and the developments in new music happening from the 1950s all the way until Carter’s death in 1991. But no album quite captures the spark between them as effectively as Tandem, which presents two full concerts, a lengthy set from April 30, 1982, recorded at Worcester’s Piedmont Center for the Arts and a shorter set from October 20, 1979, when the duo played before the Art Ensemble of Chicago at UCLA's Schoenberg Hall. The sets feature Carter and Bradford playing and improvising on highlights from their catalog, including “Echoes From Rudolph’s,” “Circle,” “Angles,” “Woodman’s Hall Blues,” “And She Speaks,” and more. Each of them takes a solo turn, on clarinet and cornet respectively, and these plus the duets are utterly sublime. The two takes of Carter’s classic “Woodman’s Hall Blues” are must-hear for anyone who has spent time with his unique voice. Well worth also checking out Martin Davidson’s own writing for the liner notes, available online at http://www.emanemdisc.com/E5204.html\n\n-----\n\nReviews by us of Emanem albums (in reverse chronological order).

In particular, it seemed (and still seems) vitally important to document improvised music that does not use the vagaries of notation as a (somewhat imperfect) means of preservation. EMANEM features improvised music at its very best - unadulterated new music for people who like new music unadulterated. Every CD is a labour of love - every one an important masterpiece - too good to discontinue. (Why waste time, effort and resources on anything less?) Most feature total improvisation, but some use partly composed material. The presentation of each CD and this website concentrates on clarity (as does the music) - there is no desire to emulate the current fashion of obscuring and/or omitting vital information. But then, Emanem is not about fashion, it is about substance.\"\n\nEmanem is not RAP!\n\n\"I have been using the name Emanem since 1974, when the rapper who subsequently chose a similar name was only one year old. Therefore, if anything, it is he who is trying to cash in on my reputation, not vice versa. If you find this situation confusing, then please ask the rapper to change his nom de rap. Every so often I get requests from budding rappers to judge their rap. I reply that I am not qualified to do so, but that I can tell them that their spelling is poor.\n\nI once received an email from a lady in Greece saying that she loved me, but she lost interest when I pointed her to my website!\"\n\nBy Lee Rice Epstein\n\nOne of the most imaginative, dynamic artists, Darius Jones followed his first solo alto album (2021’s Raw Demoon Alchemy (A Lone Operation) ) with, arguably, the most impressive work of his career, thus far. His latest, fluXkit Vancouver ( its suite but sacred), commissioned by the Vancouver-based Western Front and released this fall in a collaborative venture between Northern Spy Records and We Jazz Records, debuts a new musical language, designed by Jones, that features, “extended technique moments to be unique to each individual player.” As with his albums in the Man’ish Boybook of music, the intersection of aural, visual, and physical is foregrounded on fluXkit Vancouver, bringing players and listeners together into a collaborative receiving space, where making the sounds that form the music intersects with experiencing the performance.\n\nThe group features a new recording lineup for Jones, with the great Gerald Cleaver on drums, and a nontraditional string quartet with Joshua and Jesse Zubot on violins, Peggy Lee on cello, and James Meger on double bass. Incepted in 2019, fluXkit Vancouver draws directly on Jones’s personal experience with the city. Jones had to restart workshops with the group after cancelling performances in 2020, and that break allowed the music to, in his words, “gestate.” In addition to the 25 visual directions created for this music, the gestation period seems to have provided the players with time to ruminate on all the ways they could perform the music—or, perhaps, in the parlance of a Fluxkit, assemble (as well as disassemble and reassemble) the components contained within.\n\nFluXkit Vancouveropens with a short, invocation from Jones, answered by Cleaver and Meger, who, throughout the album, straddles the roles of rhythm section and string quartet. As conceptually brilliant as the material is, Jones has rarely played with such clarity and depth of feeling. He sounds more exposed than even on Raw Demoon Alchemy, partly because of the way this music relies heavily on his subsequent direction and sublimation to the ensemble. It’s a dazzling performance, with superb leaps and references to traditional jazz, which he plays against occasionally spiky, modernist violin lines. The Zubot brothers, well versed in chamber, symphony, and jazz motifs, play brilliantly together with Lee and Meger, the collective sonic environment is warm, bold, and inviting.\n\nLyrically circular motifs, like aural curlicues, recur throughout, syntactical guideposts in the hour-long suite. And throughout, Cleaver’s pulsing swing showcasing, as always, his brilliance on the drum kit. Late in the final piece, “Damon and Pythias,” Lee moves forward with a cello line that could have come straight from Charles Ives or William Grant Still, over which Jones solos in the middle-to-lower range of the alto sax. The combination of folk and modern techniques is emphasized by the gradual addition of Meger and the Zubots, with the final minutes harkening back to the opening, a gorgeous and contemplative recessional. This will undoubtedly remain a high water mark for Jones as an emotionally rich, sweeping epic.\n\nShort documentary on the making\n\nAnimated score for “Zubot”\n\nBuy direct from Northern Spy Records\n\nfLuXkit Vancouver (i̶t̶s suite but sacred) by Darius Jones\n\nTony Oxley. Photo by Peter Gannushkin\n\nBy Martin Schray\n\nOnce the Jost Gebers, the man behind the seminal record label FMP, and Tony Oxley wanted to take Oxley’s drum equipment in a Volkswagen bus from West to East Berlin. At the GDR border a guard was checking them and was puzzled over what strange stuff was being transported. Gebers explained to him that Oxley was a drummer. When the border guard then found a violin, the matter was clear to him. Oxley had to be a musical clown. Now Tony Oxley, who was anything but a clown, and rather a phenomenal sound researcher, percussionist, violinist and electronic musician, has died after being sick for a long time.\n\nOxley was born in Sheffield and taught himself to play the drums. When he was drafted into the British army, he became a percussionist in the military orchestra. While serving, Oxley was able to travel to the United States where he heard jazz greats, such as Art Blakey, Horace Silver, and Philly Joe Jones live. To see these people live was a life-changing experience. Back home in Sheffield, he formed a jazz combo, which he led for three years. In 1963, he had another decisive encounter: He met guitarist Derek Bailey, who was living just around the corner. “A once in a century coincidence,“ as Oxley described the meeting to the German music journalist Bert Noglik . With bassist Gavin Bryars they formed a trio called Joseph Holbrooke (the band was named after a long-deceased British composer). The group started out playing jazz standards, but quickly evolved into other kinds of music, driven by the interests of the three. Bryars was interested in avant-garde classical composers, Oxley in the more radical players in contemporary jazz and Bailey in both. Improvised music was the common denominator that kept the trio going. It was music virtually unknown in England or elsewhere in Europe at the time. According to Oxley and Bailey the music developed virtually out of itself in the course of Joseph Holbrooke’s playing. In 1967 Oxley moved to London. Before long he had established himself as the house drummer at one of the city’s most popular jazz clubs: Ronnie Scott’s. Although Oxley had already moved beyond traditional jazz in his own music, he enjoyed performing with the players who had helped invent jazz - legends such as Ben Webster, Joe Hendeson, Stan Getz, and Bill Evans. Thus, he developed a distinctive rhythmic style. He was able to play time in form of polyrhythmic beats, without losing the original groove, just to pick it up later on. For many musicians he was a real challenge.\n\nOxley’s work at Ronnie Scott’s had given him a solid reputation as a jazz drummer although he had already connected to the freely improvised scene. In 1969, he performed on John McLaughlin’s first LP Extrapolation, and as a member of Miles Davis’s band the guitarist was already up and coming. His connection to him might have been the reason why Oxley was offered a recording contract by CBS and he was able to release The Baptised Traveller, which featured members of the Spontaneous Music Ensemble: Evan Parker on saxophone, Derek Bailey on guitar, Kenny Wheeler on trumpet, and Jeff Clyne on bass. The result was a vision of the future of jazz, hardly heard at that time. Oxley’s band even managed to make another record for CBS, Four Compositions For Sextet , Paul Rutherford on trombone augmented them. Commercially the albums were not successful, no wonder CBS sacked him.\n\nYet, Oxley was on the safe side as to money because of his engagement at Ronnie Scott’s, but in general improvised music in Great Britain didn’t do well. It was hardly possible for the musicians to find gigs, media and record labels simply ignored it. This was the reason why Oxley co-founded the Musicians Cooperative with Bailey, Parker and several other musicians in 1970. Another move was to start Incus Records, an independent artist-owned record label, with Evan Parker and Derek Bailey. Finally, the musicians were able to document their music, to release and distribute their albums without being dependent on the big majors.\n\nBut most of all, Oxley became the drummer who was so influential for future generations when he decided to expand his drum kit. He started to experiment with various forms of amplification and electronic devices such as ring modulators, for example. He especially liked to use them on the foreign objects he had incorporated into the kit: bowls, pieces of wire, screws, and other metal objects that were able to create a wide range of pure sounds. His already unique rhythmic style was linked to a new sound universe. From that moment on no one sounded like Tony Oxley.\n\nAs to music two more meetings were important in Toney Oxley’s life: The one with the painter Alan Davie, who gave him his first violin. Oxley was immediately interested in the rhythmic possibilities of the instrument (not the melodic ones, again typically Oxley) and so he decided working with string ensembles of all kinds. The other one was Oxley’s encounter with Cecil Taylor. He met him when the pianist had an FMP residence in Berlin during the summer of 1988. He played with him as a duo, with William Parker in the Feel Trio, and in the 17-piece Cecil Taylor European Orchestra. What is more, Taylor introduced him to Bill Dixon, with whom he also recorded several albums for the Italian Soul Note label. Oxley became Taylor’s favourite partner for the rest of the pianist’s life.\n\nTony Oxley oeuvre is so huge and various, it’s hard to give recommendations. His early recordings are certainly important landmarks for the development of European free jazz. The Baptised Traveller (CBS, 1969) and Ichnos (RCA Victor, 1971) with the same band, only that Barry Guy has replaced Jeff Clyne, are just spectacular. Tony Oxley (Incus, 1975) - also with the same collaborators (but Dave Holzworth is on bass and Howard Riley on piano) - must also be mentioned. Oxley’s trio with Riley and Barry Guy is definitely recommendable, for example Synopsis (Eminem, 1974). His work with Cecil Taylor is well-documented and almost all the releases are excellent. Above all, the first Feel Trio album, Looking (FMP 1990), with William Parker on bass is outstanding, possibly one of the best free music recordings ever made and one I hold especially dearly. As a duo the two developed a breathtaking energy, just listen to Leaf Palm Hand (FMP, 1989) and Ailanthus / Altissima: Bilateral Dimensions Of 2 Root Songs (Triple Point Records, 2009). Personal favorites of mine are his albums on Soul Note with Bill Dixon (trumpet), Barry Guy and William Parker on bass - Vade Mecum Iand II (1994 and 96).\n\n“I consider myself more a percussionist, in contrast to a jazz drummer who keeps time“, Oxley told Bert Noglik in the aforementioned interview. “In the new improvised music, a percussionist can interrupt the flow of his playing without affecting the nature of his relationship to the other players.“ Should St. Peter have checked Tony Oxley at the gates of heaven and the drummer had his stuff with him, he will surely not have taken him for a clown, but for what he is: one of the greatest drummers of the last 60 years. The jazz band in heaven can look forward to him.\n\nAnnotation: parts of this obituary are based on a text by Gerald E. Brennan on Tony Oxley\n\nWatch Mr. Oxley play:\n\nBy Gregg Miller\n\nAsh is the Mat Maneri Quartet’s second installment to a proposed trilogy, following up on the lovely Dust (Sunnyside, 2019), with a projected third recording (Mist) in the works. The quartet is Mat Maneri’s viola, joined by Lucian Ban (piano), John Hébert (bass), and Randy Peterson (drums). Maneri has played with Hébert since the 1990s, Randy Peterson since the late 80s, and Ban since around 2010. The communication across the 4 players feels effortless, always searching, never trite. Each of the three titles in the trilogy signals something evanescent, elusive yet omnipresent and uncontrollable, atmospheric.\n\nManeri’s music invokes a distinctive tone world: moody and sorrowful, a bit decrepit; earthy decay against a background of blight blanched by hazy sunlight. The lilting movement of sound over a windswept field of somewhat sickly wildflowers, muted yellows and reds, dull greens and browns. New classical, but in truth a jazz combo that has dropped the formalism, kept the nocturne, and added a torch singer carried by the viola veering in and around pitchless angst. Maneri’s viola is mourning incarnate. I could listen to the first three pieces of this recording on endless repeat.\n\nI first came to Mat Maneri’s musical concept listening to his triptych of records on Leo recordings: Fifty-One Sorrows (1999), Fever Bed (2000), and For Consequence (2003), and then his solo work on Trinity (ECM, 2001). (This is not even to mention his work with Matthew Shipp, or his HatHut recordings with his father, the late clarinetist/saxophonist Joe Maneri (though do check out Out Right Now (HatHut, 2001) with Joe Maneri and Joe Morris on guitar), and Dahabenzapple (Hat Hut, 1996)with Joe Maneri, Cecil McBee on bass, and Randy Peterson.) I was and remain very taken by his singular expressiveness. Within a fairly tight aesthetic, Maneri opens up a way of allowing the viola to speak its sadness. In his interview with DJ Michael Schell (on KBCS (Bellevue College) from this past October), Maneri jokes that he’s the “Goth Jazz guy.” But then more seriously, “I’ve always loved the melancholy. It speaks to me.” It speaks to him and through him to us, the halting implication that we share the world’s mourning.\n\nThe tracks on Ash are all of a piece. Viola rasping over and against the subtle but still cleanly tonal piano, the slowly throbbing bass, Peterson’s emotive percussion—no time, all emphasis, unraveling lines.\n\nHighlights from the record: The second track, “Dust to Dust,” captures a slow-motion mist, working it over 10 minutes. The liner notes read: “Dust to dust in which dust itself is a prerequisite for dust in which dust returns to dust and again . . . as if there is no end except in the coming back around of the end.” The cycle of eternal return. When Maneri drops off to let the piano-bass-drums trio do their thing, the effect is of a fog lifting. Ban plays lead and a mildly cheerful moodiness appears; Maneri returns and the tone is reset to the stoically tragic, face to face with the muted melancholy of our situation. On the third track, \"Earth,\" Peterson’s drum solo closing it out slowly over the last two and a half minutes is a thing of beauty. The final track, “Cold World Lullaby” has an Eastern European flavor. Romanian, perhaps. Less Maneri’s concept, than his concept applied to an adjacent genre. It works.\n\nI do wish John Hébert’s bass were better represented in its sonic detail. The quartet played Seattle as part of the Earshot Jazz festival in November, 2023. Brandon Lopez sat in for Hébert. In the new auditorium of Cornish College of the Arts, the sound was fantastic.\n\nAvailable at Bandcamp digital or CD:\n\nAsh by Mat Maneri Quartet"
