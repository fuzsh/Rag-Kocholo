Both of his tremendous artistic strengths are to the fore here in a fully committed trio communion with longtime collaboratorGerald Cleaver(drums) andChris Lightcap (bass). Five potent new Jones compositions, and a striking arrangement of \"No More My Lord\" (a prison song rec. by Alan Lomax at Parchman Farm).\n\nLegend of e'Boiis the 7th chapter (of 9 on completion) in Jones' expansive Man'ish Boy epic, begun with AUM Fidelity in 2009. As deeply personal a project as ever; the themes remain universal. Includes liner notes by acclaimed writer and poetHarmony Holiday, cover art photography of Jones himself, and additional artwork by Risha Rox.\n\nDarius Jones has received wide acclaim not only for his albums featuring music & images evocative of Black Futurism, but also for his commissioned work as a composer throughout the U.S. and Canada. Jones' fLuXkit Vancouver was ranked #3 in The Wire's Top 50 Albums of 2023 and chosen among NPR's 50 Best Albums of 2023.\n\nLegend of e'Boi (The Hypervigilant Eye) CD edition is presented in a deluxe 6-panel digipak with 16pg booklet ; the LP is a limited edition of 600 on black vinyl, includes insert & full-res download card with 2 additional tracks.\n\nDarius Jones: composer, alto saxophone\n\nGerald Cleaver: drums\n\nChris Lightcap: bass\n\nDescription\n\nLegend of e'Boi (The Hypervigilant Eye) is the powerful new work by composer & alto saxophonist Darius Jones.
