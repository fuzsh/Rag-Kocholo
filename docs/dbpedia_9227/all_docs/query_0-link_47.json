        "text": "Not In Praise of Poison (NIPP) is an album embodying multicultural collaboration that represents and explores archival processes about immigration, the experience of black women, and political transcendence in both internal and external states of being and mind. Written by Gugulethu ‘Dumama’ Duma and Dylan ‘hunterchee’ Greene with elders, Shahzad Ismaily and Christopher Botta, the work is named in honor of both protest and Jean-Michel Basquiat’s journaling. NIPP focuses heavily on the complexities and similarities of the histories and current political climates present in South Africa, the United States, Pakistan, and China - places of heritage for the project's leading composers, producers, and artists - in an attempt to create more solidarity and solutions for and between one another when it comes to their tandem humanitarian crimes. Resistance tools such as decolonization, demilitarization, criminal justice reform, and a resistance to aparthedid-conomics, play a major role in the lives of those oppressed by larger powers and such refractions and reflections are cast in sound here. We found like minded creations and interpretations in the music of Angel Bat Dawid, Makaya McCraven, and Perrin Moss. Paired with the influence of multidimensional thinkers, poets, and writers such as bell hooks, Koleka Putuma, Ben Okri, and Marcus Scott, Dumama and hunterchee express a fraction of those voices through the Politics of Care, Eating the Other, Rupture, The Interference Archive, Caring for Captivity, Mama Carries Wood, Quite Suite, A Loud Tender, and The Nature of Direarchy.\n\nNIPP traces the prismatic relationships within and around a tryptic of themes - inner voice, self care, and interruptions - felt, explored, viewed, and sung from three angles: a child daughter, an adult mother, and an elder grandmother. On the record, these narratives converse, overlap, and become one another in a multiverse of lived experience and study. Such a framework or quantum realm, provides a garden full of questions to feed and observe. The natural tensions and contradictions of these narrative paths that intertwine and punctuate each other created confusion, distraction, and the need for re/unframing. Each became a source for inspiration and drive.\n\nThe Xhosa musical tradition is rooted by the practice of reflecting realities back to the community, connecting and mediating individuals’ inner realities with functions of everyday life such as birth, war, pain, recreation, ritual and ultimately, histories re-enacted. This approach is integral to the myths and metaphors, narratives and allegories present in NIPP. We let this interplay of written and unwritten, pre-written and post-written, run wild by blending Xhosa folk music with American minimalism, and free improvisation with contemporary classical modernism via RnB. It’s from this unique palette that we paint stories in which we proudly represent, promote, and add to the voices of Black Womxn composers in both the classical and jazz arenas. Arenas that must heed the global call for clear support and representation. As teachers currently working to reform prison pipeline complexes and to archive voices of cultural practitioners, we envision a series of composition workshops for teens facing issues and themes we address. NIPP is decolonization through artistic action."
