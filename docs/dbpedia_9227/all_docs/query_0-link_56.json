(Chinen)\n\n★ Terence Blanchard (Wednesday through June 24) In certain circles Terence Blanchard may be best known as an accomplished film scorer and a newly established Broadway composer; around the jazz ecosystem he’s known for his trenchant trumpet playing, and for favoring a postbop sound informed by myriad sources.

For this double bill, presented by 92YTriBeCa and “The Checkout,” a program on WBGO-FM (88.3), Mr. Penn will work with the saxophonist Seamus Blake, the guitarist Adam Rogers and the bassist Ben Street.
