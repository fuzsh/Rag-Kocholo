        "text": "Critically acclaimed saxophonist and composer Darius Jones has created a recognizable voice by embracing individuality and innovation in the tradition of African-American music. Jones has been awarded the Van Lier Fellowship, Jerome Foundation Commission, Jerome Artist-in-Residence at Roulette, French-American Jazz Exchange Award, and, in 2019, the Fromm Music Foundation commission at Harvard University. Jones has released a string of diverse recordings featuring music and images evocative of Black Futurism. His work as a new music composer for voice culminated in a major debut performance at Carnegie Hall in 2014. Jonesâ€™ music is a confrontation against apathy and ego, hoping to inspire authenticity that compels us to be better humans."
