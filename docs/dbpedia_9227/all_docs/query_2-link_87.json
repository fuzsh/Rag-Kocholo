Orders with both pre-order and in stock items will have all in stock items shipped immediately!\n\nJazz Saxophonist & Composer's 2023 Album on Vinyl LP!\n\nDarius Jones has created a recognizable voice as a critically acclaimed saxophonist and composer by embracing individuality and innovation in the tradition of Black music.\n\n\"Jones makes his point by showing, not just telling. His compositions are so intensely honed and performed they seem to talk, moan, and cry about intimate experience in ways we might expect to find in novels, not instrumental records.\" – Daniel Felsenthal, Pitchfork\n\nCommissioned by Western Front, an artist-run centre in Vancouver, Canada, with a legacy of continuing support for multidisciplinary exchange, experimentation, and the avant-garde. This project was developed by Darius Jones across a succession of residencies at Western Front in 2019 and 2022.\n\nRecorded in June 2022 at Western Front's Grand Luxe Hall in Vancouver, Canada, fLuXkit Vancouver (i&ZeroWidthSpace;̶&ZeroWidthSpace;t&ZeroWidthSpace;̶&ZeroWidthSpace;s̶ suite but sacred) is the first collaborative release with Brooklyn-based Northern Spy and Helsinki-based We Jazz Records.\n\nAs Harmony Holiday writes in her liner notes, included with this release: \"The playing here is gorgeous, but what stands out most is the rigor of the compositions, which feel like tributes to Sun Ra's call that 'only the impossible happens.' Their mood is expansive, gleeful, wistful, sometimes frantic, but so coherent and poised at every turn that all you can do while listening is marvel at this fluency in the language of will and won't that lives here alone.\"\n\nA multi-part suite that moves with the dramatic sweep of a dangerous weather pattern or the creaking heave of a wooden cargo ship fighting through a turbulent ocean. The roots of this work reach down into other jazz meets chamber works like Ornette Coleman's Skies of America or Kronos Quartet's collaborations with John Zorn but there's something that feels so much more tightly controlled and compact about this work — a ticking time bomb of screeches and drum assaults and sax screams that threaten to cause widespread damage to the world's infrastructure. Do as I did and keep your listens to this amazing LP relegated to headphones and ensuring that the only harm it does is to your eardrums.\n\n-Robert Ham, Paste Magazine\n\nFeatures\n\nVinyl LP\n\nTip-On Jacket\n\nLiner Notes by Harmony Holiday\n\nLimited-Time Download Card\n\nMusicians\n\nDarius Jones alto saxophone, composer Gerald Cleaver drums Jesse Zubot violin Josh Zubot violin Peggy Lee cello James Meger bass"
