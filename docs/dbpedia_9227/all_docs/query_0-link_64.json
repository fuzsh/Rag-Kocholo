Parker's words are further illuminated by deeply sensitive sound design created by a likewise devoted artist on the same path, producer and singer Ellen Christi. William Parker's music -- in its vast scope and range of form -- has been an elemental nutrient of countless listeners lives for nigh on five decades. William's words -- whether published on page or spoken from the stage -- are part of that music. They speak on the beauty of life itself, amplifying the light of life ever-present, even in exceptionally difficult circumstance. As his first artistic expression, Parker began writing as a young person growing up in the South Bronx projects, presenting an alternate perception of often bleak surroundings and living conditions in the neighborhood. This early awareness that there was another way of being in the world, has suffused his development into a singularly generous artist and human being. Ellen Christi's singing brings that same affirmation in the beauty of life. She and Parker's previous work together, The Majesty of Jah, is a tremendous feature for her voice. That album also includes the track, 'Baldwin,' with James Baldwin's ever-powerful words and voice resonating even more profoundly within the sonic architecture created around them by Christi. When Ellen got in touch to say that she had begun work on a similar album-length project, centered on William's spoken texts, Aum Fidelity immediately asked that she please send the pieces as she finished them.

World-renowned and revered bassist-composer-leader William Parker has performed and recorded extensively with both Cooper-Moore and Hamid Drake over the past 30+ years. And, the three of them have been core since 2012 in Parker's reborn In Order To Survive quartet. Heart Trio is, remarkably then, their debut as a trio on record. William here plays doson ngoni, dudek, and flutes of bamboo, cedar and walnut. Cooper-Moore on his hand-crafted ashimba and harp; Hamid Drake on frame drum and drum kit. All of this music was collectively composed at the time of its creation. Heart Trio creates balancing music in a world which day to day is more evidently filled with the exponential effect of increasingly grotesque inequity, a world where wars continue to be started and maintained by men adept at manipulation and a thorough disregard for the sanctity of life. Heart Trio creates organic music played on organic materials in a world of exponentially accelerating 'technologies' whose primary stock-in-trade is to transform listeners into more readily exploitable data sets. Yes, Heart Trio creates balancing music, antithetical to destruction. Music to draw sustenance from. Some measure of fortitude, at least, for compassionate souls in the elevating struggle against increasingly inextricable imposed realities that parse a human being's value solely on what they are able to consume. This is music for sunrise and sunset. Daily music. Healing, centering, mantra, heart music. From William's notes included with the release: 'The theory behind this music is the music itself. Empty and fill the heart and soul with sound, letting it dance. Without pretense. We are trying to get to a flow -- Earth, sky, and flowing water sounds that jump out of the painting.'\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nAUM 118LP\n\nLP version. \"Heart Trio features three lifelong-devoted fellow travelers on the path of healing through sound.

A super-group of our time, all profound creative artists in their own right, rocking mightily together, in their prime. 21st Century progressive rock played by punk rockers with serious improv skills and jazz feel.

Painters Winter features the trio of Daniel Carter -- reeds, trumpet, flute; William Parker -- bass, trombonium, shakuhachi; Hamid Drake -- drums. Carter & Parker have been perpetual space-ways traveling companions since first meeting & immediately beginning to channel music together in early 1970s NYC. Their work together in Other Dimensions In Music with Roy Campbell & Rashid Bakr for well over two decades manifest in bountiful music for the ages. They have recently been featured together in similar majestic open form on the album, Seraphic Light. Here, Carter again brings the full assembly of instruments he has for decades been a master of: trumpet, alto & tenor saxophones, clarinet and flute. Likewise, Hamid Drake is a musician's musician; one of the most in-demand drummers in the world. He is in command of a vast lexicon of drum languages, learned and absorbed directly. His frequent flyer miles could get him a ticket to Saturn and back. Drake & Parker launched their devoted 'two-man big band' partnership in 2000 and haven't stopped since. In trio with Daniel Carter, they've created one previous album together, Painters Spring, released that same year. Drake has made mention of his awe that William could pick up any new instrument and make beautiful music with it from jump. The title track of Painters Winter features Parker on trombonium, one of those many instruments that he plays beautifully on. The track 'Painted Scarf' features Parker on shakuhachi, upon which he has clearly become a master. Regarding this album's title, Parker elucidates, 'It speaks to those who paint with sound, in different landscapes, to celebrate the coming of the seasons: winter spring summer and autumn. Acknowledging the entire universe of world jazz music. Discovering the undiscovered.' And from his liner notes, 'The music on this album is a tribute to the flow of rhythm as melody and pulsation.

Ware Archive Series was launched in November 2015, and AUM Fidelity has marked the anniversary of his birth -- November 7, 1949 -- with a vital new edition therein every year since. David S. Ware was a master saxophonist of the highest order, and an unparalleled sonic alchemist of the modern jazz era. As his distinctly potent sound & vision was an integral inspiration toward the creation/devotion of AUM Fidelity, that mission continues strong with the DSW-ARC series. Théâtre Garonne, 2008 presents a luminous concert from a transitional period in David S. Ware's ever-creative life. His 17-year-longstanding Quartet with Matthew Shipp & William Parker, which had achieved a naturally ascendant worldwide acclaim, performed their final concerts on a triumphal European tour in March 2007. Knowing that this end was coming, David had already begun writing new compositions and conceptualizing what would become his new quartet. The first iteration of this group -- foundationally with guitarist Joe Morris -- debuted at New York's Iridium jazz club in mid-July. The group was made whole with Ware's stalwart musical companion William Parker back on bass and fellow master musician Warren Smith on drums.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nAUM 112CD\n\n\"Eri Yamamoto transcends jazz, classical and folk forms to create a stunning new suite for jazz trio & 50-member choir. Eri Yamamoto transcended jazz, classical and folk forms in creating her new work : for jazz trio & 50-member choir. She has seamlessly melded biography, group improvisation and far-ranging compositional vocabularies in a momentous seven-part suite, featuring her longstanding trio in collaboration with New York-based Choral Chameleon, directed by its award-winning founder, Vince Peterson. The suite is based off of the 'Goshu Ondo,' a traditional circle dance song from Shiga, Japan, where it was sung during the summer Bon festival to warmly welcome ancestral spirits. The suite commences with the folk song's melodic kernel from which the rest blooms. Choral Chameleon's heterophony, polyphony and unison singing interweave with Yamamoto's trio, often with gorgeous open vowels evocative of natural scenes in works ranging from Claude Debussy through Charles Ives to Duke Ellington. All is bolstered by gentle trio improvisation, Ambrosio and Takeuchi propelling the band forward and ultimately building to a life-affirming choral unison. As the final movement's ecstatic and celebratory rhythms surge, crest and dissipate and the various musical threads converge, a sense of transcultural journey is palpable, of many and disparate experiences existing in luminous multi-communal nexus. The coda composition performed by the trio, 'Echo of Echo', provides a final moment of reflection, mirroring the suite's ultimate descent toward silence; demonstrating, again, that the part is in the whole, which far exceeds the sum of its components.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n2CD\n\nAUM 108-09CD\n\n\"A tremendous pair of brand new studio albums created by drummer-leader Whit Dickey together w/ two distinct yet interrelated Quartets. All involved here have long been deep seekers of truth through sound, and between them is a luminous web of deeply affecting work, which now spans decades. This Yin & Yang pair presents their very latest work together. Peace Planet features Matthew Shipp-piano, Rob Brown-alto sax, William Parker-bass. Box of Light features Rob Brown-alto sax, Steve Swell-trombone, Michael Bisio-bass. Having left an indelible mark via classic albums under the leadership of David S. Ware and Matthew Shipp, the projects which drummer Whit Dickey led & produced in the ensuing years regularly brought out the best from all involved. That is most definitely the case here. A united pair of albums created this past Winter, the two works represent the Yin and the Yang respectively. Dickey chose Tao Quartets as the name of the groups for this work as the Tao wholly incorporates an understanding of Yin Yang, and that same understanding is here to be heard. Representing the Yin is Peace Planet: a fluid, supple and dynamic flow of instantly composed wonder; each of the pieces presents as a mini-suite, with astonishing cohesiveness. Gentle lyricism and rhythmic/melodic invention abound. Also of note here is 'Suite for DSW' -- a paean to Dickey/Shipp/Parker's former bandleader, David S. Ware, whose profound and enduring inspiration is deeply felt by all. Box of Light brings the Yang herein, with fiery energy and crackling interplay to the fore. The inspiration of Dickey's early studies with Milford Graves are clear here, as is the precedent set by such as the New York Art Quartet (feat. Graves/Tchicai/Rudd). It is likewise clear that the idea of total sensitivity, to each and from each musician toward the evolution of the music, is also to the fore. After an extended period of realignment with his central creative essence, it was AUM's great pleasure to present the re-emergence of Whit Dickey as a leader in 2017 with the exquisitely rendered Vessel in Orbit, a trio work featuring Shipp and violist Mat Maneri. Thankfully, as can be heard on these brand new recordings (and yet more to come), that album was just the beginning of his creative re-birth.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n2CD\n\nAUM 110-11CD\n\n\"Live/Shapeshifter is the exemplary new double-album from one of master bassist-composer-improviser William Parker's eternal flagship groups, recorded live & presenting all-new compositions, including the extended suite 'Eternal Is The Voice Of Love', along with a new iteration of the band's theme. Featuring pianist Cooper-Moore, alto saxophonist Rob Brown and (since 2012) drummer Hamid Drake, In Order To Survive is one of the great jazz groups of the past quarter century. Launched in 1993, In Order To Survive was Parker's first fully dedicated small group. It has always featured Cooper-Moore & Rob Brown, together with a series of drummers (including Denis Charles, and then Susie Ibarra) and occasional additional brass/reeds. A top live draw in New York during the heights of that heady decade, they made momentous visits to Europe as well. This initial phase culminated on record with their first double-live set, The Peach Orchard, an era-defining work released by AUM Fidelity in 1998. The dawn of the new century saw the launch of a new William Parker Quartet, featuring drummer Hamid Drake, Brown, and trumpeter Lewis Barnes. The impeccable albums O'Neal's Porch, Sound Unity, Corn Meal Dance and Petit Oiseau were all created during that first decade. In Order To Survive first reconvened at the 2012 Vision Festival on occasion of AUM Fidelity's 15th Anniversary celebrations. That set of new work was released as part of the Wood Flute Songs box set, hailed as a 5-Star Masterpiece by DownBeat, and as the #1 Archival Release of the Year by The Wire. In October 2016, IOTS entered the studio for the first time since the Compassion Seizes Bed-Stuy session of 1995. This work was presented as half of the exquisite double-album, Meditation/Resurrection, released in July 2017. Two nights were booked at ShapeShifter Lab in Brooklyn to celebrate its release. 'A mid-summer guided self-illumination' was promised on the handbill for these concerts. Live/Shapeshifter presents both sets of night two.

Ware concert, in trio with William Parker and Warren Smith. A tenor sax / bass / drums excursion of full intensity from the first note, this suite of spontaneous form was created at NYC's Vision Festival in 2010. Ware had been a perennial at this vital annual gathering since its beginning; this was his first time back since his revered Quartet bid farewell there in 2006, and it was a wholly exhilarating return. This DSW Trio convened only three times over their 10 month existence: the Dec. 2009 studio session for Onecept, this June concert, and the Oct. 2010 album release celebration at the Blue Note in NYC [documented on Live In New York, 2010]. Also included here are four exceptional out-takes from the Onecept session -- all of which had been completed and considered for inclusion at that time. This new release, together with the aforementioned, present the total work which this group created. Each of their three communions has its own flavor: Onecept deals exquisitely with space and purposefully featured David on three different horns (tenor, stritch, saxello), with Warren Smith on tympanis/percussion in addition to drum set. The night at the Blue Note features the most extensive documentation of Ware on alto sax in existence (a straight version; the stritch), with the Mid & Far-Eastern tones he brought forth on the instrument blossoming beautifully over the course of two sets in an intimate setting.

Ware and his latter day Trio in an intimate club setting -- the Blue Note on October 4, 2010. Featuring his perennially steadfast musical partner William Parker on bass, and equally incomparable Warren Smith on drums, they were celebrating the recent release of the studio album, Onecept (2010). Having played an electrifying set at Vision Festival in June, this extended night in October was the third and final magnificent time on which this trio convened. Appearances at jazz clubs in New York were rare for Ware. The two hour+ sets, with repast in-between, allowed him and group to inhabit the space; afforded more time to stretch out and breathe with the music. As Ware was exclusively dealing with spontaneous forms during this period in his creative life, the six extended suites here were newly created on that night. None of these fantastic multi-track recordings have been previously released. The other highly distinctive aspect of this performance was Ware's use of his Beuscher straight alto saxophone, or stritch, which features on four of the six pieces. While pieces featuring this instrument appear on three albums recorded & released in the last years before his passing, this recording is by a great measure the most extensive documentation that exists of David S. Ware on alto! Further to his absolute command & control, he brought forth Middle & Far Eastern sonorities on the instrument, which served his modus operandi of music as a transcendental experience very well indeed. The final pieces of each set here feature him on his trademark tenor sax, upon which he earned -- and then some -- his status as a saxophone colossus.

At the core of both groups is Parker's foundational bass together with rhythm twin, drummer Hamid Drake. Their partnership -- two decades deep now -- is one of the greatest in the history of drums & bass. Alto saxophonist Rob Brown -- a supremely gifted improviser, as is every musician here -- is likewise present throughout. Pianist Cooper-Moore features on album/CD2.

As William writes in the notes, 'Cooper-Moore is one of the special people who speaks and plays from the heart all the time with power and grace. If my music has had any success in last 20 years it is because he has been a major inspiration and contributor.' Cooper-Moore will be the Lifetime Achievement Honoree at the 2017 edition of the Vision Festival, NYC. Trumpeter Jalalu-Kalvert Nelson appears on album/CD1.

William Parker's exceptional gift as a composer of beautiful melodies and infectious rhythms have long been intrinsic to his art, and it has always been on full display in the work of the quartets featured here.

Ware as a bandleader. Recorded in New York, April 1977, the first disc features material originally released on LP by the Swiss label, hat Hut Records -- out of print for over 30 years. The second disc features a full additional album of top-shelf material from those same sessions that have never been released in any form. This definitive edition was sourced from the original analog 8-track tapes, and was newly mixed & mastered in 2015. Crucial material. Stunning performances & fidelity. Ware's band here, featuring Cooper-Moore on piano and Marc Edwards on drums, was known as Apogee. This long-standing & incessantly active collective trio formed in Boston (Ware attended college there) in 1970, relocating to NYC in the early 70s to create their own space within the jazz loft scene of the time. In 1973 they were invited by Sonny Rollins to open for him at the Village Vanguard. Not long after arriving in NYC, Ware began performing extensively with Andrew Cyrille's group Maono, and, together with Marc Edwards, joined the Cecil Taylor Unit. In 1977, at Ware's request, Apogee reconvened to document their essence in a proper studio setting. Birth Of A Being could not be a more perfect title for these recordings, as it was here that David S. Ware's concepts for jazz ensemble were first elucidated; concepts that would further blossom within the legendary David S. Ware Quartet which he launched a decade after the initial release of this work. Birth features Ware's compositions & the mesh of Apogee's deep foundation of collective synergy with his vision at time of recording. Exceptional clarity, control, and utter logic in elocution; with intent to get to the breathing heart of music itself. The tenderness and intensity of feeling on full display in all of his work here is humbling. This 2CD set is the fitting first in a planned series of David S.
