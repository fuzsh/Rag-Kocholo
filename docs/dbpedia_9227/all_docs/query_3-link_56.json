        "text": "Hey friends,\n\nThe season is in full swing and I have some upcoming events that I’m really excited about. This weekend, I’ll be joined by two of my favorite musicians, Qasim Naqvi and Rafiq Bhatia to perform at the Ragas Live Festival at Pioneer Works. I’m excited about this collaboration not only musically, but also in terms of our capacity to build solidarity with our Pakistani family in the diaspora, challenging the hard lines drawn in our respective motherlands. For me ‘Raga’ is an impossible to define and expansive concept, ever evolving and ever changing as nature itself. In this collaboration, I hope we can soften pre-existing notions of tradition and borders.\n\nI’m thrilled to be part of Suneil Sanzgiri’s exhibition “Here the Earth Grows Gold” opening at Brooklyn Museum from October 27-May 5. Booker Stardrum and I scored his latest film Two Refusals which will will be premiered as part of this solo exhibition, which examines “the complexities of anti-colonialism, nationalism, and diasporic identity”. This collaboration with Suneil is near and dear to me, after working with him now on four films!\n\nDecolonization is not theoretical and theory means nothing without practice. There can be no peace without justice. No peace without the dismantling of apartheid, genocide and colonialism.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nAmirtha\n\nUpcoming Events…\n\n10/14 - Ragas Live Festival with Rafiq Bhatia and Qasim Naqvi at Pioneer Works (10-10:45pm set)\n\n10/24 - Duo with Luke Stewart at Bennington College, Carriage Barn 8pm\n\n10/27-5/5 - Exhibition of Suneil Sanzigiri's Films featuring music by Amirtha Kidambi and Booker Stardrum at Brooklyn Museum\n\n11/16 - Neti-Neti, Fire Museum Presents, Philadelphia\n\n12/2 - ellen o \"Sparrows and Doves\" Vinyl Re-Release and Tribute Concert at Public Records\n\n12/9 - Angels & Demons (Kidambi/Darius Jones) at The Kitchen\n\nHi friends\n\nI truly cannot believe it is already Fall. As Seal once sang on the Space Jam soundtrack “time keeps on slipping, into the future”.\n\nI want to invite you to a very special show this week on Friday September 1st with my band Elder Ones at Public Records. It is the first time we're playing in NYC in two years, after working on a bunch of new music with a very exciting line-up in preparation for our third album out in Spring 2024! Yes, I am still railing against the white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchy, but I promise it will be a good time.\n\nThe new line-up includes Lester St. Louis on bass, Jason Nazary on drums, Matt Nelson on soprano saxophone and Alfredo Colon on tenor saxophone, with an array of electronics. The bill is a really good one, with the excellent musicians of Darlin', the group of Wendy Eisenberg, Ryan Sawyer and Lester on cello!\n\nWe’re also super thrilled to have joined the No Earplugs fam for our European booking. Malwina is super passionate and dedicated, the next generation of fan turned industry, who we met through her super fan parents in Poland!\n\nI've also got some nice gigs coming up including a CECIL TAYLOR OPERA, a benefit for The Freedom Theater, an arts organization for refugees in Jenin, occupied Palestine, and later in the fall a new trio project with Qasim Naqvi and Rafiq Bhatia for the Ragas Live Festival at Pioneer Works, a mini-tour with Neti-Neti my duo with Matt Evans, and more!\n\nIn addition to gigs I'm excited to return to teach at Brooklyn College next week and later in the season, as a first-time visiting professor at Bennington College!\n\nThanks for reading if you got this far :)\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nAmirtha\n\nDETAILS + TICKETS\n\nFriday September 1st @ Public Records, 8pm: Elder Ones & Darlin'\n\nDarlin’ (Wendy Eisenberg, Ryan Sawyer, Lester St. Louis) and Elder Ones (Matt Nelson, Alfredo Colon, Lester St. Louis and Jason Nazary).

More than 200 Palestinians, many of them children, have been killed in 2023.\n\nThursday September 28th @ CUNY Grad Center, 6:30pm\n\nA Rat's Mass an opera by Cecil Taylor is an operatic re-staging of Adrienne Kennedy’s one-act play, premiered at La Mama Experimental Theater club in 1976.\n\nMonday October 2nd + Tuesday October 3rd @ DC + Philly\n\nNeti-Neti (me + Matt Evans) mini tour in DC + Philly, details TBA!\n\nSaturday October 14th @ Pioneer Works\n\nA new Trio with Qasim Naqvi and Rafiq Bhatia for the 24-hour Ragas Live Festival\n\nTuesday October 24th @ Bennington College\n\nDuo with bassist Luke Stewart\n\nHey friends & fam,\n\nJust a quick note to say I’m about to embark on an epic tour with a bunch of very exciting projects. It’ll be a long, mostly Canadian summer.\n\nI’m truly “honored and humbled” to play three shows in Vermont, with William Parker’s Sutras Ensemble featuring Hamid Drake, Kyoko Kitamura, Morley Shanti-Kamen, Lisa Sokolov and Andrea Wolper. William is a one-of-a-kind, once-in-a-generation (if you’re lucky) musician and human being, and it is always life changing to make music with him.\n\nFrom Vermont I’ll head up to our northerly neighbors for two shows in Canada with Matt Evans in a new duo called Neti-Neti at the Suoni per il Popolo festival in Montreal and Tone Festival in Toronto. After that, bouncing around the region with Mary Halvorson’s Code Girl at Ottawa Jazz Festival and Toronto, then onto Vancouver for a residency at Western Front in a duo with Darius Jones called Angels & Demons. While in Vancouver, I’ll play and do some workshops with the Coastal Jazz Festival, with our old collaborator Julia Ulehla. In July, Darius and I will head to my home state of California, to spread Sun Ra’s message across the Golden State.\n\nPlease note the Berkeley show is SOLD OUT!\n\nSee you out there!\n\nGo Dubs,\n\nAmirtha\n\nHi dearest music community, fans, friends, family and comrades,\n\nNeedless to say, it has been a difficult adjustment for musicians and performing artists in the time of Corona. Personally, I haven’t felt much of the online live-stream exhibition impulse. Perhaps that will change, but for now I’m focused on turning inward, practicing, researching, studying and absorbing. Moving slowly, deliberately and with intention. I’ve been learning to play alto sax, which has been a joy in a rather dark period, and have gone back to studying Carnatic music regularly with my teacher in India online. I’ve been deeply enjoying reading, watching films on the Criterion Channel, and deep listening to records, sitting down and taking notes, watching interviews of my favorite artists, and just generally reflecting. Cooking game has definitely been on point, and grateful to be able to buy food and eat it, realizing it is such a privilege.\n\nThis Friday May 1 (May Day), Bandcamp is again waiving their fees, which means 100% of what you spend goes directly to musicians. They actually care about independent musicians! They will do this again on June 5 and July 3, midnight-midnight Pacific time. Recorded music is so dope! Hear it how we meant for you to hear it, without the sad audio quality of live-streaming or the corporate intervention of Facebook, Instagram or Twitch (owned by Amazon). I would be so grateful if you purchased any of my recent releases, including Elder Ones’ From Untruth (Northern Spy, 2019) and Amirtha Kidambi & Lea Bertucci Duo Phase Eclipse (Astral Spirits, 2019). Since it is hard and expensive to ship from the post-office right now, I suggest going via Bandcamp instead. For the recent re-issue of Elder Ones Holy Science (Jazzman UK, 2016) on vinyl, please buy from my favorite record store on earth, Amoeba, or your local record store online.\n\nhttps://amirthakidambi.bandcamp.com/album/from-untruth https://amirthakidambi.bandcamp.com/album/holy-science\n\nhttps://kidambibertucci.bandcamp.com/album/phase-eclipse\n\nhttps://www.amoeba.com/holy-science-lp-amirtha-kidambi/albums/4214209/\n\nI’ve also just posted some incredible live videos of Elder Ones playing at Jazz Cerkno in Slovenia last year. I hope you enjoy them! I think it was one of our most burning sets. It truly reminds me of the power of live music and the very important social and communal aspects of music making. The eternally long and grueling travel day, the audience reaction, the hang after with musicians and fans…You can see them on my website or my Vimeo channel here: https://vimeo.com/user43136777\n\nWhile I am safe and secure for the time being, my heart is with those who are on the front lines. Our health care workers, but also those who work for the city, sanitation, transit, infrastructure, domestic workers, in-home nursing, delivery, grocery, pharmacy, postal service, and of course those working in warehouses, factories and fulfillment centers. This May Day, a symbolic day acknowledging workers and their struggle, and we must stand in solidarity with those who are risking their lives, while corporations see sky-high profits without sharing them with those who make it possible. Please do not cross the picket lines this May Day, as workers strike around the world, at corporations including Amazon, Whole Foods, Instacart, Target, Walmart and others. Also, if you are able to stand in solidarity with those in your building, a rent strike is planned here in New York, as we have not seen any relief for renters, since this crisis started. https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7j8zw/amazon-whole-foods-instacart-workers-organize-a-historic-mass-strike\n\nThanks for your continued support. I truly hope we will all be stronger in the ashes of this disaster. It is time to rise up, support one another, through radical love.\n\nALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE.\n\nxoxo,\n\nAmirtha\n\nI'm excited to embark upon tour in the US and EU with Mary Halvorson's Code Girl, my duo with Lea Bertucci and Elder Ones, but first, some NYC shows! Tomorrow Friday 2.21, Lea and I will perform duo in our last NYC show for a while and I will also play duo with Matteo Liberatore at Microscope Gallery. Matteo and I have been experimenting with some long, slow, glacial textures, which I'm looking forward to exploring! Lea and I recently released a tape on Astral Spirits, which you can grab here! Next week on 2.26, I'll play duo with Luke Stewart, opening for my fellow Elder One Nick Dunston's Atlantic Extractions and then 2.28 with Elder Ones at Hunter College for the New Topologies series.

Come celebrate with us if you are in one of these cities!\n\nOctober 2nd- 15th\n\nMary Halvorson’s Code Girl: European Tour\n\nMary Halvorson (guitar), Amirtha Kidambi (voice), María Grand (tenor saxophone & voice), Adam O’Farrill (trumpet), Michael Formanek (bass) & Tomas Fujiwara (drums)\n\nWednesday, October 2nd @ Le Petit Faucheux (Tours, France)\n\nFriday, October 4th @ Sunset Club (Paris, France)\n\nSaturday, October 5th @ CBSO Centre (Birmingham, UK)\n\nWednesday, October 9th @ Jazzclub Fasching (Stockholm, Sweden)\n\nThursday, October 10th @ Teatro Victoria Eugenia Antzokia (San Sebastian, Spain)\n\nFriday, October 11th @ Stadtgarten (Cologne, Germany)\n\nSaturday, October 12th @ Jazz Club Ferrara (Ferrara, Italy)\n\nMonday, October 14th @ Braga, Portugal\n\nTuesday, October 15th @ Elb Philarmonie (Hamburg, Germany)\n\nMary Halvorson’s Code Girl\n\nAmirtha Kidambi - vocals\n\nMaría Grand - saxophone, vocals\n\nAdam O’Farrill - trumpet\n\nMary Halvorson - guitar\n\nMichael Formanek - bass\n\nTomas Fujiwara - drums\n\nCode Girl is the latest project of guitarist and composer Mary Halvorson, and her first project for which she has composed both lyrics and music. The band has been described as “...a bold experiment in song form” by The New York Times. Deftly interpreted by Amirtha Kidambi (vocals), María Grand (saxophone, vocals), Adam O’Farrill (trumpet), Michael Formanek (bass) and Tomas Fujiwara (drums), the music synthesizes influences of jazz, folk and improvisation to create an original take on songwriting. Code Girl’s debut album was a top ten record in the annual NPR Jazz Critic’s Poll of 2018.\n\nHalvorson's music has always had the capacity to surprise, but Code Girl amounts to the most startling move in her solo career.”\n\n-Nate Chinen, NPR\n\n“With strong compositions delivered by an excellent ensemble, the album's puzzles remain a treat to continually almost crack.”\n\n-Justin Cober-Lake, PopMatters\n\n“(Code Girl) is an album that touches upon various musical traditions in oblique fashion, but it’s most recognizable as yet another major step in Halvorson’s meteoric ascent.”\n\n-Peter Margasak, bandcamp daily\n\nAfter returning from a great Spring tour in Europe with Elder Ones, I’m back in NYC, practicing, writing and seeing a lot of music. The summer here is an unbelievably saturated and fertile time for being a listener, so I’m trying to take things in after A LOT of putting things out in the Spring.\n\nIn July, I’ll be in my home state of California for a West Coast tour, starting at SF Jazz on July 20 and 21 with Mary Halvorson’s Code Girl. I’ll also be teaching at Stanford Jazz Workshop and then starting an Elder Ones tour with dates in Santa Cruz, San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles and Tijuana, Mexico!\n\nLast but certainly not least…I recently wrote a letter to the editor for The Wire magazine, in response to their review of Elder One’s From Untruth. While the review was positive, the content was factually incorrect, grouping me ethnically with the Brooklyn Raga Massive association, which I am not affiliated with. You can read the original review here and the letter above. I’m grateful to not only do the fact check, but also explain why this type of conflation and mischaracterization is so damaging and exhausting for POC, women and other underrepresented groups.\n\nHappy Summer! <3"
