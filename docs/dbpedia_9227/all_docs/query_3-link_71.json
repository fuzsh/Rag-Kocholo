        "text": "Darius Jones presents the World Premiere of a new compositional work entitled “Samesoul Maker,” the companion piece to his 2014 composition “The Oversoul Manual.” While “Oversoul” took us into the alien birthing ritual of the mothers of a planet called Or’gen, ‘Samesoul Maker’ shows us the daily meditation that is performed by the fathers and community while the mothers are away from home. This alien meditation creates a world of sound, syntax, and speech patterns that are different from ours, expressing the hope and truth that real communication lies beyond the realm of words and the familiar. The “Samesoul Maker” instrumentation is for two female identifying voices and two male identifying voices, bells, and vibraphone. This work will be performed by Jones’ quintet with a community of vocalists and musicians gathered to represent the alien family. “Samesoul Maker” takes us further into Jones’ mythological world of alien birthing rituals to reveal how this family bonds together to create the savior of their universe.\n\nDarius Jones alto saxophone\n\nGelsey Bell voice and bell\n\nAviva Mitchell voice and bell\n\nSunder Ganglani voice and bell\n\nPaul Pinto voice and bell\n\nLevy Lorenzo vibraphone\n\nDarius Jones has created a recognizable voice as a critically acclaimed alto saxophonist and composer by embracing individuality and innovation in the tradition of Black music. Jones has been awarded the Van Lier Fellowship, Jerome Foundation Artist-in-Residence and commission, Western Front residence and commission, French-American Jazz Exchange Award, Robert D. Bielecki Foundation Award, and a Fromm Music Foundation commission from Harvard University. Jones has received acclaim for not only his studio albums featuring music and images evocative of Black Futurism, but also for his commissioned work as a composer throughout the United States and Canada. In 2021, Jones released Raw Demoon Alchemy (A Lone Operation) on Northern Spy Records. Jones was the 2022 MATA Festival artist in residence and festival curator, where he premiered Colored School No. 3 (Extra Credit). Forthcoming in Fall 2023, Jones’ new album fLuXkit Vancouver (i̶t̶s̶ suite but sacred) will be released by Northern Spy Records and We Jazz Records. Jones’ music is a confrontation against apathy and ego, hoping to inspire authenticity that compels us to be better humans.\n\nGelsey Bell is a Brooklyn-based singer, songwriter, and scholar.
