        "text": "[AUM091] - CD in deluxe digipak with 12 pg. libretto\n\nDarius Jones: composer, arranger, producer\n\nPerformed by The Elizabeth-Caroline Unit\n\n: Amirtha Kidambi •a°Δ°• : voice\n\n: Sarah Martin °•aΔ•° : voice\n\n: Jean Carla Rodea °°aΔ•æ• : voice\n\n: Kristin Slipp ••Δ°° : voice\n\n\"One of the most ambitious albums made in the past decade and certainly the most aspirational in alto saxophonist Darius Jones’ already-impressive catalogue of recordings. And more impressive still, Jones doesn’t play a note on the release yet his musicality—a mix of concept, aesthetic, personality and investigation—is as evident as if it were a solo session. The four vocalists featured as The Elizabeth-Caroline Unit are both instruments and living interpreters of Jones’ complex, simultaneously futuristic and primal work.\" –The New York City Jazz Record\n\n\"Uncannily beautiful and riveting.\" –PopMatters\n\n\"Emotionally and stylistically intrepid\" –The New York Times\n\n\"Esoteric and enchanting. A mystic, ritual piece meant to reflect a sacred alien birthing ritual. It succeeds.\" –Time Out New York\n\n\"Absolutely striking. Downright masterful\" –Culture Catch\n\n\"Deeply affecting on both an emotional and a physical level, and easily one of the most surprising albums of the year\" –The Wire\n\n\"The Oversoul Manual is a contoured, formidable, signature work.\" –JazzTimes\n\n\"The birth of the Man’ish Boy is truly the birth of the love of music.\" –I Care If You Listen\n\nThe Oversoul Manual is/was the long-awaited fourth installment / revelation in Darius Jones’ central, highly acclaimed, and on-going Man’ish Boy epic. It further reveals – indeed fully features – the great talents of Jones as composer & arranger, with originality, conceptual richness and deep emotive power to the fore. An a cappella work comprised of 15 pieces performed by his vocal quartet, The Elizabeth-Caroline Unit (featuring the great talents of devoted members Amirtha Kidambi, Sarah Martin, Jean-Carla Rodea, and Kristin Slipp), it utilizes a heretofore unheard (by Earthlings) sacred language of sound / composition used in the alien birthing ritual of a new being.\n\nThe Oversoul Manual is both an elemental / genesis part of Jones’ Mani’sh Boy mythology and a fully illuminated / radical expression of his profound love for the human voice, which remains at the foundation of Darius’ singularly potent creative life. The voice was his first instrument; it was his gateway into music. He grew up singing hymns and duets with his sister as a young boy, later becoming gospel choir director at his church in Virginia as a young man. Darius’ intent with this work was to manifest an experience of great purity, communicative potency, and cleansing joy. And once again, he has succeeded magnificently.\n\n1. o o o o o - 02:15\n\n2. o o o o - 01:50\n\n3. o o o - 01:29\n\n4. o o - 01:42\n\n5. • - 02:48\n\n6. •• - 06:29\n\n7. ••• - 02:24\n\n8. •••• - 01:19\n\n9. ••••• - 03:15\n\n10.
