        "text": "Darius Jones, truly a gift from God, was born on May 18, 1994 and his love for basketball began at the young age of 6 when he attended a basketball game at De La Salle High School in Concord. From that moment on, Darius let it be known to his mother, Beverly Monique Bradley, what his future plans and goals were to be. Darius boldly stated, with conviction to his mother, that I am going to attend and play basketball at De La Salle High School, I am going to college and I will obtain my Law Degree. From that point on, Darius’ vision was made into reality, he excelled accordingly academically, socially and athletically. He was slated, identified and gifted to do great things.\n\nOn October 11, 2009, we lost Darius to Sudden Cardiac Arrest. The death of Darius almost broke his mother, Beverly Monique Bradley. Just knowing that his physical presence would no longer be here on earth was over whelming. With that being said, God created a new plan for Darius’ life which is to spread the love, grace and compassion that Darius had to save the lives of others. This formed and defined the vision and mission of the Darius Jones Foundation and Darius’ legacy.\n\nTo be given a gift, Darius, that’s greater than yourself, knowing that the gift has a better purpose than yourself comes truly from God."
