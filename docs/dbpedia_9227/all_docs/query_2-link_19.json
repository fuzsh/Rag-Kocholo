        "text": "Announcing MATA’s 2021-22 Artist-in-Residence:\n\nDarius Jones\n\nMATA names composer and saxophonist Darius Jones as its first-ever Artist-In-Residence for the 2021-22 season. Through awe-inspiring performances and genre-defying collaborations dedicated to justice, Jones is one of the most innovative change-makers of our time.\n\n“I desire to inspire creative fearlessness amongst musical artists,\" Jones says. \"As a community, we have the power to embrace a courageous spirit that transcends limited imagination. I hope to nurture this perspective during my time with MATA.”\n\nJones will shape the artistic vision of MATA's 2021-22 season, curate and headline the 2022 MATA Festival, and explore new creative collaborations as MATA continues its mission to support the future voices of new music.\n\nMATA Executive Director Amanda Gookin says, \"Darius is one of the most inspiring artists with whom I've had the privilege of working. I look forward to exploring the boundless possibilities of sound expression with him as MATA continues to support new ideas and new voices in music.\"\n\nHailed by The New York Times as \"The most visceral and distinctive alto saxophonist of this era,\" Jones will no doubt bring a powerful new voice to MATA.\n\nAbout Darius\n\nDarius Jones has created a recognizable voice as a critically acclaimed saxophonist and composer by embracing individuality and innovation in the tradition of African-American music. Jones has been awarded the Van Lier Fellowship, Jerome Foundation Commission, Jerome Artist-in-Residence at Roulette, French-American JazzExchange Award, and, in 2019, the Fromm Music Foundation commission at Harvard University. Jones has released a string of diverse recordings featuring music and images evocative of Black Futurism. His work as a new music composer for voice culminated in a major debut performance at Carnegie Hall in 2014. Jones has collaborated with artists including Gerald Cleaver, Oliver Lake, William Parker, Andrew Cyrille, Craig Taborn, Wet Ink Ensemble, JasonMoran, Trevor Dunn, Dave Burrell, Eric Revis, Matthew Shipp, Marshall Allen, Nasheet Waits, James Carter, TravisLaplante, Fay Victor, Cooper-Moore, Matana Roberts, Dezron Douglas, Gelsey Bell, Nicole Mitchell, Georgia Ann Muldrow,and many more. In 2020, Darius premiered a major new multimedia composition entitled We Can Change The Country, a dramatic commentary on social justice and American politics. Jones’ new album, Raw Demoon Alchemy (A Lone Operation), will be released on Northern Spy Records in Fall 2021. Darius’ music is aconfrontation against apathy and ego, hoping to inspire authenticity that compels us to be better humans."
