        "text": "GRANTEES\n\n[French-American Jazz Exchange]\n\n2018 / 2019\n\nArturo O’Farrill\n\nMalika Zarra\n\nMiddle Eastern Roots of Afro Latin Jazz is a musical exploration of the Arabic and North African roots of Afro Latin Jazz and Afro Cuban music. The project is led by pianist, composer and band leader Arturo O’Farrill (founder and Artistic Director of the Afro Latin Jazz Alliance) in collaboration with French Moroccan vocalist and composer, Malika Zarra and will trace the Afro-American and Afro-Caribbean roots of what has come to be known as “jazz”.\n\nClaudia Solal\n\nKatherine Young\n\nThe project, Antichamber Music, will employ the creative process of improvisation to musically reinterpret Chamber Music, collection of poems by the influential Irish poet and writer, James Joyce. Antichamber Music is a collaboration between French-vocalist, Claudia Solal and American musician, Katherine Young who pairs her classical mastery of the bassoon with the use of electronics to manipulate and magnify the unique sound of the instrument.\n\nEtienne Charles\n\nVincent Segal\n\nUS-based jazz trumpeter Etienne Charles and French cellist, Vincent Segal will bring together an eclectic group of musicians for this unique project to tell the story of the migrations between the Caribbean and South America and the resulting musical influences.\n\nIsabelle Olivier\n\nRez Abbasi\n\nThis project, In Between #2, is a collaboration between French harpist, Isabelle Olivier and Rez Abbasi, an award-winning American guitarist and composer originally born in Pakistan. The paring of harp and guitar will provide unique compositional and improvisational opportunities in melody, harmony, rhythm, and sound.\n\nSylvain Rifflet\n\nJon Irabagon\n\nFrench saxophonist and clarinetist, Sylvain Rifflet and New York-based saxophonist, Jon Irabagon will continue their collaboration through a new project inspired by France and the United States’ shared value for civil rights and activism. Based on this common foundation, Rebellion(s) will explore the everlasting link between music and politics. Rifflet and Irabagon will research and examine songs within their musical cultures that have inspired revolution or have been written during or about protests.\n\nLaika Fatien Thomas\n\nBrian Blade\n\nFrench vocalist, Laika Fatien Thomas seeks to explore the theme of “resilience” through an experimental songwriting and performance process with American drummer, Brian Blade and ensemble members Christopher Thomas and Geoffrey More. The project will take a creative approach and incorporate unqiue combinations of instrumentation, and song structures not normally found within jazz.\n\n2016 / 2017\n\nAntoine Berjeaut\n\nMakaya McCraven\n\nTrumpet-player Antoine Berjeaut will work with “beat scientist” Makaya McCraven and three other musicians from Paris and Chicago to bridge the modern jazz, post-rock, and hip hop scenes. They will compose, collectively improvise, perform, and record live and in the studio in both cities. The material developed from this unique collaboration will then be used as a resource to be decontextualized and remixed into a creative mashup, or sonic collage, using modern post production techniques. The final product will be tracks that stand alone as complete works but that also lend themselves to further collaborations for poetry, rap, and additional remixes.\n\nFOX\n\nChris Cheek\n\nFrench trio FOX will work with saxophonist Chris Cheek to develop a musical investigation about French roots in Louisiana and mixing African-American grooves and rhythms with French influences. The instrumentation features accordion and banjo along with guitar, bass, drum and saxophone.\n\nGaël Horellou\n\nAri Hoenig\n\nSaxophonist Gaël Horellou and drummer Ari Hoening make up the duo Nasty Factorz, a group with little name recognition in France.This FAJE project will allow the duo to work in residency in Paris while composing and releasing a new album on the DTC Records label. The duo will also perform several concerts in France.\n\nKarim Maurice\n\nWilliam Galison\n\nThis project will result in a repertoire of music composed by pianist Karim Maurice and harmonicist William Galison. The work will include music for a chromatic harmonica accompanied by a jazz quartet and a classical string orchestra with harp. A jazz quartet and 17 string instruments will be highlighted by the nostalgic rushes of the melody played by harmonica, one of the most traditional instruments in the United States.\n\nKeith Witty\n\nChristophe Panzani\n\nBassist Keith Witty and saxophonist Christophe Panzani are undertaking a continuation of prior musical endeavors with the ensemble THIEFS, incorporating two new musicians and three vocalists. The body of work, entitled Up-Rooted/Re-Rooted, explores the migratory element of the human experience in both a broad, abstract sense and in a way that is quite literal, pertaining to the immigrant struggle and notions of belonging.\n\nYohan Giaume\n\nEvan Christopher\n\nTrumpeter Yohan Giaume and clarinetist Evan Christopher will collaborate on a recording inspired by the musical universe of Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Gottschalk played a key role in the development of American music and significantly influenced the art music of his day by integrating ethnic elements especially African-American and Caribbean traditions. Building upon Gottschalk’s interest in subjects of death, love, and the celebration of life, the work will utilize many of the same imprints that inspired Gottschalk such as Afro-Creole folk melodies, syncopated rhythms from the Americas and Caribbean, folk songs from New Orleans & France, works by Chopin & Berlioz and even poetry.\n\n2015 / 2016\n\nYacine Boulares\n\nVincent Segal\n\nFrench-Tunisian saxophonist Yacine Boulares and French cellist Vincent Segal will compose and record original music, for their new trio with American drummer Nasheet Waits, re-appropriating the forgotten Stambeli repertoire. Stambeli is a healing trance music created by the descendants of Sub-Saharan slaves brought to Tunisia. Boulares and Segal’s original compositions will form a series of variations on the legend of the hunter Abu Sadiya. In his wandering search for his enslaved daughter, Abu Sadiya danced and sang his sorrow in the streets of Tunis thus becoming the first musician of Stambeli and personifying the memory of Sub-Saharan slaves in Tunisia.\n\nyacineboulares.com\n\nfacebook.com/VincentSegal.officiel\n\nAaron Goldberg\n\nLeon Parker\n\nPianist Aaron Goldberg and percussionist Leon Parker expand the sonic, communicative, and expressive possibilities of the piano trio setting, emphasizing a primary role for Body Percussion and Body Rhythm techniques-both in place of and in addition to the traditional drum set.

Inspired by the techniques employed in Ravel’s Le tombeau de Couperin-itself an homage to the tradition of the French Baroque keyboard suite-Keberle and Woeste’s exploration, accompanied by cellist Vincent Courtois and drummer Jeff Ballard, will result in the composition, performance, and recording of original jazz works.\n\nryankeberle.com\n\nfrankwoeste.com\n\nDavid Krakauer\n\nAnakronic Electro Orkestra\n\nThe collaboration between David Krakauer and the Anakronic Electro Orkestra aims to further the development of contemporary jazz by bringing together unexpected musical influences and genres into an accessible improvisational context.

Recording sessions, a new album, and extensive touring are planned.\n\ndavidkrakauer.com\n\nanakronic.com\n\nSamuel Strouk\n\nMariam Adam\n\n“Dialogue of Languages” explores the common territories between jazz, classical, and contemporary musics. The simultaneous development of jazz in the US and ‘classical’ music in France and Europe in the first decades of the 20th century inspires French guitarist Samuel Strouk and American clarinetist Mariam Adam to create a suite of miniatures for a sextet setting. Their compositional concept co-habits the modal, tonal, and atonal musical languages and rhythmic conceptions inherited from the interactions of these art forms.\n\nsamuel-strouk.com\n\n2014 /2015\n\nFrank Woeste\n\nDave Douglas\n\nFrench pianist Frank Woeste will collaborate with American trumpeter Dave Douglas to create a new repertoire for a jazz quartet comprised of trumpet, bass, piano, and drums based on the work of Man Ray, the influential American modern artist who was a significant contributor to the Dada and Surrealist movements of the 20th Century.
