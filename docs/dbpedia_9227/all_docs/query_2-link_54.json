        "text": "A staple of Austria’s vibrant jazz scene, Graz-born experimental vocalist and visual artist, Katja Cruz has also made a name for herself on international turf. Hailed by The New York City Jazz Record for her “mercury-fast unbound range [that] resounds like echoes in mystical canyons”, Cruz was awarded “Best Vocal Release 2012” for “Lightning And Thunder – Improvisations About The Elements” (Einklang Records 051), her first musical collaboration with her husband Howard Curtis. Her most recent record, “Hexaphone – The Cosmology of Improvised Music” (Rudi Records, 2014), features also exceptional US alto saxophonist Oliver Lake.\n\nHoward Curtis (born in Williamsburg, VA) is an Austrian-based jazz drummer, percussionist and university professor, teaching at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Graz. His free improv with Cruz is anything but academic, however: their sensitive and sympathetic exchanges range from Sturm und Drang histrionics to oases of stillness and serenity. He has toured Europe five times and performed at renowned venues in the US such as The Jazz Standard and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.’s Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and Los Angeles’ Getty Museum.\n\nDarius Jones is an extraordinarily gifted American alto saxophonist and composer. He joined the New York music community in 2005, after living and studying in Richmond, VA. Jones’ diverse musical background lead to his unique and soulful approach to music and his repertoire includes compositions and performances in electroacoustic music, chamber ensembles, contemporary and avant-garde jazz groups, modern dance performances, and multi-media events.\n\nFor more information visit:\n\nhttp://ibeambrooklyn.com\n\nhttp://www.dariusjonesmusic.com\n\nVENUE\n\nIBEAM BROOKLYN\n\n168 7th Street, Brooklyn, NY 11215\n\nTime\n\n8:30 pm\n\nCategory\n\nMusic\n\nShare this event"
