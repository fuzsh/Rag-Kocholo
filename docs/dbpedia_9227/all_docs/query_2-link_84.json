It’s one of the reasons why I like chansons.\n\n“Sometimes I might understand some words but I don’t understand everything that they’re saying. But I feel it,” says Jones.\n\nFor her part, Lesbros was conscious of the challenge before her — communicating musically, if not linguistically, with non-francophones. “As a French person I had to place the words, singing, and the sounds, to make them all understandable even if you don’t speak French.”\n\nJones and his quartet made their album Le bébé de Brigitte (Lost in Translation) with Lesbros in 2015, but it’s only this month that the project is being performed in Canada during a short tour. Jones’s group with Lesbros plays the National Arts Centre’s Fourth Stage on Tuesday, presented by the TD Ottawa Jazz Festival.\n\nThe album’s title refers to a key inspiration for Jones’s project. A music lover of wide-ranging tastes, Jones has a penchant for the experimental French vocalist Brigitte Fontaine, and even more specifically, her 1969 album Comme à la radio, which was her unique collaboration with the seminal jazz avant-garde group the Art Ensemble of Chicago.\n\nJones, who is 40, took that heady album’s example as a point of departure for his work with Lesbro, although its subtitle, Lost in Translation, suggests that a meeting of cultures between American musicians and a French singer is necessarily imperfect.\n\nIndeed, more than an example of cross-cultural collaboration, Jones’s project explicitly addresses the subject of cultures coming together, he says.\n\n“You’re dealing with a lot of different universes,” Jones says. “Language, it’s like the immediate thing when we’re dealing with one another — ‘This person speaks another language, they’re different.’ But the reality is, how different are we?\n\n“If I’m looking at you and you’re looking at me, and you don’t speak my language, how do we connect? How do we become one?” Jones says.\n\nLesbros says that every project needs to find its “equilibrium,” but that quest is more complex when people from different cultures are involved. “Here is the challenge,” she says. “We found a great equilibrium between efficiency, commitment, poetry and sensitivity.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nJones adds that jazz is intrinsically a polyglot project in which people, cultures and influences are thrown into a bustling mix.\n\n“You have these slaves, or black people, or however you want to position them in society, creating music that is influenced by many different things. The music isn’t simply informed by America, whatever that is. It’s informed by, ‘Oh, I had this experience. I played a little classical music. I’m actually Cuban or I’m Haitian, or I’m interested in this type of thing.’\n\n“When you listen to jazz music, you actually hear a lot of those worlds coming together, colliding together a lot. I feel like that’s the beautiful aspect of it. When it’s being played from the truest place, that’s what you’re getting. Everything’s coming at you, the kitchen sink.”\n\nJones says that Lesbros, who like him is based in New York, functions not just as a singer but as an instrument in his project.\n\n“When I think about the voice within my own music, I very much think about all the things that it can do, all that it can add, from being background, foreground, just tapestry. Emilie’s doing all of that. She’s acting as a horn, she’s acting like ambient noise, she’s telling a story sometimes. It’s all over the map.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMeanwhile, Jones, who has an arrestingly visceral and ripe sound on his saxophone, says that singing is at the core of his playing.\n\n“My whole horn concept is coming from that world,” Jones says. “I think about the voice when I play, I incorporate the vocal process within my instrumental process.”\n\nThe last time that Jones performed with Lesbros was in 2016, before American politics and society were thrown into tumult. If anything, this music with its cross-cultural underpinnings resonates more strongly in 2018, Jones says.\n\n“What me and Emilie were trying to say is still relevant right now. And probably more so,” he says.\n\n“It probably makes more sense if I played a f—ed-up version of America at some point during the performance, because that’s essentially what’s happening right now. America is falling and everyone knows it. They’re literally watching this thing fall,” Jones says with a laugh.\n\n“No matter how much Trump and his supporters bluster and say we’re doing amazing, everything’s amazing, it’s not amazing. It’s really sad, actually. It’s really horrible. You have the opportunity to change but you don’t want to.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nJones is fine with listeners hearing his music through a sociological filter, and being affected accordingly. “A lot of things in my music have a sociological aspect,” he says. “A lot of times my intention is to awaken, or more specifically to inform, empower and inspire.”\n\nJones, who will soon play in Ottawa, Montreal, Guelph and Vancouver, is keen to see how his project is received in Canada.\n\nHe notes that at previous American shows, Lesbros was perceived as the foreigner, while in France, he and his fellow U.S. musicians were the foreigners. Bilingual Canada, he says, could be “the perfect middle ground for this particular project, for some reason.”\n\nDarius Jones\n\nLe bébé de Brigitte (Lost in Translation)\n\nWhen: Tuesday, Sept. 18, 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: NAC Fourth Stage\n\nTickets: $30 at ottawajazzfestival.com\n\nphum@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/peterhum\n\nottawacitizen.com/jazzblog\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
