        "text": "There are a couple major ways an alto saxophonist can handle the instrument. You can clench and bridle, in the manner of an avant-gardist like Oliver Lake, using the horn to signify something like refusal. Or you can tease the listener, dilate your sound, give it the vibrato of a body overcome. That’s what Johnny Hodges did in Duke Ellington’s orchestra.\n\nIf you’re Darius Jones, the most visceral and distinctive alto saxophonist of this era, you go for both. This week at the Stone in Manhattan, Mr. Jones will be convening some new collaborators from pockets of the New York jazz world. He’ll start on Tuesday, Sept. 26, in a duo with the young drummer Kush Abadey, adding an instrument each night through Sunday, Oct. 1, when he’ll lead a septet. All of the shows start at 8:30 p.m., and most will feature material from a fresh body of work he’s calling “Cartilage.”"
