        "text": "Yoon Sun Choi - voice/piano\n\nAngela Morris - Alto Saxophone\n\nAnne Rhodes - voice/electronics\n\nRaina Sokolov-Gonzalez - voice/piano\n\n$20\n\nYoon Sun Choi, born in South Korea, raised in Canada and now a New York-based improvising vocalist and pianist using her vocal prowess that transitions effortlessly from resonant, haunting melodies to deep, resonant wails. Yoon has made significant contributions to the music scene over her twenty-year-long career performing and collaborating with esteemed artists including Mark Dresser, Darius Jones, Jacob Sacks, and Kenny Wheeler, on prestigious stages such as The Blue Note, Birdland, and Carnegie Hall.\n\nAngela Morris thrives in the loop between avant-jazz, new music, and pop. As composer and multi-instrumentalist, (known mostly as saxophonist, she grew up playing violin) she has performed throughout North America and Europe everywhere from basements to arenas.\n\nAnne Rhodes is an experimental vocalist and improvisor based in New Haven, CT. She is considered one of the foremost interpreters of the vocal music of Anthony Braxton. Her current projects include her solo noise project Red Rainbow, and for her embroidered graphic compositions.\n\nRaina Sokolov-Gonzalez (she/her) is a singer/composer based in Brooklyn, New York. Born into a family of musicians, music was Raina’s first language and it runs deep within her veins. Rooted in Jazz and R&B, Raina’s cross-genre style is built from the bottom up. With improvisation as a starting point for her songs, Raina draws on her emotionality and leans into her perception of the world around, uncovering hidden depths within daily life and articulating personal truth with vulnerability and bravery. Her most recent single, “The Healing” is available on all streaming platforms."
