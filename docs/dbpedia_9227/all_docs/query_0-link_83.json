The piece will be performed by Matt Carlson (piano), Loren Chasse (percussion), Brandon Conway (guitar), Matt Hannafin (percussion), Maxx Katz (flute), and Caspar Sonnet (dobro) + metronomes.\n\n> Sarah Hughes, Fires and Conifers (2012–13): A text score in which each performer is given very specific instructions regarding the role they are to play in the music, but few instructions regarding the sounds they are to play. It will be interpreted by Loren Chasse (disruptions), Matt Hannafin (percussion), Branic Howard (surfaces), Maxx Katz (flute), Lorna Krier (piano), and Caspar Sonnet (dobro).\n\n> Matthias Kaul, After the Rain (2015): A complex piece mixing written and improvised passages, “After the Rain” is, in part, a completely abstracted take on the ambience of the blues. It will be performed by Brandon Conway (Soundlazer, samples), Matt Hannafin (percussion), Branic Howard (guitar), Maxx Katz (flute), and Caspar Sonnet (voice).\n\n> Luke Nickel, White Fang Field Recording (2015): How do six people interpret the same text, when asked to read silently, speaking only when coming upon words and phrases they interpret as “sonic”? The piece will be performed by Matthew Neil Andrews, Brandon Conway, Annie Gilbert, Matt Hannafin, Juniana Lanning, Stephanie Lavon Trotter (voices).\n\n> Daniel James Wolf, Field & Stream (2011): Five electronics players are asked to assemble libraries of sound based on five different types of water: rivers, oceans, rain, drainage, and drippage. In performance, signals from the players’ computers are routed to each other, where they are processed to create a variety of variations. It will be performed by Francisco Botello, Branic Howard, Lorna Krier, Juniana Lanning, Glenn Sogge (computers + field recordings).\n\nSaturday, October 19\n\nLeaven Community\n\n5431 NE 20th Ave @ Killingsworth, PDX\n\nDoors 7pm, music 7:30pm\n\nThe CMG FESTIVAL will run for six consecutive nights, Tuesday, October 15 through Sunday, October 20, with performances and workshops at No Fun, Turn!Turn!Turn!, Holocene, S1, Leaven Community, and The 1905.

As cyborg-like TJ Thompson splits his body and mind between drums and electronics, vocalist Diana Oropeza conducts an exorcism of language, her torrent of words crashing into and arcing above the legible chaos summoned by her bandmate. It’s not noise. It’s not punk. It’s not poetry. It’s not rock ’n’ roll. It’s not dance music. It’s all of those things. It’s none of those things. It’s something else entirely. It’s the Social Stomach.” – Chris Stamm\n\nhttps://thesocialstomach.bandcamp.com/\n\nHalfbird\n\nHalfbird is an improvising free-jazz/punk/freakout trio from Portland, OR comprised of Ben Kates (alto and baritone sax), Grant Pierce (drums), and Brandon Conway (guitar).
