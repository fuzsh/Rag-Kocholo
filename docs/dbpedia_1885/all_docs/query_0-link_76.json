        "text": "I was 12 years old when I first heard “Survival of the Fittest” from NY-based hip hop duo Mobb Deep – Havoc and Prodigy. They had me in a chokehold when “The Infamous” dropped in 1995. One of the first albums I ever purchased with my own money (on cassette tape).\n\nOver the years I remained a fan as they dropped hit after hit and album after album. I was even a fan of Prodigy’s solo run with the single “Keep It Thoro” on repeat in my CD player. Sadly, Prodigy passed away in 2017, from complications due to him having sickle cell anemia.\n\n6 years later Havoc says there’s a new Mobb Deep album on the way after telling Talib Kweli on a ‘People’s Party’ interview that Prodigy’s family gave him access to a bunch of vocals he had saved before his passing. He also talked about a project he has in the works with legendary Wu-Tang Clan member Method Man.\n\n“I’m actively working on a Mobb Deep album now, as we speak,” Havoc said in the interview. “The family blessed me with a bunch of vocals [by Prodigy] and soon as I leave here, I’m goin’ back to work.”\n\nThe whole Havoc interview with People’s Party is worth watching. Check it out below.\n\n\"The Ugliest Brotha in Radio\" G-Moniy is holding down your afternoons from 3p-7p on Foxy 99.
