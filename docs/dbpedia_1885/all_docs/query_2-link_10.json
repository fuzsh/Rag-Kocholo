        "text": "Few rappers can claim to be as fearsome as Prodigy. The rap menace and member of the legendary duo Mobb Deep was a man who rubbed shoulders with New York’s gangstas and told their stories. His clear-eyed, unflinching verses reflected the daring life he lived. “I’m not scared to die, I’ve dealt with enough,” he told the Village Voice in 2008, predicting his eventual early demise. “I feel like my life is gonna be short anyway because of my sickle-cell.” Born Albert Johnson, Prodigy died today after being hospitalized for complications due to sickle-cell. He was 42.\n\nBoth as a member of Mobb Deep and as a soloist, Prodigy set a standard for East Coast gangsta rap that would not only shape the sound of New York City in the ’90s but create a mold for an entire generation of emcees in the city and beyond. In tribute to his influence, here are highlights from the career of an uncompromising street rap legend.\n\n“Me & My Crew” (1993)\n\nIn 1991, a little-known duo claiming Queens and called Poetical Prophets scored a cosign from The Source Magazine’s coveted Unsigned Hype column, after a run of local shows and radio appearances. By 1992, the teenage tag-team of Prodigy and Havoc were pushing their demo, Flavor 4 the Non Believers, featuring a rough cut of a song called “Me & My Crew.” The music made its way to label folks, who wouldn’t sign the duo unless they changed the name.\n\nPoetical Prophets became the infamous Mobb Deep in 1993, and over the next decade they’d live up to their new name. Havoc, a rapper-producer dynamo, would become the architect for their sound, laying blueprints for a dreary concrete jungle. But Prodigy was the hammer, constructing their scenes and delivering heavy blows. On the new version of “Me & Me Crew” that appeared on debut LP Juvenile Hell, Mobb Deep effectively introduced Prodigy as a teenage rabble-rouser who was small in stature but rapped as if he was King Kong swatting planes atop a skyscraper.\n\n“Peer Pressure” (1993)\n\nProdigy was born into a rich heritage of arts and education. His great-great-grandfather, William Jefferson White, founded Morehouse College in the basement of a Baptist church in Georgia. His grandmother had her own dance school and his grandfather was a jazz musician. He met Havoc as a student at Manhattan’s High School of Art and Design. But his father spent most of his life in prison on weapons and drug charges, and eventually died of AIDS. And Prodigy spent much of his life straddling both worlds, being an artist and a gangster.\n\nThe Juvenile Hell cut “Peer Pressure” (which first appeared on Flava 4 the Non Believers) provided an early glimpse into this dichotomy. Prodigy’s lyrics paint a picture of a conflicted kid seeking a path that seems closed off to him: “Most don’t understand how it is/In the world of today growin’ up as a young black teen/I used to dream, of bein’ an architect/Easier said than done, believe me it's hard to get/Out of the projects, without forgettin’ where you came from.”\n\n“Survival of the Fittest” (1995)\n\nMobb Deep, and more specifically Prodigy, played a key role in reshaping the New York rap scene into something even darker and more sinister. Their seminal album, The Infamous, is among the hardest rap albums ever made, a haunting expedition through a world of gunfights and armed robberies, as told by cold-blooded delinquents with itchy trigger fingers.\n\nThe leap made by the duo between 1993’s Juvenile Hell to 1995’s The Infamous was seismic, and few have ever rapped better than Prodigy did in his second outing—like a man possessed. Even Havoc could hardly believe the strides his partner took. “We were just starting out doing whatever, but when we did The Infamous—if I didn’t know any better—I would of thought somebody else was writing the rhymes because it was like a total 360,” he told Red Bull Music Academy. “When I think back on it, I’m like, ‘Damn, how did he step his game up like that?’” Few places is this more apparent than on “Survival of the Fittest,” the Mobb Deep manifesto turning Darwinian theory into street code. And Prodigy is the apex predator. “There’s a war goin’ on outside no man is safe from/You could run, but you can’t hide forever,” he raps coldly, giving fair warning.\n\n“Diamond” (2000)\n\nOutside of his work with Mobb Deep, Prodigy emerged as a slick-talking mob boss on his solo records, specifically on his three part H.N.I.C. series, where his writing remained as tough-minded as ever. Prodigy filled his bars with so much gun talk that there was little time for myth-making. Very seldom did he measure his status by his achievements; he measured it in respect earned.\n\nThe Just Blaze-produced track “Diamond”—a song about the certification for an album selling 10 million copies—is the closest Prodigy came to discussing his music’s reach, though he did never reached the rarified air of diamond status—no Prodigy album, solo or with Mobb Deep, earned better than a platinum certification. But the rapper had a colossal impact, in New York rap and outside of it, even inspiring Kendrick Lamar, who copped to “biting his style” at one point.\n\n“The Rotten Apple” (2007)\n\nThere are two relationships that have come to define Prodigy’s sound outside of Mobb Deep: his connection to the city of New York, and more specifically his borough, Queens, as well as his friendship with producer the Alchemist. Both are made evident on “The Rotten Apple,” which serves as a fitting tribute. The Alchemist-produced track, off their collaborative album Return of the Mac, is an homage to the city that made Prodigy and the principles it instilled in him—mostly an ability to fend for himself and take on all comers. “I rap what I live, you makin’ up shit,” he spits. Prodigy’s hard-edge bars made for an interesting fit within the Alchemist’s smooth soul loops, but they had a rare chemistry that carried throughout their work together, all the way up to their last release, 2013’s Albert Einstein. The pair weren’t as formidable as the Mobb Deep duo, but Alchemist proved to be a great companion.\n\n“Legends” (2007)\n\nRappers, particularly gangsta rappers, have long made a point of self-eulogizing in song. A lifetime of violence, or close proximity to it, can cause many rappers to think about their legacies at ages where others might simply be thinking about the future. Prodigy, who lived with sickle cell all of his life, had even greater reason to consider his influence while still in the midst of his run. But he was never one to mince words, so, naturally, all talk of death was met indignantly and with defiance. He didn’t leave behind a dispatch on how he wanted to be remembered or how he envisioned his afterlife, as Biggie did in “Suicidal Thoughts”; the thought likely never crossed his mind. On “Legends,” he’s only sure of two things: no one would best him in battle and that his work is eternal. His message, in the spirit of all his messages, was clear: “Gangstas don’t die, we just turn to legends.”"
