        "text": "A new song from the late Mobb Deep rapper Prodigy has been released. The track, “You Will See,” will appear on the forthcoming posthumous album The Hegelian Dialectic 2: The Book of Heroine. Take a listen below.\n\nProdigy’s solo catalog recently returned to digital streaming platforms, thanks to a new distribution deal that the rapper’s estate signed with Warner Music Group’s ADA. “We are extremely thankful to all the fans for understanding the circumstances that our family had to professionally control at a time of grief, and for the kind words of encouragement we received from many of you,” a representative for the estate said in a statement to Billboard. “We would also like to thank the community of hip-hop artists who came together to help us assemble Prodigy’s last projects. The music belongs to all of you and we are glad we can make it available again and forever.”\n\nProdigy died in 2017 at the age of 42. Just a few months before his death, he released the solo album Hegelian Dialectic (The Book of Revelation). The final Mobb Deep album of Prodigy’s lifetime, The Infamous Mobb Deep, came out in 2014."
