Prodigy was hospitalized a few days ago in Vegas after a Mobb Deep performance for complications caused by a sickle cell anemia crisis. As most of his fans know, Prodigy battled the disease since birth. The exact causes of death have yet to be determined. We would like to thank everyone for respecting the family's privacy at this time.\n\nFeck!\n\n42 is no age.\n\nLove Mobb Deep!\n\nRest in Peace Prodigy.\n\nJun 20, 2017\n\n#2\n\nRado_N\n\nYaaas Broncos!\n\nJoined\n\nApr 6, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n111,915\n\nLocation\n\nManchester\n\nOne of the greatest verses in hip hop.\n\nRIP\n\nJun 20, 2017\n\n#3\n\nPaxi\n\nDagestani MMA Boiled Egg Expert\n\nJoined\n\nMar 4, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n27,678\n\nOne of the greatest verses in hip hop.\n\nRIP\n\nWhat a track.
