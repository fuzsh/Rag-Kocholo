        "text": "Guitars that don’t sound like guitars, drums from hell, and a dancer stepping up to the mic for the first time.\n\nThe Prodigy’s massive 1996 single ‘Firestarter’ isn’t just one of the band’s most recognisable tunes, it’s the track that introduced the world to the ferocious vocals and devilish charisma of Keith Flint – who has died at the age of 49.\n\nHe was the punkish, powerful force at the centre of the influential British group’s live show, and ‘Firestarter’ was arguably the singer’s signature tune: an incendiary assault with a dark music video that cemented Keith Flint as an instant ‘90s icon.\n\n'Firestarter' wasn't just a commercial smash hit, it introduced an entire generation to electronic music and club culture, as well as an entire history of punk.\n\n“Like everything good with The Prodigy, it was all spontaneous,” the band’s lead producer Liam Howlett told triple j’s Linda Marigliano on Inspired while touring Australia in February.\n\nHear Howlett and Flint dissect the track below and on the Inspired podcast. Read on for insights about the making of ‘Firestarter’.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"I wrote the song, and then all hell broke loose\"\n\nAfter completing The Prodigy’s second album, 1994’s Music for the Jilted Generation, Howlett was “on a mission to move away from the rave scene [and] do something different.” With “no gap in the writing”, he got started with what would become the lead single to the band’s blockbuster 1997 album The Fat Of The Land.\n\n“I had a vision of what the intro to this album would be like,” Howlett said. “Big build-up at the beginning – this is the first thing people are going to hear of the new record.\"\n\nAt the time, Howlett was experimenting with sampling guitars, but “didn’t want to write a tune where you could hear it was a guitar and what it was doing,” he explained.\n\n“We want to abuse guitars, we don’t want to use them in the same way that everyone else does. So, we’ll smash them up, do whatever we can to not make them sound like a guitar.”\n\nBeing a fan of seminal alt-rockers The Breeders, he sampled their 1993 track ‘S.O.S.’ and deconstructed a droning six-string with the help of keyboards to construct the central “meowing guitar riff.” He then built ‘Firestarter’ from the ground-up, “writing the track as you hear it,” he said, and deciding “Right, this tune needs drums from hell to come in.”\n\n“It had such an evil build that it needed some payoff with the drums. All about the attack on that boom, the kick drum.”\n\nIn those days, Liam would call upon one of his two bandmates to bounce ideas off: MC Maxim Reality or then-dancer Keith Flint.\n\n“Whoever came round first, Maxim or Keith, was the person who owned the tune. That particular day Keith came 'round...\"\n\nRELATED: The J Files: The Prodigy\n\nThe Trouble Starter, Punkin’ Instigator\n\n“I hadn’t done any vocals at that time,” Flint admitted. Aside from “taking the piss” in the style of Rage Against The Machine at gigs or backstage, he had yet to appear on a track. But both he and Liam knew there was potential\n\n“Liam said, ‘I tell you what, if you can focus that [energy] and do that seriously. Let’s do it on a track.”\n\nTurning up to Liam’s and hearing the wailing, muscular backing track for ‘Firestarter’, Flint knew he’d found his debut tune “I said, ‘if you was going to put me on anything, that would be what I’d be on.” Feeding off a loop of the track, Keith grabbed a pen and paper and set to writing.\n\nThe real story behind The Prodigy's 'Firestarter' film clip\n\n“The lyrics are a description of himself,” Howlett remembered. “We ended up having too many lyrics and stripping loads out… The 'Firestarter' hook, the way that came about, it was in the list of one of [Flint's] descriptions of things. I just plucked it out because I thought it just summed him up.”\n\nWorking late into the early AM hours tweaking and refining, “Liam would be going at it,” Flint said. “And I’d be sitting there. He’d turn and go ‘yeah, that’s it. Got it.’ Turn back to me and I was probably smoking weed at the time and eyes half-shut, I’d be like ‘I gotta be honest with you, I can’t hear any difference,” Flint recalled with a chuckle.\n\n“The way the production came out, the sounds, they felt fresh,” Liam added. “That’s always what your’e looking for when you’re writing tunes. You can trace the lineage back to what we were doing before but it’s pushing it forward a bit more. It had the Prodigy-esque drums, but you’ve got this other churning stuff. What is that sound? We don’t really know what it is.”\n\n“Two mates created this thing, and we were really happy with it and it sounded pretty raw.”\n\nUnable to better the demo\n\nSatisfied with the monster they’d caged in their demo, Liam and Keith travelled from Essex to London for mixing and mastering.\n\n“We tried for eight hours on this super-expensive mixing desk trying to reproduce what I’d done in my studio but we just couldn’t get the compression and the attack,” Liam said. “We just couldn’t’ get it better. After all that time in the studio we just binned it all – what you hear now on the finished thing is the demo I did in my studio.”\n\nIt was a similar story for Keith’s vocal. Instead of trying to polish the rough original, they “just plugged a cheap mic straight into the mixing desk and [Keith] performed it like he would do on stage. That take was the one.”\n\n“Usually with Keith, it’s usually the first or second take that’s got the energy and the fire,” Liam continued.\n\n“After that it all gets a bit too thought-about, and you can hear that brain ticking over in the next takes,” Keith added.\n\nFrom then on, The Prodigy always used the first few takes of a Keith vocal for their tracks. “Always. I think we learned a lot that day for what was to come….”\n\nThe car test and live debut\n\nOn their 90min drive home to Essex, “rolling down the M11” in a beaten-up car with a homemade tape system strapped to the boot, Liam and Keith listened back to ‘Firestarter’ “over and over again” to gauge the monster they’d created.\n\n“That moment in time it was just two mates who’d created something and it was no-one else’s,” Liam said. “It was just ours. It hadn’t been played to anybody, just the people in studio. We were trying to give it a couple of minutes, then put it on again and pretend we had new ears listening to it.”\n\nKeith thinks they were figuring out if they were listening to the future of The Prodigy.\n\n“It was like, are we enjoying the process and the thing that we’ve created? Or does this live outside of our own personal enjoyment? And obviously I hadn’t been doing vocals on stage and we were thinking: do we now exist with me as a vocalist? Is that a good transition for us?”\n\nLiam says he flogged the track “10 more times when I got home. Woke up in the morning with fresh ears, played it again, and went ‘yeah this is dangerous this tune’. It’s always what you’re looking for in the studio, create something that you just get that feeling.”\n\nIt wasn’t long after writing and recording ‘Firestarter’ that it wound up in the band’s live show. It went on to become a permanent fixture of their setlist.\n\n“At that point, we had some gigs booked – played it first in Brixton,” Liam recounted.\n\n“I remember Keith looking at me before we went into the tune with the fear of god in him. No one had ever seen Keith with a mic in his hand.”\n\n“There are certain moments that you don't forget. We've been going for years and a lot of it I can't remember. But that was one of the moments I will never forget. People just went mad. They understood it.”\n\nListening back to ‘Firestarter’, The Prodigy pair say the track still feels as dangerous and innovative as the day they threw it together in Liam’s studio.\n\n“It still feels fresh. We’ve played it live hundreds of times, we still play it live. It’s still got the attack and the venom it had back then. We’re proud of it,” the producer said.\n\n“I think there’s a responsibility to the song to always attack it,” Keith added. “And I’m so random myself, I don’t think I’ve ever done the vocals the same since the day I [first] did it. Just in that, keeps it fresh.”\n\nSubscribe to the Inspired podcast for weekly episodes.\n\n'Boiler Room kings': Fans and musicians mourn Keith Flint"
