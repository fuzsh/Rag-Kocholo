In Commissary Kitchen and The State vs Albert “Prodigy” Johnson, written by music writer and editor Kathy Iandoli, the MC and former inmate will share further details about his experience in prison under an illegal gun possession charge. An advocate for convict rights, Prodigy is doing his part to expose injustices behind bars often neglected in mass media.\n\nMobb Deep Talk Career Beginnings & ‘The Infamous’ on Its 20th Anniversary\n\nAccording to a press release, “Commissary Kitchen, which is part cookbook, part anecdotal storybook, details Prodigy’s prison experience through his meals” and will “provide more talking points to the current debate about inmates’ living conditions and prison reform” from the MC’s unique perspective.\n\nIn The State vs Albert “Prodigy” Johnson, “the rapper will chronicle the overall prison experience, the challenges of life after prison and the effects that the prison term has had on his personal life and career” and “will also dissect the dichotomy of what happens when a public figure enters and exits the prison system.”"
