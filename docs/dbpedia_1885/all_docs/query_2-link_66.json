        "text": "The classic album was released on 28th September 1992\n\nThe Prodigy’s founder, songwriter and leader, Liam Howlett, has picked his favourite songs from the band’s debut long-player ‘Experience’ as the classic album celebrates its 30th birthday.\n\nReleased on XL Recordings on 28th September 1992, ‘Experience’ was recorded by Liam Howlett between 1991 and 1992 and it went on to change to face of dance music forever.\n\nThe record peaked at Number 12 in the UK, shifted more than 300,000 copies, and spawned the singles ‘Charly’, ‘Everybody in the Place’, ‘Fire/Jericho’, ‘Out of Space’ and ‘Wind It Up.’\n\nCelebrating its landmark today, Liam Howlett reflected upon making the record three decades ago and he also revealed his four \"choice tunes\" from ‘Experience.’\n\n“Yes people, 30 years today we released our first album ‘Experience’,” Howlett wrote.\n\n“I’ve got many memories of writing and mixing this album in my bedroom studio using minimal equipment and then taking them live to 100s of raves. It was an amazing time.\n\n“All these tunes have been played live at some point over the years. My choice tunes off this album are ‘Jericho’, ‘Wind it up’, ‘Out of space’ and ‘Fire’. What are yours??\n\n“Keep it FIRE peoples!!! Old skool will never die!!\n\n“Master H”\n\nListen to Liam’s choice tunes:\n\nThe Prodigy played a sold-out UK tour in July – their first live dates since the death of Keith Flint in March 2019.\n\nFacts about The Prodigy:\n\nListen to Absolute Radio across the UK on your digital radio, the free Rayo app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen or by asking your smart speaker to \"play Absolute Radio\"."
