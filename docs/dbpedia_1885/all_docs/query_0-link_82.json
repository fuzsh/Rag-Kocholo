        "text": "Albert ‘Prodigy’ Johnson — one half of the legendary and gritty New York City rap duo Mobb Deep — died Tuesday in Las Vegas following complications from sickle cell anemia. He was 42.\n\nA native of Hempstead, Prodigy was born into a family of music. His mother Fatima was a former member of popular 1960s girl group ‘The Crystals’ and his father Budd Johnson was once a member of doo-wop group ‘The Chanters'.\n\nAfter starting Mobb Deep in 1992 alongside Queens native Kejuan ‘Havoc’ Muchita, the duo released their debut album Juvenile Hell in June of 1993. The album produced a minor hit in “Hit it from the back” which propelled all the way to number 18 on the Hot Rap singles chart.\n\nIt was their next album however, that cemented their status as legends of the New York hip hop scene. The Infamous — released in April of 1995 — perfectly chronicled the dark underworld of the poverty stricken and crime ridden neighborhoods of mid-’90s New York City.\n\nWith singles such as Shook Ones Pt. II, Survival Of The Fittest, Temperature’s Rising, and Give Up The Goods, the album spent a total of 18 weeks on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number 15. It was certified as gold by the RIAA on June 26, 1995 after selling over 500,000 copies.\n\nIn a review for the album The Source magazine contributor Dimitry Leger noted at the time: “Mobb Deep earn credibility, winning the crucial battle between style and substance, who’s real and who’s a move-faker. Havoc and Prodigy simply report what they know.”\n\nUltimately that’s what made the duo so charming: their blunt honesty. These weren’t men seeking to play gangster as some of their contemporaries had done, all they were doing was telling you a story. A story of the rough, dangerous, and at times downright deadly way of life in the streets they’d spent their lives surviving. It’s the nature in which they told those stories that made them not only a soundtrack to a neighborhood, but at the height of their popularity, a city.\n\nLook no further than Prodigy’s verse on the aforementioned Shook Ones as a prime example:\n\nMobb Deep’s albums were instrumental in the coming of age of urban youth in the ’90s, and it was their simplicity in their storytelling that made them among all things, relatable, even when the riches they earned in the sales of their both commercially and critically successful albums along the way could’ve threatened to cause them to forget where they came from in the first place. Although it’s sad to lose an icon like Prodigy at such a young age, his impact is one that should be celebrated for the way it revived the East Coast hip hop scene in an era in which there wasn’t much to choose from.\n\nBetween the quotes, stories, and most importantly discography, he will always be timeless."
