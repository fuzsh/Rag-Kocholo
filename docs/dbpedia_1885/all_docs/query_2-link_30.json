        "text": "We will hear two such bands at the Petrovaradin Fortress – The Prodigy and Wu-Tang Clan. Each of these two ensembles is the biggest in its part of the world, a symbol of success, and the standard by which the quality of their genre is measured. They have proven this multiple times over several decades.\n\nBoth bands introduced themselves to EXIT audience in 2007, in the same order and on the same schedule as this year — The Prodigy were the headliners on the first day, while the rappers from New York headlined the last day. However, that’s not the only connection between these two groups of extraordinarily talented individuals who produce their best work when they all come together as one.\n\nThe man who pulls all the strings and ideas for The Prodigy, Liam Howlett, who has never indulged in mainstream world affairs and was not interested in remixing everyone and everything, decided to remix one of the Wu-Tang greats. The song “Release Yo’ Delf,“ originally performed by Method Man, in its Prodigy remix, turns from a hip-hop banger into a classic Prodigy anthem filled with energy and their characteristic sound. As such, it found itself in the prestigious NME magazine on the list of the 50 best remixes of all time.\n\nRZA, the great mastermind behind Wu-Tang, decided to reciprocate by featuring in a somewhat different version of the famous anthem “Breathe,“ whose original had its live debut at a concert in Belgrade back in 1995. Here, the rhythm is slightly shifted and synchronized so that Bobby Digital, as he is sometimes called, could breathe new life into the old anthem. The song was prepared and recorded for the soundtrack of the ninth installment of the “Fast and Furious” franchise. It is particularly symbolic that the song “Breathe” contains a sample from one of the tracks on the epic debut album by Wu-Tang Clan, “Da Mystery of Chessboxin’.”\n\nAnd that’s just the tip of the iceberg that hides the small details in which two great bands composed of big personalities and musicians show respect for each other. What is most important is that the history of pop culture cannot be imagined without either of them. These two groups of highly talented people have influenced many musicians, artists, and people of diametrically opposed professions worldwide. They’ve taught us to think for ourselves, fight for what we believe in, and always be ready for a good time.\n\nAnd a good time is precisely what awaits us on Thursday, July 6, and Sunday, July 9, when these two bands deliver their messages to tens of thousands of people from EXIT Festival’s Gorki List Main Stage."
