        "text": "Prodigy, the New York rap legend and one-half of hip-hop group Mobb Deep alongside Havoc, died Tuesday, a rep confirmed to Billboard. He was 42.\n\nThe rapper was hospitalized in Las Vegas several days ago due to complications caused by a sickle cell anemia crisis, a disease he has battled since birth.\n\n“It is with extreme sadness and disbelief that we confirm the death of our dear friend Albert Johnson, better known to millions of fans as Prodigy of legendary NY rap duo Mobb Deep,” a statement from the rep read. “We would like to thank everyone for respecting the family’s privacy at this time.”\n\nNews first spread of the rapper’s passing from an Instagram post from Nas. “—- QB RIP King P. Prodigy 4 Ever,” he wrote.\n\nThe exact cause of death has yet to be determined.\n\nMobb Deep’s second album, 1995’s The Infamous, is a hardcore hip-hop classic — its impact on the next generation of rap far outpaced its No. 18 peak on the Billboard 200.\n\nThe Infamous produced the Billboard Hot 100 hits “Shook Ones Pt. II,” which peaked at No. 59, and “Survival of the Fittest,” which hit No. 69. Mobb Deep’s highest-charting single was “Hey Luv (Anything),” which reached No. 58 on the Hot 100 in 2002."
