        "text": "Everyone knows which rappers are the greatest of all time: some combination of Rakim, Nas, the Notorious BIG and, since “Blueprint” dropped in 2001, Jay-Z. But I don’t care who’s the greatest; I want to know who’s your favorite.\n\nThese are mine, in no particular order: Cam’ron, Andre 3000, Young Jeezy, Ghostface, Raekwon, Kanye, Malice, Noreaga, Geechi Suede from Camp Lo and Prodigy, who died this week from complications of sickle cell anemia at the age of 42.\n\nThe first time I met P, as everyone called him, it was the summer of 2011 and he had just gotten out of prison. He was on his way to perform at Summer Jam, a New York rite of passage for any hip-hop head, thrown annually by the Hot 97 radio station. I’d been a fan of his rap duo, Mobb Deep, for years. So when I got a heads-up that he was planning to eat at Baohaus, the restaurant I own, I couldn’t sleep the night before. I waited for him to arrive, wearing my “Infamous Mobb Deep” T-shirt and matching red sneakers.\n\nMy exuberance didn’t bother P. When he was done eating, he asked me if I liked “tennis clothes,” then went back into his S.U.V. and pulled out a bag of vintage Le Coq Sportif tops: “I got them for the whole crew. You want one?” I couldn’t accept. I was in shock. Prodigy basically just offered me the Le Coq Sportif off his back because he knew what it would mean to me."
