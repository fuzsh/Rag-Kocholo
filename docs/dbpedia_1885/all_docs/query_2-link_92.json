        "text": "Lin-Manuel Miranda is a huge hip-hop and rap fan. He has said before that he was inspired by Eminem and Common. Also, speaking at a White House event Miranda said that he thinks Alexander Hamilton “embodies hip hop”. Through a combination of Miranda’s love of theater and classic rap Hamilton contains several references to some older rap hits.\n\n“My Shot” which gives a more in depth of Hamilton and his motivations contains two classic rap references. The first reference is to is to a song called “Shook Ones Pt II” by Mobb Deep. In “My Shot” Hamilton sings “Only nineteen but my mind is older” while in “Shook Ones Pt II” Prodigy sings “I’m only nineteen but my mind is old”. Speaking about this reference Miranda says, “It was a no brainer to put that line in because that is something Hamilton would absolutely say. There’s a lot of ‘90s references in that opening tune; it’s the stuff I grew up falling in love with. Hamilton is just like a ‘95 Prodigy. “Shook Ones Pt. II” by Mobb Deep is one of my favorite hip-hop tunes period.”\n\nThe second reference is to The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Going Back to Cali”. Hamilton spells out his name in “My Shot” just like The Notorious B.I.G. does in “Going Back to Cali”. The lyrics to both are reproduced here:\n\n“My Shot”- A-L-E-X-A-N-D\n\nE-R—we are – meant to be\n\n“Going Back to Cali”- N-O-T-O-R-I-O\n\nU-S—you just—lay down slow\n\nThe easiest rap reference to spot in Hamilton is probably the whole song “The Ten Duel Commandments”. This song is so similar to Biggie Smalls’ “The Ten Crack Commandments” that it could almost be a parody. Listing the similarities here would be kinda silly so I encourage you to listen to the songs.\n\nAn important question to ask at this point is why do these references matter? These references can add additional meaning to the work. An example is above where Miranda says Hamilton is just like Prodigy. If all of the references were analyzed so much meaning could be added to these lines.\n\nAlso references give Miranda a chance to give some of his favorite artists sort of a respectful nod and pay tribute to them. In this way references allow important expression for the writer.\n\nFinally, references are opportunities to connect with the audience. Some fans of classic rap may be drawn to the play through these references. If nothing else someone watching could sit back and say “Hey that was pretty cool.”\n\nBy: Max Jarck"
