The late Mobb Deep rapper was 42 when he died in Las Vegas.\n\nThe hip hop community is coming together to celebrate his legacy as Mobb Deep member, Havoc, honored his late friend at the BET Awards Sunday: “For over 20 years, he and I went through it all and seen it all. I’m going to miss my dude.” Both Kendrick Lamar and Eminem performed some of Prodigy’s memorable songs like “Survival of the Fittest” and “Genesis” on Peter Rosenberg’s “Real Late” show.\n\nEminem also added, “I just want to say rest in peace to Prodigy. We love you homie. Hip-hop loves you. You will forever be missed.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMobb Deep’s release of the album “The Infamous” in 1995 lead to their initial success in the hip hop world.
