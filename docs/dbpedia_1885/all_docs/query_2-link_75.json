        "text": "A roundup of the songwriters who collaborated with Bey on 'Renaissance' -- and the songs that are sampled or interpolated on the album.\n\nBeyoncé’s seventh studio album, Renaissance, arrived on Friday (July 29) via Parkwood Entertainment/Columbia Records, putting an end to the six-year wait between proper Bey LPs.\n\nOf course, Beyoncé hasn’t been quiet since 2016’s culture-shifting Lemonade album/film: Her collaborative album Everything Is Love with husband Jay-Z (credited to The Carters) came out in 2018; her 2018 Coachella performance set a new standard for American festival headliners, and led to the release of Homecoming: The Live Album and the Homecoming concert film, both in 2019; also in 2019, she released a soundtrack album The Lion King: The Gift, which paired both with the 2019 remake of the 1994 Disney animated classic The Lion King and her own Black Is King film, which hit Disney+ in 2020; in 2021, she released “Be Alive,” which accompanied the Will Smith-starring King Richard and was nominated for best original song at the 2022 Academy Awards. Quite a fruitful haul between proper studio albums.\n\nRenaissance was preceded by “Break My Soul,” a house-indebted anthem of resilience featuring frequent collaborator Big Freedia, which hit No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100. Aside from the New Orleans Queen of Bounce, the album features an impressive, eclectic roster of collaborators, including The-Dream, Nile Rodgers, NOVA, NO ID, Raphael Saadiq, Mike Dean, Honey Dijon, Chris Penny, Luke Solomon, Skrillex, Beam, Grace Jones and Tems.\n\nCheck out our ranking of the Renaissance tracks here and see which songwriters Beyoncé collaborated with on each of the 16 songs on Renaissance below. Renaissance tracks that includes samples and/or interpolations are also listed.
