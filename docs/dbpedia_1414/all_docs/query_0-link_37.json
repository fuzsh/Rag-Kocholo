        "text": "False consensus due to communication failure\n\nThe Abilene paradox is a collective fallacy, in which a group of people collectively decide on a course of action that is counter to the preferences of most or all individuals in the group, while each individual believes it to be aligned with the preferences of most of the others.[1][2] It involves a breakdown of group communication in which each member mistakenly believes that their own preferences are counter to the group's, and therefore does not raise objections. They even go so far as to state support for an outcome they do not want.\n\nA common phrase related to the Abilene paradox is a desire to not \"rock the boat\". Like in groupthink, group members jointly decide on a course of action that they would not choose as individuals. However, while in groupthink, individuals undergo self-deception and distortion of their own views (driven by, for example, not wanting to suffer in anticipation of a future they sense they cannot avoid by speaking out), in the Abilene Paradox, individuals are unable to perceive the views or preferences of others, or to manage an agreement.[3]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe term was introduced by a management expert Jerry B. Harvey in his 1974 article \"The Abilene Paradox: The Management of Agreement\".[3] The name of the phenomenon comes from an anecdote that Harvey uses in the article to elucidate the paradox:\n\nOn a hot afternoon visiting in Coleman, Texas, the family is comfortably playing dominoes on a porch, until the father-in-law suggests that they take a [50-mile (80-km)] trip to Abilene for dinner. The wife says, \"Sounds like a great idea.\" The husband, despite having reservations because the drive is long and hot, thinks that his preferences must be out-of-step with the group and says, \"Sounds good to me. I just hope your mother wants to go.\" The mother-in-law then says, \"Of course I want to go. I haven't been to Abilene in a long time.\"\n\nThe drive is hot, dusty, and long. When they arrive at the cafeteria, the food is as bad as the drive. They arrive back home four hours later, exhausted.\n\nOne of them dishonestly says, \"It was a great trip, wasn't it?\" The mother-in-law says that, actually, she would rather have stayed home, but went along since the other three were so enthusiastic. The husband says, \"I wasn't delighted to be doing what we were doing. I only went to satisfy the rest of you.\" The wife says, \"I just went along to keep you happy. I would have had to be crazy to want to go out in the heat like that.\" The father-in-law then says that he only suggested it because he thought the others might be bored.\n\nThe group sits back, perplexed that they together decided to take a trip that none of them wanted. They each would have preferred to sit comfortably but did not admit to it when they still had time to enjoy the afternoon.\n\nThe Abilene Paradox consists of five components:[4]\n\nThe first component refers to mutual agreement of a group that the current situation is not acceptable. However, on the individual level, the members may be satisfied with the existing setting after they have compared it with proposed alternatives.\n\nThe second component stands for ineffective communication within the group when several members express considerable support for a decision because they assume that is the desire of others. This process of communication reinforces assumptions that individual thoughts are a minority in the group.\n\nThe third component of the Abilene Paradox is the vocalisation of group sentiment which arose from inaccurate assumptions or incorrect interpretation of the \"signals\" given by other members.\n\nThe fourth component refers to the decision-maker's reflections on the actions taken, usually in the form of questions as follows: \"Why did we do this?\", \"How can we justify our decision to others?\".\n\nThe fifth component refers to the defeat of the group leader to poor decision making in order to avoid making similar decisions in the future. There are several factors that may indicate the presence of the Abilene Paradox in the decision-making process:[4]\n\nLeaders who publicly do not fear the unknown. Such arrogance leads them to go along as they do not possess sufficient understanding of complex problems. Rather, they stick to the \"that sounds good to me\" attitude.\n\nA group with no-conflict or no-debate type of decision-making. When such views are supported in the cohort, the lack of diverse opinions becomes the foundation for mismanagement of agreement. This can be visible by the emergence of the \"I will go along with that\" attitude.\n\nOverriding leaders and a strong organisation culture. A strong leader and solid organisation may become a powerful asset, it may also intimidate other members of subordinates to the point of submission. This results in the inclination of supporting more dominant ideas.\n\nLack of diversity and pluralistic perspective in a group. Homogeneous groups tend to be conformal. Such groups tend to achieve consensus rather than searching for the \"right\" decision.\n\nRecognition of a dysfunctional decision-making environment. Management in this environment has lost control, as the directional prerogative of management has succumbed to wanting to be liked by avoiding conflict.\n\nThe feeling of a \"messiah\" in the organisation and action anxiety on the part of management. When the group handles complex tasks, there is usually one person or a small cohort within the group who has required expertise to manage in this situation. As a result, there is a tendency to acquiesce to them.\n\nThe development of a \"spiral of silence\" in the organisation. The spiral of silence occurs when one's perception of the majority opinion in the organisation suppresses one's willingness to express any challenging opinion against the most visible point of view.[4]\n\nResearch\n\n[edit]\n\nBased on an online experiment with more than 600 participants, being prosocial and generally caring about the implications of one's actions on others (measured by the social value orientation measure) has been shown to increase the likelihood that an individual finds themselves in an Abilene Paradox with others, especially if they are not the first to have a say.[5]\n\nThe study at Makerere University Business School described the case of the Abilene Paradox in the process of decision-making in 2006: The institution was in a dispute with its parent institution, Makerere University, over its status as an independent university. A meeting of the MUBS Academic Staff Association (MUBASA) was called to discuss the issue, and the attendees voted to support MUBS council's decision to sue the Ministry of Education for interfering in a high court pronouncement. Each member of the association was to contribute towards the legal costs. By interviewing 68 employees, the researcher found that the majority of them never considered it a solution but thought that others strongly support the idea of starting the trial.[6]\n\nChen and Chang conducted a study about the effects, causes, and influences of the Abilene paradox, if any, on their elementary school; and this study involved twelve faculty members. Results of this Abilene paradox study showed a negative effect on the schoolâ€™s operation, through poor communication, inadequate interaction, isolation, exclusion, and rising gossip.[7]\n\nApplications of the concept\n\n[edit]\n\nThe theory is often used to help explain poor group decisions, especially notions of the superiority of \"rule by committee\". For example, Harvey cited the Watergate scandal as a potential instance of the Abilene paradox in action.[8] The Watergate scandal occurred in the United States in the 1970s when many high officials of the Nixon administration colluded in the cover-up and perhaps the execution of a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C. Harvey quotes several people indicted for the coverup as indicating that they had personal qualms about the decision but feared to voice them. In one instance, campaign aide Herbert Porter said that he \"was not one to stand up in a meeting and say that this should be stopped\", a decision that he attributed to \"the fear of the group pressure that would ensue, of not being a team player\".[8]\n\nAnother notable example of applying the Abilene paradox to the notorious real-world event can be seen during and in the aftermath of the 1989 United Kingdom Hillsborough tragedy and its cover-up by the authorities, which was characterised by individually hesitant, but otherwise compliant, government agents and the narrative and available information moulded and manipulated by the state.[9] The other frequently cited example is the case of Challenger disaster, thought in that case researchers use both the concepts of groupthink and the Abilene paradox as possible explanation of the events.[10]\n\nThe phenomenon of the Abilene paradox can also be used in information systems development, to conceptualise and operationalise the relationship between systems analysts, users, and other organisational stakeholders in situations of illusory agreement.[11]\n\nRelated concepts and explanations\n\n[edit]\n\nOther theories add to the Abilene paradoxâ€™s explanation of poor decision-making in groups, notably, such phenomena as groupthink and pluralistic ignorance.\n\nThe concept of groupthink posits that individuals correctly perceive the preferences of others, undergo some form of motivated reasoning, which distorts their true preferences, and then willingly choose to conform; hence, they generally feel positively about the resulting group decisions.[12] The success of groupthink also hinges on the long-term homogeneity of the group, which seeks to keep that same cohesiveness and therefore to avoid all potential conflict.[13] However, while groupthink, to some extent, depends on the ability of individuals to perceive attitudes and desires of others, the Abilene paradox hinges on the inability to gage true wants and intentions of group members.[14]\n\nThe concept of pluralistic ignorance, on the other hand, is also defined as the situation where an individual underestimates the extent to which their views are shared by the other members of the group or organisation.[15] In some ways, pluralistic ignorance can be considered as a factor inciting situations where the Abilene paradox occurs â€” individualsâ€™ inability to correctly estimate the share of potential supporters lead to the assumption of â€˜the worst case scenarioâ€™ and in-advance mitigation of potential risks of dealing with the opponents. Some researchers consider pluralistic ignorance to be a wider-ranging concept: while both groupthink and the Abilene paradox are usually discussed as the detriments to successful group decision-making, pluralistic ignorance is sometimes evaluated neutrally.[16]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nHarvey, Jerry B.
