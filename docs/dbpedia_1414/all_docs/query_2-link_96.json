        "text": "Marlene E. (Savard) Nowak, 61 years old, of Lewiston, died peacefully on May 16, 2010 at her home, surrounded by her family and friends, while under the care of Niagara Hospice. She was born in Niagara Falls, on April 5, 1949, the daughter of Edgar \"Pete\" Savard and the late Emmaline (Felvus) Savard. To say she left behind her mark is an understatement. Marlene's life touched everyone she came in contact with, from the children she babysat over the years, to her friends to her family, and even the caregivers from Niagara Hospice that she knew only for a short time.. In life, as in death, Marlene was constantly surrounded by family and friends. She loved them all and would do anything she could for the people she loved. Marlene attended local schools and lived a good life. She and her husband, Pat, and of course \"the kids,\" spent many summers at their \"camp\" in Friendship, NY. Even after the camp was sold she still had the weekly Friendship newspaper delivered to keep up on what was happening. There are so many stories you can tell about a blessed life, so in short, Marlene could have written a book! Marlene spent many years being the \"Avon Lady\" for her many friends.. Marlene is survived by her father, Edgar \"Pete\" Savard; her devoted husband of 41 years, Patrick Nowak, who together with Marlene walked side by side through life; her daughter, Marla (Jeff) Williams of Lewiston; and her son, Patrick (Fran) Nowak, Jr. of Lewiston. Marlene was blessed with amazing grandchildren that she loved more than anything; Brooke, Jack, Megan, Heather and Patrick III. They were the light of her life and nothing made her happier than when they were out playing in her yard or running around the house, or just stopping in to visit. Marlene is also survived by her brother, Edward (Janelle) Savard of Niagara Falls; her sister, Kim (Perry) Novak of Bridgewater, NJ; and her brother-in-law, Ronald Colangelo of the Town of Niagara. Marlene was predeceased by her mother, Emmaline (Felvus) Savard and her sister, Sharon Colangelo.. There will be no visitation as per Marlene's wishes. Your thoughts and prayers are encouraged, and if so desired, donations in memory of Marlene can be made to Niagara Hospice, Inc., 4675 Sunset Drive, Lockport, NY 14094, as they created a loving and caring environment for Marlene in her final days. A private entombment will be held in Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Lewiston. Arrangements have been entrusted to the LABUDA FUNERAL HOME, INC.. Visit www.niagara-gazette.com/obituaries."
