For the remainder of WW II she did heavy work on a farm in Germany. She remembers always being hungry and cold. Her clothes were never dry from working in the rain and her feet were often cold because she did not have good shoes, wearing wooden shoes. Although the farm was productive, the best food was sent away; the farm workers were not allowed to have any. She recalls one day when one of the boys drank some of the good milk and was later beat up by the police as punishment. In addition, she has told of the workers making soup from grass for nourishment.\n\nThe farm belonged to a German family consisting of a father, who was killed in the war, a mother, a boy and a baby boy. Styvie had a hard time leaving the baby but not the farm. As the farms were liberated, she recalled the Allied soldiers telling the workers to take anything they wanted from the farm. She declined, and set out to make a new life for herself.

She then traveled to Glasgow by train and resided here, working for Jack & Jean Baker at the Roosevelt Hotel and in their home for many years. She later worked at the Campbell Lodge for Mel and Gloria Fuhrman. In later years, she enjoyed cleaning in private homes, and through this, became a treasured part of many families.\n\nStyvie realized a goal on June 24, 1985, when she became a citizen of the United States and counted this as one of the best days of her life. She took the oath before Judge Paul Hatfield in Federal Court in Great Falls, one of 23 people who became citizens that day. She was honored by her many friends during a reception the next day at St. Raphael's. To remember the event, she received four flags, including one from U.S. Representative Ron Marlenee that was flown in her honor in Washington, D.C., on June 28, 1985.\n\nShe was devoted to her faith and was an active member of St. Raphael's Catholic Church, serving in St. Cecelia's Circle. In her later years, Styvie enjoyed the fellowship of friends at Nemont Manor, where she had lived since the late 90's.\n\nStyvie is survived by many friends in the community who appreciated her courage and learned from her faith.
