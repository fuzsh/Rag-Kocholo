        "text": "This is leadership. Marlene Engelhorn, who is 31 and lives in Vienna, wants 50 Austrians to determine how ‚Ç¨25m (¬£21.5m) of her inheritance should be redistributed. Engelhorn inherited the money from her family, who owns the chemical giant BASF. She wants her vast wealth to be redistributed across society and has campaigned for years for a more equitable tax system in her home country. \"‚Ç¨25 million can be redistributed because the state does not redistribute it. I have this money because it is not taxed. I have this money because the government has failed to fulfill its mandate to ensure that wealth is distributed in society in such a way that it doesn't end up unequally in my hands just because I'm in this world, in this particular family, with this surname,\" Marlene Engelhorn said during a press conference Wednesday. The heiress has been urging the government to impose taxes on that money for many years. However, given Austria's absence of inheritance or wealth taxes, she sought an alternative solution: setting up a council to decide how the fortune would be distributed. A Citizens' Council comprising 50 individuals will be formed through a two-step process: 10,000 letters will be sent to residents, followed by the selection of 50 members and 15 substitutes. Eligibility requires members to be over 16 years old and representative of the population in Austria. The Council \"Guter Rat f√ºr R√ºckverteilung\", which means good advice for redistribution, will meet for six weekends from March until June and work on proposals to distribute the wealth. Marlene Engelhorn will not have any influence on the distribution. #thisisleadership #leadership https://lnkd.in/eX_2G-DK\n\nThis country is definately heading the wrong way with this taxation debate. While the government talks of austerity measures, her actions have repeatedly proven hypocritical. Alot of non-issues are availed to us and where narrow interests seem to subdue the larger course for reasonable debates. If you have happened to notice, leaders charged with responsibilities of serving are busy building a patron-client system right under our noses. A system based on loots and peculiar connections instead of meritocracy, trust and hard work. It happens that you will see them inviting their followers to indulge in expensive alcohol quench in their newly acquired masions and villas in Karen and Loresho etc. Coming back to the tax debate which a few analysts have labled as a horrible decisions by the current regime, decisions largely dictated by an appetite of a government that wants to collect more but one that doesnt want to be held on account of its spending. The debate on taxation has seen people and industries driving the economy crying faul. But this debate is an easier one as the government can (if they want to) mobilize compromises and support to gain a common ground. What is however missing in these debates is what in real sense the government would wants to do with these funds, and the honesty in their intention (see YouTube interview videos of Jimmy Wanjigi to understand where I am coming from. As we speak in general, we have saddening stories for instance over 500,000 pupils cannot access schools because of the aftermath of floods. This is politically a non issue. Businesses are closing down not only because of the costs of staying afloat but also because of a significant reduction of local consumer purchasing power. Politically, this seems not to be an issue. Corruption makes it hard to start and sustain small bussineses, and where funds collected are diverted into private pockets with full impunity. Again politically, this also seems not to be problem. Peharps the issue appear largely to be about ‚Ä¶plunder and tax them more, collect more and then plunder further! When you have so many pressing issues to address as government every shilling collected must be spent in prudence. So I thought! #DemocraticSpacesDictates!\n\nExploring the Essentials of Taxation in a Modern Economy: Taxation plays a crucial role in our economy, serving two primary purposes: funding government expenditure and influencing domestic economic management. Additionally, it serves as a tool to achieve various social objectives, impacting wealth distribution and encouraging specific behaviors. The UK tax system is designed to: 1. Incentivize individual savings and pension provision through tax incentives. 2. Support charitable donations via schemes like gift aid. 3. Encourage entrepreneurship and investment with targeted tax reliefs. Conversely, it discourages certain behaviors, such as motoring (fuel duties) and smoking/drinking (imposing taxes). Moreover, taxation policies contribute to \"Green\" initiatives, addressing climate change and promoting sustainability. Understanding the broader impact of taxation requires considering both direct and indirect taxes. Direct taxes, like income tax and corporation tax, are levied on income and capital transfers, while indirect taxes, such as VAT, are applied to goods and services. As we navigate the intricacies of taxation, it's crucial to acknowledge the comprehensive knowledge provided by organizations like ACCA in shaping financial professionals equipped to understand and navigate these complexities. #Taxation #EconomicManagement #SocialObjectives #ACCA #FinancialProfessionals #UKTaxSystem #GreenInitiatives #FinancialLiteracy #TaxPolicy #WealthDistribution #FinancialEducation #EconomicImpact #GovernmentFinance #GreenTaxation #Sustainability #ACCAInsights #UKFinance #FiscalResponsibility #FinancialLiteracy #TaxIncentives #Entrepreneurship #InvestmentStrategies #SocialImpact #GreenEconomy #ACCAEducation #EconomicBalance #TaxDecisions #FinancialPlanning #UKEconomy\n\nNEWS | Swedish yield tax for 2024 amounts to 1.086% On 23 November 2023, the GBR for income year 2024 which is 2.62% was published, thus implying an effective yield tax of 1.086% ((2.62% + 1%) x 30%) on the value of the #lifeinsurance policy as of 1 January 2024 in addition to the full value of the premiums paid up to 30 June 2024 and half the value of the premiums contributed between 1 July and 31 December 2024. üìàDue to increased interest rates, both in Sweden and globally, the yield tax for income year 2024 has increased significantly when compared to previous years. Nevertheless, at The OneLife Company we are of the opinion that life assurance policies (the so-called ‚ÄúK-Insurance‚Äù in Sweden) still remain a very attractive investment vehicle üëå due to their undeniable estate planning and advantageous tax treatment, together with the related investment opportunities, including private equity and a wide range of both quoted and unquoted assets which could be very attractive for Swedish investors.
