A very famous sculptor in Sweden has the last name of Katz. Don't confuse Katz with Katze in German means cat as in the wine. Nothing to do with it. Katz is two Hebrew words which mean The Tribe of the High Priests. There are Katz's all over the world and in places you can't imagine. More later.

One of my other daughters, Shoshana was on the team in 2002, too. the third daughter was on the team at a different high school. I won't be insulted if you want to keep the level of participation above high school.

My brother, Allan Katz, has a very noteworthy career in show business. Among his many credits, Allan was Executive Producer of M*A*S*H*, Rhoda, Roseanne and wrote and starred in the film \"Big Man on Campus.\" He also wrote the book for the award winning musical \"Song of Singapore.\" My sister, Phyllis Katz, is a highly respected actress/singer (member/teacher at the Groundlings in Los Angeles, co-star of Sherman Oaks series on Showtime) and songwriter. My daughter, Lauren Katz, is a well-respected actress and member of the now-defunct but heavily cult-followed improvisational trio known as Slotnick, Katz & Lehr. My son, Steve Katz, is a real estate partner in a Minneapolis law firm as well as an adjunct professor of law at University of Minnesota law school and a first-rate jazz bassist who has performed at the better local Minneapolis clubs (Artist's Quarter and Dakota).

Here's the unbiased version of my soccer career: -Firts female soccer player at Concordia University to play out her five years of eligibility -five year starting defender -2001-2002 Varsity MVP -2002-2003 co-assistant captain -five years of AA soccer There are some soccer pics at http://web2.concordia.ca/Rec_Ath/Intercollegiate/Soccer/wgallery.html My varsity career sadly came to an end in May when it was time to graduate.

I am still surprised at the size of our family; people from all over the globe. To those relatives living outside the USA, I hope you appreciate the sanity and peace of your home. Here in the USA we are currently going through a sad time. Some of our leaders have become the antithesis of the image that we Americans have of our society. Some Senators spend more time harassing us than you would think feasible. We have little peace and a paucity of intelligent behavior. The good feelings that we here have for others is hardly reflected in the headlines.

Edward Maret, a science fiction novel, was recommended for the 2001 Nebula Award by Paul Levinson, then President of the Science Fiction Writers of America, and won the ASA Literary Award. Surgical Risk, a mystery, received excellent reviews from Mystery Review, Mystery Scene Magazine, Midwest Book Review, Crescent Blues, and many others. The Anatomy Lesson, the sequel to Surgical Risk, was released only a few weeks ago. In any case, it would be nice if the covers were on your collection of Katz book covers. Also, you might be interested to know that the covers of Surgical Risk and The Anatomy Lesson were designed by my son, Steven A. Katz. Thanks, Robert I.

Ethel (maiden name ?, still looking); they had grocery store in Portchester (or perhaps Greenwich CT across the border)! further, their children, Katzes all, were Mike, Jacob, Harry, Alice, and Jenny!! Jenny Katz married Sam Kaslowsky who emmigrated here (from?...some say vilna) in 1888. Sam and Jenny lived on travis ave. in Portchester. he sold \"junk\" from the yard, scrap steel from Sing Sing. Sam died around 1937, Jenny in the '60's. that's all i know for now. just found the site and will pass this along toother descendents of nathan and ethel katz for more info. any further connections will be most appreciated. i am Sam Bruskin (mother Edith Kaslowsky Bruskin), daughter of Sam & Jenny Katz Kaslowsky, daugher of Nathan and Ethel Katz.

How about finding the oldest living Katz out there? I'll nominate my Mom, Mary Katz, at 92.\n\nName: Noah Katz\n\nEmail: naohkatz@noahkatz.net\n\nDate: March 28, 2005\n\nTime: 11:00 AM\n\nComments\n\nName: Gabrielle Katz\n\nEmail: gk_333@yahoo.com\n\nDate: March 28, 2005\n\nTime: 02:37 PM\n\nComments\n\nThis is great! My great grandmother \"adopted\" our name from a chicken store on the lower east side of Manhattan. There was a canopy that read \"Katzowich\" or \"Katzovich\" - we are not sure, but we would love to know if anyone knows about the store, or even has a picture of it. The store was around in the late 1800s/early 1900s. Any information would be very much appreciated.\n\nName: Tony Katz (aka Anthony)\n\nEmail: tony@katz.us\n\nDate: March 30, 2005\n\nTime: 01:01 AM\n\nComments\n\nGreat Web Site We are based in the UK.
