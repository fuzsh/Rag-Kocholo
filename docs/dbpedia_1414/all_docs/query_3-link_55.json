And grammatically it is as\n\nunpleasant as if somebody spoke of the \"Of Devonshire family\" in\n\nEnglish.

I've seen three\n\npictures of Nicholas Frederick's daughter Florence. she is really\n\nbeautiful. But both events were social events in London. The only\n\nother thing I know is that his other daughter Beatrice attended\n\nBryanston School in England, a boarding school, and then she was an\n\nintern at a magazine. I know nothing of his daughter Augusta.\n\nI know the people here hate questions like \"do you have any\n\ninformation on so and so?\" because they are too broad. So to be more\n\nspecific, I'd really like to know how this branch of the von Preussen\n\nline fits into the broad scheme of things. What is their function? Are\n\nthey purely private people with \"normal\" jobs/schooling, living lives\n\ncompletely devoid of royal duties, and going to the odd social event\n\njust for kicks.\n\nThis post will probably be moved over to alt.talk.gossip because of\n\nwhat I'm about to say... but I must! Princess Florence von Preussen is\n\nso beautiful and classy that I think she would make a fine future\n\nPrincess of Wales! She is close to William's age, having been born in\n\n1983, and her relation to the Queen Victoria line certainly qualifies\n\nher as \"well-bred\" enough to be Queen of England, does it not?\n\nIt appears that they live in London, but do they have a castle\n\nsomewhere?\n\nZRC\n\nShinjinee\n\nPost by Zara Rivera Chewster\n\nI'm looking for information about his family. I can see from the\n\ngenealogical sites that he is married to Victoria Mancroft and has\n\nthree daughters, etc. But I wonder where they live and if this family\n\nIf you check out the Theroff Gotha (searcheable under that name) you\n\nwill find more information on how this branch fits into the rest of\n\nthe former Royal House of Prussia. I believe that he is no longer\n\nmarried to the Hon. Victoria Mancroft, the sister of a British peer.\n\nThere was some news about this earlier on this same group.\n\nAccording to some sources, the marriage of *Nicholas* to Hon. Victoria\n\nMancroft has not been recognized by the head of the house, meaning\n\nthat his children (including Frederick Nicholas, b 1990) are not\n\n\"Princes and Princesses of Prussia\" but merely Prinz and Prinzessin\n\nvon Preussen (in the German surname). Marlene Koenig says that he and\n\nhis brothers did not seek approval of the head of the house. Whether\n\nhis marriage woyuld have been approved under the terms granted to his\n\nparents (see below) is another matter.\n\nThe marriage of his father (a staunch Anglophile) to the daughter of\n\nthe 2nd Earl of Iveagh was recognized, but apparently only as\n\nnon-dynastic. Lady Brigid Guinness was the daughter of an Earl (and a\n\nvery rich one at that, being of the Guinness brewery fortune. Why\n\nthis is, I do not know, other than the fact that the Guiness family\n\nwere relatively recently ennobled, becoming baronets only in 1885 (in\n\nthis branch) although earlier for the first Earl's father who was also\n\na first baronet. I do not know how old the nobiliary status and\n\ntitles of the other non-royal German noblewomen were (those who\n\nmarried Prussian princes in the same period). At this time\n\n(1930s-1950s) many German houses considered untitled but old noble\n\nfamilies to be \"higher\" than the families of recently titled British\n\npeers and baronets.\n\nPlease see the following sources\n\nMarlene Koenig, using the semi-official Hohenzollern bulletin (2000)\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?q=%&selm=20000121232235.03574.00000446%40ng-cv1.aol.com&rnum=10\n\n\"Other marriages that do not conform to House laws: Frederick\n\nNicholas, Wilhelm Andrew and Rupert. But the marriage of their father\n\nto Lady Brigid Guinness was considered equal.\"\n\nFor the thread discussing Prussian house law in 1938\n\nhttp://prussianhouselaw1938.notlong.com\n\n[this is a tiny URL leading to the thread]\n\nJerome on the marriage of Frederick Nicholas's parents (1999):\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&selm=7p53rf%24ftu%241%40nnrp1.deja.com\n\naccording to the Almanach de Gotha *the marriage was apparently\n\nnon-dynastic* but with rights of RH and Prince and Princess for the\n\nissue*\n\nFrank Johansen, quoting Marlene, on the non-dynastic marriages of the\n\nMansfield/Guinness children (2001)\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?q=&selm=3AE4390E.284720B0%40hm.telia.no&rnum=6\n\nMarlene on the marriage of Frederick's parents (1997)\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/groups?q=%&selm=ZTbESK3.makoenig%40delphi.com&rnum=4\n\nShinjinee"
