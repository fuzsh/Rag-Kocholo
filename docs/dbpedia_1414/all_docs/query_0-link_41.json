The earliest stone is dated 1825.\n\nThe earliest known map for the Fingal Cemetery is dated November 16th 1860 and was made by Jesse P. Ball, Provincial Land Surveyor. Sampson Sutton was shown as “owner” at that time.\n\nDuring the late winter of 1888 and early spring of 1889 an outbreak of smallpox occurred in the village. The village was quarantined. Those who died from the disease were buried within hours of their death.\n\nIn May 1892, a meeting of lot holders was held and the decision was made to form a Board for the Cemetery. The first meeting of the newly formed Fingal Cemetery Board was held May 13, 1892 in the Town Hall.\n\nChairman Daniel MacPherson\n\nVice Chairman Charles Newland\n\nSecretary S. E. Burwell\n\nTrustees Charles Teetzel, Levi Sutton, John Williams, John Culver, Denis Lawrence, Peter Stevenson, Benjamin Johnston, James Robb\n\nVarious improvements to the cemetery were made through the years and in November, 1927, a vote was taken to purchase four (4) feet of property across the back. The year 1929 saw a storage building and an outside facility built. In 1954 more lots were added to the north of the property. In 1977 a donation provided the means to erect the sign “Fingal Cemetery” at the front gate. In 2006 the wind destroyed the original sign and a replacement was installed in 2007. On July 24, 1989 approval was received from the Ministry of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Township of Southwold to enlarge the existing cemetery by 100 feet x 270 feet to the north.\n\n4.

The board concluded that the disease was smallpox despite the insistence of Dr. James McLaughlin that it was only chickenpox. All public meeting places were closed and the board decided to enforce vaccination. On the same day Lemuel Young, father-in-law of Ina Young, became ill and after four days passed away leaving a family of six children.” St. Thomas Daily Times, Feb 25, 1889, gives death notice.
