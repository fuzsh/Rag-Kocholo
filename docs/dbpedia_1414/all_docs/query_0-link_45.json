        "text": "The old cemetery at Prospect is located along the Prospect Village Road before you enter the village proper. The cemetery was relocated from a plot of land within the village, located today by the former Sisters of Charity convent and marked with a large Cross, as the village grew in the middle 19th Century. The headstones that remain today by no means represent the number of people buried in this cemetery.\n\nIn the early 1990s an addition was made to the original cemetery plot where all current burials are made. So this listing contains headstones from that addition as well.\n\nThe following is an alphabetical listing of each headstone with a transcription of each inscription. This transcription was taken by George Newberry in August 1999 and the photos were taken by Barry Coolen in October 2009. The listing is current to burials as of October 2021."
