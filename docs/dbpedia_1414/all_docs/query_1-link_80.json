Cause of death was suicide, gun shot wound through the head which happened in his office. - Wheaton Journal, Thursday, March 17, 1932 - Cassville Man Shoots Self Wednesday: C. D. Manley, well known Cassville citizen and insurance agent, shot himself in the temple with a revolver while seated in a chair at his desk about three o'clock Wednesday afternoon of last week. He had gone to his office, returning from the scene of a fire and within ten minutes was found in his chair. Medical aid was summoned and he died about an hour later. The bulled passed entirely through the top of his head and was later found on the floor of his office. The above report was given out soon after Manley was found shot, but it was later thought that some unknown person might have murdered him. The bullet ranged downward as if the gun was held higher than his head which would be almost impossible for him to hold the gun in this position and there were no powder burns around the wound. Also there was a lump on his jaw, apparently cased by a blow, and the back door was unlocked. These incidents and others caused some to believe that he did not kill himself. - Cassville Democrat, March 24, 1932 - SEVERAL HUNDRED ATTEND MANLEY FUNERAL FRIDAY AGED BOOSTER HAD MANY FRIENDS THRU OUT SOUTH-WEST MISSOURI: Funeral services for Charles D. Manley, who died in his office in Cassville, last Wednesday afternoon, were held at the Community Building in this city Friday afternoon and was one of the largest funeral's held here in many years. Services were in charge of by Rev. Patrick of the Cassville Christian Church and Rev. Dillion of the Methodist church, of which the deceased was a member. Not for some years has such a gathering of splendid citizenship been in our city for such an occasion, to pay their last love and respect to a man whose every thought was to do something that would progress his city, county and state. Charles D. Manley was a son of the late Mr. and Mrs. W. D. Manley, old time citizens of this city and county. He was born at Hackett City, Ark., Feb. 2, 1862 and was 70 years and 12 days old at the time of his passing. When he was a mere babe his excellent mother carried him on horseback, as they traveled from their Arkansas home to East St. Louis, Illinois. They passed through Cassville on their trip and camped over night in a sheep shed near Washburn, at which time one of Mrs. Manley's horses was stolen. Mr. Manley was married to Belle Goodnight on December 24th, 1884. Three children were born to this union, 2 sons and one daughter who are: Lennie Manley, Monett, and Miss Elaine Manley of Tulsa, Okla. Another son preceded his father in death several years ago. Mr. Manley came to Cassville in the year of 1886, where he engaged in the insurance and real estate business with his father whom he succeeded in the business at his death, many years ago. He served Barry county as clerk of the county court two terms from 1902 to 1910. He had also served the City of Cassville as Mayor several terms and was a most progressive official. \"The Old Wagon\" as he was called by his many friends, was one of the biggest hearted men in this county. Never did he turn a deaf ear to pleas of the hungry or needy. His purse was always open in a big way to any who were in distress or for any other community enterprise or progress. Never did he falter in his efforts to progress his city, county and state. An unselfish worker in every way and it was largely through his untiring efforts that Barry county enjoys such excellent highway facilities as it has today. His activities were not confined to any one community, but to all alike, just so the attempted project was in his county or state. \"The Old Wagon\" was a man who had many friends, and very few enemies; any man who has taken important parts in public life for the many years as this great booster, could not maintain the friendship of all; but at that, those who would be classed as his enemies, admired him, and have often been heard to so state. The night was never too stormy or dark but that he gladly and willingly responded to the sick and distressed. In speaking of this prominent citizen, the Springfield Press, in a recent issue, said - Down at Cassville business men of the town refer to Charles D. Manley as \"The Wagon,\" because he carries the burdens of the community. If there is a fund to be raised or committee to be organized, they call on \"Wagon\" and although some of the roads have been exceptionally rough he has never failed to deliver. He has done more to advertise Cassville and Barry county than any other citizen. His hobby is collecting photographs of important gatherings and historic events. These pictures he used for advertising purpose. Charley Manley was a member of the Methodist church, the Masonic Lodge, W. O. W., and M. W. A. lodge. During the several years he served as president of the Cassville Commercial Club, he worked day and night for his town and county and many splendid ideas were originated through his brilliant mind which meant much to our city and county. Mr. Manley was with W. H. (Coin) Harvey when the Ozark Trail was routed from St. Louis to Las Vegas, N. M., in 1916. On this trip, members of the routing party paid their own expenses and blazed the trail for a good roads program in the middle west. Mr. Manley said highway 66 now follows a large portion of the original route. A quartette composed of Mrs. John Ray, Miss Pauline Hisey, Clinton Blythe and J. W. Hisey, rendered beautiful music at the service. A solo, \"A Perfect Day,\" was sung by Mrs. John Ray, accompanied by Mrs. Troy Wilson at the piano. Many beautiful floral emblems were received by the bereaved family from friends and admirers at home and afar as an expression of the high esteem in which this strong character was held. Interment was made in the Oak Hill cemetery at Cassville, under direction of the Horine-Culver Funeral Service. Masonic services were given at the grave. \"The Old Wagon,\" the friend and counselor has passed on, but his life and influence will keep living many ages. The Democrat joins the many friends of the grief stricken family in extending sincere sympathy to them in their sad hour of bereavement. Mayor Wilks issued the following proclamation: Mayor Proclamation - Our highly esteemed and dearly beloved fellow townsman, Charles D. Manley having departed this life, March 9, 1932, and whose body will be laid to rest after funeral services, which will be held at 2:00 in Community Hall building, March 11 as mayor of the city of Cassville, in which official position the deceased has served his people three terms so efficiently and honorably, I hereby request all business and professional houses be closed from 2:00 o'clock until 3:30 p. m., thereby expressing not only our last token of respect for the services he so unselfishly has rendered to the whole citizenship of our city, county and state, but in addition show to the members of his family our sympathy for each of them in their great loss. Done at office in City Hall, this 10th day of March, 1932. B. D. Wilks, Mayor. - Another News Item: Charles Derius Manley - Was born at Hacket City, Sebastian County, Ark., Feb. 27, 1862, and is a son of Mr. and Mrs. W. D. Manley, former residents of Cassville. In 1863, Mr. Manley's mother passed through Cassville on her way to Illinois by horseback carrying Charlie in her arms. In Illinois she met her husband. After the war, in 1867, they removed and located near Cassville, making the trip with an ox team. Mr. Manley attended the public schools of Barry county and received his education. He taught school in this county and afterwards served as Deputy County Clerk seven years. In connection with his father, they established an Insurance, Abstract and Real Estate business to which Mr. Manley succeeded on the death of his father, which was conducted successfully for fifteen years. On Dec. 21, 1884, Mr. Manley and Miss Belle Goodnight were united in marriage and to whom have been born four children, three of which are living. In 1902, Mr. Manley was nominated by the Democratic party for County Clerk and was elected by a handsome majority. The early part of Mr. Manley's life was spent on the farm, and on account of the limited means of his father, had a \"hard row to hoe,\" but being backed by a strong will and energy has accomplished much by his own efforts. - August 4, 1917, Saturday, Cassville Democrat - Len Manley and family spent Sunday here, with parents Mr. and Mrs. C.

In 1919 he made a study of soils in Central America with a party sent under the direction of President Wilson and in 1923 he was a member of a party sent to the Amazon River Valley by the Government to study the possibilities of rubber development. He was awarded the Cullum medal of the American Geographical Society in 1929 for research conducted into Africa soils and the next year, after a trip to Russia, published a study of wheat production possibilities in that country. Born July 19, 1863, near Verona MO, he was graduated from the University of Missouri in 1889. And received a graduate degree from Harvard in 18?5. (Wrong date). He later received honorary degrees from the University of Missouri and Rutgers College. He joined the University of Missouri faculty in 18?5, [date not complete] serving until 1910. Arrangements are being made to have the body cremated and returned to Cassville, Mo., for burial. Thus passes an outstanding son of Barry County, a man whom every civilized nation interested in soil and in agricultural progress has used. Down near McDowell, Dr. Marbut was building a house in which he had expected to retire soon. In fact, he had retirement in sight when he started work on the house last year, but he was drafted for some work up at the University of Missouri and shortly he was back in the harness of doing good, and other countries were calling for his services. Mr. Marbut was born near Verona, Mo., July 19, 1863. He was graduated from the University of Missouri in 1889. he later received honorary degrees from the university and from Rutgers College. He joined the staff of the University of Missouri in 1895, serving until 1910. Since that time he had been sent on government missions and had been used by the university from time to time. Mrs. Marbut died several years ago and is buried at Cassville. That is where the ashes of Dr. Marbut is expected to be burial. Five children survive: Mrs. Leroy Moomaw of Dinkinson, N. D., T. Fiske Marbut of Emporia, Kas., Dr. W. Martin Marbut, Echo, Ore., Helen Marbut, Harrisonburg, Va. And Frederick B. Marbut of Washington, D.C. Jake and Ethel Marbut are brothers of Dr. Marbut and Vede and Clint Marbut are cousins. Mrs. Marbut, whose maiden name was Martin, died in Columbia in 1909 of pneumonia. In the news dispatches, Verona is given as Dr. Marbut's birthplace, but that is because Verona was the post office of those who lived in the Marbut Valley, or Little Flat creek in those old days. The new home which Dr. Marbut has under construction is a short distance down the valley road from the Marbut spring and thence up a little ravine in a secluded spot. It is near the spot where his father settled something like 100 years ago. - Bio for Curtis - Photo of Curtis - Marbut Family Photo - Marbut Plot Stone Headstone\n\nDarla Marbut\n\nOnline Obit\n\nPhyllis Long\n\nPhotos\n\nBCG and HS MARBUT, Elisha Alexander Dec. 21, 1852\n\nBarry Co., MO July 15, 1936\n\nPurdy,\n\nMcDonald Twp.,\n\nBarry Co., MO SSW: Nancy E. - Research Note: He built the old Marbut Mill in 1875, located about 1/2 mile below Merle's Chapel.

Martin, collector of Barry Co., MO, is a native of Lancaster Co., OH, born in 1834. He is a son of Jonathan and Elizabeth (Martin) Martin. Jonathan Martin was born of English and Irish parents, in Monroe Co., MI, in 1808. His father, William Martin, was a native of Canada, and served in the Revolutionary War. When about 8 years of age, Jonathan Martin went with his parents to Lancaster Co., OH. He learned the saddler's trade in Detroit, MI, and in 1836 removed to Carroll Co., IN, locating at Camden, after which he laid out a portion of the town. He died in March 1857. His wife was born in Lancaster Co., OH in 1807. She was a daughter of William Martin, a native of Ireland. Mrs. Martin died in 1869. She was the mother of 8 children, five of whom she reared to maturity. Those living are Peninah E. (wife of Samuel M. Gordon), William L., Benjamin W. (a saddler, of Columbus, KS), and Henry T. (a photographer, of Topeka, KS). When his parents removed to IN, William L. was but two years of age, and his education was secured in that State. He worked as an apprentice at the saddler's trade in Lafayette, IN for 2 years, after which he worked as a journeyman in various States for three years. In 1858 he wedded Louise Lennon, a daughter of John Lennon, and a native of Carroll Co., born in 1836. To them have been born five children: Charles C. (general agent for the Home Insurance Co., with headquarter at Pierce City), Henry A. (an engineer on the Atlantic and Pacific Railway in Arizona), Florence L. (her father's deputy collector), William H. (a saddler, who now has charge of his father's shop in Cassville; he is a graduate of a commercial college of Topeka, KS), and a son, who died in infancy. After his marriage, Mr. Martin located in Camden, and began working at his trade on his own responsibility. In Jan. 1961, he abandoned his trade because of ill health, and purchased a tan yard, which he operated for the next five years. From 1866 till 1872 he was engaged in farming in Cherokee Co. KS. Thence he removed to Cassville, and for a few months was engaged in saw milling, at the end of which time he established a harness shop, with which he has since been connected. In 1880 he was elected by the Democratic party, treasurer of the county, and in 1886 was elected to his present position. He is not a candidate for re-election, and at the expiration of his present term will devote his entire attention to his trade.

The following clipping from the Kansas City Journal tells about the particulars of her death: Suspended from a curtain rod in a doorway by a piece of clothes line, the body of Mrs. Bland Bayless Martin, wife of William Pharis Martin, an insurance man, was found late yesterday afternoon by her husband when he returned to their home on the second floor of an apartment house at 1606 East Thirty Third street. The body was sent to the undertaking rooms of Freeman and Marshall by Dr. Harry Czarlinsky, coroner. The cause for the suicide is not known. Mrs. Charles C. Martin, mother-in-law of the unfortunate woman, said last night a sudden fit of insanity must have led the young wife to kill herself. \"She was at my home yesterday and several times complained of a pain in the back of her head,\" the elder Mrs. Martin said. \"I thought nothing of it at the time, but now I believe she may have suffered some temporary mental derangement. She and my son were happily married and was building a new home in Morning Side Park. I know of no cause for her to take her life. She was 27 years old.\" William Pharis Martin, 31 years old, has an office in the Waldheim building. It was his custom to telephone his wife just before he started home to supper. He did this about 5 o'clock yesterday but the call was unanswered. Thinking his wife had left their flat for a few moments, he went directly home. Entering his apartment and going into the dinning room he was startled to find his wife's body. Immediately he called for help. The woman was released from the cord. The frantic husband then endeavored to bring her back to life and would not leave the body until Coroner Czarlinsky told him there was no hope that Mrs. Martin could not be revived. Martin collapsed and was taken by friends to the home of his mother, 1004 Lindwood Boulevard. Mrs. Martin was formerly Miss Bland Bayless, daughter of the late J. M. Bayless, and was born and reared to womanhood in Cassville. The news of her death brought grief to her many friends and associates here. Her mother, Mrs. Mary Bayless of Claremore, Okla., who was at the time attending an aunt, Mrs. Charity Sooter, of near town, went to Kansas City, Friday night. Her body was shipped to Claremore where interment was made Sunday. Besides a mother and husband she is survived by one sister and five brothers. They are Mrs. Fanny Davis, Guy, Earl, Ross, Bourk and Wayne, all of Claremore. They have the deepest sympathy of many friends here in their bereavement. - Footstone TX Death Certificate\n\nOK Marriage Index\n\nMO Marriage Records\n\nObit\n\nPhyllis Long\n\nPhotos\n\nBCG and HS MASON, Hugh Dallas Apr. 3, 1895 1972 SSW: Lillian L. - Research Note: Photo of military stone at findagrave.com.

Son of Columbus R. Melton and Pearl West. A 24-year veteran of the Missouri State Senate, Emory was a well-known and respected member of the Barry County community who will be deeply missed. His wisdom, stories and legacy will live on for decades to come for the people who knew and loved him. He was a life-long resident of Barry County and served his community in countless ways over the years. His father served on the county commission as well as being elected its presiding judge. By the time he was seven, Emory decided he wanted to be a politician, and after getting the advice that politicians are usually lawyers, he decided that was what he was going to be. Emory attended school at a variety of one-room schoolhouses before going on to Verona High School where he graduated in 1940. Emory's work ethic was seen through his drive to finish his education, first high school, and then he went on to college. He worked his way through college at Monett Jr. College and Southwest Missouri State in Springfield. During his college time in Springfield, he delivered newspapers daily, morning and evening editions. After college, Emory hitchhiked his way to Columbia where he was admitted into the University of Missouri's law school. Sweeping floors, working the hospital's kitchen and sleeping in boiler rooms were part of Emory's journey to graduate with his law degree, which he did in December 1944. There were only two graduates that year, Emory Melton and Quentin Haden from Ava, Missouri. Then, in 1945, he was drafted into the United States Army. After completing basic training at Camp Robinson in Arkansas, he was sent to Texas where he went to the criminal investigation school. Emory took part in conducting investigations near Tokyo on everything from murder to espionage until he was discharged in 1946. After serving in the military, Emory moved back to Barry County where he married his wife, Jean Sanders Melton on June 19, 1949, in Shell Knob, Missouri. They also began two businesses: Litho Printers and the Barry County Advertiser, both of which are still in operation over fifty years later. Emory was also owner of the Crane Chronicle/Stone County Republican newspaper and an ownership partner in the Barry County Abstract Company and former owner of the Cassville Republican newspaper. The Meltons were married for 60 years before her death in March 2010. Emory practiced law in Barry County throughout his career. He became well-known and respected as an attorney, but also as a historian and friend to many. From 1947 to 1951 Emory served as the Barry County Prosecuting Attorney. From 1973 to January 1997, Emory served as the Missouri State Senator for the 29th District. During his time at the Capitol, he became known for his diligence to his position and the citizens he represented. While the pieces of legislation he sponsored during that time were few, he was well known for reading all bills considered by the Missouri Senate. The bills Emory did introduce were always for the public good and bypassed traditional partisan politics. While Emory was a well-respected attorney, politician and businessman, his love of history, particularly Barry County's history, was evidenced through all of the years he spent researching and recording county history. His hand penned two books, \"The First 150 Years in Cassville, Missouri\" and \"Hanged by the Neck Until Dead.\" Emory was a member of the First Baptist Church in Cassville, Lions Club of Cassville, a Masons member and many other civic and state organizations. He was a life long member and leader in the Republican party of Barry County and the State of Missouri. Emory was preceded in death by his wife, Jean, brother, Bill, sister, Amy, and son, Russell. - Photo of Emory Fohn Funeral Home\n\nPhyllis Long\n\nPhoto\n\nDiana Cope MELTON, Jean (SANDERS) Dec. 16, 1924\n\nShell Knob,\n\nBarry Co., MO Mar. 30, 2010\n\nCassville,\n\nBarry Co., MO SSW: Emory L. - Inscription: \"Married June 19, 1949\" - Research Note: Daughter of John Perry Sanders and Hattie (Blythe) Sanders.

C. Messer Dead: One of Barry County Prominent Citizens Passes Away. - M. C. Messer, for many years an influential public official and business man, quietly passed into the sleep which knows no waking at his home in Cassville at 1:50 o'clock on the morning of Thursday, April 11, 1912, from heart failure. Melville Caldwell Messer was 62 years, 6 months and 26 days old and was born at Blue Mound, Livingston County, MO, Sept. 16, 1850. When a small child his parents moved to Benton County, Arkansas where they lived until 1863 when they moved to Cassville. Cassville and vicinity has continued to be the family home since that time. The father and mother, James A. and Arabella Messer, having lived there until their deaths. He was married in 1883 to Miss Mary P. Bayless, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John A. Bayless northwest of Cassville. He is survived by his wife and four children, Mrs. Will Priest, Misses Blanche, Mabel and Maco Messer and a sister Miss Tina Messer. The funeral ceremony was held at the family residence Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock. A short and most appropriate sermon was delivered by Rev. James Lokey, pastor of the M. E. church, music by select quartet consisting of Mrs. C. C. Chandler, Mrs. J. L. Rawhouser, Ross Stuckey and Ernest Ferguson. Following the impressive service led by the pastor was the home funeral ceremony of the I.O.O.F. Lodge and the beautiful Masonic Ceremony at the cemetery. One hundred twenty two Odd Fellows and Mason marched in the funeral possession. Until about two years ago the deceased was enjoying the best of health and was an excellent specimen of physical manhood. Rheumatism made its appearance and the once strong manly form began to decline. Only temporary relief came and during the past few months a general decline became evident to this family and associations and deceased planned to sell his business and devote himself for a time to the regaining of his health. His devotion to this family and anxiety concerning their welfare, in view of his falling health caused him to decide to sell at once, and visit this summer at well known health resorts. These plans were about all arranged when suddenly death called him away. M. C. Messer was during his young manhood a teacher, having taught for several years in the public schools of the county. He served as postmaster in Cassville from 1889 to 1893. In 1898 he was elected county clerk and served one term of four years. For many years he was actively entered in public affairs and always discharged every duty with fidelity. He made a good record as a public official conducting the business of his office for the best interest of the people whom he served. He was engaged in the drug business in Cassville for a number of years and has also been engaged in the hardware and in the dry good business. The large concourse of people, one of the largest ever assembled at a funeral in Cassville among whom were citizens from nearly every part of the county, was a strong testimonial of the respect and esteem in which he was held as a citizen and as a man. For a number of years he had been a member of the M. E. Church and was a faithful church and Sunday school worker. He had for sometime been superintendent of the M. E. Sunday School. He was tenderly devoted to his family and to his sister who has made her home in the family. In his death the county and Cassville loses a good citizen and one who will be missed especially in Cassville where he has lived for so many years. - Messer Plot Stone Photos\n\nBCG and HS\n\nDeath Certificate\n\nDonna Cooper\n\nOnline Obit\n\nPhyllis Long MESSER, Mildred Eglentine Mar. 2, 1847\n\nBlue Mound, MO Dec. 27, 1931\n\nBarry Co., MO Research Note: Her death certificate reads that her father was James Messer, AL, and her mother Arabella Smith, born TN.
