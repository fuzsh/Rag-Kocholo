        "text": "Marlene E. Bowman, age 77, of Nelsonville, NY, died on Friday, June 5, 2015, at New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital in Cortlandt Manor. Born in Cortlandt Manor on May 10, 1938, she was the daughter of the late Anthony and Ethel (Scofield) Harbolic. Her husband Ronald Bowman predeceased her in 1990.\n\nMrs. Bowman was a retired Court Clerk for the Town of Philipstown, retiring in 2007 after 27 years of service. It was a career that she took great pride in, working alongside many members of law enforcement and the Putnam County Sheriff’s Department. She had fond memories of “her” Judges Stephen Tomann, Alan Steiner, Tom Scuccimarra and Michael Tighe — and Sheriff’s Detectives Al Villani and Gary Watkins. She was also a member of the Cold Spring Lions Club, the Red Hat Society, and the Philipstown Senior Citizens, of whom she was also a vocal supporter and advocate. Many will remember Mrs. Bowman alongside Judy Meyers, Greta Graham, Clerk Pauline Minners and the late Paula Gallagher — watching the polls at the Nelsonville Hall every March. She was also an avid NASCAR fan, and all of her family and friends knew that Sunday afternoons were reserved for watching Jeff Gordon — go #24! Marlene also enjoyed the company of her closest friends, whether it was sitting with Sandy Falloon somewhere in town for their Saturday morning coffee (she missed Pali’s greatly) or sitting on her back porch with Jan Sheridan, Bill Baxter, Gus Bukowski, Sara Savastano, Josephine Doherty, Tina and John Gilsenan.\n\nMrs. Bowman leaves behind her three sons Steven A. (spouse Lise) Bowman of Brookfield, CT, Gary M. (partner Scott Frazier) Bowman of Raleigh, NC, and Michael T. (spouse Donna) Bowman of Cold Spring; three sisters Joan (spouse Nick) Gaetano of Peekskill, Sandra (spouse Bruce) Duckwitz of Poughkeepsie and Karen (spouse Rudy) Kent of Palatine Bridge; two grandchildren Sophia and Alec; Sister in-law Beverly (spouse Joe) Stein of Boiceville, and many nieces and nephews. She was predeceased by her sisters Ethel (Babe) Robinson, Dorothy (Dot) Puff and Theresa Kirkwood.\n\nServices took place at the Clinton Funeral Home, Corner of Parrott and Pine Sts. (21 Parrott St.) Cold Spring, NY 10516 at 8 PM, Tuesday, June 9, 2015. A private cremation in the Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery will be followed by interment of her ashes in the Bowman plot in Cold Spring.\n\nFriends called at the Clinton Funeral Home, on Tuesday, June 9th from 2 to 4 and 7 to 8 PM. In lieu of flowers donations may be made in Mrs. Bowman’s name to the Philipstown Seniors c/o Treasurer Pinggera, 18 Upland Drive, Garrison NY 10524.\n\nFuneral arrangements were in the care of the Clinton Funeral Home, Cold Spring."
