Former Congressman Ron Marlenee died this past Sunday in Bozeman, MT.

Marlenee, 84, represented the eastern congressional district of Montana from 1977 to 1993. He was the Treasure State’s longest serving Republican Congressman.

A farmer and rancher from Scobey, Marlenee ran to represent the entire state when Montana lost one of its two congressionial districts as a result of the 1990 census. He lost that race to Montana’s western district Congressman.

Former staff members remembered him as an advocate for farmers, ranchers and small business owners. They said he spoke up for limited government, a balanced budget and Second Amendment rights, said an article in the Bozeman Daily Chronicle.

While serving in the United States House of Representatives, Marlenee was a member of the House Agriculture Committee and the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee (now the House Committee on Natural Resources.)

Marlenee was often considered an adversary to protectionist groups, but he was an avid outdoorsman, spending his free time hunting, fishing, skiing and camping.

“He was a multiple-use guy,” his son-in-law Peter Helland told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. “He is seen as an enemy of the environmentalists, but he was the first person I knew who recycled back in the 80s. He loved the outdoors.”

Following his congressional career, Marlenee became Safari Club International’s first official lobbyist. He took his love of hunting and the shooting sports back into the halls of Congress as an advocate, using his many connections with his former colleagues to advance SCI’s positions on conservation and hunting issues.

Ron, along with his wife Cindy, were true believers in SCI’s cause. Together they coordinated SCI lobby day, which continues to be a highlight of the May board meetings.

Marlenee is survived by his wife Cindy, son Casey and daughters Allison and Sheila, along with numerous grandchildren.
