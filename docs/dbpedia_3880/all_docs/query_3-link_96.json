        "text": "This post may contain affiliate links for books we recommend. Read the full disclosure here.\n\nWe each have our own preferred genres of choice. Kate loves horrors and thrillers, really anything that will keep her up at night! And Serena enjoys escaping through hidden doors into realms of magic and adventure. We also read mysteries, historical fiction, graphic novels, etc. etc. And that’s not even counting the multitude of sub-genres contained within each greater genre. In this series, one of us will present a list of our favorites from within a given sub-genre of one of our greater preferred genres.\n\nInterestingly enough, while I have decided to focus on the sub-genre of Folk Horror for this edition of ‘Diving Into Sub-Genres’, it’s a sub-genre that I tend to have complicated feelings about. That isn’t to say that I dislike folk horror; on the contrary, if I love a piece of folk horror, I REALLY love a piece of folk horror. The perfect example of this is the film “The Wicker Man”, one of the earlier examples in the sub-genre in which a Scottish policeman goes to the strange and pagan island of Summerisle in search of a missing girl, and finds a community of odd, quirky, and ultimately devious townsfolk who mess with the outsider before pulling one of the greatest twists in horror history. It’s one of my favorite horror films, and my Terror Tuesday friends and I have watched it about three times in our years of movies. There’s also “The Witch”, which brings a Puritan family to the unforgiving wilderness as a witch lurks in the woods tormenting them, though the bigger threat may be the way the family Others their daughter Thomasin. This is a favorite movie of mine, period. But for every “Wicker Man” and “The Witch” there are probably five or so “Midsommar”s, in which I find the final product lacking, underwhelming, or overly pretentious (sacrilege I know, but I really hated “Midsommar”). But it’s absolutely a sub-genre that has a lot of teeth and a lot of potential, so I wanted to highlight some of the stories within.\n\nFolk Horror is generally a kind of horror tale that involves an outsider finding themselves caught up in an unfamiliar place that has ties to folklore or ‘old ways’, and finds themselves in danger at the hands of the people or things they encounter. Superstition, ritualistic practices, nature and the dangers that come with it, and people with hidden motives are usually involved. And while there are occasionally some supernatural elements to be had, usually involving creatures from folklore and Pagan religions, it’s more likely the the threat is going to just be people in one way or another. In terms of books, one of the earlier examples is the novel “Harvest Home”, where a family movies into an isolated rural/agricultural community that adheres to some old timey superstitions about how to make their crops grow. The list I put together has some newer titles, and are mostly books that I’ve enjoyed. Or at least appreciated.\n\nBook: “The Twisted Ones” by T. Kingfisher\n\nI’m starting with a T. Kingfisher book because I really like the easy breezy and sometimes ‘cozy’ horror tone she brings to her novels, and that same tone comes with “The Twisted Ones”. When a woman named Mouse has to clean out her deceased grandmother’s cabin in the wooded wilderness in North Carolina, she thinks it will be a time consuming, but generally easy task. But she soon hears strange noises at night, and sees glimpses of odd beings through the corners of her eyes in the clearing around the cabin. And she soon finds diary entries her stepgrandfather left, describing strange and terrifying beings that stalk the woods, and a mysterious man named Ambrose. As Mouse starts to dig deeper into the mysteries and the strange things she’s encountering, she finds things that are beyond imagination. Kingfisher is always a fun read, and this one has some weird folksy scares to go along with her affable main character.\n\nBook: “The Ritual” by Adam Nevill\n\nThis one is a bit more of a straight up folk horror nightmare, and “The Ritual” had enough cinematic horror elements to it that it did get adapted into a film a few years ago, which I found to be fun and creepy as hell. It definitely solidified my fears of camping, I can tell you that much, and the book beforehand had a similar effect. Four old friends are hoping to reconnect their bond that time and shifting priorities has eroded away, and go for a camping trip in the north of Sweden, in a wooded area nestled in the Arctic Circle. When they start to get discombobulated and lost, tensions start to reach a new high. But it’s when they stumble upon an old seemingly abandoned house, which has odd altars, scattered bones, and Pagan symbols, they realize that they aren’t really alone in these woods. There’s a nice build of tension with this one, and some interesting modernization of outsiders meeting old world sensibilities.\n\nBook: “The Loney” by Andrew Michael Hurley\n\nFolk horror doesn’t always have to be in your face with its action and themes while still achieving an overarching sense of dread, and I think that “The Loney” is a good example of this BECAUSE of how quiet it is, until it has you in a stranglehold in the last few moments. This one was a bit of a slow read for awhile, but then when it sped up MAN did it speed up and create an atmopsheric Gothic oddity. In the 1970s a family consisting of a deeply Catholic mother and her two sons, one of whom is developmentally disabled, take a week long retreat to a remote seaside hamlet, with the mother hoping that fervent prayer and visitation to a local shrine can create a miracle to cure her son. During one of these trips, the younger brother Smith, our narrator, encounters a genial but odd group, consisting of some adults and a heavily pregnant teenage girl, as well as hostile locals who don’t adhere to the Catholic dogma that the visitors do. This one not only has the clash of new sensibilities vs old (though a bit subverted as Smith’s mother is VERY antagonistic in her faith), it also has a really twisted conclusion.\n\nBook: “The Hunger” by Alma Katsu\n\nFeel like combining some historical fiction in with your folk horror? Alma Katsu has you covered with her Donner Party horror story “The Hunger”. Because what could make an already true story about getting trapped in the wilderness in the dead of winter and resorting to cannibalism MORE horrifying? BRING IN SOME SUPERNATURAL TERRORS ALSO MAKING PROBLEMS. As the Donner Party moves west in hopes of finding a new life out west, they go on a bad route and get stuck in the Sierras right when winter is about to hit. As their survival becomes less and less likely and they have to start eating the dead to survive, something else and otherworldly is watching and waiting from the unforgiving wilderness. This folk horror trope is definitely along the lines of outsiders moving into an area unfamiliar to them and finding something terrible and unexpected, but it’s also an interesting meditation on the hubris of men, and the way that manifest destiny made settlers think that they were deserving of a new life, when in actuality they had NO idea what they were getting into.\n\nBook: “Pet Sematary” by Stephen King\n\nThis is probably the least obvious of folk horror novels on this list, but thinking about it really made me think about the broad swath that folk horror can reach. And “Pet Sematary” TOTALLY has folk horror elements! It follows the Creed family as they move into a new small town and new house near a forest, leaving big city life behind. When the family cat is hit by a car on the busy road, Dr. Louis Creed is led to a backwoods ‘pet cemetery’ by his neighbor Judd, who says that you can bury an animal there and it comes back to life… Though admittedly a little wrong. It works for the cat, though yes, it’s not the same cat it once was. And when horrific tragedy strikes the family, Louis decides to use the burial spot one more time out of desperation and grief. I’m sure you can imagine how it goes. This one is very much in the realm of ‘unrelenting mysteries and horrors of nature’ trope that is found in the sub-genre, as we don’t know WHY the ground can bring things back to life, or why they always come back wrong. It’s a terrifying story not only because of the reanimation, but also the ambiguity.\n\nBook: “Slewfoot” by Brom\n\nThis was a favorite read of mine from a couple years ago, and I still find myself going back and skimming through different parts of it. And MAN, does it really fit a folk horror mold, specifically if your kind of folk horror is very much “The Witch” (which, as we all know, is the case for me). After all, Puritans clashing with a supposedly malevolent force in the forest is always going to be up my alley, and in this book nature and forest spirts play a HUGE role in all of it. Abitha is a reluctant Puritan widow who is trying to keep her farm away from her vicious brother in law now that her husband has passed away. When she meets a strange demonic figure in the forest she calls Slewfoot, who has no memory of his past life but has guidance from forest spirits about his role as a vengeful being, they slowly grow a friendship as outsiders. And when the Puritans start to target Abitha, they don’t realize that messing with her is messing with him. I LOVE THIS BOOK, and it combines nature, zealousness, outsiders, and folklore to create a fantastic addition to this list.\n\nWhat folk horror novels are your favorites?

And Serena enjoys escaping through hidden doors into realms of magic and adventure. We also read mysteries, historical fiction, graphic novels, etc. etc. And that’s not even counting the multitude of sub-genres contained within each greater genre. In this series, one of us will present a list of our favorites from within a given sub-genre of one of our greater preferred genres.\n\nThe canny reader might do a double-take when seeing this post. “Wait, didn’t these guys already do a ‘Sub-Genres’ post focused on vampires?” Well, tricky tricky, yes and no! Kate featured Vampire Horror as one of her picks a few years ago, but vampires are such a popular supernatural being that they make their way across all sorts of genres, including tons of fantasy, so here we are!\n\nWhen attempting to differentiate between horror and fantasy vampires, I think its important to consider the overall tone and objective of the story. Is it meant to inspire fear as its primary goal, create and build tension and dread? Or are the vampires more incidental to story more focused on its fantasy or romance elements? What themes is the book exploring and how well do they align with the themes generally found in fantasy vs. horror? Beyond this, how exactly are the vampires themselves presented and what roles are they playing in the story?\n\nWhile the horrific side of vampires is obvious, the fantasy side often takes on a few different dimensions. Yes, they are “fantasy creatures” like werewolves or ghosts, both of which show up in horror, the latter all the time! But sometimes these creatures stray outside the realm of serving as points of fear, horror, dread, and overt warning to society about various ills or tendencies. Instead, they become the heroes themselves, or, in the case of vampires, more often than not, love interests! It’s pretty easy to see why this latter is the case. The act of drinking another’s blood is clearly intimate, wrapping two beings up in one another about as closely as one can be. And, obviously, it’s one, albeit big and rather horrific, step away from kissing.\n\nBut vampires also pop up as the leading characters themselves, often exploring themes regarding isolation, estrangement, and the act of violence for survival. There is also an entire subgenre of paranormal fantasy fiction and urban fantasy that always seems to include societies made up of various supernatural communities all co-existing, and vampires (and often werewolves as their natural enemies) are almost always an included group. They have tons of lore and are an easy group of characters to slot into a story who can serve as both menaces as well as powerful allies.\n\nRecently, we’ve seen a resurgence of vampires popping up in all sorts of fantasy stories. Romantasy, of course, is an easy place to spot this, but vampires have also been showing up more and more in adult and YA fantasies. A few examples include a “Tempest of Tea,” “A Multitude of Dreams,” and “Masters of Death.” Obviously, there are tons of books out there, and I’d argue that “Interview with a Vampire” and the other books in that series which Kate included in her list could also be included here. But I tried to cover a variety of examples in this list of how vampires have been used in fantasy fiction.\n\nBook: “Twilight” by Stephenie Meyer\n\nLet’s just get this one out of the way, as it’s probably one of the first books to come to most people’s minds when they think of vampires in fantasy stories. And it also likely holds the strange position of being both one of the most massively popular vampire stories out there and the reason that we’re only now, around fifteen years later, finally seeing vampires show up again in YA fiction. It was beloved, and then it became such a joke that I think YA publisher were immediately binning any pitches that even hinted at vampires. But it still deserves its spot on this for the massive popularity at the time! Meyer definitely brought her own version of vampires to the world, and if it’s one that is largely laughed out now, there’s no denying the success of this series. We also see in this series both vampires as a romantic interest as well as Bella’s own experiences as a vampire herself. Would I recommend this series nowadays to readers looking for vampire stories? No. But, again, you can’t honestly create a list like this and not include this book, so there ya go!\n\nBook: “Certain Dark Things” by Silvia Moreno-Garcia\n\nSilvia Moreno-Garcia is one of those authors who perfectly straddles the line between fantasy and horror, with many of her books teetering right on the edge where they could fall easily into either category. But “Certain Dark Things,” while definitely creepy at times, very much also reads like an urban fantasy at its finest. One of the main characters, Atl, is a vampire who is on-the-run from a rival vampire gang, and over the course of the book she befriends a street kid named Domingo. This book has some of the more creative and interesting versions (yes, plural!) of vampires that I can ever remember reading! And Moreno-Garcia does an excellent job of weaving this lore throughout the story while also exploring the history of Mexico and telling a fast-paced, dangerous story of an unlikely friendship. It’s definitely one to check out if you’re looking for a fresh take on vampires.\n\nBook: “A Discovery of Witches” by Deborah Harness\n\nWhile I personally didn’t love this story (I struggled with a few of the early aspects of the romance), it’s a massively popular series and a nice example of a fantasy story that includes a world peopled by a variety of supernatural beings. The main character is a descendent from a long line of witches (shocker, I know, given the title!) and during her research at Oxford, she strays across an ancient manuscript that opens up an whole can of worms with many different groups all fighting for access, including a mysterious vampire. This trilogy is several years old at this point, but I think it’s probably due for a resurgence of interest given the popularity of “dark academia” currently, a sub-genre that this would definitely fall in as well.\n\nBook: “Bride” by Ali Hazelwood\n\nThis is a very recent addition to the subgenre, but I think it’s important to include for one very unique reason: it’s a romance, but the woman is the vampire instead of the male love interest! There are four books on this list that include prominent romances, and in three out of the four, it’s the man who is the vampire. And even there, I think this 75% mark is probably low for the average of male vs. female as vampires in romance. So yes, “Bride” stands out in that it is told from the POV of Misery, a vampire, who finds herself in an arranged marriage with the leader of her people’s mortal enemies, the werewolves. This is another staple of urban fantasies in general, the vampires vs. werewolves mythology. This book follows that typical script fairly closely, but the romance at its heart is clearly the priority of the book, and it was fun reading a story like this from the perspective of a female vampire, rather than the other way around.\n\nBook: “The Historian” by Elizabeth Kostova\n\nI would say that the primary genre for this one would be historical fiction, with either “horror” or “fantasy” coming second, as the vampires are very much in the background of much of the book. Instead, most of the story follows characters as they travel across Europe trying to piece together the mystery of Vlad the Impaler (the real-world ruler who is said to be the inspiration for Dracula). I absolutely love this book. It’s one that I read years and years ago now, but that always comes to mind when people are looking for recommendations. It’s the kind of story that I feel like almost any kind of reader will enjoy in some way!\n\nBook: “The Serpent and the Wings of Night” by Carissa Broadbent\n\nMost of the books on this list exist in our real world (with some obvious magical additions!), but this book serves as a great example of a secondary world vampire story! The society that makes up this world is comprised of two different sects of vampires with the relatively powerless human species caught between them. It’s a romantasy story, however, that follows one such human woman’s attempts to gain some power in a world set against her. And, of course, the vampire she falls in love with along the way! This one really took me by surprise with how much I enjoyed it! It’s a great example of a romantasy book that doesn’t skimp on the world-building and fantasy elements of the story, while still have a great love story at its heart.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite historical thrillers?

In this series, one of us will present a list of our favorites from within a given sub-genre of one of our greater preferred genres.\n\nAs I was going back through my previous “Diving Into Sub-genres” posts, it occurred to me that I hadn’t yet posted any Thriller lists. And when I tried to unpack that reality, I kind of realized that I felt a bit daunted trying to disentangle the ins and outs of the sub-genres of thrillers because I tend to focus so much on very specific sub-genres without branching out too much. You are far more likely to find me deep into psychological thrillers, but spy thrillers? Legal thrillers? Military thrillers? Religious thrillers? Not so much! But I did realize that I have gone past psychological thrillers and have also really enjoyed historical thrillers. Which isn’t REALLY surprising because I do love historical fiction! Therefore it’s no shock that I love a historical story with thriller elements.\n\nHistorical thrillers are pretty straightforward, definition wise. They are thrillers (of any type really) that take place in a historical setting. Usually the time and place is imperative to the plot and the circumstances, and the action within has to exist within that vacuum (though, admittedly, a couple of my choices are going to be a little loosey goosey with that concept). This list is a collection of some that I’ve really enjoyed, as well as what I want to be a varied swath of different time periods and sometimes cultures that serve as a backdrop to the thrillers at hand.\n\nBook: “11/22/63” by Stephen King\n\nAlready with the loosey goosey titles, as this Stephen King story is also very much a Sci-Fi tale with the time travel elements. But the overall meat of the story is very much a historical thriller, as a man from the early 21st Century is sent back to the middle of the 20th to try and stop the Kennedy Assassination. Jake Epping is a high school teacher who stumbles upon the opportunity to go back in time to prevent President Kennedy from being assassinated. Starting years before the murder, Jake plants himself as a regular man from the time, trying to keep tabs on Lee Harvey Oswald and trying to find a way to stop the tragedy, and perhaps others as well. But while he is there, he meets soft spoken and kind school teacher Sadie, and falls in love with her, revealing much of his heart… but also putting his original mission in danger. Stephen King creates a highly suspenseful thriller involving secrets, espionage, love, and the hope for a better reality, while examining not only the culture of 1950s and 1960s America, but also how time travel could potentially interact with this world.\n\nBook: “Velvet Was the Night” by Silvia Moreno-Garcia\n\nWe have sang the praises of Silvia Moreno-Garcia on this blog many times, and we have reviewed nearly all of her works, including “Velvet is the Night”. I put this one on the list because of the way that Moreno-Garcia explores the corruption, dangers, and shades of idealism of 1970s Mexico City. Maite is a receptionist who has romanticized ideas of love thanks to her love of pulp novels. When she finds herself entangled in the case of a missing acquaintance named Leonora, she is suddenly swept up in a world of gangsters, missing activists, and a petty criminal named Elvis who loves rock and roll and is assigned to seek Maite out before she finds out too much about Leonora. Moreno-Garcia once again brings out her talent for complex characters and well conceived settings, with the suspense running high as Maite and Elvis set on a crash course for danger.\n\nBook: “Mademoiselle Revolution” by Zoe Sivak\n\nThe French Revolution has always had a certain allure about it, with rolling heads and promises of societal upheaval, ultimately leading to a brutal Empire led by Napoleon Bonaparte. But what I love about Zoe Sivak’s “Mademoiselle Revolution” is that she tells the story from the eyes of a formally upper class Black woman from Haiti who escaped the Haitian revolution only to find herself in the midst of Robespierre’s. Sylvie, the biracial daughter of a white plantation owner, escapes to Paris after most of her family is killed during the Haitian Revolution. Feeling guilty for her complacency in her former home’s racist structures, she is immediately taken with charismatic Robespierre, who speaks of revolution in France. At first Sylvie is swept up in the idealism. But then things start to spiral out of control. I love Sylvie as a character and how she fits into actual historical events and social circles, and I love how Sivak frames it all through the eyes of a Black woman.\n\nBook: “From Hell” by Alan Moore\n\nI know that he’s a bit of a controversial figure in comics and graphic novels, but I really love Alan Moore. I find so many of his works absolutely phenomenal, but one that really stands out for me is “From Hell”, his graphic novel about the Jack the Ripper Whitechapel Murders and the failed investigation that came after (perhaps because of a royal conspiracy). While the investigation is the main plot, Moore takes it to interesting heights by making the focus not on who Jack the Ripper was (his identity in this is clear almost from the start), but on how a culture that is driven by violence, corruption, and misogyny, all to keep a Royal Family scandal under wraps, is just as complicit in the deaths as the murderer himself. I love how dark and enigmatic this book is, and how it gathers so much from years and years of Ripperology (yes that’s a thing) to create a narrative that indicts Victorian England as a whole.\n\nBook: “The Red Palace” by June Hur\n\nNow we switch things up a whole lot, and travel to 17th Century Korea, seeking out a murder mystery involving a palace nurse, an intrepid police inspector, and a potentially violent prince. And to make it all the more interesting, June Hur’s “The Red Palae” is partially inspired by a true story from this time period in Korea (back then known as Joseon). Hyeon is an illegitimate teenage girl, and has few options because of this, so when she has the opportunity to become a palace nurse she takes it. But then her mentor is accused of murdering four women in one night, she has to team up with police inspector Eojin, who is also determined to find the real killer. The problem? Their investigations point towards the crown prince himself as the culprit. This is a setting I haven’t seen as much in historical thrillers, and I really love how June Hur captures the time and the people to create a riveting story of political intrigue and danger.\n\nBook: “The Lost Apothecary” by Sarah Penner\n\nAnd we have our other loosey goosey title with Sarah Penner’s “The Lost Apothecary”, as it has dual timelines between the present day and the 18th century in Londan, England. In the present, Caroline is visiting London on what should have been an anniversary trip, but became a solo vacation when she discovered her husband was cheating on her. While exploring the city she stumbles upon a mysterious vial, her interest in researching its origins is piqued. Little does she know at first that it’s connected to a string of murders in the late 1700s, as a woman named Nella had a back alleys apothecary where she would sell herbs, remedies…. as well as poisons to help women be rid of violent men whom they couldn’t escape otherwise. I loved the dual timelines of this story as Caroline searches for answers, and as Nella hopes to stay hidden, and how it draws parallels between life back then and life now.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite historical thrillers?

In this series, one of us will present a list of our favorites from within a given sub-genre of one of our greater preferred genres.\n\nThere is a “military” sub-genre of most larger genres. I might go as far as covering military fantasy novels in one of these posts in the future. It’s simple enough to see why this would be the case. Military science fiction, like the other military sub-genres, often includes books that are very action-packed, can take place on a grand scale with large battle scenes or focus down to the individual experiences of soldiers, and often tackle very complex moral issues of right and wrong, offense and defense, and the immense cost of warfare in general. Some will glorify battle. Others will strongly critique it.\n\nOften readers of military science fiction are looking for another way to look at human nature and human history. Through the lens of an imaginary science fiction landscape, it’s possible to relitigate and re-explore the events of our own past across a theoretical future conflict. By doing this, authors avoid getting bogged down into the facts (or debated facts) of our own history, while still getting at the meat of the issue behind some of the motivations in our own historical wars.\n\nOn a character level, many readers of military science fiction are also interested in the various arcs and emotional pathways that those involved heavily in battle face. Obviously, this is hugely relevant to any/all readers who have their own connections to or are current soldiers or veterans. Themes such as grief, brother/sisterhood, honor, regret, PTSD, bravery and many more can be covered in grand, narrative fashion.\n\nOther stories are more focused on the larger movements and conflicts of nations, entire species (humanity vs. some alien group), and the tactical decisions that go on in these large scale battle scenes. There can be detailed depictions regarding movements of space fleets, the inner workings of deciding which conflicts to engage in and which to avoid, etc. And, of course, this being science fiction, these will often include lots of future technology, from the ships and weapons used, to various biotronic enhancements and the like to the human soldiers.\n\nI’ve tried to include a broad range of military science fiction that includes both the types of books that focus more on the character’s story and the types that go into more depth with grand scale battles.\n\nBook: “Ender’s Game” by Orson Scott Card\n\n“Ender’s Game” straddles both the “soldier focused” and the “battle focused” sides of military science fiction. The story follow a young boy, Ender, a military genius who is essentially forcibly recruited and very soon burdened with the task of essentially saving the world through his tactical brilliance. Much of the story follows his own journey through this type of pressure while also exploring the terrible decisions the adults around him are in the process of making. Throughout the book, we see Ender’s own journey as well as many larger battles, both in the military school where he is trained and later in his role as a commander. The book also introduces a lot of complicated themes regarding responsibility, what makes an enemy, and the role of the individual in a greater war.\n\nBook: “Ancillary Justice” by Ann Leckie\n\nI also featured this book in my space opera list. Like most sub-genres, military science fiction can quite easily weave in and out of and blend in alongside other sub-genres of the larger science fiction genre as a whole. Books like this one fit neatly into both categories. It has the grand, wide-spanning storyline that is often found in space operas, but it also has a main character who is the AI system of a massive warship, now placed in the limited body of a human. As such, the story has a lot to say about the role of leadership, sisterhood, and the way that an individual experiences the broader impacts of war. There are also a lot of really cool space battles, especially in the flashbacks to when the main character was still embodied in the actual ship.\n\nBook: “Old Man’s War” by Jon Scalzi\n\nKate and I both read this one a year or so ago for bookclub. And it’s an obvious pick for this list, following the story of a man who, through technological advances, joins in humanity’s ongoing intergalactic war at the advanced age of 80. So with that premise, of course the book has a lot to say on the way that one would approach a life as a soldier after already living a full life before, how the outlook of age could affect one’s choices and beliefs. The book also tackles larger themes of colonialization and pre-emptive warfare. Beyond that, Scalzi is just a fun writer, so the numerous battle scenes are action-packed and a fun read, even if still gruesome at times.\n\nBook: “Sassinak” by Anne McCaffrey/Elizabeth Moon\n\nWhile Anne McCaffery is better know for her fantasy/science fiction involving dragons, Elizabeth Moon is a powerhouse of military fiction. Not only that, she comes from a military background herself, having served in the United States Marines as a lieutenant. So, here we have a book written by two incredible women that also follows the story of a woman who escapes to become a Fleet Captain who then chases down pirates across the universe. This is definitely a character-driven story, following Sassy’s exploits through several mini stories that make up the book. And as it’s a shorter book on the hole, this can lead to perhaps a bit of a disjointed read. But I still think it well earns its place on this list, especially the first half of the story that established the main character as an incredibly empathetic and clever individual.\n\nBook: “All You Need is Kill” by Hiroshi Sakurazaka\n\nMany of you will be more familiar with this story by the name of the movie adaptation helmed by Tom Cruise, “Edge of Tomorrow.” Unlike the other books featured on this list so far, this one takes place on Earth as humanity attempts to save itself from invasion. The story follows a soldier who inexplicably finds himself reliving the same battle over and over again, dying only to start the day and fight once again. It’s like a grim version of “Groundhog’s Day.” There’s an instant appeal to the premise itself, but the close look at how the same day can play out in so many ways really emphasizes the chaos of warfare.\n\nBook: “All Systems Red” by Martha Wells\n\nLike “Ancillary Justice,” the protagonist of this book isn’t exactly…human. Instead, this book and the ongoing series follows the exploits of Murderbot, a security bot that is part of a larger Company that essentially controls the galaxy. As such, this book isn’t the classic military fiction with its focus on warfare and soldiers, but its focus on a security bot grappling with large, existential questions regarding violence and its role in conflict makes it a perfect pick to round out the variety of fiction that can be found within this subgenre.\n\nWhat military science fiction books have you enjoyed?

In this series, one of us will present a list of our favorites from within a given sub-genre of one of our greater preferred genres.\n\nI could probably just call this “Cult Escape Memoirs”, though I think some people would come after me were I to refer to some of these groups as ‘cults’. That and some are less about groups and more about toxic family dynamics which are run like a cult, but aren’t technically cults. So High Control Group it is! I’ve always been super fascinated by groups that close ranks, isolate members, put leaders on a firm pedestal, and build and build up abuses and corruption and use intimidation, coercion, and violence against those within, and all the brainwashing that comes with it. I also love harrowing memoirs of people who have been a part of such groups, and how they ultimately break away no matter the personal cost and sacrifice (and it is usually a lot).\n\nThere are a lot of different cults and high control groups that have functioned over the years, so this is merely a smattering of the various groups. But all of the stories are harrowing, enraging, heartbreaking, and hopeful, and it shows the resilience of those who have escaped when they never should have had to go through their trauma in the first place. These are all admittedly difficult reads with lots of content warnings, but I’ve found them to be fascinating and engaging reads.\n\nBook: “A Billion Years: My Escape From A Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology” by Mike Rinder\n\nScientology has been pretty heavily scrutinized in the past decade or so, and a lot of voices leading the way are those who jumped ship and lost so, so much by doing so. Leah Remini is a very clear example of this, but her celebrity insulated her a bit from the fallout, which is why I decided on “A Billion Years” by Mike Rinder. Rinder used to be a very high ranking member under L. Ron Hubbard, but once Hubbard died and David Miscavige took over, the toxicity and abuse ramped up to the point where Rinder no longer felt he could stay. Leaving his family behind (they are still alienated from him) and everything he knew, he is now a whistleblower and a very outspoken critic. This memoir is a really good look at his time in the organization, and gives insight as to what it’s like for those inside who aren’t powerful celebrities. I really love that Rinder is trying to repent for his past complicity, and this memoir is honest and very harrowing.\n\nBook: “Unspeakable: Surviving My Childhood and Finding My Voice” by Jessica Willis Fisher\n\nThis is the first of two memoirs that isn’t about a specific larger group, but more about the influence of an extremist fundamentalist family and its leader, and this one is a really, really hard read (it’s actually the read that gave me the idea for this list). Jessica Willis Fisher was initially known as the oldest of the Willis Clan, a Fundamentalist Christian family that performed in a band together and had its own reality show following their lives. What viewers and fans didn’t know was that the patriarch, Toby, was verbally, physically, and sexually abusive to his wife and children, Jessica herself one of his rape victims and ultimately the family scapegoat. Her memoir speaks to her childhood, her relationships with her family members, her love of music, and how she eventually started to push back against her father, and how that cut her off from her siblings and mother, but also pushed her towards people who did support her and help her come to terms with her traumatic childhood, and help her eventually turn her father in. Willis Fisher is so incredibly brave, her memoir so well written, and it has hope in darkness and love and empathy.\n\nBook: “Breaking Free: How I Escaped Polygamy, the FLDS Cult, and My Father, Warren Jeffs” by Rachel Jeffs\n\nI have read so many books about the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints as run by Warren Jeffs/Rulon Jeffs and the compound in Short Creek, but if I had to pick one that encompasses the horrors of the compound and the abuses of the people who lived there, I would go with Rachel Jeffs’s memoir. They are all harrowing, but Rachel is one of Warren Jeffs’s many children, and her experience shows that his sadistic abuses and violence towards others was also very much a part of his family life as opposed to the non-related members of the community. Rachel is brutally honest about the things that she went through, and it gives a deeply personal connection to the Warren Jeffs years of the FLDS. It’s also a good look into the FLDS culture as a whole, and doesn’t mince words about how abusive, violent, and oppressive it is for those who live in it, especially the women. And it’s especially disturbing seeing how Jeffs treated his own children, his abuses and cruelty being doled out to them as much as it was to others in the community. Rachel is incredibly brave for getting out, and I’m glad she was able to push back in her own words.\n\nBook: “In The Shadow of the Moons: My Life in the Reverend Sun Sun Myung Moon’s Family” by Nansook Hong\n\nOf all the cults and high control groups that have fascinated me over the years, I actually didn’t know much about the Unification Church, a religious cult based in South Korea run by Sun Myung Moon. This memoir was written by his daughter in law Nansook Hong, whose marriage to his oldest son was wrought with discord and abuse. The Moonies, as they are known, present themselves as an ideal group of Divine Christianity, and Moon himself placed himself as a messiah-like figure and hoped to have influence across countries and political positions and leaders. But this memoir exposes the hypocrisy and corruption within the group and how Moon abused his power, and hid the violence and troubles within his own family. After years in an unhappy marriage that had abuse and addiction issues, Hong escaped one of the Moonie compounds and divorced Hyo Jin Moon, the eldest and heir apparent to the Unification Church. The Moonies kind of go under the radar these days when it comes to cults and high control groups, and this memoir has some really interesting context and has the story of a brave woman who left.\n\nBook: “Member of the Family: My Story of Charles Manson, Life Inside His Cult, and the Darkness That Ended the Sixties” by Dianne Lake\n\nThere are so many notorious cults out there, but the Manson Family is the one that really shattered the American consciousness in the late 1960s when they carried about the multiple murders of Sharon Tate and her guests, as well of those of the LaBianca Family. While many of Manson’s ‘girls’ are remembered because of the huge court case (or in Squeaky Fromme’s case, when she tried to assassinate President Ford because that would help Charlie, somehow?), Dianne Lake was one of the few that got out, though not unscathed. Lake joined up as a teenager after her family went all in on a nomadic lifestyle, and pretty much just let her go off with Manson and his group, and soon she as deeply under his spell and living on Spahn Ranch. This memoir is about that time, as well as the childhood that led up to it, and then when she turned against him and the others after the Tate/LaBianca murders. I really like this one because it doesn’t only show how a group can manipulate and control vulnerable people, but how people end up in groups like that in the first place if they were not born into it.\n\nBook: “Educated” by Tara Westover\n\nMuch like “Unspeakable”, “Educated” is less about a specific group and more about a family that has been overtaken by a zealous patriarch that imposes fundamentalist rules and abuses on his loved ones. But “Educated” is such an amazing book that I really wanted to have it here. Tara Westover grew up in an isolated, off the grid existence with her family, her father forbidding any contact with public education or healthcare and her mother working as an herbalist and midwife to other off the grid people. As Tara gets older, she finds herself wanting to learn and read anything she can get her hands on, and wonders what else is out there to learn beyond her family’s grip. And when one of her brothers becomes more and more violent, and Tara becomes the target of his escalating violence, her yearning to get into the world isn’t just about wanting to learn, but wanting to save herself from a dangerous and isolated family situation. This memoir very well written, incredibly inspirational, and there is a reason it was so well received when it came out.\n\nWhat escape memoirs have you enjoyed?

Read the full disclosure here.\n\nWe each have our own preferred genres of choice. Kate loves horrors and thrillers, really anything that will keep her up at night! And Serena enjoys escaping through hidden doors into realms of magic and adventure. We also read mysteries, historical fiction, graphic novels, etc. etc. And that’s not even counting the multitude of sub-genres contained within each greater genre. In this series, one of us will present a list of our favorites from within a given sub-genre of one of our greater preferred genres.\n\nPortal family is probably the largest and most popular sub-genre in fantasy fiction. I know that second part is a pretty hefty claim, but even among the most picky of fantasy readers, those who hardly ever read the genre as a whole, there’s a decent chance they hold a special place for some portal fantasy novel or another. It’s unavoidable when some of the biggest titles in fantasy fiction fall under this subgenre; even more so when many of those titles (“Harry Potter,” “The Wizard of Oz”) are also children’s and middle grade fiction, works that many readers will enjoy as kids even if they go on as adults to read very little in the fantasy genre as a whole.\n\nPortal fantasy is also a wide, sprawling sub-genre on its own. It’s definition is simple: it’s a story that involves characters travelling through a “portal” (wardrobe/train platform/tornado/etc.) from our real world into some magical, fantasy realm. Already you can see the huge potential and likely list off a good number of titles that would fall under this category. What’s more, a broad interpretation of this subgenre would just be characters travelling from world to world, none of which need include our real world. For example, the “His Dark Materials” trilogy utilizes both of these options. We have characters travelling from our world to new worlds, like Will in the second book, “The Subtle Knife.” But there are also several characters, like Lord Asriel, who never travel to “our world” at all, but only between different, unique worlds.\n\nThe definition of “portal” can also vary. Some would say there needs to be an actual passage way from one distinct world to another unique world; others would count the Daevabad trilogy as a portal fantasy, simply due to the hidden nature of the city itself, unseen and inaccessible by humanity. Portal fantasy is also one of the oldest subgenres of fantasy. Some of Shakespeare’s plays would likely count (“A Midsummer Night’s Dream”) and, of course, there is Mark Twain’s “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court.” Between all of these definitions, and the fact that portal fantasy is a popular subgenre in fantasy fiction for all ages (probably the most popular by far in children’s fantasy), there are a million options to choose from, but here are a few that I particularly enjoy and I think represent the subgenre well.\n\n“The Chronicles of Narnia” by C. S. Lewis\n\nThis is probably one of the first books/series that comes to most people’s minds when they think of “portal fantasy.” Not only is it a supremely popular children’s series, but the portal itself holds much of its appeal simply by how ubiquitous it is: what child hasn’t crawled into a closet or wardrobe and wished there was a door way to another world to be found at the end? The titular wardrobe in the first book, “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe” is the most well-known of the portals found in this story. But if you continue reading, you’ll also find children swept away through a painting and simply by the winds felt on a cliffside.\n\n“Wayward Children” series by Seanan McGuire\n\nSeanan McGuire has created a series that not only features portal fantasies as the primary premise of all of her books, but each book does a deep dive into the types of people who walk through these magical doors. The types of people who look for them, and those who don’t. And she paints a world that holds so many doorways to so many unique worlds that she’s even made a sort of flowchart to diagram the sorts of worlds her characters may come from and travel to. Where does each world fall on a scale of chaos or order? Good or evil? These novellas are all incredibly unique and highlight a lot of the appeal that the portal fantasy subgenre holds for the many readers who enjoy it and wish they, too, could find their door to another world.\n\n“The Fionavar Tapestry” series by Guy Gavriel Kay\n\nThis is one of the first adult portal fantasy series that I remember reading as a teenager. Up to that point, for me, portal fantasy was something found in children’s and young adult fiction, but not so much in the stuffy works that made up adult fantasy. The story follows five men and women who find themselves pulled into a fantasy world where they each have important roles to play. And this is definitely adult portal fantasy all around, as Kay dives into some pretty dark themes throughout the series. I remember really enjoying it, but also being rather shocked as a teenage reader by certain scenes. It’s one of those fantasy series that has stuck with me throughout the years, but also one that I need to return to soon as I haven’t ever re-read it.\n\n“The Invisible Library” by Genevieve Cogman\n\nThis eight book long series wrapped up recently, back in 2021 and was massively popular during its run. It’s a fairly standard portal fantasy, with its main character, Irene, travelling from realm to realm in her work for a Library that collects fiction from these various worlds. Throughout the series she gathers a group of friends around her and encounters all sorts of wild worlds, including time travel. These are really lovely books, all the more appealing for featuring a heroic librarian as their heroine!\n\n“In Other Lands” by Sarah Rees Brennan\n\nThis is another fairly straight-forward portal fantasy, but its quirky take on not only the the magical world and the beings that populate it but on its protagonist make it stand out as a great, modern story. The word “deconstruction” has been used when describing this book’s take on its central trope, but it does so in an interesting and hilarious way, rather than the usual, more pretentious sort of deconstruction. The hero is also a young teenage boy who is just as snotty and irreverent as you’d expect from a boy of that age. And yet you can’t help rooting for him anyway!\n\n“Shades of Magic” trilogy by V.E. Schwab\n\nLastly, I’m including one of my favorite portal fantasies of all time. This is also a nice mixture of the two definitions of portal fantasy in that one of our main characters travels in the traditional direction (from our world and into a magical one), but our other main character is from the magical world and travels not only to our world, but also to other, unique worlds beyond. This trilogy not only has unique worlds (varying Londons each with different levels of magic), but I really enjoyed the way the magic system and travel between these works worked. Fans of portal fantasies should definitely check this trilogy out if you haven’t already!\n\nWhat portal fantasy books are your favorites?

In this series, one of us with present a list of our favorites from within a given sub-genre of one of our greater preferred genres.\n\nHalloween is nearly upon us, readers, and while I am still full blown into Halloween mode, I’m also acknowledging that the season is going to end in a little more than a week and I am going to be sad (until I buck up and shift into Winter Holiday gear). So for this new “Diving Into Sub-Genres” post, though I usually switch up my genres that house said sub-genres, I’m sticking to horror, and I am going to focus on one of my favorites: witch horror! You all know how much I love witches of ALL stripes, and while I adore empowering and feminist spellcasters I also love vengeful crones who want to make others suffer. I’m very inclusive when it comes to my witches.\n\nWitch horror can be traced as far back as Greek Mythology when Circe was turning Odysseus’s crew into pigs, or Medea was casting spells and killing her children to get back at Jason for daring leave her. You have a number of witches in fairytales as well, from Snow White’s stepmother to the witch who tried to eat Hansel and Gretel. And lord knows in real life a fear of witches led to a lot of violence and suffering because of a religious based mythology and superstition (the targets usually being women, outsiders, and other Others). Yes, witches have had their place as horror icons for millennia, and now I’m going to share some of my favorite witch tales that, I think, represent the sub-genre of witch horror pretty well.\n\nNow here is a caveat: I’m really going to focus on horror when it comes to witch stories on this list. Even though there are SO MANY AWESOME NON HORROR WITCH BOOKS OUT THERE. But I want to be stringent in the sub-genre definitions, and witch horror is different from witch fantasy or witch historical fiction or what have you. Because I struggled with this decision, I am going to briefly list a few titles that aren’t horror but are still fantastic witch or witch related books that you can also give a go before All Hallow’s Eve next week if you aren’t looking for scares: “Cackle” by Rachel Harrison; “Practical Magic” by Alice Hoffman; “The Witch of Blackbird Pond” by Elizabeth George Speare; “Akata Witch” by Nnedi Okorafor; “Cemetary Boys” by Aiden Thomas; and “Hour of the Witch” by Chris Bohjalian.\n\nBook: “The Witching Hour” by Anne Rice\n\nWanting to start with a classic, but not a classic that goes super far back into centuries and centuries, it seemed that Anne Rice’s “The Witching Hour” was a pretty good jumping off point. This book starts off her “Mayfair Witches” series, which follows a New Orleans witch family that has passed magic, and a pretty bad curse, down through the generations. When Rowan Mayfair pulls a drowned man out of the ocean and brings him back to life, she has to face the fact that she has strange powers, powers that her family has had and that she has tried to suppress. But what Rowan doesn’t know is that there is also a mysterious and dangerous spirit that has haunted the Mayfair Family. Known as Lasher, he wishes to possess the Mayfairs, and he now has his sights set on Rowan. This book follows a line of witches and spans over centuries, and brings Rice’s alluring yet horrific aesthetic to witch horror.\n\nBook: “Hex” by Thomas Olde Heuvelt\n\nAlso known as the witch book that scared the ever loving piss out of me, “Hex” is definitely a ‘vengeful witch’ story that is horrifying and filled with dread until the very last page is turned. The first chapter had me saying ‘what the HELL IS GOING ON?’ for basically the entire length, and I can tell you that this was a common occurrence through this book. Black Spring is a sleepy small town in the Hudson River Valley, where people live and raise their families. But it is haunted by the ever wandering Black Rock Witch, whose eyes and mouth have been sewn shut after her execution during Puritan times led to her curse upon the town. The town keeps total surveillance on the wandering witch, and has kept her a secret from the outside world. But then a group of local teens decide to show her off on the Internet. And this sets off a torrent of deadly consequences for the town and all who live there. This book is scary as hell and doesn’t hold back.\n\nBook: “The Year of the Witching” by Alexis Henderson\n\nThis was my favorite read in 2020, as Alexis Henderson’s “The Year of the Witching” is both scary as well as, in some ways, empowering and severely feminist. It’s a mix of historical fiction and dystopia, a world not ours but in a lot of ways like ours. In the small community of Bethel, the townspeople live a religious patriarchal life, and have banished witches into the Darkwood with violence and rage. Immanuelle Moore is herself a rebellion, the biracial daughter of a woman who ran into the Darkwood to find the witches, and who died in childbirth after her return. Immanuelle is trying to keep in line, but is drawn to the Darkwood by the spirits who live there. They give her her mother’s journal, and as she reads she starts to find out the truth about her mother, and the truth about Bethel. This kind of read will make your blood boil, but will take your breath away.\n\nBook: “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: The Crucible” by Roberto Aguirre-Sacassa\n\nEven though the final season of “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” was lame lame lame, I still liked it as a whole because it was creepy, witchy, and a great look at witches with power taken from a bubblegum comic origin. But let me tell you, the comic that it is based upon is SO MUCH DARKER, and that is why it makes this list. Yes, we are following Sabrina ‘The Teenage Witch’ Spellman, as she adjusts to being a teenage witch while living with her witch aunts Hilda and Zelda. But this comic is straight up horror, with murder, dark magic, cannibalism, and black masses like whoa. And I LOVE IT SO MUCH, and I am SO SAD IT KIND OF DIED OUT. I love all the scary stuff that Aguirre-Sacassa brings to this story, and how it still manages to have tongue planted in cheek even as people’s faces are being ripped off and teens are being sacrificed for dark spells. I love handing it to unsuspecting people in my life, and it almost always has a positive, if not scandalized, reaction.\n\nBook: “Goddess of Filth” by V. Castro\n\nSometimes the witches we deal with in these stories are amateurs, or even inadvertent, and then they unleash something a bit beyond their capabilities that has some serious consequences. That is the kind of horror story that “Goddess of Filth” by V. Castro is, and it’s pretty scary AS WELL AS EMPOWERING (yeah okay, I had to have some empowerment on this list as well, as I’m sure you’ve noticed as you’ve gone through it). Five Latina teenagers are doing some lighthearted witchcraft during the summer after their senior year, but they accidentally summon the spirit of an Aztec goddess, who possesses the shy Fernanda. Now her friends have to try and figure out how to get Fernanda back. But the spirit they are dealing with isn’t what she seems. This book about friendship, identity, imperial oppression, and teenage witchery is fun and pushes expectations of the themes at hand.\n\nBook: “The Witches” by Roald Dahl\n\nWhy the heck not end this list with a children’s story? After all, “The Witches” by Roald Dahl is not only a classic children’s book, it also has some scary witches at the heart of it! An unnamed young boy learns about the existence of witches while living with his grandmother in Norway, whom he came to live with after his parents deaths. She tells him how to tell a witch from a human woman, as witches sole goals are to snatch up children and turn them into horrifying creatures. When the boy returns to England, he suddenly finds himself surrounded by witches, and has to thwart the Grand High Witch’s plan to run the world’s children into mice! It sounds pretty tame, but as a child this book is pure nightmare fuel! I hope that all the kiddos out trick or treating next week won’t run afoul any witches like this!\n\nWhat witch horror books are your favorites?

In this series, one of us with present a list of our favorites from within a given sub-genre of one of our greater preferred genres.\n\nWhile I mostly review historical mysteries and detective mysteries on this blog, I’m also a huge fan of forensic mysteries. It’s actually a favorite subgenre for both Kate and I. Honestly, at this point, she’s probably more caught up on some of our favorite series than I am, considering the pivot I’ve made in recent years for my reviews here. But what is a forensic mystery?\n\nWhile the detective mystery is the ruler of the mystery genre, with the story following a detective of some sort (lots of variation for how official this title is), forensic mysteries have exploded in the last 30 years or so, challenging this norm. The popularity of shows like “CSI” and “Bones” can perhaps be attributed to some of this increased popularity. Those examples alone do most of the work defining what makes forensic mysteries stand out: the stories will typically follow a scientist of some sort who is involved in solving crimes by close examination of evidence and expert interpretation of those nuanced facts. You have a lot of coroners, medical examiners, anthropologists, etc. Due to the nature of this type of evidence and work, most forensic mysteries rate high on the gruesome scale, with detailed explanations of anatomy and murder methods. While not exclusively so, the leading characters in this subgenre are often female, serving as a nice balance to the still male-dominated detective mystery genre.\n\nAs I’ve said, this subgenre has exploded in recent years. So my list here is just scratching the surface of what’s to be found. There can also be a lot of overlap between forensic mysteries and other subgenres. Let’s take a look at a few!\n\nBook: “Deja Dead” by Kathy Reichs\n\nHaving mentioned “Bones” in my introduction, I couldn’t not include the long-running book series on which the show is based. Like the show, the story follows Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist. But really, that’s where most of the similarities end. This Brennan has a daughter, a precarious marriage, and, while she does have a few friends, no where near the level of quirky scientist lab friends that she has in the show. There is a character who Booth is loosely based off, but the romance is nothing like the show, with this character not even being a romantic interest at certain points. But Temperance herself is largely similar, being a very analytical and scientific individual. She also has a strong sense for justice which can get her caught up in crimes that then end up striking close to home. This is a long-running, current series with book number 21 coming out just last month.\n\nBook: “The Crossing Places” by Elly Griffiths\n\nSimilar to the previous title, this is another female-lead forenstic thriller/mystery series. In this case, the lead is Dr. Ruth Galloway, a forensic archeologist. As such, her expertise is in bones, thus there is often a lot of cold cases involved in stories. This first book involves the discovery of a set of bones that are suspected to be those of a young girl who went missing years before. But this crime won’t stay in the past, and when another girl goes missing, Dr. Galloway finds herself dealing with a very real killer. Again, this is a very long-running series, with the most recent book involving Galloway’s experiences of the pandemic lockdowns.\n\nBook: “The Bone Collector” by Jeffery Deaver\n\nAs a change of pace, this series follows a male lead. The series begins by introducing Lincoln Rhyme, once a well-known, respected criminologist. But he’s been out of the game for a while after an accident turned his life upside down. He’s drawn back into the game, however, when he is personally challenged by a diabolical killer. He must team up with a police detective and solve the complicated forensic mystery laid out before him. This one is a nice change of pace in that the lead has an expertise in criminology, opening up the series to cover a wide variety of various forensic techniques and clues. This series has been running since 1997, so you can guess as to its length so far…\n\nBook: “The Lost Girls of Rome” by Donato Carrisi\n\nTime for stand-alone options, for those not ready to commit themselves to double-digit-long series! This book offers a nice mix of genres, including several nice nods to historical elements that become integral parts of the mystery. The lead is a young widow and forensic analysist who, while trying to uncover the truth in her husband’s death, finds herself caught up in mysterious forces that trace back through Rome’s long and twisting history. While touching on the details and analysis that is at the heart of all forensic mysteries, this one has a lot to offer for fans of lots of different types of books. Plus, like I said, it’s not as much as a commitment as some of the other series on this list!\n\nBook: “Postmortem” by Patricia Cornwell\n\nLike the Temperance Brennan series, this is another cornerstone in the forensic thriller/mystery genre, so it is only fitting to finish up this list with it. This series follows Kay Scarpetta, a medical examiner whose close eye and keen sense of justice sees her caught up in one investigation after another (seriously, this series started back in 1990 and the 26th book in the series came out this year, so…). This book is also often credited as the first book in the now popular forensic thriller/mystery subgenres. It’s also not a stretch to imagine that its success also helped build up the ever-popular, numerous, numerous forensic TV shows like “CSI” and the ilk. It’s definitely a must for fans of this subgenre (along with the Brennan series, this it the other series I regularly read, for what that’s worth!).\n\nWhat forensic thrillers/mysteries do you enjoy reading?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links for books we recommend.

In this series, one of us with present a list of our favorites from within a given sub-genre of one of our greater preferred genres.\n\nI have been obsessed with vampires for a very long time. While in childhood I liked vampire stories just fine, it was “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” in middle and high school that really gelled with me, genre wise. And vampire horror is still a sub-genre that I really love, even if I have VERY picky standards for it. There is so much you can do with vampires, mostly because they are not only iconic in horror, they have so much history in folklore all around the world.\n\nThere are so many types of vampire stories to tell. The tried and true Gothic sensibilities with castles and or manors run by monsters. The deeply romantic vampire story with eroticism bubbling over. The feral creatures who are just out to destroy and eat. I’ve read many vampire tales and vetted through the highs and the lows (here’s a tip: if you aren’t into Amish romance, a vampire themed Amish romance isn’t going to do it for you). The books I’ve selected for this list kind of tap into the different themes, and are, to me, stand outs in the genre for various reasons. I could have listed many more but limited myself. Just know these are by no means the only good vampire stories out there! They’re just jumping off points.\n\nBook: “The Vampyre” by John William Polidori\n\nI mean, I’ve mentioned “Dracula” in other book lists, and while “Dracula” is absolutely a great vampire novel (like, the grandfather of the genre, really), I wanted to think outside the box. Instead, let’s talk about “The Vampyre” by John William Polidori, which was one of the influences on “Dracula”. Taken from the short tale that Lord Byron told on that fateful trip with Mary Shelley, Poliodori expanded upon it and created a complete short story that was published (and repeatedly misattributed to Byron, as much as both men tried to correct this misconception). It follows a young man named Aubrey, who travels to London and meets an aristocrat named Lord Ruthvern. They hit it off, and Ruthvern asks Aubrey to travel with him around Europe. As they travel together, people around them start dying in strange ways, namely their throats being torn out. By the time Aubrey has put two and two together regarding his friend, it’s too late. Poliodori was the guy who took the idea of feral creatures of folklore and made them into a predatory, enigmatic, and charming high class man of society who preys upon those around and below him.\n\nBook Series: “The Vampire Chronicles” by Anne Rice\n\nA lot of the sexy and erotic vampire themes we see in today’s vampire stories can be directly traced to the likes of Louis, Lestat, Armand, et al in “The Vampire Chronicles”, Anne Rice’s dreamy, vicious, and subtly steamy vampire series. Starting with a fairly simple “Interview With the Vampire”, in which a vampire named Louis tells his story of becoming a vampire and the way it changed him, and going to stranger realms with “Prince Lestat and the Realms of Atlantis”, we follow a complex mythology and history of a group of vampires and their melancholy, or outlandish, backstories. From 18th Century New Orleans to 1980s America to BCE Egypt, Rice takes her characters to many settings and connects them through time and relationships and blood. Lestat is the clear center of the tale, his vain and over the top personality so much fun follow (seriously. I love Lestat), but with other interesting characters who pop in and out the stories have a lot of influence on today’s vampire mythos. And the simmering sexiness of Lestat and his implied and/or confirmed lovers is PALPABLE. While sexy vampires have always been a thing, Rice tapped into it in ways others had not, and it works. I haven’t read them all (I never went past “Queen of the Damned”), but I wholly intend to keep going. If only because Lestat is such an iconic vampire in literature.\n\nBook: “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist\n\nIf you’re looking for a claustrophobic vampire story involving children, loneliness, friendship(?), and coming of age, “Let the Right One In” by John Ajvide Lindqvist is going to be the one to check out. I read this around the time the film came to America’s arthouse movie theaters, and was immediately pulled in by how it was simultaneously sweet as well as deeply unnerving. Oskar is an isolated twelve year old boy who lives in a Swedish housing complex with his mother. Oskar has no friends at school and is repeatedly bullied, but then a new girl named Eli moves into the building with her father…. Although, he isn’t her father. And Eli isn’t a normal little girl. She’s a vampire who has been around for hundreds of years. Both Oskar and Eli are seeking connections, though their reasons are very different. On the surface this story seems like a lovely tale of friendship found between outsiders, and to some extent it is. But there is also the nagging sensation that Eli has darker motives for wanting a new companion, and taps into the ideas that vampires are, by nature, predatory, and even if they think they can love, they never really can. It hits ya right in the feels.\n\nBook: “The Coldest Girl in Coldtown” by Holly Black\n\nI felt a need to have an example of YA vampire fiction on this list, but wasn’t going to highlight “Twilight” (it’s just not my bag, baby). Instead, I turn to Holly Black’s “The Coldest Girl in Coldtown”, a YA vampire story that is less romantic and more thriller and horror driven in its storytelling. Tana is a teenage girl who wakes up at a friend’s house after a raucous party… and finds most of the guests are dead, killed by a vampire. Her ex boyfriend Aidan survived, but looks like he’s been infected by vampirism. And there is a strange vampire boy who claims his innocence, and needs protection. So Tana opts to rescue them all and take them to the nearest Coldtown, a fenced off community where vampires and other creatures can live in sanctuary. But usually when you enter a Coldtown, you can’t leave. So Tana has to figure out how to get around that. This book is fast paced and feels a bit like a YA vampire “Escape from New York”, and Tana is a very enjoyable main character who kicks a lot of ass.\n\nBook: “‘Salem’s Lot” by Stephen King\n\nI’d be remiss if I left my man Stephen King off this list, and “‘Salem’s Lot” is his entry into the vampire zeitgeist. And because it’s King, he brings in not only some good vampire horror, but also some other more ‘elevated’ themes, as elevated as Danny Glick was outside Mark Petrie’s window. Ben Mears returns to the small town of Jerusalem’s Lot, where he spent a good chunk of his childhood, after years of being away. When he arrives, he finds himself in the midst of strange occurrences. Little does he know, at least at first, a new community member named Kurt Barlow is a vampire, and he intends on turning the entire town into a vampire community. So Ben has to team up with other towns people to stop him. So while we have our ‘vampire infiltrating a human community’ story, King also dabbles in the metaphors of homecoming and the darkness and dissipation of small town America.\n\nBook Series: “The Strain Trilogy” by Guillermo del Toro, and Chuck Hogan\n\nAnd finally, I wanted to tackle a vampire story that has a SUPER unique idea of vampirism and how it comes to pass, and that is “The Strain” Trilogy by Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan. While many modern vampire tales stick to the tried and true ‘vampires sire other vampires’ mechanism, del Toro and Hogan ask ‘what if it was like a parasitic disease?’ When a commercial airliner arrives at JFK and comes to a halt halfway down the runway, with all the communication down and no signs of life aboard, the fear is bioterrorism. So when Ephraim Goodweather of the CDC arrives to check out the threat, he thinks he knows what to expect. But then he boards the plane, and finds everyone dead, he’s horrified. What Ephraim doesn’t know, however, is that this isn’t a bioweapon that anyone can conceive of. What it is is a vampire virus that infects people via parasites, and makes them in the thrall of a master who intends to wipe out humanity. The first book, “The Strain”, is pretty darn good. Admittedly the other two didn’t live up to it, but it’s still super unique and fun to see del Toro play with expectations of the genre.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite vampire books?

I believe it’s a fairly polarizing one as well: fantasy readers either really love it or really dislike it. Like some other sub-genres in much greater sprawling genres, it also gets a lot of snobbery directed to it as “low brow” fantasy literature. I think most of this comes down to the fact that urban fantasy is typically fast-moving, action packed, and focused more on an individual lead character than on creating a massive, complex world, magical system and cast of characters.\n\nA few features that are common in urban fantasy typically come down to setting and the type of fantasy elements involved. As the title of the sub-genre implies, most urban fantasy is set in an urban environment. Almost always, urban fantasy takes place in some alternate version of our own world, with real cities featured as the backdrop. However, “urban” by no means is limited to major cities, as there are plenty of urban fantasy series set in fairly small to medium sized metro area (or even some that take place mostly in rural locations). The thing that mostly stands out is that they are decidedly NOT second world fantasy and don’t include entirely made up lands.\n\nThey also typically feature a cast of magical creatures. The leading character usually has some connection between these worlds, the world of the humans and the, often underground, world of magical beings. You see a lot of vampires, werewolves, demons, and fairies in these types of books. Urban fantasy also typically features one or two leading characters and is highly focused on following their particular tales across a series of books. And, as I mentioned above, the writing is often fast paced and has an emphasis on quippy dialogue and action set pieces.\n\nBook: “Moon Called” by Patricia Briggs\n\nPatricia Briggs writes almost quintessential urban fantasies. She has two major series, but her “Mercy Thompson” series is her longest running with the other series coming in as a spin-off. Mercy is a coyote shapeshifter, but she starts the series trying to live primarily in the human world as a mechanic. This doesn’t last long, however, when she gets caught up in an on-going mystery involving her handsome werewolf neighbor, Adam. As the series continues, the world expands massively to include vampires, ghosts, demons, and a bunch of other less well-known magical creatures. This is a fast-paced story with a heavy emphasis on Mercy’s own quippy narration.\n\nBook: “Storm Front” by Jim Butcher\n\nI haven’t read a lot of Butcher’s “Dresden” series myself, but there is no way to talk about urban fantasy and not mention this incredibly popular author. There’s a pretty large stereotype that urban fantasy is written by women, for women, and features women, but Butcher’s “Dresden” series puts paid to that idea as it’s probably one of the biggest series out there. The story follows Harry Dresden, a wizard who also works as a private investigator for the Chicago P.D. when ordinary crimes present with decidedly unordinary elements. Because the main character is a P.I., these books mix elements from urban fantasy, mysteries, and crime fiction into action-packed bundles of fun.\n\nBook: “Forest of the Heart” by Charles de Lint\n\nCharles de Lint is the author I go to when I’m looking for cross-over between urban fantasy and literary fiction. Unlike the first two books on this list, de Lint’s stories operate at a slower pace and place a stronger emphasis on description and scene-setting. Technically, “Forests of the Heart” is in the middle of one of his series, but many of his books stand alone, and this was one of my personal favorites of his. The story features Bettina, a part Native American, part Mexican woman who is a witness to the ongoing conflict between the spirits that came over with settlers and the native beings who roam the land. She calls these dark beings, the ones from the other lands, los lobos and stays well clear. Until one shows up on her doorstep.\n\nBook: “Feed” by Mira Grant\n\nThis is another book that has a lot of cross-over appeal, this time between urban fantasy and horror. Zombies exist in a kind of nebulous realm where both horror and fantasy claim them as beings to be found in their own genres. So, we’ll give zombies to urban fantasy with this one. The story is of two siblings and bloggers, Georgia and Shaun, who are documenting the ongoing zombie apocalypse. This is also a YA book (all the rest of these are technically listed as adult fiction, though I’d say they can also count as new adult). The story does lean into the gore and horror side of things, so strict fantasy fans should be aware of that. But the story does meet a lot of the other criteria for urban fantasy: fast-paced storytelling, a contemporary setting, and two main characters featured heavily at the heart of the story.\n\nBook: “Written in Red” by Anne Bishop\n\nAnne Bishop’s “Others” series is another wildly popular urban fantasy series. And, while it meets many of the standards of the genre (urban setting, werewolves, nature spirits, etc.) it is decidedly not a fast paced book. Instead, this is the urban fantasy series for those fantasy fans who really like to revel in the world itself. A lot of emphasis is placed on the characters and the world structure, and a lot on the politics between the humans and the fantasy creatures. Less emphasis on action, with there often only being one or two action scenes, some even happening off page. It does present an incredibly unique setting and world where the colonizers of North America found that they were by no means the most powerful to walk the land and have to find ways to not tick off the powerful magical forces that rule this continent.\n\nBook: “Rosemary and Rue” by Seanan McGuire\n\nAnd to round out my list, we return to another very popular, very traditional series of urban fantasy. Seanan McGuire’s ongoing “October Daye” series is probably one of the best out there. I, for one, am a huge fan! The story follows the titular October Daye, a changeling who is part human and part fae. Like many of the main characters in urban fantasy series, she starts out trying to maintain a life that distances herself from Faerie, a place where she feels she has been betrayed. But, so too, she doesn’t quite fit into this human world either. After a murder falls into her lap, Toby is pulled back into the fae world and must take up her old role as a knight errant. From there, the series unfolds with her becoming more and more enmeshed in the goings on between Faerie and the human world. This series stands out because of Toby herself. Given her unique situation (no spoilers!), she’s a bit of a darker character than some of the other leading urban fantasy ladies we’ve seen.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite urban fantasy books?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
