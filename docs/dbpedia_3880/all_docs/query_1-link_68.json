I'm all about these smart leads being thrown into games that test their brains. With this movie we also get a character that has had a traumatic past that has caused him to see himself as a clown. The only part of the story that I need more of is this. I see why the Clown scenes happen I just need to know exactly why they are there and why it was important to move the plot-line along. I know the movie is to be continued as the credits scene said so. I really hope we get more of that because the scenes just seemed irrelevant to the plot-line but regardless weren't annoying or anything, they looked visually pleasing. Onto one other thing, I love that the game is simple like rock, paper, and scissors but I wish the entire game wasn't just that. I kind of was wanting more than one round on the ship. I want more to be explained about what happens to those who don't get 3 stars and no cards left rather than just rumors?\n\nActing/Cast: Brilliant! That's all I have to say here. They were brilliant. I really loved how many races and languages were spoken in this movie!\n\nMusic: It was perfect when it was needed and not overly used and annoying. Nothing stood out to me though.\n\nRewatch Value: While I wouldn't watch it again right away, I could see myself watching it again before the next movie comes out. Or if I suddenly wanted to show a friend or family member this movie. (Which is possible.)\n\nOverall: (9/10)\n\nRead More\n\nWas this review helpful to you?"
