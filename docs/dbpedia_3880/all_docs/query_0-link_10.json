        "text": "I only watched the dinosaur segment because it was animated by Ray Harryhausen and Willis O'Brien (the master of the master) and, consequently, it's the only part I cared about. The short segment (about ten minutes) feels like a tournament fighting game, where dinosaur is pitted against dinosaur (Brontosaurus vs. Allosaurus; Stegosaurus vs. Ceratosaurus; Ceratosaurus vs. Ceratosaurus; Triceratops vs. T-Rex) until, in the end, God punishes the dinosaurs for their sins. No, seriously, the narrator implies that dinosaurs were punished for their brutishness and violence. A sort of \"live by the sword, die by the sword\" situation.\n\nThe narration is hilarious. One of the few things I knew going in is that the director, Irwin Allen, wanted to avoid any…\n\nIn the 1950's, Ray Harryhausen had become well known in the world of stop-motion animation with successful sci-fi films like The Beast From 20'000 Fathoms in 1953, and Earth vs. The Flying Saucers in 1956. However, that same year also featured one of Harryhausen's most overlooked films, that being the feature-length documentary known as \"The Animal World\". Directed by Irwin Allen, who had previously won the Oscar for best feature length documentary with 1953's Sea Around Us, The Animal World was Allen's attempt to show the progression of life on Earth over time, with Allen shooting real live-action documentary footage of animals in the wild, as well as a short ten-minute long prologue showing the prehistoric world of the dinosaurs…\n\nJustifiably famous for its short Harryhausen animated dinosaur sequence, but the rest of the movie has its retro charms too. This is the sort of nature film that sits at the exact opposite end of the scale to David Attenborough - actual scientific insight is minimal, it leaps from subject to subject almost every few seconds, and it repeatedly uses comedy voiceovers and sped-up footage to make the natural world wackier and more amusing. There's a tangent about Adam and Eve, and how God put mankind in charge of all the animals. Alexander the Great gets namechecked simply because he rode a horse. At one point the narrator just starts listing off all the popular sayings that mention animals -…"
