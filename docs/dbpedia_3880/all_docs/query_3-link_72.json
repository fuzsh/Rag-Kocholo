        "text": "This week’s topic is genre. Genre is a broad idea that the film shows to the audiences. Based on cultural differences, genres could vary, and each specific culture may have its own type of genre or a frequently used genre. As Chinese movies are often related to families, country, and love; American movies are sometimes related to heroism or individualism. But genre is not a fixed idea and it often changes in form. Scenes, music, and subjects all could infer the possible genre that the movie is referring to, but none of these directly point out the specific genre that the movie “should” have. For example, Gravity talks about a dramatic event happening in the outerspace, but the genre could be vitality and the newborn. Genre essentially defined the idea of the movie and in what way should the film be made. And some of them revels stylistic patterns, like Hong Kong martial art movies often shows loyalty and respect. More than scenes, iconography also infers the genre. Iconography is the symbolic subject that has been carrying around in the film, showing the genre. We tend to see plenty of those iconography is films, they could be an object carried, the costume, or even the character itself.\n\nSo, how does does genre evolved? The history of film genres is a dynamic journey that combines influences from various artistic sources with the innovation that cinema uniquely offers. Film genres, such as comedy, and musicals, find their origins in stage plays, novels, and other media. Cinema’s distinctive power lies in its ability to reshape these borrowed genres. For example, the Western genre didn’t emerge until the early 20th century when films grew longer, enabling outdoor landscapes. This innovation led to its popularity and the unique American identity it represented in cinema. Genres continuously evolve due to technological advancements. Synchronized sound gave birth to musical films, while digital tools expanded the possibilities for fantasy and science fiction. The journey of genres is marked by unexpected twists. Cycles, batches of related genre films, rise and fall in popularity, often triggered by a successful film. Subgenres may emerge and flourish over time. Mixing genres has become a means of innovation, attracting different audiences. Genres may mixed with other cultural influences, producing fresh and engaging narratives. Despite genre mixing, distinctions among genres persist. While genres may adapt and change, filmmakers, critics, and audiences usually agree on the genres in play at any given time in the film history.\n\nGenres also serve as a social and cultural work, offering audiences predictable expectations and a shared language for media consumption. They reflect and comment on social values, provide emotional catharsis, and allow for escapism. Genres can foster identity, community developing, and social bonding among fans, while also serving as a tool for exploring and addressing social issues. Additionally, they have economic implications, helping the entertainment industry target audiences and manage expectations for commercial success. In essence, genres play a crucial role in shaping how we engage with and interpret media and entertainment. Also, it influenced the perspective of a film, making the message different when different social and cultural backgrounds are given.\n\nMore than the book shows, there are still numerous genres in today’s movie, and we can never say that a movie follows a specific genre without the context of the society."
