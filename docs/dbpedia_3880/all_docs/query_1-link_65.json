        "text": "I recently watched the film Animal, and I don’t think I’ve ever cringed this much in the space of a few hours. It was the incessant violence (well, the treatment of women is horrible too). I still watched it though, because underneath all the blood and guts (spoiler alert), was an even more ubiquitous and compelling thread of severe trauma.\n\nIn particular, Ranbir Kapoor’s character, Ranvijay Singh Balbir, is an extremely unstable, violent, and unpredictable example of what can happen when you’ve been raised with childhood emotional neglect. Neglect of Ranvijay’s emotional and psychological needs by his father, Balbir Singh, played excellently by Anil Kapoor, is revealed in detail towards the end of the film. The scene between father and son, as they role play each other, is perhaps the most powerful scene in the whole film, at least from a trauma perspective. That scene reveals just how neglected Ranvijay felt, who was married to his work, running what is India’s greatest enterprise in the movie: a steel plant.\n\nChildhood emotional neglect includes a set of actions by parents, intentional or not, and here I’ve put in bold what Ranvijay’s father, Balbir, did:\n\nIndifference to a child\n\nViewing or labeling a child as a burden\n\nIgnoring a child’s needs\n\nParental substance abuse\n\nApathy toward a child\n\nMindless or uninvolved approach to parenting\n\nBlaming a child for their behavior\n\nPretending a child doesn’t exist\n\nConstantly calling a child ‘bad’\n\nAs a result of Balbir’s neglectful parenting, Ranvijay is unhinged, and he responds by overreacting to anything that has to do with protecting his family. One of the examples we see is how he takes a gun to school to threaten the boys who teased his sister. He shuts down his new bride, played powerfully by Rashmika Mandana, for saying one derogatory comment about his dad. It becomes clear that violence, both physical and verbal, are a huge part of Ranvijay’s coping mechanisms. Ranvijay is also a vehicle for normalizing violence — he doesn’t bat an eyelid when it comes to killing and torturing others.\n\nHere are the characteristics of adults who were neglected as children — the ones in bold are exhibited by Ranvijay:\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n\nPanic disorders\n\nBipolar disorder\n\nSubstance misuse\n\nDistorted sense of self\n\nHigher risk of suicidal behavior\n\nDifficulty maintaining relationships\n\nDepression\n\nAnxiety disorders\n\nDistrust of others\n\nInability to ask for help\n\nPersistent feelings of loneliness, guilt, or shame\n\nInability to deal with emotions or emotional volatility\n\nFears of abandonment\n\nInability to set boundaries\n\nDissociative behaviors\n\nIn the film, Ranvijay is unable to stop himself from doing everything possible to try and save his father from those who want to kill him and take his wealth — he sleeps with a woman he correctly suspects of being a mole to gain intel, at the risk of losing his marriage; he kills multitudes of people who have been sent to kill him and his father; he fights to the death with the man who ordered the hit on his father. Ranvijay almost dies trying to protect his father. His need to prove his worth and to have some loving attention from his father drives his every desperate act.\n\nIn the end, Balbir is diagnosed with late stage cancer and given mere months to live. While Balbir realizes his neglectful parenting at this stage, there is already a lot of damage done both in terms of Ranvijay’s mental health, and the atrocious violence to others."
