        "text": "Thomas Cailley’s sci-fi fantasy has too much sensitivity and good taste to be the proper horror-thriller or creature feature that it almost resembles. It’s a drama of emotions and ideas about post-Covid society – which is welcome enough – but with a dash of prosthetics and CGI and some scares. I felt something very similar about Bong Joon-ho’s monster film The Host back in 2006: the worthiness operates against the excitement and I found myself wanting something more gleefully crass and shocking, something more ironic or thrillingly callous. The Animal Kingdom seems squeamish about going for the jugular in the way a proper genre movie would – or a Marvel movie.\n\nThe scene is a France of the near future in which there has been an outbreak of some disease which has caused humans to mutate into animals. The government is just about on top of the situation, having established high-security clinical holding units to confine the “bestioles” (“critters”) as local people heartlessly call them. François (Romain Duris) is a stressed guy keeping his emotions in check since his wife became a “bestiole” and now has to be a single-dad to his tricky teen son Émile, in which role Paul Kircher indicates that he might be succumbing to the disease with unnervingly subtle bovine and simian mannerisms, camouflaged within classic adolescent sulkiness. Adèle Exarchopoulos rather phones in the role of a uniformed female cop who appears to have a tendresse for François.\n\nSo is the animal mutation a new kind of identity of equal value to un-mutated homo sapiens, something to be heard and respected and not be prejudiced against? Perhaps, though this well-crafted film arrives at these implications a little late for them to be fully explored."
