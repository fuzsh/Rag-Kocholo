        "text": "A kingdom of wounded and dying animals – that is, animals of the most vicious, dangerous kind – is what director David Michôd portrays here, and this is maybe the nearest we're going to get to an Australian GoodFellas. It is a tense, violent and supremely watchable crime drama, set in the bluecollar-gangland of Melbourne and starring Guy Pearce and Ben Mendelsohn, reviving memories of Eric Bana in Chopper and Scott Roberts's Australian heist thriller The Hard Word.\n\nMichôd begins his movie with the queasiest touch of gallows humour: we seem to be watching bored teen Joshua Cody, known as J, played by James Frecheville, emotionlessly watching TV on the couch next to his sleeping mom. Yet the succeeding scene shows that this is not exactly what is happening, and J is sent to live with his cousins, the notorious Cody crime family, whose suburban home is under permanent surveillance by the cops. It is a household of lairy aggressive males, the Cody brothers, presided over by their ferocious mother Janine Cody, played by Jacki Weaver, who has a cloyingly sentimental regard for family above all things, and adores embarrassing her boys by kissing them in public, lingeringly, on the mouth. Yet she demonstrates a chilling ruthlessness.\n\nSullivan Stapleton plays Craig Cody, a bankrobber and, in his leisure hours, a shirtless beer enthusiast who is very much not the brains of the operation. This role is assumed by non-family member Barry, played by Joel Edgerton, who is weary at the increasingly unattractive risk-reward ratio offered by armed robbery. Luke Ford plays Darren Cody, who makes far more money selling drugs in league with crooked cops, but the drug trade is faintly despised by his gun-toting robber-siblings as a soft option; well-dressed Darren is himself suspected to be gay, and selling drugs is evidently scorned as a \"gay\" sort of crime by these old-school tough guys. The worst of them all is Andrew \"Pope\" Cody, a sociopath cop-hater on the run from the law, terrifically played by Ben Mendelsohn: a neurotic obsessive whose criminally murderous behaviour is less a career choice than a pattern of irrational compulsion entirely outside his control.\n\nThe bank-robbery business is dying, and the Codys are in stalemate with Melbourne's police. Under intense surveillance, they are unwilling to try any more robberies, and the police are rumoured to be about to whack the Codys in the absence of evidence. Poor Barry is making a desperate attempt to persuade the Cody family to abandon the pointless, unrewarding world of violent crime and instead try day-trading at the stock exchange.\n\nIt is into this bizarrely dysfunctional situation that poor, gormless, innocent J stumbles. We see things from his point of view, the outsider-insider, but he soon becomes a participant, assigned the minor, but fateful, task of stealing a car for a particular job. Something in J's youth reinvigorates the Codys, and we see how they want to mentor him, to show off in front of him, and we see also how his air of hapless vulnerability stimulates Jackie's protective instincts. But these have perhaps also been awakened in local detective Leckie, played by Guy Pearce, who thinks he may be able to \"turn\" J, and bring the whole family down.\n\nThe tone of Michôd's film is perhaps set by the strange, dreamy montage over the opening credits: a selection of security-video stills of bank jobs in progress: presumably, but not necessarily, being carried out by the Codys themselves. Blurry and contorted in the scan-lines of the computer screen, they look like insects or underwater creatures in a nature documentary, perhaps in the throes of some evolutionary crisis which will wipe them out. The sequence detaches the activity of bank-robbing from the traditional context of drama and thrills, and instead invites the viewer to see bank robbing as a desperate, hopeless activity, like something the damned would do for ever in hell. I wonder if Michôd isn't tempted, like art cinema practitioners, to experiment with installations of photos or paintings of these robbery-in-progress pictures. They certainly have a hypnotic quality.\n\nMendelsohn is excellent as the chilling \"Pope\" Cody, obsessed with other people's weakness and with a needling habit of asking his brothers to open up and confide in him, not for any reasons of sympathy or curiosity but quite plainly so that he has a pretext for rage, contempt, violence and self-pity. Weaver is effective as the fanatical matriarch, a performance to be compared to Nancy Marchand's imperious portrayal of Tony Soprano's hatchet-faced mother Livia. And Frecheville himself is very good as J, the boy who could either commit to his family or throw in his lot with Det. Leckie and go into a witness protection programme. This dilemma, and J's crisis of loyalty, are expertly held in the balance until the very end."
