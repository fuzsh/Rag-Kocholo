        "text": "A film genre is a set of conventions and formulas, repeated and developed through film history that organize and categorize film according to repeated subjects, icons, and styles.\n\nGenres describe cultural rituals and follow an economics of predictability.\n\nThe Foundations of Film Genre\n\nEarly cinema knew about genres because they existed in its predecessors- photography, literature, art, and musical halls.\n\nConventions, Formulas, and Expectations\n\nA genre is a category or classification of a group of movies in which individual films share similar subject matter and organization of that subject.\n\nGeneric conventions are isolated properties or figures that identify a genre through such features as character types, settings, props, or events that are repeated from film to film. These also include iconography.\n\nGeneric formulas are principles of arrangement about how to organize generic conventions through a plot. In some cases these can create myths.\n\nGeneric expectations describe the experience and knowledge that a viewer activates while watching a film, so that she anticipates the meaning of particular conventions or the direction of certain narrative formulas.\n\nA Short History of Film Genre\n\nGenres have been used to classify works of literature, theatre, painting, music and other arts. For example literature has the broad genres of tragedy and comedy; musical genres include love songs and classical sonatas.\n\nGenres provide models for producing other work, direct audience expectations, and create categories for evaluating a work.\n\nGenre films were mass produced by the studio systems. The Paramount Decision of 1948 effected the production of genre film because the monopoly hold on distribution the studios had was dissolved.\n\nSix Film Genre Paradigms\n\nIt may seem daunting to try to create a list of movie genres. Genres are a product of a perspective that groups movies together, which can construct them in many ways. Genre is a multi-dimensional field with two major subsets: hybrid genres and subgenres,\n\nThe six central genres are comedy, western, melodrama, musical, horror, and crime films.\n\nEach of these genres have subgenres that include:\n\nFor comedy: slapstick, screwball, and romantic\n\nFor westerns: western epic, the existential western, and political westerns\n\nFor melodramas: physical melodramas, family melodramas, and social melodramas\n\nFor musicals: the theatrical musical, the realistic musical, and the animated musical\n\nFor horror: the supernatural thriller and psychological horror films\n\nFor crime films: gangster films, hard-boiled detective films, and film noir\n\nValues and Traditions in Film Genres\n\nTo Prescribe or To Describe\n\nGeneric perspective on a movie may promote either prescriptive or descriptive values.\n\nRelated to prescriptive values is the tradition of classical genres, and to descriptive values is the tradition of revisionist genres."
