        "text": "BOSTON, MASS. (July 2024) – With the debut of Animal Kingdom: A Tale of Six Families on the giant screen of the New England Aquarium’s Simons Theatre, visitors are invited to embark on a joyful adventure to explore and celebrate the diversity of life on our planet. The film explains why animals are the way they are and answers the simple but important questions that form the basis of our knowledge about the animal world.\n\nAs veteran natural history and large format filmmakers, writer-directors Paula Grusovin and Amelia McCarten created Animal Kingdom with captivating nature footage, taking audiences to the far corners of the Earth. Viewers can get up close and personal with a rich cast of animal characters: the offbeat dung beetle, the irresistibly cute penguin, the ferocious crocodile, and the wise elephant matriarch, as well as swim with whales and listen for sorrow and joy in their mysterious songs in a true giant screen theater.\n\n“While watching this film, we want the viewer to step into Animal Kingdom and experience a sense of fun, warmth, wonder, and also a sense of hope for its future,” said Grusovin and McCarten. “It’s our hope that our film, Animal Kingdom, can reignite a passion for the natural world and the creatures within it, and empower our little people to celebrate the fact that we are not separate from the animal kingdom—but we are part of it.”\n\nThis new family-friendly film comes to the New England Aquarium in time for summer vacation. Tickets and show times are available by calling 617-973-5206 or by visiting neaq.org."
