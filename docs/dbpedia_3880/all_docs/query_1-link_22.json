Under Smurf's strict and watchful eye, the Codys engage in various high-risk illegal activities and heists, with young J having to navigate unfamiliar and dangerous waters, all while challenging Smurf's unchallenged authority.\n\nEllen Barkin delivers a commanding performance as Janine \"Smurf\" Cody, the matriarch and criminal mastermind, alongside Scott Speedman, Ben Robson, Shawn Hatosy, Jake Weary, and Finn Cole.

It introduces us to Joshua \"J\" Cody (Finn Cole), a 17-year-old boy who finds himself moving to a Southern California beach town after his mother's tragic overdose. He is thrust into a new world, living with his estranged grandmother and uncles, who are far from ordinary.\n\nThis scene takes place in the picturesque town of Oceanside in California.

Alternatively, you can rent a car or take a taxi for a more direct route.\n\nIn Season 1, episode 4, a critical location that stands out is Baz's house, which Catherine Belen (Daniella Alonso) visits. She plays the role of one of Baz' (Scott Speedman) girlfriends alongside Lucy (Carolina Guerra). The episode is centered around Pope's (Shawn Hatosy) birthday preparations, with Smurf (Ellen Barkin) keen on ensuring that her rules are being followed. J, the young protagonist, learns more about why his mother was estranged from the family.\n\nThe house at the Strand in Oceanside plays a crucial role in this episode's backdrop. It encapsulates Southern California's relaxed, coastal ambiance, enhancing the story's realism. The Strand, a well-known street in Oceanside, boasts breathtaking beach vistas and is conveniently close to local points of interest. This setting aligns perfectly with the series' storyline, which unfolds in a quaint seaside town.\n\nAlthough the house's interior is not open to the public, fans can still take a walk along the beach and explore the exterior. The Strand is a public road, so it's accessible to everyone. While there, fans can also visit other filming locations in Oceanside, including the iconic Oceanside Pier.\n\nThere are several ways to reach your destination after leaving from San Diego International Airport. If you value comfort and privacy, consider hiring a car or catching a taxi. The ride should take around 40 minutes. However, if you're interested in a more environmentally friendly and picturesque travel option, the Coaster commuter train is an excellent choice.\n\nIn the riveting episode Betrayal (S2.E13), Smurf (Ellen Barkin) is faced with the reality of a potentially extended jail stay. In response, she cunningly pits her sons against each other, indifferent to the resulting fallout. This episode is packed with tension and high stakes, as the family dynamics are tested under the strain of Smurf's manipulations.\n\nThe primary scenes were shot at the renowned Warner Bros Studios. Established in 1923 by the Warner brothers â Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack â the studio quickly became an influential player in the American film industry. With its expansion into animation, television, and video games, Warner Bros has cemented its status as one of the \"Big Five\" major American film studios.\n\nVisitors can get a glimpse of behind-the-scenes action at one of the world's oldest film studios during a two-to-three-hour tour. Initially, tours were only conducted for friends and special guests, with employees serving as guides. However, after facing financial difficulties in 1972, Warner Bros opened its doors to the general public, offering more people a chance to witness the magic of filmmaking firsthand. For celebrities and VIPs, there is an exclusive VIP studio tour.\n\nTo reach Warner Bros Studios, located in Burbank, you have various options depending on your starting point. If you're coming from downtown Los Angeles, you can take the Metrolink train to Burbank Station, followed by a short taxi ride to the studios. Alternatively, if you're driving, you can take US-101 North from downtown LA, exit at Olive Avenue, and follow the signs to the studios.\n\nIn the gripping episode 12 of Season 4, the Cody family embarks on Smurf's (Ellen Barkin) enigmatic heist, oblivious to the startling revelations that await them upon their arrival. These unforeseen events will indelibly alter the course of the family's future.\n\nPart of the production was filmed in the sprawling metropolis of Los Angeles, a city synonymous with the glitz and glamour of America's film and television industry. Nestled in Southern California, Los Angeles is home to iconic landmarks like the Hollywood sign and major film studios such as Universal, Paramount Pictures, and Warner Brothers.\n\nThese movie-making giants offer behind-the-scenes tours that provide an inside look at the magic of filmmaking. The TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard showcases handprints and footprints of celebrities, while the Walk of Fame pays tribute to thousands of luminaries in the entertainment industry. Vendors selling maps to stars' homes also add to the quintessential Hollywood experience.\n\nYou have various options to reach Los Angeles, depending on your location. If you're flying in, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is the city's primary airport. From LAX, you can rent a car, take a taxi, or use a rideshare service to reach Hollywood. Driving might be the most convenient option if you're already in California. For example, you can take Interstate 5 South from San Francisco for a scenic road trip to Los Angeles."
