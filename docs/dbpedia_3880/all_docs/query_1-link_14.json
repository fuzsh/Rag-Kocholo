        "text": "In the movie, protagonist Kai Si (played by Li Yi Feng) dives headfirst into a deadly rock-paper-scissors tournament aboard a disused ship, where he must win in order to survive. With my limited mastery of Mandarin and mathematics, I really wanted somebody to re-explain the movie’s math logic to me. The show is visually spectacular in animating each mathematical trick, but is each deduction sound? It goes by too quickly to tell. Sadly, I could only find reviews focusing on the trippy Deadpool-esque clown action sequences. Well, spoiler alert, here goes nothing-\n\nRules\n\nPlayers start with 12 cards: 4 rocks, 4 papers and 4 scissors, and 3 stars. The game is 4 hours long.\n\nPlayers duel one another by playing one card each. Each card can only be played once. The winner of each round collects a star from the losing player. A draw results in no stars changing hands.\n\nPlayers win by completing their hand while having three or more stars. When they win, they can opt to leave the arena. They are rewarded with significant riches and a chance to leave fully intact.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of cards or stars a player can carry.\n\nPlayers are eliminated immediately if they lose all their stars — their remaining cards are discarded. Players are eliminated at the end of the game if they have cards remaining. Eliminated players sit in towels in a sauna-like room with black-out one-way windows. They have one chance at the end of the game to be ‘redeemed’ with 3 stars. Or else, they become unwitting human subjects for illegal experiments.\n\nHowever, players with no cards but less than 3 stars at the end of the game can buy stars from players with surplus stars.\n\nPlayers are allowed to cheat and steal, but not to get into visible physical altercations. Players are not allowed to dispose of their cards outside of the arena.\n\nPlayers are allowed to borrow money from a bank at exorbitant minute-based interest rates. They are allowed to buy and sell cards and stars to one another.\n\nThe number of cards left for each type is publicly displayed.\n\nAnimal World Mathematics, in Chronological Order\n\n1. Persistent matching as a winning strategy.\n\nKai Si is quickly ‘befriended’ by a fellow Chinese man Zhang Jing Kun, who offers to partner him to fake-duel with a stacked, fully-matched deck. By playing a rock to a rock, a scissors to a scissors etc, they would exhaust their decks while each retaining all three stars.\n\nThis move requires a lot of trust, because knowing another person’s deck order means being able to win, guaranteed, against them. Jing Kun swindles Kaisi of two of his stars in this manner.\n\nOther variations of this strategy could include using a third person to hold on to two duelists’ stars and dole identical cards out to them, to incentivise them not to cheat. An alternative strategy to get rid of one’s cards while holding onto one’s stars is simply to refrain from duelling at all, and sell cards to players who have less than 3 stars and insufficient cards. But that would not make for an exciting movie.\n\n2. Trade cards for stars to have at least one spare star.\n\nWith 5 cards and 2 stars in hand, Kai Si and his buddy Li Jun realise that they need at least 1 spare star in order to play with confidence. They decide to target players with 2 stars but 0 cards, who are then incentivised to exchange a star for multiple cards in order to have a shot at winning 2 more stars.\n\nThis is not a terrific strategy. The target player, with 2 stars but no cards, can well wait until the end of the game to buy a surplus star. In addition, a strategic target player would approach players with >3 stars and remaining cards, for whom the additional cards are a liability (since you must have 0 cards in order to win) rather than an asset, and ask to be paid to take over the remaining cards.\n\nIt works as a plot device, though. The duo’s chosen target player, Meng Xiaopang, steals a card from them and swiftly loses his additional star. When questioned, his answer gives Kai Si a brainwave…\n\n3. Exploit card type equilibrium to win isolated rounds.\n\nXiaopang explains that their hand — previously comprising 4 scissors and 1 paper — did not inspire confidence due to its lopsidedness. A stronger hand would include an even mix of card types, so that the player would be able to respond to most play-offs scenarios should they know their opponent’s card type. Most players would therefore play their hand of 12 cards in 4 groups of each 3 types. Kai Si figures that, assuming they can find a players who are adherents of this card type ‘equilibrium’ method, they can observe their play and deduce the likely next card type.\n\nThe team finds a target player with 9 cards left, and plenty of stars. They win the first star off him; he counters them by offering to play three more rounds based on their existing hand. Through their absurdly scissors-heavy hand and some suspenseful acting, the team wins two out of the next three rounds.\n\nAs a back-up for this trick, they talk about borrowing $500k USD to buy an extra star, but strangely allow themselves to continue without first securing this insurance policy. There’s also an easter egg scene, where a player is shot for attempting to get rid of his cards via the toilet.\n\nWhile the equilibrium strategy has a logical appeal, its critical flaw is predictability. The crux of rock-paper-scissors is that losing is impossible as long as the other person’s played card type is known, or even winnowed down to 2 possibilities. Equilibrium can be advantageous against opponents who are also using equilibrium, or in the rare situation where an opponent’s card type is known in the moment; but against a non-equilibrium strategy, it is disadvantageous every 2 out of 3 plays.\n\nThat said, as long as a player watches a target across multiple plays, they can eventually deduce what strategy they are using, and what card types they have left. It is therefore critical to select opponents with care, be suspicious and conscious of one’s spectators for every duel, and drop misleading hints about one’s hand.\n\n4. Hoard a specific card type to guarantee winning\n\nHaving run out of cards, the team needs to buy more. Kai Si observes that, globally, paper cards are dropping significantly faster than scissors and rock types. Assuming this trend continues, paper cards would run out first; when this happens, rock cards will be guaranteed success against the remaining scissors cards. The team uses $100k and two moles to sneakily buy cards from people with 3 stars, knowing that the strategy would be ruined if others knew about it. This leaves them with 30 rocks, 2 scissors, 4 papers and 5 stars.\n\nUnfortunately, their big cash withdrawal does not go unnoticed. To counter their rock-hoarding, another team begins to hoard paper cards, leading to a slow decline in the numbers of both rock and paper cards. They realise this with dismay — despairing, Xiaopang and Li Jun promptly lose their spare stars in rapid duels. They realise belatedly that their challengers belong to this rival team, when the Spanish trio strolls over to show off and challenges them to a duel. The stakes are high as our heroes have no spare stars, and many potentially useless cards. The two teams eventually settle on a one-card duel with three stars and all of our heroes’ money ($400k) at stake.\n\nHoarding cards is a risky strategy. It can work if (1) information is completely controlled, i.e. no one knows that a player is hoarding, and (2) even if no one knows, no one else also tries to hoard. Given that the team knew that many players were returnees, they were naive to assume that they would not be discovered. In this case, they found out about the counter-hoarding too late to counter-counter-hoarding (ie. by hoarding scissors cards as well), and their rock-heavy hand leaves them at a severe disadvantage to the paper-hoarders, as well as to anyone else who is aware of their rock-hoarding.\n\n5. Odd-numbered cards as long-term liability for allied teams\n\nPride comes before a fall; Kaisi intuits that the reason for the Spanish trio to insist on a one-card duel must be that they have an odd number of cards. If allied players have an even number of a specific card type, they can use the matching strategy in SN1 to get rid of them safely. Even with two odd-numbered card types, they can ‘lose’/’win’ a duel internally and still get rid of all their cards. Only if their total card count is odd would they struggle to play all their cards within the alliance.\n\nGiven that the Spanish alliance has odd-numbered cards, Kaisi guesses that they are likely to play from the card type that they have the greatest number of, which is paper (since they are hoarding paper). So he plays scissors, and is proven right — the lucky guess hands them three stars, and a sense of momentum. They buy the remaining cards from the demoralised Spanish trio (who sell their leader out), but who still have enough stars to leave the arena safely albeit begrudgingly.\n\nThe Spanish alliance messed up here, and they were unlucky. With one card short, they could easily buy another card from another player; or, duel a player with a less obvious record of scheming. They should not have agreed to wager three stars. And they could have countered the protagonists’ likely move by, say, playing a rock instead for a likely draw or possible win.\n\n6. Achieve information symmetry by shuffling\n\nJing Kun returns, offering to exchange one of his surplus stars for 5 of Kaisi’s cards, and negging Kai Si to dump the rest of his cards on his buddies to win. Naturally, this provokes all of Kai Si’s moralistic fury, and he refuses. Jing Kun probably didn’t need these 5 cards to win, and the film almost suggests that he just wanted Kai Si to act selfishly.\n\nAnyway, Jing Kun is royally pissed off now. And, perhaps no one is willing to duel with him. He pitches a grand reshuffling to all the remaining players —with the small number of cards left in play, it’s likely that other players know which card types one another holds, bringing everyone to a stalemate. Reshuffling would return information symmetry to the playing field, as everyone would have the same probability of holding each card type. His idea gains traction, and Kaisi’s group is compelled to join in by Jing Kun’s threat that those who participate in the shuffle will only play amongst one another. Kaisi’s massive hand is revealed to gasps of shock. 3 scissors cards are deemed missing from the reshuffled deck.\n\nThis is an interesting move, it certainly has shock value and changes things up. It puts Kaisi at a disadvantage, because his large hand is now known by everyone, who may be suspicious to play with him. If I were one of the other players, with less than 3 stars and a few cards left, I would only participate if forced by the social pressure. This is because the shuffling would give others information about the number of cards I have left, and in such a small group it would be hard to fake it.\n\nThe devilish Jing Kun (the film puts in 0 effort to humanise this character) unsurprisingly cheats. While counting and redistributing the cards, he gives Kaisi’s group all of the remaining papers, and distributes the few scissors cards to players with one card in their hand. He gives himself enough stones to defeat these targets, and is in the midst of convincing one of them to play with him when Kaisi confronts him and unveils his trickery.\n\nJing Kun seems to be motivated to collect the highest number of stars possible. His deliberate reshuffling was a very risky move — once exposed, no one would want to duel him. Even if not exposed, returnees could remember that they lost consistently after the reshuffling, and raise suspicions.\n\n7. Guarantee random play to attract opponents\n\nKai Si then offers the remaining players a random duel. He has enough cards that he can put out one of each type, with the opponent choosing one at random. This gives them a 1/3 chance to win, instead of playing with Jing Kun who knows which cards are in their hand. The audience is shown Kai Si wining one and losing two rounds, expending one of each card type. Our heroes now have 4 stars between them.\n\nDesperate, Jing Kun appeals to the players who did not participate in the shuffle, trying to draw out the 3 scissors cards that had not been accounted for. Kai Si shocks him by breaking the news that the 3 scissors cards had been flushed down the toilet. In order to get rid of his remaining card, Jing Kun has no choice but to play with Kai Si. Kai Si raises the stakes to 5 stars — all of Jing Kun’s surplus. Jing Kun is tempted to doom himself as well as Kai Si’s team by refusing, but Kai Si points out that they actually have an even number of cards, and can expend them internally without Jing Kun’s help. They would then buy stars when the round ends. Jing Kun is bullied into agreeing, and we get to see Jing Kun slapping himself repeatedly as Kai Si waits for the precise final moment to play the duel and save Jing Kun from elimination.\n\nIf you can guarantee completely random play, your expectation is to win 1/3 of the time, draw 1/3 of the time, and lose 1/3 of the time. As the game goes on with finite cards, the probability of encountering each card type starts to shift. Kai Si’s move was useful; he removed the factor of number of cards left in play completely. If I were a lay player with an appetite for gambling, I would also choose to play with him.\n\n8. Bring leverage to ensure redemption\n\nThe juicy math is now replaced by juicier ‘human nature’ critiques. With the many cards in his hand, Kai Si is eliminated and made to wear a towel in a sauna-like room. Kai Si is dramatically double-crossed by his team-mates, who opt to sell their extra 3 stars for ~$50k each instead of save Kai Si. A gangster in the sauna boasts to Kai Si that those who enter without leverage cannot be assured of redemption; he’d played the game many times, and had entered in order to help confederates outside cheat.\n\nFortunately, Kai Si is quick-witted enough to notice that the gangster is not holding on to enough cash to compel his counterparts to redeem him. Kai Si notices that the gangster has a wound on his back covered with an unsuitable type of gauze, and deduces that this must be how additional riches are smuggled into the sauna-room and stolen from the ship. He fakes a fight with the gangster on his way out and steals the gauze, which shimmers with gemstones (from where? No one knows). The gangster’s confederates then redeem Kai Si from the sauna.\n\nThankfully, no towels fall during this altercation.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nBroadly, the game deals with three types of resources. Stars give players confidence to duel with strangers, and are necessary for safe exit; Cards enable players to win or lose stars, and their presence after a certain point in the game prevents safe exit; Information about other people’s cards is the understated crucial currency. The more you know about your opponent’s hand, the easier it is to win.\n\nAs another commentator pointed out, the high price of stars doesn’t make sense. They’re an indestructible resource, and they have no value once the post-game haggling period ends. There should be surplus stars, since there are individuals who are eliminated early by losing all their stars. And the demand for stars is fixed — everyone only needs three. With a low demand against a high supply, the star market should be a buyer’s market.\n\nThe movie is weird, but also entertaining. For some reason, all the players are male — where my ladies at? And, all the referees are African. Strange indeed.\n\nAlso, I don’t get how the nefarious bosses benefit from this game. There’s a hint of Joker-style ‘education’ as the motivation — the game is supposed to teach people to turn on one another, and lie / cheat / steal. I wonder if rock-paper-scissors was the right game to choose, then; there’s so many ways where cooperation can have win-win outcomes."
