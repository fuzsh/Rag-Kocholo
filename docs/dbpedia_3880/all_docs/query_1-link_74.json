There is no mass wailing and gnashing of teeth.

But before a formal announcement, people are going to discuss what direction they would prefer.

No insider info here though, just speculating.\n\nNot that I‚Äôd want an attraction to be based on the Live action version but I saw Jungle Book for the first time in a few years last night. Forgot how good it is.

Shame they let Kali River limp along. I guess it gets adequate GSATs though. Wouldn't hurt my feeling any to see it get the IP mandate treatment.

Followed by Mary Poppins!\n\nNot that I‚Äôd want an attraction to be based on the Live action version but I saw Jungle Book for the first time in a few years last night. Forgot how good it is. One of the only live action remakes I enjoyed.\n\nJungle Book is IMHO the only live action remake that surpasses the quality of the original. If they ever would bring Jungle Book into DAK - and I think they should! - I'd favor using the live action version as the basis.\n\nJungle Book is IMHO the only live action remake that surpasses the quality of the original.

The characters are more charming and the versions of the songs are more iconic. Overall, the animated version has everything you need to make a good ride. Besides, Jungle Cruise kind of has the live action animals thing covered.\n\nHow to tell if someone has never faced a challenge in their life.\n\nI know this doesn't really apply, but it was an excuse to get a Lion King gif in here.\n\nI agree that the live action movie is better but still the think the ride should be based on the animated version.

It's just a timeless story on how man and nature interact that fits into DAK cleaner than Lion Hamlet.\n\nYa know if the Lion King flume ride is guranteed.. there‚Äôs always the possibility, if they wanted to.. they could make the Festival show Jungle Book to balance things out/add more variety Otherwise, I def think Jungle Book being the ride and then keeping the Festival of the Lion King works out best. But truthfully, either way is fine IMO.\n\nYa know if the Lion King flume ride is guranteed.. there‚Äôs always the possibility, if they wanted to.. they could make the Festival show Jungle Book to balance things out/add more variety Otherwise, I def think Jungle Book being the ride and then keeping the Festival of the Lion King works out best. But truthfully, either way is fine IMO.\n\nI‚Äôd hope not. A Jungle Book show makes no sense in Harambe. Unless they were to move the theater a second time, which isn‚Äôt going to happen\n\nCurious, if Lion King land for DLP is announced, but Lion King isn't announced for Animal Kingdom, how likely is it that the rumors for a Lion King Ride for AK was just confused with rumors for DLP's Lion King land??\n\nP.S., today is National Lion Day, so as appropriate day to announced a Lion King attraction"
