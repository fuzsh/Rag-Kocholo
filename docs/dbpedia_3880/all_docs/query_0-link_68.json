        "text": "One of the most talked about films at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival is this wild and inventive genre mash-up that combines the warmth of a family drama with the disturbing visuals of a Cronenbergian body horror.\n\nRomain Duris (Eiffel, AF FFF21) and Paul Kircher (Winter Boy, AF FFF23) play FranÃ§ois and Ãmile, a father and son living in the not-so-distant-future when the planet is afflicted with a new crisis: people are mutating into animals. One of the casualties of this nightmarish scenario is FranÃ§oisâs wife and Ãmileâs mother. The pair relocates to live near one of the new institutions designed to indefinitely house the human/animal hybrids, including their wife/mother. Amid the growing mystery, paranoia and fear emerges Ãmile's tender coming of age story. He discovers what it means to be human and how the next generation will adapt to a world where the forces of nature are changing forever.\n\nFilmmaker Thomas Cailley, who previously distinguished himself with the unconventional anti-romcom Love at First Fight, delivers yet another compelling, rule-breaking and convention-defying film."
