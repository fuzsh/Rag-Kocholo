        "text": "Earlier this week, Japan’s NTT Data Corp. agreed to buy Dell Inc.’s IT services division (formerly Perot Systems, acquired by Dell in 2009) for $3.05 billion. Not a great long term investment by Dell, as the company acquired Perot Systems for $3.9 billion. But, since Dell is spending $59 billion to acquire storage giant EMC , they need to come up with a few dollars to help lighten the debt load.\n\nThe deal is the latest evidence of the rising wave of growth and change in the IT services industry as interconnectivity continues to become a larger part of everyday communication. While flashy technology such as the Oculus Rift and virtual reality captures public attention, there are larger changes occurring in the relative obscurity of mundane IT services. NTT is attempting to buy into this now boring, but repeatable cash flow.\n\nAs technologies are changing and emerging, opportunities exist for both large and small IT companies; the evolution of IT encourages both large corporations and small, independently-owned organizations to recreate business relationships in order to maintain a competitive edge.\n\nFor smaller firms, as the IT services industry continues to mature and become commoditized, they need to accrue management acumen and increase their scale. As a result, strategic buyers within the industry, as well as institutional investors, have applied their knowledge to IT services, resulting in a rapid scaling of the sector. Hence, the massive size of service providers such as NTT or Presidio.\n\nMeanwhile, new players have entered the IT space in recent years, attracted by a growing market with higher margins than their original businesses. Distributors have found their niche in this market, along with new developers, suppliers, and manufacturers. All of these companies are ripples in the vast ocean of technological advancements, and they have become reliant on one another to thrive.\n\nSucceeding in this fast-moving environment requires that firms understand the M&A market, its dynamics and the opportunities. But make no mistake: Consolidation will continue, whether entrepreneurs understand their long-term options or not.\n\nThe Perfect Storm\n\nIn addition to the continual growth and consolidation in the IT services market, there are other factors at play here. The M&A wave is fueled by a variety of other factors, economic and otherwise. All of these dynamics work together to create opportune conditions for IT services consolidation.\n\nEconomic Factors – Historically, mergers and acquisitions have had a recurring pattern across a variety of industries. The nature of the M&A game is dependent on the economic state—a dip in the economy tends to decrease the number of business deals, and bold ventures are often a passing thought. However, once the state of the economy turns around, large, corporate buyers begin a cycle in which they push blockbuster deals. These large business dealings often have a ripple effect, creating significant changes in a sector’s environment. As this cycle continues, there are more opportunities for companies and financial buyers to acquire smaller businesses in order to fill voids left by initial, larger transactions. We are still in the eye of the M&A storm and are seeing large deals such as NTT/Dell and abundant smaller transactions.\n\nDemographic Factors – As the early pioneers of the IT services sector are aging, those original business owners are looking to pass their companies on to the next generation of innovative thinkers, and are creating succession plans and focusing on the valuation of their businesses.\n\nThis newer generation also consists of many smaller companies with their own specialized offerings—think cloud storage and managed services. Many of this group were founded by technological experts; some without the sales and management acumen of their forefathers. Consequently, many are now reaching maximum capacity: they are exceeding their own business skill sets and need additional resources to grow.\n\nTechnological Factors – As technologies continue to evolve and change, they are also driving continuing consolidation. The IT market is undergoing a shift from being computer- and product-based to cloud- and mobile-focused. As the industry shifts, new opportunities and demand arise for capabilities and skills that can keep up with the evolving technologies. Companies that may have focused on only computer services now have a need to acquire business units that specialize in cloud technologies.\n\nIndustry Opportunity Factors - IT services companies tend to provide broad opportunities for potential buyers. There are many characteristics and infinite combinations of what might attract and represent value for a buyer: location, client base, management team, vendor relationships, vertical focus and expertise, technical skill set, chemistry, etc. Consequently, in the IT services space, many different fits are possible, resulting in broad consideration of potential transactions.\n\nGlobal Factors – Globalization is a driving factor in the consolidation wave, namely because opportunities for offshoring are arising. In addition to traditional offshoring destinations, companies are starting to look to South America and Eastern Europe for lower-priced—but still highly skilled—labor. While offshoring demands a high level of operational expertise, many opportunities exist for large corporations to build and expand on offshoring opportunities that have been developed by their smaller, entrepreneurial counterparts.\n\nIn addition to offshoring efforts, there has been an increase in the immigration of companies that are not yet part of the American market. A variety of inquiries exist from companies in Asia and Europe that desire to enter the United States by acquiring local delivery systems.\n\nSurf’s Up\n\nAll of these factors are working together to create the perfect storm to maintain the swell that helps to maintain the IT services consolidation wave. As technological advancements create opportunities for companies to grow, there will also be opportunities for these companies to take advantage of each other’s skill sets and customer bases. Deals like NTT/Dell are only the tip of the iceberg – Merger and acquisition rates will continue to rise, and the market value for IT services will continue to surge. It is beginning to look like this wave won’t hit shore for a long time."
