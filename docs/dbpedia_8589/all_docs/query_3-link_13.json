        "text": "Dell Technologies own Dell and are considered Dell's parent organization. Michael Dell, an American entrepreneur and businessman, is known as the founder and original CEO of Dell. The company is one of the world's leading sellers of personal computers. Michael Dell became the CEO of Dell's parent company, Dell Technologies, in 2016 when it was formed.\n\nIn 2015, Dell announced its aim of acquiring EMC Corporation. EMC Corporation is an enterprise software and storage company. The deal was a $67 billion transaction and was given the title of the highest-valued tech acquisition in history. Along with Michael Dell, Singapore's Temasek Holdings and Silver Lake Partners were major Dell shareholders that supported the transaction.\n\nIn 2018, Dell Technologies was considering a reverse merger with VMware, a subsidiary of Dell, in an attempt to take the company public. Later that year, Dell Technologies became a publicly traded company, bypassing the standard IPO process by buying back shares that tracked the monetary performance of VMware.\n\nIn 2021, Dell had an annual revenue of $101.224 billion, with over 158,000 employees working for the company."
