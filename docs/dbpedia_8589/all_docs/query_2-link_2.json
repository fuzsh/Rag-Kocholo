        "text": "TOKYO — Dell has agreed to sell its Perot Systems subsidiary, which provides information technology services to hospitals and governments, to the Japanese technology company NTT Data for almost $3.1 billion, NTT Data said in a regulatory filing on Monday.\n\nThe deal is part of a reorganization by Dell as it prepares to buy the data storage provider EMC for $67 billion. That transaction, the largest ever in the technology industry, was announced in October.\n\nDell bought Perot Systems, founded by the entrepreneur and onetime presidential candidate Ross Perot, for $3.9 billion in 2009 as it tried to expand beyond its struggling core business of making personal computers. But now Dell is shedding peripheral units and raising cash as it prepares to take over EMC."
