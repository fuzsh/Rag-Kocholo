        "text": "Computer manufacturer Dell will purchase Perot Systems, an information technology services provider, for approximately $3.9 billion, according to a joint statement from both companies. Once the acquisition is complete, sometime during the fourth quarter of 2009 or first quarter of 2010, Perot Systems, which was founded by 1992 presidential candidate Ross Perot, will become Dell's services unit and will be led by Peter Altabef, currently Perot Systems' CEO, and will continue to operate out of its Plano, Texas, facilities; Dell is headquartered in Round Rock, Texas. \"We consider Perot Systems to be a premium asset with great people that enhances our opportunities for immediate and long-term growth,\" says Michael Dell, Dell's chair and CEO. \"This significantly expands Dell's enterprise-solutions capabilities and makes Perot Systems' strengths available to even more customers around the world.\" Says Ross Perot Jr., Perot Systems' chair, \"When my father founded Perot Systems, he envisioned a global information technology leader. The larger Dell builds on that promise and its own successes by taking Perot Systems' expertise to more customers than ever.\" The Associated Press reports that Perot Systems will bring Dell more than 1,000 customers, with about 48 percent of revenue from the healthcare industry and 25 percent from government; its customers include the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and all branches of the U.S. military."
