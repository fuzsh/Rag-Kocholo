        "text": "Dell has announced that it will buy IT services company Perot Systems for about $3.9bn, as it looks to expand beyond the PC business.\n\nDell said on Monday that it will offer $30 (Â£18.50) per share in cash for Perot, which is based in Plano, Texas, 200 miles away. The company said it expects to close the deal in the November-January quarter.\n\nDell said Perot, founded by former presidential candidate Ross Perot, will expand the company's IT services offerings and widen the pool of potential customers for its computers.\n\nDell said Perot would help it provide a broader range of IT services and solutions and optimise how they are delivered. It also expects the acquisition to extend the reach of Perot Systems's capabilities around the world and supply leading Dell computer systems to even more Perot Systems customers.\n\nDell said the two companies share \"complementary\" characteristics, including \"relationship-based business cultures\".\n\nPerot Systems is known for offering services for applications, technology, infrastructure, business processes and consulting. It has clients in healthcare, government and other commercial segments, from SMEs to large global institutions; it also has a large and growing base of customers and service-delivery capabilities in North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Asia.\n\nIn the past year, Dell and Perot had a combined $16bn in enterprise-hardware and IT-services revenue, with about $8bn from enhanced services and support, the companies said.\n\nOnce the acquisition is complete, Perot will become Dell's services unit and be led from Plano by Peter Altabef, the current Perot Systems chief executive.\n\nDell directors are expected to consider Ross Perot Jr, Perot Systems's chairman of the board, for appointment to the Dell board."
