        "text": "On Tuesday, Dell Inc. closed its biggest acquisition ever: a $3.9 billion purchase of Perot Systems Inc.\n\nThe deal won't add to Dell's bottom line for a year or so, but it positions the company to expand in technology services, a higher-profit business than the hardware that now provides 70 percent of its revenue.\n\nThe new Dell Services unit will be based in Plano, where Perot Systems is headquartered. Peter Altabef, who has run Perot Systems for the past five years, will be president.\n\nAltabef will report directly to CEO Michael Dell, underscoring the importance of the new operation to Dell's future.\n\nPerot Systems strengthens Dell's offering in tech services, helping customers with complex technology integration and other issues.\n\nDell said the new unit will have 41,000 employees and annual revenue of about $8 billion. It will be the platform for further acquisitions in the tech services area as Dell seeks to diversify its revenue base and become less reliant on hardware sales.\n\nThe ability to offer higher-end services also enables Dell to expand its relationships with its biggest business and government customers, which provide the majority of Dell's revenue.\n\n\"It's a new age for Dell,\" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst with the Enderle Group in San Jose, Calif. \"The hard-core services business is something they'd always resisted going after.\"\n\nBut with the slowdown in growth in the PC industry, it was time for Dell to make a play, Enderle said. \"They bit the bullet,\" he said. \"This is IBM-level services.\"\n\nIt will take time for Dell to reap any rewards from the deal, Enderle said.\n\n\"Typically in a merger like this, you don't see the benefits for at least 12 months. The fourth quarter of 2010 is when we'll be looking for whether this is actually benefiting them or not,\" he said.\n\nThe combined company will have about 100,000 workers worldwide, and Michael Dell has said he doesn't expect extensive job cuts as a result of the acquisition.\n\nDell long has focused on computer hardware but has been hit hard during the recession as business customers cut back their tech spending. Services accounted for less than 10 percent of Dell's revenue in its most recent quarter, compared with more than 30 percent for Hewlett-Packard Co. and more than 52 percent for IBM Corp., according to Bloomberg News.\n\nDell paid $30 a share for Perot Systems and said the total cost of the deal, including fees and expenses, came to $4.2 billion.\n\nPerot Systems was founded by billionaire H. Ross Perot in 1988, four years after he sold his first computer services company, Electronic Data Systems Corp. — now known has H-P Enterprise Services — to General Motors Corp.\n\nAdditional material from staff writer Kirk Ladendorf.\n\nlhawkins@statesman.com; 912-5955"
