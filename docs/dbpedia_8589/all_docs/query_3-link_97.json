The ex-dividend date will be November 2, 2021, the first trading day following the Payment Date.\n\n“VMware’s mission is to deliver the trusted software foundation that accelerates our customers’ innovation,” said Raghu Raghuram, chief executive officer, VMware. “As a standalone company, we will continue to bring our multi-cloud strategy to life by providing our customers the power to accelerate their business and control their destiny in this new era.”\n\nVMware and Dell will continue to partner to provide differentiated solutions for their customers. The previously announced commercial agreement between VMware and Dell preserves and enhances the go-to-market synergies jointly developed over the last several years with continued support and service for their mutual customers.\n\nAbout VMware\n\nVMware is a leading provider of multi-cloud services for all apps, enabling digital innovation with enterprise control.
