        "text": "In a bid to reverse its flagging fortunes Dell is to buy computer services firm Perot Systems in a €3.9 billion deal.\n\nThe Texas firm, set up by billionaire and one-time American presidential candidate Ross Perot, will become Dell’s services unit, giving the computer maker impressive expertise in integration, deployment, and systems management.\n\nThe expanded Dell will be even better positioned for immediate and long-term growth and efficiency driven by:\n\n• providing a broader range of IT services and solutions, and how they’re delivered\n\n• supplying Dell computer systems to Perot Systems customers.\n\nThe two firms share several key characteristics. Dell says their “products, services and structures are overwhelmingly complementary.”\n\nThe two have similarly strong, relationship-based business cultures.\n\nDell’s global commercial customer base spans large corporations, government agencies, health-care providers, educational institutions, and small and medium enterprises (SME).\n\nUnder the deal, Perot will be led by Peter Altabef, the firm’s incumbent chief executive officer. Perot’s services currently cover applications, technology, infrastructure, business processes and consulting. It has a large and growing base of customers and service-delivery capabilities in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia.\n\nIn the past four quarters Dell and Perot Systems jointly had €16 billion in enterprise-hardware and IT-services revenue, with about $8 billion from enhanced services and support.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Dell will start a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding Class A common stock of Perot Systems for €30 per share in cash. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition, but is subject to usual government approvals and the satisfaction of other customary conditions. It is expected to close in Dell’s November-January fiscal quarter."
