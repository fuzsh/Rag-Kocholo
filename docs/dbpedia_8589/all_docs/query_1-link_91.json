        "text": "NTT DATA, a leading systems integration subsidiary of NTT has entered into an agreement with Dell to acquire Dell Services, its IT consulting division for over $3 billion to bolster its services business. Dell Services is the former Perot Systems, a company founded by Ross Perot which Dell acquired for $3.9 billion in 2009.\n\nThe Japanese company said the sale will also provide NTT Data a bigger foothold in the US, where it aims to expand in healthcare IT, insurance and financial services consulting.\n\nJohn McCain, CEO of NTT DATA who led this transaction will have the overall responsibility for leading the combined business. Dell Services will continue to operate under the leadership of Suresh Vaswani, president of Dell Services, reporting to Michael Dell, until the transaction closes.\n\nToshio Iwamoto, President and CEO of NTT DATA Corporation\n\nWelcoming Dell Services to NTT DATA is expected to strengthen our leadership position in the IT Services market and initiates an important business relationship with Dell."
