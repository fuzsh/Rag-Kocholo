        "text": "Michael Dell, facing a question of solutions, found a solution that raises questions.\n\nFor years, his namesake company has tried to move beyond personal computers with little success. The big money these days is in computer services, known in geekspeak as \"information technology solutions.\"\n\nLast year, Dell rival Hewlett-Packard bought Electronic Data Systems of Plano, Texas, for $13.2 billion, giving it a foothold in services and a powerful weapon against IBM, which dominates the market.\n\nOn Monday, Dell also went shopping in Plano for a solution, announcing plans to buy Perot Systems for $3.9 billion in what appears a half-hearted attempt to keep pace with a rival that's rapidly leaving Dell in the dust.\n\nThe first question raised by the deal: Can the struggling second acts of two Texas billionaires combine to find success? Michael Dell, after all, returned to lead his company after a series of missteps from which it has yet to recover. Its second-quarter profit fell 23 percent on slumping PC sales. Perot Systems was founded by Dallas billionaire and erstwhile presidential candidate Ross Perot, yet never came close to matching Perot's previous startup success, EDS.\n\nPC makers like Dell and HP have been trying to get into services for years because it's more profitable than peddling boxes. Unlike PCs, which have to be replaced far less frequently than they once did, services represent a steady revenue stream. Customers typically hire a company to manage Web sites, data centers, software, networks and other tech-related functions under long-term contracts.\n\nIn landing EDS, HP got a global company with expertise running systems in dozens of industries, from energy to retail.\n\nDell is buying something far different. Almost half of Perot Systems' revenue comes from the health care industry, mostly in North America. Dell gets neither the global reach nor the industry breadth. Perot Systems, like Dell, has faced slowing sales, though its executives have said they expect to get a boost as health care reform drives demand for electronic medical records.\n\nSo, the question for Dell's shareholders is: Did you buy a tech company to invest in health care? That's not necessarily bad, said Tim Ghriskey, the chief investment officer for Solaris Asset Management, who's followed Dell for years but doesn't currently own it.\n\n\"Health care's not going to be a shrinking business it's revenue, it's market share, it's a place to put their equipment,\" he said.\n\nThen there's the question of price. Dell's paying $30 a share, 68 percent more than Perot Systems' closing price on Friday.\n\n\"It does seem like they paid full price,\" Ghriskey said.\n\nActually, they paid 1999's full price. Perot Systems hasn't traded at $30 a share in a decade. Dell shares have fallen 6 percent since Friday.\n\nThe services business is all about revenue because performance is measured by the deal flow. In buying EDS, HP paid about 60 cents for each dollar of revenue.\n\nDell is paying about $1.40 -- a lot more for a lot less.\n\nHP may have found a way to succeed at the services game, but Dell's strategy of following others into new markets which served it well in hardware doesn't apply in services, where customer loyalty hinges on personal contact rather than a brand name.\n\nWhile Ghriskey agrees the deal's expensive and a bit of a head-scratcher, he also said it could pay off later. Dell said it will add to earnings in about two years.\n\nBut don't expect the acquisition to restore Dell to its glory days.\n\nMichael Dell is opting for a me-too deal that brings the company far more questions than solutions.\n\nContact Houston Chronicle columnist Loren Steffy at loren.steffy@chron.com."
