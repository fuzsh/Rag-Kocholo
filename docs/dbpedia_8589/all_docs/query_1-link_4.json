        "text": "Dell has agreed to sell its IT services subsidiary, Dell Services, to NTT Data for $3.06 billion. Dell Services is the former Perot Systems, a company founded by Ross Perot; Dell purchased it toward the end of 2009 for $3.9 billion.\n\nDell, which went private in 2013, is trying to raise money as it prepares to complete a $67 billion acquisition of EMC. NTT Data, the systems integration unit of Tokyo-based Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, announced its acquisition of Dell Services today, noting that it still needs regulatory approval.\n\nNTT praised Dell Services as being \"an IT services provider recognized for its depth in vertical industries and for its offerings around infrastructure services, cloud services, application services, and business process outsourcing.\" But under NTT, Dell Services will benefit from \"expanded technology resources\" and a network of 230 data centers operated by NTT worldwide, the announcement said. The combined company will give NTT Data a greater presence in North America and focus on customers in health care, financial services, insurance, and government.\n\nNTT Data, which has made numerous acquisitions, \"has more than doubled in market value since 2011 on rising sales to financial and healthcare businesses using the companyâ€™s data centers and software,\" according to a Bloomberg story today. NTT Data is expected to \"hire the 28,000 [Dell Services] employees located mainly in North America and India,\" the story said."
