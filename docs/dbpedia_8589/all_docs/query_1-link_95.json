        "text": "US COMPUTER company Dell is splashing out $3.9 billion on Perot Systems, the information technology company founded by two-time US presidential candidate Ross Perot.\n\nThe agreed takeover is intended to broaden the hardware manufacturer’s services arm, enabling it to provide all-round packages and consultancy to big business clients. It echoes a recent deal in which rival Hewlett-Packard bought Electronic Data Systems – another company founded by Mr Perot.\n\nBased in Texas, Perot Systems was established in 1988 by Perot, a former IBM salesman, along with eight associates. Among the first computer services companies of its kind, the firm’s growth made Perot a billionaire, helping him to bankroll independent pushes for the White House in 1992 and 1996.\n\nThe firm, which employs 23,000 people, generated sales of $2.8 billion last year. It employs about 250 people in Ireland.\n\nMr Perot (79) remains chairman emeritus of Perot Systems and his son, Ross Perot jnr, is chief executive.\n\nThe younger Perot said: “When my father founded Perot Systems he envisioned a global information technology leader. The new, larger Dell builds on that promise and its own successes by taking Perot Systems’ expertise to more customers than ever.” – (Guardian service)"
