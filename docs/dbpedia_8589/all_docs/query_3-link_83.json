        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO: Dell, the onetime leader in personal computers and tech industry stalwart, said Monday it will become publicly traded five years after a contentious private equity buyout.\n\nThe company announced a stock swap deal with its software subsidiary VMware that will result in a reorganized tech giant that returns to the stock market, with founder Michael Dell retaining control as chairman and chief executive.\n\nThe move comes after a 2013 private equity buyout led by Michael Dell aiming to revive the company that fell behind when consumers turned to mobile devices instead of PCs.\n\n“I am proud to lead this great company into its next chapter as we continue to evolve and grow to the benefit of our customers, partners, investors and team members,” Michael Dell said in a statement.\n\n“Unprecedented data growth is fueling the digital era of IT, and we are uniquely positioned with our portfolio of technologies and services.”\n\nThe new Dell is far from the maker of personal computers that helped ignite the personal computer market in the 1990s.\n\nIt acquired the data storage group EMC in 2016 for a whopping $67 billion and is a major player in software, security and cloud computing in addition to its PC business.\n\nMichael Dell, who currently owns 72 percent of Dell Technologies common shares, struck a deal with the private equity firm Silver Lake to take the company private in 2013 in an effort to reorganize without pressure from public shareholders.\n\nThe move came amid fierce opposition from some shareholders led by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who called the plan a “giveaway.”\n\nDell will trade on the New York Stock Exchange after completion of the deal, expected later this year, the company said.\n\nRIYADH: The Trojena Dam project in NEOM is set to advance as Red Sea International Co.has secured a SR658 million ($175 million) contract with the Italian construction and civil engineering firm Webuild SpA.\n\nThis 12-month contract involves the design, manufacturing, supply, and installation of prefabricated buildings for the project.\n\nThe contract includes residential units and various supporting facilities such as a mosque, dining halls, a health clinic, and a gym.\n\nThe work will be carried out in two phases. Phase one will commence immediately, while phase two will begin upon the client’s approval and according to the agreed terms.\n\nThis project aligns with RSI’s strategic goal of becoming a top Saudi company in delivering model solutions for administrative and residential complexes, as well as field hospitals, quickly and efficiently.\n\nRSI aims to provide comprehensive infrastructure, including electrical power, clean water, food supply, and wastewater treatment.\n\nThe financial impact of this project is anticipated to be reflected in the third quarter of 2024 and continue through to the end of 2025.\n\nRSI’s commitment to using high-quality local products and modular units manufactured in various facilities supports key initiatives under Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.\n\nRIYADH: The Saudi Export-Import Bank has announced a notable increase in its credit facilities for non-oil exports, with a 128 percent year-on-year rise to SR16.31 billion ($4.34 billion) in the first half of 2024.\n\nThis growth includes SR7.03 billion allocated for export financing, a 142 percent increase compared to the same period last year, and SR9.28 billion in export credit insurance, reflecting an 11.8 percent increase from 2023, according to a press released.\n\nThe upward trend in these figures underscores the success of EXIM Bank since its establishment in 2020. This aligns with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the economy and enhance non-oil exports. According to EXIM Bank CEO Saad Al-Khalb, this significant growth is a direct result of the Saudi government’s support and strategic direction in fostering sustainable development and economic diversification.\n\n“This was, of course, reflected in the growth and development of institutions and companies in the private sector. Our figures today also prove the continuous maturity of the export system and the great demand from local exporters to benefit from the capabilities provided by the bank to expand their export activities and enter new markets, as well as the success in motivating international buyers to import Saudi products,” Al-Khalb added.\n\nAl-Khalb highlighted that the increase in credit facilities demonstrates the maturity of the Saudi export system and the growing demand from local exporters.\n\nThe bank’s efforts are focused on strengthening global trade relations and supporting the Kingdom’s economic objectives by collaborating with both government bodies and the private sector. This strategy not only helps local exporters expand their activities and enter new markets but also attracts international buyers to Saudi products.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index rose on Sunday, gaining 66.38 points, or 0.56 percent, to close at 11,981.40.\n\nThe total trading turnover of the benchmark index was SR5.93 billion ($1.58 billion), as 174 of the stocks advanced and 49 retreated.\n\nThe Kingdom’s parallel market Nomu slipped 48.92 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 25,712.01, with 39 of the listed stocks advancing, while 36 retreated.\n\nThe MSCI Tadawul Index gained 2,78 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 1,489.26.\n\nThe best-performing stock of the day was Saudi Reinsurance Co., whose share price surged 9.94 percent to SR34.85.\n\nOther top performers were CHUBB Arabia Cooperative Insurance Co. as well as Al-Sagr Cooperative Insurance Co.\n\nSaudi Fisheries Co.’s share price dropped by 7.90 percent to SR20.28.\n\nThe worst performers were Al-Baha Investment and Development Co. and Saudi Investment Bank.\n\nArabian Plastic Industrial Co. has announced its interim financial results for the period ending on June 30.\n\nAccording to a Tadawul statement, the company recorded a net profit of SR5.3 million in the first six months of the year, reflecting an 18.5 percent drop when compared to the same period in 2023, due to an increase in material prices, a rise in overhead cost, and a surge in finance expenses.\n\nEnma Alrawabi Co. has announced a net profit of SR39.79 million in the period ending on June 30, reflecting a 226 percent rise compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of an increase in gross profit by 179.452 percent coupled with a surge in bank returns from investments in accordance with the provisions of Islamic Shariah. This came despite the increase in general and administrative expenses, as well as the increase in the provision for expected credit losses.\n\nAlmasane Alkobra Mining Co. has announced the board of director’s decision to distribute SR79.67 million in cash dividends to shareholders for the first half of the financial year. A bourse filing revealed that the total number of shares eligible for dividends amounted to 88.53 million.\n\nJadwa Investment Co. has announced a decision to distribute SR13.2 million in cash dividends to Jadwa REIT Al Haramain Fund’s unitholders in the first half of the year.\n\nAccording to a Tadawul statement, the total number of shares eligible for dividends amounted to 66 million, with the amount distributed per unit standing at SR0.20. The statement further disclosed that the distribution ratio of the net assets value stood at 2.61 percent.\n\nSaudi Reinsurance Co. has announced that it is applying for a capital increase from SR891 million to SR1.158 billion with suspension of pre-emptive rights.\n\nThis will be done by issuing 26.73 million new ordinary shares to be fully subscribed by the Public Investment Fund so that its ownership in the company’s share capital will be 23.08 percent post-increase, subject to the approval of the Capital Market Authority and the extraordinary general assembly.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia has launched its first international flight route from Cairo to Arar, the Kingdom’s capital of the Northern Borders Province, strengthening its position as a major regional aviation hub.\n\nThe new service, announced by Cluster 2 Airports Co., connects Cairo International Airport with Arar Airport, aiming to boost passenger traffic between Saudi Arabia and Egypt and strengthen trade and cultural ties.\n\nThe launch, overseen by Prince Faisal bin Khalid bin Sultan, governor of the Northern Borders Region, marks a major expansion in the Kingdom’s air connectivity. The event was attended by senior officials from the airport company, representatives from Egypt’s Nile Air, and various government agencies, the Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nThis development aligns with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, which aims to boost the Kingdom's flight route capacity and attract over 150 million visitors by 2030. The new route underscores Saudi Arabia's ambition to become a key aviation hub, connecting the East and West.\n\nAli Masrahi, CEO of Cluster 2 Airports Co., described the route’s launch as a milestone in the company’s transportation and logistics strategy, reflecting its commitment to the National Aviation Strategy. He highlighted the initiative's role in advancing airport infrastructure and enhancing passenger services.\n\nMasrahi also expressed gratitude to the regional governor for his support in attracting more international flights to Arar International Airport and improving the passenger experience across air facilities in the Northern Borders region.\n\nCluster 2 Airports Co., which manages 22 domestic and international airports in Saudi Arabia, continues to expand its global flight network.\n\nThe firm reached a new passenger milestone in July, processing 1.73 million travelers, a 9 percent increase from the previous record set in July 2019.\n\nOperating facilities such as AlUla International, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Airport in Jazan, and King Saud bin Abdulaziz Airport in the Al-Bahah region, the government-run company is experiencing increased traffic as part of its strategy to enhance network sustainability, boost tourism, and improve operational efficiency.\n\nThis growth reflects the broader trend in Saudi Arabia’s air traffic, which increased by 17 percent in the first half of 2024, reaching 62 million passengers compared to 53 million in the same period last year, according to the General Authority of Civil Aviation.\n\nRIYADH: The trade volume between Oman and the Americas reached a substantial 742 million Omani rials, roughly equivalent to $1.9 billion in May.\n\nThis figure represents a notable increase of 6.6 percent from the same month a year earlier, according to preliminary statistics from the National Center for Statistics and Information reported by the Oman News Agency.\n\nThe total value of Oman’s exports to North and South America amounted to 255 million rials by the end of May, reflecting a significant rise of 23.3 percent compared to the same period last year. Leading the category of exports were ordinary metals, valued at 106 million rials, followed by plastics and rubber products with 86 million rials, and products from the chemical industries reaching 43 million rials.\n\nOn the import side, Oman brought in 469 million rials worth of goods from the Americas, marking a 2 percent increase from the previous year. The largest portion of these imports was mineral products, valued at 204 million rials. Vehicles and transport equipment followed with 106 million rials, while machinery, electrical equipment, and their parts totaled 31 million rials.\n\nThe US emerged as the leading American trading partner for Oman, with both imports and exports each amounting to 197 million rials by the end of May. Despite a decrease of 7.9 percent in imports from the US, Oman’s exports to the US grew by 14.6 percent. This development aligns with the benefits derived from the Free Trade Agreement signed between the two countries in 2009, which has fostered increased trade and investment opportunities.\n\nBrazil was the second-largest trading partner among the Americas, with imports from Brazil totaling 226 million rials, reflecting a 13 percent increase. Conversely, exports to Brazil fell to 4 million rials, a decrease of 8.9 percent.\n\nThese trade figures, reported by the Oman News Agency and NCSI, highlight Oman’s strategic importance and its growing role in the economic landscape, supported by key agreements and its crucial position in global maritime oil transport."
