        "text": "Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) is seriously evaluating the acquisition of Dell Inc.’s IT services division, according to multiple reports. Technology news website Re/code first said on 14 December that Dell’s talks with TCS had reached an advanced stage, but ended because the companies couldn’t agree on a price. The Economic Times reported last week that TCS was back on the negotiating table, something that Reuters re-affirmed on Monday. Dell had acquired this business over six years ago when it bought out Perot Systems Corp. for $3.9 billion.\n\nIt’s best that TCS stays away, even if it runs the risk of being overtaken by Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.—also in the fray— in terms of revenues.\n\nAn analyst at a multinational brokerage firm sums up the Perot opportunity as “yesterday’s technology at an exorbitant price”. Dell is reportedly expecting $5 billion for the unit, while bids are said to have reached between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion. Also, Dell’s onsite-heavy IT services division runs on extremely low margins, and the business is hardly attractive enough to justify the pain it will inflict on TCS’s overall margins.\n\nThen there is the risk of integrating a company with a completely different culture. Thus far, Indian companies have hardly any success stories to boast when it comes to integrating large companies that are\n\nonsite-centric. TCS itself had a fair amount of success with e-Serve International, but it had an India-based offshore-centric business model, which is familiar territory for TCS.\n\nThe above-mentioned analyst says that TCS’s recent overseas acquisitions in France and Japan haven’t delivered desired results because of integration issues. But these acquisitions were worth about $100 million each. To have the same results with a $4 billion acquisition is a scary proposition, to say the least.\n\nPerhaps TCS is being egged on by reports that Cognizant too is in the fray for the same asset. Currently, Cognizant’s revenues are about $4 billion lower than TCS’s annual revenues of $16 billion. But there is a massive 10 percentage point differential in their growth rates, and if the trend sustains, in a year’s time, the gap will narrow to around $3 billion.\n\nDell’s IT services unit generates annual revenue of around $2.8-3 billion, as it appears from recent filings. In other words, if Cognizant ends up with the Perot Systems unit, it could well overtake TCS in about a year’s time. If the primary motivation for the deal is to claim bragging rights on relative size, it will be unfortunate for shareholders of these companies, especially if one of them ends up with the winning bid.\n\nThe deal hardly makes sense for Cognizant either. It already has a strong presence in the healthcare segment—Perot’s chief vertical— and it is still digesting the $2.7 billion TriZetto Corp. acquisition it made in the healthcare space less than 18 months ago. TriZetto also gave it an entry into the healthcare provider space, making one wonder what attraction Perot could hold for the company, besides gaining scale. But as pointed out earlier, this will come at a high cost.\n\nPrima facie, valuations look bizarre. According to Dell’s recent filings, its software services business had an operating profit margin of just 4.4% in the six months till July 2015. This translates into an annual operating profit run rate of around $125 million and valuations of over 33 times operating income. Considering that growth in IT services currently is being driven by new technologies, paying top dollar for so-called yesterday’s technologies will be a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe writer does not own shares in the above-mentioned companies."
