        "text": "Dell has agreed to acquire Perot Systems for $3.9 billion, the two companies announced Monday. The acquisition will join two power players in government IT, and comes four months after rival Hewlett-Packard acquired technology services provider EDS.\n\nPerot Systems will become Dell's services unit after the acquisition is completed, according to the announcement. The deal is expected to be completed within three months at $30 per share of common stock.\n\n\"The result will be the combination of two iconic IT brands who share a common vision of reducing IT complexity and total cost of ownerships for our customers around the globe,\" Dell CEO Michael Dell said during a conference call.\n\nPerot Systems' government services unit currently does business with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department and several other federal agencies; the vendor also provides services in approximately 1,000 hospitals. Dell is a leading provider of desktops, servers and storage to state and local government, the federal government and K-12 education.\n\nIT services will be a big part of Dell's strategy to transform the company, said Brian Gladden, Dell senior vice president and chief financial officer. \"We were very focused on getting a great anchor acquisition, which we believe we did,\" he said.\n\nDell and Perot Systems had a combined $16 billion in enterprise-hardware and IT-services revenue over the past four quarters, according to a press release."
