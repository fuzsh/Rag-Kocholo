        "text": "NTT Data Corp., a unit of Japan’s former telephone monopoly, has agreed to buy technology services businesses from Dell for $3.055 billion.\n\nThe acquisition was announced by the unit of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Monday. The company didn’t give a date for when it will acquire the Dell units.\n\nNTT Data will acquire the divisions to strengthen its footprint in North America, and enhance cloud service and business-process outsourcing, or BPO service, according to its filing. The company will hire the 28,000 employees located mainly in North America and India from Dell, according to the statement.\n\nThe acquisition would be NTT Data’s largest, helping increase its sales outside Japan, where a shrinking and aging population has stymied economic growth. Dell, which paid $3.9 billion for what was formerly known as Perot Systems in 2009, is selling some assets before completing a record deal — the $67 billion takeover of software and storage systems provider EMC Corp.\n\nDell plans to sell the division as part of a wider effort to raise as much as $10 billion from the disposal of assets that aren’t core to its business, Re/code reported earlier.\n\nNTT Data has spent more than 72 billion yen ($635.62 million) buying companies since 2011, about 62 billion yen ($547.34 million) of it outside Japan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Overseas sales had risen to 450 billion yen ($3.97 billion) by the year ended March 31, 2015, compared with more than 208 billion yen ($1.84 billion) in the 12 months to March 2012.\n\nGlobal rivals of NTT Data including Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Atos SE had also previously participated in an auction for Perot Systems that failed to generate a deal, according to the Nikkei, Reuters and Re/code, which all cited people familiar with the matter.\n\n“Perot Systems has a large base of U.S. clients in medical and other markets, so it fits NTT Data’s strategy to increase its presence there,” Hideaki Tanaka, an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley, said before the deal was announced. “NTT Data can win big contracts in Japan, but in the U.S., it is less well-known.”\n\nThe systems unit of Japan’s former telephone monopoly has more than doubled in market value since 2011 on rising sales to financial and healthcare businesses using the company’s data centers and software. Profit will probably surge 85% to a record 59.6 billion yen ($526.15 million) for the year ending March 31, according to average analyst estimate.\n\nNTT Data services are used at hundreds of hospitals and thousands of healthcare facilities in the U.S., according to the company’s website. The Tokyo-based company provides software and systems for functions including electronic medical records, surgery management, billing and insurance claims.\n\nDell acquired Perot with plans to expand in the fast-growing market for data services. Perot was built by H. Ross Perot, the billionaire who ran for U.S. president in 1992 and 1996, and sold his first major company, Electronic Data Systems, to General Motors for $2.5 billion in 1984.\n\nDell’s Perot unit has won government contracts for healthcare IT services and work for the Defense Department, NASA, Homeland Security and Education departments.\n\nBy Grace Huang"
