        "text": "Dell, which has struggled with flagging sales of personal computers and servers during the downturn, has bought itself a piece of the federal government’s stimulus pie.\n\nThe company said Monday that it would spend $3.9 billion in cash to buy Perot Systems, a provider of technology services that is especially strong in the growing field of electronic health records. The government is pouring $19 billion over the next five years into technology to help doctors and hospitals digitize medical records.\n\nDell and Perot were already working together on some medical projects, but the combination brings tremendous firepower to the task. Perot serves 1,000 hospitals  more, it says, than any other services firm. And Perot already helps automate the patient records of 200,000 doctors.\n\nWhile Dell has long taken a lean and focused approach to the computer business, devoting itself mainly to wringing the most efficiencies possible out of the manufacturing process, it has been forced to look for new ideas in recent years. The recession has hit Dell hard because it depends more than its rivals on sales to businesses, which have frozen their purchases of PCs and other data center equipment.\n\nDell’s largest rivals  I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard  are leading players in computer services, which provide a steady revenue stream that is less vulnerable to the fluctuations of the economy.\n\nDell is paying $30 a share for Perot Systems, a 61 percent premium over the company’s closing price Friday. Some investors found that price too expensive, and Dell’s stock fell about 4 percent in Monday trading to close at $16.01.\n\nA. M. Sacconaghi, a computer hardware analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said that Dell paid “a rich price.” But he said the deal was ultimately sound financially and strategically.\n\nIn Mr. Sacconaghi’s view, since Dell is flush with cash, putting $3.9 billion into Perot will earn more than the interest that money would have garnered sitting in the bank. In addition, the companies hope to eliminate $300 million in annual costs as Dell’s services business is consolidated into Perot Systems.\n\nThe combined unit will still use the Perot name and retain its Plano, Tex., headquarters, which is about 200 miles from Dell’s home office in Round Rock, Tex., on the outskirts of Austin. It will be run by Peter Altabef, now Perot’s chief executive.\n\nDell plans to help Perot Systems expand to industries and countries that it currently does not serve. At the same time, it is counting on Perot to increase Dell’s sales in the health care industry.\n\nMichael S. Dell, the chief executive of Dell, said that Dell and Perot would continue to focus on finding the most efficient way to provide services to clients, including providing services from centralized, remote facilities.\n\n“This is about expanding what we do for a large number of customers,” he said. Mr. Dell said that the company would look to acquire more services companies to fold into Perot. He added that Dell was also hoping to make acquisitions in other areas.\n\nPerot Systems was founded in 1988 by H. Ross Perot, the two-time presidential candidate. He founded another services company, Electronic Data Systems, in 1962 and sold it to General Motors in 1984. E.D.S. was eventually spun out by the car company and bought last year by Hewlett-Packard for $13.9 billion.\n\nAt the $30-per-share acquisition price, the Perot family’s stake in the company is worth $952 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg News.\n\nThe two companies have been both flirting and working together for several years. Dell was interested in buying Perot in 2007, but the companies could not come to terms.\n\n“We had no interest selling the company,” said Mr. Perot’s son, H. Ross Perot Jr., who is chairman of Perot Systems. “Michael is a very good salesman. His vision got us excited and got my father excited.”\n\n“It’s a little bit different selling to an auto manufacturer than to Dell,” he said. “And also, this is a Texas transaction. I’ve known Michael since the 1980s. Our families are close. The cultures are close. There is not a lot of mystery in this relationship.”\n\nHe added that Dell had a “test drive” of Perot Systems because it has used the firm to run some of its own technology projects.\n\nPerot Systems’ stock has bounced between $10 and $15 for the last eight years, in part because investors have been concerned about the tight margins in the services business. Perot also lost its largest client, the Swiss banking giant UBS, in 2007, said Joseph A. Vafi, who follows Perot Systems for Jeffries & Company.\n\nThe computer services business historically has involved high risks because the service providers need to buy and finance the hardware they use on behalf of their clients. Perot Systems shied away from that sort of big deal and sought projects in which it could manage computers it did not own.\n\nDell has stepped up its pace of acquisitions recently, buying about 10 companies in the last two years after spending its first two decades making no deals of note. The largest previous buy for Dell was in late 2007 when it acquired the storage maker EqualLogic for $1.4 billion."
