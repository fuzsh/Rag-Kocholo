Dell Services will provide IT to the Coast Guard under a five-year, $92 million Standard Workstation and Communication Infrastructure Support Blanket Purchase Agreement.

The Coast Guard selected Perot Systems Government Services, a subsidiary of Dell Corp., to provide IT field support services for critical mission and rescue systems.

The contract is an expansion of the work Perot Systems has been providing to the service for the past decade, the company said in a statement today.

As part of the new contract, Dell will provide IT support throughout the Coast Guard including at its eventual new headquarters at the former Saint Elizabeths psychiatric hospital site in Washington, D.C.

The Coast Guard will be the first Homeland Security Department agency to move into the new headquarters, which is expected to open between 2012 and 2013.
