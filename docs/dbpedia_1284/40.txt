Over the past 30 years, Eyemart Express's number one mission is to improve people's lives by helping them see better. Their businesses have grown across the entire country, and recently just opened their fifth Michigan location in Muskegon.

Eyemart Express makes it easy to make glasses in good time, with glasses being ready as little as an hour, at affordable prices. They carry over 2,000 frames in their stores, featuring brands like Coach, Michael Kors, Nike, and more.

Plus, every frame purchased comes with a one-year fram warranty including adjustments and repairs.

Eyemart Express is celebrating their grand opening in Muskegon with a special promotion. Customers will receive one free frame up to $100 with the purchase of any lens. They also are offering the cost of two pairs of frames for $38.71 for single vision, and two pair for $76.92 for progressives or lined bifocal.

Also, Eyemart Express is offering a 20 percent discount for all first-time responders, military veterans, and school staff.

The new Eyemart Express is located at 3355 Henry Street in Muskegon.
