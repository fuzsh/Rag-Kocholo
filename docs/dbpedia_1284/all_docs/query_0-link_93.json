        "text": "A leading value optical chain is introducing same-day, in-store pickup for online orders.\n\nOnline shopping with same-day in-store pickup is currently available at 230 Eyemart Express stores across the country. Customers can obtain access to the in-store pickup feature after they have made an online purchase at any Eyemart Express store. Trained opticians at local stores take a customer's measurements and input the information into an online system.\n\nThis process helps ensure that any glasses purchased online fit properly, and Eyemart Express customers will automatically see a curated selection of frames that are ideal for their prescription and lenses. According to Eyemart Express, which specializes in same-day service, it can often take up to two weeks for consumers to receive new glasses.\n\nAll online orders with in-store pickup are made in a timely manner by Eyemart Express lab technicians. Eyemart Express' internal IT team developed this new shopping option in-house, creating the company's proprietary platform and software programs.\n\nEyemart Express has been focusing on easing the process for customers to complete purchases across channels. In March 2021, the company launched a new \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) financing option that gives consumers a three-month, no-interest plan to make purchases, including frame upgrades like UV coatings and progressive lenses. Eyemart Express is offering this new BNPL option in partnership with payment technology platform Sunbit.\n\nSix-month and one-year BNPL interest-bearing plans through Sunbit are also available for Eyemart Express shoppers who would like more time to make payments. Due to state restrictions, Eyemart Express stores located in West Virginia and Wyoming are not eligible for the BNPL solution at this time.\n\nThe retailer allows shoppers to be approved for the BNPL option in as little as 30 seconds, and all in-store opticians have completed training to help ensure a seamless customer experience.\n\n[Read more: Eyemart Express sees potential in buy now, pay later offering]\n\n\"When you have a hard time seeing, any time spent waiting on corrective eyewear is too long,\" said Michael Bender, Eyemart Express CEO. \"Our customers can now shop from their home, office, or even a vacation, and see clearly immediately without the hassle of tracking a shipment or waiting weeks for their glasses to be ready.\"\n\n\"It was important to keep all the technology in-house to ensure a seamless user experience for our customers and our stores,\" said Keith O'Connor, Eyemart Express VP of IT and software development. \"We made it as easy as possible for shoppers of all ages to get new glasses using our in-store pickup option. You don't need to be tech-savvy or create multiple online accounts to shop with us.\""
