        "text": "Dr. Doug Barnes launched the first Eyemart Express in Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1990 to revolutionize prescription eyewear. Fast forward 33 years, and the clinic has expanded drastically, including a new state-of-the-art location at 5040 Frederica Street in Owensboro.\n\nEyemart constantly strives to offer accessibility with affordable prices and a 1-hour production time. The store on Frederica opened on November 6 and marks the first one in Owensboro.\n\n“Our team recognized a need for high-quality eyewear that can be worn home on the same day without breaking the bank,” said store manager Sarah Smith. “We are proud to be an easy and convenient choice for glasses, especially since people are short on time and watching their dollars.”\n\nSmith said their convenient and affordable turn-key approach begins with a comprehensive eye exam with optometrist Dr. Terry and goes through finished glasses. She added that they continually emphasize top-notch customer service to separate themselves from the competition in the retail landscape.\n\n“At Eyemart Express, we make it easier for time-strapped and budget-conscious shoppers to see clearly faster with just one stop,” she said. “We know most shoppers wear their glasses for at least one year, which is why our trained opticians provide personalized assistance.\n\nEyemart Express offers over 2,000 frame options from brands like Ray-Ban, Coach, Michael Kors, Versace, and Paw Patrol. Their goal is to provide a tailored first for both style and budget. They have an on-site lens lab with skilled technicians to craft glasses carefully, completing 80% in under an hour.\n\nThe store extends special discounts to veterans, military members, healthcare workers, first responders, teachers, and school staff. They also carry frame collections, where the proceeds benefit nonprofits like Stand Up To Cancer and raise awareness for the mental health organization PeaceLove.\n\n“We are thrilled to join the Owensboro community,” Smith said. “Being a good steward of this community is important to us.”\n\nThe Chamber Member of the Week program is a Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce membership benefit. Founded in 1913, the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce has worked to provide valuable benefits and services to member businesses and individuals for over a century.\n\nToday, with a membership base of nearly 1,000, the Chamber is a guiding force in community and business development initiatives, serving as the center of business advocacy for the Greater Owensboro region."
