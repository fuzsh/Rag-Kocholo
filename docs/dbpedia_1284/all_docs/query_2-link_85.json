        "text": "Eyemart Express Announces Innovations to Make Glasses More Accessible for Consumers\n\nEyemart Express is the first national value optical chain to launch a buy now, pay later payment option for more than 2,000 frames in stores\n\nOn-site lens labs and skilled technicians in every store can make and deliver high-quality glasses in as little as 30 minutes\n\nThe optical retailer’s stores continue to operate with the highest safety standards, including a mask mandate, sanitizing frames after each customer, and limiting the number of people in stores at one time\n\nDALLAS — One year into the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 52 percent of consumers are still putting off essential medical needs such as eye care, according to a recent survey conducted by Jobson Optical Research. That is why Eyemart Express, a leading national optical retailer, announces innovations to make quality eye care more affordable, convenient, and safer than ever, including being the first national value optical chain to launch a flexible payment option in the company’s store locations across the nation by the end of March.\n\nThe new “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) financing option gives consumers a three-month, no interest plan to buy the eyewear they desire from Eyemart Express’ selection of more than 2,000 affordable frames for the whole family. Brands range from exclusive in-house collections to designers such as Ray-Ban, Coach, Nike, and Disney. Flexible payments can also be applied to upgrades like UV coatings and progressive lenses. In partnership with Sunbit, Eyemart Express allows shoppers to be approved for the BNPL option in as little as 30 seconds. All Eyemart Express opticians have completed thorough training to ensure a seamless customer experience.\n\nSix-month and one-year BNPL interest-bearing plans through Sunbit are also available for shoppers who would like more time to make payments. Due to state restrictions, Eyemart Express stores located in West Virginia and Wyoming are not eligible for the BNPL solution at this time.\n\n“We are constantly focused on improving our customers’ lives by helping them see better with new glasses and now by relieving a potential financial burden with a new payment option. The Sunbit model is aligned with our convenience-focused service that makes the process of getting new glasses fast and easy. This partnership enables us to further our position as a leader in the optical space with our emphasis on the customer’s experience,” says Eyemart Express CEO Michael Bender.\n\nEyemart Express offers the most convenient experience for customers buying glasses. Knowledgeable opticians take precise measurements to ensure frames fit correctly, and all stores are equipped with on-site lens labs and skilled technicians so that high-quality glasses can be ordered and delivered in as little as 30 minutes. All glasses purchased from Eyemart Express also come with a one-year frame warranty that covers any adjustments or breakages.\n\n“No matter how our customers shop with us, we remove all the guesswork from buying new glasses. They shop with us at Eyemart Express because they know their glasses will fit the first time,” says Bender.\n\nFor those who prefer to shop online, the optical retailer’s e-commerce platform is available for existing customers. Trained opticians at local stores take a customer’s measurements and input the information into an online system. This ensures proper fit and provides customers with a curated selection of high-quality frames that are ideal for their prescription and lens type in case they want to shop later at home. Shoppers can also easily update prescriptions online over time.\n\nEyemart Express continues to operate all 229 store locations with the highest safety standards. The optical retailer disinfects all frames after every use by customers and requires all customers wear masks and practice social distancing.\n\nFor more information about Eyemart Express’ new flexible payment option and how the optical retailer is making prescription eyewear more accessible, visit EyemartExpress.com.\n\nAbout Eyemart Express\n\nEyemart Express (EyemartExpress.com) is a national optical retailer known for providing high-quality prescription eyewear with a focus on affordability and convenience.
