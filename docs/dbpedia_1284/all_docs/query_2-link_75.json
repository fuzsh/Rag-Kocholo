        "text": "A national optical retailer is opening its newest store in Gastonia’s Franklin Square shopping center and is looking to fill several open positions.\n\nEyemart Express will open in Gastonia on Monday, June 22. The store is the company’s 12th location in North Carolina and first in Gaston County.\n\nJessica Jones, general manager of the Gastonia store, said they are looking to fill 10 new hires for the new location. And more openings could be available soon.\n\n“We’re looking to grow and we’re looking to expand, so there’s definitely job opportunities with us,” she said.\n\nPositions available at the new Eyemart Express store range from lab managers to sales associates, opticians and lab technicians. The optical retailer provides a variety of training and development programs that help associates grow.\n\n“When we open a new Eyemart Express store in a new market like Gastonia, we want to be good neighbors by contributing as much as we can to the community via the local economy and finding ways to give back,” said Gianna Venturi, chief people officer at Eyemart Express.\n\n“We are proud to be growing and hiring at a time when many are looking for stable employment. We invest in our Right Team members and offer a variety of training and development programs along with our competitive benefits package.”\n\nEyemart Express has been in business since 1990 and now has 220 stores in 40 states.\n\n“We have eyeware for everyone,” Jones said. “Our passion is helping people to see. We try to make sure we have anything and everything to meet every budget and meet everybody’s needs.”\n\nThe 1,810 square-foot Gastonia store displays more than 1,500 frames from brands such as Gucci, Michael Kors, Longchamp, Columbia and Nike. The store also features an on-site lab so that 90 percent of glasses can be ordered and received on the same day — with a goal of having them ready within an hour.\n\nJones said they also offer a one-year free replacement on their frames. She said it’s been a popular selling point with customers.\n\n“Our goal is to satisfy that customer,” Jones said. “We want them to be family. We want them to come back and return.”\n\nA space next door is available for an independent eye doctor to rent, Jones said.\n\n“That opens up more job opportunities for the doctor’s side as well,” she said. “He has his own independent practice, but we kind of support each other.”\n\nYou can reach Michael Banks at 704-869-1842, email mbanks@gastongazette.com and follow on Twitter @MichaelBanksNC.\n\nWant to go?\n\nEyemart Express Gastonia\n\nWhere? 3916 E.
