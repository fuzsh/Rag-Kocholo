        "text": "National optical retailer Eyemart Express is opening its first location in Owensboro on November 6. The store will be located outside of the former Towne Square Mall, next to Zaxby’s at 5040 Frederica Street.\n\n“Eyemart Express is known for helping people see clearly in as little as 30 minutes with its convenient and affordable approach to eye care. At Eyemart Express, comprehensive eye exams and glasses can be completed in just one day,” the company said in a release.\n\nThe Owensboro store marks the company’s second location in Kentucky. A spokesperson said the new store will create a dozen full- and part-time jobs, ranging from sales associates to lab technicians and opticians.\n\nAccording to a release, Eyemart Express provides prescription eyewear with free same-day service, with more than 80% of glasses being finished in one hour.\n\n“Demand has grown in Owensboro for high-quality eyewear that you can wear home on the same day and won’t break the bank,” says Sarah Smith, Owensboro Eyemart Express General Manager. “Our stores are an easy and convenient choice for glasses, especially as people are short on time and watching their dollars. We make prescription eyewear accessible to everyone and every budget.”\n\nThe optical retailer carries more than 2,000 frames from brands including Ray-Ban, Coach, and Tory Burch.\n\nEyemart offers discounts to veterans, military families, first responders, health care workers, teachers, and school staff members on all eyewear purchases year-round.\n\nOwensboro shoppers can either schedule a comprehensive eye exam with Dr. Joe Terry, located next door to Eyemart Express, or they can bring in an existing prescription from their eye doctor. The optical retailer also accepts more than 1,000 insurance plans.\n\nEyemart Express will be open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. It will be closed on Sundays."
