        "text": "Every adult should get a comprehensive eye examination every two years as part of an overall wellness check. Even if you have perfect vision, your eyes still need to be checked for diseases like macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and cataracts. Anyone with a family history of eye disease should schedule eye exams more often (at least once a year). Our doctors uses the latest diagnostic equipment to assess your eye health and track small changes over time, which may lead to an early diagnosis. Retinal Photos are now part of the Comprehensive Eye Exam and are a great tool for comparing changes in the back of the eyes from visit to visit to monitor for eye diseases like glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic eye disease.\n\nWhether you’ve been wearing contact lenses for years or want to try them for the first time, Dr. Neumann and Dr. Stoffregen’s Practice offers contact lens exams. The exams allow Dr. Stoffregen to determine if you are a good candidate for contact lenses and, if you are, which type, modality, and brand will provide you with the best fit.\n\nStarting at six months, children should receive their first eye exam to assess their developing visual health. A follow-up exam is recommended around the second or third birthday. School-age children should also get regular eye exams to make sure their vision isn’t impairing their learning. Since young children are still learning to communicate, there are some signs to look for: •Excessive blinking •Covering their eyes to help them focus •Rubbing their eyes often •Squinting •Frequent headaches\n\nAs you get older, your risk of developing eye disease increases. Adults over 65 should schedule annual eye exams to check their vision and look for signs of glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts, and more. If patients are diagnosed early, they have more treatment options, which may be crucial to keeping their vision.\n\nAn annual examination at the optometrist is crucial to your overall wellness because it assesses your visual health. Even if you have perfect vision, you can still get glaucoma, cataracts, or other eye diseases, which often do not have symptoms until vision is lost. An eye exam looks for eye diseases before there are symptoms so you can treat the problem early."
