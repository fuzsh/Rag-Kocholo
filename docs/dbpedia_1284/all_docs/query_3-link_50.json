        "text": "Job Search. Hi y’all. As you all know, or maybe thought, there are several businesses having to cut hours or shut down because of “employee shortages”. I have been looking for a job for the last two weeks. In the last two weeks, I have applied to 142 jobs on Indeed. Only 5 of the 142 jobs that I applied to contacted me back, all of which I had an interview for and then never heard from them again. I don’t know how so many businesses can be desperate for employees but make no effort to get them. I have 5+ years of experience in customer service, retail, childcare, and every job under the sun in the restaurant industry. If you or someone you know is looking to hire, please message me. I am willing to learn any new skill I may need for the job and put all the skills I do have into play to bring value into your business. I have a strong work ethic, a genuine passion for everything I do, and am very dedicated to any work I am given. I have full availability and would like to have a well paying job as I do pay for rent and all my bills. I am more than happy to answer anymore questions or send you my resume. Thank you!"
