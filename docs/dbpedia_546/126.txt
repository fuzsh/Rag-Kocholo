The Commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Stephenson, is expected in the island today for a five day visit.

The visit is the first in a series involving prominent international crime management experts organised by the University of the West Indies, Mona and the Police Service Commission.

The UWI says the visits are intended to facilitate interaction between these experts and key persons associated with the transformation of the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF), allowing for an exchange of perspectives, ideas and recommendations on specific elements of the transformation process.

Sir Paul is scheduled to hold a number of meetings with key stakeholders in the public and private sector, the leadership of the constabulary force and also attend a symposium on the control of organised crime.

During his visit the UK police commissioner will meet with UWI staff and students engaged in research on policing, crime and criminal justice.

He will also meet with media leaders for discussions on issues and topics related to policing and crime.

Sir Paul has been a member of the British Constabulary since 1975 and was appointed Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service in January 2009.
