        "text": "He are his thoughts at a glance from his wide-ranging evidence\n\nI was taking no such swipe at the Prime Minister. I do agree with the Prime Minister when he says this was entirely different.\n\nWhat I was trying to get across was simply this: When Mr Coulson resigned he resigned ... to be the leader and to take responsibility. By definition he associated his name with hacking. That is simply and blindingly obvious.\n\nI'm just saying here and now that I made no personal attack on the Prime Minister.\n\nWhy did I not tell the Prime Minister before Wallis' name was connected with phone hacking? I would have no reason to. I am very aware of the political exchanges on the employment of Mr Coulson. Why would I want to risk anyone being accused of any compromise?\n\nActually a senior official at Number 10 guided us that actually we should not compromise the Prime Minister, and it seems to me to be entirely sensible.\n\nIt was my decision and my decision only.\n\nJust let me say, with the benefit of what we know now, I'm quite happy to put on the record I regret that we went into that contract, quite clearly, because it's embarrassing. I wasn't involved in the procurement process but I have to say I would not be discomfited by the fact that Mr Wallis came out of that process because I knew nothing to his detriment.\n\nThe owner of Champneys is a family friend connection. It was a generous offer, I paid for many treatments, it enabled me to get better very quickly. I do not think (it) was inappropriate in that circumstance. I think it was damnably unlucky, frankly, that it seems Wallis was connected with this and that was devastating news.‚Äù\n\nWhen I became aware that Mr Wallis was in some way connected with Champneys I thought that was a very difficult story. I think it was very unfortunate for me. I had no knowledge previously. I am completely baffled how anyone in the Met would have that information. I know of no-one who knew that Mr Wallis was connected to Champneys.\n\nIt seems to me - and it was a very sad decision for me - but in the run-up to the Olympics if there are going to be continuing speculation around the position of the commissioner and stories continue to distract, then if I was going to do something then I had to do it speedily.\n\nI didn't put pressure to lay off. They (the newspaper) were continuing to run a series of articles whilst I was given assurances that actually there was nothing new in this.\n\nThey seemed to disagree so it seemed entirely appropriate, I could understand that, that I meet with them and actually represent to them what I was being told and that is that this was nothing new and I had no reason to doubt the first inquiry.\n\nToday's almost certainly my final professional public engagement after almost 36 years of policing. I'm not going to add to my resignation speech - it was rather lengthy - and it's now a matter of public record.\n\nSave to say that contrary to much ill-informed media speculation, I'm not leaving because I was pushed, or threatened, I'm not leaving because I have anything to fear, I'm not leaving because of any lack of support from the mayor, the Prime Minister or the Home Secretary - indeed, up until the point of informing them of my resignation, their support was very strong and, afterwards, their comments most generous.\n\nLeadership is not about popularity, the press, or spinning - it's about making decisions that put your organisation, it's mission, and the people you lead first - it's about doing things that will allow them to be proud of their leaders, and this is much different than mere popularity.\n\nIt's about making decisions that may be difficult and personally painful - that's what leaders do."
