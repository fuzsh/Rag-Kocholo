        "text": "24 August 2022\n\nThe review was commissioned on 25 March 2022 by instrument of appointment given on behalf of the Home Secretary, containing the Terms of Reference specified in Annex 5.\n\nThe commission was given to Sir Thomas Winsor, WS. Formerly Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary.\n\nThe advisers to the commission are:\n\nChristopher Knight, barrister-at-law, 11 King’s Bench Walk, Temple, London\n\nAilsa McKeon, barrister-at-law, 6 King’s Bench Walk, College Hill, London\n\nDefinitions\n\nIn this report, the following terms and abbreviations have the meanings assigned to them below\n\nGLA Greater London Authority IOPC Independent Office for Police Conduct local policing body police and crime commissioner and, in London, MOPAC; in the West Midlands, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester, the mayor MOPAC Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime MPA Metropolitan Police Authority Policing Protocol / Protocol Policing Protocol made by the Home Secretary under section 79 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 section 38 section 38 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which enables a local policing body other than MOPAC to call upon a chief constable to retire or resign section 42 section 42 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which provides for the appointment of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police section 48 section 48 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which provides for MOPAC to require the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to resign or retire statutory removal process process under either section 38 or section 48, under which a chief constable or, as the case may be, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police may be required to resign or retire\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. By a special commission from the Secretary of State for the Home Department (“the Home Secretary”) of 25 March 2022, I was appointed to review the circumstances and implications of the stepping aside of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.\n\n2. My Terms of Reference of the same date set out that I am to:\n\nEstablish and assess the full facts, timeline of events and circumstances which resulted in the stepping aside of Dame Cressida Dick as Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis;\n\nEstablish and assess whether due process was followed under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 and other relevant rules of law and applicable conventions, having regard to their terms, purpose and spirit.\n\n3. These two aspects of the special commission are distinct from the third (below), and I have termed them together as Part 1 of my report. Part 1 comprises my findings in fact as to what happened, based on the evidence provided to me, at paragraphs 26 - 162 below, and my assessment of the conclusions to be drawn from those facts, at paragraphs 163 - 225 below.\n\n4. I emphasise at the outset the point made expressly in the Terms of Reference at paragraph 4 that my review “will not assess the merits of the performance of the Commissioner or the Metropolitan Police … the review is concerned with process, not substance”. I express no view in this report as to the performance of the Commissioner personally or the force she led, and I have not sought or obtained evidence which would allow any conclusions to be drawn on those points. Some of the areas of recent public and/or media criticism of the Metropolitan Police are referred to in my report where they have been raised, and they are of background relevance to my findings as to what happened and my assessment as to why.\n\n5. Paragraph 1 of my Terms of Reference further requires me to:\n\nProvide the Home Secretary with advice, options and recommendations on how accountability and due process in these respects may be strengthened.\n\n6. I address this aspect of my review in Part 2, in paragraphs 225 - 381. Although it is obviously contextually informed by the matters addressed in Part 1, it is in effect a free-standing and largely separate analysis of how the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 works (or does not work) in the context of the policing of London and the unique role of the Metropolitan Police.\n\n7. I have borne in mind that, as set out in paragraph 2 of my Terms of Reference, this special commission does not extend to a review of the operation of local policing bodies outside London, and I do not make any specific recommendations in relation to that wider model. However, I agree with the view expressed to me by a number of interviewees that my recommendations are likely to have implications for the legal model as it applies outside London – including in particular to other areas where the local policing body is a directly elected mayor – and it may be that the Home Secretary will wish to consider a wider review of the current model as a whole in due course.\n\n8. I address in Part 2 of my report the terms of service established between the Commissioner and the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime, and the interplay between those and the Commissioner’s appointment by Royal Warrant, as required by paragraph 3 of my Terms of Reference.\n\n9. My conclusions in relation to Part 1 are that:\n\n(a) Due process was not followed by the Mayor of London and the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime in their taking of actions which led, on 10 February 2022, to Dame Cressida Dick stepping aside as Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. The Commissioner is not an employee of the Mayor, but she was in effect constructively dismissed by him.\n\n(b) Those acting on behalf of the Mayor told the Commissioner that the Mayor intended publicly to announce his loss of trust and confidence in her, and that he intended to commence the statutory removal process, on the afternoon of 10 February 2022. The Commissioner was given a very short period in which to consider her position following that news. She was left in a position whereby she felt, even if others might have felt differently, that she had no option but to announce that she would step aside, in part to protect the Metropolitan Police itself. The circumstances in which she reached that view had been largely created by the actions of the Mayor and his staff. No good reason has been identified as to why such a resolution had to be reached on 10 February 2022 itself. The Mayor’s actions on 10 February 2022 failed to respect the dignity of the Commissioner as an individual, and as the holder of high public office. He did not act, in particular on 10 February 2022 itself, in accordance with the legislative scheme, still less its spirit.\n\n10. My conclusions in relation to Part 2 are that:\n\n(a) The role of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police is wide enough and needs no enlargement; nor is it appropriate or expedient to reduce the remit of the force to exclude its national and international functions so as to enhance the case of the Mayor of London for more control.\n\n(b) London is much more than the largest city in the United Kingdom; it is a national asset, the seat of the Monarchy, government and Parliament, the location of the senior judiciary, the country’s financial, cultural and technological capital and where what happens often has national and international implications; the primacy of the Home Secretary in relation to the Metropolitan Police should be maintained, whilst fully respecting and accommodating the role of the Greater London Authority and the democratic mandate of the Mayor as the head of the country’s largest local authority.\n\n(c) The terms of appointment of the former Commissioner are not consistent with the legal status of the Commissioner or the constitutional and legal relationship between the Commissioner and MOPAC; the accountability of the Commissioner is a function of statute not purported contract, and is not a master-servant, employer-employee one; future terms of appointment should be issued by the Home Secretary, not the Mayor.\n\n(d) The regime for the forced resignation or retirement of the Commissioner under the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 is sound, but material problems can arise when they are circumvented or violated, and where the terms, principles and spirit of the Policing Protocol are not honoured. In cases where a determined politician has created conditions which apply undue, oppressive and perhaps intolerable pressure on the Commissioner, in particular by making or threatening to make a public statement of no confidence irrespective of the grounds for doing so, or indeed without stating what those grounds may be, nothing can prevent the making of such a statement. It is therefore necessary for the political price of doing so to be as high as possible. I have specified several measures which could be taken – most of which would require primary legislation – to improve the checks and balances of the system to protect a Commissioner in such circumstances and make a Mayor think twice before engaging in inappropriate conduct.\n\nMethodology\n\n11. Prior to turning to the substance of my report, I set out briefly the methodology I have adopted in writing it.\n\n12. In relation to Part 1, I have sought to interview those directly involved in the timeline of events, essentially between 19 January 2022 and 10 February 2022. In essence, there are two ‘parties’ to these events. The first is Dame Cressida Dick, and her senior staff at the Metropolitan Police. The second is the Mayor of London, and his senior staff both in his office and in the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (including the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime).\n\n13. I have received extensive co-operation from Dame Cressida and the Metropolitan Police. The Metropolitan Police have provided, from the outset, a very detailed written account of the view of the timeline of events from those involved. All those with direct evidence to provide made themselves available to me to be interviewed, from the outset. I have interviewed Dame Cressida at length and on more than one occasion. I have also interviewed (then) Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball, the Chief of Corporate Services (Robin Wilkinson), Sir Stephen House (Deputy Commissioner at the time) and Chief Constable Alan Pughsley of Kent Police and Deputy Chief Officer Ian Drysdale, Vice-Chair of CPOSA (Dame Cressida’s formal CPOSA friends and representatives, who were present on 10 February 2022 to provide her with support). On 20 August 2022, I provided Dame Cressida with a gist of my proposed criticisms of her and have considered her response.\n\n14. Regrettably, I have not received the same degree of assistance or co-operation from the Mayor and those for whom he is responsible, notwithstanding the expectation of full and timely co-operation set out in paragraph 12 of my Terms of Reference. I first wrote to the Mayor on 7 April 2022 indicating that I would wish to meet with him and the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime. In subsequent correspondence I repeated my invitation to them, and to the Mayor’s Chief of Staff (David Bellamy) and the Chief Executive of the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (Diana Luchford) to speak with me. In total, some nine invitations to attend an oral meeting with me were issued. Not until 25 July 2022 did any response on behalf of the Mayor indicate any agreement of any person to meet with me in relation to Part 1 of my commission – and then only the Deputy Mayor and his Chief of Staff, but not before 15 August 2022 (after which the term of this commission would have ended, if it had not been further extended to 24 August 2022). I only received a short and high-level account from the Mayor of the circumstances leading to the Commissioner’s stepping aside on 24 May 2022, together with a small number of items of correspondence between MOPAC and the Commissioner, and no further material engagement on Part 1 until I received a response in relation to the draft findings in fact on 25 July 2022, late in the evening on the 14-day deadline I had set for a response. The response on 25 July 2022 to my draft findings was the first occasion, nearly four months after the establishment of the special commission, on which any detailed engagement with the timeline and facts was forthcoming from the Mayor and his Office. On 27 July 2022 I drafted and sent to MOPAC a letter identifying the gist of the criticisms I proposed to make on the basis of the information I had received. The initial response to that letter, on 29 July 2022, for the first time indicated that the Mayor was prepared to meet with me to discuss what had happened, for one hour and accompanied by the Deputy Mayor and his Chief of Staff, but only after 15 August 2022. A fuller response to the gist of the proposed criticisms was sent on 4 August 2022.\n\n15. I subsequently requested a further extension to my commission from the Home Secretary to allow that meeting to take place. An extension to 24 August 2022 was granted, for which I am grateful. On 17 August 2022 I met with the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor, his Chief of Staff and the Chief Executive of MOPAC for slightly over an hour and a half. That meeting was a valuable opportunity to hear the Mayor’s account of events and to test that account to the extent possible in the time available. I remain very disappointed that this degree of engagement was far too little and far too late in the process, and that I was not able to speak to the relevant individuals separately and at greater length. It is also unfortunate that a result of this approach has been that the Metropolitan Police and Dame Cressida have provided me with a detailed positive account, whereas for the most part the Mayor’s Office have simply responded to that account (where I accepted it in the draft findings) rather than providing their own detailed positive account.\n\n16. On 18 August 2022, I received a letter from the Mayor’s legal advisers seeking to reiterate aspects of the account given in the interview and to supplement it to some extent with further or clarificatory information. I have also taken that into account.\n\n17. On Saturday 20 August 2022, I received a lengthy set of legal submissions from leading and junior counsel on behalf of MOPAC, addressing what they had purportedly identified to be legal (and in some cases factual) errors in the gist of my proposed criticisms. No other party has provided legal submissions, but I have considered them carefully. Given the degree of revision I had been undertaking since 27 July 2022 when I provided the gist (in anticipation of the commission ending at an earlier point), many of the criticisms were no longer of relevance, regardless of whether or not they had any merit. Where the submissions were of potential relevance, I have sought to address them where appropriate in my assessment. However, I wish to reiterate my considerable dissatisfaction with the course of events: the legal submissions were provided over three weeks after I provided MOPAC with the gist, and three working days before the end of this commission. No explanation has been provided for this. It is very hard to escape the conclusion, considering the degree of engagement of MOPAC and the Mayor across the totality of this commission, that the Mayor only began to take this commission seriously when the provision of the gist made apparent to him that my report might be critical of his decision-making and conduct. That is a long way short of the co-operation which the Home Secretary, and I, expected of those involved.\n\n18. I have received a written account from the Home Secretary concerning her knowledge of the events in question, but it is clear from that account that she did not have direct evidence to provide and I did not seek to interview her or Home Office officials in connection with Part 1.\n\n19. In accordance with good practice, I sent a gist of a draft of my proposed criticisms in this report to those affected by them, and provided a short period in which to give any response. The effect of that on the engagement of the Mayor I have indicated above. I have taken very carefully into account all the responses I have received and made adjustments to my assessment where I have considered that to be appropriate. In the letter of 18 August 2022, it was suggested on behalf of the Mayor that I should provide a further draft of my factual findings and my conclusions, together with supporting evidence for them. As I had made clear at the conclusion of the interview on 17 August 2022, I did not and do not consider that such a process is justified or proportionate. The Mayor and MOPAC have had a detailed opportunity to respond, have taken that, and the process does not require repeated rounds of drafts or representations. No report of this nature would ever be concluded if that were the case. There would not, in any event, be time to do so before the conclusion of my commission. I am satisfied that across the commission as a whole, the Mayor and MOPAC (and indeed everyone else) have had a fair opportunity to provide me with all the information and evidence that they wish to, and to comment on any proposed conclusions which are critical of them.\n\n20. I have reviewed and revised my draft findings and assessment of those findings, where I considered it justified and appropriate, in the light of the written and oral information and submissions provided to me in the final weeks of my commission by the Mayor’s Office. It is neither necessary nor appropriate to comment on the evolution of my findings and assessment, save to emphasise that many amendments have been made of both minor and material matters, and that had the Mayor and MOPAC shown the same level of engagement prior to my reaching provisional findings and conclusions those earlier provisional views would doubtless have been differently expressed. At all times, I have reached my conclusions on the basis of the evidence available to me at the time, and where that evidence has changed, I have been prepared to change my conclusions – or aspects of my conclusions – too.\n\n21. Ultimately, I have formed my own view of the facts based upon the totality of the evidence provided to me. In substance, and as one would expect, large parts of the timeline of events and its detail were not in any material dispute. However, some aspects of the factual accounts have differed in important respects. Where there has been a dispute of fact, I have generally been able to attribute more weight to evidence by reference to: its consistency with contemporaneous documents (although I have received relatively few of these); the degree to which it is corroborated by the accounts of others; its detail and specificity; my ability to test it in interview with the person concerned, including their willingness and ability to answer questions put to them; and its inherent credibility and coherence. No single factor is more important than any other; each has been relevant to differing extents in relation to different aspects of the evidence. I have borne in mind that memories are imperfect and a person may have convinced themselves of an account which was not in fact correct in every respect. I have equally borne in mind that although notes of a meeting or conversation may be a good indicator of the content of that discussion, they have not been provided on a verbatim basis. I have also had some regard to the fact that police officers are particularly experienced in the need to recall with accuracy events and discussions subsequently, so as to provide evidence to the criminal standard before the criminal courts, although I have not accepted the account of any police witness on that basis alone. I have throughout applied the balance of probabilities standard.\n\n22. In relation to Part 2, I have interviewed a large number of people with significant experience at the highest level of: central government and the Home Office; local government, including specifically in London; and having responsibility for the Metropolitan Police and other major police forces. I have spoken to former Home Secretaries, a former Mayor, former Deputy Mayors and former Metropolitan Police Commissioners, amongst many others. In some instances, I have also received written views which I have taken into account. I set out in Annex 2 to this report a list of those interviewed in connection with Parts 1 and 2.\n\n23. I have not interviewed the Home Secretary in relation to Part 2: that would not have been appropriate where my recommendations are made to her, and any policy decisions she wishes to take having considered those recommendations will be a matter for her. I have interviewed Dame Cressida in connection with Part 2 as well as Part 1. The limited time I was given for an interview with the Mayor did not permit discussion of Part 2 with him, but I have taken account of his written response and what was said on his behalf in my interview with his Director of Strategy & MPS Oversight.\n\n24. The views I express in Part 2 are mine, informed by the extremely helpful and often divergent opinions and experiences which have been provided to me. On occasion, I describe those opinions and suggestions by way of synthesis but I have not named those who have expressed them. That has allowed participants to express themselves frankly, and I have found that frankness invaluable.\n\n25. I received invaluable support from Kellie McMillan, on secondment from HMICFRS, for the initial period of this special commission before her return to active policing in the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I have received legal support and assistance throughout from counsel, Christopher Knight and Ailsa McKeon, for which I am grateful. I have received legal advice on a specific subject from David Perry QC, for which I am also grateful.\n\nPart 1\n\nFINDINGS IN FACT\n\nBackground\n\n26. I set out below the findings in fact I make, on the balance of probabilities, in connection with the circumstances of the resignation of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. As I have noted in the introduction to this report, it is unsurprisingly the case that the vast majority of the facts set out below are not in dispute, or where disputes arise they are minor and immaterial. I accordingly set out my findings generally without reference to each of the many sources of the evidence I have received. There are a small number of material disputes of fact. Where these arise, I identify them directly, explain the contending accounts and explain which account I have preferred and why.\n\n27. On 22 February 2017, the announcement was made that Cressida Dick would be the next Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. She was appointed by Her Majesty The Queen on the recommendation of the Home Secretary, pursuant to the process set out in section 42 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which included the Home Secretary’s consideration of the views of the Mayor of London. At the time of Cressida Dick’s appointment, the Home Secretary was Amber Rudd, while the Mayor of London was, and remains, Sadiq Khan. Pursuant to section 42(2) of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, “[a] constable holds office as the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis at Her Majesty’s pleasure”.\n\n28. On 30 March 2017, Cressida Dick signed a document purporting to be ‘Terms and Conditions for the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, Cressida Dick’. This document was issued by the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime[footnote 1] and was counter- signed by Rebecca Lawrence, then Chief Executive of MOPAC, on 3 April 2017. The document stated that Cressida Dick was appointed to the office of Commissioner for a period of five years, from 10 April 2017 to 9 April 2022, in accordance with her Royal Warrant. I address the ‘Terms and Conditions’ from MOPAC in Part 2 of my report.\n\nAugust 2021\n\n29. In late August 2021, the Mayor of London had a telephone call with the Home Secretary, now Priti Patel, to discuss what would occur following the end of Cressida Dick’s five-year term. During early September 2021, correspondence was exchanged between the Mayor of London and the Home Secretary confirming that the Commissioner’s appointment would be extended for a further two years. That correspondence shows that the Mayor had expressed a preference for a three-year extension, to enable the Mayor elected in May 2024 to play a role in selection of the next Commissioner. However, the Home Secretary preferred a two-year extension, to April 2024, as was ultimately agreed.\n\n30. The reasons for this extension included the need for continuity and stability in the Metropolitan Police following the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, as the Mayor observed in a letter to the Home Secretary of 6 September 2021, “[his] expectation [was] that the Commissioner will deliver the priorities which will be set out in my forthcoming Police and Crime Plan, including preventing and reducing violence in all its forms … and increasing trust and confidence among London’s diverse communities”.\n\nSeptember 2021\n\n31. On 8 September 2021, the Permanent Secretary of the Home Office wrote to the Commissioner to advise that, having considered the views of the Mayor, the Home Secretary intended to write to Her Majesty The Queen to recommend a two-year extension of the Commissioner’s appointment. The Commissioner replied the same day, stating that, “[s]ubject to the considerations for Her Majesty the Queen, I would be very pleased to continue to serve as Commissioner for a further two years … up to April 2024”. The Home Secretary then wrote to the Commissioner on 10 September 2021 to “confirm [that] a two-year extension to your current fixed term appointment as Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis was granted by Her Majesty the Queen”. This was also confirmed in a Written Ministerial Statement of the same date.[footnote 2] Each letter confirmed that these steps were taken having had regard to the recommendations of the Mayor.\n\n32. On 15 September 2021, the Commissioner wrote to the Home Secretary and the Mayor expressly thanking them both for their support in extending her appointment until April 2024.\n\n33. Each of the letters of September 2021 acknowledged that the Metropolitan Police faced significant challenges which needed to be overcome. The Home Secretary’s Written Ministerial Statement specifically justified the extension as providing continuity for the force when facing “challenges”, which were identified as including “driving down violent crime, boosting the confidence of women, girls and ethnic minorities in law enforcement and responding to the concerns that have emerged from the report of the Daniel Morgan independent panel”.\n\n34. On 27 September 2021, the Metropolitan Police launched a new Strategy for Inclusion, Diversity and Engagement (STRIDE) 2021-2025[footnote 3] setting out how it would take action, together with communities and partners, to make the changes important for Londoners’ safety and confidence.\n\nOctober 2021\n\n35. On 2 October 2021, the Commissioner wrote to the Home Secretary and the Mayor to set out the plan the Commissioner was leading to build trust in police standards and improve safety for women and girls.\n\n36. On 3 October 2021, an officer serving with the Metropolitan Police Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command was charged by the Hertfordshire Constabulary with rape after having been arrested the previous day. That evening, a call took place between the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime (Sophie Linden), the Commissioner, and the Deputy Commissioner (Sir Stephen House) to discuss the case.\n\n37. The Mayor was particularly concerned that the officer had been in the same team as Wayne Couzens, who had abducted, raped and murdered Sarah Everard in early 2021, and been sentenced for these offences in late September. There was some discussion about how the situation should be handled, both in relation to the media and to the relevant police unit. At the end of the meeting, the Mayor said to the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner, “This is the last chance saloon. I worry about what is going to happen. You need to throw everything at this”.\n\n38. The Mayor spoke with the Home Secretary by phone later that night and again on the afternoon of 4 October 2021. During that phone call, the Mayor asked the Home Secretary whether she still had confidence in the Commissioner. She said that she did, but wanted to continue the conversation. The Mayor responded that two days previously, he, too, had had confidence but that this was now shaken. The Mayor and the Home Secretary agreed that they needed to continue to hold the Commissioner accountable.\n\n39. On 5 October 2021, the Commissioner published online a ‘Key Strategy’ entitled ‘Rebuilding Trust’,[footnote 4] setting out various steps aimed at addressing some of the challenges identified. On 8 October 2021, the Commissioner wrote a further letter to the Mayor setting out plans to rebuild public trust in Metropolitan Police standards and announcing that Baroness Casey of Blackstock would be leading a review into the culture and standards of the Metropolitan Police. On 15 December 2021, the Commissioner published a progress report on the Rebuilding Trust plan.[footnote 5]\n\nJanuary 2022\n\n40. On 19 January 2022, a trilateral meeting requested by the Commissioner in September 2021 took place between the Home Secretary, the Mayor and the Commissioner. This was the last formal conversation between the three individuals before the Commissioner stepped aside on 10 February 2022. At the 19 January 2022 meeting, the Mayor praised the positive work that the Metropolitan Police had been doing, particularly to address areas of public concern. He said that the Metropolitan Police was in the strongest position it had been in since the start of his mayoralty and that he had never had more confidence in the foundations for a positive year for the force. The Home Secretary also emphasised the importance of collective action between the three offices. In particular, she discussed with the Mayor and the Commissioner what they could do collectively to improve public confidence.\n\n41. The Mayor’s recollection of this conversation when he was interviewed in August 2022 was that he had been expressing confidence in relation to the Metropolitan Police’s action on tackling violent crime and similar matters. The understanding of the Commissioner and her team was that the Mayor’s comments had not been intended so narrowly at the time. The Home Secretary, in a letter to me dated 6 June 2022, recalled that the Mayor had “expressed the view that he had never had more confidence in the foundations for a positive year, noting specifically the Police Uplift Programme recruitment in London, the success of the Violence Reduction Unit in driving down crime, and engagement with health and education partners”. There is no suggestion that the Mayor (or indeed the Home Secretary) expressed any concerns about their confidence in the Commissioner on 19 January 2022.\n\n42. On 21 January 2022, the Commissioner wrote her weekly letter to the Mayor. She stated that she was “pleased we were able to meet this week, along with the Home Secretary, to discuss the work of the Met and the positive start we have made in 2022”. The Commissioner was “delighted to hear you talk about your confidence in the year ahead – that ‘all the building blocks are in place’”. The letter added that “You and I are in regular contact, and I hope that our bilateral meetings and correspondence are providing a clear sense of grip and progress on rebuilding trust”. There has been no suggestion from MOPAC that the Mayor wrote to disagree or correct the Commissioner’s understanding of his expressions of confidence.\n\nOperation Hotton\n\n43. Operation Hotton was a series of nine linked, independent investigations into the behaviour of certain serving Metropolitan Police officers between 2015 and 2017. Most of those individuals investigated were police constables serving out of Charing Cross Police Station. The allegations related to bullying and harassment; failure to report, challenge, or appropriately deal with allegations of bullying and harassment; domestic assault; misogynistic behaviour; drug use; the use of steroids and the failure to challenge or report this; the deliberate deletion of material relating to a criminal investigation; discriminatory actions and behaviour; and sleeping and engaging in sexual activity whilst on duty.\n\n44. The first allegation which ultimately fell within the scope of Operation Hotton was made in March 2017, the month before Cressida Dick took up her post as Commissioner. The Metropolitan Police referred the allegation to the Independent Office for Police Conduct who decided it should be investigated by the Metropolitan Police. The Metropolitan Police investigated but the Crown Prosecution Service determined that no further action should be taken in relation to the criminal allegation. The Metropolitan Police launched a conduct review, following which a further referral was made to the IOPC.\n\n45. The IOPC began its investigations in March 2018. One officer who was involved to a significant extent in discriminatory and highly inappropriate behaviour resigned in May 2018. Another officer was prosecuted for and found guilty of having made improper use of a public electronic communications network in January 2019 and was dismissed from the Metropolitan Police shortly after. As a result of the IOPC investigation, both of these officers were also subject to disciplinary proceedings conducted by the Metropolitan Police during August and September 2021. Charges of gross misconduct were found proven against both, with the result that both have been placed on the barred list.[footnote 6] Although these two officers had by then already left the force, others investigated in the course of Operation Hotton were still serving with the Metropolitan Police, and two had since been promoted. This information had not been made available to MOPAC by the Metropolitan Police at this stage.\n\n46. The IOPC did not recommend other gross misconduct proceedings, and of the remaining officers investigated for misconduct, management action or similar was provided to those in relation to whom misconduct (simpliciter) was found proven. For those who were found by the IOPC to have no case to answer, the Metropolitan Police either took no further action or required an undertaking of reflective practice. At this stage, MOPAC was still not aware of these details, nor that several of the officers investigated were still working for the Metropolitan Police.\n\n47. It was also unknown to MOPAC that two of the remaining officers had been promoted. One of those promotions, from constable to sergeant, occurred in January 2018 before the IOPC investigation commenced. That officer ultimately faced management action for failing to report or challenge another officer’s alleged misconduct. The second promotion occurred in 2021. The relevant officer had faced a misconduct meeting during Operation Hotton in connection with an allegation of deleting material relevant to a criminal investigation, but that charge was not proven against him.\n\n27-28 January 2022\n\n48. Having conducted its investigations, the IOPC began drafting a ‘Learning Report’ to make recommendations aimed at preventing similar behaviour. On Thursday, 27 January 2022, the IOPC provided the Metropolitan Police with a copy of the Learning Report and advised that this was to be published the following Tuesday, 1 February 2022. MOPAC’s Head of MPS Oversight – Governance and Professionalism was copied into the communication, receiving the report on 27 January 2022. The Mayor also saw the Learning Report on that date.\n\n49. This was the first time that the precise details and content of text messages sent between officers in WhatsApp conversations were revealed to MOPAC. However, the Metropolitan Police had briefed MOPAC on the outcome and rationale of the gross misconduct hearings in relation to Operation Hotton in September 2021. This briefing included references to the type of material contained in the messages, namely offensive and racist comments and images about women, Black, Asian and Muslim people, and people with disabilities. MOPAC had additionally received a written briefing in March 2019 which referenced a witness appeal that the Metropolitan Police was undertaking, in conjunction with the IOPC, in relation to Operation Hotton. The witness appeal document included descriptions of the behaviours of concern under investigation.\n\n50. The following day, 28 January 2022, the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Sophie Linden, sent a message to Assistant Commissioner for Professionalism, Helen Ball, asking to speak briefly concerning the IOPC’s impending publication of the Learning Report on Operation Hotton. The two spoke on the telephone at 11:30 and discussed the briefing of various individuals, including the Home Office, MOPAC and the Mayor, before the Learning Report was published. The Deputy Mayor suggested that briefings should also be provided to the shadow Home Secretary, Baroness Casey, and Dame Elish Angiolini (who had been appointed by the Home Office to lead a review of the murder of Sarah Everard by Wayne Couzens, a serving officer). In that conversation, the Deputy Mayor suggested that the Metropolitan Police ought to have ready a statement that the force should aspire to be an anti-racist organisation. She also advised Assistant Commissioner Ball that the force should know exactly where the officers who had been investigated (and who were still serving in the force) were currently working, and how the force was managing them.\n\n1 February 2022\n\n51. On 1 February 2022, the IOPC’s Learning Report was published.[footnote 7] It detailed the behaviour that had been uncovered among some of the officers investigated, including bullying and aggressive behaviour; ‘banter’ used to excuse oppressive and offensive behaviours; discrimination; toxic masculinity, misogyny and sexual harassment; and issues around challenging and reporting improper conduct. The Learning Report contained extracts from text messages communicated amongst officers in group chats that were misogynistic, racist, homophobic or constituted discrimination against persons with disability. The IOPC’s Regional Director, Sal Naseem, described the behaviour uncovered as “disgraceful” and “well below the standards expected of the officers involved”.[footnote 8] The Learning Report went on to say that:\n\n“The team at Charing Cross where we identified these problems has now been disbanded, yet we have seen evidence of this behaviour in subsequent investigations. We believe these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few ‘bad apples’.”[footnote 9]\n\n52. The IOPC acknowledged the work done by the Metropolitan Police to address these problems, including the Rebuilding Trust strategy, but stated that more needed to be done. In relation to the WhatsApp messages, the IOPC stated that “[t]he seriousness and frequency of such comments that went unchallenged suggested a systemic cultural issue that allowed the behaviour to pervade and persist”.[footnote 10] The Learning Report also observed, in general terms in the Foreword, that: “Although the matters we investigated occurred three years ago, we know through our independent investigations, the communities we engage with and concerns raised by officers and the wider public, that these were not isolated incidents.”\n\n53. The same day, the Metropolitan Police issued a press statement acknowledging that “reprehensible behaviour” and “appalling conduct” had been uncovered, and apologising for what had taken place. It was emphasised that such behaviour “does not represent the values of the Metropolitan Police Service” and that steps had been taken since to address it. The statement set out what had happened with the officers who had been subject to investigation, and what the force had done.\n\n54. Also on 1 February 2022, the Mayor issued a press statement expressing disgust at the behaviour identified in the IOPC report. The Mayor’s statement said that “the Met has set out the immediate action it is taking to rebuild trust and confidence”, and that he wanted to “assure Londoners that I will continue to hold the Met to account on delivering these commitments [that is, to taking steps for change] so that we see the changes needed and the public deserve.” The Mayor said: “It is right that the team concerned has been disbanded and the police officers found to be involved have been dismissed, disciplined or have left the police”, and that he had “been clear with the Commissioner about the scale of change that’s needed to rebuild trust with Londoners”. A press statement was published by the Home Secretary as well, echoing the others’ sentiments and stating her expectation that the Metropolitan Police and the Mayor of London would implement the Learning Report’s recommendations as soon as practically possible.\n\n55. Also that day, the Chief of Staff to the Commissioner spoke with the Mayor’s Director of Operations. The Director of Operations said the Mayor was frustrated and he wanted to meet the Commissioner to discuss the issues in the IOPC report. The Commissioner received a text message from the Deputy Mayor asking her and Assistant Commissioner Ball to attend a meeting with the Mayor.\n\n2 February 2022\n\n56. On 2 February 2022, the Home Secretary appeared before the House of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs. In her remarks, she said “there can be no excuses for the appalling behaviours we have seen in the IOPC report”. She added: “We are not seeing one-off instances. We have seen too many times, too many instances, where in policing we have just seen the most appalling behaviours, the most appalling conduct.” She said this “shows a failure of leadership in some quarters” and “there are cultural issues there”.\n\n57. On 2 February 2022, the Evening Standard reported that: “A source close to the Mayor said today: ‘Sadiq was furious reading the findings of this report and is deeply concerned this further damages … the trust and confidence of Londoners in the Met. These cultural issues aren’t historic but under the current Met leadership’s watch, Londoners need to see evidence that the Met is changing’”. The same day, PoliticsHome reported that a source close to the Mayor had said the Mayor would “call in Dick to explain how she will ensure that this kind of behaviour will stop” and placed responsibility for cultural issues in the Metropolitan Police with its current leadership.\n\n58. The Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner Ball travelled to the Mayor’s Office in Union Street for a meeting at 14:15 on 2 February 2022. When the Mayor arrived with his Chief of Staff, David Bellamy, and Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime, Sophie Linden, he asked the Assistant Commissioner to leave the room. She, the Deputy Mayor, and the Mayor’s Chief of Staff waited outside while the Mayor and the Commissioner spoke alone for about 40 minutes.\n\n59. Once that meeting was underway, the Mayoral Director of Operations spoke to the Commissioner’s Chief of Staff to inform her that the Mayor had requested to speak to the Commissioner one-to-one at the start of the meeting, and that it was expected that it would be a difficult meeting given the Mayor’s strength of feeling.\n\n60. No note was taken of the one-to-one meeting. The Commissioner has provided a relatively detailed recollection of what was said in that meeting. The Mayor has not provided his own account, but has responded to some specific aspects of the recollection of the Commissioner. Those responses have identified some highly material disputes of fact.\n\n61. During this one-to-one meeting, the Mayor expressed shock and anger about the content of the IOPC report. The Mayor referred to how the IOPC report reminded him of the attitudes of some police officers in the 1970s and 1980s, and he said that if he were giving a statement to the media today, he would have described the Metropolitan Police at that point as institutionally racist, homophobic and sexist. The Mayor asked whether the Commissioner would agree; she said she did not. She told the Mayor that she was also appalled by what had happened and that she accepted there was work to be done, but that describing the Metropolitan Police in those terms would not assist. The Mayor further expressed concern for public confidence. He made a broad statement that public attitude surveys were at rock bottom, and that he was concerned that it would be difficult for him to have confidence in the Metropolitan Police and, by extension, the Commissioner, after Operation Hotton. The Mayor has not indicated any dispute with the Commissioner’s recollection of these aspects of their meeting.\n\n62. The Mayor’s expression of surprise at the IOPC report came as a surprise to the Commissioner, and she said so. She explained that the Mayor’s team had regularly been briefed on Operation Hotton, which had in itself been running for four years.[footnote 11] The Mayor does not dispute this recollection of the Commissioner, although he has reiterated (as I accept) that he had not previously been provided with the detail of the contents of the messages in question, and that earlier reports had not referred to systemic cultural issues.\n\n63. The Commissioner’s recollection of what occurred next was that the Mayor said to her that she should dismiss all the officers investigated during Operation Hotton and that that was what the public would expect. The Mayor denies that he said this; instead, he says he explained that Londoners found it inexplicable that the officers were still serving.\n\n64. Following the Mayor making this comment in the private meeting, the Commissioner says that she explained the IOPC and misconduct processes to him. She told him that upon reading the IOPC report, he would see that in the cases of some officers, the IOPC had found there was no case to answer, and in some cases the misconduct was of a lower-level nature.\n\n65. The Commissioner explained that she had no power to act as the Mayor wanted; it would be ultra vires and she had to comply with due process. She said that to try to increase the sanctions or come to a different determination on guilt in the absence of any new evidence would be wrong, as would dismissing all the officers. She said it was important to comply with the law and to be fair. The Mayor replied, she told me: “Do it anyway”. The Commissioner said she was amazed that the Mayor, himself a lawyer, should make this demand since he must understand the importance of acting correctly. She added that if she complied with the Mayor’s purported direction to her, she would be successfully legally challenged, and that she must uphold the law. The Mayor replied, in the account of the Commissioner provided to me, that: “You’re wrong. Your job is to uphold the criminal law. Don’t worry about the civil law. Let them JR [judicially review] you. The public will support it.” The Commissioner replied that this would be irrational, particularly several years after the event, and would send a very bad message about how the Metropolitan Police was run. In relation to those officers who were still with the force, they had either received an appropriate sanction for misconduct or it had been found that they had no case to answer. The two main culprits had left the force through dismissal or resignation, and had been placed on the barred list. She was satisfied those were the appropriate outcomes and there was no lawful basis for taking any further steps against those officers.\n\n66. The Commissioner also explained to the Mayor when and why two of the 14 officers had been promoted. This information was also included in the Metropolitan Police’s 6 February 2022 briefing for MOPAC on all the facts of Operation Hotton. Nonetheless, in subsequent statements to the media (for example, on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on 9 February 2022), the Mayor maintained that he did not understand the outcomes of the Operation Hotton investigations, including the promotions.\n\n67. The Mayor’s recollection of the discussion in this meeting concerning the position of the remaining officers was that he did not understand why they remained in post, and that the Commissioner should seek external legal advice about whether there was any way to challenge the IOPC’s position in relation to those officers. He emphasised that challenging the IOPC had been at the core of his conversations with the Commissioner on 2 February 2022. It was his view, as expressed at the time, that she and the Assistant Commissioner should have challenged the IOPC in relation to the charges it had pursued against the other officers (that is, misconduct rather than gross misconduct). He explained to me that even if she knew there was nothing to be done and external legal advice said as much, this would have enabled her to tell the public in a credible fashion that she had done everything lawfully possible to hold all officers involved to account.\n\n68. In connection with his demand that the Commissioner dismiss the officers, the Commissioner’s evidence concerning the private meeting was that the Mayor had referred to the case of Peter Connelly (Baby P), saying that the Commissioner should act as the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls MP) had done in that case, regardless of the consequences in the civil law.[footnote 12] The Mayor had acknowledged that in that case the Secretary of State had had to make a large financial settlement to the public official who had been unlawfully dismissed, but that did not matter because it was what the public had wanted. The Commissioner recalls that he said: “You should do that.” According to the recollection of both the Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner, this was said again after the pair were re-joined by the Deputy Mayor, the Mayor’s Chief of Staff, and the Assistant Commissioner. The Mayor denies that he raised the Baby P case in connection with removing the Operation Hotton officers, or that he made the suggestion the Commissioner recollects. He accepts that some mention of the Baby P case was made in the one-to- one meeting, and recalls mentioning that he knew Mr Balls as a result, but he could not recall who brought up the case. As for the fuller meeting, there is no record in Mr Bellamy’s note of the Baby P case being mentioned, and Mr Bellamy did not recall any such mention. The Deputy Mayor denied that the Baby P case was mentioned in connection with the removal of the Hotton officers, but did accept when pressed that she could recall mention of Mr Balls.\n\n69. The Commissioner recalls that the Mayor stated, both during the one-to-one meeting and later, that if the Commissioner did not dismiss the officers, he would bring proceedings by way of judicial review against the Commissioner and the IOPC (although he did not explain what his grounds for doing so would be). The Mayor does not directly dispute this recollection, and the note of the fuller meeting with others present taken by the Mayor’s Chief of Staff goes some way to confirming this: it records the Mayor as stating that he intended to take legal advice on options to challenge both the IOPC and the Metropolitan Police.\n\n70. After these points were covered, the conversation then became less heated, and the Commissioner and the Mayor discussed the changes that needed to be made as well as work that was already underway. The Commissioner did not agree with all of the Mayor’s views but accepted it was a difficult time for policing and that the Metropolitan Police needed the help of the Mayor. The Mayor ultimately stated that they – the Metropolitan Police and MOPAC – needed a joint plan, which his team would help the Commissioner’s staff to produce, and the two teams should get together as soon as possible.\n\n71. The Assistant Commissioner, the Deputy Mayor, and the Mayor’s Chief of Staff then joined the Mayor and the Commissioner, and the Mayor’s Chief of Staff took a note of that meeting (which is not suggested to be verbatim, but which is detailed). The Commissioner explained what had been discussed in the one-to-one meeting, including – per the note – that “the Mayor had expressed frustrations including regarding the disciplinary process and the limited number of sackings of officers who featured in Op Hotton”. The Mayor then reiterated that all the officers should be removed. The Assistant Commissioner explained the IOPC’s processes, and noted that some of the Mayor’s questions suggested he believed officers who had sent offensive text messages were still serving and had been promoted. The Assistant Commissioner explained this was not the case; she identified the dates of the misconduct, noted that the IOPC had acknowledged the force’s learning actions, and pointed out that MOPAC had been copied into the communication by which the IOPC report had been sent. She indicated that the Metropolitan Police believed that the IOPC had reached the correct outcome on the disciplinary charges for all officers involved.\n\n72. Given what had been said about possible judicial review proceedings, it was agreed that the Metropolitan Police would send details of the case to MOPAC so that MOPAC could consider how such a judicial review application might be formulated. The meeting participants also discussed the difficulty of communicating the facts of the case and the outcomes of its investigation (in particular, the removal or resignation of the officers who had committed gross misconduct, and the fact that some officers had been found to have had no case to answer) so that the public understood them. The IOPC had acknowledged the Metropolitan Police’s learning actions. It was agreed during that meeting that the Metropolitan Police and MOPAC would work together on a joint plan for action, communications and engagement, as discussed in the one- to-one meeting, although the Mayor’s recollection – and the account of the note taken – was that the support to be provided by MOPAC was to focus on the communications aspect rather than the wider plan the Mayor wished to see from the Commissioner. The note also records the Mayor’s wish for the wider work to be “joint”. A deadline of 4 February 2022 was set for this to be produced. This deadline was not stated at the outset of the meeting but was established by a text message sent by the Deputy Mayor to the Commissioner after the meeting on 2 February 2022 and the following day in their scheduled bilateral. There was no discussion as to when this would next be discussed with the Mayor, including by reference to the bilateral meeting scheduled for 10 February 2022. The note of the meeting records the Mayor stating that Operation Hotton might be the ‘straw that broke the camel’s back’ regarding public confidence in the force.\n\n73. Towards the end of the fuller meeting, the Deputy Mayor asked about the Metropolitan Police’s position on institutional racism and anti-racism. The Commissioner explained that she did not think the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist, and would not be willing to change that position on the basis of the findings in relation to Operation Hotton. Nonetheless, she was clear that the Metropolitan Police was anti-racist and that she would be (and had been) very willing to say so. The note records that the Mayor commented that he “hadn’t previously known that the MPS was an anti-racist organisation”. It bears noting that the Commissioner had, however, previously made comments to this effect: for example, in a statement dated 13 November 2020, she acknowledged that discrimination and racism were issues that the Metropolitan Police had to contend with, but went on to say that “In the Met we have zero tolerance of racism. My job is to continue to try to eliminate any such racism and discrimination, however it appears”.[footnote 13] Similarly, in STRIDE: The Met’s Strategy for Inclusion, Diversity and Engagement launched under Cressida Dick’s Commissionership in September 2021, the ongoing determination was expressed “to eliminate such racism and discrimination [in the Metropolitan Police] as we maintain our zero tolerance approach to such unacceptable behaviour”.[footnote 14]\n\n74. At the end of the meeting as a whole, the Mayor said to the Commissioner words to the effect that “one or other of us is going to end up being substituted”. This was a continuation of a footballing analogy earlier used by the Mayor when he likened the current situation to being “5-0 down at half-time”. Both of these phrases are recorded in the note of the fuller meeting and they are not disputed. The Mayor explained that he had meant that these were serious issues that needed to be approached with a degree of urgency, and which might have an adverse effect on his standing for election in 2024 and the position of the Commissioner, which had been extended to run to the same date. The Commissioner told me that she understood the phrase as a threat to her continuation in office. The Mayor accepted in interview with me that he could see why she might have thought that, in view of his reference in October to “last chance saloon” and the decline in public confidence.\n\n75. It is apparent that there some serious areas of factual dispute which arise from both the one-to-one meeting and the fuller meeting at which others were present, which go in particular to the Mayor’s conduct and inform my assessment of the process he adopted. These may be summarised as being: (i) whether the Mayor insisted that the Commissioner should dismiss all the officers involved in Operation Hotton;\n\n(ii) whether he said that she should do so notwithstanding that it would not be lawful;\n\n(iii) whether he drew an analogy with the Baby P case and the actions of the Secretary of State in that context unlawfully dismissing a local authority official; and (iv) whether the Mayor threatened the Commissioner with removal in his ‘substitution’ reference. Other areas of dispute are more minor and need not, in my view, be resolved. However, I do make clear that I am satisfied that the Commissioner understood that the plan the Mayor wished her to produce urgently was to be jointly developed with MOPAC and that, at the least, that was a reasonable understanding to have reached from both parts of the meeting.\n\n76. As to (i), I find that the Mayor did insist that the Commissioner dismiss all the officers involved. The Commissioner’s recollection of the meeting was clear, and it is not surprising that such a demand would have stayed in her memory as being striking. It is also consistent with what the Mayor accepts he said, is noted as having said in the fuller meeting, and repeatedly said to the press subsequently: i.e. that he could not understand why they had not all been dismissed. Given that there were very good reasons, set out in the IOPC report, why different approaches had been taken in different cases to reflect varying levels of culpability, the reasonable interpretation of the Mayor’s repeated comments is that he believed that they should all be dismissed, regardless of their specific factual circumstances. If that was his belief, it is credible that he would have pressed the Commissioner privately to achieve that outcome. In interview with me, the Mayor expressly denied having threatened to remove the Commissioner if she did not do so – as was reported by the Times on 17 February 2022 – but that was not her allegation to me. On any view, a reference to removing the Commissioner – as arises under (iv) – was more subtle, implicit and not made directly or solely in connection with the sacking of the Hotton officers.\n\n77. I consider that (ii) and (iii) are closely linked. Ultimately, I accept the broad account given by the Commissioner. I do not need to make a finding on the specific language used by the Mayor, but I find that the Commissioner’s recollection of the substance of what was said is to be preferred. The Mayor spoke to her about dismissing the Hotton officers in a manner which made clear that he believed that she should dismiss them even if it were unlawful to do so, and that the Baby P case and the actions of Ed Balls in connection with it was a good precedent to follow. I reach that view because:\n\n(a) The Commissioner had a specific recollection of the Mayor raising the Baby P case. The Mayor did not. Rather, the Mayor recollected that it had been mentioned in the one-to-one meeting and referring to knowing Ed Balls, but could not recall who raised it and generally denied that it was in the context of asking the Commissioner to act unlawfully or indeed that he made any such suggestion.\n\n(b) The Mayor’s position on this is not tenable. The only reason anyone would have for referring to Ed Balls was in the context of his actions in the Baby P case. The only reason the Commissioner would have for raising the Baby P case – if she did – was because it was a prominent example of a person sacking an official unfairly and unlawfully so as to be seen to be ‘doing something’, and that the Mayor was asking her to do the same thing. No other explanation for how Baby P and/or Ed Balls could have come up in the discussion makes sense. It would otherwise be totally irrelevant to the subject-matter.\n\n(c) The response of the Mayor, that if he had made these points he would have done so in the later fuller meeting, does not assist either, because that is precisely what both the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner allege he did do. I do not accept Mr Bellamy’s note was a verbatim account or that it accurately captured everything discussed: the Deputy Mayor admitted that there had been some mention of (at least) Mr Balls, which the note does not record. There is, therefore, an accepted part of the discussion which the note does not capture.\n\n(d) Again, it is not credible that there would have been any discussion in the fuller meeting in a manner which caused the name of Mr Balls to be mentioned other than in the context of the Baby P case, and therefore in connection with a parallel between the unlawful treatment of Ms Shoesmith by Mr Balls and the Mayor’s belief that all of the Hotton officers should be dismissed.\n\n(e) I do not think it at all surprising that the Commissioner should have a good recollection of both parts of the meeting, given that it was a very important meeting to her both at the time and in the immediate aftermath on which she will have dwelled to a much greater extent than the Mayor.\n\n78. As to (iv), there is no dispute as to the Mayor’s language and he accepts that the Commissioner might reasonably have understood his reference to be one of him removing her from office, given previous expressions of concern. Although it is true that he might be ‘substituted’ at an election two years away, I consider it more plausible that the Mayor’s choice of language was intended as a veiled threat that if actions were not taken by the Commissioner in accordance with his concerns, he would act to ‘substitute’ her. That is the more natural meaning of the words used, including in the context of the meeting. The Commissioner had, of course, no power to do the same to him.\n\n79. The Commissioner understood from the meeting that developing the requested plan discussed was important. However, it was not made clear that this would be critical to her continued tenure as Commissioner. That only became apparent to her after a spokesperson for the Mayor addressed the media that evening and stated that the Mayor had put the Commissioner “on notice”; the Deputy Mayor texted the Commissioner with the full quote and also offered to speak with her. In this message, the Deputy Mayor reiterated the 4 February 2022 deadline for the Commissioner’s plan, and that the bilateral meeting the following day would be available for discussion of the issues.\n\n80. When interviewed, the Mayor explained to me that the deadline of 4 February 2022 had been imposed owing to the importance of trust and confidence to the ability to fight crime, such that a swift response was required. He assumed that the Metropolitan Police would have already started to work on a response well before the 2 February 2022 meeting, given their long-standing knowledge of the issues identified in Operation Hotton.\n\n81. At 17:20, the Mayoral Director of Operations sent the Metropolitan Police Strategy Director a quote issued to the press on the Mayor’s behalf, stating:\n\n“The Mayor and the Commissioner had a very frank discussion which lasted well over 90 minutes. The Mayor made clear to the Commissioner how angry he is with a return to the bad days of the Met of his childhood in the 1970s and 80s, and that neither he nor Londoners will put up with this. He has put the Commissioner on notice. He said the Met needs to urgently show it has an effective plan for restoring the trust and confidence of Londoners in the police and to drive out the culture of racism, homophobia, bullying and misogyny which clearly still exists within its ranks”.\n\n82. At 18:46, the Metropolitan Police Strategy Director messaged the Deputy Mayor to “check in with you about what we are working up following the meeting with the Mayor” and to “check we are on the right track with what we are working on”. A call was scheduled for 08:30 the next day.\n\n3-8 February 2022\n\n83. On 3 February 2022, The Times reported that, according to a source close to the Mayor, if the Commissioner was unable to restore trust, the Mayor would “have to consider whether she is the right person to lead the change needed at the Met”.\n\n84. That same day, the Commissioner and Deputy Mayor attended a scheduled bilateral meeting. Also present were Deputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House, the Metropolitan Police Strategy Director, the Metropolitan Police Chief of Staff, the MOPAC CEO and a member of MOPAC staff. The Deputy Mayor reinforced the seriousness of the Mayor’s position and the importance of developing the required plan. She suggested that the bilateral agenda be replaced so that the focus could be on trust and confidence. The Commissioner responded to this by saying the discussions on trust and confidence should only take five minutes. The Deputy Mayor again emphasised this was critical and a priority. Despite this, the Commissioner insisted on talking about the tabled agenda items first.\n\n85. When the meeting turned to the plan, and recalling the suggestion that the plan was to be developed jointly, the Commissioner asked what City Hall would be looking for from the Metropolitan Police. The Deputy Mayor said it was not possible to second guess what the Mayor’s reaction to the plan would be. However, she indicated that there would need to be acceptance in communications of the seriousness of the issues, including that they existed across the Metropolitan Police, and a ‘game-changer’ response.\n\n86. The Deputy Commissioner noted that a Met-wide approach was being taken to addressing the issues. This included Baroness Casey’s review and other specific measures. The Metropolitan Police Strategy Director asked if the Mayor wanted to increase the power of the Commissioner to remove people who did not uphold the necessary standards. The Commissioner noted that the current system took too long and took time to change. A number of actions for inclusion in the plan were also proposed and discussed at this meeting.\n\n87. The Deputy Mayor made it clear to the Commissioner and Metropolitan Police attendees that she would not be able to second guess the plan; it was for them to set out what they were doing, how they would acknowledge the severity of the situation, and how this would be communicated to Londoners. The Deputy Mayor stated that the language being used by the Metropolitan Police indicated a failure to understand the gravity of Londoners’ loss of trust and confidence in the Metropolitan Police. Plans to address this needed to be more externally-focussed. The Deputy Mayor clearly articulated the gravity of the situation and the need for a “game changing” approach from the Metropolitan Police. The MOPAC CEO also stated that this plan was about taking the whole organisation on the journey.\n\n88. Later, around 19:00, the Metropolitan Police Chief of Corporate Services, Robin Wilkinson, received a phone call from the MOPAC CEO, Diana Luchford, who emphasised the Mayor’s anger about what had been revealed by the IOPC’s Learning Report and the need for the plan to be very good. The Chief of Corporate Services asked for any further insight available and whether the Mayor had already decided that he had lost confidence in the Commissioner. The MOPAC CEO said that she could not say but emphasised that the position was grave. She stated that she herself was in a difficult position in terms of how to advise the Mayor, although she did not elaborate on this. The Chief of Corporate Services took this to mean advice both on due process and advice in relation to the consequences of destabilising the leadership of the Metropolitan Police.\n\n89. The Chief of Corporate Services followed the call with an exchange of messages in which he thanked the MOPAC CEO for the call, and said he noted and fully understood the seriousness. He asked if there was anything that could be done to pave the way for a constructive two more years, or whether it was “now an issue of when not if”. The MOPAC CEO responded that everyone wanted “a constructive two years…”, adding that this was why there was “worry about destabilising the Met”.\n\n90. The next day, 4 February 2022, the Chief of Corporate Services and Strategy Director for the Metropolitan Police worked with colleagues to produce the plan required by the Mayor, as well as an all-staff message from the Commissioner concerning her expectations in relation to professional standards and challenging poor behaviours.\n\nBoth drafts were sent to the MOPAC CEO during the course of that morning for MOPAC’s comment and feedback. The Chief of Corporate Services then sent a message to follow up and request substantive feedback, before calling around 11:00. During that call, the MOPAC CEO stated that the all-staff message was good; she had not had time to consider the plan carefully but thought it was too long and would require more external focus, such as a campaign or listening exercise “led personally by the Commissioner”. Given that the Metropolitan Police and the Commissioner had already conducted a number of engagement events across London, the Chief of Corporate Services asked the MOPAC CEO for her views on what else MOPAC considered appropriate for inclusion. Her response was that the plan was for the Metropolitan Police to develop on its own.\n\n91. The MOPAC CEO also noted that the draft plan contained nothing about communication of the outcomes of Baroness Casey’s review. She said it was a ‘red- line’ item for the Mayor that the Casey review should report to him directly, even though the Commissioner had established the Casey review on the basis that it would report only to the Commissioner. MOPAC emphasise that the ‘red-line’ was that the review should report to the Mayor in addition to the Commissioner. The Commissioner’s position was that it was important that the review be done ‘with’ the Metropolitan Police rather than ‘to’ it. The Chief of Corporate Services also asked whether the Mayor had already reached a decision on the Commissioner’s future, but the MOPAC CEO did not offer a view.\n\n92. Nonetheless, around 13:00, the Chief of Corporate Services spoke again with the MOPAC CEO to discuss the possible consequences for the Metropolitan Police if the Commissioner were to be dismissed.\n\n93. Later, around 16:00, the Chief of Corporate Services spoke with the Deputy Mayor and asked for her views on the current position. The Deputy Mayor emphasised the plan’s importance and that of building public trust.\n\n94. The Commissioner ultimately wrote a four-page letter to the Mayor around 17:00 on Friday 4 February 2022, noting the “full discussion we had on Wednesday [2 February 2022] about trust and confidence in the Met”. She wrote that she fully shared his concern, and recognised the seriousness and need for urgent action. The Commissioner acknowledged that “failures of officers and staff to abide by the high standards I expect, and that the public rightly expect, are plain and simply unacceptable”. She highlighted the multiple current and future actions planned by the Metropolitan Police to address the challenges. The letter concluded, “I look forward to discussing this further with you at the earliest opportunity”.\n\n95. Annexed to the Commissioner’s letter was the 16-point plan of action developed at the Mayor’s request which built upon the existing Rebuilding Trust strategy. Although the Mayor had, on 2 February 2022, indicated that the plan should be jointly developed, MOPAC had not provided any material input into the content of the plan submitted by the Commissioner on 4 February 2022. The Mayor received the letter and plan late on Friday, 4 February 2022, and read and considered them over the following two days.\n\n96. At 17:33 on 4 February 2022, the Chief of Corporate Services sent a message to the Deputy Mayor emphasising the Commissioner’s commitment to leading change within the Metropolitan Police and suggesting that a compromise might be reached in relation to reporting on Baroness Casey’s review. The Deputy Mayor replied the following morning (Saturday, 5 February 2022) asking that potential compromise solutions be provided by Monday morning.\n\n97. At 11:49 on 5 February 2022, the Deputy Mayor sent a message to the Metropolitan Police Chief of Corporate Services acknowledging receipt of the plan and asking to be talked through it. As a result, the Chief of Corporate Services met with the Deputy Mayor and the MOPAC CEO via video-call at 17:30 and explained the plan. The Deputy Mayor and MOPAC CEO wanted to know more about how the Metropolitan Police would engage with communities. They also raised the lack of mention of reporting on Baroness Casey’s review and asked when reviews into historic misconduct cases (as promised in the Rebuilding Trust strategy) would be finalised.\n\n98. The Chief of Corporate Services then asked for MOPAC’s feedback on the plan, but beyond the questions asked in the discussion, none was provided. The Deputy Mayor and MOPAC CEO stated that they had simply wanted to ensure they understood the plan but emphasised that it was a matter for the Metropolitan Police. This stood in contradiction to the agreement reached on 2 February 2022 that a plan should be prepared jointly between the Metropolitan Police and MOPAC. The Mayor explained to me that there had been no substantial feedback on, or joint development of, the plan because that was what the 10 February 2022 meeting was intended to be about. That meeting had been confirmed on 26 January 2022 as a regular bilateral between the Commissioner and the Mayor.[footnote 15]\n\n99. There was then a one-to-one conversation between the Chief of Corporate Services and the Deputy Mayor, at which the Chief of Corporate Services asked when MOPAC’s feedback on the plan would be received. By this time, it had become clear to the Commissioner and some of her staff that the Mayor might be contemplating her removal from office. The Chief of Corporate Services therefore said that planning was being undertaken for various scenarios, as if she were to leave office, the Commissioner would want to do the right thing for the Metropolitan Police and wanted her dignity, and that of the force, to be respected. The Deputy Mayor said that she was to have a meeting with the Mayor the following Monday. She later sent a message to the Chief of Corporate Services suggesting that they talk the next day to prevent “the scenario planning that you describe … lead[ing] to misunderstandings”. The two therefore spoke late on the morning of Sunday 6 February 2022. The Deputy Mayor said that no decisions had been made about the Commissioner’s future and emphasised that everything needed to be considered carefully. The Chief of Corporate Services expressly asked whether the Deputy Mayor expected the situation to escalate the next day. Her initial response was that she did not know because she had not spoken to the Mayor, but she then expressed the opinion that she did not expect it to escalate.\n\n100. Around 14:30, the Chief of Corporate Services sent a message to the Mayor’s Chief of Staff. He said he knew the situation was serious and hoped that the Chief of Staff had seen the further commitments and communications from Friday. The Chief of Corporate Services added that he had been in touch with the Deputy Mayor and MOPAC, which had been helpful, and he understood there was to be a meeting with the Mayor the next morning (Monday, 7 February 2022). The Chief of Corporate Services offered a conversation if that would be useful. The Mayor’s Chief of Staff responded saying that: “I have seen Cress’ letter to Sadiq and her message to staff and I know Sadiq has too. I will speak to Sadiq about this on Monday … Thanks for reaching out, let’s keep in touch …”. The Chief of Corporate Services responded that there were “a range of options” and there was “resolution here to act – and of course a strong sense of duty in doing the right thing”.\n\n101. Shortly before 20:00, having consulted with Assistant Commissioner Ball, the Chief of Corporate Services sent the Deputy Mayor and the MOPAC CEO a briefing on Operation Hotton for the Deputy Mayor to consider giving to the Mayor. This responded directly to a number of incorrect statements the Metropolitan Police believed that the Mayor had publicly made. The Chief of Corporate Services also sent a proposal concerning reporting on Baroness Casey’s review, including six-weekly structured meetings between the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor, the Commissioner, and Baroness Casey.\n\n102. On the morning of 7 February 2022, the Home Secretary’s office asked for a call with the Commissioner to discuss public confidence following Operation Hotton, as well as the latest data on tackling serious violence. This call was scheduled to take place at midday.\n\n103. By this point, the Metropolitan Police had received from the Mayor no substantive feedback on the plan sent on 4 February 2022; the only feedback had been the Deputy Mayor’s personal views on some aspects at the weekend. Around 16:15, the Metropolitan Police Chief of Corporate Services sent a message to the Deputy Mayor to ask if there would be any feedback on the plan or wider issues. He sent a similar message to the MOPAC CEO shortly before 18:00. The Deputy Mayor replied at 18:45 that there would be none that day, while the MOPAC CEO’s response was that the Mayor was still considering the plan so there was no feedback to give at that point. These responses are not consistent with the Mayor’s indication to me in interview that it was never the intention to provide any substantive feedback in advance of the 10 February meeting: if that had been the case, I would have expected the Deputy Mayor and/or the MOPAC CEO to make that point in terms.\n\n104. On the morning of 8 February 2022, the Home Secretary’s office contacted the Commissioner’s office to arrange a bilateral meeting between the Home Secretary and the Commissioner, to take place on 10 February 2022 from 12:30 to 13:00. This would cover the work done by the Metropolitan Police to rebuild trust as well as its performance in tackling crime. However, this meeting was cancelled at short notice by the Commissioner and, at the time, the Home Secretary was not informed why.\n\n105. Later in the day, the Metropolitan Police Chief of Corporate Services spoke with the MOPAC CEO over the telephone, seeking feedback on the plan and an indication of the Mayor’s thinking, including as to his confidence in the Commissioner. The MOPAC CEO gave no substantive response, saying that she had not seen the Mayor and did not know; it was a matter for the Mayor.\n\n106. The Metropolitan Police Press Office then learned that the Mayor was planning media interviews for the following day, 9 February 2022. The Chief of Corporate Services sent a message to the MOPAC CEO saying that the inference to be drawn from MOPAC’s silence on the plan was that the Mayor was likely to say that week that he no longer had confidence in the Commissioner. The MOPAC CEO said the Deputy Mayor would ring the Commissioner.\n\n107. During the evening of 8 February 2022, the Deputy Mayor called the Commissioner and sought to reassure her about the media interviews planned for the following morning, including on Radio 4’s Today programme. The Deputy Mayor explained that the Mayor would be talking about his mentoring proposals and would not offer any new information about the Metropolitan Police or the Commissioner. She said she did not know what the Mayor thought of the plan. The Commissioner pressed the Deputy Mayor on whether the Mayor was going to say anything the next day about her position. The Deputy Mayor insisted that the Mayor would not be talking about the Commissioner’s position, and said “this is not an ambush”. She said “your dignity is paramount in the coming days, weeks and months and it will be respected”. She said the Mayor would not be discussing the plan because he had not yet fully absorbed it. The Commissioner asked about the Mayor’s views on the post-Hotton remedial plan. The Deputy Mayor first said she had not seen the Mayor, and then that she had but had not discussed the plan so she did not know what he thought of it. The Commissioner’s recollection of this conversation has not been materially disputed by the Deputy Mayor.\n\n108. At 19:05, the Mayor’s Chief of Staff sent a message to the Metropolitan Police Chief of Corporate Services referring to the call between the Deputy Mayor and Commissioner. The Chief of Corporate Services responded that the Commissioner had “been assured by Sophie [Linden, the Deputy Mayor] that the Mayor is not planning on saying anything negative about Cress tomorrow in the media”.\n\n9 February 2022\n\n109. On the morning of 9 February 2022, the Mayor participated in a scheduled interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Without prior notice, the Today programme chose to lead with questions about the Commissioner. No other outlet with which the Mayor spoke that morning did this – they all led with the mentoring scheme which had been the agreed topic of discussion.\n\n110. The Mayor responded to the questions he was asked by saying that, the next time he saw the Commissioner, he wanted “to see what her response is the examples of not one officer, of 14 officers being involved in racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and the like behaviour, nine of whom are still serving, and secondly, what her plans are to win back the trust and confidence that’s both been knocked and shattered as a consequence of these cases”. He went on: “In the words of the IOPC, … these cases aren’t historic, they’re not isolated, and that’s why it’s important for the Commissioner, when I next see her, to answer me those two big questions”. The Mayor added that “Londoners can’t understand why nine of the 14 police officers are still serving … two of them have been promoted”. When asked if he had confidence in the Commissioner, the Mayor responded: “That will be contingent on the response from the Commissioner the next time I see her”. He added, “Anybody who works for me who hasn’t got my trust and confidence, or more importantly, hasn’t got the trust and confidence of Londoners, I won’t keep silent about that, I will take action” and that “I believe in due process. I think it is only fair for me to allow the Commissioner to come back and answer the two big questions I’ve got …”. The Mayor concluded this part of the interview by reiterating that, “If it’s the case that I no longer have trust and confidence in anybody who works for me, I’ll make that quite clear and take action”.\n\n111. Also on 9 February 2022, the Mayor was interviewed on ITV. He said: “What we saw in Charing Cross wasn’t one officer – it was 14 officers behaving in an unacceptable way. I have been clear to Dick. She needs to show she understands how serious this is, and has a plan. She needs to deal with trust and confidence which has been knocked and shattered.” He was asked if he would “get rid of” the Commissioner. His response was: “I have been quite clear in terms of my expectations. I believe in due process. Let’s see what she comes back to me with”.\n\n112. When asked in August 2022 why he did not close down questions about the Commissioner, the Mayor’s response was that it was effectively impossible to do so on the Today programme; having done so would have caused difficulties for the Commissioner; and it was his statutory responsibility to hold the Commissioner to account. He had been clear there would be due process, and had referred to “days and weeks” during his media appearances because he thought he and the Commissioner could resolve the issues. He did not want to say that he had seen the draft plan or lacked confidence, because he and the Commissioner were to meet about this on 10 February, but he also did not wish to telegraph to the wider world precisely when that discussion would occur. Having read the draft plan after receiving it on 4 February, however, he could not unequivocally say that she had his full trust and confidence. When asked whether this was because to say that would have been untrue, the Mayor said that he could not go back in time and that, had he been asked whether he had confidence in the Commissioner on 9 February 2022, he did not know what his mind would have been. I did not find this answer credible: the Mayor must have known where his confidence in the Commissioner stood, even if he was not prepared to state it publicly.\n\n113. Again on 9 February 2022, an article in The Guardian said: “a Whitehall source made clear if he [the Mayor] declares he lacks confidence in Dick, they would not fight to save her. ‘This is his call and his decision,’ said the source.” The article stated that, according to a Whitehall source, “… there is [no] way if the mayor of London says he has no confidence in the commissioner that her position is tenable. It would not be for us to intervene or say anything. If Sadiq Khan comes out and says the Commissioner should go, it is within his competency to say that, in the same way any other PCC could”. The newspaper did not identify the Whitehall source.\n\n114. A regular bilateral meeting was due to take place between the Mayor and the Commissioner on 10 February 2022 for one hour from 16:00. On 26 January 2022, the Mayor’s office had communicated with the Commissioner’s office requesting that the meeting take place at New Scotland Yard. The Commissioner’s office confirmed New Scotland Yard as the venue for the meeting. However, at some point on or around 9 February 2022, the Mayor’s office said that the meeting should take place at Union Street instead.\n\n115. When asked in August 2022 why the meeting location had been changed, the Mayor said that it had not, and that his diaries published online would confirm this. The Mayor’s Chief of Staff emphasised that, leaving aside the pandemic, the Mayor’s meetings always took place at City Hall, unless there was a reason to do otherwise (as information sent to me by MOPAC had also stated). However, later in the same meeting, the Deputy Mayor said that the Metropolitan Police’s Chief of Corporate Services had told her that the Commissioner’s team had believed that Union Street (where City Hall was at the time) was being used as the venue for the meeting so as to allow the media to be invited.\n\n116. That comment and the belief it outlined (which was also set out to me by those who were present with the Commissioner at New Scotland Yard on 10 February 2022) support the position of the Commissioner’s team that the meeting location was moved to Union Street at the request of the Mayor’s office. Similarly, commentary from MOPAC on my draft factual findings for the purposes of this commission explained that “The reason that the diary invite [for 10 February 2022] was not changed [from New Scotland Yard to City Hall] was to protect the confidentiality of the Commissioner’s whereabouts”. The Mayor’s diaries as published online go only as far as April 2021 and I have not been provided with any current material; as the foregoing demonstrates, the published diaries do not always show the final picture in any event. The diaries published from before the COVID-19 pandemic show that the bilateral meetings were held both at City Hall and at New Scotland Yard, although significantly more at the former than the latter. I am satisfied that the meeting venue was changed to City Hall in Union Street at a late stage.\n\n117. Just before 19:00 on 9 February 2022, the Deputy Mayor spoke with the Metropolitan Police’s Chief of Corporate Services on the phone. During this 20-minute conversation, the Deputy Mayor said the Mayor wanted to discuss the plan with the Commissioner at their meeting the following day. The Chief of Corporate Services said, having regard to what the Mayor had said in media interviews that day, it was clear he intended to escalate matters. The Deputy Mayor said she was surprised at this conclusion as he had said nothing more than he had said the previous week. The Chief of Corporate Services challenged this and indicated that the Mayor had made incorrect or misleading statements in the media about not having received the plan and in relation to Operation Hotton. The Deputy Mayor said the Mayor was angry about the case and intended to bring judicial review proceedings against the Metropolitan Police and the IOPC.\n\n118. When asked if the plan was ‘in the right place’, the Deputy Mayor said the Commissioner would have to discuss it with the Mayor when they met the next day. The Chief of Corporate Services said it was unacceptable not to have any feedback on the plan before that meeting. It had been prepared in quick time to meet a deadline set by the Mayor. The Chief of Corporate Services asked if a view had been reached already by the Mayor. The Deputy Mayor said the Commissioner would have to discuss it with the Mayor.\n\n119. The Chief of Corporate Services asked if there would be media outside Union Street when the bilateral meeting was taking place. The Deputy Mayor said City Hall would not be briefing the media about the meeting. The Chief of Corporate Services asked if the meeting could be moved back to New Scotland Yard, but was told that the Mayor was clear he wanted the meeting to take place at Union Street.\n\n120. The Chief of Corporate Services asked the Deputy Mayor if the Mayor had concluded that he had lost confidence in the Commissioner and whether he intended to announce that the next day. The Deputy Mayor replied that the Commissioner would have to discuss it with the Mayor. The Chief of Corporate Services reiterated that the position was unacceptable. The Mayor had chosen to provide no feedback on the plan ahead of what was an important meeting and had escalated matters in the media. Moreover, he said that if the Mayor’s intent the next day was to tell the Commissioner he no longer had trust and confidence in her (and to do so in the media), that would be utterly wrong and not in line with due process or respect for the Commissioner’s dignity. The Chief of Corporate Services made this point on three occasions, after which the Deputy Mayor said she had heard it and would ‘take it away’. Neither MOPAC nor the Deputy Mayor dispute this account of the conversation, or the views expressed by the Chief of Corporate Services as to the need for the Commissioner to have some indication of the Mayor’s view as to her position.\n\n10 February 2022\n\n121. On the morning of 10 February 2022, the Commissioner was interviewed on BBC Radio London in a regular and pre-arranged slot. There, she explained the IOPC’s investigation in Operation Hotton and the outcomes for the officers involved. She acknowledged that this and other unacceptable things had happened, but emphasised that she was “absolutely determined to be getting out there and rooting out any further individuals”. She also stated that she “expected to be held to account; it’s a big job and I’m quite used to being asked to account for things and I will go on doing so in the future”. The Commissioner stated, in answer to a question, that she had “absolutely no intention of going and I believe that I am, and have been actually for the last five years, leading a real transformation in the Met”. Finally, she acknowledged that her position depended “absolutely on those two role holders, the Mayor of London and the Home Secretary, holding me to account. It depends yes on them having trust and confidence in me. They extended my contract just a few months ago. I sat at a meeting with them just three weeks ago at which the Mayor said he had never had more confidence in the Met’s ability to deliver”. She had “been asked to send another plan to the Mayor, which I did last Friday, and I’m looking forward to discussing it with him”. Callers to the Radio London show that day repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the Metropolitan Police.\n\n122. Around 11:15 on 10 February 2022, the Deputy Mayor called and spoke with the Chief of Corporate Services, who asked what the intention was for the planned bilateral meeting that day. MOPAC record that this call was prompted by indications that the Commissioner might not attend the meeting with the Mayor that afternoon. The Deputy Mayor advised the Chief of Corporate Services that the meeting should proceed and assured him this would be a private meeting. At this point, the Deputy Mayor provided the Mayor’s first feedback on the plan. She said the Mayor thought the all-staff message was good, but he was not satisfied with the plan. He did not consider it provided sufficient assurance that the Commissioner accepted the scale of the problem. She said that the Mayor considered the plan to be too internally focused: there was not enough about winning back the trust and confidence of Londoners. The Deputy Mayor said the Commissioner would have to work hard to convince the Mayor on these points at the meeting scheduled for 16:00. The Chief of Corporate Services asked if there was any possibility of the Mayor being satisfied by what the Commissioner could say in the meeting. She replied that “it is a possibility he will not be satisfied”.\n\n123. The Chief of Corporate Services asked her for further assurances on the framing of the meeting and what the plans would be for after the meeting. The Deputy Mayor replied that these matters would need to be dealt with in the meeting. The Chief of Corporate Services said this was unacceptable and unreasonable; it was vital there would be some pre-work to create the conditions for a constructive discussion.\n\n124. He also asked about media. The Deputy Mayor said that no media was planned and that the meeting was still shown in City Hall diaries as taking place at New Scotland Yard. At that point, the Mayor’s office had already written to the Metropolitan Police to confirm the change of location to Union Street. The Chief of Corporate Services explained his view that it was unacceptable, inappropriate and wrong not to have a back-channel open at this time to understand what was happening and seek a way forward.\n\n125. There were further communications between the Chief of Corporate Services and the Deputy Mayor seeking clarification and engagement before the later bilateral meeting. No substantive response from MOPAC was received.\n\n126. Meanwhile, the Home Secretary’s office was informed that the Commissioner would not be able to attend their scheduled bilateral meeting that day. An alternative time was to be arranged.\n\n127. Owing to increasing concerns within the Commissioner’s office, on or around 9 February 2022 the Commissioner had made contact with the Chief Police Officers’ Staff Association (“CPOSA”). CPOSA instructed Corinne Aldridge of Kingsley Napley to attend at New Scotland Yard to provide legal advice in relation to the Commissioner’s position. Also present were Alan Pughsley, Chief Constable of Kent, and Ian Drysdale, Deputy Chief Officer for Kent and Vice-Chair of CPOSA. Mr Pughsley attended as ‘CPOSA Friend’ to the Commissioner (i.e. an informal advisor and an equivalent to a union representative).\n\n128. At 12:58, in advance of the meeting scheduled for 16:00 that day, the Commissioner wrote to the Mayor referring to the “ambitious programme of work I am leading on trust and confidence and the plan I sent to you last Friday, 4th February”. This letter was written “in view of [the Mayor’s] extensive comments in the media yesterday which related to [the Commissioner]”, by which she had been “very surprised … because of the assurances from your Deputy Mayor Sophie Linden … that this would not be the case”. The Commissioner was “concerned to ensure that there is a suitable basis for a constructive meeting and one that it [sic] is in the interests of sustaining good operational performance in the Met. This is my intention and I would like to understand that it is yours ahead of any meeting”. The Commissioner added that she was “deeply concerned by the implication of a number of comments – as reported – including that you had yet to receive the plan of action we’re taking”. By then, the Mayor had had the plan for several days, and had read it over the weekend.\n\n129. The Commissioner observed that the plan, which built upon existing strategies, had been sent and that her team had attempted to engage with the Deputy Mayor and MOPAC CEO about this on numerous occasions: “Since sending the Plan, we have been seeking feedback from your team all this week given the urgency I attach to it. To date, none has yet been formally received … [Y]our views are critical in how we can move forward”. The Commissioner noted she was “disappointed that the briefing we have provided to your senior team was not reflected in the comments you made in the media yesterday” and that no formal feedback had been received despite requests.\n\n130. The Commissioner’s letter continued: “Six months ago you gave me the mandate to continue the work I’ve been leading”, adding that “My contract extension provides a further two years to finish the job …”. However, the Commissioner observed, “I can only effectively perform my role with your continued support and your full confidence” and stated, in view of the media reporting and lack of feedback, “I need to be clear what your position is”. The letter concluded by requesting a meeting between senior colleagues from the Metropolitan Police and City Hall to identify the issues existing between the Commissioner and the Mayor in advance of the meeting planned for later that day.\n\n131. The evidence of the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor, and the Mayor’s Chief of Staff when interviewed on 17 August 2022 was that the 10 February 2022 meeting was to have been one at which the Mayor and the Commissioner would discuss the plan in a collaborative manner and develop a way forward. The Mayor referred to various examples of instances in which direct engagement between the Mayor and Commissioner had allowed compromises to be reached on areas of dispute and sensitivity between them. I have no doubt that there were numerous examples of such occasions, and that the previous working relationship had been effective. The M"
