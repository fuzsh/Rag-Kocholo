        "text": "A FORMER Merseyside assistant chief constable today landed the role of the country’s top cop.\n\nSir Paul Stephenson was expected to be unveiled today as the new Metropolitan police commissioner.\n\nSir Paul worked as former commissioner Sir Ian Blair’s deputy for four years, and beat tough competition from Northern Ireland chief Sir Hugh Orde to take the post.\n\nFinal interviews for the office earlier this week marked the end of a gruelling selection process.\n\nThe candidates took turns in the hot seat in front of home secretary Jacqui Smith and London mayor Boris Johnson.\n\nCurrent Merseyside chief Bernard Hogan-Howe was on the four-man shortlist but did not make the final two.\n\nSir Paul, who has a reputation as a straight-talking Lancastrian, was made ACC at Merseyside police in October 1994.\n\nThe 55-year-old father-of-three oversaw the local fight against terrorism, and helped bring about reductions in gun crime and corruption within the force.\n\nHe also tackled the problem of organised gangsters muscling in on nightclub doors.\n\nHe left in 1998 and went on to become chief constable of Lancashire police.\n\nAfter Sir Ian’s resignation from the role of commissioner last December Sir Paul stepped in. One of his biggest challenges will be policing the 2012 Olympics."
