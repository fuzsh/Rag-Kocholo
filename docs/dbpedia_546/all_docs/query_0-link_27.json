(b)(1) In order to determine whether laws and programs addressing subjects within the jurisdiction of a committee are being implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent of Congress and whether they should be continued, curtailed, or eliminated, each standing committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) shall review and study on a continuing basis-- (A) the application, administration, execution, and effectiveness of laws and programs addressing subjects within its jurisdiction; (B) the organization and operation of Federal agencies and entities having responsibilities for the administration and execution of laws and programs addressing subjects within its jurisdiction; (C) any conditions or circumstances that may indicate the necessity or desirability of enacting new or additional legislation addressing subjects within its jurisdiction (whether or not a bill or resolution has been introduced with respect thereto); and (D) future research and forecasting on subjects within its jurisdiction. (2) Each committee to which subparagraph (1) applies having more than 20 members shall establish an oversight subcommittee, or require its subcommittees to conduct oversight in their respective jurisdictions, to assist in carrying out its responsibilities under this clause. The establishment of an oversight subcommittee does not limit the responsibility of a subcommittee with legislative jurisdiction in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. (c) Each standing committee shall review and study on a continuing basis the impact or probable impact of tax policies affecting subjects within its jurisdiction as described in clauses 1 and 3. (d)(1) Not later than March 1 of the first session of a Congress, the chair of each standing committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Ethics, and the Committee on Rules) shall-- (A) prepare, in consultation with the ranking minority member, an oversight plan for that Congress; (B) provide a copy of that plan to each member of the committee for at least seven calendar days before its submission; and (C) submit that plan (including any supplemental, minority, additional, or dissenting views submitted by a member of the committee) simultaneously to the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on House Administration.

(3) Not later than April 15 in the first session of a Congress, after consultation with the Speaker, the Majority Leader, and the Minority Leader, the Committee on Oversight and Reform shall report to the House the oversight plans submitted under subparagraph (1) together with any recommendations that it, or the House leadership group described above, may make to ensure the most effective coordination of oversight plans and otherwise to achieve the objectives of this clause.

Calendar No. 680. ------ Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2019 Public Law 116-30 H.R. 866 (S. 528) To provide a lactation room in public buildings. Summary H.R. 886 requires public buildings, where it is feasible, to provide designated private and hygienic lactation spaces for nursing mothers that are available to the public. This bill would only require nursing spaces if a building is open to the public and if lactation rooms are available for federal employees. Under current practice, Federal agencies provide a designated, non-bathroom space for returning employees to pump breastmilk for their newborns, ensuring that new mothers are able to continue this practice even after returning to work. This bill extends this requirement to include not just employees, but visitors to Federal facilities. In Washington, D.C. alone, there are millions of tourists who visit Federal facilities. There are also visitors to federal agencies for meetings and events. Increasingly, families understand the unique benefits of breastfeeding, and visitors to these buildings who have newborns and babies should have a private space to breastfeed or pump. The benefits of breastfeeding are well-documented--breastmilk contains antibodies and hormones that boost babies' immune systems, and studies have shown lower risks of asthma, diabetes, respiratory infections, and other diseases among breastfed babies. Moreover, breastfeeding also has benefits for nursing mothers, who, research has shown, have lower risks of diabetes and certain forms of cancer.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to clarify that National Urban Search and Rescue Response System task forces may include Federal employees. Summary H.R. 639 is a technical correction which amends section 327 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Pub. L. 100-707) to explicitly clarify that Federal employees are able to participate in the National Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Response System task forces coordinated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA has developed the National USAR Response System (System) over the last several decades to act as a force multiplier for disaster rescue missions. The System is comprised of 28 task force teams from across the country and comprised of highly skilled volunteers who are constantly training for a variety of hazard scenarios, both man-made and natural, and task force teams have proven their effectiveness time and again. Following enactment of the National Urban Search and Rescue Response System Act (Pub. L. 114-326), certain Federal agencies that employ members of some of these task forces have been misinterpreting language which granted liability protections for non-Federal task force members equal to federal first responders--only when their task force was called into Federal service--resulting in an impediment to those federal employees serving on a task force. Legislative History H.R. 639 was introduced in the House on January 17, 2019, by Mrs. Hartzler and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Within the Committee, H.R. 639 was referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management.

Summary Lead is a toxic chemical that causes serious health problems. Excessive and harmful levels of lead have been found in water systems across all fifty states. Those water systems serve drinking water to millions of people in the United States. States have access to both clean water state revolving funds (CWSRF) and drinking water state revolving funds (DWSRF). Not all states have sufficient funds in their DWSRF to address the threat to public health from heightened exposure to lead in drinking water. However, some states have available funds in their CWSRF that could be used to provide additional resources to help address lead in drinking water. Currently states have the ability to transfer up to 33 percent of the annual capitalization grants they are awarded from one state revolving fund to the other, if the state decides to do so, in consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). However, some states have already transferred the maximum allowable amount from their annual CWSRF grants to the DWSRF, but have additional available funds in their CWSRF that could be used immediately to address a threat to public health from lead in drinking water. This bill allows a state to transfer an additional 5 percent of its CWSRF's total cumulative dollars to its DWSRF in order to address a threat to public health caused by elevated exposure to lead in drinking water. This decision is up to the states' discretion; it is not mandatory. This authority expires one year after enactment.
