        "text": "Police made the arrests on Thursday after raids in London, southeast England and Birmingham.\n\nPaul Stephenson, the deputy commissioner of London’s police, said: “We are confident we have disrupted a plan by terrorists to cause untold death and destruction.\n\n“Put simply, this was intended to be mass murder on an unimaginable scale.”\n\nBritain and the US stepped up security, causing severe delays at airports following the announcement of the reported plot, which a police source said was believed to involve concealing a “liquid chemical” device in hand luggage.\n\nJoint operation\n\nBritish police sources did not rule out US suggestions of a link to al Qaeda, but played down direct involvement by the global group.\n\nPolice sources said some of those arrested were British Muslims.\n\nJohn Reid, the British home secretary, told a press conference that the alleged plot had been designed to “bring down a number of aircraft through mid-flight explosions”.\n\nHe said that British police were confident “the main players have been accounted for”.\n\nPolice said the plan was uncovered in a joint operation by Scotland Yard’s anti-terrorism branch and the security service that lasted several months.\n\nLondon’s Heathrow airport, the busiest in Europe, closed to most European flights following the alert, officials said.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy, the French Interior Minister, said the suspects “appear to be of Pakistani origin” and said Paris had been in close contact with British authorities.\n\nRed alert\n\nA police official said British authorities had been working closely with the South Asian community.\n\nBritain and the US immediately went on the highest level of alert for attacks. Britain raised the level issued by MI5, the domestic intelligence service, to “critical” from “severe”, where it had been for several weeks.\n\nUS authorities issued a “Red” terrorism alert for the first time.\n\nMichael Chertoff, the head of homeland security, said the plot involved using liquid explosives and detonating devices disguised as beverages, electronic devices, or other common objects.\n\nHe said: “This operation is in some respects suggestive of an al Qaeda plot, but because the investigation is still underway, we cannot yet form a definitive conclusion.”\n\n“Extensive investigations”\n\nChertoff said the plotters had been very close to carrying out the attacks when British police moved in.\n\n“They had accumulated and assembled the capabilities that they needed and they were in the final stages of planning before execution.”\n\nTony Snow, the White House spokesman, said Thursday’s arrests were the result of extensive investigations and that George Bush, the US president, and Tony Blair, the British prime minister, had discussed the plot “in recent days”.\n\nDeparture halls in Britain were jammed with people waiting as airlines cancelled flights and trying to sort out their bags as hand luggage and liquids were banned from flights and passengers with babies were made to publicly taste their food."
