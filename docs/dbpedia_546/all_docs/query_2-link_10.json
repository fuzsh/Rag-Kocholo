        "text": "Sir Paul has been acting commissioner since Sir Ian Blair's departure\n\nSir Paul Stephenson, 55, has been appointed Metropolitan Police commissioner, beating Sir Hugh Orde, Chief Constable for Northern Ireland, into second place.\n\nThe new London police chief was front-runner in the race for the job, considered the top policing post in the UK.\n\nSir Paul was Sir Ian Blair's deputy when the former commissioner suddenly quit last year after concluding he did not have the support of new mayor Boris Johnson, and became acting commissioner while the appointment process went on.\n\nCounter-terrorism\n\nHe began his career with Lancashire Constabulary in 1975 and became a superintendent in 1988.\n\nThe high-flyer spent a period in research and development before taking on an operational command post in the then Royal Ulster Constabulary, a force which was still busy dealing with the threat of terrorism.\n\nIn 1994 he was appointed assistant chief constable of Merseyside with responsibility for territorial policing - the job of ensuring that there are enough officers on the beat to provide public safety and tackle crime as it happens.\n\nDuring his time on Merseyside, Sir Paul oversaw initiatives on gun crime, corruption and terrorism and spearheaded some of the force's reorganisation and modernisation efforts.\n\nHis most politically sensitive role came in 1996 when Parliament granted MI5 powers to look into serious and organised crime - something the Security Service had never previously done.\n\nThis led to Sir Paul leading negotiations on the working relationship between police officers and MI5 - a precursor to the joint counter-terrorism operations that take place today.\n\nModernising influence\n\nIn 1999, Sir Paul was appointed deputy chief constable of Lancashire and took the top job three years later.\n\nDuring his time back at the force, he oversaw fundamental changes to the constabulary's working practices, designed to modernise the force in line with new thinking developed in the USA. He also became the national spokesman for crime at the Association of Chief Police Officers.\n\nWhile he was in charge, Lancashire was consistently in the \"top tier\" of police performance league tables, says the Metropolitan Police.\n\nIn March 2005, Sir Paul moved to London after being made deputy commissioner in the Met.\n\nThat role, coinciding with the tenure of Sir Ian Blair, made Sir Paul the chief operating officer at New Scotland Yard, responsible for delivering the Commissioner's strategy and overseeing important areas of police modernisation such as increasing the ethnic diversity of the force.\n\nKnighthood\n\nIn 2007 he joined the board of the National Policing Improvement Agency, the body set up to drive modernisation.\n\nSir Paul was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in 2000 and knighted in the 2008 birthday honours.\n\nThe new commissioner is no stranger to the politics of the job, having been at the right hand of Sir Ian Blair during his controversial time in charge.\n\nCritics in some of the newspapers suggested in the run-up to his appointment that he was too close to Sir Ian to get the job."
