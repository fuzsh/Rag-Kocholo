        "text": "Chief Constable Peter Fahy says he won't apply for the vacant Commissioner's role at the Metropolitan Police.\n\nAnd he said he had never accepted more than a cup of coffee from a journalist amid continuing allegations of a corrupt relationship between the police and press.\n\nThe Met post became vacant following the resignation of Sir Paul Stephenson on Sunday amid the News of the World phone hacking scandal.\n\nHis colleague Assistant Commissioner John Yates resigned the following day.\n\nBoth denied wrong-doing but said they wanted to avoid the nation's biggest police force being distracted by the continuing furore.\n\nMr Fahy, 50, a married father of four who grew up in east London, has indicated he wishes to see out his contract as chief constable of GMP until 2013.\n\nIn his latest blog he wrote: “There is also a lot of speculation in the media about who will be Sir Paul Stephenson’s successor and I am likely to be named as a potential candidate. However, I would like to clarify that I myself will not be applying for the role.”\n\nHe said: “The events of the past few weeks have been bewildering for policing as we have seen events in London being used to effectively denigrate policing nationally. Obviously I know Sir Paul Stephenson and John Yates extremely well and have the highest regard for them both professionally and personally.\n\n“They have done many fine things to protect the public and serve their country. They have been open and honest in admitting misjudgements and shown courage in resigning. What is bewildering is that this case is being used by some to suggest that corruption is endemic in British policing, which it is not.\n\n“We have always admitted that we have some staff in our organisation that do bad things including disclosing information to others - sometimes criminals, sometimes journalists and sometimes family or friends and we take this very seriously. Officers have been jailed for doing this, but that does not mean corruption is endemic or institutional.\n\n“There have also been suggestions that there are unhealthy relationships between police officers and the media. Well, the relationship with the media is a day-to-day part of policing as we make appeals for witnesses or tell the public through the media what they have a right to know. This is a crucial part of our accountability. Some of the conversations we have with the media are what is known as on-the-record and some are off-the-record, as they seek background information or guidance which they know cannot be published for legal reasons.\n\n“It is also clear that there are a small number of officers who pass information to journalists when they should not. Most of this is for malicious reasons because, unfortunately, they want to embarrass the force but, to repeat, this is a tiny group of staff and there is no suggestion that they do this for money.\n\n“It is fair to say that some journalists see part of their role as trying to get unauthorised information out of officers, that is just seen as something reporters do. Whether we like it or not the tabloid press in this country has huge influence and for a number of years leaders of public services have experienced a situation where what is covered in the tabloid press is of great concern to national and indeed local politicians. It is true this has almost become an obsession and leaders of public services, like me, spend a lot of time worrying about how we are portrayed and how we can improve that.\n\n“On the other hand I have never received more than a cup of coffee from a journalist and the stories of dinners etc is something chief officers in GMP have never accepted. We are clear that all offers of hospitality have to be declared and indeed any suggestion that this could be misinterpreted means that most offers are declined. We take this issue very seriously.”"
