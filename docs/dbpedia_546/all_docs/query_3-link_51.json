        "text": "Motoring offences and road transport regulation\n\nMotoring offences\n\nSince 2007 Paul has developed a specialism in defending motoring offences of all types in both the Magistrates’ Court and the Crown Court.\n\nPaul has worked in the niche area of motor defence since the start of his legal career and has a thorough understanding of technical defences involved with offences such as drink driving, drug driving and failing to provide a specimen. With a keen belief in ensuring the client’s best interests remain at the forefront of any legal matter, Paul’s experience in the industry means he knows and understands the importance of ensuring that the client is taken down the right avenue to suit both their objectives and the merits of their case. That may be by utilising his technical knowledge to advance a viable defence or by identifying key areas to assist with getting the best result for the client by advancing an effective approach to guilty plea representation.\n\nPaul manages the motoring team at Stephensons and his expertise means he is often called upon to provide comment or articles in specialist and national press as well as appearing on national radio.\n\nRoad transport\n\nPaul also leads a road transport team with an excellent reputation for representing commercial transport operators (HGV and PCV) at public inquiry before traffic commissioners on all regulatory issues such as repute, financial standing and maintenance.\n\nPaul provides effective and straight forward advice and representation for drivers and transport managers on an individual basis. As well as representing clients at Public Inquiry stage, Paul has advised and represented clients in appeals brought before the Upper Tribunal.\n\nWhat do Paul's clients say?\n\n\"Paul Loughlin is excellent, he came highly recommended due to his exceptional client care. Following my initial enquiry he provided immediate clear advice and regular communications. Thereafter he managed to get all proceedings withdrawn in less than two hours... I cannot thank him enough and would not hesitate in providing his contact details to friends and family.\"\n\n\"Paul Loughlin handled my case and I cannot praise him highly enough, he is absolutely superb. Paul handled everything in an understanding, compassionate manner and he absolutely nailed the way forward and knew exactly what needed to be done. I'm delighted with what he achieved i.e. getting the case dropped, fantastic! If Paul hadn't achieve this outcome I was facing 6 points and a hefty fine and a court case which I was not looking forward to at all. I can certainly highly recommend Paul Loughlin and wouldn't hesitate to contact him if I ever need assistance in the future and to recommend him to others.\"\n\n\"Paul Loughlin helped me with a public inquiry to get my operator's licence. From the very first time we spoke on the phone until the end he was nothing but honest, professional and extremely helpful. He gave excellent advice and in turn my company has managed to keep trading. I am beyond grateful to him for his services. Nothing was too much and he was always there for me...If I ever need any advice or help again he will be the person I will call upon.\"\n\n\"I found myself in the unfortunate position of potentially losing my driving licence due to a number of driving offences committed (unwittingly) within a short space of time. To lose my driving licence would mean to lose my job. I approached Stephensons Solicitors for advice and support with my case, and I'm so glad that I did. The solicitor and paralegal who dealt with my case were understanding, supportive and very easy to deal with and communicate with. They explained what would happen in an easy to understand manner and answered any questions or concerns that I had promptly and clearly. My case was referred to court for a hearing, and Stephenson's Solicitors appointed an excellent barrister to represent me in court who was professional, knowledgeable and reassuring, and she inspired me with confidence. The outcome of my court hearing was a positive one from my perspective and this was largely due to the advice and support given to me by my solicitor and paralegal. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this firm of solicitors for anybody needing legal support or advice. Thank you.\"\n\n\"We had a great Solicitor from Stephensons who was very knowledgeable in obtaining an operator's licence and advising the correct actions we wanted to put into place.\"\n\n\"Excellent professional and friendly staff, Kept me well informed with regular updates of my pending trial and made me feel comfortable about my situation. I would highly recommend Stephensons solicitors to anyone needing their services, and will 100% use their services again if the need arises.\"\n\n\"I could not of been happier with the service from Paul of Stephensons Solicitors LLP. Paul's expertise and fore knowledge of my case really saved the day and I received the best outcome I could of possibly hoped for. He put me at ease and talked me through each step of the way. I would recommend Paul Loughlin of Stephensons to anyone requiring Legal assistance.\"\n\n\"Paul Loughlin was the best... listened to everything, all odds against me getting a result... got the truth out and I didn’t even get to a court room.\"\n\n\"This is a complex area and not a process a family should face alone. Stephenson's provided really good advice to prepare for and attend court to represent my 17 year old son to achieve a successful outcome.\""
