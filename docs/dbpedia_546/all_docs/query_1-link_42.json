        "text": "Tim Godwin has been appointed as the new deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS).\n\nBy Gemma Ilston\n\nTim Godwin has been appointed as the new deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS).\n\nMr Godwin beat Merseyside Chief Constable Bernard Hogan-Howe to the role after the two men reached the final shortlist.\n\nHome Secretary Alan Johnson made the announcement and said Mr Godwin has been instrumental in delivering safer neighbourhoods across London and in driving major reforms of the criminal justice system.\n\nI know that he will bring a really vigorous commitment to the vital responsibilities of his new role, he said.\n\nLondon Mayor and chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), Boris Johnson, said the appointment was well deserved and recognised Mr Godwins undoubted abilities.\n\nA substantial part of Tim`s career has been spent policing London, the largest and certainly the most complex policing environment in the UK, and he has an outstanding record leading the MPS territorial policing, which bears responsibility for day-to-day policing of the capitals communities, he added. This can only be of benefit in this pivotal role within the MPS senior management team and we look forward to working with Tim to achieve our shared goal of a safer London.\n\nMr Godwins appointment follows Sir Paul Stephensons promotion to Commissioner of the MPS.\n\nMr Godwin spent six years in the Merchant Navy before joining Sussex Police in 1981, where he performed a variety of operational roles.\n\nHe joined the MPS in November 1999 as commander (crime) for South London and went on to become south east territorial commander and then commander (crime) for territorial policing. He was promoted to deputy assistant commissioner, territorial policing in 2001, then to assistant commissioner, territorial policing a year later.\n\nHe leads for the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) on mobile phone crime and criminal justice and is chair of the London Criminal Justice Board (LCJB).\n\nMr Godwin was awarded the OBE in 2003 and the Queens Policing Medal (QPM) in 2009.\n\nCurrently acting deputy commissioner, Mr Godwin said: I am honoured to be appointed in this role. Having served in London for over ten years I can think of no job I would rather do.\n\nI will work my hardest to continue to help to make London a safer city, and will enjoy my continued working relationship with Sir Paul Stephenson as his deputy.\n\nCommissioner Sir Paul said Mr Godwin is an outstanding police officer who has contributed much to policing nationally and in particular, to the MPS."
