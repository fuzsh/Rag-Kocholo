        "text": "Police bloggers criticise new Metropolitan police commissioner as 'another New Labour glove puppet'\n\nAudrey Gillan\n\nWed 28 Jan 2009 12.09 CET\n\nThe welcome on the blogs for the new commissioner of the Metropolitan police is not one given with wide open arms. Sir Paul Stephenson, the appointee, is dismissed as \"another New Labour glove puppet\", and cops on the beat doubt that anything will \"change for the better\".\n\nUnder the headline \"Meet the new Boss, much the same as the old one\", the sheepdogsandwolves blog says: \"So now that the \"PC PC\" has finally gone, Sir Paul Stephenson is going to be the new Commissioner of the Metropolis. I've never met him and I probably never will, unless something goes horribly wrong somewhere, and the most I'll see of his new direction and 'leadership' will be a weekly podcast on the intranet that I won't watch.\n\n\"We may get some policy directions that will be changed by countless levels of chinese whispers so by the time they get to us they will do nothing but serve the needs of the borough Commander or the divisional Superintendent to make sure they get their year end bonus for meeting targets and budgets.\"\n\nOn the Police Oracle discussion forum, maverick22 fumes: \"Another NuLabour Glove Puppet, I wonder how long this one will last. At least it's an EASY act to follow.\" While his fellow poster Batman2736 writes: \"Quite a portfolio for experience … the Met, terrorism, resource management, Ulster, Lancashire and he survived Merseyside! It should be an interesting posting that will not prove dull … I wonder what the next headline will be & will Conservatives, other than Boris, like him?\"\n\nA blog entirely unrelated to police matters and all about crap cycling in the Waltham Forest area of London says that with Stevenson's appointment \"the epidemic of driver lawlessness on the capital's streets will get worse\". Calling Stephenson by his force nickname Rusty - given to the top cop because he is always permatanned whatever the weather - the angry two-wheeler writes: \"Sir Paul is one of the many police heroes of those libertarian loons who call themselves The Association of British Drivers.\"\n\nOn the microblogging site Twitter, Charlie Edwards, a senior researcher at Demos said: \"Stand up Sir Paul Stephenson, new commissioner of the Met office. Sad that Hugh Orde missed out.\"\n\n{{#ticker}}\n\n{{topLeft}}\n\n{{bottomLeft}}\n\n{{topRight}}\n\n{{bottomRight}}\n\n{{#goalExceededMarkerPercentage}} {{/goalExceededMarkerPercentage}}\n\n{{/ticker}}\n\n{{heading}}\n\n{{#paragraphs}}\n\n{{.}}\n\n{{/paragraphs}}{{highlightedText}}\n\n{{#choiceCards}} {{/choiceCards}}\n\n{{#cta}}{{text}}{{/cta}}\n\nEmail address\n\nPlease enter a valid email address\n\nPlease enter your email address\n\nSorry we couldn't set a reminder for you this time.
