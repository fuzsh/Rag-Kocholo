        "text": "The acting commissioner was unveiled as Britain’s most senior police officer by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and London Mayor Boris Johnson.\n\nThe 55-year-old straight-talking Lancastrian, picked for his \"expertise and leadership\" will be responsible for 50,000 staff members and a £3.5 billion budget - combining regional and national duties.\n\nSir Paul - who was Sir Ian Blair's deputy - will be expected to continue the fight against terrorism, lead police strategy nationwide and secure the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nIn London, the new commissioner faces spiralling youth violence, a potential recession-fuelled crime wave and low morale as budget-tightening looms large.\n\nSir Paul, who was chosen for the £253,000-a-year post ahead of Sir Hugh Orde, the Chief Constable in Northern Ireland, said he was \"enormously proud\".\n\nHe added: “I am just such a hugely proud policeman, to be asked to lead the Met in bringing safety to millions of Londoners, millions of visitors and lead the Met’s national efforts.\"\n\nSpeaking outside New Scotland Yard today, the Home Secretary said: “In an extremely strong field of candidates, Sir Paul stood out at every stage in a long and testing process.\n\nThis was a matter of almost glutinous cross-party consensus.\n\nBoris Johnson, London Mayor\n\n“He impressed me with his strong vision and approach to tackling the challenges that lie ahead for the Met and the police service across the country at a time of significant reform.”\n\n“Sir Paul brings all the skills and experience needed to lead the capital’s police in the continued fight against serious crime and counter-terrorism as he has demonstrated over the last few years as Deputy Commissioner.\n\n“As such, I believe Sir Paul offers the expertise and leadership needed to inspire confidence across the entire Police Service - and most importantly, among the people of London.”\n\nEXPRESS VIDEO: WATCH TODAY'S NEWS AS IT BREAKS!\n\nMayor Boris Johnson, who helped pick the new Met Police boss, added: “I want to plant my flag very firmly in Jacqui Smith’s remarks and stress this was a matter of almost glutinous cross-party consensus.\n\n“There was agreement in the police authority, there has been agreement in large measure across the board that Sir Paul was the outstanding candidate.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
