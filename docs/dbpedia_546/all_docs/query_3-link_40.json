        "text": "Police officers, staff and volunteers from forces across the country have been recognised in His Majesty The King’s New Year Honours List.\n\nPeople of all ranks and several roles have been awarded honours.\n\nThe 2024 list includes a total of 36 police and law enforcement personnel honoured for their extraordinary contributions to policing.\n\nChair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Gavin Stephens, said: “A massive congratulations to all of those recognised for their service to policing in His Majesty the King’s New Year’s Honours List.\n\n“I am delighted to see so many officers, staff, and volunteers from across the country being awarded.\n\n“We are grateful to all recipients, from every level of policing, for their contributions to local communities and public safety.\n\n“Their commitment and dedication deserves our praise and everyone should be rightly proud to be recognised in this way.”\n\nNational chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW), Steve Hartshorn, said: “On behalf of the PFEW I would like to congratulate all our police officer colleagues who have been recognised in the New Year Honours list for 2023.\n\n“To receive an award is a great achievement and this is due recognition for their work and commitment to policing which must make them and everyone very proud.”\n\nHe said of special mention this year were Special Chief Inspector Laura Hart, who received the King’s Police Medal for Services to Policing; explosives officer Mick Kettle; and Detective Inspector Rasheed Alawiye.\n\nSpecial Chief Insp Hart, from Walton, is the most-senior female volunteer in Merseyside Police and throughout her public service has made a determined impact on improving officer skills, knowledge, and training while exploring opportunities for female Special Constable officers.\n\nSpecial Chief Insp Hart has worked with the force’s Women’s Network to ensure female officers are mentored, and has identified female officers to take up acting sergeant roles and has participated in a national recruitment video inspiring other females to join the constabulary contributing to an uplift in the number of female officers over past 12 months.\n\nShe has developed new opportunities not seen anywhere else in the UK enabling SCs to work in areas of policing such as investigation, hate crime and protecting vulnerable people.\n\nMerseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy KPM said: “Laura works not only as a Special but also as police staff within the Criminal Justice department.\n\n“Her greatest strength and passion are welfare and wellbeing of her colleagues.\n\n“She routinely supports those in her care through key life and policing milestones. Laura’s dedication and commitment to voluntary public service has seen her work on an average of 18 volunteer hours per week which is in addition to her position as police staff.\n\n“Her selfless contribution over 15 years has had a clear impact on the reputation of the force both locally and nationally.”\n\nSpecial Chief Insp Hart said: “I am speechless and so proud to be recognised with the King’s Police Medal. I joined the Special Constabulary as I really wanted to make a difference and it has become a huge part of my life. So much so, I continue to work as a Special Chief Inspector alongside my role as police staff.\n\n“Female leadership, wellbeing and training are all really important to me and I’m proud to be involved in the development of several projects which will help to provide opportunities for others.”\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service’s (MPS) explosives officer Mick Kettle has been appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his work in the UK and abroad as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operator.\n\nHe has dealt with the most complex terrorist bombs in very demanding circumstances requiring him to always put the safety of others before his own. He has promoted and lectured on safe explosive ordnance disposal internationally, including deployments to Oman, Bahrain, Singapore and the US. Prior to joining the MPS he spent 25 years as an ammunition technician in the British Army, achieving the highest level of qualification in improvised explosive device disposal.\n\nDetective Insp Alawiye was awarded the British Empire Medal for developing and championing diversity and inclusion initiatives across the MPS.\n\nDet Insp Alawiye developed a campaign for meaningful cultural change and instigated action across the MPS to debate inclusion, diversity and equality by developing Discussions Matter, a series of videos that brought together officers and staff from different backgrounds where personal experiences of diversity addressed uncomfortable topics in a way which was authentic, respectful, informative and productive.\n\nDet Insp Alawiye said: “I am honoured, proud and humbled by this nomination. It’s a nod to the brave individuals within the diversity and inclusion groups that I’ve been involved in over the years, and the leaders that have afforded me the time to pursue this work. Policing is great, I think we all just want the public to see that.”\n\nMPS Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said: “I would like to congratulate all our colleagues who have been recognised in the King’s New Year Honours List for their remarkable achievements. These awards are hugely deserved and very special; I hope that the recipients and their families and loved ones take great pride in them.\n\n“The awards reflect a variety of contributions across different aspects of policing in London and beyond. From preventing and investigating terrorism and knife crime, to leading large-scale ceremonial and sporting events and promoting inclusion and equality across our organisation; this is a snapshot of our exceptional people.\n\n“I am incredibly impressed and proud of their extraordinary service to the communities of London and beyond.”\n\nActing president of the Police Superintendents’ Association, Nick Smart said: “I would like to offer my warmest congratulations to all the recipients of this year’s New Year’s Honours.\n\n“Seeing current or retired superintendents, alongside other police officers, staff and volunteers celebrated and recognised for all they do for our Service and our communities is fitting, and a rightful reflection of their efforts.\n\n“These people will often have spent years dedicating their careers, or their own time, to support and benefit others, and we are grateful and appreciative of this dedication to service.\n\n“On behalf of everyone at the Police Superintendents’ Association, thank you and congratulations to every recipient.”\n\nPolice Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said: “Policing is an incredibly difficult job and I am delighted that a number of our officers and a member of police staff have been named in the New Year’s Honours List.\n\n“Each has made an outstanding contribution to policing through their dedicated service. I was enormously impressed by what each has done in policing, it was humbling to hear their stories.\n\n“It is a testament to their professionalism and to the support given to them by their families that the public service they have given over so many years has been recognised in this immense way.\n\n“It was a privilege to inform each of them and to pass on my congratulations on their incredible achievement.”\n\nPolice Scotland Chief Constable Jo Farrell said: “These awards are testament to the dedication to public service and professionalism our officers show right across the country, day in, day out.”\n\nCommanders of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)\n\nMartin James HEWITT, QPM Lately Chair, National Police Chiefs’ Council.
