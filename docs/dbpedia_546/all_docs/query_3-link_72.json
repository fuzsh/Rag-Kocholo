        "text": "Good Tuesday morning. This is Dan Bloom.\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nNOW FOR THE PAPERWORK: Britain’s creaking criminal justice system will fall under a piercing spotlight in the coming days (well … weeks) as it churns through a wave of rioters. Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces questions over court, police and prison capacity, not to mention the role of tech firms and the tinderbox of social forces that lies behind all this violence. Just as street clashes with the far right threaten to bleed into a second week.\n\nA whole week of disorder: Fallout once again splashes most of the papers, including the Independent and Mirror … i (fears of police shortages) … Mail, Telegraph and Times (Starmer’s spat with X bigmouth Elon Musk) … Guardian (a call to treat demos as terrorism) … and Express, on Met Police boss Mark Rowley’s grumpy mic grab when he was asked if it’s all “two-tier policing.” (“I’m sorry I knocked it to the floor,” he said in a statement last night. You can almost hear the clenched teeth.)\n\nJust a regular recess day, honest: Apart from talks with the sultan of Oman, there was not yet any public-facing activity on the PM’s diary today when Playbook checked, nor any hint of another COBRA meeting. Let’s see how long that lasts. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is meeting more police chiefs behind closed doors, while Courts Minister Heidi Alexander is on the morning round. At least there’s no danger of Alexander being interviewed by, y’know, her husband.\n\nGROUNDHOG DAY: Alexander will surely wish this was all over and she could talk about swift punishment and all that. But it’s still a live situation — as the six people arrested and “several” hurt police officers in Plymouth last night showed. Burnley Council said three gravestones in the Muslim section of a cemetery were vandalized. The i has a handy map of where trouble has erupted.\n\n**A message from Goldman Sachs: AI’s market implications reach far beyond the tech sector. On average, an AI chatbot query needs up to 10 times as much electricity to process as an internet search. The impacts of increasing AI adoption will be felt not only in tech, but in the markets for labour, power, infrastructure, and more. Get our latest research.**\n\nOver the water: There was more unrest in Northern Ireland, too, where the assembly (unlike the U.K. parliament) is being recalled to discuss the violence on Thursday. My colleague Shawn Pogatchnik notes that the worst of the Belfast attacks on African and Arab businesses happened in working-class unionist districts dominated by an outlawed paramilitary group, the Ulster Defence Association. The UDA has long maintained links with neo-Nazis in Britain — but is now also finding common cause with racists in Dublin.\n\nAnd in Birmingham: A group of Asian men gathered in response to reports of a far-right rally that never materialized. A handful forced a Sky reporter off air shouting “free Palestine, f*ck media” and LBC reporter Fraser Knight said he was “chased out” of the area. “Cars followed us, we had abuse shouted at us and at one point a group of around six men ran after us down a road with what looked like a weapon,” he tweeted. Home Office Minister Jess Phillips got a very rough ride on X (including from Liz Truss) for insisting the group had only gathered because they feared an attack by the far right.\n\nWILL IT GET WORSE? Prepare for a nervy 36-hour wait, after a message shared by far-right activists on Telegram called for demonstrations at 30-odd immigration centers and law firms on Wednesday evening. Tell MAMA, a group that monitors anti-Muslim hate, identified the message and the Times and Bloomberg are among those who stood up the details. The Times team has also seen right-wing groups sharing instructions to make petrol bombs and an “arson manual” produced by a “National Socialism/White Power Crew,” which is described as a Russian-Ukrainian neo-Nazi group. Yikes.\n\nAnd look out for more embassies … after Nigeria, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia and the UAE issued warnings to citizens in the U.K. Which frankly is just a bit humiliating.\n\nOn the other hand: A vigil in Southport for the three girls killed last Monday (misinformation about which kicked this whole thing off) passed peacefully, with children in pink blowing bubbles and attendees bearing heart-shaped balloons. In case you needed some faith in humanity.\n\nAnd on the upside: Some rain is predicted in the next few days. Hooray! The best weapon against street unrest.\n\nAFTERMATH: The Ministry of Justice announced last night that it’ll create 500 more prison places in the next month … by basically bringing forward what the Tory government had already planned by a few weeks. The Guardian has the fine print. This is separate from Labour’s plans to release certain prisoners after just 40 percent of their sentences, which internal estimates claim will lead to 5,500 early releases in September and October.\n\nWhich poses the question … Could some rioters who are dealt “swift justice” (backed by 49 percent in a YouGov poll) be, er, released 40 percent of the way through their sentences, too? Answers on a postcard.\n\nTick, tock: The FT points out that some suspects won’t appear in the dock for weeks as prosecutors churn through charges. Playbook is told 24-hour courts still aren’t an immediate prospect as there are not enough people flowing through the system yet to need them.\n\nAnd on the police: They will have rest days canceled, says the Police Federation, while ex-Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor told Radio 4’s PM: “It will suffer … The backfilling is going to be very difficult to do.”\n\nCHALLENGE AHEAD: The FT argues the riots are a reminder of the parlous state of the justice system Labour has inherited. But credit for Starmer’s approach is not overflowing in other leader columns, which argue wider concerns over immigration fueled this even if the violence itself can’t be excused. The Mail says “government has so far failed to grasp” this fact, the Times accuses Starmer of a “policy vacuum” and the Sun warns against two-tier policing for different groups (which the PM has denied).\n\nAlso not happy: The Tory leadership candidates, obv. Robert Jenrick tells the Mail “Captain Hindsight” Starmer “dithered and delayed” for six days before holding a COBRA meeting … Priti Patel repeated her Lib Demmy demand to recall parliament with an Express op-ed … and James Cleverly has a boilerplate blue-on-red piece in the Sun, saying “our warnings about [Starmer’s] persistent flip-flopping were an underestimate.”\n\nThough their other harsh words … are reserved for Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage. Patel denied “two-tier policing” (as Farage claimed), Jenrick said “we should all be choosing our words carefully” and Cleverly told LBC: “Your job is not to get clicks and likes on social media.” Will more come out today?\n\nAs for Team Farage: The Clacton MP’s aides were pretty bullish and dismissive of all this criticism last night. Reform’s ousted Leader Richard Tice may well scoff similarly on GB News at 8 a.m.\n\nThis might not help: No. 10 is still not ruling out the prospect that the PM goes on holiday at the end of this week (traditionally, hacks are told officially just before it happens). The i’s Kitty Donaldson is firmly in the give-the-dude-a-break camp. She is told Starmer has been starting work on ministerial papers at 10 p.m. (!) and then waking up at 6 a.m. for more. Can’t be healthy.\n\nPolicy alert: The Times’ Geraldine Scott reports Labour will move away from housing asylum seekers on big military sites and instead disperse them across the country.\n\nMULTIPLE FRONTS: It isn’t just the dry paperwork of court and prison capacity about which Starmer faces calls to ramp up. It’s on delicate social issues, too — former Met Police chief Neil Basu tells the Guardian the riots should be treated as terrorism, while Labour MP Afzal Khan wrote to Starmer calling for a definition of Islamophobia (via the Standard). Good luck with all that.\n\nNot to mention … the bear pit that is the internet. Playbook is told DSIT civil servants in the not-so-catchily-acronymed “National Security Online Information Team” have been trawling the internet to flag rule-breaking posts directly to social media companies, under a “trusted flagger” banner. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle met TikTok, Meta, Google and X on Monday and the government is looking at whether hostile state actors amplified false posts.\n\nBut but but … New legislation isn’t expected imminently, and the Mail reports new duties on social media firms under the Online Safety Act aren’t due to come into force for months, since Ofcom is still consulting on the details. A neat illustration of the hurdles for the government comes in the form of one “cybersecurity source,” who tells the i’s Jane Merrick and Chloe Chaplain that Telegram could be banned, but users would just switch to a rival encrypted app like Signal. It’d be like “Whac-A-Mole,” they lament.\n\nThen there’s this bloke: Downing Street’s criticism of X buyer Elon Musk for saying “civil war is inevitable” splashes three papers (and POLITICO EU) after Musk got up in the PM’s mentions on Monday night. The Mail leader column springs to Starmer’s defense for once (sorta) by giving Musk both barrels. Oh, and Lib Dem MP Tim Farron called him a “berk.” This is the guy who was given a soft-soap interview by the U.K.’s prime minister in a gold-leafed hall less than a year ago. It’s been quite the whirlwind.\n\nMEANWHILE IN AMERICA\n\nTHE OTHER POWDERKEG: Attention will shift back to the U.S. today as Kamala Harris announces her whirlwind-pick running mate. Reuters reckoned the Democratic candidate for president had narrowed it down to “get sh*t done” Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro (Telegraph profile here) or Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (Guardian profile here). The winner is set to be announced online this morning, U.S. time, ahead of the pair’s first joint rally tonight in Philadelphia.\n\nInterview of a lifetime: Interviews with wider hopefuls over the weekend were a crucial way of clearing up vetting issues and testing compatibility for the campaign, where the pair will have the task of defusing Donald Trump’s verbal hand grenades. But it’s also about chemistry, write my U.S. colleagues — whether they can really work together for four to eight years. If they’re lucky.\n\nSpeaking of powderkeg: The tumbling of global stock markets, including the FTSE 100, on fears of a U.S. recession gets big billing in the papers, including the splash of the Financial Times (natch). The pink ‘un reports that Tokyo’s Topix suffered its worst fall since Black Monday in 1987 (though Asian markets rebounded overnight). CBS proffered a few explanations here, while the Times blames a “global scramble by opportunistic hedge funds” that “amplified the panic.”\n\nALL PERFECT TIMING … for the second day of Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ big visit to New York (then Toronto on Wednesday), where the Harris news threatens to derail a planned CNBC interview. Reeves is due to speak to NPR’s Planet Money podcast and my colleagues at POLITICO, but market turmoil may dominate. After all, she’s banked her spending plans on growth — and a global financial panic wouldn’t exactly help achieve that.\n\nPlenty to talk about, then … as Reeves dines tonight with billionaire Blackstone chief Stephen Schwarzman, after meeting execs from firms including Barclays, BNY, Vanguard and Citibank. Already she was forced to deny that her big invest-in-a-stable-Britain pitch is being undermined by *checks notes* riots in the streets.\n\nCloser to home: Reeves pointedly refused to rule out changing the definition of debt in her fiscal rules — to strip out losses from the Bank of England — in a way that’ll give her more budget headroom this autumn. The FT’s George Parker and Times’ Mehreen Khan, who are along for the ride, write up her words.\n\nEyes emoji: The chancellor also refused to rule out bringing capital gains tax in line with the (higher) rate of income tax in a Bloomberg interview. Brace!\n\nAnd if you love all that: The National Institute of Social and Economic Research is holding a press conference on Labour’s economic inheritance at 11 a.m. (register here). Useful for anyone seeking another referee in the Reeves vs. Jeremy Hunt “black hole” Numberwang.\n\nOVER IN WALES\n\nSECOND TIME LUCKY! Welsh Labour Leader Eluned Morgan is set to be confirmed as Wales’ first female first minister today — with the lofty task of outlasting her scandal-hit predecessor Vaughan Gething’s 118 days in the job. Truly, Wales had its own Liz Truss.\n\nIt’s a coronation: Senedd members meet at 11 a.m. to elect a new first minister — with Morgan pretty much guaranteed to win. The Tories and Plaid Cymru are expected to nominate their leaders but the person with the most votes wins. The Senedd is split 30-30 between Labour and opposition parties but a tie like in 2016 seems unlikely because Lib Dem member Jane Dodds is tipped to abstain (h/t Nation.Cymru’s helpful explainer).\n\nShort victory lap: Morgan is due to give a statement in the chamber followed by interviews with Welsh and U.K.-wide media, before appointing her Cabinet (she already has ex-MP Kevin Brennan as a SpAd). We noted in December that the 57-year-old former health minister was by far the most experienced of any hopeful for leader — she was an MEP for 15 years and handed a peerage in Westminster in 2011 — but that means she comes with baggage, too.\n\nBaggage like this: Not only did Morgan oversee Wales’ NHS since 2021 — surviving a no-confidence vote over her handling of failings at the Betsi Cadwaladr health board — she was also banned from driving and reprimanded by the Welsh parliament in 2022 after clocking up four speeding offenses. An investigation found she had shown a “disregard for the law.”\n\nBut the bigger tensions … between Cardiff and London could come on policy. One Welsh Labour figure tells Playbook Morgan is committed to Senedd reforms that would raise the number of members from 60 to 96 and scrap the first-past-the-post element in voting. Unsurprisingly, not all Labour members are massive fans of letting in more opposition MSs or persuading the public that what the world needs is more politicians. One to watch.\n\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\n\nPARLIAMENT: Getting a tan.\n\nPARTY BOAT: John Healey is hosting his Norwegian counterpart from 1.15 p.m. as the defense secretary pushes to butter up key allies in Europe. Expect an announcement about working together in the future, and talks about Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nSlow boat: Just, uh, don’t show them all the pickup in today’s papers for a Sun scoop that not a single of the U.K.’s six Astute and Trafalgar “hunter-killer” submarines is available for duty.\n\nSTRIKE OUT: That heavily trailed letter from Deputy PM Angela Rayner, telling departments to ignore the Tories’ “minimum service levels” law for striking workers, should pop up in the next couple of hours.\n\nTICK, TOCK: The Jewish Chronicle has seen a case in which a person seeking an arms export from the U.K. to Israel was told it was “suspended pending policy review.” Yet a government official insists to Playbook that nothing has changed and they will still only decide whether to suspend arms exports as a whole later this summer. A hot issue to bookmark for a few weeks’ time.\n\nLOCK STEP: The Ministry of Justice has redirected £100 million over five years to Wandsworth prison after a damning inspection found violence, widespread drug use and overcrowding. Worth noting the press release went to hacks seven hours after a separate release from the Howard League for Penal Reform slammed the jail. Campaigners and ministers working in harmony … for now.\n\nPANTO SEASON: Ex-PM Liz Truss claimed the Tories “could effectively die” and be replaced by Reform UK in an interview at the Edinburgh Fringe (via PA). The Scotsman’s Rachel Amery has an entertaining write-up saying Truss was applauded, booed and heckled as she refused to apologize for economic turmoil on her watch — telling one “inane” audience member they didn’t “understand or care about what’s going on.”\n\nROUND IN CIRCLES: Elsewhere at Edinburgh, Wes Streeting made some warm noises about a cross-party approach to fixing social care. The Telegraph has the health secretary’s words — though, er, he didn’t actually commit to anything concrete and seemed to echo what he told Laura Kuenssberg during the campaign. Keep watching this space forever.\n\nCOUNCIL OF DESPAIR: More than 1.3 million people no longer pay council tax as local authorities are failing to collect a record £6 billion a year, says a Centre for Social Justice report written up by the Times.\n\nFEELING THE HEAT: About 10 million pensioners will see their fuel bill go up by around 15 percent (up to £228) after Labour removed universal winter fuel payments, an analysis by the End Fuel Poverty Coalition in the Telegraph says.\n\nREPORTS OUT TODAY: The Bank of England has just released its two-yearly report on how the major U.K. banks would cope with “resolution” (when they fail but aren’t shut down).\n\nBEYOND THE M25\n\nTHE OTHER LEADERSHIP ELECTION: Nearly a sixth of all Tory MSPs are standing to be Scottish leader after Jamie Greene became the fifth (out of 31) to throw his hat in the ring. The Herald reckons the main dividing line will be continuity vs. change.\n\nON THE PRECIPICE: Fears are growing that Iran will attack Israel after the country told ambassadors it has a moral duty to retaliate for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, as the Guardian reports. Ireland has urged its citizens to avoid traveling to Israel.\n\nUNacceptable: Nine UNRWA staff members may have been involved in Hamas’ attacks against Israel on Oct. 7 and will be fired, the U.N. said following an internal investigation into 19 members. Reuters has more. Conservatives will no doubt point out that the Labour government has restored funding to UNRWA, which campaign group Labour Against Antisemitism said in a letter to Starmer was “effectively aiding Hamas atrocities.”\n\nGrim findings: Palestinian prisoners have experienced violence, starvation rations and humiliation in Israel’s jails, being denied water and medical care, former detainees have told a big investigation by rights group B’Tselem that makes the front page of the Guardian.\n\nMEDIA BUST-UP: Jennifer Jacobs has been fired as Bloomberg’s White House reporter after co-authoring a story about the Russia-Western prisoner swap that was published while the prisoners were still in Russian hands. POLITICO’s West Wing Playbook has more and Jacobs appeared to blame editors in an X post last night.\n\nRUN AWAY: Bangladesh’s President Mohammed Shahabuddin said an interim government would be formed and a curfew lifted after Sheikh Hasina — the aunt of Labour minister Tulip Siddiq — fled abroad after 15 years of power that produced vote-rigging allegations, boycotts by opposition parties and the muzzling of dissent. We still wait to find out if she’ll end up in, erm, London. Foreign Secretary David Lammy called for an independent U.N. investigation into the hundreds of protesters’ deaths in recent weeks, while the BBC charts how she went from democrat to autocrat.\n\n**A message from Goldman Sachs: For years, data centres displayed a remarkably stable appetite for power, even as their workloads mounted. Now, as the pace of efficiency gains in electricity use slows and the AI revolution gathers steam, Goldman Sachs Research estimates that data centre power demand will grow 160% by 2030. At present, data centres worldwide consume 1-2% of overall power, but this percentage will likely rise to 3-4% by the end of the decade. In the US and Europe, this increased demand will help drive the kind of electricity growth that hasn’t been seen in a generation. Along the way, the carbon dioxide emissions of data centres may more than double between 2022 and 2030, and the increased demand will also mean further strain on power infrastructure. Europe has the oldest power grid in the world, so keeping new data centres electrified will require more investment. Our analysts expect nearly €800 billion in spending on transmission and distribution over the coming decade, as well as nearly €850 billion in investment on solar, onshore wind, and offshore wind energy.
