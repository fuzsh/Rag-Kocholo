        "text": "It is said of Sir Paul that he is uniquely qualified because he has effectively been doing the top job for the past three years. When he joined Scotland Yard in March 2005, Sir Ian was restructuring the senior management and his deputy was given the new title of \"chief operating officer\".\n\nSir Paul was credited with performing well, especially when the figures suggested a drop in crime levels of around six per cent, year on year. He had been tasked with improving efficiency and his initiatives began to bear fruit. His supporters say he has re-directed ­£300 million to front-line policing. Rank-and-file officers, many of whom ­suspected Sir Ian's politically correct style, warmed to him.\n\nIn many ways, Sir Paul is a copper's copper. He was born in Bacup, Lancashire (population 12,000), once described as the best preserved cotton mill town in England. His father was a butcher and young Paul was sent to the local grammar school, where he became head boy and a champion swimmer. His first choice of career was the shoe industry, to which he had an entree through his future father-in-law. But when an elder brother joined the local police force, he decided to try it himself.\n\nIt was 1975, the era of Life on Mars policing but if the 21-year-old PC Stephenson was exposed to Gene Hunt style tutelage, it didn't make much impact. Witness this episode on his first day at the Met. He was invited to a fundraising function at Richmond Rugby Club, a relaxed affair attended by some of the Yard's top brass. A young detective noted Sir Paul's deep suntan — he had just returned from a foreign holiday — and called out \"Hey, Rusty — where'd you get the tan?\" Laughter broke out but Sir Paul did not join in. Shortly afterwards, the young officer received a written warning for \"inappropriate behaviour\". To this day, Sir Paul's nickname at the Yard is Rusty.\n\nWhen a young policeman his behaviour was impeccable. In 1982, by then a sergeant, he was singled out as a possible future senior officer and sent to ­Bramshill, the fast-track training college. Unusually among police high-flyers of his generation he never went to university and was offered the opportunity of doing a police-­sponsored degree. He declined. He would rather spend the time on policing, he said. The list of names on his course at ­Bramshill reads like a roll of honour. At least five officers went on to become chief constables, among them Hugh Orde, another possible contender for the post of commissioner.\n\nHe told the Standard: \"Paul is very astute, highly experienced and very ­resilient. He can take on any subject and however complicated he seems to be able to cut through to the core of the issue. He does not get distracted by peripheral ­matters.\n\n\"In the past few years he has played a key role in running the business on the behalf of the commissioner. He has been doing the really difficult stuff. The Met is essentially a big business and Paul has dealt with the decisions and the issues with considerable adroitness.\"\n\nClarke's name still carries a lot of weight at the Yard and his words will be noted. There was praise, too, from Lord Stevens, widely considered the most successful Met Commissioner of recent years. He worked closely with Sir Paul on the inquiry into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Lord Stevens told us: \"Paul was always there with very good advice and support in what was a very difficult inquiry. He has proved himself a very successful chief constable in ­Lancashire and a strong leader. The Met needs stability now and he has a calm manner.\"\n\nAccording to a reliable source, she asked the local police authority if she could extend her tenure. It has been suggested among senior circles at the Yard that when Stephenson heard this he made it clear he would not accept any compromise to his succession or the timing of it. He duly succeeded Ms Clare in 2002. It proved impossible to reach Ms Clare to discuss this. She\n\ndid not return our call.\n\nIn 2004, Lancashire was graded the best performing force in the country and when Stephenson (as he was before his knighthood earlier this year) came to London to be interviewed for the deputy job at the Yard, he was the man to beat.\n\nOne of those who interviewed the final shortlist of three said there were few doubts over who should get the job: \"Once you get to this level it is not really what you say but it is how you say it, how you analyse points and put together an argument. It was quite clear that Paul Stephenson was the best candidate. He was way ahead, really.\" That would seem to be the case now. One bookmaker is offering odds of 8-11 on Sir Paul getting the top job, well ahead of his nearest rival, Sir Hugh Orde, of the Northern Ireland force, who is quoted at 5-1.\n\nSo will it be a shoo-in? Hardly. The selection of the next Met commissioner will be unlike any other. When Boris Johnson beat Ken Livingstone for the mayor's job last May one of his manifesto pledges was to put more police officers on buses to halt a rising tide of crime and delinquency. Assigning officers to specific tasks had always been the prerogative of the commissioner and his commanders. Johnson's election promise and subsequent allocation of funds to ensure it was put into action was seen by some at the Yard as a foray into operational policing.\n\nSources at the Yard say Boris has been secretly working on his strategy for months. They say Kit Malthouse, the Mayor's deputy in charge of policing, has developed a close relationship with Sir Paul since Boris's election. Sir Paul has been seen often at City Hall of late, it was noted.\n\nA perception has grown that Sir Paul has already persuaded Boris he can deliver a Met that fits the Mayor's ambitions for a highly-efficient force whose considerable resources are devoted more and more to cutting and preventing crime. Sir Paul is a fan of Problem Orientated Policing, where officers concentrate on the source of trouble and try to eradicate it, rather than just rounding up offenders.\n\nHe demonstrated its effectiveness in Lancashire when the local police faced a crisis in an area of Preston called the Hopwood Triangle. Burglary, drug dealing, prostitution and violence led to residents moving out and abandoning the estate to criminals. Stephenson assigned a team to Hopwood and asked the local authority to help him reclaim the area.\n\nNo one outside Boris's closest circle knows whom he favours for the next Met Commissioner. But he is aware that Sir Paul has a strong contingent at Scotland Yard willing him on and that he has his detractors. There is a view that Sir Paul neglected his first duty, to support the commissioner, Sir Ian, in order to further his own cause. Sir Paul's critics cite the bonus row which erupted when it emerged that Sir Ian wanted to claim a £25,000 bonus despite the failings attached to the de Menezes tragedy. It was reported that Sir Paul had foregone his own bonus and had urged Sir Ian to do the same.\n\nNot enough was done, say Sir Paul's critics, to protect Sir Ian from this ­damaging revelation. Brian Paddick, the former Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner and mayoral candidate, said that on the day de Menezes was shot, Sir Paul's secretary told him (Paddick) at 4pm that the police had killed the wrong man. Yet Sir Ian maintained he was not told until the following day.\n\nPaddick says he finds it inconceivable that Sir Paul's secretary knew, but he did not. So if Sir Paul knew, why didn't he tell Sir Ian?\n\nPaddick told us: \"The job of the deputy is to tell the commissioner what no one else dare tell him. That's his job, to ­protect the commissioner. But Sir Paul clearly didn't do his job very well, because Sir Ian did suffer major damage.\"\n\nInevitably, perhaps, there are other niggles. Sir Paul cannot provide a new start, some say, because he is indelibly marked with the stain of the ancien régime. ­Others point to the fact that he has yet to prove his heart is in London, because he chooses to keep the family home (a barn conversion) in Lancashire and return to his wife Lynda, with whom he has three children, at weekends."
