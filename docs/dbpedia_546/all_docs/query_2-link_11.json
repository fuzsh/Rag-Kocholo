        "text": "âOn behalf of the MPA, I congratulate Paul on his thoroughly deserved selection and I am certain he will be a most worthy successor to Sir Ian Blair who takes over as Commissioner at the beginning of February.\n\nâPaul has done an outstanding job as Chief Constable of Lancashire Constabulary and I am very pleased that Her Majesty the Queen and the Home Secretary have made this appointment.\n\nâThe MPA interviewed some exceptional candidates for this pivotal job from both within the Met and from constabularies elsewhere before forwarding our shortlist to the Home Secretary.\n\nâPaul has enormous experience of policing and is credited with making Lancashire police one of the countryâs most efficient, being placed in the top tier of police forces by Her Majestyâs Inspector of Constabulary. He has also overseen a record growth in police numbers and burglaries falling to an all-time low, which mirrors London, albeit on a smaller scale. His abilities will be particularly important as we move steadily towards citizen and community focused policing. At a time of unprecedented growth in police numbers, coupled with the advance of neighbourhood policing, Paul is the ideal person to help us make London the safest major city in the world.â\n\nâI am very much looking forward to my new role with the Metropolitan Police Service. The Met is perhaps the most famous police service in the world and the job is one of very few that could have tempted me away from Lancashire.\n\nâThere are undoubtedly challenges ahead, both for the Met and all other police forces, not least of all in terms of balancing the need for crime reduction and detection with the delivery of personable policing services at neighbourhood level. Giving the public the chance to access and influence policing services and be provided with answers is key to this delivery.â"
