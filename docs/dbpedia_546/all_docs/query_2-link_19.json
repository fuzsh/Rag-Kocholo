        "text": "LONDON—Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson resigned on Sunday amid a phone-hacking and police-bribery scandal that has tarnished the police in Britain's capital.\n\nHis resignation comes amid a growing uproar in the U.K. over the reporting tactics of News Corp.'s now-closed Sunday tabloid News of the World, which is being investigated by British authorities for allegedly intercepting voice mails and paying bribes to police in pursuit of scoops.\n\nSir Paul's resignation follows Sunday's arrest of Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International—News Corp.'s U.K. newspaper unit—who stepped down from her post on Friday. She is the most senior executive at News International to be arrested in connection with the scandal.\n\nMs. Brooks was arrested in connection with the allegations that are at the heart of the saga: illegally intercepting moblie-phone voice mails and bribery of police officials at News Corp.'s now-closeed News of the World tabloid, which she once edited and later oversaw as a corporate executive.\n\nAs of late Sunday, Ms. Brooks remained in police custody and hadn't been charged.\n\nSir Paul, who has been the most senior official at the Metropolitan Police, or Scotland Yard, since 2009, said he was resigning in particular because of last week's arrest of Neil Wallis, a former News of the World editor who later advised the police on public relations. Mr. Wallis who was arrested on suspicion of intercepting voice mails, was released without being charged.\n\nKey Players\n\n\"I have taken this decision as a consequence of the ongoing speculation and accusations relating to the Met's links with News International at a senior level,\" Sir Paul said in a televised statement on Sunday night.\n\nSir Paul said he first met Mr. Wallis in 2006, when he still worked at News of the World, to discuss policing, as he did with other journalists. In 2009, after Mr. Wallis left the paper, the Met entered into a contractual arrangement with him that ended in 2010. \"I played no role in the letting or management of that contract,\" Sir Paul said on Sunday.\n\nMr. Wallis couldn't immediately be reached for comment. News International declined to comment.\n\nOf the phone-hacking investigation, Sir Paul said, \"I had no knowledge of, or involvement in, the original investigation into phone hacking in 2006 that successfully led to the conviction and imprisonment of two men. I had no reason to believe this was anything other than a successful investigation.\"\n\n\"I was unaware that there were any other documents in our possession of the nature that have now emerged,\" he said. He added: \"As Commissioner I carry ultimate responsibility for the position we find ourselves in. With hindsight, I wish we had judged some matters involved in this affair differently. I didn't and that's it.\"\n\n\"Let me state clearly, I and the people who know me know that my integrity is completely intact. I may wish we had done some things differently, but I will not lose sleep over my personal integrity.\"\n\nThe police have come under fire from the public and politicians for failing to investigate the phone-hacking issue thoroughly in 2006 and, more recently, for allegedly taking bribes from News of the World. Scotland Yard opened an investigation into the possibility that police officers accepted bribes from the tabloid a week and a half ago.\n\n\"They seem to be doing now what they should have been doing two years earlier,\" said Sara George, a partner in the criminal and regulatory investigations practice at the law firm Stephenson Harwood in London.\n\nNews Corp. owns The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWrite to Paul Sonne at paul.sonne@wsj.com and Cassell Bryan-Low at cassell.bryan-low@wsj.com"
