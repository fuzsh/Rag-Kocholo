        "text": "nepal — Bernard Hogan-Howe, the acting deputy commissioner for Britain’s Metropolitan Police, has been named the new head of the force, the government said Monday.\n\nHogan-Howe will fill the gap left by former Met police chief Paul Stephenson and former assistant commissioner John Yates, who both resigned in quick succession in July following the British tabloid News of the World phone-hacking scandal.\n\nReporting on the scandal has led to allegations of cozy links between the tabloid and some police officers, damaging the Met’s reputation. The force also has struggled with tackling the violent riots that rocked London and other major cities in early August.\n\nOfficials praised Hogan-Howe for his commitment to cutting crime and his vision for tackling gang violence and youth crime.\n\n“Over recent weeks London has faced immense policing challenges and I truly believe that Bernard Hogan-Howe has the sound expertise to handle critical issues and keep our streets safe,” London Mayor Boris Johnson said.\n\nHe said Hogan-Howe has pledged to make Britain’s largest police force more transparent and more accountable to the public."
