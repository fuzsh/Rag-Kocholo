        "text": "A police chief has warned there is more violent disorder on the way - after another day of riots on British streets following the death of three young girls at a dance event in Southport.\n\nRallies taking place turned ugly on Saturday, with right-wing activists clashing with counter-protesters across the UK.\n\nResponding to rioting which has gripped Britain since the Southport attacks, the public order leader for the National Police Chiefs' Council warned Brits that the disorder is not over yet.\n\nChief Constable BJ Harrington said in a statement: \"This week we have seen appalling behaviour that in no way shows compassion or respect for the little girls who were killed and injured last week.\n\nRead More: Police 'gearing up' for weekend of riots following Southport stabbings as protesters warned of 'robust response'\n\n\"It shows no respect for our communities, and it will be stopped.\n\n\"We know people will try and do this again in the coming days and policing has been and will continue to be ready.\n\n\"There are 130 extra units in place across the country, meaning almost 4,000 extra public order-trained officers to deploy.\n\n\"So if you're planning to cause trouble and disorder our message is very simple - we'll be watching you. Anyone committing a criminal offence will be detained and brought before the courts.\n\n\"In recent days we have seen criminals masquerading as protesters, causing senseless destruction.\n\n\"These people are not protesters, they're violent thugs - and many have already been arrested and charged.\"\n\nDuring a day of chaos on Britain's streets...\n\nIn Liverpool, police were pelted with bricks, chairs, metal fences, flares and vapes which injured a female police officer.\n\nIn Manchester, fighting broke out between around 500 right-wing activists stood off with about 350 counter-protesters and officers were given extra temporary powers to manage the protests. At least one person was arrested.\n\nIn Blackpool, police arrested 20 people and there were also disturbances in Preston and Blackburn.\n\nIn Hull, far-right activists gathered at a migrant hotel and hurled bricks and bottles at the windows. Some people were heard to shout \"get them out\".\n\nThere were also pockets of violence at a protest in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, and a video posted online showed a man hurling an object at police. The local MP condemned the scenes.\n\nIn Belfast, a protest outside a mosque saw objects thrown at reporters and the windows of a cafe smashed.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Saturday that police have his \"full support\" in dealing with the protests.\n\nSir Keir and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper backed authorities as Britain sees several far-right protests and counter-protests.\n\nRead More: ‘You are my people’: Shelagh’s ‘best caller ever’ shares message of hope amid tensions sparked by Southport stabbing\n\nAfter a meeting of senior ministers to respond to the series of riots that were sparked by attacks, a Downing Street spokesperson said that Sir Keir \"began by thanking the police who responded to the violence committed by a small minority of thugs in Sunderland last night which injured four officers.\n\n\"Addressing the scenes of disorder we have seen today, the Prime Minister set out that the police have our full support to take action against extremists on our streets who are attacking police officers, disrupting local businesses and attempting to sow hate by intimidating communities.\"\n\nMs Cooper, who was at the crunch meeting, told broadcasters: \"Criminal violence and disorder has no place on Britain's streets.\n\n\"We've been clear to the police that they have our full backing in taking the strongest possible action against perpetrators, including making sure that there are more prosecutors, there are sufficient prison places and also that the courts stand ready because anyone who engages in this kind of disorder needs to be clear that they will pay the price.\"\n\nRead more: Police 'gearing up' for weekend of riots following Southport stabbings as protesters warned of 'robust response'\n\nRead more: Keir Starmer announces ‘support package’ for Southport as he visits community for the second time this week\n\nMeanwhile there was also a protest in Liverpool on Saturday, with a counter anti-fascist demonstration attended by local Labour MPs. Protesters and anti-fascist counter-protesters also turned out in Nottingham.\n\nIt comes after disorder in Sunderland on Friday night, following riots in Southport, London, Manchester and Hartlepool across three nights this week.\n\nThe disorder has been sparked by the killing of three girls at a Taylor Swift dance class in Southport on Monday, and false information spread online that the suspect was a Muslim asylum seeker. The teenager who has been charged with the murders is a 17-year-old born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents.\n\nPolice have promised a robust response to the rioting, with extra officers deployed and prosecutors made available to enact \"swift justice\" for wrongdoers.\n\nKeir Starmer announced a new unit for violent disorder after a meeting with police chiefs on Thursday following two consecutive nights of rioting.\n\nMeanwhile former Home Secretary Priti Patel called for the immediate recall of parliament, calling the government \"breathtakingly complacent\".\n\n\"We either believe in the rule of law, or we do not,\" she said.\n\nAt the protest in Sunderland on Friday night, mounted police and officers in riot gear clashed with rioters.\n\nThe protesters set fire to a premises next to a police station, believed to be a Citizens Advice bureau, and also burned cars.\n\nHundreds of people had gathered in the city's centre in response to Monday's Southport stabbings.\n\n\"We want our country back,\" could be heard as balaclava-wearing protesters walked through the city centre.\n\nFootage showed crowds tipping a car as they chanted \"get them out\" and \"whose streets, our streets\".\n\nCounter-protesters also came out, singing in support of refugees.\n\nSunderland Central MP Lewis Atkinson said of the rioters: \"Our city is not represented by a tiny minority causing trouble.\"\n\nHe added that officers have his \"full support as they respond to criminal thuggery and work to protect all the communities of our city\".\n\nNorthumbria Police confirmed eight people were arrested and three officers were taken to hospital as the violence erupted.\n\nNorth East Mayor Kim McGuinness said: “I’m appalled by scenes from Sunderland.\n\n\"Make no mistake, if your response to tragedy is to use it to commit violence, to abuse others, attack the police and damage property you stand for nothing except thuggery.\n\n\"It’s not protest. It’s crime and disorder. You don’t speak for Sunderland. You don’t speak for this region. Those grieving in Southport will take no comfort from this.”\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper slammed the rioters, claiming they \"do not represent Britain.\"\n\nTaking to X, she said: \"Criminals attacking the police & stoking disorder on our streets will pay the price for their violence & thuggery.\n\n\"The police have the full backing of Government to take the strongest possible action & ensure they face the full force of the law.\n\n\"They do not represent Britain.\"\n\nNorthumbria Police said officers were subjected to \"serious violence\" as thugs caused chaos in the city.\n\n\"The scenes that we are seeing are completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated.\"\n\n\"Ensuring the public’s safety is our utmost priority.\"\n\nEducation Secretary and Sunderland MP Bridget Phillipson described unrest in the city as \"unforgiveable violence and thuggery\".\n\nShe said: \"The scenes in our city centre tonight are shocking. We have seen unforgiveable violence and thuggery.\n\n\"The criminals involved in this appalling disorder must be identified, prosecuted, and punished with the full force of the law.\n\n\"Sunderland is better than this and these thugs do not represent our city.\"\n\nKeir Starmer said on Thursday that he was launching a special unit to tackle the violent disorder, that would share information across forces and use facial recognition software to identify criminals.\n\nMeanwhile, Gavin Stephens, the chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said prosecutors would be on standby to deliver \"swift justice\" to rioters.\n\nHe said: \"We agreed as police chiefs to step up our resourcing over the weekend so we will have surge capacity in our intelligence, in our briefing and in the resource that is out in local communities.\n\n\"It was really good that we were able to agree also yesterday with the support from our justice partners that there will be additional prosecutors available to make swift decisions, so we have swift justice.\""
