        "text": "They say the harder you work, the luckier you get. Which may be why Sir Paul Stephenson is now Britain’s top cop. No one could have put more hours into policing than Scotland Yard’s new chief.\n\nRegarded by the rank and file as a “copper’s copper”, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner is, by his own admission, a driven man who works all the hours God sends.\n\n“I’m not a great example of the work/life balance,” he says. “If I have a defining belief, it’s that I can always do better. You can never be good enough.”\n\nIn his first, not entirely untroubled, 100 days in the job Sir Paul has made his position clear.\n\n“People want safe homes and streets and a police force that cares about what they want. They have the right to believe police officers are on their side, we’re biddable, approachable. We will never walk on by.\n\n“Officers should not forget we own the street on behalf of the public. I’m a driven person, I’m proud of the badge I wear and feel hugely privileged to be in this position.”\n\nHello? This sounds like common-sense thinking straight out of the Dixon of Dock Green school of policing, not the target-obsessed, paper-shuffling, diversity-driven force run by a hierarchy of graduates.\n\nIt also proves that those who believed Sir Paul, 55, would fail to bring a new broom to the leadership could hardly be more wrong. At the core of his belief is a burning desire to serve the public – something, surprisingly, he learned from a Tesco manager whose superstore ran like clockwork.\n\n“When I asked him how he made it such a success, he said it amounted to keeping queues down and customers happy. He always had enough backroom people to move forward.\n\n“That struck a chord with me,’’ says the man who, within hours of being appointed, announced:\n\n“It’s time we all shut up and get on with our jobs.”\n\nAnd in what some saw as a thinly-veiled reference to his gaffe-prone predecessor Sir Ian Blair, he added: “I don’t want to be a celebrity.’’\n\nHe realises, one suspects, that in PR terms the police have taken a serious battering in the past decade. Some of it self-inflicted.\n\nWhen I mention the recent story of a copper who refused to get on a bicycle because he hadn’t passed the proper proficiency test, the Commissioner raises his eyes and groans.\n\n“That’s just daft, isn’t it?’’ Well, yes, it is. About as daft as police officers taking to the streets in Nottingham recently with loudhailers warning householders to close their windows so they don’t get burgled.\n\n“We do sometimes get it wrong,” he says. To get it right, the Commissioner has already insisted his force be guided by his five golden principles: Professionalism. Pride. Performance. Productivity and Presence.\n\n“Go anywhere in the world and the British police are regarded as the gold standard. We’ve got to be proud of our uniform and constantly challenge our performance.\n\n“That means looking the part as well. I believe a policeman should look like a policeman, I want them to look smart. My kids would tell you I’m a stickler, old fashioned and boring. And in some ways they’re right,” the father of three grown-up daughters admits in an accent richly flavoured with no-nonsense Northernness.\n\nBorn in the mill town of Bacup, Lancs, his mother, who turns 90 soon, was a factory worker and his dad a butcher.\n\nThere was no long-held tradition of policing in his family. In fact Sir Paul left his local grammar school intending to carve a career as a shoe salesman.\n\nAnd he might have stayed in the sole business if his elder brother Mike hadn’t joined the Lancashire Constabulary and impressed him with tales of life on the beat.\n\n“Mike was my inspiration,’’ he says, “and though he died two years ago, he will always be that to me. He was the person who opened my eyes to what the job involved.\n\n“Till then I had no burning desire to be a policeman. What sold it to me? The responsibility, the idea that it could be fun.’’ And in the uncertain climate of the 70s and 80s, he admits, job security was appealing.\n\nThis was the Gene Hunt era of policing and he watches TV’s Ashes to Ashes with just a flicker of recognition for the heyday of the maverick cop. And a twinge of envy for Hunt’s car. “A quattro! I never had anything so flash. Our cars were such rubbish I can remember a gearstick coming off in my hand. I don’t want to denigrate some of the excellent work done in those days but policing has quite rightly professionalised itself since then.”\n\nThe young PC Stephenson earned a nickname – Rusty, because of his perma-tan – and a reputation as a brilliant cop destined to be fast-tracked.\n\nWhat makes his upward trajectory all the more amazing is that, surrounded by high-flying graduates, he refused to go to university even when his superiors offered to sponsor a degree course.\n\n“I’d been five years on the beat. I believed I was better investing my time in doing what I knew how to do. I became a Superintendent very quickly and I worked hard, really hard. I can’t abide the idea of not doing a job well.’’\n\nOne suspects that given his unswerving devotion to duty his wife and “life support” Lynda, a former health worker, must be immensely long suffering. It can’t be easy to be married to a human dynamo.\n\nThe evenings the couple can sit down for a cosy night in front of the telly are few and far between.\n\ntechnophobe\n\n“There are weeks when I need to be out working every night. That goes with the territory. If Lynda knows she won’t be seeing me, she’ll head to our house back home in Lancashire.\n\n“I suppose I get there one weekend in three. Our children are all over the place now so Lynda is based in London with me. Thank God.\n\n“I’m hopeless on my own, she’d totally agree with that. I can just about rustle up a jacket potato.”\n\nNor is he particularly au-fait with technology unlike, happily, his other son-in law. “I’m a technophobe,” he says casting a look of despair at the televisions on the wall of his office. “They were left there by the previous incumbent. Nothing to do with me.\n\n“I just recently started using a digital camera. And that’s only because Lynda bought it.’’ How ironic. As a nation we’ve never been more monitored, with CCTV on every street corner, yet here’s Britain’s top cop admitting he’s only just mastered a camera.\n\nMy feeling is that he’s happy to leave state-of-the-art stuff to others while he gets on with the real business of policing. He says he’s a hard man to manage.\n\n“I’m punctual but my meetings tend to over-run because I love talking to people. I like to think I’m still grounded, you know. I get down to the pub and enjoy a pint now and again.” Not that there’s been much time for that lately. Since taking the top job he has had to deal with the G20 last month and has been forced to defend the actions of his officers in policing the summit after the death of newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson.\n\nThose officers who appear to have ignored orders to wear ID numbers have been suspended and an investigation into the policing of G20 is underway.\n\nThe Commissioner is patently outraged by the idea that officers may have deliberately concealed their identification. “If I see PCs behaving badly I’m disappointed. But I don’t want to pre-judge, we must have fairness. It’s right that our tactics on the day are reviewed, I have no problem with that. If there’s a better way, let’s find it.’’\n\nThat seems to be Sir Paul’s philosophy. One thing he accepts, however, is destined never to change.\n\nThat nickname, Rusty, which even now makes him cringe.\n\n“I would much rather be pale with a full head of hair. But that really is something out of my control.”\n\nSir Paul Stephenson's CV\n\n1973: Trainee manager at Rossendale shoe factory\n\n1975: Joins Lancashire Constabulary, aged 21\n\n1988: Promoted to superintendent\n\n1994: Becomes assistant chief of Merseyside police\n\n1999: Appointed Deputy Chief Constable of Lancashire Constabulary\n\n2000: Awarded Queen’s Policing Medal\n\n2002: Promoted to Chief Constable of Lancashire 2005: Appointed Deputy Commissioner at the Met\n\n2008: Knighted in the Queen’s Birthday Honours\n\nDecember 1, 2008: Becomes acting Met Commissioner after Sir Ian Blair resigns\n\nJanuary 28, 2009: Appointed Met Commissioner"
