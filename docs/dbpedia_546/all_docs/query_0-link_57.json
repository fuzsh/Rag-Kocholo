        "text": "3\n\nPreface.\n\nFor several years past my friends have suggested to me that I write the recollections of my long and somewhat eventful life. I hesitated to undertake the task for the reason that I had not been accustomed to write for publication. A year ago I reached the conclusion that if such a work was ever to be done, it should be begun at once. My memory has always been exceptionally good and reliable. In giving to the world my recollections of seventy years, as found in the following pages, I have made no effort at fine writing, but have endeavored to state facts in such a way as to make them intelligible. What I give in these pages is not an autobiography, but rather my impression of men and things, especially of men, as I have seen and known them. The readers, whoever they may be, old or young, cannot fail to find something in this book which will interest them. With best wishes to them for health, prosperity and long life, I am, Sincerely,\n\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\n5\n\nErrata.\n\nPage 15-6th line from bottom should read \"Jeremiah Wood.\"\n\n\" 28 — 11th \" \" \" \" \" \"Thomas Drummond.\"\n\n\" 193 — 9th \" \" \" \" \" \"There also was my friend.\"\n\n\" 200 — l8th \" \" \" \" \" \"whose death in 1891.\"\n\n\" 209 — 9th and l0th line from top should read \"draw\" and \"make.\"\n\n\" 299 — 20th line from top should read \"Superintendent of Public Schools.\"\n\n\" 304 — 2d \" \" \" \" \" \"while on their way.\"\n\n\" 304 — 3d \" \" bottom should read \"requiescat in pace.\"\n\n\" 304 — 5th \" \" \" \" \" \"garlands dead.\"\n\nChapter I.\n\nEARLY GALENA.\n\nThe lead mine region of the Northwest is about fifty miles square, lying in the northwestern corner of Illinois and the southwestern part of Wisconsin, with a narrow strip on the west side of the Mississippi river, in the vicinity of Dubuque, Iowa. A few adventurous men came into the region as early as 1821 to engage in mining lead ore, and a larger number in the succeeding five years. They were mostly from Missouri, Kentucky and Southern Illinois, making their way to the mines on horseback, by ox-teams and by keelboats up the Mississippi river. The early best paying \"diggings\" were located west of Fever river, from five to ten miles from La Pointe (afterwards Galena). Their supplies were obtained at a small store or trading post, kept by a Frenchman named Bouthillier, just below and on the opposite side of the river from Frederic's Point, the landing for steamboats, and the head of navigation at an ordinary stage of water. Crude log furnaces were constructed to smelt the ore, and the product of these furnaces was taken to St. Louis by keelboats and by ox-teams overland. The teams occasionally hauled loads to Juneau's Point (afterwards Milwaukee), and to Fort Dearborn (afterwards Chicago). During these years and prior thereto, the Winnebago Indians did some mining, which\n\n6\n\ngave them lead to mold into bullets and buckshot for their guns. They never exported any lead.\n\nBy 1826 the mining operations, which had proved lucrative, began to attract the attention of the country and brought in a large immigration, not only of miners, but also of farmers, merchants, mechanics and a few professional men. The next year brought in a still larger number, and mining centers were formed, each with its store, blacksmith shop, etc. The locating of Galena on Fever river was a matter of accident. Prior to 1826 all supplies for the miners were brought up Fever river and landed at Frederic's Point, a natural landing, and prior to 1827 this landing was known as La Pointe. In the summer of 1826 a street was laid out under the bluff, just below the landing, and named Main street, and the lots were leased for building purposes. A few log houses were erected for dwellings, stores, shops, etc. The fall of that year brought in the greater part of the French-Swiss colony from the Selkirk settlement on Red river. These people having become dissatisfied with the condition of things at the settlement, emigrated in a body to the lead mines to join some of their compatriots already there. Traveling overland to Fort St. Anthony (now Fort Snelling), they obtained passage on a steamboat which had carried supplies to the garrison stationed there, and by it were taken to their destination. The new coiners, all well-to-do financially, chose to locate on government lands and engage in farming.\n\nThe favorable reports from the mining region during the latter part of 1826, induced capitalists to locate there for the purpose of trading, smelting lead ore, etc. In the spring of 1827 two additional streets were laid out in the new town and lots were sold. Steamboats began to run at regular intervals between St. Louis and\n\n7\n\nFever river. By fall the village had more than doubled in population. When the question of obtaining a town charter was being discussed it was proposed to name the town Jackson, in honor of Gen. Jackson, who was popular in the West. Others suggested that it be named Harrison, called after the hero of Tippecanoe, but wiser counsel prevailed, and the more appropriate name Galena, was chosen. The character of the settlers in the lead mines during this year, either to locate in Galena or elsewhere, was much better than that of the previous years.\n\nAmong the large number of enterprising men who located in the town of Galena in 1827 and during the two succeeding years. I can call to my mind Dr. Horatio Newhall. Charles S, Hempstead, Col. James M. Strode, Captain W. B. Green, James G. Soulard, Captain J. B. Atchison, Captain D. B. Morehouse, Captain Orrin Smith, Captain Smith D. Harris, Captain W. H. Hooper, Captain Edward Beebe, Captain G. W. Girdon (the last seven named well-known steamboat captains), Scribe Harris, Ben C. St. Cyr, H. F. McCloskey, Frederick Stahl, Nicholas Bowling, Lucius and Edward Langworthy (afterwards prominent citizens of Dubuque), Thomas Ford (later governor of Illinois), Henry Dodge (general in the Blackhawk war and subsequently U. S. senator), Charles R. Bennett. Daniel Wann (Collector of the port of Galena for a score of years), William Hempstead and Moses Hallet (the first sheriff of the county).\n\nFor the most part the young men named above were as energetic and wide awake as any to be found. Nothing pleased them better than a horse race, a turkey shooting match or a country dance. Shrewd, enterprising and industrious, most of them were successful in their various vocations, W. H. Hooper, trader as well as a steamboat captain, moved west, engaged as a freighter west of the\n\n8\n\nMissouri river, joined the Mormon church, settled in Utah, and was for sixteen years a delegate to congress. Although a Mormon, he never practiced polygamy. He had great energy, much practical intelligence and a charm of manner that won the respect and confidence of his brother members in both houses of congress.\n\nGeorge W. Campbell, who was a successful wholesale grocer at Galena for nearly twoscore years, moved to Chicago during the early part of the civil war and filled a position in the United States commissary department there, with the rank of colonel. A quiet, careful, conservative business man, he always kept his affairs well in hand. He was a member of the First Presbyterian church at Galena and a ruling elder for more than a score of years. His Christian zeal and benevolence led him to do much for the poor and unfortunate in alleviating their needs. It could truly be said of him that he was the poor man's friend.\n\nMy parents came to the lead mines in the spring of 1826, from St. Louis, Mo., where they had lived for two years and where I was born. They were members of the French-Swiss colony which emigrated via Hudson Bay to the Selkirk settlement in British America in 1821 and left there in 1823. They made their way to the Mississippi and down that river in open boats to St. Louis. The climate of Missouri did not agree with them, and when Col. Henry Gratiot, the newly appointed agent to the Winnebago Indians, left St. Louis for the lead mines in 1826 to establish an agency, my parents, with a few of their fellow colonists who were in St. Louis, joined him. The party took passage on one of the first steamboats that ascended the Mississippi above the mouth of the Illinois river, and reached Fever river on the 14th day of April. A beautiful grove on the south side of an undulating prairie, twelve miles north of La Pointe\n\n9\n\n(afterwards Galena), was chosen as the site of the new agency. Col. Gratiot's family, as well as that of my father, were left at La Pointe while suitable buildings were being erected at the agency for their accommodation. Col. Gratiot was joined the next spring by his two brothers, Bion and Paul, who became his partners in the business of mining and smelting lead. There were good \"diggings\" in the vicinity of the agency. They constructed several log furnaces and employed a large number of men to dig ore, run the furnaces, cut and haul wood, etc. The men so employed were usually Canadian ex-trappers and voyageurs, among whom were some half-breed Indians. My father engaged in mining and teaming. The teaming business was a large one, as all the ore dug had to be hauled, to the furnaces to be smelted, and the lead in \"pigs\" was then hauled from the furnaces to La Pointe, on Fever river, for shipment.\n\nIn the three or four years succeeding the establishment of the agency at Gratiots' Grove, the mining operations on the prairie north of there were so successful that it became the attraction for many miners. In after years this tract, known as \"Shullsburg's Survey,\" developed into one of the richest sections of the lead mine region. The flourishing town of Shullsburg, Wisconsin, was built on this tract.\n\nThe rapid increase in the products of the mines in what was called the Galena District brought in a large number of men of capital, who constructed smelting furnaces within fifteen miles of Galena. Some of the earlier ones were the Gratiots, H. H. Gear, Lockwood, Magoon, Hughlett, Meeker, Strawbridge, Hamilton and January. The government, through the war department, exacted from the miner one-tenth of the mineral dug by him as a tax. The miner usually arranged with the smelter to pay this tax, consequently the relations\n\n10\n\nbetween the miner and the smelter were very close, and, to a certain extent, confidential. The furnaces in these early days were crude and inexpensive, and in the process of smelting there was much waste. In the early 30's Burton & Sons constructed near Galena a new, improved and more expensive furnace, patterned after the English furnace style. It was called the \"Cupolo\" furnace and is in general use now.\n\nThe teaming business increased in importance as the mining interests of the country developed. The opening of valuable mines in the northern portions of the lead mine region about Mineral Point increased the number of teams engaged in the carrying business. In the spring teams of four yoke of oxen and a strong canvas covered wagon would leave Southern Illinois for the mines, haul lead to the furnaces, or from the furnaces to the place of shipment, usually Galena, and take a \"back load\" in goods for the traders or supplies for the miners. The teamsters lived in their wagons and cooked their food, which consisted of corn bread, bacon and coffee. The oxen browsed at night, and so obtained a living. Late in the fall these \"outfits\" would return to their southern homes for the winter, sometimes, in the early days, taking a load of lead to St. Louis. These were called \"sucker teams,\" after the sucker fish, which ascends the Mississippi river in the spring and returns late in the fall.\n\nAs early as 1827, Col. James M. Strode, a Kentuckian, located at Galena and put out his \"shingle\" as attorney and counselor at law. He was one of the first lawyers in the village, preceded by only one other, viz: Judge John Turney. He was of splendid physique, tall and straight, and dignified and courteous in manner. He had ability as a lawyer, especially in jury trials. His affability and good nature drew men to him, and he\n\n11\n\nsoon became well known and popular in all that region, When the Blackhawk war broke out, he raised a company of mounted men, and later was elected a colonel of a, small regiment, to which was assigned the duty of scouting in the mining district and in the country east and south of it. His men were ever on the alert and did some efficient work as scouts. The colonel was never engaged in a battle with the Indians, but had a few lively skirmishes with them. During the short war he achieved considerable distinction as an Indian fighter. For many years after the war stories were told of his exploits. Many were doubtless exaggerated, but they never failed to interest the people. His vanity was great, and he seemed to enjoy being thus made a hero. Col. Strode moved to Chicago about the early '50's, and will be remembered by the old Chicago bar and by old citizens of the northern part of the state, as one of the counsel in the famous Birch-Stewart divorce case, which was tried at the county seat of Du Page county.\n\nOne of the most noted men who came to Galena in 1827 was Hezekiah H. Gear, a New Englander, nearing middle life. He was tall, slender, wiry, of irrepressible energy, and soon proved to be a successful business man. He engaged in mining on a large scale, hiring men by the score to do his work, built furnaces and ran them, and also engaged in trading at Galena. At this time he was the wealthiest man in the lead mines. When the Blackhawk war broke out in 1832, he raised a company of mounted volunteers, which he himself commanded. He was elected to the state senate and made a very creditable record. While senator he warmly favored the project to build a railroad from Cairo to Galena, called the \"Illinois Central Railroad,\" and was an active factor in developing the resources of the lead mine region. Later in life he became somewhat erratic, the result of\n\n12\n\nlong mental strain, and \"his right hand forgot its cunning.\"\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Gear, a brother of Captain Gear, was a Protestant Episcopal clergyman, and in the early 30s was rector of a church at Galena. His son, John H. Gear, who was a schoolboy at this time and whom I knew, moved to Fort Snelling Minn., with his father, who had been appointed a chaplain in the United States Army. After the completion of his education he went to Burlington, Iowa, and became a merchant. He was elected to the legislature and was chosen speaker and served two terms. He was soon afterwards elected governor of the state and served four years, and is now one of the United States senators from that state. Governor Gear is a man of quiet disposition, of sound judgment and of fine administrative ability, and has always been popular with the people of his state.\n\nAmong the young men who came to Galena in 1827 were two from New England and who were prominent figures in that place for nearly a half century. They were Charles S. Hempstead and Dr. Horatio Newhall, a practicing physician. The former was a quiet, dignified, urbane man, and an able lawyer, who practiced his profession until past middle life, when he devoted his entire attention to his private affairs. He was a promoter of the Galena and Chicago railroad, the first road to be constructed west of Lake Michigan, and was one of its board of directors for many years. He served in the civil war as a paymaster and was one of Galena's early mayors. His two sons, Edward and Charles, became prominent citizens of Galena, and both moved to Chicago and engaged, the first named in the lumber business, and the second in the practice of his profession as a physician, in which he became distinguished. Dr. New-hall was a man of liberal education, of superior natural\n\n13\n\nability, and was recognized as a skillful practitioner. Both were ruling elders in the First Presbyterian church at Galena during all these years. They were both public spirited citizens, in whom the community had unbounded confidence and held in high esteem. No two other citizens did more to advance its every interest, social, moral and material.\n\nIn the same year (1827) a young Kentuckian made his advent in Galena in the person of John H. Rountree. He was tall, handsome, genial and generous. He turned his attention to mining and located in a mining center near Galena. His industry, energy and rare practical intelligence attracted the attention of his neighbors. Not long after he moved to the village of Platteville, Wis. His success as a business man soon made him prominent, and his kindly manner naturally won for him the friendship of all classes. His cordial greeting and handshake was often regarded by the recipients as a benediction. So much confidence did his neighbors have in his integrity and good judgment, that not infrequently when disagreements arose among them instead of going to a court, they would mutually agree to leave it to Major Rountree for decision. He served in the Blackhawk war as a captain of volunteers, was elected a member of the constitutional convention of his state, was a state senator several terms, and held other positions of trust in his state. He was one of Wisconsin's best known and most highly esteemed citizens.\n\nThe first clergyman to settle in Galena was the Rev. Aratus Kent in 1829. Having completed his theological studies, he came to the lead mines under the auspices of the Home Missionary society. When he made application for a mission he said that he wanted a \"place so hard that no one would take it.\" With commendable Christian zeal he began to canvass the village, to as\n\n14\n\ncertain if it contained any members of the Presbyterian church. A few were found, who gave him a cordial welcome, and arrangements were at once made by them and their friends, without regard to sect, for holding Sunday meetings. A suitable room was secured at the rear of a grocery store and saloon — a combination not unusual in those days. It is related that while the young clergyman was preaching in the rear room, a few citizens, who evidently \"esteemed all days alike,\" were having a quiet game of \"seven up\" in the front room. Mr. Kent organized the first Presbyterian church in Galena in 1831, and bought a frame building adjoining the present stone church building, in which services were held for several years. He was its pastor for nearly a quarter of a century. In the '40s it was the largest and most influential church in the Northwest outside of Chicago. About 1855 he was appointed the General Superintendent of Home Missions for the Northwest. He continued in this work for nearly a score of years, and by his untiring energy accomplished what few other men could have done in establishing religious societies, organizing churches, and in securing missionaries to take charge of them. He also took an active interest in educational matters, and was an important factor, with Elder John Edwards, an old and influential citizen of Rockford as an assistant, in founding Beloit college and the Rockford Female college. During the first decade of his ministrations at Galena he was in the habit of giving one day each week to visiting the villages and hamlets in the lead mine region, going frequently from house to house to ascertain the religious needs of its inmates. He took with him Bibles, tracts and other religious books, which he distributed freely, thereby doing the work usually done by the colportuer. He was generally known at an early date as the \"pioneer missionary,\" and in the\n\n15\n\nlater years of his life as \"Father Kent.\" He was a man of wonderful energy and of deep and earnest piety. I united with his church at an early age, and have always felt deeply grateful to him for his faithfulness in giving me so many valuable moral and religious lessons in my youth, lessons which I have never forgotten.\n\nSoon after the beginning of the '30s Mr. Kent induced Amasa B. Campbell, a graduate of a New England college, to come to Galena and open a first-class school. He intended to enter the ministry, but lack of physical ability caused him to change his mind, and he resolved to be an educator. Mr. Campbell began his work with zeal and energy. He had a well-trained mind and a disposition well adapted for teaching. For fifteen years he carried on his work with untiring devotion, and his school at Galena was regarded as the best in the Northwest. Soon after its opening he had the valuable assistance of his wife, who was a lady of fine natural ability and thoroughly educated. For several years I was a pupil in his school, attending every winter from four to five months. He was of great assistance to his pastor, Mr. Kent, in his arduous work, frequently filling his pulpit when the latter was absent or disabled. Mr. Campbell took a lively interest in his pupils and did more than merely teaching them. In the latter part of the '40s he gave up teaching on account of impaired health, and turned his attention to farming. He was succeeded by George S. Magoun, afterward Rev. Dr. Magoun, President of Iowa college, at Grinnell, Iowa.\n\nMr. John Wood, a college graduate, came to Galena a few years before Mr. Campbell to establish an academy, His project did not succeed. He moved out to Gratiot's Grove, opened a boarding and day school there, ran it for a few years and returned to Galena. I attended his school at Gratiot's Grove one winter. He was a man of\n\n16\n\nability and superior education, and one of its prominent citizens for nearly fifty years. He served as a deacon and ruling elder in the first Presbyterian church during most of these years.\n\n17\n\nChapter II.\n\nTHE BLACKHAWK WAR Of 1832 — GALENA, 1832 TO 1836.\n\nThe Blackhawk war broke out in the early summer of 1832. For six years prior to this event the emigration to the lead mine region had been phenomenally great. The settlers during the latter part of this period were largely of the agricultural class, who had been induced to locate on government lands, not only in the mining districts, but also on the fertile lands south and east of the district. Thus it happened that when roving bands of Indians began their depredation of stealing cattle and horses, burning farm houses and occasionally murdering their inmates, there was a considerable though scattered population in Northwestern Illinois and South western Wisconsin. It will be remembered that the Winnebago Indians in 1827 had become dissatisfied and restless and threatened to take the war path. They asserted that they had received bad treatment from the white settlers in the lead mine region, that they could get no redress, etc. The Indian agent, Col. Henry Gratiot, who had always been on friendly terms with this tribe, at once went to their camps on upper Rock river, and had a \"talk\" with its chiefs, and induced them to delay all action and meet a high official of the government, Gen. Cass, of Michigan, and lay all their grievances before him, promising them that he would rectify all their wrongs and have the wrongdoers punished. The result was that a conference was held and a treaty of peace was made and signed by all the leading chiefs\n\n18\n\nof the tribe. These Indians were the allies of the whites during the war of 1832.\n\nThe Sac tribe of Indians, of which Blackhawk was the chief, had two years before (1829), by treaty, ceeded to the government their lands on Rock river, and had moved to their new reservation on the west side of the Mississippi river in Central and Southern Iowa, and nearly directly west of their reservation in Illinois.\n\nFor some reason never fully understood, Blackhawk moved the greater part of his tribe in the spring of 1832 to his old reservation on lower Rock river. Blackhawk always asserted that his intentions were not hostile. He simply desired to spend the summer on his old hunting grounds, where game was more plenty than on the Des Moines and Iowa rivers, and that lie had brought his squaws and papooses with him showing his peaceful intentions. There was a garrison of United States troops at Fort Armstrong, Rock Island, in command of Gen. Atkinson. The authorities at Washington construed this action on the part of Blackhawk as a violation of the treaty and a declaration of war, and Gen. Atchison was ordered to move his troops against Blackhawk and force him to recross the Mississippi river. Fearing that the force at Fort Armstrong might not be sufficient, the governor of Illinois was ordered to issue a call for volunteers, Blackhawk, finding that he could not recross the Mississippi river below Rock Island without coming in conflict with United States troops, moved his tribe up the valley of Rock river, fighting the white troops, regulars and volunteers, wherever attacked by them.\n\nSmall bands of the younger Indians, on the plea of scouting, went out and began to steal, pillage and burn hay and grain in the stack, burn houses and in some instances committed murder; such bands are now called \"pillagers.\" Blackhawk claimed that he had no control\n\n19\n\nover them and was not aware at the time of their conduct. The act of these pillagers created intense excitement among the white settlers, and their outrages were charged directly to Blackhawk. It has always been evident to me that Blackhawk, finding his retreat cut off, pushed northward, hoping to cross the Mississippi above the Wisconsin river, which he ultimately succeeded in doing, after having lost nearly one-half of his warriors and many of his women and children.\n\nThree years before the war my father located about a half section of government land on Apple river, six miles south of the agency, and lying in Jo Daviess county, Illinois, for a farm. He began to improve it at once, and by the time the war began he had one of the best farms in that section of the country. The family lived on the farm and he divided his time between the farm and his business at the agency. This farm, as I remember it, was an ideal one. On the north side of this beautiful river, large enough to run mills, was an undulating prairie with soil of great fertility, and on the south side, gently rising from the river, was a thick grove, mostly of hard wood, from which no wood or timber had ever been taken. The prairie land and timber or wood land were of nearly equal area. We were near the Indian trail from the agency to the Indian camps on lower Rock river. After the war began reports were circulated to the effect that the Winnebagos would join the Sacs in their war. In the early summer of 1832 the bad conduct of Indians south of us caused the settlers some anxiety, and they became suspicious of the hitherto friendly Winnebagos.\n\nI remember well in the early summer of the war a band of ten or twelve Winnebagos stopping at our farm house at nightfall and asking for food. Bread and meat were given to them and they left. Their conduct led my\n\n20\n\nmother, who understood the Indian character well, to believe they might be bent on doing mischief. Father was at the agency, and she was alone with her five small children, the eldest being only nine years old. The nearest neighbor was nearly a mile away. She barricaded the door for the night, and took as a weapon of defense in case of attack a large four-pronged iron pitchfork. The next evening at about sun down we heard a noisy hand of Indians on the trail less than half a mile distant. It was evident that a part or all of them were under the influence of liquor. Mother was alarmed, and hurriedly gathering up a few valuables took her five little ones to a secluded spot up the river, where stood a stack of hay. She made beds of hay at the foot of the stack for the smaller ones and with the two oldest boys (I being the younger of the two) sat up the livelong night. Father came home the next day, and the family was at once taken to the agency for better protection.\n\nMy father soon after joined a company of mounted volunteers that belonged to Col. Strode's regiment. The company was active as scouts, but never had an engagement with the Indians. One day about the middle of July, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, our village was startled by the news brought by a scout that a large force of hostile Indians was moving on Galena from the east and would attack it by daylight the next morning, and that Gratiot's Grove might be attacked first. As Galena had a stockade and a small force of volunteers, all were ordered to leave for there at once. There we had no stockade nor troops and were entirely unprotected. All the horse teams and saddle horses were brought out. The women and children were crowded in the wagons. The men and boys took the horses, two on a horse. When it came my turn to mount, I found that my only chance to ride was the third seat on a horse, a Canadian and a young\n\n21\n\ncolored girl of eighteen were to ride in front of me. A few men with arms volunteered to stay and defend the government stores at the agency warehouse. Soon after 3 o'clock the procession moved off at a rapid rate. When we had made about two-thirds of the twelve miles to Galena, we were met by a messenger, who informed us that the alarm was a false one, that no Indians had been seen, etc. Most of the villagers turned back to their homes. A few went on to Galena. I was permitted to go, and boy like, had a good time.\n\nThe big scare narrated above induced the villagers and the settlers in the vicinity to begin the construction of a stockade around the two buildings used as a store house for the government Indian supplies. As nearly all the able-bodied men had joined the mounted company of volunteers, it was left to the old men, women and boys to do the work. Men were set to work felling trees and cutting logs about eighteen inches in diameter and twenty-five feet long, which were dragged a half a mile or more to the agency storehouse. A trench three feet in depth was dug, when the logs were set up on end in it. Every log had its upper end sharpened. It fell to ray lot, though less than eight years of age, to drive two yoke of oxen to drag the logs from the forest. It took several weeks to complete the stockade. All the settlers felt greatly relieved after its completion, and only once were they all brought into it for one night before the close of the war, about a month later. During the time we were constructing our stockade the settlers at Elizabeth, fifteen miles east of Galena, were attacked by a small force of Indians, probably \"pillagers.\" Their stockade had been completed and the Indians were repulsed after an irregular fight of several hours. Much ammunition was expended, and when the supply of bullets was exhausted the women went to work moulding a new supply. The settlers lost only one man.\n\n22\n\nThis Indian war, as well as the serious trouble with the Winnebagos five years before, which came nigh to an open conflict, were unnecessary. In both instances the white settlers were to blame. In 1826 and 1827 the miners and keelboat men treated the Indians and their squaws not only harshly, but often brutally. In the latter case, had the military authorities been more prudent, and, instead of sending an armed force to fight, instituted an inquiry into the reasons for Blackhawk's violation of the provisions of the treaty of 1829 in leaving his reservation on the west side of the Mississippi, all would have been explained satisfactorily and a bloody war averted. To show how unfair and unmilitary was the conduct of the volunteers, I will state that when Blackhawk was camped some distance north of Dixon, where were rendezvoused some three hundred volunteers in command of Major Stillman, one company was detailed under command of Major Stillman to find the Indians under Blackhawk. After a short day's ride, they went into camp not far from the Indian encampment. Towards evening Blackhawk sent a flag of truce to the camp of the volunteer company to say \"that he wanted to talk to them; that he did not want to fight. Some of the white men, probably under the influence of liquor, deliberately fired upon the Indians with the flag of truce, and killed three of the five. The two who escaped injury reported to Blackhawk what had happened. He immediately sent out a force of men to do battle. After a few volleys at long range the volunteers fled, some going to Dixon to report a great and bloody battle, but most of them to their homes, and were not seen again during the war. The whites lost eleven men, mostly killed while retreating, and the Indians five men. The\n\n23\n\nabove describes the battle of Stillman's Creek, of which much has been said and written. The foregoing account is from the written statement of J. W. Spencer of Rock Island, a participant in the battle and a man of respectability and probity.\n\nAfter the war, matters generally in the Northwest assumed their normal conditions. The miners suffered but little loss from the war but the farmers in many localities lost their entire crops. The influx of settlers continued, both as miners and farmers, and by the year 1836 there seemed to be a general condition of prosperity. In 1831 a newspaper was established in Galena called the \"Miners' Journal.\" Drs. Phileo and Newhall the editors and proprietors, continued its publication until 1834. Dr. Phileo was the war correspondent of the \"Miners' Journal,\" and much information given by him of the Blackhawk war is reliable and has historical value. In 1834 the \"Miners' Journal\" was bought by H. H. Honghton, a practical newspaper man, who changed the name to the \"Galena Gazette and Northwestern Advertiser,\" Mr. Bartlett becoming publisher and business manager. Mr. Bartlett, after a few years, discontinued his connection with the paper and went to Armenia, Turkey, as a missionary, where he took charge of the first missionary paper published in that country. Mr. Houghton continued as editor until about 1860, when he retired, and J. B. Brown succeeded him as editor and proprietor. Mr. Houghton was a man of broad education, general intelligence, quiet energy and always intensely loyal to his country and true to his friends. The \"Gazette\" is still published, now as a daily and weekly, and is in its sixty-fifth year. I read the paper first in 1834, and have read it continuously since. It has followed me to the army and to Europe during my four years' residence there.\n\n24\n\nIn the spring of 1834 my father sold his Apple River farm, gave up his business at Gratiot's Grove and moved to Galena, where there were good schools to which his children could be sent. He rented a farm near Galena, known as the \"Bennett farm,\" on which his family could live while he was improving attract of government land a mile and a half west of Galena on the Mineral Point road. His neighbors north of him who located lands at the same time were James G. Soulard, Captain John Atchison and E. Lytle, and south Francis Longet and Alfred Quinch. This farm or homestead was increased in area in after years, so that in the '60s it was generally regarded as the best farm for stock breeding and the growing of mixed crops of any in the county. Although reduced in size, it is still in the family and owned by Captain H. B. Chetlain, my younger brother, who is one of the best known and highly esteemed men of the lead mine region.\n\nFor nearly a score of years after the death of my tattler in 1872, this large property was managed by my eldest brother, Frederic Chetlain, a man of sound Judgment, of excellent executive ability, of genuine kindliness of disposition, of unostentatious piety and of sturdy honesty.\n\nI remained with my father on the farm until after the middle of the '40s, when I took a position in a wholesale mercantile house in Galena as clerk. When I was seventeen years of age. I obtained a practical knowledge of horticulture and floriculture from my father's old friend and neighbor, Mr. James G. Soulard, who had for years given his personal attention to these branches of industry, especially the former. He had wealth, and was ardently attached to the business, from sheer love of it He spent large sums of money in bringing from the East, and often from Europe, rare fruit trees, plants and\n\n25\n\nshrubs, constantly making experiments to ascertain what kinds were best suited to the climate and soil of Northern Illinois, and all this was done, not for personal gain, but from a desire to give to the settlers of the region the best that could be cultivated with success. He introduced in the early '40s, the Bed River Beardless wheat and the Bolles variety of corn, both well adapted to the soil and climate of that region. In all this he proved himself a public benefactor. My object in familiarizing myself with horticulture especially, was that my bent of mind and taste led me to choose this industry and follow it after reaching manhood. Both myself and my older brother, Frederic, had inherited this taste in this matter from our mother, who was an ardent lover of plants and flowers.\n\n26\n\nChapter III.\n\nGALENA, 1836 TO 1850 — SKETCHES Of PROMINENT CITIZENS.\n\nThe great financial depression which swept over this country in 1837 was felt more keenly in the older sections of the country than in the newer. The lead mine region, settled at first by miners and traders, had received after the Blackhawk war of 1832 a large influx of people, who settled on government lands and cultivated them. The inducements for engaging in farming were great, as the miners could get their supply of flour, meats, potatoes, etc., near home, instead of having to rely for such supplies from Missouri and other points south. The farmers who located on lands in the mining district and on lands south and east of it, as far as Rock river, always had a ready sale for all their farm products, cattle and hogs, for ready money at satisfactory prices. In the early '40s lead ore commanded a good price, and the total yield or output of the mines amounted to over a million dollars a year. Moreover, the miners having refused currency for their mineral, and the American gold being difficult to get, English sovereigns were imported and paid to the miners at $4.90, being a little more than their real value. Many failures occurred throughout the country among business men, owing in a great measure to depreciated paper money then in general use Few failures occurred in the mining district, and a time of comparative prosperity was enjoyed by all classes.\n\nThis favorable condition of things in the lead mine region attracted the attention of people all over the\n\n27\n\ncountry, and naturally the wide-awake and enterprising, especially among the young men, sought the new Eldorado. From 1838 to say 1845, a large number of lawyers, physicians, traders, mechanics and some capitalists made their way to Galena, the principal town of the district, and settled there. Among those who were thus attracted were a number of young lawyers, principally from the Atlantic states. Many of them, after having practiced their profession from a half score to a score of years, and when other places offered greater inducements to make money, left Galena, some going to Chicago and others to California and other western states. Out of the large number who located in Galena and moved to other places, an unusual proportion met with phenomenal success, some achieving great distinction. I was acquainted with nearly all these professional and business men and can write of them knowingly. In the following pages I will give my own impressions of these men and of others who settled here at an earlier time.\n\nThe bar of Galena received an accession in the latter part of the '40s in the advent of a young lawyer from Massachusetts named Benjamin R. Sheldon, who began the practice of his profession in an unostentatious way. He was liberally educated, of a retiring disposition and of courteous manner. As a business lawyer he had few equals at that bar, and his practice as a counselor was large and lucrative. Moreover, he was regarded by his associates at the bar as not only a sound, but a profound lawyer as well. He was elected judge of the circuit court of the district of Galena, and after several years' service, was elected associate judge of the supreme court of the state, and later was chosen its Chief Justice. Judge Sheldon had the reputation of being one of the best judges of that court. His opinions were regarded as sound, and were treated with consideration. He never\n\n28\n\nmarried. At his death in 1896 he left an estate valued at nearly two million dollars.\n\nBen H. Campbell located in Galena in 1835, and soon after began business as a wholesale grocery merchant and continued in that business for over thirty-years. In the '50s his business, extending into the lumber district of Central and Northern Wisconsin, was the largest of any other in the Northwest. In the latter part of the '60s he moved to Chicago to assume the duties of United States Marshal of the district of Northern Illinois, to which position he had been appointed as the successor of the Hon. J. Russell Jones, formerly a successful wholesale merchant at Galena, who had been appointed by President Grant United States Minister to Belgium. I remember him well when he came to Galena at that early time. He was a handsome young man of vivacity, genial manner, kindly disposition, and evidently the leader of a group of young men with whom be associated. In later years he was regarded as one of the shrewdest business men of that region. During his term of service of eight years as United States Marshal be became well known to the business men of Chicago and to the bar of the state.\n\nAmong the young lawyers who came to Galena in 1836 was Thomas W. Drummond. He was from the state of Maine, had received a college education, was well versed in law, and soon took a high position at the bar. Of a retiring disposition and courteous manner, he became popular with his fellow citizens. He took an active interest as a Whig in the noted political campaign of 1840, was elected a member of the state legislature and soon after judge of the circuit court of the Galena district and served for several years, proving a learned and impartial judge. He was appointed judge of the United States district of Illinois in 1850. Some years\n\n29\n\nlater he was appointed judge of the United States Circuit Court and moved to Chicago. He served in that court until 1884, when he resigned and retired to private life. During his long term of service on the bench he earned the reputation of being one of the ablest judges on the Federal bench. I knew him well all these years, and admired him for his simplicity of character, amiable disposition and varied and profound learning. He was one of the most entertaining men in conversation I ever knew. Some time after the civil war, while in conversation with him, I said: \"Judge, the first time I saw you at Galena I thought you were the best dressed man I had ever seen. You wore a silk hat, dark blue swallow-tail cloth coat with gilt buttons, and a light drab vest and pantaloons.\" He laughed and replied: \"I remember well that suit of clothes. When I was about to leave Boston, I was told that I was going to a town where professional men dressed well, and that I must do the same. I bought the suit you mention, wore it a few times at Galena, when I came to the conclusion that it was not just the thing, and laid it away.\" The judge was always neatly but inexpensively dressed.\n\nIn the latter part of the '30s William H. Bradley, a young lawyer, arrived in Galena. He was bright and good-looking, of a charming personality, great energy and of much business tact. He did not practice his profession, but entered into business. An active and ardent Whig, he soon became a power in local politics. He was appointed clerk of the circuit court, which position he held for several advancing the moral and material interests of the community years. He was a natural leader of men. In church, in politics and in business affairs he proved himself such. His popularity was great, and he became an active factor in advancing the moral and material interests of the community. He was appointed clerk of the United States district court (Judge Drummonds) in\n\n30\n\nthe '50s and moved to Chicago. He filled the position with marked ability for over twenty-five years. During that time he became well known to and was highly esteemed by all the people of the state. I knew Mr. Bradley for nearly half a century, and I regard him as one of the strongest and best characters I ever knew.\n\nA few years after Judge Drummond had opened a law office in Galena, there came into his office a young lawyer from Eastern New York named J. M. Douglas. Modest and studious, and of more than average natural ability, he began his profession and soon won a reputation as a successful lawyer in the trial of mining cases. His success was largely due to the pains he took in the preparation of his cases. Often before the trial of such a case he would hire a horse, ride out to the \"diggings,\" carefully inspect the premises by going down the mining shaft, and then try the case, usually before a justice court, for which expense and work he would receive the fee customary in such cases. His industry and careful saving of his earnings were known to all his friends, On one occasion, after the trial of a mining case, while pacing the floor of the office, he turned to Judge Drummond and putting his hand on his pocket, with his characteristic smile, said: \"Drummond, money in a man's pocket is his best friend.\" There was in his pocket the comparatively small fee just received from a client who had had his claim \"jumped.\" Douglas became the attorney of the Illinois Central railroad and moved to Chicago. His ability as attorney induced the board of directors to place him at the head of the management by electing him president. Under his forceful energy and tireless industry the affairs of this great corporation prospered. With him it was work, work, early and late, and all employes under him had to do the same. Douglas worked too hard. His brain gave way in time, and he was compelled\n\n31\n\nto seek rest and quiet on his farm in Jo Daviess county.\n\nIn the latter part of the '30s there appeared at Galena two young lawyers whose advent created some stir among the half score of lawyers who composed the Galena bar. They were Joseph P. Hoge and Thompson Campbell, the former from Maryland and the latter from Pennsylvania. Both were well educated, and equally excellent lawyers. Both had the rare gift of oratory, but Campbell the keener intellect and was the wit of the bar. Hoge was tall, of symmetrical figure, and dressed with exquisite taste. Both were Democrats and intensely partisan, and became leaders in the Democracy of the state. They stood high at the bar and each had a lucrative practice. Hoge was elected to congress in 1849 and served one term, and made an enviable record as a representative. Not long after he moved to California and practiced his profession in San Francisco and was elected district judge. He was a prominent candidate for United States senator just before the civil war, but his affiliations with Southern men who had left the South to avoid the discomfort incident to war, which was regarded as inevitable, cast a shade of doubt as to his loyalty to the Union, and, although the favorate of the Democrats of the state, Satterly, a man of inferior ability, was chosen. It became clear later that Hoge had been misjudged, for his loyalty to the Union was sincere. Campbell, who had been the secretary of state under Governor Ford, was elected to congress from the Galena district to succeed Hoge and served one term. He was succeeded by E. B. Washburne. Campbell, whose ability as a lawyer was everywhere recognized, was appointed by President Pierce judge of the United States Land Court of California, which position he held for many years before his death.\n\n32\n\nCampbell was a favorite with the bar of the state. His slight but graceful figure, keen and ready wit, and gentle and polished manner made him a favorite in society as well.\n\nSamuel M. Wilson located in Galena as a lawyer about 1840 and became Hoge's law partner. He was a close student, of untiring industry, and as a business lawyer had few equals at the bar. He removed to California with his partner and practiced his profession in San Francisco. He took a high position at that bar and was elected attorney for the Bank of California at an exceptionally large salary, which position he held for nearly a quarter of a century before his death. He has two sons in San Francisco, who have inherited much of their father's ability and who are successful practitioners at the San Francisco bar.\n\nTwo young lawyers came to Galena about that time and opened the law office of Higgins & Higgins. The elder, Van H. Higgins, took a prominent position among the lawyers of the place. He was broadly educated, learned in law, of exceptional ability in the trial of cases, and had the rare faculty of attracting men to him. He moved to Chicago in the early '50s and began his practice there. He was elected judge of the Superior Court of Cook county just before the civil war. He filled the position one term, proving himself an able and conscientious jurist. After leaving the bench he devoted himself to his private affairs. He had great industry, fine administrative ability, and met with success. At the time of his death, in the latter '90s, he had accumulated a very large fortune.\n\nOne of the most unique figures that came to the lead mines in the early '40s was Thomas Hoyne, a young lawyer from New York city, who began the practice of law in Galena. His industry, intense energy and superior\n\n33\n\nattainments as a lawyer, brought him into prominence at the bar. He was, although at times brusque in manner, kind-hearted and affable. He was an ardent Democrat and became a leader in his party. His convictions were decided and firm, and he was bold and fearless in their advocacy. After a few years' residence in Galena he removed to Chicago. His strong personality impressed itself on the people of that city, and he soon became one of its most prominent citizens. He was foremost in every scheme or enterprise undertaken to benefit the community. He won distinction at the bar of the state, and had the reputation of being, not only a learned lawyer, but also that of a forceful and convincing speaker. He had much of the spirit of the philanthropist and humanitarian, and was identified with many local charities. His untimely death by a railroad accident some years ago, was a great and almost irreparable loss to his adopted city.\n\nPhil A. Hoyne, brother of Thomas Hoyne, accompanied him to Galena and entered a business house as a clerk, and not long afterwards engaged in business on his own account. In 1852 he followed his brother to Chicago, when, after studying law, he was appointed United States commissioner and commissioner of deeds for all the states, which position he held for over a quarter of a century. He became one of the best known and most highly esteemed citizens of that city. He was a pronounced Republican, and in his quiet way was a power in the party, not only in the city, but in the county and state as well. Large-brained, large-hearted, of frank manner, and of amiability of disposition, he was one of Chicago's most popular citizens.\n\nCol. Edward D. Baker came to Galena from Springfield, Ill., where be had served in both houses of the legislature and had been elected a member of congress and\n\n34\n\nserved one term. He was regarded as the most brilliant orator in the state and had ability as a lawyer, but lacked industry and application. In the Mexican war he commanded a regiment and won distinction. He was elected in 1848 to congress as a Whig, to represent the Galena district, and served one term without gaining much reputation. Soon after he removed to California and practiced his profession in San Francisco, ran for congress and was defeated, then removed to Oregon, and was there elected United States senator. When the civil war broke out, he raised and commanded a regiment of volunteers, was soon appointed a brigadier general, and was killed at Ball's Bluff early in the war. I knew Col. Baker well at Galena. He was a man so full of good nature and of manner so charming, that one was naturally drawn to him. As a stump speaker I have never heard his equal. He was positively fascinating.\n\nIn 1839 there came to Galena a singular character, in the person of Cyrus B. Denio, from the state of Mississippi; a Whig of the most pronounced type, who immediately attracted notice. Without much education he was intelligent, tactful and gifted as a fluent and forcible speaker. He entered the political campaign of 1840 and canvassed, not only the lead mine region, but other portions of the state. He was a bricklayer by trade and was known as the \"Mississippi Bricklayer.\" He was originally from Buffalo, N. Y. This man, with the certain kind of energy he possessed and shrewdness withal, became a prominent and influential leader of the Whig party. He was elected a member of the general assembly of Illinois and made a most creditable record. He was re-elected and served a second term. His frank and easy manner, kindness of disposition and peculiar kind of homely wit made him a favorite, not only among his brother members, but also with the average citizen. He\n\n35\n\nwas appointed by President Lincoln superintendent of the force engaged in the construction of the public works at Mare Island, Cal, which position he held fur several years. He also became a political leader in Northern California.\n\nAbout 1842 another young lawyer appeared in Galena named C. W. Churchman, and located there to practice law. The advent of this brilliant lawyer from the South had been heralded, and there was general curiosity to see and know him. In physique he was of medium height and size, with dark complexion, piercing black eyes, and a manner both dignified and courteous. He had the gift of oratory and was a pleasing and forcible speaker. He soon took a high position at the bar and business came to him rapidly. His success in jury trials was exceptionally great. An old practitioner at that bar told me years afterwards that Churchman was the hardest man to beat in a trial before a jury he had ever met. His habits were somewhat irregular, which militated against his success as a practitioner. After having practiced his profession in Galena for a decade, in a fit of anger or disgust, he left for the far West, on foot with a rifle on his shoulder, joined an emigrant train near the Missouri river starting for California, and crossed the plains with it. He continued the practice of law in some flourishing mining town and became an active politician, affiliating with the Democrats. His reputation as a stump speaker soon became known and the honors were divided between him and my old friend, Frank M. Pixley, editor and proprietor of tin San Francisco \"Argonaut.\" Churchman ran as a Democrat for congress, made a brilliant canvass, but was defeated. Pixley was also nominated as a Republican in another district and was also defeated. Churchman, when making his canvass in the villages and hamlets of mining districts,\n\n36\n\nrode a spotted broncho horse and Pixley a large mouse-colored Kentucky mule. Each was advertised in his district by posters \"‘Churchman and his Broncho’, and Pixley and his Mule will he here to address the citizens,\" etc,\n\nIn 1868, when I was in Utah as United States assessor of internal revenue, I had occasion to visit officially the newly discovered gold mines of the Sweetwater Pass, in the northwestern corner of Wyoming. While there, Lawyer Churchman called upon me and made himself known. He was well dressed and had the look of a man doing well. His face, however, indicated that he had been living fast. He said he was doing well and gave me some account of his \"ups and downs\" in California in the twenty-five years previous. During the next early winter I had occasion to visit the city of Echo Canon, in Utah, forty miles east of Salt Lake City. I met Churchman again, who was in a very dilapidated condition; in fact he was a tramp and in the last stages of alcoholism. He died a few months later, utterly destitute and friendless, and was buried in a pauper's grave. Alas, poor Churchman — he had been good to every one except himself.\n\nAbout the middle of the '40s Robert S. Blackwell, a young lawyer, located in Galena to practice law, and attracted the attention of the bar and the citizens generally by his unique appearance. He was a tall, blackhaired, well dressed, jovial young fellow, who made friends rapidly. Well educated, industrious and energetic, he soon won the respect of his confreres in the profession. He was a good speaker and a good story teller. When he could get a group of his friends together he would indulge in recitations, story telling, etc. greatly to their gratification. He removed to Springfield and then to Chicago, where he became well known to\n\n37\n\nthe bar of Chicago and the state through his valuable book \"Blackwell on Tax Titles,\" which had a wide circulation and was regarded as a reliable work.\n\nAbout 1845 an accession to the Galena bar was made in the person of a young lawyer named Orville C. Pratt, from the state of New York. He was a handsome man, who had just married a lady of rare beauty and accomplishments. He was associated with Van Higgins in practice for a while and was regarded by his brothers at the bar as a young lawyer of unusual ability, was a speaker of fluency and force, he was elected a member of the legislature and made a creditable record. He removed to California and then to Oregon, where he was appointed chief justice of the supreme court of the territory, which position he filled for many years. Besides being learned as a jurist, he was a successful man of affairs and accumulated a large fortune before his death.\n\nOne of the most remarkable men who settled in the Northwest in the early '30s was George W. Jones, who without being a really great man, was conspicuous for half a century as a public man, much of the time being in the National Legislature as a representative and senator. He was a native of Virginia. For some years after going west he resided at Sinsinawa Mound, ten miles northwest of Galena, and filled the position of surveyor general of the territory of the Northwest, which included Wisconsin and Iowa, He moved to Dubuque, Iowa, and was elected a member of congress and afterwards United States senator, which position he held for twelve years, when he was appointed United States minister resident at Bogota, New Grenada, by President Buchanan. He became acquainted with Jefferson Davis when he (Davis) was a lieutenant in the United States army at Fort Crawford, Prairie du Chien, and was a close friend ever after. At the breaking out of the war,\n\n38\n\nand when United States minister at Bogota, some of his correspondence with President Davis, of the Confederate states, was accidentally discovered, which led to his recall and imprisonment at; Fort LaFayette. He was subsequently released, but never again entered into politics Gen. Jones had great energy, general intelligence, a handsome person, and his suavity and attractive manner led to his being called the \"Chesterfield\" of Washington society. I saw the general a short time before his death (1896), when he was 92 years of age and still active and his mental faculties unimpaired. For a half score of years before his death he appreciated and regretted the mistake he had made in 1861, and became a thoroughly loyal citizen.\n\nThe spring of 1840 witnessed the advent in Galena of Elihu B. Washburne, from the state of Maine, a young lawyer recently a graduate from the Harvard Law school. I saw him for the first time at a Whig political meeting, where he made his maiden speech in the West as a politician. The address was described by an old citizen who had heard it as a \"rattling good speech.\" It was the talk on the streets for several days after. As I remember him he was of medium height, of slight build, fair faced, well dressed, with an air about him that indicated energy and pluck. He took an active part in the memorable political campaign of 1840, and won laurels everywhere as a stump speaker. He associated himself for the practice of law with the Hon. Charles S. Hempstead, and at once took a high position at the Galena bar, which had at that time a large number of very able lawyers. All I will say about him now is that his career in public life, beginning in Galena, where he lived thirty years, was a remarkable one, and has hardly a parallel in this country. His indomitable will, forceful energy and untiring industry, keen discrimination\n\n39\n\nand sturdy integrity carried him from the country printing office in Maine through twelve years of successful practice as a lawyer, eight consecutive terms in congress, the Department of State as its Secretary, and United States Ambassador to France for eight years, where he achieved a world-wide reputation as a fearless, able and efficient official. I knew Mr. Washburne during his brilliant career, and for a quarter of a century before his death he was one of my most intimate friends.\n\nCadwallader C. Washburn, a younger brother of Elihu, came to Galena in 1842 and studied law with the Hon. Joseph B. Wells, a distinguished lawyer at the Galena bar, and afterwards moved to Mineral Point, Wis., in the northern part of the lead mines, where he formed a co partnership with Cyrus Woodman (now of New York city), a banker and extensive land agent. He never practiced his profession. He soon developed into a shrewd, practical and successful business man. In energy, will power, industry and tenacity of purpose he resembled his brother Elihu. His firm was the agent of the \"New England Land Company,\" and when, in 1846, the state of Wisconsin put several million acres of school lands (mostly pine) into the market, the firm of Washburn & Woodman was made one of its agents. The lands were sold at an average of fifty cents per acre. Cadwallader bought all he could and induced his brother Elihu to do likewise. The latter bought some ten thousand acres of choice pine lands at the low price given above. Washburne like, he held these lands, paying the taxes which were nominal, until in the '80s, when he began to sell them. The greater portion were sold for over $20 per acre. The result of this venture made a large part of the handsome fortune he left at his death in 1887. In the '50s Cadwallader Washburn engaged largely in the manufacture of lumber at La\n\n40\n\nCrosse, Wis. and afterwards began the manufacture of flour at Minneapolis by an improved process with great success. He had as a partner in this enterprise his cousin, Dorilus Morrison, who for many years before had been an extensive manufacturer of lumber at St. Anthony Falls (Minneapolis). Mr. Morrison was an exceptionally shrewd and level-headed business man, who operated on lines that invariably led to success. He also established extensive woolen mills in Minneapolis. At his death, a few years ago, he was regarded as one of the wealthiest men in Minnesota. Mr. Washburn was elected to congress twice from the La Crosse, Wis., district, and made a splendid record as an able, conscientious and conservative representative. At the breaking out of the civil war he raised a regiment of cavalry, and before the end of the war was made a major general of volunteers. He was later elected governor of Wisconsin. At the time of his death he was a multi-millionaire.\n\nThere sat in my Sunday school class at Galena in the latter part of the '40s a bright-eyed, large-headed, quiet boy of ten or twelve years of age, named Moses Hallett, the son of the first sheriff of our county. When he reached his majority, he studied law and was admitted to practice, and soon after went to Pike's Peak, Colo. He located in Denver, practiced his profession there, and was elected to the Territorial legislature. His strong practical sense, good judgment, industry and correct habits brought him to the favorable notice of the bar and of the citizens of Denver. President Lincoln appointed him chief justice of the supreme court of the territory, and, after Colorado had become a state, Judge Hallet was elected chief justice of the new state. He has filled the honorable position ever since. Of such a record few men in the far West can boast. His wise and able decisions, especially in litigation growing out of\n\n41\n\nmining claims, have been accepted by the bench in other states as sound. Judge Hallett has a judicial mind, cold blood judgment, and is impartial and conscientious.\n\nMadison Y. Johnson, a lawyer from the South, located in Galena the latter part of the '30s. He was a Whig and an ardent partisan and took an active part in politics, doing much effective work as a \"stump speaker.\" His presence was striking; he was tall, broad-shouldered, of swarthy complexion, bushy black hair, and had a strong face. A man of much vanity, but of popular manners and a certain kind of dogged tenacity. He had the reputation of being a good jury lawyer, hence his success. After the Whig party had broken up, he affiliated with the Democrats and become a leader of prominence in the party. After the breaking out of the civil war, being an intense Southern sympathizer, he was charged with discouraging enlistments, arrested and sent to Fort LaFayette. He was soon released, and returned to his practice in Galena, a more quiet and probably a wiser man.\n\nOf the score or more of lawyers practicing at the bar of the small commercial town of Galena in the '40s and '50s, many of them remarkable men who afterwards achieved great distinction in other parts of the country, only four are now (1899) living, and strange to say, three of the four are residents of Galena: Mr. J. N. Jewett, the fourth, is in Chicago in the active practice of his profession. The rest have all died. The three in Galena are Wellington W. Weigley, Robert H. McClellan and David Sheean. The first named (now retired from active practice) was one of Galena's earliest lawyers who always stood high in his profession. His industry, tact and ability, to which was added the rare gift of oratory, assured him success as a practitioner. As a jury lawyer he had few equals.\n\n42\n\nRobert H. McClellan, who in the early '40s came to Galena from the law office of Martin I. Townsend at Troy, N. Y., afterwards a prominent politician and distinguished member of congress, had a strong and well-trained mind, a keen intellect, great industry, and was regarded by the old bar of Galena as one of its most learned members. In 1861 he was elected a member of the lower house of the legislature, and in the '70s to the state senate. He made a most excellent record in both instances. He was a prominent Republican, and after leaving the state senate, had he been as ambitious for preferment as the average citizen, he could have received the nomination for congress in his district, which would have been equivalent to an election. I have no doubt that had he tilled the position he would have made such a reputation as would have assured him still higher honors in his state. He has been a shrewd and discriminating business man and has accumulated a very large fortune.\n\nDavid Sheean who was associated with General Rawlins in Galena in the practice of law before the war, has a judicial mind, is a careful, studious, able and successful lawyer, and has been a leader in the Democratic party for many years. Had he been ambitious for political preferment, he might have filled high positions of trust in his state. His younger brother, Thomas J. Sheean, who is associated with him in practice, has a high reputation for learning, tact and energy.\n\nIn the autumn of 1847 I went to Elyria, Ohio, to marry Miss Emily Tenney, a young lady whose acquaintance I had made the year before in Galena. She had a fine physique, a strong intellect, and was well educated, unassuming and amiable. To give the reader some idea of the difficulties of travel in the West fifty years ago, as compared with the present, I will say that to reach\n\n43\n\nElyria I had to go by stage from Galena to Milwaukee, where I took a steamer for Cleveland, and there a stage for twenty-five miles to my destination. After our marriage, it having become too late in the season to return by the lakes, we took a carriage and crossed the state of Ohio to the nearest point on the Ohio river, where we took a steamer for St. Louis, and then an Upper Mississippi river steamer for Galena. It took me eight days to reach Elyria, and twelve days from Elyria to Galena. The journey from Galena to Elyria is now made in twenty hours. Eighteen months after our marriage my wife died, leaving a little boy, Arthur Henry, only a few days old. Miss Tenney, before our marriage, lived for some time with intimate friends, the family of Dr. Norton S. Townshend in Elyria, a practicing physician of some celebrity. I became well acquainted with the doctor in after years. He was born in England and brought to this country by his parents when a child: was an original abolitionist and one of Ohio's earliest and most active Freesoilers, and when a member of the lower house of the Ohio legislature was an important factor in the election of Judge Salmon P. Chase to the United States senate. The legislature on joint ballot was equally divided between Whigs and Democrats; with Dr. Townshend and another member as Freesoilers who held the balance of power. A deadlock of several weeks was the result. A compromise was finally effected by the choice of Judge Chase for United States senator, the nominee of the two Freesoil members. Dr. Townshend was elected a member of congress soon after, and when in Washington was a prominent figure in a group of Freesoilers headed by Senator Chase, with the \"National Era\" as the party organ, edited by Dr. Bailey, assisted by the graceful and forcible writer, Louis Clephane. Judge Chase's election to the United States senate was\n\n44\n\nthe beginning of his brilliant career as a statesman, which gives the foregoing facts in regard to his election much interest.\n\nThe Democratic party of the lead mine region was usually in the majority during the '40s. Unlike the Whig party, which had a well conducted organ in the Galena Gazette, its organ at Galena was decidedly a \"weakling.\" Its leaders determined on making a change. Two young men from Ohio, who were practical newspaper men were induced to come to Galena and start a first-class paper to be the organ of the party. Horace A. Tenney and Henry W. Tenny, brothers, in 1845 bought out the old plant and began the publication of the \"Jeffersonian.\" They were both graduates of Middlebury college, Vermont, and both practical printers. Horace, the elder, assumed the business management and Henry was editor-in-chief. As he was a polished and forcible writer, his editorials were able and practical and were often reproduced by other papers in the Northwest. At the end of two years it was found that the paper \"didn't pay.\" A chronicler of events in Illinois at that time, when writing of newspapers, said that the \"Jeffersonian,\" under the management of the Tenneys, was unquestionably the best newspaper in the state. The Tenneys sold out their paper and Horace moved to Madison, Wis., and assumed the management of the \"Wisconsin Argus, a Democratic paper of prominence. At that time the politics of the state was badly \"mixed\" and party feeling ran high. The \"Argus\" fought the Whig officials, past and present, and known as \"Barstow and the balance,\" with vigor. Horace Tenney's editorials were bold, fearless and trenchant. \"My purpose,\" he said, \"is to make the ‘Argus’ a terror to the evil-doer.\" He continued as its manager several years. Henry Tenney went to Milwaukee, where, having previously studied\n\n45\n\nlaw and been admitted to the bar, he began the practice of his profession. In the '60s he removed to Chicago and entered the law office, as partner, of his brother, D. K. Tenney, a well-known, able and successful business lawyer. After a half-score years of successful practice, he returned to Wisconsin and retired from active practice.\n\n46\n\nChapter IV.\n\nGALENA, AND the NORTHWEST IN THE '50s.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1856 were Galena's \"halcyon\" days. It was then the most important commercial metropolis in the Northwest. Its trade, which began in the later '30s, continued to increase steadily as the country developed until beyond the middle of the '50s. In 1856 the statistics show that Galena did a larger wholesale business than Chicago Lines of fine steamboats plied between St. Louis and Galena bringing in merchandise and general supplies, and taking back lead and farming products. Then a line of first-class steamboats ran between Galena and St. Paul. The \"Northwestern Packet Company\" was organized in 1852, with Ben H. Campbell as president and J. Russell Jones as secretary. It built some six or eight of the finest and fleetest steamboats that ever ran on the upper Mississippi river, and its business, far into the, 60s was large and lucrative. I have known in the busy season twelve to fifteen steamboats lying at the wharf of Galena at one time loading and unloading freight. The construction of the Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien railroad and the Galena and Chicago railroad seriously affected the trade of Galena. After 1856 its wholesale business declined year by year, so that by the close of the civil war, nearly one-half of its wholesale houses had either closed or moved elsewhere.\n\nNear the close of the '40s the tide of emigration, mostly from the East, set in toward Northwestern Wisconsin, Northern Iowa and Minnesota. The supplies for\n\n47\n\nthe new settlers up to 1853 were nearly all obtained in Galena. Moreover, the output of the lead mines continued unimpaired, with an advance in the price of lead. Thus Galena's prosperity can be accounted for until it was checked by the construction of two railroads from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi river, already stated, and the general financial depression of 1857, which seriously affected the prosperity of the whole country.\n\nIn 1852 I began business in Galena selling merchandise by wholesale and retail. I had very little capital, but by hard work, careful management and strict economy I was reasonably successful. When I began we had in Galena some twenty wholesale houses, the largest part being in the line of groceries and dry goods. By 1856 this number had nearly doubled, and many of the houses which had started six to eight years before had doubled and quadrupled the volume of their business. The difficulties the merchant had to contend with in the early '50s and for years before were, first, the remoteness of the markets where his stock of merchandise was bought. Almost all kinds of merchandise except sugar, rice, molasses and a few other articles were bought in New York, Boston and Philadelphia and shipped to Galena, usually by sailing vessels to New Orleans, from there to St. Louis by steamboat, and from St. Louis by upper Mississippi steamboats to Galena, consuming two or three months in transit. Merchants usually bought their stock of goods twice a year, and it was difficult to tell when buying, what the needs of the customers would be. It was also a slow process to get in a reasonable time such articles as might be needed to fill up a line of goods which had become exhausted. When the financial depression came upon the country, Galena merchants suffered like the others, only in a less degree. As depreciated currency greatly aggravated the sit\n\n48\n\nnation, the merchant was compelled to stand a serious loss from this cause. Galena merchants had a considerable trade in the lead mines, and, as the miners and smelters had long before refused to take currency for mineral or lead, all transactions with them had to be settled with gold. It is safe to assert that while one-half of the merchants in the West and Northwest failed, this was only the case with but three or four out of some forty mercantile houses in Galena. I suffered with the rest, but managed to \"weather the storm.\" Among the merchants at Galena many were men of great shrewdness, who operated upon lines that were broad, but conservative and safe. Such men would have been successful almost anywhere. Lucius S. Felt and his brother, B. F. Felt, Stillman and Rood, Foster and Stahl, J. A. Packard, McMaster and Hempstead, B. H. Campbell, George W. Campbell, H. F. McCloskey, J. Russell Jones and William and James Ryan were some of Galena's leading merchants in the '50s. The last named firm at a later time became large packers in Galena and Dubuque. Our banking facilities were ample. Henry and Nathan Corwith, who began business as private bankers in the early '30s and later organized the National Bank of Galena, were men of large capital, conservative and able as financiers, and had won a national reputation as bankers. James Garter also operated a private bank during the '50s. His moneyed relations with George Smith, banker at Chicago, and Alex Mitchell, banker at Milwaukee, were close. Some time after the war the Corwiths sold out their Galena business and moved to Chicago, where they became well and favorably known in financial circles.\n\nA little after the middle of the '40s a young man, \"George F. Magoun, of Bath, Me., a recent graduate of a college of that state, appeared in Galena for the purpose\n\n49\n\nof opening a high grade school for boys. He was a bright, clean-cut man of attractive address, and who at once made a favorable impression on the people of Galena. He succeeded in his mission, and after having managed his school for two years, returned east and went through a theological course of scudy, came back to the West, and, as a home missionary, took charge of a church in a mining town near Galena. Soon after he accepted a call from the Second Presbyterian church of Galena and became its pastor, I severed my connection with the First Presbyterian church and united with the Second church to aid the new organization. Mr. Magoun proved an unusually learned and eloquent preacher. After a few years' service as pastor he had a serious difficulty with the officers of the church, which induced him to leave the ministry. He went to Burlington, Ia., and entered the law office of the learned lawyer and brilliant orator, Henry W. Starr. He was soon admitted to the bar and began the practice of law. Mr. Starr said of him that he was the best lawyer of his age in the state of Iowa. Magoun soon wearied of his new profession and returned to the ministry. He preached for a few years in Davenport, Ia., when he was elected president of Iowa College at Grinnell, and he filled the posstion in a most satisfactory manner for nearly a quarter of a century. Dr. Magoun was in many respects a rare man. He was endowed with a strong intellect, immense will force, had great and varied learning, and withal was a fluent and forcible speaker. He took an active interest in educational and kindred matters, and his death, which occurred some years ago, was a serious loss to his state and to the Northwest.\n\nNear the close of the '40s Dr. Magoun induced a young theological student, Rev. E. D. Neill, who had just been ordained to the ministry, to come west as a\n\n50\n\nhome missionary. He filled a pulpit for two years at Elizabeth, a mining town near Galena, and then moved to St. Paul, Minn., and organized the first Presbyterian church in that place. Dr. Neill was mentally and morally a strong man and soon impressed himself upon the people of that new town. He resided in St. Paul nearly half of a century, and was an active and potent factor in pushing forward the interests of religion, morals and education. Dr. Neill was appointed United States consul to Dublin in the '80s.\n\nWhen Governor Slade of Vermont started in the middle of the '50s the scheme to prepare young women for school teaching, to be sent to the Territory of Minnesota, Dr. Neill and the Rev. Aratus Kent, of Galena, were the managers of the Western end of the line of operations. A school of instruction was opened and maintained in New Haven, where a large number of young women of from 21 to 35 years of age were trained as school teachers and were then sent St. Paul in groups of a dozen or more, all passing on their route through Galena, from which place they were taken to St. Paul by steamboat. On arriving at their destination they were assigned to the localities in the territory where they were most needed. The project was not carried on long, for an unexpected trouble arose. The young women often after having taught school for a few months or longer, were induced to give up teaching to become the wives of the bachelor settlers. An old and prominent citizen of St. Paul, who had taken much interest in Governor Slade's scheme, told me years afterwards, when speaking of this matter, that if the governor failed in giving Minnesota good teachers, he certainly did not fail in giving it good wives.\n\nJohn N. Jewett, a young lawyer from Maine, located in Galena in the early '50s, and associated himself for\n\n51\n\nthe practice of his profession with Wellington W. Weigley. He had received a collegiate education, had a judicial mind, was a close student, careful and methodical in the preparation of his cases. His ability as a lawyer was at once recognized by the bar. In disposition he was quiet, urbane and self-contained, always giving the impression of reserve power. Alter a few years of practice at the Galena bar, he removed to Chicago, where he opened a law office. He was chosen by the management of the Illinois Central railroad as counsel at Chicago. He served one term in the senate of the State Legislature, making a creditable record as an able, discriminating and conscientious legislator. His opinions and judgment in regard to railroad law have always been treated with consideration by the bench and bar. During President Hayes administration his claims and fitness for a seat as Justice of the United States Supreme Court were seriously entertained, with a view to his appointment. He is favorably known to railroad lawyers throughout the country.\n\nIn the autumn of 1853, on my return from the East, where I had gone to buy goods, I met and became acquainted with a bright, clear-headed young man, who was on his way to Galena to take a clerkship in a wholesale clothing house. This man was Edward A. Small, who afterwards became well known as an able and successful lawyer. Small, after having filled a clerk's position for a year, went into another clothing house as a partner, sold out in two years, and entered Wellington W. Weigley's law office as a student. He was a persistent worker and at the end of two years was admitted to the bar. He practiced his profession in Galena with unusual success until after the civil war, when he moved to Chicago and continued his practice there. His industry, devotion to business, success in the trial of cases, and\n\n52\n\nhis amiability of disposition, brought to him a large and lucrative practice. As a business lawyer and counselor he was prominent, and as a trial lawyer was remarkably successful. He died some half-score of years ago, leaving his family a handsome competency. At the time of his death I had known him intimately for over a quarter of a century. His strength of character, with a rare faculty of attaching men to him, made him a favorite with all classes. Although an ardent Republican, he declined all offers of political preferment.\n\nW. R. Marshall, with his older brother, the younger having hardly reached his majority, came to Galena from Quincy, Ill., located a mining claim a few miles north of Galena, built a miner's cabin and worked their \"diggings\" several years. From the lead mines the young men moved to the Territory of Minnesota in 1849. They opened the first general merchandise store at St. Anthony, and a few years later an iron and hardware store in St. Paul. They were successful in business, and in 1855 W. R. Marshall engaged in banking in St. Paul. He served one term in the Territorial Legislature. Soon after the breaking out of the civil war he entered the volunteer service as colonel of the Seventh Minnesota Infantry, and at the close of the war was made a brtgadier general by brevet. Soon after the war General Marshall was elected governor of the state of Minnesota and served four years. Gen. Marshall was of a modest, retiring disposition, of attractive manner, and always popular with the masses. He was a brave and efficient soldier in the war and his record was a most creditable one.\n\nI met and became acquainted with Governor Alex Ramsey of Minnesota in 1853, on a Mississippi steamer going to St. Paul. He was then governor of the Territory of Minnesota and afterwards governor of the State of Minnesota. He impressed me as being a man of mental\n\n53\n\nforce, sound judgment, great general intelligence and of decided convictions. He served as United States senator one term and was Secretary of War during a part of President Hayes' administration, and after wards filled other high positions of trust under the Federal government. He still lives in Minnesota in retirement and is one of its most esteemed and honored citizens.\n\nIn the latter part of the '40s I became acquainted at Galena with Cyrus Aldrich, then in charge of the business of the stage line of Frink & Walker. He soon after moved to Minneapolis, Minn., and engaged in business. He was succeeded at Galena by L. P. Sanger, of Lockport, Ill. In the latter '50s he was elected a member of congress for the Minneapolis district. He was tall and robust, of much practical intelligence and industry, of sturdy integrity and of unassuming manner. He made a valuable representative, never forgetting the interests of his constituents while attending to national affairs. In the early spring of 1861 I met him often in Washington. On one occasion he came into the room of our mutual friend, E. B. Washburne, the Galena member of congress, where I happened to be, and remarked: \"Well, Washburne, I have done it. I have just had a postmaster appointed at Minneapolis. There were eleven candidates for the place, all good men and all well endorsed. I presume what I have done will make me ten enemies and possibly one ingrate.\"\n\nOne of the earliest and best steamboat captains on the upper Mississippi, who lived in Galena, married there, and for many years was a great favorite with its people was Captain Russell Blakeley. He moved to St. Paul in the early '50s, engaged in the staging business on an extended scale and afterwards became interested in railroad enterprises in the state of Minnesota. He was a clear-headed, upright business man of much force and\n\n54\n\ndecision of character. He met with success in these various enterprises and is now retired and living in St. Paul, one of its wealthiest and most highly esteemed citizens.\n\nEx-Governor L. F. Hubbard, of Red Wing, Minn., I knew during the civil war, when he commanded the Fifth regiment Minnesota Infantry. He enlisted as a private, and in less than two years he had command of the regiment. He was young, active, brave and well versed in all matters relating to his duties as regimental commander, and his unfailing devotion to them made him a favorite with all his superior officers. At the close of the war he was brevetted a brigadier general for conspicuous gallantry. Soon after the war he was elect-governor of the state of Minnesota and served four years. He filled many other positions of honor and trust in his state. I was gratified to learn that his fine soldierly qualities had been recognized by President McKinley who appointed him a brigadier general in the late Spanish-American war.\n\nColonel Hubbard in 1862 had a chaplain in his regiment in the person of Father Ireland, a young priest from St. Paul. I noticed his activity and ceaseless devotion to the sick and wounded of his regiment, always shown in a quiet and unostentatious manner. Some years after the war I met my young army friend again at Minnetonka, Minn., at a reunion of the Army of the Tennessee, and renewed a pleasant acquaintance begun in the war. He was then bishop and is now an archbishop of the Catholic church. I have become well acquainted with this distinguished prelate and regard him as one of the most remarkable men I ever knew. Archbishop Ireland has great learning, excellent judgment, rare administrative ability, energy, will force, piety, and withal, modesty and rare simplicity of character. His\n\n55\n\nzeal in his calling is unsurpassed, and his broad, practical and advanced views touching united Christian effort, without regard to sect or denomination, to bless and to elevate mankind to a higher moral plane, are pronounced. He is a strong and convincing public speaker.\n\nAmong the Minnesotians who had been residents of Galena, and whom I knew well, was the late Judge J. M. Shaw, one of the \"Galena boys\" in the early '50s, and who studied law in the office of General John A. Rawlins. He moved to Minneapolis before the civil war to practice law, entered the volunteer service as a private and rose to the rank of captain. His army record was a most creditable one. He resumed the practice of his profession in Minneapolis, became prominent at the bar, and in the '80s was elected judge of the circuit court of that district, where he made a fine reputation for learning, ability and impartiality. He served several years on the bench, when failing health compelled him to resign. His death occurred less than two years ago. He was always an assiduous student, and his tastes were literary.\n\nAbout the middle of the '50s became acquainted with a young man who was a second or \"mud clerk\" on one of our upper river steamboats, whose business it was to receive and discharge all freight. His energy, correct and rapid manner of transacting business and good nature, made him a favorite. His name was James J. Hill. Soon after he located in St. Paul and went into business for himself. In time he became interested in a steamboat line running on Red river, and then into some railroad scheme. A little more than a decade ago he undertook the gigantic enterprise of building the Great Northern railroad, which, with consummate tact, energy and ability, he succeeded in completing. Mr. Hill, known as the \"Railroad King,\" was elected the president of its board of directors.\n\n56\n\nAbout 1852 I became well acquainted at Galena with W. C. Burbank, who had started a collecting and express business between Galena and the upper river towns, giving his personal attention to the business. He not long afterwards located in St. Paul, and became the partner of Captain Russell Blakeley in his stage and railroad enterprises. He was a careful, industrious, shrewd and resourceful man of affairs, and met with great success, and died a few years ago leaving a very large estate.\n\nDr. Charles H. Ray came to Galena from Springfield, Ill., in 1854, and assumed the position of editor and manager of the weekly \"Jeffersonian,\" the organ of the Democratic party of the lead mines. The office of the \"Jeffersonian\" was next door to my place of business, and I not only saw a good deal of the doctor, but grew to be very fond of him. He seemed to lack \"push\" in the management of the paper. I knew his ability as a writer, and he, in his work on that little country paper, was like a \"giant playing with straws.\" The doctor made his paper a very readable one, but its circulation was not large, and the majority of his readers were not of the appreciative kind. After two or three years spent in Galena he removed to Chicago and became associated with Mr. Medill in editing the Chicago Tribune. It soon became apparent that the doctor was a writer of great ability, and his reputation became national. He had much of the milk of human kindness in his nature, natural ability, rare practical intelligence, and when thoroughly aroused, wrote with vigor and force. Socially he was always entertaining, and had in him what the French call \"bonhomie.\" After he left Galena I seldom saw him, until the winter of 1860-61, when he was in Washington writing for the Tribune.\n\nThere lies in the cemetery in the village of Hazel\n\n57\n\nGreen, less than ten miles from Galena and just over the border of Wisconsin, the body of a very remarkable man, James G. Percival, the poet and geologist. This grave was unmarked until within a few years, when some friends and admirers erected over it a modest marble monument. Dr. Percival came to the lead mines from Connecticut in the early 50's to do some geological work for the American mining company, and in 1853 was appointed geologist for the state of Wisconsin. He was seen often on the streets of Galena and was known to some of its citizens. He lived while at Hazel Green in the family of Dr. Jenckes, a practicing physician of the place. Dr. Percival was a man of great learning. He read ten languages, was a physician, philologist, geologist, botanist, musician and poet. His habits were erratic, and by nature he was retiring and inclined to melancholy. He was highly gifted as a poet and began to write verse at the age of 15. At the age of 20, while in college, he wrote the tragedy of \"Zamor.\" I knew the doctor somewhat while he lived in Hazel Green. Very few people knew him well. His dress and manner were so peculiar that he was usually taken, when seen on the streets, for an ordinary miner who had had a \"streak of bad luck.\" All the money he made he put into books. He died poor, except that his library after his death was sold for the handsome sum of $20,000.\n\nOn a farm a few miles northwest of Hazel Green, lived a family named Evans. In the early '50s a well-grown boy named Henry Clay Evans often passed over the \"plank road\" going to Galena driving a team of horses drawing a wagon loaded with products of the farm. When the war broke out, Henry Clay Evans enlisted in a Wisconsin regiment of volunteers. By the end of the war he had risen to the rank of captain by sheer merit. He had been brave, faithful and efficient. After the war\n\n58\n\nCaptain Evans located at Chattanooga, Tenn., and went into business. He was fairly well educated, ambitious, energetic, tactful, persistent and a good public speaker. He soon became a prominent and influential politician. He was nominated for governor, made a splendid canvass and was elected, but the legislature \"counted him out.\" I met him in Chattanooga three years later, when he seemed not at all \"cast down\" by the unfair treatment he had received. President McKinley appointed him United States commissioner of pensions, which position he is filling with marked ability. Captain Evans has in him the elements of success in a high degree.\n\nA large wholesale boot and shoe house was opened in Galena in 1845 by James and Benjamin F. Adams, two young men from Boston. I became intimately acquainted with them. They had received training as merchants and were not lacking in moral stamina. Some five years later they sold out their business and moved to Chicago, where they engaged in the manufacture of flour. They had energy and keen business discrimination, and soon were some of the leading manufacturers and operators in flour in the West. James died about the middle of the '50s. Benjamin F. lived in Chicago until 1880, when he died, leaving a large estate.\n\nJames Rood, of the firm of Stillman & Rood, wholesale grocery merchants of Galena in the '40s and '50s, moved to Chicago soon after the war and engaged largely in the iron business as the agent for several iron mines in Wisconsin. Mr. Rood gained the reputation at an early time of having keen business perception, quiet energy and good judgment. He has always been careful and conservative in his business methods and successful. He has retired from active business and is living at Evanston, Ill.\n\nWilliam J. Quan, when a young man, began business\n\n59\n\nin Galena as a grocery and provision merchant. His close application to business, energy and industry made him successful, and soon after the civil war he located in Chicago and opened a wholesale grocery house. He soon became one of the leading merchants of Chicago in that line of trade. In the management of his great business, Mr. Quan has always followed conservative, practical and safe lines.\n\nAbout that time Edward Hempstead, of the firm of McMaster & Hempstead, wholesale grocers in Galena, moved to Chicago and with Thomas H. Beebe, another Galena merchant, engaged in the lumber business and soon became prominent in lumber circles. They were clear-headed and energetic business men. Mr. Hempstead died some years ago. Mr. Beebe is living in retirement at Evanston, Ill.\n\nIn 1857, through the influence of political friends in Northern Illinois, Governor W. H. Bissell, who had been elected the year before, appointed me one of three aides on his staff with the rank of colonel of cavalry. The governor was one of the most noted and popular men in the state, and was elected the year before by the Freesoil-Republican vote. He had served in the Mexican war as captain of the Second regiment of Illinois volunteers, and, I think, with a higher rank later, and particularly distinguished himself at Buena Vista. He represented the Belleville district in congress two terms before the Mexican war, was a forcible and ready debater and a prominent and useful member. His health failed in the early '50s, he became partially paralyzed, and while he was governor was compelled to use crutches. While he was in congress opposing the passage of the Missouri compromise measure he became involved in a controversy with the Southern Democrats and hot words passed between him and Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi,\n\n60\n\non the subject of the bravery of the Northern, as compared with that of the Southern soldiers, which led to a challenge from Mr. Davis. In accepting the challenge, Colonel Bissell chose as the weapons, muskets at thirty, paces, loaded with a ball and three buckshot. Mr. Davis' friends interfered and the duel was not fought. The governor died before the end of his term, and Lieutenant Governor Wood served until the inauguration of Governor Yates.\n\nIn the summer of 1856 a distinguished statesman, in the person of Senator Charles Sumner, visited Galena. He was making a tour of the West for the first time, and had a letter to me. His tour was not one for pleasure alone, but also to learn from personal observations more about the great West. He had come from the East by way of the Ohio river, and intended to go up the Mississippi river to Minnesota and then back east by the lakes. The senator expressed a desire to see one of our best lodes. I took him to the Marsden \"diggings,\" some three miles south of the city, then producing large quantities of lead ore. When we had reached there he expressed a desire to go down the main haft. The manager supplied him with a loose miner's suit of clothes, and thus equipped he went down the shaft to the principal horizontal drift, at a depth of seventy feet. With a candle and pick he explored the mine. When he returned he had some fine specimens of ore, which he had dug out himself and with which he was greatly pleased. The next day he said he would like to visit one of our smelting furnaces, and I accompanied him to Hughlett's furnace, two miles north of the city, which he inspected with great interest. He asked many questions in regard to the process of smelting lead ore. In speaking of farming lands afterwards, he said he was surprised to find the soil in the mining district so fertile and so generally cultivated.\n\n61\n\nI enjoyed the senator's visit. He was genial and communicative, and entertained me with his impressions of that portion of the West he had s"
