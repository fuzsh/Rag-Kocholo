        "text": "Metropolitan Police Authority: November meeting\n\n57/08\n\n27 November 2008\n\nA meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority will be held in the Chamber, City Hall, The Queenâs Walk, London SE1 2AA on Thursday 27 November 2008 at 10.00 a.m.\n\nThe Authority will discuss the terms of reference for the MPA Race and Faith Inquiry and confirm the appointment of the Inquiry panel.\n\nChair of the MPA and Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said,\n\nâAs one of the capitalâs largest and most important employers, the Metropolitan Police Service has a duty to reflect and understand the communities it serves.\n\nâIt is clear that over the last ten years great progress has been made in dealing with race and faith related issues. However, we cannot afford to be complacent. Londoners must have confidence that progress will continue, and I look forward to a positive and constructive outcome from this inquiry.â\n\nCindy Butts, who will chair the Inquiry panel said:\n\nâThe Inquiry, which will run from January until May 2009, will focus on race and faith issues in the Met.\n\nâOur aim is to find out how we can bring about real cultural change in the Met, encourage open dialogue about diversity and ensure all employees feel secure and confident in their working environment.\n\nâWe cannot ignore the potential for internal difficulties to impact on community police relations in London. It is crucial the Met has the confidence of Londonâs diverse communities in order to tackle successfully the major policing issues in London today â combating terrorism and gun and knife crime.\n\nâThe Inquiry panel will be researching and gathering information from a broad range of individuals and organisations from within the Met, including staff focus groups, and we will be identifying areas of best practise within the public and private sectors. We intend to report back to the MPA in May 2009, with recommendations for next steps.â\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson will present a report on policing performance and respond to questions from Authority members.\n\nThe Authority will debate two motions proposed by MPA members Joanne McCartney (LA Labour) and Jenny Jones (LA Green party).\n\nOther items on the Agenda include:\n\nâ¢ Policing London Business Plan\n\nâ¢ Selection process for Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis\n\nNotes to Editors\n\n1. The MPA understands, at this stage, that the Commissioner will attend the Full Authority for a short period of time at the beginning of the meeting.\n\n2. Race and Faith Inquiry Panel members to be confirmed.\n\n3. Committee paper and Terms of Reference for Race and Faith Inquiry can be found at: www.mpa.gov.uk/committees/mpa/2008/081127/07.htm\n\n4. The Chief Executive received the following two motions:\n\nâThis Authority resolves to review Section 6.1 of the Authorityâs Standing Orders (Urgency powers) and its appropriateness. This review will assess whether current urgency powers sufficiently defend the Authorityâs democratic processes. It will be conducted by the Corporate Governance committee, and report to the full Authority, with a view to amending standing orders, if necessaryâ\n\nProposer: Joanne McCartney\n\nSeconder: Jenny Jones\n\nAnd\n\nâThis Authority resolves to examine any decision taken on behalf of the Authority, following Sir Ian Blairâs resignation, with regard to the outgoing commissionerâs salary, pension or benefits.\n\n\"This Authority will be provided with all background information in support of any such decision, in order that it may have a detailed debate of the matter and examine the decisionâ.\n\nProposer: Jenny Jones\n\nSeconder: Joanne McCartney"
