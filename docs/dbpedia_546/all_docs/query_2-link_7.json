        "text": "The 55-year-old Lancastrian has finally won the prize of Britain's top policing role.\n\nSpeaking outside the Met's headquarters at Scotland Yard, Sir Paul said he was a \"hugely proud policeman\" and was looking forward to the challenge of the job.\n\nSir Paul said: \"I am just such a hugely proud policeman today, to be asked to lead the Met in bringing safety to millions of Londoners, millions of visitors and lead the Met's national efforts.\n\n\"I am just enormously proud and I understand the challenge that awaits me.\"\n\nThe acting commissioner was unveiled as Britain's most senior police officer by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and London mayor Boris Johnson.\n\nTheir decision was approved by the Prime Minister before the Queen, who is at Sandringham, confirmed the appointment.\n\nThe Scotland Yard appointment will be formally confirmed in a written parliamentary statement.\n\nThe announcement marks the end of a race to head Scotland Yard that began with the resignation of Sir Ian Blair last October.\n\nFormer London mayor Ken Livingstone welcomed Sir Paul's appointment.\n\n\"A lot of us had worries that Boris might try and get someone in who would be out of touch with what London's policing needs,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.\n\nThe news will come as a bitter disappointment to his rival Sir Hugh Orde, the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\n\nA cross-party interview panel agreed on Sir Paul to serve London and Britain for the next five years in the Â£254,000 post.\n\nHis experiences as deputy commissioner under Sir Ian Blair since 2005 gave him a powerful insight into the challenges of the top job.\n\nControversies included the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, a string of public gaffes and an angry row with senior ethnic minority officers.\n\nHe must continue the fight against terrorism, lead police strategy nationwide and secure the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nIn London, the new commissioner faces spiralling youth violence, a potential recession-fuelled crime wave and low morale as budget tightening looms large.\n\nTwo other contenders, West Midlands boss Sir Paul Scott-Lee and Merseyside chief Bernard Hogan-Howe, were earlier eliminated from the contest.\n\nThe Home Office and the Metropolitan Police Authority, which were responsible for appointing the commissioner, declined to comment.\n\nShadow home secretary Chris Grayling said: \"We congratulate Sir Paul on his appointment and wish him well as the new Commissioner.\n\n\"His big challenge will be to restore the reputation and independence of the Metropolitan Police.\"\n\nBrian Paddick, an ex-assistant commissioner and Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate, said the necessary reform of the police service would \"take a backseat\" under Sir Paul.\n\n\"It may have been better to have a new broom,\" he told the Today programme.\n\n\"He is more of a right-wing Commissioner than Sir Ian Blair - some people would say it would be difficult for any Commissioner to be more left-wing than Ian Blair.\n\n\"There will be a lot of rank and file officers who will say 'Well, anything is better than Sir Ian Blair'. I don't necessarily agree with that but I think he is more likely to work with the predominant macho male culture than Sir Ian Blair was and therefore he will be more popular with the ground floor but not necessarily for the right reasons.\""
