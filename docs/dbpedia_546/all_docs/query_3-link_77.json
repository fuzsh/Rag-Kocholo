        "text": "A second top police official in London has resigned in the wake of the hacking controversy at the shuttered News of the World — while Britain’s Parliament prepared to open another round of its ongoing probe today.\n\nMetropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner John Yates, who was Britain’s head anti-terrorism officer, quit yesterday just two days after his boss, Sir Paul Stephenson, resigned as commissioner of the police agency.\n\nBoth had been linked to the phone-hacking controversy in which reporters and others tapped mobile phones of celebrities, politicians, crime victims and other individuals to develop stories.\n\nMeanwhile, a committee of Parliament said it would question three key witnesses in the controversy as scheduled: Rupert Murdoch, chairman-CEO of News Corp.; his son, James, deputy chief operating officer; and Rebekah Brooks, the former CEO of News International.\n\nSeparately, News Corp. stepped up its internal probe of possible wrongdoing by employees. The company appointed Anthony Grabiner, a UK lawyer and chairman of retailer Arcadia Group Plc to lead the internal investigation.\n\nNews Corp. Executive Vice President Joel Klein said the appointment of Grabiner “clearly demonstrates that we are serious about putting things right that have gone wrong in the past.”\n\nNews Corp. shares fell 4.3 percent yesterday to $15.40 after Standard & Poor’s placed the company’s BBB+ corporate debt rating on negative watch for potential impacts from the hacking scandal.\n\nNews Corp. is also the parent company of The Post."
