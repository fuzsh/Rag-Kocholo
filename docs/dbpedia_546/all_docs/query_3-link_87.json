        "text": "Sir Paul Stephenson, head of the Metropolitan Police, revealed that the nature of protests had changed and he expected more disorder.\n\nThe Commissioner admitted that his officers had failed to predict the change in mood among student demonstrators before the Millbank riot two weeks ago.\n\nHe said the violence, which saw protesters running amok at Conservative Party headquarters, illustrated his fear that “the game has changed”.\n\nFOLLOW THE EXPRESS ON TWITTER!\n\nHe warned that police would make a more robust response to future protests, as they had on Wednesday when riot officers used controversial “kettling” tactics to hem in angry crowds.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority, Sir Paul said: “We have been going through a period where we have not seen that sort of violent disorder.\n\n“We had dealt with student organisers before and we based it too much on history. Regrettably, the game has changed and we must act.”\n\nAs Sir Paul issued his stark assessment, student groups involved in the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts said they hoped more demonstrators would take to the streets next Tuesday.\n\nThere are also plans for a national day of action when the tuition fees bill is debated in Parliament, probably next month.\n\nWednesday’s demonstration, which included many school pupils, was contained in Whitehall, near the entrance to Downing Street, where about 5,000 demonstrators were corralled for several hours.\n\nSir Paul said that when several marches linked up in Whitehall, the police’s aim had been to stop them getting into Parliament Square.\n\nAs a result the damage caused was far more limited than in the previous protest.\n\nSir Paul said: “We put a lot more assets out but we got it right.”\n\nSpeaking about the decision to pen in protesters, Sir Paul said there were fears some would try to occupy the Liberal Democrat headquarters in Westminster.\n\nHe added: “There was no doubt if protesters were given free reign they would have tried to enter premises by force.”\n\nSir Paul said police wanted to release the penned-in demonstrators earlier, but were not able to because of renewed clashes outside the area. But student spokesman Simon Hardy told a press conference: “The police actions were absolutely outrageous.\n\n“Children as young as 13, 14, or 15 were not allowed to leave and were intimidated by hundreds of riot police and treated very badly when all they were doing was exercising their democratic right to protest.”"
