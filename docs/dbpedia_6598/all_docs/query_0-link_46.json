As a principal of Bender Commercial, he stands as a prominent figure known for his expertise in land and industrial markets.\n\nRob’s roots extend from the Minneapolis, Minnesota area. He attended Southwest Minnesota State University (SMSU) in Marshall, Minnesota, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in marketing and a minor in sociology. During his time at SMSU, he demonstrated his marketing acumen as a project manager at the Southwest Marketing Advisory Center (SMAC)—a student-centered marketing organization that develops research-driven strategies and marketing solutions to help regional businesses and organizations expand their customer base and improve their services.\n\nFollowing his student-athlete pursuits, Rob’s talents took him to the professional indoor football league. He signed with the Sioux Falls Storm, a multiyear national championship winner, where he excelled as a quarterback during the 2004 and 2005 seasons.\n\nJoining the Bender Commercial team in 2005, his steadfast commitment led him to earn the coveted SIOR designation (Society of Industrial and Office Realtors). This exclusive achievement places him among the top 1.5% of commercial brokers in the United States—a testament to his depth of experience, knowledge, and capabilities.\n\nRob’s leadership journey gained further momentum as he assumed the role of principal at Bender Commercial in 2013. His strategic vision and dynamic leadership style propelled him to an executive vice president and managing director role in 2021."
