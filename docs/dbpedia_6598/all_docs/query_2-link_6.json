        "text": "Mike Krzyzewski has put up some impressive numbers in his coaching career at Army and Duke. His latest isn't about wins, Final Fours or national championships.\n\nThe list of former assistant coaches who have gone on to take over Division I programs includes Mike Brey at Notre Dame, Tommy Amaker at Seton Hall, Bob Bender at Washington, Mike Dement at Southern Methodist, Quin Snyder at Missouri and David Henderson at Delaware.\n\nHenderson played for Krzyzewski at Duke from 1983-86 and was co-captain of his first Final Four team in 1986.\n\nHenderson talks proudly of being the latest leaf on Coach K's family tree.\n\n\"My learning process started with him when I was 18 years old and even when I graduated from Duke he was still a constant in my life,\" Henderson said of Krzyzewski. \"When I was done playing basketball I still had a passion for the game and I got into coaching and I was fortunate to go back and work for the man I committed to when I was 18 years old.\n\n\"He is one of the greatest minds in basketball and for me to go back and learn this time on the coaching side, it was incredible. So think about it, I'm 36 years old and half my life has been in basketball with him. I've learned a lot.\"\n\nHenderson, whose rookie season as a head coach is off to a 5-6 start as he replaces Brey, said it's not just Krzyzewski who helps the new guys in the job.\n\n\"I'm the most recent one to come into this situation so I'll call those guys and get some information,\" Henderson said. \"I'll ask, 'Hey, what did you do?' or 'How would you approach this?' and I'll get some feedback from all the guys and you piece it all together and come up with your own way of dealing with it.\n\n\"We've been a family for a long time and that's the thing about Coach K's lineage, he's created a family environment and when he says it he means it. When you leave the university, you come back, all the players come back.\"\n\nHenderson was replaced on the Duke staff by former Blue Devils guard Chris Collins. Krzyzewski's entire staff is former players with Johnny Dawkins and Steve Wojciechowski the other assistants and Henderson stays in touch with them as well.\n\n\"Johnny's my best friend since we've been in school. His second child is my God child and we talk all the time,\" Henderson said. \"Steve's the same way. Hey, we come from a great family.\"\n\nCOACHING AWARDS: The Mountain West Conference had co-coaches of the year in its inaugural season of 1999-00. Neither is still there and in fact, neither is coaching.\n\nReggie Minton of Air Force was one of the co-winners after leading the Falcons to an 8-20 overall record and 4-10 in the league. He was fired after the season and was replaced by former Princeton assistant Joe Scott.\n\nUNLV's Bill Bayno was the other half of the duo for leading the Runnin' Rebels to a 23-8 record, including tying for first place in the league at 10-4, and an NCAA tournament berth. He was fired last week after the NCAA announced sanctions against the program even though Bayno was cleared of wrongdoing in the violations stemming from the recruitment of Lamar Odom in 1996 and 1997.\n\nZEROS IN THE RECORD: Through Thursday's games there were 12 undefeated teams left in the country and only two of them -- Boston College and Baylor -- are not ranked in the Top 25.\n\nOn the other side of the won-loss ledger are the seven teams that had yet to win and it's tough to decide which of two facts is the bigger surprise.\n\nFirst, Penn, along with Princeton the team that dominates the Ivy League year after year, is 0-7, matching the worst start in school history. In 1984-85, the Quakers also started 0-7 and went on to win the conference and play in the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe other interesting winless fact is that more than half the teams with a \"0\" on the left are from the same conference. Arkansas-Pine Bluff, Grambling State, Texas Southern and Jackson State are all winless and all play in the Southwestern Athletic Conference.\n\nThe other two teams yet to win are Western Illinois and Sacred Heart.\n\n20-20-20 VISION: Notre Dame didn't have three players score 20 or more points in a game for almost a decade. The Fighting Irish have now done it in consecutive games.\n\nOn Tuesday, Notre Dame beat Canisius 99-71. Troy Murphy had 29 points, David Graves 23 and Ryan Humphrey 20.\n\nTwo nights later, the Fighting Irish beat Vermont 96-86 and those same three players did it again with Murphy and Graves each getting 21, and Humphrey again scoring 20.\n\nBefore this week the last time three Notre Dame players scored 20 or more was on Feb. 15, 1992, a 101-98 victory over Syracuse when LaPhonso Ellis had 28, Daimon Sweet 24 and Elmer Bennett 22."
