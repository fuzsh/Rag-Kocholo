        "text": "Sixth-year Washington Coach Bob Bender has a 3-7 record against Cal.\n\nLast Meeting: California 84, Washington 67 (Feb. 21, 1998 - Oakland, Calif.)\n\nGeno Carlisle and Thomas Kilgore combined for 41 points and limited Washingtonis guards defensively as California registered an 84-67 win at the New Arena in Oakland. Washington lost its fifth consecutive road game and fell to Cal for the ninth time in the last 11 meetings. The Huskies rallied from a 10-point first-half deficit, taking a 35-34 halftime advantage on the strength of a 20-7 surge. The UW had won all 11 previous games in 1998 when leading at halftime. Todd MacCulloch led UW with 21 points and 10 rebounds. He gave the UW its final lead at 54-53 on a layup with 9:40 left in the game. Cal responded with a 16-2 run over the next five minutes to take control. Carlisle scored 14 of his 23 points in the second half. Kilgore finished with 18 points and Sean Marks added 15. Donald Watts, recently named Pac-10 Player of the Week, was limited to six points after scoring 28 in the first meeting with Cal. Watts missed all nine field goal tries. The Huskies shot only 2-of-15 from 3-point range and converted only 39 percent of its field goals (22-56).\n\nDickau - OW!: Sophomore point guard Dan Dickau had surgery Friday (Jan. 15) to repair a fracture on his left heel (calcaneus bone) that was discovered by x-rays on Jan. 13. He is likely out for the season. Dickau broke the navicular bone on top of his left foot during the summer that sidelined him from July to October. A bone spur that developed in that location was removed during the Jan. 15 surgery. Dickau started 11 games this year, averaging 4.6 points and a then team-high 34 assists. A seven-point performance in a last-second, 88-86 loss at No. 8 Arizona on Jan. 9 appears to be Dickau's final appearance of the 1999 season. He averaged 3.6 points per game last year and was an honorable mention All-Pac-10 freshman selection. Dickau was the 1997 Washington Class AAA prep Player of the Year out of Prairie High School in Vancouver. \"I feel bad for Dan because no one has woked harder to help this team have success,\" said Coach Bob Bender.\n\nLast Game: Washington 70, Oregon State 50 (Jan. 14, 1999; Seattle)\n\nTodd MacCulloch scored 12 of his 20 points early in the second half, helping Washington pull away for a 70-50 victory over Oregon State at Edmundson Pavilion. Washington (8-6, 1-3) extended its winning streak to six games over the Beavers (8-6, 2-3), its longest against OSU since 1953. The Huskies rode a balanced scoring attack to a 32-25 halftime advantage. MacCullochis 12 second-half points, capped by a layin with 6:54 remaining, helped push the lead to 59-40. MacCulloch hit 9-of-12 shots and completed a double-double with 13 rebounds. Michael Johnson added 12 points for the Huskies who also got 10 from Deon Luton. Deaundra Tanner paced the Beavers with 14 points. Washington shot 51 percent (26-51) against an Oregon State team ranked third nationally by holding opponents to 35.1-percent field goal shooting.\n\nSonics & Sons: Four former Seattle SuperSonics have sons on the 1999 Washington basketball roster. The list of former NBA players (and sons) includes, Fred Brown (Bryan), Lonnie Shelton (Marlon), Slick Watts (Donald) and Paul Westphal (Michael). A graduate of Iowa, Fred Brown is the Sonicsi all-time leading scorer with 14,018 points. Brown played his entire 13-year NBA career in Seattle and was a 1976 all-star. Lonnie Shelton was a 1975 All-Pac-8 Conference selection at Oregon State. He played 15 NBA seasons and was a 1982 all-star. Shelton played from 1979-83 in Seattle. Brown and Shelton were members of Seattle's 1979 NBA Championship squad. Slick Watts led the NBA in assists (8.1) and steals (3.2) in 1976, the first player in history to top both categories during the same season. The six-year NBA veteran played in Seattle from 1974-78. Paul Westphal was a two-time (1970 & '71) All-Pac-8 pick at USC. The five-time NBA all-star played during the 1980-81 season in Seattle and returned this summer as head coach of the Sonics.\n\nInstant Replay: The Huskies defeated Oregon State 70-50 in its Pac-10 home opener (Jan. 14), halting a three-game losing streak. They lost 88-86 on a last-second shot at No. 8 Arizona (Jan. 9), 96-72 at Arizona State (Jan. 7) and 72-71 at Washington State (Jan. 3). Washington capped its fourth consecutive seven-win non-conference season Dec. 30 with an 81-72 win over Portland. The Huskies celebrated Christmas eve with a 70-61 win over 11th-ranked New Mexico, dealing the Lobos their fist loss of the season. Washington halted a three-game losing streak on Dec. 19 with a 73-53 victory over New Mexico State. That was the first UW home game since the season-opening 70-63 win over UNC Wilmington on Nov. 16. The Huskies lost 82-71 at Gonzaga (Dec. 8) after suffering a 69-61 setback at Boise State (Dec. 5) that gave BSU a school-record 17-game home winning streak. UW lost 69-48 to top-ranked Connecticut (Dec. 1) at the Great Eight Classic in Chicago. That loss halted a four-game season-opening winning streak that culminated with a 76-60 triumph over Georgia Tech in the championship of the Big Island Invitational in Hilo, Hawaii. Washington posted a 20-10 record last season, earning its first NCAA Tournament berth since 1986. The Huskies advanced to the Sweet 16 with victories over Xavier (69-68) and Richmond (81-66).\n\nShootin' Luton: Junior Deon Luton holds every Washington school 3-point shooting record. He hit three 3-pointers at Washington State (Jan. 3) to break the Husky career record of 119 treys established by Eldridge Recasner (1987-90). Luton owns Washington records for a career (125), single-season (75 in 1998) and single-game (7). He hit seven treys at USC on Jan. 29, 1998. The Huskies have a 6-2 record this season and are 27-9 during his career when Luton hits more than one 3-point basket. Luton was voted the Pacific-10 Conference Player of the Week on Nov. 30. He was the MVP of the Big Island Invitational after scoring 41 points on 55-percent shooting (16-29), including 46-percent 3-point accuracy (6-13). Luton was a 1998 honorable mention All-Pac-10 selection. Last year he accounted for over half (75-of-147) of Washington's 3-pointers. Luton converted 5-of-7 treys in the NCAA second-round win over Richmond. He had three 3-pointers and hit a 17-foot jumper with 11 seconds remaining that proved to be the game-winning basket in the first-round against Xavier. Luton has 24 treys this season, more than double that of any other Husky (Dan Dickau is second with 11).\n\nMistaken Identity: Todd MacCulloch worked as a volunteer at the Final Four in Seattle in April of 1995 and had autograph requests from spectators who mistook him for former 7-foot Oklahoma State center Bryant \"Big Country\" Reeves. \"I'd take it as a compliment if my game is ever compared to his,\" MacCulloch remarked during the 1995 Final Four.\n\nProvincial Playboy: A native of Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada, Todd MacCulloch probably never dreamed his travels in the United States would take him to Playboy magazine headquarters in Chicago. He was twice selected to the Playboy All-America team. MacCulloch and nine other players on the 1999 All-America squad along with Utah Coach Rick Majerus are featured in the January 1999 issue of Playboy. The other members of the 1999 All-America team are: Elton Brand (Duke), Mateen Cleeves (Michigan State), Khalid El-Amin (Connecticut), Evan Eschmeyer (Northwestern), A.J. Guyton (Indiana), Richard Hamilton (Connecticut), B.J. McKie (South Carolina), Andre Miller (Utah) and Wally Szczerbiak (Miami, Ohio). MacCulloch was selected as a 1998 Playboy All-American and joined nine other players and Coach Lute Olson in Chicago during a photo shoot for the December 1997 issue. The other 1998 Playboy All-Americans were: Mike Bibby (Arizona), Zendon Hamilton (St. Johnis), Drew Hansen (Utah, scholar/athlete), Raef LaFrentz (Kansas), B.J. McKie (South Carolina), Paul Pierce (Kansas), Miles Simon (Arizona), Kenny Thomas (New Mexico) and Robert Traylor (Michigan). \"It's kind of scary. You don't buy that magazine to look at someone like me,\" MacCulloch exclaimed of his apperance in Playboy. Featured on the December 1997 cover was another Canuck, the 1995 Miss Canada.\n\nCentury Club: Todd MacCulloch became the 10th player in Husky history to reach the 1,400-point plateau with a 22-point outing at Arizona State on Jan. 7. His 20-point outing against Oregon State vaulted him ahead of the 1,425-point total of Bill Hanson (1960-62) and into the No. 9 spot among Washington career scorers with 1,442 points. Eighth among all-time Husky scorers is current Seattle Sonic standout Detlef Schrempf (1982-85) with 1,449 points.\n\nAll-Time Washington Career Scoring Leaders\n\nNo. Player (Years) Pts No. Player (Years) Pts 1.

He needs 21 more boards to become the eighth player in Husky history to reach the 800-rebound plateau. MacCulloch currently ranks ninth among all-time Washington rebounders after overtaking Ed Corell (1961-62) and his 768 career caroms with a 13-board outing against Oregon State.\n\nAll-Time Washington Career Rebounding Leaders\n\nNo. Player (Years) Rebs No. Player (Years) Pts 1.

Ed Corell (61-63) 768\n\nWatts Shortage: Senior guard Donald Watts started the last four games after missing nearly a month with a sprained right ankle suffered in the first half at Boise State on Dec. 5. He missed four games. Prior to the injury Watts made 41 consecutive starts and missed only one outing in his four-year career, playing 91 of 92 possible games. He is the Huskiesi third-leading scorer (10.2 ppg), but leads the team in scoring since his return with a 13.8-point scoring average in Pac-10 games. Watts contributed 14 points, six rebounds and five assists at Washington State (Jan. 3) in his return from the near month-long absence. In the second game of his return, Watts had 15 points at Arizona State (Jan. 7). He tallied 18 points and 10 assists at Arizona (Jan. 9) and had eight points and eight assists against Oregon State (Jan. 14). Watts usually defends the opponentis top offensive threat. Boise Stateis Roberto Bergersen tallied 28 of his 32 points after Watts left the game with 5:41 left in the first half.\n\nDynamic Starting Debut: Two years had passed since sophomore Greg Clark started his last game, as a senior at San Diego's Grossmont High School. He was sidelined with a dislocated left shoulder his freshman season at Long Beach State before sitting out last year at Washington as a red shirt. Clark made his collegiate starting debut on Dec. 24 against No. 11 New Mexico and helped the Huskies to a 70-61 win. The 6-6 swingman displayed the offensive prowess he was known for as a prep All-American, amassing nine points, seven rebounds and four assists. It was on the defensive end that Clark was most spectacular, making three steals while shutting down leading Lobo scorer Lamont Long. One of the nationis leading scorers, Long entered the game averaging 24.1 ponts and did not score while being limited to three shots in 40 minutes. \"We have enough scorers. I want to take the role as the leading defensive player,\" Clark remarked after the New Mexico game. Clark started the last six games, averaging 5.8 points and 4.5 rebounds.\n\nFrequent Flyers: The Huskies amassed over 8,000 miles during their first road trip this season. Washington flew to Hawaii via Los Angeles on Monday, Nov. 23. Following the three-game Big Island Invitational, the Huskies endured a 4,299-mile trip to Chicago via Los Angeles. Washington departed Hilo on Sunday evening at 12:10 a.m. Central Time and arrived in the Windy City on Monday, Nov. 30 at 12:52 p.m. Central Time. The Huskies returned to Seattle on Wednesday, Dec. 2 to complete the 10-day journey. On Friday, Dec. 4 they set out on a much shorter trip, a 399-mile flight to Boise, Idaho on Dec. 5 before their visit to Spokane to play Gonzaga. The Huskies returned to Seattle on Wednesday, Dec. 9 and remain home until Jan. 2. The game on Dec. 19 was UWis first at home in 32 days, dating to the home opener on Nov. 16.\n\nStrenuous Schedule: Washington's 1999 schedule features 14 games against 1998 postseason competitors. Included are games against competitors from the 1998 Final Four (Stanford), Elite Eight (Arizona, UConn) and Sweet 16 (UCLA) along with NCAA teams New Mexico and Saint Louis. Six 1999 Husky opponents are currently ranked in the AP poll.\n\nPac-10 Pride: In each of the last two seasons the Pacific-10 Conference advanced four teams to the Sweet 16, more than any other league. Arizona, Stanford and UCLA, which reached the last two rounds of 16, were joined last spring by Washington and by California in 1997. Two of the last four national champions came from the Pac-10 (UCLA in 1995, Arizona in 1997).\n\nHusky Tickets: Good seats are available for all Washington home games on a season and invidual game basis. Reserved seats for menis basketball games are $14. General admission tickets, which go on sale the Monday preceding each game, are $6 with high school, senior citizen and child tickets available for $3. The first 500 UW students are allowed in free. Also offered is a family plan ticket (1 adult, 4 children or 2 adults, 3 children) for $13. Call the Husky Ticket Office (206 - 543-2200) for information. Individual game reserved tickets will also be available for sale through all TicketMaster outlets over the phone (206) 628-0888 or via the internet at www.ticketmaster.com.\n\nMeet the Press: Bob Bender conducts weekly media gatherings every Tuesday at 10 a.m. in the basketball meeting area (room 221) located on the second floor of the Graves Building which is directly north of Edmundson Pavilion.\n\nHigh Hopes: The Huskies return four starters and nine letterman from a team that came within one second of the Elite Eight and was ranked No. 24 in the final ESPN/USA Today poll. Returning talent represents 85-percent of the points from the 1998 team that averaged 78.7 points per game, the highest figure since 1976. The high-scoring trio of seniors Todd MacCulloch (18.6) and Donald Watts (16.9) along with junior Deon Luton (15.4) returns after combining for 50.8 points per outing last season. MacCulloch, a first-team All-Pac-10 center, led the nation in field goal shooting the last two years (67.6% in 1997, 65.0% in 1998) and is a two-time Playboy All-American. Watts and Luton were both 1998 honorable mention All-Pac-10 selections. Numerous publications have included Washington in their preseason polls, some of them projecting the Huskies as a Top-10 team.\n\nSweet Season: \"Sweet.\" How better to describe a 1998 season during which Washington returned to the NCAA Tournament after a 12-year absence, advancing to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1984? The Huskies completed the campaign with a 20-10 record, their first 20-win season since 1987. They finished fourth in the Pac-10 with an 11-7 mark. Washington garnered its first NCAA Tournament invitation since 1986 and proceeded to defeat Xavier and Richmond before a last-second loss to Connecticut. The UW improved its record during each of Coach Bob Benderis first five seasons. His inaugural team in 1994 had a 5n22 record followed by a 10n17 mark in 1995, 16n12 in 1996, 17n11 in 1997 and 20-10 last year. The improvement has been difficult due to the parellel rise of the Pacific-10 Conference which produced two of the last four NCAA champions and advanced four teams to the Sweet 16 each of the last two seasons.\n\nReturning Talent: Four starters and nine lettermen from last yearis NCAA Tournament team return. Joining that group is 6-6 sophomore forward Greg Clark who red-shirted his first year at Washington after transferring from Long Beach State. Clark was one of the Westis most-recruited athletes as a player at Grossmont High School in San Diego, Calif. The Huskies boast a terrific trio of 7-foot senior center Todd MacCulloch, senior guard Donald Watts and junior guard Deon Luton. A two-time Playboy All-American, MacCulloch led the nation in field goal shooting each of the last two years (67.6% in 1997, 65.0% in 1998). He was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection while Watts and Luton received honorable mention conference acclaim. Last yearis team was the highest scoring Husky outfit since 1976, averaging 78.7 points per contest. MacCulloch (18.6), Watts (16.9) and Luton (15.4) combined to average 50.8 points an outing, making them the second-highest scoring trio in Husky history behind only the 1972 group of Steve Hawes (21.7), Charles Dudley (16.5) and Louie Nelson (15.1) who averaged 53.3 points. Those three all eventually played in the NBA. Sophomore forward Thalo Green sparked a late-season surge after his insertion into the starting lineup. He replaced Patrick Femerling for the final three regular-season games and the Tournament. The Huskies responded with a 5-1 record in his starts, during which Green averaged 8.7 points and 2.7 assists. Junior Chris Walcott, a 6-8 forward, also emerged at the end of last season. He scored a career-high 14 points in the critical upset of No. 18 UCLA. Sophomore guards Dan Dickau, Michael Johnson and Bryan Brown return with a year of collegiate experience under their belts. Dickau assumed the starting point guard position vacated by Jan Wooten. Junior walk-on Andrew Moritz provides depth for the guard corps.\n\nDepartures: Only three players from last yearis team did not return, including starting point guard Jan Wooten who averaged 5.7 points and 2.7 assists per game in 1998. Another point guard, Chris Thompson, has used up his eligibility and will join the Husky staff as a student assistant coach. Patrick Femerling, a 7-1 center averaged 5.7 points and ranked second on the team with 6.1 rebounds per game. He decided to forego his senior season and signed in July with a team from Berling of the professional league in his native Germany.\n\nNewcomers: The Washington roster is bolstered by the addition of three scholarship freshman recruits and two invited walk-ons. The Huskies signed one player at each position, inking 6-3 guard Senque Carey and 6-5 forward Grant Leep in the early period last November and 6-9 center Marlon Shelton during June. A native of East Palo Alto, Calif., Carey prepped at St. Francis High School. He averaged nearly 25 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists as a senior, helping the team to a 25-8 record and a runner-up finish in the Northern California championships. He was named the 1998 regional Player of the Year and was twice voted MVP of the West Catholic Athletic League. Carey was rated 15th in the Long Beach Press Best in the West poll. Leep hails from the same Mount Vernon (Wash.) High School that produced Mark Hendrickson, a two-time All-Pac-10 performer from Washington State. Leep averaged 17.3 points as a senior and earned all-state accolades. He led his team to the state semifinals each of his final two years. Shelton is the son of former NBA and Oregon State standout Lonnie Shelton. Marlon posted 12-point, 11-rebound and 4-blocked shot per game averages as a senior at Rochester (Mich.) High School. He has an 88-inch (7-4) wingspan and will fill the backup center role vacated by Patrick Femerling. Joining the team as an invited walk-on is freshman Michael Westphal, the son of current Seattle Sonic coach and former NBA all-star Paul Westphal. Michael totalled 15 points and six rebounds per game at Chaparral High School in Scottsdale, Ariz. A field of 16 Husky hopefuls (15 legitimate contenders plus local KING TV sportscaster Gaard Swanson) participated in the sixth-annual Washington walk-on tryouts on Oct. 22 at Edmundson Pavilion. Two players earned roster spots with their performances during the open tryouts, sophomore Jajuan Winesbury, a 6-7 forward from Steilacoom (Wash.) High School and freshman Travis Duty, a 6-4 guard from Seattle's O'Dea High School. He hit 4-of-6 shots from 3-point range Feb. 5 at Arizona after entering the game shooting 5-of-12 on treys. He averaged 4.8 points on 48-percent shooting in conference play, improving from 2.2 points on 36-percent shooting in non-conference games. Dickau is an avid fan of former NBA standout \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich. He owns every Maravich basketball card."
