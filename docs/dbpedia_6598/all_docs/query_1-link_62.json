        "text": "Story by Billy Cox billy.cox@heraldtribune.com\n\nPhotos and video by Thomas Bender thomas.bender@heraldtribune.com\n\nSARASOTA — On the eve of his televised skywalk across Georgia's Tallulah Gorge in 1970, Karl Wallenda told Sports Illustrated why he never looked down. It was the high-wire nightmare at Detroit's State Fair Coliseum on Jan. 30, 1962:\n\nAttired in the cummerbunds and billowing sleeves of the circus' most famous family, four cast members took their spots atop a 5/8-inch diameter steel cable, strung 32 feet above the arena floor. As always, there was no net below.\n\nThe four were yoked into pairs by padded shoulder bars, upon which two more standing teammates, also stabilized by balancing poles, harnessed themselves into a second-level shoulder bar. In a chair above them, secured by her own balancing pole, sat Wallenda's niece, Jana Schepp.\n\nThis was the seven-person chair pyramid, Karl's signature creation and a marvel of kinetic human architecture. Fragility belied by strength and synchronization, the bottom four were set to hoist the assembly to the opposite platform. And midway through, Schepp would stand on her chair, the way she'd done countless times before.\n\nOnly, this time, in a flash, the formation collapsed.\n\nJolted by a misstep on the bottom tier below, hit by Jana falling from above, Wallenda grabbed the wire as she clung to his back. He and nephew Gunther held on to Jana long enough for the floor crew to spread safety padding below. But it was hardly enough.\n\n\"There is a picture in my mind of the ring down there . . . and the boys,\" Wallenda said. \"They are broken and still, and around them there are the balance poles and bars and the chair . . . just pieces. That picture is in my mind and I never lose it. If I look down once I know I will see it again . . . those boys. If I look I go mad. I don't look.\"\n\nDead in the wreckage below was nephew Dieter Schepp and son-in-law Dick Faughnan. Adopted son Mario would ride a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Instantly-widowed daughter Jenny called her dad a murderer for allowing Dieter, the ostensible weak link, to walk the line that day.\n\n“ I tell you the truth, the only time I was ever really frightened was at Tallulah Gorge in Georgia ”\n\nThe tragedy could have ripped lesser clans apart. But by sheer force of personality and example — he returned to the wire the very next day, fighting through the pain of a broken pelvis — Karl Wallenda would reassemble the fragments once more into a tight unit, family and otherwise. And in so doing, he set a standard bar so high, his descendents have never caught up.\n\nWitness the success of Nik Wallenda, who earned a superstar reputation by traversing Niagara Falls, the Grand Canyon, and the Chicago skyline, venues his great grandfather never attempted.\n\n\"Nobody gets rich in the circus — not even in America,\" Karl once remarked. Yet, at age 36, Nik's globally televised exploits have pulled in the kinds of dollars his inspiration could only dream of.\n\nEven so, Nik confesses a mystical awe of the man he knows only through newsreel footage, pictures and family stories. He celebrates Karl at virtually every stop and says, \"He whispers in my ears.\" But it doesn't stop there. The patriarch whose most enduring presence in the YouTube afterlife is his own shattering demise reaches out across time and space, rematerializing in dreams, urging the impossible: \"We will walk to the moon. Are you ready?\"\n\nToday, however, the dynasty Karl Wallenda worked so hard to create in America is splintered into internecine rivalries that no bandages are likely to heal. What remains is a ghost story, and perhaps a showdown with destiny in a Northeast Georgia wilderness.\n\nBut as Karl Wallenda admitted in a 1973 magazine article, five years before his mortal plunge in Puerto Rico, \"I tell you the truth, the only time I was ever really frightened was at Tallulah Gorge in Georgia.\"\n\nPerpetuating the legacy of Karl Wallenda — testing the limits of skill, strength, imagination, nerve and persistence — is an enterprise whose DNA haunts his descendants. But when the leader of the pack collided with the violence of physics 37 years ago, he took something with him that has yet to be recovered.\n\nGrandson Rick Wallenda traces the schism with a family-tree spreadsheet that diverges along maternal lines. Grandson Tino Wallenda volunteers a melancholy smile and says the aftermath of Karl's death is as familiar as the Old Testament: \"This goes back to Abraham's two wives in the Bible, and their children. So now we have conflict between the Muslims and the Jews.\"\n\nThe modern version of that ancient tale playing out in Sarasota involves one of the most unique and competitive dynasties in showbiz history. It finds the patriarch's heirs lionizing \"the old man\" in ways Karl Wallenda likely never envisioned. They have revisited his venues, scaled the same heights, recreated the dizzying journeys, step for step.\n\nLast year, the great-grandson he never met announced the most audacious tribute yet, one no family member has attempted to recreate. In the summer of 2015, Nik Wallenda would cross Tallulah Gorge on the 45th anniversary of Karl's most spectacular wirewalk.\n\nThe appointment seemed pre-ordained. At Sarasota's Ringling Circus Museum, the casual attire Nik Wallenda wore in 2008 when he set the world record for highest and longest distance traveled on a bicycle is on display. Several feet away, the spangled bolero jacket Karl wore during the 1,000-foot long, 750-foot high crossing in rural Georgia is a museum fixture.\n\nBut Nik would up the ante. By employing the same technology the Sochi Winter Olympics producers applied to downhill skiing, he would visually resurrect his ancestor's performance by matching him, move for move, against an overlay of Karl's phantom images.\n\n\"There were six camera angles on my great-grandfather at Tallulah Gorge, and it's all on video,\" Nik said last year. \"Now I can walk up there with my hero.\"\n\nThe twist: Nik's hero completed not one but two headstands midway through his 19-minute skywalk. Nik has yet to perfect the headstand and does not incorporate them into his shows.\n\nBy March, Nik was calling it off, saying the graphics technology \"isn't there yet — it's under development, and we're waiting for that.\" He called his designs on Tallulah Gorge a question of if, not when.\n\nCarla Wallenda, Karl's granddaughter and Nik's aunt, contends there was another reason for the delay. \"Nik can't do headstands,\" she says. \"It's that simple.\"\n\nHer son, Nik's cousin Rick, is lobbying Georgia officials for permission to do the walk himself. \"My grandfather did two headstands,\" he says. \"I told them I'll do three.\"\n\nHere's how it started. You may need a flow chart:\n\nKarl Wallenda and first wife Martha got divorced in 1934. It was jagged and messy, the way divorces often are. But fast-forward a few years, and:\n\nKarl and Martha have both remarried and started new lives. Except they're next-door neighbors. And the families they started together — as well as the new ones they've begun separately — co-mingle easily. Furthermore: Martha doesn't like to be alone. So when her new husband goes on the road with the circus, Martha regularly spends the night next door with Karl and his second wife. Helen.\n\nAnd this is how Happily Ever After played out at the Arlington Street residence in mid-century Sarasota. Sort of.\n\n\"It was a Peyton Place,\" recalled Karl's son Mario. \"You wouldn't believe some of the shenanigans that went on in the family.\"\n\nCharismatic, bon vivant, a magnetic presence both on and off the stage, the fearless, strapping, martini-sipping immigrant from Magdeburg, Germany — along with his four-person pyramid — was automatic box office in post-World War I Europe. When circus mogul John Ringling brought Karl, brother Herman, partner Joe Geiger and Helen Kreis to Sarasota in 1928 as his headliner act, the sensation was certified mainstream by that staple of American culture — the Wheaties cereal box cover.\n\n\"The Wallendas always include Wheaties among their carefully selected foods,\" crowed General Mills. \"A bowlful of Wheaties with plenty of milk or cream and sugar with some kind of fruit.\"\n\n“ Once dad got killed, all these feuds started. He made everybody go together, he was the glue that held us together. ”\n\nOnce in the States, Karl's 1927 marriage to Martha Schepp, a dancer, would dissolve as his fling with Helen became a wedding in 1935.\n\nKarl and Martha produced daughter Jenny. Karl and Helen had a daughter named Carla, and they adopted a son, Mario. Martha, following the divorce, married famed Ringling veterinarian J.Y. \"Doc\" Henderson. With circus animals prowling the Hendersons' home like housecats, life on Arlington Street would never be dull. And from there, the family roster grew more complex with an expanding series of begats:\n\nJenny begat two children with Alberto Zoppe — Tino and Delilah. (Nik, and his sister Lijana, come from Delilah and husband Terry Troffer.) Jenny's second husband, Faughnan, would die in Detroit, but she would marry aerialist Andy Anderson, the only member of the Motor City disaster to escape unharmed. Jenny and Andy had a daughter, Tammy, whose lion-taming skills would come of age with a \"Jungle Princess\" act.\n\nCarla married circus veteran Iginio Bogino. They had two sons, Mario and Rick. Carla would also have two daughters, Rietta and Valerie, one from each of two subsequent marriages.\n\nKarl's only male heir, Mario Wallenda, was paralyzed in the Detroit spill at age 22. Mario and his wife Linda bore no children. Which means extending the Wallenda name legally involves completing a pile of paperwork.\n\nAnd for all the disparate fortunes and trajectories in the wake of Karl's fatal accident, those who knew him agree on this — there was more to his mystique than balancing poles and shoulder bars.\n\nGranddaughter Rietta, 54, watched Karl die with her own eyes. She tries to keep that image roped off, and focuses on a bigger picture:\n\n\"Not only is he a patriarch and icon, he was a loving, caring, genuine person. He always told us you attract more bees with honey. He had friends all over the world. My grandfather taught me to be genuine and real, and to be a diplomat in life.\"\n\nKarl's survivors also agree on something else — walking nickel-thick steel wire can be easier to master than diplomacy. Son Mario: \"Once dad got killed, all these feuds started. He made everybody go together, he was the glue that held us together.\"\n\nKarl Wallenda's early years sound like an Old World Horatio Alger story. A boy tracing a lineage of jugglers, funambulists, clowns, acrobats and lion-tamers back to 18th-century Bohemia is raised — at least briefly — by an abusive father. Before abandoning the kid, his siblings and their mother, Englebert Wallenda left young son Karl with a permanent reminder.\n\n\"People would sometimes ask him a question and he may have answered something completely different,\" says grandson Tino. \"He answered what he thought he heard because he was practically deaf in one ear. When he was a little boy his father hit him in the head and destroyed his hearing in one ear.\"\n\nNecessity forced Karl to grow up fast. \"At one point, when he was 7 or 8,\" Tino continues, \"his sister got sick. He carried her to the hospital and she died in his arms.\" By age 11, with Germany at war, Karl was helping put food money in his family's pockets by doing handstands for tips on stacked chairs in beer halls. He also worked a coal mine, and pulled time with a traveling circus.\n\nKarl's career as an aerialist took off when he answered a trade-magazine ad for \"an experienced hand balancer with courage.\" Initially renowned for his upper-body strength, by 1922, the teenaged Wallenda was sure-footed enough to command his own troupe of aerialists, where the human pyramids started.\n\nSix years later, under contract to Ringling after a tour of Cuba, Wallenda's team opened its campaign in America by playing to a standing ovation at Madison Square Garden. \"It is wine,\" marveled the young Wallenda. \"It intoxicates.\"\n\nSettling into Ringling's circus winter retreat in Sarasota, Karl began buying parcels of real estate across town. He also expanded his repertoire on the wire with the complex seven-person chair pyramid. Karl broke away from Ringling and formed his own circus, only to discover his limits.\n\n\"Great performer, lousy businessman,\" lamented Mario. \"The circus went down the toilet in 1947. He owed all these performers money so he paid them in land.\" Karl refused to declare bankruptcy. It took some 20 years to settle his debts.\n\nGrandson Tino, 64, remembers the day Karl told him he had balanced the ledger with everyone he owed: \"That gave me a sense of the integrity of my grandfather. There was something about him people just loved. And he didn't have to say much.\"\n\nThe family sold off the Arlington place years ago. The remainder of Karl's original 22-acre investment off Lockwood Ridge is still in Wallenda hands.\n\nReaching what was once called the \"Wallenda Grotefent Training Winter Quarters\" (named for Karl's half brother Arthur) requires passing the residence of both Tino's family and Nik's parents — they're next-door neighbors — and swinging south on Henrietta Place.\n\nThis is where, for more than 50 years, Karl's son Mario watched the world go by from his wheelchair on his carport. Fresh rains have left puddles in the crunchy unpaved lane that leads past Rick Wallenda's trailer and buttonhooks past their mother Carla's place. It ends in a clearing where aerial and swaypole platforms await the next training session.\n\nThis is the neighborhood where youngsters Tino, Delilah and Rick enjoyed happier days together. This is where they started climbing and falling down and bouncing back before fear could lock in. This is where imaginary games — cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians — couldn't compete with their parents' real-life exploits under the big top.\n\n\"Most kids don't know what their parents do — they can't go into the operating room if their father's a surgeon and watch him operate,\" Tino recalls. \"But we were there with our parents, we saw them working, we heard the applause and we wanted to get in the middle of all this, because there's such excitement to it. The applause tells you there's a connection between you and the audience. A friendship develops. There's nothing like it.\"\n\nAnd nobody drew the applause like their grandfather.\n\nBy the 1970s, at an age where athletes have long since hung up their spikes and gloves, Karl Wallenda's act was finding bigger audiences.\n\nDuring a 1976 bicentennial moment at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, eschewing his traditional showman's costume for a baseball cap, a tie, white shirt and trousers, The Great Wallenda attached contemporary and colonial American flags to his balancing pole. And in an iconic snapshot from the nation's year-long birthday party, Sarasota's emissary to the world wirewalked above a Phillies doubleheader.\n\nHe teamed up for thrill shows with the most electrifying motorcycle daredevil of his day — the star-spangled, Elvis jump-suited, bus-hopping, bone-splintering Evel Knievel. A 1973 flyer for a twin-bill at JFK Stadium implored fans to \"See Them Before They Die!!\" In February 1978, a month before his death, Karl's heroics — often celebrated with a victory martini — were dramatized in a made-for-TV film \"The Great Wallendas,\" with Lloyd Bridges and Britt Ekland.\n\nBut fissures were appearing before Karl stepped onto his final stage, at age 73, in Puerto Rico.\n\n\"He wanted to continue performing forever,\" says Tino, who measures his words with the caution of an election-year incumbent. \"He had several family members who said — uh, let me say this politically correctly. They essentially gave him a choice, that they would no longer perform with him if he continued to work because they felt he was too old.\"\n\nWas Karl Wallenda too old?\n\n\"Not in my eyes, not in my mind,\" Tino says. \"He was more skilled at the end of his career than almost anybody that performed with him currently in the troupe.\"\n\nLike cousin Tino, Rick Wallenda, 60, once did the rigging for and performed with his grandfather. Rick is more blunt than Tino — \"I'm not a very good diplomat\" — and names Nik's dad, Terry Troffer:\n\n\"He tried to pull a power play with my grandfather and take over the act in 1978. My grandfather fired him. His plan backfired. Now he sheds tears on TV crying that if he had been in Puerto Rico the accident would not have happened.\"\n\nTroffer, a Sarasota native who joined Team Wallenda in 1972 and married Karl's granddaughter Delilah in 1974, says there was no power play involved. In November 1977, four months before Puerto Rico, Troffer says, a backyard rehearsal shook him to his core.\n\nThey were practicing a three-man bicycle pyramid — two bicycles on the wire, both riders connected by a shoulder bar — some 18-20 feet off the ground. Karl, balancing pole at the ready, mounted the shoulder bar and arranged the chair in preparation for the stand. Troffer, the front rider, didn't see what happened behind him.\n\n\"People gasped, the wire shook, and my balancing pole went from horizontal to completely vertical,\" recalls Nik's father. \"When Karl tried to sit down, the chair was so crooked he fell over backwards.\"\n\nTroffer says his grandfather-in-law was briefly hospitalized for a fractured neck vertebra. But a more important link had been severed.\n\n\"It was an obvious mistake and it was a dealbreaker for me,\" says Troffer. \"I didn't have the courage to work with him, the trust was gone. I said 'Karl, I can't hold the pyramid for you anymore.' Karl was the greatest, he was a phenomenon. Muhammed Ali was the greatest. But everyone reaches a certain point, and to me it was clear that Karl was at the end of his game.\"\n\nTroffer says Karl took his resignation in stride, and calls their professional dissolution amicable. Upon announcing that he and Delilah wanted to start a separate tour, Troffer says, \"Karl said that's great — anything to keep the Wallenda name out there.\"\n\nTroffer says he is unfazed by the resentments of his in-laws. \"I try for the most part to ignore them all,\" he says. \"I have no interest or desire to know what they're doing.\"\n\nUltimately, Troffer says, Karl called his own shots. And in the end, albeit unintentionally, The Great Wallenda upstaged his own greatest fear and a worst-case scenario. Troffer remembers Karl's words after visiting a long-time manager adrift in a fog of dementia.\n\n\"Karl told me, 'I will not die in bed.'\"\n\nOf all the Wallenda survivors, maybe Rick comes closest to connecting with the free-fall horror of Karl's last act. One would suspect Rick's uncle Mario, crippled during the pyramid accident 53 years ago in Detroit, might have had the inside track in that department. But the impact knocked Mario's recollections sideways and his memory of Detroit remained eternally blank.\n\nRick has survived two major mishaps he'll never forget, in 1987 and 1996.\n\nThe first venue was a Shriner circus at the old Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Rick lost traction on the wire while attempting to leapfrog over first wife Debbie and land on his feet during a live show. He dislocated his shoulder when he snatched the cable and slammed into the concrete 30 feet below. He partially broke his fall by grabbing lion-cage bars on the way down.\n\n\"I landed head first and shattered my left wrist. I broke my eye socket in two places, I fractured my skull in back, and I broke my right arm and hand,\" he says. \"I broke two or three ribs on my right side, and my right hip.\"\n\nRick spent three weeks at Baptist Medical Center. Five months later, he was on the wire again.\n\nThe spill at Arnold's Amusement Park in Iowa occurred during setups nearly a decade later. While attempting to change clamps on a high-wire pole, the entire pole toppled and took Rick — feet first, this time — with it. In addition to suffering a spinal compression fracture, \"my calcaneus,\" he says, tapping both heels, \"shattered like you'd dropped a piece of glass. They said I'd never walk again.\"\n\nBorn in Chicago between family road shows, abandoned before age 3 by his father, raised by grandparents Karl and Helen, Rick's life path has been mercurial. He dropped out of ninth grade — \"I didn't have much desire for anything other than the circus\" — dabbled in weed and LSD as a teenager, got suspended from Karl's operations, traded hallucinogenics for Christianity, and by age 19 \"I was literally my grandfather's right-hand man.\"\n\nBut by the end of the 1990s, he had walked away from a circus career he estimates was pulling in $1 million annually at its peak. Divorce, the Iowa accident, the loss of 36-year-old brother (not uncle) Mario in 1993 to AIDS, a drinking habit that crested at a case of beer a day — the weight was too much.\n\nRick sold off most of his circus gear. He gave the performance name bequeathed to him by grandmother Helen — \"The Great Wallendas\" — to Tino. Rick's mother Carla passed \"The Flying Wallendas\" onto Tino. Having earned a GED, Rick went on to college and acquired writing degrees. But the tug of history was as irresistable as gravity.\n\nIn February, 2001, five years after Iowa, he joined Tino in staging an outdoor coup in Sarasota that would numerically surpass their grandfather's schematics — an eight-person, three-level pyramid. Once in place, they briefly squeezed two additional walkers onto the wire to drive the total to 10.\n\nLater that year, the Guinness Book of World Records, which recorded that event, would sponsor Nik Wallenda's eight-person, four-level pyramid assembly in Japan. Guinness recognized both feats.\n\nRick and Tino would perform the seven once more in 2001, in Indianapolis. But it would be the last time they teamed up together.\n\nRecommitted to the high wire, Rick attempted to reacquire the performance names he gave to Tino. Tino refused.\n\n\"I don't want to bring up a lot of negative stuff here,\" Tino says. \"But I continue to hold it. To a certain extent I want to hold it because I want to ensure that all the Wallendas are not going to have any repercussions from anybody else by going under the Wallenda banner. And if I own that title then I can also mantain that standard. It'll go to my kids.\"\n\nIn July 2007, Rick was arrested by sheriff's deputies on allegations of molesting his daughter. Rick says he got framed in a child-custody squabble, and in December 2007, following an investigation by the Florida Department of Children and Families, the state attorney's office declined to prosecute.\n\nRick's arrest made news in the the Herald-Tribune, but the paper failed to run a followup about the dropped charges. Rick claims competitors have attempted to sabotage his career by forwarding the original story — which referenced his given name, Enrico, not his stage name Rick — to other parks and circuses. He declines to name the suspect(s) on the record.\n\n\"It destroys a person's life,\" he says, \"and the travesty of the whole thing is, there's no consequence to the accuser.\"\n\nNevertheless, Rick continues to tour with his own performance troupe today. Its motto: \"Exceeding The Limits of Tradition.\"\n\n\"Faith,\" Rick says of his comeback, \"provides a reference point for me. I walk according to God, and the Bible provides moral guidance.\" As for alcohol: \"I don't even take Nyquil now.\"\n\nIn 2008, some 34 years after his grandfather completed a skywalk at Kings Island amusement park in Ohio, Rick returned to the scene and staged his own version. At 2,000 feet long, his performance under soggy skies broke Karl's distance record.\n\nIn 2013, Rick walked the wire during Evel Knievel Days, an annual daredevil extravaganza in Butte, Montana. He continues to talk with Robbie Knievel — son of the late great bus-jumper — about teaming up like their forebears during the heydays of disco.\n\nWhen Karl fell for the final time on March 22, 1978, Rick was at a missionary training school in Germany. Tino was working one of Karl's road shows in Sioux Falls, S.D. Delilah and Terry were in Sarasota. She was recovering from a miscarriage.\n\nKarl's last stand — a 200-foot walk between the towers of the Condado Plaza Hotel — was not an epic drama but an unscheduled afterthought, a publicity stunt to boost circus-ticket sales in San Juan, Puerto Rico. A couple of hundred people gathered in the street to watch. But the video has been seen by millions:\n\n11:15 a.m. local time. Karl's dark trousers and white shirt sleeves flutter in the brisk spring winds. Rigged largely by local workers, the entire webbing begins to wobble. Instead of being attached directly to the cable, the stabilizing guy wires are suspended from shackled extensions hanging inches below the cable, a mistake that creates more slack.\n\n“ He was the master we all looked up to, who was invincible. And if this could happen to him, you begin to focus on yourself and think, it can happen to me. ”\n\nKarl tempers his stride, but the sway and gusts in excess of 30 mph are twisting his balancing pole into a dangerous see-saw. He begins to crouch, but before he can settle into a safe perch, the 35-pound pole tilts against him. He topples to his left and loses his grasp of the wire. Plunging four seconds and 120 feet into instant obliteration, the Great Wallenda continues to resist the inevitable — he reaches for his pole in mid-air and hangs on with both hands.\n\nHe bangs onto a parked taxi at maybe 100 mph before crashing into the sidewalk.\n\nMonitoring the guy-wire connections on the ground, granddaughter Rietta is just 50 feet from impact. She is 17. Rietta dashes upstairs to the hotel suite and breaks the news to her grandmother who, out of fear, never watches Karl's acts. Rietta then phones Carla to alert the family.\n\nRietta does not accompany her grandfather's body back to Sarasota, nor does she attend the funeral. Within hours of his death, Rietta and her colleagues are back under the big top in San Juan, doing pyramids and aerials. She completes Karl's scheduled booking, which runs for about a week.\n\n\"I was emotionally shaken up,\" Rietta says. \"But nerve-wise, I was fine. My grandfather always taught us the show must go on, and I knew I needed to honor him that way.\"\n\n\"Shocked. Shocked,\" grandson Tino recalls of the moment he heard the news. \"Completely shocked.\n\n\"He was the master we all looked up to, who was invincible. And if this could happen to him, you begin to focus on yourself and think, it can happen to me.\"\n\nThirty-seven years later, Tino and wife Olinka are keeping a sharp eye on two busy grandchildren in their back yard, which is crowded with circus props.\n\nLike most healthy youngsters, their legs are spinning wheels — only, these kids are big on climbing, as high as they can get away with it, which isn't very far. Their parents, Robinson and Alida Cortes, are fourth- and seventh-generation circus stars respectively. Alida is the one with Wallenda blood. By time these youngsters come of age, living memory of Karl will be even more remote.\n\nWith a little prompting, for a moment, in his mind's eye, Tino is back in South Dakota, 1978, contemplating his next move atop the high-wire platform for the first time since the disaster in Puerto Rico. His cousin Mario — Rick's brother — is there too, preparing to join him on the human pyramid. But Karl is dead, and the axis has tilted.\n\nYou can mask fear on the ground, but upstairs on the wire it can become a menacing quiver. Tino describes the performance as \"very tedious.\" Mario took his spot above Tino on the shoulder bar, and Tino could tell immediately. \"It was one of those vibration moments,\" he remembers. The Wallendas pulled it off — indeed, they completed the entire run in Sioux Falls without mishap — but something inside Mario shut down.\n\n\"Oh, he was on the wire later on, but never on the pyramid,\" says Tino. \"Maybe he didn't want to talk about it with anyone, but during rehearsals, during the show, he was very uncomfortable and nervous. Eventually he had to quit because he just couldn't handle it.\"\n\nSometimes, voluntarily stepping aside can require as much courage as walking the wire. Especially in this family.\n\nTino's daughter Andrea, for instance, started performing for live audiences at 12. \"My parents never forced me to do it,\" she says. \"I wanted to be like everybody else.\"\n\nBut by her late teens, her dad noticed something Andrea wasn't ready to admit to herself. Tino says it began when Andrea's older sister Alida left the troupe to get married, leaving a vacancy on the pyramid.\n\n\"So Andrea really began to push herself, and she excelled greatly,\" Tino recalls. \"But she began to develop a fear, to the point where in the end she couldn't even go on the platform anymore because she started to shake. And we had to get her off the wire because I knew she would've just continued on.\"\n\nNow 37, Andrea says she still enjoys practicing on the cable, so long as she has no one else's life in her hands. \"I guess I never trusted myself completely,\" she says. \"I trusted my father more than I trusted myself.\"\n\nUntil her death in April at age 87, Jenny, Karl's oldest child, lived a mile or so north of the old neighborhood where Delilah, Rietta, Rick and Carla have spent most of their lives.\n\nDespite the ensuing family tensions, Jenny and Carla remained inseparable. In fact, Jenny's DeSoto Road home was Grand Central Station for the disparate family factions — Rick (\"The World Famous Wallendas\"), Tino (\"The Flying Wallendas\" and \"The Great Wallendas\") and Nik (\"King of the Highwire\"). By multiple accounts, those interactions were often superficial and brief.\n\nWith her mother in failing health, Tammy and some of her kids moved in with Jenny in 2012. Within days of Jenny's death, grandson Nik -- who holds the deed to the house -- served Tammy with an eviction notice. He declines to discuss the dynamics on the record. Tammy, unemployed, has refused to leave. Legal action is proceeding.\n\nTrained as an aerialist and raised around circus animals, Tammy says the family's tug-of-war over the high-wire legacy drove her away from it.\n\n\"I was 12 or 13 when my grandfather died and all I heard was 'I'm a Wallenda, I'm a Wallenda.' We've all got Karl Wallenda's blood in us,\" she says, \"what difference does it make? I didn't want to compete with my own family and this business is so competitive already. So I got into lion and tiger training.\"\n\nTammy, 50, says her detour into the big cat ring was such heresy, she didn't tell her mom about it until Jenny caught her live act in Las Vegas. Tammy says Jenny freaked out and screamed at her during the show.\n\n\"My argument was, Mom, how many people have died from falling? We've lost so many people from aerials,\" Tammy says. \"Then I said how many people do you know who've died from being mauled by their tigers? Then boom — three happened right in a row.\"\n\n“ I knocked myself out of his mouth, and then he grabbed my back and he was shaking me around like a rag doll and I kept punching back. When he got me by the throat, I'm like, that's it, I'm dead, my god, don't let me die in front of my kids, please. ”\n\nIn 1997, trainer Wayne Franzen was killed by a 400-pound Bengal tiger during a live performance in Carrolltown, Pennsylvania. The following year, outside Gainesville, Chuck Lizza had his neck snapped by a tiger named Jupiter after Lizza accidentally tripped into the cat. Just five weeks later, Jupiter attacked and killed fellow performer Joy Holiday.\n\nNot long after German-born magician Roy Horn was critically injured in 2003 by a white tiger during a show in Las Vegas, Tammy's number came up.\n\nWhile rehearsing with a 650-pound male Siberian named Marley at an armory in Dodge City, Kansas, Tammy was bitten in the back of her leg as her two children played outside the caged performing area.\n\n\"I knocked myself out of his mouth, and then he grabbed my back and he was shaking me around like a rag doll and I kept punching back. When he got me by the throat, I'm like, that's it, I'm dead, my god, don't let me die in front of my kids, please.\"\n\nMarley retreated after Tammy gave him a shot to the throat with her elbow. She later discovered Marley's sellers neglected to tell her the cat had killed his previous trainer. Tammy wound up with a broken nose, black eyes and 67 staples in her leg following seven hours of surgery. She says it took her two days to catch up with the next show, but only because \"I couldn't get out of the hospital sooner. Plus I was driving the semi.\"\n\nFor two kids who watched mom survive the Marley encounter, the memory is just another childhood postcard. A decade later, both are apparently aiming for circus careers.\n\nQuentin, 18, is a trained aerialist but volunteers at Big Cat Habitat. \"I want to become a very good trainer like Gunther Gebel-Williams,\" he says, alluding to the fabled Ringling Brothers trainer.\n\nSeventeen-year-old sister Zoryah loves swinging ladders, lyra hoops and \"a little bit of everything.\" Like her brother, when it comes to exotic pets, the extraordinary becomes common.\n\n\"We've grown up with all kinds of animals around the house, lions and snakes and iguanas and prairie dogs,\" she says. \"We had a very mean prairie dog that would attack our lion so we had to keep him in a cage. And sometimes he'd attack the lion through the cage.\"\n\nWhen people ask Carla Wallenda if she's kin to Nik, his aunt has a swift reply: \"No, he's related to me, I was here first.\" And she's still here. At 79, Carla continues to taunt gravity, a good six years longer than her father did. And she is undeterred by the casualties.\n\nHer aunt and Karl's sister-in-law, Rietta Grotefent, tumbled to her death at 43 in Omaha, Nebraska, from a 100-foot-swaypole in 1963. And in 1972, Carla would lose her husband, Chico Guzman, to a fall.\n\nGuzman, 39, had just relieved Karl of his balancing pole following a performance in Wheeling, West Virginia, when the pole struck a live wire. The shock knocked Guzman onto some electrical wiring 10 feet below, from which he fell an additional 50 feet in front of 6,000 spectators.\n\nCarla's only major accident was a fractured tailbone from a 15-foot spill in practice. She may never give up the swaypole, because viewing the Earth from bird's-eye heights is a rush for which terrestrial activity apparently has no cure.\n\nShe has executed \"iron-jaw\" mid-air suspensions by her teeth, countless hanging perch configurations, dangled from hot air balloons and pulled helicopter neck spins until \"you break your veins in your eyes.\"\n\n\"Accidents,\" she says, \"can happen anyplace. I have to make a living and this is the only way I know or want to. I've done waitress work and hated every minute of it. Why should I go and do a job that I hate?\"\n\nWhen she was younger, Carla planned to retire by 70. At 70, she reset the timetable for 75. Today, she's gunning for 80, with only chronic obstructive pulmonary disease standing in her way. She gets by with an inhaler. She quit smoking in 2013.\n\nCarla keeps in shape by regularly climbing a 45-foot alloy sway pole, each step 16 inches above the next. In live performances, she mounts a 100-foot pole, secures one foot and/or one hand in a loop strap, and strikes dizzying poses with each swirling shift of her weight. Winds permitting, she also does headstands at the summit.\n\nHeadstands are a hallmark of the Wallenda tradition, and are among the reasons Nik's celebrated triumphs have generated skepticism with some of his relatives.\n\n\"Nik never could do a headstand,\" Carla says. \"We've all got callouses on our heads. I felt my father's head in his coffin, and it was still there.\"\n\nWhen you attempt a headstand on steel, your entire body weight rests upon a 2- to 3-inch sliver of your skull. The Wallendas call it the \"sweet spot.\" Its location varies with individual centers of gravity, and scar tissue is painfully acquired.\n\nCarla recalls an understudy from Chile who strapped part of a rubber tire to his head in training. Her son Rick says Karl's brother Herman cut the top out of a fedora for cushioning and \"wore it almost like a yarmulke.\" Rick's own sweet spot is located near his crown.\n\nYou can actually see Tino's sweet spot, just north of a thinning hairline. \"Feel it,\" Tino commands, lowering his head in an invitation to inquisitive fingers. \"That's from doing it for 40-some years.\"\n\nThe sweet spot is like anything else. Use it or lose it.\n\n\"At one point,\" Tino says, \"I went for pretty much the winter months without practicing any headstands because I was confident about doing it. When I started doing headstands again and developed a callous over the top of my callous, which ended up being a blister down underneath and in between, it was murder.\"\n\nTino was the subject of a critically acclaimed 2012 documentary \"The Show Must Go On,\" a somewhat gritty look at life on the road. In one dramatic sequence, blood is streaking from his head to his face, but the wound was from dismantling the platform after the show, not from reopening a sweet spot callous.\n\nTino, who also performs for inmates with Champions for Life prison ministries, obliges a request by taking the wire again and pulling another headstand. The president of the local International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees union holds a perfectly vertical pose for a good five-count and relaxes.\n\nA photographer spots Terry Troffer next door and waves to get his attention. Tino says Terry won't look this way. Why not? Tino smiles and says \"No comment.\"\n\nOutwardly, Tino is sanguine about his nephew Nik's successes. \"It's Nik's time. He wants to have his own brand separate from the Wallendas, and that's fine.\"\n\nBut Tino also volunteers a reminder that drama and success on the wire are often interior experiences. The last time he did the seven-person pyramid was in Europe. An original member left the team and the substitute was an awkward — and potentially dangerous — fit.\n\n\"I had my son on my shoulders, I had three kids on top of me, and after the last show was over, I didn't fall down but I essentially collapsed,\" he says. \"I just couldn't stop the tears, I couldn't stop the emotion welling up inside me. It wasn't joy, it was just knowing that I had brought my whole team through safely.\"\n\nTino's sister Delilah says she never had to tell her kids about what happened to their great-grandfather. Death was a part of their consciousness long before they were old enough to understand it.\n\n“ It brings tears to my eyes right now. My grandfather — he was the one I was always chasing. ”\n\nDelilah remembers being on tour in California — Nik's 1 year old, Lijana's not quite 3 — and fielding the same media questions over and over again: How do you feel about the way your grandfather died? What about the seven, and Detroit?\n\n\"Nik's heard about it since he was a baby,\" she says.\n\nDelilah, who took her first steps on the wire at 3, grew up without that knowledge. The Great Wallenda was immortal. She toured with him. The family was cohesive. She was once a member of Tino's seven-person pyramid posse. And she can still do aerials today.\n\nEven in death, Karl inspired her in ways she could never have predicted. \"I was always about making him proud. I wanted to be the greatest woman doing these things.\" And then? \"How do you say I haven't gotten there, but that's OK because Nik's getting there? People ask me, how can you watch your son do that? But he's living my dream.\"\n\nWhat happened to the family after Karl's fall is more difficult to discuss. \"Jealousy is a horrible thing. It causes a lot of disease,\" she says, \"a lot of cancer in families.\" She prefers to keep the specifics off the record. She'll say this about her brother Tino:\n\n\"We're not as close as we used to be, but we still love each other. We do each have our own lives, we live next door and I'm busy, Tino's got his thing he's doing all the time, so we don't really spend a lot of time together. But he is my brother, and I'm always going to love him.\"\n\nIn 1993, Delilah was so discouraged about her family's circus future, she wrote a book-length elegy titled \"The Last of The Wallendas.\" Her son has obviously reinvigorated the name brand. But for any entertainer at age 62, contemplating the end of things is never an abstraction.\n\nWith palpable anguish, she recalls a 2012 performance in Atlantic City, an invitation from Nik: \"I thought this might be it. It's a hard thing, it's a part of you you're giving up, it's a piece of you being taken away. It's kind of heartbreaking when that's your life, you know? I was born in this business. It's like something you mourn, it's gone, it's finished.\"\n\nOn Christmas morning 2013, Nik surprised her with, among other things, an invitation to accompany him, during the summer of 2014, on a 10-week run at Darien Lake Amusement Park in western New York.\n\nIn 2010, he had asked her to team up for a skywalk some 32 stories above Fort Myers. And this past February, she rejoined him in the seven-person pyramid at Circus Sarasota.\n\nBut in 2012, she turned the tables and persuaded her son to include her in his wirewalk at the Condado Plaza Hotel. She had wanted to walk that site immediately after Karl's death, but authorities wouldn't clear it and she settled for a skywalk tribute performance at a San Juan stadium nearby.\n\nThe 2012 mom-and-son skywalk at the Condado went off without a hitch. When it was over, Delilah could close at least that part of the circle:\n\n\"It brings tears to my eyes right now. My grandfather — he was the one I was always chasing.\"\n\nIn a more merciful universe, Delilah's uncle Mario would've gotten one more crack at walking the wire, too. On the other hand, if the cosmos followed the law of averages, he wouldn't have lived long enough to envy those who do. But The Great Wallenda's son never wasted much time trying to figure it out. Last year, he said he already knew where his train would stop. \"Where I'm going,\" he said, \"the wheelchairs have square wheels.\"\n\nMario was the last living male survivor of the 1962 pyramid collapse. He met his future wife, a nurse named Linda, in a Detroit hospital where the prognosis was bleak. Not only would he never walk again, doctors told him he had maybe 15 years to live, on the outside. But he outlived Linda, his wife of 50 years who died in 2014. \"It ruins the whole plan,\" he said, \"because I was supposed to go first. Because she could live a hell of a lot better without me than I could without her.\"\n\nAt least his family members lived nearby. If only they could've quit bickering.\n\n\"I don't take sides, this one against this one, this one against this one,\" Mario said. \"And six months later it'll change and this one's against somebody else and I just say piss on 'em, let 'em do what they want, I'm not getting in between, they're all family.\"\n\nAfter Linda's death, Mario began dreaming big again, in spite of himself. Linda never understood. \"She used to say we were all nuts.\" He remembered her agony during what turned out to be one of the most exhilarating moments of his life as a paraplegic.\n\n\"She was crying when I was doing the psycho-cycle for Guinness,\" Mario said, \"she was crying and carrying on, saying they don't care if I get killed doing this ...\"\n\nMario's psycho-cycle, or sky cycle, was a sideshow to the Wallenda 8-person pyramid in 2001 as Guinness cameras rolled. The one-of-a-kind motorized two-wheeled gizmo was placed on a wire 40 feet high between two cranes. Mario controlled speed and forward/reverse via electronics built into his balancing pole.\n\n\"I don't know how the hell they put it together,\" he recalled. \"But once I got on the wire, it was like old times . . . I had a ball.\"\n\nHe rode the psycho-cycle in Sarasota again in 2005. And in 2006, as part of a Windy City radio station stunt, Mario psycho-cycled over the Chicago River on a wire. The stunt fell flat on the thrill meter. \"It was kinda boring, watching me go out and back again,\" he conceded. \"I wanted to sell it a little bit.\"\n\nBut as nephew Nik prepared for his Chicago skyline walk last year, Mario's inevitable meditations on the past filled his head with savory possibilities, however remote.\n\n\"I want to go upside down with a counterweight. I think it'd be great, get up there and revolve around. Hell yes! Come on — I'm over 70, why not? I loved my wife dearly, but she's gone and she's probably up there looking down saying that idiot's out of his (bleep)in' mind.\"\n\nA more merciful universe would have provided a storybook ending. Mario had already glimpsed an alternative scenario, which made him shudder. \"Before I go back to a nursing home,\" he said, \"I'll blow my cotton-pickin' brains out.\"\n\nMario died in a hospital bed in April following a series of setbacks from colon-removal surgery.\n\nLike his mom, Tammy's 27-year-old son Blake has worked lions and tigers all his life. He also wrestles alligators and plays with pet snakes. Lately, he is being mentored in venomous serpents by David \"The Cobra Kid\" Weathers in Punta Gorda.\n\nLike everyone else, Blake's ambitions are spurred by Karl's ingenuity, stunts like the \"one-finger stand,\" an illusion concocted by The Great Wallenda involving a buried revolver and a glove. Or handstands on two heads, or handstands on two crutches while lifting one crutch in the air.\n\nBut wirewalking was never on Blake's radar until he turned 19, when \"Nik kind of razzed me about it.\"\n\nBlake not only got the hang of it, today he manages to work the wire with Nik, Tino and Rick. This kind of balance requires more than athletic versatility. It's also about navigating family politics with discretion. An off-the-record chat reveals how tricky that can be.\n\nOn the other hand, \"I learn something new each time I see them,\" says Blake, apparently content with playing second fiddle to the stars, at least for now. \"Everything they do has a purpose. And they're very helpful to me when anything bad happens.\"\n\nSetups, breakdowns, rigging, pacing on the wire, touch pressure on the shoulder bars, stride styles — each camp has different approaches, and Blake's job is to complement them all.\n\n\"Look at what they wear — their costumes are all different. Tino likes to look very prestigious with the tuxedo. Ricky likes the loose shirts; it kind of reminds me of a hippie rocker. Everybody gives Nik issues about him wearing jeans when he does skywalks, but it helps him relate to people and on top of that, he's gotten sponsorships from jean companies.\"\n\nBlake is keeping mental notes about what works and what doesn't. Someday, maybe, if things fall into place, Blake will have his own full-blown show, combining animal acts with aerials. He talks of getting vipers onto the wire, of complicated pratfalls involving trampolines and lions and all manner of what he calls \"the lost arts.\"\n\nAll this from a guy who insists he has a fear of heights. \"I feel comfortable doing pyramids, but I trust an animal more than a person,\" he says. \"If I die, I think it'd be something from the wire, not from an animal. I don't know why I feel that way, it's just an inkling that I have.\"\n\nOn the other hand, when he stands on the platform, surveying the crowds, gauging the buzz of anticipation, Blake can find himself overcome by thoughts of his role in the family continuum.\n\n\"That fear, the butterflies in your stomach, whatever you want to call it — you just have to push against it, that recoil. Sometimes it's an emotional thing, being up there, the announcements.\n\n\"Like, in Nik's act, they talk about the history before the show? A couple of times,\" he says, \"I felt myself cry.\"\n\nRick is so confident he can beat cousin Nik at headstands, he wants to challenge him to a high-wire showdown with the whole world watching. Rick says he has financial backers who can make it happen.\n\nAlthough Nik declines to discuss family divisions on the record, he dismisses his cousin's challenge with a quick \"Rick who?\"\n\nNik still practices in his parents' back yard, but he, his wife Erendira and three kids live miles from the original Wallenda reservation. He says family members are not his rivals. At least, not anymore.\n\n\"I realized, from the very beginning, from seeing my parents and the way I grew up,\" Nik says, \"they had competition from cousins and brothers, and I tried to say how can I step away from that? What can I do that's different so people would hire Nik Wallenda over any of them?\n\n\"We all walk the same wire. We all risk our lives just like anyone else. I would say the family members who are older than me are better wirewalkers than me. Let's face it: they've done it many many more years than I have. They better be, they've got a lot more experience.\"\n\nBut with Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon scratched off his bucket list, the distance is now dramatic.\n\nNik's \"grandeur on a larger scale\" strategy has put him in a higher tax bracket. He has endorsements from an apparel company and a high-end watch manufacturer. His most recent public performances — at Sarasota Ford in December, the 400-foot tall Orlando Eye Ferris wheel in April, in which he wore a VisitOrlando jersey, and at a Mashantucket, Conn., Tanger Outlets mall opening — were comparatively routine commercial ventures. His next big high-wire adventure for the Discovery Channel will likely occur off-shore later this year.\n\n\"I hope that everything I do shines a positive light on my entire family,\" Nik says. \"I hope it raises not only the awareness but the respect for my family. Whether it helps further them in any way, hopefully they get more gigs out of it.\"\n\nOnce his performing career runs its course, Nik has said he could envision testing Sarasota's political waters.\n\nIn a family tract designated by a marble marker that reads \"The Wallendas Aerialists Supreme,\" Karl is buried in Manasota Memorial Park, south side. In the accompanying photo — the master in performance gear, fuchsia vest, matching slacks — something is slightly askew.\n\nHis balancing pole isn't level, but in a stressed diagonal position. Perhaps \"the sell\" is reaching out from the crypt. Moreover, engravers have etched 1904 into the tombstone as his birth year. But Karl was born in 1905.\n\nIn 1980, Rick traveled to where that story ended in Puerto Rico. The goal was to laud his grandfather by wirewalking the Condado Hotel towers. Like his cousin Nik at Niagara Falls — forced to wear a safety harness by squeamish network suits — Rick was told by authorities his televised performance was a no-go unless he installed safety netting.\n\nMore than 30 years later, Nik and his mother got permission to do the walk without the net.\n\nIn March 2014, Rick's troupe pulled a weekend stand at the Mixon Fruit Farms Orange Blossom Festival — wire stunts, headstands, a bicycle pyramid, swaypole, a comic skit. Following a Saturday afternoon show, a small crowd gathered around the autograph table. The fans wanted to know: Where's Nik?\n\nRick shrugged it off: \"We left Nik at home — we don't have enough money for Nik.\"\n\nSimilar scene a month earlier. Rick huddled with officials about securing permits for Island Cityfest at Anna Maria Island in April. \"They were saying 'Hey, we enjoyed your show last weekend at the Georgia Dome,'\" Rick recalls.\n\nIt was Nik who wirewalked the Georgia Dome — for Winter Jam 2014, a Christian music festival.\n\nRick was raised by the legend Nik memorializes. Rick was wirewalking decades before Nik was born. Rick has a sweet spot on his head, like his grandfather. And, with Tallulah Gorge still unclaimed by Karl's heirs, Rick goes off the record when discussing family disputes.\n\nBut when asked about Nik's impact on the family brand with a camera rolling, Rick springs into full performance mode and, like a true Wallenda, nails it in one take:\n\n\"I think it has been a positive effect on not just us, but wherever we work . . . People are attracted to us now. They want to have a Wallenda on their show or event, and maybe Nik's not available. Maybe he's unaffordable. They go to us . . . We kept the name up there and Nik just gave it a big blast. It's great. We're happy about it.\"\n\nCut."
