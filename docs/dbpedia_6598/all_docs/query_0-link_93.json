        "text": "Bio\n\nStephen was born near Newcastle, England, and grew up in Scotland where his parents were also involved with GFA in church-planting. The family returned to the US in 1978 for health reasons. Stephen studied Bible at Bob Jones University, History at the University of Alabama, and International Studies at Old Dominion University.\n\nMarcy was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, but lived most of her life in Virginia where her father was a pastor. She studied Business at Pensacola Christian College. Steve and Marcy met in Alabama where both fathers were then pastoring churches. They were married in 1991 and have three children-Kenneth, Ian, and Anne.\n\nAfter teaching History and English for several years, Stephen felt the Lord calling him into the ministry. Stephen and Marcy joined with GFA in 1996 and left for Scotland in 1998.\n\nCurrently, they are ministering at Eyemouth Baptist Church, the only independent Baptist church in the Scottish Borders.\n\nIn addition to a full schedule of weekly services, their ministry includes an after-school children's Bible club, ladies' and men's fellowship meetings, youth activities, participation in the religious assembly program in several local state schools, involvement with local community groups and organizations, and personal visitation.\n\nTo view Steve and Marcy Bender's photo gallery, click the picture below."
