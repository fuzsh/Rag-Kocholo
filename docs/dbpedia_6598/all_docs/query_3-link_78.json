        "text": "Rodd has concentrated on brownfield transactions and compliance counseling across a variety of regulatory programs since joining the firm in 1997. He has extensive experience structuring environmental due diligence for real estate and business transactions, negotiating environmental provisions in transactional documents, and advising developers on satisfying state and federal cleanup programs and property transfer laws consistent with business objectives. For brownfield projects Rodd has negotiated environmental insurance policies and agency liability protection agreements, and counseled clients on public involvement strategies.\n\nIn the regulatory compliance arena, Rodd has advised and provided training to companies on complex regulatory programs such as hazardous waste management, release and right-to-know reporting, storage tank operations and corrective action, spill prevention and countermeasures, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) use and cleanups, asbestos workplace standards, and stormwater permitting. He has provided legal oversight for regulatory compliance audits of multi-facility clients, both confidentially and involving disclosure to and negotiation of reduced penalties with federal and state agencies under voluntary disclosure policies. Rodd has also represented clients to resolve agency enforcement actions alleging violations of regulatory requirements.\n\nOutside the office, Rodd enjoys taking road trips with his wife, following the extracurricular exploits of their teenage son and tween daughter, and riding the highs and lows of Philadelphia’s professional sports teams. Whenever possible, he also continues his quest for a respectable golf handicap.\n\nRodd has represented clients in matters such as the following:\n\nRodd has counseled clients in the chemical, energy, transportation, communications, real estate development, and other sectors, and collaborated with environmental consultants and Licensed Site Remediation Professionals, to manage environmental due diligence efforts, negotiate environmental provisions in transactional agreements, and satisfy site remediation requirements for sites in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and other locations, including pursuant to state brownfield cleanup programs and real property transfer laws such as the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act.\n\nHe counsels a national metals recycling company on various federal and state environmental regulatory requirements, with a particular focus on hazardous waste management. Rodd’s work for this client has included providing legal oversight for internal compliance audits, preparing responses to agency information requests, and negotiating the resolution of enforcement actions.\n\nFor over a decade, he advised a real estate development client on the remediation and redevelopment of a former industrial site in a rapidly gentrifying Philadelphia neighborhood. Rodd worked closely with the development team and environmental consultant to integrate business objectives and legal requirements under both the Pennsylvania Land Recycling (Act 2) voluntary cleanup program and the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulations for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) remediations. As part of this project, Rodd helped to structure and participated in several public engagement meetings with interested stakeholders.\n\nRodd coordinated environmental due diligence efforts and negotiated the environmental provisions of transactional documents in a client’s acquisition and redevelopment of a mothballed Pennsylvania manufacturing facility into a modern industrial park. This effort included working with the former owners and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to develop institutional controls and soil management requirements allowing the client flexibility to perform excavation and on-site soil reuse activities as part of extensive renovations to the facility.\n\nHe has drafted and negotiated consent orders and agreements with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to provide cleanup liability protection in the context of remediating and redeveloping several Pennsylvania brownfield sites. These documents have included both Buyer-Seller Agreements and Special Industrial Area Agreements, and Rodd has represented both property buyers and sellers in these matters.\n\nFor a healthcare client, Rodd provided legal oversight in environmental compliance audits of a hospital and multiple outpatient facilities. Activities included advising the client on retaining an outside auditing firm, evaluating audit findings, and providing legal advice on regulatory compliance issues.\n\nHe assisted a commercial client in its acquisition of a Delaware brownfield property with groundwater contamination and located adjacent to a Superfund site. For this matter, Rodd coordinated environmental due diligence activities and met with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) to structure a process under which the client received cleanup liability protection in redeveloping the property as a regional distribution center while the seller remediated the property. To implement this strategy, Rodd negotiated contract provisions and an environmental escrow agreement providing for the seller’s remediation pursuant to a DNREC consent decree, a Brownfield Development Agreement between the client and DNREC, and an environmental insurance policy.\n\nRodd has written articles on a variety of environmental subjects for publications including the Legal Intelligencer, Association of Corporate Counsel’s Green-House Counsel, and the Mid Atlantic Real Estate Journal. Some topics have included voluntary cleanup programs, green leasing, hazardous waste management, lender liability, and audit policy disclosures. For several years he co-authored the Pennsylvania chapter in Brownfields Law and Practice: The Cleanup and Redevelopment of Contaminated Land, published by LexisNexis. Rodd also authored the updated chapter on legal considerations in the ninth edition of Environmental Health and Safety Audits published by Government Institutes.\n\nRodd has presented to industry audiences and for continuing legal education programs on topics such as brownfield redevelopment, environmental permitting in real estate projects, environmental issues for the construction industry and commercial and industrial real estate brokers, green leasing, environmental auditing, lender environmental liability protections, hazardous and residual waste management, and storage tank regulatory requirements and litigation. He served as course planner and presenter for “Due Diligence in Real Estate and Business Transactions,” a CLE course presented by the Pennsylvania Bar Institute in Spring 2013.\n\nAt the firm, Rodd has been extensively involved in the website and technology committees, and been an active member of the hiring committee.\n\nBefore joining the firm, Rodd served as a law clerk for the Honorable William T. Moore, Jr., U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. Prior to his legal career, Rodd was an analyst for the environment and health systems group of American Management Systems, Inc., in Arlington, Virginia, performing program analysis and support for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\"EPA Rule on Solid and Hazardous Waste: Enforcement and Compliance With 83 Fed.
