        "text": "This article originally appeared in the September 1996 issue of Esquire, written by pioneering political journalist Richard Ben Cramer. You can read every story ever published in Esquire on Esquire Classic.\n\nIt’s summertime, and the Bobster’s still snappin’ his jaws, trying to sink his teeth into the Big Issue. He’s tried Red-Ink Budgets. (S’about arr chillren, ’nar GRANN-chillren!) Chinese Commies. (Agh, gotta live with ‘em.) And Star Wars. (Y’want me to be Reagan, I, um—what was I saying?) … He’s tried Crime. (He’s against it.) Hollywood. (He’s against that, too.) Abortion. (He’s against it—but can’t we all, uhh, get along?) And Taxes. (Cut ’em! The hell with grannchillren!)\n\nHe’s been doing this so long, he’s gone through multiple incarnations of himself … Dole as the GOP Patton (three-star general out there in the mud and smoke, hustling the tanks over the Democrat Rhine) … Dole as the lone adult supervisor at the D.C. daycare (Good news: A group of Republican freshmen booked a fact-finding mission on Valujet. Bad news: A couple of seats were empty)…. There was Majority Leader Dole as the last pillar of the Statesman-Senate. (You know, as Ev Dirksen used to say...) Then there was Plain American Dole, baking in the Charlotte Speedway pits with Richard Petty. (Citizen Bobster always Armor Alls his tires.)\n\nAnd that was just this year.\n\nFor those of us odd and old enough to have acquired early our taste for Doles, there is still, touching down on our personal tarmacs, the Horatio Bobster of ’88 (I’m one of you!) … the right-winger-without-hair-dye of ’80 (Y’lookin for a younger Ronna Reagan? Here I am!) … and (my personal favorite) from ’76, the long-sideburned, lapels-like-aircraft-carrier-decks, squinty-eyed, hard-assed Bobster-as-Veep, who flung himself about the heartland, rasping out the message (Whip Inflation Now!) for God, country, and Jerry Ford.\n\nBy placing his life so long in our view, Bob Dole has put us all in the scientifically privileged place of the herpetologist who has nailed all the molted skins of his favorite snake up on the reptile-house wall. It is pleasing to see that each is larger than the next … each retaining, though old and hollow now, that tailored-to-the-moment shape—just the shape the Bobster thought he needed to slide through the hole, to swallow the mouse. And it’s impressive, too, how much skin he’s shed for us—tribute to his vitality, all these tubes of his old self, graying, translucent … you could put them together, thread them one into the other—there’s appearance of fullness, but even when you add it up…\n\nThe herpetologists know: It’s all just skin. Where is the heart of the Bobster?\n\nBob Dole on the 1996 campaign trail, running for President.\n\nRussell, Kansas, is one of those towns that never could molt and replace themselves with something larger ... despite the dreams of its founders (Fossil Station—so it was named—was supposed to rival Denver and K.C. as the hub of commerce for the high plains) ... despite the discovery of oil beneath the wheat fields (in ’23, just as Bob Dole was born) ... despite the strange and impressive fact that, in our day, it’s the only town that raised two members of the U.S. Senate (Dole and Arlen Spector, now of Pennsylvania). Still, Russell never got a decent airport, or more than one ramp off the interstate; never got a federal building, or anything more than a five-man Ag office. In Russell, no one ever built a shopping mall, or any condos, not one housing tract. The endless flat fields still arrive with the wind, near Bob’s old house on the west edge of town, and pick up again, where they always have, behind the last houses on the last street, twelve blocks east of the highway.\n\nIt’s a plain town, which in that part of Kansas passes near enough for a compliment. Plain bespeaks candor and a lack of airs. It’s a good word you can add in, to show there’s nothing fancy-pants going on ... like, “Around here, he’s just Plain Bob” ... which is what people in Russell still say, if they can get away with it—say, if the reporters are from New York, or Sweden, and can’t be expected to know any better. There’s another word, flat—that’s good, too. That’s what people in Russell say when they want to talk to you: “You come by for coffee, and we’ll just flat visit.”\n\n(I remember old Adolf Reisig, one of Bob’s Russell High classmates, telling a story about Bob’s latest presidential announcement. Adolf stood at the back with a sign: CLASS OF ’41. Except it wasn’t a big class in the first place, and a lot of those kids had passed away already, so all Adolf could round up was just one farm boy, Henry Bender, and old Laverne Becker in his wheelchair. And by and by, Adolf got the queasy feeling that maybe Bob wouldn’t want it advertised that he got out of high school fifty-four years ago, much less that there were so few classmates who weren’t, you know, uh, dead ... so Adolf was feeling sort of sheepish, till Bob stood up, saw the sign and the three cronies, and he made a face and blurted into the mike, “Aughh! Zzat all that’s LEFT?” Adolf, telling the story later, shook his head in admiration and remarked: “Now, isn’t that just flat Bob?”)\n\nThe peculiar thing is, you can’t just flat visit in Russell anymore, because, as billboards announce on the interstate, THIS IS THE HOME OF BOB DOLE. And what with Bob going to be president, maybe this time, or at least he’s one of two guys in the country who’ve got a chance ... and if he makes it, of course there’s bound to be a museum or something, like Abilene’s got for Ike, and gift shops, and a real hotel, and they’ll finally have to build an airport, or maybe use the old air base (that’s what they figure at the Chamber of Commerce) ... and anyway, everybody wants to help, having grown up, so to speak, in the Bob Dole industry ... there’s sort of a civic duty to talk up Russell, not just as a plain town, but to talk about the kind of place it is—you know, about its decency: hardworking folks, old-fashioned, poor but honest, plainspoken, midwestern, or even all-American.\n\nIt’s gotten so you can’t say anything nice about a person in Russell without that person, or one of his friends, pointing out: “Well, that’s how folks are here.” Of course, the subtext is: That’s how Bob is, too!... It’s as if they feel the town as a whole must embody the virtues of the Bob Dole persona, the values at the heart of the Bob Dole message (if the Bobster may be said to have a message) ... it’s like they wrote on the banner they strung across Main Street in 1980, when Bob announced he was going to be president: IT ALL BEGAN IN RUSSELL! Of course, they brought that banner back in ’88, and they still had it last year in the attic over Bob’s old drugstore … but what the heck, it didn’t get any less true.\n\nDole has been doing this so long, he’s gone through multiple incarnations of himself—four just this year.\n\nThe fact is, to go back to when you could just flat visit, you’d have to go back before they made that banner—before the Bobster started announcing here, every eight years, regular as a church clock. You’d have to go back two full decades—twenty years almost to the day—to the last day of the Republican Convention of ’76, the Heartland Convention, at the Kemper Arena in Kansas City. That’s when Jerry Ford made Bob Dole his choice for veep ... and the Bobster was so amazed and grateful, so totally pumped up, that he accepted with one breath, and with the next he invited President Ford to begin the campaign in the real heartland—with an old-fashioned barbecue in Russell, Kansas, the very next day.\n\nOf course, that was easy for Bob to say, but Russell almost went into a seizure: The President of the United States was coming—twenty hours from now!... And they had to get seats for the courthouse lawn, and bleachers, a stage, and a PA, and new phone lines for the onslaught of traveling press; and they had to bring in cops from a hundred miles, put sharpshooters on the rooftops, and resupply the president’s blood type at the closest hospital; and they had to haul in stock tanks to ice down ten thousand sodas, and a hundred Republican ladies had to bring their backyard grills—they bought out the hot dogs from four towns around—and the bakery in Hutchinson had to put on a special midnight shift for buns; and the radio station went to live remote from the courthouse lawn, and Russ Townsley, the editor, was up all night on his Bob Dole Commemorative Issue of the Russell Daily News, which hit the streets next day with the banner headline BOMBSHELL HITS RUSSELL…. So there wasn’t time to think about values, the town, or the kind of place it was. And the nation got that one quick look at Russell the way it always had been—sort of like Margaret Mead found the Samoans—in innocence, you could say.\n\nBob Dole at the 1976 Republican National Convention, where he was nominated as the party’s candidate for Vice President.\n\nBut the way it worked out, it was perfect, because when Bob and Jerry Ford took the stage, along with Bob’s mom, Bina, and his new wife, Elizabeth, and the Russell High School Bronco Band had played its new rendition of “Hail to the Chief,” and Bob got introduced to cheers, then he stood up at the microphone and looked out at his home folks.... And ten thousand souls packed Russell that day—everyone who really knew him was there—stretching from the courthouse, where he used to work, to the street, where the firemen had parked their new engine, the Doran Dole, named after his dad, who’d been a volunteer firefighter in this town for fifty years.... His dad had died just months before—it would have been his birthday, the day Bob got the nomination—and what would Doran have thought, to see his son and his town now?... And what could Bob think, as he saw the town that gave him life when he came home, more than half-dead, from the war ... and the townsfolk, who’d pitched their nickels and dimes into cigar boxes on every store counter so they could save up to pay for Bob’s operations? He was their product, their project, their hope—and now, perhaps, that all could be made good….\n\n“I am proof,” Dole told the crowd, “that you can be from a small town, without a lot of material advantages, and still succeed—if I have succeeded. If I have had any success, it is because of the people here.... I can recall the time when I needed help ... and the people of Russell helped.” Then he stopped speaking, and his left hand came up to hide his eyes. He was crying—and no one had seen that before. No one knew what to do. Elizabeth wanted to go to him—but not onstage! The silence was awful. Bob could not stop crying. ... And then, at last, Jerry Ford stood up, and he began to clap. And ten thousand people stood in front of Dole, clapping, cheering ... until Bob could look up again, and he said, in a croak that was nearly a whisper: “That was a long time ago ... and I thank you for it.”\n\nWell, you could see in an instant: This place and the life it held—this was the heart of Bob Dole. You could see, for that matter, that he had a heart, something tender at his center ... and how close it was to the tough-guy surface, how much it meant to him—how much he wanted to make good, do good.\n\nYou could see, without another word said, why Dole was out there, running so hard.... Of course, that was twenty years ago, and the Bobster was sort of an innocent Samoan, too.\n\nLet’s take a minute to explode the biggest lie of American politics.\n\nEsquire’s September 1996 cover.\n\nIt is a lie so sadly infantile that it must embarrass any patriot. It is a fairy tale—Disneyesque in its simplistic correctness and drawing-card power.... No, it’s worse—it’s Fulghumesque (we should have learned about it in kindergarten).... It is a lie so beguiling, withal, that every four years it causes the smart, middle-aged, Ivy League–trained skeptics who people the American press corps (such tough guys!) to curl up on their blankies in a thumb-sucking swoon, like preschoolers at nap time.\n\nIt is the Vision Thing.\n\nThis fairy tale holds that intelligent, successful, superhumanly vigorous and telegenic men run for president because they have seen a Shining City on the Hill … and this Inner Knowledge of all that America could be (complete, of course, in its visionhood, down to the depreciation schedules for timber assets and what we should do about the WIC program and nuclear nonproliferation in Korea) propels them to seek the nation’s highest office, to make that dream come true.\n\nThat’s not how it happens.\n\nWhat happens is that these men—who are, in truth, smart, winning, and forceful—get themselves, by their midadulthoods, into positions in politics (or, more rarely, in the military or big business) where they can meet, and maybe even size up, the president of the moment. And when that happens, then a president is no longer, in their minds, an immensity, an icon, a superhuman (or a visionary) ... then a president is a guy like them, who happens to hold a job of immense power, prestige, and challenge. And some morning, when these type A’s are shaving, they see in the mirror a guy who could maybe do that job himself—or probably (with a little luck, if the tide is right, if the money can be raised . . .) get there just as ably and acquit himself every bit as well as that guy in the Oval Office right now—or even better than the VP who means to succeed him ... hell, surely better than that schmuck!\n\nSo they dip a baby toe in the water—maybe talk to a couple of guys, see if it’s worth puttin’ the wife on alert—and if nobody says a discouraging word (take that back: it’s more like, if nobody threatens to shoot them), then they’re already in the rondo, the exploratory dance.... That means they’re talking to the money guys. (Well, that’s only half the amount they had in mind, but they could prob’ly still make it, you know, if they won early, then the money would just pour in—right?)... And they’re trying to line up consultants—message gurus, ad mavens, pollsters, and general wiseguys. (Gotta get some big names—adds to the credibility.)... And they’ve got to line up major-league talent for Iowa and New Hampshire. (Those early states are crucial now, what with money so tight.)... And they ought to sit down with some bigfoot press—just quietly, off the record, maybe dinner in Washington—to float the balloon, see if anybody’s gonna shoot it down.... And the press guys are already asking the Big One—Yes or no: Are you in or out? And the money guys need a decision, too, because no one wants to bankroll a candidacy that doesn’t happen. And consultants need a horse to ride—no one makes money on a horse that’s scratched before he gets to the gate. And the same goes double for those Iowa and New Hampshire guys, who won’t even talk unless you’re in. (Hey! Wake up! It’s their reputations on the line here, too!)...\n\nSo, everybody’s pushing, in or out—mostly in—till it gets to the point where you’re a chickenhearted geek (ridiculous!) unless you do it.... C’mon, c’mon!... There’s so many people invested now. Hell, you’re invested, too—you’ve been flying around like a dork for months, fought it through with the wife, already told your kids how this is the Most Important Job on Earth.... So what’s it gonna be? Let’s go! Let’s go!\n\nAnd if you do go—if you say yes once—then the rondo goes to warp speed in a hurry (it’s got to, or they’ll write that you’re stalled, and you’re dead). . . and you’ve got ninety-nine counties to visit, just in Iowa, and clambakes in New Hampshire, and barbecues all over the South, and governors to line up (or bigwigs of some stripe, in fifty states—gotta show momentum!), and unions if you’re a Democrat, or Bible-thumpers for Republicans, blacks and Chicanos, Jews who have to talk about Israel, Cubans hablando de Castro in Miami, and money and money and money and money (hey, the ads got to go up—your opponents are already on the air!) ... and you can’t stop—you stop, you’re dead—because you gotta show the ball getting pushed over the hump, you have to show movement in the polls—you’ve got to show you can win, at least in straw polls, or maybe state conventions, or primaries (it’s your neck now!), and now the networks are watching, and the money goes south unless you show you can get there—you’re the big dog!\n\nAnd things go great (they tell you you’re doing great), and you make it work, or at least not crumble, by spreading yourself, thin as Pam on a fry pan, all over the country; you flew a quarter-million miles, worked the phones every night, and kept the money coming, made a lot of promises, and took out three or four opponents (used to be your friends) with hatchet attacks in the debates, and managed to clean the blood from your face just in time for the next weekend’s Sunday shows; and at least you haven’t lost, though you can’t quite remember what state you’re in or where your family is today, but, hey! Did you see that headline? Said you could win! Said you could get there!… Said you’re the man to beat!... Jesus! People are starting to believe!\n\nThen they start asking about your vision.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Bob Dole holds a press conference outside of the IRS, 1966.\n\nWhen Bob Dole got to Congress, in 1960, it felt as if he’d died and gone to heaven. People were holding doors for him—the county attorney from Russell, Kansas (at least that’s what he’d been, the day before). And then there was the salary—$432.69 every week... which was a pretty good jump from $248 a month, as county attorney. (Hell, the courthouse janitor, Leroy Foote, made $260.)\n\nBut nothing told Bob he’d made the leap like that bus trip—the whole freshman class of Congress, on a bus ride through Maryland and into Pennsylvania, to Gettysburg, the battlefield ... and Bob, the new president of the freshman class, had to present the group to their tour guide ... who was the president of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nCriminy! Ike!...\n\nThis was an Olympian, the conquering hero, who’d been invitedto take over the Oval Office for the GOP—after twenty years of Democratic rule. And to Bob Dole, Ike was even larger—he was the Supreme Commander for whom Lieutenant R. Dole had almost given his life, in Europe, fifteen years before. Now here he was, shaking hands … kind of awkwardly, Ike with his right hand and Bob with his left … and Bob knew, of course, that underneath, Ike was just a man—came from Kansas!—he’d even worked in a creamery, like the one Dole’s dad ran for so many years in Russell. But this was the President, and Bob hardly knew what to say. Wouldn’t say much of anything—or even ask a question—while Ike talked on about Gettysburg. Ike had lived up there, and he’d studied the battle at West Point. And anyway, this was a place where the nation’s fate had hung in the balance—wasn’t for Bob to talk about … the kind of thing presidents do.\n\nThe things Bob talked about pretty much ended at the borders of his district (which seemed big enough—the western half of Kansas). It was mostly ag stuff, or helping out here and there with small business. Every once in a while, he’d nose into some larger policy—federal aid to education or something else that had effect in Kansas. But he wasn’t much for grand policy pronunciamentos—Bear Any Burden, Pay Any Price—that was Jack Kennedy’s stock-in-trade, and Bob wasn’t quite ready for Camelot.\n\nWhen he got invited, with the other freshmen, for dinner and dancing at the Kennedy White House, Bob didn’t even know if he should go. Was he s’posed to have dinner with Democrats? Bob had never worn black tie in his life—what if a picture got back to Kansas? Wouldn’t look good—he was sure of that. Still, JFK was the president of the United States, and Bob wouldn’t say no. He rented a tux (seven bucks—had to get it back the next day), and with his wife, Phyllis, in her homemade dress, he walked past the ranks of saluting marines, up the stairway, into the grand foyer.... And it was exciting. Bob and Phyllis stood around with the other big-eyed Kansans. When a sudden silence fell and the Marine band struck up “Hail to the Chief,” the Doles and the others took one or two instinctive steps back as the president and Mrs. Kennedy swept into the room. They did look glorious, amid the music, in a swirl of greetings, laughter.... Bob got only a quick handshake in a hallway—JFK was being called away, in a hurry. That was the night of the Bay of Pigs—the awful stuff presidents deal with.\n\nIt didn’t escape Dole’s notice, of course, that Kennedy was of his generation—one of the boys who fought the war (not the old men who planned it). Still, Dole could never feel any kinship or connection there—not with Kennedy’s money, his Harvard polish, the way he traded on his family connections. Dole thought Dick Nixon should have won in ’60 (thought he would have won if Daley and the other bosses hadn’t voted all their dead friends).... Nixon was the man who’d been at Ike’s side for eight years—a loyal vice-president, he’d paid his dues. And Nixon was a man Dole could feelwith: He’d grown up poor on a farm in California.... Story was, in the bad-dust days, the family made it through the week eating ketchup—nothing under it, just ketchup…. Bob understood very well. Dole saw strength in Nixon: Life had knocked him down, but Nixon was too tough to stay down. He saw grace in the way Nixon treated him: When Dole came to Washington, Nixon was the only one who stuck out his left hand to shake with Bob. And in ’64, amid the Goldwater debacle, when Nixon came to Kansas to help Bob’s reelection, Dole saw political brilliance, too.\n\nPratt, Kansas—sunshine, a big day, a hell of a crowd.... Nixon stood on a bale of hay and delivered a gorgeous speech for Bob. Nixon knew the issues in Kansas almost as well as Bob knew them himself. He knew the leaders in the state, down to the county chairmen—he knew the people! And it wasn’t just Kansas. Bob flew east aboard Nixon’s plane (Nixon was on his way to Herbert Hoover’s funeral), and wherever Nixon looked down, he knew the leaders, the candidates, and their situations. He had the political map of the nation instantly at his command! (He had briefing books, too—Bob didn’t know about briefing books yet. But the fact was, Nixon read his books. The man was a pro.) It was Nixon who asked Bob about his plans—was he interested in moving up to the Senate? (Bob said, Sure! You represent the whole state—don’t have to run but every six years!)\n\nAnd that shifted Bob’s own map of his future. It wasn’t just him—his pipe dreams about a Senate seat. Nixon thought it was possible! He’d like to see it happen! The former vice-president of the United States was interested!... And the way it worked out, four years later—that was perfect. When Senator Carlson announced his retirement, and Bob filed (that same day!)... and Bob beat a former governor in the primary and swept on to victory ... that was the moment of Nixon’s triumph, too. Bob was going to the Senate, to deal with the fate of the nation—kind of stuff presidents think about … and for the first time, that man in the White House—Bob knew him. The President! That was his friend!\n\nRichard Nixon and Bob Dole pose in the Oval Office, 1973.\n\nAnd it wasn’t long after that Bob was going back to his friend’s house—his young Senate staff would buzz about it all day: “Senator’s going to the White House! President wants to see him!”... And in the Senate, Bob carried water for Nixon—he defended the president against every attack (sometimes even imagined attacks). White House envelopes with red tags (Urgent!) would arrive at Dole’s office—a speech for the president!—and Bob would march off to the Senate floor to deliver the word ... the president needed him! And when Nixon needed reelection help (or his palace guard thought he needed help), then Bob Dole became the chairman of the party, who’d fly west every night, rushing to some dinner of the faithful, to deliver the word, to speak for the president…. It almost killed him.\n\nHis life—all politics—put paid to his marriage. Phyllis barely saw him, and when she did, they had nothing to say. When Watergate spilled open like a bad melon, Dole was the one who brought it up at the White House. He thought the party had to say something—address it! He never did get an answer ... but after that he was suspect with the Nixon crowd. He lost his party job. Less than two years later, he almost lost his own Senate seat when his opponent in Kansas tarred him with Watergate. Nixon was gone, and Dole had to claw for survival.... It was ’74, and Bob Dole had seen the presidency from the inside.\n\nThe new man in the White House was Gerald Ford. He was Dole’s coeval and his old colleague in the House—when Ford had made his bid to become Republican leader, it was Bob Dole and Kansas that put Jerry over the top. They knew each other as equals and friends—Ford, who was trying to soothe the country, and Dole, who was trying to rebuild his life. When Dole came back to Washington and started working on his new persona, and he reached across the aisle, for the first time, to build the food-stamp program, it was his friend Jerry Ford who signed the bill into law. When Dole found a new wife—a Washington woman who lived as he did—he stopped at the White House on the way to the wedding so he and Elizabeth could have their picture made with the president. Well, with Jerry ... sometimes it was hard to call him Mr. President.\n\nAnd in ’76, when Ford and Dole lost—by two points!—then Bob knew he could do it. It was a bitter campaign; Bob had to carry the attack. Maybe he made enemies in his debate (they told him he did—“Democrat wars!” ), but he hit his marks—he won every state assigned to him (except for Missouri … and he was sure the Democrats stole that in the cities). It was a bitter loss (there were some in the press who were blaming him! ) ... he was ill, exhausted—he even took three days off. When he got back to the office, his old staffer Bill Taggart asked him: “Well, think you’ll run for national office again?”\n\n“Not for four years,” Dole said.\n\nBut he was on a plane that same week. There was a dinner in South Dakota—he’d promised—then a stop in Illinois ... and he was in the dance.\n\nHow could he know, in his case, the rondo would last for twenty years?\n\nBob Dole and Gerald Ford in the White House, 1976.\n\nAt its heart, a good campaign is a good story. You’re creating a persona for the voters—someone they can believe in, someone who looks solid, makes sense. Voters don’t vote on your five-point plan for Bosnia. They vote on you. They like you or they don’t. There’s something about you they can get with—or they can’t. And that something-about-you is your person, itself.\n\nThere’s a good and sufficient reason for this: We voters ain’t as dumb as we look ... and all of us know that there’s no way to tell what a president will face in the next four years. It doesn’t pay to listen too hard to what a candidate is making speeches about—the point is, do we like to hear speeches from this guy or not? (On one subject or another, the president will address us.) The point is, we’re going to pay this poor bastard to face some skin-flaying horror shows for us—we have to get a sense of who he is and how he does things. What he says his presidency is going to be about—well, that’s interesting, mostly, for what that says about him.\n\n(Take Bill Clinton, for example: He ran in ’92 on three big issues—a middle-class tax cut, health care for everyone, and Change in America. Well, the middle-class tax cut, he never did that. The health-care mega-plan went down in flames. The only thing he changed was his mind.)\n\nOf course, we want a candidate to have ideas—that’s important for us to know about him, that he has ideas. We don’t want too many—two or three big ones. The most popular president of our era was Ronald Reagan, who had only three ideas in his life: cut taxes, spend a fortune on defense, starve the rest of the government into submission. Reagan ran on those ideas, got elected, tried to do them. They were idiotic ideas, but we loved the guy. They made sense with him.\n\nWhen Dole came to Washington, Richard Nixon was the only one who stuck out his left hand to shake with Bob.\n\nSee, the important thing about the ideas is that they come right out of who this guy is (or in Reagan’s case, who he played in the movies). They have to reinforce the story, which is the persona, which is the campaign.\n\nNow, in the Bobster’s case, there was a problem: The persona we knew, or thought we knew, was Bob Dole the Senator—Senate Leader, Senate Lion, Senator Forever. So what’s the idea?... Let’s hold hearings?\n\nThat’s why he had to get out of the Senate (and show himself wiping the Capitol dust off his shoes)—to go back to his pre-Senate, pre-Congress persona ... all the way back to Russell, Kansas ... where there was the life that propelled him to Washington in the first place ... where (here’s the good news) he has a great story of our age.\n\nIt’s a story of sacrifice, faith, endurance, and triumph over hardship. It shows him to be brave, decent, smart, optimistic, titanium-tough.... It’s a story redolent of the best American values—all true!—and, alas, a story the Bobster has never learned to tell.\n\nMoreover, it’s a story that spawns three big ideas. They come right out of his life in Russell—they make sense with him…. This is what a Bob Dole candidacy should be about:\n\nDebt—the deficit. This isn’t something Dole talks about because the polls show it’s an issue with voters. Bobby Joe Dole grew up in the Depression, Dust Bowl days, when the sky would grow black and the dust covered everything—houses, tractors, trees.... The crops died, cattle died, land wasn’t worth a damn (who’d buy it?) ... and Bob grew up watching neighbors literally die from debt. There was a farmer in Gorham who went to the bank, and the bank turned him down. So he herded his cattle to a corner of the corral and shot them, one after another. Then he shot himself.... A fellow in town named Krug lost hope and hanged himself up in his attic. Doc White got the call and rushed over, but all he could do was hold the man’s legs while his daughters cut him down.... Bob Dole knew about all this as a boy. In Russell, there wasn’t any way not to know.\n\nPerfectionism. This goes back, in fact, to Bina Dole, Bob’s mother, who may not have done some things, but what she did—everything she did—had to be just so. The woman would wash and wax her front porch. She’d wax her garbage cans!... With Dole, this goes to his whole life’s method. With his wounded arm, there are things he can’t do. But everything he does—his bills, his letters, his press releases, his tie—must be perfect. So if you’re a Republican, determined to cut taxes and programs, let this be the watchword: Take the government out of four thousand of the five thousand things it tries to do ... but those things it tries, let it try with massive force—and perfectly.\n\nEverybody’s included. This is a beauty of Russell—everybody in that town has been through woe together. Everybody’s been broke, sometime. Everybody’s pitched in. There are no divisions that mean a darn thing—all in the same boat. And the greatest political moments for Dole have been about this idea. He’s never more compelling as a speaker than when he gets going on this. I’ve seen him tell a group of the worst yahoo Young Republicans that he’d like to see among them more people in wheelchairs, more black and brown faces, Asians, Latins, Indians ... to my amazement, all these pink YRs jumped up and started cheering! And it’s not just about the benefits—it’s the cost of America, too: Everybody’s included. When Dole (he’s the only guy who ever actually tried this) proposed a bill that would have killed off the deficit, he did it on this simple principle—everybody took a little hit. He got guys in the Senate to make the votes that no one would touch—social security, ag subsidies, the Pentagon ... and he actually got the damn thing passed! (Jack Kemp screwed it up in the House, Reagan waffled, and that was the end of that. But it worked when Dole talked about it—everybody’s included!)\n\nPresident Reagan speaks with House and Senate leaders, 1986.\n\nNow, there’s one inconvenient fact that must be mentioned in the same breath with these splendid ideas: Bob Dole hasn’t actually talked about this stuff (or told these stories) in his campaign. He’s got the notion of his persona—it was his idea to leave the Senate, and he carried that off in fine style—but he hasn’t moved on to the corollary, that the issues of his campaign have to come from the life he wants us to see.\n\nAnd so, just after he left the Senate (in that crucial moment when everyone was watching), his instinct was right: He lit out for the country. And his label was right: It was the Heartland Tour. But he didn’t go to the real heartland—not Russell, Kansas; he went to cities, to Louisville, Kansas City, Baton Rouge, and when the press asked him what it was about, Dole (as is his habit) told the truth, not wisely, but too well:\n\n“Agh, we’re trying to get good pictures. Don’t worry very much about what I say.”\n\nIn the best memoir of our century, Speak Memory, by Vladimir Nabokov, the author complains that he has given away crucial bits of his life to fictional personae.\n\n“I have often noticed that after I had bestowed on the characters of my novels some treasured item of my past, it would pine away in the artificial world in which I had so abruptly placed it. Although it lingered on in my mind, its personal warmth, its retrospective appeal had gone and, presently, it became more closely identified with my novel than with my former self....”\n\nSomething like that has happened to the poor Bobster. In the effort to create the personae of so many campaigns over so many years, he has given away the things of his life—put them into campaigns, where they pine. They exist still, in fact, but they do not burn in him with the hot urgency of untold, pent truth. They’re stories about some character ... that used to be him.\n\nBob Dole went to Russell, Kansas—the home of that character—once this year. It was the end of March, after he won the California primary, and he had the nomination locked up. At that point, he said, he wanted to come home.\n\nHis is a great story of our age, redolent of the best American values. Alas, the Bobster has never learned to tell it.\n\nI went out a day early, through a hellacious snowstorm, because I wanted to talk to the people who knew Dole best. I went to see Bob’s sister Gloria, but she was on her way out to the old house, to have a talk with The Philadelphia Inquirer. I did have a sit-down with Adolf Reisig—he was the boy who’d made the leaden brace for Bob’s wounded arm after the war. Adolf showed me his folder of press clips, all about him and Bob. I went to just flat visit at the home of the old newspaperman, Russ Townsley ... but Russ was busy. He’d become a pretty good advance man, after all of Bob’s announcements, and with the snowstorm he had to switch tomorrow’s Bob Dole Rally indoors, into the high school gym, and in a hurry. “Yeah, it’s everything, inside,” he was barking into a cell phone. “It’s okay. Give us capacity for a balloon drop....”\n\nThe gym was already getting full next day, a good couple of hours before Bob’s plane touched down. The Russell High Bronco Band was entertaining, with the cheerleaders up onstage, and the kids from the classrooms filed in to fill up the middle of the floor. There were seats for townspeople in bleachers on both sides, but most people milled around visiting, or spent some time in the chilly lunch line. (Hot dogs for everyone—a restaurant did the catering.) Bill Graves, the governor of Kansas, was there, along with the congressman Pat Roberts and Bob’s fellow senator Nancy Kassebaum … but they wouldn’t say a word till Bob’s plane landed (twenty-five miles away in Hays) and they could bus the whole road show in….\n\nDole and his wife, Elizabeth, at a campaign stop in Kansas, 1996.\n\nAll of a sudden, there he was, onstage (as always, things started the minute Bob got there), with Elizabeth and his daughter, Robin.... He was waving to friends, bouncing on the balls of his feet, swinging his good arm to the music, bringin’ on the action!... And the people of Russell pressed in through every door, until the seats were filled and the floor was impassable ... and five thousand cheers seemed to drive the cold air back outside—made the gym warm and close as a kitchen.\n\nAnd as always, he was talking before they could quiet down. “To this place, and to you, I owe so much. The Russell of my youth was not wealthy. Yet it was generous with the values that shaped me and the compassion that restored me. All my life, I have tried to repay those gifts....”\n\nNow it was very quiet, save for the photographers’ shutters clicking and the Bobster’s prairie voice, which filled the warm air.\n\n“In fact, anyone who wants to understand me must first understand Russell.\n\n“It was here I learned that doing was better than talking. ... It was here I learned not to wear my heart on my sleeve. But I also learned to feel deeply for my country and my family—that some things are worth living for ... and dying for. These lessons left their mark on me.\n\n“I am a plainspoken Kansan, but I found my philosophy in the poetry of America. I certainly have limitations, but I will never apologize for who I am. Because I am one of you. And I consider that one of the privileges of my life....”\n\nDole tried to list the things that Russell meant to him: love of God and country and family; commitment to honesty, decency, and personal responsibility; self-reliance tempered by a sense of community.... “If we are to restore America’s greatness, our people must reaffirm those values. And our government must reflect them. We need families who will nurture them. Judges who will uphold them. Schools that will teach them. And an economy that will reward them....”\n\nHe said that’s why he was running—the generations to come deserve an America like he had. He asked for the prayers of the people of Russell. He said in times of crisis or decision, it was their voices he would always hear.\n\nAt the end, people wouldn’t stop cheering ... clapping, yelling Bob’s name, all the way through the balloon drop—which was impressive: big balloons, thousands, red, white, and blue, in a gentle cascade ... but my attention was called away. It was Michael Duffy, the lead Dole savant for Time magazine. Duffy’s seen a campaign or two—he’s tough, plenty smart … and he was wiping his eyes. “I just started to cry, in the middle,” Duffy said. He had a text of the speech, and he was staring at it—maybe trying to find the lines that got to him. He shook his head. “I don’t know ... but this ...” Duffy said. He gently waved the single page. “I think he’s got it.”\n\nMaybe so. Or maybe the Bobster, like Nabokov, had given it away—to Duffy, to Time magazine ... to us. The story still existed, in fact, but it wasn’t Dole’s own anymore. At least, he couldn’t hold on to it for long. Now he was moving fast, on his way to a week’s rest, to refresh himself. He went back to his plane, flew away ... and headed for Elizabeth’s condo in Florida—a long way from Russell, Kansas, and the old house on Maple Street that used to be home."
