        "text": "Cove Run Farms is a 160-acre dairy farm nestled in a beautiful cove right outside of Accident, Maryland. With 140 registered Holstein cows, 155 heifers and calves, a miniature horse, dogs, cats, goats, and the Bender family, the farm tends to be a busy place. Although the farm can be very busy it’s also a place to relax and enjoy nature. With a beautiful view and a pleasant breeze, you can simply sit back and enjoy the beautiful country. Bob and Alice started the Corn Maze in 2001 with the “Got Milk” Corn Maze and have been hosting the Cove Run Farms Corn Maze Adventure every year since then.\n\nEven though the Corn Maze was only established in 2001, the Cove Run Farms Dairy Operation has been around much longer. Bob’s father Oren Bender bought Cove Run Farms in 1962. He raised his family and hundreds of cows in his time on the farm. Bob followed in his father’s footsteps with a love for the land and the dairy herd. Bob married Alice in July of 1979 and they had their first son, Derrick in 1980. Their second son, Shawn was born in 1982, followed by their first daughter, Nicole in 1988, their second daughter, Alecia was born in 1992, and their third and youngest son, Logan was born in 1998. They raised their children on a nearby farm until 1996 when they moved into the farmhouse at Cove Run Farms"
