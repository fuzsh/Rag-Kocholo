        "text": "Hulu has been around for a while and, for our money, it's one of the absolute best streaming services available. From great movies like Anatomy of a Fall and Talk to Me to excellent television series like Shogun, Abbott Elementary, and The Bear there is always something awesome to watch.\n\nBelow, we've detailed all of the best Hulu deals and bundles so you can get started on your streaming adventures with their library right away. This includes the brand-new Hulu, Disney+, and Max streaming bundle, which starts at just $16.99/month, and is currently the best value available for the streaming services since Disney and Hulu are now getting a price hike on October 17. To see even more streaming and bundle deals, make sure to check out our roundups of the best Disney Plus deals and the best Max deals.\n\nHow to Get The Disney Plus, Hulu, and Max Streaming Bundle\n\nIt's official, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have launched the brand-new Disney+, Hulu, and Max streaming bundle. The bundle can be purchased on any of the three streaming services and starts at $16.99/month for the ad-supported tier or $29.99/month for ad-free access across all three platforms. If you're looking to cut down on streaming costs and currently own all three of these, this is an excellent bundle to invest in. It'll save you quite a bit compared to what you'd pay for the three of them separately - 34% on the ad-supported plan and 38% on the ad-free plan!\n\nThe upcoming Hulu price hike on October 17 will not affect the price of this bundle. This makes the Disney Plus/Hulu/Max bundle the best value for money if you're hoping to have all three streaming services at your fingertips.\n\nHulu deal for students — Get Hulu (With Ads) for just $1.99/month\n\nIf you're a student enrolled in a university (a US Title IV accredited college or university, per Hulu's website), you can sign up for Hulu (With Ads) for $1.99 a month. That's an excellent deal if you're a student, saving you $6 on the usual monthly price.\n\nHulu subscription tiers\n\nHulu is available in a couple of different tiers. The least expensive option is the ad-supported tier, which comes in at $7.99/month. This gives you access to everything exclusive, tons of movies, Hulu Originals, children's programming, and more. If you want to ditch the ads, the ad-free plan is $17.99/month. On October 17, the ad-supported plan will rise to $9.99/month and the ad-free plan will be getting a price increase to $18.99/month.\n\nHulu: Bundle to Best\n\nIf you want a more affordable option when it comes to a Hulu subscription, you can't go wrong with a bundle, and Hulu has several to choose from:\n\nHulu + Live TV (With Ads) — Hulu + Live TV (With Ads) is $76.99 a month ($82.99 from Oct 17) and includes Disney+ and ESPN+. It also gives you access to more than 75 channels with live TV and unlimited DVR functionality.\n\nHulu + Live TV (Ad-Free) — The ad-free version of Hulu+Live TV is $89.99 a month ($95.99 from Oct 17) and comes with ad-free versions of Hulu and Disney Plus, although ESPN still shows ads.\n\nDisney Bundle Duo Basic — This is the most economic bundle. It will set you back $9.99 a month ($10.99 from Oct 17) and comes with subscriptions to Disney+ and Hulu. Duo Basic lets you stream on multiple devices at once and comes with ad-supported versions of both Disney+ and Hulu. Plus, Hulu's app has merged with Disney+, so you can now watch everything in one app.\n\nDisney Bundle Trio Basic — The Trio Basic bundle builds on the Duo Basic by adding ESPN+ into the mix, bumping up the price to $14.99 a month ($16.99 from Oct 17). You can also download and watch select content on ESPN+ at this level.\n\nDisney Bundle Trio Premium — The Trio Premium bundle is $24.99 a month ($26.99 from Oct 17) and comes with ESPN+ (with ads) and ad-free versions of Disney+ and Hulu. You can also download select content across all three streaming services.\n\nAdd Disney+ (With Ads) for just $2/month more\n\nLooking to add a little extra to your streaming plan? The great news is that you can add Disney+ (With Ads) onto your plan for an additional $2 a month. It requires you to have a Hulu (With Ads) or Hulu (No Ads) base plan subscription, but then you'll gain access to Disney's entire library (from Marvel to Pixar to FX and so much more) for only $2 extra. That's a deal you definitely don't want to miss.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nWhat can you watch on Hulu?\n\nThere is a bonkers amount of shows and movies you can watch on Hulu. Let's start at the top and simply talk about the verticals on offer with the base subscription, because if we also talk about what is available via Disney+, ESPN+, or live TV, we'll be here forever. (You can also sync up Hulu with HBO to gain access to things like Succession and the new season of House of the Dragon.)\n\nHere's what you get:\n\nNetwork and Hulu Original television shows (AMC, Adult Swim, ABC, A&E, FX, etc.)\n\nMovies (HBO, Hulu Originals, anime films, etc.)\n\nSports (NHL, Soccer, MLB, Auto Racing, NFL, College Football, PGA, Tennis, etc.)\n\nNews (ABC News Live, Good Morning America, World News Tonight, 20/20, The View, etc.)\n\nHulu television\n\nHulu has some awesome shows, including many that are finished or are ongoing. For comedy, Community and New Girl are awesome for self-contained highjinks, and It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia has a whopping 16 seasons available. What We Do In The Shadows, Modern Family, Cougar Town, Broad City, Abbott Elementary, and Drunk History; there is a ton of great stuff to get into, whether your sense of humor is edgy or not.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThere are also some big originals, like The Bear, The Old Man, The Handmaid's Tale, and Only Murders In The Building.\n\nAs far as animated fare, there are modern adult classics like Rick and Morty and Bob's Burgers, as well as Futurama, Family Guy, and King of the Hill. Anime staples like Cowboy Bebop are also available. And if you want to bring more youth-friendly fun, Gravity Falls, Steven Universe, Animaniacs, Adventure Time, and Curious George are just a small sample of what Hulu has available.\n\nThe future of Hulu\n\nHulu isn't going anywhere. As a matter of fact, beyond it being awarded the best streaming service of 2023 by us and receiving a 9/10 in our updated Hulu review, it was bought in full by Disney in November last year and the House of Mouse has created a one-app experience for those bundling Hulu and Disney+. With an FX partnership, Hulu is also home to those shows, including the latest drama miniseries, Shogun.\n\nHannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.\n\nOriginal story from Brian Barnett."
