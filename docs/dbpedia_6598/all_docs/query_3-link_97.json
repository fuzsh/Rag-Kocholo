The 24-25 season will be Kalbas’ 21st season at UNC.\n\nHighlighted by the program’s first NCAA National Championship in 2023 and its seventh ITA National Team Indoor Championship (2013, ’15, ’18, ’20, ’21, ’22, ’23), a runner-up finish at the 2014 NCAA Team Championship, six appearances in the NCAA semifinals (2010, ’14, ’19, ’21, ’22, ’23), a trio of NCAA doubles title in 2007, 2021 and 2023, and Jamie Loeb’s NCAA singles crown in 2015, UNC has advanced to the NCAA tournament all 21 years it’s been held under Kalbas’ tutelage. Additionally, he has won seven ACC Championships, including five straight from 2016-19, ’21, ‘24 (2020 was not held due to COVID-19), and has been named ACC Coach of the Year six times. Perhaps more impressive than all those facts and figures, Kalbas has never had a scholarship player transfer from his UNC program, and perhaps most importantly, every single student-athlete that has completed four years at UNC has left Chapel Hill with a degree in hand.\n\nMARK YOUR CALENDAR\n\n9/18/24 – Roy Williams\n\n10/2/24 – Jolene Nagel, Head Volleyball Coach, Duke\n\n10/16/24 – Special Guest Speaker\n\nOur guest speaker for this meeting will be Andrew Carter, reporter for The News & Observer and The Charlotte Observer.
