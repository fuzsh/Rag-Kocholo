        "text": "UCLA guard works way to mountaintop despite setbacks\n\nBy Scott Yamaguchi\n\nDaily Bruin Staff\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — There lay Kris Johnson, sprawled on the Pauley\n\nPavilion floor with a strained back, having been injured in a\n\nscramble for a loose ball just five minutes into the first half of\n\nthe regular season finale.\n\nThis was really no time for an injury to Johnson, who had\n\nfinally come into his own as an NCAA basketball player, whose UCLA\n\nteam was already missing its leading scorer and rebounder – J.R.\n\nHenderson – because of a strep throat infection, and who was\n\nexpected to be a major force for the Bruins in the NCAA Tournament\n\nwhich, at the time, loomed just four days in the future.\n\nIn fact, the whole situation was a bit too ironic for Johnson,\n\nwho had arrived in Westwood the previous year as one of the most\n\nhighly-touted recruits in the nation, only to suffer a leg injury\n\nin the season opener.\n\nThat injury, a stress fracture of the left fibula, kept Johnson\n\nout of action for nearly a month, during which time fellow freshmen\n\nHenderson and Toby Bailey stepped into prime-time roles on the\n\nteam, and Johnson’s hope of having an impact went by the\n\nwayside.\n\n\"After that, my season kind of went downhill,\" Johnson recalled.\n\n\"I sat out, I was discouraged, I was frustrated, I was in a state\n\nof depression, I didn’t want to do anything and I was just real\n\ndown on myself.\n\n\"I came from being the man, busting, dogging, getting all the\n\npublicity being Kris Johnson of Crenshaw, to being nothing. And\n\nwhen that happened, I kind of took it hard.\"\n\nBut this time around, there would be no month-long hiatus,\n\nnothing to take so hard.\n\nThough Johnson did not return in the Washington State game –\n\nbreaking his string of five consecutive double-figure scoring\n\nperformances – or practice Monday and Tuesday, he has undergone\n\ntreatment twice a day for the sore back.\n\nWednesday, he was listed as probable for the Bruins’ first-round\n\ngame against Princeton here at the RCA Dome tonight, and for that,\n\nUCLA head coach Jim Harrick was thankful.\n\n\"He’ll be a good player against Princeton because he’s very hard\n\nto guard inside,\" Harrick said. \"He’s playing at the top of his\n\ngame, too.\n\n\"But when you get hurt, you get a little more cautious, so we’ll\n\nsee.\"\n\nJohnson has been anything but cautious this season. Cocky, in\n\nfact, might be a better way to describe him, though the confidence\n\nis not at all unwarranted.\n\nAfter enduring a rigorous diet and training program over the\n\nsummer that lowered his weight from 265 to 220 pounds, Johnson\n\nserved as the sixth man in UCLA’s first five games, three of which\n\nwere losses.\n\nThen, when coaches decided to pull point guard Cameron Dollar\n\nfrom the starting lineup so that his injured hands would heal,\n\nBailey moved over to the point, and Johnson moved into the starting\n\nlineup as the No. 2 guard.\n\nHe remained there for 18 games, during which time UCLA went\n\n18-3, and during which time Johnson returned to the form that had\n\nhelped him lead Crenshaw High School to a pair of Division I State\n\nTitles in his junior and senior seasons.\n\nIt became glaringly apparent in the Bruins’ 93-73 pasting of\n\nCalifornia on Jan. 13 in Pauley Pavilion. Johnson was nearly\n\nunstoppable in that contest, scoring 25 points before half-time and\n\nfinishing with 36 – the highest single-game scoring total of any\n\nUCLA player this season.\n\nThough Johnson had started eight games before the showdown with\n\nCal, he was probably the least heralded of the Bruin starters, and\n\nopponents tended to overlook him.\n\n\"When you prepare for UCLA, you don’t prepare for Kris Johnson\n\nto score 36 points,\" Cal head coach Todd Bozeman said after his\n\nteam’s loss.\n\nThat all changed after Johnson’s effort against the Golden\n\nBears, but nobody seemed to be able to slow him down. In his next\n\nnine games as a starter, Johnson averaged 14.7 points per contest.\n\nOn the season, he has scored in double-figures 20 times, and he is\n\nthe only UCLA player to have scored more than 30 points, with two\n\nsuch performances.\n\nThe second, a 32-point outing, came in last week’s 91-88 victory\n\nover Washington.\n\n\"We talked about Kris Johnson before the game,\" Husky head coach\n\nBob Bender said. \"We saw what he did to Cal, so we knew what he was\n\ncapable of doing.\"\n\nThat Washington was unable to contain him is a testament to\n\nJohnson’s uncanny ability to be in the right spot at the right\n\ntime.\n\n\"I just have a nose for the ball,\" Johnson said. \"There are some\n\nguys that, no matter where the ball bounces, it comes to them. I’m\n\njust one of those guys.\"\n\nSaid Harrick: \"The game comes easy to Kris Johnson. But I’ll\n\ntell you this: If you show up to watch a practice, Kris will be the\n\nhardest working guy there.\"\n\nEven so, Johnson is still overlooked by opposing coaches. While\n\nteammates Charles O’Bannon, Bailey and Henderson were all named to\n\nthe Pacific 10 All-Conference team, Johnson – who was the Bruins’\n\nleading scorer in league play – was left off.\n\nBut such recognition is not important to Johnson, nor was it a\n\nbig deal to him when he was pulled back out of the starting lineup\n\nto allow room for a healthy Dollar.\n\n\"It was getting toward the tournament, and I felt it was a great\n\nmove on the coaches’ part,\" Johnson said. \"I couldn’t do anything\n\nabout it, I just had to accept it and keep playing. I couldn’t let\n\nthat destroy or hurt the rest of my season."
