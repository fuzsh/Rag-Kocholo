Tuesday's game will be the second of thee straight appearances for the Bulldogs on FOX Sports with tip-off at 7:30 p.m.\n\nDICKAU RETURNS: The focus of Tuesday's game by the Seattle area media has been the return of Gonzaga University senior point guard Dan Dickau to face his former teammates. Dickau, who transferred to the Bulldogs for the 1999-00 season and sat out under NCAA transfers rules, missed last year's showdown in The Kennel when he suffered a broken finger in the game leading up the University of Washington's visit. That injury sidelined him for nine games.\n\nDICKAU AS A HUSKY: Dan Dickau played two seasons for the University of Washington preceding his transfer to Gonzaga University. As a freshman for the 1997-98 season he came off the bench in 28 games and paced the Huskies in 3-point field goal percentage, hitting 16-of-30 attempts for 53.3 percent. He was a Pacific-10 Conference All-Freshman Team honorable mention selection. As a sophomore he started 11-of-13 appearances prior to being sidelined for the remainder of the season with a fractured left heel. He was injured after three games of the Pac-10 season and had surgery Jan. 15, 1999. It was a bit of irony that Dickau's two major injuries in his collegiate career came at the University of Arizona. He had scored what was then a career-high 12 points prior to suffering his injured heel. In his two seasons at Washington he averaged 4.0 ppg, 1.4 rpg and 1.5 assists/game. He played in 41 games with 11 starts. This season he is averaging a team-leading 18.2 ppg following a season-high 29 points last Thursday against Fresno State University. He's also averaged 2.9 rpg and 4.3 assists/game.\n\nBATTLE OF BULLDOGS TO GONZAGA: Last Thursday's Battle of the Bulldogs went to Gonzaga University when the Zags topped Fresno State University's Bulldogs 87-77 at the inaugural Loud Records Fab Four Classic at The Forum in Inglewood, Calif. The win for Gonzaga was its second over a Top 25 team this season, FSU entering the contest tied for 16th in the ESPN/USA TODAY Top 25 and 21st in the Associated Press balloting. Gonzaga trailed 65-60 midway through the second half when the Bulldogs went on a 17-5 run for a 77-70 lead. Gonzaga converted 7-of-8 free throws in the final 1:49 to seal the victory.\n\nBULLDOGS VS. HUSKIES: The University of Washington leads the all-time series 28-9, but Gonzaga University has had the upper hand in the last three meetings. Only 11 of the meetings have come since the Bulldogs gained NCAA Division I status for the 1958-59 season, and all 11 have been played since 1971. Washington won all eight meetings from the 1970-71 season through the 1997-98 campaign. but Gonzaga snapped the skid with an 82-71 victory at the Spokane Arena on Dec. 8, 1998 . The next season Gonzaga captured a 76-66 victory at Key Arena in Seattle, the Huskies home while Hec Edmundson Pavilion was undergoing its facelift. Last season Washington visited The Kennel and suffered an 86-74 defeat. The Huskies' last win in the series was Dec. 30, 1997, at Hec Edmundson Pavilion.\n\nPAC-10 WEEK CONTINUES: Gonzaga University will play both in-state rivals in a span of five days as Washington State University visits Saturday for a 7 p.m. contest to be televised on FOX Sports Net. Gonzaga has won the last two meetings 73-63 during the 2000 season and 70-61 during the 1999 campaign, both game in the Spokane Arena.\n\nFIRST WSU VISIT TO THE KENNEL SINCE '77: The date was Dec. 13, 1977. Adrian Buoncristiani was in what would be his final season as head coach at Gonzaga University. George Raveling was the coach at Washington State University. The Martin Centre on the Gonzaga campus was still known as Kennedy Pavilion. And it was the last time the Bulldogs and Cougars played on the Gonzaga campus. Every game since has been played at the old Spokane Coliseum, the new Spokane Arena or at Friel Court on the WSU campus. WSU won that '77 contest 58-52.\n\nVIOLETTE GRABS 20: Sophomore Cory Violette was a true \"Bulldog\" on the boards against Fresno State University last Thursday, sweeping the glass for a career-high 20 rebounds. He had 12 rebounds in a pair of games earlier this season - at the University of Illinois and against Eastern Washington University. The effort upped his team-leading average to 9.2 rpg. He also collected his third career double-double in four games with 15 points to go with his 20 rebounds. The 20 rebounds was far from a school record, Jim Dixon grabbing 33 against Eastern Washington University on Jan. 23, 1961. Paul Cathey hauled in 28 against UNLV on Dec. 28, 1977. Violette now has five double-digit rebounding games this season.\n\nPOUNDING THE BOARDS: Gonzaga University continued its domination of the boards with last Thursday's victory. For the eighth time in nine outings the Bulldogs held the rebounding edge with a 49-32 advantage over Fresno State University. The only time Gonzaga failed to control the boards was against Marquette University in the championship game of the Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout. The Golden Eagles held a 31-26 edge. Of those eight games Gonzaga has had the edge, just one game was less than a double-digits. Gonzaga out-rebounded Eastern Washington University 36-30. For the season Gonzaga is plus-14.1 on the boards.\n\nSTEPP RETURNS TO LINEUP: Gonzaga University sophomore guard Blake Stepp returned to the lineup last Tuesday against Eastern Washington University after a two-game hiatus, and was back in the starting lineup last Thursday against Fresno State University. He missed the University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff and Portland State University games with a sprained ankle, snapping a streak of 38 straight starts. He started all 33 games last season and the first five this season, despite seeing limited practice time this fall after undergoing knee surgery last spring.\n\nELITE COMPANY: Gonzaga University is one of just three schools to advance to the Sweet Sixteen each of the past three seasons. Michigan State University and Duke University are the other two. Duke and MSU appeared in their fourth straight Sweet Sixteen in 2001. Since the bracket expanded to 64 teams in 1985, there have been 18 occasions where teams have had runs of three years or more into the Sweet Sixteen. The University of North Carolina leads the way with a 9-year stretch from 1985-93, followed by Duke with a 7-year run from 1986-92 in addition to its current streak.\n\nZAGS DON'T CRACK POLL: Gonzaga University failed to break into the USA TODAY/ESPN Top 25 released Sunday. The Bulldogs received 47 points as the fourth team under the \"Others Receiving Votes\" category. Duke University held the number spot with all 31 first-place votes and 775 points. Western Kentucky University is 25th with 71 points. Fresno State University dropped out of the poll after losing to Gonzaga last week and has 67 points, followed by Memphis University 61 and the University of Cincinnati with 52 the three teams ahead of Gonzaga. Three teams on the Gonzaga schedule are ranked this week - University of Illinois 8th, Marquette University 16th and St. Joseph's University 18th. Gonzaga has lost to Illinois and Marquette, and has a New Year's Eve date on the road with St. Joe's.\n\nGOURDE HOT FROM FIELD: Junior forward Zach Gourde has been on a three-game tear from the field for Gonzaga University. He's 24-for-35 from the field for 68.6 percent. He went 8-for-9 against Portland State University, 7-for-9 against Eastern Washington University and 9-for-17 against Fresno State University. He's shooting 59.8 percent from the field for the season, connecting on 61-of-102 shots. Gourde was a career 63.0 percent shooter entering the season.\n\nBULLDOGS AND THE KENNEL: The Kennel - home of Gonzaga University's Bulldogs - has gained the reputation as one of the toughest courts in the country. In the last 10 seasons the Bulldogs are 119-9 at home for a nifty 92.9 winning percentage. The Bulldogs went 12-0 at home in 2001, winning by an average of 24.7 ppg. The Bulldogs are 34-1 in The Kennel over the past three seasons. The 2000 squad was 10-1, and the 1999 Bulldogs completed a 10-0 season in The Kennel, winning by an average of 31.9 ppg. The Bulldogs also posted undefeated home campaigns in 1993 (13-0) and 1994 (14-0), and suffered just one home setback in 1996 and 1998. The Bulldogs put together a 34-game home-court-winning streak from 1992-95, which at the time was the country's second-longest active streak. Gonzaga currently has a 17-game home winning streak dating back to the last home game of the 1999-00 campaign.\n\nDICKAU ON WOODEN AWARD BALLOT: Point Guard Dan Dickau is the third straight Gonzaga University representative on the John R. Wood Award Pre-season Top 50 candidates for the 2001-02 Wooden Award All-America Team. Casey Calvary, a Wooden All-America pick last season, and Matt Santangelo in 2000 were the previous Bulldogs on the list. The Wooden Award Top 50 was announced this past summer. In late December the Top 30 finalists will be announced. On March 26, 2002, the 10-player Wooden Award All-American Team will be announced. One member of the Wooden Award All-American Team will be selected on Sunday, April 7, 2002, as the recipient of the Wooden Award Trophy as the nation's \"Most Outstanding Collegiate Basketball Player of the Year.\" The event will be a one hour telecast on FOX Sports Net.\n\nFEW'S TWO-YEAR RUN: Gonzaga University head coach Mark Few probably never thought life as a head coach would be so \"sweet.\" But in his first two seasons as head coach the Bulldogs have advanced to the NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen, one of only two NCAA Division I head coaches to accomplish that feat since the bracket expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Gonzaga, defending national champion Duke University and 2000 national champion Michigan State University are the only three schools to reach the Sweet Sixteen each of the past three seasons. Few was an assistant coach on Gonzaga's run to the 1999 Elite Eight. Few's 2-year record of 52-16 places him among elite company for second-year head coaches. His 2-year total of 52 wins has him tied for third for second-year coaches with Dan Monson, his predecessor at Gonzaga, and Ben Carnevale of the University of North Carolina (1945-46).\n\nBULLDOGS HIT 20 WINS AGAIN: With a 26-7 record last season, Gonzaga University hit the 20-win plateau for the 8th time in the last 10 seasons, matching the 2000 win total and second all-time behind only the 1999 school record mark of 28-7. Last season marked the fifth time the Bulldogs have hit the magic 20-win plateau in the regular season. The 1994 squad took a 20-6 record into the West Coast Conference Tournament, the 1998 team was 21-8 entering the tourney, the 1999 Bulldogs went 22-6 in the regular season and the 2000 squad was 21-8 heading into the WCC Tournament. Gonzaga's first 20-win season as a NCAA Division I program came in 1992 with a 20-10 mark, falling to Pepperdine University 73-70 in the Bulldogs' first appearance in the WCC Tournament title game."
