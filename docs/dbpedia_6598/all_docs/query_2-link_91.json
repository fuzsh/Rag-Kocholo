        "text": "A new group of Mountaineers will be immortalized as WVU legends. On Saturday, West Virginia Athletics announced the 2024 WVU Sports Hall of Fame class.\n\nThe 2024 class consists of eight members, including Anthony Becht (football), Chris Brooks (men’s basketball), Bob Donker (men’s cross country and track & field), Bette Hushla (swimming), Mark Landers (baseball), Rasheed Marshall (football), Adrian Murrell (football) and Liz Repella (women’s basketball). This class brings the total number of WVU Sports Hall of Famers to 237.\n\nRead below for a biography of each inducted provided by WVU Athletics.\n\nAnthony Becht\n\nAnthony Becht, who played football from 1996-99, finished his Mountaineer career second in tight end receptions (83) and tight end receiving yardage (1,178).\n\nBecht was selected as the 27th overall pick in the first round by the New York Jets in the 2000 NFL Draft. He played 11 seasons over 12 years at tight end in the NFL for the Jets, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, St. Louis Rams, Arizona Cardinals and Kansas City Chiefs. From 2000-10, he played in 161 straight games, trailing only Brett Favre and Peyton Manning in that span.\n\nChris Brooks\n\nThe late Chris Brooks, who holds the school record for career field goal percentage, was a first team All-Atlantic 10 Conference forward during his career from 1988-91 under coach Gale Catlett.\n\nBrooks’ 1,661 career points rank 12th all-time at WVU while his 755 rebounds rank 15th. He averaged 13.7 points and 6.2 rebounds in 121 career games.\n\nBob Donker\n\nBob Donker became the first three-time, single-season All-American in school history during his cross country and track career from 1991-95.\n\nBette Hushla\n\nPioneering athlete Bette Hushla was among the first women to ever compete in intercollegiate athletics at West Virginia University in 1965 when she was a member of the Mountaineer men’s swimming and diving team.\n\nMark Landers\n\nMark Landers, one of the top first basemen to ever play at WVU from 1991-94, earned All-America honors and was the 1994 Atlantic 10 Player of the Year.\n\nRasheed Marshall\n\nRasheed Marshall was a four-year letterwinner and three-year starter at quarterback from 2001-04.\n\nThe Pittsburgh native posted 24 victories and helped WVU to four bowl games (2000 Music City, 2002 Continental Tire, 2004 Gator and 2005 Gator Bowls).\n\nMarshall finished his career with a Big East record 2,040 rushing yards (breaking Donovan McNabb’s mark) and 24 touchdowns and passed for 5,558 yards and 44 touchdowns. His 68 touchdowns set the WVU career mark at the time, and he was second in career rushing (2,040) by a quarterback and in total offense (7,598) and fourth in passing yards (5,558).\n\nAs a senior, Marshall rushed for 861 yards and four touchdowns and threw for 1,886 yards and 19 touchdowns. For his efforts, he earned Big East Offensive Player of the Year and ECAC Player of the Year honors.\n\nAdrian Murrell\n\nAdrian Murrell was a two-year starter at tailback and led the Big East in rushing in his senior season, finishing seventh in WVU career rushing yards from 1989-92.\n\nLiz Repella\n\nLiz Repella excelled on the court and in the classroom during her four-year women’s basketball career from 2008-11.\n\nThe native of Steubenville, Ohio, earned All-Big East First Team Honors and CoSIDA Academic All-America honors in 2010 and 2011, playing in 134 career games and scoring 1,641 points to go with 716 rebounds. She helped lead the Mountaineers to three NCAA Tournaments (2008, 2010, 2011) and a WNIT appearance in 2009."
