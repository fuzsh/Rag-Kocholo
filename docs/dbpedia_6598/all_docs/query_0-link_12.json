        "text": "ST. FRANCIS, Wis. -- Bob Bender and Nick Van Exel are following Larry Drew to Milwaukee.\n\nThe Bucks announced Monday that Bender and Van Exel will be assistants on Drew's staff. Bender also was an assistant during Drew's three years as head coach in Atlanta, while Van Exel was the Hawks' player development instructor from 2010-12.\n\nDrew says the two were \"important pieces\" of his staff in Atlanta and will be dedicated to teaching Milwaukee's young players.\n\nBender spent the past nine years in Atlanta after two years as an assistant in Philadelphia. As a college coach, he led Washington to four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances (1996-99) and was Pac-10 coach of the year in 1996.\n\nVan Exel, a Kenosha native, played 13 years in the NBA. He was an All-Star in 1998."
