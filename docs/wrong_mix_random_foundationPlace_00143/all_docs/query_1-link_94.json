        "text": "Messages to QAnon from Mar-a-Lago\n\nTrump sent them another one of his blatant lies: that he was preserving the documents once convinced that “Biden would destroy the evidence in a Deep State plot against him.”\n\nPhantoms vs. Scotland Yard: Cuban sexuality seen from the North\n\nFrom an early age, American men perceived an exotic beauty in Cuban women; unique for being different; protruding by her forms and aggressive by being uninhibited, an image fixed in a thousand ways in the popular imagination.\n\nRight to abortion in U.S.: Roe v. Wade, a turning point torpedoed by Supreme Court\n\nThe decision passed in 1973 limiting the ability of states to outlaw abortion has just been annulled.\n\nCircling the square: guns and gun control in the United States\n\nThe Uvalde Elementary School killer bought two AR-15 semi-automatic rifles immediately after his 18th birthday. At that age, however, in Texas he could not have legally acquired a bottle of Jack Daniels or a pack of Marlboros.\n\nTo get to the North: the (legal) route of Guyana\n\n“I don’t think it’s necessary to make people who only want to be reunited with their families travel so far, and in these conditions. I’m going to tell you once with my hand in my wallet: we spent around $13,000 on that whole process.”\n\nThe Soviets in Cuba (IV)\n\nThe 1980s were the heyday of Soviet and Eastern European culture in Cuba.\n\nThe Soviets in Cuba (III)\n\nStarting in the 1970s, a new term appeared in the national idiolect: “institutionalization,” a word with which it was decided to baptize 1977.\n\nCentral American migratory route: testimony of a Cuban migrant (I)\n\nThe journey from Camagüey to Piedras Negras to reach the southern border of the United States. More than 3,000 km, 21 days.\n\nThe Soviets in Cuba (II)\n\nThe micro-fractionalists’ list of objections and criticisms of the guerrilla fighters of the Sierra Maestra were practically the same as those of the Soviet officials.\n\nThe Soviets in Cuba (I)\n\nFaced with the disengagement of the U.S. economy, the Cuban leadership had no choice but to turn to the Soviets.\n\nJosé Martí’s black mother in Ybor City\n\nThey say that she asked to be buried with a photo of Martí in which he had written the following dedication on the back: “To Paulina, my black mother.”\n\nTampa Bay Hotel\n\nDuring the Spanish-Cuban-American War, Tampa would go down in history for becoming the boarding point for troops to the island.\n\nTampa/Havana: the infrastructure and the two steamers\n\nThe Mascotte and the Olivette covered the route between Tampa and Havana for about 25 years. The Olivette was shipwrecked in January 1918 during the cyclone that hit Havana. The Mascotte ended her days as scrap iron.\n\nYou sure do drink here: Cal in Havana (II)\n\n“Silent Cal” returned to his country pleased with the experience and with everything he learned.\n\nPresident Cal in Havana\n\nCubans have always been hospitable and lovers of shows and soap operas. And as courteous as they are emotional, to the point that today they are the only passengers who applaud the pilot when the plane they are traveling on from Miami lands on the Rancho Boyeros runway.\n\nThe New York Times and Cuba\n\nA review of the view on Cuba of the influential American newspaper.\n\nCuban-American status in literature\n\nIn literature, this identity category has its first expression in the anthology “Los atrevidos” (1988), by Carolina Hospital. This very interesting book collects a sample of the literary work of a group of Cubans who dared to write in English for the first time.\n\nCuba: synchrony of an image (II)\n\nSocialism on a single island? For how long? Could Cuba survive the disappearance of Soviet subsidy?\n\nCuba: synchrony of an image\n\nIn the 1960s, the island became a Soviet “beachhead” in the middle of the Caribbean, which was reinforced with the Bay of Pigs invasion and, above all, with the Missile Crisis.\n\nThe Biden administration and Cuba\n\nThe administrative discourse is marked by three central themes: that of the Republicans, that of the progressive sectors of the Democratic Party and that of the Cubans in exile.\n\nOmar Everleny: “dollars will always be a means treasured by private businesses”\n\n“There are several options that the State knows can be put in place in the shortest possible time.”\n\nHavana’s movie theaters\n\nIt wasn’t just about infrastructure. Movie theaters formed part of Cubans’ daily life and imagination with an unusual force.\n\nThe arrow is in the air\n\nIt will soon be known whether or not the polls hit the target; whether or not there was a blue or red wave; whether this toxic variant of populism will continue in power or be replaced by a liberal tradition, necessarily renewed.\n\nPolitical ads\n\nSince the presidential elections that brought William Clinton to executive power, the use of Spanish has been growing in the race for the White House."
