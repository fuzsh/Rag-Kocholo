        "text": "As a working mom, marketer, former entrepreneur, and Techstars founder, my career has been an emotional roller coaster these past 5 years. Up I went riding the highs of a major acquisition and the lows of COVID parenting, then the highs of Techstars and the lows of winding down a start up. Throughout all of these experiences, I‚Äôve found immense value in connecting with like-minded women through digital communities. I find myself in awe of the access they offer and dedication to connecting like minded people like me. And I love sharing with friends the impact these communities have had on me personally as a professional and a consumer. It honestly thrills me to know that so many people don‚Äôt even know this is happening or that these exist. What an opportunity for brands to build into their experience strategies‚Äîto connect deeply with consumers in contextual environments that offer beneficial community access. I thought I‚Äôd share a bit more about a few digital communities that I belong to and ones that I just love: ‚ú® the old girls club aka OGC: Hosted by the amazing mallory contois, this virtual gathering space is for women and non-binary people working in male-dominated industries, with a specific focus on members with 5+ years of experience. Members are committed to giving and receiving non-performative & tactical support in the form of intros, insights, examples, guidance and resources. My personal favorite are the ‚ÄúMomming,‚Äù ‚ÄúYELL IN ALL CAPS‚Äù and ‚ÄúOpen Roles‚Äù channels. This community is so dedicated, we even have merch. ‚ú® VC Backed Moms: Founded by my dear friend Amelia Lin, VC Backed Moms is the largest community of venture backed founders at all stages of motherhood. Over 400 women participate, who‚Äôve raised over $3B in funding. Talk about powerhouses. I met some of my consulting clients in this group, and have made industry friends that I‚Äôll know forever. My personal favorite channel in this group is the ‚ÄúIntro‚Äù channel, where we get to learn about who these Moms are, what their families are like, and what they‚Äôre building. It‚Äôs incredibly inspiring. ‚ú® Female Founder World: Founded by Jasmine Garnsworthy, this is the place to meet your business \"besties.\" I find Jasmine‚Äôs content extremely educational and valuable, her podcast is fantastic, and this community, operated on Geneva, shares operational tools that enable female led personal care, beauty and DTC businesses to thrive. It‚Äôs inspiring, funny, relatable and the newsletter and live presentations/demos are incredibly insightful. I‚Äôm also a participant in the Techstars Boulder Slack channel which offers community, support, resources and friendship, and private channels through co-working spaces like Hula in Burlington and Day Haus in Stowe. These platforms have transformed how I connect, learn, and thrive. What digital communities are you loving right now?? Pleased share!! üåê ü§ù #CommunityBuilding #DigitalCommunities #WomenInTech #BrandExperience #Networking\n\nAs we move on from the era (I‚Äôm a Swiftie, so I must) of the pandemic, it feels like the remote work era is fading too. For me, this shift is bittersweet. My friends and I escaped city life, seeking refuge in the serene mountains of Stowe, Vermont. We traded the hustle for a close-knit community that treasures outdoor time above all else. Our kids prefer bikes over iPads, scaling mountains at age 5, swimming in rivers and waterfalls during camp, walks in the woods for playdates, and we‚Äôre ultimately fostering a deep love of nature from a young age. It‚Äôs a dream come true as a parent in some ways. Yet, as a professional and a marketing leader, I‚Äôm facing new challenges. Remote work opportunities are dwindling, making it tough to find fulfilling full time roles that align with this new lifestyle. I‚Äôm left wondering: did we make the right call coming here to Vermont? The answer isn‚Äôt straightforward. Jeff and I have gained a richer, healthier, and more connected life for our family. But balancing this with my career is an ongoing struggle. Consulting opportunities are plentiful, but as a super passionate brand marketer, I can‚Äôt help but want to dive in deep on something I am deeply passionate about. I‚Äôm curious to hear from others who made similar moves, or who are on the hiring side in cities. How are you navigating this transition? Are you finding ways to maintain your professional edge while embracing a more intentional life? #remotework #lifeinbalance #mountainliving #careerchallenges #opentowork #worklifebalance #vermont This Image: My son Stone and one of his best friends Emerson on a playdate. I took them for a hike in Weissner Woods in Stowe. We went through a whole fanny pack of snacks, counted trail markers and had to leave for an emergency poop -- but isn't that amazing that they started their playdate at a hiking trail?

Today, it‚Äôs easy for brands, especially remote ones, to stay behind their screens. That said, nothing beats the impact of real-world community engagement. Recently, a mid-sized brand I work with decided to step out from behind their computers and make a tangible difference in our local community. The goal was to drive genuine connections that resonate with the customer and brand's values and experiences. Here‚Äôs what we did: 1. Got to Know The Audience: Conduct deep market research to understand what resonates with customers. We unearthed so many learnings and were reminded how important it is to do this work consistently. 2. Engaged with Local Creators: Collaborating with local and relevant creators allowed us to forge authentic connections and co-create content that truly resonated with our audience. 3. Event Sponsorships: By sponsoring local events, we not only increased our brand visibility but also demonstrated our commitment to the community. We were able to talk to our customers one on one, get to know them. 4. Utilized Multi-Channel Strategies: Ensuring our storytelling regarding these experiences is consistent across all platforms, from social media to the website. The products we gifted IRL were promoted on our homepage, on social and codes were offered to access discounts on these products. The response has been overwhelmingly positive! We're seeing: - Increase in Engagement: Both new and existing customers are posting about our brand, commenting and saving our posts. - Strengthened Brand Loyalty: Our community appreciates our genuine involvement and commitment. - Enhanced Brand Perception: Our efforts to connect on a personal level improved our brand image and customer satisfaction. - Valuable Insights: Direct feedback from customers provides actionable insights for future campaigns and product improvements. - Major Uptick in Sales: The proof is in the pudding. 60% increases YOY in addition to increased visits to PDP. This experience underscores the importance of SHOWING UP, being PRESENT, and ACTIVELY participating in the communities we serve. It‚Äôs not just about digital presence but also about building REAL, human connections. I just love successfully helping brands revamp their experiential and related storytelling strategies, resulting in increased customer loyalty and brand equity. #BrandStorytelling #MarketingInsights #CustomerEngagement\"\n\nThe Rise of Micro-Influencers: A Game-Changer for Brand Marketing in 2024 Micro-influencers (also known as User Generated Content Creators) are becoming the new powerhouses in digital marketing. Brands are increasingly shifting their focus from mega-influencers to micro-influencers due to their higher engagement rates and authenticity. Here‚Äôs why this trend is gaining momentum: - Micro-influencers have a more engaged and loyal follower base. - They offer a more cost-effective solution for brands. - Authenticity and niche targeting lead to better conversion rates. I‚Äôve seen firsthand how collaborating with micro-influencers can drive impressive results for brands across organic and paid. The platforms I'm currently following and am impressed by are The Lobby for Seeding, ShopMy for Recommendations with Ecomm tracking and LocalAway for TikTok mastery. These platforms use SAAS models to keep brands active and creators engaged. Happy to talk through thoughts on any of them! I've tried personally as both a creator and demo'd as a brand leader, and have lots of thoughts. What are your thoughts on this trend? #InfluencerMarketing #BrandTrends #DigitalMarketing\"\n\nProud Marketer Update** I had the pleasure of working alongside Amy Kelly, Eli S. and Raquel Navarro of Miri AI to go on a long deep dive, understanding the MIRI AI customer, her pain points and how best to position the MIRI platform and then go to market. If you haven't met MIRI AI yet, it's a must. This is a business that will change the existing wellness space with the help of AI, and a team that is truly dedicated to building a better way for wellness coaches and consumers to interact. MIRI is wellness coaching at scale 24/7, empowering coaches to automatically support, track progress and monetize while they sleep. Once we understood who we were building for at the deepest level, I got to bring in my creative power house of a partner Angela Goleme to strategize and build a beautiful brand that we can now share with our community and the wellness world! I'm so proud of this fast-moving, committed team and can't wait to see MIRI flourish in the coming year. If you're headed to Collision next week, make sure to visit Miri AI and if you'd like to learn more, DM me and I'll be happy to connect you to the team! https://www.miri.ai/\n\nIn awe of my older brother and this insane undertaking that has become a central focal point for our families to spend time together. Dan or as I call him, Danny, had a vision and didn‚Äôt quit despite a lengthy process and many ups and downs. We got to visit the construction site throughout the project and seeing the purpose of materials in action was so inspiring. Who knew this was even a thing!!?? ‚ÄúThe home is a partial tear-down and retrofit, meaning that the house that he originally purchased was torn down except for the foundation, which was retained, and 75% of the materials in the old house were reused and thereby diverted from landfill. The new house incorporates passive house principles including a high-performance thermal enclosure, airtightness and heat recovery, continuous balanced ventilation, high-performance glazing of windows and doors, shading and daylighting, and moisture control. The overall design provides an air quality that it is so high that Dan‚Äôs allergy-induced asthma disappeared.‚Äù"
