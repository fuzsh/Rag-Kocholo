No top candidate is exempt from this never-ending parade of hair news, hair criticism, and hair evaluation. No cut or color is safe. Let's take a look.\n\nBack in May New York magazine declared Bernie Sanders' rumpled, wizard-like hair \"a media magnet.\" In August, The New York Times Magazine interviewer Ana Marie Cox asked Sanders why Hillary Clinton's hair received more scrutiny than his received. (His reply: \"I am running for president of the United States on serious issues, O.K.? Do you have serious questions?\") And just last week Al Jazeera published an article called \"Why Bernie Sanders Doesn't Brush His Hair.\"\n\nThe Donald, of course, has met with his fair share of snarky, smirky judgment for the way he combs his hair for years, even decades. But this past nine months alone have seen a new wave of dedication to the sport of mocking Trump's do. Rolling Stone recently referred to his mane's color as \"the patriotic shade of amber waves of grain.\" Vanity Fair presented a photo essay \"An Illustrated History of Donald Trump's Hair.\" The Hill even convinced the Trump children to comment on it in a recent video.\n\nThe media's fascination with Hillary Clinton's hair is long and ugly, starting with complaints in the early 90s that she should ditch the headband to vicious remarks indicating that the long hair she sported as Secretary of State was a sad attempt to recapture her youth. But where the male candidates' hair is something to lightly mock, Clinton's hair has always been indicted as a visual indication of her desperation to be liked. As Michelle Goldberg noted at Slate, \"she's been a symbol of the public opprobrium that awaits any professional woman who doesn't get her hair right.\" Just when it seemed we'd finally given up on our national obsession, The Hill \"outed\" Hillary in July for allegedly receiving a $600 trim at the John Barrett salon. And in mid-November, right-wing news aggregator Matt Drudge started a vicious smear campaign alleging that Hillary wears a wig.\n\nNow, this is not the first time in history hair has mattered to a constituency. Back in the nineteenth century, when locks of hair were commonly saved as mementos of loved ones, collector John Varden amassed an impressive array of presidential clippings: it included samples trimmed from every president's head, from George Washington through Franklin Pierce. Varden put the collection on display in a gallery at the Patent Office, where he worked, and visitors ogled the tresses free of charge. Besides acting as totems, presidential hair was also important to electability. Until wig powder became prohibitively expensive around the turn of the nineteenth century, no president was elected who didn't wear a wig—except Washington, who instead grew his hair into a wig-like style. And more recently, who can forget the $400 haircut that somehow eclipsed John Edwards' shocking marital infidelity as the most egregious thing the once beloved Senator had done. But the 2016 race makes our national obsession with Edwards' pricey hair affair seem about as wild as a hand-holding scene in an Amish romance novel. So why the sudden onslaught of editorial musing on crops and bald spots?\n\nThere are a few obvious factors: The presidential campaign season is now essentially never-ending, and with an entire Internet to fill with catchy reporting, editors and writers are forced to be more creative. And although campaigning has been a visual endeavor for well over a hundred years (don't think voters didn't inspect photos of Taft and Coolidge and Truman, because they certainly did), there are now pictures of candidates popping up in front of our eyes every few minutes, via Instagram, Facebook, and the dozens upon dozens of online news sites. A candidate is always visually \"on\" in a way he or she wouldn't have been even 20 years ago.\n\nBut the more compelling idea is that the uniform-like approach to dressing a presidential candidate, combined with having a woman front and center for 2016, has turned the candidates' hair into a last refuge for political reporting fodder. Clinton has always faced questions about her fitness to serve—as First Lady/Senator/Secretary of State—based on the state of her appearance, including, yes, her hair. Now that she's entered the presidential field, her presence has brought that same level of scrutiny to her fellow candidates. And with the very 2016 pressure on the press to not impose a sexist \"lady tax\" on the only front-runner who has to deal with all the physical implications of what it means to look like a \"powerful woman,\" they've been exploring new ways to aesthetically evaluate a crew of men whose most exciting sartorial decision every day is whether to wear a red or blue tie. Hair is still, due to its very nature, just personal and erratic enough to produce good copy.\n\nSome might argue that the surplus of presidential hair coverage is a great equalizer—that male and female politicians are finally being evaluated on the same terms. But extensive reporting on Sanders' errant wisps doesn't cancel out every article that has called for Clinton to \"soften\" her image with a more feminine haircut. Ridiculing Paul's natural curls doesn't change the fact that even former heads of state bring up Clinton's ponytails in high-level meetings. So instead of adding to the entire follicular obsession in hopes that one day it will level the political playing field, I'd suggest we scale it back as a whole. When it comes to picking a president, shouldn't we all be more interested in what's in their heads, rather than what's on them?"
