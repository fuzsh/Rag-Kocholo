        "text": "BBCCopyright: BBC\n\nIf you are craving more Oscars analysis this morning, join Adam Fleming for a Newscast live from 7am.\n\nJoining him for a comprehensive round up of everything that happened overnight in LA will be the BBC's Culture Editor Katie Razzall and Emma Vardy and, in the studio, BBC Radio 1’s resident film critic Ali Plumb.\n\nYou can watch Newscast live by hitting Play at the top of this page.\n\nIn case you missed it - one of the stand out moments of the night was Ryan Gosling performing a rendition of I'm Just Ken.\n\nIt began with the Barbie star serenading Margot Robbie and ended with a full-blown sing-along with director Greta Gerwig and co-star America Ferrera.\n\nIn between all that Gosling donned a bright pink suit covered in sparkling rhinestones with gloves to match.\n\nHe performed with Mark Ronson and was then joined onstage by several actors who played Ken in Gerwig's film, including Ncuti Gatwa, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, as well as a host of dancers in Stetsons.\n\nGosling even sang next to rock legend Slash, which you can watch below:\n\nMost of the winners at this year's Oscars have been predictable for some time.\n\nFor months, the sense in Hollywood - and wider - has been that 2024 is Christopher Nolan’s year.\n\nOppenheimer’s seven awards don’t break records - but the film did win many of the major categories: best picture, best director, best actor, best supporting actor.\n\nPoor Things - the original, Frankenstein-style tale - stopped Nolan’s film having an even better night.\n\nWith production design, costume, make up and hairstyling wins for the predominantly British talent behind the camera, the UK government couldn’t have wished for a better advert for British creativity.\n\nAnd Emma Stone (and a malfunctioning dress) picked up best actress.\n\nIf Killers of the Flower Moon’s Lily Gladstone had won that category instead, history would have been made. She could have been the first native American to win an acting Oscar. It wasn’t to be.\n\nBut there were other firsts, including for The Zone of Interest. The chilling Holocaust film is in German - and became the first British film to win a best international feature Oscar.\n\nIts director Jonathan Glazer made a rallying call for peace in the Middle East.\n\nThe director of the winning documentary 20 Days in Mariupol also used his speech to raise the issue of conflict. This is Ukraine’s first Oscar, and one Mstyslav Chernov said he would have gladly exchanged for peace.\n\nThese were sobering speeches for serious times.\n\nBut naturally, after a film about a plastic doll became the biggest grossing film of the year, the 96th Academy Awards were also about pink sequins - and a rendition of I’m Just Ken, by Ryan Gosling, that stole the show. Even if the film behind it only ended up taking one Oscar back to the Barbie house.\n\nThe works of Japan's revered animator Hayao Miyazaki's are done by hand and his latest work, The Boy and the Heron, was ten years in the making, according to Japanese media.\n\nThe semi-autobiographical film won Best Animated Feature tonight, Miyazaki's second after his first win in 2003 for Spirited Away introduced global audiences to his fantasy world of crusading children and giant creatures that are both mystical and cuddly.\n\nThe founder of animation house Studio Ghibli is also the recipient of an honorary Oscar in 2014. When he received that award, he reflected on his place in a landscape that is increasingly dominated by computer-generated imagery.\n\n\"My wife tells me that I'm a very lucky man,\" he said through a translator.\n\n\"I think I've been lucky because I've been able to participate in the last era when we can make films with paper, pencil and film,\" he said.\n\nRead more about Hayao Miyazaki here\n\nGetty ImagesCopyright: Getty Images\n\nGetty ImagesCopyright: Getty Images\n\nEmma Stone looked genuinely shocked when her name was announced as the best actress winner earlier.\n\n“I think I blacked out! I was very shocked,” she says backstage.\n\n“I still feel like I’m spinning a little bit. It’s a huge honour and I’m very surprised.”\n\nHaving experienced a bit of a wardrobe malfunction, she reassures us that all is now well.\n\n“They sewed me back in! I genuinely think I busted it during I’m Just Ken! I was so amazed by Ryan (Gosling) and that number just blew my mind. I was just going for it and things just happen.”\n\nShe said she learned a lot from playing Bella Baxter in Yorgos Lanthimos’s film.\n\n“The chance to play a person starting from scratch but in a metaphorical... way who’s gaining language and skills in a rapid pace… she was just full of joy and curiosity and true love, not just of the good but of the challenging of life and was fascinated by all of it.\n\n\"That was amazing to take with me. I really miss playing her – and it was two and a half years ago we wrapped... I’m really glad we get to celebrate tonight!\"\n\nGetty ImagesCopyright: Getty Images\n\nCillian Murphy looks like he’s still in shock as he comes into the press room (although it’s hardly a surprise that he’s won).\n\n“I’m in a little bit of a daze, I’m very overwhelmed, humbled and grateful and very proud to be Irish standing here today,” he says.\n\n“This movie is so special to me - myself and Chris (Nolan) have such a special relationship. We’ve been working together for 20 years, I think he’s the perfect director...I can’t believe my luck. I did a screen test with him when I was a kid and I thought that would be it!”\n\nHe said being the first Irish-born actor was “really, really meaningful” to him.\n\n“I can’t remember what I said (in my acceptance speech) but I did want to say I think in Ireland, we’re really great at supporting artists and we need to continue.”\n\nGetty ImagesCopyright: Getty Images\n\nOver on a different red carpet, the BBC's Emma Vardy caught Kylie Minogue just before she headed into the Vanity Fair party.\n\n\"I haven't seen the ceremony - I'm reverse-engineering my night - I've just finished my shows in Vegas.\n\n\"So I'm getting through this part of the night and I'll go home later to catch up [on the awards].\"\n\nShe agreed with Billie Eilish's win for best song for Barbie.\n\n\"She deserved to win,\" she said. \"To think of that entrance and write that song and deliver it, I think it's beautiful.
