        "text": "Alma Pöysti and Jussi Vatanen, the Finnish stars of Aki Kaurismäki's tragicomic romance “Fallen Leaves,\" have found themselves in the flurry of Hollywood's awards season, attending the Golden Globe Awards, the Governors Awards as well as many, many screenings as they wait to find out if theirs is one of the five films selected for best international feature at the Oscars.\n\n“We call on the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. AdThe message was the latest salvo in an ongoing scandal for the embattled Hollywood Foreign Press Association. On Monday, Time's Up reiterated that position and endorsed the publicity firms' letter. In response to the publicity firms' letter, the press association responded with an outline of various initiatives its taking while accepting it had work to do. “We should have done more, and sooner,” acknowledged the press association.\n\nIn this video grab issued Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021, by NBC, hosts Tina Fey, left, from New York, and Amy Poehler, from Beverly Hills, Calif., speak at the Golden Globe Awards. (NBC via AP)Facing heightened scrutiny arounds its membership and practices, the group behind the Golden Globe Awards says that it is committed to immediate “transformational change” and reforms. Hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler called for change on the broadcast, as did award winners of the night like Jane Fonda and Dan Levy. Three HFPA members took the stage during the low-rated show to acknowledge the controversy. Time’s Up president and CEO Tina Tchen said that “the clock is ticking.”\n\nLast year's show, in the pre-lockdown era, reached 18.4 million viewers, the Nielsen company said. The Academy Awards in 2020 reached a record low 23.6 million viewers, and that was also pre-lockdown. ABC had 3.9 million, NBC had 3.4 million, Fox had 2.3 million, Univision had 1.4 million, Ion Television had 1.2 million and Telemundo had 1 million. AdFox News Channel topped the cable networks, averaging 2.46 million viewers in prime time. ABC's “World News Tonight\" won the evening news ratings race, averaging 9.5 million viewers last week.\n\nInstead, most of Sunday night’s winners accepted from their own homes or hotel rooms in laidback settings unheard of for Hollywood's biggest awards shows. Friends watching on television downstairs raised a delayed shout when she was announced as the winner for supporting actress in a motion picture drama. “It was really fun,” said Aaron Sorkin, winner for motion picture screenplay. Their daughters, Sunday and Faith, both wore white dresses while making a rare appearance. Known for her singing career, Day became the second Black woman to win for actress in a motion picture drama in her acting debut.\n\n(NBC via AP)In the opening moments of a Golden Globes night even more chaotic and confounding than usual, co-host Tina Fey raised a theoretical question: “Could this whole night have been an email?” Only the next three hours would tell. Or Chloé Zhao, making history as the first woman of Asian descent to win best director (and the first woman since 1984.) AdOf course, there were the usual confounding results and baffling snubs, compounded here by some epic Zoom fails. ZHAO MAKES HISTORYWhen Zhao won best director for her haunting and elegant “Nomadland,” she was the first woman of Asian descent to win that award. It was updated on March 3, 2021, to correct the nationality of director of “Nomadland.” Chloe Zhao is Chinese, not Asian American.\n\nZhao accepted the award for best director for a motion picture for \"Nomadland\" at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021. (Photo by Taylor Jewell/Invision/AP, File)LOS ANGELES – Chloé Zhao became the second woman to win best director at the Golden Globes and the first female winner of Asian descent on a night in which her film “Nomadland” was crowned the top drama film. “This is what he said about compassion,” Zhao said. Zhao also was nominated for best motion picture screenplay and lost to Aaron Sorkin. McDormand received a nod for actress in a motion picture drama, but lost.\n\nIn this video grab issued Sunday, Feb. 28, 2021, by NBC, Norman Lear accepts the Carol Burnett television achievement award at the Golden Globe Awards. (NBC via AP)LOS ANGELES – Norman Lear made TV relevant with “All in the Family” and more 20th-century sitcoms, and he's accomplished the same for himself as a working producer who's nearing his 99th birthday. But Lear was modest as he accepted the Carol Burnett Award for his decades of achievement — and the decades themselves — at Sunday's virtual Golden Globes ceremony. “I've had a lifetime of partners, performers, associations and creative talents for which I am eternally grateful,” Lear said, adding there would be “an entirely different Norman Lear here with you tonight” without them. The Carol Burnett Award is an honorary Golden Globe given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for outstanding contributions to television.\n\nAnd they were ready, style wise, as the Globes split hosts, with Amy Poehler at the Beverly Hilton and Tina Fey at the Rainbow Room in New York. Backstage after the show, Sudeikis told reporters he owns a multitude of hoodies but chose the one emblazoned with “Forward” on the front and “Listen + Lead” on the back as fitting for the unusual night. “I wanted to feel festive and go for it,” she told NBC. Sarah Paulson held her little black pooch on screen and Emma Corrin's fluffy white cat grabbed a moment for itself. AdLydia Marks, a New York set decorator, told The Associated Press the evening's technical challenges were many.\n\n(Searchlight Pictures via AP)LOS ANGELES – The Latest on the Golden Globe ceremony (all times local):8:05 p.m.“Nomadland” has come in from the desert to take the Golden Globe for best picture in the drama category. Earlier, Chloe Zhao became the first woman of Asian descent to win the Golden Globe for best director for the film. It’s the first acting Golden Globe for the 36-year-old singer, songwriter and actress Day. Ad___7:40 p.m.Six months after his death at age 43, Chadwick Boseman has won a Golden Globe. ___5:10 p.m.Tina Fey and Amy Poehler began the pandemic-era Golden Globe Awards on Sunday night, delivering a split-screen opening from separate coasts.\n\nShe’s only the second woman in the history of the Globes to win, and the first since Barbra Streisand won for “Yentl” in 1984. Its star, guerilla comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, also won best actor in a comedy. “The Queen's Gambit” won best limited series, and best actress in the category for Anya Taylor-Joy. “Schitt's Creek,” the Pop TV series that found a wider audience on Netflix, won best comedy series for its final season. Catherine O'Hara also took best actress in a comedy series.\n\nThe 78th annual Golden Globes will be held on Sunday, Feb. 18, 2021. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)LOS ANGELES – The organization hosting the Golden Globes says it is developing a plan to recruit Black members after falling under sharp criticism for lacking diverse members. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association said in statement Friday that an “action plan” is under development to admit Black members. The group currently has 87 members who are journalists, but none are Black. AdAn HFPA spokesperson said it welcomes the opportunity to meet with groups such as Time’s Up and prospective Black members who are interested in joining the organization.\n\nFILE - Rose Leslie, left, and Kit Harington arrive at the 77th annual Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 5, 2020, in Beverly Hills, Calif.

Netflix, which topped all studios at the Globes last year, too, led with a commanding 42 nominations, with 22 coming in film categories and 20 in television. AdThe Globes are typically the first major show of Hollywood’s awards season, which ends with the crowning of the best picture winner at the Oscars.\n\nFILE - Event signage appears above the red carpet at the 77th annual Golden Globe Awards, Sunday, Jan. 5, 2020, in Beverly Hills, Calif.

Fey and Poehler, who previously hosted the Globes together, had previously been set to emcee again. Fey will host from New York’s Rainbow Room, while Poehler will be at the Globes’ usual home, the Beverly Hilton.\n\nFILE - Carol Burnett arrives at the 76th annual Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 6, 2019, in Beverly Hills, Calif..
