        "text": "Howdy guys, Anthomation here. Today I shall review the hour-and-a-half atrocity that was Foodfight! (2012 film).\n\nFoodfight! (2012) is an American animated film produced by Threshold Entertainment, which is the animation company founded by director, producer, and screenwriter Larry Kasanoff. Kasanoff, who produced the mid-90’s Mortal Kombat series, had not had much experience in the animation field prior to Foodfight!. For instance, the film was intended for a Christmas 2003 theatrical release, but after many production delays and a stolen-footage rumor, it ended up with a low-key direct-to-video release in 2012.\n\nFoodfight! tells the story of a cereal brand mascot, Dex Dogtective, who, along with best friend Daredevil Dan, band together a group of “Ikes” in Marketropolis to fight against the forces of the evil Brand X, who threaten to take over the entire supermarket.\n\nThe story in this movie is horribly written. This movie tries to establish rules with its world-building, but bails out on each rule it tries to set up. Similar to the plot of Night at the Museum (2006), the “Ikes” (or food products) exist in their world inside of the supermarket, which is only supposed to come to life at night after the supermarket closes up for the day. So explain why the villain of the movie, who I will describe later in this review, can disguise as a REAL human in the REAL life world interacting with REAL humans. It would be like if Woody started spontaneously talking to Andy for no apparent reason. In the climax, the “Ikes” are fighting off Brand X in a literal foodfight. This mere idea is already painful enough for those who don’t enjoy puns, but this literally goes for an half-an-hour! And it’s just the same two shots for an “Ike” throwing food and that same food landing on the Brand X army with crappy explosive effects.\n\nIn speaking of the animation, it is absolutely awful. There is no excuse for this quality, even with the massive production delay. And the worst thing is that it had a budget of $45 to 65 million! That is within the realm of most other modern day films in this field and by God, it looks this film had a budget of $4 to $6. The rendering here is horrendous! A sixth grade photoshop class could make something more appealing than this. The backgrounds are bland and terrible. And the animators had no idea what they were doing with the character designs. From a human-like Brand X representative that looks and behaves like a spastic rockstar from the ’80’s to a rodent that quite frankly looks like a poop rat, these abominations are the epitome of anyone’s worst nightmare. On top of that, every character has no facial expressions whatsoever and their mouths barely even sync up with the dialogue of the voice actors, so all of the characters emote through sporadic twirls and arm movements. It looks like C-3PO having a seizure.\n\nWith the story being horribly written, that makes the characters just as badly conceptualized. Just like the screenwriters, the characters are passionless and make no effort to be enjoyable or even likable. Everyone is a stereotype upon an even bigger stereotype. The protagonist is Dex Dogtective, voiced by Charlie Sheen. He is an anthropomorphic dog private investigator, as well as the owner of the Copabanana nightclub. There’s Daredevil Dan, voiced by Wayne Brady. He is Dex’s best friend and the comedy relief/African American stereotype. There’s the typical damsel-in-distress Sunshine Goodness, voiced by Hilary Duff. She has no purpose other than to be the love interest and the one Dex has to save. There is Lady X / Priscilla, voiced by Eva Longoria. She is the villian/femme fatale. And there are a TON of shameless product rip-offs, such as Mr. Clean, Charlie Tuna, Mrs. Butterworth, Twinkleton, and the Californian Raisins. Because this movie has no clue on who it is trying to appeal, it throws in out-of-place (and even concerning) innuendos. In fact, the final act contains Sunshine Goodness and Lady X in a fist fight and the male characters in the background, such as Daredevil Dan, cracking off jokes about their “melons”. As if this movie could not steep any lower.\n\nThis hopeless pile of manure has no shame whatsoever. The story is terrible and all over the place. The animation is abysmal and it would give people a headache just looking at it. And the characters are as unlikable and one-dimensional as can be. In my reviews, I will always have a group or demographic that the film can be recommended to even if it’s not that good. But this is NOT recommendable! Foodfight! is the WORST animated film I have seen! Unless you want to waste an hour-and-a-half of your life, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!\n\nGrade:\n\n0/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomation here. Today I shall review more of the painful movies I’ve had to sit through: Norm of the North (2016 film).\n\nNorm of the North is a 2016 film directed by Trevor Wall and written by Daniel R. Altiere, Steven M. Altiere, and Malcolm T. Goldman. It was produced by AssemblageEntertainment, Splash Entertainment and Telegael, and distributed by Lionsgate (who has a habit of distributing animated films at the bottom-of-the-barrel as they also own the rights to Foodfight! (2012)). It grossed $30.5 million at the box office on a $18 budget, which sadly was good enough to spawn three direct-to-video sequels.\n\nThis movie is about a polar bear named Norm, who can apparently speak to humans for a reason we will never know of, who is about to become the king of the Arctic. But when he sees a luxury condo filled with humans, he wants to get it out because they don’t belong there. Then Norm’s grandfather is taken by animal catchers, so it’s up to our furry friend to travel to New York, rescue his grandfather, and save the Arctic along the way.\n\nThe story is absolutely all over the place. I didn’t even tell you half of the subplots this movie so desperately tries to throw in. There’s also a villain who wants to fill the Arctic with luxury condos, a little girl that Norm quickly befriends, and romance with Norm and another polar bear, Norm having to please his father for all of the actions he takes, and AH! There’s way too much going on and all of these plotlines are passed on by faster than anyone can blink. It’s like the producers of this movie had a checklist of all of the various animated film cliches that had stuffed into this 88 minute flick.\n\nThe animation here is terrible. If Foodfight’s animation was rock-bottom, Norm of the North’s animation would be a half-step above that. The characters are not rendered properly. The fur of the animals looks as fake as a teddy bear’s fur and the skin of the humans looks as plastic and artificial as a Barbie doll. The backgrounds are as phoned-in and lazy as can be. Also, every character moves and behaves like a discount Illumination or Sony Animation character. Worst of all, the character designs are absolute garbage. Clearly, this was the thing that was the most rushed in the animation process because these characters are not natural-looking in the least.\n\nWith a bad story and bad animation, it would be inevitable that the characters would be badly thought out as well. Norm (voiced by Rob Schneider) who is the typical protagonist getting bullied for his unique difference (his ability to talk to humans) and having to overcome the odds to save the Arctic and earn the respect of the peers around here. There’s Mr. Greene (voiced by Ken Jeong). He’s the evil corporate billionaire who desires to build condos in the Arctic so he can make a fortune selling them off in the Arctic. There’s Olympia Brightly, a little girl who quickly befriends Norm and wants to help him save the Arctic. Then there’s Vera Brightly (Olympia’s mom who also works for Mr. Greene), and Elizabeth (the love-interest of Norm who literally only gets five minutes of screentime), and a whole slew of character-tropes that the screenwriters took as little time to develop as any of the main characters. And then there are the lemmings, who are three sorry excuses this movie wants us to believe are the comedy-reliefs. They’re only purpose in life is to either take a piss (seriously, there are convective scenes dedicated to this) or to be rip-offs of the Minions. They have this running joke that they’re completely indestructible even if they’re stomped on or electrocuted. Well, it’s not funny! Everytime I see these jerks, I just want to cook them over a fire just like what Chewbacca did to that porg in The Last Jedi. But the one thing this movie did manage to establish, it’s that these are most stupid characters you will ever meet in an animated film. It’s already bad enough that everyone is ok with a polar bear roaming the streets of New York City, but the people don’t even know that Norm is a real polar bear in the first place! In fact, they think that he is just a person in a bear costume! I don’t know who lost more brain cells, the characters in this movie or anyone having to sit through this piece of crap.\n\nWow, I never thought any movie would be capable of giving Foodfight! a run for its money for worst animated film if all time, but Norm of the North came pretty darn close. The story is horribly written, the animation is worse than second-rate, and the characters are either too stupid or too bland or even considered likeable. I can’t even recommend this movie to even really little kids unless it is just for pure background noise. The only reason why this movie doesn’t get a 0/10 is because it actually costs money to watch this movie on YouTube.\n\nScore:\n\n1/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomation here. Today I shall review the top 5 American Animated films currently on Netflix.\n\nNetflix is obviously a site that a lot of people go on to watch their favorite movies or tv shows. But it may not be the ultimate site for animated films, considering that Disney+ now exists. After looking deep into the treasure chest, there were some riches that could struck out, whether with ease or with deep searching. Here are my top 5 starting with number 5 and ending with number 1 (retroactive to September 31 as Mask of the Phantasm was taken off Netflix on October 1st).\n\nRalph Breaks the Internet (2018)\n\nBeing that it’s a Disney film, it’s a little strange to see it on the site of the company’s biggest streaming competitor. Oh well, all that matters is that Ralph is on here and that it’s a good movie. Video game bad guy Ralph and fellow misfit Vanellope von Schweetz must risk it all by traveling to the World Wide Web in search of a replacement part to save Vanellope’s video game, “Sugar Rush.” In way over their heads, Ralph and Vanellope rely on the citizens of the internet — the netizens — to help navigate their way, including an entrepreneur named Yesss, who is the head algorithm and the heart and soul of trend-making site BuzzTube. While this story has been done before, it concept is executed well (The Emoji Movie wishes it did this well on the technological contraption), the computer animation is superb (as usual for Disney), and the builds off the main leads to make them even more well-rounded than its predecessor.\n\nScore:\n\n7/10\n\nBatman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993)\n\nIn a time where most non-Disney animated films were trying to rip-off the lead dog, Mask of the Phantasm was one of the rare exceptions that gave us something new and exciting as opposed to something we had already seen. Only grossing $5,795,524 at the box office, the filmmakers blamed Warner Bros. for the unsuccessful marketing campaign. Despite this, Mask of the Phantasm eventually turned a profit with its various home video releases. Set in the 1940s, the troubled yet heroic Batman (Kevin Conroy) is pitted against a mysterious figure who is rubbing out Gotham City’s most dangerous criminals, and who many believe is the caped crusader himself. Batman’s alter ego, millionaire Bruce Wayne, is about to get married to the lovely Andrea Beaumont (Dana Delany), who helps him recover from his need to avenge his parents’ murder — meaning that his crime-fighting days may be numbered. This story is fantastically written with maybe the best plot twist I’ve seen in an animated film, the animation is able to capture the darker tones of Batman and Gotham City, and the characters, especially Bruce Wayne, are fleshed out with dilemmas that strive their actions and them as people.\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\nThe Princess and the Frog (2009)\n\nVisiting the House of Mouse once again, it was the traditionally animated film Disney had made since Home on the Range (2004). With another Disney princess musical coming out around the same time (Tangled (2010)), this film was arguably not as commercially successful as hoped, even with its positive reviews from critics. Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) dreams of one day opening the finest restaurant in New Orleans. Her dream takes a slight detour when she meets Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), who has been turned into an amphibian by evil Dr. Facilier. Mistaking her for a princess and hoping to break the spell, Naveen plants a kiss on poor Tiana — thereby turning her into a frog as well. The pair hop along on an adventure through the bayous to seek the help of a powerful voodoo priestess. Just like our lead protagonist, this film is hardworking and ambitious; featuring the first African-American princess Disney would put on the big screen. The story is well conceived, the animation is wonderfully displayed, and the characters are likeable (especially Tiana, who is probably my favorite Disney princess).\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)\n\nWhen you think of the majority of films that Sony Animation has put out there, it’s really hard to believe that this came from the same studio who made The Angry Birds Movie and The Emoji Movie. But no matter who made his movie, it’s universally agreed that this is a must-watch. Bitten by a radioactive spider in the subway, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales suddenly develops mysterious powers that transform him into the one and only Spider-Man. When he meets Peter Parker, he soon realizes that there are many others who share his special, high-flying talents. Miles must now use his newfound skills to battle the evil Kingpin, a hulking madman who can open portals to other universes and pull different versions of Spider-Man into our world. The story is really well thought-out, the animation is stunning to look out with its comic book animation that leaps off the page, and it features a Spider-Man that’s 10 times more likeable and well-rounded than Peter Parker in the form of Miles Morales.\n\nScore:\n\n9/10\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)\n\nThe second and final sequel to be featured on this list, HTTYD 2 is one of the few animated sequels that embodies that a sequel should represent. After the first movie became a smash mouth hit for DreamWorks (grossing $494.9 million at the box office), it only made sense that this needed a follow-up. Five years have passed since Hiccup and Toothless united the dragons and Vikings of Berk. Now, they spend their time charting the island’s unmapped territories. During one of their adventures, the pair discover a secret cave that houses hundreds of wild dragons — and a mysterious dragon rider who turns out to be Hiccup’s long-lost mother, Valka (Cate Blanchett). Hiccup and Toothless then find themselves at the center of a battle to protect Berk from a power-hungry warrior named Drago. The story is great to follow, the animation is as breathtaking as its predecessor, and characters of old are built to be even more developed and even more likeable and the characters of new are great additions to the movie.\n\nScore:\n\n9/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomation here. In honor of my birthday being three days ago, I shall review my favorite animated film of all time: Cars (2006).\n\nCars is a film from Pixar Animation Studios, who was coming off the massive success of The Incredibles (2004) and many other films prior to that I’m sure we are all similar with. Cars received generally positive reviews and also received commercial success, grossing $462 million worldwide against a budget of $120 million. It was nominated for two Academy Awards including Best Animated Feature, but lost to Happy Feet (but won both the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film). The film was dedicated to Joe Ranft, the film’s co-director and co-writer, who died in a car crash during the film’s production.\n\nLightning McQueen is a young, hotshot rookie race car in the last race of the season. At the end of the race, he finds out he is tied with Chick Hicks and The King. On the way to the tie-breaker race in Los Angeles, California, some hot punk cars get him lost in a little town called Radiator Springs on the old Route 66 road, which has been long forgotten many years ago. Scared to death, he tears up the town’s main road and is sentenced to community service by Doc Hudson. During this time, he meets a funny, but lovable tow truck named Mater and a beautiful Porsche Carrera named Sally. He also meets some other cars, which he finds to be quite odd. All he wants to do is get out of this town and back into the big city, but as the week until the race goes on, the town folk help him discover that life isn’t just about trophies, fame, and sponsorships and McQueen learns about family and friendship.\n\nThe story can’t be judged just by the plot synopsis, but by how the plot is put onto the screen. It would be easy to classify this movie as your typical sports flick with overdone plotlines that you’ve seen done to death. But here, the story is done in such a sincere and authentic way that it feels like its own. For example, Lightning McQueen not only begins with humility issues but also has hidden prejudices that will be corrected in such a thoughtful way. Specifically, he feels very uncomfortable being around rusty cars, which is why he is fond of his sponsor Rusteze. While stranded in Radiator Springs, the first car he meets is Mater, who is a rusty car, and they end up bonding in a nice friendship. This film also deals with small town issues, which is not something you see everyday is a “kids flick”. After going on a drive with Sally, McQueen uncovers that Radiator Springs was once a flourishing town with business flowing to and fro. In a heartfelt flashback, it shows how a newly built highway made the town bypassed just to save 10 minutes of driving. This makes McQueen help the town get back to its heyday and build a romantic relationship with Sally. But the marquee moment of this film is the ending. I won’t spoil it, but I will say that wraps up the movie beautifully.\n\nThe animation is spot on. Because Cars was produced by Pixar, that’s not much of a surprise. When you think about a movie that comprises anthropomorphic cars, cartoon-ish, over-the-top visuals would come to mind. But it knows how to balance out expressive facial expressions with realistic automobile movements. Because they don’t have human body features, their expressions have to emote through their faces and it’s done really well here. The backgrounds are able to capture the small town feel, which makes the audience fully experienced this whole other world. The characters move and act like real cars, but still have more than life to them where they are easy to get across.\n\nThe characters are exciting and memorable. There’s Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), the hotshot racer who learns humility and respect for others while trying to make the big race. There’s Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy), the comedy relief, who is actually funny, and the one Lightning becomes close friends with. There’s Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt), the attorney of Radiator Springs and McQueen’s eventual love interest. There’s also Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman), the car of many roles, from judge to doctor, and a former Piston Cup winner who has been in Radiator Springs even since an accident that ended his racing career. Then there’s a slew of Radiator Springs townsfolk From a hippie named Fillmore to an old cop named Sheriff to an Italian tire duo named Luigi and Guido, they bring their own colorful personalities. You round it off with Chick Hicks, McQueen’s biggest rival and the antagonist of the movie.\n\nWhat else can I say, this movie is AMAZING! The story has an unbelievable pace where it’s as good on a highway as on a dirt road, the animation is displayed incredibly, and the characters have a ton to offer. Cars is a must watch for kids and adults alike. In my opinion, this is the BEST animated film ever made!\n\nKachow!\n\nScore:\n\n10/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomation here. Today I shall review the Brad Bird film nobody knew at first but has come to love, The Iron Giant (1999).\n\nThe Iron Giant is a 1999 animated film produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation and directed by Brad Bird in his directorial debut. It is based on the 1968 novel The Iron Man by Ted Hughes. The film’s development began in 1994 as a musical with the involvement of The Who’s Pete Townshend, though the project was set in a new direction when Bird signed on as the director. The film significantly under-performed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million, which was blamed on Warner Bros.’ unusually poor marketing campaign and skepticism towards animated film production following the mixed critical reception and box office failure of Quest for Camelot in the preceding year. Despite this, the film was praised for its story, animation, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances and has gained a huge cult following over the years.\n\nA giant alien robot (Vin Diesel) crash-lands near the small town of Rockwell, Maine, in 1957. Exploring the area, a local 9-year-old boy, Hogarth, discovers the robot, and soon forms an unlikely friendship with him. When a paranoid government agent, Kent Mansley, becomes determined to destroy the robot, Hogarth and beatnik Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr.) must do what they can to save the misunderstood machine from many attacks and other conflicts.\n\nThe story is well written and thanks to Brad Bird’s wonderful director, it knows how to convey a good narrative. While this type of story is not totally original and has been at a good quality before this film, it has its own unique charm that makes it feel its own. This film relishes the 1950’s Cold War feel. For example, Hogarth is in school thinking about the metal giant while a duck and cover atomic holocaust video plays on the class tv and then Hogarth’s classmates start throwing out conspiracy theories about the metal giant being made and sent by the Russians to attack America. This movie also has great balance between humor and heart. There’s a scene where Hogarth is saying grace at the dinner, but is also trying to tell the iron giant’s hand (which had broken off in a scene before) to get out of his house which is really humorous. The heart and emotional impact of the film comes most prominently at the climax. I won’t spoil it for you guys, but let’s just say that you will find yourself tearing up at a pretty unexpected source.\n\nThe animation is fantastically hand drawn and perfectly explains how Brad Bird made such a big name for himself in the animation industry. The colors of this town in Maine are colorfully displayed, but still grounded enough to show that this is supposed to be a realistic atmosphere. The character movements are very lively and fit the moods and attitudes for each in that specific situation. The character designs are great to look at and have a distinct enough feel without feeling goofy and cartoonish. Lastly, the scaling of the film is fantastic to see whenever the iron giant is on the screen and is moving in some way.\n\nThe characters are arguably the most enjoyable part of the film and can easily bring a smile to anyone’s face. There’s Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal), an intelligent, energetic and curious 9-year-old boy with an active imagination. There’s Annie Hughes (voiced by Jennifer Aniston), Hogarth’s mother, the widow of a military pilot, and a diner waitress. There’s Dean McCoppin (voiced by Harry Connick Jr.), a beatnik artist and junkyard owner. He is among the first, aside from Hogarth, to recognize the Giant as no threat. And then there is the giant (voiced by Vin Diesel), a 50-foot, metal-eating robot. Of unknown origin and created for an unknown purpose, the Giant involuntarily reacts defensively if he recognizes anything as a weapon, immediately attempting to destroy it. All of these characters bring their own role to film and work beautifully in the film’s message of choosing who you want to be.\n\nThe Iron Giant went from that unknown animated film people liked to gaining a massive following to become a household name. Kudos to everyone who made that happen because this film deserves all of the attention it has received. The story is wonderfully conceived, the animation is wonderfully drawn, and the characters are wonderfully thought out. It’s just a wonderful film all around. The 90’s were not a great time for traditionally animated films NOT coming from Disney, but the Iron Giant was one of the few exceptions we continue to treasure for a long time.\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomation here. Today I shall review the latest animated feature film to be released on Netflix, Over the Moon (2020)\n\nBefore the review continues, I would like to point out that I will be reviewing the latest animated films right after they are released. Anyway, Over the Moon is a 2020 animated film co-produced in the US and China. It was produced by Netflix Animation, Sony Pictures Imageworks and Pearl Studio, who had previously co-produced Abominable (2019) with DreamWorks Animation. It was directed by Glen Keane, who was previously an animator at Disney animation. The film was first shown at the Montclair Film Festival on October 17, 2020, followed by its Netflix and select theaters release on October 23.\n\nWhen Fei Fei (voice of Cathy Ang) was a young girl, her now-deceased mother told her the story of Chang’e, a moon goddess of Chinese mythology who is waiting on the moon for her one and only true love. Her friends and family think it’s just a silly myth, so the 13-year-old girl, who’s a STEM-proficient student, decides to build a rocketship herself so she can find Chang’e and prove the story is true.\n\nWhen watching this film and knowing that it was directed by someone who had previously worked at Disney, it made total sense that the story would resemble many of the aesthetics of a typical Disney flick. You have the protagonist who loses a loved one, has a change of mood, surrounded by animal sidekicks/comedy reliefs and has to go on an astounding journey to eventually learn a life lesson. It’s the type of movie that has to check a bunch of boxes to appeal to certain demographics. Oh and I forgot that this is also a musical. If I’m going to be totally honest, the songs here were not that bad. Infact, I thought they added to the story pretty well and were fun to listen to. All in all, the songs were not enough to redeem a story that was flat to being with.\n\nThe animation is by far the best part of this movie, it’s colorful, fluid, and a joy to look at. When our main character finally reaches the moon, you would expect to see a lot of blacks and greys, but instead it looks like we entered into the World of Color show from Disneyland. The character designs definitely resemble those of films like Moana (2016) and Big Hero 6 (2014), but still holds up well on its own. The backgrounds look appealing and there aren’t any overwhelming issues with the shots and angles used to display the film.\n\nThe best way to describe the characters here are that they are hit and miss. There’s Fei Fei, the 14-year-old protagonist of the film who believes in Chang’e ever since the loss of her mother and builds a rocket to travel to the moon to prove it. She is overall a routable character, but also falls into the same trap as so many other protagonists of having to go on some adventure just to learn something about herself. There’s Chin, Mrs Zhong’s 8-year-old son and Fei Fei’s stepbrother. Chang’e, the mythical Moon goddess who yearns to be with her true love Houyi again. After looking it up, it was confirmed that Chang’e is based on true Chinese lore. Then there is Gobi (voiced by Ken Jeong), a pangolin and former royal advisor who was exiled 1000 years ago. Just like Chin, he can’t decide whether he wants to be the comedy relief or a failed attempt at an enduring character. This film also tries to squeeze in a lot of animal sidekicks. Seriously, the Rankin/Bass version of The King and I (1999) had less of these characters than this film.\n\nWith a script that settles for diet Disney, songs that good but not good enough to truly stand out, animation that is well done but can only do so much for the rest of the people, and characters that a mix bag to be easily forgotten, Over the Moon is a film that isn’t bad but can’t make a name for itself and easily falls in with the rest of the crowd. Considering that there haven’t been a lot of animated films to enter the US market, this film might stay relevant for a little while but that is best I can say about it.\n\nScore:\n\n6/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today, I shall review the top 5 animated feature films with a spooky theme.\n\nHalloween is a day to embrace cosplays, candy, and trick-or-treating (usually), but the thing that always gets overlooked are animated movies that can give you those annual chills. No longer will I be silent on this matter; it’s time to praise these films.\n\nParaNorman (2012)\n\nYoung Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit‑McPhee) has the ability to speak with the dead ‑‑ and he often prefers their company to that of the living. Norman receives word from his strange Uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman) that a centuries‑old witch’s curse on their town is real and about to come true ‑‑ and that only Norman can stop it. This was produced by Laika and it really shows. The stop-motion animation is great, the story is entertaining and while some of the characters can be a little static, most of them are still likeable.\n\nScore:\n\n7/10\n\nCorpse Bride (2005)\n\nSet back in the late 1800s in a Victorian village, a man and woman by the names of Victor Van Dort and Victoria Everglot are betrothed because the Everglots need the money or else they’ll be living on the streets and the Van Dorts want to be high in society. But when things go wrong at the wedding rehearsal, Victor goes into the woods to practice his vows. Just as soon as he gets them right, he finds himself married to Emily, the corpse bride. While Victoria waits on the other side, there’s a rich newcomer that may take Victor’s place. So two brides, one groom, who will Victor pick? The film was directed by Tim Burton and the film shines with his darker-themed direction. One thing you will notice in the review is that every film on the list exceeds in its use of stop-motion animation, and this film is no different. The film also benefits greatly from an intriguing story and well done voice acting from Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\nFrankenweenie (2012)\n\nYoung Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) is a science nerd and outsider at school, but he does have one good friend: his dog, Sparky. But then, tragedy strikes, and Sparky shuffles off this mortal coil. Victor is heartbroken, but his science teacher (Martin Landau) gives him an idea of how to jolt old Sparky back to life. The experiment is successful, and all goes well, until Victor’s fellow students steal his secret and use it to resurrect other dead animals — with monstrous consequences. Another Burton film, and another success. The film is shot in black-and-white and is also both a parody of and homage to the 1931 film Frankenstein. The animation is great and characters range from interesting to even more interesting.\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\nCoraline (2009)\n\nWhen Coraline moves to an old house, she feels bored and neglected by her parents. She finds a hidden door with a bricked up passage. During the night, she crosses the passage and finds a parallel world where everybody has buttons instead of eyes, with caring parents and all her dreams coming true. When the Other Mother invites Coraline to stay in her world forever, the girl refuses and finds that the alternate reality where she is trapped is only a trick to lure her. This was Laika’s first full length film, and it’s safe to say that they got off to a fantastic start. The animation is wonderful and the darker tone of the story and characters gives this film a uniquely entertaining experience not seen in most animated films.\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\n1.The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)\n\nJack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, is bored with doing the same thing every year for Halloween. One day he stumbles into Christmas Town, and is so taken with the idea of Christmas that he tries to get the resident bats, ghouls, and goblins of Halloween Town to help him put on Christmas instead of Halloween — but alas, they can’t get it quite right. The pumpkin king of them all does not disappoint in the least. It doesn’t matter if it is a Halloween movie, Christmas movie, or both, the movie is on the list and that’s the end of it. From the animation, to story, to characters, to songs, everything about this movie is delightful and as rememberable as holiday movies get.\n\nScore:\n\n8.5/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today, I shall review a movie that is too delicious to resist, Ratatouille (2007).\n\nRatatouille is a 2007 animated feature film from our good friends at Pixar, being the eighth film produced by the company and was written and directed by familiar face Brad Bird. The movie went on to make $620 million at the box office on a $150 million budget. More impressively, it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for four more, including Best Original Screenplay.\n\nRemy dreams of becoming a great chef, despite being a rat in a definitely rodent-phobic profession. He moves to Paris to follow his dream, and with the help of hapless garbage boy Linguini he puts his culinary skills to the test in the kitchen but he has to stay in hiding at the same time, with hilarious consequences. Remy eventually gets the chance to prove his culinary abilities to a great food critic but is the food good?\n\nThe story is really well conceived with a great sense of humor and heart to go along for the ride. The mere idea of a rat controlling a human by pulling on his hair is really creative and works to the movie’s advantage. You get to see how this leads to our duo, Lemy and Linguini, making great food, Linguini getting credit and fame for creating good food even though it was Remy’s creation, but then the two experience relationship problems when the publicity starts to get prominent, and eventually they eventually have their resolution. It is able to capture the abs and flows of a rat running down a dream and man desperate for a dream to run down. There’s a scene in the beginning of the film where after scavenging for food, Remy and his friend Emile are entering into a Granny’s house for the “perfect ingredient” to go with their newly-found cheese. The attic is where all of the other rats are stationed, and after Remy finds out the hard truth about his idol (Chef Gusteau), the Granny wakes up and a whole bunch of humor ensues. The entire is set up incredibly well and really jumpstarts the entire tone of the rest of the film.\n\nAs expected with Pixar, the animation is gorgeous. The characters are really well designed and feature expressions that the audience can easily emote to. The film takes place in Paris, and the movie makes the most of it with beautiful and color landscapes and captures the true aesthetics of Paris. The character movements are well done. The film just looks fantastic. I know I should be going more in depth about it, but it is one of those movies where you have to check it out for yourself.\n\nThe characters here are thoughtful and easy to root for. You have Remy, voiced by Patton Oswald, the rodent protagonist who strives to be a cook and has a great sense of smell and taste to the job. As stating before, he has many doors shut in his face, but is not one to give up easily. There’s Linguini, voiced by Lou Romano who also voiced Dash’s teacher in The Incredibles, and a hapless garbage boy who befriends Remy. You will find out that he is the kin of someone very important later on in the movie. Chef Skinner, a diminutive chef and the owner of Auguste Gusteau’s restaurant. Since Gusteau’s death, Skinner has used the Gusteau name to market a line of cheap microwaveable meals. I lied, he is the one character you should not be rooting for. There’s Auguste Gusteau, France’s most famous chef and Remy’s idol. I told you earlier that a hard truth would be found out about him, wink wink. There’s Colette Tatou, a chef at Gusteau’s and Linguini’s eventual love-interest. I forgot to mention the chemistry that is built up between these earlier, but it is another bright spot for the film. You have Django and Emile, the father and brother of Remy respectively. Then there is Anton Ego, who is voiced by the great Peter O’Toole. He is a restaurant critic whose negative review led to Gusteau’s five-star restaurant being downgraded to four. He ends up crossing paths with Remy and Linguini at the height of Linguini’s popularity and he is the man that the duo have to prove themselves to. All of the characters work well at their specific roles and beyond.\n\nAnother gem in the Pixar treasure chest, Ratatouille is a beautiful and thoughtful film with great story, animation, and characters all around. If you haven’t already watched this film, this is a MUST-WATCH. Aside from Cars (2006), this would have to be the best movie I have reviewed to date. Props up to this film!\n\nScore:\n\n9/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today, I shall review Pixar’s latest animated film release to date, Onward (2020).\n\nOnward is a 2020 animated film that was directed by Dan Scanlon, who had previously worked on other Pixar films and served as the director for Monsters University (2013). Onward was also the first film without any involvement from John Lasseter, one of the founders of the company. Let’s just say that the former CCO of Pixar and Disney Animation had to leave the company due to a pretty touchy subject. Back to the film, it received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $141 million worldwide, making it the ninth highest-grossing film of 2020 so far. It quickly had to be pulled from theaters due to COVID-19, but was then made available digitally. In January 2020, San Francisco tattoo artist Sweet Cecily Daniher filed a copyright lawsuit against Disney, Pixar, and Onward producer Kori Rae. Apparently, the van, or “Vanicorn”, used in the film was inspired by the tattoo artist and she claimed that Pixar copied her design without her permission. She sought to prohibit the distribution of the film in any capacity, but I could not find any other information on the case as of right now. Wow, what a depressing introduction to this review. Hopefully, the film is better than the controversy surrounding it.\n\nIn a suburban fantasy world, two teenage elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot, go on a journey to discover if there is still a little magic left out there in order to spend one last day with their father, who died when they were too young to remember him. Like any good quest, their journey is filled with magic spells, cryptic maps, impossible obstacles and unimaginable discoveries. When the boys’ fearless mom, Laurel, realizes that her sons are missing, she teams up with the legendary winged-lion-scorpion former warrior — The Manticore — and heads off to find them. Perilous curses aside, this one magical day could mean more than any of them ever dreamed.\n\nThis is one of those movies that might have a thin story initially, but starts to build up as the film carries on. They set up initially that the father of our lead characters has recently died and they, along with their mom, miss him very much. Narrative-wise, that’s about. Character-wise, there is more fleshing out the movie does, but the story itself is as simple as two kids wanting their dad back so bad that they will steal some voodoo magic from Dr. Facilier of The Princess and the Frog (2009) in order to get him back for one day. But as time goes, we start to realize that things may not be that simple. I would like to elaborate the surprising depth of the story a little more, but it would come at the cost of spoiling the ending. THIS IS A NO SPOILER ZONE!!!\n\nThe animation here is unsurprisingly great and shows how Pixar has truly come in their visuals over the years. And no, I am not here to take shots at Toy Story (1995). It is one of the best animated films ever created and it would only make me look like a complete jerk. As for Onward, it is able to beautifully combine the aesthetics of the magical past with the overall look of the modern city. The character designs of the mythical creatures look very appealing, and so are their movements. Their facial expressions bring out a lot of life in each one of the characters.\n\nThe characters here are fleshed out really well and are able to convey enough emotion in the most crucial of places. We have our two teen elf leads: Ian and Barley Lightfoot. They are voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt respectively. I will try my best to refrain from Marvel jokes when talking about these two characters. Ian is the younger brother who is more shy and lacking in self-confidence. Barley is the older brother who is an enthusiastic, impulsive history and role-playing game fanatic, longing for a magical quest. There’s Laurel Lightfoot, voiced by Julia Louis-Dreydus, the mother of the two leads. There’s Corey, a manticore restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest. There’s Colt Bronco, a centaur police officer and Laurel’s boyfriend. And there is Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley’s late father and Laurel’s late husband. With big name actors providing the voices of our protagonists, they prove their worth by providing enthusiastic performances to make us care about them even more, especially Chris Pratt.\n\nOnward is another quality film from a studio that basks in quality. The story has more to offer than you might think, the animation is well done, and the characters are lively and build up a lot of the film’s excitement. Maybe not the best film Pixar has made, but it’s gearing up to be one of the best animated films of 2020. And no lawsuit will stop this movie from being watchable.\n\nScore:\n\n7/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today, I shall review the only mainstream full length animated Thanksgiving film currently out there: Free Birds (2013).\n\nFree Birds is a 2013 animated film produced by Reel FX Creative Studios. It is the first theatrical fully animated feature film from the production company, as they would later go on to make The Book of Life (2014), which is a very underrated film, and Rumble (2021), which I have obviously not seen yet since it hasn’t been released. It was directed by Jimmy Hayward, who had previously directed Horton Hears a Who! (2008). The film was released by Relativity Media, which had to close down due to bankruptcy in 2015. As for the film itself, it received generally unfavorable reviews from critics but was a commercial success, grossing $110 million on a $55 million budget.\n\nAfter years of fruitless warning of his farmyard brethren of the coming Thanksgiving doom, Reggie the Turkey finds himself spared as the annual Pardoned Turkey. However, Reggie’s easy life is disrupted by Jake, a fanatic turkey who drags him along with the insane idea of going back in time to make sure turkeys are not part of the first Thanksgiving. Through foolhardiness and luck, the pair manage to take an experimental time machine to do just that. Now in 1621 at the Plymouth colony, Reggie and Jake find themselves in the middle of a turkey clan’s struggle for survival. In doing so, their preconceptions of the world and themselves are challenged forever in a conflict from which the world will never be the same.\n\nWhen talking about the story of this movie, the easiest way to describe it is that it is a hot mess. Sometimes the film wants to tell some cheap Back to the Future narrative, but other times it is just looking to be a really long Looney Tunes cartoon. Overall, the comedy is hit and miss but mostly on the miss side. There are a couple of jokes in the beginning of the film when Jake first abducts Reggie and then he announces the entire mission to a car mirror, thinking he is talking to a guy that looks exactly like him. But then there a lot of stupid jokes like when Jake and Ranger (who is basically just Jake but blue instead of Red) have a dance battle while being on lookout for incoming pilgrims. At first, it might get a giggle but it goes on for a really long time and the audience is left to wonder: why?\n\nBut the thing that bothered me the most was the sudden tone shift in the third act. Seriously, the film went from being a comedy-adventure to an all out serious flick with a climax that I won’t spoil, but trust me it comes right out of nowhere.\n\nFor an animation studio making their first full length feature, the animation is pretty competent. Don’t get me wrong, it is still second rate and it doesn’t compare to something you would see is a Disney or Pixar movie. With that said, the character designs of the turkeys and the backgrounds of Plymouth colony are decently conceived. Since it is a comedy movement, the character movements are the over-the-top, but still work for the most part. As for the colors, they are basic and definitely will not wow anyone. After watching The Book of Life, it made total sense that Free Birds would be the starting place and the latter was a huge step up. To compare it to Disney’s early computer animated day, think of Chicken Little (2005) and Meet the Robinsons (2007) to Bolt (2008).\n\nThe characters are nothing out of the ordinary and the screenwriters focus more on goofy gags rather than developing well-thought-out characters. There is Reggie (voiced by Owen Wilson), a domesticated turkey who is pardoned by the President of the United States and is dragged into Jake’s plot. There’s Jake, (voiced by Woody Harrelson), a wild turkey that is the president of the Turkey Freedom Front (T.F.F.) and the dummy that gets the plot rolling. There’s Jenny (voiced by Amy Poehler), another wild turkey and Reggie’s love interest. There’s Chief Broadbeak, (voiced by Keith David), the chief of the native turkeys and Jenny’s father and Reggie’s father-in-law. There is Ranger, (voiced by director Jimmy Hayward), Jenny’s brother and Broadbeak’s son and Reggie’s brother-in-law. He becomes “huge” frenemies with Jake. Step aside Jefferson and Hamilton, there is a new duo in town. And then there is Myles Standish, who is a pilgrim hunter and the main villain of the movie. He is bent on killing all of the turkeys so he can feed the rest of the pilgrims. What a minute, this guy is not a bad guy. In fact, he is just to help his people. Why couldn’t this guy be the main character? I mean, his story is a lot more interesting than the one that actually came to fruition.\n\nFree Birds is the Thanksgiving version of Hop (2011), a film that is not good but is popular because it is the only mainstream full length animated film for that specific holiday. The story, animation, and characters range from decent to forgettable. It’s a film that might be recognizable to little kids trying to find a Turkey Day film, but it’s a pass for everyone else.\n\nScore:\n\n5/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today, I shall review the latest film to come out in 2020: The Croods: A New Age.\n\nA New Age is the most recent film from the DreamWorks Animation cannon and their fourth film made since they were bought out by NBCUniversal. Seriously, the fact that DreamWorks and Illumination are now owned by the same parent company is really scary to think about. But I digress. The film was released into theaters this past Thanksgiving, with limited capacity of course, and can still be viewed on the big screen. As of right now, the film has grossed $35.4 million on a $65 million, though it is unlikely that it ends up a box office bomb.\n\nSearching for a safer habitat, the prehistoric Crood family discovers an idyllic, walled-in paradise that meets all of its needs. Unfortunately, they must also learn to live with the Bettermans — a family that’s a couple of steps above the Croods on the evolutionary ladder. As tensions between the new neighbors start to rise, a new threat soon propels both clans on an epic adventure that forces them to embrace their differences, draw strength from one another, and survive together.\n\nThe story tries to shoehorn in way too many cliches and doesn’t have enough substance of its own to fully justify its existence. The movie goes on repeat mode with its storyline of an overbearing father and his teenage daughter. Then, it adds a lot of romantic jealousy between each of the two families. That will be explained later in the character section. Also, there is this tribe of punch monkeys who end up capturing our male leads and they only communicate by punching people. I admit that the idea is creative. Congratulations movie: you get one point for creativity. The best scene is a dinner scene, where it is like that scene from Shrek 2 (2004) but instead with the Croods and Bettermans. Like the rest of the movie, its loud and there is a lot of arguing and bickering. It’s the only time in the movie where being loud actually works to the movie’s advantage. For the rest of the movie, there is too obnoxious yelling, stale jokes that didn’t even work in the first Croods film, lots of modern slang, and a tone that is too cartoonish for a sequel to a film that took itself somewhat seriously. The climax of the film features the female leads rescuing the male leads from their captivity in the punching-monkey layer. Now, I am all for this, but can you execute in a fun and thoughtful manner. The short answer is no. The long answer is they make the Grandma from the first Croods the most important character by having her introduce the Thundersisters, and they use that to transform themselves into cave-super heroines. Right the heck out of nowhere, this film wanted to like some TV show. I’m not joking, this film decided to pay homage to 90’s style TV opening themes as the Thundersisters made their dramatic entrance. There is that moment in bad films where people can see where everything goes completely off the rails, and this was that moment.\n\nThe animation is overall good, but it’s nothing groundbreaking. While it has a variety of colors to emulate the specific tones of each of the scenes, the colors also emulate something out of Trolls: World Tour (2020). When the film has to copy the displaying of colors of another film from the same studio that came out in the same year, the creative aspect of the animation can get lost in the dust. I guest DreamWorks is tired of ripping off Pixar films, so they are resorting to ripping off their off films. Aside from that, I don’t have much of a problem with the visuals. The character movements are nice, the action scenes are still well done even if they are not as sweeping as the predecessor, and the facial expressions did a couple of chuckles out of me.\n\nThe characters are not as enjoyable as before as they came off as being one of three things: annoying, loud, or careless. There is Grug Crood (voiced by Nic Cage), a caveman and the patriarch of the Croods. There’s Crood (voiced by Emma Stone), a cavegirl, Grug’s oldest daughter and she is Guy’s girlfriend. There’s Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds), an intelligent caveboy who lives with the Croods and is Eep’s boyfriend. To round off the rest of the Croods with Ugga, Thunk, and Gran, who are the mother, son, and grandma respectively. And then we are introduced to the Bettermans. There is Phil Betterman (voiced by Peter Dinklage), the patriarch of the Bettermans who had a history with Guy’s parents. There’s Hope Betterman (voiced by Leslie Mann), the matriarch of the Bettermans and Phil’s wife. There’s Dawn Betterman, Phil and Hope’s daughter and only child who befriends Eep and is Guy’s old friend. As stated before, there is a lot of arguing and yelling going on in this picture. Grug doesn’t like Pete, Ugga doesn’t like Hope, Guy and Eep have a romantic meltdown, and Hope practically admits her hate for all of the Croods in the second act. A closet can only fit in so much junk, and there is way too much junk in this closet.\n\nThe Croods: A New Age lacks the substance of its predecessor. The story has too many subplots with an inconsistent tone, the characters are not very enjoyable, and the animation is nothing special. If you are a fan of The Croods (2013), it’s still ok enough to warrant a look. Everyone else won’t find a ton of enjoyment in this flick.\n\nScore:\n\n5/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today I shall review my last film of 2020, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run.\n\nSponge on the Run is a 2020 animated film from Paramount Animation and Nickelodeon Movies. It is the third theatrical film based on the series, following the first in 2004 and second in 2015. The film is dedicated to SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg, who died in 2018, and also served as an executive producer on the project. It is also the first film in the franchise to be fully animated in stylized CGI rather than traditional 2D animation. Originally slated for a worldwide theatrical release by Paramount Pictures, plans were changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was released theatrically in Canada on August 14, 2020, and digitally on Netflix in other territories on November 5, 2020, while it will have a premium video-on-demand and CBS All Access release in the United States in early 2021. So far, it has made $4.8 million on a $60 million budget, but those won’t stay the same for long.\n\nWhen SpongeBob’s beloved pet snail Gary goes missing, a path of clues leads SpongeBob and Patrick to the powerful King Poseidon, who has Gary held captive in the lost city of Atlantic City. On their mission to save Gary, SpongeBob and his pals team up for a heroic and hilarious journey, where they discover nothing is stronger than the power of friendship.\n\nThe story is very basic, but nothing too complainable considering that it is a SpongeBob film. What is complainable are the useless and even cringeworthy detours this movie decides to take. For example, why in the flying cinnamon sticks is Snoop Dogg in this film?! It comes right out of nowhere. They give him a rapping number to introduce El Diablo, check out the character section, but it comes right out of left field. I don’t care for it. In fact, the entire scene is out of place and unnecessary. Tell me if this doesn’t sound strange: SpongeBob and Patrick meet a tumbleweed with the face of Keanu Reeves, who tells them to defeat these cowboy zombie pirates using a coin of courage in order to pass a test that will lead them to find Gary the snail, who has been taken by King Poseidon to be used as a face moisturizer. Maybe it was to be hip with the “cool kids” or to fill its hour-and-a-half running time or both, it adds nothing to the story’s thin premise and it isn’t even that funny.\n\nAgain, the animation is in complete CGI instead of traditional 2D, and it lends itself to the world of Bikini Bottom surprisingly well. Not only were visuals very colorful, but it still had the same aesthetic appeal as the original animation. The characters look updated, but still nostalgic at the same time. Their movements still have that same cartoonish feel. I just love how whenever the characters cry, they cry out a literal waterfall. Towards the end of the film, we are introduced to the beloved cast as children retreat and how SpongeBob got to meet Patrick, Squidward, and others. This may be a nock on the story for being not needed, but little kid SpongeBob is fun to look at. Overall, the animation team at Paramount and Nickelodeon get two thumbs up from this moody critic.\n\nThe characters are still the same recognizable crew from the long-running show and their comedy translates well to the film. You have Spongebob and Patrick, the two quirky friends off to find Gary after he is found missing. There’s Squidward, who is still his moody self, but he also has a celebrity crush on this saxophone-playing octopus. Mr. Krabs is still a money-grubbing businessman. Sandy is there making scientific discoveries. Plankton is still after Krabs and the Crabby Patty formula. I won’t spoil anything, but let’s say that Plankton is the one responsible for getting the plot rolling. There is Karen, Plankton’s computer wife who is also his voice of reason. King Poseidon makes a return into the world of SpongeBob, also being in the original film, and is a power-hungry king and his only concern is to look impeccable. The only new character with a substantial role in the Obi-wan Kenobi tumbleweed voiced by Keanu Reeves. While he does give a pretty funny performance, the character itself could have been cut from the movie. My favorite joke is when the gang is running from the king’s guards after taking back Gary and Patrick decides to steal some chicken wings that were left on a nearby table. The characters still bring familiar humor and personality.\n\nOut of all this year’s animated films based on recognizable tv shows, this one is probably the best. While the story is not very well written, the animation is well done and the characters bring some laughs along the way. SpongeBob fans will like it and so will kids looking for a simple adventure.\n\nScore:\n\n6/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today I shall review the top 5 animated full length movies that can get you in the holiday mood.\n\nAs Andy Williams put it so beautifully, this is the most wonderful time of the year! Christmas trees, gifts, being around family, celebrating the birth of Christ, this time brings out the best in all of us. And don’t forget all of the holiday classics that families everywhere have grown to love. Well, let’s look at the 5 animated films that can give people that holiday cheer.\n\nA Christmas Carol (2009)\n\nI think we’re all familiar with the story of Scrooge, but for those who are not here’s a summary. Though London awaits the joyful arrival of Christmas, miserly Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) thinks it’s all humbug, berating his faithful clerk and cheerful nephew for their view. Later, Scrooge encounters the ghost of his late business partner, who warns that three spirits will visit him this night. The ghosts take Scrooge on a journey through his past, present and future in the hope of transforming his bitterness. This film was directed by Robert Zemeckis, and it was his fourth mo-cap film to come from the Imagemovers studio. There are some fine performances from Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman and the motion capture at times looks spectacular, the elements don’t always mesh very well with the message getting a little overlooked by the hit or miss effects.\n\nScore:\n\n6/10\n\nArthur Christmas (2011)\n\nEveryone knows that, each Christmas, Santa Claus delivers presents to every last child on Earth. What everyone doesn’t know is that Santa accomplishes the feat with a very high-tech operation beneath the North Pole. But when the unthinkable happens, and Santa misses one child out of hundreds of millions, someone has to save the day. It’s up to Arthur (James McAvoy), Santa’s youngest son, to deliver a present to the forgotten tyke before Christmas morning dawns. This came from Aardman Studios, the company behind stop motion gems like Chicken Run (2000), one of my all time favorite films. This movie has a surprisingly deep message and characters that are very likable, but Aardman’s brief transition into CGI can look a bit wonky and the pacing is high-speed 24-7, meaning the audience cannot look away or else they might miss what just happened.\n\nScore:\n\n6.5/10\n\nThe Polar Express (2004)\n\nTom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis reunite for Polar Express, an inspiring adventure based on the beloved children’s book by Chris Van Allsburg. When a doubting young boy takes an extraordinary train ride to the North Pole, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery that shows him that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe. This is the first mo-cap film to come from Imagemovers. It’s my personal favorite to watch over the holiday season, but I realize that this film is not perfect. The animation is great, but there are a couple of scenes that will make you scratch your head as to how they made the final cut. Also, Tom Hanks voices every character in this film.\n\nScore:\n\n6.5/10\n\n2.The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)\n\nI know this movie was in the Halloween top 5 list, but this film fits well in both holidays. Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, is bored with doing the same thing every year for Halloween. One day he stumbles into Christmas Town, and is so taken with the idea of Christmas that he tries to get the resident bats, ghouls, and goblins of Halloween Town to help him put on Christmas instead of Halloween — but alas, they can’t get it quite right. The pumpkin king of them all does not disappoint in the least. It doesn’t matter if it is a Halloween movie, Christmas movie, or both, the movie is on the list and that’s the end of it. From the animation, to story, to characters, to songs, everything about this movie is delightful and as memorable as holiday movies get.\n\nScore:\n\n8.5/10\n\n1.Happy Feet (2006)\n\nYes, this is technically not a Christmas movie, but it’s on AMC’s December Holiday lineup so it counts. Son of Memphis and Norma, little sweet penguin Mumble has a big problem: he can’t sing a single note. In a world where everyone needs a heart song to attract a soul mate, Mumble feels he doesn’t belong there. Our hero Mumble is the worst singer in the world, but he can tap dance brilliantly. This film absolutely rules! With animation that is spectacular and superb musical numbers, it can get people off of their sofas and start dancing along with it. If I did have one nitpick, it would be that the environmental message can feel a bit forced. Don’t worry, it does not take away from the rest of the great moments the movie has to offer.\n\nScore:\n\n8.5/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today I shall review the best of the best from this past year.\n\nWhile films were harder to produce and distribute than usual, the films we did get turned out to be worthwhile. Whether they came out early or later in the year, if they were well known and looked over, it’s the job of this critic to celebrate those animation highlights.\n\nOver the Moon\n\nWhen Fei Fei (voice of Cathy Ang) was a young girl, her now-deceased mother told her the story of Chang’e, a moon goddess of Chinese mythology who is waiting on the moon for her one and only true love. Her friends and family think it’s just a silly myth, so the 13-year-old girl, who’s a STEM-proficient student, decides to build a rocketship herself so she can find Chang’e and prove the story is true. Directed by Glen Keane, former animator at the House of Mouse, this film was released by Netflix. In my full review of the film, I referred to the animation being as colorful as the World of Color show at Disneyland. The story is well thought out in the first half, but falters in the second half making it a decent, but not great film.\n\nScore:\n\n6/10\n\nThe Willoughbys\n\nConvinced they’d be better off raising themselves, the Willoughby children hatch a sneaky plan to send their selfish parents on vacation. The siblings then embark on their own high-flying adventure to find the true meaning of family. Based on the Lois Lowry book of the same name, this was another Netflix animation release. In my opinion, this is the most underrated film on this list. The film was critically acclaimed, but didn’t receive the praise of other films. It has bright and stylized animation, likeable characters, and a laughably silly plot.\n\nScore:\n\n7/10\n\nOnward\n\nIn a suburban fantasy world, two teenage elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot, go on a journey to discover if there is still a little magic left out there in order to spend one last day with their father, who died when they were too young to remember him. Like any good quest, their journey is filled with magic spells, cryptic maps, impossible obstacles and unimaginable discoveries. When the boys’ fearless mom, Laurel, realizes that her sons are missing, she teams up with the legendary winged-lion-scorpion former warrior — The Manticore — and heads off to find them. Perilous curses aside, this one magical day could mean more than any of them ever dreamed. The tasty Pixar appetizer to later mentioned entree, it was wonderful animation, characters to root for, and emotionally impactful climax.\n\nScore:\n\n7/10\n\nWolfwalkers\n\nIn a time of superstition and magic, a young apprentice hunter, Robyn Goodfellowe, journeys to Ireland with her father to wipe out the last wolf pack. While exploring the forbidden lands outside the city walls, Robyn befriends a free-spirited girl, Mebh, a member of a mysterious tribe rumored to have the ability to transform into wolves by night. As they search for Mebh’s missing mother, Robyn uncovers a secret that draws her further into the enchanted world of the “Wolfwalkers” and it risks turning into the very thing her father is tasked to destroy. This film was directed by Tomm Moore, who had previously directed hidden gems such The Secret of Kells (2009) and Song of the Sea (2014). As someone who loves traditional handdrawn animation, it is very refreshing to see it done extremely well in the modern day. Along with the animation, the film also features great characters and a story full of intriguing Irish lore.\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\nSoul\n\nJoe Gardner is a middle-school band teacher whose life hasn’t quite gone the way he expected. His true passion is jazz — and he’s good. But when he travels to another realm to help a soul, named 22, find their passion, he soon discovers what it means to have a soul. Being the late year entree of Pixar, this is a film that truly lived to its hype. It was directed by Pete Doctor, director of such films like Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015). That should tell you enough if the film will be good. The animation is fantastic, ranging from realistic to stylized, the characters are well-constructed, and the story has so much emotional integrity. It is just a well-thought-out film.\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today I shall review the latest gem in the Pixar archive, Soul.\n\nSoul is a 2020 animated film produced by the aforementioned Pixar animation studios. The film was directed by Pixar veteran and current Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter. He has directed many fantastic films such as Up (2009), Monsters Inc. (2001) and Inside Out (2014). Soul is the first Pixar film to feature an African-American protagonist. Originally intended to be a theatrical release in the United States, the film was released to stream on Disney+ on December 25, 2020 and was theatrically released in countries without the streaming service. It became the first feature-length film from Pixar not to be given a wide theatrical release and the first to be billed as a Disney+ original film. The film received highly positive reviews from critics with praise for its animation, story, voice acting, and music.\n\nJoe Gardner is a middle-school band teacher whose life hasn’t quite gone the way he expected. His true passion is jazz — and he’s good. But when he travels to another realm to help a soul, named 22, find their passion, he soon discovers what it means to have a soul.\n\nThe story of this film not only is beaming with creativity, but it knows how to use that element to its full advantage. First of all, the world that the souls reside in is layed out quite nicely as the souls are created with specific personality traits and sent down to earth to someone who is about to be born. This is known as the great before. There’s also the Great Beyond, where the souls of dead people go to dissolve in a great white abyss. This is where Inside Out meets Coco (2017). Speaking of the former, the one nitpick I tend to hear from other people who have seen this film is that the narrative closely emulates the narrative of the mind movie. While there are some similarities between the two films, this movie in particular has more than enough heart and passion to not be an Inside Out ripoff. My favorite element of the film is when Joe Gardner is playing on his piano and he becomes one with the jazz as the animation bursts with colors and movement. It’s like Soul decided to find its inner Fantasia (1940). Any film that I can remotely compare to Fantasia has my blessing.\n\nThe animation is absolutely wonderful and enormously vivid. The visuals range from detailed and realistic in the real world in which Joe Gardner originally reside in to abstract and original in the world of the souls. Specifically, the backgrounds of the real world are precisely articulated to the finest grain of asphalt to the stain on glass windows. What separates it from full on motion capture is that the humans, specifically their heads, are very stylized. In fact, Joe’s head looks like a football with a face. In the opposite direction, the souls have a basic, but effective design and the world itself has a great use of line and symmetry. It’s a wide range of visuals that create not one, but two elaborate settings that are a pleasure to the human eye.\n\nThe characters are extremely likeable and initially grab the attention of the audience. Our protagonist is named by Joe Gardner (voiced by Jaime Foxx), a passionate jazz pianist and music teacher whose soul gets separated from his body after an open manhole accident. There is 22 (voiced by Tina Fey), a soul trapped in the Great Before with a dim view of life. There’s Terry, the soul counter in the great beyond who tries to get Joe’s soul to go to the great beyond. Though, he fails as Joe continues to dodge him on his quest to cheat death and return to his human body. And then there is Dorothea Williams, a respected jazz musician and saxophone player. It is her band that Joe tries and succeeds to join before his unfortunate accident. The characters are presented with great care and are easily rootable.\n\nPixar, you have done again. The animation is fantastic, ranging from realistic to stylized, the characters are well-constructed, and the story has so much emotional integrity. It is just a well-thought-out film and the best animated film of 2020.\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today I shall review a movie that gave Soul a run for its money: Wolfwalkers.\n\nWolfwalkers is a 2020 animated film produced by Cartoon Saloon, an animation studio based in Ireland. It was directed and written by Tomm Moore. He is the man behind other critically acclaimed work such as Secret of Kells (2009) and Song of the Sea (2014). As a fan of American animation, you might be wondering why I am reviewing a foreign based film. Well, the movie was released digitally on Apple TV+ on December 11, after its initial releases in European countries like Ireland, United Kingdom, Canada, and France. This is the first full length animated feature to be released on the streaming service. It was co-produced and co-released in the United States, so it counts. It received widespread universal acclaim from critics, who praised the animation, emotional depth, performances and characters.\n\nIn a time of superstition and magic, a young apprentice hunter, Robyn Goodfellowe, journeys to Ireland with her father to wipe out the last wolf pack. While exploring the forbidden lands outside the city walls, Robyn befriends a free-spirited girl, Mebh, a member of a mysterious tribe rumored to have the ability to transform into wolves by night. As they search for Mebh’s missing mother, Robyn uncovers a secret that draws her further into the enchanted world of the “Wolfwalkers” and risks turning into the very thing her father is tasked to destroy.\n\nThe story is very well conceived, and takes full advantage of its Irish lore. If you’re looking for a film that spoon feeds you all of the plot lines in the first act of the film, don’t come to this parade. This film knows how to keep your interest in a visual way. As the audience, we uncovered more and more information about this fantastical environment of the wolfwalkers and there is a big twist that will not only change Robyn’s perspective on the wolves, but also her father’s. This may not be the first time that this story line has been presented, but it’s told in such a way that fully conveys the message in a pleasing fashion.\n\nThe animation is absolutely gorgeous. I can’t tell you how sick and tired I am of the lack of hand drawn animated films being produced in the homeland. So when a traditionally animated film actually comes to domestic audiences, it serves as a reminder that CGI is not the only form of this great storytelling medium. One of my favorite parts is when after Robyn has had something eyebrow-raising happen to her, the animation turns more sketch-like and has a great flow of colors and textures. The overall style of the film is unique as the background has a distinctive color transition to greys and browns from the greens and yellows featured in the foreground. Plus, the characters drawn with great personality and every character can emote in a wide variety of ways. The big animation studios should be watching this and learn that transition animation is not out by the waist side.\n\nThe characters of the story are truly what make you care about everything that is taking place in this harsher environment. There is Robyn Goodfellowe, a young apprentice hunter and Bill’s daughter who aspires to kill some wolves until she has a change of mind. There’s Mebh Óg MacTíre, an adventurous wolfwalker and Moll’s daughter who befriends Robyn. Bill Goodfellowe (voiced by Sean Bean), a hunter and Robyn’s father who has orders to kill ever last wolf that resides in the nearby forest to cultivate more farmland. He is my favorite character of the film because he could have been the generic parent who is overbearing on their child and doesn’t see for who they are until the end of the movie, but he is actually caring and even emotionally frail as he only denies Robyn of her wishes because they will not survive in this society if they don’t perform their given duties. There’s Oliver Cromwell, “The Lord Protector” of the land and the villain of the film who won’t stop at anything to destroy the wolves. There’s Moll MacTíre, a wolfwalker, the leader of the wolf pack and Mebh’s mother. She was previously captured by the Kilkenny military and it’s up to Mebh and Robyn to set her free. And then there is Seán Óg Woodcutter, a woodcutter who believes in the existence of the wolfwalkers after they heal him.\n\nAs someone who loves traditional hand drawn animation, it is very refreshing to see it done extremely well in the modern day. Along with the animation, the film also features great characters and a story full of intriguing Irish lore. If you don’t have Apple TV+, start your subscription because it’s worth it to see this movie.\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomation here. Today, I shall review the movie that featured walking bananas before the Minions even existed, The Simpsons Movie.\n\nThe Simpsons Movie is a 2007 animated film based on the popular long-running Fox animated television series The Simpsons (1989–present). Fox Animation Domination is still promoted during the commercial breaks of NFL games. The Simpsons Movie received positive reviews and grossed $536.4 million worldwide and became the eighth highest-grossing film of 2007, the second highest-grossing traditionally animated film (behind Disney’s 1994 film The Lion King) and the highest-ever grossing film based on an animated television series. In August 2018, it was reported that a sequel was in development.\n\nThe film follows Homer Simpson, who irresponsibly pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town has cleaned it up, causing the Environmental Protection Agency to imprison the town under a giant dome. After he and his family narrowly manage to escape, they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness and return to Springfield to prevent the town’s destruction by Russ Cargill, head of the EPA. Soon after his family leaves, Homer works to redeem his folly by returning to Springfield himself to help save the town and its citizens.\n\nThe story of the film feels like a script written for one of the Simpsons episodes that had to be expanded into a full length feature. Because the story isn’t the most deep or complex, the movie is more reliant than ever on the comedy factor. For that reason, the comedy can feel a bit hit or miss. There are good moments, like when Bart Simpson is naked and there are various objects to block his thing before it gets exposed for a split second. That was creative and fits the satirical tone of the Simpsons. There are also bad moments, like when after Homer’s family leaves him, he has an encounter with a mysterious Inuit shaman and has an epiphany that he must save the town in order to save himself. This is one of the several moments where the movie falls into trop potholes (or tropholes for short) and can’t satire itself out of the situation. To be fair, I am not a regular viewer of the Simpsons. In fact, I came into this movie almost blindfolded. So my taste in humor most likely differs from the average Simpsons viewer. With that being said, most viewers of the movie that are not Simpsons buffs will probably feel the same way.\n\nThe animation quality in the film does take a step up from the visual quality in the long-running tv show. Even from not actually watching the show, you could freeze frame one shot from the movie and the tv show and the difference will be noticeable. The backgrounds seemed to have a little detail than its predecessor, but not too much to where the basic scheme of Springfield is unrecognizable. The color display is practically the same as before, which is perfectly fine as it is. The character designs are as cartoonish as before and their facial reactions can ignite a couple of chuckles. If there was one nitpick I have, it is that the moment of the characters can still feel a bit choppy. For instance, when Homer is riding a motorcycle with Bart to travel up the side of the dome that was placed over Springfield, it definitely doesn’t feel as fluid as the action scenes in the How to Train Your Dragon or The Incredibles movies. Overall, the visuals are passable for a feature film and do its job well for a Simpsons movie.\n\nThe characters are practically the same as they were before, which works well to the film’s advantage. The skinny that is worth noting is that a TON of actors voice a TON of characters. Dan Castellaneta voices Homer Simpson (the immature and outspoken patriarch of the family), Abe Simpson (the rambling, often incoherent father of Homer), Krusty the Clown (the cynical clown host of Bart and Lisa’s favorite TV show) among other characters. Julie Kavner voices the Marge Simpson (the moralistic and mediating matriarch of the family), among other characters. Nancy Cartwright voices Bart Simpson (the son of Homer and Marge who is now fed up with his father’s carelessness), Maggie Simpson (the baby of this middle class family) among other characters. Yeardley Smith voices Lisa Simpson (the daughter of Homer and Marge, who is a humongous environmentalist), surprisingly not voicing other characters. But there is Hank Azaria, who voices a whopping 10 characters in the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger is president but not cooked by the Terminator, and Albert Brooks voices Russ Cargill (the villain who wants to control Springfield and the entire world). It’s like how Tom Hanks voiced six characters in The Polar Express (2004), but now you have at least five actors voicing that many characters. And speaking of Tom Hanks, he makes a 10 second cameo as himself selling a new Grand Canyon near Springfield. All on all, there are a lot of characters for a simple premise.\n\nWith a thin, but snear-worthy story, one-step-above-TV-level animation, and characters that are perfectly Simpson-like, this movie can appeal to audiences of the show and to those looking for a quick laugh. Or you can watch the actual show Sunday on FOX.\n\nScore:\n\n6/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomation here. Today, I shall review the film that will get all Christians cozying up by the TV set: The Pirates Who Don’t Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie.\n\nThe Pirates Who Don’t Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie is a 2008 animated film directed by Mike Nawrocki and written by Phil Vischer, who are the creators of the VeggieTales show. It was produced by Big Idea and Starz Animation and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the second theatrical film to feature characters from the VeggieTales video series following Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie in 2002. The film was released on January 11, 2008, and received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the script but praised the animation. The film was also a box office bomb, grossing only $13 million worldwide on a $15 million budget.\n\nThree lazy misfits – very timid Elliot (Larry the Cucumber), lazy Sedgewick (Mr. Lunt) and no self-confident George (Pa Grape) – dream of the day of putting on a show about pirates. With their own problems of might not having this dream come true, they soon find themselves traveling back in time into the 17th century and begin a quest to rescue a royal family from an evil tyrant, and learn about being pirates.\n\nThe story of the film is unbelievably basic, which is fitting since it’s a VeggieTales film. The premise of people being made fun of who have to prove themselves in the face of grave danger has been done to death, but how can I get mad at it? Like other VeggieTales properties, this film carries such an innocent aura around that it is extremely challenging to feel any disapproval towards it. It is like getting mad at Mickey Mouse or Charlie Brown or Popeye the Sailor Man. I mean, would you rather have a story that’s confused and even complex for something that should not be difficult to understand? The one nitpick I would have is this pop song that they throw in out of nowhere when Elliot, George, and Sedgewick are being total slackers while on their quest of Robert the Terrible’s whereabouts. It takes away from the rest of the atmosphere of the film. I care for it.\n\nThe animation is UNBELIEVABLY at the level anyone would expect it to be. Being that the film was released in 2007 and the original show premiered in 1993, it would be inevitable that improvements would be made to the final product. The characters are more properly rendered than before and the backgrounds seemed to have more detail to them. But again, this is VeggieTales. There is much changing and tinkering that will go on something that already has such a prominent identity. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix. The biggest strength of the original show is also the biggest strength of the film. That is the facial expressions on all of the characters. They are expressive and can convey the intended emotion of each character. Because none of the characters have arms or legs (except for Robert the Terrible), the animators could focus their efforts towards the faces and body movements. And it really shows. Now I am not advocating to get rid of all limbs for everyone that happens to be animated, but you can only get mad at people cutting corners when the end result falls short.\n\nThe characters carry out the same likeable and recognizable personas as in previous installments. Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki voice almost all of the characters in the film. Vischer voices George (Pa Grape), Sedgewick (Mr. Lunt), among others. Nawrocki voices Elliot (Larry the Cucumber) among others. For the characters not voiced by the original creators of this veggie phenomenon, there is Robert the Terrible (voiced by Cam Clarke), the villain of the film.And there is Prince Alexander and Princess Eloise, the two spoiled brats that need a trio of cabin boys at their rescuing. Just paraphrasing the film had to say. In all seriousness, the characters definitely do their jobs and were able to get some chuckles here and there.\n\nEven though this is the second VeggieTales movie, it still gave people what they expected. A story that can be a big thin, animation that shines in certain attributes, and characters that have a good heartedness to them, this is a film that was all that it is cracked up to be.\n\nScore:\n\n6/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomation here. Because it is Super Bowl weekend, a weekend full of consuming junk food, I shall review a certain cat that is used to this style of eating: Garfield’s Pet Force.\n\nGarfield’s Pet Force is a 2009 direct to video animated film based on characters from the Jim Davis comic strip Garfield and loosely based on the Pet Force novel series. It is the third and final installment of the trilogy that also includes Garfield Gets Real and Garfield’s Fun Fest. It was written by Garfield creator Jim Davis. The film was produced by Paws, Inc., the company behind Garfield, and was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on June 16, 2009.\n\nNothing in the world can make Garfield get involved in anything besides eating, until the muscular super cat Garzooka comes crashing into Cartoon World from the Comic Book universe with terrifying news. Garfield summons up the willpower to join his superhero Garzooka in a fight to save their worlds.\n\nThe story is clearly for developing minds, as almost every scene can be predicted before it happens. There are some points where the film tries to incorporate a satirical mood just to shake things up, but causes the film to fall completely flat on its face and revert back to its cliched ways. For example, the film mocks the opening text scene in Star Wars except it makes it clear that the text scrolling away from the screen is not integral to the film. This would be humorous if the film would not flat out tell the audience that is not supposed to be taken seriously and let the audience decide for themselves. Show don’t tell? Did 2nd grade not teach you anything? Overall, it made the film into a total snore feast where looking at one’s phone would be their only saving grace.\n\nThe animation clearly had the budget of a direct to video film. The backgrounds are bland with colors that are way too bright and basic. The characters are not rendered very well, and the movements can come across as awkward and ridgedy. Their overall designs are not the most appealing either. In this movie’s defense, it is trying to do the best job to replicate the cartoonish style of the old Garfield comics. Here is the thing, coming across as unpolished can sometimes work in the hand drawn world if it presents some sort of artistic emphasis, but it just comes across as being undisciplined and lazy in the computer animated world.\n\nThe characters are just as predictable as the story and fail to stand out from the rest of the movie’s blandness. There is Garfield (voiced by Frank Welker), the couch potato Lorax himself who is sucked into saving the world without any pleasure. Welker also voiced Garzooka, who is Garfield if he took the same serum that Steve Rogers took to become Captain America. It should be noted that all of the main voice actors voice the regular comic strip characters and their superhero counterparts. Gregg Berger voices Odie and Odious, the dog friend of Garfield and the gang who for some reason does not speak. Seriously, why is it that all of the feline characters can talk but the one canine cannot? Does Garfield feel some sort of detest towards dogs? No one knows. Audrey Wasilewski voices Arlene and Starlena, the love interest of Tigger’s pudgey stepbrother. Jason Marsden voices Nermal and Abnermal, the friend of Garfield who likes to complain and read comics. It is in his comic where the superheroes and villain come out of, so it is his fault that this film even exists. And then there is Vetvix, the villain who wants to take over the world using this gun that can scramble up people and objects that are close in proximity. Also, she looks like the combination of The Man in the Yellow Hat from Curious George and Lady X from Foodfight! Curse this movie for making me reference Foodfight! The film tries to shoehorn a comedic romance between Vetvix and Emperor Jon, the emperor counterpart to Jon Arbuckle who is the human owner of Garfield, but it adds little to nothing to a film lacking substance. Maybe I am not a big fan of the characters because I was never a Garfield fan, but I would like to think otherwise.\n\nGarfield’s Pet Force is a typical direct to video film, with a predictable story, second rate animation, and bland characters. At best, this could serve as background noise for the little. As a movie worth sitting down and concentrating on, I do not think so. Between Tom Brady winning another Super Bowl and this Garfield film being a bad movie, I would say that this Sunday did not bring out a ton of surprises.\n\nScore:\n\n3/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today I shall review the top 5 animated feature films that came from Blue Sky.\n\nIn February 2021, Disney announced that Blue Sky would shut down in April 2021, due to economic issues that have come from COVID-19. Personally, I think it had more to do with the fact that Disney already owns Walt Disney Animation and Pixar, and operating 3 animation studios, even for a company of Disney’s stature, would become a challenge in the long run. Blue Sky was purchased in the Fox acquisition just to beef up Disney’s already lengthy array of content. COVID just served as the straw that broke the camel’s back. With that said, Blue Sky produced 13 feature films, its last being Spies in Disguise, released December 25, 2019. Ice Age and Rio films were the studio’s most successful films, while Horton Hears a Who! and The Peanuts Movie were its most critically praised films. Here is my top 5 list, so let’s get rolling.\n\nHorton Hears a Who! (2008)\n\nBased on the Dr. Seuss book of the same name, Horton the elephant hears a cry from help coming from a speck of dust. Even though he can’t see anyone on the speck, he decides to help it. As it turns out, the speck of dust is home to the Whos, who live in their city of Whoville. Horton agrees to help protect the Whos and their home, but this gives him nothing but torment from his neighbors, who refuse to believe that anything could survive on the speck. Still, Horton stands by the motto that, “After all, a person is a person, no matter how small.” While the film may contain low-brow jokes, lame pop-cultural references, and moments that make wonder as to how they made the final cut, the film offers animation faithful to the original source material and message heart-warming enough to keep the film afloat.\n\nScore:\n\n6.5/10\n\nEpic (2013)\n\nMary Katherine (Amanda Seyfried), or M.K., is a headstrong, spirited teenager who has a strained relationship with her father (Jason Sudeikis). She loses patience with her dad’s tales of unseen people who live in the woods, but when she is magically transported to that mythic realm, she gains a new perspective. M.K. joins a race of beings known as the Leafmen in their battle to protect their queen (Beyoncé Knowles) from their enemies, evil Mandrake (Christoph Waltz) and his crew of Boggans. The film is adapted loosely on William Joyce’s 1996 children’s book The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs. While the story and characters are a bit predictable, the film features some of the best animation the studio has put out and presents an environment that the audience will want to delve into.\n\nScore:\n\n7/10\n\nRio (2011)\n\nCaptured by smugglers when he was just a hatchling, a macaw named Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) never learned to fly and lives a happily domesticated life in Minnesota with his human friend, Linda. Blu is thought to be the last of his kind, but when word comes that Jewel (Anne Hathaway), a lone female, lives in Rio de Janeiro, Blu and Linda go to meet her. Animal smugglers kidnap Blu and Jewel, but the pair soon escape and begin a perilous adventure back to freedom — and Linda. With colorful visuals, catchy songs, and a nice atmosphere, this film is one that people should check out if they haven’t already watched it.\n\nScore:\n\n7.5/10\n\nThe Peanuts Movie (2015)\n\nLife always seems complicated for good ol’ Charlie Brown (Noah Schnapp), the boy who always tries his best against seemingly impossible odds. When the Little Red-Haired Girl moves into his neighborhood, Charlie Brown develops a crush on her. Meanwhile, his best friend Snoopy embarks on an epic adventure in a fantasy world. As a World War I flying ace, the lovable beagle pursues his nemesis, the Red Baron, while also trying to win the heart of a beautiful poodle named Fifi (Kristin Chenoweth). The film is based on Charles M. Schulz’s comic strip Peanuts. With fantastic visuals, great characters, and simple, yet heartfelt story, this is adaptation that treats its source material with respect and dignity.\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\n1.Ice Age (2002)\n\nOn Earth 20,000 years ago, everything was covered in ice. A group of friends, Manny, a mammoth, Diego, a saber tooth tiger, and Sid, a sloth encounter an Eskimo human baby. They must try to return the baby back to his tribe before a group of saber tooth tigers find him and eat him. Also, a saber-toothed squirrel named Scrat tries to find a safe-haven for his pesky acorn. Just like Toy Story for Pixar or Shrek for DreamWorks, this is the film that put Blue Sky on the map. With well-done animation, intriguing characters, and an amusing adventure, it’s only fair to call it the best Blue Sky film ever made!\n\nScore:\n\n8/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomation here. Today I shall review a movie with intelligence and brilliance: Space Jam.\n\nSpace Jam is a 1996 live action and animation hybrid produced by Warner Bros. Feature Animation. The film stars Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny. What an odd combination. Well if you can’t even handle that much, then getting through this movie with any common sense will be tough to accomplish.\n\nSwackhammer (Danny DeVito), an evil alien theme park owner, needs a new attraction at Moron Mountain. When his gang, the Nerdlucks, heads to Earth to kidnap Bugs Bunny (Billy West) and the Looney Tunes, Bugs challenges them to a basketball game to determine their fate. The aliens agree, but they steal the powers of NBA basketball players, including Larry Bird (Larry Bird) and Charles Barkley (Charles Barkley) — so Bugs gets some help from superstar Michael Jordan (Michael Jordan).\n\nObviously, this is a very story-driven film. In the sense that it’s story doesn’t drive very often. This has gotta be one of the most outlandish narratives ever put into an animated film. Michael Jordan? The Looney Tunes? Team up in a basketball game? I mean, this entire film was created based on two Nike ads in the early 90’s that featured the two main characters. But this is the Looney Tunes. So giving them a narrative that would be showcased in a Pixar movie would feel out of place. With that being said, the only way to get into the story is to go in without a care in the world. The two things that I did not care for in the narrative both involved Michael Jordan. First, the movie tries to portray Jordan as this guy who feels lost as he struggles in baseball and is not playing the sport he truly loves. Those scenes have an easy time being recycled and an absolute snore fest. The second is that the movie makes believe that it was because of the Looney Tunes, SPOILER ALERT!, that Michael Jordan came back to basketball. I know the movie plays it off as being fictional, but it still makes Jordan look silly as he needed a bunch of cartoon characters to get him back to the fane that he loves.\n\nWith this live action and animation hybrid, I can only talk about half of this film in this department. So take that for what it’s worth. The first to get across is that the Looney Tunes are animated in CGI and not their usual hand drawn animation. Which for the most part, actually works out pretty well. Their movements are delightfully over the top, the designs almost mirror the designs of their 2D counterparts, and the characters are able to show enough facial expressions to keep the younglings entertained. Why do I say just the younglings and not the entire family? That will be explained in the characters section. The aliens also carry the same qualities as the Looney Tunes. The one nitpick I would have is that the interactions between the animated characters and the live action characters can feel a bit funky. Unlike in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1998), where every character felt like they were in Toontown, here it feels like the Looney Tunes should be over a computer generated backdrop and not in the real world.\n\nThe characters were definitely the most disappointing part of the feature. In a film that is supposed to be built off of its humor. And because this is not a story driven film, the characters have carry the bulk of the enjoyment. But the thing is that the characters are NOT funny. As I alluded to before, the scenes that feature just Michael Jordan are not engaging as it feels like he us acting for a commercial than an actual movie. It’s one thing to not have Michael Jordan not be funny. I mean, he is an athlete by trade and you can only expect so much out of him. But how could you make the LOONEY TUNES not be funny? They are the definition of comedy gold, with their amazing slapstick and witty dialogue. Well, you won’t find any of that here. But hey, at least their are low brow jokes that you would find in an Illumination film. And don’t forget about the Lola jokes, who is not only the sex symbol of the movie but is also a bunny. Movie, is there something we need to talk about?\n\nOverall, Space Jam is a mess of a film that could have been uniquely enjoyable, but could not execute on a proper level. The story is absolute bonkers, and because the characters are can’t save the movie, the entire feature goes downhill from there. The animation can be fun to watch, but not enough to make too much of an overarching impact. If you are in the mood for something mindless, this could do the job. But don’t be looking to gain any brain cells from watching this movie.\n\nScore:\n\n5.5/10\n\nHowdy guys, Anthomaton here. Today, I shall review one of the many by-products of Hollywood’s incapability to come up with original content: Tom and Jerry.\n\nTom and Jerry is a 2021 animated film based on the cartoon characters and animated theatrical short film series of the same name created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. It is the second fully theatrical film adaptation of the characters following 1992’s Tom and Jerry: The Movie, and is directed by Tim Story and written by Kevin Costello. Originally announced as a live-action/computer-animated film in 2009, the film languished in development hell for several years. Plans eventually shifted to producing an entirely animated film, in the same vein as the original theatrical shorts, in 2015. The film again became a live-action/animated hybrid in 2018, with animation produced by the Warner Animation Group, and filming beginning in 2019. Tom"
