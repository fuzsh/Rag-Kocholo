There’s also a “psychodrama” that involves author Shirley Jackson and stars Elisabeth Moss; a horror movie from director Justin Simien about a weave with nefarious intent; and a sci-fi assassin movie written and directed by David Cronenberg’s son, Brandon, and stars Sundance essential Andrea Riseborough.
