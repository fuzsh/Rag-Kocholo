        "text": "On behalf of my colleagues on the Mansfield University Foundation board, thank you for the tremendous support you gave us this past year. By numerous accounts, this was an outstanding year for the Foundation. It is private gifts – and the fact that alumni, current and retired Mansfield employees, businesses, foundations, organizations and Mansfield friends’ giving has increased - that has enabled us to provide increasing support to Mansfield University for enhancements that are not possible through the University’s operating budget, including scholarships for deserving students. Indeed, the Foundation provided 20% more scholarships this year than last for the highest total in our history. Our students and their families join us in thanking you for investing in tomorrow’s leaders. Total gifts received increased 50% over last year making <strong>2005</strong> – 20<strong>06</strong> the best year in total gifts since 2002. But it was not only your gifts that increased, it was your generous support of our multi-year effort to raise endowment dollars through Mansfield’s first-ever comprehensive campaign. Eighteen new endowments were created throughout the year and numerous planned gifts such as bequests, charitable gift annuities and life insurance policies have ensured future growth particularly for scholarships and cultural outreach to enable Mansfield University to better serve campus and community. Comparing this year to last year, of particular note are the following: • alumni average gifts increased 12% • corporate support nearly tripled • total faculty gifts increased more than 35% • Dr. Samuel Garloff ‘69 and Bobbi Kilmer ‘84 joined the Foundation Board Please help us to welcome our new Board members, and to honor Honorary Board member Dr. Marcella May Hyde-Smith 56. We have one more year to complete the campaign and to meet our goal of increasing Mansfield’s endowment. You have our most sincere appreciation for your campaign, your annual, and your unrestricted support. Each and every gift strengthens Mansfield University now and helps to prepare MU for the next 150 years. <strong>Sincerely</strong>, <strong>Ronald</strong> G. <strong>Goodwin</strong> ’72 <strong>President</strong>, <strong>2005</strong>-<strong>06</strong> Mansfield University Foundation <strong>2005</strong>-<strong>06</strong> Report to Donors • 1"
