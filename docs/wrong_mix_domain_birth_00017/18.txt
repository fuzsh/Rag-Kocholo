President William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States and the sixth man from Ohio to occupy that office. He was born here in Niles Ohio in 1843 as the seventh child of William and Nancy McKinley. After serving in the Civil War, McKinley would go on to become a congressman and Speaker of the House. After losing his seat in 1890, he came back to Ohio and became governor and served 2 terms. In 1896 McKinley was elected President and easily won a second term to the office, but did not complete this second term. While attending an exposition in Buffalo New York, William McKinley was shot and killed.

William McKinley was entombed in Canton Ohio at what has become the McKinley National Memorial.

The McKinley Birthplace Memorial was dedicated in 1917 by another native Ohioan and former President, William Howard Taft.

The McKinley Birthplace Memorial includes a library, museum and research center.

McKinley Birthplace Home and Research Center

President William McKinley's childhood home was a small home located in Niles. He was born here in 1843. The original 2-story house was moved twice before it was destroyed by fire in 1937. In later years a bank was built over the original site. That land was donated and the bank was demolished and a loose replica of his home was built. The new structure is larger and slightly resembles his original childhood home. The house includes a library of McKinley Memorabilia and gift shop.
