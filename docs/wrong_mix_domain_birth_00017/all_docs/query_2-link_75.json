        "text": "Profession: 25th US President\n\nPolitical Party: Republican\n\nPolitical Titles: Governor of Ohio\n\nPresidential Term: March 4, 1897 - September 14, 1901\n\nPreceded By: Grover Cleveland\n\nSucceeded By: Theodore Roosevelt\n\nBiography: McKinley previously served as the Governor of Ohio before becoming the 25th President of the United States. He served as president from March 4, 1897, until his assassination in September 1901, six months into his second term.\n\nMcKinley won the presidency during a time of deep economic depression, and rapid economic recovery was the hallmark of his term. McKinley supported tariffs, such as the Dingley Tariff in 1897, which helped protect manufacturers from foreign competition. He also maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals.\n\nIn foreign affairs he led the nation in the Spanishâ€“American War, which ended in a decisive American victory and gained the nation control of the Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. In 1898 the US annexed the Kingdom of Hawaii and it became a US territory.\n\nIn 1900 McKinley won re-election. Six months into his term, on September 6, 1901, he was shot by Leon Czolgosz, a Polish-American anarchist. He died eight days later and was succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nBorn: January 29, 1843\n\nBirthplace: Niles, Ohio, USA\n\nStar Sign: Aquarius"
