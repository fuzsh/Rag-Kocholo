        "text": "William McKinley was born on January 29, 1843, in Niles, Ohio. He attended college for a few months, taught school, and worked in a post office. During 1861–65 McKinley fought in the American Civil War.\n\nAfter the war McKinley studied law. McKinley married Ida Saxton in 1871. The couple had two children, but they both died.\n\nIn 1876 McKinley was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. He served for six terms. From 1892 to 1896 McKinley was the governor of Ohio.\n\nIn 1896 the Republican Party chose McKinley to run for president. After defeating his opponent, William Jennings Bryan, McKinley became president on March 4, 1897.\n\nDuring McKinley’s presidency many people wanted the United States to help Cuba gain independence from Spain. Congress declared war in April 1898. The United States easily defeated the Spanish forces in a few months. The Spanish-American War ended with a treaty that gave Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States. Cuba became independent.\n\nThe successful war and a good economy made McKinley very popular. He won reelection in 1900. Theodore Roosevelt became vice president. (McKinley’s first vice president, Garret A. Hobart, had died.) During McKinley’s second term, he proposed trade agreements with other countries to lower the taxes charged on each other’s goods.\n\nIn 1901 McKinley attended the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. While the president was meeting with the public, a man in the crowd shot him in the chest and stomach. The president died eight days later, on September 14, 1901."
