        "text": "Public transport system around Adelaide, Australia\n\nAdelaide MetroParentGovernment of South AustraliaFounded23 April 2000HeadquartersAdelaideService areaAdelaideService typeBus (Includes O-Bahn), Tram & TrainOperatorTorrens Transit\n\nBusways\n\nKeolis Downer (SouthLink)Websiteadelaidemetro.com.au\n\nAdelaide Metro is the public transport system of the Adelaide area, around the capital city of South Australia. It is an intermodal system offering an integrated network of bus, tram, and train services throughout the metropolitan area. The network has an annual patronage of 79.9 million, of which 51 million journeys are by bus, 15.6 million by train, and 9.4 million by tram.[1] The system has evolved heavily over the past fifteen years, and patronage increased dramatically during the 2014–15 period, a 5.5 percent increase on the 2013 figures due to electrification of frequented lines.[2][3]\n\nAdelaide Metro began in 2000 with the privatisation of existing government-operated bus routes. The Glenelg tram line is the only one of Adelaide's tramways to survive the 1950s and the only one to be integrated into the current system. Services are now run by two private operators[dubious – discuss] and united with common ticketing systems, marketing, liveries and signage under the supervision of the state government's Department for Infrastructure and Transport. Since the 2010s, energy sustainability and eco-friendly transport has been a major focus for Adelaide Metro. Hence, the fleet has been progressively upgraded with electric trains and solar-powered buses–one of which, known as the Tindo electric bus, is 100% solar powered and the first of its kind in the world.[4][5] Despite this, as of 2016, almost 80 percent of Adelaide's metropolitan buses still run on diesel fuel rather than biodiesel or batteries.[6]\n\nAdelaide Metro has faced criticism for punctuality issues, \"unreliable\" services, ageing buses and incidents of severely coarse language, racism, and assault on some lines.[7] The complaints increased since the system switched to a private operator in October 2011. Adelaide Metro received 7,562 feedback reports–more than 40 a day–in 2012. In order to counteract these problems and increase accountability, performance data will now be published weekly as opposed to quarterly by Adelaide Metro. This will highlight how trains and buses are performing in terms of punctuality and service, as well as comparisons to interstate public transport. The 2014 service figures indicate that the system performed slightly better in 2014 than it did the previous year.[8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Adelaide Metro is a brand introduced in April 2000, following the second round of tenders privatisation of formerly government-operated bus services.[9][10]\n\nThe public transport system in Adelaide has previously been known under several names. The State Transport Authority was formed in 1974, combining the metropolitan rail operations of the former South Australian Railways Commission, and the bus and tram operations of the former Municipal Tramways Trust. Adelaide removed almost all tramlines from the 1930s to 1958 leaving only the Glenelg line. This tramline was extended in 2007 by the Department of Transport, Energy & Infrastructure (DTEI), and again to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in 2010. In July 1994, the STA was abolished and government public transport services were transferred to TransAdelaide, a publicly owned corporation.\n\nIn 1995–96, there was a partial tendering of the bus services. TransAdelaide retained three contract regions, Serco won two contract regions, and Hills Transit a joint venture between Australian Transit Enterprises and TransAdelaide, one.[11][12] Services were run and marketed under each operator's name, presenting a disjointed network to the public.\n\nThe 2000 round of tenders ended TransAdelaide's direct operation of bus services, while retaining the train and tram services. Serco won the North-South, Outer North, and Outer North-East contract areas. SouthLink won the Outer South contract area. Torrens Transit won the East-West contract area. City Free services and Transitplus, a joint venture between Australian Transit Enterprises and TransAdelaide, won the Hills contract area.[12] The Adelaide Metro brand was applied across all transport operators, appearing to the public as a unified network, with common livery, timetable designs and a city Information Centre.\n\nEnvironmental Incentives\n\n[edit]\n\nThe State Government has pledged that the Adelaide Metro would use cleaner fuels like biodiesel and natural gas in an effort to make Adelaide a carbon neutral city. In 2016, nearly 80 percent of the Adelaide Metro buses ran on diesel, which is harmful for the environment due to the presence of sulfur.[6] In 2023, the state government announced that a feasibility study was underway to replace Adelaide Metro's ageing diesel train fleet with zero-emission technology.[13]\n\nServices\n\n[edit]\n\nBuses\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Buses in Adelaide\n\nThe largest element of Adelaide's public transport system is a fleet of diesel and natural gas powered buses. The majority of services terminate in the Adelaide city centre, suburban railway stations or shopping centre interchanges. As contracts are revised for privatised bus operations, more cross suburban routes are added to the network. In the past, bus routes were largely focused on moving passengers from the suburbs to the CBD.\n\nA major component of the Adelaide Metro bus service is the O-Bahn guided busway to Modbury, carrying around 9 million passengers a year. From its opening in 1986 until August 2011 it was the world's longest busway, with a length of 12 kilometres (7.5 mi). It remains the world's fastest busway with a maximum permitted speed of 100 km/h (62 mph). Away from the O-Bahn, whilst there have been dedicated bus lanes and bus-only signal phases at some traffic lights provided for a number of years, a major improvement to bus priority and reliability arrived with the delivery in July 2012 of the CBD Bus Lane project.[14]\n\nAdelaide Metro buses are split up geographically into six contract regions:\n\nRegion Operator (until June 2020)[15] Operator (from July 2020)[16] Comments North-South Torrens Transit Torrens Connect Torrens Connect have an integrated bus and light rail contract, which includes the Free City Connector bus, O-Bahn services and the Glenelg tram line East-West Torrens Transit Torrens Transit Outer North-East Torrens Transit Torrens Transit Outer South SouthLink Busways Outer North SouthLink Torrens Transit Hills SouthLink SouthLink\n\nThe new contracts began in July 2020 for a period of eight years, with an option to extend for two years.[17]\n\nFormer operators which had operated Adelaide Metro services in the past but no longer operate in Adelaide are:\n\nSerco – ended its contract in 2004, at the contracted half-term break-point, after failing to renegotiate its contract on better terms. Serco had previously informed the Minister for Transport that it was not willing to continue to operate the bus services for a further five years on the terms contained in the then existing Contract. Serco had made a submission to the Department of Transport & Urban Planning proposing to operate the bus services in the contract areas on new terms and conditions. The submission was rejected and the contracts retendered.[12][18]\n\nTransitplus – following the abolition of joint owner TransAdelaide in late 2010, Transitplus services were taken over by joint owner Australian Transit Enterprises' SouthLink.\n\nLight-City Buses – operated the North-South and Outer North East contract areas, including the 300 Suburban Connector and O-Bahn services, from 2011 until its purchase by Torrens Transit in 2018.[19][20]\n\nTrains\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Railways in Adelaide\n\nThe Adelaide suburban railway network consists of six lines operated by Keolis Downer under contract to the Government of South Australia since January 2021.[21][22] In 2023, the state government announced that rail services would return to public ownership in January 2025, fulfilling an election commitment by the South Australian Labor Party.[23]\n\nUntil 2014, the suburban network was the only one in Australia to operate solely with diesel railcars. Between 2013–2014, the full lengths of the Seaford and Tonsley lines were electrified, as well as the adjacent segment of the Belair line from Goodwood to its terminus at Adelaide.[24] Electric trains have run on the Seaford and Tonsley lines since 2014. Although the original plans were to electrify the remaining three lines, they were abandoned in 2012.[25] The Gawler line was electrified in 2022.\n\nAs at July 2019, the fleet consists of 70 3000/3100 class diesel railcars and 22 three-carriage 4000 class electric multiple units.[26] All remaining 2000/2100 class train cars were retired from service in August 2015.\n\nAdelaide's rail lines all run into Adelaide railway station in the CBD. They are:\n\nLine Length First service Information Electrified Map Belair 21.5 km (13.36 mi) 1883 Adelaide to Bridgewater opened 1883, Belair to Bridgewater closed 1987.

The majority of the line is on a dedicated corridor though the western suburbs, and travels on roadway in the city from the terminus to South Terrace and along Jetty Road in Glenelg.\n\nAn extension of the line from Victoria Square down King William Street then along North Terrace opened in October 2007.[27] A further extension along Port Road to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre opened in December 2009. The line has stops adjacent to key city points, including Rundle Mall, the Adelaide Railway Station and the City West campus of the University of South Australia.[28][29]\n\nA 2018 extension added stops adjacent to more key locations including the Festival Theatre, the Art Gallery, the University of Adelaide and the Adelaide Botanic Garden.[30] Construction this new junction, branch lines along the eastern end of North Terrace and King William Road and four new stops began in July/August 2017 and opened in October 2018.[31] There is no fare charged on certain sections of the line.\n\nThe line is operated from Glengowrie depot, with 15 Bombardier Flexity Classic trams built between 2005 and 2010[32] and nine Alstom Citadis trams that were built for, but were surplus to their needs of Metro Ligero, Madrid in 2009.[33][34][35] The latter were modified by Yarra Trams' Preston Workshops before entering service. A further three unused former Madrid Citadis trams entered service in 2018.[36][37]\n\nIn July 2019, the government announced the provision of tram services would be contracted out.[38] Torrens Connect began operating the trams in July 2020.[16] As part of an election commitment, the government announced in 2023 that tram services would return to public ownership by July 2025.[23]\n\nInterchanges\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Adelaide Metro, interchanges \"provide convenient connections between buses and trains. Many also feature Park 'n' Ride services and bike storage.\"[39]\n\nAberfoyle Interchange – Located in the southern suburbs at the Aberfoyle Hub Shopping Centre with connections to Chandlers Hill, the City and Old Reynella\n\nArndale Interchange – Located in the north western suburbs at the Arndale Central Shopping Centre\n\nBlackwood Interchange – Located in the south eastern suburbs in the Adelaide Hills and provides train transfers from the Belair line with bus connections to Upper Sturt, Stirling, Crafers and Aldgate\n\nCrafers Park 'n' Ride Interchange – Located in the Adelaide Hills, connections available to Piccadilly, Stirling, Mount Barker and Blackwood\n\nElizabeth Interchange – Located in Adelaide's northern suburbs and interconnects train services on the Gawler line with bus services to areas around metropolitan Adelaide including Salisbury North, Salisbury, Munno Para, and Smithfield\n\nFlinders University and Flinders Medical Centre – Located in the mid-southern suburbs, these two interchanges (located close together) connect to Marion Interchange, City, Glenelg and the Outer-South.\n\nGlanville Interchange – Located at the bottom of Semaphore Road and provides bus and train transfers from the Outer Harbor line to Port Adelaide, and Osborne\n\nGolden Grove Village – Located in the Outer North-East, may services from the O-Bahn continue to here and connect to Salisbury, Greenwith and Fairview Park\n\nKlemzig Interchange – Located in the inner north-eastern suburbs with bus connections to Oakden and the Circle Line.

In September 1987, the Metroticket system developed by Crouzet was introduced.[40][41] This used magnetic strip technology. In 2010, a contract to introduce the metroCARD smartcard ticketing system was awarded to Affiliated Computer Services.[42] It was rolled out in November 2012.[43] The older system was phased out in 2015.\n\nIn 2021, as part of a staged upgrade to Adelaide Metro's ticketing system, contactless payments have been rolled out on all trams, allowing passengers to use debit and credit cards to pay for fares.[44] In 2022, this roll-out continued on O-Bahn bus services, and as of 2023, is now rolling out network-wide, including all remaining buses, and trains.[45][46]\n\nIn 2024, Adelaide Metro released the Adelaide Metro Buy & Go App, this app allows passengers to buy tickets to be used on Buses, Tram and train leaving the Adelaide Railway Station. The app will be rolled out to all train users by late 2025\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nBuses in Adelaide\n\nCommuter rail in Australia\n\nmetroCARD\n\nO-Bahn Busway\n\nRailways in Adelaide\n\nRail transport in South Australia\n\nState Transport Authority, South Australia\n\nTrams in Adelaide\n\nTransport in Adelaide\n\nTransport in South Australia\n\nTransAdelaide\n\nList of public transport routes in Adelaide\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
