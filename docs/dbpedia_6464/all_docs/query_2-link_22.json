        "text": "Continuing our 60th anniversary celebrations, we look back each month at a mile stone project. July’s Reflection Year: 2008 Project: TransAdelaide Toilet, South Park Lands, Adelaide Client: TransAdelaide … Sometimes the memorable projects are small. In 2008 DASH was asked to design a toilet facility for tram divers in the rail corridor that dissects Adelaide’s south Park Lands. The project presented many challenges: The complexity of work within an electrified rail corridor; a prominent Park Lands setting; vulnerability to graffiti; access for maintenance; and the potentially archetypal design responses for facilities of this nature. As remains the case today, there was also considerable debate regarding the appropriateness of buildings in the Park Lands. The project's outcome demonstrates one of the design tenets of DASH: take potential problems and celebrate them as features. A deliberately simple form, with the entrances concealed from view, was emblazoned with a ‘daisy fresh’ graphic that playfully questioned how architecture should respond to function and context. The daisies both whimsically reference while also belie the building's use. The daisies deliberately respond to their Park Lands setting in a cliched manner, while also being prominently out of scale and in contrast to their rail corridor setting. The daisies discourage graffiti, are very low maintenance, while also putting a smile on our face every time we drive past them some 16 years later. We hope they have the same effect on others. … #daisyfresh #adelaideparklands #dasharchitects #60years\n\nContinuing our 60th anniversary celebrations, we look back each month at a mile stone project. Elder Hall is the University of Adelaide’s second oldest building and Australia’s first Conservatorium of Music. In 2017 DASH Architects was engaged to remove the 1961 rear addition to the hall and restore its facade back to its original form, but with a new performer’s entrance. Extensive research was required to determine the original configuration of this facade, as most historic photos were of other elevations. Extensive traditional stone reconstruction was necessary, with the final outcome including a new contemporary rear entrance that celebrates the buildings use, drawing visual references from the historic organ within. The project is one that we remain very proud of, and went on to win the 2019 David Saunders Heritage Award Australian Institute of Architects (SA Chapter) June’s Reflection Year: 2019 Project: Elder Hall, University of Adelaide Client: University of Adelaide Awards: 2019 David Saunders Heritage Award, Australian Institute of Architects (SA Chapter) … #universityofadelaide #elderhall #heritagesa #sarahconstructions #dasharchitects #adlarchitecture #60years\n\nContinuing our 60th anniversary celebrations, we look back each month at a mile stone project. This month's selection is 115 King William Street. Accommodating a 24 storey office building, on a site only 12m wide and 28m deep presented many challenges. Maximising NLA yields while providing necessary sheer residence in a tall slender structure, required a coordinated approach from the design team that included PT Design (structural), Lucid Consulting Australia (Services) and RLB (costs). At the time 115KWS was ground breaking for a site of these dimensions, with the landmark building’s construction being a credit Synergy Construct. DASH Architects’ interiors team also designed the fit-out of several of the floors within the building, showcasing our expertise maximising the sense of space in challenging and tight floor plates.

To celebrate we look back each month at a milestone project. With the South Australian History Festival in May we felt it appropriate to reflect on our restoration of the iconic Beehive Corner Building. A wonderful project facilitated by the Adelaide City Council who coordinated the agreement between the individual owners to see the facade restored back to its historic glory, including the replacement of the missing bee sitting atop its hive to the corner.
