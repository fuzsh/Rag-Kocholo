        "text": "Transport officials have this week been questioned about the delivery of new public transport services to the Adelaide Hills and the prospect of reinstating passenger rail to Mount Barker.\n\nDespite recent doubt over Spanish train manufacturer Talgo’s proposal for a high-speed rail trial through the region, officials said during parliament’s Budget and Finance committee meeting on Monday, that Government is making progress on a business case for mass transit options in the Adelaide Hills.\n\nInfrastructure SA recommended investing in better bus services to the Adelaide Hills instead of investing in rail as the estimated cost would be $250 million.\n\nThe independent infrastructure assessment agency said the journey between Mount Barker and Adelaide would take 71 minutes and the frequency of services would be once every 30 minutes as the trains would have to share the tracks with freight trains.\n\nDespite this there has been push from community leaders to re-examine the prospect of rail, including from Independent Member for Kavel Dan Cregan. A feasibility of passenger rail to Mount Barker is being considered once again by the State Government through its Adelaide Hills Transport Study.\n\nThe news follows the announcement last month that the State Government will spend $19 million this year to add 590 new bus services per week to the Adelaide Hills.\n\nPublic feedback on the Hills Transport Study will be released “soon” according to the State Government."
