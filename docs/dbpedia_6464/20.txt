Adelaide is an easy city to get around in. Public transport provides access for visitors to most major areas in both the city square mile and the suburbs. Taxis are plentiful, too.

Within the city square mile, you have a variety ol alternatives. Hire a bicycle, or take it easy in a pedicab. Join a coach tour or do it in style in a chauffeur-driven limousine. Or step back in time with a horse-drawn hansom cab. And being relatively flat, Adelaide is ideal for walking.

A good range of guided half day and day coach tours are available - the staff at the South Australian Travel Centre will help you select one to suit.
