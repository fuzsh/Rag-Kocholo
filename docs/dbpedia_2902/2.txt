"We could walk to everything we needed, including a beautiful trail. The service was exceptional, and all the employees were so friendly. The hotel had the best complimentary breakfast I've ever had, and The Crepe restaurant downstairs was excellent. This place is a gem.2016-10-11"

"A wonderful experience. This was our 2nd stay at this hotel. All the employees are polite and helpful.2019-10-30"

"I requested a room away from the noisy elevator and ice machine, and got a room right across from the elevator and near the ice machine. I had to call and request a different room. On the plus side, I left my clothes in the closet and the hotel clerk mailed them all to me. No complimentary breakfast despite the high room rates. Parking cost $26 a night.2016-08-11"

"Great hotel room with a steampunk vibe in the decor. The bed faced the window rather than the wall TV, which we appreciated. There was a cozy sofa in the room, which was quite nice. Everything was clean and comfortable.2023-01-01"

"The beds were small. There was hair on the toilet and in the sink, and the garbage can hadn't been emptied. The valet parking wasn't good; the valet ignored me for 3 minutes while he was using his phone; we had to pay $45 plus tax, then park our car ourselves. Run away from this motel. 2023-05-03"

Hotel Booking Tips

Beware of non-refundable reservations that could cost you a lot of money if you change or cancel them. +Non-refundable reservations are a gamble that will usually save you less than $10. If you make a $90 non-refundable reservation instead of a $100 refundable booking, you are betting $90 to win $10. Would you do that in Las Vegas? -

Don't assume you can cancel a non-refundable reservation without penalty if you notify the hotel weeks or even months in advance. +Often you cannot  because some hotels' profit strategy is to get paid more than once for the same room for the same night. -

Always read cancellation policies carefully before you make a reservation. + When is the latest date and time you can cancel without penalty? -

More >

When you make a reservation, you will receive a confirmation email. Take a copy with you to the hotel.

The earlier in the afternoon you check into a hotel, the more likely you will get a room or suite that matches your preferences.
