Consult the schedules above or our trip planner to plan your trip.\n\nNote: We've added another Rail track! The platform closest to the stadium is for Southbound trains and riders must cross the tracks at designated crossings to hop on Northbound trains. On gamedays, CapMetro staff can guide riders to the correct train.\n\nBy CapMetro Bus\n\nWe're increasing frequency on game days for routes near Q2 Stadium. Even if the following routes aren't near you, there are plenty of ways to connect in our system by other routes or through the two nearby Park & Rides."
