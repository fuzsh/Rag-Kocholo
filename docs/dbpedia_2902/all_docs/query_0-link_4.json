        "meta_description": "47 reviews and 48 photos of AMTRAK \"Train travelers are a dying breed in America.  So go do it while you still can.  I mean, say you want to go see the Marfa lights in West Texas?  There is no airport within reasonable distance.  You could drive your own car out there, but think of the possibility of becoming catatonic behind the wheel, or getting stranded in the middle of nowhere with no cell service.  \n\nTake the Amtrak Texas Eagle to San Antonio (don't stay on it or you'll end up in Illinois), then the Sunset Limited westward to Alpine, from where you can take a special bus to several locations in West Texas.  About $60 each way, but if you can finagle it, name your price as low as you desire.  (Things don't seem very standardized with Amtrak.)  You can sleep, walk around, and even play your guitar while on the train.  You can't do that while driving. \n\nIf you're the adventurous type, go Amtrak.\n\np.s. The only pro to driving is that it's about twice as fast.  And don't go walking the neighborhood around the San Antonio train station - you will likely get mugged or beaten up.\"",
