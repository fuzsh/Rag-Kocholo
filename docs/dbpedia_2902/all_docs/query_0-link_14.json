There was hair on the toilet and in the sink, and the garbage can hadn't been emptied. The valet parking wasn't good; the valet ignored me for 3 minutes while he was using his phone; we had to pay $45 plus tax, then park our car ourselves.

If you make a $90 non-refundable reservation instead of a $100 refundable booking, you are betting $90 to win $10. Would you do that in Las Vegas? -\n\nDon't assume you can cancel a non-refundable reservation without penalty if you notify the hotel weeks or even months in advance. +Often you cannot  because some hotels' profit strategy is to get paid more than once for the same room for the same night. -\n\nAlways read cancellation policies carefully before you make a reservation. + When is the latest date and time you can cancel without penalty? -\n\nMore >\n\nWhen you make a reservation, you will receive a confirmation email. Take a copy with you to the hotel.\n\nThe earlier in the afternoon you check into a hotel, the more likely you will get a room or suite that matches your preferences.\n\n< Less"
