        "text": "[OK, not sure whether this should be in the Amtrak forum or the \"non-rail\" forum, but I'm putting in the Amtrak forum because it focuses on car rentals at Amtrak stations.]\n\nSo you've arrived somewhere after your pleasant relaxed, on-time ( ) Amtrak ride, and you want to know how you can get a rental car. Here are some of my experiences. They may or may not be up-to-date, as some of these happened a decade ago or more.\n\nMy most frequent use of rental cars is at Boston South Station, as I rent almost every winter for my New England cross-country ski trip. There's no rental counter at South Station. At first, I used Hertz, as they have (or had?) a partnership with Amtrak and you got 150 AGR points per rental. However, you had to take a taxi to the closest Hertz office, which was in the Boston Park Plaza hotel in Back Bay. Hertz would reimburse your cab fare from the station, but it didn't reimburse cab fare from the rental office back to the station. Eventually, I swi8ched to Enterprise, mainly because they pick you up and drop you off. I did it first at their government center office, which was very convenient to the on-ramp for the Big Dig going north. Then they told me that if I wanted a ride from South Station, I needed to use their South Boston office. That one's not so bad, either, and I get to stop for a lobster roll at Yankee Lobster before I hit the highway.\n\nWhen I arrive, I go up to the Metropolitan Lounge and call Enterprise. I leave my bags with the redcap downstairs. When Enterprise arrives, I go down and have the redcap wheel out my stuff to the front door where the car is waiting. The Boston redcaps are great, and the service is well worth the tip, as I'm usually hauling around a small wheelie, a large wheelie, my skis, and my daypack. Enterprise drives you the 5 minutes to their office where you do the paperwork, and you're off.\n\nUpon return, there's a gas station right around the corner from the rental agency, so you can easily fill your tank right before you return your car. When I have checked baggage, I go to the station before I return the car. Enterprise would be happy to drive me back to the station, but usually I don't want to have to haul around all my checked and carry-on baggage to the baggage check. Access to the baggage room is around the side of the station, off Dorchester St., between the station and the post office building. You have to drive through a gate, which they let you through if you say you're going to the Amtrak baggage room. Parking is a little flaky, but you're only there for a couple of minutes dropping off your bags, and I've never had a problem. One thing to keep in mind is that this office usually closes at 6 (maybe earlier on Sundays). They'll let you leave the car in the lot and throw the keys through a slot if the place is closed, but you are responsible for damage if anything happens to the car between the time you drop it off and the time they check it out when the place opens.\n\nNext stop -- BWI\n\nThe rental car office for BWI Airport is located fairly close to the train station. Unfortunately, there's no direct shuttle from the train station to the rental car office. You have to ride the bus to the airport terminal, and then get the rental car shuttle. Otherwise, this is pretty much the standard large airport rental car center with desks for all the major rental agencies. I once rented a car here for a business road trip; my wife drove me down and picked me up, but then I decided to use the Enterprise office in my neighborhood.\n\nNext stop - Washington Union Station\n\nThey have rental car desks at Washington, but when I used it, they just directed me upstairs into the parking garage that's over the tracks, where the real rental offices are. My final judgement was \"never again,\" but that was mostly because renting at the station means you have to drive through downtown Washington's most congested traffic before you're on your way. It might be better to go to the airport and get a car, but maybe that depends on where you're going.\n\nNext stop -- Savannah, Georgia\n\nYou have to rent your car at the Savannah Airport. This is a $30 taxi ride from the train station. I used Hertz at first, who had a deal where, upon return, you could park your car at the train station, call Hertz to say you were doing that, and leave your keys with the Amtrak agent at the station. Naturally, my employer then decided that we couldn't use Hertz, we had to use various cheap, no-name car rental companies to save maybe $30. So I used the no-name company, which was also at the airport, and I put my extra $30 taxi fare on my expense account.\n\nNext Stop - Miami Florida\n\nIf they ever figured out how to finish the Miami International station to fit the Amtrak trains, this would be a breeze, as the rental car office is right over the station. If your train is running on time, you can get off in Hollywood and take a Tri-Rail commuter train into Miami International, or do what we did and take a taxi from the Miami station for about $25. Returning your car is a little tricky, because the Meteor leaves fairly early in the morning. Thus you either need to get up very early to return your rental car and then get a taxi to the station, or you have to return your car the night before, and find a motel to spend the night. We checked into the motel first and found they had a shuttle from the airport. Then we returned the car. Then we had to ride the people mover to the actual airport terminal. Then we had to wander around until we found the arrivals area, and we called the motel and said we were ready for the shuttle. Then we waited for over 30 minutes breathing diesel fumes before the shuttle finally showed up. We made one big mistake in that we didn't eat dinner before returning the rental car. The area around the Miami Airport is definitely pedestrian hostile. We were able to walk across a parking lot and wiggle through a fence to get to the hotel next door that had a decent restaurant. The next morning, another hotel patron snagged the taxi we called before we could, so we had to wait a bit longer than we planned, but we did get to the station in time to check a bag, and, anyway, the Miami station is no great place for waiting around.\n\nNext Stop - Chicago\n\nChicago -- They used to have rental desks at Union Station before they demolished the garage. Hopefully whatever is going to replace the garage will have a garage in it so the rental desks and cars can return. However, the rental desks closed early on Saturday and only one was open on Sunday. One time, the Capitol Limited I was riding was over 4 hours late and arrived after the rental desk closed. (This was a Saturday.) Fortunately, there were a lot of other Hertz offices sprinkled around downtown Chicago within walking distance of Union Station. However, there was snow on the ground, so it was a bit of a drag hauling my luggage about. I was able to return the car to the Union Station garage on my way out, though. Another problem with Chicago is if you're heading north and west out of town, the traffic on the Kenney and Eisenhower Expressways is usually horrible, even on weekends. The last trip where I rented a car at Union station, I kicked myself for not just riding out the Blue Line and renting at O'Hare, the traffic was so bad.\n\nSanta Fe - When I did this, I was taking an \"open jaws\" trip that involved a one-way rental from Santa Fe to Denver. Unfortunately, Hertz wouldn't let me do a one-way rental from their in-town locations in either city, so I had to rent from and return to the airports. We rode into Lamy on the Chief on a Sunday morning and got the Thruway van into Santa Fe. For the fare paid, the van would take you to anywhere inside the Santa Fe city limits. You guessed it, the airport is outside the city limits. This was an extra $10 charge. I don't remember now whether it was for the whole van or each of us had to pay an extra $10. Well, it was still probably cheaper than riding to our hotel and taking a taxi out to the airport to get our car. When we got to the airport, the terminal building was locked up tight. I guess there were no flights out on Sunday. There was a note tacked on the door informing us that anyone needing to deal with Hertz should go to Signature Flight Support (the fixed base operator.) That we did, and our car keys and car were waiting.\n\nDenver - Because I picked up the car in Santa Fe and was returning it in Denver, I had to use the office at Denver International Airport. This was another Sunday morning drop-off. I decided to unload my bags at Union Station before I relinquished the car, so I drove to the station and found absolutely no parking. But, being it was Sunday and nobody was around, I just parked in front of the station. I didn't actually see any \"no parking\" signs, but I figured if I was wrong and got a ticket, I'd just suck it up and pay for it. As it turns out, I had no problem, but I wish Union Station has better car access. I took my bags in, checked the bulky stuff through to Baltimore and day-checked my carry-ons.\n\nI returned to my car and drove out to Denver International Airport. It was so far from town, I thought we were about to enter Kansas! But I finally got to the rental car operation and returned my car. Then I had to take a shuttle to the terminal, which was a long way from the rental car offices. When I took that trip, the A-line hadn't opened, although it was almost finished, so I had to take an express bus to Union Station. These ran every half hour for a fare of $11 at the time. Of course, I got to the platform just in time to see the tail end of the bus zooming off, so I had to wait around for 30 minutes for the next one. It was a perfectly fine ride in a highway coach to the underground bus bays at Union station. I spent the rest of the day hanging around downtown Denver. Had lunch at the Wynkoop Brewing company, and relaxed in the lobby of the Crawford Hotel, which is the fanciest train station waiting room I've ever seen. The eastbound Zephyr was more or less on time, and I was on my way.\n\nFor those not requiring a one-way rental, there is an Avis Agency and a SIXT agency within walking distance of Union Station, and an Enterprise at 22nd and Broadway (they'll pick you up and drop you off.)\n\nHavre, Montana -- There's only one rental agency in Havere. It used to be affiliated with Budget, but now it's independent. It's part of Tilleman Motor Co.., the local GM dealer, where they sell Chevrolets, Buicks, Cadillacs, and GMC trucks all at one dealership. I called them for a pickup when I was on the Empire Builder and close enough to Havre to get a cell signal, but they told me to call again when I got into the station, as I guess they didn't want their drivers hanging around waiting for the train. That I did when the train came in, and my ride soon came. He took me out to the GM dealer where I got my SUV (hey, this was Montana in the winter), and I was off on my merry way. I got into Great Falls, where I was spending the night just as it was getting dark.\n\nOn the way back, I also spent the night in Great Falls, and drove back to Havre to drop my car. Well, it was a Sunday Morning -- I think this is getting to be a constant refrain for me, and it might be a good idea to avoid returning rental cars on Sundays -- I got to Tilleman Motors and the place was closed up tight. There was a phone number on the door, and a lady answered it. I think maybe I was interrupting her Sanday dinner or something, but she was pleasant and just told me to park the car at the train station and lock the keys inside. This I did and caught my Empire Builder back to Chicago with no problem. However, a couple of days after I got home, they called and said that when they picked up the car, the window was cracked, and that was going to cost me $300. The window certainly wasn't cracked when I parked the car, but I suspect that there might have been thermal stresses on the glass from wildly fluctuating temperatures, which seemed to be common out there. I didn't bother my insurance company with the relatively small claim, but I did get reimbursement of the deductible through my platinum card, which had that benefit. In any event, a good reason to plan your trip so that you can check in your rental car with a person who will record it as being returned undamaged."
