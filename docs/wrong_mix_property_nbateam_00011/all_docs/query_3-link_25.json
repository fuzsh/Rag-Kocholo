Gbadegesin is a Tenured Professor of Pediatrics, Division of Nephrology, Duke University, Durham, NC, and Investigator at the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute (DMPI). He is the Co-Director of the Duke CTSA KL2 program and the Program Director of the Duke Pediatric Research Scholar (DPRS) program. The overarching objective of his research program is to understand the genetic basis, the pathogenesis, and the determinants of variable therapy response in hereditary and idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. In the last ten years, Dr Gbadegesin and his collaborators have identified at least five novel genetic causes of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome/Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and other kidney diseases. More recently, using the strategy of extreme phenotyping, his group identified the first exome-wide locus for childhood onset steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). He has established a large biorepository of phenotype data and biosamples from children with nephrotic syndrome and he is currently collaborating with other Investigators around the World to determine the biologic basis for ethnic disparities in the incidence and severity of nephrotic syndrome with the ultimate goal of developing strategies for personalized treatment of nephrotic syndrome. He has presented his research at both international and national meetings and published many peer reviewed journal articles with multiple first and senior author papers related to the molecular pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome. He has published many landmark papers on genotype-phenotype correlation studies in different glomerular diseases including a paper that described the overlap between Alport syndrome and familial FSGS. Dr Gbadegesin is the Principal Investigator on multiple NIH, foundation, and industry grants. He was elected into the American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI) in 2016.\n\nProfessor of Pediatrics\n\nDivision of Pediatric Nephrology\n\nUniversity of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN)\n\nDr. Clifford Kashtan is Professor of Pediatrics (with tenure) at the University of Minnesota Medical School, and an attending Pediatric Nephrologist at the University of Minnesota Children‘s Hospital, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

He received his doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania and did his fellowship in pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Dr. Trachtman is an extremely well regarded specialist in pediatric glomerularnephritis and fluid disorders. In his own words “When I was in medical school, I looked up to pediatricians and nephrologists. I thought the work they did was unbelievable, so the choice to become a pediatric nephrologist was an easy one. Now, I treat children who have renal disease and renal failure. When I’m not seeing patients, I research pediatric glomerular diseases and the impact of environmental chemicals on children’s health. I know that treatment can have varying effects on different parts of the body, even if it alleviates or fixes a condition. When I take care of children, I think carefully about how I want to treat them. I make an effort to learn everything I can about them so I’m aware of any and all potential effects of treatment. I try to listen to my patients’ stories about why they have come to see me, rather than relying only on diagnostic tests. While available treatments can be lifesaving, they are not perfect—my aim is to strike a balance, coming up with the healthiest option that is tailored to meet each patient’s needs.”"
