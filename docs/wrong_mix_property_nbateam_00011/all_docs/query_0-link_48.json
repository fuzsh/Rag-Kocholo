        "text": "Stefan Bondy: Mitchell Robinson’s sore knee is minor. He underwent MRI on Monday and it was clear, a source says. Team USA is holding him out of practice for precautionary reasons. You can see him tweak the knee at the 50-second mark of video from yesterday’s practice pic.twitter.com/WduiLJngEO\n\nStoryline: Mitchell Robinson Injury\n\nAccording to a Team USA source, Robinson suffered a knee injury and missed the first two days of practice that began with an informal workout Sunday. He returned for two days but re-injured the knee Wednesday. Robinson is expected to miss Thursday’s set of scrimmages and practice. A member of the Knicks training staff is in Vegas with Robinson. A Team USA official did not know the specifics of the knee injury. The Vegas scrimmages end Friday.\n\nStoryline: Mitchell Robinson Injury\n\nBut he’s got one idea in mind on how he’ll expand his game in 2019-20. “Next year I’m shooting 3s,” Robinson said. “I can shoot them. I shot them in high school. They ain’t that much farther. I’m going to continue to work on them.” Robinson took about 150 3-pointers as a senior at Chalmette High, his coach Butch Stockton said, and he hit them at a 38 percent rate. That has yet to translate to the NBA, though Robinson likes to conclude his pregame workouts by taking 3s and shoots them occasionally after practice.\n\nBobby Portis has no pretensions he will start this season at center over 21-year-old phenom Mitchell Robinson. Portis, the 6-foot-11 big man who signed a two-year, $31 million deal with the Knicks earlier this month, has designs on a different goal — to be the leader of what he feels will be a top-notch bench.\n\nAlso, Team USA could graduate players from its “select” team (think the USA junior varsity), where rising stars like Trae Young, De’Aaron Fox, Joe Harris, Mitchell Robinson, and Jarrett Allen reside. According to The Athletic’s Shams Charania, No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson has withdrawn from the select team. “We are blessed with a lot of talent, a lot of talent in the NBA,” Jerry Colangelo, managing director for Team USA, told The Athletic. “There is no panic. It may be more challenging, but we will be able to field a very competitive team. We’ve had players call us who want to be on our list.”\n\nStoryline: World Cup\n\nTim Bontemps: Knicks center Mitchell Robinson has been invited to join the Select Team at USA Basketball training camp, league sources tell ESPN. Robinson impressed after being a second round pick last season, averaging 7.3 points, 6.4 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game."
