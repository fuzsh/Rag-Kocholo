        "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs have many famous fans who are involved in many forms of entertainment.\n\nEach has a story about how they found their fandom, but few have a better tale to tell than NBA champion Rasheed Wallace, who recently sat down with Ed Easton Jr. to talk about his venture into podcasting and his status as a Chiefs superfan.\n\nSpeaking about his new career as a content creator, Wallace made it clear that he was getting used to being back in the spotlight:\n\n“The podcast is different from regular broadcasting, or normal sitting-behind-the-desk medium because then you can’t say what you want to say, because you’re on public TV, and all that you got to have good etiquette,” Wallace explained. “But with the podcast, it’s easy because you can say what you want; I’m saying you can cuss and do everything you can. You can really be you. That’s one thing I like about it, and that was an easy transition for me because most of my fans know sometimes, I got a little potty mouth, but that’s definitely part of it.”\n\nWallace initially expressed no interest in doing a podcast until he received encouragement from former Portland Trail Blazers teammate Bonzi Wells.\n\n“My guy Bonzi Wells got me started in the podcast stuff,” Wallace said. “He was one year do it for years before him, and I finally did a show some years back called ‘Let’s Get Technical.’ He kept telling me, ‘Man, we need a podcast.’ He was saying this around the same time when Matt (Barnes) and Stephen (Jackson) started ‘All the Smoke,’ and he was saying this, then I was like, ‘Man, I’m not trying to do that.’ “\n\nOn The Sheed & Tyler Show, an Underdog Fantasy production, Rasheed Wallace, Bonzi Wells, and TylerIAm offer their unfiltered takes on the NBA and various sports, both past and present.\n\n“So, finally, I broke down and started it. Then after Bonzi got hired, as him and I got hired into the collegiate world as coaches, you know that pretty much threw a wrench into that,” said Wallace. “However, we still kept our relationship with one of the head guys over there at Underdog Fantasy, and then once he moved over there, he’s like, ‘Hey, look, you guys need to come on over and have a show.’ So that’s how Tyler and I got started.”\n\nFor years, the four-time NBA All-Star didn’t have a favorite NFL team but always followed one player. The legendary quarterback who famously joined Kansas City in the early 1990s turned Wallace into a lifetime fan.\n\nSaid Wallace:\n\n“I became a Chiefs fan in 1992, and the reason being, I was a Montana fan; Joe Montana got traded from the Niners. I wasn’t a Niners fan — an individual of football. I didn’t have a team at the time, and then when he got traded, nobody I knew was a Chiefs fan. And so I was like, ‘Oh, man, that’s perfect; we were still in the gutter.’ We weren’t winning. I said, ‘OK, that’s just my team.’ I stuck with them through all the days. That’s the whole Trent Green, then the Alex Smith (eras). I have been there since ’92 for my guys, and now that we are finally winning, it feels stupendous.”"
