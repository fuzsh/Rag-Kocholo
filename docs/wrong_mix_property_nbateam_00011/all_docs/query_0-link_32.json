        "text": "Knicks center Tyson Chandler called ESPN analyst Jay Williams’ assertion that members of the 2002-03 Chicago Bulls smoked marijuana prior to games “ridiculous” on Monday evening. Chandler and Williams played together on the 2002-03 Bulls. “I don’t know why he would say something like that. I think that’s ridiculous that he would come out and say something. I don’t remember that to be honest with you. And it’s unfortunate that he would make that kind of statement about our game,” Chandler said at the team’s charity bowling event to support Madison Square Garden’s Garden of Dreams Foundation.\n\nAs New York Knicks coach, D’Antoni issued a clear stance in organizational discussions on a possible pursuit of Howard: He wasn’t a fan. He told Knicks front-office staff stories about how the elders of USA Basketball preferred Tyson Chandler to Howard, and that the Knicks would be wise to adopt that thinking, a source with knowledge of the conversations told Yahoo! Sports."
