        "text": "Rasheed Wallace celebrated his 40th birthday in September with the help of four elaborate cakes, two of them shaped like 'Sheed's Nike sneakers.\n\nInstagram photos of the cakes, taken by Wallace's former teammate Rip Hamilton, popped up on the Internet and found their way onto sneaker blogs.\n\nOver the weekend, Pink Cake Box, the Denville, N.J., bakery responsible for the baked creations, sent studio photos of the cakes to The Oregonian and answered some questions.\n\nWhoever selected Pink Cake Box to create Wallace's cakes – the bakery won't say, citing client confidentiality – chose one with a national reputation.\n\nAnne Heap, who started Pink Cake Box in 2005, has made cakes for Rachel Ray, Betty White and Maria Sharipova. Dessert Professional named Heap one of the top 10 cake artists in North America in 2013. Pink Cake Box's cakes have been featured in Modern Bride, Brides NJ, NJ Bride, InStyle Weddings, Bride & Bloom Magazine, Brides Magazine, People Magazine, Elegant Bride, The Knot Magazine and other magazines and newspapers.\n\nNicole Cataldo, general manager for Pink Cake Box, located about 20 miles northwest of Newark, answered questions by email about Wallace's 40th birthday cakes.\n\nWhat kind of directions did the bakery have when creating these cakes?\n\nWe were asked to design the two sneaker cakes, based off of his sneakers/logos, with the 3rd cake centered in between. The fourth birthday cake was to reflect his outstanding career in the NBA.\n\nDid the bakery have samples of the shoes and the shoe boxes when the cake was created?\n\nNo, the shoes were not sent, we were given photos and did some of our own research.\n\nAny particular challenges to creating the cakes?\n\nWe wanted to replicate the 'cake' shoe, as closely as possible, to the real shoe -- which is difficult when you do not have it on hand.\n\nWhat kind of cakes (cake and icing) are these?\n\nAll 4 of the cakes were lemon cake with lemon zest butter cream.\n\nWho ordered the cakes?\n\nWe typically maintain a level of client confidentiality- it was a friend of the family.\n\nHow many people would these cakes serve?\n\nIn total, they would feed approx. 250-300 people\n\nHow much did the cakes cost?\n\nWe typically maintain a level of client confidentiality, these cakes would range from $15-$25 per slice.\n\n-- Allan Brettman"
