        "text": "The Lakers have a full 15-man roster at the moment and would need to release a player to add one of the veteran free agents on the market. Accomplished NBA contributors Gilbert Arenas and Joel Przybilla are still without a team and Yahoo! Sports reported Rasheed Wallace is considering coming out of retirement to sign somewhere. “We don’t expect to sign anybody any time soon,” Kupchak said.\n\nCeltics coach Doc Rivers didn’t exactly express interest in bringing Wallace back to Boston Friday, but he did say that Wallace could return successfully if that was his intention. “He can play,” said Rivers. “With everyone, it’s conditioning. If he’s in great condition, then I’m sure he can play. If he’s not then I’m sure it’s going to be tough for him to play.” Rivers said he was not surprised that Wallace would be contemplating a comeback. “I was surprised that he retired, honestly,” said Rivers. “Things didn’t end great, but he did play well in the first half of that Game 7, and then the cramps and all that stuff took its toll on him. But I think he still had basketball left in his body … I think sometimes you talk yourself into it, and then when you get home you think, ‘What have I done?’, and I think that’s what he’s going through. I think he thinks he left a year or two out there.”\n\nIf the C’s were to bring Wallace back and decided to keep Stiemsma, they would then most likely release Sasha Pavlovic. An Eastern Conference executive told CSNNE.com that the biggest concern with Wallace now is no different than it was when he played — conditioning. “Guys like Rasheed, with his skills, his game won’t totally fall apart just like that,” the executive said. “But you have to wonder, how much can he give you right away? And how long will it take him to get not just in shape, but basketball shape? I suspect whatever team he goes to, if he does come back, will be a team that won’t need him to come in and make an impact right away.”\n\nAt 6-foot-11, Wallace, 37, had been one of the most versatile and talented power forwards of his era. One league source who has talked with Wallace recently describes him as “serious” about a return to the NBA this season. Nevertheless, no teams contacted by Yahoo! Sports reported that they had any contact with Wallace, or his representative. When reached on Friday, Wallace’s agent, Bill Strickland, would only tell Yahoo! Sports’ Marc Spears: “As a veteran player, [Wallace] knows what it takes to be reinstated.”\n\nA league source told CSNNE.com Thursday night that Wallace will give the Celtics some consideration, but “he’s going to look at all his options” before making any decision. From the C’s standpoint, adding Wallace would involve releasing a player with the Celtics roster now at 15 players with the recent addition of Mickael Pietrus. Rookie center Greg Stiemsma might wind up being the odd man out if Wallace returns. The only player kept around from the group of training camp invitees, Stiemsma’s contract won’t become fully guaranteed until next month.\n\nIn a limited role, several GMs told Yahoo! they still believe his scoring and defending ability would probably be better than anyone else available to them. One NBA GM with potential interest in signing Wallace said, “I’d be worried about his conditioning in a condensed season.” In his 15 seasons with Washington, Portland, Atlanta, Detroit and Boston, Wallace averaged 14.6 points and 6.7 rebounds."
