A lot of questions were answered, a lot of connections were made and there's more to come. Our first Community Conversations to discuss solutions for gun violence in the city of Philadelphia was held this past Friday. Thank you @iam_sheeeeeed for providing us with your vision. I would like to thank my partners @the_coachali @kfc6323 @twallace45 @g2msports @moodynwatsonllc #melissa. Thank you @hartoflifefoundation @got_95hart @lynardstewart for keeping my Aunt Jackie's vision going with the Basketball Clinic üëèüèøü´°üíØ. Thank you to our Town Hall Sponsor @cindybassphilly @darrylshuler215. Thank you @sustudiosofficial for the Town Hall flyer! Thank you to our wonderful panelist @a.cartersteward @ankamahjr @chefwiz144 @iam_coachroc #KionaBuford #DionJones #DeAngeloHarris #CaptainJosephBusa of the 39th District and our wonderful moderator @eddieshouse215. Thank you to Philly District Attorney @larrykrasner for attending and salute ü´° to my brother from another mother Philly Deputy Police Commissioner Joel Dales. We are not done. We are looking to have more events, implement solutions and programs, and change more lives. I will leave you all with this if you have gotten this far down in the post, it's time to repent for all the wrong we have done because the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. ‚úåüèæ #rasheedwallace #simongratz #communityconservation #jackiewallacefoundation #philly #peaceinthestreets"
