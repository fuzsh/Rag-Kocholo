        "text": "The last piece I wrote began the selection of an all-time Pistons team. The consistent thing to do this season is to rank on this year’s team, and rightfully so. Let’s not forget that the Pistons have had some legends in red, white, and blue. So, in the last editorial, I picked Isiah Thomas as my starting point guard. Unfortunately, Dave Bing was coming off the bench for my all-time Pistons team, and Chauncey Billups was going to be cut.\n\nThis week, I will select the starting shooting guard for my all-time Pistons team. Will it be the 2-way finals MVP in Joe Dumars, the masked mid-range assassin in Richard Hamilton, or the dynamic offensive powerhouse Jerry Stackhouse? Three all-time Pistons greats with legitimate arguments. Let’s pick and lay out the ideas for each player.\n\nHonorable Mentions: John Long.\n\nBefore the oldtimers get on here bashing me, Let me say this. I don’t overlook John Long and Vinnie Johnson’s impact on this Pistons team during their tenure. Let’s talk about John Long briefly. Born in Romulus, Michigan, on August 28, 1956, Being drafted by his hometown team in the 2nd round of the 1978 NBA draft had to be a dream of a lifetime. The move was seen to be influenced mainly by Dick Vitale, who coached Long at the University of Detroit with future NBA players Terry Duerod, Terry Tyler, and Dennis Boyd. Long put up some solid numbers in the ten seasons Long played for the Pistons.\n\n14.8 PTS\n\n3.1 REB\n\n1.9 AST\n\n1.1 STLS\n\n47% FG\n\n85% FT\n\nPlaying Alongside Zeke.\n\nLong was the first backcourt mate to Isiah Thomas before the Pistons drafted Joe Dumars in 1986. Long averaged a career-high 21.9 PPG in 81-82, cementing himself as part of the 3-headed monster with himself, Kelly Tripucka, and Thomas. With Dumars now in the fold, John Long became expendable and played for the Indiana Pacers for two seasons before being traded back to the Pistons. In his second stint with the Pistons, Long saw his role greatly diminished as he averaged just 2.0 PTS in the 24 games he played. The minutes he played nor the points he scored didn’t matter to Long as he was a part of the 88-89 NBA championship the Pistons won.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Vinnie Johnson.\n\nAnother player integral to the Pistons’ ups & downs during the 80’s was the Microwave Vinnie Johnson. Drafted with the 7th overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft by the Seattle Supersonics, Johnson had a hard time getting on the court two of the three years in Seattle. In his rookie year, Johnson played 38 games and only averaged 3.2 PTS. His second year saw his numbers shoot up. Johnson couldn’t see if the numbers could translate as he was dealt to the Pistons after just seven games in the 81-82 season.\n\nA Staple In Detroit.\n\nVinnie’s first season in Detroit saw him play 67 games while starting in 15 of them. In the 18 minutes he played, Johnson averaged 7.7 PTS. Johnson was not only a microwave with his ability to come off the bench and instantly score points (12.7 PPG average), but He was also one of the most durable players on the team. In the ten years Johnson played for the Pistons, He played in 82 games, seven of those ten years. What amazed me about Vinnie is despite being a guy who relished coming off the bench and making an impact, He never won 6th Man of the Year. Sixth man or not, Vinnie was never a “me” guy and had two NBA championships to show for his selflessness.\n\nOutside Of Basketball.\n\nLike Dave Bing, Vinnie Johnson decided to go into business after retiring. His first venture was a construction company that failed. That failure didn’t stop him from investing his money into something that would stick. In 1995, Johnson started Piston Automotive, which supplies parts to Ford & General Motors. With his guidance and determination, Piston Automotive is worth over 3 billion dollars and employs over 11,000 people nationwide. Johnson was able to flip his career 6 million dollars into a net worth of 420 million dollars. He joins LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Junior Bridgeman as the wealthiest players in the history of the NBA.\n\nThose two players will live in Pistons history for their contributions on and off the court. Unfortunately, their basketball impact wasn’t that good to put them on the list of three. Let’s make the case for the three who made my list.\n\nMaking A Case For Joe Dumars\n\nIf you were to ask me who my favorite players were when I started getting into the game of basketball, I would tell you these guys.\n\nKendall Gill\n\nGheorghe Mureșan\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJoe Dumars\n\nI liked Joe D so much when I played video games; when I created myself on the game, I would always be the number 4. I don’t know what it was, but watching him in his later years of basketball was a joy. One thing about basketball, especially when you see certain players who’re not as good, is they may have been nice years ago! This was the story of Joe Dumars. I always remember him being solid, but there was a time during the mid 80’s to early 90’s when he was that guy!\n\nThe Early Years\n\nIsiah Thomas was drafted as the savior of the Pistons, and saving is precisely what he did. He needed someone to match his intensity on both ends of the floor. That’s precisely what they got when they drafted Joe Dumars with the 16th pick in the 1985 NBA draft. He played all four years at McNeese State and averaged 22.5 PTS, 4.2 REB, 2.8 AST, and 1.6 STLS. His rookie showcased his potential as a 2-way player and averaged 9.4 PTS and 4.8 AST in 82 games.\n\nThirteen Years Of Run\n\nJoe D would come into the 86-87 season as the starting shooting guard alongside Isiah Thomas. While Thomas got all of the recognition for his play and the highlights, Dumars was taking on the best offensive player of the other team while also contributing to the offensive end. Dumars was seen as the most levelheaded of all the players on that “Bad Boys” squad. He would take that “level head” into a career that penciled him in as the starting shooting guard for the Pistons. Joe Dumars started every season at the shooting guard position until the 95-96 season when he became the point guard of the Pistons. That was also the year Dumars came off the bench more than he did his rookie season. Dumars played in 67 games, starting in 40 of them.\n\nAccolades As A Hooper And Executive.\n\nOf the shooting guards mentioned in this article, Joe Dumars has way more achievements than the other two.\n\n6x All-Star\n\n2x NBA Champion\n\nFinals MVP (88-89)\n\n3x All-NBA\n\n5x All-Defense\n\nJ. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award (1994)\n\nNBA Sportsmanship Award (1995)\n\nNBA All-Rookie (1986)\n\nNBA Hall Of Fame\n\nIf you thought his basketball career was impressive, His career as President Of Basketball Operations for the Pistons was just as good.\n\nTrading Grant Hill for Ben Wallace and Chucky Atkins\n\nTrading Jerry Stackhouse for Richard Hamilton\n\nSigning Chauncey Billups\n\nDrafting Tayshaun Prince\n\nTrading for Rasheed Wallace\n\nHiring Rick Carlisle as Head coach\n\nHiring Larry Brown as Head coach\n\nHiring Flip Saunders as Head coach\n\nThere were some blunders as well…\n\nSigning Ben Gordon & Josh Smith\n\nSigning Charlie Villanueva\n\nHiring Michael Curry as Head coach\n\nTrading Chauncey Billups for Allen Iverson\n\nDrafting Darko Millicic over Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nBut overall, During his 14 years as President, Dumars guided the organization to a 595–536 (.527) regular-season record, 73 playoff wins, six Eastern Conference Finals appearances (2003–08), six Central Division titles, two Eastern Conference Championships (2004 and 2005) and the 2004 NBA championship.\n\nAs mentioned in this piece, Joe Dumars was instrumental in bringing Richard Hamilton to Detroit. RIP would be one of the most influential players to play for the Pistons. Let’s make the case for him being the starting shooting guard for this all-time Pistons team.\n\nMaking A case for Richard Hamilton.\n\nLike Joe Dumars, Richard Hamilton affected the way I played. Seeing him run off of screen after screen was something remarkable. Another thing that was remarkable about RIP was his effectiveness from the mid-range. It was a shot that always looked like it was going in. From the mask to the free-throw ritual he had, RIP was something a guy hoopers wanted to emulate.\n\nChampionship Mentality.\n\nWhen you play for the University Of Connecticut, You are expected to do great things during your tenure there. That’s precisely what RIP did during his time with the Huskies.\n\n2X Big East Player Of The Year\n\n2x First Team All-Big East\n\nFirst Team All-American (1999)\n\nSecond Team All-American (1998)\n\nNCAA Champion (1999)\n\nNCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player (1999)\n\nHamilton left the University averaging 19.8 PTS, 4.5 REB, and 2.6 AST. He would then be selected with the 7th overall pick in the 1999 draft by the Washinton Wizards. Imagine going from playing at one of the best schools in the nation to playing with one of the greatest players of all time! That’s the experience RIP was getting ready to face.\n\nPlaying with Mike.\n\nMichael Jordan decided to come from the press box back onto the hardwood. It was a move that we all look back on now and question if it was done in good faith to the other players on that Wizards team. No matter what you thought of the move, Jordan was coming back to play basketball and put Washington back on the map. With Michael back in the fold, RIP returned to his natural shooting guard position. Hamilton and Jordan were limited to 60 games due to injuries, but the duo helped improve the team’s final record to 37–45, effectively an 18-game improvement over the previous season.\n\nHamilton averaged 20 points a game for the season while finishing second in the league in free throw percentage, shooting 89 percent from the free throw line. You thought if both these guys could stay healthy, then Washington could be a formidable force in the Eastern Conference. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case, as RIP was traded to Detroit the following season for Jerry Stackhouse and an assortment of other players.\n\nNot A Popular Trade in Detroit… At First.\n\nThe Stackhouse deal was a deal that people questioned when it happened. No matter what you may have felt about Stack and his game, he brought the pistons back to respectability. You understood the move, though. Washington was looking to bring all of the veteran talent they could bring in around Jordan, while the Pistons were looking for a guy that could fit “team ball.” With RIP in the fold and the signing of Chauncey Billups in free agency, The Pistons have solidified that backcourt. And if history were to repeat itself, A good backcourt would equal great success for the Pistons.\n\nThe Face Mask!\n\nRIP brought a different energy to the Pistons. Running off screens, the mid-range game, attacking the paint despite his frail build; watching him play with Chauncey was fun. In his first season with the Pistons, Hamilton led the team in scoring, averaging 19.7 PPG while helping the Pistons overcome a 3-1 deficit to the Orlando Magic to get out of the first round. The Pistons would get to the conference finals before being swept by the New Jersey Nets.\n\nThrough the early part of the 2003-2004 season, RIP broke his nose twice (Once in 2002.) Hamilton was advised to wear a facemask to protect the nose. As stated earlier, that facemask became a staple in his career and Detroit Culture. What made the mask cool, though, was the Pistons winning. The Pistons finally won their championship once they acquired Rasheed Wallace during the trade deadline. Six Eastern Conference Finals appearances (2003–08), six Central Division titles, two Eastern Conference Championships (2004 and 2005), and the 2004 NBA championship. That’s RIPS legacy.\n\nAccolades.\n\nHamilton isn’t up there regarding his achievements, but there are still achievements to discuss.\n\nNBA Champion (2004)\n\n3x All-Star\n\n#32 Retired by the Pistons\n\nCareer Pistons Statistics\n\n18.4 PPG\n\n3.4 REB\n\n3.8 AST\n\n.9 STLS\n\n45% FG\n\n31% 3PT\n\n86$ FT\n\nYou’ll look at the numbers and ask why. Don’t look at the numbers with RIP. Look at the impact he had on and off the court in Detroit. RIP was intensely felt by many, and those numbers helped Detroit become one of the best teams during the early to mid-2000s.\n\nSome people still feel a way about the trade. If you were one of the people that felt the transaction was wrong, I couldn’t blame you. Jerry Stackhouse was a scoring machine during his time in Detroit. And no matter what you think, Stack changed the feeling in Detroit.\n\nMaking A Case For Stackhouse.\n\nLike RIP, Stackhouse went to a perennial college powerhouse. At the University of North Carolina, Stackhouse would go on to play with future NBA players Rasheed Wallace, Jeff McInnis, and Shammond Williams. In his sophomore season at UNC, Stackhouse scored 19.2 points per game and averaged 8.2 rebounds per contest. He led UNC to a Final Four appearance, was named the National Player of the Year by Sports Illustrated, and earned first-team All-America and All-ACC honors. He would forgo his Junior season and declared for the 1995 NBA draft, where the Sixers selected him with the 3rd pick.\n\nPlaying With The Answer.\n\nIn Stackhouse’s rookie year, He led the team in scoring,’ averaging 19.2 PTS. He would make the NBA All-Rookie team after the 1996 season. The Sixers won the 1st overall selection for the famed 1996 NBA draft. They took that pick and selected Allen Iverson. Iverson, like Stackhouse, was a ball-dominant guard. Despite playing the same brand of basketball, the two combined averaged 44.2 points on the floor together.\n\nThe Sixers needed to decide and decided that Iverson was the better long-term solution. Stackhouse was traded to Detroit along with Eric Montross for Theo Ratliff and Aaron Mckie. After the trade and the lockout year, Stackhouse was coming off the bench, where he was effective, averaging 15 points during that span. After the retirement of Joe Dumars, Stackhouse became the 2nd scoring option behind Grant Hill.\n\nWhat Could Have Been.\n\nThe potential was there. Grant Hill and Jerry Stackhouse could be the next best 1-2 punch. You have to give the Pistons coaching staff for allowing Joe D to start and walk away on his terms. The 99-2000 season saw both Stack and Hill average over 20 points during the season. The team finished with a 42-40 record and couldn’t overcome the Miami Heat after Grant Hill re-injured the ankle he hurt in April.\n\nGrant Hill was traded after the season, and Stackhouse became the primary scoring option. During the 2000-01 season, Stackhouse led the league in scoring, averaging 29.8 PTS. That scoring output was enough for Stackhouse to be selected for the 2001 NBA All-Star game. One of Stackhouse’s highlights during that season was the franchise record 57 points he put up against the Chicago Bulls. With a solid core now in place, Joe Dumars was ready to turn the corner.\n\nStackhouse Built The Winning Foundation.\n\nThe Pistons wouldn’t get to where they were if it wasn’t for the work Stack put in. Think about it: The Pistons didn’t put a legitimate team around him once Grant Hill was traded, and despite that, The team was still competitive. Once you realized you have an offensive juggernaut with a defensive ace in Ben Wallace, The direction of how that team was built changed.\n\nSigning Jon Barry\n\nTrading for Corliss Williamson\n\nTrading for Clifford Robinson\n\nThese were some of the moves I felt were made to help Stackhouse lead this team to another level. They couldn’t advance past the 2nd round with Stackhouse as the guy, but if it wasn’t for him, I don’t think the Pistons would be the Pistons they were during their reign of dominance.\n\nAccolades\n\nStackhouse didn’t have the accolades of Joe or RIP, but he was still a 2x all-star in Detroit. During his five seasons in Detroit, Stackhouse put up some numbers that rival any Pistons-scoring all-timer.\n\n22.1 PPG\n\n3.7 REB\n\n4.4 AST\n\n1.1 STLS\n\n40% FG\n\n30% 3PT\n\n82% FT\n\nThe Final Verdict.\n\nI love the Stackhouse game and RIPs, but if I’m building an all-time team, I go with Joe Dumars, and it’s not even close. Dumar’s career pistons numbers may not be up to par with the other two, but his accolades are more than everyone on this list combined. And who would I be to break up a dynamic backcourt that got the franchise back-to-back championships?\n\nWho’s coming off the bench? History would say, Richard Hamilton, right? He was the starting shooting guard on the 2004 NBA championship team. Remember who I cut from my point guard list in the first piece? If I had to choose between Dave Bing or Chauncey, I’d go Bing 10/10 times. I like RIP, but Stackhouse was a different type of hooper when he was given the keys to the car. So, with that said, Stack is coming off the bench, and RIP is, unfortunately, going to be cut.\n\nStart: Joe Dumars\n\nBench: Jerry Stackhouse\n\nCut: Richard Hamilton\n\nOn second thought…\n\nIs this about individual success or team success? Both players had team success, but RIP had a championship, while Stack couldn’t get out of the 2nd round. I am going to change my mind here."
