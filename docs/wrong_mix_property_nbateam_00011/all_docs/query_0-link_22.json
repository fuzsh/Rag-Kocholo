        "text": "American former basketball player (born 1974)\n\nMarcus Dion Camby (born March 22, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player who played 17 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was named Defensive Player of the Year during the 2006–07 NBA season, leading the league in blocked shots per game.[1] Camby is also a four-time member of the NBA All-Defensive Team and is 12th on the NBA's all-time career blocks list.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcus Dion Camby was born on March 22, 1974, in Hartford, Connecticut. Camby began his high school career at Conard High School in West Hartford, Connecticut. He transferred to Hartford Public High School.[2] In his senior season, Camby averaged 27 points, 11 rebounds, 8 blocks and 8 assists, en route to a 27–0 record and state title. He was named Gatorade's Connecticut Player of the Year.[3][4]\n\nCollege career\n\n[edit]\n\nCamby played three seasons for the UMass Minutemen. He had an NCAA freshman record 105 total blocks during his first year at UMass, and was named the Atlantic 10's Freshman of the Year.[5] Camby was named to the A-10's First Team during his sophomore season in 1994–95, as the Minutemen reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament.[4]\n\nCamby won the John R. Wooden Award[6] and the Naismith College Player of the Year Award[7] during the 1995–96 season. He led UMass to numerous #1 rankings and the 1996 NCAA Final Four.[8] In the NCAA tournament, Camby set a tourney record of 43 total blocked shots in 11 games.[5] On April 29, 1996, Camby announced that he would forgo his senior year at UMass and enter the NBA draft.[9]\n\nIn 1997, UMass' visit to the Final Four was vacated by the NCAA because Camby had been found to have accepted $28,000 from two sports agents.[10][11] As part of the penalty, the school was forced to return their $151,617 in revenue from the 1996 NCAA Tournament.[12] Camby later reimbursed the school for the amount lost.[12] According to a 1997 Sports Illustrated article, the agents, John Lounsbury and Wesley Spears of Connecticut, had hoped that Camby would hire them to represent him when he became a professional. The article reported that Camby had also received \"jewelry, rental cars and prostitutes\" from the agents.[13]\n\nCamby was inducted into the UMass Athletic Hall of Fame on September 10, 2010.[14] Though some criticized the school for inducting a student-athlete who caused their Final Four achievement to be vacated, others saw it as a positive recognition of one of the school's best ever athletes.[15][16][17]\n\nCamby returned to school, taking online courses from UMass, and earned his degree on May 12, 2017.[18]\n\nProfessional career\n\n[edit]\n\nToronto Raptors (1996–1998)\n\n[edit]\n\nCamby was selected second overall in the first round of the 1996 NBA draft by the Toronto Raptors.[19] In his rookie season, he made the NBA All-Rookie First Team, averaging 14.8 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game.[19] On March 27, 1997, Camby had perhaps his best game as a rookie, scoring 37 points (a remarkable 47% of Toronto’s points) and grabbing 8 rebounds in a 90–79 loss against the Atlanta Hawks.[20] In the following season, Camby led the league in blocked shots with 3.7 per game.[19] However, Camby's disagreements with Butch Carter led Toronto to trade him to the Knicks.[21]\n\nNew York Knicks (1998–2002)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1998, Camby was traded to the New York Knicks in a draft-day deal for longtime Knick Charles Oakley and the draft rights of Sean Marks. Following the trade, Camby stated of Oakley: \"No one can replace Oak. He was the heart and soul and team leader. I play different positions. I bring versatility. We'll take it one day at a time and focus on winning, that's what I'm about.\"[22]\n\nFor his first two seasons in New York, Camby backed up veteran All-Star center Patrick Ewing. The Knicks struggled to establish on-court chemistry in the lockout-shorted 1998–99 season, finishing with a 27–23 record, which was just good enough to qualify for the 8th and final seed in the Eastern Conference.[23] In the playoffs, Camby and teammate (and close friend) Latrell Sprewell began to assert themselves as the Knicks shocked the top-seeded Miami Heat and swept the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds, setting up a meeting with the rival Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.[23] After Ewing went down with a season-ending Achilles injury early in the series, Camby filled the void, averaging double-doubles in the last three games of the series to lead the Knicks to a six-game upset series win over the Pacers and into the NBA Finals.[24] The Knicks became the first 8th-seeded team to make it to the NBA Finals, where they matched up with the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs defeated the Knicks in five games to win the 1999 Championship.[25][26]\n\nIn the 1999–00 season the Knicks with Ewing back at center bounced back and won 50 games thanks to the contributions of many of the veteran players, including the Sixth Man of the Year Award-type season from Camby.[27] In the playoffs, the Knicks defeated the Toronto Raptors in three games and Miami Heat in seven games in the first two rounds of the playoffs en route to making it to the Eastern Conference Finals for the second year in a row.[27] There they faced the top seed in the East, the Indiana Pacers, and were defeated by them in six games.[27]\n\nDuring a game against the San Antonio Spurs on January 15, 2001, Camby took a roundhouse swing at Spurs' forward Danny Ferry after he was hit in the eye on a box-out. The punch missed Ferry because Knicks' head coach Jeff Van Gundy stepped in at the last second, resulting in his being head-butted by Camby. Van Gundy required 15 stitches to close a gash above his left eye. Camby, who ended up with scratches on his face from both incidents, was suspended for five games and fined $25,000. Ferry was suspended for one game and fined $7,500 for the initial foul.[28] Upon returning from the suspension, Camby began to play his best ball of the season in averaging 12 points with 11 rebounds and 2 blocks a game;[29] however, it was not enough as the Knicks were defeated by the Toronto Raptors in five games in the first round of the playoffs.[30] Camby spent most of the 2001–02 season injured, and without him as an inside presence, the Knicks struggled with a 30–52 record and missed the playoffs.[31] Camby, after getting traded to Denver, accused the Knicks training staff of misdiagnosing his injury and causing him to miss more games than he should have.[32] The Nuggets however, sided with the Knicks.[32]\n\nDenver Nuggets (2002–2008)\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 2002 NBA draft, the Knicks traded Camby, Mark Jackson and Nenê to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Antonio McDyess and Frank Williams.[33]\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, along with rookie teammate Carmelo Anthony, Camby helped lead the Nuggets back to the playoffs where they were defeated by the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nCamby led the NBA in blocked shots four times - 1997-'98, '05-'06, '06-'07, and finally in '07-'08.[34] During the 2005–06 season with the Nuggets he had 12.0 rebounds per game, 9.6 defensive rebounds per game and 1.4 steals per game.[34] He also averaged 12.8 points per game and led the league in blocks per game (3.3),[34] while helping Denver earn a playoff berth by winning the Northwest Division.[35]\n\nOn December 16, 2006, Camby was involved in the Knicks–Nuggets brawl.[36] He was one of 10 players ejected from the game, but received no suspension.\n\nCamby won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award for the 2006–07 season.[37] The honor was the first of Camby's career. He received the actual award from NBA commissioner David Stern on April 28th, 2007 during a pregame ceremony at the Nuggets first home 2006–07 playoff game against the San Antonio Spurs[38] and Tim Duncan who many believed was the deserving winner.[weasel words] During the 2006–07 season, Camby averaged 3.3 blocks per game (first in the league), 11.7 rebounds per game (fifth in the league), 9.3 defensive rebounds per game (second in the league) and 1.24 steals per game (second among centers).[39][40]\n\nDuring the 2007–08 NBA season, Camby continued to make his mark as one of the best defensive players and centers in the game. He finished the season averaging 13.1 rebounds per game (second in the league), 18.1 rebounds per 48 minutes (first in the league), 10.2 defensive rebounds per game (second in the league), 14.1 defensive rebounds per 48 minutes (first in the league), 3.61 blocks per game (first in the league), 4.96 blocks per 48 minutes (first in the league), 285 total blocks (first in the league), 1.06 steals per game (third among centers) and 3.3 assists per game (second among centers).[34] On December 26, 2007, in a Nuggets' home win against the Milwaukee Bucks, Camby posted a triple-double, with 10 points (which included a three-pointer), 11 rebounds and 10 blocks. The triple-double was Camby's third of his career and the first since April 19, 1998, against the Philadelphia 76ers.[41] On January 14, 2008, in a Nuggets' road loss against the Charlotte Bobcats, Camby had a game of 20 points, 23 rebounds, 6 assists, and 6 blocks. He became only the fourth player since 1990 to have at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, 6 assists, and 6 blocks in one game.[42] On January 17, 2008, in a Nuggets' home win against the Utah Jazz, Camby became just the third player since blocked shots became an official NBA stat in 1973–74 with at least 24 rebounds and 11 blocks in a game.[43] On January 25, 2008, in a Nuggets home win against the New Jersey Nets, Camby blocked 4 shots—and in the process—recorded his 1,000th blocked shot as a member of the Nuggets.[44] On March 16, 2008, in an historic 168–116 home win in regulation over the Seattle SuperSonics (the 168 points were the most points scored in franchise history – fourth most in NBA history – for a non-overtime game), Camby recorded his second triple-double of the 2007–08 NBA season when he had 13 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists.[45] The triple-double was accomplished in an NBA record-tying 27 minutes.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers (2008–2010)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 15, 2008, Camby was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers for the option to swap second-round draft picks in the 2010 NBA draft.[46] Camby said that he was unhappy that he was traded from the Nuggets, essentially being made the scapegoat for their lack of post-season success.[47]\n\n\"I thought I had done everything possible that I could do with that team, and just tried to go about things the right way. I just thought the way they went about it was classless; they didn't let me know anything. That's a thing of the past right now, that's something I put behind me and I'm looking forward to embarking on this journey.\"\n\nIn the first part of the 2008–09 NBA season, he started at power forward, with Chris Kaman remaining as the starting center. Then, an injury that occurred to Kaman and the arrival of forward Zach Randolph brought Camby back to the starting center position. On December 17, 2008, Camby pulled down a career-high 27 rebounds in a 115–109 overtime loss against the Chicago Bulls. He also had 19 points, 2 assists, 1 steal, and 4 blocks.[48]\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (2010–2012)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn February 16, 2010, Camby was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for Steve Blake, Travis Outlaw, and 1.5 million dollars in cash.[49]\n\nCamby played in 23 games for the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2009–2010 season.[34] With injuries to fellow centers Greg Oden and Joel Przybilla, Camby helped the team secure a playoff berth as the Western Conference's sixth seed.[50] On April 12, 2010, in a game in Portland against the Oklahoma City Thunder Camby led the team in scoring with 30 points and grabbed 13 rebounds.[51] On April 20, 2010, he signed a two-year contract extension to stay with the Blazers.[52]\n\nHouston Rockets (2012)\n\n[edit]\n\nCamby was traded at the deadline on March 15, 2012, to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Jonny Flynn, Hasheem Thabeet and a second round draft pick.[53]\n\nReturn to Knicks (2012–2013)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 11, 2012, Camby was traded to the New York Knicks in a sign-and-trade deal that also involved Toney Douglas, Josh Harrellson, Jerome Jordan, and two future draft picks going to the Rockets.[54] He missed most of the 2012–13 season with a strained plantar fascia in his left foot, playing only 24 games.[34]\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Camby, Steve Novak, Quentin Richardson, a future first round draft pick, and two future second round draft picks were traded from the Knicks to the team that drafted him 2nd overall in 1996, the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Andrea Bargnani.[55] The Raptors then bought out Camby's contract.[56]\n\nOn July 29, 2013, Camby re-signed with the Houston Rockets.[57] However, he was waived by the Rockets on October 28, 2013.[58]\n\nNBA career statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high * Led the league\n\nRegular season\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1996–97 Toronto 63 38 30.1 .482 .143 .693 6.3 1.5 1.0 2.1 14.8 1997–98 Toronto 63 58 31.8 .412 .000 .611 7.4 1.8 1.1 3.7* 12.1 1998–99 New York 46 0 20.5 .521 .000 .553 5.5 .3 .6 1.6 7.2 1999–00 New York 59 11 26.2 .480 .500 .670 7.8 .8 .7 2.0 10.2 2000–01 New York 63 63 33.8 .524 .125 .667 11.5 .8 1.0 2.2 12.0 2001–02 New York 29 29 34.7 .448 .000 .626 11.1 1.1 1.2 1.7 11.1 2002–03 Denver 29 9 21.2 .410 .400 .660 7.2 1.6 .7 1.4 7.6 2003–04 Denver 72 72 30.0 .477 .000 .721 10.1 1.8 1.2 2.6 8.6 2004–05 Denver 66 66 30.5 .465 .000 .723 10.0 2.3 .9 3.0 10.3 2005–06 Denver 56 54 33.2 .465 .091 .712 11.9 2.1 1.4 3.3* 12.8 2006–07 Denver 70 70 33.8 .473 .000 .729 11.7 3.2 1.2 3.3* 11.2 2007–08 Denver 79 79 34.9 .450 .300 .708 13.1 3.3 1.1 3.6* 9.1 2008–09 L.A.
