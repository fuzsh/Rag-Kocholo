        "text": "Madison Square Garden executive chairman James Dolan said it was important for Friday night's Knicks-Heat game to be played, and added that he hoped it would be a positive diversion for people who have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy.\n\n\"It's good for New York,\" he said. \"A lot of people told me they were either coming or watching on TV. It will give people something to cheer about and take their minds off of things for a few hours.\"\n\nDolan spoke to a handful of reporters casually inside the locker room before the game and asked how they were doing after the storm. He didn't field any questions about the Knicks.\n\nMSG donates\n\nThe Madison Square Garden company will donate $500,000 to the relief effort for those affected by Sandy and will hold a telethon on MSG Network next week to help raise money.\n\nThe donation will be divided equally between The Mayor's Fund to Advance New York City and the American Red Cross, to assist in the purchase and distribution of food, water and hygiene supplies as well as the restoration efforts in the affected areas. The telethon will be held next Friday during the Knicks-Mavericks game.\n\n\"This has been a tough week for a lot of people,\" Knicks coach Mike Woodson said. \"It's a sad day in this area, New Jersey, New York area, in terms of what has happened. We got to be open-minded and try to be helpful if we can to people who are struggling to feed their families and [don't] have a roof over their head. That's tough. It's widespread. It's not just in one area. You got a lot of people who are out of homes and not able to feed their kids. I want our players to understand and appreciate. I know I do, where I am today, because it's tough out there right now.\"\n\nFor starters\n\nAs expected, Woodson started a small lineup against Miami's small lineup. Carmelo Anthony was at power forward with Raymond Felton and Jason Kidd in the backcourt, Ronnie Brewer at small forward and Tyson Chandler at center. Woodson said he will change his lineup based on matchups. He doesn't want Anthony starting against bigger power forwards.\n\nMarcus Camby was in uniform, but Woodson said because of his lack of practice time, he didn't expect to play him against the Heat. Camby, who missed more than three weeks with a strained left calf, did not see action.\n\nRasheed Wallace entered the game late in the fourth quarter after the crowd chanted \"Ra-sheed Wal-lace.'' Wallace hit a three-pointer.\n\nThe Dolan family owns\n\ncontrolling interest in the\n\nKnicks, Madison Square\n\nGarden and Cablevision."
