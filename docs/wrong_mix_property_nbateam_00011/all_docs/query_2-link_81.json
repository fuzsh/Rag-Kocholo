        "text": "According to Rasheed Wallace, the NBA won’t have to wait until the Mayan calendar’s prediction of 2012 for its apocalypse. He believes the wagering on games by convicted referee Tim Donaghy is part of a larger problem that will rock the league.\n\nDonaghy has said he knows of no other official who bet, but noted he received information from fellow refs and made his selections based on what he knew to be their tendencies.\n\n“I always said to myself and had the thing that there’s no way that the things that he did he could do them by himself,” Wallace said. “I always said that. It’s virtually impossible. The things that he’s been accused of, there’s no way, to me, in my opinion, he could have done those things by himself.”\n\nAsked if he thinks other officials were betting, Wallace said, “Possibly.”\n\n“I mean, I’m not sure if they were betting or whatever. But I know it’s going to be, to me, once all this stuff comes out, it’s going to be like – what year was that? – I want to say, was it the ’32 New York City basketball scandal?”\n\nTold it was the CCNY scandal of the ’50s that most closely matched, Wallace went on.\n\n“And when that came out, how hard it hit and how hard it hit collegiate basketball, that’s how this one is going to do,” he said. “It’s going to hit hard. I’m just glad that I’m not him or none of these execs in the league.”\n\nWallace has been watching Donaghy make the rounds to promote his book, noting the disgraced ref’s claims are what “I’ve been saying for years.”\n\nIn an ESPN interview, Donaghy said Wallace, the single-season record-holder for technical fouls, has been a target for referees.\n\n“Everybody thought I was a liar and a militant,” Wallace said before last night’s 98-89 win against the Bucks, “but now the truth is coming out.”\n\nThe question of whether Donaghy is telling the truth was a bit tricky for other Celtics when put on the record. But it is fair to say his claims of stars getting special treatment and refs keeping games close mirrors the long held beliefs of players.\n\nOff the record, one Celtic said, “None of what he’s saying surprises any of us.”\n\nEven Doc Rivers got hit with some shrapnel yesterday when Donaghy said he didn’t like the Celtics coach because he tries to influence younger refs.\n\n“My buddy,” Rivers said with all due sarcasm. “I’ve been trying to get on younger players in this league to get them to do things, as well. . . . I’m so sick of that guy right now. I love our league, I hate what’s going on, giving a guy like that credibility. I don’t buy anything he says. I really don’t. I’m so sick of him. You can print that.”\n\nAsked if the things Donaghy has said have the ring of truth to him, Rivers paused and said, “I don’t know. Honestly? I’m kind of not even paying attention to it. I’m so over him.”\n\nBut having seen Wallace get some rather quick technical fouls, the coach must have an opinion on that.\n\n“Yeah,” he said, “I’m not going to get into that. I’m going to leave all of that alone. I have to.”\n\nRay Allen didn’t let the pitch go by.\n\n“Do I believe him? He made a very strong case,” Allen said. “He made a very strong case. He went to prison. It’s hard to say whether or not he would lie and make something up of that nature.\n\n“Regardless of whether his guys want him to say what he’s going to say, I think that as a league you see certain incidents that take place and you just . . . you know, if somebody’s getting a bad whistle. . . Yeah, I think referees sometimes if a guy’s going in on somebody, if a player’s going in on a referee, the referee might not look as favorable on that player. Again, I think we’ve got to take biases out of refereeing.”\n\nNo one doubts referees are open to human nature. But when that nature is premeditated, as Donaghy claims, it allows people to doubt the legitimacy of the games.\n\n“It’s unfortunate,” Allen said. “I think as a league we need to do whatever we can to make sure there aren’t any biases, regardless of who’s on the floor.”\n\nThe league’s response has been to state quite fairly that it investigated the matter and found Donaghy to be an isolated problem. But the larger trouble for the NBA is that he’s still talking – and its players believe him."
