        "text": "With the Pistons struggling, these \"In Defense of\" posts have had a decidedly Piston theme of late. But hey, let's throw another one in the mix: Rasheed Wallace, who is perhaps the only player blamed more for the current season failures than Allen Iverson.\n\nWe know the story: you hate his technicals, you hate him shooting threes, or maybe you just don't like loud guys. But I'm going to be completely up front: I love him. A lot. You should probably know that before you continue reading this defense.\n\nClick any story about a Pistons loss. Normally, this would be the spot where I single out a commenter, posting their screen name and comment, and then calling them an idiot. But I've changed since my R.P. McMurphy-style lobotomy. No more singling out losers. Just know that they are out there en masse when it comes to the Pistons.Rasheed Wallace is not a problem for this team. In fact, Rasheed Wallace is having his best season in three years. Check the basic stats: 13.0 points (highest average since 2005), 7.6 rebounds (highest since 2004 and a full rebound over last year's average), 1.2 blocks (down slightly, but still solid), shooting 43.5 percent (highest since 2004), shooting 37.3 percent on three-pointers (highest since 1999 [!!]). He is also 17th in the league in defensive rating and 10th in the league in defensive rebounding percentage. (Check Basketball Reference for an explanation if these last two stats are unfamiliar).\n\nBut hey, you are too busy yelling at Sheed to stop taking threes to be bothered with statistics, especially new-fangled ones like \"defensive rebounding rate,\" right? Should he really be passing up open threes, though, when he is statistically the best three-point shooter on the team?\n\nMy biggest Rasheed-centered issue is that fans arguing for his departure seem to throw out all reason in the arguments.\n\nWould it be nice if he would sit on the block and use his unbelievably good mid-range jumper and post moves to be Tim Duncan? Would it be nice if he could keep his emotions in check and not pick up silly technical fouls? Yes on both counts. But the guy is 34-years-old. It is not happening, yet every year since he has been in Detroit, the clamoring for him to do these things has become more pointed.\n\nAnd in reality, these are two relatively minor things. It is a given that Rasheed Wallace will be in the top four in the league in technical fouls every year. You know who else is? Kobe Bryant, Amare Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony. Over the course of a season, the league leaders in the category cause maybe 20 points to be scored by opponents on technical free throws. That's not a lot.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing of the potential motivational role a tech can have. Why do coaches sometimes intentionally get them if they are so horrible? For every meltdown like the one against Cleveland in the playoffs, there is evidence that techs can get teams or players fired up. And for Rasheed, there are specific statistics showing that his production after getting a technical increases.\n\nAnd the three-pointers? Blame Portland. In 2001, Portland drafted Zach Randolph and had Arvydas Sabonis at center, so they asked Rasheed Wallace to play some small forward. The result? Pre-2001, Rasheed only attempted more than 1.0 three-pointers a game in a season once in five years. After 2001, he averaged more than 3.0 attempts per game. So he was asked to play out of position and probably found that the perimeter is a nice place compared to smashing into Shaq or Tim Duncan for 35 minutes a night.\n\nBut why are a lot of fans so down on Sheed? Well, the media could have something to do with that. And by something, I mean everything. From a recent Blakely story:\n\nNow that is just dumb on many levels. First, every team is looking for expiring contracts. So Rasheed Wallace could be averaging two technical fouls per game right now, and teams would still be lining up offers. Teams are offering good players for Raef LaFrentz right now, so I am pretty sure Sheed and his expiring deal are more desirable.\n\nAnd as far as \"his play this season\" did you not have access to the statistics cited above, which actually show that he is producing at or above what he has been doing the last three years or so? No? You're cool with gut-level reactions based on feel? OK.\n\nThis season has been hard to watch, no doubt. There is plenty of blame to be shared from the top down. But people need to stop putting inordinate amounts of blame on a guy who is essentially doing what he has always done as a player in his Detroit career."
