        "text": "The five most interesting stories, rumors and notes in the NBA:\n\n1. Cop the flop:\n\nDavid Stern's long-running rant about flopping is apparently about to produce a policy to deal with the issue -- postgame style.\n\nThe league's revamped competition committee and Stern will produce a policy in which seeming\n\n, and if a player is deemed to have flopped, he would be fined.\n\nThe outcome of the game, however, would not be changed, so the point would be to try to create a deterrent to flopping. We've yet to hear any dollar figures, but if the league is going to put any real teeth into this thing, you'd have to guess it would have to be in the four-figure range, with rising fines with each violation.\n\nWe have yet to hear from the players' union on this, so I'm thinking this has a few more hoops to jump through. Let's face it, if the NBA only fines players who flop and induce a foul call against the other team, the league would be punishing players for the wrong calls of referees. Is the league going to fine players who flop but don't produce a foul call?\n\nStill, Stern surely reflects the feelings of many fans who are tired of seeing games turn because of flops. It's hardly unique to the NBA. In a way, the Blazers' Nicolas Batum was on the same page during the Olympics, but his frustration came out in a very different way -- a\n\nas Batum released a game's worth of frustration about the Spaniards' flopping.\n\nThe NBA's solution might not be quite so impactful, coming after a sober-minded discussion of its competition committee. Earlier this year, the\n\n, which used to be made up of the 30 GMs, turning it into a mix of owners (Dan Gilbert, Joe Lacob), GMs (Bryan Colangelo, Mitch Kupchak, Kevin O'Connor, Sam Presti) and coaches (Rick Carlisle, Lionel Hollins, Doc Rivers).\n\nReally, it's a good group, but the outcome of their discussion shows just how difficult and delicate this subject is. When a player flops and the ref makes the incorrect call, the new policy will make it the player's fault, not the official's.\n\nOfficiating the NBA is a heck of a challenge -- trying to control a game played by very large men moving very fast. We've seen in the NFL a clear example of what happens when you use inferior officials, and it's easy to forget that just two years ago, we were close to such a situation in the NBA.\n\nRemember that? In 2009, the NBA locked out its refs before the start of training camp, and the resulting\n\n. Thankfully, the sides came to an agreement before the regular season, avoiding the debacle that we've seen this season in the NFL.\n\nMan, do officials, owners and players from leagues ever learn from the follies of their counterparts in other leagues (NFL refs, the NHL lockout, etc., etc.)?\n\nThere's a sensitivity about officiating in the NBA after the Tim Donaghy mess, and the league guards its refs' authority by issuing fines against coaches for criticizing officiating. Sometimes coaches take the fine to try to get a point across. A classic example in Portland is\n\nduring the Blazers' 2009 playoff series against Houston, resulting in a $25,000 fine -- and maybe more defensive leeway for Joel Przybilla and Greg Oden in defending Yao Ming in subsequent games.\n\nIn the same way, you wonder if players won't be happy to eat a fine for flopping if a flop induces a key foul that leads to a win?\n\n2. Hitting the Wall:\n\nThe Washington Wizards made a surprising announcement this morning. Their cornerstone player, point guard\n\nand will miss training camp and the first month of the regular season.\n\nWall had apparently experienced discomfort in the knee and had an MRI that revealed the injury, which the team described as a \"non-traumatic stress injury.\"\n\nIt is no fun to be a Wizards fan these days.\n\n3. Sheeeeeed:\n\nWe've seen these rumblings before, so it was easy to dismiss them when they started this summer. But it appears the rumors are true.\n\nRasheed Wallace is indeed returning to the NBA.\n\nThe New York Times' Nate Taylor reports that\n\non Thursday, and he apparently worked out with Knicks players on Saturday.\n\nWallace is 38 and hasn't played an NBA game since the 2010 NBA Finals, when he was with Boston. There were rumblings last season that he wanted to come back, but nothing ever came out of them.\n\nWallace's agent, Bill Strickland, tells Taylor that the Knicks are the only team Wallace wants to play for. He would join a team that already has Jason Kidd, 39; Kurt Thomas, 39; and Marcus Camby, 38.\n\nRasheed Wallace and the New York media ... the mind reels.\n\nThe Knicks' lone trip to Portland, by the way, isn't until March 14, so we'll see if Wallace is still around, or if Raymond Felton gets the spotlight all to himself.\n\n4. To extend or not to extend:\n\nThe Warriors figure to be an interesting team to watch if they can keep center Andrew Bogut and point guard Stephen Curry healthy. Big if, though.\n\nLast season, Curry played just 26 games, Bogut 12 and none in a Golden State uniform. Both are good enough when healthy that they could become the cornerstones of the franchise.\n\nBay Area News Group's Marcus Thompson reports that the\n\ndespite his fragile ankle but are unsure of how much to pay him. Curry is a member of the 2009 draft class, making him eligible for an extension if he signs by Oct. 31.\n\nWhen healthy, Curry looks like the next coming of Isiah Thomas. But his right ankle has been a chronic problem the last two seasons.\n\nBogut is also a question mark. He has two years (including this season) and $27 million left on the contract he signed with Milwaukee, and at some point the Warriors have to decide if he is worth a long-term commitment.\n\nGolden State could have a lot of flexibility after the 2013-14 season, after which they have only David Lee's deal (which runs through 2015-16) on its books. The current roster, with Lee, Curry, Bogut and Klay Thompson, seems to have potential, but no record of success.\n\n\"We're good on paper,\" GM Bob Myers tells Thompson. \"I guess that's better than being bad on paper. There is a lot this team has to prove, a lot individuals have to prove.\"\n\n5. We're No. 21:\n\nNo team has even started practice, but that hasn't stopped ESPN's Marc Stein from releasing\n\n. We know what you're asking, and the answer is, Stein ranks the Blazers No. 21. Stein's take on the Blazers:\n\nNot that it's set in stone, but there would be at least one good thing about having the 21st-worst record: The Blazers would have a first-round pick in the 2013 draft.\n\nThe Blazers still owe Charlotte a first-round pick for the 2011 trade that brought Gerald Wallace to Portland. That pick is top-12 protected from 2013 to 2015, meaning if the Blazers end up with a top-12 pick, they keep it.\n\nIt puts the Blazers in one of those awkward spots -- if they progress enough to finish with one of the 18 best records in the league, they risk not having a first-round pick next June (although the lottery comes into play, too).\n\n--"
