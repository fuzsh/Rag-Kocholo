They also are without Shaquille ONeal after two seasons. That means the team now belongs to the trio of Kevin Martin, LaMarcus Aldridge, and unproven Andrew Bynum. Expect growing pains and a rough record.\n\nProjected Record: 20-62\n\nProjected Starters: Andre Miller/Kevin Martin/Wilson Chandler/LaMarcus Aldridge/Andrew Bynum\n\nCharlotte Bobcats (29-53)\n\nCharlotte keeps drafting well as theyve hit with Iguodala, Williams, and Millsap, while also finding gems like Gaines, Tate, and Rivera. Jeff Green is likely to join that list and the team continues to find ways to put together talented teams. They still must truly put it together though for nor, this will likely be their best season.\n\nProjected Record: 38-44\n\nProjected Starters: Deron Williams/Andre Iguodala/Jeff Green/Paul Millsap/Clark Rivera\n\nMilwaukee Bucks (30-52)\n\nThe Bucks had reason for hope last season as Wally Szczerbiak had a great year, Kyle Lowry was a top rookie, and the monster duo of Eddy Curry and Marcin Gortat showed promise despite a lack of speed. Add promising draft picks Rodney Stuckey and Corey Brewer and theres hope for a step forward though the Playoffs are still likely far off.\n\nProjected Record: 35-47\n\nProjected Starters: Kyle Lowry/Rodney Stuckey/Wally Szczerbiak/Eddy Curry/Marcin Gortat\n\nChicago Bulls (43-39)\n\nChicago took a big swing in the offseason, acquiring Kevin Garnett and immediately putting themselves in the conversation for the best team in the East. While there are still question marks on the roster, Garnett is a star, Jalen Rose is a great #2, and Jamal Crawford can fill it up. If they can shore up the bench a bit, they could win the East or more.\n\nProjected Record: 55-27\n\nProjected Starters: Brevin Knight/Jamal Crawford/Jalen Rose/Kevin Garnett/Channing Frye\n\nCleveland Cavaliers (49-33)\n\nWhile Dwyane Wade might seem a bit behind his fellow Draft classmates James, Anthony, and Bosh, he is still the guy leading the way for a Cavs team that continues to show promise. And they got him major help this year in the form of Rashard Lewis and Jay Williams. Dont be surprised if the Cavs hoist the Larry OBrien in a few years. Or maybe even this season.\n\nProjected Record: 54-28\n\nProjected Starters: Jay Williams/Dwyane Wade/Mike Dunleavy/Rashard Lewis/Zydrunas Ilgauskas\n\nBoston Celtics (52-30)\n\nThe Celtics entered the Playoffs hot but got upset by the Hawks and things kind of fell apart. All-Star Gilbert Arenas left town and the team didnt do much to replace him. That means they should see a big drop in the standings even if Paul Pierce and Chris Kaman play as well as they typically do.\n\nProjected Record: 34-48\n\nProjected Starters: Derek Fisher/Mike Miller/Paul Pierce/Chris Webber/Chris Kaman\n\nLos Angeles Clippers (57-25)\n\nAt this point, what else do the Clippers have to do? They put together a strong team that felt like a true threat to win it and finished second in the West, only to lose to the #7 seed in the opening round. The same squad mostly returns so theyre going to see if last year was a fluke. Regardless, the regular season should go well.\n\nProjected Record: 52-30\n\nProjected Starters: Steve Francis/Quentin Richardson/Lamar Odom/Elton Brand/Erick Dampier\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (45-37)\n\nThey nearly made it to the Western Conference Finals and they had a busy offseason. While they lost Josh Howard, they added top defender Ron Artest and veteran scorer Antawn Jamison. That gives them one of the leagues better starting fives and their bench has been bolstered. They are a lowkey title contender.\n\nProjected Record: 56-26\n\nProjected Starters: Jason Williams/Michael Redd/Ron Artest/Antonio McDyess/Pau Gasol\n\nAtlanta Hawks (46-36)\n\nThe addition of Steve Nash helped propel this team into the second round and had Carmelo Anthony not gone down with an injury, they mightve made the Conference Finals. They needed help in the paint and may have found it in the form of rookie Joakim Noah and former NBA Champion Rasheed Wallace. They could take the East.\n\nProjected Record: 53-29\n\nProjected Starters: Steve Nash/Jason Terry/Carmelo Anthony/Rasheed Wallace/Joakim Noah\n\nMiami Heat (31-51)\n\nAfter finishing .500, the Heat took a huge step back despite LaMarcus Aldridge being a strong rookie. However, the team made the move for Allen Iverson. They now have an intriguing blend of veteran stars and young guns who could take this team far. Plus, Kyle Korver is now a 6th Man of the Year threat.\n\nProjected Record: 49-33\n\nProjected Starters: Shaun Livingston/Allen Iverson/Caron Butler/Yi Jianlian/Andrew Bogut\n\nNew Orleans Hornets (37-45)\n\nBrandon Roy proved to be the real deal as he won the Rookie of the Year Award. The team is still growing but pairing him with Mike Conley feels like a great foundation. They still dont have much down low but thats part of a rebuild and Thaddeus Young is versatile enough to make a difference.\n\nProjected Record: 40-42\n\nProjected Starters: Mike Conley/Brandon Roy/Tim Thomas/Thaddeus Young/Kendrick Perkins\n\nUtah Jazz (24-58)\n\nUtah felt that they were set at positions with the top prospects in the 2007 Draft so they traded the #1 pick. Oddly, they acquired Ben Gordon who is similar to JR Smith, who they already have. Regardless, the team should make strides forward even if it isnt by much because there is young talent there.\n\nProjected Record: 33-49\n\nProjected Starters: Travis Ball/Kirk Hinrich/Danny Granger/Andrei Kirilenko/Andrea Bargnani\n\nSacramento Kings (58-24)\n\nFor the first time in his career, Kobe Bryant lose an NBA Finals appearance. He didnt take that kindly that urged the front office to make moves. So, Keith Van Horn, who struggled in the Finals, moves to the bench for All-Star Carlos Boozer and they added veteran Eddie Jones. They are the favorites to win it all.\n\nProjected Record: 60-22\n\nProjected Starters: Mike Bibby/Kobe Bryant/Shane Battier/Carlos Boozer/Zach Randolph\n\nNew York Knicks (33-49)\n\nLike the Heat, the Knicks followed up a .500 record with a very down season. The same core returns with the only major addition being rookie Ramon Sessions. Was last year the real team or was that an anomaly and theyre closer to the 41 win team from a year prior? We think theyre closer to .500 than 50 losses.\n\nProjected Record: 39-43\n\nProjected Starters: Raymond Felton/Morris Peterson/Joe Johnson/Antoine Walker/Al Jefferson\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (27-55)\n\nThings were all kinds of bad in Laker Land last year. They traded away Nash, Stojakovic, and Mourning to start an official rebuild. That rebuild got a shot in the arm with the arrival of Kevin Durant. He has a legitimate shot at Rookie of the Year and should be a piece for this franchise to build around. Itll be tough this season though.\n\nProjected Record: 31-51\n\nProjected Starters: Dan Dickau/Martell Webster/Kevin Durant/Al Harrington/Jason Smith\n\nOrlando Magic (48-34)\n\nThe Magic seem destined to come up just short in the East every single year. Many felt it was time to blow the team up after last season but instead, Orlando made a major move and signed Shawn Marion. That gives them a true big three that the declining Grant Hill couldnt live up to. Throw in a good supporting cast and they have rejuvenated the squad.\n\nProjected Record: 51-31\n\nProjected Starters: Rajon Rondo/Tracy McGrady/Shawn Marion/Shareef Abdur-Rahim/Darko Milicic\n\nDallas Mavericks (46-36)\n\nWhere Shaq goes, winning has typically followed but last year was tough in Philadelphia. Joining Dallas should turn things back around as he links up with the sharpshooting duo of Nowitzki and Stojakovic, young guys like Udrih and McCants, and veterans like Van Exel and Grant Hill. Look out for a deep run from these guys.\n\nProjected Record: 58-24\n\nProjected Starters: Beno Udrih/Jerry Stackhouse/Michael Finley/Dirk Nowitzki/Theo Ratliff\n\nNew Jersey Nets (59-23)\n\nFor the second time in five years, the Nets won it all. The same core returns and with good reason. That makes them a favorite in the East again as other top teams are either still rising, unproven, or declining with age. Expect New Jersey to be in contention for it all.\n\nProjected Record: 55-27\n\nProjected Starters: Jason Kidd/Vince Carter/Richard Jefferson/Kenyon Martin/Marcus Camby\n\nDenver Nuggets (47-35)\n\nDenver made the big leap forward to the Playoffs thanks to a huge season by Corey Maggette and Most Improved Player Devin Harris. They got a steal in the draft when they found Marc Gasol as he has showed out in preseason and could be the missing piece for them to take another step.\n\nProjected Record: 50-32\n\nProjected Starters: Devin Harris/Corey Maggette/Hedo Turkoglu/David Lee/Marc Gasol\n\nIndiana Pacers (46-36)\n\nIndiana found themselves back in the Playoffs behind the ONeal/Howard duo and Marcus Williams as a floor general. While they lost Ron Artest and didnt do much to replace him, there are enough veterans who can blend with the young guns to keep this team in the middle of the East pack.\n\nProjected Record: 46-36\n\nProjected Starters: Marcus Williams/Derek Anderson/Bonzi Wells/Jermaine ONeal/Dwight Howard\n\nDetroit Pistons (51-31)\n\nThe Pistons found themselves in the Conference Finals again but they lost to the Nets. The team that won the title in 2004 remains mostly intact, yet it feels like its probably time to move on. Theyll still win a lot of games and they added to the bench but this team is likely done winning titles.\n\nProjected Record: 48-34\n\nProjected Starters: Chauncey Billups/Richard Hamilton/Tayshaun Prince/Chris Bosh/Ben Wallace\n\nToronto Raptors (25-57)\n\nFor the most part, Toronto is in the same position as last year. Theyre the young team that is still looking to build and grow together. That means growing pains but Nelson took another step forward, Redick and Sefolosha were very good as rookies, and Louis Williams is electric. However, David West continues to disappoint and they need something from the paint to move forward.\n\nProjected Record: 27-55\n\nProjected Starters: Jameer Nelson/JJ Redick/Thabo Sefolosha/David West/Jarron Collins\n\nHouston Rockets (49-33)\n\nThe Rockets choice to not give up after moving Steve Francis was a great choice as the Ray Allen/Yao Ming duo nearly won 50 games. They were upset in the Playoffs but they added some notable role players who can help them stay in the same position and make a deeper playoff run. The loss of Jay Williams will hurt though.\n\nProjected Record: 45-37\n\nProjected Starters: Sam Cassell/Ray Allen/Luol Deng/Jonathan Bender/Yao Ming\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (44-38)\n\nIt looked like the Spurs would be mediocre last year as they were battered by injuries, including losing Manu Ginobili for the season. They got hot late and still made it to the Playoffs, taking Sacramento to seven games. Rookie Spencer Hawes is the new man in the middle as they look to regain their crown. If they stay healthy, theyre a safe bet to do so.\n\nProjected Record: 56-26\n\nProjected Starters: Tony Parker/Stephen Jackson/Gerald Wallace/Tim Duncan/Brendan Haywood\n\nPhoenix Suns (42-40)\n\nThe loss of Shawn Marion marks a major change for a team that has been stuck in 42-45 win hell for years. That might signal a rebuild around Amare Stoudemire (who re-upped) but that likely means moving Stephon Marbury or acquiring other vets. Right now, they look like a team on the outside.\n\nProjected Record: 34-48\n\nProjected Starters: Stephon Marbury/Allan Houston/Nicholas Alexander/Amare Stoudemire/Emeka Okafor\n\nSeattle Supersonics (23-59)\n\nThe injury to Chris Paul certainly hurt but Seattle was in trouble before that. The magic from the previous season was gone and now so is Rashard Lewis. Instead, they have #1 pick Al Horford, Dion Glover, and PJ Brown. Itll be another year of rebuilding but Paul, Horford, and Josh Smith sounds like a solid core.\n\nProjected Record: 24-58\n\nProjected Starters: Chris Paul/Dion Glover/Josh Smith/PJ Brown/Al Horford\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves (41-41)\n\nKevin Garnett was traded away and youd think Minnesota was starting from scratch. Then they signed Gilbert Arenas AND his backup from Boston, J.R. Bremer, along with Josh Howard. Suddenly, they have a good starting five and should be in contention for the Playoffs this year.\n\nProjected Record: 43-39\n\nProjected Starters: Gilbert Arenas/Josh Howard/Ricky Davis/Stromile Swift/Tyson Chandler\n\nPortland Trail Blazers (48-34)\n\nLeBron James is somehow still getting better and had one of the best seasons in league history en route to the MVP Award. Can he keep rising? He will have to as the team lost their starting point guard and the 6th Man of the Year moves into the starting lineup. Portland should hover around the same part of the standings but something must give to take the next step.\n\nProjected Record: 47-35\n\nProjected Starters: Speedy Claxton/Jerry Stackhouse/LeBron James/Jamal Mashburn/Etan Thomas\n\nGolden State Warriors (43-39)\n\nTrading away Antawn Jamison made the Warriors another franchise doing something new this year. They also chose not to start over, signing Baron Davis to pair with Jason Richardson. Marcus Fizer also moves into the starting lineup as this team looks to be one of the top offensive squads.\n\nProjected Record: 44-38\n\nProjected Starters: Baron Davis/Monta Ellis/Jason Richardson/Marcus Fizer/Adin Durmanenko\n\nWashington Wizards (19-63)\n\nLife was difficult in Washington this year and that doesnt seem like it will change. Rudy Gay and Greg Oden are good building blocks, as are Sebastian Telfair and Leandro Barbosa. Marvin Williams and Michael Sweetney have disappointed though and Larry Hughes has been a mess since signing an extension. Theres nowhere to go but up though.\n\nProjected Record: 23-59\n\nProjected Starters: Sebastian Telfair/Larry Hughes/Rudy Gay/Kurt Thomas/Greg Oden\n\nTshirt in shorts likes this."
