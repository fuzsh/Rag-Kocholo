        "text": "On January, 16th, 1914 G.F. Proskura has headed hydraulic laboratory and on its basis has created faculty of a hydromechanics. During the Second World War the Institute was evacuated to the Urals, where a number of academic institutions were created on its basis. Immediately after the war, the Energy Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine was divided into two institutions: the Institute of Heat Power Engineering of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the Electrical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine with location in Kiev.At the same time, the Kharkov branch of the Institute of Heat Power Engineering of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine was formed, which was by the offer of G.F. Proskura in 1948 merged with the Laboratory of high-speed machines of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, formed by him in the war.\n\nLed by academician G.F. Proskura the Laboratory addressed tasks assigned to science, including assign ments for increasing the power, reliability and durability of the turbomachinery. During this period, special attention was paid to the study of hydraulic machines.\n\nIn 1955, the Laboratory for high-speed machines and mechanisms of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine by the offer of G.F. Proskura was reorganized into the Laboratory of Hydraulic Machines of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, which, by the recommendation of G.F. Proskura was headed by the academician of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, A.P. Filippov.\n\nFamous scientists who worked at the Department of hydraulic machines:"
