The device includes a gate pulse generator, a mixer, a measuring circuit, and a final recording instrument (see Fig. 1). The design increases the measurement precision. The measuring circuit is made in the form of two autocompensation circuits each of which is assembled from an amplifier, a single flip-flop oscillator, and an emitter follower, all of which arb connected in seriej. A signal (combined with a gate pulse) is fed to the input of one of the autocompansation circuits. The outputs of the autocompensation circuits are connected through a differential stage to the input of the final recording Card 1/2 zTT ACC NRt AP6035704 H I oircuit; 2 - recording instrumentl 3 - differantial _J; stagev 4,- mixerl :5--,tunnel diode. instrument, In order to broaden the pans bandj the Mixer-isimido withatunnel diode.

Defence of this standard by G.M.Rautian et al. (Ref-1), on the grounds that the international practice is based on a. card i/i material standard, is regarded as inadequate and the author joins forces with Prof.A.I.Tudorovskiy (Ref.2) by supplying practical reasons for return to the international standard.

The most frequently used scales are the wavelength A, the wave number n and 1n4.

The problem reduces to solving a homogeneous Fredholm in~- tegral equation with a symmetrical positive definite kernel. The bandwidth occupied by the \"ideal\" pulst (in which 95Fk of the total energy of the pulse is contained) is determined. Card 1/1 AUTHOR: Gurevich, M. S.

Numerical values of the frequency bandwidth occupied with pulse transmissions are determined. The distribution of the pulse energy in the frequency band is examined mathematically for various shapes of pulsefl. An \"ideal\" signal is a signal whose maximum energy is concentrated within a pre-set frequency band. The distribution of energy within the pulses of various shapes is compared with the distribution of energy within the \"ideal\" signal. On the basis of the Fourier integral for pulse spectrum, an expression of the function of energy distribution within the frequency band (formula 4) is developed. Square, trape- zoidal, triangular, cosinusoidal and cosine-square pulse shapes are considered. Bandwidths A!!Nf expressed in terms of the parameter k (formula 8) are deter- mined for all of the above pulse shapes. Bandwidths in bands are summarized Card 1/2 iog-z-i-6/17 Frequency Band Occupied in Pulse Transmission in a table at the end of the article. This table shows that the cosinusoidal pulse has the narrowest bandwidth (Z-l/Z ba?mds). There are four figures, one table, and one Soviet reference in the article.

The increase in the filling of the frequency spectrum, the reasons for its in- adequacy in radio frequencies, the technical obBtables to the complete use of the spectrum are analyzed. Basic definitions refering to the emission pass band of radio stations are given. The shape of a signal or given duration which would permit the greatest part of the energy to be concentrated in a given frequency band is presented; the impulse of optimum shape is compared with impulses of other shapes. The frequ-,ncy band occupied by the transmission of radio telegraph signals with amplitude and frequency manipiLlation is determined. Methods and apparatus to measure the frequency band width emitted by radio tele- graph transmitters are presented. In conclusiono recommendations are made which are directed toward the improvement of the use of the radio frequency spectrum. A A UT!

In addition, recent radio communication methods, FMI, TV and radar requre larger chan- nels than the AM broadcasting stations. Considering the difficulties encountered in shifting some of the radio com- munication methods to higher frequencies, the author points out that the existing difficulties in the availability of Card 112 wave ranges may be overcome by a better utilization of the The Radio Frequency Spectrum and Its Utilization SOV/111-58-4-1-1/34 frequency channels below 30 megacycles. He recommends the application of directional antennas, receivers with a higher sensitivity, stabilization of the transmitter frequency, improved modulation systems, whereby the intervals between the transmitter frequencies may be reduced. 1.

The spectra for the signal of -Eqs (2) are expressed by 94 (3) for n = 1 1 Eq (4) for n = 2 Eq (5) for n = 3 , while for n ;P2 , the spectra are given by Eq (6). If it is necessary to have a signal consisting of a rectangular portion contained between /2 and -e.112 and having the edges (-Y/2, -'tl/2) and ('r,/2,. '9/2) , this can be described by Eqs (7). It can be shown that for this signal, the rate of the decr4ase ot'the spectrum with frequency is not less than C/w There are 3 Soviet references.

The shape of such pulses is shown in Figure 1. The frequency band in defined as the band which contains 99y9 of the total pulse energy. Such pulses are described by the expression: Cardl/3 05373 h .59-8-5/12 S?v/6o6- The Frequency-band, occupied when Pulses osine squared \"Rounding\" are Transmitted 2 UM = A cos Tr z + 1) (t 2 - when - < t 't, x it - (t \\ 2 2 \"I (t < 't7 2 2 U(t) =-A U(t) = A cos2 t _r - Iq 2 and the spectral density of the pulse energy is given in Eq (2) , where 'tjl-C and Ic =- wt /2 . The formula for the fraction of the energy n in a given frequency band is given by Eq M.

Comparison of the equations with those of Ref 1 shows that for large values of k -the envelope of the frequency spectrum of trapezoidal pulses reduces proportionally to 1/k 2 ,but for pulses with cosine-squared rounding, 3 proportionally to l/k . Therefore, pulses with cosine- squared rounding have the advantage of more rapid reduction in the radiation outside the band. There are 3 figures, 1 table and 2 Soviet references.

S., Member of the Society TIT LE Cosine Cubic Pulses,3 Y PERIODICAL: Radiotekhnika, 1960, Vol. 15, No- 5, pp. 60-63 TEXT: Pulses formed according to the first and second cosine power are used in radio engineering and electrocommunication. Certain advantages are occasionally achieved if the pulses are formed according to higher powers, especially the third power. The present paper deals with such pulses which are designated as cosine cubic pulses. The energy distribu- tion of the cosine, the cosine square, and the cosine cubic pulses is diagrammatically shown in Fig. 2. In accordance with the definitions of the CCIR (Comit6 Consultatif International des Radiocommunications), the bandwidth is the frequency band that comprises 99 per cent of the total emission. Therefore, the frequency bandwidth of pulses formed according to the n-th cosine power is determined by a value k at which 'rfn - 0-99 ~ is the energy distribution in the frequency band. A table shows a com-, parison between cosine, cosine square, and cosine cubic pulses. From this Card 1/2 x 8130 Cosine Cubic Pulses 3/108J60/015/05/06/008 B007/BO14 it follows that cosine cubic pulses have the advantage that with a rise in frequency the emissions outside the band decrease rapidly. moreover, these pulses secure a short settling time.

It is shown that the properties of signals can be more rea- dily analyzedg if the latter are represented as sequences of time- shifted functions. By considering the energy spectrum of a sequence of time-shifted signals, it is shown that the problem of reducing channel interference amounts to finding an elementary signal which would create noises of minimal energy during the transmission, For- mulas are derived for the energy spectrum; the latter is expressed in the form of a product of 2 spectral functions, one of which is the energy spectrum of the elementary signal, and the other is re- lated to a signal, expressed as the sum of 6-functions. Formulas are derived for the spectra of uncorrelated signals; one obtains: Card 1/3 S/108/62/017/003/001/OOQ, On reducing adjacent-channel D299/D301 n n R (W) = lim -L 7 A~ + lim \\ AiAj cos w(i-j)T.

Conclusions: 1) The influence of 'noises on a receiver depends not only on the energy of the disturbance, but also on the statis- tical character of the signal and on the type of receiver,, 2) If -the receiver is tuned at a frequencyq sufficiently far from the center of the disturbance spectrum, and its bandpass can be consi- dered as rectangular, then the influence of the disturbing signal can be readily determined in the case of uncorrelated signal-se- quences, If, in addition, the disturbance has independent amplita- des. then the noise resembles a white noise,, It increases the back.- ground noise of the channel and causes a great loss in the trans- mitting power of the channel, 3) If the signals are uncorrelaiedg their spectrum can be directly compared with that of elementary sig- nals, transmitted by the same oyotein under the coriditlon theit arl Card 2/3 S/108/62/017,-*;)07/001/OC9 On reducing adjacent-channel D299/D301 integrator be connected to the receiver output, 4) In case of a correlated 5equence of signals, the energy spectrum flucuates with -respect to that of the elementary signal. These fluctuations de- pend on the bandpass of the receiver and on the difference between the tuning frequency and the mean frequency of the signal,. For mea- suring the disturbances (in case of correlated signals), it is most expedient to replace such a signal either by white noises, moduiat- ing the transmitter (in case of radiotelephony) or by a periodic sequence of signals (in case of radiotelegraphy~.

This article is a general practical survey of the proble 'm regarding the reduction of interferences between adjacent channels by choosing an appro- priate (optimum) shape of the signal pulses. The article is intended, not for specialists, but for engineers who are insufficiently acquainted with this prob- lem. The first chapter of the article contains some practical considerations on the choice of the shape of pulses in amplitude-keying and frequency-keying. The second chapter deals with linear filters in keying circuits. (Some spectral characteristics obtained after filtration are reproduced in this chapter, which show that filtration permits improving considerably the utilization of the radio- frequency spectrum.) A nonlinear system for forming signals (in which the rec- tangular signal is first converted into a trapezoidal one, the angles of the Card 1/2 S/106/62/000/008/004/009 Forming of pulses in transmitter keying for .... .- A055/A1O1 trapezium being then rounded off) is described in the third and last chapter of the article.
