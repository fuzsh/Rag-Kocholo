        "text": "Back from holydays, it’s time to do a recap of what we (probably) missed in the last week concerning 𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: · The US Air Force has been awarded to produce the world’s first full-scale #blendedwingbody aircraft. The demonstrator could pave the way for a multirole long-range tanker-transport (and, in my humble opinion, also for civil applications). · The Navy’s #FAXX program (not to be confused with the NGAD) has completed concept refinement and has moved into a design maturation phase. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are in the running for the airframe, while GE Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney are competing for the engine (what a surprise uh?). · The discussions between Germany and France about #FCAS sixth-gen fighter are still unsettled. The two countries have different views on how to fund the project and who the jets should be sold to. In addition, it seems that also Dassault and Airbus haven’t figured out how to split the activities expected in the program. · The relationship between France and India is intensifying. Recently Safran announced new investments in the Asian country with three new plants, but now India selected 183 #Rafales to renew its aerial military force. #militaryaviation\n\nWe are proud to announce that Ashlea Components Ltd has become a #JOSCAR registered supplier with Hellios Information. This prestigious recognition represents a significant milestone in our continuing commitment to delivering exceptional products and services in the aerospace, security and defence sectors. The #JOSCAR register is a central register of approved suppliers which are used by several major defence organisations including BAE Systems, NATS, Rolls-Royce, Airbus Defence and Space and the UK Ministry of Defence when implementing new projects. The register is strictly invite-only and requires successful completion of a qualification process. #JOSCAR is a collaborative tool used by the #Aerospace, #Defence and #Security industry to act as a single repository for pre-qualification and compliance information. Using #JOSCAR can determine if a supplier is “fit for business” #joscar #ministryofdefence #hellios #ads #makeukdefence #ministryofdefence #baesystems #baemarine #babcock #leonardo #qinetiq #nats #mbdamissilesystems #generaldynamics #rollsroyce #roke #leidos #raytheon #chemringcountermeasures #elbitsystems #lockheedmartin #boeing #atkins #draken #A&P #atlaselectronik #aquila\n\nDuring World War II, a significant event unfolded as captured German Luftwaffe aircraft were transported onboard the HMS Reaper for examination and testing in England. This historical photograph not only showcases the captured aircraft but also highlights Germany's advanced technology, particularly in jet propulsion. The presence of these jets on the HMS Reaper underscores the technological prowess of the German Luftwaffe during that era, offering valuable insights into the advancements made in aviation technology during World War II. #military #defense #defence #aerospace #aviation #aircraft #aircrafts #airplane #airplanes #aviationlovers #militaryaviation #militaryaircraft #fighterjet #engineering #technology #militarytechnology #defensetechnology #defenseinnovation #defenseindustry #airforce #WWII #worldwarII #germany #england #uk #propulsion\n\nThe XF-91 Thunderceptor stands out as a unique aircraft in aviation history, distinguished by its innovative design featuring inverse tapered wings, a rare feature not seen in other aircraft of its time. Notably, the second prototype of the Thunderceptor was adorned with a striking V-tail, adding an element of elegance to its appearance.This exceptional aircraft not only showcased advanced engineering but also boasted a distinctive aesthetic appeal, with the V-tail enhancing its visual allure. In the realm of experimental aircraft, the XF-91 Thunderceptor garnered attention for its unconventional design elements and forward-thinking approach to aerodynamics. #military #defense #defence #aerospace #aviation #aircraft #aircrafts #airplane #airplanes #aviationlovers #militaryaviation #militaryaircraft #fighterjet #engineering #technology #militarytechnology #defensetechnology #defenseinnovation #defenseindustry #airforce\n\nThe history of MiG aircraft dates back to 1939, when Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich founded the design bureau that would bear their initials. The first MiG aircraft were propeller-driven fighters produced in modest numbers during World War II. However, it was the MiG-9, which debuted in 1946, that marked the beginning of jet propulsion for the MiG design bureau. Despite the challenges faced by the MiG design bureau in the post-Communist era, it continued to develop advanced fighter concepts, including the 1.42 multifunctional fifth-generation fighter. #military #defense #defence #aerospace #aviation #aircraft #aircrafts #airplane #airplanes #aviationlovers #militaryaviation #militaryaircraft #fighterjet #engineering #technology #militarytechnology #defensetechnology #defenseinnovation #defenseindustry #airforce #MIG\n\nMilitary technology consistently pushes the boundaries of what's possible, exemplifying the pinnacle of #innovation and #engineering. Take, for example, the F-35 Lightning II helmet, a marvel of modern #aviation that commands a price tag of USD 400,000. 😀 While it's amusing to imagine piloting such an #aircraft just to cruise in a car, this thought underscores the sheer fascination I have with cutting-edge military advancements. Such technologies not only redefine the landscape of #defense but also fuel advancements in numerous #civilian applications, highlighting the symbiotic relationship between #military #innovation and #commercial technology. 🙋♀️ This intersection is where I find my #passion ignited, marveling at how far human #ingenuity can go in pursuit of #security, #efficiency, and the #future of tech."
