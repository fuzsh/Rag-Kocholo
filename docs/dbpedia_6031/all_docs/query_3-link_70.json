Why waste time, effort and negotiation time for just a handful of old jets.\n\nOriginally Posted by skanchan95 (Post 4177608)\n\nIf they can be bought for cheap, all well & good. Other than an IFR probe, externally they are same as the IAF's MiG-29Bs. The MiG-29Ns can be absorbed into existing Fulcrum squadrons (28, 47 & 223) after upgrading them to IAF's 29UPG standards.\n\nOriginally Posted by smartcat (Post 4177796)\n\nAny idea when the Malaysians acquired these birds? From what I've read, a fighter aircraft has an airframe life of only 6000 to 8000 hours.\n\n@ V.Narayan\n\nWhen an airframe gets old, does the whole aircraft need to be junked?\n\nOriginally Posted by abhishek46 (Post 4177802)\n\nI was wondering what really is the benefit of buying these used 90s tech fighters.\n\nWhy waste time, effort and negotiation time for just a handful of old jets.\n\nOriginally Posted by smartcat (Post 4177820)\n\n1) Immediate delivery. If you buy new planes, it will take 3 years.\n\n2) 10 or 12 might be a small number - but if this works out, India can sign similar deals with other countries too.\n\n3) This is Pakistan Air Force strategy. It has served them well, I might add.\n\n4) A new aircraft (like Rafale or F16 or Gripen) has a huge learning curve (pilot training, tactics etc).\n\n5) With Mig 29, no issues with weapons integration.\n\n6) Can be upgraded!\n\nOriginally Posted by abhishek46 (Post 4177802)\n\nI was wondering what really is the benefit of buying these used 90s tech fighters.

These planes are useful for India because IAF already operates 3 squadrons of MiG 29 and hence it makes sense logistically. We aren't buying a new aircraft type. In the past also India has purchased such odd lots of planes it already operates.\n\nOriginally Posted by smartcat (Post 4178524)\n\n:)\n\nOK, so you noticed that too. F16 with conformal fuel tanks looks like a cancerous growth on the airframe.\n\nAttachment 1627331\n\nBut I guess these are war machines, not participants in Concours d'Elegance!\n\nOriginally Posted by himanshugoswami (Post 4178529)\n\nI remember reading a quote from a fighter pilot. Dont remember it exactly but it went something like this:\n\n\"I dont know why, but I've noticed that the prettier an aircraft is, the easier it is to fly\"\n\nOriginally Posted by himanshugoswami (Post 4178529)\n\nDont remember it exactly but it went something like this:\n\n\"I dont know why, but I've noticed that the prettier an aircraft is, the easier it is to fly\""
