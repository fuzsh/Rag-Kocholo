Gurevich posted a 21-5 record at #1 singles, earned Second Team All-UAA accolades and finished the campaign ranked #12 in the ITA Northeast Region rankings.\n\nA 1987 graduate of NYU’s School of Business and Public Administration with a Bachelor of Science degree in management and marketing, Choy was a two-year member of the Violets’ men’s tennis team. Also serving as a tennis instructor at NYU, Choy has been a United States Professional Tennis Association (USPTA) certified teaching pro since 1990.\n\nPrior to coming to NYU, Choy spent five seasons as the Head Girls’ Tennis Coach at New York City’s Hunter High School. His teams compiled a 38-2 record during his tenure at the school and three times advanced to the semifinals of the Public School Athletic League (PSAL) playoffs. Choy helped lead Hunter to the PSAL Championship match in 1990 and to two semifinal appearances in the Mayor’s Cup competition.\n\nChoy has also worked at many prestigious tennis clubs around New York City, including the East River Tennis Club, the Crosstown Tennis Club, and at the USTA National Tennis Center, home of the U.S. Open.\n\n“I have always enjoyed the camaraderie that comes with team sports,” Choy said. “Tennis also allows you to work on aspects of the game on your own. In a match, the player is out there on the line and you have to rely on your own character. I believe that playing college tennis really gives you the best of both worlds, and I really enjoy the challenge of helping my players through that.”\n\nCHOY’S YEAR-BY-YEAR RECORD\n\nYear Overall 2007-08 10-9 2008-09 7-8 2009-10 4-11 2010-11 7-6 2011-12 10-7 2012-13 8-6 2013-14 8-3 2014-15 4-9 2015-16 5-10 2016-17 10-4 2017-18 5-10 2018-19 7-8 2019-20* 1-2 2020-21** ----- 2021-22 2-10 2022-23 7-8 2023-24 5-10 TOTALS 100-12 (.450)\n\n* Season suspended due to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n** Season canceled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic"
