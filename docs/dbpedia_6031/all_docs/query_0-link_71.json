        "text": "Product 9-12, MiG-29\n\nMiG-29 it's a front-line fighter, designed in seventies to cooperate with a bigger air-superiority fighter Sukhoi Su-27, in a military programme called LFI, Light Front-line Fighter. In Mikoyan design bureau obtain a designation 9-12, first flight of the prototype 9-12-1: 6th October 1977 with Alexandyer Fyedotov in controls.\n\n\"Fathers\" of the MiG-29 are: Mikoyan Design Bureau head Rostislav Byelyakov and the main designer A. A. Chumachyenko, later Mikhail Waldenberg and Valeriy Novikov.\n\nThere were 19 prototypes built since 1977 and 6 pre-production aircraft, in total 25 airframes were used to tests, numbers are from #01 to #25.\n\nProduct 9-12 is first variant of serial MiG-29, produced for USSR air force between 1982 and 1986, serial production under factory designation \"5\" in Lukhovitsy near Moskow (MAPO MiG), in military service since June 1983. MiG-29 (9-12A) was produced for export between 1986 and 1990, for Warsaw Pact countries* (MiG-29A) and non-Warsaw Pact countries (MiG-29B). Export variants have deprecated possibilities.\n\n1986: India\n\n1987: Yugoslavia\n\n1988: Syria, North Korea, German Democratic Republic, Iraq\n\n1989: Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania\n\n1990: Iran, Cuba\n\n* between WP countries only Hungary not bought MiG-29 from USSR.\n\nMiG-29 (9-12) is in Soviet Air Force since 1993, first 9-12 of the early production serie landed in Kubinka (234th IAP) 30th June of the year 1983, even before state certificate of type was issued for the MiG-29! It's certainly not the MiG-29 that we know, with its smaller rudders, no overwings chaff/flares dispensers, small ventral fins below the stabilizers, different mudguard and totally different camouflage (green-darkgreen-sand-cinnamon and lightblue). Later aircraft of early series were delivered to Black-Sea regiments (and probably even upgraded to the common 9-12 standard and repainted). After the end of the USSR inherited by Moldova and Ukraine.\n\nVery early MiG-29 9-12, in fact second serial MiG-29, Soviet Air Force, Kubinka 1983. Camouflage is very similar to at least nine aircraft (#01 - #09) delivered in 1983, probably three colours: green, brown (cinnamon) and sand, maybe fourth colour: lightgreen (green is dominant). A kind of the remembrance of that camouflage will be later a Czechoslovakian and East German MiGs in the years between 1988 and 1989. Drawing accuracy: very approximated colours and shapes, due to lack of photos.\n\nMiG-29 9-13 in 4-tone camouflage. That kind of camouflage wasn't much popular, because MiGs-29 were painted in standard schema, but to at least one regiment MiGs were delivered from factory in four-tone camouflage with dominant cinnamon or sand (plus green and a little bit of darkgreen). It was the 115th GvIAP, in ÐÐ¾ÐºÐ°Ð¹Ð´Ñ (Kokaydi), Uzbekistan, not so far from Termez. Two squadrons of the regiment, previously equipped with MiG-21bis, were named \"Moskva\" (Moskov) and \"Sovietskaya Litva\" (Soviet Lithuania). Aircraft #08 was presented in 1992 during Mosaeroshow. When Soviet Union splits, regiment was renamed to 61st IAP, its aircraft in Kokaydi were inherited by Uzbekistan, and used up to day. Drawing accuracy: 100%, area between fins is unknown.\n\nSoviet MiGs-29 in East Europe\n\n1986-1994\n\nBetween 1986 and 1989 in some regiments of Soviet forces in East European countries (German Democratic Republic, Hungary and Czechoslovakia) MiGs-29 began to replace MiGs-21 and MiGs-23, while in Poland were deployed greater Sukhois Su-27. In each regiment were more than 30 MiGs and about 4-6 MiGs-23UB for training (not too many MiGs-29UB in that time were already delivered!). Regiments belonged to 16th Air Army (Western Group of Forces, Germany), 36th Air Army (Southern Group of Forces, Hungary), 4th Air Army (Northern Group of Forces, Poland, not MiG-29 at all) and Central Group of Forces, Czechoslovakia.\n\nMiG-29 #29, 968th regiment, Soviet Western Group of Forces in GDR, Altenburg-Nobitz, about 1990. Very interesting MiG-29 from early production series 9-12. Drawing accuracy: 100%, but only one side.\n\nMiG-29 9-12 #21, 733rd regiment, Soviet Western Group of Forces in GDR, Damgarten, about 1990. Very interesting non-standard camouflage on aircraft #21 and #44, painted in similar way (even more extreme) were also #09 and #33. Drawing accuracy: 100%, but only one side.\n\nMiG-29 9-12 #08, 33rd regiment, Soviet Western Group of Forces in GDR, Wittstock, about 1990. Standard camouflage. Some aircraft wear the regiment's emblem (#01, #08, #36, #37, #39, #55UB and #64UB) with MiG's-29 siluette and winged aurochs. Drawing accuracy: 100%, but only one side.\n\nMiG-29 9-13 #83, 787th regiment, Soviet Western Group of Forces in GDR, Finow, about 1990. Standard camouflage. On aircraft in excellent technical state was painted (both sides of the fuselage) a sign called \"ÐÑÐ»Ð¸ÑÐ½ÑÐ¹ ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð¾Ð»ÐµÑ\" (Distinguished Aircraft): #75, #79, #82, #84. Drawing accuracy: 100%, but only one side.\n\nGerman Democratic Republic\n\n33 IAP, Wittstock\n\n773 IAP, Damgarten (PÃ¼tnitz)\n\n787 IAP, Finow (Eberswalde)\n\n31 GvIAP, Falkenberg (Alt LÃ¶nnewitz)\n\n85 GvIAP, Merseburg\n\n968 IAP, Altenburg (Nobitz)\n\n35 IAP, Zerbst\n\n73 GvIAP, KÃ¶then\n\nabout 256 MiGs-29\n\nHungary\n\n14 IAP, KiskunlachÃ¡za\n\n515 IAP, SÃ¡rmellÃ©k\n\n5 IAP, TÃ¶kÃ¶l\n\nabout 96 MiGs\n\nCzechoslovak Socialist Republic\n\n114 IAP Milovice\n\nbarely 10 MiGs\n\nSome of these regiments have had a nuclear capability from the mid-1970s, and had nuclear weaponry stored at their bases (for example Kluczewo near Stargard SzczeciÅski, Chojna, Bagicz in Poland, Milovice in Czechoslovakia, KiskunlachÃ¡za in Hungary) in Granit-2 shelters.\n\nEven MiG-29 9-12 (only Soviet variant, not exports 9-12A or 9-12B!) can carry a nuclear bomb RN-40 (30 kT TNT) on reinforced central pylon, as many other Soviet front-line fighters and bombers (MiG-21, MiG-23, MiG-27, Su-7, Su-27, Su-24, Su-25) and helicopters.\n\nBasic camouflage\n\nBasic standard camouflage of the serial MiG-29 9-12. Only few MiGs-29 in 1983 have green-cinnamon camouflage, because for new fighter was designed a special painting schema with grey background and greybluegreen blotches on upper surfaces, applied on all serial MiGs. Shapes were slightly modified on each aircraft; the basic camouflage have a variants (esp. for export). A \"Guard\" badge is painted in guardian regiments as standard. Numbers could be red, white, yellow, orange, lightblue or blue with white, yellow, blue or red outlines, each regiment distinguished itself by that colours. Drawing accuracy: it's only a schema of the camouflage and markings.\n\nMiG-29 9-12 early production series, Soviet Navy. Early MiGs in 1983 were distinctly different from serial MiG-29 9-12. Only about 60 MiGs were used by the aviation of the \"ÐÐ¾ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾-ÐÐ¾ÑÑkÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¤Ð»Ð¾t CCCP\" (Soviet Navy), primarily in 100th IKIAP in Saki-4, later in 86th IAP in Markuleshty, Moldova, and 161st IAP in Novo-Fyedorovka [Limanskoye], Crimea, Ukraine. Numbers #90 #91 #92 #93 and #94 are very rare used for MiG-29 in first, second or third squadron of the regiment! Drawing accuracy: 100%, but it's only from one side.\n\nIn Soviet Socialists Turkmen Republic there'e was the TsBP ÑÐµÐ½ÑÑ Ð±Ð¾ÐµÐ²Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð¼ÐµÐ½ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ (Centre of the Combat Preparation). The 1521th Air Base in ÐÐ°ÑÑ-1 (Mary-1) gets the MiGs-29 to replace MiG-23MLD relatively late in eighties and from another units. Althrough soon unit was disbanded, it's remarkable because it plays a role of \"Agressors\" on air exercises. aircraft of the two squadrons gets full set of special markings.\n\nEarly series production MiG-29 9-12 in a role of an \"Agressor\", Air Base Mary-1, about 1991. Aircraft from 2nd Squadron: white canopy cover, hornet, shark's mouth, and even US-Navy-style letters \"AM\" (for Aviabaza Mary). Drawing accuracy: I'm not sure of the colours of the air base badge (damned black-and-white photos).\n\nProduct 9-13, MiG-29\n\nStandard camouflage of the serial MiG-29 9-13. Markings and emblems were the same as on 9-12. Note: looks that in Soviet air forces that type of camouflage was used not only on 9-13, but also on exported 9-12 (Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, India, Yugoslavia). Drawing accuracy: it's only a schema of the camouflage and markings.\n\nSecond version of MiG-29 is product 9-13 (factory designation \"7\") with enlarged back, when additional fuel tank is installed and L203 \"Gardenia-1\" jamming station (the pattern for serial production was MiG-29 1616 numer #26, after upgrade first flight in January 1987). Main target for the modification was a greater operational radius. In production between 1986 and 1991 in Lukhovitsy. Improved radar, avionics and possibilities to carry two external PTB-1150 fuel tanks under wings. New aircraft were at first delivered to units in Soviet forces in Germany. Product 9-13 wasn't exported (except to North-Korea in 1989).\n\nDespite that MiG-29 has limited air-to-ground attack possibilites, the aircraft was used by fighter-bomber aviation. One regiment in Odessa air army, 642nd APIB in Voznyeyensk ÐÐ°ÑÑÑÐ½Ð¾Ð²ÐºÐ° (Martinovka), and second 927th APIB regiment in ÐÐµÑÐµÐ·Ð° (Byeryeza), Belarus. To perform a fighter-bomber aviation tasks, aircraft use bombs weight 50-500 kg, gun and unguided rockets S-8. aircraft 9-13 in Martinovka were painted in 4-tone camouflage schema (green-lightgreen-cinnamon-sand), and were delivered from Lukhovitsy factory (few on them were in 1989 shifted to Markuleshty).
