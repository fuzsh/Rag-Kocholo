        "text": "If youâd dropped by the BU Beach on a Saturday morning 25 years ago, youâd likely have seen a group of Shelton Hall (now Kilachand Hall) buddies tossing a football. Much at Boston University has changed since then, but on a Saturday in September the men passing the football behind Marsh Chapelâand even the pigskin itselfâwere the same.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of tables and red-and-white blankets set up for the Alumni Weekend BU Beach Picnic, Martin Leibold (ENGâ89), Bill Schineller (ENGâ89), and Rob Napieralski (CASâ89) reminisced about their college days, from midnight cheeseburgers at the now-shuttered Charlieâs Kitchen to the day a fellow classmate broke the future Mrs. Napieralskiâs ankle during an ill-advised tackle. âWe never stopped giving him a hard time about that,â said Napieralski.\n\nThe men were among thousands of alums who returned to Comm Ave for more than 150 Alumni Weekend events, from award ceremonies and panels to concerts and college-specific gatherings, September 19 to 21.\n\nReady, set, design\n\nCollege of Engineering alums filled the Photonics Center Colloquium Room with cheers, laughs, and chants as four teams competed in a design challenge. Each group of ENG grads, students, and faculty huddled over a table littered with parts ranging from battery packs and circuit boards to balloons and Popsicle sticks. Their goal? Design a small vehicle that could propel itself along the length of four tables end to end.\n\nMinimotors buzzed, vehicles careened (or crawled), and unmanned aerial vehicles delivered additional supplies. Michael Runci (ENGâ68,â74, GSMâ74), whose vehicle carried a small plush bear in a Red Sox shirt, enjoyed the camaraderie with fellow alums and âseeing the young mixed with the old.â The Florida resident was drawn back to BU for his first alumni visit by ENGâs 50th anniversary. âItâs a tremendous milestone,â he says. âItâs fun to be a part of this.â\n\nFrom Beantown mobsters to Game of Thrones\n\nThe College of Communication held a series of talks to celebrate its own milestoneâthe 100th anniversary of BUâs first journalism and advertising courses. Hearing her former teacher, Richard Lehr, a COM professor of journalism, speak about his decades of reporting on Beantown mobster Whitey Bulger reminded Melanie Rieders (COMâ14) âwhy I chose journalism. It reinvigorated me.â Lehr shared photos from his visit to the set of Black Mass, the upcoming film starring Johnny Depp, based on his book Black Mass: Whitey Bulger, the FBI, and a Devilâs Deal.\n\nAnother speaker was HBOâs Jay Roewe (COMâ79), who talked about how filming the Emmy-winning HBO series Game of Thrones in Northern Ireland has brought jobs, tourism, and millions of dollars to a country still recovering from decades of political violence. Roewe said heâd never imagined âthat what we do could actually affect peopleâs lives that way.â\n\nCelebrating new School of Law building\n\nâThis is just a buildingâbricks, mortar, glass. Why are we all here for just a building?â Richard Cartier Godfrey (LAWâ79), a BU trustee and chair of the LAW Building on Excellence Campaign, asked the crowd at the dedication ceremony for the School of Lawâs new Sumner M. Redstone Building. His answer: âBecause itâs not just a building. It is where we will teach future generations what it means to do right for society.â\n\nDuring the ceremony in the new buildingâs Butler Atrium, Maureen A. OâRourke, dean of LAW, acknowledged those who helped make a reality the building she declared âa showpiece,â and introduced a video in which Redstone (Hon.â94), head of CBS and Viacom and a former LAW faculty member, reflected on the significance of the building that bears his name. Daniel Koh, Boston Mayor Marty Walshâs chief of staff, proclaimed September 19 Sumner Redstone Day, and speakers celebrated the fact that LAW is now housed in a building worthy of its reputation.\n\nLaw, as taught at BU, âgives us the ability to make our society, with all of its conflicting interests, work,â said the Honorable Sandra L. Lynch (LAWâ71), chief judge, United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. And BU President Robert A. Brown reminded alumni that their school stands at the âcenterâthe heartâof the University.â\n\nFrozen fever\n\nEveryone said the classic Disney fairy tale musical was passÃ©, but producer Peter Del Vecho (CFAâ80) refused to believe it. The father of twin girls, he had grown up with Disney classics and believes âthereâs something about a film being made in our formative yearsâ that makes it particularly special. The challenge in creating his film Frozen was âto make something timeless, but also timely,â and judging by the filmâs wild success, he has succeeded. Del Vecho, a 2014 CFA Distinguished Alumni Award recipient, took home this yearâs Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film.\n\nIn addition to its accolades, Frozen has amassed millions of fans, some of whom attended Del Vechoâs talk at the Photonics Center Auditorium. When he showed a clip of the song âFor the First Time in Forever,â four little girls began singing along. Their fathers, Rich Snyder (GSMâ03) and Ariel Soiffer (LAWâ10), met through their daughtersâthe families live down the street from each other in Brookline, and they walked to campus together for the talk.\n\nBU women on self-worth\n\nAt the Presidentâs Panel: A Conversation with BU Women, four alums shared personal stories and advice on finding career opportunities, breaking down gender barriers, balancing work and family, and recognizing self-worth.\n\nLawyer Cynthia Cordes (COMâ01), a 2014 COM Distinguished Alumni Award recipient, said that while prosecuting child exploitation offenses, she found it difficult to mentally leave work at the office like her male colleagues did. âI worried about the children on the nights and weekends,â she said. This quality, which had initially seemed like a weakness, she said, turned out to be a strength in her later work with human trafficking victims, who responded to Cordesâ compassionate demeanor.\n\nA tip from Jeannette Horan (GSMâ93), IBM vice president and CIO, about the importance of not neglecting your own needs when juggling work and family resonated with attendee Joy Babcock (SMGâ64), who said that as women, âwe undervalue ourselves.â Her friend Linda Pierre (SEDâ64) added, âYou need to look at somebody who has gone before,â like these role models, to help show you what path to take.\n\nCelebrating the power of yes\n\nâWe live and thrive as a great institution through what our alumni do,â said BU President Robert A. Brown, welcoming more than 300 alums to the Best of BU Luncheon. This year, University Alumni AwardsâBUâs highest honorâwere presented to three alums: Howard Bauchner (MEDâ79), the editor in chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Jeanette Horan (GSMâ93), vice president and CIO of IBM, and Rick Hoyt, Jr. (SEDâ93). Matthew Trevithick (CGSâ06, CASâ08), who started a rowing club in Kabul, and Mikhail Gurevich (ENGâ07, GSMâ12), managing partner of the New Yorkâbased hedge fund Dominion Capital, received BU Young Alumni Awards.\n\nHoran recalled the School of Managementâs Executive MBA program as â18 months of hell I would do over again tomorrow.â At the time, she was also working and caring for two young daughters, a challenge she embraced because when her girls saw her doing homework, they knew they had to do theirs, too. Today, she said proudly, both daughters have PhDs.\n\nHoyt also spoke with pride of his family. When he was born with paraplegia and cerebral palsy, doctors told his parents he had no hope for a ânormalâ life. Hoyt proved them wrong. In 1977, he asked his father to push him in a five-mile benefit run. The duo has since participated in more than 1,100 marathons and triathlons and founded the Hoyt Foundation, which supports inclusion for people with disabilities.\n\nHoyt prerecorded his Alumni Award acceptance speech, selecting one letter at a time on a computer he manipulates by tapping his head against a sensor on his wheelchair. He said he considers his SED degree ânot only an accomplishment for myself, but for my family,â and added that he was onstage because his father said yes. The crowd gave Hoyt a standing ovation."
