        "text": "There are several good reasons for there not to be a Prima Trio. But they're all trumped by one overarching thing, according to violinist and violist Gulia Gurevich.\n\n\"The beauty of our group, what really helped us stay together and have the special relationship we have, is that we're also great friends,\" Gurevich said during a recent phone conversation from her Los Angeles-area home, as the Prima Trio began preparations to gather in Bremerton for an April 9 concert at the Admiral Theatre. \"The trio is our priority. We've been together so long, we're basically family members by now.\"\n\nNot that there aren't forces at work trying to separate the three, who met as students at Ohio's Oberlin Conservatory of Music. Gurevich's fairly recent move to the West Coast, with her husband and two children, has made the trio a nationwide concern: Pianist Anastasia Dedik lives and teaches in New York, and until recently clarinetist Boris Allakhverdyan was based in Kansas City.\n\n\"We're officially based in New York,\" Gurevich said. \"I fly there for rehearsals, and to get ready for our performances.\"\n\nAllakhverdyan's recent appointment as principal clarinetist for the Los Angeles Philharmonic has the potential to change the venue for those rehearsals, though, and make Dedik the commuter.\n\nThere's more to getting the trio together than just location, though. All three are in-demand solo and orchestral performers and educators. Gurevich and Dedik both have families, as well, and Gurevich is studying conducting with a professor at the University of Southern California.\n\nSince 2004, though, when the threesome came together at Oberlin — initially because of their shared Russian language — the Prima Trio have been a going concern.\n\n\"We decided while we were at Oberlin,\" Gurevich said, \"'We're friends. Why don't we start playing together?'\"\n\nThe first piece they played together was a trio by Aram Khatchaturian that was suggested by Allakhverdyan.\n\n\"The piece really spoke to us,\" Gurevich said. \"We decided to start working on it, and soon we were preparing it and two other pieces for competition. That trio remains in Prima's repertoire to this day, and she listed it as one of six pieces that will be on the program for the concert at the Admiral.\n\nThe combination paid serious dividends. They won the Grand Prize in their first major international exposure, the 2007 Fischoff Chamber Music Competition. That set them on a course that saw them performing on some of the world's most prestigious stages.\n\n\"I think that's when we knew we were doing the right thing,\" Gurevich said, breaking into a laugh as she added, \"We enter our first big competition and we win. That's a pretty good sign.\"\n\nThey've also added recording to their get-together activities. Their first CD, \"Prima,\" was released in 2012, and Gurevich said they currently are at work on a second. The Khatchaturian is among the selections on the \"Prima\" CD, along with several others she said were likely to be included in the Admiral program — an American piece, \"Serenade for Three\" by Richard Schickele, that is a perennial concert favorite for the trio; and two pieces by Astor Piazzolla, \"Oblivion\" and \"Otono Porteno.\" (The other pieces she said would probably be played at the Admiral are another concert staple, Glick's \"The Klezmer's Wedding,\" and Robert Schumann's \"Marchenerzalungen (Fairy Tales),\" for which Gurevich trades in her violin for a viola.)\n\n\"We're hoping to get 'The Klezmer's Wedding' on the second CD,\" she said. \"We've had so many requests from people who wanted us to record it.\"\n\nDespite their heady triumphs in classical music circles, Gurevich said the trio enjoy taking their music to less formal venues like the subscription-series, apres-dinner concert they'll play at the Admiral.\n\n\"We feel that all music can speak and appeal to all people,\" she said, adding that the pieces they'll play at the Admiral all are tried-and-true concert favorites. \"We hope that at the end they can leave with a beautiful feeling of being introduced to our art.\"\n\nPREVIEW\n\nPRIMA TRIO\n\nWhere: Admiral Theatre, 515 Pacific Ave., Bremerton\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. April 9; dinner with reservation served at 5:30 p.m.\n\nTickets: $84-$15"
