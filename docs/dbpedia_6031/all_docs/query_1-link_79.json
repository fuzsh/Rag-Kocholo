He made a significant contribution to the effective development of the various optical-holographic systems. Sergey Odinokov had an intuition for promising directions in holographic technologies. His research style included a deep dive into the topic, a focus on practical issues, and a desire to bring fundamental results to their applications. He was constantly looking for novel holographic solutions and wanted to explore all of it.\n\nSergey Odinokov at the age of 72. suddenly passed away on 8 September 2021. He became a Candidate of Engineering Sciences in 1979 (in Russia equals to Ph.D. degree), in 2011—a Doctor of Engineering Science in BMSTU. Sergey Odinokov was a Professor and Leading Lecturer of the Department of Laser and Optoelectronic Systems. He also was a head of Holography Lab for the last 19 years in BMSTU. In this article, we remember Sergey Odinokov as a scientist and teacher, colleague and friend, and we hope that we can convey in these passages his sincere love for holography and tell his story.\n\nIn Memory of Sergey Odinokov\n\nOlga I. Odinokova\n\nCJSC Scientific and Production Company “InfoTech”, Moscow, Russia\n\nSergey Borisovich was born in Moscow on 25 May 1950. His father Boris Dmitrievich Odinokov worked in the USSR State Committee for National Security, mother Galina Nikonorovna Vodyanyuk worked in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. From about 4 to 6 years old, Sergey with his parents lived in Germany, not far from Berlin, but he got into school already in Moscow.\n\nAccording to his sisters and relatives, he was not excellent at the elementary school, grades were bad. However, he was fond of reading, especially in history although he could not stand literature. From 6–8 grade he has a passion for physics. Previously, many people collected transistor radio in a soap dish, which he also did. He tried to figure everything out to the finish, he was studying something all the time. The physics classes were often accompanied with some experiments. “You know it all”—the physics teacher said to Sergey. In the 60s, all the boys were fond of rocket science. The academic teachers came to school and explained the engineering professions you can acquire after graduating from the university. So, Sergey became interested in higher education in the field of optics. As a result, he decided to enter Bauman University although his dad discouraged him with “Very difficult university” statements and recommended to go into economics. However, stubborn Sergey did not even want to listen and when he entered dad said: “Now I see that you will be an academician”.\n\nUnfortunately, Sergey lost his parents early, and not only his parents, in 1968 his half-sister died. She was 24 years old, studied at Moscow State University, he was 18. Then in 1972 his mother suddenly passed away, he was 22 years old, he was left alone. Dad then lived separately, there was a divorce, he also died suddenly in 1966. Therefore, as they say, he was definitely a self-made man. Studied, lived, worked. By the time his mother died in 1972, we had already dated for 2 years, it was hard for him alone, and in November we got married (Figure 1).\n\nScience and work were his “everything and always”. It was his life, he swam there being interested in everything. Even when he changed his job and left for Kometa Central Research Institute after graduate school. I guess it was simply a financial choice. Next, (under Gorbachev) they closed all the topics that Sergey dealt with. He returned to his alma mater. He did not really enjoy being engaged in educational activities, although as far as I know, he was good at it, he knew how to convey everything to the audience.\n\nTalking about his other interests, he bought a rubber boat from my friends, and he always went to ride it to Krasnogorsk. When our daughter Elena was born, he became interested in photography, did photographic processing by himself in the bathroom.\n\nSergey Odinokov took information anywhere, not only from books but from articles, from newspapers, from people’s stories, he collected everything in his memory. He was always fond of history (Ancient Rome, Russia, Europe, and more). He always loved being around people and always tried to organize something, he loved company. He used to come up with an idea and next enjoyed sharing it and making it happen.\n\nThe Loss of Close Friends Is a Tragedy\n\nVasily Y. Kolyuchkin\n\nDoctor of Technical Sciences, Professor of the Department RL2, BMSTU, Moscow, Russia\n\nI met Seryozha almost 50 years ago, since he was assigned to work at the Moscow Higher Technical School (today BMSTU) being one of the best students of the Department of Optoelectronic Devices in 1973. In those distant times, we were brought together not only by common scientific interests but also by personal hobbies. Everyone who knew Sergey is aware very well of how wonderful he sang guitar songs. In addition, we often gathered at his house and sang songs heartily. In addition, his wife Olenka also indulged in this hobby with pleasure. Years passed, Sergey and I were racing to defend candidate and doctoral dissertations.\n\nFurthermore, in the intervals between these stages of our lives, we traveled with the students of our university to the far North or to Syria, where we gave lectures to local students. We had a friendship as families and very often celebrated holidays together. Not only my wife and I, but our children recall these times with pleasure. Yes, we, his friends, can only remember. Sergey, a wonderful friend, and a true scientist, we will remember for the rest of our lives! (Figure 2).\n\nLove for Holography\n\nArtem B. Solomashenko and Maria V. Shishova\n\nHolography and Waveguide Optics Laboratory, BMSTU, Moscow, Russia\n\nThis section covers the working path of Sergey Odinokov, starting from the very beginning. His childhood was not much different from his peers in those years, but there is one story from those times he used to tell his employees. On 12 April 1961, on the day of the first flight of Yuri Gagarin to space, Sergey, together with schoolmates, went for a solemn demonstration similar to many other people. A Soviet newspaper Pionerskaya Pravda has documented this history for the whole world event with the picture of young Sergey (Figure 3). Perhaps it was just a coincidence, but maybe it was the starting point for Sergey associated with science and technology on the path associated with the Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School, the school that brought up the founder of Soviet rocket and space technology Sergey Korolev and many other great scientists. Sergey Odinokov subsequently devoted his whole professional life to this University.\n\nIn 1967, Sergey Odinokov entered the Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School at the Faculty of Instrumentation, Department of Optical Device (P2 in the following text, now it is called RL2 department). Such as the entire second half of the 20th century, these years are remarkable for the emergence of new directions in science and technology, among which was holography. The method of recording the wavefront was proposed in 1949 by Denis Gabor, but due to the absence of coherent radiation sources at that time, this method had not found wide application. The turning point came in 1962–1963 when Yuri Denisyuk published an article “On the displaying of the object optical properties in the wave field of radiation scattered by it”, which for the first time demonstrated the hologram recording in three-dimensional media. Interest in holography was immediately shown in many scientific institutes. The corresponding research was carried out under the leadership of L. P. Lazarev, who was the head of the P2 Department. Starting in the early 60s, the research and development of laser systems in Bauman University intended to create one of the first helium-neon lasers in the USSR. In the late 60s–early 70s, the first research on holography in the department begins, in which Sergey Odinokov took part.\n\nHolography is an amazing phenomenon that in the first years demonstrated the possibility to reconstruct three-dimensional images of various objects, realizing the idea of reproducing the complete illusion of natural objects. That was new and promising direction captivated the mind of the student Sergey Odinokov in a way that he will conduct his whole scientific career in this field. As a result, in 1973 Segrey Odinokov with the work “Installation for recording and reproducing relief-phase Fourier holograms” and receives the qualification of an engineer specializing in optical-electronic devices. After defending his diploma, Sergey Borisovich remains in his “alma mater” working for the next 3 years as an engineer, and then as a senior engineer of the P2 department (Figure 4 and Figure 5).\n\nIn 1976–1979 he takes the full-time postgraduate study of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University (BMSTU), at the same time being a junior researcher. At that time, to become a postgraduate student you should (1) show the ability to do teaching and scientific work, (2) have at least 2 years of work experience after graduating from university in the chosen specialty, and (3) pass the entrance exams. Sergey Odinokov showed himself as an intellectual, who can master the materials with a broad outlook, as well as with a high interest in scientific and technical creativity. He had a desire to do independent research, therefore, entering a postgraduate school was a matter of time. In 1980, under the guidance of Prof. O. V. Rozhkov, he graduated with his Ph.D. thesis on “Development of a method and an optoelectronic device for recording the wavefronts of moving objects”.\n\nIn 1982–1990 Sergey Odinokov works in the state-owned companies but remains within the framework of holography: he participates in the development of coherent optoelectronic correlators with holographic filters for object image recognition, being the sector chief in Spectrum Central Design Bureau, then the sector chief of the Kometa Central Research Institute. Nevertheless, Sergey Odinokov had been feeling related to the scientific research in the field of holography. In 1990 he returns to Bauman University, where he will work until 2021 as an associate professor, and then as professor of the department “Laser and optoelectronic systems” and deputy director for scientific work of the Research Institute of Radioelectronics and Laser Technology of BMSTU.\n\nIn 1995–2002 Sergey Odinokov participated in the creation of the first production line in Russia for recording and mass replication of security holograms designed to protect documents and goods from counterfeiting and falsification, at the enterprises of JSC RPC Krypten, and JSC Concern Russian Security Technologies. In 2002, with the assistance of Prof. V. I. Kozintsev, the head of the RL2 department, Sergey Odinokov creates a laboratory “Optical-holographic systems”. From this moment, the practical holography begins within the walls of BMSTU. It all started from scratch: one laser, one room, and the gifted students (Dmitry Lushnikov and Ivan Tsyganov), as Sergey Odinokov himself twenty years ago. At the same time, he is launching the HOLOEXPO conference with the support of Yuri Denisyuk (Figure 6). Their enthusiasm and efficiency, as well as the desire to develop the direction of holography, contributed to the fact that this laboratory would later become one of the leading holographic laboratories in Russia.\n\nAs the head of the laboratory, Sergey Odinokov was engaged in the research and development of optical-holographic devices. He was very active, a high-level professional who was interested in things himself and knew how to captivate with his ideas not only students but also mature specialists. He was aimed to develop these ideas in the current areas of holographic optics, therefore the lab headed by him was engaged in a wide range of activities, staying at the forefront of science.\n\nIn recent years, as the head of the laboratory, Sergey Odinokov was responsible for several projects. Being involved in administrative issues a lot, he used to say that he missed science. He loved to jump into scientific details in discussions to achieve mutual understanding and analyze the results. His dream was to organize full-fledged manufacturing of high-tech holographic products.\n\nSergey Odinokov was the head of R&D for the state budget contracts, the contracts for the Federal Target Program “Research and Development” and much more under the contracts of various companies. He never did the research for the sake of research, but keenly understood the needs of the economy, caught scientific trends in holography, and tried to work within these priority areas.\n\nHere are some of the scientific results of the research led by Sergey Odinokov over the past few years, which our laboratory has been engaged in:\n\n-\n\nresearch in the field of security holograms and the development of new types of security features used to protect documents from forgery and falsification: micro- and nano-optical hidden elements, plasmonic diffraction gratings, color 2D/3D images formed in photopolymer materials;\n\n-\n\ndevelopment of optoelectronic devices for identification and control of the authenticity of documents with security holograms [1];\n\n-\n\ndevelopment of optical-holographic systems of archival memory (including based on computer-generated holograms) [2];\n\n-\n\nthe creation of computer-generated holographic and diffraction optical elements for miniature optoelectronic devices and systems, micro-optics and devices, using plasma-chemical etching technology [3];\n\n-\n\ndevelopment of holographic aiming and target designation devices [4];\n\n-\n\ncalculation and manufacture of holographic waveguides, and the development of advanced visualization and augmented reality systems on their basis [5,6];\n\n-\n\nthe creation of various types of holographic sensors: wavefront sensor [7,8,9], encoders of angular and linear displacements [10].\n\nAuthenticity Control Methods\n\nOne of the main directions of Sergey Odinokov’s research was the development of authenticity control methods of the security holograms, as well as the development of optoelectronic devices that implement these methods. Sergey Odinokov proposed new methods for the authenticity monitoring based on coherent Fourier optics, spatial filtering, spatial frequency analysis, and more: a method of authenticity control based on correlation analysis in a modified coherent optical correlator with joint Fourier transform of spatial frequency spectra functions of several input and reference hidden coded binary images; control method based on spatial-frequency analysis of the input hidden coded binary images, reconstructed from the input Fourier sub-hologram with help of coherent optical spectrum analyzer. Sergey Odinokov presented the theory of a modified coherent optical correlator, which made it possible to obtain mathematical expressions that establish the dependence of the nonlinearity parameters of relief-phase sub-holograms, different distortions of optical signals, and positioning errors of sub-holograms [11,12,13]. Figure 7 was taken during one of the conferences where Odinokov’s team presented their work on computer generated Fourier holograms.\n\nThese developments formed the basis for his doctoral dissertation “Methods and optoelectronic systems for automated control of the authenticity of security holograms”, which he defended in 2011. In addition to several prototypes that implement the approach described above, under the leadership of Sergey Odinokov, an optoelectronic system for controlling the authenticity of security holograms on passports of Russian citizens and various government documents was developed.\n\nHolographic Memory\n\nUntil the 2020s, one of Odinokov’s laboratory tasks was to increase the information capacity of optical archival storage devices of digital information using holographic methods. In particular, multiplex recording of several holograms in the same area of the carrier makes it possible to create holographic storage devices with a storage life of up to 50 years and insensitivity to the effects of electromagnetic fields. The research and development of such devices in Russia were carried out in laboratories under the leadership of A. L. Mikaelyan, V. I. Bobrinev. (Research Institute of Radiooptics, Moscow), G. G. Levin (FSUE “VNIIOFI”, Moscow), P. E. Tverdokhleb, I. S. Steinberg (Institute of Automation and Electrometry, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences), S. A. Shoydin (Siberian State University of Geosystems and Technologies, Novosibirsk), but Sergey Odinokov managed to bring a number of his ideas into this direction, which could subsequently open up new prospects. In Odinokov’s holography lab with the participation of postgraduate student Sergey Donchenko and Evgeniy Zlokazov (MEPhI, Moscow) a method for recording one-dimensional Fourier microholograms in a projection incoherent optical system with angular multiplexing was proposed for the first time [14]. This made it possible to abandon the classical two-beam interference scheme and increase the vibration tolerance during exposure by several times.\n\nHolographic Sights\n\nIn the early 2000s, the direction of holographic sights was developing, since their use in small arms provided several advantages: reduced aiming time, the ability to aim with two eyes, high brightness of the aiming mark, decrease in weight, and dimensions, and minimization of parallax. S. N. Koreshev, M. K. Shevtsov, A. E. Angervaks, S. A. Shoydin contributed to the development and research of holographic sights in Russia.\n\nIn his works on this topic, Sergey Borisovich together with graduate student Michael Kovalev tried to solve a few scientific problems. One of them was the wavelength change of the radiation source with a change in the ambient temperature—as a result, there is an angular displacement of the sighting mark reconstructed from the hologram. Sergey Borisovich was able to successfully solve the thermal compensation problem, proposing a number of his own, different from analogs, sights construction schemes, which were later implemented and tested in devices.\n\nAt the same time, it was he who came up with the idea of using computer-generated holograms in such systems using a point light-emitting diode as a radiation source, which was later taken as a development basis by other holographists [15]. Later, a computer-generated hologram will be combined with a holographic waveguide, providing the most compact and original sight scheme. In total, Sergey Odinokov has 8 patents in this area [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24].\n\nSecurity Holograms\n\nOne of the most interesting projects of Sergey Odinokov in the field of security holograms was the one together with Dmitrii Lushnikov on three-dimensional color holographic stereograms, implemented jointly with JSC RPC Krypten. Within this work, a one-stage scheme for obtaining color holographic stereograms was developed according to the modified Denisyuk scheme, which makes it is possible to obtain one-parallax and full-parallax color holographic stereograms [25]. Such three-dimensional optical security elements are obtained by digital holography and computer synthesis of color volumetric images. Holographic stereograms in this case are spatially imposed digital holograms sequentially recorded to reconstruct different angles of the object, displayed on the spatial light modulator. It is possible to form one multi-color volumetric image of objects or several color volumetric images with horizontal and vertical switching (flip-flop effect) both in color and in the image itself.\n\nIn the early 2010s, various scientific groups began to explore the possibility of using plasmonic spectral filters as document security features, therefore, S. B. Odinokov’s laboratory, together with JSC RPC Krypten, took up developments in this area. The effects obtained with broadband plasmonic filters are different from the effects reproduced by standard rainbow holograms and appear in reflection or transmission in white light [26]. In these studies, periodic metal-dielectric nanostructures were used for surface plasmon excitation, which made it possible to form extraordinary peaks in the transmission or reflection spectrum. The design is provided by different nanostructuring in the image. Plasmonic elements required precision lithographic equipment, which significantly influenced the cost of plasmonic security features. One of the unique ideas of Sergey Odinokov for solving this problem was the modernization of the Dot-matrix technology for recording high-resolution structures of 1900–3800 lines/mm.\n\nLinear Displacement Sensors\n\nWithin the Federal Target Program “Research and Development in Priority Areas of Development of the Scientific and Technological Complex of Russia for 2014–2020” Sergey Odinokov led the project to create a holographic linear encoder, developing the direction of F. M. Gerasimov, B. G. Turukhano and other Russian metrologists-holographists. Linear encoders are indispensable in ultra-precision machine tools, measuring machines, lithographs, microscopes, and other high-precision devices. Such sensors are based on a pair of diffraction gratings and form a homodyne interferometer. The generation of a quadrature optical signal depends on the coordinate of the linear displacement of the measuring head relative to the measuring scale. Within this project, an experimental sample of a linear displacement sensor was implemented due to a comprehensive analysis of radiation conversion in the optical system. Phase difference stability depends on the microrelief parameters of relief-phase diffraction gratings. Sergey Odinokov has 2 patents in this area [27,28].\n\nAugmented Reality Displays\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to the work of Sergey Odinokov related to the development of holographic waveguides for augmented reality devices. The increasing computing power of mobile devices and ubiquitous digitalization in recent years have elevated augmented reality technologies to a fundamentally new level of development, which allowed them to cover a wide range of human activities, from education to industry. In this regard, various augmented reality devices began to develop, in particular, glasses and monoculars, in which information display technologies can be holographic as well. This technology is called holographic waveguides. Their advantage is that the radiation, that displays the augmented information propagates inside a thin glass substrate (no more than 2.5 mm thick), which reduces the dimensions and weight of the device, but at the same time provides an increased angular field and exit pupil comparing with systems based on prisms and reflective combiners.\n\nSergey Odinokov, having once seen such devices at one conference, immediately understood their potential and fired up with this idea. For several years, there has been a lot of work completed under his leadership: laser stands for obtaining such waveguides by analog holography means, different waveguide structures, providing the increased field of view and the exit pupil, the originality of which is confirmed by two patents [29,30]. We have developed the prototypes of augmented reality devices which allow the formation of various static and dynamic images, including auxiliary text, sign-symbolic, and other information, the image of which is superimposed on the image of the surrounding space. Thus, the technology for holographic waveguides of augmented reality devices was mastered in BMSTU thanks to Sergey Odinokov (Figure 8).\n\nAt that time, in the field of holographic augmented reality devices, Odinokov’s team has been among the pioneers, one of two in Russia engaged in this direction. The other team has been headed by A.N. Putilin from the Lebedev Physical Institute. Sergey Odinokov’s innovative ideas were manifested here as well—in addition to waveguides based on classical photosensitive materials, under his leadership and with his direct participation, an augmented reality waveguide based on photo-thermo-refractive glass was created for the first time in cooperation with ITMO University and prof. N.V. Nikonorov.\n\nDealing with each of these topics, Sergey Odinokov tried to immerse himself in the essence of the problem as much as possible, not missing even the smallest details. As the head of the laboratory, he did not lose sight of even small projects, because he loved to do scientific work, he loved the process of scientific creativity, during which, through a series of experiments, experiments, discussions, the result that he so valued is obtained. “There should be a result in the work,” Sergey Odinokov often said to his employees, tk. since the student days, the value and importance of applied research were laid in it. So, various topical areas of research that were carried out in the laboratory personally by Sergey Odinokov or under his leadership, once again confirm the versatility of his scientific interests, active scientific activity, the fruitfulness and novelty of which is confirmed by a huge number of articles and patents.\n\nCareer Merits\n\nSergey Odinokov was the author of over 200 scientific papers, the owner of 41 patents for inventions and 7 copyright certificates. Since 2006 he is a member of the Optical Society named after D. S. Rozhdestvensky, since 2011—A member of SPIE and a member of the presidium of the scientific and Russian technical organization “Laser Association”. Member of the editorial boards of the scientific journals “World of cinema technology” (published in Russia) and “Photonics”, a member of the expert groups of the peer-reviewed scientific journals ”Computer Optics” and ”Quantum Electronics”.\n\nThe research results and the merits of Sergey Odinokov were appreciated by the scientific and technical community of Russia. In 2005 he had become the award winner of the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations in the field of scientific and technical developments. Sergey Odinokov was awarded the honorary badge of the BMSTU “For services to the University”. Russian Optical Society on behalf of Russian holographists awarded him with a medal named after academician Yuri Denisyuk in 2015 for outstanding achievements in the field of physical optics and holography. In 2017 Sergey Odinokov was awarded a medal by academician D. S. Rozhdestvensky for outstanding achievements in the field of fundamental research in optics, the implementation of their results in the practice of creating and researching new optical materials. Two years later in 2019, he got a medal from academician S. I. Vavilov for outstanding achievements in the field of fundamental research in optics, the implementation of their results into practice, the development of optical instrumentation.\n\nSergey Odinokov devoted a lot of time and effort to educational activities, realizing the importance of education and training of qualified scientific personnel. Under his direct supervision at BMSTU, a scientific holography school arose, which educated dozens of specialists in the field of holography and 4 candidates of sciences, who successfully work in many domestic and foreign research and production organizations. During his pedagogical work at the Department of Laser and Optoelectronic Systems, he prepared 5 lectures courses, namely: “Laser systems for optical information processing”, “Applied holography”, “Systems of technical vision”, “Optoelectronic security systems”, “Methods and technologies of computer optics”. The course “Applied Holography” by the efforts of Sergey Odinokov was included in the program of compulsory education for students in the areas of training 12.04.02 “Optotechnics” and 12.04.05 “Laser equipment and laser technologies”. In 2012 he won the competition “The best teacher of BMSTU”. Students respected Sergey Odinokov, many sought to engage in scientific work under his leadership, and he, in turn, loved teaching (Figure 9).\n\nAs Peter Kapitsa said: “Science should be fun, exciting and simple. So, must be scientists”. Sergey Odinokov was one of a kind. The authors of the article would prefer to remember him that way.\n\nOn Teaching Life in Science\n\nMaria V. Shishova\n\nJunior Researcher, Bauman Moscow State Technical University\n\nSergey Borisovich and I have known each other for about six years, and have worked quite a lot together for the last four years. The first serious work in my life was and remains in the Holography Lab of Sergey Borisovich, he led me by the hand into science and holography.\n\nI want to share the first little story about Sergey Borisovich. On one Wednesday, he canceled a lecture on applied holography, as he had an event—the premiere of the documentary “The History of Holographic Cinema in Russia”. Sergey Borisovich said that we can come, so we came. This was something completely new for me. On that day, he stopped being just a professor and became an expert holographist. After another couple of years, he began to slowly become my mentor and friend. Probably, he was one of those people about whom one can say “If you met him once you made a friend for life”. A couple of months after that movie about holographic cinema, I started working in his laboratory. Then Sergey Borisovich made happen for our team many more various and serious events, exhibitions and conferences, large and small publications, and just adventures accompanying scientific tourism.\n\nSergey Borisovich could react in different ways to what happened at work, but he was always open to hearing you and understanding. He invested energy and time for you to understand him too. Throughout life, you may not remember the details of some situations, even their context, and result, but you will remember how the person who was next to you made you feel. In addition, I want to tell you how supportive Sergey Borisovich was and how he made me feel confident in science. I well remember how he told me: “Mashka! I don’t want to hear you can’t do something”. Furthermore, he spoke kindly the way you thought: “But really, why can’t I? I think I can”. Then you start trying, and then you start acquiring results. In communicating with students, he knew when to be stricter, when to show that the situation is not as terrible as it seems, and when to just support. Sergey Borisovich, even if he was in a hurry, always stopped when the freshmen simply called out to him, looking for a specific room in the tangled corridors of BMSTU. He had not just been answering their question but had wished them luck.\n\nIt seems to me that Sergey Borisovich had a creative and committed approach to science and justifiably expected the same from his colleagues. He used to teach us to take responsibility in order to achieve results in science and even in life by telling stories that we will sorely miss.\n\nThe Birth and Development of Holographic Data Storage Architecture Based on Computer Generated Holograms Projection Record Scheme\n\nEvgenii Yu. Zlokazov 1, Rostislav S. Starikov 1 and Nikolay N. Evtikhiev 1,2\n\n1\n\nNational Research Nuclear University MEPhI, Moscow and Russia\n\n2\n\nIPG Photonics, Moscow, Russia\n\nAt the end of 80′s and the beginning of the 90′s Dr. S.B. Odinokov with the collaboration of NII Radoioptiki (The Scientific Research Institute of Radio-optics) was involved in pioneering works in the field of hybrid analog-digital optical processing of radio signals that was based on acoustooptic devices. Under his supervision one of the first Russian optical vector-matrix multiplier was developed and tested, the principal precision and throughput limitations of systems based on this device were analyzed [31]. One of the major achievements of Dr. S.B. Odinokov in the field of opto-digital systems was the development of an archival holographic data storage system (HDS) based on computer generated Fourier holograms (CGFH).\n\nHDS systems have been researched and developed in Bauman Moscow State Technical University by Dr. S.B. Odinokov’s group since 2009. The first prototype of the system used a classical holographic approach, based on Leith-Upatnieks off-axis configuration. Multiplexing of holograms was performed using the angular multiplexing technique [32]. This approach was also implemented in numerous examples of HDS systems worldwide and showed the ability to achieve up to 2 TBytes per disk of storage capacity. The main problem of off-axis schemes is the high sensitivity to vibrations and bulky sizes, which is common for most interference-based setups. It is worth noting that the second principal type of system architecture presented in the field of HDS development is based on collinear holography. This approach allowed to simplify the record scheme, but it was still based on interferometric principle, required precise implementation of additive phase masks, and showed significantly reduced capacity. So, the question: “How to reduce the record scheme complexity?” was circulating among all the HDS developers worldwide as well as in Sergey Borisovich’s mind these days.\n\nThe idea to use computer-generated holograms in HDS optical record scheme was born in 2011, when two dissertations were prepared in National Research Nuclear University “MEPhI”: candidate thesis of E. Yu. Zlokazov and doctoral thesis of R.S. Starikov. Sergey Borisovich was the official opposer of the mentioned candidate thesis, where CGFHs printed polygraphically on film were used for complex filters realization in 4f scheme for pattern recognition purposes. He took a close look to the content of dissertation, which was defended on 27 April 2011. The fist bird came up during the dialogue in R.S. Starikov’s car at the outer side of Sadovoe ring in Moscow few weeks later. This conversation started at the end of Zemlyanoy Val and lasted along the whole Sadovaya Spasskaya:\n\nS.B.: That’s what I want to talk. Rostislav Sergeevich, now we’re realizing the project, developing the system of page-wise holographic memory for long-term data storage with the use of silver halide emulsion plates for record, which have a good resolution. We use the straight interferometric record of Fourier holograms that, as you know, complicates the system, limits the quality of reconstructed data pages and so on. At the same time, I saw the works of your group on holographic filters synthesis for optical correlators, which are Fourier holograms also. Does this possible to simply calculate a Fourier hologram of binary data page?\n\nR.S.: Of course! And with pretty high resolution. 10,000 × 10,000 pixels if you want it is only the matter of calculation time. We proved this very well. You obtain a grayscale distribution… The only possible problem here is the reconstruction quality, it depends on SLM etc. Does it a binary signal?\n\nS.B.: Zeroes and ones grouped in blocks in a specific order… No, we’re talking about lower resolution. That’s what I was thinking about: how do you mean, what if we try to calculate a data page hologram, display it on an SLM screen and record it onto an emulsion with the simple projection? We are able to record the projection with very good quality and with up to 20× reduction.\n\nR.S.: I see. It could be possible; I must think about that… Anyway, it must be reduced depending on emulsion resolution. If it is binary, no matter which container is used, the bandwidth can be doubled to increase the quality of the restored…\n\nS.B.: Maybe it worth the interest.Resolution for the available modulator… (Pointing on the road) Drive around this traffic congestion here keep on the right, I’m sure, I always drive here in this time… (Back to HDS systems) So, the projection record can be performed with an incoherent light source, it is cheaper…\n\nR.S: … Yes. Surely interesting… Plus random phase masks to increase the quality.\n\nS.B.: Will you try? Who can do this?\n\nR.S: Evgenii Yuryevich will synthesize with no problem. There are some methods to increase signal-to-noise ratio, so it worth to try.\n\nS.B.: Will you try? Data page 200 × 200 pixels.\n\nR.S.: Yes, exactly, let’s make it! Agreed! Gonna be great!\n\nS.B.: Agreed! So! Starting immediately!\n\nThe next step of the new HDS scheme implementation was made in the day of R. S. Starikov thesis defense on 22 June 2011, where BMSTU was presented as an external reviewer with Sergey Borisovich as a representative. After the board meeting, Sergey Borisovich called E.Yu. Zlokazov for a talk, which happened on the back of MEPhI parking zone at the shadow of the poplars. After short explanations of classical HDS two-beam systems he asked:\n\nS.B.: Evgenii, you used computer-generated Fourier holograms for complex filters realization in 4-f correlator with SLM. Can you synthesize a hologram of data page in the same way?\n\nE.Yu.: Sure, I can. Once it is presented as a matrix of complex values it can be encoded onto a holographic fringe pattern. The only limitation is the resolution of SLM, which must be at least two times larger than the resolution of the data page.\n\nS.B.: We have an SLM with a resolution of about 800 × 600 pixels in BMSTU. Can we restore the data page with 200 × 200 pixels?\n\nE.Yu.: Yes, I think you can.\n\nS.B.: I want to invite you to attend to our team for the new DHS system development project. I already considered this with Rostslav Sergeevich, and he agreed. Will you?\n\nE.Yu.: Yes, of course. With big pleasure, Sergey Borisovich!…\n\nThe work began three months after this short backyard interviewing. Sergey Borisovich gathered a team of specialists in the field of optics, holography and optoelectronic systems development within this project, which includes Aleksander Yuryevich Betin, Vladimir Ivanovich Bobrinev, Nina Mikhailovna Verenikina, Sergey Sergeevich Donchenko and others. Such a novel methods as pseudo-random adaptive phase masks addition [33,34], multiplexing of one-dimensional Fourier holograms [35], full-page readout, and line-by-line readout of 1D-CGFH were proposed and developed [36]. The new methods were copyrighted by three patents of the Russian Federation [37,38]. The experimental prototype of the system was built and contained an incoherent projection recorder and an anamorphic optics-based coherent reader [39,40]. The research results were presented at numerous conferences in Russia such as HOLOEXPO and Photonics and Information Optics, and international meetings such as Digital Holography and 3D Imaging 2015 in Shanghai, International Symposium on Optical Memory 2016 in Kyoto, where it was invited as plenary speech, Holography: Advances and Modern Trends 2017 in Prague and many others. In addition, the results of CGFH-based HDS system development and research provided a basement for S. S. Donchenko candidate thesis under scientific supervision of Dr. S. B. Odinokov and included as a chapter in E. Yu. Zlokazov. doctoral (habil.) thesis. Computer generated holograms have found applications in different allied projects of Dr. S. B. Odinokov’s group such as holographic sighting display [41], holographic wavefront sensor [9], and holographic ID marks [42].\n\nThe architecture based on computer-generated Fourier holograms projection, proposed by Dr. S.B. Odinokov [14], can be rightfully considered as the third principal architecture of holographic data recorder in line with the off-axis and collinear interferometric schemes and the only non-interferometric.\n\nFocus on New Generation Holographic Materials\n\nNikolay V. Nikonorov\n\nDoctor of Sciences, Professor, ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\nSergey Borisovich assigned a special role to optical materials, in particular, materials for holography. I met Sergey Borisovich at the HOLOEXPO conference 7 years ago. At this meeting, Sergey Borisovich expressed a simple but profound idea that the development of new photosensitive (holographic) materials will in the future determine the development and progress not only in the field of holography, but also in optical instrument-making industry and laser technology. In other words, without new holographic materials, it is impossible to create devices and photonic devices of a new generation with a fundamentally new functionality. The work of ITMO University in the field of developing new photosensitive materials over the past 10–15 years was of great interest to Sergey Borisovich, and he proposed close cooperation between his holographic group from Bauman University and the materials science group from ITMO University. The holographic material that attracted Sergey Borisovich’s special attention was a silicate photo-thermo-refractive (PTR) glass, which was developed in our group more than 10 years ago.\n\nHolograms recording in PTR glass is based on the process of photo-thermo-induced crystallization, in which, after UV irradiation and subsequent heat treatment, nanocrystals grow in the irradiated area of the glass, the refractive index of which differs from that of non-irradiated glass. Compared to well-known holographic materials (silver halide emulsions, dichromated gelatin, photopolymers, chalcogenide glasses, etc.), PTR glass has the following competitive advantages: high mechanical, thermal and optical strength, high chemical resistance, moisture resistance and abrasion resistance (these characteristics are close to well-known optical glass BK7), unlimited storage period of recorded information. These properties make it possible to create holographic optical elements with unique characteristics that are in high demand in the photonics market. For example, the following holographic optical elements have been created on the basis of PTR glass: ultra-narrow-band filters for lasers, holographic prisms for calibrating angle-measuring and angle-setting navigation devices, high-power laser beams combiners, chirped gratings for light pulse compression, marks for holographic collimating laser sights, etc.\n\nSergey Borisovich expanded the fields of application of PTR glass. He suggested using PTR glass for the displays and eyeglasses of augmented reality. An important feature was that he proposed a new ideology for creating such devices—a monolithic integration of holograms (Bragg gratings) and a waveguide on a single substrate, i.e., when both the Bragg gratings for input-output of an optical image and the waveguide itself, which communicates between them, are made on the same material—PTR glass. Prior to this approach, the technology of a hybrid integration of optical elements on a single substrate was being developed in the world, i.e., when the input-output Bragg gratings and the waveguide were made of different materials (the gratings were made on a photopolymer, and the waveguide on glass). The use of dissimilar materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion in hybrid integration led to distortion of the transmitted image. The use of PTR glass for augmented reality displays and eyeglasses offers huge advantages over photopolymers. These are, first of all, the high-performance characteristics of PTR glass, which are extremely attractive for civil and military applications. Thus, displays and eyeglasses based on PTR glass can be used in a wide temperature range (from −60 °C to +200 °C) in any weather. The devices are not afraid of moisture, dirt and the impact of mechanical objects (sand, dust), because after the formation of surface scratches and defects, the glass surface can always be repolished again without changing the functionality of the displays and eyeglasses.\n\nThe result of the interaction of two groups from Bauman University and ITMO University was an article on augmented reality eyeglasses based on PTR glass in the highly rated journal Optics Express, where the first author was the ideologist of this technology—Sergey Odinokov [5]. An important detail of this publication was that it was printed in record-breaking short time. So, the article was submitted in mid-April 2020 and already in mid-May 2020 it was already published. This indicated that the topic of augmented reality devices is extremely relevant and in demand. The result of this publication was the Diploma and the First Prize named after Yu. I. Ostrovsky for the best scientific work in the field of optical holography and interferometry [43].\n\nThus, focusing on new holographic materials allowed Sergey Borisovich not only to propose new ideas and approaches for creating new generation of holographic optical devices, but also to put them into practice in the form of augmented reality displays and eyeglasses.\n\nScience Is a Strange Business\n\nSergey A. Shoydin\n\nSiberian State University of Geosystems and Technologies, Novosibirsk, Russia\n\nScience is a strange business. The more you give, the richer you become. In this sense, Sergey Odinokov was a very rich man, because he gave a lot to us, his colleagues. In my memory, there was not a single case when he would ignore a new thought, a new solution, and would not try to contribute to them. He shared his best practices, equipment, and dreams. He wanted to solve not only scientific problems but also to organize real holographic production. It is not for nothing that our conference at the beginning of its journey even had a subtitle—science, and practice. In this way, he was similar to Yu. N. Denisyuk, who also treated with piety each specific case of using holographic technologies and holographic products in production and just in life. In 2015, Sergey Odinokov, having learned about our success in promoting holographic technologies, invited me to find a laser for color holography and start producing high-quality color holograms. He even found a room somewhere near Moscow. However, it was difficult to do this work from Novosibirsk. Yes, and I have not yet recovered from the burden associated with the hard work of preserving holographic equipment in the hard 90-s. At that time, I was more interested in the breakthrough topic of 3D augmented reality, and the first joint discussions on it began at the school of holography in Tomsk in 2015. At each meeting, we touched on this issue, but a heavy workload postponed practical steps. One of the tasks of augmented reality is the transmission of 3D holographic information with FullHD resolution via a conventional radio channel. It was solved later. Sergey Odinokov joined in with pleasure, offering his help in using equipment that we did not have in Novosibirsk. So, together with Sergey Odinokov, Ivan Tsyganov, and Ekaterina Drozdova, we managed to record the world’s first hologram transmitted via Wi-Fi with TV at a frame rate, about which our article included in this special issue.\n\nSergey Odinokov was truly a workaholic. He created a team of the laboratory, then a team of like-minded people at HOLOEXPO, involving more and more scientists, engineers, graduate students, and students in the circle of scientific contacts. He often repeated with a smile: “There should be more of us (like-minded people).”\n\nRemembering our meeting at the School of Holography in Tomsk, I want to share my memory of how enthusiastically he spoke on the sidelines of his visit to the great Christian shrine—a font in the Jordan River, during a trip to Israel. I remember with what pleasure he organized a visit to New Jerusalem after the HOLOEXPO 2017 conference in Zvenigorod. He was not a deeply religious person but believed in goodness and human morality and therefore easily got along with people who were close in spirit.\n\n“In a narrow circle, we often joked that Sergey Odinokov was “well, not at all Odinokov…”. A small note: In Russian, the surname Odinokov sounds similar to “Lonely”.\n\nIn Memory of Sergey Borisovich Odinokov\n\nLeonid V. Tanin\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Advisor of CJSC HOLOGRAPHY INDUSTRY, Academician of the International Academy of Engineering, Doctor of physical and mathematical Sciences, Laureate of the State Prize of the Republic of Belarus in science and technology, Honored Inventor of the Republic of Belarus\n\nSense of frustration and bitterness permeates consciousness: a talented organizer, a scholar with a high standing scientific reputation passed away. I have dedicated my whole life to holography, and when I look back in the 2000s I see Sergey Borisovich with his creative energy virtually burst into holography. It was a time when talented pioneers in science deceased, such as Yuri Isaevich Ostrovsky, Georgy Victorovich Skrotsky, Lev Davidovich Bahrah, Victor Grigorjevich Komar, Sharmazan Dmitrievich Kakichashvili and Yuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk. They initiated holography, organized and held All-Union conferences in different cities of the former USSR: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yerevan, Tbilisi, Novosibirsk, Kiev, and Minsk. We must pay tribute to the fact that it was Sergey Borisovich who promptly picked up this idea of conferencing in 2004 and proceeded with it since then. It deserves recognition. Being a talented scientist and organizer, for almost 20 years he has successfully combined two functions: the Chairman of both Program and Organizational Committees of the International Conference HOLOEXPO on Holography and Applied Optical Technologies.\n\nI want to dwell on his cooperation with Belorussian colleagues. The most vivid memories go back to 2011 when the 8th International Conference HOLOEXPO-2011 was held in Minsk. A lot of foreign scholars, top experts in holography from near and far abroad countries attended the conference. Since Minsk was determined as the venue for a conference, we participated in organizing and holding the event. When I say “we” I mean B.I. Stepanov Institute of Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, CJSC Holography Industry, Light Magic Ltd., Belarusian State University (Figure 10).\n\nAt that time Sergey Borisovich already had solid seven-year experience in conferencing and shared it willingly with us. He gave us valuable advice regarding not only the arrangement of scientific sessions and reports presentation but also the cultural program, which was organized in the museum complex of ancient crafts and technologies, Dudutki. As Chairman of the Organizational Committee, Sergey Borisovich made a welcoming speech, opened, and chaired the plenary session. A highlight of the conference was the International Exhibition of Artistic Holograms, as well as a round table dedicated to the memory of Academician Yuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk, the founder of holography.\n\nSumming up the results of the Conference, Sergey Borisovich and I agreed on the official addressing Professor Vasilyev, the rector of St. Petersburg State University ITMO with a request to preserve the living environment in the office of Academician Yuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk, as well as to assist in the installation of a memorial plaque on the house where the scientist worked.\n\nSergey Borisovich has always accepted invitations to celebrate our significant occasions with us. So, in March 2017 he visited my 70th anniversary in Minsk, and two months later he shared our joy of celebrating the double anniversary of our companies—Light Magic Ltd. (30 years) and CJSC HOLOGRAPHY INDUSTRY (20 years).\n\nI am happy to have met Sergey Borisovich on my way. Now he is gone, but I have not yet realized that. I have always found Sergey Borisovich to be a friendly, softhearted colleague, hospitable friend, and dedicated family man. Being a unique, multi-faceted person, he easily brought people together, united leading scholars from Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Belarus, and Ukraine within a common information space, where they could exchange their ideas and inventions and mutually enrich their scientific and practical experience. I would hope that the years of his work and commitment have not been in vain, and through joint efforts, we will carry on his tradition of annually holding the International Conference HOLOEXPO on Holography and Applied Optical Technologies.\n\nA Place for Holographists\n\nGennadiy A. Gavrilov and Nina M. Ganzherli\n\nIoffe Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia\n\nIn the USSR, holography as a research field was at its peak in the period from the 70s to the 90s. It was the time when the Coordinating Council of the USSR Academy of Sciences on Holography was actively working. The various sections of the Council were led by L.D. Bahrak (Chairman of the Council), Yu. N. Denisyuk (Deputy Chairman, Head of the Optical holography Section), N.I. Kirillov (section of materials for holography), and S.B. Gurevich, Head of the Holography Laboratory of the A.F. Ioffe Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences (Section of optical information processing).\n\nThe Council held All-Union conferences and schools that engaged world-renowned scientists, as well as seminars and annual plenary meetings of the Council and its sections, published thematic collections of works. All this had a positive impact on the development of holography in the country (Figure 11).\n\nThe beginning of the 21st century was marked by the restoration of the lost coordination links. Thanks to his energy and organizational talent, Sergey Borisovich Odinokov managed to create the HOLOEXPO platform to promote advances in holography and related areas, unite specialists from academic and commercial areas, attract young scientists to work in the field of scientific and applied holography. In recent years, HOLOEXPO has grown to an international conference becoming a respectful organization bringing together scientists from neighboring countries and Europe. The number of participants is constantly growing.\n\nIn the post-Soviet period, we met Sergey Borisovich for the first time when our small team from the A.F. Ioffe Institute of Physics and Technology, headed by Yuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk, came to Moscow for HOLOEXPO 2005. We remember how a tall, smiling, charming man hurried to greet us with a warm welcome. We immediately felt surrounded by his kind interest and care. Yuri Nikolaevich welcomed and supported the revival of meetings of holographists.\n\nNow, many years later, we can feel that we have found our common home—the HOLOEXPO conferences that started thanks to the initiative, enthusiasm, and activity of Sergey Borisovich. These conferences ended a prolonged period of missing communication between holography specialists. In the person of Sergey Borisovich, our colleagues from Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and other countries also felt the support and appreciation of their research.\n\nAfter the death of Academician Yuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk in 2006, three All–Russian seminars “Yuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk—the founder of Russian holography” were held at the A.F. Ioffe Institute in 2006, 2012, 2017 as a tribute to him. In addition, each time Sergey Borisovich helped us with drawing up Seminar programs, searching for new speakers, acting as a chairman of sections, participating in the analysis of the results of the Seminar, and drafting resolutions [44]. Another memory of staying in the company of Sergey Borisovich is connected with the trip of the Russian group to the 70th anniversary of L. V. Tanin in March 2017 to Minsk. This meeting is alive in our memory, as if it happened yesterday.\n\nWe hope that the organization of the conferences will be supported by the closest colleagues and friends of S.B. Odinokov and this wonderful tradition of meetings at HOLOEXPO will continue for a long time.\n\nOn the Collaboration of Prof. S.B. Odinokov with the State Institute of Applied Optics and KNRTU-KAI\n\nAnatoliy V. Lukin 1, Andrei N. Melnikov 1, Rosalia Kh. Makaeva 2 and Nadezhda K. Pavlycheva 2\n\n1\n\nJoint-Stock Company “Scientific and Production Association “State Institute of Applied Optics”, Kazan, Russia\n\n2\n\nKazan National Research Technical University named after A. N. Tupolev, Kazan, Russia\n\nWe deeply mourn the sudden death of Sergey Borisovich Odinokov, Doctor of Technical Sciences, Professor of Bauman Moscow State Technical University—an outstanding researcher, successful organizer, talented teacher, and popularizer of science, whose real contribution to the formation and development of modern domestic holography in its various applications is difficult to overestimate. Here it is appropriate to recall the well-known definition: “A person is a set of social relations”, which piercingly exactly corresponds to the active, highly competent, sociable, charming, and valued friendship Sergey Borisovich, who promoted international unity among university, scientific, public and industrial teams of holographists to solve common topical scientific and technical issues and exchange experience.\n\nWe want to mention several points in our joint activity with S.B. Odinokov, characterizing his bright personal qualities, breadth of the scientific outlook, and deep competence in certain scientific and technical issues.\n\nOf course, this is the holding of annual International conferences “HOLOEXPO” in various parts of Russia, providing large-scale popularization of the ideas of holography in a variety of its applied implementations, contributing to the promotion of the most advanced scientific achievements and the exchange of technical solutions in the field of holographic technologies and, of course, stimulating the involvement of students in scientific activities.\n\nA great impression and a useful school for us was the organization and holding of the HOLOEXPO 2015 conference in our native Kazan, based on the A. N. Tupolev KNRTU-KAI, when we turned out to be direct participants in the “headquarters” of the organizers under the leadership of the energetic S.B. Odinokov, who had a long-term developed algorithm for communicating with different levels of specialists, managers, and sponsors, guaranteeing a 100% positive result. So, we saw this type of activity “from the inside” and used this experience many times in the future (Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14).\n\nDespite his extreme employment, Sergey Borisovich was always ready to support young scientists—postgraduates and doctoral students, including highly qualified advice and assistance in organizing their performances at the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, as well as preparing reviews for dissertations.\n\nThe unexpected departure of Sergey Borisovich interrupted the planned areas of cooperation with the “holographists” of the State Institute of Applied Optics in terms of the development and creation of specialized technological equipment for the implementation of digital holography capabilities, including through the use of axial computer-generated hologram optical elements. However, we are confident that the specialists and scientific and technological foundations of the State Institute of Applied Optics remain a necessary and sufficient basis for the implementation of promising projects jointly with Sergey Borisovich’s students and colleagues within this current scientific direction.\n\nLet’s support the continuation of the traditions of the HOLOEXPO conference. This will be a worthy tribute to Sergey Odinokov.\n\nConference HOLOEXPO\n\nElena N. Bogachevskaya\n\nDirector, HoloGrate, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\nJust a few days before the XVIII International Conference on Holography and Applied Optical Technologies HOLOEXPO-2021 had been started, we lost Professor Sergey B. Odinokov, the permanent Leader and Chairman of Organizing and Program Committees of all 18 Conferences.\n\nI met Sergey more than twenty years ago and all these years have been filled with fruitful cooperation and warm friendly communication.\n\nProfessor Odinokov initiated a new conference named HOLOEXPO, gathering the holographic community of Russia and the former USSR, scattered over the post-Soviet period, as well as many foreign colleagues.\n\nThe conference and exhibition HOLOEXPO were held annually in cities of Russia—Moscow, St. Petersburg, Suzdal, Sochi, Kazan, Yaroslavl, Zvenigorod, Nizhny Novgorod, Gelendzhik, as well as abroad in Minsk and Kiev. This made it possible to involve not only well-known scientists and business representatives but also students and graduate students of specialized higher educational institutions from these cities. The contribution of Professor Odinokov is invaluable in preserving the scientific heritage of eminent scientists and in passing the baton to young colleagues.\n\nEach year Conference expanded the spectrum of issues filled with modern content: security applied, computer-generated, digital and volumetric holography, hologram optics, nanotechnology, photographic materials, interferometry, augmented and virtual reality. Thanks to Professor Odinokov the Conference has had an atmosphere of friendly communication and constructive exchange of views. The Conference largely contributed to the development of interaction between business and scientific and educational institutions. Sergey managed to do everything: careful selection of reports, negotiations with sponsors, and arrangement of the conference program. Furthermore, he even acted as an entertainer at gala banquets of conferences! All these were just in addition to his huge scientific, teaching, and commercial core activities.\n\nThe XVIII Conference, which took place on 20–23 September 2021 in Gelendzhik, was fully prepared by Professor Odinokov. It passed successfully, unfortunately without his presence, but in LOVING MEMORY of him.\n\nThe Organizing Committee, colleagues, and students of Professor Odinokov—we plan to continue the HOLOEXPO Conference annually in the future.\n\nThe memory of Sergey—in our HEARTS (Figure 15).\n\nDisplay Holography Has Lost a Vivid Aficionado in the Person of Sergey Odinokov\n\nAlkis Lembessis\n\nDirector of Hellenic Institute of Holography, Athens, Greece\n\nThe Holography world has become poorer and that of Display Holography has lost a vivid aficionado in the person of Sergey Borisovich Odinokov. A familiar personality to those regularly attending conferences on our theme, Sergey Borisovich suddenly passed away only a few days prior to seeing the birth of “his” latest child, HOLOEXPO 2021. A big loss for the continuous promotion of holography in all aspects (academic, scientific, commercial) in Russia and elsewhere, to which Sergey has dedicated his active zeal in parallel to all other academic involvements in the field.\n\nWe knew of his academic achievements at Baumann Univ. in Moscow, we knew of his commercial applications in holography (with most prominent that of holographic sights) but above all, we have witnessed and shared his genuine interest and admiration for good old ultra-realistic display holography.\n\nWe have participated in practically all HOLOEXPO conferences between 2009 and 2019 (when COVID stopped our travels, not the conference) and we have always enjoyed his warm hospitality, his relaxed human attitude, and his casual generosity on both official and personal levels (Figure 16 and Figure 17). Above all, we have been given the chance through his conference to visit distant places in “Mother Russia” and make lots of fellow friends in spite of language barriers and age differences. Holography (and vodka) has always been the connecting link. His friendly nature will be missed, and we want to extend our most sincere condolences to his family. There is a tribute in preparation by his countless friends and colleagues (in English and Russian) which we will share from here once it has been published. The best way to preserve his memory is by continuing to support his HOLOEXPO conferences (all Proceedings and Programs are available at the HOLOEXPO website [45].\n\nLet’s raise our METAXA glasses to his memory as he must have certainly enjoyed it.\n\nThe Golden Letters of Our Industry\n\nRajan Thomas\n\nIgnetta Holographie (P) Ltd., Coimbatore, India\n\nDr. Odinokov was a very good friend of Dr. Vadivelan and me. He had an untimely departure from this world. We see him as the golden letters of our industry. It is a great loss for all of us (Figure 18).\n\nS. B. Odinokov—A Glorious Successor of the Remarkable Achievements of Soviet Specialists in the Field of Holography and Photonics\n\nMichel Grosmann\n\nPresident European Photonics Association, Louis Pasteur University, Strasbourg, France\n\nSince I first came to the USSR in 1971, more than 50 years ago I got acquainted and became friends with many colleagues. The quality of optics and Soviet opticians was remarkable, especially in the field of holography… In 1974, at the Eindhoven Congress, we created the word and concept of Photonics. Then in 1977 in Strasbourg, we created the first European Photonics Congress, in which 20 Soviet colleagues participated, and the first European Hologram Exhibition which then circulated throughout Europe and was presented in 95 places to several million visitors.\n\nOver the years, old colleagues and friends have left us… Already it was the turn of our esteemed colleague and friend Sergey Borisovich Odinokov.\n\nTogether we worked (often in relationships with each other) to develop Holography and Photonics.\n\n-\n\nThrough our personal theoretical or experimental work: He has, for example, helped me a lot in the development, study, and modeling of the propagation of wavefronts…\n\n-\n\nThrough the organization of collective activities:\n\n-\n\nUniversity Management (he was scientific director of the institute in Baumann University and myself vice President of Pasteur University)\n\n-\n\nOrganization of Congresses and various meetings (Figure 19)\n\n-\n\nAnimation and direction of Associations\n\nWe had similar views on the importance and social utility of education and scientific research for the general interest. By collaborating we appreciated each other a lot and became great friends. The grief that his loss causes us is commensurate with his great qualities.\n\nSergey Odinokov and 3D Holography\n\nMichail K. Shevtsov 1 and Yves Gentet 2\n\n1\n\nLeading Researcher of the Vavilov State Optical Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia\n\n2\n\nAtelier Art and Holography of Y. Gentet, Bordeaux, France\n\nSimilar to a true captain of a ship called “Holography” Sergey Borisovich Odinokov gathered and headed a team of specialists from different parts of our country and had a great enthusiastic relationship with many holographists from near and far abroad.\n\nHe was erudite with a deep understanding of holographic science combined with a friendly and optimistic person. He was our enthusiastic leader of the holographic world, and the HOLOEXPO conference organized by him each year was successfully operated for over 18 years.\n\nHe considered display holography and specialists working in this field, which was not directly related to his own scientific interest, with great interest and respect. Moreover, he was sincerely interested not only in scientific and technical achievements in this field but also in the application of display holograms.\n\nHe gave an opportunity to our foreign colleagues to demonstrate their results during HOLOEXPO: Ian Lancaster (about the commercial aspect of holography), Hans Bjelkhagen (about the history of the development of holography), Yves Gentet (about ULTIMATE materials, color analog, and computer-synthesized holograms), Alkis Lembessis (about successful museum projects and outstanding exhibitions of holograms). Sergey Borisovich was able to evaluate and encourage all these achievements. His interest and support aroused respect and inspired further work to take advantage of his invitation and demonstrate something new once again. Chapeau bas, Maître! (Figure 20, Figure 21 and Figure 22).\n\nA Mission to Talk about Holography\n\nSegrey G. Kalenkov\n\nDoctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor, Moscow Polytechnic University, Moscow, Russia\n\nIn the 80s of the last century, our country was one of the leaders in the field of holography. An enormous contribution to holography was made by Yuri Nikolayevich Denisyuk—Fresnel of the 20th century. Accordingly, during these times there were magnificent conferences and the so-called Schools on Holography, in which remarkable scientists took part. With the advent of digital holography, the relevance of ideas and their numerous applications only increases.\n\nSergey Borisovich successfully continued the most important mission of promoting holography, both in the field of theory and, most importantly, in practice. He was a kind of “Kulturträger” in this field of optics. His competence, benevolence, attention to youth, undoubted organizational talent is the secret of the success of numerous HOLOEXPO conferences, which he headed. Of course, his departure is a great loss for our science—Holography. Sergey Borisovich brought up a lot of talented youth at the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. This gives hope that his work will be continued.\n\nKeeping the History of Holography Is Important\n\nOlga F. Tikhomirova\n\nPolytechnic Museum, Moscow, Russia\n\nFor all his busyness and complicated activity, Sergey Borisovich did not disregard the Polytechnic Museum, which has one of few collections of historical holograms in Russia. It is known that Bauman University graduates are a special category of people. Several graduates of the Bauman University were working in the museum, in the optics department. In addition, the attraction of Sergey Borisovich to the events of the museum was a natural process. He always responded to requests for assistance: participation in the work of the Round Table or writing an expert opinion on the object. Thanks to his conclusion, the museum in 2014 acquired one of the expensive holograms of P. Gante. Since 2008, on the initiative of Sergey Borisovich, the Polytechnic Museum has been taking part in HOLOEXPO conferences. Conceiving that such events are important for the museum, despite the workload, he personally tracked the sending of invitations. When organizing this year’s conference, there was the same. Furthermore, who could have guessed that his confirmation call would be the last…\n\nSergey Odinokov Contribution to the Editorial Board of the Journal PHOTONICS RUSSIA\n\nNatalya L. Istomina\n\nDoctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Chief Editor of the Journal PHOTONICS RUSSIA, Moscow, Russia\n\nSergey Borisovich was one of the country’s leading scientists in the field of holography and optoelectronics. He was a member of the scientific and technical council of the Laser Association of Russia, led business programs and seminars, and connected scientists and production workers into groups. His energy and strength of charm attracted both like-minded people and students to his scientific search. He knew how to be generous and did not hesitate to ask for help from others. For almost 10 years, his name has strengthened the editorial board of the Journal PHOTONICS RUSSIA with its authority. All papers on the methods and principles of constructing optical-holographic systems for various purposes passed through his keen eyes. The life of Sergey Borisovich is a bright and eventful story of a strong and talented person. In his scientific work, Sergey Borisovich did a lot, for which he was loved by friends and colleagues. He was a wonderful friend and attentive conversationalist; he knew how to captivate people with him—his creative ebullient nature was reflected everywhere.\n\nOn the Development of the State Standard on Optical Holography\n\nOlga V. Andreeva\n\nDoctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, ITMO University, Saint-Petersburg, Russia\n\nI met S. B. Odinokov in 2006 at the International Conference “Optoinformatic”, where I made a lecture in memory of Yu. N. Denisyuk. After the report, he came up to me and invited me to the HOLOEXPO conference. Since then, as a participant, I have not missed a single conference, and with Sergey Borisovich, we have established good friendships and scientific contacts. At that time, he was interested in thick-layer recording media for recording multiplex holograms—it was interesting and exciting to work with him in this direction.\n\nFurious energy Sergey Borisovich combined with extraordinary benevolence, a broad scientific outlook, and a deep understanding of the problems of holography. That is why his contribution to the development of holography cannot be overestimated. In addition, this is not only the annual HOLOEXPO conferences that have brought together holography scientists. Fortunately for the entire scientific community, no time was wasted during the quarantine period. Sergey Borisovich initiated, organized, and then brought to a victorious end the work on the preparation of a new GOST (State Standard of the Russian Federation) on holography in three parts, which will be out in 2022 as an official document of the Russian Federation [46,47,48].\n\nIt should be noted that the terms and definitions of concepts are the most important part of the existence of any scientific direction and the basis for the interaction of interdisciplinary specialists. The previous GOST on holography was developed and adopted more than 40 years ago—at the dawn of holography development and its practical applications. Sergey Borisovich had understood the need for such work. He gathered specialists, uniting them by ZOOM, and, sparing no time and effort, promoted this work, bringing the most contradictory opinions and proposals “to a common denominator”. Perhaps, except for Sergey Borisovich, no one would have dared to undertake such work, and most importantly, they would hardly have been able to complete it in a rather limited time frame.\n\nIn the new GOST, at the modern scientific and technical level, the basic concepts of holography were revised, basic terms were clarified and revised, the terminology of promising modern directions of holography was worked out in detail. The developed and adopted GOST on holography is a huge contribution to the development of science in our country and a monument to Sergey Borisovich Odinokov, the organizer and leader of this project.\n\nShow Must Go On!\n\nVladimir Yu. Venediktov\n\nDoctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor, Saint Petersburg State Electrotechnical University “LETI” and Saint Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg, Russia\n\nWe met with Sergey Borisovich relatively recently—about 10 years ago. Surprisingly for already quite established people, we quickly found a common language and became friends. We found joint scientific interests, which allowed us to start fruitful cooperation (in particular, in the field of holographic wavefront sensors) and publish several joint articles. However, of course, the main area of our cooperation with him was Sergey Borisovich’s favorite brainchild—the HOLOEXPO conference. Knowing about my extensive experience in organizing various conferences and seminars, Sergey Borisovich persistently attracted me to the organization of HOLOEXPO. We prepared the program together, then selected articles and organized their publication in leading Russian and international journals.\n\nTherefore, at the end of August 2021, I was not surprised when Sergey Borisovich called me and said in a quite cheerful voice that he was ill, had to go to the hospital and asked me to replace him at the HOLOEXPO 2021 conference, which was supposed to begin in two weeks. We discussed the necessary details and said goodbye to the wishes of health and recovery. Who would have thought that this was our last conversation and less than two days later, Sergey Borisovich left us forever!\n\nTo say that I was in shock is to say nothing. This wound will not heal for a long time in the hearts of everyone who knew and loved Sergey Borisovich. However, there is nothing to do—we have held a conference, and the proceedings of the conference are now in the publication stage.\n\nIt is impossible to replace such a dedicated person as Sergey Borisovich, but, as they say, “Show must go on!”. My colleagues and I decided that the conference should continue. The heavy burden of the chairman of the program committee of the HOLOEXPO conference is now placed on me, and we will try to justify the trust of our late friend. The next conference, HOLOEXPO 2022, will be held in September this year in St. Petersburg. We intend to keep the main ideas laid down by Sergey Borisovich at the foundation of the conference, while there is an intention to return to the original idea of the conference combined with the exhibition. There is also a plan to expand the conference topic somewhat, as well as strengthen its business orientation and introduce an educational component (tutorials). This will be a good tribute to Professor Odinokov memory!\n\nConcluding Passage\n\nNikolay V. Petrov\n\nDr. Sci, Leading Researcher, Leading Professor, Head of the Digital and Display Holography Laboratory, ITMO University Saint Petersburg, Russia\n\nAlthough I knew of the existence of Sergey Odinokov thanks to the HOLOEXPO conference he organized and his brilliant talks at various holographic events and seminars, I have been personally acquainted with him for probably only the last five or six years. Nevertheless, during this time he has come into my life so gradually and naturally that I feel that we have known each other for ages. Since then, after one of the conferences held at Saint-Petersburg, Prof. Odinokov visited our university building and I have had the opportunity to detail our holographic research, we have established a very warm trusting relationship. People close in spirit and beliefs, when they find each other, immediately recognize the associates. That’s what happened to us. We had a common passion for holography, which, in the Russian post-Soviet realities, clearly needed a person who would take a big share of responsibility for its support and development. Sergey Odinokov was just that “locomotive”. He not only regularly, without interruptions united the post-Soviet holographic community at the conferences, he knew how to rally people, always knew where to be persistent, where flexibility, and where and to whom to lend a helping hand.\n\nIn the last couple of years, after the defense of my doctoral degree (habilitation), where Prof. Odinokov acted as an was the official opposer, we were linked by joint progressor activities: Next year after my defense Prof. Odinokov invited me for a working group on the preparation of Interstate standards (GOSTs) on Holography [46,47,48]. Moreover, S.B. Odinokov, together with V. Yu. Venediktov, V. V. Tuchin, and I was the representative of research groups from Russia in compiling a Roadmap on holography, published in 2020 [49]. This work attracted a lot of attention among the holographic community, and soon, several more thematic roadmaps were released by other research groups [50,51]. Among other things, we had many far-reaching plans: having become acquainted during the preparation of GOSTs on holography with the competencies of Prof. Odinokov in the field of controlling the authenticity of security holograms, I persuaded him to prepare a review paper on the state of the art in this area of research. Sudden death prevented the implementation of these plans. However, he prepared a strong team that will certainly continue his work.\n\nOne of the not mentioned examples that can characterize Sergey Odinokov as a person who was trusted by the holographic community to carry the burden of leadership is his plenary talk “Modern Trends in the Development of Holographic Technologies and Their Application in Applied Optics (Review)” on the conference: “Basic Problems of Optics-2019” (Figure 23). Prof. Odinokov personally agreed with the leaders of all the leading Russian groups working in this area on how best to present their latest achievements and made a gorgeous comprehensive overview report. It’s hard for me to imagine any other person in Russian holography that the various teams could rely on. Among the many statements about Sergey Borisovich, little has been said about his activities in organizing special issues based on the results of the HOLOEXPO conferences. Based on the results of the conference, special issues were prepared with the work of a Russian holographists. Sergey Odinokov personally interacted with the authors of publications, reviewers, and editorial boards when organizing these Special Issues [52,53,54]. In the last two years, it was a continuous life cycle—the annual HOLOEXPO conferences and the long process of preparing publications based on their results. On this path, he was assisted by Prof. V.Yu. Venediktov, who eventually took over this baton. In 2021, with Prof. Sergey Odinokov, in addition to the Russian scientific journals that have already become familiar for the conference participants, we decided to try our hand at organizing a Special Issue in Applied Sciences. Who could have foreseen that I would have to complete this process alone! I can only say that it was my duty to Sergey Borisovich to see this matter through to the end and help to recreate and fix this many-sided imprint that he left in our memories.\n\nSupplementary Materials\n\nThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/app12062892/s1. In preparing the tribute paper, we collected a large archive of photographs with S.B. Odinokov and many famous Russian holographists. We decided to place it as supporting materials. We believe that this chronicle is an important touch in the Russian holography.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, supervision, project administration, N.V.P.; writing—original draft preparation: O.I.O., V.Y.K., A.B.S., M.V.S., E.Y.Z., R.S.S., N.N.E., N.V.N., S.A.S., L.V.T., G.A.G., N.M.G., A.V.L., A.N.M., R.K.M., N.K.P., E.N.B., A.L., R.T., M.G., M.K.S., Y.G., S.G.K., O.F.T., N.L.I., O.V.A. and V.Y.V.; resources, M.V.S., N.V.P., E.Y.Z., N.M.G., N.V.N. and A.L.; writing—review and editing, N.V.P., M.V.S. and V.Y.V.; visualization (photo archive), O.I.O., M.V.S., N.M.G., M.K.S., V.Y.K., L.V.T., E.N.B. and A.L.
