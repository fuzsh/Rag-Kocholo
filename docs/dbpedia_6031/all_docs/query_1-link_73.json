        "text": "This year, there have been four Jewish Nobel Prize winners in 6 categories: Physics, Economics, Literature, and Medicine. Now Jews make up nearly a quarter – 22,5% – of the world’s most prestigious award laureates. Even though they only represent around 0.2% of the global population. There are millions of highly educated people all over the world, and yet this contest is often dominated by Jewish scientists.\n\nSomehow, of all the nations, those have been the Jews who gave the world the most Nobel laureates as well as inventions (in percentage terms), and Israel built in the sands and surrounded by hostile neighbors, became a country of startups.\n\nWe made a list of the greatest Jewish inventors whose discoveries and inventions once changed the world.\n\n1. Albert Einstein – Theory of relativity\n\nThe physicist Albert Einstein is the author of the theory of relativity, which changed the way we understand our Universe.
