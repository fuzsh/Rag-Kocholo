        "text": "ANIMAFEST PRO | ANIMAFEST SCANNER V | ANIMAFEST SCANNER V - Panel 2: Characters in Animation\n\n(Un)masking the Human Condition: Nature and Stylistics of ‘Character Animation’ in Igor Kovalyov’s Films – Mikhail Gurevich (independent scholar, USA)\n\nIt’s not very easy to recognize, at the first place, that in his extravagant and not-so-transparent, highly stylized narratives, Igor Kovalyov is in fact dealing with good-old character animation – albeit of a quite specific and complex variety. With emphasis on certain ‘dramatization of gags’ and graphic gestures and postures in portraying, here seemingly ‘realistic’ characters as if constantly oscillate between inner and outer perspective, between almost ideographic type-casting, so to speak, with sad-ironic distancing, and introspective psychologising, with metaphysical connotations, beneath that. It might even appear that the very concept of the ‘character’ and modes of presentation are being questioned and problematized – which poses both a challenge and exciting task to read in those ‘tales of solitude’, inhabited by weirdish and touching creatures, the underlying existential tension revealed through them.\n\nFrom carnivalesque masks in early films to shadowy ‘double exposure’ of the faces in the later ones – such moves, rather persistently employed by Kovalyov, can be taken as a self-revealing metaphor through which we can view and try to interpret his approach and style, especially with regard to the treatment of acting figures in his films – ambivalent, jestering and as though analytical at the same time.\n\nI’ll attempt to trace, even if cursory, the evolution of Kovalyov characters in the progression of his personal and, in part, commercial projects, and their roots in his original graphic artwork where we find characteristic sketchy portraiture in dynamic snapshots with gag-y twists; and to put the constructive principles and the artistic devices involved against the backdrop of different traditions and influences Kovalyov had inherited and experienced."
