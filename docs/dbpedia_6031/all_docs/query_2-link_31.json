        "text": "STARS: STaff Appreciation and Recognition\n\nDr. Kaushansky passed along this email from a retired SB Medicine staff member\n\nLast week I underwent an epidural procedure for a herniated disk performed by Dr. Amit Kaushal, a young physician at our pain management center. He had taken the time prior to the procedure to respond in detail via email to my questions. The procedure was painless even without sedation which I attribute to his technique. I also noted the way he had organized the team participating in the procedure, including a resident, rad assistants, a nurse, and a medical student. They all exhibited an esprit which I, again, attribute to Dr. Kaushalâ€™s team leadership skills. I consider myself very fortunate to have access to SBM medical technology and to physicians like Dr. Kaushal.\n\nDr. Gan received this email from a Stony Brook employee\n\nWhen I had knee surgery about one year ago, I received anesthesia from Joseph Gnolfo, CRNA and everything went very well. Recently, I had the scare of my life when my OB/Gyn found precancerous cells and recommended a total hysterectomy. There's nothing like having an anesthetist in your back pocket! So I asked Joseph to be there again for me. He was there at the morning of surgery and explained the whole procedure to me and my family. But my surgery was delayed and he had to go to some meetings. He introduced me to Dorothy Gozdziak, CRNA. She did a wonderful job with my anesthesia. Joseph also came to see me later on. Now that I am cancer-free and back to work, I want to send a big \"thank you\" to all the members of the team.\n\nDr. Gan received two thank you letters from a Stony Brook faculty member\n\nI would like to express my gratitude and deep appreciation to Dr. Jonathon Schwartz who was the anesthesiologist during my surgery on 3/12/2020. Dr. Schwartz was professional, kind and respectful. His expertise and knowledge together with his pleasant and respectful demeanor, embodied the meaning of patient-centered care. I had previously had an unpleasant experience related to anesthesia and Dr. Schwartz showed me that it does not have to be so bad. He was patient, listened to my concerns and practiced shared decision-making which made me feel at ease.\n\nDr. Schwartz was able to accommodate my wishes to avoid narcotics and benzodiazepines which gave me a better sense of control over a situation I had little control over. The thorough care I got left me without nausea after the surgery and I was able to go home in good shape. I am convinced that the care I got from him and the rest of the providers and allied health providers was the best out there. The surgery and the recovery went well, and I am now happier and less concerned about my cancer risk. I am aware that Dr. Schwartz provides anesthesia as part of routine care, but for me this was not routine. For me, the care I received was outstanding and starkly different than my previous unpleasant experience and I wanted you to know the impact that it has on me as an individual, wife, and mother. Thank you for giving me such great care!\n\nI would like to express my gratitude and deep appreciation to Haldana Histand, CRNA who was the anesthesiology Nurse during my surgery on 3/12/2020. Nurse Histand was professional, kind and respectful. I had previously had an unpleasant experience related to anesthesia and was overall nervous before my surgery and Nurse Histand with her upbeat personality helped me stay relaxed in the morning of my surgery. I felt cared for and in good hands.\n\nNurse Histand respected my wishes to avoid benzodiazepines before the surgery which gave me a better sense of control over a situation I had little control over. Nurse Histand was patient, listened to my concerns and practiced shared decision-making which made me feel at ease. I am convinced that the care I got from her and the rest of the providers and allied health providers was the best out there.\n\nI am aware that Nurse Histand does this in routine care, but for me this was not routine. For me, the care I received was outstanding and starkly different than my previous unpleasant experience and I wanted you to know the impact that it has on me as an individual, wife, and mother. Thank you for giving me such great care."
