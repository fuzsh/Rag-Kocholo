He has appeared as leader with a wide variety of ensembles including the Budapest Festival Orchestra, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Arcangelo, Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, Dunedin Consort and English Chamber Orchestra and as section principal on both violin and viola, with the Philharmonia, Amsterdam Sinfonietta and many others.

With these groups and others, Michael has performed at Carnegie Hall, the Wigmore Hall, Royal Concertgebouw, the Louvre, Melbourne Recital Centre, at the Verbier, Edinburgh, Aix-en-Provence and Aldeburgh Festivals and in numerous other venues and festivals across the world. He has also recorded extensively for the Hyperion label, including the London Haydn Quartet’s complete cycle of Haydn quartets. Further recordings include two albums with the Nash Ensemble, Schumann piano trios with the Rhodes Piano Trio, clarinet quintets by Weber and Krommer with the London Haydn Quartet, as well as four albums for Alpha as leader of Arcangelo.
