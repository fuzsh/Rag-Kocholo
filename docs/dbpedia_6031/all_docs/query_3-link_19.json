        "text": "MiG-3 WWII Russian Fighter The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 was a WWII Soviet fighter aircraft of World. It was a development of the MiG-1 in an attempt to curb some of that aircraft's handling problems. Mikoyan and Gurevich made a large number of modifications to the MiG-1 design after field testing revealed a number of dangerous characteristics of the type.\n\nThe most significant of these was doubling the dihedral of the outer wings in an attempt to create more stability, and lengthening the nose of the aircraft to move the engine and therefore center of gravity further forward. These changes were quickly implemented on the MiG-1 production line, and by March 1941, 10 of these aircraft were coming off the production line every day. It was not long before the type would see combat, claiming a pair of German Junkers Ju 86 reconnaissance aircraft even before the start of hostilities between Germany and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe MiG-1 had originally been designed as a high-altitude interceptor, and this is where the MiG-3 excelled as well. The full circle turn time improved from 26.5 seconds to 23 seconds. However, most of the combat against the German invasion took place at very low altitudes, where the aircraft did not stand out at all. Some attempt was made to put it to use as a ground-attack aircraft, but it was quickly withdrawn from this role. From Spring 1942 onwards, the MiG-3s were moved from the front line to air-defense squadrons, some of which flew them for the rest of the war.\n\nThroughout the rest of the war, Mikoyan and Gurevich continued to develop the MiG-3 along the high-altitude interceptor lines that it had originally been designed for, leading to a series of ever-larger and more powerful prototypes, the I-220 to I-225. While promising enough, the air war over Germany was demonstrating that the heyday of the piston engine fighter was over, and no production order followed.\n\nBetween December 1940 and December 1941, more than 3,100 MiG-3s were built.\n\nMiG -3 WWII Fighter\n\nThe first wartime generation Soviet fighter was also the first to result from collaboration between two designers who were to become world famous for their long-running series of fighter aircraft: Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich. The MiG-l and its successors of the war years were not in absolute terms the best fighters to be produced by the Soviet Union during the course of the Second World War, but, although constructed in fairly small numbers overall, they made a considerable impact on the course of the war.\n\nThe MiG-1 prototype flew for the first time in March 1940, and immediately gave proof of excellent performance, particularly in speed greatly superior to that of the various types of Polikarpov fighters which were in service at the time.\n\nThe aircraft was a low-wing monoplane, with retractable undercarriage, mixed wood/metal structure and canvas skin. It was powered by a Mikulin AM 35 1,200 hp engine, which drove a three-blade metal variable pitch propeller. It was armed with two 7.62 mm machine guns. one 12.7 mm gun and had a maximum bomb-capacity equivalent to 440 lb. Production was started immediately and 2,100 aircraft were completed before the MiG-1 was replaced by its more modern successor, the MiG-3.\n\nThe MiG-3 fighter went into service towards the end of 1941 and its design earned Mikoyan and Gurevich the Stalin Prize for that year, in consideration of the outstanding contribution they had made to the Soviet aeronautical industry. Although it was not an outstanding fighter plane in the strictest sense of the term, the MiG-3 did have certain features which enabled it to be used in the role of a high altitude interceptor, in order to oppose the German fighters of the time.\n\nArmor was fitted behind the pilot's seat in the MiG-3. This was 8 mm think and later increased to 9 mm. Cooled exhaust gas was feed to the fuel tanks to act as a fire suppressant.\n\nThe MiG-3 differed mainly from its direct predecessor as regards its engine and in range. Indeed, while keeping the same structure and general design of a single-engine single seater, with low wings. retractable undercarriage and liquid-cooled engine, the MiG-3 used a more powerful V-12 Mikulin AM 35A engine and was equipped with a supplementary fuel tank which improved its operational capabilities.\n\nOther minor modifications, which tended to improve the flight performance and maneuverability of the aircraft, were made to the cockpit (which was now equipped with a rear window to enlarge the pilot's field of vision and was completely enclosed), the wing (the rear of which had increased dihedral), the propeller (replaced with one of a more efficient type) and the ventral radiator. The structure of the MiG-3 was still mixed and the skin was in wood and aluminum, like the MiG-1.\n\nThe armament, too, was identical: two 7.62 mm ShKas machine guns, a Beresin 12.7 mm gun and a maximum bomb-load of 200 440 lb. Speed and range, however, were noticeably better: from 390 mph at 22,970 ft altitude to 407 mph at the same altitude, while the range was almost half as great again as that of the MiG-1.\n\nFrom the time the MiG-3 started operations it immediately showed its real potential. Above 16,400 ft altitude the aircraft gave its best performance and it was fit to face all comers: at lower altitudes, however, it showed a noticeable reduction in speed and maneuverability which meant that it was at a disadvantage compared with the fighters of the Luftwaffe.\n\nAnother shortcoming when it was used in battle was the inadequacy of its armament: the two small-caliber machine guns were clearly insufficient: an effort was therefore made to remedy this by installing two 12.7 mm Beresin B's under the wings.\n\nProduction of the MiG-3 was short-lived: towards the end of 1941 the assembly lines were closed down, in part because construction of the AM 35A engine was being superseded by the more powerful AM 38 which was intended for the Ilyushin Il-1. The fighter stayed in service until the last months of 1943. At that time it had already been replaced by the more up-to-date Yakovlev and Lavochkin, but it remained useful for tactical high altitude reconnaissance. It was the entry of this new and efficient aircraft which meant that Mikoyan and Gurevich' s next aircraft, the MiG-5, was only a limited success. Being in direct competition with the Lavochkin La-5, the MiG-5 suffered from being outclassed by its contemporary and only a small number were produced, remaining in service for a brief period in 1943.\n\nThe MiG-5 prototype flew in 1942: it preserved the structure of its predecessor, with the exception of variations made necessary by the adoption of the Shvetsov M 82A radial engine in place of the V-12 AM 35A. The two designers returned to the inline engine in the next model, the MiG-7, the prototype of which appeared towards the end of 1944. The fighter had been commissioned with the specific aim of producing a high-altitude interceptor, able to shoot down German reconnaissance planes. The MiG-7 fulfilled these requirements, but very few were made because by that time the danger from enemy reconnaissance aircraft had diminished. The development of the MiG-7 did play an important part in the next technical advance for high level aircraft: among Soviet aircraft it was the first with a completely pressurized cockpit.\n\n.\n\nThe slogan painted on the aircraft reads \"Za Rodinu\" – \"For the Motherland\"\n\nSpecifications\n\nA: In an effort to bolster the MiGs poor armament, a BK 12.7 mm (.50 cal.) machine gun was added in an individual pod beneath each wing. B: Armor was fitted behind the pilot's seat in the MiG-3. This was 8-mm thick, later increased to 9-mm Cooled exhaust gas was fed to the fuel tanks to act as a fire suppressant.\n\nA: In the long nose section was the Mikulin AM 35 engine with two 29 gallon fuel tanks. The MiG-3 had a second oil cooler and improved engine cooling compared to the MiG-1. B: All armament was grouped above the engine, and consisted of a UBS 12.7 mm (.50 cal.). machine gun with 300 rounds and two 7.62-mm (.30 cal.) ShKAS machine guns with 375 rounds each. C: Like most Soviet aircraft the MiG-3 had an austere cockpit fit, with only 13 instruments and no radio. The pilot sighted his weapons through a PBP-1 gun sight. D: Although the forward fuselage was made of steel tubing with an alloy stressed skin, the rear fuselage consisted of four pine longerons with a very thin plywood and calico skin.\n\nThis fabulous MiG-3 cutaway comes in a 5MB PDF with key for FREE included in your MyModels folder!"
