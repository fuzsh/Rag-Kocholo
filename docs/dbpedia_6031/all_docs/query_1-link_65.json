        "text": "HSU Alexei Mikhailovich Batievskii\n\nInterview by Konstantin Chirkin\n\nUploaded on August 3, 2010\n\nback to pilots index\n\nInterview by Konstantin Chirkin with HSU Alexei Mikhailovich Batievskii\n\nEditor I. Zhidov.\n\nTranslation by Oleg Korytov and Ilya Grinberg.\n\nSpecial thanks to Svetlana Spiridonova and Oleg Rastrenin.\n\nBatievskii{1}:\n\nI was born in Ukraine at Gorodishe, which lies between Kiev and Poltava.\n\nWhen I saw first airplane? We walked barefooted at Podol. Dad carried my younger brother on his shoulders; mom was walking by his side. We were going to visit my grandfather. Over the church there was a large bird flying. An airplane! Dad took my brother off his shoulders and said:\n\n— This figure is called a “Death loop”.\n\nThat’s how I saw an airplane for the first time. When I was studying at 6th grade, a panic begun — “Po-2” had landed behind the forest. All school went there. Airplane had to land due to icing. Women brought samovar of hot water, and poured it on the engine. Two aviators dressed in leather coats and pants allowed boys to step on the first step and take a look into the cabin. I looked too: it was filled with instruments that looked like watches.\n\nPilot warmed up and started the engine, turned around and took off leaving only a cloud of snow behind them. It happened on Friday. All Saturday and Sunday my brothers and I made a model of an airplane, but when we brought it to school on Monday, we found out that boys from senior grades had made airplanes with so large wings and tails that they couldn’t fit in the doors. It was fascination with aviation!\n\nRussian language teacher had suggested us to write a composition about \"Who I want to be\". I wrote that I want to be a pilot. Another boy, Ivan, also wrote that he would like to become a pilot. He perished in infantry during the war…\n\nOnce, father took me to regional center Lohvitsa. We sold pears, cheese, apples… Dad suggested that I should buy any book that I would like to. I noticed a book “I want to be a pilot”. So I bought it. It was very intriguing to read about flying, about different instruments. There was a story about a very important flight that one pilot made: he took off from Sweden, overflew Danish straights and landed in Denmark. The real distance was approximately 20 kilometers. But then it was a miracle. Then one kolkhoz worker came to me and said:\n\n— I have a very interesting book about flying, would you like to read it?\n\nHe was really educated and liked books. He gave me well used book «Air Digest». There was a novel «Wings of Victory». It described how Red pilot fought during Civil war. Both these books are still in my home library. He presented it to me because I taught his younger sister to read. A commission came to check her knowledge. I warned her: Stalin is a General Secretary of the Communist Party. She replied to this question:\n\n– Stalin – Red Army General.\n\nThey simply laughed and it was it…\n\n– Ukraine, 1933 — hunger. Do you remember it?\n\nIt was terrible. I, being as small as I was, still understood everything. There were 22 houses at our street, whole families died out. Poet Oleynik established a monument to the victims of hunger in Dubno area. Hunger… The reason for it was strange…\n\nFirst years after Kolkhozes were organized were productive, even though it was very little order in organization and management. My advisor in postgraduate school later became chief of Main Political Directorate, Professor Krinitskiy Aleksandr Markovich. He was a medical doctor but practiced politics. He was personally responsible for kolkhozes and reported to Kaganovich in person. Kaganovich was a shoemaker but was dealing with collectivization of agriculture. Narkom of agriculture was also a Jew, or some other non-Russian. I read their speeches at XVII party meeting…\n\nStalin squeezed grain out of population to sell it for gold, and buy machinery. It was hard way out of situation, but by no other means we could have been ready for war with Germany. Crops were good. And the authorities took bread, gold, and silver from people in order to buy industrial equipment. How did they got bread? Representative from the regional administration was coming with a pistol. They would walk in a barn for inspection. We locked a dog in our pigsty; there was a barrel with grain. They could take it away. Some activist from the city came with a gun. We told her not to open the door because it was a big dog that we can't contain. The city girl did not realize the trick and we got away. But someone else did not get away. Somebody would snitch, and somebody would steal and hide half-a sack of grain. Things like that happened.\n\nAnd here a famine struck no crop. During Turkish war my grandfather was awarded with silver Georgian Cross and large medal \"for bravery\". I played with these awards a lot when I was little. Also a colonel presented him with a clock that played music. When grandfather recalled war at Balkans, he cried. When the famine struck, father took awards, silver coins and the clock to “Torgsin”, and came back with two sacks of flour. My uncle had 8 kids, my other uncle had 8 kids also, none of them died. Those, who lived opposite from us had a cow. They made it too.\n\n– Why your family survived?\n\nSons were already grown up. They could work and earn something. We had an apiary. We had honey from previous year. Honey does not rot. There also were two rivers with marshy banks. A grass was growing there, roots of which are eatable and contain protein. But people lived nearby and didn’t know about it!\n\n– Your family survived because it had honey?\n\nYes. And cows. But even those who had a cow died.\n\n– Weren’t you ordered to hand a cow over to kolkhoz?\n\nCows were not taken to kolkhoz, they took horses. They also tried to take calves. It was a serious and stupid mistake – a head of kolkhoz was a poor peasant, who was stupid and lazy man, who never had a horse before. Horses then were main transport. Collectivization was poorly organized, and this leads to hunger.\n\n– Your family suffered from repressions – your father was imprisoned...\n\nFather was imprisoned because one of the bosses decided to kill a sick horse to make ropes of it. They did it. My father was a foreman and let a Gypsy man to leave his work to skin the horse. My dad was sent to prison for 7 years. The boss got 10 years and the Gypsy also got 10 years. My dad and the Gypsy returned. But the boss did not make it in the camp, he died there.\n\n– What did you think about it?\n\nWhat could I think if they were sued for a sick horse?!\n\n– Were you a Komsomol member?\n\nI became komsomol member during the war. I was a member of the Regiment komsomol bureau. I also was a member of officers’ honor court.\n\nDad was sentenced for 7 years in 1937. Mom stayed alone. When I was in the 9th grade, I had to start working at the forge. I worked there all summer long. At first my hands were aching, but I got used to work in couple of weeks. When I was in the 10th grade, I had to walk to another school, which was 7 kilometers away… Last day of classes was coming. It was a hot May. My friend Anatolii, who was an honor student, and I were walking to the school. From the gorge it was a stream of cold water. I drank a bit, but my teeth begun aching. Anatolii drank a lot, and he did not come to the school on the next day. I came to visit him. I found Anatolii coughing with blood – he had pneumonia. Three days later he died. I was afraid to come close to his coffin, to see him dead… Everybody was preparing to State exams, but there was only one thought in my mind: poor Anatolii studied hard, and now what?… I took all my books, and threw them into the bushes… Although I didn’t tell anyone at home that I stopped going to school. Anyway, I passed all exams with good marks, except for German language, which I didn’t like. Not that I didn’t like the language itself — the teacher was stupid, and I didn’t study...\n\nAnatolii, who was dead by now, planned to apply to a journalism department at Kiev University. But where should I go?! Dad is in jail, we have no money. Although my uncle was an important official and grandfather was the first chair of the village council. Where could I go? So I applied for the closest pedagogical institute, at the Lubnya city, which was 12 kilometers away. Mom gave me a piece of lard, three rubles, a loaf of bread, cucumbers. I went there and passed all exams. At the mandate commission a guy with blue insignia of NKVD asked:\n\n— Do you know Marusya Batievskaya? Is she your relative?\n\nI knew that she was a champion of Poltava district in running. I replied:\n\n— We have a lot of Batievskii.\n\nHe smiled and said:\n\n— Good, you answer correctly.\n\nI was accepted to the institute. At this time dad appealed to the Supreme Court, and some time later he was released. Two month later the Supreme Court had cleared him of all guilt completely. It was 1938-1939. Then it was a summer break. I remember I got a stipend for two month, so I bought a radio and hummock.\n\nSecond year at the institute — Germans attacked Poland. We started to feel the war is coming close. At the time of Finnish war I completed my education at Lubnenskii Pedagogical Institute. In 1940 I passed final exams, got my diploma and was sent to work to Kharkov region.\n\nMy friends were mobilized. Mobilization was somewhat strange. I wasn’t called in. Young boys after 9th grade of school were called to arms, but I, after the institute, wasn’t. Experienced teachers were called to war, while young ones stayed in their place.\n\nAt that time my cousin Vasilii came to visit us during vacation. He was a Senior Lieutenant, in blue uniform, squadron navigator somewhere near Samara, Parachute sport instructor. So he suggested that I apply to a military school. My father was a sailor. He was a member of a revolutionary committee of the battleship «Yevstafiy» {2}, the flagship of Black Sea fleet. Together with Revkom he disarmed Kolchak — fleet commander. He wrote it down to his diary, which I still have. It is written there that it was Kerenskii, who gave an order to disarm officers…\n\nDad said:\n\n— You should go to the naval school.\n\nI thought: \"I will, but to the naval aviation\". I went to Nikolayev, to the naval aviation school named after Levanevskii {3}. It was a navigators school. I passed exams, they were very difficult. For one place there were 20 candidates. But I made it through. I received a document that I was accepted.\n\nI remember well how I felt when I received a passport — \"I’m free, no one is going to keep me in kolkhoz\". Then no one could leave kolkhoz. I ran all 17 kilometers; I had a passport in my pocket…\n\nI had a free month, when guys were departing to the Finnish war. Then I went to the school… There we got dressed into blue overalls, soldiers boots. Lieutenant on duty said:\n\n— Take a mop and sweep the floor of the living quarter.\n\nI didn’t know how it is done. He was not embarrassed to show it to me himself… But that was all education that I received at Levanevskii school. Part of the cadets from this school, including me, was transferred to Yeisk naval aviation school named after Stalin. We went there by train. There were excellent rooms. We immediately got naval striped t-shirts. From the second day education had begun. The order there was impeccable. I never saw anything like this. It was something like a monastery.\n\nThere were cases when cadets were expelled from the school. For example, someone decided to drink eau de cologne as a New Year beverage – they read that it contained alcohol. In 24 hours they were expelled from the school. No discussions. Three brothers were also expelled. All three were good gymnasts. Strong guys, they went for a leave, and somebody provoked them. They begun fighting and when the garrison commandant with MPs arrived, they tied them with ropes. For this they were expelled. But next year they were accepted again.\n\nDuring winter we finished theoretical training. Spring of 1941. Po-2 airplane with ripped wings – to be sure that no one would take off. We had to “hold the line” – taxiing practice. Push the throttle – engine rotates the propeller and thrust appears. Somebody holds left wing, we have to turn around a pole with a flag on. You have to do it slowly, otherwise you will overshoot. We had to taxi this way for several times. One cadet caught a pole with a wing. Chief of the flight school General-Lieutenant Andreev appeared. He walked to Starshina, smiled and said:\n\n— What’s going on here? Make sure all is in order here.\n\nThen he left. After this taxiing practice we were divided into flight training groups. There was one instructor in flight group, six cadets and one Po-2 airplane. Our group instructor was Georgii Charin. In our group one of the cadets was a Starshina, he completed his mandatory service and stayed in the service. His wife and kid lived in the village. He was dressed immaculately. Even officers were not dressed that way. He was very democratic; he never showed his supremacy over younger guys. Second – group Starshina Petr Gnetov, Belorussian. He had finished medical college. Others were Alexei Medyankin, a Siberian, and Alexei Tatarinov from Lipezk. The last one was Vladimir, very polite. He happened to be a son of Party Central Committee, commander of Far Eastern Army, who was executed. His uncle was a candidate to politburo member…\n\nWe began to study theory of fast bomber SB. Meanwhile we kept flying Po-2, it was a time for solo aerobatics training. Alexei Tatarinov almost killed me. We flew together. One was flying the plane and another one was sitting as a passenger. I was at the passenger place when I noticed that airspeed indicator showed 65 kilometers per hour, while it should be 100. At the airspeed of 60-65 this airplane could fall into spin… We didn’t have a parachute, so there was no way to bail out. When we landed, I asked him:\n\n– Why you flew so slowly?\n\n– Didn’t you see that there was an airplane ahead?\n\nHe waited another airplane to clear his path, as if it was a carriage! He was so uneducated. He used to call himself “We”. But he was smart, studied easily. During the first couple of lessons everybody was amazed how could he make it through to aviation in the first place. Head of naval tactics course, Captain First Rank ordered:\n\n– Cadet Tatarinov, bring airplane models from laboratory.\n\nHe walked away. We listened to the lecture. We saw that he is hauling the models like a pile of wood logs. The instructor almost fainted, when he saw that.\n\n– Cadet Tatarinov, where are you from?\n\n– We are from Gryazi, not far from Lipetsk (Gryaz' sounds like dirt in Russian).\n\n– I see, now it is clear that you are from there!\n\nBut he easily understood everything we learned. Later he became a big boss.\n\nStarshina Alexandr Gorbachev was a gunner-radio operator in the crew of Narkom Nikolai Kuznetsov {5}, radioman in the number 1 crew of the Fleet. Then he asked Narkom to send him to the flight school, to learn to fly.\n\nHe was drafted to the armed forces after he graduated from Moscow Physical Culture Institute, while studying there he participated in relays at Sadovyi Ring. He ran in sports shorts, passing a stick to another team member. When his mother found out that he ran through Moscow in underwear only, she was offended: \"What a shame!\"\n\nAlexander Gorbachev looked a lot like Mikhail Gorbachev. Long before Gorbachev appeared at political arena, Alexander told us that one of his relatives was guiding Komsomol at Kuban.\n\nAlexander was sent to Northern Fleet. By the way, his second wife was a widow of Twice HSU Safonov, who also fought there. She died before he did, so we both arranged a permission to bury Yevgenia Safonova at Kuzminskoye Cemetery. He was also buried there shortly after.\n\nGorbachev was in a dive-bomber regiment, made several sorties. Then he was sent to the Black Sea fleet. He had his way of understanding business. It was advantageous to exchange Romanian currency for the Soviet one. They exchanged all the money and bought a case of stockings. They flew to Odessa and arranged for a sale of this box at the flea-market. Later in the regiment they all spent tons of money for drinks.\n\nLater he was sent to the Baltic Fleet. There he also made several missions. He was awarded with the Order of Red Banner. Then he was sent to Polar Aviation, flew with Mazuruk {6}. It was the only General, who never commanded a combat unit, he was a Deputy of the Supreme Soviet, and still he personally made over 200 landings on ice. Alexander told us that they had all the money they would need. They were paid for distance flown, cargo weight, distance flown without landings, flights in dark and complex weather condition. But Mazuruk kept reminding his subordinates: \"Greed kills”. In aviation he was everybody’s darling, twice he was in charge of flights to the North Pole.\n\nAlexander later got sick. He used to live at Sokol in Moscow. He was a chain smoker and died. He had a lung cancer, but he refused to receive treatment.\n\nI met Medyankin at the field airbase. I landed then on the nearby airfield to load bombs before combat mission. There were no bombs at our base as logistics units didn’t bring them. Suddenly I met Alexei Medyankin. I told him, after my return I’ll talk to you, share combat experience. But after bombing I received a radio ordering to return to our base, bombs finally arrived. Alexei was killed in the first sortie {7}.\n\nOur group Starshina Gnetov led three torpedo bombers at the Northern Fleet. They all were on fire, but still were trying to drop their load on target. Petr Gnetov’s flight dropped torpedoes, but burned alive. The entire flight perished. But that is war. {8}\n\nWorld is a small and cramped place. Our 35th ShAP {9} was covered by the 12th IAP. The 7th Guards ShAP from our division was covered by the 14th GvIAP, its commander was Mironenko. He was from my village. We were born at the same field.\n\nIvan Romanenko, who later became a General, was the first to shot down Finnish airplane over Finnish airfield. But when he was little, my uncle treated him – he was a Chief Doctor of Lokhvitsa region.\n\n– Let’s return to SB training…\n\nDeputy Commander of the school Regimental Commissar Prolygin arrived. War in Poland was going all the way by now, newspapers wrote – \"friendship and help for Germany\". And Regimental Commissar told us at the meeting:\n\n– We have to study hard, to lift the fascist spider net on our red-starred wing. No peace with Germany!\n\nHe told the truth. Then the 22nd June came…\n\nI’ll remind you, that our school of naval pilots was the only military school that Hitler mentioned in his speeches. He called it a “hornets nest\".\n\nOur special services had caught one German female agent. She had a list of 138 people from our school with photos and characteristics. Hitler was right to be afraid of us: Naval pilots were the first to bomb Berlin.\n\n– What June 22 looked like? What happened then?\n\nIt was a rainy day. We were not flying; everybody was sitting in the tents… Somebody had decided to have lessons in the tents. Only after dinner at Simonovka airfield we were told about the war. Before that we read articles in the “Red Star” (Soviet central military newspaper) about future air war by General-Lieutenant Rychagov, Hero of Spain and China.\n\nWar. And everything changed instantly. Cadets were sent to the fields, to look if somebody not local would appear. We began to drag airplanes around the airfield, masking them with camouflage nets; we dug trenches under landing gear, so that shadow would not give airplanes position out. Such measures, unluckily, were common only for naval aviation. But nothing like this was done in the Army aviation during first days of the war. Just think: During the first two weeks of the war, Baltic Fleet aviation, which had 700 airplanes including 190 flying boats, had not a single one damaged or destroyed by the enemy on the ground! How many airplanes Army aviation lost in the first hours of the war at the airfields?! 1200-1400…\n\nWe were sitting in the corn with rifles, looking at the stars in the sky. When some sound would reach us, we would think that it was a sound of the enemy airplane armada. The mood was not good. Then, on the second or third day a fighter with red stars had flown over the field with an unspeakable speed, very aerodynamic. It flew at tree-top level, than again and disappeared in the sky. No one had seen a plane with such a speed. It was a LaGG-3 fighter. Good plane, but heavy on controls. Its production ended later; instead of it Yaks were put into production. Those were great airplanes. La-5s were even better.\n\nWe began to flee from the Germans. Instructors flew on the planes, while we travelled by train through Stalingrad. I was impressed how long this town was; it stretched over 70 kilometers along Volga River. We crossed Volga, and went north, towards Saratov. There forests had begun. And extreme poverty. At each train stop there were 3-3 old women selling cucumbers, cole slaw. They were all very sad.\n\nWe reached Samara airfield. Then it was Kuibyshev. There were aviation plants in Samara. Sturmoviks were manufactured there. In Chapaevsk there was a huge training center.\n\nFrom there it was a railroad to Syzran. There was a train station Bezenchuk, Simonov and Bezenchuk airfields.\n\nA German plane flew over. It was a lot of noise. A lot of efforts expended to dig cover.\n\nLater battles near Moscow had begun and the temperature fell. Outside temperature near Kuibyshev had fallen to -40 degrees Celsius. Guardsmen, who were guarding airplanes, had to be changed every 20-30 minutes. Fur overcoat and flight gear, fur lined pants, jacket, and hat. The frost was terrible.\n\nThere was one case. An airplane had landed at our airfield. With bombs under it. What’s going on?! Our long-range bomber took off to bomb the enemy, but got lost due to bad weather and ended up near Samara.\n\nOur instructors were accomplishing special missions. Suddenly several SB airplanes would fly away. Secret mission, no one knew anything. They would return 10-12 days later. Wind-bitten faces, it was clearly visible – they had to fly a lot. Pilots told us, that they had to load rockets for Katyshas and carry them to Stalingrad. They told us horrible things: they had to land on the fields, where airplanes jumped on frozen dead bodies. They unloaded their cargo and flew away.\n\nThe 7th squadron was organized, and we again were sent to Levanevskii School – to prepare crews, so that a navigator and a pilot would fly in one crew. Once I was making a usual flight, training in turns. Suddenly, another plane approached me, waves its wings, showing \"move away\". There was no radio. I understood nothing. Others also show me to get lost. I carefully moved aside… Airplane that looked exactly like mine except for oval windows flew past me. I landed, reported how it was. Do you know who it was? Voroshilov came to command a parade in Kuibyshev! Stalin was in Moscow. It was also a parade in Kuibyshev.\n\nAnd how we confused foreign Ambassadors that assembled in Kuibyshev! At the largest Simonovskii airfield all airplanes that could be found were assembled, even UT-2 and R-10, that were about to be written off; SBs, almost 400 airplanes. All were lined up. We had a task: take off, fly air parade over Samara, beyond visual range we were supposed to change formation and fly over Samara again. All was well coordinated.\n\nIl-2 sturmoviks appeared later. They were produced nearby, in Samara. Part of cadets was sent to train in them. In our 7th squadron there were 40 cadets. At first we lived in tents. I was appointed as a senior (Starshina) of the group. I had to walk my group to the airfield in full fur outfits for 7 kilometers. At the front I placed two laziest guys: Boris, forgot his surname, and Leonid Kapustin. Otherwise they would fall back and freeze.\n\nMany things were happening there… For example, I’m sleeping. Somebody is waking me:\n\n– Comrade Starshina, maybe we should get up!\n\n– Why? What’s happening?\n\n– Tent next to ours is on fire.\n\nTechnicians’ tent was burning. They got a lot of coal, made a lot of heat. As the coal was burning it formed sooth, an explosion went off. It blew up in an instance. One technician was killed. He wanted to hide on the floor, but suffocated to death.\n\nAnother miracle was when a full suitcase of money was found. There was a court martial.\n\n1942 was about to end. Strange thing happened: all pilots were graduated as sergeants. Good soldier would go to platoon commander courses, and half a year later he would become a lieutenant. We studied a full 3 year course. We completed full course, in a bit less than 3 years.\n\nI talked to the Army pilots. They sometimes had one training flight in Il, when they were sent to the front. Before I got there, I got 24 training bomb runs in Il-2.\n\n– Before the war there was a slogan: \"War on enemy’s territory with little blood\". Now we were losing territory and people. How was the mood?\n\nIn Stalin’s school we thought that even if we are retreating now, we will crush them later…\n\n19 graduates from our VMAU were sent to the 35th regiment, which begun its combat way from Kamenka airfield near Komendantskii Aerodrome on 22nd June 1943. When this airfield was built, The Germans haven’t located it… Absolutely unexpectedly for them a fully equipped regiment appeared on this airbase.\n\nInstead of gunners we had navigators, who finished navigators’ school. Pilots received a rank of Jr. Lieutenant, while gunners remained sergeants. To be exact, pilots graduated as sergeants, but immediately after we arrived to the front we received officer’s rank. Gunners remained with the rank they received after graduation. Some gunners did not receive any rank at all. For example, Petr Repin died at a rank of senior seaman. He made an excellent photo. There you could see German Ju-88s burning on the ground... He made it from the air… {10}\n\nThis photo made to all major newspapers of Soviet Union. Group was lead by major Hrolenko, the 7th GvSHAP commander. During that mission our sturmoviks shot down one enemy airplane on take-off. Petr had no idea how good the photo was. He perished a few missions later. As a Senior Seaman… Not even a sergeant. He was born in Red Holm, that’s in Kalininskaya Oblast.\n\nRight before we begun actively participate in fighting, squadron commanders came to the regiment. Our commander was Captain Potapov. In an army outfit, he had a Red Banner and Patriotic War Orders. There were no shoulder boards yet, we got them later.\n\nSuddenly, an order came for a combat sortie. Six or eight planes took off under command of Captain Potapov and headed towards Leningrad.\n\nBoys came back, I knew them all from the flight school, so I asked them:\n\n— So, how does war look like? Did they shoot at you?\n\nAnd the guys are mumbling something with confusion. No precise answer. Well, they don't talk, so be it. But it felt strange.\n\nWe transferred to Kamenka airfield. Here we were given naval uniform and shoulder boards. We were also issued TT pistols. Someone shot to the ground from TT, he didn't know how to use it properly. Later there were similar cases with personal weapons…\n\nHere we found out that they flew to strafe Gorodets airfield, where according to partisan data a lot of German attack planes were gathered, perhaps, a strike against Leningrad was planned. But there were marshes nearby, and mist had formed over general area, so they couldn’t locate the airfield. That’s why they didn’t tell us anything. The partisans were offended. They risked their lives looking after this airfield while gathering reconnaissance information.\n\nThen there was a court martial. Captain was found not guilty; perhaps it was taken into consideration that there was a mist. Maybe he had something else behind, because he was relieved of command and sent to Black Sea Fleet as a pilot, where he later perished. {11}\n\nOn June 22 the regiment began flying combat missions. Groups with several airplanes in each flew to attack Sinyavino Heights. There, eight or ten kilometers south of Ladoga Lake, were artillery positions, almost without any camouflage.\n\nThe leader was Senior Lieutenant Stratilov. I was the last in formation. I flew, but the engine worked poorly, and I started to lose speed. Neva River was getting close, on the other bank were Germans. At this time I already couldn’t see the airplanes from my group. Speed kept falling, I could feel that aircraft is about to fall. I went down, there, near Berngardovka, was an airfield Priutino. Just after gunpowder warehouses I turned, speed was just above evolutionary, and I could have spinned easily. The Airfield was just a wooden strip on a swamp. I approached, extended landing gear, but I couldn’t correct glide path, there was not enough speed. I had experience, I flew a lot. I had 24 bomb run practice flights, plus shooting at ground target practice flights. Army pilots were told how a bomb should be aimed and dropped, maybe they made a single training flight and that was it — \"Out to the front! » It was completely different story in naval aviation; no one in the 35th regiment would let you into the sea until you learned enough. What’s the point to fly to the sea if you don’t know how to aim?\n\nAnd here I ran out of luck. I landed on wheels but am drifting from the strip to the swamp. What should I do? I retracted landing gear and skid on the belly to the bushes. I hit the bushes, hit some pole with the wing. I exit the plane and engaged in negotiation with some commanders. I was taken as a passenger in a Po-2 to Kamenskii airfield, where I received a new plane and an order to fly another sortie. Our commanders were experienced, and knew that if a pilot is left with his grim thoughts after a misfortune, he might lose confidence. He should be sent to the air as soon as possible.\n\nThe crew chief Ivan Kharlamov was standing at the plane. I, in distress, take my boots off and give them to him.\n\n— Take them!\n\nI took off with another group in dirty socks, and I was the last in formation once again. Pilots dove and fired rockets, cannons and machine guns at artillery sites. Explosions… everything was on fire. There was a lot of FLACK around us… Each pass we dropped one bomb… Four bombs. Third pass, fourth… All guns empty…\n\nWe returned to base. Ivan Kharlamov stands near the plane and holds my boots. I noticed a group of officers going towards me. In front I saw from a distance (my eye sight was good then, not like now) a tall naval officer in a large hat. I realized it was the Fleet Commander Tribuz. A bit behind him was Mikhail Ivanovich Samokhin, commander of Baltic Fleet Aviation. They came to me, and I reported:\n\n— Comrade Commander, Junior Lieutenant Batievskii accomplished the mission. Weapons and airplane worked fine.\n\nCommander shook my hand and said:\n\n— Comrade Junior Lieutenant, I congratulate you with accomplishing a mission. I wish you to fly and fight a lot, and have less of this.\n\nHe pointed at something behind my back. He turned around and marched away from me. I turned towards my airplane, and saw that stars on both wings were with holes about 15 centimeters each.\n\nDuring the second mission we drop one bomb on each pass again. Four passes, four attacks. After return I saw new holes in the wing stars. After the third mission I brought only one hole in the star. For the first 19 sorties I had approximately 35 passes.\n\nCommander Samokhin was told about my forced landing, that the pilot almost blew up in the plane: leafs and bush branches hit the detonator of RS, if they hit just a bit harder, there would be an explosion. After that he issued an order that before attempting forced landing a pilot should drop bombs and rockets to a safe place, for example, into the marshes.\n\n— Who flew reconaissance missions in your regiment?\n\nI can tell you a story, which I heard from Lidia Ivanovna Shulaikina {12}. She was a sturmovik pilot. She made 30 anti-shipping strikes. Those 30 flights were equal to 300 “night witches” missions they flew in a Po-2 at night, crossed front line, dropped a bomb and returned. Hanged another bomb, again flew 30 kilometers. Those girls were fantastic. They made over 700 sorties each. They really were fantastic. But they were not equal to 30 missions of Lida Shulaikina.\n\nGermans also had a female navy pilot. She flew in a four-engine flying boat, which was shot down. This flying boat sits on the bottom of the Northern Sea for dozens of years. It is cold there, so it almost didn’t suffer from rust. I saw similar flying boat in one of the fights. It came to collect their downed pilots from the sea.\n\nMy pilot Petr Miroshnichenko was shot up, he flew by my side and showed that he has no fuel left. He had no fuel even to turn towards shore line, he landed on water. I clearly saw his red life vest and inflatable boat. After I came home, I said:\n\n— Let me fly there, I’ll show to the rescue crew where he is …\n\nBut they replied:\n\n— No, you go get ready for another mission. Another crew will fly to the rescue in a flying boat.\n\nThose bastards didn’t find him. He was very close to the shore. If I would have flown with them, I would have located him. I’m very sorry that I didn’t insist. I remember how he hit ships with bombs two times. Petr Miroshnichenko. That's how it was. {13}\n\n— I’m interested in photoreconnaissance. Who flew with photo cameras in your regiment? How they were picked? Or were they special crews?\n\nNo. Everybody flew with photo cameras. I also flew. In 35th regiment it was a mess. One pilot had almost 100 photo recon missions. But there is not a single photo in the 3rd squadron archive. A hundred missions and not a single photo!\n\nIn my opinion, cameras were placed incorrectly in the Il. If you want to make a photo of a target you have to cover it by the nose of the airplane. The idea was to make photo where the bomb will fall. But it was incorrect – you made a photo of a place that will be hit only if there was no wind. You will have a ship in the crosshair, but the bomb will deviate to the side. You will have a photo of a target, but without a hit. No matter how many times you take a picture, it will be useless anyways.\n\nIt was usually the last one in the formation who flew with the camera. I got burnet on it. I decided to gain altitude a bit, to make a better photo. I saw falling bombs, their explosions. I gained altitude, but speed dropped a bit, AAA — «bam», and a large piece of my wing was torn away.\n\nSo, here we have: wing is full of holes that I could see the sea below, fragments pearced my hand, I’m bleeding… I immediately got stunned, but somehow managed to bring the plane to a horizontal flight… As Fedor Seleznev told me later, my airplane at this moment was attacked by German fighter. Germans were practicing this… «Good» tactics. If they saw a damaged airplane, they would try to bring it down. It’s easier to shoot a damaged plane than a fully operational one. It is more dangerous to attack combat worthy machine. A burst from Messerschmitt hit me and I was wounded by fragments into head, hands and legs. I still carry over twenty fragments in my body. I told one doctor that I have numerous fragments in my body. He replied that this is nothing. If it would penetrate my skull and hit some nerve, than it would count. Well, you see what I mean.\n\nMy one eye couldn’t see — the fragment was sticking out of my eyebrow. But I noticed that frontline was below me. I had speed, and I descended. There were wires on the poles, I jumped over them, and saw a marsh, that looked like a horizontal surface. I landed at this seemingly level surface but the airplane’s tail section was caught in the bushes and was torned out. The rest of the airplane got into a ditch. It looked like a horizontal surface, but it was a marsh covered by water. Under its surface there was a huge crater. The engine smashed into craters wall with such a force, that all cabin was deformed. The canopy would not open. In such moments you do everything automatically: I thought that plane is about to catch fire and blow up. I sporadically pushed my legs, but one of them was wounded. I managed to escape through a little window.\n\nAfter I got well I tried several times to repeat this move, but there was no way to do it. But on another occasion when I also crashed and couldn’t open the canopy, I got out of the plane through the little window again…\n\nI got out, there should be pain in the wounded legs, but I did not feel it, my head was spinning, there was severe weakness, it felt like I was going to fall. My gunner Ivan came to me, his overalls was covered with blood — he was wounded in the leg. He missed enemy fighters attack, didn’t even fire at him. I trained him a lot, but he had a bad sight and wasn’t too bright too. Ivan was holding me and here some scared soldiers appeared from the bushes, helped me and carried me somewhere. The tent, where surgeons were waiting for me, shook from mortar shells explosions. Germans were shelling the tail of my airplane, which was about 50 meters away from the main wreck… Medics undressed me:\n\n— We are going to operate, do you understand? Drink a glass of vodka.\n\nThey gave me a glass of vodka, I drank it. They put a mask on me and as I was falling asleep I heard them saying that such an Apollo had been damaged…\n\nI weighted 55 kilograms with a height 175 centimeters. I woke up completely bandaged. I could hardly understand where I am, who I am, and what happened to me… There was someone on duty. I talked to him and he replied:\n\n— Do not worry; we are going to evacuate you…\n\nAnd the soldiers carried me across the swamp. Nearby was a Ladozhskii canal, there was a boat. A Colonel in aviation uniform said:\n\n— Do not worry, everything is fine, you are going to live, maybe you will fly again...\n\nAnd the boat departed. Later there was some railway freight cars, some train. They brought me to the hospital and cheered me:\n\n— We are going to treat you. Don’t worry.\n\nHere I grabbed my pants, but my wallet was gone. There were no money there, but a medal “for defense of Leningrad” and a large fragment that in one of the previous flights flew into my cabin and struck the sole of my boot. It was even hot then. I took it as a souvenir… Now it was gone with a medal…\n\nI was undergoing treatment. It was very painful when bandages were torn from tissue. I was treated for over a month…\n\n— Where was that hospital?\n\nIt was in the village Myslino, Novgorodskaya oblast, South-east of Leningrad. As heavily wounded I was sent there… My gunner was sent to the hospital in Leningrad.\n\nMy treatment was over. I had to go to the front, it was time to fight. It was the beginning of autumn, it was getting cold. Upon discharge from the hospital I received a soldiers overcoat, burnt and with holes from fragments or bullets. I put it over my blouse, which was also pierced in the area of sleeves and shoulder boards.\n\nWe came to Leningrad in a polutorka (GAZ-AA truck, 1.5 ton) at night, through a marsh by a road built from wood trunks. Shells exploded sometimes… We stopped:\n\n— You must be a pilot. Rest there, but don’t try anything funny.\n\nWhat they thought of as funny? I came into a warm room, there was a girl sleeping there. Who was she? Where did she come from? The guys were watching how I would react at this girl. Old guys, with mustache. Several times during night they came in to look, and each time I woke up… In the morning we went to the city.\n\nAt the doors of the building I came to I found a note: «Company of officers’ reserve of the Leningrad Front».\n\n— Pilot, it’s your turn.\n\nI went in.\n\n— Give us your documents.\n\nI gave them certificate that I was wounded and my pilot's license that I got from the flight school. There was some other document, which I don’t remember. A Colonel said:\n\n— According to your report you flew 19 combat missions. We are in need of such pilots. This is why tomorrow we are sending you to the Army regiment.\n\nTo the other regiment? In the Army, not the Navy? Even though in Leningrad, but still… I exited the building, there was a sentry guard at the doors, but he turned to the other side. I ran out of the door... Where should I run? What I’m risking? No idea. I turned around the corner – it was a patrol but also facing back and going in the opposite direction. I turned around another corner. I flew a lot over Leningrad, so I had an idea where to go…\n\nHere is another story. I was ordered to take a regiment adjutant and regiment commissar in a Po-2 and fly to Priyutino. I boarded two huge males into the Po-2 cockpit and took off. Suddenly, over Leningrad: \"Pfff\", and one cylinder of the engine stopped working, I could clearly see it. There were 5 cylinders and I could see that one of the valves is not working. And airplane begun to fall. This plane was not designed to carry two passengers. I flew right over roof tops, and made it on the prayers.\n\nIt was some plane on the runway and there was no way for me to land. I begun making an approach to the meadow, but there was a crowd standing. Why did they stand there? I switched the engine off, propeller stopped and I rose from my seat and shouted:\n\n— Run away! Get out of here!\n\nThey looked at me and ran away. It appeared that regiment commanders airplane was standing there nose up, an explosion had ripped a tail section from the rest of the plane. A bomb stuck in the bomb bay. We hanged four AO-25 bombs into each bomb bay. That gave 400 kilos of bomb load. Colonel Petrov flew a mission with regiment navigator Konstantin Vinogradov, and one bomb got stuck. He landed at that same Priyutino, where I almost blew up.\n\nSo, that’s why I had to bring adjutant and commissar here! The Commissar, such a bastard, never even boarded a combat plane. But he was promoted to a Major and even was awarded with some Order.\n\nIf you will ever be in Gatchina archive, look for the personnel files of Captain Podstavkin, deputy commander of the 35th Regiment for political affairs and Major Malovichok, who later assumed this position. Both were pilots who flew a Po-2 before. Both files have such words:… \"Extremely eager to fight an enemy at our and their territory\" — I tell it in my words — \"…currently studies airplane construction and weapons\". But none of them made a single flight… Think for yourself, he’s either an idiot, since he couldn’t understand how an airplane works, or that’s how he wanted to fight…\n\nWhat happened on that runway was: on landing a bomb exploded. The Colonel didn’t suffer as he had armored backrest behind him and armor around the cockpit, but his gunner… His gunner for the mission was Captain Konstantin Vinogradov, a handsome guy, who begun war duty in the Mine-Torpedo regiment. He already had two Red Banner Orders. Two! His chest was pierced by two fragments. He was sent to the hospital and I never saw him again. But I will always remember him. He was a good lad, with a great sense of humor, which is grossly valued by pilots. His jokes helped to keep the morale up. For example, as a regiment navigator he had to test navigation readiness of all pilots. To pass the test you had to know: area of flight, map, location and quality of the airfields, directions from the high command. After checking our knowledge he asked main question:\n\n— Comrade Junior Lieutenant, which qualities should naval pilots have?\n\nCorrect answer should be something like this:\n\n— Main requirements for the naval aviator should be good night sleep, wolf's appetite, total disgust to physical labor and partial to mental labor too.\n\nAnd we lost such a friend!\n\nOur commissars haven’t flown a single mission. But Colonel Serbin, Baltic Fleet aviation commissar, flew at night, right through our AAA shells explosions, which fired at enemy bombers when they tried to bomb Kronstadt. He attacked enemy planes caught by searchlights. He showed an example. Nor did he only fight better than others, he came to our airfield Kerstovo in summer 1944. It was hot, but we flew 2-3 times a day. There were no conditions for rest there, so we had to arrange everything ourselves. Commissar of the Baltic Fleet Aviation came to me and asked:\n\n— You made a shower? Show it to me!\n\nI showed him what we did: we installed a tank, painted it in black, installed two grids to make showerheads and it was suitable for two people to take a shower. He said:\n\n— Very good example for everybody. I’m going to overfly other airfields, so that they will make showers like yours.\n\nAnd he flew himself. I’ve heard a lot of good things about him.\n\nLet's get back to the story of my return after injury. The 35th regiment by this time was based at a Gora-Valday airfield, which was located near Gora-Valday Lake, just a few kilometers away from Shepelev lighthouse. That’s Oranienbaum bridgehead. It was completely surrounded. There was another airfield there – Borki, near Lebyazhye village. The Germans knew its location. 7th Guards regiment was stationed there. Our regiment arrived to the bridgehead and the German were unable to locate it. Why? Because at winter, for example, after planes took off, fur-trees were dragged on a sleigh to the runway. They looked like a dispersed forest. Once planes would return, trees would be dragged to the sides, planes landed; trees were placed back on the runway. It was a forest once again.\n\nPreflight briefing, Gora-Valdai AB, 1944. Note yellow life jackets. Eeach plane had a LAS-1 inflatable boat too under the pilot's seat.\n\n— At Gora-Valday Lake the 44th squadron equipped with MBR-2 was based.\n\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n— Did you see it there?\n\nNo.\n\n— A veteran, who was in a sentry company of the 44th squadron told us that this lake during winter was used as an airfield for U-2 female squadron. Have you heard anything about it?\n\nU-2? No. Haven’t heard. There was another interesting thing. There used to be a forward HQ of Baltic Fleet Aviation. Near the airfield, closer to the lake…\n\nI came back to the regiment and the boys greeted me, because I was the regiment’s veteran who fought from the first days of the regiment’s active service. By this time my first wingman, little Kuznetsov had perished.{14} I remember, we were given a task to fly a two-ship formation to Sinyavinskie heights. I took off as a leader; we came home, landed at Gora-Valday. His airplane was torn by AAA shell fragments, while there was not a single hole in my plane… I asked:\n\n— You flew with me? How come your plane is torn by fragments, while mine is untouched?\n\nHe was almost crying:\n\n— You flew above thin cloud layer, I saw your shadow over me, but was afraid to fly in the clouds.\n\nHe flew lower. Thus he was clearly visible - a perfect target.\n\nTime passed. I once returned from a mission to the home base. My friends met me, and gave me a letter that came to my late wingman Kuznetsov. His brother wrote: «Dear brother, I’m proud of you. Excuse me if you can, do you remember, we were playing chess and begun fist-fighting…» and so on…\n\nYou know, I burst in tears, I felt so sorry for Kuznetsov. That’s how strange it was, strange, strange…\n\n— You didn’t tell us how you made it to the regiment after the hospital. If I remember correctly to get to Oranienbaum you had to get to Kronstadt first, then by ship to the bridgehead.\n\nNot necessarily. I was taken there by “corn hopper” (U-2). When it landed and I got out, everybody shouted:\n\n— Hurray! You are alive!...\n\nBut I was telling how I escaped from the “Company of Officers’ Reserve”… I flew above town, and generally knew where Grazhdanka airfield was. At Grazhdanka there was some aviation HQ and the 12th Dive-bomber regiment was stationed there. I walked around all patrols, gray overcoat camouflaged me, and everything was quiet. I came to this HQ, a door opens and a Captain walked out, that same one who greeted me in the personnel department. He looked pale and kahectic now. And he remembered me. I told him what happened to me.\n\n— We thought that you are killed. Take a stamp for food and rush to the canteen because it’s about to close. Have something to eat and then we will talk.\n\nI was really hungry, almost complete day without food. I ate and returned to him.\n\n— Listen; there is a truck about to depart to Berngardovka-Priyutino. There is a sanitarium for wounded, stay there for a couple of weeks. Go on…\n\nThe truck arrived; he stopped it and asked to drop me off at Berngardovka. It was that same Priyutino, where I almost crashed and where the regiment commander’s aircraft blew up. When I came, there were dances in the club. The music was like this: somebody was playing a violin and trumpet, while drums went «boom-boom-boom, troom-boom-boom…» I said:\n\n— What’s that?\n\n— That’s tango “Kotka”.\n\nOver Kotka port there was heavy AAA fire. «Boom-boom-boom» resembled shell explosions… We danced there. There I met that same Fedor Seleznev, who didn’t notice how I was attacked, there were guys from the mine-torpedo regiment. But there were very few fighter pilots. There also was a gunner from our regiment, his body was full of shell fragments — Vassiliy Pesozkii. I met him after the war. He became a school director…\n\nAfter that I made it to my home regiment and to our new airbase. Then the liberation of Leningrad began.\n\nJanuary 14th 1944. Misty morning. Then, suddenly, a fierce artillery fire commenced. Traces of huge, 12 inch shells were seen in the sky — artillery bombardment from Forts and ships. When large caliber shell flew you could see an inversion trail after it, sometimes you even saw how it flew and rotated.\n\nDuring the first days it was a blizzard. We were told that only our Division flew from all aviation. I might be exaggerating, maybe I do not know who else flew, but it looked like this. We haven’t seen anyone in the air.\n\nFrom January 14th we begun flying, on 15th, 16th, 17th and 18th we kept flying combat missions.\n\nBut right before this a strange thing happened. Right before the operation begun, our regiment commander disappeared. He wasn’t shot down or something, he was transferred to a new place… New regiment commander arrived — Dasha Ibragimovich Akaev, who was just promoted to the rank of a Major. Who and why kept him in the reserve till this moment is still not clear to me. But that was none of my business. He was walking around the airfield, getting to know the regimental affairs and so on.\n\n— I’m going to fly combat mission. You will be my wingman.\n\nYou ask why he chose me? I already had 19 sorties, knew how to fly… We took off.\n\nOranienbaum bridgehead is very small. I thought that he is going to either gain altitude or try to pass the frontline at low level. Battlefront was visible, because both sides used fir tree branches as a cover, two green lines 400 meters apart were clearly seen on the white snow. But the leader kept flying steadily at an altitude of 400 meters — best altitude for the enemy to aim at us. I flew behind him, wading the tail of my airplane. I clearly saw his gunner, I knew him.\n\nNot long before I landed at Borki airfield, the girls found out that I was from the 35th regiment and told me:\n\n— Our Captain Trohachev was transferred to your regiment. He is quite short, he usually puts a pillow under parachute to see more. Can you pass this pillow to him?\n\nRegiment engineer came to me, as if nothing happened between us yesterday, and said:\n\n— During the night we repaired your airplane, landing gear is fixed, and the wheel was not properly tightened. You also burned machine guns bores. We changed the bores and set the convergence. A German fighter is flying above, so you have to wait. Twenty minutes later you will have a chance to take off. Cheers!\n\nI must have burnt bores when I fired at enemy columns. As I pressed the trigger, I didn’t release it until the end. But our machine guns fired 30 rounds per second. I said:\n\n— Good.\n\nRegiment engineer liked to be in charged. He commanded as he pleased even after the war.\n\nBut the day before I landed on one wheel, and even drew my pistol at this engineer from the 7th Guards Regiment. Somebody from behind grabbed the pistol and took it away from me. It was a senior engineer of the VVS Baltic Fleet Colonel Gurevich, he later became a General. I called him not long time ago, he lives in Moscow. Congratulated him with festivities, thanked him for saving me from penal company or prison. If I would have hit him, I would be court martialed. He was a Captain while I was Junior Lieutenant.\n\n— But could you describe more precisely what happened?\n\nIt happened on January 18th 1944 when I received an order to seek out and attack in two ship formation by any enemy means of transportation on the road Volosovo-Narva. After we took off I got separated from my wingman due to heavy snowstorm. Trying to locate him I opened canopy, so it froze in the open position. What’s worse – I was unable to find my wingman. To make situation completely awful I found out that the right undercarriage leg is not working and sticks out into the wind stream. Still, there was no other option for me but to try and accomplish the mission. So I flew at airspeed of 320 km\\h, with an outside temperature - 18°?. Snow easily filled my cockpit, ice covered the instrument panel and I couldn’t feel my legs anymore. To be able to fly I had to clear most important gauges by fingers. This all seriously distracted me from keeping situational awareness at appropriate level.\n\nWhen I noticed first trucks it was already too late to attack. I begun turning to set an attack pattern, but first trucks had disappeared under the trees. I even became upset – the target escaped! But then I flew out of the clouds, and in front of me I found a long snake of infantry column. It was a gift from God!\n\nInfantry was not covered by AAA, soldiers had to fight strong wind blowing them into the faces, so they were not looking at the sky, and that same wind did not allow them to hear my engine. I simply pressed the trigger and saw blue traces disappearing in the column. When first soldiers disappeared under the nose of my Il I released bombs. That time my bomb bays were loaded with 16 AO-25 fragmentation bombs with a delay set for 5 seconds. I kept firing, but there was no end to this mass of infantry, so I fired all eight RSs. By this time I flew as low as tops of telegraph poles. I had to abort the attack.\n\nWhen I begun gaining altitude with a turn, my engine begun stalling, from the sides I could see the traces of awakened small caliber AAA.\n\nWith great caution I piloted my airplane by the shortest route to our airfield. The good point – my engine seemed to begin recovering, it sounded more and more stable, the bad one – German small caliber traces were getting closer and closer. As I got to the home base it was clear that there was no way for me to land on Gora-Valday – the right leg did not lock, so I would get dragged from the runway right into other planes parked along narrow airfield.\n\nBorki had a round appearance, so I had more freedom trying to land there. With lots of luck I landed safely. I tried to stand up, but couldn’t. Then I noticed some hands searching through the cockpit, and someone said:\n\n— You idiot! You forgot to lower landing gear as emergency procedure says. You crippled the plane!\n\nI wanted to say that airframe is not so seriously damaged, but then I suddenly was engulfed by undeserved insult.\n\nI took out my TT pistol, and tried to hit the source of the voice. Somebody grabbed my hand and took away my pistol. I was escorted to the HQ. There I ripped off the face mole mask. Usually it protected our faces from frost, but this time it froze to my skin, so I took the mask with bits of skin. I reported to the 7th regiment commander Major Karasev that I attacked the infantry column, that AAA cover lagged 800 meters behind, and that the weather was getting better. The Major asked me to show on the map where I caught the Germans, and ordered to prepare 9 Ils for the mission. Meanwhile somebody called the doctor, he checked me out, but there was nothing but mortal tiredness and little frostbites. The regiment commander ordered me to go to the canteen and then to rest.\n\nIn the canteen girls gave me 100 grams of vodka with pepper as a medicine against flu. As I ate, Ivan Bezhanov, a pilot I knew, told me that their engineer was not too keen on trying to send me to the court martial.\n\nWhen two girls guided me to the dug-out, where I was supposed to have some rest, they brought me to the newly-formed crater. As a passing by seaman described:\n\n— In this crater you can see all that remained from the German ace. Some time ago four FW-190 tried to strafe the airfield. An ace from the 14th Guards fighter regiment Konstantin Kovalev shot two of them down. One fell right there.\n\nIn the crater I saw man’s “device” with no trace of the rest of the body.\n\nIt was warm in the dug-out, but I was still shaking under heavy fur coat. Then I got all sweaty. For a long time I was unconscious. I woke up from poking:\n\n— Comrade Commander, the regiment engineer ordered to give this to you as a present... We recovered it from the cowling of the engine and from the wing of your plane.\n\nHowever sleepy I was, I still understood that he showed me pieces of soldiers’ overcoat, belt and one German shoulder board. But I was too tired to think about it and dozed off again.\n\nIn the morning I woke up as good as new. I carefully examined my “souvenirs” in the daylight. After breakfast I was told that my plane was ready, examined it and flew home. But I forgot the “souvenirs”.\n\nWhile I was resting after the flight thinking of the «trophies» that I left behind, I recalled events described in the brochure that I read in the flight school before being assigned to the Baltic’s. This brochure was about combat activities of the Black Sea aviation ground-attack pilot Captain Suslin who arrived to our flight school and spearheaded forming of our regiment. In Odessa area Suslin lowered his landing gear to pretend he is flying German Ju-87 and strafed a column of Romanian infantry. It became clear that it was Romanian infantry column only back at the airfield, where pieces of Romanian uniforms, a helmet and a scalp with hair were recovered from the wheel wells! At that time I did not believe that such an episode could be real. Any impact of the wheel creates a strong roll-over moment and the plane would be drawn to the ground. This is a 100% risk. But these bits were actually raised into the air by explosions of RSs, through which my plane flew.\n\nNow we are flying with Akaev with a task to strafe Klopitsy airfield. He flies at an altitude of 400 meters in a straight line. It was shocking but I maneuvered to avoid the AAA explosions...\n\n— Did you fly in pair?\n\nYes. There were no intense strikes at that time. Visibility was poor, shells exploded. I saw a lake south of Oranienbaum bridgehead, that’s a landmark, near there were Klopitsy. Klopitsy was one of 5 K’s: Klopitsy, Koporye, Kummolovo, Kerstovo, and Kotly.\n\nHe flew, crossed the frontline, and begun gaining altitude. I followed him. He reached Klopitsy. The road was rolled in the snow, it was sparkling and you could see everything. The AAA fired at us. But my leader didn’t see it. I saw explosions but he didn’t.\n\nI noticed that the road lead to snow piles that looked like camouflaged airplanes. I aimed there, fired, and observed that the snow moved and some airplanes clearly became visible. My leader must have seen them, but he kept flying above in circles, while the Germans kept firing at us with their automatic cannons. I couldn’t understand what he was doing. He didn’t guide me to the AAA sites, so I couldn’t fire at them because I couldn’t leave him alone. If I would attack, the regiment commander could be far away. So I followed him. I dove down and then gained altitude back. Meanwhile he kept firing who knows where. We returned to the base, landed and I came to report.\n\n— Comrade Major, combat mission accomplished, weapons and airplane worked fine.\n\n— Good boy, we showed them! We showed them good!\n\nWhat the hell! Here comes the Major, Chief of Staff who fought from the start of the war as a navigator. The regiment commander did not allow me to leave, so I had to stay by his side. Two technicians came:\n\n— Comrade Major, your airplane’s engine was hit by AAA shell.\n\nDasha Ibragimovich Akaev looked at them.\n\n— What shell?\n\nHe went pale. I stand near him – he forgot to allow me to leave. He lacked military discipline. I followed him. The shell hit his airplane right into the engine, but very luckily. Idiots are lucky. It hit right into the spot where two pieces of armor overlap, that is, armor there was twice as thick. Two centimeters to the sides, and the engine would be smashed to pieces. Oil would pour out of the engine, and he would have to stay on the other side of the frontline.\n\nThey brought him a glass of vodka, he emptied it and left. I never flew with him again.\n\n— Could you tell us about unsuccessful strike against Rakkvere?\n\nIt was a black day for the regiment. What happened over Rakkvere I do not know – I did not take off. On take off a propeller blade dismantled.\n\nOn February 26th Akaev lead a group to strafe the airfield. No one came back, but Petr Maksyuta…\n\nAirfield Koporye. Snow was falling. There were no bulldozers, and a tractor dragged rail tracks to level the snow so that we could take off. The regiment commander Akaev decided to lead the formation personally... All regiment commanding officers were there.\n\nMajor Kashtankin, who just arrived to the regiment and was appointed as a ground control officer almost got me killed. We begun taking off. As a flight commander I was leading the last pair. I gave full throttle, but the engine had no power, it shook severely. There was not enough runway length, and even worse – at the end of the runway there was a snow pile. The ground control officer commanded me to take off.\n\nI turned around for second attempt. No luck this time too. My gunner told me that a part of his machine gun fell off from heavy vibration.\n\nDuring the fourth attempt the ground control officer still commanded to take off!\n\nHe was slapping on his pistol and showing me his fist. He was a pilot, and he must have heard that engine was shaking. But he just arrived to the front, he wanted to prove his worthiness. \"Take off\". That was his attitude towards me.\n\nMaybe he was a good man, somewhere, somehow. But I insulted him a day before. I test flew the plane, but one wheel did not extend. I maneuvered, flew high Gs, tried to release it with an emergency winch — 27,5 rotations. Nothing helped. So I landed on one wheel. I did it before. I always landed perfectly. Switched engine off, shut off fuel lines. Airplane banked after landing…\n\nThen, suddenly, somebody gets into the cockpit without my permission and fiddles with landing gear controls. He might have done something with controls, and then I’ll have no proof that I did everything right. He had no rights to do so! Of course, I chased him away. I didn’t know that he was appointed as a deputy regiment commander. I was a Lieutenant, he was a Major, but I still chased him away. How could he get into the cockpit without pilot's permission!\n\n— What are you doing here?\n\nHe was silently breathing. I chased him away and he rolled down the wing. It appeared he was newly appointed deputy regiment commander for flying. He just arrive a day or two before from the Far East. I did not know who he was but who the hell he was to get inside and mess with the cockpit. There would be no problem if an engineer would look into the cockpit.\n\nAnd he did not forget this and being a flight control officer he is threatening me with a pistol! I was ready to take off, even though I knew that I could hit the snow pile, rockets may explode, I can overturn. Fuel line may get ruptured and fuel may ignite. I clearly imagine all these scenarios… Kashtankin slams on his pistol and yells. Then, right in front of an airplane the regiment engineer Mikhail Milentyev appeared. He graduated from the Aviation Institute; he got a higher education, an experienced engineer. He said to me:\n\n— Press brakes and throttle up.\n\nThe engine is revving. I throttled, he showed me a “cross” and “taxi to parking”. He’s an engineer, he orders me and I understand that it is dangerous. I began to understand, that that fool got insulted for what happened the day before. The day before, not a month. It was still fresh. Up until 1944 he sat at Far East…\n\nI taxi, the engine is vibrating heavily, but works. The propeller is spinning. They were arguing when I looked back. Mikhail Milentyev shows something to him. Kashtankin swore at us:\n\n— What have you done? He must be in the air now…\n\nI left the cockpit with my helm on and without disconnecting my communication cable. And at this moment I heard over radio… I’m not making it up, I would never even think about something so stupid. I heard Akaev saying:\n\n— Forward to the West, not a step to the East!\n\nEight or six airplanes flew. I can’t remember exactly now…\n\nMeanwhile I got off the plane and walked to the propeller. One propeller blade was loose, hanging. I took it in my hands, made three and a half revolutions, and it got separated... aluminum blade was not heavy, I put it on the ground, sat on it, and smoked a cigarette. So I sat… My wingman also made four attempts to take off. He had a normal engine, but he played chicken… That’s how it was.\n\nThere was a scandal, commanders and political department understood that a pilot could have perished on take-off. Major Kashtankin was transferred to the 7th GvShAP, where on an anti-shipping strike mission he was shot down and rammed into the enemy ship. He was awarded HSU posthumously. That’s life, there are no saints among us and everybody had their shortcomings.\n\nBack to the story of Rakkvere airfield strike. Situation was euphoric, everyone was happy. We just successfully deblocked Leningrad, we felt like we could do anything now. That’s my opinion.\n\nA couple of hours previously six planes flew there under command of my friend Petr Maksyuta, but they returned. They all returned. The weather was bad: heavy clouds despite winter. They couldn’t make it through those clouds to the Rakkvere airfield. There were 40 new FWs based at Rakkvere, their pilots were mostly graduates from Berlin School of Air Snipers.\n\nThey intercepted our second group, I’ve been told that all fighters were in the air and expected our Ils.\n\nAkaev took Squadron commander Major Reutov on his wing. They took off, but only Maksyuta came back. No one else returned. Regiment leadership was all gone. I’ve been told later that Major Reutov survived. And Vladimir, a Georgian, flight commander, forgot his surname now, returned from the POW camp. I met with him, we sat at my apartment in Moscow, he almost cried when he recalled how he was captured, how they ran in snow, how Estonian fascists were chasing them. The navigator tried to shoot them with pistol, but what is that pistol… They shot the navigator. Vladimir was captured in some barn. He was crying when he told me this story. We wrote letters to each other later.\n\npilot Vladimir Davitashvili\n\nBut it is unknown how the fight was going on. It’s my opinion, but I’m not an eye witness that clouds didn’t allow gunners and pilots to protect each other. The Germans were over their airfield…\n\nI’m not sure, if the squadron commander Balitskii’s Jewish crew returned. He was an older man with grey hair and he did not look like a Jew.\n\nLater, when they returned from the POW camp, they told us how they managed to fool the Germans:\n\n— I’m Russian, can’t you see that my nose, it is ponting up.\n\n— And who are you?\n\n— Can’t you see that I have an Armenian nose — I’m Armenian.\n\nThey got away with this. {16}\n\nKashtankin\n\n— We came to breaching of blockade with you. What was next?\n\nThen war continued. We moved to Koporye. We walked to the fortress, looked at its thick walls, huge round tower. Germans left a lot of traces — empty bottles, garbage, crap… we walked and looked, when one pilot, older then me, approached:\n\n— Are you Batya?\n\nI said:\n\n— Yes.\n\n— Listen, I’ve been appointed as first squadron commander, — the previous one had perished. Would you like to be my deputy?\n\n— Why not, yes, I would like. What I should do?\n\n— I’m going to the HQ now to report that you are my deputy. You should accept new pilots instead of me. Six or seven pilots came from the Far East. Junior Lieutenants, all graduates from Bataisk, you will find them. Show them their trunks.\n\nI came and the guys are standing in overcoats, hats, naval uniform with boots. All had suitcases. I said:\n\n— Listen, boys. Congratulations with arrival to the frontline, and wish you success. You will be in our squadron. Now to the business. Squadron commander Senior Lieutenant Tretyakov ordered me to billet you in housing for flight personnel. Let’s go. Comrade Lieutenant, lead your team.\n\nLieutenant — young boy with blue eyes, short. We entered the room.\n\n— Three days ago this trunk was occupied by Senior Lieutenant, flight commander. Now it’s empty. Now you, please. You will be next to the window. Its owner used to be flight navigator, he perished three days ago.\n\nI mentioned all who were killed this way… Tretyakov came:\n\n— What have you done? You frightened them! I hoped you will do it right.\n\nAt first I felt uncomfortable, but then it passed…\n\nTretyakov said:\n\n— You are good at naval tactics, I’m not, and I used to be a civilian pilot. — I think he was pretending that he was not that good. Tell them about force comparison. Something about your own experience. About your first, second and third missions. How you fly up there. Go on, execute.\n\nThat was his order. So I told them everything my commander asked about.\n\n— …I made a mistake, I flew behind main formation with a camera, tried to gain altitude, lost speed, while I should have maneuvered. You always have extra speed, guys. My speed was only 270 kilometers per hour. Economic. I should have flown faster if a fighter would approach from behind. If you will fly too fast, you will overrun all other airplanes. Thus you have to maneuver and increase intervals. Then you will always have speed and possibility to joint tighter formation. Remember my grieve experience…\n\nIt happened that Tretyakov stood behind me:\n\n— Fine, well done. Keep up good work.\n\nIn a day or two we already flew combat missions to the open sea. There still was ice floating, but mine laying ships there, we knew them by the form of the stern. I flew and lost two in one flight. They landed on ice and before my eyes sunk. Flights were going on, but commanders preserved me for some mission. Meanwhile young pilots that came from the Pacific had to fly. They flew out, came back, that blue eyed one reports to me:\n\n— Comrade Lieutenant, I report. A German fighter appeared in front of me, I pressed a trigger of 37 mm cannons and it fell apart…\n\n— Great, comrade Lieutenant, I congratulate you. You will tell everybody how it happened during debriefing.\n\nThat’s what I told him. He was so happy, his eyes were shining. But at this same moment I thought that I did something wrong. It’s nonsense. Who gave a young pilot such a heavy airplane? It was difficult to fly it, 320 kilograms of extra weight…{17}\n\nBeing a deputy squadron commander was a new thing to me, commander sent me everywhere, check this and that, inspect new planes, and call the engineer. And he kept placing more and more at my shoulders…\n\nA few days later this young pilot perished in this airplane with heavy cannons. I forgot his name now, but he was the only child of a famous, highly decorated pilot, who shot down many enemy planes during WWI. After the First World War ended he stayed in France, where Russia bought new planes.\n\n— Minaev?\n\nNo, I forgot his name. But I hope that I will recall it, because I read a book about him, named «Broken Sky». This pilot brought his group to the south, entered Denikin’s Army, and on first occasion flew to the Reds. Fought near Tsaritsyno, then formed a group from the remains of the old airplanes, hanged bombs, and destroyed an airfield near Voronezh that was controlled by Denikin. Then he did the same to the second Denikin’s airfield.\n\nThat boy was his son. I didn’t know it then, I found it all when I sat at the Lenin’s Library.\n\nIn the 35th regiment a son of famous pilot Babushkin, after whom a metro station was named, also perished. He crashed at Kerstovo airfield.\n\n— Here is a photo: Captain Tretyakov, Starshina Grebennikov, Senior Sergeant Susenkov in a cockpit, Il-2 No 12 with two stars on the fuselage. Most likely gunners’ kill-marks.\n\nSusenkov was an airplane technician.\n\n— Next one: photo specialist, Senior Sergeant Gulay, pilot Osipenko.\n\nSenior Lieutenant Osipenko. Alexander Osipenko. He died over a year ago from cancer in Leningrad. He was a great pilot and great photographer. Several times he made pictures of me attacking. It is a very difficult thing to do. He flew 117 missions. He could be sent for the highest award of the Hero of the Soviet Union.\n\n— Tretyakov on a wing of Il-2.\n\nYes, I know it. With a parachute. I remember it.\n\n— Pilot Yevstigneev.\n\nAlexandr Yevstigneev… He perished with my gunner, Vladimir. You know how? They took off in a blizzard and young wingman collided with them. They all fell together. {18}\n\n— photo: regiment commanders at Bogoslovo village.\n\nHere are all regiment commanders. There were two images and I am on one of them.\n\n— Kapitan Ageenko. You said he was the 2nd squadron commander?\n\nHe was the 2nd squadron commander, but for some reason a weapons technician from our squadron was accused in incorrect handling of bombs. What happened really, who did something incorrect is still unknown…\n\n— Ageenko perished because…\n\nDuring one of the missions a bomb exploded. Either pilot didn’t know that it had an instant fuse, or he mistakenly flew too low. But how such an experienced pilot could make a mistake?\n\nHe is already with shoulder boards on this photo, a Captain. Order of the Red Star and two Orders of the Red Banner. Ageenko also received an order of Alexander Nevskii…\n\nDo you know what Delta F is? Delta is known from math formula, in algebra. For example, in navigation this is an adjustment. In life it happens that you need to make an adjustment for a fool. Memory can also be mistaken. In your records there are errors in last names but I know for sure that this is Vasiliy Spirov, not Spirin.\n\n— Vasiliy Spirov…\n\nBecause I know his wife and son, I buried him in Tsarskoe Selo. We will find this case with the help of Raisa Yakovlevna, the typist. We will find the files that I know. I am already blind, you know.\n\n— What can you say about Il-2 with 37mm cannons?\n\nIt looks like our factories started producing Ils with 37mm cannons a bit later, and that’s why they made it in a haste. These cannon could pierce most vulnerable spot in the Tiger, Panther and Ferdinand armor. Those super heavy tank creatures. This spot was above the engine and behind the turret with armor 40 mm thick. If you fired from above where the engine was, 37mm shells could penetrate the armor and damage the engine. Exactly what was needed?\n\nBut if it was developed earlier, it could be placed on fighters. Fighters received it later. They were on jet fighters MiG-15 and MiG-17 during Korean War. That’s 1950s. But a fighter had one such cannon.\n\nSturmoviks received these cannons before the Battle of Kursk. It was important that they were synchronized to each other. I flew to test these new weapons. Noticed enemy ships, my pilots were flying behind me. I’m a leader, I fired and they followed. The plane even stopped in the air, I was swinging, pressed against the chair. Good. But there was another variant, when canons did not fire simultaneously…\n\n— Novitskii Yevgenii said about 37mm cannons that because of them there were several catastrophes — wing broke off.\n\nThat’s what I tell you – unbalanced airplane. What’s it, if not a future catastrophe? If the burst was short it was normal. But when it was a long one, the cords would loosen up and cannons will fire not simultaneously.\n\nI used to have a photo, where there is no airplane visible, but a piece of an island covered by shell explosions, clearly cannons were firing not synchronously — in such cases the airframe experienced such loads that they could rip a plane apart.\n\nI know who perished in such a crash. He was not from the 35th, but from the 7th regiment. I believe he wasn’t a simple pilot too…\n\nBut to be simpler I would advise to fire in short bursts only. {19}\n\n— Let’s move on. What happened later?\n\nLater? All the same — war! In the summer 1944 war was mostly going on at the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland, where we fought against groups of small ships. Between Narva and Tallinn there was a port Kunda. We strafed it. Here is Narva River and here is Narva Gulf… Here is Merikula, where our assault troops perished. The Germans guarded this place, there was a minefield there, to be sure that our forces won’t make it to the shore. No one knew about it, even though pilots passed their information. I saw how they mined there, I lost two men there.\n\nDuring summer we still bombed them, that was a task given by our high command. Our intellectuals and smart heads tried to deceive their intellectuals and smart heads. But we had nothing to do with these games. Our business was to strafe. Day after day, day after day. Dive bombers bombed once or twice, and they never flew there again.\n\nWe were common guests in Merikula and often bombed it. And I almost got killed there, almost made a mistake. The regiment commander… I must tell you about the 35th regiment commander Kuzmin Vasiliy Petrovich… Does this name tell you anything?\n\nThis name didn’t tell anything to Fleet Commander Admiral Tribuz too. He didn’t mention him a single time in his memoir book «Baltic Warriors Fighting», even thought he mentioned me 3 times. He didn’t mention the former commissar of the 7th guards’ regiment, the regiment commander Vasiliy Petrovich Kuzmin a single time. There must have been something between them.\n\nKuzmin flew as zampolit to Finnish fiords during first months of war. He described tricks of finding boats there. He even wrote a manuscript. I read it. He said:\n\n— I want to fight. I want to lead a squadron to battle. And to write papers and publish propaganda material - someone else can do it without me.\n\nHe was transferred with demotion as a squadron commander to the 7th Guards regiment. He led them to battle. Then he was transferred from the 7th regiment to a position of the 35th regiment commander.\n\nHe liked to fly with our first squadron, where Tretyakov was a commander, and I was his deputy. He liked to fly with us. Once he took me as his wingman and lead entire regiment — almost 30 airplanes. I flew to the left from him. He led us to small ships, but I noticed large merchant ships near the shore… I called over radio:\n\n— Lets go there. Where are you going…?\n\nAnd “untranslatable” further on… But he kept flying as mission order prescribed. We all followed him. He dove, I dove. We shot after him and dropped bombs. Turned around and flew along shoreline. We flew past large merchants that I noticed before attacking the small ones. I got frightened and thought: my God, what could I have done, if the commander would decide to follow my guide. Germans pulled empty merchants to the shore. Waterline was as high as 5-7 meters, that is, they were empty, and they almost dragged them to the beach. And about 100-150 meters away under the bushes were dozens of AAA guns, waiting for us to attack. God, what could have happened if I lead the whole regiment to this trap… Commander didn’t say a word. And he didn’t say a word during debriefing…\n\nRight at the wake of the 1945 New Year eve I walked at the street of Leningrad, and met a driver of Regiment Commander Lt. Col. Kuzmin. By this time Kuzmin was transferred to the 11th Division as a commander of the 8th Guards regiment. When the war at Black Sea was over, this division was transferred to the Baltic Fleet. His driver was flying as his gunner. On the ground he was a driver but flew missions as a gunner. He replied:\n\n— Commander is here, let’s go and meet New Year together.\n\nI was on vacation, and had a full suitcase of large apples with me. Kuzmin’s wife met me, we knew each other, because she worked as a librarian at Kerstovo airfield. Commander met me:\n\n— Hello!\n\nWe celebrated the New Year. They started to bring food to Leningrad, it was no famine already. I saw mandarins, couple of vases with grapes, and they put my apples there too. We are sitting, toasting Victory. Vasiliy Petrovich was sitting on a couch and I was standing next to him. He said:\n\n— Listen, do you think that I do not know who swore at me over radio then?\n\nThat’s a scandal! Almost a simple pilot barking at the regiment commander…\n\n— I know that it was you.\n\nHe didn’t do anything then, but some rumors must have appeared. He continued:\n\n— Don’t worry that your nomination for the Hero of the Soviet Union was denied. They will send it again and you will get it, don't worry.\n\nIt happened that not only my nomination was called off, but Nikolay Nikitin’s as well. He got into fistfight with somebody. The reason for me was more complicated. The commissar Malovichko, the same one who never flew a single mission, called it off. He made it silently, without explaining the reason. That was our commissar. He pulled it all off when the regiment commander was transferred to the 8th regiment.\n\nWe flew more than once with Kuzmin. On the northern side of Chudskoye Lake there is a village Ranapulgeria. We flew and noticed a small ship smoking below. We dove at it but Kuzmin made it very carefully:\n\n— Stop, something isn’t right here.\n\nWe gained altitude, made another circle. Usually ships went through the middle of the lake, but this one was near the shore. Then we noticed AAA guns nearby. It was, in fact a trap – a raft was made from logs and they put a barrel with oil and ignited it, so it was smoking. A trap! He saw it and I saw. And we went to the middle of the lake – there were more than enough real targets there.\n\nAnother trap we met at the Riga Gulf. There was a burnt-out German merchant, which was of no use to anybody. We didn’t understand it in time and hit it with rockets, ripped all superstructures off. That was a decoy target. And we bought it.\n\nAn attack on Islands Sommers on 23.07.1944\n\nKotka port, burning AAA cruiser 10.07.44-1\n\n3 photos: Semisunk practice cruiser at Svinemunde area after strike by Il-2s and Pe-2s on 5-05-45\n\nStrike against descent barge carrying ROA soldiers escaping Kurland\n\nStriking a merchant ship in the Hela area on 8.04.45\n\nA merchant ship going down\n\nAttack against a trawler\n\nKovastu area, Il-2 damages a descent barge on 28-07-44\n\nTsypichev and Fedorenko preparing Il-2s armament for future fights\n\n— You celebrated the New Year. Where your regiment was stationed then?\n\nThe regiment moved from Pyarnu airfield to Saaremaa Island, airfield Kogul, which was used by the 1st MTAP pilots to bomb Berlin in 1941.\n\n— Did your regiment take part in fighting at Moonsund islands? That same Saaremaa?\n\nOf course. We also strafed ships near Obruk Island. That’s a small island south of Saaremaa. Strafed them at Kihelkonna harbor…\n\n— What can you tell about fighter cover?\n\nAt the beginning of the war, even up to 1943, there were very few flights with cover. We flew in small groups and fighters flew in small groups, they had a lot of problems with guarding Sturmoviks.\n\nWe got new planes in our division, the cover was performed with Yak-7b’s. Later, by the end of war, at winter 1945 other fighters appeared — Yak-3, but there were few of those. That was a light airplane and it was a highly maneuverable machine that could easily outmaneuver German fighters. They mostly had heavy Focke-Wulfs with great cannons. We also got fighters with air cooled engines. Twin star La-5 and La-7. Later there were La-9, which had large fuel tanks and there was a possibility to hang drop tanks to it. That was a totally new hardware.{20}\n\nBut apart from machines it is very important who flies them.\n\nThere were pilots who had no idea how to fight, there were pilots who got into the air by accident. But mostly best men went to aviation, people ready to risk their lives. Comrade Stalin Josef Vissarionovich said:\n\n— Pilot is a concentrated will, character and readiness to risk.\n\nA great pilot was Mikhail Avdeev.\n\n— A lot is known about Avdeev. Avdeev and Grib were fighter pilots in VVS ChF.\n\nI knew Grib, we used to study together. I flew with Avdeev in pair after the war.\n\nWe received new sturmoviks Il-10. They arrived at the end of the war, somebody even made several combat missions with them. But they were not successful, experienced sturmovik pilots said that they were good planes, streamlined, it even had sound-proof insulation and engine was more powerful, and everything was great, but bullets somehow hit radiators more often then in the old Il-2. {21}\n\n— That is, in your opinion Il-10 was worse then Il-2?\n\nIt wasn’t worse, but pilots said so…\n\nBy the way, Avdeev shot at the speed boat carrying Manstein, it was not known before. Just recently this information became available. But he did not have a right to do that as he flew a recon mission. In this case you have to follow your rout and get back. It was lack of discipline on his side. He wanted to see Yalta and could not stop himself.\n\n— What do you remember about the strike at Haara-Laht on 12 or 14 September 1944?\n\nWe had no planned strike at Haara-Laht. I had flown there, but it was a secondary target.\n\n— Tikhomirov told us that you were going in regimental strength, rather loose formation. You, the first squadron, than the second, and the third behind. And he told you to get closer to bombers in order to minimize the enemy’s time to react.\n\nThere were several such flights. It really happened in general area of Haara-Laht, but a bit closer. In Haara-laht there was a turning point for the fighter cover. Sturmoviks could fly 30-40 kilometers further. Fighters had less fuel, so we didn’t fly there. There was one case when they shouted \"Turn back…\" Those were the flights along southern coast of Gulf of Finland, by Estonia coast towards Tallinn. Narva, then Kunda, then Merekula, and then Haara-Laht. We flew there several times, the whole division flew, not just our regiment. When the division flew, the 7th regiment went first, then our 35th. This practice was utilized during summer of 1944. We had new planes. Fighter cover flew on Yak-7b and there were La-5 nearby. But those were not cover; they were stationed at Lavensaari Island and at Kuplya airfield. My squadron usually flew last. If the Germans would chase us we would be the first under attack. That’s why I gained about 500 meters of altitude higher then the main formation. Then I saw that our friends commenced the attack, I gained speed and flew over the coast. I was not going along the coast but going to the enemy’s territory at an altitude and is difficult to hit me at such altitude. If I attack ships from the coast I will gain speed and then I’ll end the attack run well into the open sea. There was a hope that the Germans will not chase us there – they didn’t like open water. That was my calculation. I did not cover it up, everybody knew of my tactics. Many years later Engineer-Colonel Vladimir Orlov stumbled across me on the street in Moskow:\n\n— Hello, how are you?\n\n— Fine, and you?\n\n— I work in the Headquarters. Not long time ago we discussed your suggestion about protecting bombers in bad weather conditions.\n\nBut I retired 3 years ago. And the clerks were still mumbling my suggestions how to protect the bombers. I mastered bombers, torpedo bombers, jet fighters, sturmoviks. I had ideas how to arrange their work together. Then I retired but they just strated looking at my suggestions. That’s what Vladimir told me. Then we returned to the war days and he said:\n\n— Listen, do you remember how your last in formation almost collided with my last in formation because you attacked with a different angle.\n\nYes, we almost collided… Poor Volodya, he passed away. He was a sturmovik from the 7th regiment - smart, good boy. I studied with him at the officers courses.\n\n— Could you tell us what do you remember about attacking Finland?\n\nI flew to Finland only twice. We flew out with Tretyakov, he lead me for the first time. Tretyakov used to be a fighter pilot. He was very experienced, 9 or 10 years older than me. He came as a Senior Lieutenant, but later he became a Captain. He got his first order. Do you understand? First mission! Being his deputy, he took me as his wingman. We flew in pair. Took off from Gora-Valday airfield, crossed the Gulf of Finland. Flew between Kronstadt and Shepelev lighthouse towards Finland. To our right was Vyborg Archipelago islands. To the left – the Gulf of Finland. There is a “nose”. At that nose as our reconnaissance reported was a long-range artillery battery. Long-range artillery is a serious thing, it can fire as far as 25 kilometers away…\n\nTretyakov came precisely to the target, but there was nothing difficult in it – even a fool can do it. I suddenly noticed an airplane flying straight at us and reported:\n\n— Aircraft ahead!\n\nAnd we immediately opened fire with cannons and machine guns, eight traces, his and mine. This airplane went down and disappeared. This was a signal – if they located us, only God knows what Finns could do with us.\n\nWe flew, attacked the battery from shallow dive. Then we turned around and drifted towards the enemy territory. We turned, fired again. Spent all ammo… That was my first strike at the Finnish territory.\n\nSecond strike was strange. I already was getting into ambulance Po-2 with pilot Igor Ladnov. There was a covered cabin, where two passengers could sit. I didn’t know this Po-2 pilot, but he always flew this plane. He was supposed to take us to Komendantskii airfield in Leningrad from Gora-Valday. There we had a mission to test-fly airplanes…\n\nWhy I chose Igor – he had relatives in Leningrad, we thought that we will spend a night there, in the morning I will test-fly airplanes and by the evening we would fly back to our field.\n\nBut we were told that the German aircraft were flying. This was Oranienbaum bridgehead, Gora-Valday was a very dense place. We waited when a seaman came to us:\n\n— Comrade Lieutenant, you are called to the regiment HQ.\n\nI came to the regiment HQ and they told me:\n\n— Lead the 3rd squadron on a mission. There are no leaders now but you.\n\nI hated such exprompts, seriously, I hated them. With whom would I fly? Who? Who will be my deputy? I appointed Ivan Gavrilov as a deputy, I knew him a bit. Some of other pilots I never saw before. We took off in six plane formation. Somewhere between the islands there were four guard ships. And these guard ships were not some boats, it was a serious business. And really, reconnaissance gave correct information — four guard ships were going in keel water formation between the islands. I led the group to attack them, the guys followed me shooting at them. The gunner was also from their squadron. I demanded he would report what the group is doing. Everything was fine, they followed me, they all attacked…\n\n— You flew only two missions to Finland?\n\nYes, I believe two. But I could have forgotten. A lot of time had passed. Maybe three flights. There were several missions to islands of Vyborg Archipelago.\n\n— Did you fly at Kotka or Turku?\n\nNo, I did not. Sturmoviks flew to Kotka only once in summer 1944 together with dive- and torpedo bombers. Flew against \"Vaynemaynen\"… Sunk \"Niobe\". That was Black Sea Division that just arrived to Baltic…\n\nBut let me end the story how I led the 3rd squadron. So I led that squadron and they followed me. We attacked, turned around, to attempt a second run. I noticed that one plane is not diving, but drops bombs from level flight, right along those ships. I looked carefully, remembered this airplane tactical number. Then we turned around to go home, when our fighter, Yak, dives right in front of my nose. He goes down and begins to gain altitude again. Behind him was a Focke-Wulf. It gets right into my gun sight.\n\nWhen Yak left my gun sight, I slightly adjusted direction with rudder and gave a long burst from about 100 meters. The German fell to the sea in pieces.\n\n— Did you receive money for the downed fighter?\n\nNo.\n\n— Why?\n\nIt’s interesting for me to answer your questions. Situation was difficult… I lead a squadron where there was no leader, but there was total mess. I brought the squadron home, everybody was safe and sound. I came to the parking area to the pilots. I wanted to find out why one pilot did not dive, but flew over ships and bombed from horizontal flight. I wanted to shake him:\n\n— Why did you do it?\n\nBut it was no order there, noisy crowd. Somebody shouted:\n\n— Hurray! We shot down! We sunk!\n\nI was no longer a leader for them. They saw that enemy plane was shot down. Everybody yelled: \"We shot down\". As if I had nothing to do with it, that’s because I was not in their squadron.\n\nNo one reports to me, they all went to major Konkov, adjutant of their squadron. He is recording something, they already forgot about me, even pushed me aside. And here somebody is telling me that situation in the air is normal and I have permission to fly to Leningrad.\n\nI got to the airplane, we got to the Komendantskiy airfield, and we test-flew two airplanes. Everything was fine. We reported. A technician approached me:\n\n— Comrade Commander, — he couldn’t see shoulder boards under the flight suit. — I looked around the hangar and found an old newspaper. Maybe it will be interesting to you.\n\nI unfolded this little newspaper. It had a title “The Baltic's Airman”. I kept this newspaper. Then we went to Igor’s relatives, ate there – we had our ration with us. Spent a night there. Leningrad was already deblocked. Igor’s relatives told us how they lived in Leningrad, about different miracles. They were crying. They all managed to survive.\n\n— Was it because their relative-pilot could smuggle some food to the city?\n\nNo, not like this. When the war started somebody went to the shop and bought a large box, meter by meter size, of caramel. Candy with some filling. They all survived. I also remember they had a portrait of some relative – a tank officer with the Order of Lenin. On the second day we flew the planes back to our airfield…\n\nThen Igor took my airplane without my permission, I was absent at the base at that time, and he perished. No one was allowed to fly my plane without my permission. But it happened that I had flu, and a doctor sent me back to the barracks, to have some rest…\n\n— Was your airplane different from an ordinary Il-2?\n\nIt was not too different. Ils from last series differed from the first ones. They had arrowed wing.\n\nIt was not camouflaged; it was silvery, without any paint, all metal. {22}\n\n— How did you aim with bombs?\n\nI looked through documents in the archive. At the beginning of the war Marshall Laktionov issued a directive \"Seven ways to aim\". And all were crap. We did not even manage to learn how to aim and the war started. The airplane was designed with armor, eight rockets under wings - a true battery. Cannons, machine guns. New collimator sight was placed, it was idiotic, useless. And do you think we hit the target? Smart people were thinking and discussing.\n\nOn the forced landing, when the airplane hit some obstacle, you hit your face against this gun sight — it was placed right in front of the pilot. Then the VV-1 was introduced. {23}\n\nOn the engine cowling there was a post with a ring. On the armor glass, which was 7 cm thick if you account for the angle, double layered glass, it was a cross-hair. You have to adjust the post on the cowling with the crosshair and then open fire. {24}\n\n— So you think that VV-1 was better than collimator one?\n\nIt was harder to use, but more precise. If you mastered it, you could fire more precisely. There were different methods of aiming bombs. Very effective one was skip-bombing. I mastered all methods.\n\n— How were you fed?\n\nI’ll tell you, I was shot down on August 15th 1943. I was weighted, and had 55 kilograms with a height of 175 centimeters. I can’t say that I was poorly fed, but 20 kilos deficit was serious. In 1944 we were excellently fed. In surrounded Leningrad we were twice given fried fish. I remembered it.\n\n— And how was cultural life? Any concerts? Did any actors come to you?\n\nOf course! Once I was on TV imitating how Paul Robson was singing. He was famous American bass singer. He came to Kerstovo airfield.\n\n— So he came to you?\n\nYes.\n\n«Oh, my baby,\n\nMy tender black baby.\n\nA-la-la-la-la-la»\n\nAt Kerstovo airfield in 1944 an American artist singed for us, from a flat bed truck. To be honest, I’m not sure that it was Paul Robson, but he had a voice like Robson. A woman, not black, accompanied him on the piano. Paul Robson was a famous bass and he sympathized to the Soviet Union.\n\nThere were also other concerts. Estonian amateur actors from the Estonian Corps came to us. They also fought for us. Of course, there were many of Estonians fighting against the Soviet Union – Izacks, they were nationalists. We had few of our own amateur actors. It was no time, everybody was involved in combat activities.\n\n— And what about movies?\n\nThere were movies, of course. But I watched them mainly while being in the hospital after injuries.\n\nIn the regiment I was responsible for gramophone, I got this assignment from zampolit. It was before we were sent to the front at Bogoslovo airfield where we were training. Training was intense. Three or four pilots were killed in training flights.{25}\n\nThen somebody broke a record and zampolit reprimanded me. When he was reassigned to another unit he forgot to strike this reprimand from my record. It was removed from my record when the 35th regiment was disbanded.\n\nOnce we were at Mariinskii Theater at some play. The play was going and here the bombs started to explode. We went to a bomb shelter. After the play we went outside and saw that near Saltykov-Schedrin Library there were two burned street cars and dead bodies. It all was pretty serious, no joke.\n\n— When did it happen?\n\nI don’t remember. I remember that the music was good. After wounds I was sent to the recreation facility in Berngardovka. There were dances there, music…\n\nA strike that I led had postponed victory day.\n\n— Explain please.\n\nThe Division commander Twice HSU Nikolai Chelnokov entrusted me with a sortie:\n\n— I give you four planes.\n\nWe made two flights. It occurred that this strike fell through the action of a strike group of the Baltic Fleet. It was a successful strike: a train was destroyed, a ship sunk, and Lieutenant Provotorov wrecked cannon. It happened so that that the train carried shells for long range coastal battery, and I hit it with one rocket.\n\nGermans got frightened, they decided that it was the beginning of the advance and got ready for defense. All local population was sent away. On the next day a beginning of advance was planned. Everything was prescribed and prepared, but it was postponed as reconnaissance found out about the German preparations. That’s why a large strike group was deployed only later on a strip that goes from Pillau port here to Visla River.\n\n— When you accomplished your last mission during war?\n\nIt was in January 1945, from Ezel Island. From that same airfield Kogul, that was used by 1st MTAP to bomb Berlin in 1941.\n\nI had a break and didn’t fly. I was sent to a vacation because my airplane was destroyed. It was an all-meta"
