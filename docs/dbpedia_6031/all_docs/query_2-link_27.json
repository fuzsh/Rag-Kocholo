        "text": "Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gurevich_(aircraft_designer)\n\nMikhail Iosifovich Gurevich (Russian: Михаи́л Ио́сифович Гуре́вич) (12 January 1893 [O.S. 31 December 1892] – November 12, 1976) was a Soviet Jewish aircraft designer, a partner (with Artem Mikoyan) who co-founded the famous MiG military aviation bureau. MiG is an abbreviation of their surnames. The bureau now simply known as Mikoyan, is famous for its fighter aircraft, rapid interceptors and multi-role combat aircraft which were staples of the Soviet Air Forces throughout the Cold War. The main focus in designing the aircraft were on high speed, fast ascent, and high flight altitude.[1] The bureau designed 170 projects of which 94 were made in series. In total 45000 aircraft of \"MiG\" brand have been manufactured domestically, of which 11000 aircraft were exported. Over 14000 \"MiG\" fighters have been produced under licence abroad.[2] The last plane which Gurevich personally worked on before his retirement was the Mig-25.\n\nLife and career\n\nGrave of Mikhail Gurevich in Saint Petersburg. Born to a Jewish family[3] winery mechanic in the small township of Rubanshchina (Kursk region in Russia), in 1910 he graduated from gymnasium in Okhtyrka (Kharkov region) with the silver medal and entered the Mathematics department at Kharkov University. After a year, for participation in revolutionary activities, he was expelled from the university and from the region and continued his education in Montpellier University.\n\nIn the summer 1914 Gurevich was visiting his home when World War I broke out. This and later the Russian Civil War interrupted his education. In 1925 he graduated from the Aviation faculty of Kharkov Technological Institute and worked as an engineer of the state company \"Heat and Power\".\n\nIn 1929 Gurevich moved to Moscow to pursue the career of aviation designer. Soviet design was a state-run affair, organised in so-called OKBs or design bureaus. In 1937 Gurevich headed a designer team in the Polikarpov Design Bureau, where he met his future team partner, Artem Mikoyan. In late 1939 they created the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau, with Gurevich in the position of Vice Chief Designer, and after 1957 as its Chief Designer, a post he kept until his retirement in 1964. This is quite remarkable, considering that he never joined the Communist Party.[1]\n\nIn 1940 Mikoyan and Gurevich designed and built the high-altitude MiG-1 fighter plane, starting from a project partially developed by Polikarpov's team. The improved MiG-3 fighter aircraft was widely used during World War II. In the years after the war, the two designed the first Soviet jet fighters, including the first supersonic models. The last model Gurevich worked on was the MiG-25 interceptor, which is among the fastest military aircraft ever to enter service.[1]\n\nTheir main focus was on high speed, fast ascent, and high flight altitude\n\nMore on Wikipedia\n\nמיכאיל יוסיפוביץ' גורביץ'\n\n' (ברוסית: Михаил Иосифович Гуревич‏; 12 בינואר[1] 1893 - 25 בנובמבר 1976) היה מתכנן מטוסים סובייטי ממוצא יהודי. יחד עם ארטיום מיקויאן הוא תכנן רבים ממטוסי ה\"מיג\" המפורסמים.\n\nתוכן עניינים 1 קורות חיים 2 ראו גם 3 קישורים חיצוניים 4 הערות שוליים קורות חיים גורביץ' נולד למשפחה יהודית בעיירה רובנשצ'ינה (מחוז קורסק). אביו עסק בתיקון מכונות ליקבים. בשנת 1910 הוא סיים את התיכון באוחטירקה (מחוז חרקוב) עם מדליית כסף על הצטיינות והחל ללמוד מתמטיקה באוניברסיטת חרקוב. לאחר שנה הוא נזרק מהאוניברסיטה בשל השתתפות בפעולות מהפכניות ונאלץ להמשיך את לימודיו במונפלייה, צרפת. הוא למד גם בבית הספר הצרפתי לתכנון מטוסים SUPAERO וסיים את לימודיו שם בשנת 1913.\n\nבקיץ 1914 הוא שהה בביקור במולדתו, ואז פרצה מלחמת העולם הראשונה. מלחמה זו, ומלחמת האזרחים הרוסית שבאה אחריה, פגעו בלימודיו. בשנת 1925 הוא סיים את לימודיו בפקולטה לאווירונאוטיקה של המכון הטכנולוגי של חרקוב והחל לעבוד כמהנדס בחברה ממשלתית לאנרגיה.\n\nקברו של גורביץ' בסנקט פטרבורג ב-1929 עבר למוסקבה כדי לחפש עבודה כמתכנן מטוסים. ב-1937 מונה לראש צוות מתכננים במשרד פוליקרפוב, ושנתיים לאחר מכן ייסד יחד עם מיקויאן את משרד התכנון \"מיג\" (ראשי תיבות של מיקויאן-גורביץ'), אשר תכנן סדרה ארוכה של מטוסי קרב מוצלחים, ובהם המיג 15, עליו קיבלו מיקויאן וגורביץ' את פרס סטלין בסך 150 אלף רובל.\n\nבמשרד זה הוא היה סגן המתכנן הראשי, ומשנת 1957 - המתכנן הראשי.\n\nגורביץ' קיבל פרסים רבים: פרס סטלין 5 פעמים, פרס לנין (1962) ואות \"גיבור העמל הסוציאליסטי\" (1957).\n\nראו גם תעשיית תעופה ברוסיה קישורים חיצוניים ויקישיתוף מדיה וקבצים בנושא מיכאיל גורביץ' בוויקישיתוף https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9C_...\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nReference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gurevich_(aircraft_designer)\n\nMikhail Iosifovich Gurevich (Russian: Михаи́л Ио́сифович Гуре́вич) (12 January 1893 [O.S. 31 December 1892] – November 12, 1976) was a Soviet Jewish aircraft designer, a partner (with Artem Mikoyan) who co-founded the famous MiG military aviation bureau.
