        "text": "MOSCOW, Nov. 25 (AP)—Mikhail 1. Gurevich, mathematician and aircraft designer who collaborated with Col. Gen. Artem 1. Mikoyan in designing the Soviet Union's MIG series of fighter aircraft, died Sunday at age 84, the Moscow newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya reported today.\n\nMr. Gurevich was born in the Kursk region and was graduated from the aircraft‐design faculty of the Kharkov Technical Institute in 1925. During the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, he had been studying in France.\n\nHe began his working career at various machine‐building plants as a calculator, designer and head of a design bureau. He turned to aircraft construction full time in 1929.\n\nHe became deputy chief of Aircraft Factory No. I in Moscow in 1937 and three years later built the MIG‐1 fighter. A refinement of that aircraft, the MIG‐3, was widely used by Soviet pilots against the Germans in World War IL\n\nIn 1942, Mr. Gurevich became deputy to General Mikoyan in the Aircraft Ministry's Design Bureau 155, the cradle of future MIG aircraft. General Mikoyan, brother of Anastas I. Mikoyan, the Soviet political leader, died in December 1970 at the age of 65.\n\nThe first jet fighter by modern standards that the two designers developed was the MIG‐15, which was test‐flown in December 1947. A more advanced version, the MIG‐17, appeared in 1950; and the MIG‐19, a supersonic, all‐weather fighter, followed in 1955.\n\nMr. Gurevich was officially listed as still working in aircraft design in 1972, a year after the latest aircraft in the MIG series—the MIG‐25—went into regular military service.\n\nHe was decorated for his service to the aircraft industry with the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, four Orders of Lenin, the Lenin Prize in 1962, a Stalin Prize and other awards."
