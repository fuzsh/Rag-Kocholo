        "text": "The outstanding aircraft designer Mikhail Iosifovich Gurevich is not as widely known as the leaders and founders of the Soviet aviation Design Bureau, which later became world famous and bear the names of their founders today: Tupolev, Yakovlev, Ilyushin, Sukhoi, Myasishchev, Mil and Kamov. He was always in the shadow of his immediate supervisor Artyom Ivanovich Mikoyan. However, his services in the creation of domestic fighter aircraft cannot be overestimated. And we should pay tribute to Mikoyan: when the question of choosing the name of the fighters designed in the Design Bureau was being decided, he insisted that they bear the names of two creators: Mikoyan and Gurevich. Thus highlighting the huge contribution of his deputy to the development of new generation fighters. This is how the MiG-1 and MiG-3 appeared and, perhaps, the most famous and famous MiG fighter company in the XNUMXth century. However, Mikhail Iosifovich Gurevich himself was also a MIG.\n\nBorn M.I. Gurevich in 1892 year in Kursk province. His father was a mechanic in a distillery, his mother kept housekeeping. Grammar school young Misha Gurevich graduated with a silver medal. And then he went to study at Kharkiv University on matfak. A year later, however, was excluded due to student unrest at that time.\n\nAt that time it was not so difficult to continue education abroad. And in 1912, Michael goes to France, where he enters the university in Montpellier. In France, he lived and studied for the help of his father and for work from private lessons. However, the full course of the university in Montpellier did not happen. Soon after Gurevich arrived home for the holidays, the First World War began. What did he not have to do at that time: he worked as a draftsman, painted posters, gave private lessons.\n\nBefore the February revolution of 1917, Mikhail managed to enter the Kharkov Technological Institute, where, as he pointed out in his autobiography, he studied with long breaks associated with the ongoing civil war. Here, with a small group of students, he participated in the work of the aviation circle. It was at this time that he had a great interest in aviation, which did not leave all his life. The activity of the circle members, supported by the teachers of the institute, especially the professor, and later academician G. Proskura, led first to the emergence of a new specialty at the faculty, and later a whole new faculty, which became the basis, formed later by the Kharkov Aviation Institute.\n\nTogether with friends, members of the institute section of the Society of Aviation and Aeronautics of Ukraine and Crimea, Gurevich developed and built two gliders: the Stork and the Boomerang, which participated in the II All-Union glider competitions in Koktebel in 1924 year. Unfortunately, in one of the flights the “Boomerang” collapsed in the air - the strength turned out to be insufficient. Under the strong impression of this accident, Gurevich wrote his first scientific article “Practical Guide for Building a Glider”, published in 1925 by the Agrochem Society in Kharkov. In it, he set out recommendations for the assembly of individual parts, assemblies and airframe assemblies. All diagrams and drawings were made by the author, who showed outstanding design skills.\n\nGurevich brilliantly graduated from the institute with a degree in aircraft construction. The theme of his thesis - \"Passenger aircraft.\" But he had to work as a design engineer of industrial ventilation machines in the Kharkov branch of the society \"Heat and Power.\" He flawlessly performed the calculations of various ventilation devices, but in 1929, the era of NEP ended, and the activities of such societies ceased.\n\nIn search of work, Gurevich arrived in Moscow in the same year and entered the design office of Paul Richard. This famous French aircraft designer arrived in the USSR in 1928 year, at the invitation of the Aviaprom to create seaplanes. Mikhail Iosifovich began working in this bureau with such famous designers who later became S. Korolev, V. Shavrov, G. Beriev, I. Chetverikov, N. Kamov. A year later, the team headed the French aircraft designer Andre Lyavil. The bureau was transformed into a BNK (New Construction Bureau). But it soon disintegrated, and Gurevich, along with other designers of the BNK, ended up at the Central Design Bureau, where aircraft for various purposes were developed. Gurevich got into a brigade led by S. Kocherigin.\n\nIn 1932, Mikhail Iosifovich as a designer already had a significant influence on the creation of the appearance and design of the TS-3 attack aircraft: he proposed a low-profile scheme with characteristic fairings on the chassis. The engine in the nose of the aircraft was protected by an armored box of flat pieces of homogeneous armored steel. On each wing console, there were five ShKAS machine guns. In addition, the attack aircraft carried high-explosive bombs and cassettes with fragmentation bombs.\n\nIn the spring of 1934, V. Kokkinaki tested TS-3. However, this aircraft was not accepted for service, since the concept of booking an attack aircraft was not completely clear in the Air Force.\n\nIn his work with Kocherigin, Mikhail Gurevich showed a bright personality as an aviation specialist, designer and then head of the group of general types. In 1936, the Kocherigin brigade was transferred to aircraft factory number 1. At the beginning of the next year, Gurevich was included in the Soviet delegation for a trip to the USA to the leading American air firms. The group, which included Mikhail Iosifovich, took part in the purchase of a license for the production in the Soviet Union of one of the best American cargo-handling planes Douglas DS-3. Working at the factories of the firms \"Douglas\" and \"Martin\", Gurevich was engaged in the acceptance of documentation, technology and the purchase of equipment.\n\nUpon his return from the United States to 1937, the aircraft designer actively participated in mastering the production of the licensed DS-3 at plant No. 84. The aircraft was named PS-84 (passenger aircraft), later - Li-2 and was mass-produced for more than 20 years.\n\nIn December 1938, Gurevich headed the “think tank” - a group of projects and conceptual design - at the OKB N. Polikarpova. At this time, he met Artem Mikoyan, who was then engaged in the modernization and serial production of the last in the Soviet Union biplane I-153 Chaika. They quickly developed good business relations, which soon became friendly. In February, Mikhail Iosifovich began working on the development of a monoplane fighter, which in the Polikarp Design Bureau was designated as “X”. The project of this aircraft provided for the use of a powerful liquid cooling motor designed by Mikulin. A bet on this motor promised to achieve a speed of 1939 km / h.\n\nThe threat of an attack on our country by fascist Germany was felt more and more real, and it was urgently necessary to rearm the Air Force with modern fighters. It is at this time that new design bureaus are being created, including for the development of fighters. One of them, highlighted by the People's Commissariat of the aviation industry from the Polikarpov Design Bureau, was headed by A. Mikoyan. For the first car, the entire Polykarpov reserve was used for the project “X”. Gurevich became Mikoyan’s deputy in the design bureau.\n\nThe joint work of Artem Ivanovich and Mikhail Iosifovich is an example of bright cooperation of gifted people. The union of these extremely different people turned out to be surprisingly successful, Mikhail was older, more experienced and more careful, Artyom was more temperamental, more energetic. Together, they perfectly complemented each other. Gurevich was involved in the creation of almost all the \"MiG\", until the famous and landmark MiG-25. In addition, he headed a completely new direction in the development of guided cruise missiles, in which the Design Bureau was able in its time to achieve a world championship.\n\nEveryone who was familiar with Mikhail Iosifovich remembered him as a man of high culture, tactful and benevolent. He never refused to help others, and there were legends about his rare modesty.\n\nThe range of interests M.I. Gurevich was very wide and diverse. Colleagues and friends often recalled how Mikhail Iosifovich closely followed the innovations not only in science and technology, but also in art, as he was a fine connoisseur of poetry. He loved and knew fiction, including foreign literature, which he read in English and French.\n\nGoodwill, high culture of Gurevich in communicating with people sometimes forced not a single fan to come to their senses to look for enemies around themselves. Here is just one example. In 1955, there was a spontaneous separation (uncoupling) of an experienced cruise missile (CS) from an aircraft carrier. But the worst thing was that there was a test pilot in the cockpit instead of the compartment with explosives. When this happened, one of the high-ranking representatives threw Mikhail Iosifovich in the face: “Well, tell me, where did the pests dig in? In your OKB or here at the flight station? ”Fortunately, test pilot Amet-Khan Sultan skillfully landed a cruise missile. \"Culprit\" then turned out to be a marriage of soldering in the electrical connector. The general was forced to apologize.\n\nGurevich had a Ph.D. in technical sciences, many times he was appointed chairman of the State Examination Commission at the Moscow Aviation Institute. Under his leadership, many excellent specialists grew up who glorified the domestic aircraft industry.\n\nIn 1964, Mikhail Iosifovich Gurevich, winner of six State and Lenin Prizes of the USSR, Hero of Socialist Labor, was forced to retire due to health reasons and soon moved with his wife to Leningrad, where he died in 1976 year. He was buried in Leningrad at the Serafimov cemetery.\n\nToday, the MiG, as before, represents a galaxy of powerful combat vehicles of various types and purposes. Apparently, this name will remain the symbol of the company as long as its planes are created.\n\nSources:\n\nBelyakov R. Marmen J. Aircraft MiG. M .: Avikopress, 1996. C.6-8.\n\nPtichkin S.
