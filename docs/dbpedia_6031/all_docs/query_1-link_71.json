Your employee gets a bad link, clicks an email, then types in their password, and maybe even their two-factor code - because it looks just like the normal company login page! Attackers have proven that your MFA is not enough. 0pass allows you to completely circumvent these basic risks by switching to a passwordless login that can't be stolen. Founded by cybersecurity leaders from SpaceX, AWS, and Blue Origin - we're building security tools that solve the biggest problems, without headaches for your employees.\n\nTermius (w2019) • Active • 32 employees\n\nTermius is an SSH client that works on desktop and mobile.

Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. From our early days of automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, to pioneering a brand-new market as the leading Trust Management Platform, our vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security remains unchanged. Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time check— is essential. Vanta is the leading Trust Management Platform that helps simplify and centralize security for organizations of all sizes. Over 4,000 companies including Autodesk, Chili Piper, Flo Health and Quora, rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust—all in a way that's real-time and transparent. Recently named the #1 Leader in G2's Winter 2023 Grid® Reports for Security Compliance, Vanta debuted a number of new product innovations over the last year, including Access Reviews which automates the once-manual, time-consuming access reviews process and an enhanced Risk Management solution allowing companies to holistically understand, prioritize, and reduce risks within their company to build a stronger security approach and demonstrate compliance. Vanta was built on the idea that software can be used to do amazing things for the world—if we trust it to do so. And we can’t do it alone.

A supply chain isn't just a build-time check, it's highly dynamic. EdgeBit watches in real time – we cross-reference your build pipelines and server fleet with multiple data sources to communicate your live inventory and actual risk. Security teams aren’t experts at their company’s apps, so they are forced to distract the most skilled engineers with a firehose of vulnerabilities to investigate. We founded EdgeBit because we believe that we can solve this problem — to empower security teams to prioritize investigation of true risks without wasting engineers time.\n\ndevsecops\n\nb2b\n\nsecurity\n\nTRM Labs (s2019) • Active • 180 employees • San Francisco, CA, USA\n\nAt TRM, we're on a mission to build trust in digital assets, because the promise of crypto is too valuable to be impeded by bad actors.
