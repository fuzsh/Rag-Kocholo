        "text": "The MiG-21 is probably one of the best known Soviet aircraft, flown by many nations and built in larger numbers than any warplane since World War II. It was designed in response to Korean War needs for a short-range interceptor and light strike fighter. First flown in 1955, the MiG-21 was the first Soviet plane to reach Mach 2. For three decades, variants of the MiG-21 went head-to-head with the F-4 Phantom and other American-made fighters in Cold War-related conflicts worldwide. In the mid-1980s, MiG-21s were in service with at least 37 air forces worldwide.\n\nThe famous \"MiG\" design bureau took its name from its founders, Artyem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich, in 1939. MiG develops only fighters, creating many variants of a few basic designs. Mikoyan began design of the MiG-21 in 1953, and it remained in production through the mid-1980s. The MiG-21PFM variant was introduced in 1964 and included high-lift improvements for short and unimproved field operations and a revised ejection seat and cockpit canopy.\n\nSoviet fighters like the MiG-21 are designed and built differently from their Western counterparts. American fighters such as the F-4 are large, sophisticated, two-engine, two-person aircraft designed to carry out many different missions. The MiG, on the other hand, is a relatively small, defensive fighter built with traditional materials and simple manufacturing. Their design was kept basic so that they could be built fast, cheap, and in large numbers. In combat, MiGs are tough, simple, rugged planes that can operate from unprepared airfields with minimum logistical support and be maintained by simple, basically unskilled labor.\n\nThe Museum's MiG-21PFM was built in the former Soviet Union and first flew on March 23, 1967. It served with the Czech 11th Fighter Wing based at Žatec, Czechoslovakia. What was to be its last flight occurred in March 1991 to the Aero Vodchody overhaul facility; the breakup of the Soviet Union later that year resulted in its permanent grounding. The MiG accumulated 1,933 flight hours and 3,029 flight cycles during its career.\n\nIn the early 1990s, a Boeing employee, Jim Blue, discovered this MiG-21, along with about 60 others, destined for the scrapyard. Through generous donations from Mr. Blue and others, the MiG was purchased in 1994, shipped to Seattle, and reassembled at The Museum of Flight."
