        "text": "Mikhail Goman joined De Montofrt University in 1997 being invited and funded by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (known as DERA), UK and QinetiQ, Ltd. He is Professor of Dynamics since 2000 at the Faculty of Technology. His research and scientific career started in 1972 at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI, www.tsagi.com ), named after Prof N.E.Zhukovsky, in Russia. He had an extensive experience in aerodynamic modelling and nonlinear flight dynamics with special focus on critical flight regimes in extended flight envelope. For this cycle of works and practical applications he was awarded in 1992 the Zhukovsky Gold medal, the highest aeronautical accolade in Russia, for the best work in Theory of Aviation.\n\nMikhail Goman is a Co-Director of the newly established Centre for Engineering Science and Advanced Systems (CESAS) at the Faculty of Technology and Head of Nonlinear Flight Dynamics Research Group, which is involved in research collaboration with a number of world famous research Institutions such as TsAGI, Russia and the National Aerospace Laboratories (CSIR-NAL), India. Recently, he was leading the development of the aerodynamic model of a generic airliner in extended flight envelope as a part of the European Union 7th Framework Programme research project SUPRA (2009-2012), Simulation of UPset Recovery in Aviation (www.supra.aero). This project was aimed at creating new simulation technologies (aerodynamic modelling, motion cueing and simulator driving algorithms) in support of pilot training on available flight simulators in extended flight envelope, where stalled flight conditions may lead to the Loss-of-Control in Flight (LOC-I), the major cause of flight catastrophes in modern transport aviation. The developed SUPRA extended aerodynamic model was highly ranked by the invited technical experts from the NASA Langley Research Centre and the Boeing Company.\n\n1) J. Pattinson, M. H.
