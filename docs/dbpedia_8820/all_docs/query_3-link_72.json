        "text": "Being a U.S. Citizen means the freedom to go where you want, and do what you love. Many national foundations can help you get there. Either by covering the entire cost of mobility equipment or with help to bridge the affordability gap.\n\nAlways read through the requirements carefully, and ask your dealer about other funding programs.\n\nIn support of the groups who help support others, many organizations offer grants for assistance to purchase mobility transportation equipment, and to those with physical disabilities.\n\nAlways read through the requirements carefully, and ask your dealer about other funding programs.\n\nVeteran Support\n\nYou’ve given your all. And we are all in awe of your service. Several grants, funds and support services are available exclusively for America’s veterans and their families.\n\nPlease read through all of the requirements carefully, contact your local Veterans Administration and work with your dealer to ensure you receive all of the benefits you’ve earned and are entitled to receive.\n\nThe American spirit embodies the LiveForward mantra. Many states put their money where their mouth is with grants and funding programs for mobility products. Some offer Vocational Rehabilitation assistance that helps pay for mobility equipment if it allows you to be an active part of the workforce. Others have programs that cover mobility equipment that results from an injury due to a vehicle accident.\n\nSocial Security disability benefits may also cover some of the costs associated with a disability.\n\nAlways read through the requirements carefully, and ask your dealer about other funding programs."
