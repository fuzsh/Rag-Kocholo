        "text": "Over the past few weeks I’ve been featuring some of my favorite local wedding venues on the blog by area. I’ve already shared blog posts for Northern Virginia, D.C., and Charlottesville! This week I’m focusing on the best Richmond and Southern Virginia wedding venues! This is an area that I’ve slowly seen my business expanding to over the past 12 months and I’m so excited to be working in this area more. There are so many venues on this list that are on my personal bucket list! Enjoy some of my favorites!\n\nThe Seclusion\n\nThe Seclusion is an elegant mountain venue located in Lexington, Virginia. Nestled on 72 acres, the timber frame barn is perfect for any season. Inside you’ll find the grand hall (where the reception takes place), the loft (the perfect place to slip into your dress), the quarters (a masculine getting ready space), and the lobby (a great spot for an indoor cocktail hour!). The Seclusion is perfect if you want a rustic, yet elegant wedding venue!\n\nDover Hall\n\nI visited Dover Hall back in 2019 and immediately fell in love with this space! The Tudor-inspired estate is located outside of Richmond and marries grandeur with modern amenities. The property has multiple ceremony locations as well as endless portrait spots, and multiple rooms for cocktail hour or rehearsal dinners. The main reception hall is entered through a grand staircase and looks like something straight out of a palace! On top of this, Dover Hall has an in-house catering team and rooms to sleep 10 guests so you and your closest friends and family don’t even have to leave the property during your wedding weekend.\n\nGlass Hill Venue\n\nSimilar to The Seclusion, Glass Hill Venue offers gorgeous mountain elegance in Bedford County, VA. Built specifically to host weddings and events, the lodge can host up to 200 guests and still leave plenty of room for a dance floor. The main focal point of the ballroom is a stone fireplace that extends 24 feet to the ceiling.\n\nIvy Rose Barn\n\nThe Ivy Rose Barn is a new luxury wedding venue and event barn coming to Southwest Virginia. The all-white barn will be be able to hold 250 guests and has multiple ceremony locations, including the front of the barn and private, wooded areas of the property. There will also be a gorgeous greenhouse that can be used for portraits, cocktail hour or host intimate receptions!\n\nBig Spring Farm\n\nBig Spring Farm is one of my favorite venues in southern Virginia! The Farm hosts a restored barn and mountains views nestled on a 10-acre lake formed by one of Virginia’s largest natural springs. I loved getting to see this venue in person for Chandra & Eric’s wedding! My favorite spot is the ceremony location, a peninsula that juts into the middle of the lake and is covered in romantic, willow trees. After the ceremony, guests can party the night away in the barn or in a rented 60×90 tent next to the barn.\n\nVirginia House\n\nThe Virginia House is high on my bucket list for venues I would love to work at! The romantic English Tudor manor house overlooks the James River and has 8 acres of grounds and gardens that are perfect for weddings of any size. The architecture of this venue is breathtaking enough on its own, but the surrounding gardens makes it seem like something out of fairy tale. Whether you’re planning a big wedding or more intimate elopement, make sure you add this venue to your list to visit!\n\nJohn Marshall Ballroom\n\nLocated in Richmond, the John Marshall Ballroom is a hotel filled with history. When it originally opened in 1929 the hotel was the largest in Virginia and welcomed political figures and celebrities frequently. Marble features and vintage chandeliers make this the perfect venue for a couple who loves a little history-infused in their big day.\n\nQuirk Hotel\n\nLooking for something a little bit more modern? The Quirk Hotel in Richmond would be my top suggestion! This cute boutique hotel is full of fun details and bright color palettes for the stylish and bold couples. My favorite part is the rooftop with views of the surrounding city!\n\nTuckahoe Plantation\n\nIf you’re in need of a venue that can hold a large guest count visit Tuckahoe Plantation! This historic property is perfect for weddings as few as 20 guests or over 500! The plantation is Thomas Jefferson’s boyhood home and now is a privately owned space. Couples can get ready in the manor home, tie the knot in the gardens and then enjoy dancing the night away under the stars or under a tent.\n\nUpper Shirley Vineyards\n\nUpper Shirley Vineyards is perfect for couples searching for waterfront views at a vineyard. This Low Country winery is set along the James River is only a short drive from downtown Richmond. They even have a built in rain plan – their covered porch which is a gorgeous option no matter the weather!\n\nThe Mill at Fine Creek\n\nLocated in Powhatan, VA, The Mill at Fine Creek is definitely a show-stopper if you’re looking a for a unique venue! The gardens and historic granite ruins of the Mill make a beautiful wedding day backdrop for any couple. The Mill is also only steps away from the creek providing couples with a unique portrait backdrop if you’re looking for something different than the typical fields or gardens of Virginia.\n\nWilliamsburg Inn\n\nIf you’re looking for an elegant wedding venue near Williamsburg, the Williamsburg Inn might be the perfect fit! The luxurious, Regency-style hotel has multiple indoor and outdoor locations for wedding days, including an outdoor terrace that can accommodate 160 people.\n\nBurlington Plantation\n\nI can’t wait to be at Burlington Plantation this fall for Emma and Matt’s big day! Located in Charles City, Burlington Plantation is a beautiful venue year-round. It is extremely versatile with a sprawling ballroom, private bar, groom’s quarters, bridal cottage and many gorgeous outdoor spaces. The expansive lawn and gardens are perfect for cocktail hour and offer so many portrait spots!\n\nEstate at River Run\n\nThe Estate at River Run is Richmond’s newest wedding venue. The Georgian Revival estate sits on a bluff overlooking the James River, just outside of the city. Couples can tie the knot on the front lawn, brick terrace, blue stone terrace or poolside before heading inside to dance the night away in the ballroom (which can fit up to 270 guests!).\n\nGovernor’s Palace\n\nLast, but not least is Williamsburg’s historic Governor’s Palace. This venue boasts so much Virginia history in its elaborate gardens. The Governor’s Palace is the perfect spot if you want some place with all of colonial Williamsburg’s charm and can host up to 400 guests.\n\nHopefully this list of Richmond & Southern Virginia wedding venues helps to kick off your wedding planning process! If you still don’t see a venue that’s a perfect fit for you, head over to my blog posts for Northern Virginia, D.C., and Charlottesville! The beginning of the wedding planning process always seems like the most overwhelming, but once you get going everything gets easier! You’ve got this!\n\nP.S.
