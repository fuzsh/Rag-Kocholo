As Richmond and its suburbs have grown, it’s still the locally owned bakeries, restaurants, and bars that draw long lines from residents. They’re passionate about their city and they know that this kind of preservation will keep its signature character for generations to come. Whether you plan to explore the Museum District, raft down the James, or eat your way through Church Hill, the locals will be happy to have you and share just what makes River City so special. Use our list of favorite activities to outline your next visit to Richmond, Virginia.\n\nGet Outside\n\nExperience the Mighty James River\n\nRunning from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Chesapeake Bay, the James River is not only one of Virginia’s greatest natural resources, but a celebrated playground for Richmond’s residents. Thanks to the James River Park System, visitors can enjoy the sights and sounds of the water through free trail access. Whether you enjoy fishing, bird watching, mountain biking, or nature walks, there’s no better way to understand the city’s heartbeat. Visit locally owned Riverside Outfitters when you’re ready to get out on the water itself. They host guided rafting and tubing adventures, from relaxing floats to Class IV rapid rides.\n\njamesriverpark.org, 7200 Riverside Dr, Richmond, VA 23225\n\nGet a Taste of the Gilded Age\n\nIn 1886, Richmond attorney James Dooley and his wife Sarah began plans for a 12,000-square-foot home, seated on a hill overlooking the James River. They named the finished 33-room mansion Maymont, and filled the surrounding 100 acres with an arboretum, an Italian garden, a Japanese garden, and a three-story stone barn. The Dooleys left their home to the city of Richmond and today you can explore the grounds that now include renovated gardens, a children’s farm and several habitats for rescue wildlife. Maymont Mansion is currently undergoing its largest renovation and will reopen for the holiday season in 2024, but the park is still open to the public where guests can attend outdoor events throughout the year.\n\nmaymont.org, 1700 Hampton St, Richmond, VA 23220\n\nBike the Virginia Capital Trail\n\nStretching the 52 miles between Richmond and Jamestown, the Virginia Capital Trail is a paved, scenic greenway for pedestrians and cyclists. The route honors the history of capitals both past and present, but also gives active visitors a chance to enjoy the Commonwealth’s scenery at a thrilling clip. Whether you take an out-and-back route from Richmond or bike all the way east, make time for a stop on the veranda at Upper Shirley Vineyards. Located one-mile off the trail, bikers can refresh with a glass of wine, a laid-back lunch, and views of the bird sanctuary at Presquile National Wildlife Rescue.\n\nvirginiacapitaltrail.org, 2803 Dock St, Richmond, VA 23223\n\nMake Time for a Garden Tour\n\nThe classical domed conservatory and more than 50 acres of flowers draw visitors of all ages to the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden year round. With a cherry tree walk, a rose garden, a dedicated children’s area and educational programs to suit gardeners of every level, it’s no surprise that this outdoor escape continues to be one of the Richmond area’s most popular attractions. It’s worth coordinating your visit with the garden’s calendar, so you don’t miss events like the Virginia Daffodil Society Show, spring and fall plant sales, and December’s holiday light spectacular.\n\nlewisginter.org, 1800 Lakeside Ave, Henrico, VA 23228\n\nHunt for Local Treasures\n\nIf you prefer activity of the retail variety, look no further than Carytown. Known as Richmond’s “Mile of Style,” these colorful blocks of locally owned shops capture the funky spirit of this vibrant city. Head to Mongrel for clever gifts and witty cards, browse the record selection at Plan 9 Music, and shop for one-of-a-kind apparel at Bygones Vintage. During your stroll, take a peek inside the Byrd Theater, a working 95-year-old cinema and national landmark. When it’s time for a break, park yourself at one of the window tables at CanCan Brasserie for French fare with a side of people watching.\n\ncarytownrva.com, 3120 W Cary St, Richmond, VA 23221\n\nTour Richmond’s Oldest Neighborhood\n\nSee the View that Named the City\n\nWhen you’re ready to pause and take in sights from a comfortable seat, head to Libby Hill Park in the historic Church Hill Neighborhood. Locals say that the city’s founder, William Byrd II, gave Richmond its name after the view reminded him of England’s Richmond Hill on the Thames River. While this riverfront vista is pretty on its own, it looks even better when you’re holding a chocolate croissant from celebrated local bakery Sub Rosa or for heartier lunchtime fare, a savory New Zealand-style pie from nearby Proper Pie Co.\n\nchurchhill.org, 2801 E Franklin St, Richmond, VA 23223\n\nStand Where Revolution Began\n\nHistory buffs can visit the St. John’s Church pew where Patrick Henry gave his “Give Me Liberty” speech, as part of the debates at the Second Virginia Convention in 1775. With an audience including future presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, these words influenced Virginia’s involvement in the Revolutionary War. The church is still active today, but hosts regular tours and spirited reenactments of the convention. The graveyard surrounding the church was Richmond’s first public cemetery and serves as the resting place for many early Virginians including Elizabeth Arnold Poe, the mother of Edgar Allen Poe.\n\nhistoricstjohnschurch.org, 2401 E Broad St, Richmond, VA 23223\n\nStudy the Spooky Past of a Literary Legend\n\nFounded in 1922, The Poe Museum celebrates the work of Richmond native Edgar Allen Poe and holds the world’s largest collection of his artifacts. The exhibits sit in Church Hill’s Old Stone House, the city’s oldest residential building that’s still standing today. Your museum ticket includes a tour of the Enchanted Garden and the Poe Shrine. These outdoor spaces were inspired by his poem, “To One in Paradise,” and they’ve attracted visits from cultural leaders including Gertrude Stein, Salvador Dali, and John Phillip Sousa.\n\npoemuseum.org, 1914 E Main St, Richmond, VA 23223\n\nExplore a Mile of Award-Winning Restaurants\n\nIt’s a poorly kept secret that some of the region’s best dishes are hiding out in this hilltop neighborhood. You’ll need reservations well in advance for most, but planning ahead will be worth it for steak-frites with staff-approved wine pairings at Grisette, the Siren’s Song seafood sampler at Alewife, or Southern favorites like cornbread and fried catfish inside the cozy Roosevelt dining room. Finish your meal with a scoop of New England-style ice cream at Spotty Dog or a creative nightcap at tropical cocktail bar, Emerald Lounge.\n\nCelebrate Culture\n\nGet a Crash Course in State History\n\nWhere else can you see George Washington’s personal diary, Arthur Ashe’s tennis racket, and a pair of buttons attributed to Pocahantas, all in one stop? The Virginia Museum of History & Culture not only houses an impressive collection of artifacts and an extensive research library for public use, but they also host rotating exhibits highlighting the state’s unparalleled influence on the country. In 2024, visitors can tour a showcase on the Rosenwald schools, an early 20th century program that built educational infrastructure for Black children across 15 Southern states.\n\nvirginiahistory.org, 428 N Arthur Ashe Blvd, Richmond, VA 23220\n\nSee Bunny Mellon’s Personal Art Collection\n\nThe Virginia Museum of Fine Arts boasts a comprehensive body of both American and international art, but interior design enthusiasts will enjoy seeing the works donated from the personal gallery of Virginia residents Paul and Rachel “Bunny” Mellon. These include paintings by Picasso, Monet, and Renoir, sculpture by Degas, and Mrs. Mellon’s Schlumberger jewels. The always-free admission to the museum’s permanent exhibitions includes works by the Gee’s Bend Quilters of Alabama, the Rumors of War statue by Kehinde Wiley, and the largest Fabergé collection outside of Russia.\n\nvmfa.museum, 200 N Arthur Ashe Blvd, Richmond, VA 23220\n\nWalk Through the “Harlem of the South”\n\nJoin celebrated local guide Gary Flowers on a tour of Historic Jackson Ward. By 1920, this neighborhood on the north side of downtown was the thriving center of culture and commerce for Richmond’s Black residents. The community’s famed Hippodrome Theater attracted regular visits from Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington. Also known as “Black Wall Street,” Jackson Ward was home to Maggie L. Walker, the first woman in the United States to found and lead a bank. In the 1950s, the construction of the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike bisected the neighborhood and resulted in the destruction of many historic buildings. Mr. Flowers, a fourth-generation Jackson Ward resident, leads his 1.5 mile tours through 20 of the area’s most important landmarks.\n\nwalkingtheward.com, Jackson Ward, Richmond, VA 23219\n\nVisit the Black History Museum & Cultural Center of Central Virginia\n\nWhile in Jackson Ward, head to the former Leigh Street Armory to learn more about the Black Virginians that shaped American culture. The interactive exhibits at the BHMVA share the important stories of NASCAR’S first Black driver Wendell Scott, American Civil Rights Attorney Oliver Hill, Tusekeegee Airman Howard Baugh, and the Richmond 34, a group of Virginia Union University Students who conducted a sit-in at Thalhimers department store. Don’t miss the contemporary art works as well, including an abstract sculpture that pays tribute to Hampton University’s famous Emancipation Oak.\n\nblackhistorymuseum.org, 122 West Leigh St, Richmond, VA 23220\n\nWine And Dine, Commonwealth Style\n\nToast a Special Occasion With Champagne Sunday Brunch\n\nThere’s Sunday brunch and then there’s the Jefferson Hotel’s Champagne Sunday Brunch. When you’re looking for a reservation that’s out of the ordinary, head down the iconic staircase for an unforgettable spread that includes oysters on the half shell, a carving station with Virginia ham, the hotel’s famous spoonbread, and a glittering array of colorful desserts. Often accompanied by live jazz music, this is a dining experience you won’t soon forget.\n\njeffersonhotel.com, 101 W Franklin St, Richmond, VA 23220\n\nAcquaint Yourself With Richmond’s Best Brews\n\nVirginia has centuries of hops history, but Richmond can claim the world’s first canned beer, invented by Kreuger Brewing Co. in 1935. Fast forward to 2012, and state legislation allowing producers to sell beer on premises inspired a wave of creative brewers to open taprooms in the River City. Today it’s hard for visitors to find themselves in a neighborhood without a brewery, but Scott’s Addition is the best place for aficionados to sample a few in a single trip. Highlights include Hardywood and their Gingerbread Stout, Starr Hill’s rooftop overlooking the neighborhood, and fruited ales at the Veil .\n\nvisitrichmondva.com/drink/richmond-beer-trail\n\nSample Alpine Cuisine Without Leaving the South\n\nLucky for Richmonders, Top Chef contestant Brittanny Anderson chose to open her Alpine-influenced restaurant in the heart of her hometown. Bring friends to sample dishes like Gruyère and Emmentaler fondue, German flammkuchen, and cacio e pepe roasted oysters. If you’re ready to keep the fun going after dinner, head next door to sister concept, Black Lodge. Sip on classic cocktails and dressed-up Miller High Life Ponies, plus take a peek at their caviar and shot pairings.\n\nbrennerpassrva.com, 3200 Rockbridge St #100, Richmond, VA 23230\n\nVisit the Wine Bar That Will Make You Feel Like a Local\n\nStep down into Jardin’s cozy basement-level wine shop and read the handwritten recommendations that accompany the bottle-filled shelves. If you’re having trouble deciding on a grape, head to the bar where the friendly staff is always eager to share a bit of sommelier knowledge and dish on their latest wine-related travel. While you can certainly take your carefully chosen bottle home with you, the outdoor patio is an ideal place to sip and take in the sights of Richmond’s fan neighborhood. Add a bit of their thoughtfully sourced charcuterie to the equation and you’re in for a lovely afternoon.\n\njardin-rva.com, 1520 W Main St Basement Suite 1, Richmond, VA 23220\n\nDig Into Soul Food Favorites at Mama J’s\n\nIf you’re looking for authentic soul food, visit Velma Johnson’s family-run restaurant in Jackson Ward. Nicknamed Mama J by her daughters-in-law, Velma has been sharing the dishes of her Richmond childhood with eager patrons for more than a decade. The fried chicken is a local favorite, but save room for side dishes like candied yams and macaroni and cheese. Even the cocktail names, like Grandpa’s Spiked Tea, underscore the familial ties running through this downtown restaurant.\n\nmamajskitchen.com, 415 N 1st St, Richmond, VA 23219\n\nPay Homage to an Italian Institution\n\nWhen locals are craving Italian fare like eggplant parmigiana and spaghetti with clams, they climb to the second story of an unassuming building near Virginia Commonwealth University. Edo’s Squid attracts visitors from all over the mid-atlantic to enjoy authentic, family-style dishes from the perch of its laidback dining room. Don’t assume you can simply open an app on your phone and reserve a table. Hopeful diners will need to call between the hours of 3PM and 5PM or stop by in person to make a reservation, but the plates at Edo’s are always worth the extra effort.\n\nedossquidrva.com, 411 N Harrison St, Richmond, VA 23220\n\nTry the Family Recipes of a Greek Matriarch\n\nAfter emigrating to the United States in the 1960s, Stella Dikos began working the line at her husband’s Village Cafe in Richmond, serving both American classics and traditional Greek dishes. Twenty years later, she opened her namesake restaurant that continues to be a highlight in the city’s dining scene today. Start your meal with keftedes (lamb and beef meatballs), dolmades, and spanakopita, but be sure to plan ahead for dessert. The house-made baklava, served with an optional scoop of ice cream, shouldn’t be missed.\n\nstellasrichmond.com, 1012 Lafayette St, Richmond, VA 23221\n\nEat Your Way Through a Food Tour\n\nNot enough time to visit all of the restaurants on your list? Set aside an afternoon for a Richmond Food Tour. With stops at five to six establishments, you can get a taste for one neighborhood’s famous dishes (Carytown, Church Hill, and the Arts District) or try the city’s best pizza and ice cream with a cuisine-focused outing. In true Richmond fashion, many of the neighborhood tours include an historic landmark on the side.\n\ndiscoverrichmondtours.com/richmond-food-tours\n\nEnjoy The State’s Architecture\n\nTour the Nation’s Oldest Purpose-Built Governor’s Residence\n\nCompleted in 1813 for Governor James Barbour, the Virginia Executive Mansion has been the home for the state’s first family ever since. Though it was renovated and expanded throughout the twentieth century, the home still reflects its original federal style designed by Boston architect Alexander Parris. The grounds include a greenhouse where produce is grown for the kitchen’s daily use, a 1950s symmetrical garden by Richmond landscape architect Charles Gilette, and the Valentine-Jackson Memorial Garden, honoring the enslaved families that lived and worked at the residence. Plaques on the walls of this garden feature letters that members of the Valentine and Jackson families wrote to their relatives in Abingdon, Virginia. The Executive Mansion is open every Tuesday and Friday for tours, and no appointment is necessary. Simply approach the gatehouse and let the guard know that you’re interested in seeing the home.\n\nexecutivemansion.virginia.gov, Capitol Sq, Richmond, VA 23219\n\nWalk By the Fan’s Grand Mansions and Row Houses\n\nIf you’re in the mood for a walking tour, start near the Branch Museum of Architecture & Design and peer at the early 20th century homes that line Monument Avenue. Heading towards the quaint Meadow Park, you’ll soon see bright row houses come into view, sure to influence your front door’s next color. For true exterior eye candy, head back up on Hanover or Grove Avenues where you’ll see well-manicured gardens and porches, in addition to artsy spins on seasonal decor. This neighborhood comes alive during Halloween, when residents’ enthusiastic displays attract trick-or-treaters from all over the city.\n\nvisitrichmondva.com/about/neighborhoods/the-fan-richmond-va\n\nSee an English Manor House, No Passport Required\n\nRather than starting from scratch to build their dream home in 1925, Alexander and Virginia Weddel purchased a 16th century monastery in Warwick, England. They had the stone building shipped over to Richmond in parts before beginning construction on the soon-to-be Virginia House. Upon completion, the Tudor-style home was deeded to the Virginia Historical Society and the organization maintains the house as a museum today. Visitors can see Mrs. Weddell’s opulent decor, including fine china and silver, plus tour eight acres of gardens on the James River.\n\nvirginiahistory.org/learn/virginia-house, 4301 Sulgrave Rd, Richmond, VA 23221\n\nMake Plans to Visit During Virginia Historic Garden Week\n\nFor visitors interested in the interiors and architecture of present-day Richmonders, mark your calendar for the Garden Club of Virginia’s full week of home tours. While this unique collaboration between the Commonwealth’s 48 clubs spans the state, the 2024 schedule includes three days of Richmond houses. Between the Westover Hills and Windsor Farms neighborhoods, you can tour contemporary rebuilds, Georgian revivals, and elegant gardens with meticulous detail."
