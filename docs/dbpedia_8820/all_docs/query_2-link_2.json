        "text": "Upper Shirley Vineyards\n\nby\n\nKathy Sullivan\n\nSummary: At Upper Shirley Vineyards we met with co-owner Tayloe M. Dameron. Tayloe is enthusiastic about the wines being produced by Michael Shaps using the Upper Shirley estate vineyard grapes. Upper Shirley Vineyards is also a destination site for wine, food and events. This is a delightful spot in Virginia to relax, taste wines and enjoy local cuisine.\n\nTraveling to Upper Shirley Vineyards takes visitors through Virginia’s bucolic countryside. Upper Shirley Vineyards is located 20 miles outside of Richmond, Virginia and lies close to the historic Upper Shirley Plantation.\n\nVisitors to Upper Shirley Vineyards will discover the large tasting room with a restaurant and event center in a Low Country-style building. The large, long three-story building stands out against the landscape. Colorful red/pink roses grace the front of the building, close to the parking area. Steps lead to the front doors and visitors enter into a foyer with the tasting room/restaurant on the left and the event room to the right.\n\nOnce inside the tasting room, guests can see that the building with a porch and large patio overlooks the James River. Far out on the James River one can see the Presquile National Wildlife Refuge, a large bird sanctuary.\n\nTasting Room\n\nThe tasting counter is shaped like a winged letter U. The largest area of the room has tables with seating for two and four people. At the time of our visit, several tables had been arranged to accommodate larger groups.\n\nAn image of the logo of Upper Shirley Vineyard is above the fireplace. The logo is based on polo. Tayloe played polo. The stripe is on a polo shirt. A regimental stripe is used for polo and the military.\n\nUpper Shirley Vineyards is owned and managed by Tayloe M. Dameron (pictured left) and his wife, Suzy Dameron. Tayloe has always wanted to own a vineyard and winery. According to Tayloe, “Let’s make a destination spot and build a premium brand of great wine.” Together they decided to create and build a destination site. The focus of Tayloe and Suzy is on growing quality grapes, offering wine tastings, including a restaurant and an event center which features weddings.\n\nWhile talking with Tayloe in the tasting room, he mentioned that growing grapes is volatile and that he and his wife wanted to build a vineyard and winery that would sustain itself. Tayloe noted that one year the winter temperature dropped to -6 degrees Fahrenheit and they lost much of the vineyard. Today the Upper Shirley Vineyards offers an elegant experience with views of the James River and vineyards. Upper Shirley Vineyards makes this a great location for weddings and other special events. The Damerons would like people to know, “Tidewater is an unknown region that can grow quality grapes. It is near the capital which resonates with people in Richmond.”\n\nVineyards\n\nThe couple discovered the site with gravel soils that would be good for growing certain grape varieties. They are still searching for the right grape varieties to grow. During the years when the weather creates havoc in the vineyards, it is the wedding and event venue that helps Upper Shirley to thrive.\n\nThe vineyards comprise of 23 acres of grapes. The soil is sandy gravel. There is no cold air drainage. Currently the grape varieties include Viognier, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat (pictured left).\n\nThe wines of Upper Shirley Vineyards are produced by Michael Shaps, a prominent Virginia winemaker.\n\nWines\n\nThe Rosé 2018 was a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The winemaking process included 3 1/2 hours on the skins. The result was a wine with an orange color and a red hue. The aroma was of red fruits. The taste was smooth with raspberry and red cherries. The finish was crisp and fruity.\n\nThe Sparkling Rosé 2018 was a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The wine was an orange color with a red hue.

During September, the Small Plates menu included House-Made Spiced Pecans, Mixed Olives, Pimento Cheese, Creole Deviled Eggs, Flatbread, Cheeses from Here & There and a Vineyard Board. For dessert, ice cream, a chocolate torte, Key Lime pie, and bread pudding were offered. The restaurant also offers a selection of full lunch menus including an assortment of Shared Plates, Salads, Sandwiches, Plates (pasta, shrimp & grits and crab cakes.)
