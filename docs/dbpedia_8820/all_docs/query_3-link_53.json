        "text": "Welcome to the Vermont Public Crash Data Query Tool!\n\nAll crash reports submitted to the State of Vermont involving motorized vehicles on all public highways are available for querying through this tool.\n\nThis tool provides access to non-personal Vermont motor vehicle crash data.\n\nData can be exported for further analysis.\n\nThis tool works best in modern browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 11.\n\nOnly 2000 crashes can be displayed at a time. Refine your query to a narrower location or timespan to see all crashes.\n\nInstructions\n\nBuilding a Query\n\nUse the Query Builder tab in the menu to launch the query builder window.\n\nEnter values for filters to change what results are returned. Many of the filters allow more than one option to be selected. Use the search box to quickly find values. Click once to add the option, click again to remove it. Most selects allow clicking a heading to add large numbers of values simultaneously.\n\nTo search by route, type directly into the route box to find matching locations. It is also possible to scroll through the the options alphabetically. To remove a selected route, click the (x) next to it. On mobile, route search is unavailable and selection/deselection may vary by device.\n\nQuery results are based on data in the crash report, so if the road has additional designations like a Town Highway number, select that as well.\n\nBroad queries may return too many results to display. Use either a narrower timespan or location filter to avoid this.\n\nClick Run at the bottom of the Query Builder to run your query, or click the X in the upper right to go back. Click the Clear button to restore filters to defaults.\n\nUsing the Map\n\nNote: The map limits display to 5,000 crashes for performance reasons. If your query returns more than 5,000 crashes, a note will appear recommending you refine your query. Common ways to refine a query including narrowing the date range or towns selected. Reports are unaffected by this limit. Older devices or mobile phones may struggle before reaching this limit.\n\nZoom: Use the +/- in the upper left, the scroll wheel, or touch controls to zoom in and out.\n\nPan: Click/tap and drag the map to move around the state.\n\nExamine a Crash: Click a crash to view more data about it. A popup will appear and the crash will be highlighted in the table. If there is more than one crash at this location, the popup will display an arrow in the upper right corner. Click that arrow to cycle through the crashes. For complete crash data, use the Data Export described below.\n\nToggle Layers and Themes: Click the Layers button in the upper right. A menu will appear with layers, themes, and basemaps. Multiple layers can be on at once, but only one theme and one basemap can be displayed at a time. Note: Using the heatmap may significantly degrade performance.\n\nDisplay legend: If a theme has special symbols, a button for toggling the legend will appear next to the Layers button in the upper right. The legend will appear on the left.\n\nSee crash location: Click the Street View link on the bottom of the popup information box for each crash. A new window will open Google Street View at the crash location, if available. Street view may not work on some mobile devices.\n\nPrint a map: Use your browser's Print Preview to ensure the area printed is the area you would like to have on the map. For best results, drag the area you want to print as far left as possible.\n\nNote: Not all crashes have valid location data and some may not be mappable through automated tools. The number of crashes not mappable will appear above the table. While we attempt to ensure that data is accurate, some errors and/or inconsistencies may occur. Contact us with any questions.\n\nUsing the Table\n\nExamine a Crash: Click a row to zoom to the crash and open a crash info popup.\n\nSearch Crashes: Use the search box in the upper left of the table. Searching happens across all columns as you type. The map will redraw based on the crashes currently display in the table.\n\nSort Crashes: Click any column to sort the table.\n\nAdjust table location: The green caret button in the upper right can easily toggle the table to horizontal or vertical layout.\n\nIt is also possible to click and drag an edge or corner to resize the table. Note that the table can only be moved in overlay mode (on larger screens). On small screens the table is below the map and cannot be moved.\n\nDownload the Data: Use the buttons on the left of the table to download the data in the table or copy it to the clipboard.\n\nChange the visible columns: Click the Column Visibility button to toggle columns on or off.\n\nGetting Reports\n\nMost charts and table headings are interactive to enable multi-dimensional data exploration.\n\nEach report has its own set of filters. Set the filters in the report to explore the data.\n\nTo view the reports full screen, use the arrows in the lower right corner of the report pane.\n\nTo print the report, first view it full screen, then print it using your browser's tools. Many reports print best on legal size paper in landscape mode or on letter paper in landscape mode with the scale set to 50%.\n\nReports include the first contributing circumstance from each vehicle involved in the crash.\n\nExporting Data\n\nUse the Copy or Download buttons on the data table to export data. All data returned by the current query will be exported. Data export includes GPS coordinates for easy visualization.\n\nGiving Feedback/Getting Help\n\nUse the Survey in Help tab to give feedback about your experience.\n\nTo contact us by email, click here.\n\nNotes\n\nThis tool provides the public with access to the non-personal statewide law enforcement reported motor vehicle crash data for the years 2010 to present. The Non-Reportable incident data from the Vermont State Police is provided for the years 2013 to present.\n\nThe database does not include the law enforcement crash report narrative or crash diagrams.\n\nFatal crash reports are submitted to the database as soon as sufficient information is available. Due to the complexity of a fatal crash investigation, it may take 90 days or more to receive all data related to a crash. As a result, PQT query results may vary from other data sources. Requests for up-to-date fatal crash data should directed to VTrans staff.\n\nInvolvement of any person or vehicle type in a crash, such as a person of a certain age, a person's positive test for drugs or alcohol, or a commercial vehicle, does not imply that person or vehicle operator was at fault.\n\nGlossary\n\nCrash\n\nAn event that may result in injury or damage involving one or more motorized vehicles on a highway that is publicly maintained and open to the public for vehicular travel.\n\nDaylight Hours\n\nOctober 1 to March 31 from 7:00 a.m. to 5:59 p.m. April 1 to September 30 from 6:00 a.m. to 7:59 p.m.\n\nDirection of Collision\n\nDescribes the type of crash, including those involving turns or angle collisions.\n\nDistracted Driving Crashes\n\nIncludes crashes where either the Primary or Secondary Contributing Circumstance-Driver was reported as \"Distracted\", \"Technology Related Distraction\", or any of the detailed Distracted data items in the updated UCRF of July 1, 2014 (below).\n\nDistracted:\n\n21.
