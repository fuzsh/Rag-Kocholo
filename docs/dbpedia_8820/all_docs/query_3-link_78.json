Rent-E-Quip\n\nService Provider for Small or Backyard Weddings: (TIE) Marylee Marmer Events; Rent-E-Quip\n\nmaryleemarmerevents.com; rentequip.org\n\nMarylee Marmer says small weddings give couples a chance to have an intimate ceremony and spend more time with their guests, but a planner is still important for handling the details and bringing your vision to life. Smaller-scale weddings can benefit from a partial planning package or day-of coordination. David Darby, wedding and event specialist for Rent-E-Quip, says microweddings have grown in popularity since 2020. To meet this need, the company provides romantic place settings, custom tenting and space lighting to fit private residences. Many couples also choose to upgrade their decor to premium options. “Since the guest count is smaller, this can often be accomplished without drastically increasing the overall budget,” Darby says.\n\nCalligraphy or Hand-lettering: (TIE) Letterful; Taddy Mikelaites\n\nletterfulco.com; taddymikelaites.com\n\nCalligrapher Molly Walker of Letterful says custom signage adds a touch of beauty and elegance, but it can also showcase what makes the couple — and their story — unique. Walker recently incorporated willow leaves into wedding place cards as a nod to a willow tree in a couple’s yard where the groom had proposed. “I was honored to create a special touch that reflected on such a personal moment,” she says. As both a calligrapher and a watercolor artist, Taddy Mikelaites loves creating one-of-a-kind pieces that leave lasting impressions. She often personalizes stationery and decor with calligraphy and watercolor accents such as maps, menus, bar decals and wedding crests. “I describe my style as romantic calligraphy, a blend of modern and traditional elements that create a unique and enchanting look,” she says.\n\n2.

She offers 12 invitation suites that can be personalized using ink and foil, paper, and print method, as well as embellishments and custom artwork. “A gold foil-pressed invitation gives a much different vibe than one letterpressed in dusty blue ink with a floral envelope liner,” McCoy says. “Or by including a venue drawing or watercolor, you give your guests a sneak peek of the celebration.”\n\nStationery/Invitation Shop\n\n1.

ElopeRVA\n\nLGBTQ-friendly Officiant: (TIE) ElopeRVA; Sincerely Pete\n\neloperva.com; sincerelypete.com\n\nChantal McHenry of ElopeRVA officiated her first wedding in 2017 when her friends, an LGBTQ couple, couldn’t find anyone to marry them. The requests kept coming. “My friends couldn’t find people of color, anyone in our age bracket, there were barely any women,” she says. “I checked the boxes.” McHenry works with clients to balance tradition, religion and spirituality in a way that reflects their beliefs. Sarah Pete of Sincerely Pete says that while there have been great strides in the wedding industry, there are still idiosyncrasies and a special understanding that can accompany planning LGBTQIA+ weddings. “As a queer woman, I want to be a resource for my community and provide a safe space for these folks to land,” Pete says. “I understand the sometimes-difficult family dynamics and can offer alternatives to a more ‘traditional’ wedding ceremony.”\n\n2.
