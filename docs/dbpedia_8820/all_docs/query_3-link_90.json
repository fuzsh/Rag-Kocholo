        "text": "FR/LG VS Seeker\n\nFireRed and LeafGreen contain what I find to be the most useful method of rebattling beaten trainers yet. By standing with a few trainers on-screen and using this tool, any trainers who want a rematch will get two exclamation marks over their heads and start jumping up and down or raising their hands to get your attention. Some of them will even level up their Pokémon as you go along in the game, and end up with some quite powerful ones. When the Elite Four are using Pokémon around level 70, it will have become a bit of a pain to train all those level 40-50 Pokémon you've got - unless you know where to find those VS Seeker trainers who level their Pokémon up to around that level. I will list trainers with Pokémon of other level ranges as well, although they will most likely not be as useful. They are sorted primarily by the level of their highest-leveled Pokémon and secondarily by the total experience points they give.\n\nNote that if you battle the trainer and he or she has lower-leveled Pokémon than shown here, don't worry; you just need to battle them again a couple of times and their Pokémon will level up (although I'm fairly sure beating the Elite Four is a necessity for some of the very highest-leveled ones). This shows their final levels. Also note that the experience points could possibly be off by a couple of points if the experience was split between many Pokémon when I battled the trainer, since the game rounds down. I figured it didn't matter enough to battle the trainer again for the exact value, but if you really feel like it and know better, you can of course correct me on some.\n\nThe effort points each Pokémon and each trainer in total give are now also in the list. By each Pokémon, they are shorthanded as HP for Hit Points, ATK for Attack, DEF for Defense, SPA for Special Attack, SPD for Special Defense and SPE for Speed. (Be sure not to get SPD confused with Speed.)\n\nClick the word \"Location\" for a screenshot in which the female (if in Kanto) or male (if in Sevii Islands) main character is facing the trainer in question; I include descriptions of how to get there too, however, and if I have accomplished my goal, those should be clear enough for you to find the trainer even without viewing the screenshot.\n\nTrainer List\n\nLevel 1-10\n\nLevel 11-20\n\nLevel 21-30\n\nLevel 31-40\n\nLevel 41-50\n\nLevel 51-60\n\nHigh-Level Training Spots\n\nEV Trainers\n\nTrainer List\n\nLevel 1-10\n\nBug Catcher Greg\n\nLocation: Route 3.

This section aims at giving you ideas for good training spots. If you know of a great one I haven't discovered, you are encouraged to contact me and tell me about it.\n\nBiker Ruben, Cue Ball Luke, Biker Lao, Cue Ball Camron, Biker Hideo, Cue Ball Koji\n\nLocation: Route 16\n\nNumber of Pokémon: 13\n\nLevels: 28-49\n\nTotal EXP: 13427\n\nNotes: It's not a very good spot compared to others - not really a lot of experience, but a lot of trainers and an awful lot of Pokémon to plough through - but I'm mentioning it for two reasons. One, it's great for slightly weaker Pokémon that can't handle battling everything in the other training spots without healing in between, especially since only two of them are using relatively high-leveled Pokémon and the others are pretty much something you'll faint easily in one hit, and two, it's Psychic-training heaven, since all their Pokémon are Poison or Fighting-types.\n\nJuggler Mason, PKMN Ranger Nicolas, PKMN Ranger Madeline\n\nLocation: Canyon Entrance, Seven Island\n\nNumber of Pokémon: 8\n\nLevels: 52-55\n\nTotal EXP: 13510\n\nNotes: Not the best spot, since it's a lot of steps and grass to the next healing spot (Six Island Pokémon Center) and they don't give that much experience.\n\nCrush Girl Sharon, Black Belt Hugh, Black Belt Shea, Crush Kin Mik & Kia\n\nLocation: Kindle Road, One Island\n\nNumber of Pokémon: 8\n\nLevels: 55-56\n\nTotal EXP: 15602\n\nNotes: The Ember Spa, where you can heal your Pokémon, is just a few steps away, which is very nice. All of their Pokémon are pure Fighting-types, making this training spot heaven for Psychic or Flying Pokémon. It does have the disadvantage of one of the battles being a double battle, however - if it's only one particular Pokémon you're training, it won't get quite all that experience.\n\nPKMN Ranger Jackson, PKMN Ranger Katelyn, Tamer Evan, Crush Girl Cyndy\n\nLocation: Sevault Canyon, Seven Island\n\nNumber of Pokémon: 10\n\nLevels: 52-56\n\nTotal EXP: 19016\n\nNotes: Pretty close to a healing spot, namely the house a little lower on the route in which a man offers to let you do the \"Chansey Dance\" which heals your Pokémon (without a doubt one of the silliest things ever to grace the Pokémon games after \"I like shorts\"). The types are rather mixed.\n\nCooltrainer Michelle, Cooltrainer Leroy\n\nLocation: Sevault Canyon, Seven Island\n\nNumber of Pokémon: 10\n\nLevels: 52-56\n\nTotal EXP: 20239\n\nNotes: You can't go wrong when you can get those two (what I'm fairly sure are the top two trainers in the game in terms of total experience) in one use of the VS Seeker. Additionally, both of them are standing just by the Chansey Dance house (which admittedly might be a little worse, since then you'll have to run randomly around to recharge the VS Seeker's battery between fighting them). Very mixed types, as one would expect of Cooltrainers.\n\nEV Trainers\n\nTired of battling wild Pokémon and want to get some good trainers to battle for your effort training? Look no further than here.\n\nHit Points\n\nThere aren't a lot of trainers that give very much HP in FR/LG, unfortunately, but the following all give four HP and nothing else and are not too difficult to access:\n\nLass Julia\n\nLocation: Route 8.

Surf right and up from One Island until you come to a beach; go up that entire island (keep to the left) and then enter the water again. Surf upwards until you come to a little sand island on the right that has a Fisherman on it, right below Mt. Ember. That is Tommy.\n\nPokémon: Goldeen lv. 33 (784 EXP, 1 ATK), Goldeen lv. 33 (784 EXP, 1 ATK), Seaking lv. 35 (1275 EXP, 2 ATK), Seaking lv. 35 (1275 EXP, 2 ATK), Seaking lv. 35 (1275 EXP, 2 ATK)\n\nTotal EXP: 5393\n\nTotal Effort Points: 8 Attack\n\nReward: 1260P\n\nHowever, he takes a little long to reach (not to mention Surfing, where you will be finding bunches of annoying Tentacool you don't want), so you"
