        "text": "By Dathan Kazsuk & Jennifer Primrose\n\nWith the pandemic so far behind us, it is nice to see more and more social gatherings with many of our local wine influencers returning. Our friends Dave and Kathy Nershi of VinoSphere had a wine dinner earlier this year, and we hosted a Negroamaro vertical from Piccione Vineyards a few weeks back.\n\nIn April, Merlot2Muscadine had a small assemblage at his home to sample North Carolina sparkling wines to celebrate passing his Sommelier level 1 course. And now, he’s at it again. In mid-May, he hosted a blind tasting at the Pine Acres Community Center in Fuquay-Varina. The theme this time was the red wine, Tannat.\n\nThe tasting featured eight wines from around the globe, including France, Uruguay, Texas, Virginia, and right here in North Carolina. I’m a fan of this bold and relatively tannic wine. Originally from South-West France, did you know that Tannat is now one of the most grown varietals in Uruguay?\n\nAnd did you know, next to Muscadine, Tannat has been lauded as one of the most beneficial wines to drink, thanks in part to its high level of resveratrol? I don’t drink enough Tannat to stay mega healthy, but I feel I’ll have a fair amount of it during this tasting, as I and 14 other influencers and wine lovers taste through eight different Tannat wines.\n\nMerlot2Muscadine, aka Arthur Barham and his wife Mary, ran the ship smoothly as all the wines were poured into 2-ounce tastes in tiny carafes at each place setting. The point system was slightly different than I’m used to – I typically follow the American Wine Society’s 20-point method. Here, Barham gave us three color poker chips (5, 3 and 1 points), which, at the end of our tasting, we put a chip into a cup, which will tally up the crowned winners for the evening.\n\nWith that being said – let the blind tasting begin. Below are some notes from myself and my criminal partner, Jennifer Primrose. The write-up below is in order from our least favorite to our favorite.\n\n2008 Kerrville Hills Tannat, Kerrville, Texas\n\nThis Tannat was my second evening favorite but came in third place overall. This was fine for this Texas winery I’d never heard of before. Long sultry legs and robust taste with some black currant, plum and licorice put this high on my score sheet. This Tannat was one of the most aged wines in our global lineup – and I’d like to try what else this winery is up to in the future.\n\nWait! Does that mean the top two wines are from the Tar Heel State? Yes, it does indeed mean just that! Have our tastebuds adapted to the tastes of the wines flowing from our state? I swear, this was a pure blind tasting, so none of us knew what wine was what. And many of us have WSET, CSW, Sommelier and wine store ownerships under our belts.\n\nSo let’s get to the final two – a battle of North Carolina."
