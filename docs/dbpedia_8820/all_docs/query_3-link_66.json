        "text": "Sip and Sample along the Williamsburg Tasting Trail\n\nThere’s a new way to experience Greater Williamsburg, but one could say that it’s as old as this historic region. While early settlers were building forts and establishing their presence in the area, they also brewed their first beers and planted their first vines. They believed that alcohol had many beneficial purposes. Besides being a clean source of water, they believed it had healing properties and provided energy to the body. One could say that the Williamsburg area is not only the birthplace of America, it’s where we first learned to drink.\n\nIn the last year, many new producers of fine alcoholic beverages have been opening their doors and welcoming patrons to imbibe. This has allowed visitors and locals a chance to experience high quality, handcrafted beverages produced by pioneers in their field. The enjoyment of these beverages is both a social and flavorful experience. Enter the Williamsburg Tasting Trail. This one-of-a-kind experience is a great way to explore the best alcoholic beverages in the Greater Williamsburg area.\n\nThe beauty of the tasting trail is that award-winning wine, excellent brews and more are all centrally located in the Greater Williamsburg area. Newbies and connoisseurs alike create their own tasting trail experience. Explore the deep history of Virginia wines stretching back more than 350 years. Discover Williamsburg’s growing craft beer industry. Or, if you want it all, take in a sampling of everything—wines, beers, meads and spirits. Visit one or visit them all, it’s up to you! And because each location has been carefully selected, you know that you are sampling the best of the best.\n\nVisitors to Greater Williamsburg are raving about the tasting trail. This is the perfect opportunity to try something new or indulge in a decadent extravagance. Plan a romantic getaway with your spouse. Or make it a relaxing weekend with friends. This is also your chance to pick up a few bottles of excellent wines, brews and spirts to take home as gifts (or keep for yourself).\n\nEstablishments of the Williamsburg Tasting Trail\n\nThe venues chosen to be a part of the Williamsburg Tasting Trail were carefully selected. Each winery, brewery, distillery and meadery chosen had to display a dedication to their craft, constantly perfecting and improving their methods. They also had to meet the highest standards in their ingredient selection. Not only have these establishments perfected the art of making these amazing spirts, they’ve also shown a desire to expand their repertoire through creative new processes and flavors.\n\nLet’s start with the wines…\n\nWine lovers are making Virginia a go-to destination. Since the days of the founding fathers, Virginia has been known for its excellent vintages. Five of the best wineries in the state are included in the Williamsburg Tasting Trail. These wineries make up the Colonial Wine Trail and are all located within one hour of Williamsburg.\n\nStart your journey at The Williamsburg Winery, the largest winery in Virginia. Serving classic, European-style wines, the Williamsburg Winery is known for its award-wining vintages. A tasting experience here will also include beautiful views, a delicious meal at one of the winery’s dining venues and possibly an overnight stay at Wedmore Place, a charming hotel with a European feel. Williamsburg Winery even has a 1,300-square-foot tasting room and wine bar in Colonial Williamsburg’s Merchants Square. Visit the location and enjoy a tasting flight on the picturesque outdoor patio.\n\nClick here to read more about The Williamsburg Winery.\n\nHeading north will take you to Saudé Creek Vineyards next. Enjoy live music every weekend. Saudé is the perfect place for a mellow, relaxing experience with your closest friends. Take in awe inspiring views of the scenic Pamunkey River from their wrap around porch. Incredible varietals and a warm and welcoming atmosphere are always found here.\n\nThe opulent feel of New Kent Winery will give you a taste for the good life. Drink a dusky merlot while taking in the historical buildings, constructed with century-old reclaimed materials. Just north of Richmond is James River Cellars Winery. With a distinctive Virginian flavor, this family-owned winery has a wide selection of wines that you won’t want to miss. The last stop on the trail takes you to Upper Shirley Vineyards, on a dazzling riverside estate in Charles City. The winery boasts 19 acres of vineyards that produce about 3,000 cases of award-winning wine per year.\n\nNext, the beers…\n\nAlthough microbreweries are a newer phenomenon, this craze has been sweeping the nation. Both locals and visitors alike are enjoying the variety of flavors that this industry produces. Breweries in Greater Williamsburg have appeared as strong contenders in this field. Their beverages range from dark, thick stouts to light and fruity saisons. They stand alone or pair perfectly with some of our favorite foods, combining for a mouth-watering experience."
