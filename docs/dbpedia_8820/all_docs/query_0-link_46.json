        "text": "Welcome to Virginia Peninsula, the newest appellation in Virginia and a nested American Viticultural Area (AVA). An AVA is a geographically defined grape-growing zone with boundaries determined by the U.S. government. Drawn to reflect the region’s subtropical climate and extended growing season in addition to maritime features that impact the topography, Virginia Peninsula is the eighth federally recognized winegrowing region in Virginia. The Virginia Peninsula AVA was granted approval by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau that was published in the Federal Register on Aug. 25, 2021 and went into effect on Sept. 24, 2021.\n\nThe 673,059-acre Virginia Peninsula encompasses the counties of James City, York, New Kent and Charles City in addition to the cities of Poquoson, Hampton, Newport News and Williamsburg. Bound by the James and York Rivers, the narrow AVA is roughly 50 miles in length and varies from 5 to 15 miles in width. The distinguishing features of the Virginia Peninsula AVA include its subtropical climate; moderate to mild winters; weather-related challenges relating to the humid temperatures and frequent raining during harvest season; and topsoil with an underlying bedrock primarily comprised of sandstone, marine vessels and clay. These soils are conducive to viticulture.\n\nA variety of wine types and styles are produced within the Virginia Peninsula AVA. Among them: classic vinifera grapes— Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Chardonnay, Riesling and Viognier among them and the more obscure vinifera grapes, such as Tannat, Petite Verdot and Petit Manseng. Hybrid varieties—including Norton, Chambourcin and Vidal Blanc—thrive throughout the region as well.\n\nThe other seven AVAs that call Virginia home are Middleburg, Monticello, Shenandoah Valley, North Fork of Roanoke, Rocky Knob, Northern Neck George Washington Birthplace and Eastern Shore."
