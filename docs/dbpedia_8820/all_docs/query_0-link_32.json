        "text": "Today we are sharing Lexi and Jack’s wedding day. Got married at Upper Shirley Vineyards which is in Charles City County on the James River. It’s between Richmond and Williamsburg.\n\nIt is one of our favorite venues to shoot at because it is absolutely gorgeous, but mostly the staff there is incredible. We always have a great time shooting there. The people are always so nice to us and incredibly helpful – and the food there is incredible.\n\nWe were especially excited for this wedding day because as we mentioned we’ve shot at Upper Shirley several times before but never in the spring, on a sunny day, when things were actually green. We’ve been there in the fall, we’ve been there on rainy days, but we’ve never been able to actually go to the front of the building and into the vines of the vineyard and really utilize the whole space. Not really complaining because the riverfront is gorgeous and the property is beautiful no matter where you are. But it was so nice to be able to shoot in places we haven’t had a chance to go.\n\nIt was a hot day, but it was just so worth it to be there at this time of year.\n\nIt really doesn’t hurt that Lexi and Jack are just incredible.They are both so kind and unbelievably sweet. But also are just straight up models and so easy to photograph.\n\nTheir family and bridal party were just the best. They were all SO fun and so nice. They were all looking for how they could help or take care of Lexi and Jack. That’s always just so great to see.\n\nThey also just had incredible vendors.Their planners from Stag and Lily did such a good job. The band, from Sam Hill Entertainment, 10 spot, did a phenomenal job. It was wonderful.\n\nThey had a friend who officiated for them and he did a fantastic job. We always love it when you pick a friend or family member to officiate your wedding for you. It makes the ceremony so much more personal and special, in our opinion.\n\nLexi also had the sweetest relationship with her dad. They had a really adorable first look where they were both tearing up. His welcome speech was amazing, their first dance was so cute. I love it so much.\n\nAnyways, I loved this whole day. Enjoy a few of our many favorites from this incredible wedding day.\n\nCongrats you guys!"
