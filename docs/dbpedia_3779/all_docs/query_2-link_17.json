        "text": "The newspaper announcing the declaration of independence of the state of IsraelThe Jerusalem Post is a broadsheet newspaper based in Israel, publishing only English and French editions. It was founded in 1932 by Gershon Agron as The Palestine Post and change name in 1950 to The Jerusalem Post. In 2002 the paper was bought by CanWest Global Communications, a Canadian newspaper publisher, and Mirkaei Tikshoret, a diversified Israeli media firm controlled by investor Eli Azur. As of 2014, the main circulation of less than 30,000 was in the United States.[4] In April 2014, Eli Azur acquired the newspaper Maariv.[5]Formerly regarded as left-wing, the paper underwent a noticeable shift to the right in the late 1980s.[6] From 2004, under then editor-in-chief David Horovitz, the paper took a more centrist position, competing against the staunch left-liberal Ha’aretz. Its current editor Steve Linde aims to provide balanced coverage together with views from across the political spectrum, focusing on Israel, the Middle East, the Jewish world and interfaith relations.\n\nFramed"
