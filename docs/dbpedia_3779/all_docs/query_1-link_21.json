        "text": "HFI's Israeli Feminism Collections\n\nThe Haifa Feminist Institute archives have seven major sections or divisions.\n\nThe Women's Liberation Movement and Isha L'Isha\n\nThis is the core set of collections as it includes the history of the Women's Liberation movement in the 1970s, the archives of Isha L'Isha since 1983.\n\nFeminist Organizations\n\nMany and different feminist organizations operated around the country for many years. Some are still at work and some have closed down. We have material on about 20 organizations.\n\nPrivate Papers Collections\n\nThese collections came as a result of many years of feminist activism where women had been engaged in different feminist campaigns. Our private archives become public when our work is a part of a movement. In this collection we house private and public material donated to us by activists, some while they were working at Isha L’Isha and some while active in the movement. This section currently includes materials from 12 women. Some of them, like Hanna Dassah, who was the coordinator of the “Ethiopian women Project” within Isha L’Isha, or Yali Hashash whose research on women’s reproductive rights for her thesis prompted a campaign by Isha L’Isha on this topic. Naomi Nimrod papers from a writing competition of women in the Mediterranean and others. The first collection to be scanned is that of Marcia Freedman.\n\nWomen’s Peace Movements\n\nThe women’s peace movement has been around for more than 40 years. It had many different organizations, some of whom are still active. We have received and collected the entire archive of Bat Shalom comprises of 10 boxes, when the organization closed down and had nowhere to store its archive. Its northern chapter left us 3 boxes from its activities. Other organizations include Women in Black, the Peace Quilt, Women building Peace Culture and the Women’s Coalition for Peace.\n\nViolence Against Women\n\nThe issue of violence against women was always in the forefront of feminist activism in Israel. We have a collection of 22 files of press cutting dedicated to women murdered by their spouse during the years 1998-2007. It includes names and photos (if available) and every press cutting published on the occasion of their murder. Another collection includes 50 files and is the result of the project against trafficking in women that operated at Isha l'Isha from 1999 till 2015 and resulted in restricting and reducing trafficking in woman and in providing help to thousands of women. The papers of the Association of Rape Crisis centers including some of the Haifa Rape Crisis, 5 boxes, offering support to women (and men) who were sexually assaulted and raped since the establishment of the first Rape Crisis Center in Tel-Aviv in 1978. The Hotline for Battered Women. In 1990 Isha l'Isha together with the Rape crisis center and the shelter for battered women created a new service for women who were battered by their spouses. This hotline was based on volunteer work by women and gave advice and help to women from all walks of life. The collection includes 6 files of papers left over from the activities and services from 1990 until 2005 when the organization closed down.\n\nLesbian-Queer Archive\n\nThis unique collection is the only existing source of knowledge about Lesbian life, history and social activism in Israel. It consists of various documents received from individual women and from mainly three organizations:\n\nKLAF (Feminist Lesbian Community): This group was active for 20 years (1987-2007) as one of the leading groups to transform LGBT rights in Israel; It includes 8 archive boxes containing official correspondences, newspaper clips, articles, minutes, conference documents, demonstration materials, leaflets and documents from official Knesset (parliament) meetings. We estimate the total number of items in this collection as 8,000.\n\nThe Society for the Protection of Personal Rights: Is called today the National Association of LGBT in Israel (early protocols from the 1970s).\n\nKvisa Shchoara (Black Laundry): An LGBTQ group for social justice and anti-occupation that was active in 2002-2005.\n\nFeminist Journals and Pamphlets\n\nThis collection includes 18 files of various feminist journals including the complete collection of Noga the feminist magazine published from 1980 until 2006.
