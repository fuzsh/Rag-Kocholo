        "text": "Haaretz is an independent daily newspaper with a broadly liberal outlook both on domestic issues and on international affairs. It has a journalistic staff of some 330 reporters, writers and editors. The paper is perhaps best known for its Op-ed page, where its senior columnists - among them some of Israel's leading commentators and analysts - reflect on current events. Haaretz plays an important role in the shaping of public opinion and is read with care in government and decision-making circles.\n\nHaaretz was founded in Jerusalem in 1919 by a group of Zionist immigrants, mainly from Russia. Among its staffers was the Revisionist leader, Ze'ev Jabotinsky. The writer Ahad Ha'am was a frequent contributor during those early years.\n\nIn 1922, the paper moved to Tel Aviv, its home to the present day. From 1922 until 1937, it was edited by Dr. Moshe Glickson.\n\nIn 1935, the paper was bought by Salman Schocken, a businessman and prominent Zionist from Germany who had recently settled in Palestine. His son, Gershom, took over the editorship in 1939 and headed the paper until his death more than fifty years later, in 1990. Since then, Gershom Schocken's son, Amos, has served as publisher of Haaretz. Hanoch Marmari served as editor-in-chief from 1990 through April 2004, followed by David Landau, from May 2004 through June 2008. Landau was replaced by Dov Alfon, who served in the position until August 2011, when he was succeeded by Aluf Benn."
