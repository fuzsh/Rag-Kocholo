        "text": "[This first appeared as part of UCLA’s 2017 symposium, “The Naksa at 50”]\n\nAbstract: Despite its small size, Emile Habiby’s 1968 work, Sudasiyyat al-ayyam al-sitta (The Six-Day Sextet) is arguably the most compelling literary reflection on the moment of the 1967 Naksa and its immediate aftermath. Building on the topos of reunions, Habiby explores the ironies and ambiguities of defeat, and the imperfect new possibilities that came with Israel’s military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, possibilities that have been eclipsed many times over by subsequent developments. This essay offers a short appreciation of Habiby’s work, arguing for conceptualizing the work not as a collection of short stories, but rather a form situated between the short story and the novel. This formal ambiguity it not only true to the theme of imperfect reunions explored in Habiby’s work, but more critically, to the experiences of previously separated Palestinian communities joined against their will by Israeli military force.\n\nReunions Amidst Shock\n\nFor Arab poets and writers, the June War was a shock, an occasion for weeping, self-critique and even self-flagellation.[1] To hear the urgency of the moment, we only have to recall the opening lines of Nizar Qabbani’s well-known poem “Margin Notes on the Dossier of the Setback”:\n\nMy friends—behold the death of the old language,\n\nAnd the ancient books,\n\nTo you, I bring news of the passing\n\nOf our words worn out like old shoes,\n\nAnd the death of whorish vocabulary, sarcasm and curses\n\nI announce for you, for you,\n\nThe end of the thinking that led to the defeat.[2]\n\nWhile there may have been a consensus about the existential nature of the military defeat, Arab intellectuals differed on the nature of its causes. For some, it was due to betrayal and treason: a failure to properly modernize, or to fully commit to Marxist, Nasserist, or Baathist models of revolution. For others, the defeat was the direct consequence of a poverty of thought and language, or a blind adherence to authority and tradition. For the Syrian poet Adonis it was all of these things at once. Writing in al-Adab in 1968, he said:\n\nOur masses are not up to the level of the revolution. When the revolution surrenders to them, it betrays itself, when it abandons them it dies.… We must realize that the societies that modernized did so only after they rebelled against their history, tradition and values… We must ask our religious heritage what it can do for us in our present and future… If it cannot do much for us we must abandon it.[3]\n\nIn light of this body of writing, it is remarkable how differently the event was absorbed by those Palestinian poets and intellectuals who lived inside Israel. While they appreciated the enormous impact of the war on the Arab regimes, they did not necessarily talk about it in terms of defeat (hazima) and setback (naksa). As Mahmoud Darwish put it in a 1969 interview:\n\nAs a writer, the war had no sudden effect on me. It didn’t turn my thoughts upside down. It didn’t crush my ideals as it so thankfully did to those of the Arab poets outside my country. I wasn’t sitting up in a pigeon tower, needing to be convinced of the necessity of going down to the street. But the war was a painful truth-teller [and forced some writers to discover core realities]. Fedwa Tuqan’s poetry [for instance] took a sharp turn immediately after Nablus was occupied. During our first meeting in Haifa, I said to her, “Not a month has passed since the occupation, your occupation. What do you think about all these long discussions about poetry?” Then couldn’t help but add, “I hope there’s some benefit from all that’s happened. Let Nizar Qabbani come visit us in Haifa!”[4]\n\nQabbani never did visit Haifa, but others did. Similarly, the poets and writers of Haifa and Nazareth used the occasion to tour the West Bank to meet with writers and poets they’d never met, and family and friends they hadn’t seen in decades. The exchanges and conversations that developed out of these meetings were as transformative as they were unexpected. Within weeks or months, it was clear to Palestinian intellectuals that one of the most paradoxical consequences of the June War was that it managed to put an end to the twenty-year siege on Palestinian life inside Israel.\n\nAs welcome as this outcome was, the fact that it came about through military defeat rather than victory only accentuated the abject state of Palestinian politics, whether living as third-class citizens in the Jewish state or living under the new military occupation. In this context, it is not surprising that Palestinian citizens of Israel spoke about the war and its aftermath in terms of meetings that were as sad as they were happy, and reunions that, on the one hand, reaffirmed Palestinian connections, and on the other, reminded Palestinians of the divisions that continued to separate them. The post-1967 literature is dominated by the motif of reunion.[5] Importantly, the motif is fraught, incomplete and even troubling, as evidenced in the ambiguity inherent within some of the post-1967 reunions cited in Maha Nassar’s recent study, Brothers Apart.\n\nIn one instance, Nassar recounts the story of the Haifa intellectual, Hanna Abu Hanna, who took a car trip through the West Bank in the months following the war. Abu Hanna and his wife visit her sister in Ramallah—it is the first time they have seen each other in twenty years. Then Abu Hanna drops in an old friend, who asked, “Shall we thank the occupation, in whose shadows this meeting occurs? Yet it is the reason for our separation in the first place.”[6]\n\nIn a second instance, a young intellectual, Salman Natur, writes of his first trip to East Jerusalem in 1967 as a journey of self-discovery:\n\nUpon seeing a copy of the [Egyptian] newspapers al-Ahram and al-Jumhuriyya, or the [Lebanese] journals al-Adab or al-Adib, I felt at that time as if I was embracing the Arab world.… [Along Salah al-Din Street] you don’t hear anything around you except Arabic, and everything you see is written in Arabic, and the people are calling out in the [open air] market [selling] Arab goods… It was as if I stepped through a large portal and entered the Arab world.[7]\n\nIsraeli officials correctly understood that these meetings between West Bank and ’48 Palestinians were transformative and that they would undermine the fragile system of control which had, for almost twenty years, relied on a policy of isolating and separating Palestinian communities inside the Jewish state.[8] In a third example, Nassar recounts the story of how the poet Samih al-Qasim was detained by the Israeli police in early 1969. After questioning the poet about contacts al-Qasim had made while taking a tour of the occupied territories, they detain him for weeks on charges of conspiracy. There, in Damun prison, al-Qasim meets prisoners who had been brought in from all over the occupied territories—from the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights. As Nassar puts it, “After years of writing about the need for Arab unity and lamenting the barriers that kept Palestinians in Israel from having contact with other Arabs, it was in prison… that they were finally carrying out a unique type of Arab unity.”[9]\n\nEmile Habiby and the Six-Day Sextet\n\nArguably, the most important literary statement on these post-war reunions was Emile Habiby’s 1968 work, Sudasiyyat al-ayyam al-sitta (The Six-Day Sextet). There is little doubt that motif of imperfect, incomplete and troubling meetings were on Habiby’s mind at the time he wrote it. As Habiby put it many years later:\n\nI wrote the Six-Day Sextet during the first year of the occupation. If they’d called it the Seven Days War, I would have written it as a septet instead. I wanted to flip the word on its back to see the other face of this war’s tragedy. A prisoner, separated from his family for twenty years, wakes up one day to loud noises in the prison courtyard. Suddenly, he finds his entire family gathered there with him. After all the rupture and isolation, how is he supposed to feel about such a reunion? Can we even call that a ‘reunion’?”[10]\n\nThe Sextet first appeared in the pages of al-Jadid, the legendary Arabic-language monthly of politics and culture established in 1953 as an organ of the Israeli Communist Party (MAKI).[11] Like other literary publications in Beirut and Cairo, al-Jadid translated poetry and essays from a wide range of languages, and engaged actively in questions of modernism, literary commitment, and cultural critique. Unlike those other journals, the circulation of al-Jadid was confined to one city and a handful of towns and villages in the Galilee and Triangle. It is difficult to exaggerate the accomplishments of this little journal, which at various times employed Hana Abu Hana, Tawfiq Zayyad, Emile Touma, Samih al-Qasim and Darwish as editors, and which formed, despite the perennial, double-edged embargo[12] of Palestinian literature inside Israel, one of the most vibrant journals of the entire Arab world until its demise in 1991.\n\nThe Sextet appeared over the course of six issues of al-Jadid, between April and September of 1968.[13] Although the stories were published under the pen-name of Abu Salam, readers would have recognized the author immediately: over the years, Habiby had published many pieces in al-Jadid (and its sister newspaper, al-Ittihad), sometimes under his own name, sometimes anonymously, sometimes under various pen-names.[14] In any case, the light touch of his prose and its biting sense of humor were as good as any signature.\n\nEach story in the work sketches a meeting that is troubled and incomplete. In most cases the reunions are between people—old friends, old loves, people who might have met earlier were it not for the Partition. But the encounters always also involve other things—places, things, stories, memories, songs, and poems.\n\nIn the first story, “Hayna sa‘ada Mas‘ud bi-bn ‘ammuh,” a young boy inside Israel—from the only family without relatives in the village—meets his uncle and cousin for the first time. As joyful as the encounter is, tensions break out between the West Bank cousin and the other kids in the neighborhood. By story’s end, the protagonist grasps the precarity of their attachment and wonders what will happen when Israel withdraws from the West Bank. A question mark hangs over this reunion.\n\nIn the second story, “Akhiran, nawwara al-luz,” a friend from his town approaches the narrator for the first time in twenty years and asks him about another childhood friend of theirs. Thus the story of this other friend is recounted and how, in 1947, he had loved a girl from the West Bank and had promised to marry her the following year. When the Nakba occurs, the two lovers are separated, never to meet again. The narrator tells us how this man had gone on a quest to find out what happened to the lovers after all these years, and how, while visiting the West Bank after the June War, he had actually found the same girl now married but who’d nonetheless held onto the same almond blossoms that were a token of her engagement to the other young man, their mutual friend. The narrator’s old friend is desperate to remember the name of the young man in this love story, but the narrator is unable to help him. The man goes away, still trying to remember the identity of the protagonist of the story. At the end, the narrator reveals that the young man of the love story was this same confused man from his village, and that the protagonist he was trying to remember was himself. The man had indeed met his old love, but his repression was so total that he never recognized her. In the shadow of this lost memory, their meeting both happened and did not.\n\nIn another story, “Umm al-Rubabika,” we meet an old rag and bone seller. In her junk shop, property looted from Haifa homes in 1948 mingles with property looted from the Golan Heights in 1967. Another, “al-‘Awda,” tells the love story of activists from opposite sides of the Green Line who meet in a series of joint protests both inside Israel and in the West Bank, only to be separated again in Israeli prisons. The details of the various stories begin to accumulate and get tangled up in one another. Motifs repeat. Situations, characters and phrases repeat so often that it sometimes becomes difficult to remember which story we are in.\n\nThis confusion, it seems, is precisely the point. While each story is self-contained, they are also in conversation with one another through an aesthetics of repetition and doubling. While critics have tended to discuss the work as a collection of stories, this is mistaken: from the moment it first appeared in April 1968, The Sextet was published and named as single work, not as a collection of separate stories. Thus, in terms of literary form, The Sextet exists somewhere between story and novel. And in this regard it is crucial to remember that this work itself marks a turning point in the author’s career: before The Sextet, Habiby wrote only short stories; after, mostly longer experiments within the novel form.\n\nIn this light, we might consider how the final story of the Sextet, “al-Hubb fi-qalbi,” folds back onto other narratives. To frame this, it needs to be pointed out that Habiby begins each of the six stories with an epigram taken from a song—such as “Raji‘una” or “Zahrat al-mida’in”—sung by the Lebanese singer Fairouz. While the meaning of these lines is never made clear, they tie the stories together in a ligamental, lyrical way. Not accidently, they suggest something like radio broadcasts drifting across otherwise closed borders.\n\nHowever, “al-Hubb fi-qalbi” breaks the pattern of the first five stories by quoting lines from a pre-Islamic poem which, we are told, “was never sung by Fairouz.” This last story then begins by reflecting on the fact that while Fairouz sings with warmth and feeling, her songs were composed by others. In the same way, Habiby’s unnamed narrator explains that the story we are reading was not written by him but by others. The figure holds: as a fiction writer—who is really a journalist—the narrator recounts narratives composed by others, just as a chanteuse sings songs written by others. This sense of collective, disparate authorship resonates, as we shall see, with the very form of Habiby’s text, which gathers together many narratives into a single account characterized by multivocality and resonance.\n\nThe narrator then mentions that on a recent visit to Leningrad he was taken by his hosts to see the national monument to the 900-day Siege of Leningrad, one of the most horrific episodes of the 20th century. Overwhelmed, the narrator and the others wander through the grounds, silent and sullen. In a small building next to the monument, they see the possessions and relics of victims of the siege, including a small diary of Tanya Savicheva, a young Russian girl of eleven or twelve at the time of the Siege.[15] The narrator quotes directly from the diary on display there: “Today grandmother died. This morning, my little brother didn’t wake up… Today they took away my mother. She was sleeping the whole time. She hasn’t come back” (80).\n\nThe narrator’s Russian hosts tell him that the diary was found in the rubble of the city, and the girl Tanya died soon after the siege was lifted. The narrator, devastated by the story promises his hosts, “I will write about what I have seen.” But after leaving them, he wonders whether he is up to the task: he is just a journalist whose usual material is quotidian, even banal.\n\nThe narrator’s block comes to an end when he happens upon the letters of a young woman from Jerusalem, now in Ramleh prison. The narrator decides to change the name of the author of the letters—not to Tanya, but to Fairouz, because that is a name which “moves us” (82). Fairouz, the girl who wrote these letters to her mother was one of three girls accused of plotting against the Israeli state. The story then goes on to quote the letters at length: in the first, the girl presents a wish list of items (magazine, hairbrushes, toothpaste, a watermelon, chicken) she wants her mother to send to them in the jail; in the second letter, the girl tells her mother, who appears to be a 1948 refugee from Haifa, about her cellmate, the girl from Haifa—and how much they have in common: how they both listen to Fairouz, Abdel Wahhab, and so on. Throughout the letters, the girl tells her mother not to worry (la taqlaqi, la khafi) so often, that we begin to see the real desperation behind her words. The narrator never presents the third letter, whose contents, he tells us, we have already encountered in false newspaper accounts of the trial of the Israeli policewoman who helped smuggle the letters out. The story—and the Sextet—end with the narrator reminding us that the reality here is of a friendship between characters “from a single people who have reunited, after a long separation, under a single roof, the roof of a prison cell” (92).\n\nEvery element in the final story resonates with situations, themes and characters from the other stories: here, as elsewhere, the tension between separation and reunion (or in the Arabic: al-qati‘a wa-l-liqa’) is only resolved the most fleeting ways; the doubling of a far-away story—Tanya’s story—with a local one repeats many such instances of narrative mixing in the Sextet, where small everyday stories of Palestinian life get tangled up in the plots of The Tale of Two Cities, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and the folktale of “Jubaineh and the Blue Necklace.” The same is true of the prison narrative, which resonates with another prison narrative in the fourth story. There are other instances of repetition worth mentioning, such as Habiby’s sly habit of misquoting, in this particular case, taking the words “weapon in hand” from Abdel Wahhab’s 1967 song, “Hayy ‘ala falah” and making them into “love in the heart.”[16]\n\nWith such an untrustworthy quoter of well-known poems and songs, what are we to make of the narrator? Indeed, this is one of the most fascinating elements of the work itself. The narrator in the final story seems to be the same narrator who appears in the others, even though we can never be sure: in some stories, the narrator is from Nazareth, in others, from Haifa or a village somewhere in the Galilee. He could be a Palestinian everyman—observing and recording, always in the same wry tone. But there is also evidence to think of him as even more ambivalent, reluctant than that. This hesitation comes through in the last lines of the third story, when the old rag and bones dealer, Umm Rubabika, hands him a stack of letters, which are perhaps the same prison letters that appear in the sixth story?\n\nThe gift of these letters reminds the narrator of how his own grandmother used to tell stories about Hassan the Clever—only she told the stories out of order, without beginning, without a proper ending. Or as he puts it, amputated stories (qisas butra’). After leading us on about the letters, the narrator decides not to tell us what they contained: “let’s leave this story amputated, let’s finish writing it together” (49).\n\nThis ambiguous gesture—between silence and authorship, between beginning and end, between separation and reunion—seems especially fitting for thinking about how the June War appeared to Habiby (and perhaps others) in the months that followed. Its meanings were unclear, even if its implications were not. But as Habiby’s stories make exceeding clear: while fiction could raise questions, the answers would be have to be found outside the text.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] On the literature of post-67 self-critique, see: Fouad Ajami, The Arab Predicament: Arab Political Thought and Practice Since 1967 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981), 24-75.\n\n[2] Nizar Qabbani, Hawamish ‘ala daftar al-naksa (Beirut: n.p, 1969).\n\n[3] Adonis, as qtd. in Ajami, 29.\n\n[4] “Ma‘ al-sha‘ir Mahmud Darwish,” al-Jadid (1969: 3), 24.

Most recently, it was republished in 2006, as part of the definitive edition of Habiby’s collected works, edited by Siham Daoud and published by Dar Arabesque in Haifa. During the 1970s, parts of the work were produced in Cairo as a radio play, and Habiby himself adapted one of the most famous stories, Umm Rubabika, as a play by the same name.\n\n[15] For information on Savicheva, see: Patricia Heberer, Children During the Holocaust (Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2011), 52-54.\n\n[16] “As long as I have my hope, my hope, and in my hands my weapon,” (Tul-i ma amali ma‘yya ma‘yya wa fi-idayya silah…). Credit to Fuad Saleh for this observation.\n\nPrison Hospitality\n\nRashid Hussein (1936-1977) was a Palestinian poet from Musmus, a village outside Umm al-Fahm. Like his contemporaries Mahmoud Darwish and Samih al-Qasim, Hussein was a ’48 Palestinian (that is, a second-class Palestinian citizen of Israel). Educated in Hebrew and Arabic, Hussein wrote and translated volumes of poetry. He was also a prolific journalist, writing in the Arabic-language periodicals of the Left Zionist Mapam party. This essay comes from the collection of Hussein’s newspaper columns, Kalam mawzun (Haifa: Maktabat Kull shay’).\n\n(March 3, 1960)\n\n1.\n\nMy father had gone to pray. My three-year-old sisters didn’t understand what was happening—she cried her eyes out. For my part, I sat in a car between two detectives when another car full of policemen pulled up behind us. Behind this, there is a story that might provoke a smile at one moment, and bitter silence at another.\n\nThe sun had not yet set. I’d been sitting in my room with two friends and my father. Suddenly, there was a banging on the door. No sooner had I opened it than I found myself greeting five policemen led by an officer. The officer wielded his pistol casually as if he expected to find an armed gang in my room. Without wasting a second he said, “Sit here with your father.” Then he demanded that my friends leave the room.\n\nHe had orders from the magistrate court in Khudayra to search my house. I didn’t resist. “Go ahead and search, please,” I told him.\n\nHe asked, “Do you have in your possession any published materials from Arab countries?”\n\n“Yes.” I produced six issues of al-Ahram from my briefcase, one issue of al-Hayat, and two of al-Sayyad magazine.[1] Then I handed him a bundle of recently published books.\n\nThat didn’t satisfy him, and he ordered his men to search. Within moments, hundreds of books, magazines and booklets were heaped about the middle of the room. Then the four drawers of my wardrobe were emptied and every piece of clothing thrown out. The eyes of one policeman flashed when he stumbled across a bundle of letters. His officer asked about the name of someone they imagined I corresponded with. But he didn’t find the signature of that person on any of the letters, so he threw them back in their place. The flash of victory had disappeared from his eyes.\n\n2.\n\nThe officer said, “The light’s too weak here. Can’t you get me a brighter light?”\n\n“Sorry. We still haven’t gotten electricity here yet.”\n\nHe said nothing, then went back to getting his men to hurry up with the search. Eventually he went to a pile of magazines and books, going through them himself. Each time he grabbed one, he asked, “Where was this published?”\n\n“In Israel.”\n\nThen he’d turn to one of his men who read Arabic and ask, “Is this true?” He went on and on asking, getting the same answer from me, then turning to ask the man if what I’d said was true or not. I felt a wave of anger pour over me and said, “Listen, sir. You keep asking me, and I keep answering you truthfully. Either believe me when I answer, or don’t bother asking.”\n\nHe looked me over severely and said, “Fine.” He stopped asking his men about whether what I said was true.\n\nThe officer left the room, accompanied by the driver. The policemen continued on with their work. While I sat next to my father, calmly smoking.\n\nIt didn’t bother me that the police were doing their assigned jobs. What did bother me was that they put all the Arabic books published in Arab countries to one side. I protested, since these books had been published many years before the establishment of the state of Israel. But they were always searching for one word in particular: Egypt. Whenever they found it, the book was confiscated.\n\nThey seized The Epistles of al-Jahiz, The Journal of Juridical Rulings, and Darwin’s Theory of Evolution… and many other books. All of these were born long before I! Their one sin was that they’d been published in Egypt.\n\nThe search lasted three solid hours.\n\nThe officer returned. I served coffee, and all the policemen drank some. He refused with the excuse that he does not drink or eat in any house he searches. I heard my father tell him, while speaking about me, “Is he a criminal that you can’t drink coffee in his house?”\n\nOnce again, he tried to find an excuse. I saw the sergeant biting his lips, trying to explain to him that to refuse coffee is an insult to the master of the home. When I brought out coffee the second time, he drank it without saying a word.\n\n3.\n\nI left the room. The policemen went to the second room. I dreaded to see the courtyard of our house, filled with relatives and friends. I understood from them that when the officer went out with the driver, they took the car to the top of the hill in order to use their walkie-talkies. This was enough to spark suspicions and turn the matter into a big deal.\n\nThey found nothing in the second room. We went back to the first room and were surprised to find another car suddenly pull up. Two plainclothes detectives got out, along with the chief inspector of the Khudayra prefecture.\n\nThere were now nine policemen. The number frightened the bystanders in the courtyard. People thought my end had drawn near, or that I drew near the end!\n\nThe chief spoke, directing his words to the sergeant, “Do they read al-Ahram in your jurisdiction?”\n\nI answered, “They read with legal permission.”\n\nHe looked at me without saying anything. I noticed that the two detectives had brought a large flashlight and had begun to look over the confiscated books.\n\n4.\n\nThe investigation began, “Do you know so and so?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Did you give him a book on Sa‘d Zaghloul?”[2]\n\n“No.”\n\n“Did you give him a copy of Ruz al-Yusuf?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Where did you come to possess these recently published magazines and books?”\n\n“From the Arab Book Society.[3] It receives them from abroad by post, all through a legal license.”\n\nSuddenly he studied the policeman who was taking notes. Pointing at the magazine with the profile on Sa‘d Zaghloul, he asked, “How is it that you claim ignorance about Sa‘d Zaghloul?”\n\n“I don’t know anything about your book entitled Sa‘d Zaghloul. As for knowing something about the man, it goes without saying: everyone who lives in this part of the world knows something about him, probably even you.”\n\nHe was silent and didn’t respond, and the investigation was over. Almost four hours had gone by since they first arrived. The chief turned toward me and said, “Come with us, please.”\n\nI watched the policemen go up to shake my father’s hand as if they were apologizing. I watched as my father went out to perform his evening prayers. I watched my sister in the courtyard, bawling as much as her three years would allow.\n\nI left with the policemen.\n\n5.\n\nI had no prior conception about the detention jail. I imagined at least that I’d find a dilapidated bunk. I found nothing but a filthy blanket thrown on the floor of a filthy cell. The walls may have been clean, but the floor was rank and stank of a rotten smell.\n\nBefore I entered my cell, the policeman told me, “There’s no toilet in there, so if you want to go to the bathroom, go now.”\n\nI thanked him and went in. As soon as he shut the door, I thought I would suffocate. My body shivered from the rotten smell. One a few minutes passed before I banged on the door.\n\nThe policeman came and asked, “What do you want?”\n\n“You told me there was no toilet inside the cell. But I would like to inform you that, in reality, there’s no cell inside this big toilet.\n\nI thought he’d be angry, but instead he smiled. He only said, “No matter. Don’t pay any attention to it!”\n\n“Allow me to sit in the hall until morning, if it’s any better there.”\n\nHe said, “It’s forbidden,” and closed the door again.\n\n6.\n\nDuring my short visit to the holding jail, I learned many things. I learned how to wait patiently, sitting for hours without smoking. (And me, who smokes forty cigarettes a day!) They’d bought me cigarettes, but took away my box of matches, saying they’d light my cigarettes whenever I wanted. But whenever I asked, they refused, saying, “We don’t have any instructions that say you can smoke.” As if smoking were also a danger to state security!\n\nI learned something else—that it’s forbidden to detain watches, neckties and pens along with the prisoner.\n\nWhen I told the policeman, “Don’t worry—I won’t kill myself,” he said, “I don’t get what goes on inside your head.”\n\nI also learned how to kill time on the road to morning by reading a single newspaper over and over.\n\nI sat on the filthy blanket, leaning my back against the wall, trying to doze, all the while expecting the bedbugs and fleas to launch a surprise attack.\n\nI began to think, not about prison, but about what I would write since, along with 50 other “documents,” they’d seized two articles I was preparing to publish in al-Mirsad. As compensation, they’d brought me here, to a place where inspiration descends upon the imprisoned writer at least one hundred times a day!\n\nThe two bright lights that illuminated the cell were left on throughout the night. It seems that their lights ruined the fleas’ plan of attack, since they didn’t launch one.\n\nIn the locked door, I saw my mother and father and my sister, crying her three-year-old eyes out. Then two sad eyes appeared, asking me, “Why did you go? Didn’t I tell you this would happen?”\n\nThe hours went by, one after the other. The two eyes sat up with me until the sun came up.\n\n7.\n\nThe sun’s rays crept through the window at the top of the wall. I knocked on the door in the hopes that the policeman might light a cigarette for me. But he refused, saying that he didn’t have any matches on him. A Yemeni man was passing by us just then and heard our conversation and stopped to light my cigarette. The policeman told him sternly, “Get out of here!”\n\nHe shut the door again. I knocked on it again, demanding to see the chief inspector. I was told that he hadn’t arrived yet. Then I asked for a light and was told, “It’s against the rules.”\n\nI banged on the door more and they told me the same thing. I kept banging and they kept telling me. Finally, my patience ran out and I kicked on the door with force. Suddenly, three men appeared led by the station officer. He began to scream at me while I calmly asked him to inform me why they’d detained me and why they refused to allow me to smoke. He told me that he also didn’t know.\n\nAfter a few minutes, they brought me a piece of bread, a cup of tea, and some food prepared to make your whole body gag. Though I was hungry, I spared the bread, the food and the tea, or perhaps I spared my stomach when I refused entry to this food! Who knows? Perhaps this same serving awaits the next guest?\n\n8.\n\nAround 10 AM, the door opened. One of the interrogators took me to the chief inspector’s office. On the way, he lit a cigarette for me. As soon as I entered the room, I registered my complaint about how well I’d been treated. I insisted that I did not deserve such humane treatment nor all the politeness. The inspector and interrogator showed their surprise that I had not been allowed to smoke. They promised to rescind that rule. I understood, from “rescind that rule” that I would be returned to that cell, but I didn’t care, as long as I was permitted to read and smoke.\n\nBefore he began the interrogation, the chief inspector watched me smoke and asked if I’d eaten. I replied in the negative, and explained my reasons for sparing the food. He asked, “Would you drink a cup of coffee with me?”\n\nI gratefully accepted the invitation. The interrogation began to resemble the previous one. I was asked to say the name of the person from whom I’d purchased or acquired this or that book that had been seized. My apologies go out to those friends from whom I’d borrowed books and whose names I mentioned!\n\nThere were new questions: for which newspapers have I written? For which paper did I write for nowadays? Did a receive a salary from the Ministry of Education?[4] How much did I earn per article? I answered every question. I could have refused, though there would have been no point in rendering secret what was not.\n\nI hereby swear that the chief inspector and his assistant were polite toward me, as were the policemen who brought me back home. But I cannot say the same for any of those from whom I asked for a light or to meet the inspector.\n\nEventually, I was released. When I reached the souk in Khudayra, I bought a bouquet of lilies and got a shave.\n\nI was fortunate to have stayed one night as a guest at the detention prison. I can still recall the disgusting odor, the filthy blanket, the food that makes you cringe. I say all this to communicate to the authorities at the prison that this state of affairs does not encourage guests to return for other visits unless, like me, they were searching for something to write about that might entertain readers.\n\nBut Sirs: not all people are writers or journalists. Most of them are human beings, plain and simple. It’s my wish that at least the health of the guests and tenants would be cared for. For by these guests, you earn your wages. Despite everything they are the source of your livelihood, so take care of that source, and God will take care of you.\n\nFinally, thanks are in order. Thanks go out to all those who gave me this opportunity. Thanks to them, I learned things I had not known before. Thanks to them for giving me the material for this piece!\n\n————\n\n[1] In the wake of the 1952 revolution, the Egyptian daily al-Ahram became the semi-official mouthpiece of the Nasserist state. al-Hayat is a Lebanese daily, and al-Sayyad, a Lebanese political weekly. Ruz al-Yusuf, mentioned below, is a popular political, social and cultural weekly published in Cairo.\n\n[2] Egyptian jurist, politician and hero of Egypt’s 1919 Revolution. As leader of the Wafd party, Zaghloul dominated Parliament from 1923 until his death in 1927.\n\n[3] Founded by Mapam to provide Arabic-language books to Palestinian citizens of Israel. See Sabri Jiryis, The Arabs in Israel, 127.\n\n[4] Hussein wrote for the two Arabic-language organs of the Mapam Party, the monthly literary and political journal al-Fajr, and the weekly al-Mirsad. He also published, under pseudonyms (such as Abu Iyas) in the Communist Party publications, such as the literary magazine al-Jadid (edited by Samih al-Qasim) and the newspaper, al-Ittihad. His first job was as teacher in the Arab school of a neighboring village.\n\nI will see thousands of policemen that day. They have all been imported from somewhere else. Our local policemen—DC’s Metropolitan Police Department—have distanced themselves from this action. Some cops in fancy body armor lounge on the grass, like cosplayers at a Marvel comics convention. Others stand shoulder to shoulder in tight battle formations under the hot afternoon sun.\n\nUnlike the soldiers in the street, and unlike the thousands of protesters who are converging on the place, the policemen do not wear face masks. Not one. It’s almost as they had been given an order by commanders who believe that masks are for weaklings. It reminds me of what happened here yesterday, when Trump’s office ordered these same federal police to attack the crowd with tear gas and billy clubs. It was the mildly-named Park Police who viciously cleared the street so that Trump could march over to a local church and stand briefly, upside-down Bible in hand, for a photo opportunity. The point of that exercise was to demonstrate “dominance” over protesters, as Trump put it on a phone call with governors earlier in the day. Gassing peaceful citizens is one way to show dominance. Not wearing a mask is another. The unmasked police appear to be on board every step of the way.\n\nDemonstrating means to show.\n\nIt is the middle of a work day but already more than a thousand people have gathered along H Street, which runs parallel to the park. The crowd is Black and White and Brown. It is young and old. It is poor and it is middle class. In a deeply segregated city like this one, this is the most integrated place you can find. Besides the numbers, what you notice is the voices. They are loud and angry, but also full of life and joy. They’ve been singing for a long time already, but they are not tired of it. I lock up my bicycle, find my friends, and join in. We all do:\n\nNo Justice, No Peace\n\nNo Racist Police\n\nIt goes on for a minute, then a young man with a bullhorn calls out:\n\nShow me what democracy looks like!\n\nAnd we answer:\n\nThis is what democracy looks like!\n\nThis chant eventually dwindles, at which point the man with the bullhorn pivots:\n\nSay his name!\n\nAnd we answer:\n\nGeorge Floyd!\n\nHe shouts:\n\nSay her name!\n\nAnd we answer:\n\nBreonna Taylor!\n\nThere is power in calling out the names of one’s murdered brothers and sisters. This ritual is one of the most original innovations that organizers from Black Lives Matter have given to American protest culture. It adds a funereal air to the event, and reminds us of the brutal fact that what brings us together is the loss of life.\n\nWe declaim the names of victims for minutes on end, but it doesn’t get old. For many of us, this is how the names come to be part of our active consciousness. We say their names and picture them, not as death statistics, but as individuals who lived and were loved. We shout their names and sing them—angry about what has been taken away from us, but also joyfully insistent that their lives are remembered. There is magic in the ritual: to affirm that a life matters even after it has been taken is also an affirmation about our own lives. If we believe Black lives matter, then we can say all lives matter.\n\nFinally, the man with the bull horn calls out, I can’t breathe! We fall in beside him and shout those words over and over, remembering not only that George Floyd said these words as he was being killed, but so did Eric Garner, when he was choked to death by New York Policemen in July 2014. And then, the man calls out again: Say his name!\n\nSaying their names is an occasion to acknowledge what we have lost and to mourn that loss. It is an occasion to reaffirm our love of life as well as an occasion to focus our anger on the system that makes Black life in this country so precarious and expendable. The names are a salve and a weapon. It feels right to say them over and over again. If they remain remembered, maybe we will too.\n\nAnd then, everyone takes a knee. Heads down, eyes on the ground, we sit in mournful silence for a minute. Then another. The only sounds are helicopters chopping the air in the distance and a far off siren. The silence goes on for a couple more minutes, everyone lost in their own meditative state. The silence is as powerful as any slogan I’ve ever heard, and the imagination fills the void with more words than could ever be said.\n\nSuddenly, we’re putting our hands in the air and chanting again, Hands up, Don’t Shoot! And now we’re walking, east on H Street, then north on 14th Street. By now, our ranks have swelled into the thousands. Everyone is wearing a mask. Everyone is doing their best to maintain a foot or more distance from their neighbors. Lots of people are carrying signs. Most contain direct messages:\n\nJustice for Floyd\n\nBlack Lives Matter.\n\nDefund the police.\n\nAbolish the Police.\n\nSilence is Violence.\n\nSome are playful:\n\nRoses are red / Doritos are savory / The US prison system / Is organized slavery.\n\nMany are blunt, but no less effective:\n\nACAB\n\nFuck 12\n\nOrganizers walk through the crowd, handing out bottles of water, snack bars, and hand sanitizer. People are wearing shirts with logos, faces and names: BLM, Palestine, Tupac, Standing Rock. The leaders of the action are way off in the front, leading songs with their bullhorns. But in the back, groups are launching their own songs. There’s news that the Minnesota Attorney General has finally placed charges against Floyd’s murderer. No word about the other three policemen who abetted the crime. Behind us, a group of boisterous teenage Black girls starts up:\n\nThree more to go!\n\nAnd some of them answer:\n\nConvict all four!\n\nAfter a few minutes, there’s hundreds of us singing the new chant. We turn west on U Street, and eventually south on 16th Street."
