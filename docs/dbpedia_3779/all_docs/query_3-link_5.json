This transition includes the creation of an investment fund for the company, with the club's value being deposited into this investment fund in exchange for transferring ownership to it. The aim is to achieve sustainable returns for the company. The Public Investment Fund will hold 75 percent of the company's ownership, while the remaining 25 percent will be owned by a non-profit institution. This is part of the investment and privatization project initiated by His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the crown prince and prime minister."
