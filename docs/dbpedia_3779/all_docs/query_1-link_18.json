        "text": "Threats to Cornell Jewish Living Center reported to FBI\n\nThreats to Cornell University’s Jewish community were reported to the FBI as a possible hate crime, the university’s president said Sunday in a letter to the Cornell community.\n\n“Earlier today, a series of horrendous, antisemitic messages threatening violence to our Jewish community” was posted on a site not connected to Cornell, university President Martha E. Pollack wrote.\n\nThe threats specifically mentioned the campus address of the Center for Jewish Living, the letter said, and Cornell Police notified the FBI of a potential hate crime.\n\nUniversity police were present at the living center and will continue to be on site to offer protection, Pollack said.\n\nHostage negotiations stall over Hamas demand for fuel deliveries to Gaza\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nTalks to free some of the hostages held by militant group Hamas stalled over Israel's unwillingness to send fuel to Gaza, its base, and Hamas' objection to guaranteeing it would release a large number of foreign captives, according to a former U.S. official with knowledge of the ongoing negotiations over the release of some of the estimated 230 hostages.\n\n“Hamas has been insistent on receiving fuel,” said the former U.S. official, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to talk publicly. “The Israel and U.S. side, plus other countries, want a large batch of their citizens released.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nPalestinian Red Crescent said it received 24 aid trucks in Gaza today\n\n“Our teams in Gaza received 24 trucks from the Egyptian Red Crescent through the Rafah crossing this evening, containing food supplies and medical necessities,\" the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said today.\n\nIn total, the organization said it has received 118 trucks containing food and medical supplies.\n\nBut trucks containing fuel are still not allowed to cross into Gaza, the organization said.\n\nIsraeli army strikes military building in Syria\n\nThe IDF struck a military building in Syrian territory, it said in a statement today.\n\n\"A short while ago, in response to launches from Syria toward Israeli territory earlier Sunday, an IDF aircraft struck military infrastructure in Syrian territory,\" the statement said.\n\nReporters Without Borders investigates Oct. 13 raid that killed a Reuters journalist\n\nReuters journalist Issam Abdallah was killed Oct. 13 when Israel launched a bombing raid across the border into Lebanon that hit a group of seven reporters stationed in Alma Al-Chaab, Lebanon, on the border. They were recording ongoing aggressions between Hezbollah and the IDF.\n\nAccording to an investigation into the strikes by Reporters Against Borders, a pair of Al-Jazeera journalists recorded an Israeli helicopter flying over the border just an hour before the bombings. The investigation claims the helicopter was locating the journalists.\n\nAn hour later, a journalist with the Lebanese TV station LBCI reported in a video that he could see a similar helicopter flying overhead. At 6:02 p.m., Reuters broadcast the bombardment live.\n\nThirty-seven seconds later, the same group of journalists was targeted by a second attack, Reporters Without Borders concluded in its investigation, noting that the two bombardments were of different intensity and that the first one killed Abdallah.\n\nThe second bomb hit the Al-Jazeera vehicle next to him and injured his colleagues, the investigation found. The attacks came from east of where the journalists were stationed, in the direction of the Israeli border.\n\nReporters Without Borders said, based on its investigation, that the attacks must have been targeted, saying two strikes in the same place in a short time could have indicated that.\n\nIt said it would have been \"impossible\" to mistake the reporters for fighters because of their heightened position and the fact that they had been there for an hour.\n\nNetanyahu invokes 'Amalek' narrative in speech about expanding ground operation in Gaza\n\nNetanyahu invoked the \"Amalek\" narrative in a speech about the country's expanding its ground operation in Gaza yesterday.\n\n“You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible,\" Netanyahu said, based on a translation. \"And we do remember, and we are fighting. Our brave troops and combatants who are now in Gaza or around Gaza, and in all other regions in Israel, are joining this chain of Jewish heroes, a chain that has started 3,000 years ago from Joshua ben Nun, until the heroes of 1948, the Six-Day War, the ’73 October War and all other wars in this country.\"\n\nAmalek is an ancient biblical nation that was in Canaan, which was a land in the southern Levant. The Amalekites attacked the Jewish people after the exodus from Egypt, and \"they are seen as the archetypal enemy of the Jews,\" according to Chabad.org.\n\nNetanyahu's use of the narrative drew online criticism because of scripture suggesting that Amalekites must not be spared.\n\nGaza receives largest aid shipment since the war began\n\nNearly three dozen trucks entered Gaza today in the largest aid convoy since the war began, but humanitarian workers said the assistance still fell desperately short of needs after thousands of people broke into warehouses to take flour and basic hygiene products.\n\nIsrael has allowed only a trickle of aid to enter. A spokesperson at the Rafah crossing, Wael Abo Omar, told The Associated Press that 33 trucks of aid entered the only border crossing from Egypt today.\n\nIsrael says it hit Hezbollah targets in Lebanon\n\nAfter launches toward the Israeli territory from Lebanon earlier today, an IDF aircraft struck targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon, the IDF said in a statement.\n\nInfrastructure for directing terrorism and other military infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah were struck.\n\nPalestinians ‘didn’t deserve’ to die, but Israel has ‘a right to’ beat Hamas, NSA Sullivan says\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan expressed his condolences on Sunday programs for the thousands of Palestinians who have died in the war while and defended Israeli military action after ground troops entered Gaza.\n\n“There have been deaths of thousands of Palestinian civilians in this conflict, and that is an absolute tragedy,” Sullivan said on ABC News’ “This Week.” “Those people did not deserve to die. Those people deserved to live lives of peace and sanctity and dignity.”\n\nAsked on CBS’ “Face the Nation” about the Biden administration’s message after Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the U.N. that pausing Israel’s heavy bombardment must be considered amid calls for at least humanitarian assistance, Sullivan said: “Well, what a lot of people are calling for is just a stop to Israeli military action against terrorists, period — just stop, no more.\n\n“Israel cannot go after terrorists who conducted this largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and who continue to fire rockets and continue to attack Israel,” he said.\n\n“We have taken the position that Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist attacks,” he added. “That is different from what Secretary Blinken spoke about, which was a humanitarian pause, a pause in the fighting, for example, so that there’s a period of time where there can be safe passage of hostages.”\n\nEmergency U.N. Security Council meeting set for tomorrow after Israel announces expanded ground operations in Gaza\n\nThe U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow afternoon following Israel’s announcement that it has expanded ground operations in Gaza.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates requested the meeting yesterday to push the council to support an immediate cease-fire.\n\nCouncil members have failed to reach consensus as resolutions calling for either a pause or a cease-fire were knocked down.\n\nIn a statement, the UAE’s foreign ministry “underlined the importance of the protection of civilians, according to international humanitarian law, international treaties for the protection of civilians and human rights, and the need to ensure that they are not targeted during conflict.”\n\nThe council’s failure sent the matter to the U.N. General Assembly, where 120 countries voted in favor of calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce between Israel and Hamas. The resolution passed with only 14 countries voting against, including the U.S. and Israel.\n\n“I regret that instead of a critically needed humanitarian pause supported by the international community, Israel has intensified its military operations,” said U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who described the situation in Gaza as “growing more desperate by the hours.”\n\n“The world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe taking place before our eyes,” he added, urging all those with responsibility “to step back from the brink.”\n\nU.S. and Egyptian presidents discuss humanitarian assistance to Gaza in call\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi discussed humanitarian aid to innocent civilians in Gaza in a phone call today, the White House said in a statement.\n\nBiden expressed appreciation for El-Sissi and Egypt's efforts to get humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza.\n\nThe pair also agreed on speeding the process of getting more assistance and resources into Gaza starting today and then continuing.\n\nIn the call, they talked about the importance of protecting civilian lives while respecting international humanitarian law, the White House statement said. They also discussed ensuring that Palestinians in Gaza are not being displaced to Egypt or elsewhere.\n\nBiden then informed El-Sissi of U.S. efforts to ensure that others in the region are not expanding the conflict in Gaza and to ensure the hostages in Gaza are released.\n\nBiden and El-Sissi agreed that they will work together to \"set the conditions for a durable and sustainable peace in the Middle East to include the establishment of a Palestinian state,\" the statement said.\n\nMore IDF forces going into Gaza this week, former Israeli national security adviser says\n\nMore IDF forces will go into Gaza this week, and there will be deeper ground attacks against Hamas, said Yaakov Amidror, a former national security adviser to Netanyahu.\n\n“We are approaching the whole operation very slowly to minimize casualties on our side and the Palestinian side,” Amidror, retired major general, said today in a telephone call.\n\nAmidror, who receives regular briefings from Israeli officials, said the IDF is working to defeat Hamas commanders in senior and mid-level leadership.\n\nIsrael calls on Russia to act after reports a plane was stormed\n\nIsrael called on Russia to act after reports and videos of the storming of a plane that had landed from Tel Aviv circulated.\n\n\"The State of Israel takes seriously attempts to harm Israeli citizens and Jews everywhere,\" the prime minister's office and the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a joint announcement.\n\nThe statement said two offices, in conjunction with the National Security Headquarters, \"are monitoring the development of events in southern Russia in the Dagestan province.\"\n\n\"Israel expects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they may be and to act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis,\" the statement said.\n\nAlex Ben-Zvi, Israel's ambassador to Russia, is working with Russian authorities to \"ensure the safety of Israelis and Jews there,\" it said.\n\nZelenskyy slams Russia's 'antisemitism and hatred toward other nations'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called out Russia in a statement today after videos circulated appearing to show mobs breaking into an airport and searching for Israeli citizens who had just arrived on a flight from Tel Aviv.\n\nHe said the videos from Makhachkala, Russia, were \"appalling\" in the statement on X.\n\n\"This is not an isolated incident in Makhachkala, but rather part of Russia’s widespread culture of hatred toward other nations, which is propagated by state television, pundits, and authorities,\" Zelenskyy wrote.\n\nHe said both Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian foreign minister have histories of using antisemitic language.\n\n\"For Russian propaganda talking heads on official television, hate rhetoric is routine. Even the most recent Middle East escalation prompted antisemitic statements from Russian ideologists,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe concluded: \"Russian antisemitism and hatred toward other nations are systemic and deeply rooted. Hatred is what drives aggression and terror. We must all work together to oppose hatred.\"\n\nICC prosecutor visits Egypt-Gaza border\n\nInternational Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan visited the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt today and posted a video on X saying he hopes to visit the Gaza Strip and Israel while he is in the region.\n\nHe added that humanitarian relief supplies being sent to civilians should not be impeded.\n\nDozens arriving at al-Shifa Hospital after bombing of the Al Shati camp, Palestinian Health Ministry says\n\nDozens of people arrived at al-Shifa Hospital as a result of continuous bombing of the Al Shati refugee camp, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.\n\nImages shared by the Health Ministry showed children at the hospital, with some lying on the floor and others covered in dust and blood.\n\nIsrael says it killed Hamas militants near Erez crossing\n\nThe IDF said today it killed “a number of terrorists exiting a shaft of a tunnel in the Gaza Strip” near the Erez crossing, one of two main crossings in and out of Gaza for civilians.\n\nIt said its soldiers confronted Hamas gunmen but did not specify how many died or were injured.\n\nIsraeli aid to be considered on House floor in stand-alone bill this week\n\nand\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said aid to Israel will be considered on the House floor in a stand-alone measure this week and expressed confidence that it would pass. He resisted Biden’s call for Congress to provide a broader package that also includes aid to Ukraine.\n\n“We’re going to move a stand-alone Israel funding bill this week in the House — I know our colleagues, our Republican colleagues in the Senate, have a similar measure,” Johnson said in an interview on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures,” adding that he believes there will be bipartisan support for the measure.\n\n“There are lots of things going on around the world that we have to address, and we will,” Johnson said. “But right now, what’s happening in Israel takes the immediate attention, and I think we’ve got to separate that and get it through.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nNetanyahu issues apology after post blames Israeli officials for Hamas attack\n\nNetanyahu issued an apology today after an overnight post on X seemed to blame chief members of Israel’s military and security for the Hamas attack on Oct. 7.

Ron DeSantis, a Republican presidential candidate, today defended his call to ban pro-Palestinian groups from state colleges as Israel expands its ground offensive in Gaza.\n\nIn an interview on “Meet the Press,” NBC News’ Kristen Welker asked DeSantis to respond to his Republican 2024 rival Vivek Ramaswamy, who insisted that such a move would violate First Amendment rights.\n\nDeSantis pushed back: “This is not cancel culture.”\n\n“This group, they themselves said in the aftermath of the Hamas attack that they don’t just stand in solidarity, that they are part of this Hamas movement,” he said. “And so, yeah, you have a right to go out and demonstrate, but you can’t provide material support to terrorism.”\n\nHe accused pro-Palestinian groups on campuses of having “linked themselves to Hamas.”\n\n“And so we absolutely decertified them. They should not get one red cent of taxpayer dollars,” DeSantis said.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nand\n\nBiden spoke with Netanyahu by phone today, the White House and Netanyahu's office confirmed.\n\nThe two leaders discussed the “developments in Gaza” and underscored Israel’s right to defend itself “in a manner consistent with internal humanitarian law that prioritizes the protection of civilians.”\n\nThey also discussed the efforts to release hostages, including unaccounted-for Americans, and the need to “immediately and significantly increase the flow of humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of civilians in Gaza.”\n\nBiden and Netanyahu will remain in touch directly and through their national security teams.\n\nIsraeli human rights groups urge international community to stop ‘wave of settler violence’ in West Bank\n\nA coalition of 30 human rights groups and NGOs in Israel pleaded for the international community to stop a wave of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\nToday's statement said the violence is leading to \"the forcible transfer of Palestinian communities in the West Bank.\"\n\nSince the Oct. 7 incursion, Israeli settlers have been “exploiting the lack of public attention to the West Bank” to “escalate their campaign of violent attacks in an attempt to forcibly transfer Palestinian communities,” the statement said. It comes as much of the war has focused public attention on the Gaza Strip.\n\nSo far, 13 herding communities have been displaced and seven Palestinians have been killed by settlers since the war began, the statement said.\n\n“With grave concern and with a clear understanding of the political landscape, we recognize that the only way to stop this forcible transfer in the West Bank is a clear, strong and direct intervention by the international community,” the statement, signed by groups including Rabbis for Human Rights, Amnesty International Israel and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said.\n\nIran and its proxy forces loom over Israel-Hamas war\n\nHAIFA, Israel — While concern over the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip mounts, another undercurrent of alarm is growing in Washington and other Western capitals: Israel’s bombardment could spread into a wider regional war — one involving regional superpower Iran or its proxy forces.\n\nOn Sunday, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on X that Israel had “crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to take action.”\n\nMany experts believe there is little desire in Washington and Tehran for a regional conflict. But the scope for miscalculation is huge, and the intensity of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which, according to Palestinian health officials, has killed more than 8,000 people, including thousands of civilians and children, could easily push the situation spiraling out of control.\n\n“There’s a real risk of escalation,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nPregnant women in Gaza given primitive ‘emergency delivery kits’\n\nWith ambulances and hospitals running out of fuel, pregnant women in Gaza have been given primitive \"emergency delivery kits\" for when they go into labor.\n\nLaila Baker, United Nations Population Fund regional director for Arab States, said the international agency is pushing for humanitarian access to be able to help women and other civilians.\n\n\"Put yourself in the shoes of any woman who should be experiencing one of the most joyous moments of her life, and instead she's in fear of death,\" Baker said.\n\nLeaflets in Gaza instruct people on how turn themselves in to IDF\n\nThe IDF is distributing leaflets in Gaza instructing people on how to turn themselves in to the Israeli military.\n\n“Hamas leaders are exploiting you. They and their families are in safe places while you die in vain,” the leaflets said.\n\nThe instructions say to \"remove all military gear,\" \"raise your hands,\" \"wave white rags\" and \"not to bring food or water with you, we will take care of that.\"\n\nNorwegian prime minister criticizes Israel's response to Hamas\n\nHELSINKI — Norway’s prime minister says Israel’s reaction to Hamas’ attack exceeds the rules of international law on proportionality.\n\n“It says in international law that (reaction to such an attack) must be proportionate,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told public broadcaster NRK today.\n\n“Civilians must be taken into account, and humanitarian law is fully aware of that. I believe that the line has now been far exceeded” by Israel, he said, adding that his primary concern is that emergency aid is not getting into the Gaza Strip.\n\nNorway on Friday voted in favor of the United Nations resolution calling for a “humanitarian truce” leading to a cessation of hostilities in Gaza.\n\n“It’s a catastrophic situation, and I believe it is clearly in violation of what we call the rules of war or humanitarian law,” he said.\n\nIsraeli ministers advance bill to designate individuals as 'terrorists'\n\nIsrael’s Ministerial Committee for Legislation has advanced an amendment to the country’s terror laws that will allow the state to designate individuals, not just organizations, as \"terrorists.\"\n\nMinister of Defense Yoav Gallant and Minister of Justice Yariv Levin said in a statement that the amendment was designed to “thwart the financing of individuals operating in various organizations, and in particular the Hamas terrorist organization.” The bill will also “address the issues of recruitment, financing, and the transfer of funds for terrorist purposes,” the statement added.\n\nThe expansion is proposed as an update to a 2016 counterterrorism law that human rights groups have warned is routinely used to shut down Palestinian civil society groups, as well as militant organizations.\n\nThailand evacuates thousands of workers from Israel as it awaits answers on hostages\n\nTEL AVIV — As the war rages, Thailand's Embassy is racing to evacuate thousands of citizens, mostly agricultural workers, while it pushes for answers about the dozens of Thai nationals feared taken hostage by Hamas.\n\n\"Thailand doesn't have anything (to do) with this conflict, but we got affected a lot,\" Pannabha Chandraramya, Thailand’s ambassador in Israel, told NBC News on Sunday. At least 24 Thai nationals were killed on Oct. 7, and at least 19 have been confirmed to have been taken hostage — with the number feared to be higher.\n\nMuch of Israel's agriculture sector relies on labor from Thai workers, with Chandraramya saying that at least 6,000 people, mostly workers, have already been evacuated. The goal is to evacuate as many as 30,000 people, with two to three flights running daily, she said.\n\nOne worker waiting for a flight to Thailand at a makeshift outpost for the Thai embassy said he had no plans to return to Israel after the war. He said he was too \"scared\" to come back and will find work elsewhere.\n\nChandraramya said the evacuations could have a serious impact on the agricultural industry in Israel. \"In the peaceful times, we always say that all the vegetables and fruit that you eat pass through the hands of Thai workers,\" she said.\n\nRep. Jayapal: ‘There are racists within the Netanyahu government’\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., says the human toll of the war is behind her call for a cease-fire. This morning on “Meet the Press,\" she said that failing to call out violations of international law during Israel's siege of Gaza is a double standard and will diminish the United States' moral authority.\n\n\"There are racists within the Netanyahu government, and there are racist policies that Israel has been carrying out,\" Jayapal said. \"I think it is important for us to recognize that we need to be able to criticize the policies of Israel's government and not be called antisemitic.\"\n\nPope Francis renews calls for hostage release, cease-fire\n\nPope Francis this morning called for a cease-fire in the war between Israel and Hamas and renewed an appeal for the release of hostages held in Gaza.\n\n\"Let no one abandon the possibility of stopping the weapons,” he said at his weekly blessing in St. Peter’s Square.\n\nReferring to \"the grave situation in Palestine and Israel,” he said \"in Gaza, in particular, let there be room to guarantee humanitarian aid and may the hostages be freed immediately.\"\n\nHe added: \"We say ‘cease-fire, cease-fire.’ Brothers and sisters, stop! War is always a defeat, always.\"\n\nSome internet connectivity in Gaza resumes\n\nSome internet connectivity in Gaza has resumed after a near-total telecommunication blackout Friday.\n\nNetblocks, a U.K. company that tracks global internet access, said last night that some internet providers were back online, though general connection speeds there are far below normal.\n\nPaltel, one of the largest providers in Gaza, said on its Facebook page this morning that it had been hastily repairing infrastructure that had been destroyed by Israeli bombing Friday.\n\nHusam Mekdad, a telecommunication worker in Gaza, told NBC News that phone and internet access had somewhat resumed in southern Gaza but that it was limited in the north.\n\nPalestinian Red Crescent: 10 aid trucks make way into Gaza\n\nTen aid trucks with food and medical essentials from the Egyptian Red Crescent have passed into Gaza through the Rafah crossing, the Palestinian Red Crescent confirmed to NBC News.\n\nFuel has also been allowed to enter the strip for the first time since Israel announced a full blockade in the coastal enclave.\n\nBefore the war, 200 aid trucks were received in Gaza per day.\n\nElectricity and production are limited in Gaza, which has been under blockade by both Israel and Egypt since 2007.\n\nPalestinians skeptical of Israeli assurances they will be allowed to return to north Gaza\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank — Despite assurances from IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari yesterday, many Palestinians remain anxious about Israel's assertions that those who evacuate north Gaza will be able to return eventually.\n\nMustafa Barghouti, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, said he believes Netanyahu's original plan was to evict Gazans into the Sinai Peninsula. When Egyptian leaders began to push back, Barghouti believes a \"plan B\" was embraced to annex north Gaza once residents fled south.\n\n\"Did Israel ever allow anybody back? Did they allow any of the Palestinian refugees who have been ethnically cleansed in 1948 back? None,\" Barghouti said.\n\nIsrael has a \"very clear record of not allowing people to come back home,\" he added.\n\nIn renewing the push for Palestinians to move south, Hagari yesterday called the move \"a temporary measure.\"\n\n\"Moving back to northern Gaza will be possible once the intense hostilities end,\" he said in a video on X.\n\n2nd U.S. aircraft carrier group moves into Mediterranean\n\nThe USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier and its strike group has moved through the Strait of Gibraltar, putting two American carriers in the Mediterranean Sea, a rare sight in recent years.\n\nThe USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group is already in the eastern Mediterranean, part of a buildup of forces as the U.S. supports Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nThe Eisenhower sailed into the Mediterranean on Saturday and is slated to move through the Suez Canal to the U.S. Central Command region as the American forces expand their presence in the Middle East to deter Iran and its proxy militant groups from trying to widen the war.\n\nU.N. peacekeeper injured after mortars hit base in Lebanon\n\nA peacekeeper is in stable condition after a mortar hit a base near the village of Houla in south Lebanon last night, according to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).\n\nThe agency said it was attacked twice yesterday, once at 10 p.m. at the Houla base and earlier in the day when a shell hit UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura.\n\n\"UNIFIL expresses serious concern over these two attacks on our troops who are tirelessly working 24/7 to restore stability in southern Lebanon and de-escalate this perilous situation,\" it said.\n\nAn investigation has been launched into both incidents.

James Stavridis breaks down Israel’s ground operation in Gaza and weighs in on the risk of escalation.\n\nDoctors Without Borders calls Gaza strikes an 'atrocity'\n\nWorld leaders' actions to prevent violence in Gaza are “too weak” and “too slow,” Doctors Without Borders said today.\n\nReiterating pleas from other global humanitarian organizations and several international leaders, the health organization called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.\n\n\"The bombing by the Israeli forces has intensified to a degree not seen until now: Northern Gaza is being razed to the ground,\" the group said.\n\n“The international community must take stronger action to urge Israel to stop the bloodshed,” the NGO added, describing the bombing campaign as an “atrocity” unleashing “indiscriminate violence on helpless people.”\n\nThere are more injured people than the hospitals can handle, the statement said. It added that the Israeli military's orders to evacuate hospitals in Gaza City were not possible because they were full of patients and being used as shelters for internally displaced people.\n\nAt least 10 aid trucks expected to cross into Gaza today\n\nAt least 10 trucks are expected to enter the Gaza Strip today, a Palestinian Red Crescent spokesperson in Gaza told NBC News.\n\nThe 10 trucks are waiting at the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, and 20 more are stationed at the Al-Oja crossing, Egypt's border with Israel. It is not known if all waiting vehicles will be allowed to enter, but at least 10 would be allowed to pass through \"for sure,\" the spokesperson told NBC News.\n\nPrior to Oct. 7, Gaza received aid from 200 convoys per day. Only 80 trucks total have passed through since the outbreak of the war, according to the UNRWA.\n\nWHO restores contact with team in Gaza\n\nThe head of the World Health Organization says the group has reconnected with its team in Gaza after the enclave's connectivity blackout.\n\n“They said the last two nights were extremely tense with a lot of airstrikes — without fuel, water, electricity, connectivity and safe shelter to evacuate to,” Tedros Adhanom wrote on X.\n\n“As with everyone in Gaza, they and their families are not safe,” he added, reiterating calls for the protection of health facilities and humanitarian workers and an immediate cease-fire.\n\nHe added that hospitals in the enclave remain overwhelmed with patients and are low on medical supplies.\n\nPhotos: Palestinians mourn their dead\n\nPalestinian health officials said today that more than 8,000 have died in Gaza since the conflict with Israel began, and in the southern city of Khan Younis today, the grief was palpable.\n\nIsrael has crossed 'red lines' that could 'force everyone to take action,' Iran president says\n\nIsrael’s “crimes” in Gaza may “force everyone to take action,” Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on X today.\n\nReferring to Israel as a “Zionist regime,” Raisi said in a post in English that the country had “crossed the red lines.”\n\n“Washington asks us to not do anything, but they keep giving widespread support to Israel,” he said, referring to U.S. warnings about Iran and its proxy forces taking action in response to the IDF's ground incursion.\n\nIran, which provides funding and military support to the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah, had previously warned Israel of a regional escalation if ground troops entered the Gaza Strip.\n\nPalestinian Red Crescent says Israel asked it to evacuate hospital immediately\n\nand\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said today it has been told to leave its hospital immediately under threat of bombardment following continuous airstrikes in the vicinity.\n\n\"Two phone calls were received, with a clear and direct threat, that the hospital must be evacuated at once, otherwise PRCS holds full responsibility for the lives of everyone inside the hospital,\" the organization said in a statement.\n\nIsraeli forces have previously said that people in the hospital should evacuate south, but the Palestinian Red Crescent said it would continue to provide shelter and lifesaving services to civilians in north Gaza.\n\nEvacuation of hundreds of patients could also pose logistical challenges, as ambulances are running out of fuel, with at least three entirely out of commission.\n\nNetanyahu issues rare apology for blaming security chiefs\n\nTEL AVIV — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has issued a rare apology after his message blaming security and intelligence chiefs for failing to prevent Hamas' attack caused widespread anger.\n\nNetanyahu caused uproar last night when he posted that \"at no stage was\" he \"warned of war intentions on the part of Hamas,\" instead accusing his security and intelligence leaders of telling him \"time and time again\" that the terror group had been \"deterred.\"\n\nAfter an angry backlash — both from opponents and figures within his coalition — Netanyahu deleted the post. He followed up with another message today saying, \"I was wrong,\" and that \"things I said following the press conference should not have been said and I apologize for that.\"\n\nAn array of military, espionage and political figures have accepted responsibility for their parts in failing to prevent the massacre. But while Netanyahu said today that he gives his \"full support to all the heads of the security forces,\" he has not directly apologized, despite coming under heavy criticism and pressure to do so.\n\nThousands of people broke into several warehouses belonging to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency in the Gaza Strip, the agency said in a statement. Wheat flour, hygiene materials and other basic items were taken, the statement added.\n\n“Civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza,” said Thomas White, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza. “The needs of the communities are immense, if only for basic survival, while the aid we receive is meager.\"\n\nThe warehouses contained 80 tons of mixed food commodities, mainly canned food, as well as wheat flour and sunflower oil, a statement from the World Food Program said. They were to be distributed to displaced families.\n\nFood deliveries to the Gaza Strip are being slowed by the introduction of strict checks, an ongoing ban on the distribution of fuel, and heightened demand because of the exodus of residents to the south, according to the UNRWA.\n\nIDF spokesperson evades questions on deleted Netanyahu post\n\nIDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari evaded questions about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s since-deleted X post that said he was not “warned of war intentions on the part of Hamas.”\n\nAsked at a news conference today about exactly what the military and Israel Security Agency shared with Netanyahu ahead of the Oct. 7 attacks, Hagari initially refused to answer.\n\nPressed on the subject, he said: “We at the IDF — and I’m convinced that in the ISA as well, we will do a very, very harsh and difficult debriefing with ourselves and review. And we will inform the public and we will present everything. Right now we’re fighting and we are focusing on the war. That is my answer.”\n\nU.N. Security Council schedules emergency meeting on Gaza offensive\n\nand\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting on Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza for tomorrow afternoon.\n\nCondemning the violence, the United Arab Emirates, the Arab representative on the council, called for a cease-fire.\n\nThis puts it at odds with other Security Council members such as the United States.\n\nFighter jets struck more than 450 Hamas targets, IDF says\n\nISRAEL/GAZA BORDER — Israel’s military said its fighter jets struck more than 450 Hamas targets in Gaza in the last day.\n\nTargets include operational command centers, observation posts and anti-tank missile launch posts, the Israel Defense Forces said.\n\nOperations were also underway as part of an expansion of ground activities, according to the IDF.\n\nCommunications returning in Gaza Strip\n\nISRAEL/GAZA BORDER — Some communication services have returned in the Gaza Strip, according to telecommunications provider Paltel.\n\nPaltel said early Sunday local time that crews have been working to repair damage to the internal grid network infrastructure.

Daniel Hagari said in a video posted to social media Saturday night. “We are moving to the next phase of our war against Hamas in Gaza.”\n\nDuring the video address, Hagari said Israel has been telling Gazans for two weeks to get out of the northern region and move south.\n\n“Today, we increase the urgency of that warning,” he said.\n\nHe described such a move for civilians as temporary."
