        "text": "\"A well-known wedding singer has taken a second wife, without the knowledge of his first wife, the mother of his two children.\"\n\n\"An Arab Knesset member was seen leaving one of the luxury hotels in Haifa after midnight, in the company of a young blonde in her 20s.\"\n\nThese are just two of the stories that have appeared prominently in recent weeks in the gossip column of the entertainment and leisure weekly Tirifizyun, the first such publication in Arabic in Israel. The weekly, which has been appearing in Haifa for about three months now, features a variety of juicy tales of Arab celebrities: Knesset members, public leaders, entertainers, actors, media people and intellectuals, along with stories about the sexual proclivities of Arab entertainers.\n\nThis is the first time a local Arabic weekly has published a gossip column. Titled \"Al-Hashoura Al-Amora\" (\"The Sweet Meddler\"), it is the creation of journalist Alaa Khlikhil, 27, who has a bachelor's degree in communications and art from Haifa University. The idea for the column arose about half a year ago, and was enthusiastically accepted by an Arab businessman from Haifa, who agreed to invest in the newspaper, which now has its offices in the city.\n\nAt the beginning of July this year, after a market survey, the first edition of Tirifizyun - an acronym of the words for entertainment, leisure and television - hit the streets. The cover always features an Arab celebrity or a famous international actor, and the subject-matter is exclusively entertainment and the arts as they are developing in the Arab sector in Israel. The weekly covers theater, music, dance and more, plus reports on arts and entertainment in the Arab world and the world in general. The main reason for the publication of the weekly, according to editor Khlikhil, is that \"Arab art and entertainment in Israel does not receive suitable coverage in the Israeli press.\"\n\nKhlikhil, who is from the village of Jish and moved to Haifa at the beginning of the 1990s, began to study accounting and economics, even though \"I very quickly found that I wasn't suited to economics and accounting,\" thereby annoying his parents, who had wanted him to study law or economics.\n\nAmong the features of Tirifizyun is a broadcast schedule of all the Arabic satellite television stations, which the editorial office receives directly from them monthly. However, some stations, among them the Egyptian satellite station, refused to cooperate and slammed down the telephone when Khlikhil requested the broadcast schedule. \"They are apparently afraid of normalization,\" he says.\n\nThe most salient feature of the newspaper is its gossip column, and the number of threats of libel suits that come in every week seems proportional to interest in the column. Several times, furious \"injured parties\" have even shown up at the editorial offices. But despite these threats, none of which have so far been realized, \"The Sweet Meddler\" continues to provide readers with spicy stories about sulhas (reconciliations) between celebrities, the spats of well-known couples, Knesset members and public figures who are spotted with young women, and quarrels among leaders.\n\nThe weekly comes out on Thursdays, early in the morning, and has so far been distributed free in about 25,000 copies throughout the Arab sector in Israel. The staff is small because of budgetary limitations. \"Despite the threats, so far I have not been sued because our items are very accurate,\" says Khlikhil, who worked as a journalist at the daily Al-Ittihad for four years. After a dispute with the former editor of the newspaper, he was suspended from his job for three months, during which he wrote his first book, \"Al-Sirq\" (\"The Circus\"), in which he describes the life of young Arabs who come from the periphery to Haifa to study and to work. The book won first prize in a competition for young Palestinian writers in the year 2000. It portrays the life of the young men and women in great detail, from the way they go out until the wee hours of the night to their sex lives and their disappointed loves.\n\n\"Some people see the book as too saucy,\" says Khlikhil. He is angry at both the Hebrew and the Arabic press because they do not give sufficient coverage to art and entertainment. \"Arab artists do not receive sufficient coverage in the press,\" he says. \"To my regret, not only in the Hebrew-language press but also in the Arabic-language press.\"\n\nRaad Farah, the publisher of the weekly, is optimistic about the future of the publication. \"Everything that has been done was done after deep thought, and we are as careful as possible about not breaking the law. Nowadays celebrities get angry when they open the paper and see that they haven't appeared in one of the gossip items,\" says Farah. Jaffar Farah (no relation to Raad Farah), a founder of the Aalam association for the advancement of the press and the media among the Arabs In Israel, says: \"The weekly Tirifizyun answers two needs among the Arabs of Israel: one, to see the possibilities of private and public entertainment, and the other, the voyeuristic urge, which exists in the Arab population just as it does in any other.\"\n\nAlong with the broadcast schedule and the celebrity profiles and interviews, the reader is also offered recommendations for going out, as well as individual columns by several well-known Arab journalists."
