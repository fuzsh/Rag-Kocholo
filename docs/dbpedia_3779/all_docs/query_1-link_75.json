        "text": "A mob of hundreds of people shouting anti-Jewish epithets stormed and shut down the airport in the Russian city of Makhachkala in the predominantly Muslim region of Daghestan after a flight arrived from Israel on October 29.\n\nRiot police arrived at the airport after the disturbances, while the Interior Ministry office in Makhachkala said reinforcements, including National Guard units, were being sent to “ensure the safety” of arriving passengers, according to the Baza Telegram channel.\n\nWithout being specific, Daghestani officials later said that \"several people\" had been injured in the incident and were being treated.\n\nRussia's aviation authority later said the airport would remain closed until November 6.\n\nAnti-Jewish protests have broken out in several cities in the region in the face of Israel’s war with Hamas, rulers of the Palestinian-controlled Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry on October 29 demanded that Russia protect Israelis and Jews and that anyone threatening them be apprehended.\n\n\"Israel expects the Russian authorities to protect all Israeli citizens and all Jews, and to act decisively against the rioters and against incitement to violence against Jews and Israelis,\" a statement said.\n\nLate on October 29, videos and photos from the scene published by RFE/RL's Caucaus.Realities indicated that protesters had stormed onto the Makhachkala runway and attempted to gain entry to the incoming plane.\n\nAuthorities said the airport was immediately closed for incoming and outgoing flights, while police reportedly began jamming communications in the airport area to prevent the crowd from coordinating further actions.\n\nA local news Telegram channel reported that protesters were trying to check the identities of arriving passengers, attempting to prevent Jews from leaving the airport, including searching police vehicles.\n\nA protester was seen in one unconfirmed video carrying a sign saying, \"Child killers have no place in Daghestan.\"\n\nDaghestani officials accused \"enemies of Russia\" of instigating the anti-Semitic sentiments after the Coordination Center of Muslims of the North Caucasus called on authorities to prevent refugees from Israel from entering the republic, according to the Caucasian Knot publication.\n\nThe Internal Affairs Ministry said that \"against the background of the situation in Makhachkala, the identities of all those who take part in the riots will be established, since video surveillance works at the airport.\"\n\n\"We recommend that all persons who have violated the operating procedures of the [airport] to cease the illegal actions and to not interfere with the work of airport employees,\" a Telegram statement said.\n\n\"It is not easy for each of us to stand and watch the inhumane massacre of a civilian population -- the Palestinian people,” the government statement said. \"Still, we urge residents of the republic not to succumb to provocations of destructive groups and not to create panic in society.\"\n\nAnti-Semitic rallies took place over the weekend in other cities of the North Caucasus protesting against Israel’s military campaign.\n\nThe Middle East conflict broke out after Hamas militants stormed Israel on October 7, killing hundreds of people and taking more than 200 hostage. Israel retaliated with a military campaign against Gaza that is believed to have killed some 8,000 people and destroyed much of Gaza City.\n\nOn October 28, a rally was held in Cherkessk, the capital of the Karachayevo-Cherkessia Republic, demanding that residents of Israel not be allowed into the republic.\n\nOn the night of October 29, residents of Derbent in Daghestan protested after false reports of the settling of refugees from Israel in local hotels.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nPRISTINA -- The U.S. ambassador to Pristina has expressed concerns about the partnership between the United States and Kosovo, especially regarding the government's handling of issues related to the country's Serb minority.\n\nIn an interview with RFE/RL's Kosovo Service, the ambassador, Jeffrey Hovenier, said \"the quality of our partnership is not what we would hope it would be on some of these issues\" and that the U.S. administration had been \"challenged\" by Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti and his government.\n\nIn recent weeks there has been an uptick of tensions in the Serb-majority north of the country, with ethnic Serbs protesting against the government's plan to reopen a controversial bridge and the closure of Serbian post office branches.\n\nEthic Serbs are protesting the government's plan to reopen to vehicular traffic a bridge in the northern city of Mitrovica, which separates ethnic Serb and Albanian communities and has been a flashpoint for violence in the past.\n\nWhile the Kosovar government has said reopening the bridge can better integrate the Serbian population and boost the regional economy, locals Serbs are concerned that the move would increase ethnic tensions and impact their safety.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px

ultimately be open to vehicles, \"this is not the time\" due to security concerns.\n\n\"We believe there's real risk associated with taking this action right now,\" he said, citing potential violence and threats to NATO soldiers, including Americans.\n\nNATO forces have been operating in Kosovo to maintain peace and stability since 1999, when the military alliance intervened to stop escalating violence being perpetrated by Serbian forces against ethnic Albanians.\n\nBefore the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Kosovo was an autonomous province within Serbia, which was itself a constituent republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nWhile acknowledging areas of positive cooperation between the United States and Kosovo, particularly in economic development and strengthening government institutions, Hovenier said Washington had been \"challenged by the prime minister and by his government\" regarding its handling of issues pertaining to the Serb minority.\n\nLast week, the Kosovar authorities closed down nine branches of the Serbian post office in the north after determining that they were operating illegally and without a license, a move that was criticized by the United States and the EU, which has mediated Serbia-Kosovo relations for over a decade.\n\nThere are an estimated 120,000 ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo, mostly in the north, and many still receive benefits or pensions from Serbia, which has never recognized Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence.\n\nJeffrey Hovenier Speaks To RFE/RL\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:28 0:00\n\nKosovo's Serbs have protested against Pristina's authority in areas such as health care, pensions, education, and customs controls.\n\nIn the interview, the U.S. ambassador expressed concern that Kosovo's drive for EU accession could be \"negatively affected\" by the government's actions.\n\nAs Kosovo seeks participation in international organizations such as NATO, the Council of Europe, and the EU, Hovenier stressed that the government's recent moves \"reduce the appetite and reduce...the enthusiasm for supporting Kosovo on these paths.\"\n\n\"I have not seen a lot of enthusiasm in support of this government's efforts right now for new memberships in international organizations,\" he said.\n\nHovenier also emphasized how important it was for Kosovo to secure the support of existing members of international organizations, especially as \"certain countries in those institutions...don't recognize Kosovo the way we do as a sovereign, independent state.\"\n\nThe United States and all but five EU members are among the more than 100 nations who acknowledge Kosovo's independence.\n\nHovenier urged the Kosovo government to take into account U.S. concerns, saying the U.S. requests were \"heartfelt\" and \"humble.\"\n\nIran on August 13 rejected Western calls to renounce its threat to retaliate against Israel following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nHaniyeh was killed along with his personal bodyguard in Tehran on July 31 as he visited the Iranian capital for the swearing-in of President Masud Pezeshkian.\n\nIsrael hasn't confirmed or denied carrying out the attack.\n\nIran, Hamas's main backer, blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said in a statement that \"such a request lacks political logic, flies in the face of the principles and rules of international law, and constitutes public and practical support\" for Israel.\n\nReuters quoted on August 13 three senior Iranian officials as saying that only a cease-fire deal in Gaza stemming from talks expected to take place in the coming days would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel.\n\nIsrael started an air and ground offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage. Israel’s action has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nAccording to one of the officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, Iran, along with allies such as Hizballah, would launch a direct attack if the Gaza talks, which are due to begin on August 15 in either Egypt or Qatar, fail or if it perceives Israel is dragging out negotiations. A cease-fire in Gaza, on the other hand, would give Iran cover for a smaller \"symbolic\" response, one of Reuters' sources said.\n\nHis statement came after the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy called on Iran on August 12 to \"stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also held phone calls with Pezeshkian the same day.\n\nStarmer asked Pezeshkian to refrain from attacking Israel and said that war was not in anyone's interest, his office said. Starmer told Pezeshkian he was deeply concerned by the situation in the Middle East and called on all parties to de-escalate to avoid further regional confrontation.\n\n\"There was a serious risk of miscalculation and now was the time for calm and careful consideration,\" Starmer was quoted as saying, adding that he had underlined his commitment to an immediate cease-fire, the release of all hostages, and increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nFollowing the call with Starmer, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that war anywhere in the world was in no one's interest but that states had the right to \"punitive responses against an aggressor.\"\n\nScholz also called on Pezeshkian to prevent further military escalation in the Middle East. \"The spiral of violence in the Middle East must now be broken,\" Scholz told Pezeshkian, according to a German government statement.\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agreed with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could \"attack Israel as early as this week.\" U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation.\n\nWestern diplomats have scrambled to avert a major conflagration in the Middle East, where tensions were already high due to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas fighters surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and dpa\n\nUkraine's top military commander on August 13 said Ukrainian forces have taken control of 74 settlements in Russia's Kursk region as Ukrainian forces continued to make headway.\n\nColonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy briefed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy by video link, telling him Kyiv's military had advanced in different directions by up to 3 kilometers over the past 24 hours and had seized 40 square kilometers of new territory.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Despite the difficult, intense battles the advance continues, he said.\n\n\"I am grateful to our soldiers for their heroic service,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on August 13 he had informed EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell about Kyiv's operation in the Kursk region. Kuleba said on X that during his call with Borrell, weapons manufacturing and deliveries were also discussed.\n\nUkrainian forces launched a surprise incursion into the Kursk region on August 6 and have occupied about 1,000 square kilometers and numerous population centers.\n\nIt is not possible to verify battlefield claims, although some reports have suggested deeper incursions by Ukrainian forces.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhy said on August 13 that \"Ukraine is not interested in taking over the territory of the Kursk region.\"\n\n\"These Ukrainian actions are absolutely legitimate,\" he added.\n\nThe Kursk region's acting governor, Aleksei Smirnov, reported to President Vladimir Putin on August 12 that 28 settlements were \"under enemy control.\"\n\n\"The depth of the penetration into the territory of the Kursk region is 12 kilometers, the width of the front is 40 kilometers,\" he said.\n\nRepeating a Russian government talking point and without providing evidence, Russian Major General Apty Alaudinov, who is commander of the Akhmat special forces unit, said on Russian state TV that \"the headquarters of the NATO bloc certainly took part in the development of the operation.\"\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 13 that the United States is not engaged in any aspect, planning, or preparation of Ukraine's incursion into Russia.\n\nNearly the entire civilian population of the Krasnoyaruzh district of Russia's Belgorod region, located to the southeast of the Kursk region, has been evacuated, the region's governor said earlier.\n\n\"More than 11,000 people have left,\" Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram early on August 13. \"At present, about 1,000 people are in temporary housing.\"\n\nThe district's prewar population was about 14,000 people.\n\nThe governor announced the evacuation of the district on August 12 and closed off access to the area. The district head, Andrei Miskov, said the 500 people remaining in the area were mostly officials, emergency workers, and key specialists.\n\nThe Krasnoyaruzh district borders Ukraine to the west and the Kursk region's embattled Belov district to the north.\n\nUkrainian forces posted a video on August 12 that has been geolocated to the center of the Kursk region town of Sudzha. The exact date of the video is unclear, but Ukrainian soldiers can be heard saying that they had not yet encountered any Russian forces.\n\nRussian military vloggers have reported that Sudzha, about 10 kilometers from the border with a prewar population of more than 5,000 people, was under Ukrainian control.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said 12 Ukrainian drones had been \"destroyed\" overnight over the Kursk region and one each over the Belgorod and Voronezh regions.\n\nAcross the border in Ukraine's Sumy region, the Russian military carried out overnight strikes that damaged civilian energy infrastructure and several private cars, the region's military administration reported.\n\nOne civilian was reportedly wounded.\n\nUkraine's General Staff announced restrictions on the movement of civilians in the Sumy region within 20 kilometers of the border with Russia, citing the \"increasing intensity of hostilities.\"\n\nIn a statement on August 12, Zelenskiy said Moscow had used the border region to launch some 2,100 attacks on Ukraine's Sumy region since July 1.\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agrees with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could “attack Israel as early as this week” and it urged Tehran to “stand down” with regard its ongoing threats.\n\nU.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation and said Washington takes seriously reports that Iran could soon attack Israel in retaliation for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIran blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\n“We have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks, which is why, again, we have increased our force posture capabilities in the region even in just the last few days,” Kirby said.\n\n“We've got significant force capabilities in the region. We've changed some of that posture in just the last few days. The president is confident that we have the capability available to us to help defend Israel,” Kirby added.\n\nThe Pentagon has bolstered its forces in the Middle East amid the mounting tensions as Washington reiterated its support for long-standing ally Israel.\n\nIn a joint statement later with Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the White House said: “We expressed our support for the defense of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups.\"\n\n“We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place,” the statement added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian in separate phone calls to avoid escalation of military tensions in the region, their offices said. Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.\n\nFollowing the call with Scholz, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that, \"while Iran welcomes the expansion of interactions with all countries and stresses the need for resolving problems through negotiations, it will not give in to pressure, sanctions, bullying, and aggression.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" he added, \"it considers it a right to respond to aggressors based on international rules.\"\n\nThe Western allies' joint statement also said they “expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza.\"\n\nIt said the group endorsed the joint call by Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Amir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar “to renew talks later this week with an aim to concluding the deal as soon as possible, and stressed there is no further time to lose.”\n\n“All parties must live up to their responsibilities. In addition, unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed,” it said.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas extremists surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWashington has warned Tehran of “swift and severe” consequences if reports that it is planning to send hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia are confirmed.\n\nWe are prepared to deliver a swift and severe response if Iran were to move forward with the transfer of ballistic missiles, which would, in our view, represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 12.\n\nThe warning matches one issued by the United States earlier this year after Reuters -- citing six unidentified sources -- reported that Iran had shipped a “large number” of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic weapons to Russia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program over concerns Tehran could send such weapons to its Middle East allies and proxies and to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has suffered from weapons shortages as its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – launched in February 2022 – has dragged on with heavy losses of troops and military hardware, leaving it to look to allies such as Iran and North Korea to replenish its arms stock.\n\nOn February 22, the U.S. administration also warned Iran of a \"swift and severe\" response from the international community if Tehran provided ballistic missiles to Russia,\n\nNational-security spokesman John Kirby said at the time that Washington had yet to confirm the missiles had been transferred by Iran to Russia, but he said the move appeared likely.\n\n\"In this press reporting, the Iranians are clearly indicating that they will ship ballistic missiles to Russia, and we have no reason to believe they will not follow through,\" Kirby said.\n\nTehran has been providing Russia with unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, guided aerial bombs, and artillery ammunition, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials following widespread evidence of Iran-made Shahed drones causing damage and casualties in Ukraine, leading to additional Western sanctions.\n\n\"Iranian officials also continue to deny providing any UAVs [unmanned arial systems] to Russia when evidence is plain for the world to see that Russia has used these UAVs in relentless attacks against the civilian population in Ukraine, against civilian infrastructure,\" Patel told reporters.\n\nNewly elected Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian, considered by many to be a reformist leader, has spoken of hopes of improving relations with the West, but Patel expressed skepticism.\n\n\"This duplicity is only the latest reminder to the international community that the Iranian regime lacks in credibility,\" he said.\n\nIn January, the State Department issued a similar warning against North Korea in a joint statement with the European Union and dozens of others countries, including many in Asia.\n\n“The transfer of these weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, supports Russia’s war of aggression, and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” it said on January 9.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters"
