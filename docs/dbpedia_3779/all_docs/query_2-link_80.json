        "text": "MISSING MASTER DOCUMENT\n\nAs a rule, and in other world contexts, there is no one so-called smoking gun document that maps out mass elimination or calls for, it in so many words—be it the genocide of the Native Americans in North and South America, of the Jews during the Holocaust, or of Rwandans in the contemporary era. Scholars working on genocide often raise the question of intent, on a grand scale, in cases where no “blueprint” can be found. But the absence of a smoking gun document seems to trouble academics more than jurists. As Alex de Waal has poignantly remarked, “While the absence of an ideological schema and transformational blueprint is important for diplomats and genocide scholars, it does not entail lack of guilt in law.”10 De Waal reminds us that the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (the special court set up by the UN Security Council to prosecute those responsible for the Rwandan genocide) established that what happened in Rwanda wasn't a genocide because of the existence of a blueprint but rather “from a number of presumptions of fact, including the general context in which deliberate harm was systematically inflicted on the target group.”11 Commenting on the situation in Sudan's Darfur region, he also makes the case for the occurrence of a crime against humanity on a genocidal scale without the existence of a master plan, something that is relevant not only for describing the Nakba but also for examining the incremental genocide Israel has been carrying out against the Gaza Strip since 2005. “The Sudanese government,” de Waal writes, “planned a counterinsurgency and gave its officers complete impunity to commit atrocities, which they have routinely done on a gross scale and an ethnic basis. This was ethics-free counterinsurgency, escalated to a genocidal extreme.”12\n\nA similar point is made by legal scholar Alexander Zahar writing on the case of Rwanda. Zahar asserts that a master plan is never the sole explanation for the magnitude of a crime such as ethnic cleansing or genocide, emphasizing that the historical context is sometimes as important if not more so: “The Rwandan genocide was a flashpoint—one which now shines much brighter than others—along a path formed by constant conflict, beginning in the region many years ago and continuing to the present.”13 In other words, there is rarely a master document that lays out a careful and systematic plan for the mass murder or expulsion of a certain ethnic or religious group, although Walid Khalidi has demonstrated in the pages of this journal how close Plan D(alet) came to being just such a document.14\n\nThe absence of a master plan has led Benny Morris to conclude that the expulsion of the Palestinians was not premeditated or planned and that what occurred in 1948 was merely a matter of à la guerre, comme à la guerre.15 Be that as it may, the existence of a master document does not provide the principal proof for depicting an act as one of genocide or ethnic cleansing. The evidence is in the deed itself, not the documents behind it. But contextualizing the evidence both historically and (ideo)logically helps historians to assess the perpetrators' level of preparation and to expose the role of ideology in the execution of brutal policies of dispossession and destruction. No less important is the fact that such documents from the past can also be used to challenge absurdities like the Trump “peace plan” or other deal-of-the-century-type projects based on the notion that the Palestinian issue can be depoliticized and converted into an economic problem with humanitarian dimensions, thereby accomplishing the political “elimination of the Native” (what the late Baruch Kimmerling called politicide16) and a twenty-first-century version of terra nullius, “a land without a people.”\n\nTruth be told, as professional historians, we need an abundance of such documents to validate the evidence of the Yishuv's and later Israel's criminal policy in 1948. Although the parallel task may be much easier for the post-1967 period, the continued examination of the intent and brutality behind the 1948 Nakba is actually far more critical to our understanding of the nature of the contemporary conflict. Fortunately, in addition to the incredible work that continues to be done on oral history, quite a few professional historians have managed, over the years, to come by seminal Israeli documents; and, of course, other archives, such as those of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations remain accessible and open to the public. In the Arab world, archives and their access can be problematic, but they are less relevant to the debate about elimination, ethnic cleansing, and structural violence against the Palestinians.\n\nDocuments in Jeopardy: Indicative Archive of the Nakba\n\nIn the pages that follow, I will discuss several documents, with accompanying images where possible, and comment on the significance of this evidence from the past that I came across and photocopied some time ago. The documents follow a certain logic, that of the chronological trajectory of ethnic cleansing operations in Palestine in 1948. Many other historians and journalists who have worked in Israel's archives have done the same, and we can thus assume that even after the recent reclassification of these documents, copies of them will continue to be found in many individuals' possessions and form an important source for future research.\n\nThe trajectory of conquest begins in April 1948 with the de-Arabization of much of Palestine's urban space and the Zionist occupation of the coastal area around Jaffa and Haifa in the weeks leading up to the end of the Mandate on 14 May (See figures 1 and 2). This initial phase of the military conquest of Palestine is followed by the period subsequent to the creation of the state on 15 May, when what is now the Israeli army targeted the northern coast and, in July, captured three remaining unoccupied Palestinian towns—Lydda, Ramla, and Nazareth (See figure 3). West Bank towns were spared by a tacit understanding between the Jewish Agency and the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan reached before the outbreak of war. Gaza was also left untouched, becoming the major receiving center for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians pushed out from the area starting south of Jaffa all the way down to Beersheba. The final stage of the military conquest, beginning in October 1948 and ending a month later, saw the Israeli takeover of the eastern plains between Jaffa and Jerusalem and the southern tip of the Hebron area (see the “Dear Comrade Eliezer Peri” letter). Simultaneously, Israeli forces occupied the northern and Upper Galilee (some of the atrocities there are documented in figure 4).\n\nEven after Israel depopulated villages, their inhabitants attempted to return home once the fighting subsided, only to be driven out again. The final document (figure 5) is an order to expel such villagers from al-Majdal Asqalan in the Gaza district.\n\nThe documents presented here relate to major stages in the overall operation to dispossess and expel the indigenous population of Palestine, and they are corroborated by recent research based on oral history testimonies.17\n\n“EHUD” AND “BEN-AMI” OPERATIONS\n\nBen Ami/Ehud Operation Document Excerpts\n\nLYDDA/RAMLA AND NAZARETH\n\nDuring June 1948, the Zionist conquest continued, overpowering the contingents of regular soldiers that had arrived from various parts of the Arab world to aid the Palestinians. In this phase of the war, the areas targeted were the lower Galilee, the inner plain, and the northern Naqab. Additionally, two major Palestinian urban centers remained uncaptured: Lydda, including the adjoining town of Ramla, and Nazareth.\n\nInformation about exactly what happened in the urban center of Lydda and Ramla varies widely, both inside and outside the archive. Aside from the expulsion of the inhabitants, there is ample scholarly and journalistic evidence that 250 men, women, and children who had taken refuge in Lydda's great mosque were massacred, which hastened the depopulation of the two towns and cleared the way for the complete Judaization of the area between Jaffa and Jerusalem. More details have surfaced about the massacre thanks to unprecedented confessions by some of the men involved in the operation: in 2012–13, the filmmaker and scholar Eyal Sivan and I conducted interviews with more than thirty men who participated in the 1948 conquest, two of whom had been active in Lydda. An excerpt from their interview follows:\n\nBINYAMIN ROSKY.\n\nThere is something. I'm not going to tell you what happened or did not happen; it does not matter.\n\nINTERVIEWER.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nROSKY.\n\nDrop it.\n\nINTERVIEWER.\n\nWhat about the massacre in the mosque?\n\nROSKY.\n\nYou said it, not me [smiles]. They fled to the mosque, they thought it was the safest place, where they would not be killed. They thought Israelis will not destroy a mosque.\n\nYERICHMIEL KHANOVITZ.\n\nDo you know what a PIAT [Projector, Infantry, Anti-Tank weapon] is? Do you know this anti-tank bazooka? I used it to shoot at the mosque where they were sheltering.\n\nINTERVIEWER.\n\nWhich mosque?\n\nKHANOVITZ.\n\nThe one in [Lydda]. I went there with my PIAT. I fired a PIAT projectile in there.\n\nINTERVIEWER.\n\nInto the mosque?\n\nKHANOVITZ.\n\nInto the hall. Nobody was left alive.\n\nINTERVIEWER.\n\nWhat was the order?\n\nKHANOVITZ.\n\nWhat do you mean what was the order? “Shoot them with the PIAT.” Nothing can survive a PIAT.\n\nINTERVIEWER.\n\nHow many people were killed?\n\nKHANOVITZ.\n\nA lot.\n\nINTERVIEWER.\n\nHow many?\n\nKHANOVITZ.\n\nPlenty. I opened the door, I looked inside, and closed the door.\n\nINTERVIEWER.\n\nWhat did you see when you opened the door?\n\nKHANOVITZ.\n\nAn empty hall and everyone [splattered] on the wall.\n\nINTERVIEWER.\n\nLots of people?\n\nKHANOVITZ.\n\nA lot.\n\nINTERVIEWER.\n\nWhat ages?\n\nKHANOVITZ.\n\nWho can remember? But what I saw was enough.28\n\nAL-DAWAYIMA\n\nAfter Israeli forces occupied al-Dawayima on 29 October 1948, a soldier's eyewitness report was included in a letter to Al Hamishmar, the daily of the left-wing Zionist Mapam Party, dated 8 November 1948. Although the newspaper never published it, the letter was preserved in the Mapam archives where it was found by Benny Morris, who then provided a copy of it to historian Yair Auron.30 The letter enumerates details of the massacre at al-Dawayima as told to the author of the letter by a soldier who participated in the operation.\n\nA number of scholars have made use of the letter as a “smoking gun” document. Their interest in it understandably lies in the graphic description of atrocities committed by the troops.31 However, what in my view is far more significant (see emphasis in excerpt below) is that the letter demonstrates that brutality and inhumanity were routinely and commonly used to advance the goal of “eliminating the Native.”\n\nYOSSEF VASHITZ'S LIST OF ATROCITIES\n\nAl-MAJDAL ASQALAN\n\nThe last two areas that remained outside Zionist control in November 1948 were the Naqab, particularly its northwestern flank, which also formed the southern coast of the country stretching between Jaffa and Gaza; and the Upper Galilee. As mentioned earlier, by the winter of 1948, villagers from Palestine's rural areas had begun to put up resistance to Zionist attacks, including by attempting to return to villages from which they had earlier been expelled. These “unauthorized” returns led in turn to the staging of two more ethnic cleansing operations."
