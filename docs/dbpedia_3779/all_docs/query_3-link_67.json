        "text": "Real Madrid legend Karim Benzema has officially completed his move to Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBenzema’s signing stretches the definition of the phrase “free transfer” farther than any such move in the game’s history. His contract had expired in Madrid so the Saudi side didn’t have to pay a transfer fee, but they are still spending a lot on the 35-year-old.\n\nThe reigning Ballon d’Or winner will reportedly be paid €200 million per season in net salary over a two-year contract, which has an option to extend for another season.\n\n“I am excited to experience a new football league in a different country. Al-Ittihad Club has an amazing history, incredibly passionate fans and big ambitions in football to be a force in Asia after winning the league,” Benzema said in Al Ittihad’s announcement.\n\n“I have been fortunate to achieve amazing things in my career and achieve everything I can in Spain and Europe. It now feels the time is right for a new challenge and project. Every time I’ve visited Saudi Arabia I’ve always felt such warmth and love from the fans and people. I am looking forward to joining my new teammates and, together with them, help take this amazing club and the game in Saudi Arabia to new levels.”\n\nBenzema joins his former Real Madrid teammate Cristiano Ronaldo in the Saudi Pro League and after the country’s sovereign wealth fund took over four teams this week — including Al Ittihad — more spending is sure to follow.\n\nLionel Messi has been tipped to follow Benzema to the gulf state, while N’Golo Kante and Wilfried Zaha are also among the names reportedly considering a move to the Saudi Pro League.\n\nAll of this comes amid the backdrop of earth-shattering news from the world of golf, with the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour completing a merger with the PGA Tour on the same day that Benzema’s signing was made official.\n\nThe Middle Eastern country’s influence on the world of sports is only set to grow in the coming years."
