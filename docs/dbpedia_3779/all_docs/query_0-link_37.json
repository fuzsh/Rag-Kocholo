        "text": "BUDAPEST: History tends to repeat itself.\n\nWhen it comes to national teams, the past forms your identity - like Brazil, known for its Jogo Bonito, or Germany, who play for 90 minutes and win.\n\nOn Thursday night, Israel and Iceland tried to change that.\n\nBoth teams have played twice in play-off matches in the past:\n\nIsrael lost to Denmark to miss out on a spot at Euro 2000, and against Scotland for Euro 2020.\n\nIceland was knocked out by Croatia in the 2014 World Cup play-offs, and in the play-offs for Euro 2020, they defeated Romania in the semi-finals only to lose to Hungary in Budapest in the final.\n\nIceland are back in Budapest again, as Israel can’t host this game at home due to the war.\n\nIsrael has experienced this situation before, having hosted the entire Euro 2004 qualifying campaign away from home.\n\nAt the start, things looked bright for Israel, and they took the lead with a penalty from prolific scorer Eran Zahavi.\n\nWhen Zahavi took the shot, some Israelis recalled his penalty during their previous play-off appearance - he was the only player to miss in the shoot-out against Scotland.\n\nPerhaps, this time, a change was on the cards.\n\nBy the end of the first half, Iceland had taken back the lead, as Albert Gudmundsson and Arnór Traustason gave their team hope for the second half.\n\nIn each of Israel’s previous play-off appearances, there has been a moment - involving one of the country’s superstars - that has changed the game.\n\nIn 2000 it was Haim Revivo - a member of a legendary Celta Vigo squad - who was sent off as Israel lost 5-0.\n\nOn Thursday night, half way through the second half, Roy Revivo, Haim’s son, was sent off\n\nHistory was repeating itself.\n\nIf Israel wanted to change its destiny, it was going to happen with just 10 minutes to go.\n\nIsrael had won its second penalty. This time, Zahavi kicked the ball wide. Once again, he will be remembered for a missed penalty.\n\nFrom here on out it became clear which team would rewrite their history.\n\nGudmundsson scored twice more, as Iceland thrashed Israel 4-1, and qualified for a play-offs final against Ukraine.\n\nDespite that, Israel have some good reasons to be positive about their new era.\n\nThe recent success of their youth teams, and the growth in players playing abroad, may give them an opportunity to reach a major tournament in the future.\n\nPhoto courtesy: Israeli Football Association"
