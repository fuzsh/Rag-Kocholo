        "text": "by Sue Swartz\n\nConsider this a love letter to Haifa — where the prophet Elijah is buried and Israel’s first modern university was built. City built between the mountains and the sea, Haifa of summertime air advisories and surly Russian-speaking super-market clerks, less-favored cousin of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Haifa — the “red,” city of coexistence, gateway to the Galilee. Haifa — where I have been living for six months and where, on a sunny Tuesday morning in late June, I am trying to squeeze my small car into an impossibly small space in the same spirit that I’m trying to squeeze last-minute sightseeing into the remaining days of my sabbatical.\n\nI begin at the logical place: the air-conditioned Haifa Tourist Bureau. Yafah, the woman staffing the front desk, loads me down with pamphlets and advice. Born in Haifa, she lives a ten-minute walk away, in Kiryat Eliezer, a dense neighborhood of forty-year-old beige apartment buildings with tiny plastic-shuttered porches, home to the municipal stadium where you can catch a raucous game of soccer for the equivalent of $2.50. She loves the city and she loves the tourists, loves talking to them, “though they usually just come to see the Bahai Temple and gardens, and miss the rest.”\n\nOpulent greenery. Seaside resort. Panoramic views. This is the Haifa of the pamphlets, but it isn’t the rest, the Haifa of day-to-day living. It isn’t the noisy market or the corner flower shop. It isn’t the Haifa of Dovid, auto parts store manager on a side street not far from the Tourist Bureau and once-fashionable German Colony. “I like it a lot less than I used to,” he tells me in response to my questioning. “It’s a dead city now. There’s no money, no tourists, no work. The bus used to go down this street, past my store, but no longer. You better go talk to someone else.”\n\nThe best thing about Haifa is the highway to Tel Aviv. That’s what Dovid’s 30-ish son tells me, smiling, in perfect English. Tel Aviv, the place to which — if they don’t leave for the U.S. — the young of Haifa aspire after graduating from the Technion or the University. Standing on the dusty sidewalk, I’m reminded of another expression I’ve heard more than once: Jerusalem prays, Tel Aviv plays, Haifa works. Haifa is the city of the practical, the ordinary, the industrious. Nothing extraordinary happens here.\n\nIt’s easy to see why the place has this reputation. You can enter Haifa from the south on Highway 4, a winding and picturesque route that takes you through heavy forest and Druze villages, or you can enter the way most people do, on congested Highway 2 — past the industrial park with its prominent, high-tech signage; past two large shopping malls; past the port with its rows of red and blue cargo containers; past the oil refinery’s twin cooling towers, symbol of Haifa since the 1930s, and the valley of petrochemical plants and railway tracks.\n\nAccording to legend, sailors invented glass here on the shores of the Mediterranean. The traditional blue-purple dye needed for tzitzit came from snails just north of the city, birthing an ancient cottage industry. The German Templars of the mid-19th century introduced mechanical workshops and olive oil soap factories. The Turks built the Hejaz railway, the British the refineries. Eventually, the dockyards expanded, Jewish workers came from Europe by the thousands, and prominent Arab leaders of the Communist Party made their home here (hence, “red”). Public transportation even operates here on shabbat, a nod to Haifa’s proletarian roots.\n\nOkay, so it isn’t as trendy as Tel Aviv or as self-important as Jerusalem, but I like it that way. Almost every week brings a themed festival or special event: flamenco dancers, children’s theater, Spring wine and cheese tasting, jazz concerts — all advertised with huge round signs plastered every few yards along the main roads. There’s salsa dancing, all-night clubs, museums, and Israel’s largest shopping mall. And then there’s the beach.\n\nFrom haSheket (“Silence”) in the north to Dado (named for the military chief of staff during the Yom Kippur War) several kilometers south, the beach is the place for couples new enough to still have dates, retirees in jogging shoes, red-haired Russian women strolling arm in arm, Ethiopian teenagers, groups of young Arab men, and extended families all wearing brightly colored Crocs. One can fill up on blended fruit drinks, grilled meat or pizza, join in lively Israeli dancing complete with DJ, or swim, windsurf or play a fast-paced game of beach ping-pong (minus the table).\n\nPeople are there all day, every day, with few exceptions. “You’re not going to believe this,” Yafah tells me, “but I went to the beach during the war [with Hezbollah]. I think it was the best six weeks of my life: I didn’t have to go to work and could stay home with my son, but after a while I just had to go somewhere besides the supermarket. We went to the beach. Just for a few minutes, and then we came home. My son was scared. A bomb fell on the beach just after we left.”\n\nThat bomb, or another like it, destroyed a three-story apartment building in Bat Galim (“Daughter of the Waves”), the neighborhood closest to the beach, a curious mix of abandoned almost-mansions, surfer hang-outs, and small duplexes with little gardens. A half-finished casino with a red roof overlooks the boardwalk. They’re repaving some of the side streets, adding sidewalks here and there. Considered the best windsurfing beach in Israel, it has sections named for the Machon Oceanographic Institute, the casino, and a small chapel up the road. Not long ago, there were plans for a multi-use marina, shopping and hotel district, the “Haifa Rivi-era”, but the plan was defeated by a coalition of windsurfers, residents, environmentalists, and beachgoers. The Red Bull Stormrider contest takes place here, near the natural habitat of an endangered sea turtle. The reefs will leave you bleeding if you’re careless. The milkshakes are particularly thick. Bat Galim feels like a place that’s waiting for something.\n\nRooftop sculpture in Wadi Nisnas"
