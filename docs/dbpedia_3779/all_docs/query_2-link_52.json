        "text": "The Israeli military did not back away from the evacuation plan on Friday but softened its stance, suggesting there was no deadline, after initially saying that people should leave northern Gaza within 24 hours. “We understand it will take time,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesman, told reporters.\n\nIn Gaza, already cut off from vital supplies, many people fled with what they could carry, not knowing what conditions awaited them in the south or how long they would be gone. But many others remained, out of necessity, fear or defiance. Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza and conducted a deadly, large-scale incursion into Israel last weekend, has urged people to stay put, calling the Israeli directive “psychological warfare.”\n\nOn both sides, there is widespread anticipation of an Israeli ground invasion, after 360,000 reservists were mobilized and many units were dispatched to the southwestern region bordering Gaza. Israel has neither said it would invade nor ruled it out, but in a statement to Gazans the Israeli military left no doubt that conditions would worsen.\n\nIsrael “will continue to operate with significant force in Gaza City, and will make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians,” it said.\n\nHuman rights groups and international institutions that condemned Hamas’s assault on Israel also criticized the Israeli response, including the evacuation directive, the bombing campaign and a complete blockade that has prevented fuel, water, food and medicine from entering and refugees from leaving, and shutting down electricity service for Gazans. Health care workers, international aid workers and journalists were among those killed in the bombing.\n\n“The horrific attacks in Israel cannot justify the limitless destruction of Gaza,” the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that the call to evacuate northern Gaza violated international law. Another relief group working in Gaza, the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the evacuation amounted to “the war crime of forcible transfer.”\n\nWhile Israel directed Palestinians to go to southern Gaza, its forces were striking sites there, too, underscoring the dangers of traveling there. The Interior Ministry in Gaza said that Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 70 Palestinians and wounded 200 others who were trying to flee northern Gaza in vehicles on a main highway to the south.\n\nPresident Biden said relieving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza was one of his top priorities. He did not criticize Israel’s response to Hamas attacks he called “pure evil.”\n\n“We can’t lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians had nothing to do with Hamas and these appalling attacks, and they’re suffering as a result as well,” he said in a speech in Philadelphia.\n\nThe crisis reverberated far beyond Gaza on Friday, a day that a Hamas leader had declared a “day of rage” for its supporters around the world. Hundreds of thousands of people turned out in rallies across the Middle East to express outrage over the Israeli response. A half-million people filled Baghdad’s Tahrir Square and large protests broke out in Beirut and Bahrain.\n\n“They were subjected to various types of injustice, and now they are being subjected to starvation, siege and killing,” said Ali Hassan, 60, who participated in the demonstration in Bahrain on Friday.\n\nIn the West Bank, Israeli security forces killed eight Palestinians in clashes on Friday, and security was stepped up in cities around the United States.\n\nAn Israeli diplomat in Beijing was stabbed — not fatally — on Friday, a day after Israel criticized China for not condemning the Hamas assault. In France, a man the authorities said was under surveillance for suspected Islamist radicalization killed one person with a knife and wounded two others in the city of Arras. The authorities did not offer a motive in either case.\n\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken, after meeting with the leaders of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan, flew to Qatar to meet with its ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Qatar has sometimes acted as an intermediary in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and a number of Hamas leaders have homes there.\n\nU.S. officials said they were looking for ways to secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas, to create a “safe zone” for Palestinians within Gaza, to get humanitarian relief into Gaza and to evacuate foreigners who are trapped there, including some 500 to 600 American citizens.\n\nIsrael and Egypt, Gaza’s only immediate neighbors, which have imposed a blockade on the impoverished territory for 16 years, have refused to allow people to cross their borders in the past week. Egypt has said it would allow relief aid in, but the only border crossing from Egypt has been effectively sealed by Israeli bombing.\n\nKing Abdullah II of Jordan, meeting with Mr. Blinken, warned against forced displacement and “inflicting collective punishment against Gaza residents,” his government said in a statement. It also cautioned that the crisis could spill into neighboring countries.\n\nThe Hamas assault on Israel that began last Saturday appeared to have no immediate aims beyond indiscriminate slaughter and hostage-taking in dozens of small towns and communities, a military base and a music festival. It killed about 1,300 people in Israel and wounded almost 3,400, according to the Israeli government, not including the attackers who were killed and wounded when Israelis drove them from the places they had overrun. Some of the victims were foreigners, including at least 27 Americans and 15 French citizens who were killed.\n\nA Hamas spokesman said on Thursday that the attack was carried out by a battalion of 3,000 fighters, with a 1,500-strong backup force.\n\nIn retaliation, Israel has conducted a far more intensive bombing campaign of Gaza than in previous conflicts, which it says is aimed at Hamas but which Palestinians and aid groups say has mostly harmed civilians. The Gazan authorities put the toll at 1,900 people killed, about 7,700 others wounded and many more whose homes have been destroyed. Out of more than 2 million Gazans living in an area about the size of the city of Philadelphia, the United Nations says that about 400,000 people have been displaced from their homes.\n\nLast Saturday, Israel suffered more fatalities in a single day than in any of its previous wars, and on Friday the Israeli authorities escorted international reporters on a tour of a makeshift morgue in Ramla in central Israel, where the arduous task of identifying the bodies is underway. About 500 bodies are being held there in more than a dozen refrigerated trucks.\n\nSome were proving particularly difficult to identify because the Hamas assailants had burned them. The door to one of the cargo containers was opened — the one holding the bodies of children and infants.\n\n“Notice the small-sized bags,” said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, the military spokesman. “They are of children and babies. The smaller bags are of their body parts,” he added.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Friday that allegations that it had used white phosphorous munitions in Gaza were “unequivocally false.” The groups Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International had said there was evidence that Israel had used white phosphorus, an especially potent incendiary whose use in populated areas would violate international law.\n\nIn northern Gaza, including the region’s largest population center, Gaza City, many people fled southward on Friday with what they could carry. But many others stayed, citing a host of reasons: they had no vehicles or no fuel; they were infirm or caring for someone who could not readily be moved; they thought they would be no safer en route or in the south; or they feared that they would not be allowed to return.\n\n“Hamas terrorists are hiding in Gaza City, inside tunnels, underneath houses and inside buildings populated with innocent Gazan civilians,” the Israeli military said in its statement to Palestinians, urging them to “distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields.”\n\nPatrick Kingsley reported from Jerusalem, Farnaz Fassihi from New York, Edward Wong from Amman, Jordan, and Doha, Qatar, and Victoria Kim from Seoul. Reporting was contributed by Hiba Yazbek , Aaron Boxerman , Raja Abdulrahim , Monika Pronczuk , Peter Baker and Alexandra Stevenson .\n\nAmir Fattah, 31, a Palestinian-American from Staten Island, said his parents had spent the week at home, watching the news and crying.\n\n“All we have is our tears,” he said. “We can’t do anything.”\n\nBut he did not tell his family he was coming to Times Square, he said, because they would be worried.\n\nLater, a crowd of about 1,000 people gathered at Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn for a rally organized by the group Jewish Voice for Peace. The event began with a prayer, and the demonstrators then marched two blocks to the Prospect Park West home of Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, to demand that the U.S. government push for a cease-fire.\n\n“As Jewish New Yorkers, we are here to say, ‘not in our name,’” Morgan Bassichis, a Jewish Voice for Peace organizer, said to the crowd. “We have lost Israeli and Palestinian lives.”\n\nDemonstrators carried signs that said “Jews against apartheid” and “Jewish descendants of Holocaust survivors against Israeli apartheid” and chanted “not in our name” and “no more weapons to Israel” as a trombone and small drum corps kept the tempo.\n\nLouisa Solomon, a rabbinical student from Queens, was among those in the crowd. Ms. Solomon, 41, had brought her children, Rosie, 6, and Reuben, 4, along to teach them “the kind of Judaism that I want to lead and be a part of where we oppose genocide and support a better future.”\n\n“I want to listen to what folks on the ground are asking for, and what we’ve heard is that people are asking for a cease-fire,” she added.\n\nThe protesters left Mr. Schumer’s residence just before 8 p.m. and moved to Flatbush Avenue, where they blocked traffic around Grand Army Plaza, one of the city’s busiest traffic loops.\n\nThe daytime rally unfolded amid the routine business of New York: pedicabs weaving, tourists navigating the crowds, people shopping for sneakers. But social media posts had spread false information about a terrorist attack supposedly planned to take place in Times Square at the same time as Friday’s protest. Cable news segments and tabloid coverage had warned about a “Global Day of Jihad.” A thrum of worry seemed to power endless doom scrolling.\n\nThe public unease led some companies to advise employees to consider working from home on Friday. An increased number of police patrols monitored synagogues and mosques for any sign of trouble, Mayor Eric Adams said. Some families kept children home from school.\n\nTomer Applebaum, 37, an Israel Defense Forces veteran who lives on Staten Island, stood among a group of pro-Israel protesters. Friends of his kept their children home from school on Friday, he said, but his own children went to class.\n\n“I’m not going to let some terrorists in a hole in Gaza scare me,” Mr. Applebaum said.\n\nElected officials tried to calm the public’s nerves before the rally. At a news conference on Thursday evening, Mr. Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul told New Yorkers that there were no signs of danger, an assertion backed up by the New York Police Department and the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nNevertheless, some New Yorkers remained on edge. Linda Salamon, 68, a child of Holocaust survivors, said she went to Times Square in support of Israel over the objections of her daughter.\n\n“It was every place on social media,” Ms. Salamon said. “My daughter’s sending me clips, ‘Be careful today.’”\n\nMs. Salamon came anyway because she said she viewed the Hamas attacks, which killed more than 1,200 Israelis, as “just like another Holocaust.” She did not see a meaningful distinction between supporting Palestinians and supporting Hamas, she said.\n\n“I don’t understand how somebody could support terror — you know, support the Palestinians right now,” she said, though many prominent political leaders, Palestinians and others who have been supportive of the Palestinian cause have unequivocally denounced the initial attack.\n\nAcross the street at the pro-Palestine rally, Rachel Acuña, 39, said it had been difficult to watch the news coverage of the Hamas attack on Israel and Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which has killed at least 1,900 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.\n\n“I’ve been crying a lot,” she said.\n\nThe last week had felt “isolating,” said Ms. Acuña, who is part Dominican and part Palestinian. Neighbors in Washington Heights had given her dirty looks when she went out wearing Palestinian earrings or a traditional kuffiyah scarf, she said.\n\n“I was raised as a Latina in this country, and when 9/11 happened, I realized the rest of the world didn’t see a Latina — they saw an Arab woman,” Ms. Acuña said. This week, she said, “people in my neighborhood are uncomfortable making eye contact with me. Lots of people shake their heads at me.”\n\nChelsia Rose Marcius , Olivia Bensimon and Wesley Parnell contributed reporting.\n\nA correction was made on\n\nOct. 13, 2023\n\n:\n\nAn earlier version of this article included an incorrect name of the group that organized a rally in Brooklyn. It was Jewish Voice for Peace, not Jews for Peace.\n\nHow we handle corrections\n\nNow, with the Israeli military pummeling the coastal territory, they are stuck in a war zone.\n\n“They’re in a bad situation,” Mr. Alarayshi said in a phone interview.\n\nMr. Alarayshi checks in with his family once an hour “to make sure that they are still alive,” he said, adding that “every minute they can hear some bombing around them. They’re just sitting around each other and trying to protect each other as much as they can.”\n\nThey have no electricity or water, and they are having a hard time getting food.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Alarayshi’s parents and siblings, along with their children, had moved to the house of another family member, he said, which is a little farther away from where most of the Israeli airstrikes were this week. His parents, he said, are understandably frightened.\n\n“They have not been in a war of this kind in their lifetime,” Mr. Alarayshi said. “They’re not safe. Nobody in Gaza is safe right now.”\n\nOver the last several days, Mr. Alarayshi said that he has been reaching out to U.S. authorities and state legislators to see what can be done regarding getting his parents home safely. U.S. officials, he said, have told him that they are looking into it but that no solution has been offered yet.\n\n“They were trying to get them to have, like, a safe way to get them out of there,” he said, adding that there are other Americans also trapped in Gaza.\n\nJohn F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said this week that Israel’s blockade of Gaza was preventing them from providing help to American citizens inside the territory. The White House, he added, was in talks with Israel and Egypt about establishing a safe passage between Gaza and Egypt.\n\nAn advocacy group, the Arab American Civil Rights League, said it was working with lawmakers and the State Department to try to move Americans out of Gaza.\n\n“It’s our moral obligation to do everything within our power to prevent further loss and to ensure the security of U.S. citizens abroad,” Mariam E. Charara, the group’s executive director, said in a statement on Thursday. “We must work diligently and collectively to address these issues, making it our top priority to ensure the safety and well-being of our fellow Americans in Gaza.”\n\nOn Friday, expectations that Israel would soon invade Gaza mounted after the Israel Defense Forces warned civilians in the northern part of the territory that they should evacuate to the south “for their own safety and protection.”\n\nMr. Alarayshi said on Friday morning that his parents, who are in northern Gaza, had not left. “As of right now, they are staying,” he said in a text. “We don’t have a place in the south to be at.”\n\n“To go and criticize the head of a country who just saw massive bloodshed — no, that’s not what we need in a president,” Ms. Haley said of Mr. Trump, the former president and current Republican front-runner, in a news conference in Concord, N.H., after filing to get on the state’s primary ballot.\n\nMs. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and United Nations ambassador under Mr. Trump who has been running on her foreign policy experience, said the next president of the United States needed to be someone who “knows the difference between good and evil, who knows the difference between right and wrong.”\n\n“You don’t congratulate or give any credit to murderers, period,” she said.\n\nSteven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, accused Ms. Haley of using Democratic talking points and said that “there has been no bigger defender and advocate for Israel than President Trump.” But Mr. Trump has drawn scorn from both sides of the political aisle for referring to Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group, as “very smart” while criticizing Israel’s prime minister and Israeli intelligence.\n\nHis tone shifted on Friday, though, as he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, that he had “always been impressed by the skill and determination of the Israeli Defense Forces.” A second post said simply: “#IStandWithIsrael #IStandWithBibi.”\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Ramaswamy campaign, dismissed Ms. Haley’s remarks on Friday — including Ms. Haley’s accusation that he sounded like a member of the group of progressives known as “the squad” — as a scripted attack from a candidate whom Ms. McLaughlin sought to portray as beholden to special interests.\n\n“Pre-canned quip brought to you by the Boeing squad,” she said in an email, invoking Ms. Haley’s tenure of less than a year on the corporate board of Boeing.\n\nMs. Haley’s dig at Mr. Ramaswamy on Friday escalated an ongoing feud between the G.O.P. rivals that has pitted those with more traditional conservative positions, who believe the United States should play a major role abroad, against those espousing anti-interventionist views, who want Americans to focus on issues at home.\n\nMr. Ramaswamy was sharply rebuked by his opponents over his conversation with Tucker Carlson on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, earlier this week.\n\nHe called the Republican response to Hamas’s attacks on Israel another example of “selective moral outrage” and argued that politicians on both sides of the aisle had largely ignored other atrocities, citing fentanyl deaths in the United States and the accusations of genocide of ethnic Armenians by Azerbaijan.\n\n“It comes down in most cases — some people do have ideological commitments that are outdated that are earnest — but a lot of it comes down to money, the corrupting influence of super PACs on the process,” Mr. Ramaswamy said.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, another Republican candidate in the race, condemned Mr. Ramaswamy’s remarks, saying that he was “pulling out the oldest and most offensive antisemitic tropes possible.”\n\nHe added: “To say that outrage is fueled by donor money and the media is beyond offensive. It is morally wrong and it is dangerous.”\n\nMr. Ramaswamy accused critics and even conservative media outlets of taking his words out of context. Ms. McLaughlin, his campaign spokeswoman, said in an email on Friday that he was talking about Azerbaijan, not Israel.\n\nBut Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator, was not persuaded. In a tense exchange between the two men on Thursday night, Mr. Hannity said that Mr. Ramaswamy had a history of retreating from his incendiary statements and had made wild claims without backing them up.\n\n“What are the financial corrupting influences that Nikki Haley is taking a position on?” he said. “We’ve got pictures of dead babies decapitated, burned babies’ bodies. We’ve got the equivalent of what would be, population-wise in the U.S., over 37,000 dead Americans. So, how much more evidence do you need? What are you talking about?”\n\nMr. Trump, during his time in the White House, virtually did not challenge Israel on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAs his United Nations ambassador, Ms. Haley forcefully spoke out in support of the president’s formal recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, as well as his decision to cut American funding to Palestinian refugees. She has since made her foreign policy credentials and staunch support for Israel pillars of her campaign. Her sparring with Mr. Ramaswamy over foreign policy on the national debate stage in particular helped to boost her in the polls, propelling her to the second position behind Mr. Trump in New Hampshire.\n\nOn the trail and on the Republican media circuit this week, Ms. Haley has been talking up her on-the-ground experience in the Middle East and calling for the elimination of Hamas. In town halls in New Hampshire on Thursday, she ratcheted up her criticism of Mr. Trump for his reaction to the Israel-Hamas war, saying the former president was too focused on himself.\n\nIn a small room crowded with reporters at the New Hampshire State House on Friday, Ms. Haley again pitched herself as “a new generational conservative leader” who knew how to negotiate with world leaders.\n\n“I know what it takes to keep Americans safe,” she said. She later added: “You don’t just have Israel’s back when they get hit. You need to have Israel’s back when they hit back, too.”\n\nThousands of Russians — including many popular artists and entrepreneurs — fled the country for Israel after the invasion began last year. To a lot of Russian families with Jewish roots, Israel offered a way to settle quickly in a familiar country with full rights afforded to a citizen. Many even opted to quit lucrative jobs and engagements in Russia to settle in a place where they could publicly oppose the invasion.\n\nHowever, the exodus has poisoned the Kremlin’s relations with the Israeli government. While Mr. Putin previously positioned himself as a friend of Israel, after the invasion, his Justice Ministry embarked on a mission to impose an operational ban on a major Jewish nonprofit agency that helps people emigrate to Israel. A Russian court is yet to rule on the matter.\n\nApart from political relations deteriorating, the war in Ukraine made anti-Israeli comments more acceptable and widespread on Russian state media. The war with Hamas prompted many to intensify the verbal attacks, raising echoes of the Soviet era, when Jews were targeted and seen as having dual loyalties.\n\n“The country that never fights with its neighbors, fights with its neighbors again,” said Margarita Simonyan, the firebrand head of RT, Russia’s state-run international news network, in reference to a popular sentiment among Russians who moved to Israel over the past 18 months believing they had left a country at war to live in a peaceful place.\n\n“We are waiting for an exodus of Russian pacifists,” said Ms. Simonyan in a post on Telegram, a popular messaging app, after the attacks on Saturday. “Though we don’t really wait for them.”\n\nIn a response to that criticism, Maksim Galkin, one of the most popular Russian TV hosts who left Russia following the invasion, said that he and his family, including his wife Alla Pugachyova, a famous Russian and Soviet pop singer, were proud to be part of a nation where patriotism was “not artificial and not imposed from the top.”\n\n“We didn’t even consider leaving Israel in these difficult tragic days,” said Mr. Galkin, who is half-Jewish, in a video statement on Instagram on Monday. “We want to support the Israeli people.”\n\nPeople of Jewish decent have historically occupied major positions in Russian society. The vast Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center in Moscow features some of the leading Russian businessmen and government officials on its board of trustees. Opened in 2012, Mr. Putin donated his month’s salary to the construction of the museum.\n\nOver the past week, though, Russian news websites speculated whether prominent Russians in Israel had decided to return to Russia since the war broke out.\n\nLawmakers of the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament, warned that Russians returning from Israel might not find a warm welcome and could face prosecution and even exile to the Far East. A group of Russian lawmakers requested prosecutors to check if prominent Russians in Israel, including Mr. Galkin, had discredited the Russian army, which is a crime, and could thus be prosecuted.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Putin weighed in on the issue, saying that Russia “is a free country and everyone has the right to chose where to live how they see fit.”\n\n“The question is how these people behaved, what they did,” Mr. Putin said during a news conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. “If these actions are such that they violate Russian laws, then they have to be held responsible.”\n\nIn Russian cities, Jewish communities have been raising money to help Israeli families in need. In St. Petersburg and Moscow, synagogues were full of worshipers and many Russians laid flowers and candles in front of them as well as the country’s diplomatic missions.\n\n“Even if you don’t know someone pulled into the military, your colleague does, your neighbor does,” said Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, an investment firm. “Every day, we hear about someone else we know whose child was murdered or severely injured or is missing.”\n\nIsrael’s defense forces have called up about 360,000 reservists for duty. Such numbers will test the resilience of the technology community that contributes about 20 percent of the country’s economy — and a significant portion of global activity in cutting-edge areas including cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and semiconductors.\n\nThe mobilization represents about 4 percent of Israel’s population of about nine million. But investors and start-up founders say that tech companies, and especially start-ups, are likely to face a disproportionately high share of that, given their younger work forces.\n\nStart-ups are not alone in being drawn into the war in Gaza: Major global companies, especially those in tech, have significant numbers of employees in the country. Microsoft said this week that it had nearly 3,000 workers in Israel.\n\nThe semiconductor giant Nvidia confirmed that a man seen on video being kidnapped by Hamas assailants at a music festival last weekend was an employee named Avinatan Or. The company has also canceled a conference in Tel Aviv that was scheduled for next week.\n\nThe Israeli economy has shown resilience to military action before, Moody’s, the credit rating agency, said this week. But it added, “A prolonged conflict that durably and significantly impairs economic activity and policymaking would test that resilience.”\n\nFor some start-ups with limited resources, the conflict is felt acutely. Some have lost employees and family members to the fighting. Others are learning to cope with smaller staffs because of the call-up.\n\nAt HiBob, a human resources software provider in Tel Aviv, about 6 percent of the company’s Israel-based employees, or 25 people, had been mobilized, according to Ronni Zehavi, the founder and chief executive. He also said that his own son and daughter were called up last weekend and have been deployed to the front lines.\n\nA week ago, he said, the company raised $150 million, giving it a valuation of $2.7 billion. But after the government declared war on Hamas, Mr. Zehavi said, HiBob began checking on employees’ physical and mental health and reconfiguring its teams to pick up projects from mobilized workers.\n\nDeel, a global payroll company, said its clients had about 1,300 employees and contractors in Israel who have been affected. That includes Deel itself, which has more than 80 employees based in Israel, said Alex Bouaziz, the company’s Israel-based co-founder and chief executive. Some workers, including an executive, flew in from abroad to report to duty.\n\n“I’m obviously very worried about my teammates,” said Mr. Bouaziz.\n\nA surge in patriotism is driving others in the community to volunteer for service.\n\n“I have friends texting me who are saying, ‘Why aren’t I being called up?’” said Shiran Shalev, a partner at the venture capital firm Battery Ventures.\n\nStart-ups are affected in other ways. About 25 of HiBob’s employees were evacuated from their homes because of the violence, and needed housing and supplies like clothes, phone chargers and toys for their children, Mr. Zehavi said.\n\nCompanies must also deal with families who need child care because of deployed parents and shuttered schools, and more. At the same time, businesses said that they felt pressure not to let down their clients, most of whom are abroad.\n\nStart-ups are also responding to the conflict in other, nonmilitary ways.\n\nMr. Zehavi said that HiBob was building a system to help match volunteers with needs, including helping in hospitals or transporting reservists. And Mr. Bouaziz said that he and other executives had been buying clothes and supplies for soldiers.\n\nMembers of the tech community were quick to contend that they had faced daunting challenges before, including previous mobilizations and the coronavirus pandemic. Still, they acknowledged that it was unclear for how long the Gaza fighting would persist, or how large the scale of the war would grow.\n\n“How that plays out in terms of economic impact, I think it’s too soon to tell,” said Avi Hasson, the chief executive of Start-Up Nation Central, an Israeli nonprofit that connects investors with companies. Noting that he was traveling between two memorial services, he added, “We’re still in the funeral stage.”\n\nBut others insisted that the community would continue to build the kinds of businesses that have made Israel a haven for entrepreneurs. They pointed to a global outpouring of support, such as a public letter signed by hundreds of prominent investment firms like Bain Capital Ventures and Warburg Pincus.\n\n“Do I think that ‘Start-Up Nation’ goes away?” said Mr. Shalev. “Absolutely not.”\n\nEphrat Livni and Liz Alderman contributed reporting."
