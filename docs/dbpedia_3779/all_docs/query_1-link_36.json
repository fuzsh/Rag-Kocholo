        "text": "Menahem Kahana | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe UN Palestinian refugee agency sounded an alarm, saying its aid workers will no longer be able to continue humanitarian operations in the Gaza Strip unless new supplies are allowed into the besieged enclave.\n\nIsrael's military continued to urge residents to move from northern Gaza to the south as it pledged to counter Hamas with \"an even greater force.\" The Israel Defense Forces said it would not carry out any military operations along the evacuation route from 10 a.m. local time (3 a.m. ET) to 1 p.m. Sunday.\n\nThe evacuation orders have been criticized by many humanitarian agencies, however. After negotiations between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden, a decision to renew water supplies to parts of southern Gaza was agreed upon, Israel Energy Minister Israel Katz said on Sunday. The UN warned late Saturday that the lack of water and fuel in Gaza had \"become a matter of life or death.\"\n\nEnergy Minister Israel Katz said that the decision to partially renew water supplies was in line with Israeli policy, which is to tighten a blockade on the Hamas-ruled territory.\n\nOn Sunday, China urged Israel to end its collective punishment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, saying that \"Israel's actions have gone beyond self-defense.\" China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi's comments came during a series of weekend calls, as world leaders worked to avert a wider conflict in the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Sunday that the Senate would swiftly push through a military aid package to help Israel in its fight against Hamas.\n\n\"We will work to move this aid through the senate ASAP, and the Israeli leaders made it clear to us they need the aid quickly,\" said Schumer during a trip to Israel.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. Embassy in Israel said it would help Americans and their immediate family members to depart the northern Israeli port city of Haifa via sea to Cyprus on Monday. \"Boarding will proceed in order of arrival and is on a space-limited basis,\" the embassy said.\n\nwatch now\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will head back to Israel after meeting with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Sunday. The top U.S. diplomat is also expected to land in Egypt later in the day and work on a deal to grant safe passage of Americans currently in Gaza through the Rafah gate — the only crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.\n\nGaza — a narrow strip of land sandwiched between Egypt, Israel and the Mediterranean Sea — has been pounded by Israeli forces in response to Hamas' brutal attack on Israel last weekend. The death toll continues to tick higher, with at least 1,400 killed in Israel and nearly 2,700 in Gaza. The number of hostages believed to be held by the militants has jumped to 155, according to IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagar.\n\nUNRWA says staff are 'no longer able' to provide humanitarian aid in Gaza\n\nAhmad Hasaballah | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nThe U.N. Palestinian refugee agency said its staff are \"no longer able to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza.\"\n\n\"Gaza is running out of water, and Gaza is running out of life,\" the commissioner-general of United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said in a statement Sunday, warning they will soon run out of food and medicine too.\n\n\"There is not one drop of water, not one grain of wheat, not a litre of fuel that has been allowed into the Gaza Strip for the last eight days,\" said Philippe Lazzarini. \"An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding under our eyes.\"\n\nIn a statement to CNBC, Israel's Defense Forces said: \"Israel has no legal obligation to supply Gaza with electricity, fuel or goods. Gaza is independently capable of generating electricity and supplying water.\"\n\nThe IDF claimed that \"90% of Gaza's water is sourced within the Gaza Strip,\" and blamed Hamas militants for destroying the infrastructure at crossings \"through which goods pass through everyday.\"\n\nThe IDF also claimed the militants were diverting resources in Gaza for their own use.\n\nThe UNRWA has lost 14 of its staff members and said most of its 13,000 staff in the besieged enclave are now displaced or out of their homes.\n\n\"Unless we bring now supplies into Gaza, UNRWA and aid workers will not, be able to continue humanitarian operations,\" Lazzarini said.\n\n— Joanna Tan, Natasha Turak\n\nDeath toll in Gaza rises to nearly 2,700; Israel's hostage count jumps to 155\n\nThe death toll in Gaza has risen to 2,670 and 9,600 people have been wounded, according to Gaza's health ministry, as Israel continues its offensive against Hamas militants in the besieged enclave. Deaths in the occupied West Bank also climbed, with 55 people killed and 1,200 others injured.\n\nIn Israel, more than 1,400 people have died while 3,500 were wounded, according to the government press office.\n\nThe number of hostages believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza jumped to 155, according to IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagar, who did not confirm if it was due to an increase in civilian abductees or combined military-civilian hostages.\n\n— Joanna Tan\n\nBiden says he's 'shocked and sickened' by brutal killing of 6-year-old Muslim boy\n\nPresident Joe Biden has called on Americans to \"reject Islamophobia,\" as he condemned the brutal killing of a six-year-old Muslim boy in Illinois.\n\n\"As Americans, we must come together and reject Islamophobia and all forms of bigotry and hatred,\" Biden said in the statement, adding that he and his wife were \"shocked and sickened.\"\n\nDetectives said the boy and his mother were targeted for their Muslim faith by the suspect, 71-year-old Joseph Czuba. He has been charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, two counts of hate crime and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. The suspect is believed to have committed the attack as a result of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe child's mother, who suffered multiple stab wounds, is expected to survive the attack that occurred in Plainfield Township, some 40 miles southwest of Chicago on Saturday.\n\n\"The child's Palestinian Muslim family came to America seeking what we all seek — a refuge to live, learn, and pray in peace,\" Biden said. \"This horrific act of hate has no place in America.\"\n\n— Joanna Tan\n\nIsrael's ground offensive may 'happen in stages' rather than a full invasion, says former ambassador\n\nIsrael's ground invasion could take place in stages rather than a full-scale invasion, said Daniel Kurtzer, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\n\"Israel is not getting any timetable, it could happen any moment. But it could also happen in stages with additional incursions by small groups of Israeli soldiers rather than a full invasion,\" Kurtzer told CNBC's \"Asia Squawk Box.\"\n\nwatch now\n\nIsrael has been amassing troops along the Gaza border in preparation for a ground offensive in a bid to eradicate Hamas militants. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces issued a 24-hour notice for 1.1 million residents in northern Gaza to evacuate to the south for their own safety.\n\nHe said Israel is still \"holding its cards very close\" and there could be operational reasons not to go in right away.\n\n\"Their bombing and artillery is designed to soften up [the part of] northern Gaza that they may in fact enter,\" said Kurtzer, who is currently a professor at Princeton University. He added there's also a psychological aspect keeping Hamas on its toes and ensuring that Israel will have some \"operational surprise.\"\n\n— Lee Ying Shan\n\nChina says Israel's actions have 'gone beyond self defense' in Gaza\n\nNurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nChina urged Israel to heed calls from the international community to end its collective punishment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Israel's actions have gone beyond self-defense and it should heed the call of the international community and the Secretary-General of the United Nations to stop its collective punishment of the people in Gaza,\" China Foreign Minister Wang Yi reportedly told his Saudi Arabia counterpart Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud in a call on Sunday.\n\nWang's comments came during a series of calls over the weekend, as world leaders worked to prevent an escalation of the Israel-Hamas war into a broader Middle East crisis.\n\nRead more here.\n\n— Clement Tan\n\nBiden says 'there needs to be a path to a Palestinian state'\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said in an interview on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that he believes Hamas must be fully eliminated and that it is necessary to establish a Palestinian state.\n\n\"There needs to be a Palestinian Authority. There needs to be a path to a Palestinian state,\" Biden said in an interview filmed Thursday, which aired Sunday evening.\n\nThe U.S. has historically been one of Israel's biggest allies. But it has also endorsed a two-state solution, which would a separate Palestinian state next to Israel.\n\nRead more on Biden's remarks here.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nOil prices ease as investors assess impact of Israel-Hamas war\n\nChristopher Furlong | Getty Images News | Getty Images\n\nOil prices eased in early Asia trade on Monday, reversing last Friday's rally as investors waited to see if the Israel-Hamas conflict draws in other countries, which could drive up prices further and deal a fresh blow to the global economy.\n\nBrent futures fell 36 cents, or 0.4%, to $90.53 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropped 37 cents, or 0.4%, to $87.32 a barrel by 2215 GMT on Sunday.\n\nBoth benchmarks rose nearly 6% on Friday, posting their highest daily percentage gains since April, as investors priced in the possibility of a wider Middle East conflict.\n\nBrent also recorded a weekly gain of 7.5%, its biggest such increase since February. WTI climbed 5.9% for the week.\n\nThe conflict in the Middle East has had little impact on global oil and gas supplies, and Israel is not a big producer.\n\nBut investors and market observers are assessing how the conflict could escalate and what it might mean for supplies from nearby countries in the world's top oil-producing region.\n\n— Reuters\n\nStock futures edge higher as investors brace for a busy earnings week and new developments in the Middle East\n\nBrendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nStock futures inched higher in overnight trading Sunday as markets faced an uncertain week ahead, with earnings season heating up and developments in the Israel-Hamas war leaving investors wary.\n\nFutures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.05%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.07% and 0.17%, respectively.\n\nOil prices spiked more than 5% during Friday's session and posted their best day since April as the conflict between Israel and Hamas fueled some fears related to oil production in the region.\n\nSome on Wall Street are bracing for more volatility into year-end as yields and oil prices rise, inflation remains sticky, and conflict ensues in the Middle East, said Eric Johnston, Cantor Fitzgerald's head of equity derivatives and cross-asset.\n\n\"This Mideast situation is kind of showing that when you own equities, you are taking risks,\" he told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" on Friday. \"As a result, you need to have good upside returns in order to justify that risk, because there are things that come out of nowhere, like this situation.\"\n\nOver the weekend, Israel's military continued urging residents to evacuate northern Gaza amid a widely anticipated ground invasion. Meanwhile, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday that the Senate would work to quickly push through a military aid package to assist Israel as it battles Hamas.\n\nSee CNBC's live blog for complete markets coverage.\n\n— Samantha Subin\n\nMan killed Muslim boy and wounded woman in hate crime motivated by Israeli-Hamas war, police say\n\nRose Abuin | New York Daily News | Tribune News Service | Getty Images\n\nA 71-year-old Illinois man was charged Sunday with a hate crime, accused of fatally stabbing a young boy and seriously wounding a woman because of their Islamic faith and the Israel-Hamas war, authorities said.\n\nOfficers found the 32-year-old woman and 6-year-old boy late Saturday morning at a home in an unincorporated area of Plainfield Township, southwest of Chicago, the Will County Sheriff's Office said in a statement on social media.\n\nThe statement added that the boy was pronounced dead at a hospital and the woman had multiple stab wounds and was expected to survive. An autopsy on the child showed he had also been stabbed multiple times.\n\n\"Detectives were able to determine that both victims in this brutal attack were targeted by the suspect due to them being Muslim and the on-going Middle Eastern conflict involving Hamas and the Israelis,\" the sheriff's statement said.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, the woman had called 911 to report that her landlord had attacked her with a knife, adding she then ran into a bathroom and continued to fight him off.\n\nThe boy was stabbed numerous times with a knife, according to an autopsy, the sheriff's office said. The woman had more than a dozen stab wounds and remained hospitalized Sunday and was expected to survive.\n\nThe Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations held a news conference later Sunday with a family member and knew their identities. It said text messages exchanged among family members showed the attacker had made disparaging remarks about Muslims.\n\nThe Muslim civil liberties organization called the crime \"our worst nightmare,\" and part of a disturbing spike in hate calls and emails since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nU.S. State Department says 30 Americans killed in Israel, 13 are still missing\n\nThe U.S. State Department says the number of Americans killed since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas has risen to 30.\n\n\"At this time, we can confirm the deaths of 30 U.S. citizens. We extend our deepest condolences to the victims and to the families of all those affected,\" the State Department said in a statement released Sunday. The U.S. is also aware of 13 missing citizens and has been in contact with their families.\n\nHamas militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7 and murdered more than 1,400 Israelis, the vast majority of them civilians. The militants also kidnapped at least 155 people — a number that includes babies and the elderly — and are holding them hostage in Gaza. Their whereabouts are not publicly known, but their families have been urgently pressing for their release.\n\n\"The U.S. government is working around the clock to determine their whereabouts and is working with the Israeli government on every aspect of the hostage crisis, including sharing intelligence and deploying experts from across the United States government to advise the Israeli government on hostage recovery efforts,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said 2,670 Palestinians have been killed so far.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nForeign national Palestinians can cross the border to Egypt from Gaza starting Monday, Palestinian Embassy says\n\nAnadolu Agency | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nPalestinians who are foreign nationals will be allowed to cross the border into Egypt starting at 9 a.m. local time on Monday, according to a representative for the Embassy of Palestine. At the same time, humanitarian aid will also begin crossing into Gaza, Kamel Khatib, a representative for the Embassy of Palestine, told NBC News.\n\n— Terri Cullen\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham warns Iran against escalating war\n\nAnna Moneymaker | Getty Images\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on Sunday warned Iran against escalating the war between Israel and Hamas, NBC News reported.\n\n\"I want to applaud President Biden for his strong statement, and support of Israel. I just got off the phone with the Israelis. Their goal is to destroy Hamas in the south and try to save as many innocent Palestinians as possible to prevent escalation north from Hezbollah,\" Graham said in an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.\n\n\"Here's my message: If Hezbollah, which is a proxy of Iran, launches a massive attack on Israel, I would consider that a threat to the State of Israel, existential in nature.\"\n\nGraham said he plans to introduce a resolution in the Senate to \"allow military action by the United States in conjunction with Israel to knock Iran out of the oil business,\" according to NBC News.\n\n\"Iran, if you escalate this war, we're coming for you,\" Graham added.\n\nRead the complete NBC News story here.\n\n— Annie Nova\n\nSenate leader Schumer says chamber will rush through military aid to Israel\n\nWin Mcnamee | Getty Images\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday that the senate would push through a military aid package to help Israel in its war against the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.\n\n\"We will work to move this aid through the senate ASAP, and the Israeli leaders made it clear to us they need the aid quickly,\" said Schumer during a trip to Israel.\n\nHe said among Israel's requests are additional interceptors for its Iron Dome missile defense system, which has been operating non-stop shooting down Hamas rockets from Gaza, and precision munitions.\n\n— Reuters\n\nMore than 1,400 killed in Israel from surprise Hamas attack\n\nShir Torem | Reuters\n\nThe death toll in Israel from a surprise Hamas attack on Oct. 7 is now more than 1,400, the Israel Defense Forces told CNN on Sunday.\n\n— Annie Nova\n\nFBI notes increase in threats against Jewish and Muslim communities\n\nJonathan Ernst | Reuters\n\nFBI officials say they've noticed an increase in threatening rhetoric targeting both the Jewish and Muslim communities in the week since the brutal Hamas attacks in Israel.\n\nDirector Chris Wray said on a call with reporters Sunday that the FBI is moving quickly to mitigate the threats and that the FBI does not discount the possibility that Hamas and other groups could exploit the conflict in the Middle East to call for or plot attacks in the United States.\n\nA senior FBI official who spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the bureau said the majority of the threats that the FBI has responded to were not judged to be credible. But the official said the FBI takes them all seriously nonetheless.\n\nThe official also said that agents have been encouraged to be \"aggressive\" and proactive in communicating over the last week with faith-based leaders. The official said the purpose of that outreach is not to make anyone feel targeted but rather to ask clerics and others to report to law enforcement anything that seems suspicious.\n\nBesides responding to an escalating number of threats, Wray said the FBI was also working through its legal attache office in Tel Aviv to do what it can to locate and identify Americans who remain unaccounted for after last weekend's attacks.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nU.S. State Department says flights out of Israel for Americans will continue Monday and Tuesday\n\nGil Cohen-magen | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. Department of State on Sunday announced that the charter flights out of Israel offered to American citizens will continue \"on a rolling basis\" on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe State Department set up the flights for U.S. citizens stranded in Israel, unable to leave due to the limited availability of commercial flights out of the country.\n\n\"We urge those wishing to leave to take advantage of these charters while they are available,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nOnly U.S. citizens are eligible for the flights and must sign an agreement prior to departure that pledges to repay the U.S. government for the travel. The flights will leave from Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport.\n\nThe department also provided details on how U.S. citizens in the Israeli city of Haifa can leave via a 10- to 12-hour ship ride to Cyprus on Monday. Those wishing to take the ship must arrive at Haifa port passenger terminal at 9 a.m. local time on Monday.\n\nThe U.S. government is still negotiating how to get American citizens in Gaza out of the region. It had secured a route of safe passage via the Rafah gate border crossing from Gaza to Egypt, but Americans trying to flee reportedly still have not been let through. In the meantime, the government is encouraging Americans in Gaza to fill out a crisis intake form in case they need to be contacted on short notice.\n\nThe State Department has issued a \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for Gaza and \"Reconsider Travel\" advisories for Israel and the West Bank.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nDeath toll in Gaza rises to 2,450\n\nThe death toll in Gaza rose to 2,450 people and 9,200 injured, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said. More than half of those killed, or 52% of them, were women and children, according to the ministry.\n\n— Annie Nova\n\nChuck Schumer and visiting U.S. senators rushed to a Tel Aviv shelter during Hamas rocket attack\n\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on social media that a bipartisan group of senators visiting Israel was rushed to a shelter in Tel Aviv on Sunday to wait out a rocket attack from Hamas. Schumer posted a photo of himself and Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah in the shelter.\n\n\"It shows you what Israelis have to go through. We must provide Israel with the support required to defend itself,\" Schumer said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nSchumer, the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the United States, took the trip to show support for Israel ahead of an expected request from President Joe Biden for Congress to approve wartime funding for Israel as well as Ukraine. Schumer, a Democrat, has said he would also hold discussions with Israeli officials what kind of support the country would need for both military and humanitarian operations.\n\nRepublican Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Democratic Sens. Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Mark Kelly of Arizona were also on the trip.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nIranian president warns war could expand if Israel's siege of Gaza continues\n\nShannon Stapleton | Reuters\n\nIran's hard-line president spoke with France's leader on Sunday, warning that war would expand if Israel's siege of Gaza doesn't stop, state-run media reported.\n\nThe official IRNA news agency said Ebrahim Raisi and Emmanuel Macron spoke over the phone. The Iranian president made no mention of the unprecedented Oct. 7 incursion by Gaza's militant Hamas group into southern Israel that sparked the latest Hamas-Israel war. Iran has long been a supporter of Hamas.\n\n\"The situation will be complicated ... if the crimes by the Zionist regime, including the killing of people and blockade of Gaza, are not stopped,\" Raisi was quoted as saying, referring to Israel. IRNA did not provide further details.\n\nEarlier, the Elysee Palace confirmed this weekend that Macron planned to talk to Raisi to urge Iran not to fuel tensions in the region or provide any operational support to Hamas.\n\nMacron intended to press the argument that bringing the violence to a rapid end is in everyone's interests, including Iran's, the presidential office said. France feels that Iran can play a positive role in the crisis by simply not getting involved in it, either with \"words that are unacceptable\" or by supporting Hamas.\n\nOver the weekend, Raisi also spoke with leaders of Arab nations of Iraq, Oman and Qatar and urged them to support Gaza's Palestinians, Iranian media said.\n\nHe also accused Israel of perpetrating a \"genocide\" in Gaza and criticized the United States for its support of Israel.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nBlinken meets with Egyptian president, reiterates need for 'safe passage' for Americans in Gaza\n\nJacquelyn Martin | Pool | via Reuters\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Egypt on Sunday to discuss the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and how to keep civilians safe amid the violence and lack of humanitarian aid in Gaza.\n\nIn the meeting, Blinken brought up the ongoing efforts to get American citizens in Gaza safely out of the region. The secretary had been trying to find a way for Americans to exit Gaza via the Rafah gate into Egypt, but those trying to leave have reported that the border crossing has remained closed.\n\n\"Secretary Blinken reiterated to President El-Sisi the importance of facilitating the safe passage of American citizens and family members from Gaza,\" a spokesperson for Blinken said.\n\nOver the past week, Blinken has been on a Middle East tour, trying to prevent the conflict from spreading throughout the region and to rally humanitarian support for civilians caught in the crossfire of the war.\n\nBlinken has met with officials in Israel, Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt. The State Department announced that he will return to Israel on Monday.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nWhite House national security advisor says Israel has turned water back on in some parts of Gaza\n\nJonathan Ernst | Reuters\n\nWhite House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Israel has reactivated the water pipes in southern Gaza after several days of cutting off the water supply in response to the deadly attack Hamas launched last weekend.\n\n\"I have been in touch with my Israeli counterparts just within the last hour who reports to me that they have in fact turned the water pipe back on in southern Gaza,\" Sullivan said Sunday in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"That has been the subject of discussion over the course of the past few days,\" he added.\n\nIn a series of Sunday interviews, Sullivan reiterated the U.S. stance that all innocent civilians must be protected amid the violence of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nHis comments come as many civilians remain trapped in Gaza without access to basic necessities like food, water, medicine and shelter.\n\n\"The many, many Palestinians who have had nothing to do with the brutal terrorist organization among us the vast majority of the population of Gaza. They deserve dignity.
