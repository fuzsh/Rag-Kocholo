        "text": "The number of people killed in Gaza from Israeli attacks since October 7 now stands at 14,854, including 5,850 children, according to information from Hamas authorities in the strip.\n\nGetting up-to-date information on the number of fatalities in Gaza has become harder as Israel’s massive air and ground campaign grinds on.\n\nOn Monday, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah, which takes its data from hospitals and other sources in the Gaza Strip, put the number killed at 12,700.\n\nIn health updates since then, the Ramallah-based ministry said serious disruptions to communications networks in Gaza have made its own efforts at accurate data collection impossible.\n\nThe United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which collects and audits data from across the occupied Palestinian territories, has continued to cite the figures originating from Gaza.\n\nOn Wednesday, UN OCHA chief Martin Griffiths told CNN the UN stood by its use of statistics from the Health Ministry in Gaza, saying his team had “triangulated [the numbers] over the years to make sure we feel confident about them.”\n\n“We don’t put these figures out without thought,” he said.\n\nA senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the fragility of the hostage agreement with Hamas, saying he is keeping his “fingers crossed” it will go ahead.\n\nSome context: A truce between Israel and Hamas is scheduled to begin Friday at 7 a.m. local time (midnight ET), with 13 civilian hostages to be released by Hamas hours later, according to key deal negotiator Qatar. More will follow, with a total of 50 hostages expected to be freed over four days, while Palestinian prisoners are also released in waves.\n\nThe hostage release was initially supposed to take place Thursday but was delayed until Friday. Regev said he couldn’t “go into the details” of why the plan was pushed back by a day.\n\n“All I can say is that I’m hopeful that it will happen tomorrow. Like President Biden, I’m keeping my fingers crossed,” Regev said.\n\nAsked how confident he was that this will be the beginning of at least 50 Israeli hostages coming home, Regev said: “That’s the understanding reached. And that’s what we’re hoping for. Though it’s bittersweet, because if we get 50 home, there’s still 190 in Hamas captivity being held hostage and, of course, we want them all home.”\n\nWhen pressed on whether he had confidence the deal would ultimately work, Regev said, “I don’t have a lot of confidence.”\n\nPalestinians in Deir Al Balah, in the center of the Gaza Strip, expressed hope for an end to the hostilities ahead of an expected truce beginning Friday.\n\n“We hope for a truce, we are tired. The people of Gaza are tired,” said one woman who had fled south from Gaza City, the focus of Israel’s massive air and ground campaign.\n\nA man told CNN he had fled to Deir Al Balah from the Al Shati refugee camp, located just north of Gaza City. He, too, said he wanted an end to the constant state of anxiety.\n\n“[A truce] will be a good beginning, and the fear in us will go away,” he said.\n\nAll the people CNN spoke to talked on condition of anonymity.\n\nAnother man similarly addressed the mental respite a truce would provide.\n\n“If there is a truce, we will be mentally relieved; the truce is a mental comfort,” he said.\n\nA third man told CNN he hoped the truce would see an increase in aid entering the Strip — as the terms of the agreement lay out — as well as the restoration of electricity.\n\nHe expressed hope the four-day pause would become something permanent and that the war would end.\n\n“We hope they will reach an agreement and that it will be an agreement that allows us to hold our head high,” he said.\n\nIn the first release of Hamas’ hostages held in Gaza, scheduled for Friday afternoon local time, 13 women and children will be freed, according to a spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, Majed Al-Ansari.\n\nAl-Ansari could not provide details on who the hostages are, nor could he provide details on the route they might take due to safety reasons. However, many of the first 50 hostages are expected to come out through Egypt.\n\nThe Israeli government said their families and the families of hostages who will not be released had been notified. Al-Ansari also revealed that hostages from the same families will be released together in the first group.\n\nMeanwhile, an Israeli official tells CNN a total of 39 Palestinian prisoners will be released Friday as part of the deal.\n\nThe prisoners will be taken from two jails — Damon and Megiddo, both southeast of Haifa — and driven to the Ofer prison, south of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, for final checks by the Red Cross.\n\nWomen and male teenagers up to the age of 18 are expected to make up the released prisoners.\n\nThe timing of the release is unclear, but the Israeli official said the prisoners would not be freed until the hostages from Gaza are back in Israeli hands.\n\nHere’s what else you should know this Thursday:\n\nTwo more months of fighting: Israel’s defense minister says he expects the military operation against Hamas will continue “forcefully” after the brief truce, for at least two months.\n\nNo names of Palestinian prisoners: A Palestinian official told CNN he has not yet received a list of names of those expected to be released from Israeli prisons on Friday.\n\nBiden hopeful 3-year-old American freed: US President Joe Biden said he has his “fingers crossed” that a 3-year-old American girl held hostage by Hamas will be freed on Friday. But he said he will not provide further updates until the deal is finished.\n\nUS will contact American hostage families: The US will contact family members of American hostages who are freed from Gaza “after we have confirmation they are departing Gaza,” a US official said.\n\nHezbollah fires rockets at Israel: Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fired 48 rockets at the headquarters of an Israeli infantry unit at Ein Zeitim military base earlier Thursday. In a statement, Hezbollah said it also fired a guided missile at Israeli Merkava tanks located near Al-Raheb, near the Israeli town of Shtula, and targeted Israeli infantry forces in the area.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said it “intercepted a number of the launches,” and later confirmed that it used helicopters and fighter jets to strike Hezbollah infrastructure and rocket launch sites in Lebanon, in response to the militant group’s attacks.\n\nMedical aid group says 80 aid trucks entered Gaza from Egypt: The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says it received 80 trucks that entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing on Thursday. The trucks brought food, water, medical equipment, medications and general relief equipment into Gaza, the PRCS said.\n\nA large convoy of aid trucks is lined up at the Rafah border crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border — on standby for when a pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas begins. The United Nations anticipates that aid trucks will move into the strip “immediately” after the Israel-Hamas truce commences, an official told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said a commander of Hamas’ naval forces was killed Thursday in an airstrike in Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza.\n\n“Amar Abu Jalalah was a senior operative in Hamas’ naval forces and involved in directing several terror attacks by sea that were thwarted by the IDF,” the IDF statement read.\n\nAnother member of Hamas’ naval forces was also killed in the strike, the military said.\n\nIsrael believes it is having some success in removing senior Hamas military operatives, which a senior IDF official discussed with journalists earlier this week.\n\nIsrael’s assessment suggested the military wing of Hamas was made up of 24 battalions, 10 of which had been “hurt significantly” by Israeli strikes since October 7, the official said.\n\nSome battalions in the north of Gaza lost more than four of their commanders, the official said, representing a loss to those battalions of more than half their senior command.\n\nAmong other things, this made it harder for the military leadership of Hamas to issue orders for counterattacks, the official said, because there was increasingly no one available to direct operations.\n\nReplacing commanders in the middle of a war was not possible, the official added.\n\nOne of the very few medical staff members still at Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza has told CNN heavy airstrikes are creating even deeper challenges for evacuating staff and patients.\n\nDr. Ahmed Mokhallalati said there were still hundreds of people at the hospital, describing the situation as “really terrifying here.”\n\nMokhallalati, who is head of plastic surgery and burns at Al-Shifa, said he was one of only two doctors at the hospital, which has seen an extensive presence of the Israeli military for more than a week.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces have reported uncovering extensive tunnel networks used by Hamas at the hospital, whose director was detained Wednesday while in a United Nations-led convoy heading south.\n\nMokhallalati said the last evacuation was supposed to be on Wednesday for the remaining patients. “Unfortunately, Israel allowed the WHO and the UN to get only 14 ambulances and two buses with 20 passengers each,” he said.\n\nMokhallalati said the IDF had repeatedly demanded the hospital be evacuated, but he had insisted that was not possible without ambulances, as many of the patients had severe back injuries, including spinal fractures. “These patients, at least 57 of them, they should be on a stretcher,” he told CNN.\n\nTwenty patients in wheelchairs had decided to leave the hospital on their own Thursday, he said, along with approximately 50 family members. Another 50 people who had been staying at the hospital had also left.\n\nMokhallalati said that for maybe 10 days the hospital has had no electricity, no water, drinking water or fresh food. Those still there were getting by on tinned food.\n\nMokhallalati said the truce due to begin at 7 a.m. local time Friday was “the only hope to evacuate the patients in a proper way.”\n\nThirty-nine Palestinian prisoners will be released Friday as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas to secure the release of hostages from Gaza, an Israeli official has told CNN.\n\nThe prisoners will be taken from two jails — Damon and Megiddo, both southeast of Haifa — and driven to the Ofer prison, south of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, for final checks by the Red Cross.\n\nFrom there they will be driven through the nearby Beitunia crossing point and on to their hometowns and villages in the West Bank.\n\nWomen and male teenagers up to the age of 18 are expected to make up the released prisoners.\n\nThe timing of the release is unclear, but the Israeli official said the prisoners would not be freed until the hostages from Gaza are back in Israeli hands.\n\nThose hostages — which CNN has already reported number 13 women and children — are expected to be released at 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET).\n\nThe official said the hostages will enter Israel at two locations, the Nitzana border crossing with Egypt, and directly via the Kerem Shalom crossing from Gaza.\n\nOnce back on Israeli territory, the freed hostages will be taken by helicopter to two hospitals close to Tel Aviv, the official added.\n\nQatar will receive a list with the names of hostages expected to be released by Hamas in a “day-by-day process,” Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari said in a news conference Thursday.\n\nQatar will hand the names over to the Israeli intelligence service, Mossad, which will in turn hand over a list of Palestinian prisoners expected to be released to the Qataris, he added.\n\n“Whenever we have both lists confirmed, this is when we can begin with the process of getting people out,” Al-Ansari said.\n\nOnce released, the hostages will be handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross, Al-Ansari said.\n\nSome background: The Israel-Hamas hostage deal will see the release of 50 women and children held captive in Gaza by the militant group, according to Qatar, which mediated negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIn return, Israel will grant a “humanitarian pause” in its assault of the enclave and release some Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe truce will begin Friday at 7 a.m. local time (midnight ET), with an initial group of 13 civilian hostages set to be released around 4 p.m. local time, Qatar said Thursday.\n\nThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group that sprang up in response to the Hamas attack on Israel, lists 39 children and 58 women believed to be alive and held hostage in Gaza since October 7. The women range in age from 19 to 85.\n\nEleven of them are mothers of children also being held hostage, according to the group.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it fired 48 rockets targeting the headquarters of an Israeli infantry unit at Ein Zeitim military base, near the town of Safed in northern Israel.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Hezbollah said it also fired a guided missile at Israeli Merkava tanks located near Al-Raheb, near the Israeli town of Shtula, and targeted Israeli infantry forces in the area.\n\nHezbollah also launched nine other attacks on Israeli military posts and soldier gatherings Thursday morning, including in Jal Alalam, Berket Risha, Al-Manara and Ramim.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said it “intercepted a number of the launches,” and later confirmed that it used helicopters and fighter jets to strike Hezbollah infrastructure and rocket launch sites in Lebanon, in response to the militant group’s attacks.\n\n“In addition, an IDF helicopter, a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), and tanks struck a terrorist cell that launched an anti-tank missile toward the area of Biranit, and the launch post from which the missile was fired.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Lebanese state news agency (NNA) said that on Wednesday afternoon and in the overnight hours, it recorded the highest number of Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes on southern Lebanon since this round of hostilities began on October 8.\n\nNNA reported on Thursday that several towns along the border came under Israeli artillery fire in the morning.\n\nRemember: Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed paramilitary group, is one of the central focuses of international concerns that the war between Israel and Hamas could expand into a broader conflict in the Middle East.\n\nThe group’s leadership has expressed support for Palestinians and condemned Israel’s offensive in Gaza, but has yet to directly intervene on Hamas’ behalf.\n\nSkirmishes at the Israel-Lebanon border, however, have seen an uptick since Hamas launched its October 7 terror attacks in Israel. The crossfire is becoming increasingly deadly.\n\nA truce between Israel and Hamas will begin at 7 a.m. local time (midnight ET) on Friday, and civilian hostages will be released at 4 p.m. local time, Qatar announced Thursday.\n\nThirteen women and children will be released, according to a spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, Majed Al-Ansari.\n\nAn undisclosed number of Palestinian prisoners are also set to be released around 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET), after the hostages are freed from Gaza, the Qatari spokesperson said in a news conference.\n\nThe route the freed hostages will take cannot be disclosed for safety reasons, Al-Ansari said in response to a question from CNN. Qatar will be working closely on the operation with the Red Cross and “parties of the conflict.”\n\nThe list of hostages expected to be released has been handed to the Israeli intelligence service Mossad, and talks between all mediating parties continued until this morning, Al-Ansari said.\n\nIsrael is “examining the details of the list and are in the meantime communicating with all the families of the kidnapped,” Ofir Gendelman, the Israeli prime minister’s spokesperson to the Arab world, wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nRemember: A truce was slated to begin Thursday but was delayed. Under the Israel-Hamas deal, at least 50 hostages held in Gaza are to be freed.\n\nThis post has been updated with further details from the news conference.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has arrested the director of Al-Shifa, Gaza’s largest hospital.\n\nMohammad Abu Salmiya was detained for questioning “following evidence that the Shifa Hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control center,” the IDF said in a statement Thursday.\n\nAbu Salmiya was reportedly arrested while evacuating from the the embattled Al-Shifa hospital as part of a convoy marshalled by the World Health Organization. In response to his arrest, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza said it had suspended cooperation with WHO and said the United Nations “bears full responsibility” for his detention.\n\nMeanwhile, if all had gone to plan, by this time the skies in Gaza would have finally fallen silent, and some of the Israeli hostages would have returned home to their loved ones. But the Israel-Hamas truce agreement, slated to begin earlier on Thursday morning, was delayed and will not come into effect at least until Friday, diplomatic sources have told CNN.\n\nHere are the latest developments:\n\nAl-Shifa arrest: Abu Salmiya was reportedly arrested Thursday while evacuating with a World Health Organization convoy, a doctor in the hospital told Al-Jazeera. The IDF later confirmed it had detained Salmiya, saying “there was extensive Hamas terrorist activity” inside the hospital under his management. “He was in a constant state of denial saying it doesn’t happen. How could a General Manager of the hospital not know about the extent of the tunnel system?” an IDF spokesperson told CNN. Israel launched a “targeted” operation inside Al-Shifa last week, trapping patients, doctors, refugees and newborns inside the complex it says Hamas has used as a military base. Hamas denies the allegations.\n\nWHO criticized: The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said it has suspended operation with the WHO after Salmiya’s arrest. Ashraf Al-Qidra, a spokesperson for the ministry, said the IDF on Wednesday stopped a WHO convoy at a checkpoint in central Gaza, as it was attempting to evacuate people from Al-Shifa. Al-Qidra said the IDF arrested several medical staff, including Salmiya, and as such the ministry had suspended cooperation with WHO and blamed the United Nations for failing to safeguard its staff. “The United Nations bears full responsibility for this event and we await appropriate and urgent measures on their part to address this,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nTruce delayed: Plans to release the first hostages under the deal Israel reached with Hamas were delayed overnight, just hours ahead of the expected beginning of a hard-negotiated pause in fighting. The truce – which would see an initial four-day pause to allow more aid to enter Gaza and the first hostages to be released – will now not begin until Friday, an Israeli official told CNN. Qatar, which has played a crucial role in the painstaking negotiations, is imminently set to announce when the truce will begin.\n\nAn agonizing wait: In the meantime, Israeli strikes in Gaza are showing no sign of relenting ahead of the pause in fighting. The IDF said Thursday it had struck more than 300 Hamas targets over the past day – a slight uptick from the 250 strikes it reported Tuesday. Further south, a large convoy of trucks carrying aid has lined up on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, on standby for when the truce finally begins.\n\nIndonesian Hospital: Hundreds of patients and medical staff have been told by the IDF to evacuate the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza said Thursday. About 450 patients and medical staff are now traveling to the Nasser Hospital and the European Hospital in the south of Gaza, Dr. Munir Al-Bursh, the ministry’s director-general, was quoted in a statement as saying. Israel stepped up its strikes on the Indonesian Hospital earlier this week, alleging that Hamas have used the building for military purposes.\n\nHezbollah-Iran meeting: Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian is in Lebanon, where he met with the leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah Thursday. Nasrallah reportedly stressed the “readiness of the resistance on various fronts,” according to a statement from the Iranian Foreign Ministry. In a separate statement, Hezbollah said the two discussed the “existing possibilities regarding the course of events and efforts to stop Israeli aggression on Gaza.” The Iran-Hezbollah meeting comes amid fears that Israel’s offensive in Gaza could spiral into a broader regional conflict.\n\nThe director of Gaza’s largest hospital was arrested by Israeli forces, according to a spokesperson for the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.\n\nOther doctors were also arrested alongside Al-Shifa Hospital director Mohammed Abu Salmiya, spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra said Thursday.\n\nAbu Salmiya was reportedly arrested while evacuating with a World Health Organization convoy, an ER doctor inside Al-Shifa told Al-Jazeera News, citing doctors accompanying the director.\n\nResponding to a CNN request for comment, the IDF would not confirm the arrest of Abu Salmiya, but said he “needs to be questioned.”\n\n“We need to see exactly what he can share with us about his knowledge,” the IDF spokesperson went on to say.\n\nA flashpoint: Last week, the IDF launched what it called a “precise and targeted” operation against Hamas inside Al-Shifa, the largest hospital in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly accused Hamas of using the hospital for military purposes, which Hamas and hospital officials deny.\n\nAbu Salmiya warned during the IDF’s operation of the deteriorating humanitarian crisis inside the hospital, as hundreds of wounded people, dozens of premature babies and thousands of displaced people were caught up in the fighting.\n\n“The children are starving, and here I mean the displaced children because they need milk and there is no water to make milk for them,” Abu Salmiya said last week.\n\nHe accused the “Israeli occupation” of besieging the hospital, sabotaging sections and roaming within its premises.\n\nA large convoy of aid trucks has lined up on the Egyptian side of the the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, on standby for when a truce between Israel and Hamas begins.\n\nThe Egyptian Government press office told CNN on Thursday that it’s not yet clear what type of aid, or how much aid, will be allowed into the Gaza Strip.\n\nOn Wednesday, Egyptian Government press office director Ayman Walash said a total of 2,222 tons of medical aid had been delivered via the Rafah crossing since the war began, in addition to 6,063 tons of food, 4,625 tons of water, and 1,407 tons of other aid.\n\nHe said 378 tons of fuel had been delivered since November 21, he told CNN.\n\nA journalist reporting for CNN on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing on Thursday noted there were several dozen trucks lined up at the border.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, about 455 trucks entered Gaza daily with aid supplies, according to the United Nations. While some aid has been able to trickle into the enclave since the recent hostilities began, the UN has repeatedly warned the current levels are doing little to address the needs of more than 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza.\n\nSome context: A truce between Israel and Hamas slated to begin Thursday morning has now been delayed until Friday, an Israeli official told CNN, citing “minor implementation details.”\n\nAs well as providing for the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the agreement would also set to initiate a four-day pause in the fighting, allowing more aid to flow into Gaza.\n\nNo hostages will be released before Friday, according to the Israel National Security Council.\n\nThe first hostages were initially expected to be released as early as Thursday. The start of an agreed temporary truce in fighting is also delayed until Friday, an Israeli official told CNN.\n\nThere is uncertainty over the reasons behind the delay from Gaza, with one Israeli official familiar with the matter downplaying its seriousness. They reduced the issue down to “fairly minor implementation details.”\n\nIsrael’s Supreme Court rejected a legal challenge to the Gaza hostage deal. Also, the hostage deal does not include the “release of murderers,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday while disclosing more details from the agreement.\n\nHere are other headlines you should know:\n\nMore on the hostage situation: “Intensive” work was needed to broker the Israel-Hamas hostage deal, according to the the Qatari minister of state for foreign affairs who also served as the lead negotiator for the deal. As part of the deal, the United States and Israel will both pause drone flights over Gaza for six hours each day, Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer told CNN. Additionally, US officials have a working list of 10 hostages they believe are likely to be released from Gaza on day one, a source familiar told CNN.\n\nHumanitarian crisis: The Gaza Strip is “the most dangerous place” in the world to be a child, according to the executive director of the United Nations Children’s Fund. Elsewhere, a total of 284 injured patients have been evacuated into Egypt since Israel launched attacks on Gaza following the October 7 Hamas attack, according to Egyptian government press office director Ayman Walash. Also, the Red Cross will be allowed to visit and offer medical support to the hostages that remain in Gaza after some of them are returned, Netanyahu said.\n\nInternational input: The Biden administration will watch the implementation of the deal made between Israel and Hamas, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday. The Norwegian Refugee Council said it needs longer than a four-day pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas to expand aid operations in Gaza, and the lull should lead to a full ceasefire.\n\nIsrael Defense Forces claims: The IDF said it found further evidence of a tunnel complex under Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza. The IDF said special forces had exposed “dozens of meters of a tunnel system” that passed under another building in the hospital complex, “as well as rooms where Hamas terrorists can operate and stay for extended periods.”\n\nThe Biden administration will watch the implementation of the deal made between Israel and Hamas, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday.\n\nKirby said that the administration will be watching “very closely” to make sure that Hamas holds up their end of the hostage deal.\n\nKirby also offered some explanation into the remaining American hostages, explaining that there are 10 unaccounted-for Americans, and they are all believed to be held captive at this time.\n\nThree Americans would fall into the women and children category that is part of the release deal, and the US is optimistic the three “will be in at least one of the increments.”\n\nBut he continued to express some caution: “We’ll have to watch — the truth is we won’t know for sure until we start to see people moving.”\n\nPressed by CNN’s Bianna Golodryga on whether there is proof all of the hostages are still alive, Kirby hedged.\n\n“Our information is limited about all the hostages, including the remaining American hostages. So I can’t tell you definitively that we have proof of life on all of them. But I can say that we have no indication to the contrary. So we’re going to continue to work on this as hard as we can,” he said."
