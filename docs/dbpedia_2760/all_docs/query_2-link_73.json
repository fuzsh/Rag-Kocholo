        "meta_description": "Avec le same de Pite, d’Akkala et de Ter, le same d’Ume fait partie des langues sames faiblement étudiées. Cela tient manifestement au fait que l’étude des langues sames s’est concentrée sur les langues les plus parlées, laissant dans l’ombre les autres. En même temps, il faut reconnaître que cette évolution ne manque pas d’étonner, car le same d’Ume présentait quelques avantages qui auraient pu lui garantir une place parmi les langues bien étudiées sur le long terme. En effet, il était parlé au cœur de la Laponie historique, autour de Lycksele, centre ecclésiastique et culturel : c’est ainsi qu’il a joué un rôle important dans l’histoire du développement de la langue littéraire dite « same » de Suède. Sans doute cependant c’est sa similitude structurelle avec le same du Sud qui lui a été fatale. Comme la samologie historico-comparative des débuts n’était pas en mesure de tirer au clair les différences entre les deux langues, le same d’Ume a été longtemps classifié comme un dialecte du same du Sud. C’est ainsi que la recherche s’est de plus en plus concentrée sur le same du Sud, ce qui a conduit au fait que le same d’Ume a été presque entièrement ignoré. Certes, cette langue a été largement collectée, notamment au début du xxe siècle, mais nos connaissances sur cette langue restent aujourd’hui élémentaires et lacunaires, car les matériaux existants n’ont jamais été publiés. Cet article reconstruit aussi bien, du point de vue de l’histoire des idées que de l’historiographie, la manière dont le same d’Ume est devenu une langue oubliée : il ne faut pas négliger le rôle de relations personnelles compliquées (Wiklund avec Halász et Collinder avec Wiklund) ainsi que les théories linguistiques de l’époque.",

        "text": "1. – Ume Saami – The forgotten language\n\n1.1. – “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link”\n\n1.2. – When language borders, state borders and academic borders coincide\n\n1.3. – Ume Saami as a weak link\n\n2. – From colonization to “lapp‑skall‑vara‑lapp politics”\n\n5Ume Saami used to be the dominant Saami language of the historical Åsele‑ and Lycksele lappmark (also known as Ume lappmark) as well as the southern parts of Pite lappmark. In comparison to other lappmark territories such as Torne‑ and Lule lappmark, the aforementioned territories were colonized comparatively late and contrary to general belief, not exclusively by Swedish settlers (Siegl, 2015). Whereas the first, mainly Finnish speaking colonialists arrived in the early 17th century, the main bulk of Swedish colonialists arrived almost a century later. Usually, Swedish colonialism started with the arrival of Lutheran pastors who erected churches and opened schools. Whereas the first settlers were often employees of the local church (and in Arjeplog miners), the second wave of colonialists was made up by ethnic Swedes who went inland from cities like Umeå, Skellefteå, Piteå and Luleå looking for suitable farmsteads (see Siegl, 2014, for a condensed historical overview). Simultaneously with the arrival of Swedish colonialists, speakers of Ume and especially of Pite Saami shifted from a semi‑nomadic way of life to permanent settlement. This was possible because the traditional Forest Saami culture relied on small-scale reindeer herding which did not require a fully nomadic way of life. Initially, the transition did not imply drastic changes. In a later phase, economic patterns of non‑Saami colonialists were copied, and Saami settlers started to herd goats, sheep and occasionally even cows. This cultural shift was followed by language shift. Already in the early 19th century, the pastor Petrus Læstadius reported that in Åsele, Frederika, Dorotea, Vilhelmina and Lycksele one could hear Saami only sporadically. In Arjeplog, Arvidsjaur, Sorsele and Stensele, Swedish started to dominate, but occasionally one could still find Saamis who hardly spoke any Swedish (Læstadius, 1928, pp. 63‑65).\n\n3. – The lappish book language and its relation to Ume Saami\n\n4. – Ume Saami and South Saami – Dialects of one language or two independent languages?\n\n4.1. – Ume Saami and South Saami – A note on research history\n\n14Whereas the first decades of research on South and Ume Saami enjoyed a rather promising start, the situation began to change, and this resulted in additional South Saami research and a neglect of Ume Saami. Ultimately, K. B. Wiklund was responsible for this. In several writings, Wiklund predicted that the Forest Saamis would not have a future and were doomed to become extinct soon. Therefore, he claimed, the type of reindeer husbandry practiced by Forest Saamis should be given up in order to free agricultural space for Swedish farmers. Following lapp‑skall‑vara‑lapp politics, Wiklund claimed that only those Saamis who practiced reindeer husbandry in the mountains would eventually avoid assimilation (see Karlsson, 2000: 50‑51). Although Wiklund’s statement was not intended to be linguistic, it affected, perhaps even unconsciously, linguistic research by causing the latter’s focus to shift away from the Forest Saami languages in Sweden.\n\n18The only other sizeable data on Ume Saami published after Halász again derives from the work of a non‑Scandinavian scholar. Wolfgang Schlachter’s material from Malå, collected in the spring of 1940 in Setsele and published as Schlachter (1958) is a text collection with some rudimentary inflectional paradigms and a dictionary. The data gathered by Schlachter reflects the idiolect of Lars Sjulsson but due to the absence of other published materials except for the short section in Sámien lukkeme‑gärjá (Bergsland & Hasselbrink, 1957, pp. 65‑74), the idiolect of Lars Sjulsson from Malå became synonymous with Ume Saami (see e.g., Larsson, 2010, 2012).\n\n19This covers all primary materials for modern Ume Saami published in the 20th century and shows that despite Wiklund’s critique the majority of published primary materials on Ume Saami have been compiled by non‑Swedish researchers. Most certainly, Ume Saami does not qualify as an undocumented language as dedicated research started in the 1870s and primary materials were able to be collected until the beginning of the 21st century. What this condensed overview shows is why Ume Saami, paradoxically, is a weak link in the Saami language chain. Despite the existence of data, there is still hardly any data.\n\n4.2. – On idiolects, dialects, performance, competence and representativity\n\n4.3. – Impression from the Ume Saami borders\n\n21Given the fact that the Saami languages are seen as a chain of languages, where can one draw the border between a language and a dialect, especially when existing data is fragmentary? The following sections briefly present two instances which demonstrate problems older research had to face due to the lack of published materials but whose decisions have had some impact on research even up to today.\n\n4.3.1. – Ume Saami in Norway?\n\n23In order to investigate the South and Ume Saami border within a chain of dialects in which borders are by definition fuzzy, any answer requires a mix of phonological, morphological, lexical and even syntactic arguments. Larsson (2012) has rightfully emphasized this problem and has convincingly proven that there is not a single linguistic trait that would help to unequivocally identify a variety as either South or Ume Saami. Based on available evidence as contained in Qvigstad (1996), the current classification of Hattfjelldal as South Saami appears justified, although the shape of personal pronouns and the frequent use of the copula in the present tense are slightly untypical for South Saami. Nonetheless, despite the existence of published materials, the border is still unsettled as additional data on this area has never been published.\n\n4.3.2. – The northern border of Ume Saami\n\n4.3.3. – How to identify meaningful differences between South Saami and Ume Saami\n\n4.3.3.1. – Copula\n\n271) saU\n\n4.3.3.2. – Differential object marking\n\n28South Saami shows differential object marking in the plural, a feature which is restricted to South Saami only. The following examples demonstrate its basic properties. In singular, the accusative case takes overt object marking:\n\n292) saS\n\na.\n\nAehtjie\n\nledtiem\n\nvöötji\n\nfather\n\nbird.acc\n\nshoot.prt.3sg\n\n‘Father shot a/the bird.’ [Bergsland 1994, p. 59]\n\n30In plural, nominative encodes indefinite objects (3a) and accusative definite objects (3b):\n\n313) saS\n\n32This syntactic peculiarity is absent from Ume Saami where plural objects only appear in the accusative case:\n\n334) saU\n\n4.3.3.3. – Expression of possession\n\n34To express possession, South Saami uses a genitive copula construction or a transitive possessive verb utnedh ‘keep, have’:\n\n355) saS\n\n376) saU\n\n4.3.3.4. – Predicative agreement\n\n38Predicative adjectives do not show number agreement in South Saami:\n\n397) saS\n\na.\n\nNoere\n\ndïhte.\n\nyoung\n\ndem\n\n‘He is young.’ [Bergsland 1994, p. 52]\n\nb.\n\nDijjieh\n\nnoere\n\ndem.pl\n\nyoung\n\n‘They are young.’ [Bergsland 1994, p. 52]\n\n40In Ume Saami, number agreement is required (8) similar to North Saami (9) and other Saami languages:\n\n418) saU\n\na.\n\nmuv\n\nbååtsuj\n\nleä\n\ntjappie\n\n1sg.gen\n\nreindeer\n\nbe.3sg\n\nbeautiful\n\n‘My reindeer is beautiful.’ [NL]\n\nb.\n\nmuv\n\nbuuts\n\nleäh\n\ntjappie‑h\n\n1sg.gen\n\nreindeer.pl\n\nbe.3pl\n\nbeautiful-pl\n\n‘My reindeer are beautiful.’ [NL]\n\n429) saN\n\na.\n\nson\n\nlea\n\nnuorra.\n\n3sg\n\nbe.3sg\n\nyoung\n\n‘He is young.’\n\nb.\n\nsii\n\nleat\n\nnuora-t\n\n3pl\n\nbe.3pl\n\nyoung‑pl\n\n‘They are young.’\n\n4.4. – The relationship between saU and saS – a final remark\n\nIt is symptomatic that Ume Saami is treated separately in the book (Bergsland & Hasselbrink, F.S.), in spite of the fact that the authors themselves regard Ume Saami as a dialect within South Saami.\n\nTable 1 – Case suffix inventory for saS, saU and saP.\n\nsaS (Bergsland 1994)\n\nsaU (Korhonen & Barruk, n.d.)\n\nsaP (Lehtiranta 1992)\n\nsg\n\npl\n\nsg\n\npl\n\nsg\n\npl\n\nnom\n\n-h\n\nnom\n\n-h\n\nnom\n\ngen\n\n-n\n\n-j, -i\n\ngen\n\n-n\n\n-ij\n\ngen\n\n-\n\n(-j)\n\nacc\n\n-m\n\n-ide/-idie\n\nacc\n\n-v/-b\n\n-ijde\n\nacc\n\n-v\n\n-jt\n\nill\n\n-(a)n, -se/-asse\n\n-ide, idie\n\nill\n\n-je\n\n-ijde\n\nill\n\n-j\n\n-ta\n\niness\n\n-sne/-isnie\n\n-ine/-inie\n\niness\n\n-sne\n\n-ijsne\n\niness\n\n-n\n\n-n\n\nelat\n\n-ste/-istie\n\n-jste/-ijstie\n\nelat\n\n-ste\n\n-ijste\n\nelat\n\n-st\n\n-st\n\ncom\n\n-ine/-inie\n\n-j, -i + gu(e)jmie\n\ncom\n\n-ne\n\n-jguime\n\ncom\n\n-jn(a)\n\n-j\n\ness\n\n-ine/inie\n\nESS\n\ness\n\ness\n\n-n\n\n5. – Why do we know so little about Ume Saami?\n\n45As mentioned in the introduction, an account focusing entirely on research history is not sufficient to explain why Ume Saami has become a weak link in the chain of Saami languages. Neither geographical nor historical reasons seem to have hindered research on Ume Saami. However, when one takes the history of thought into consideration, further distinctive arguments become available and as a matter of fact, several have already been introduced in disguise in the previous section and will be re‑approached below. As structural properties have turned out not to be decisive, a closer look at the concept of language prevailing at the height of early investigations is instructive and offers further hints.\n\n5.1. – Earlier concepts of language\n\n48Finally, given that two varieties such as South Saami and Ume Saami appear structurally close, earlier research would have been required to assemble sufficient material on all levels of grammar for comparative work in order to approve or disprove proximity. As we know today, this has not happened. Whereas prior Saami research assumed that Ume Saami was simply a variety of South Saami with limited consonant gradation and some additional differences in the lexicon, this perspective could only be uphold by relying on a structural‑historical concept of language focusing only on phonetics/phonology, morphology and the lexicon. As the syntacto‑centric perspective in section 4 has shown, there are indeed morphosyntactic differences between South Saami and Ume Saami, but this perspective was excluded by the dominant view of language during the first half of the 20th century, and to some degree even later.\n\n5.2. – Collecting materials for the sake of collecting?\n\n49Despite the lack of published materials, Ume Saami is certainly not unknown and sizeable written collections exist at the Institute for Language and Folklore in Uppsala. However, the size of this collection only becomes understandable when one has a chance to browse through archive shelves and the database of digitized sound recordings. After two intensive weeks in those archives searching and inventorying Ume Saami materials, I have come to the conclusion that in earlier days, data collection must have been understood as a goal of its own that did not necessarily presuppose later publication. Whereas several manuscripts of Calleberg were re‑written for potential publication, the vast amount of written data gathered by e.g., Valter Jansson, Björn Collinder, Israel Ruong or Tryggve Sköld were deposited unaltered and apparently were never intended to be published. As Saami studies continues to suffer from a constant lack of manpower, just the amount of written data accumulated on Ume Saami alone would require the life‑times of several researchers just to turn primary materials into a publishable format. Unfortunately, it remains unclear how this is to be achieved in an academic world without permanent positions and with an increasing focus on short‑term projects which by definition stand in opposition to the creation of primary materials.\n\n6. – Conclusions\n\nGloses"
