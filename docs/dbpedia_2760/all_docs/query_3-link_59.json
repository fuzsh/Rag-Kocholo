        "text": "Wilhelmina Models, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, recently signed Maren Morris to its celebrity division, and now it is including her “Seeing Blind” cohort, Niall Horan.\n\nOn the heels of his solo album, Flicker, which debuted last month at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, Horan joins other Wilhelmina artists who double as models, including Nicki Minaj, Shawn Mendes, Machine Gun Kelly and Leona Lewis.\n\nThe 24-year-old admittedly never thought about modeling, but says he’s simply taking non-music related opportunities as they come. “I’m into the fashion side of things. I think it’s part of our culture, and what we do, and my job,” Horan told Vanity Fair. “I wouldn’t say I was a model. I’m far from that, but obviously Wilhelmina thinks different. It’s gonna be fun to see what happens. Now that it’s been put in front of me, I’m just really excited about it, to be honest.”\n\nThough the former One Direction bandmember is not experienced in the art of professional modeling, he did namedrop a few familiar icons and actors that he’s admired over the years, namely David Beckham, Ryan Gosling, James Dean and Bruce Springsteen. “Bruce is cool and simple,” Horan said. “Obviously [he] is a lot more ripped than I am. He’s, what, 68 years old or whatever, but he’s holding it together very well. I mean, he looks great.”"
