        "text": "Wilhelmina Cooremans Vasquez, World War II civilian aircraft worker and daughter of Otilia (Cruz) and Johannes “John” Wilhelmus Antonius Cooremans, was born in McAllen, Texas, on November 11, 1926.\n\nJohannes Cooremans was from Holland and at the age of seventeen moved to Mexico in 1903. He married Otilia Cruz in 1911 when she was sixteen years old. Johannes worked for an oil refinery and managed a cattle ranch in Mexico. However, due to the political turmoil that followed the Mexican Revolution, the decline of the Mexican oil industry, and because he was not a Mexican citizen and so could not own land, Johannes and Otilia moved out of Mexico. In July 1926 the Cooremans family relocated their five children to McAllen, Texas. Wilhelmina was born four months later in November. Immigrating to the United States was difficult for the family. Because Johannes Cooremans was a Dutch citizen, he had difficulty migrating legally through Mexico. He moved to Canada to establish residency there before immigrating to the United States. With Johannes in Canada, the family relied on a cousin in Mexico to send them money from the cattle ranch. After the cattle died, however, and with her husband thousands of miles away, Otilia Cooremans decided to move the family to San Antonio in 1928. Johannes immigrated legally into the United States in late 1929. He formally changed his name to John when he was naturalized as a U. S. citizen.\n\nIn 1942 Wilhelmina Cooremans joined the workforce in order to aid in the war effort. She and her older sister, Delfina, dropped out of San Antonio Technical and Vocational High School and took jobs at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. Wilhelmina’s first job there was to inspect airplane components to make sure that cracks had been sealed properly. Next she worked in the fuel-cell department, where she repaired the deicers on airplanes. Wilhelmina and Delfina worked alongside men but felt their disdain for women in the workplace. In 1945 Delfina was recruited by Boeing to work at its plant in Seattle, Washington. Although Wilhelmina’s parents did not initially allow her to go with her sister, they eventually let her move to Seattle too. At Boeing the sisters found better wages and men more accepting of their roles in the war effort. In Seattle they rented a room from a married couple and sent their wages back to their family in San Antonio. When the war ended they were sent back to Texas."
