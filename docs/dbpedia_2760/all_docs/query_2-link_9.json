        "text": "Fancy becoming a collector? The new instalment of my book series: My Grandma's Magic Recipes, is out 2nd March! Spring Bloom, sees Grandma teach Zee all the signs that spring is on its way. My Grandma says, “soon come” when I ask if winter’s done. “Let’s pack away our jumpers and put our t-shirts on.” Don't we all know that impatient feeling! The book also includes two simple springtime recipes you can do as a family. #simonandschuster\n\nSharing with you this Bible verse. Let's reflect on the profound wisdom of nature, echoed in my upcoming book \"Our Furry Friends And What They Teach Us.\" #OurFurryFriends #AnimalWisdom #PetsAndTheirWisdom #AnimalLovers\n\n🎉🥳Start off the new year with a book! After reading \"Alter's Rose\", you will see why it's the best book around that summarizes the word kindness! 🎉🥳🫸🫷I'm celebrating with kindness by giving myself a high five! This brief poem gives insight into the book, \"Alter's Rose\". Explore two more books by the author. \"The Winter Shop\" by K.A. Smith and \"Verses for Sunrise: A Collection of Poems\" by K. A. Smith. 🙂Thank you.\n\nBook crush of the week - ‘Touch’ by David Linden. The other day I held a pint glass under a tap and filled it with water. As I did so I noticed that I had the lightest of holds on it. How does our body judge the pressure needed to hold a glass of water? How does it judge pain and warmth? This book is a deep dive into touch and how it helps us guide our life experiences. A fascinating read. #themindarchitect\n\nI'm looking forward to reading Dan's upcoming book and am certain it will help me to better understand new behavior trends and gain empathy as I (continually) strive to remove my own assumptions. #humancentereddesign #behaviouralscience\n\nHere are a couple of poems for you from Flowers and Fabric, one about beautiful crocuses and one about the mystery of words. Hope you enjoy the reading! 😄 Find out more here: mybook.to/FlowersFabric\n\nI had a chance to read this book by @reesewitherspoon which was good. I love her energy. Make sure to check it out. Have some recipe in it also. #reesewitherspoon #booklover #bookrecommendations #bookworm #bookblogger #cecebookclub #booksuggestions\n\nFUNTIMES BOOK CLUB 📚 Explore the intricate layers of human connection with 'Cuts Both Ways' by Candace Brathwaite. A compelling journey through love, loss, and the profound ties that bind us. We would love to hear your review on this book too!!!"
