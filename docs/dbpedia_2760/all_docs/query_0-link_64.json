In this post my account of the Inlandsbanan experience continues.\n\nMUCH MORE THAN JUST A JOURNEY –\n\nA RAILWAY EXPERIENCE\n\nIn my previous posts about my journey along Inlandsbanan I have been concentrating on the route followed by the trains as they move north. However, Inlandsbanan is much more than a railway journey (though it is certainly among the most scenic of those).

Keen followers of this series will remember that Asarna I opted for Moose burger with jacket wedges. Here is a picture showing the two menus from which this day’s food choices were made…\n\nFor this meal I went for the Meat sandwich, while my choice for the Vaikijaur stop was the Reindeer burger.\n\nWhy have I opted to cover this aspect of the trip at this point? Well, these little critters who I was able to watch while consuming my meal had something to do with that decision…\n\nWith the meal stops being of generous duration I had plenty of opportunities to augment my collection of photos…"
