        "text": "Grew Up… obsessed with fashion. When she was younger, Wilhelmina was a supermodel on the international circuit, making a recognizable name for herself in the business.\n\nLiving… in a swanky apartment in Manhattan. If you’re going to be the best, you have to surround yourself with the best, which is a strategy that Wilhelmina takes to heart.\n\nProfession… creative director at Mode magazine. Now involved in the fashion publishing business, Wilhelmina is trying desperately to become the Editor in Chief of the magazine. Annoyingly, the owner of the publishing company put his son Daniel in charge, a decision that makes Wilhelmina furious. After over 20 years in the business, Wilhelmina turns to underhanded tactics to get her way, with the help of her sassy assistant Marc.\n\nInterests… fine dining and botox. Wilhelmina isn’t as young as she used to be, but she’s determined not to let age ruin her image. Adhering to a strict diet, an exercise plan, and frequent silicon injections, Wilhelmina expends a lot of energy in order to get rid of a few wrinkles and make her life look effortless. It works quite well, especially the first part.\n\nChallenge… getting her way. Since Daniel knows next to nothing about fashion, Wilhelmina thinks it won’t be long before he makes a mistake and she assumes his place on the masthead. However, when Daniel’s new assistant Betty helps him get on his feet in the business, Wilhelmina has to come up with new schemes to try and throw Daniel off track."
