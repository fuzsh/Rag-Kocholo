        "text": "Wilhelmina is a gothic horror story combined with romance, mystery elements, and, of course, vampires. In this reimagination of Bram Stoker’s Dracula, the player experiences the story from Mina’s perspective, who is given a much bigger role and the power to change things this time around - for better or worse.\n\nWilhelmina is a text-based choose your own adventure type of game and focuses on characters and their relationships, thus the story is heavily character-driven. 18+ rating!\n\nThe Story\n\nAs your fiancé is currently away working for a client in far-away Transylvania, you are on your own way to pay your childhood friend Lucy a visit, who requested your help with some urgent matters concerning three young men. Things already seem to be off as you arrive in the picturesque coastal town, but everything starts to get even weirder right after you run into a mysterious stranger, who appears to be quite intrigued by you.\n\nThe Cast\n\nThere are four romance options for Mina in the game. You can romance one of them or none of them.\n\nJonathan Harker (m), Mina’s currently out-of-town fiancé.\n\nLucy Westenra (f), Mina’s childhood best friend, who’s in dire need of her help.\n\nDoctor van Helsing (m/f), polymath doctor, Dutch, and monster hunter.\n\nDracula (m/f/nb), the charismatic and (in)famous vampire.\n\nAdditionally to these four, there will be a set of side characters, including Lucy’s three suitors and Renfield, with whom you will be able to form relationships as well.\n\nSome additions\n\nThis game features a gender-set MC. However, you can still customise her appearance, personality and relationships with the other characters and make her your own character.\n\nThere will be dark themes along with horror and gore. Content warnings can be viewed in-game.\n\nExpect lots of talking and interacting with the characters - this game is heavily character-driven!\n\nSmall and big choices that will alter the progression and outcome of the story.\n\nAs with every adaption, I, too, will divert from the original story in order for it to fit my chosen medium.\n\nDepending on your choices, you might become a vampire yourself.\n\nOld Demo\n\n[New Demo]\n\nTumblr\n\nFeel free to ask questions, give me critique or leave a comment!\n\nNormally I dont like Games where the Gender is locked, but this is Dracula! The idea is awesome and what I have read in the demo is awesome as well!\n\nI love that we can costumize “our” Mina, as I was a little bit disappointed with the role she played in the book and I like how much we can already decide for her. Since Dr. Seward is not mentoined as a RO, can we be friends with him?\n\nI had no bugs in the playthrough, but I was able to choose all three of the hobbies: first I choose crimes and riddles, then the actress and then I was able to choose again between fencing and crimes, riddles."
