MEYER 1874 as \"Trichoglossus Wilhelminae” a k a \"Wilhelmina's Lorikeet\" or (in aviaries) \"Wilhelmina's Lory\"\n\n● … as well as the invalid \"Epimachus Wilhelminae\". A. B. MEYER 1873: \"”Ich nenne diesen neuen Paradiesvogel nach meiner Frau, welche mich auf meinen früheren Reisen nach Celébes und den Philippinen begleitete.” (Synonymous to Black-billed Sicklebill Drepanornis albertisi P. L. SCLATER 1873)\n\n… commemorate an almost totally unknown Wilhelmina (sometimes her name has been written Wilhelmine?) – wife of the German multi-tasking naturalist (zoologist, ornithologist, and herpetologist, as well as linguist and anthropologist, traveler and collector, doctor and professor) Adolf Bernhard (Aron Baruch) Meyer (1840–1911) – whom she accompanied on some of his travels.\n\nAnyone know anything else, whatever small or large, about her?\n\nPS. Not to be confused (which has been done repeatedly) with either the Mountain Mt. Wilhelmina (today Mt. Trikora) on West Papua New Guinea or the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina (Vilhelmina, 1880–1962), after whom the mountain got its name.\n\nIn Prestwich (1963) (I name this parrot): Named after my wife who accompanied me to the Celebes and the Philippines. Also Lamprorhorax wilhelminae is also named after her.\n\nWhat´s a \"Lamprorhorax wilhelminae\"?\n\nPS.According to Sächsische Biografie her name was Wilhelmine! But not even they, with their long list of references, seem to have found anything more about her ...\n\nOk, I think I understand ...\n\n\"Lamprothorax wilhelminae\" A. B. MEYER 1894 a k a \"Wilhelmina’s Bird of Paradise\" or \"Wilhelmina’s Riflebird\" is a presumed hybrid between a Superb Bird of Paradise Lophorina superba PENNANT 1781 and Magnificent Bird of Paradise Cicinnurus magnificus PENNANT 1781!\n\nPS. I looks like her name really was Wilhelmine Meyer, at least according to: Hopffer, C. 1874. Beitrag zur Lepitopteren-Fauna von Celebes. Entomologische Zeitung 35: 17-47. See p.17 (attached). Also consider the \"Aviary name\" (for caged birds) in German: \"Wilhelminenlori\"!\n\nAttachments\n\nHopffer 1874.jpg\n\nLet´s return to the Lorikeet …\n\nIn the type description (attached) of the Lorikeet in 1874 Meyer clearly writes:\n\n\"Da ich mich, bald nachdem ich in diesem Journal, Jahrg. 1873, S. 405, meinem Epimachus Wilhelminae als neue Art von Neu-Guinea publicirt hatte, überzeugte, dass dieselbe identisch sei mit der wenige Monate vorher in der englischen Zeitschrift „Nature“, 1873, p. 305, von Herrn Dr. Sclater beschriebenen Drepanornis Albertisi, so ziehe ich hiermit meine Benennung dieses auch von mir entdeckten neuen Paradiesvogels ein und übertrage den Speciesnamen „Wilhelmina“ auf eine ebenfalls von mir entdeckte neue Trichoglossus-Art, …\"\n\nWith my limited knowledge of German I think I get the essentials of it, but as I would like to quote it (properly) in Swedish, I hope someone kind, with far better understanding of German, feel like translating it?\n\nAnyone feel up to it?\n\nIf so, please, also the short quote, connected to the \"Epimachus Wilhelminae” A. B. MEYER 1873:\n\n\"Ich nenne diesen neuen Paradiesvogel nach meiner Frau, welche mich auf meinen früheren Reisen nach Celébes und den Philippinen begleitete.”\n\n(from its OD, attached, as well).\n\nCheers!\n\nPS. And don´t hesitate to remark on any errors that I might have done transcribing either quote! The more correct we get the better!\n\nAttachments\n\nMeyer, A. B. 1873 - p.405.jpg\n\nMeyer, A. B. 1873 - p.406.jpg\n\nMeyer, A. B. 1874 - p.55.jpg\n\nMeyer, A. B. 1874 - p.56.jpg\n\nMeyer, A. B. 1874 - p.57.jpg\n\nTranslation of the boxed text (as verbatim as I can make it):\n\nFirst box:\n\n\"Since soon after publishing in this journal, year 1873, p 405, my `Epimachus Wilhelminae' as a new species from New Guinea I convinced myself that this [ie the new species] is identical with Drepanornis Albertisi, published only a few months prior in the English journal Nature, 1873, p 305, by Dr Sclater, I hereby recall this my naming of this new bird of paradise, also discovered by me, and transfer the species name `Wilhelmina' to another new species discovered by me of Trichoglossus, of which I supply a preliminary description below.\"\n\nIt seems that he felt scooped by Sclater and seems to argue that while Sclater published earlier, Meyer did find the species independently. One cannot help but feel that adding a `preliminary description' is meant to prevent something similar from happening again.\n\nSecond box:\n\n\"I name this new bird of paradise after my wife, who accompanied me on my earlier journeys to Celebes and the Philippines.\"\n\nAndrea\n\nIt seems that he felt scooped by Sclater and seems to argue that while Sclater published earlier, Meyer did find the species independently.\n\nI think he mainly felt agressed by the \"Berichtigung\" (\"Rectification\") authored by Finsch on the previous page. (See also the footnote on p.55. It seems to me that these two may not have been the best friends in the world...)\n\nThanks Andrea and Laurent!\n\nQuite a story! First Meyer tried to name a pretty Bird of Paradise (that he discovered himself) after his dear Wife, but was forced to yield on that one (due to some petty months and Sclaters \"Albertisi\"), instead having to name a small parrot after his beloved wife. Then when he, once again, twenty years later, tried to name another spectacular Bird of Paradise after his dear darling half, that one turned out to be a hybrid!\n\nIt does look like his wife never was meant to have a Bird of Paradise of \"her own\". She got stuck with a tiny, clumsy, greenish Parrot instead.\n\nThanks for giving me this little Tale!\n\nThat´ll do!\n\nIf no-one doesn´t have anything additional to tell regarding the woman herself … ??\n\n\"Wilhelmina\" (= Wilhelmine) … over and out!\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nPS. No wonder Meyer got a bit peevish (... even if years in advance).\n\nAnd this is what The Eponym Dictionary of Birds claims:\n\nSicklebill sp. Epimachus wilhelminae A. B. Meyer, 1873 NCR [Alt. Blackbilled Sicklebill; JS Drepanornis albertisi]\n\nWilhelmina's Lorikeet Charmosyna wilhelminae A. B. Meyer,1874 [Alt. Pygmy Lorikeet]\n\nWilhelmina Meyer (DNF) was Wilhelmina Meyer (DNF) was the wife of the describer, Adolph Meyer (q.v.).\n\nAt least a try to re-open this old thread as I am not as satisfied as Björn is as long as we don't know her maiden name and life dates. My hope is Paul.\n\nAs she accompanied him 1870 -1873 I ask myself if they may have married in Zürich where Adolf Bernhard Meyer or Aron Baruch Meyer here made his Ph. D. in 1867 („Beiträgen zur Lehre von der electrischen Nervenreizung“)?\n\nMaybe some news in 'Shrieking Savages' and 'Men of Milder Customs': Dr Adolf Bernhard Meyer in New Guinea, 1873?\n\nNameAdolph Bernhard Eduard MeyerBirth6.

Sep 1864 (4 Sep 1864) Sankt Nikolai, Prenzlau, Brandenburg, Prussia\n\nStill looking for her dates\n\nAccording to Sächsische Biografie, published by Institut für Sächsische Geschichte und Volkskunde; here (my bold blue):\n\nMeyer​\n\nAdolf Bernhard​\n\nNaturwissenschaftler,\n\nMuseumsdirektor, Anthropologe,\n\nOrnithologe, Ethnologe\n\n* 11.10.1840 Hamburg\n\n† 05.02.1911 Berlin\n\n⚭ Wilhelmine\n\nAlso see (the even older) thread: Meyer in \"Meyer's Bronze-cuckoo\" Chrysococcyx meyeri … in Italian! (here).\n\nAnd; here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here (with a Portrait/Photo), also here,... and onwards, all over.\n\nAll wrong!?\n\nB\n\nI'd make it \"Wilhelmine Emilie Marie\" rather than \"Emilia Maria\".\n\nShe appears as \"Mrs. Wilhelmine Emilie Marie Meyer\" on p. 230 in: http://www.memory.loc.gov/service/gdc/scd0002/0010/00101300055/00101300055.pdf .\n\nOn this death record, he was born in Hamburg, and he was 70 when he died on 5 Feb 1911, which is compatible with a birth on 11 Oct 1840 as usually accepted.\n\nIn the form itself: \"Adolf Bernhard Meyer, Doktor der Medizin, Geheimer Hofrat, Ehemann der Minne, Geburtsname unbekannt\".\n\n...and in the added block of text (\"Berlin, am 6. Mai 1911\"): \"Die Ehefrau des Verstorbenen heisst vollständig: \"Wilhelmine Emilie Marie geborene Kistner\".\"\n\nAha - they were married in London in Feb 1870 - tricky customers. Perhaps he had to go to England to marry a goyim. Unable to find any birth record for Adolph but no reason to doubt Sächsische Biografie, hrsg. vom Institut für Sächsische Geschichte und Volkskunde. And the record from Laurent indicates that Wilhelmine spent her last years in Bavaria so that with those 2 facts it was easy!
