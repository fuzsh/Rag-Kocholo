        "text": "IG modeling agency\n\nIG modeling agencies are changing the game by offering a fresh take on the industry. It's a space where the traditional rules of modeling, like specific height or body type requirements, don't apply. Here, it's all about how you look and connect with your followers online. If you've got a unique style and a solid follower base, you're in the running. This approach opens the door for a wide range of people to enter the modeling world, people who might not have fit the conventional criteria but who have something special to share through their Instagram profiles. Success as a model on this platform comes down to having an interesting look and the ability to engage and grow your audience. This new model agency concept is all about leveraging what makes you unique and translating that into a compelling online presence.\n\nPUBLIC PROFILE\n\nModeling scouts have to be able to view your profile, so set your personal Instagram account to public view. There is no need to create a separate business account, use the one you already have. Build the subtle feed, go through your account and delete all pictures that are not suitable, just keep the best ones. Be mindful of the content as your potential employer can see it. Make sure you have your contact information in the bio, put your email and living location so that modeling agencies can contact you.\n\nCREATIVE CONTENT\n\nCreate a lot of content (!!!), organize your photoshoots, collaborate with photographers, make-up artists, hairstylists. Follow their accounts, comment on their posts and you'll see, they will connect you at some point. Ask photographers to do BTS (Behind the Scenes) photoshoots of your actual photoshoots, we do it for our customers all the time. You can also collaborate with the designers, fashion startups, or brands that you admire (groove on) and promote their products. Make meaningful posts for your followers, they need to feel you share the same values. Write a story for the pictures you are posting, just be yourself, and be real with your followers.\n\nINSTAGRAM FEED\n\nThere are plenty of ways to create an engaging feed with a cool aesthetic; to choose yours scroll through your existing feed and see what aesthetic your favorite photos have in common. Look at your Instagram feed as a whole, how do all of your photos fit together. Be mindful of the colors if you like to use filters, choose one that matches the best and use it for all pictures. You can use apps, such as VSCO/Facetune, to bring a little more contrast, warmth, brightness to the photos. Try to be original and creative in your own way. To preview your feed beforehand, you can use visual planners, such as Visual Instagram Planner or \"Planoly\". This way, you can move your photos around to create the best vibe and to see what works best for you. You can also schedule your posts beforehand. The key to success is to post a lot of content every day, try to make at least 2-6 posts a day.\n\nINSTAGRAM STORIES and reels\n\nInstagram stories and reels are the best way to engage with your audience, and you can make them as creative and interactive as you want. Show your followers what a model’s life looks like, share your personal experience, and create exciting and unique content. Instagram provides a way to share recorded videos as well as live videos in Stories. According to the statistics, by 2025, 80% of all web traffic will likely be video traffic. So use it for your benefit!\n\nYou can also save your videos to Stories Highlights, which is a great way to keep stories and let people see them whenever they visit your profile. Make a few different categories for stories that you will save, for example - Modeling, Castings, Beauty, and so on.\n\nDIRECT MESSAGES\n\nOne of the alternative options is to direct message the Instagram pages of modeling agencies. Some modeling agencies prefer potential models to direct message them, but others might not have it specified. You can also attach two small size images of you and a quick note when direct messaging a modeling agency. Your note might want to say something like: \"I’ve been hearing wonderful things about your agency and would love to work with you\". Include your age, height, measurements, citizenship, and any agencies currently representing you, if any. Make sure you are contacting the authorized Instagram pages of the modeling agencies you’re interested in. You can also look for personal accounts of scouts/bookers and direct message them as well (we don't include the list here as we respect their privacy)! Don't message all the agencies/scouts at the same time. Do it one by one, wait for the response and then message the next one taking into consideration the comments that you get from the previous one. Don’t be upset if you don’t hear back right away! Be patient, and then pursue other agencies. Success takes hard work, time, and dedication to your craft!"
