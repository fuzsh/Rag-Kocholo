        "text": "Cheyney Barrieau is a veteran of the modeling world. She has worked with many high profile clients including: Brooks Brothers, Talbots, GUESS, Ross Simons, Playtex, Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Brookstone and Casio just to name a few.\n\nIt all started for Cheyney while walking down 5th Avenue in her hometown of Manhattan one day. She was picked off the street by an editor for Seventeen Magazine and was offered her first job at age 13 – and the rest is history! Her long hours in front of the camera blossomed a fascination and love for all things photography. As a working model, she knows the impact and message a photograph can have and thrives to create beauty and intrigue in all her work. Visit Cheyney Barrieau Photography to learn more about her passion and talent of photography.\n\nCheyney now resides in West Hartford, CT with her husband Gib and two kids, Lulu and Max and is represented by Wilhelmina NYC.\n\nHow did you start your career as a model?\n\nIt sort of fell into my lap, actually. An editor from Seventeen Magazine approached me on the street and gave me my first job. I was 13 and had no experience whatsoever, but I was SUPER excited!\n\nWhat do you find most enjoyable and most challenging about modeling?\n\nI cannot lie – I love the catering! It totally makes my day to walk into a studio and see a complete layout of food just waiting for me. The hardest part is having people constantly point out your flaws straight to your face. It has taken a while to develop a thick skin towards it, but there are still times it feels as if I’ve been slapped in the face. And, for the record–yes, I have been brought to tears at a casting by comments made to me by a potential client. But ONLY once.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing modeling experience?\n\nIt was early in my career. I was in rehearsal for a runway show I was booked on when during my ‘walk down the catwalk’ the designer shouted out in front of everyone that he thought my thighs were too fat for his clothes. Every hair on my neck stood up on end and I felt a huge burning sensation come over my entire body. I was humiliated beyond belief. Everyone, including other models, had heard this but, by the grace of God, my face didn’t react and I held my cool. Somehow, I stayed straight-faced even though I was SO close to tears. I didn’t want to let anyone see me crumble–I had to handle it elegantly. I have never forgotten that incident and, unfortunately, never will.\n\nWhen you started out, where you a “natural” or did it take quite a bit of practice? What advice would you give to aspiring models, as they pursue their own careers in the modeling industry?\n\nWhen I started out modeling, I went from zero to sixty in one job. It was a crash course in modeling 101, and I was terrified. I knew nothing and tried not to show my rookie status. I remember faking that I knew what to do, how to walk, how to pose, etc. but I’m sure someone must have seen through it at some point. Modeling always takes practice–You can start a natural, but to evolve. You need to practice no matter who you are. Lots of people approach me and ask me how to break into the business. I tell them to start right at the beginning. Get some pictures and start submitting to agencies. I do warn them about the commitment level they need to have and to also know that there is a huge percentage of rejection. It would be wrong of me as a mentor to mislead aspiring models in saying it’s an easy business and everyone is trustworthy.\n\nWhen you tell others that you are a ‘plus’ model, what is their reaction? How do you define the term ‘plus’ model?\n\nI get bewildered reactions. Most people I tell are not in the industry, and they don’t understand that a size 8 is plus in the fashion world. You should hear what people say when I tell them about that–they are appalled! It’s hard having to explain the plus-size modeling/straight-size modeling issue to people; they don’t always understand.\n\nDo you have an all-time favorite model? Why?\n\nI don’t have an all-time favorite model, but I do have an all-time favorite modeling era–the 90’s. The music video for George Michael’s Freedom was one of the best music videos ever made. Those four gals are icons.\n\nWhat would we find in your handbag? (Since you are a mama, I’m sure you have just about everything in there! lol)\n\nBesides the sea of diapers, sippy cups, and snacks, I always have my phone, wallet, sunglasses, a Pellegrino Limonata, several chapsticks, and my iPad. Whether I need to pull up Sesame Street episodes on iTunes or just mess around on Facebook while waiting at a casting, it’s the most convenient piece of technology ever!\n\nFavorite movie?\n\nToss up between Back to the Future and Weekend at Bernies.\n\nFavorite Books?\n\nFrank McCourt’s books make me laugh out loud.\n\nHow do you like to start your day?\n\nC.O.F.F.E.E.\n\nHow do you define beauty?\n\nBeauty is from within you. It’s not make-up, highlights, or the newest trendiest clothing and shoes. Beauty is honesty, beauty is love, and beauty is caring. Beauty is putting others before yourself, and realizing that good deeds are returned tenfold.\n\nTell us about your beauty routine…\n\nHair ~ I have a TON of hair. It’s daunting. John Frieda’s Sheer Blonde products and Acai Brazilian Blowout Conditioner are a MUST. Frederik Fekkai’s Glossing Cream is always within arm’s reach at all times. My hair gets grumpy when I let it air dry because its wavy, so I blow dry it straight then use a 2′ barrel iron for those Victoria Secret type waves. SO worth the time and effort. I always get asked for lessons!\n\nMake-Up ~ If I’m lucky enough to have a few minutes to put on make up in the morning, concealer, and eye liner are my must haves. I don’t get a lot of sleep with a three month old, so I need all the help I can get to make my eyes look refreshed and cheery!\n\nSkin ~ I always exfoliate–it makes a HUGE difference in your skins appearance (and also how make up sits on it). After that, toner and moisture are my staples–you can never have too much moisturizer in the winter months!\n\nFragrance ~ Issey Miyake. Enough said.\n\nWhat is your go-to outfit?\n\nJeans and a black V-neck Sweater.\n\nLipstick or Lip gloss?\n\nWhen chapstick isn’t dressy enough, I’m a lip gloss gal. MAC lip gloss in Prrr.\n\nYou have been married for 4 years…what do you enjoy most about married life? What is one thing you love about your husband?\n\nMarried life is great. We were married at 22 years old, right out of college. Most people looked at our situation with wide eyes and dropped jaws–they couldn’t understand why we would get married at such a young age. We are both very old school traditional and we really wanted to start a family. My husband is my best friend. We do everything together. We can finish each others sentences, or look at each other and just know what were thinking without saying a word. I love his sense of humor and he can always make me laugh!\n\nWhat do you and your husband enjoy doing together?\n\nWe both have our hands full right now with work and kids, so just sitting with each other on the couch at night to watch our favorite TV shows is a real treat.\n\nYou are a mother of two BEAUTIFUL children. What has motherhood taught you?\n\nWow – being a mom is no simple task. It is 24/7 on duty and making sure everything is the best it can be, given the circumstances. Motherhood has taught me about what is REALLY important in life. Sweating the small stuff is SO overrated–there is a bigger picture that you need to see. It’s not about me anymore – it’s about my kids and what they need.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of being a mother right now?\n\nMy 18-month-old daughter has just learned to hug. It is the most amazing thing to feel her little arms wrap around your thigh and squeeze tight.\n\nOn a day off, what would your perfect day consist of?\n\nNo diaper changing, silence, and an antique store.\n\nWhat are you passionate about?\n\nI love photography and getting that perfect shot that speaks to you.\n\nWhat is a fun fact about you?\n\nMy grandfather, Nunnally Johnson, was an Academy Award nominated screenwriter and producer. He was under contract with 20th Century Fox and launched the careers of Marilyn Monroe, Lauren Bacall, and, Betty Grable among others into super stardom. He has written and produced many films such as, How to Marry a Millionaire, The 3 Faces of Eve, The Dirty Dozen, and The Grapes of Wrath. You can find more at films at imdb.com. He cast my grandmother, Dorris Bowdon Johnson, as Rosa Sharon in The Grapes of Wrath against Henry Fonda. Dorris and Nunnally were Hollywood royalty back in the day. My grandmother would tell me story after story about Marilyn Monroe, Lauren Bacall, and Humphrey Bogart–who she lovingly and comfortably referred to as “Bogey”. My grandparents were a super social couple back in the day. She always had the behind the scenes stories and anecdotes that no one else new.\n\nI loved the story of Marilyn and my grandmother crammed in a bathroom stall at the film premiere of How to Marry a Millionaire desperately trying to get Marilyn out of a dress she had been sewn into because she desperately needed to go to the bathroom. Designers would bid to make gowns and clothes for my grandmother for all her film premiers and gala events. None of those gals had model bodies in today’s standards. They were all size 8-10-12 and they were considered the most beautiful women in the world. Marilyn had a chest the size of Texas and that would never hold up in today’s world of modeling. The girls of the past used their womanly curves to their advantage–and boy did it work for them! Nowadays, plus-size models are compared to Marilyn Monroe and that’s an honor to me!!\n\nNot only are you a model, but you are a photographer as well! What inspired you to get into photography?\n\nI LOVE taking pictures! Modeling has really taught me so much about photography and what it means to take a great picture. I love how people can speak through the lens.\n\nDo you find it hard to balance work and family life? What have you found that is helpful in keeping a balanced life?\n\nWorking while having a family is difficult. There seems like there is never enough time for both. Making sure you have time for yourself and your interests keeps you sane.\n\nWhat are you excited about right now?\n\nRight now, I am excited about the simple things in life: Preschool for my daughter, belly laughs from my 3 1/2 month old son, and a date night for my husband and me!\n\nThank you, Cheyney!\n\nBree Warren grew up in Brisbane, Australia. She is a newcomer on the international modeling scene after spending three years studying Bachelor of Business and Bachelor of Journalism before taking up modeling full-time in late 2010. Bree is currently signed with Wilhelmina NYC, Brigitte Models Germany, Hughes Models London, Dallys Models Brisbane, and BGM in Sydney. She comes from a really sporty family and has grown up playing loads of different sports. After high school at age 18, she traveled the world on a gap year visiting twenty different countries and has even spent time surfing in Canary Islands, Hawaii, and Bali. Bree wants to encourage young women to have confidence in themselves.\n\nPlease tell us how you started your career as a model. Was modeling something that you always wanted to pursue and why?\n\nI was approached when I was shopping in Brisbane and a few days later, I signed with Dallys. At the time, I was at a university and working part-time for a TV station, so it started off as a side project. In July 2010, I decided I wanted to try modeling full-time so I booked a flight to NYC and signed with Wilhelmina. It has all gone on from there.\n\nObviously I knew about modeling, and I have always loved fashion but I wouldn’t say it’s something that I had always wanted to do. I was given a couple of agency cards when I was a teenager but I was really busy with school and sports so I never did anything about it.\n\nWhat does the term ‘plus’ model mean to you? Do you think of term “Plus” as offensive?\n\nModeling (like any industry) has different roles and requirements, ‘plus’ is just one of those. The term doesn’t faze me at all. Models can be plus, straight, editorial, runway, commercial, or catalogue and it’s all part of the job. There’s a really big range in shapes and sizes even for plus models so if anything it keeps the fashion industry interesting. I don’t really think it should be thought of as one vs. the other. Curves or no curves – there is definitely room for both!\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about modeling?\n\nEvery time you work, it’s totally different. I like the travel, variety, and fast pace of it all.\n\nIn terms of your career, where would you love to see yourself in 5 years? Who would you LOVE to work with and why?\n\nI would love to say I’m someone who has everything planned out and organized…but I’m so not. I don’t like to get too far ahead of myself so I’m just taking the opportunities and doing the best I can. Hopefully, I will be working with some big names and travelling to beautiful places.\n\nDo you have any funny modeling stories you would like to share with us?\n\nI once wore a dress made out of chocolate by couture designer Richard De Chazal. It was quite funny because it was a hot day and the bodice kept melting in the sun during the press conference.\n\nIs there one person you have met in this industry that has had a positive impact on your life in a big way?\n\nI don’t think there is any one person but the industry has so many creative and engaging people who have a lot to offer. I almost take something different away from each person I meet.\n\nDo you have a favorite workout routine?\n\nHa ha. I wouldn’t call it a ‘favourite’ but I try to fit in the gym whenever I can. Unfortunately, most of the fun outdoor workouts don’t go so well with the London winter.\n\nWhat has been the piece of advice you have ever been given?\n\nBe confident with who you are, work with what you have, and most of all be a nice person.\n\nHave you ever suffered from body image or self-esteem issues? If so, what advice would you give to young girls and women who are currently struggling?\n\nEveryone has those moments of self-doubt and times you wish you could wave a magic wand but at the end of the day, you need to have faith in yourself. Sometimes life can be a little suffocating so work out what your strengths are and use them. Don’t waste time with the rest.\n\nWhat kinds of pressures do you see the girls in your life facing these days? What can we, as mentors, do to better address these issues?\n\nThis is hard because the pressures really vary from girl to girl. I think the key is to stay positive and levelheaded about everything in your life. Negativity only attracts more negativity.\n\nWho taught you about real beauty?\n\nMy mum. She is so bubbly and always looks amazing despite having one of the most basic beauty regimes I have ever seen. You don’t need all the extras to be beautiful.\n\nWhat do you wish you would have known at the age of 13?\n\nDon’t wish your life away. Enjoy the age you’re at! Oh and look after your teeth.\n\nWere you ever made fun of or teased as a child?\n\nOf course, there is always the odd joke at your expense but nothing major no. To be honest, I managed to steer pretty clear of all that. I have always been taught to rise above it and treat people how you would like to be treated.\n\nWhat is a fun fact about you?\n\nI’ve been mistaken for Nadine Coyle (from Girls Aloud) in London but it doesn’t last long because my accent totally gives it away.\n\nWhat do you love about living in London?\n\nIt is so much fun! There is always so much to do. Sometimes I actually get a bit worried because I don’t want to miss out on anything.\n\nOn a day off, how would your perfect day be spent in London?\n\nBrunch at Borough Markets, shopping at Portobello road, and a night out with all my friends anywhere with a good view.\n\nLipstick or Lip gloss?\n\n‘Melon Mania’ Luminous Lip Veils by Napoleon Perdis\n\nMy beauty essentials are…\n\nBenefit Posie Cheek tint, Dior Show Mascara, and Tigi Rockaholic Dry Shampoo.\n\nWhat is your go-to outfit?\n\nFlowy top, skinny jeans, colourful scarf, and blazer or leather jacket.\n\nWhat are your favorite pair of jeans?\n\nBettina Liano\n\nWhere do you love to shop for clothes?\n\nNew York and London are amazing but sometimes I find the best items in very odd places so my eyes are always peeled. Actually, I’m pretty sure I could find something to buy anywhere. It’s a little bit of a problem!\n\nHow would you describe your style?\n\nIt goes from one extreme to the other. I don’t think your wardrobe should have rules. I am just as happy at charity shops and flea markets as I am in Marc Jacobs. I am generally pretty casual but I dress it up with chunky jewelry or heels.\n\nWhat are your favorite sites to visit online?\n\nIt’s geeky but I visit the news websites all the time. I like to know what’s going on and it keeps me sane. Style wise I would say Fashiongonerogue.com and Style.com are my favourites. Aside from that, I am on You Tube way too much.\n\nWhat are you listening to right now?\n\nPassion Pit, Band of Horses, and I have been playing Rolling in the deep by Adele a ridiculous amount of times lately.\n\nWhat does being healthy mean to you?\n\nFinding the balance between eating well, exercise, and a fun social life.\n\nWhat makes you uniquely beautiful? What do you love about yourself and why?\n\nI am a pretty happy, easy-going person, and nothing really stresses me out.\n\nIn my purse you would find…\n\nA really big mess. I keep bits and pieces of everything. It works well for me but other people might think it’s a bit of a disaster.\n\nWhat is one of your favorite childhood memories?\n\nDefinitely family holidays. My dad has this thing about going to different beaches wherever we are in the world. I have probably been to every single beach on the East Coast of Australia at least once.\n\nWhat are you excited about right now?\n\nWorking in Sydney for a couple of weeks, a holiday in Byron Bay with a big bunch of friends, and finding a new apartment in London!\n\n*Thank you, Bree.\n\nKatya Zharkova is a plus model from Russia. She was born in a small city called Smolensk, and she grew up in Moscow. Katya started modeling at age fourteen, and still models today at almost thirty years old. She graduated from Moscow University of Art and Culture as a TV producer. She created shows on Russian TV. Her friends advised her to go to a casting call for a TV show in Moscow and she got a second job as a TV presenter. She hosted a show where she helped women love themselves. Before coming to the United States, Katya worked with Russian and European designers. She decided to come to Los Angeles, and signed a contract with Wilhelmina agency and moved to New York. She has worked with Forever 21, Silver Jeans, Pure Energy, Cabi, Avenue, Macys, MC Patterns, Ulla Poken, and Fashion To Figure. Now, she is working on an autobiography – it’s a story about a plus-size model traveling all over the world.\n\nPlease tell us how you started your career as a model?\n\nMy mom is a photographer. I wasn’t the prettiest newborn, and my grandmother always use to say that I would turn from an ugly duckling into a swan. My mom use to take pictures of me every day thinking that it would help me become prettier. When I was nine, somebody told my mom you have a very cute boy, she decided I should be acting. So, I got the role of a girl who wasn’t very attractive, and every day she sat down in front of the mirror trying to persuade herself she was the most beautiful and charming person in the world. At the end of the movie, she really blossoms into this beautiful thing. That taught me to do the same thing in real life. Later in life, my friend took me to a modeling agency, and the first thing they told me was that they would accept me only if I lost weight and they gave me six months. I tried but didn’t succeed, and in 1997, they opened a plus-size department in her agency. Since then, some of the designers in my town started sewing a plus-size line especially for me. That made me realize I could be on the covers of major magazines and every boy at school who was teasing me about being fat was wrong! At one of the runway shows, I was seen by the editors of Moscow Fashion Magazine and moved to Moscow to work for them and study at the University.\n\nDid you always dream of modeling and why?\n\nMy dream started in childhood when I believed in myself and thought I was beautiful, but boys were saying I was fat. I was never skinny, and I liked the fact that I was healthy. I wish there were more people like me on the covers of major magazines–healthy and confident! I want young girls to eat properly without starving themselves just because being skinny is in fashion. I want all the runway models to be size 8-16 and not 0-6. I want plus-size modeling to be popular in fashion all over the world along with the skinny models.\n\nWhat do you think people would find most surprising about modeling?\n\nThere are no real rules in modeling; you never know what will happen tomorrow. You can be very talented with a great portfolio and a great body, but there are millions of beautiful and talented people. You have to be very lucky to get the job. It’s the way things happen. Modeling is a very tough job and you have to be at the right time at the right place.\n\nDid modeling come naturally to you?\n\nI think I blossomed thanks to my beautiful photos that say a lot! I want people to realize that you can be beautiful no matter what size you are. It’s very important to love yourself the way you are!\n\nWhat did you study while attending Moscow State University?\n\nAt the University of Art and Culture, I studied acting, filmmaking, and producing. I use to work and study at the same time, but my mom was always strict with me regarding my education. If I wouldn’t get a degree, she wouldn’t let me go to the United States, so it’s thanks to my mom that I successfully graduated with a degree in Organization of Student Festivals, and wrote a thesis called “Education of young people through TV media”. As I was an experienced model by that time, I was able to work as a host of one of the shows and viewers were happy to see a healthy and beautiful woman. I think the fact that I was plus size made me unique and it also helped me believe that one day I will be on the cover of major fashion magazine.\n\nWhen you made the decision to move to NYC, what would you say was the biggest culture shock? Did you know how to speak English?\n\nI moved to NY in a rush. I was already living in Los Angeles and working at Wilhelmina. I was enjoying a slow and relaxing way of life–swimming in the ocean and studying English. On the 29th of September, I got an email form Ameerah (she works at Wilhelmina in NYC), and she told me she really liked me and would love to represent me, but that I would have to move to NYC in order to work with her. We discussed it with my LA agent Tricia, and she told me I should definitely go. I already worked with the big labels like Forever 21, Pure Energy, Silver Jeans, and Cabi, so moving to NYC seemed quite logical and it was kind of the next step in my career. So, I rented a car and drove all the way to New York, thinking I must be crazy but that I was reaching my dream. I had a funny incident on the way to New York. I ran out of gas in Philadelphia, so I left the car and had to walk two miles to the nearest gas station. Right after I walked out of the car, I saw a police officer looking at me with a smile and asking me what has happened and if he could help; that was like a scene from a movie. That was a real shocker! He drove me all the way to the gas station and then back leaving with the words, “Welcome to Philadelphia!” All I said was, “I Love you America!”\n\nWhat do you miss most about your homeland, Russia?\n\nMy entire family lives in Russia, and I really miss them. I miss my mom, my niece, my brothers, and my husband. I have a huge family but thanks to Skype, I can see everybody I miss every single day.\n\nWhat do you love most about living in NYC?\n\nI love the weather in New York; it changes quite fast. Everybody is extremely friendly, and you can say hi to hundreds of people and everybody will react positive.\n\nWhat would you say is the best advice you have been given, in terms of your career as a model?\n\nNever postpone anything for tomorrow! Love yourself the way you are and people will start loving you. Never give up and all you dreams will come true.\n\nWhat has been your most memorable modeling experience and why?\n\nSo far, the most memorable experience for me was the first shoot abroad–the shoot for the Elena Miro’s magazine. It was shot in Egypt. We were shooting the Spring/Summer collection, and I couldn’t speak English at all. It was a week in a sunny Egypt and my first modeling experience outside of Russia–I was crying from happiness. I realized that my dream came true, and I’m on the cover!\n\nDo you feel plus modeling is helping redefine beauty?\n\nI do believe that plus-size modeling has redefined all the usual beauty standards. It’s very important to live in harmony, be yourself, and do what you love the most. You have to be confident and that’s the only reason I’m here in America right now. I don’t want my kids to ever experience what I went through. Every time I go shopping in Moscow, it’s impossible for me to find anything in my size, especially if it’s something trendy and fashionable. Size 8 is usually the biggest size they carry. My husband and I, once tried to purchase jeans in my size and the shop assistant offered me a men’s model. Of course, we laughed and didn’t take it seriously, but can you imagine how many young girls went through the same issue, thinking, “I’m so big that there are no jeans for me”. And that kills your confidence, society and media creates insecurity for people who are bigger than size 8. That’s how young girls become depressed. I’m strong, but even I had issues trying to find myself and it wasn’t easy.\n\nHave you ever suffered from body image issues? If so, what advice would you give to young girls and women who are currently struggling?\n\nWe worry about the way we look because we are trying to find love. We want to be liked. Unfortunately, the reflection in the mirror won’t help you find happiness. If you have a strong personality, and if you can laugh and enjoy yourself, people will accept you the way you are. Also, you might think that skinny and beautiful women are happy, that’s not always true. I know so many examples that contradict that. I know so many beautiful Russian celebrities who are miserable in their life! When I ask my husband how he fell in love with me, being so big and not perfect, he doesn’t even understand what I’m talking about. I’m the most perfect person in the whole world for him and the only thing that he remembers when he first met me was my laugh. I truly love to smile. So my advice is the more you laugh the better.\n\nWhat do you wish you would have known in high school?\n\nMy dream from my childhood finally came true, and I see all the boys from school grow up. I see what kind of girls they like now and they realize I’m not fat at all anymore. I would love to have known that in school. Though, I did believe that being slightly bigger than others would help me in life.\n\nWhere you ever teased or bullied?\n\nI was teased at school; they used to call me a train and I never understood that. Can I be that huge?\n\nWhere would you like to see yourself in 10 years?\n\nWould love to be at the Oscars with one in my hands\n\nWhat is your dream job as a model?\n\nThe cover of US Vogue–impossible sometimes can be possible.\n\nOn a day off, what would your perfect day consist of?\n\nIf I was able to meet up with my friends and enjoy the weekend in a great mood – that means it was a perfect day! Also, I love dancing – it’s always fun!\n\nWhat is a fun fact about you?\n\nI’m far from perfect when it comes to speaking English and because of that, many of the things that I say generate much laughter among my friends, many times unintentional. But I’m very sincere and emotional, so everybody understands me.\n\nIs there something you have always wanted to learn or try, but haven’t yet?\n\nI want to learn skydiving; one day I’ll do it!\n\nWe love your Silver Jeans shots! Please tell us about your experience modeling for Silver Jeans?\n\nI really loved their concept. It’s basically friends on vacation. It was just like my weekends in real life. Talented people around you–jokes, guitar, dancing, and lots of fun. I grew up with my older brother and he always used to invite friends to our parent’s country house; that was a lot of fun. That’s what I experienced again at the Silver jeans shoot. That was a reminder that my dreams were meant to come true, and I was there despite the fact that I’m size 10-12. I was with three beautiful American boys, three skinny models, and me Katya Zharkova, a plus-size model. What else do you need to become happy? Pair of comfortable jeans and real friends close to you.\n\nDo you have a favorite pair of jeans?\n\nMy favorite pair of jeans are waiting for me in LA. I was in such a rush when I was moving to New York that I forgot them at my friend’s place. They are light blue in color and they are vintage in look now. They are completely ripped at the knees; that means they went through a lot and you have to respect that. Hopefully, I will be able to get them back soon.\n\nWhere so you love to shop for clothes?\n\nI like really unique things and my taste is very eclectic. Clothes reflect your mood and also remind you of the favorite moments of your past. That’s why I kept a lot of pieces that remind me of certain things in my life. When I shop, I usually look for something special. Something that my girlfriend would never pick–something that will show my unique style and reflect my personality. Shopping in the US is amazing because there is a great variety of things in my size and that lets you experiment and find the new you. And, that makes it so interesting.\n\nWho is your style icon?\n\nI would say Marilyn Monroe is a style icon because of her Hollywood glamour and a breezy sensuality.\n\nWhat is your go-to outfit?\n\nBlack leather jacket, a pair of dark blue jeans, and of course, a pair of high heels. Russian girls love high heels.\n\nWhat are your must-haves in your make-up bag?\n\nI always have waterproof mascara. You never know what can happen, so you always want your eyelashes to be at their best! Powder, blush, and, the most important thing–pink lipstick.\n\nWhere is your favorite place to snowboard?\n\nI think the mountains of Vancouver are the best place to go snowboarding!\n\nWhat do you love about yourself and why?\n\nI like the fact that I can enjoy life. I can wake up in the morning and say, “Life I love you”. I can walk around the city, enjoying every moment of it\n\nHow do you stay healthy and fit?\n\nEvery morning, I eat oatmeal; I also do yoga twice a week–that’s my secret to beauty.\n\nWhat are you excited about right now?\n\nI’m really excited about going to Seattle, and working for Nordstrom’s. I’ve seen Seattle in so many movies; I would love to see it in real life. And, I’m always looking forward to work!\n\n*Thank you, Katya!\n\nPaulette Osborne is proud to be one of the first mature & plus-size models. She is represented by Wilhelmina. She is the mother of two sons, Kent and Mark, who have both found great success in the entertainment industry, and the grandmother of two children, Maddie and Riley.\n\nPlease tell us when and how you got your start in the modeling world.\n\nI started modeling at 40. There were only two agencies at the time–Plus Models and Big Beauties, Little Women. I was living in New Jersey when I heard someone on talk radio talk about modeling, and the first thought in my head was “models are thin, blond, and young”, but I kept listening anyway. A gentleman called in and said he was 40, and told he should start modeling. Then I thought about all those other areas where models are used. I rushed home (this was before cell phones, lol) and called the radio station. I have never done anything like that in my life.\n\nThe author was still on the air, and I asked him about women who weren’t a size 8, which was the norm at the time. He told me about Pat Swift and Mary Duffy. I went to New York, and Pat said she would add me to her board, but I had to lose weight and get my tooth fixed. After all, you hear about getting into the business, I was skeptical that it was so easy.\n\nSo of course, I had to go to big beauties. The woman who interviewed me was not Mary Duffy, but her assistant. She told me they were running a contest and I could try to enter. She wasn’t very accommodating and I innocently told her that Pat Swift wanted to sign me and she was incredulous. She said that Pat had someone on her board like me and big beauties had tried several models to compete with her to “knock her off her perch” and it never worked.\n\nI left there and RAN back to Plus Models. I guess Pat Swift was smart enough to think if she could get the other model work then she could get me work. Pat told me it would be part time at best, and not to move to New York, but I didn’t listen to her. I moved to New York, never fixed my tooth, and the rest is history.\n\nThat’s how I started.\n\nWhat did you do before you were a model?\n\nI raised two sons in Vermont and when they were school age, I did just about everything there is to do in the restaurant business and ended up as Operations Manager for Bentleys Restaurants. I left Vermont in 1985 and took a 6-month sabbatical in Greece. Then I moved back to New Jersey and I worked in Princeton selling cars. When I first moved to NYC, I was nervous about the modeling industry and sold high-end cars on the Eastside, but I quit after I shot my first commercial for Gitano, Spirit of Family campaign. With that commercial, I got into SAG (Screen Actors Guild) and have been working ever since.\n\nHow has the modeling industry changed over the last 20 years?\n\nWhen I started modeling over twenty years ago, there were only two modeling agencies now there are many more. There weren’t as many designers making plus-size clothing and there certainly wasn’t the respect there is now.\n\nIs there ever a point where someone is considered “too old” to begin modeling or is there a market for all ages?\n\nI think anyone can start modeling. I was over 40. However, there isn’t that much “high fashion”. I do a lot of commercial print and TV commercials. Pharmaceutical companies love me! I had to find all that for myself as my modeling agency did not have the connections for those opportunities.\n\nWhat advice would you give to women who want to start a new career (any career)?\n\nI would tell them it’s never too late, but find something you are passionate about. Also be prepared to work it, no one is going to hand it to you. However, it could be the best thing you have ever done for yourself. If not NOW, when?\n\nHave you ever struggled with self-esteem or body image issues in the past? If so, how did you reach the point of accepting and loving yourself?\n\nWhen I look back at myself at 18, I wasn’t “fat”. I went from being a skinny tomboy to puberty and when I developed breasts and hips, no one told me that was natural and I perceived myself as “fat”. So the dieting began. At 18, I had a doctor giving me speed and some type of shot to help me with weight loss. I yo-yo dieted most of my adult life until I moved to New York and became a plus-size model because with all the dieting, each time I lost weight, I would gain it back and then some. So, when I walked out of Plus Models and they loved me for who I was, I began to feel good about my size. Over the years, I maintained a size 16/18 for about ten years, and then when menopause hit, I became an 18/20 and have maintained that for over ten years. I do yoga, bike, walk, and hike. I am always on the go with my grandchildren and traveling. I eat healthy and try to take care of myself, but no longer am I obsessed with diets. I haven’t dieted for over 20 years, and I get upset seeing all the advertising for the multi-million dollar weight loss business. I had a friend who almost died from gastric bypass.\n\nWhat kinds of pressures do you see the girls and women in your life facing? What can we, as mentors, do to address these issues?\n\nI try to be a role model for my daughter-in-law and granddaughter. I avoid talking about their weight and concentrate on supporting their health. When my granddaughter was six, she called me “fluffy”, which I thought was adorable. She is proud that I am a model.\n\nIf you could go back in time to your twenty, thirty, or forty-year-old self, what advice would you give?\n\nI would say stop spending your time and money on trying to lose weight and enjoy your life.\n\nHow do you define beauty?\n\nThere are so many ways to define beauty. I knew a young woman who was not particularly attractive according to our society standards, but she did not have any self-esteem issues. When I met her parents, I found out that they told her she was beautiful from birth every day and she WAS. Sometimes it’s all perception. In other countries, their ideas of “beauty” are different from ours. I think the most “beautiful” are the people who love life, love people, are passionate about what they do, and are happy with themselves.\n\nHow do you define happiness?\n\nHappiness is waking up every day and starting with a clean slate. Everything is possible!\n\nWhere do you like to shop for clothes?\n\nI like big department stores. I think Catherines, CJ Banks, Fashion Bug, and Lane Bryant all have something for everyone. I just wish the designers would take what they make for straight-sizes and enlarge it. That’s all. I might make some enemies, but don’t add appliqués, sequins, and other ways that they make those same clothes less attractive. Plus-size women want to wear what everyone else wears.\n\nWhat are some of your beauty must haves?\n\nGreat mascara, peppermint foot soak, and healthy food. It starts from the inside out.\n\nPlease tell us about your skin care routine.\n\nOver the years, people ask me what I use for my skin. I would always tell them the skin care I was using at the moment. Now I have come to realize I have good genes. My Mom had beautiful skin and I inherited that. However, I love products from Clinque, Shishedo, MAC, Mary Kay, and my favorite eye cream is Anew clinical eyelift from Avon. It’s a gel for the eyelid and a cream for under the eye.\n\nWhat is the best beauty advice you have ever been given?\n\nMy mother-in-law told me whatever you do to your face do to your neck. I know it’s kind of simple and sounds silly but it’s good advice. So many women spend a lot of time with their skin care and stop near their jaw line.\n\nDo you feel plus modeling is helping to redefine beauty?\n\nI think plus modeling is helping women who are not a size 0 to feel good about themselves. I think the Dove campaign was fabulous. I would have loved to have been a part of that!\n\nIf you could travel anywhere in the world, where would it be and why?\n\nI would love to go back to Santorini and spend a month there. I would rent a villa and invite family and friends to visit. I spent six months in Greece and Santorini and it was magical and mystical. There are some that believe it’s part of the lost Atlantis. The sky and the sea are the bluest blue. Most of the buildings are whitewashed with brightly colored doors or trim, usually blue. Little churches everywhere–some only big enough for two people. They even have an archeological dig that you can visit. I still haven’t been to Paris and that is on my bucket list. ; )\n\nWhat achievement are you most proud of?\n\nI know it sounds corny, but I am most proud of raising two sensitive, healthy, and talented men!! There aren’t enough of those around.\n\nWhat are you excited about right now?\n\nBeing a part of my grandchildren’s lives. Since I raised two sons, Maddie is my first experience with girls and it’s FUN!! I didn’t know what I was missing, but I am happy she’s my granddaughter. I thinking raising a daughter is more difficult. In my experience, boys are easier. I also have a grandson and he is a joy! I love being bi-coastal and spending so much time with them and making new friends. I want to spend more time in Vermont, which is my favorite state. My years spent there were very memorable and I feel like it’s home.\n\n*Thank you, Paulette!\n\nLaura Wells is a plus-size model from Sydney, Australia. She has earned degrees in both Science and Law. She is signed with BGM Models in Australia and Wilhelmina in New York. Her sister, Courtney, is also a model. Laura is currently living in NYC and modeling internationally. She has shared the catwalk with Crystal Renn and many other beautiful women!\n\nWe would love to hear how the both of you got into modeling.\n\nCourtney, who is a straight-size model, went to NYC to go see agents about five years ago. I went with her and got asked by a few scouts if I was a plus-size model. At that stage of my life, I didn’t even know such a model existed and I really had no interest in modeling at all. That was my sisters department and I was busy at a university and traveling at the time. When I got back to Australia, I got in contact with BGM Models had an interview. My agent, Darrianne Donnelly, signed me. My first job came two weeks later and since then, I haven’t looked back.\n\nWhat advice do you have for aspiring models?\n\nI think one of the most important aspects of modeling is finding an agent that understands what you want from the industry and an agent that you can have a great relationship with. Go with your gut instinct as well. If you feel uncomfortable during a shoot, you should speak up and if you feel like you need more direction, you should always ask for it, as it is a great way to learn more about your body and your best shapes and angles. Be true to yourself. Love yourself and your body, and show how proud you are of yourself through your work. A good model exudes confidence in herself and should be able to convey that to her audience whether it be in print or in person.\n\nHave you ever suffered from self-esteem or body image issues? If so, what advice do you have to girls and women who are currently struggling?\n\nWhen I first starting modeling and during high school, I was never really confident with my curves. I also thought of myself as a lot bigger than everyone else, especially my friends. I never really understood that curves were a blessing! Since modeling, I have become a lot more aware of my body shape and finally take pride in the fact that I have a curvy body. I dress to show off my curves and am now no longer afraid to do so. With the increasing awareness of plus sizes and curves in the media, I really think that a positive message is being spread and that anyone that is struggling with body image should take this on board. You have to learn to love yourself and what you have been given in order to lead a healthy life. There are many clothing brands out there now catering towards the plus industry, if you are not sure of how to dress to show off your best features, I think it is a great idea to talk to a stylist and find out what works best for you.\n\nThe Cosmopolitan editorial featuring the both you and your sister Courtney is beautiful. What was it like working together?\n\nIt was fantastic. It was the first time we have ever worked together and we had a blast! The shoot really showcased just how different our body shapes are and the team did a great job with the styling.\n\nWhat effect do you hope this editorial, featuring a straight-size model and a plus-size model, will have on the fashion industry?\n\nThe shoot definitely shows a diversity of beauty between sizes and it would be great if this beauty were reflected more within the industry. Hopefully, this shoot can propel the industry into realizing that diversity is important and that the plus size industry is here to stay and should be included in editorial work more often. The plus size industry and models instill a great amount of reassurance and a sense of connection with the average woman and have the same ability to sell as the straight size industry.\n\nDo you feel it is important to represent women of different sizes? Why?\n\nYes, it is definitely important to represent women of not only different sizes, but different ethnicities as well. By representing everyone, it gives people a sense of acceptance and self-assurance. Fashion is for everyone. Clothing is a part of everyday life and it should therefore include every type of person!\n\nWhat is your go-to outfit?\n\nI usually go for something that hugs my curves, otherwise I can tend to look like a brick. A figure hugging dress, leggings, and boots are at the front of the wardrobe right now as it is winter in Sydney. I also love a good pair of fitted jeans. I love my jeans from Embody Denim. They fit perfectly and look awesome.\n\nWhere do you love to shop?\n\nSince I have been in Europe for most of the year, I have been shopping in Topshop and Zara. We don’t have these shops in Australia and I absolutely love the range they have. The credit card has been hurting but I have bought some great pieces!\n\nFavorite beauty products and must-haves?\n\nTraveling definitely takes its toll on your skin, so I always have a good moisturizer with me. I think I must look like a freak on the plane sometimes because I am constantly re-applying moisturizer to my face every hour. It’s like obsessive-compulsive behavior, but I know if I don’t do it, my skin will break out, and that’s not always the best when you jump straight off a 36-hour flight into a shoot!\n\nI have a big supply of cleanser and a strong eye makeup remover on me at all times. Sometimes eye makeup remover can be a life saver, especially when you finish a shoot with crazy makeup and have to get onto public transport (yes, we models often take public transport, none of this private drivers, haha) A little bit of remover can be the difference between you getting a whole lot of strange looks on the subway!\n\nI also carry a concealer/ highlighter pen with me. They are great for covering those unwanted blemishes and adding a bit of sparkle under the eye!\n\nWhat is the best advice you have ever been given?\n\nEvery piece of advice I get from both my mum and dad has usually been spot on. Even though there has been times and different ages in my life when I didn’t listen, at all, or though that it was completely ridiculous, their advice has always been right in the end!\n\nWhat do you love about yourself? Why?\n\nI love the fact that I am able to adapt to any situation I am thrust into. Modeling in different countries means dealing with language barriers and situations that are completely different than the norm. I have always been able to make the best of any situation and stay positive during the tough times. Being mindful and making an effort to speak in the native language, no matter whether it is a simple ‘hello’ or a full conversation, goes a long way to showing the client and the shoot team that you are an open-minded person and willing to make an effort.\n\nMy way of adapting to new countries and situations includes doing a little research before I get there, not only so I know a little about the country and people but so that I know I will be safe and know exactly where I am going and how I am getting there. Being one-step ahead and always prepared with enough money, a map, and a phone is a good strategy to keeping yourself safe and fitting in with your new surroundings.\n\nWhat does being healthy mean to you?\n\nI believe that being healthy is a mixture of physical and emotional health. Having a balanced diet and exercise routine is a must have. Its fine to treat yourself but over-indulging can get the best of you on most occasions. I try to mix up my diet and exercise so that I don’t get bored or stuck in the same routine. When I go to the gym, I usually do the classes they offer, as I need some form of motivation and the class and the teacher provide that.\n\nEmotional health is such a major part of being healthy. Learning to be happy with yourself and surroundings goes a long way towards leading a positive and stress free life.\n\nWhat are you reading right now?\n\nIt may sound nerdy but I am reading a book called ‘Heaven and Earth, the missing science of Global Warming’. I have a science degree and a law degree and try to keep up to date on current issues in the environmental science field. I am actually really loving this book right now. I tend to read more non-fiction than fiction novels.\n\nWhat are you excited about right now?\n\nI am excited about my move to NYC. I have been signed with Wilhelmina in NY. I can’t wait to hopefully start working for some great American brands.\n\n*Thank you, Laura!\n\nCamilla Hansen is a plus model who is originally from a small village in Southern Denmark. She started modeling at fourteen years old as a straight model. After four years, she changed to plus modeling. She has lived in Istanbul and Milan, and currently lives in New York City. She is represented by Model Management UK in London and Wilhelmina in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. Some of her clients include Marina Rinaldi, Elena Mirò, Jessica London, Macy’s, Fiorella Rubino, Avenue, Ulla Popken, Burda, Persona, and Bloomingdales. Her hobbies include fostering and volunteering for an animal rescue center in New York, photographing, and getting lost in new cities.\n\nHow did you start your career as a model?\n\nI started my career as a model when I was fourteen years old. A few friends had suggested that I should contact an agency, and after a while, I decided to try it out. I sent some pictures to an agency in Copenhagen (the capital in Denmark) but because I feared rejection, I did it without telling anyone at all–not even my family.\n\nThe same day the agency received my pictures (which by the way were just random personal shots); they called me up and told me about a modeling competition that they had going on at that moment and that they wanted me to be a part of. I, of course, was so excited and immediately accepted. After that, everything happened very fast. I told my family about the happy news and a few days later, we went to Copenhagen to attend the casting for the finals. I became one of ten finalists out of thousands of applicants and a few days after the casting, the finale was held. I won.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about modeling?\n\nWhat I enjoy most about modeling is not just one thing. It is the combination of several things. Getting to travel and experiencing new cultures. Getting to unleash my creative side and being inspired by all the creative people around me. Hopefully, inspiring young girls to accept their body as it is. These are just a few of the things that I enjoy about modeling.\n\nHave you ever suffered from self-esteem or body image issues? If so, what advice would you give to young girls and women who are currently struggling?\n\nI have indeed suffered from low self-esteem and body image issues. When I started modeling, I was constantly told by agents and a majority of clients that I was too fat and that I had to lose weight. Even though my parents have always had my back and have supported me throughout my career, you will reach a point where it is just too difficult to ignore the comments being made about your body and unfortunately, I started believing what they said was true.\n\nAll of a sudden when I looked in the mirror, I no longer saw that slim girl that I previously had seen. Instead, I started seeing all the problems that everyone, except my family, kept bringing to my attention.\n\nWhen I started modeling, I decided that I would only do it for as long as I found it enjoyable. After four years, I had had enough. Enough of the comments. Enough of the insane diets. Enough of not feeling confident. So, when Wilhelmina wanted to sign me to their plus-size board, I jumped right on. It was my way out. I started eating regularly and healthy, and I stopped weighing myself every day. All of this slowly made me feel happier, both about my body and my life. Rome wasn’t built in a day though, and being confident about your body doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a process, but once you reach that state of mind it is indescribable.\n\nTherefore, my advice to any girl/woman is to be YOU. Find your natural size where your body plateaus whether that is a size 0, 12, 22, apple shape, pear shape, hourglass, or whatever and rock that. The most beautiful, attractive, and intriguing women that I have met in my life so far, may not necessarily have met the fashion industry’s criteria on what beauty is but they were comfortable in their own skin and for that I admire them.\n\nDo you feel plus modeling is helping redefine beauty?\n\nI definitely feel plus modeling is helping redefine beauty, but as is acting, etc. Nowadays, it has become more common to see women of all shapes and sizes on the cover of and in various magazines, as well as in TV series. The fashion industry has (hopefully!) realized that consumers need and want to see someone they can relate to.\n\nWhat does being healthy mean to you?\n\nHealthy, to me, is eating healthy and regularly. Healthy, to me, is a state of mind. Healthy, to me, is taking care of your body.\n\nWhat do you wish you would have known at age thirteen?\n\nHere is the thing. I try as much as possible to live a life with no regrets. I am happy with who I have become so why regret any of the things, both the good and the bad, that have been part of that process? When I was thirteen, I was still a child and I learn by doing, so I don’t wish I knew anymore than I did because then I very likely wouldn’t have gone down the path I have.\n\nWhat feature do you love to accentuate?\n\nIt depends what mood I am in. Sometimes, it is my legs and other times it is my waist or my bust. It depends.\n\nPhotography is…\n\nA way of expressing my creativity. I am not a great writer, painter, or dancer, but I still have such an incredible amount of ideas and visions in my head that I need to get them out somehow. That’s what photography does for me.\n\nWe know you love heels! Do you have a favorite pair?\n\nHa ha, I do indeed! My dad’s nickname for me is Imelda Marcos. I feel that heels can make or break an outfit, especially as I hardly ever wear jewelry. This is also, why I don’t have a favorite pair of shoes. I love all of them, as they are all good for different occasions and outfits.\n\nI recently read an article about three shoe lovers, and one of them gave a quote that I absolutely adore and can relate to. She said, “What I like about shoes is that anybody can wear them. There is no size-zero debate about shoes.”\n\nWhat is your go-to outfit?\n\nI actually don’t have a specific go-to outfit. In the Fall/Winter, I wear a lot of black and there is a certain model of black Dr. Denim jeans I wear quite often. I actually have own three pair of the same model because I wear them so often and love them a ton. During Spring/Summer, I try to switch it up a bit by wearing cute and colorful dresses that accentuate my curves.\n\nWho is your style icon?\n\nI don’t have any style icons. I believe in wearing what is comfortable yet flattering to my body shape. Once again, it is all about being YOU instead of trying to imitate other people.\n\nRosie\n\nHave you always been a dog lover? Do you have any dogs now?\n\nI have always been an animal lover, not just a dog lover. I had rabbits when I was still living at home and I rode horses for a very long time, which by the way, to this day is the best sport I have ever partaken in.\n\nThough I always took care of a lot of dogs, I never had my own dog and I don’t plan on getting one in the near future as it is a huge responsibility, and I am not at the stage in my life where I am able to make a ten to twenty year commitment. When the time is right, I will (without a doubt) get my own dog, but that is just not now.\n\nInstead, I decided a while back to start fostering for a dog rescue (Posh Pets Rescue) here in New York. That has been a great decision. Basically, what we do is to take the dogs off the euthanizing list, out of the shelters and place them in private homes until they are adopted. In periods when I am not working, I will usually have one or two dogs at my apartment.\n\nIt keeps amazing me how people can give up these dogs, as most of them are perfectly healthy and well-behaved dogs that have just been dumped on the street, as if they were a useless bag of garbage.\n\nWhen I got my first foster dog, Rosie, a beautiful, well-behaved, housebroken, and kindhearted Bichon Fris, I was heartbroken. How could anyone just leave this little gem to fend for herself on the street? I was close to losing faith in humanity, but then something amazing happened. Rosie was put up on our website (www.poshpetsrescue.org), on petfinder.com, and on several other sites and the applications just started rolling in.\n\nAs they say, one man’s trash is another man’s treasure and after going through a lot of applications and interviews little Rosie was adopted by an incredibly sweet woman who already had another Bichon. All of these applications made me realize that even though there will always be the occasional cold-hearted person there are at least twenty good ones!\n\nWho is your role model or hero? Why?\n\nMy parents and grandparents. For the love and unlimited support they have always given me, my younger brother, and each other. I strive to be like them.\n\nYour family is a big part of your life. What is one of your favorite childhood memories?\n\nOne incident that sticks out, and that I think of often and was a long time ago, is when my brother and I played dress up. Even though he was a boy playing with cars, super heroes, etc., he let me put him in a dress, put makeup on him, and place a big bow in his hair. Only someone who truly loves you will let you do something like that to them.\n\nOut of all of the places your modeling career has taken you, where has been the most memorable and why?\n\nEvery single place I’ve traveled to has made an impact on me as a person. In Texas, I had a Mexican driver who was also a trained chef. He taught me some incredible Mexican recipes. When I lived in Istanbul, a friend and I were almost shot by the mafia. When I went to Colombia for a job, we stayed and shot at a highly guarded mansion and the mother of the house showed me a few traditional Colombian dishes; one of which you have to use at least five different kinds of potatoes. I could go on like this, but my point is, as I said in the beginning, that every place has made an impact on me and who I am as a person today. I believe that it makes us better people to experience and accept the differences in the different cultures all over the world.\n\nWhere do you shop for clothes?\n\nAnywhere I find anything flattering really; sometimes that is at very cheap stores and other times at more pricey stores.\n\nWhat is the best advice you have ever been given?\n\nWhen my grandmother, with whom I was very close, was alive, she used to always tell me: “Smile at the world and the world will smile back at you”.\n\nThough she went through some very hard times in her life, she was one of the most genuinely positive people who I have ever met. Because that was one of the things about her I admired the most, I try to live by it even though I do fail sometimes.\n\nWhat do you love about yourself and why?\n\nI don’t just love one part; I love me as a whole. I have finally completely accepted my body as it is and I am happy with whom I am as a person.\n\nWhat are your favorite beauty products or must-haves?\n\nMy very favorite beauty product is a makeup remover from Bioderma. Every time I work, I wear a lot of makeup and it can be very hard on the skin if the makeup remover you use is not good.\n\nDo you have a beauty tip to share with us?\n\nBeing in a business where appearance matters a lot, I attempt to take very good care of my skin. I cleanse my skin every night (no exception) with a milky cream cleanser, then with an alcohol-free skin tonic, and I finish off my routine by applying eye cream and a good lotion. In the morning, I re-apply the lotion which contains SPF 30. That is my best beauty tip–take good care of your skin, even if it may seem like a hassle because it will benefit you in the long run.\n\nLipstick or Lipgloss?\n\nI naturally have very red lips and therefore don’t wear anything on my lips in my everyday life. Bit, I love to pump it up every now and then with a deep red lipstick (Chanel Rouge Allure – 09 – Lover) if I go out for dinner, an event, or something like that.\n\nOn a day off, what would your perfect day be like?\n\nA perfect day off for me would be spent with my family. Especially after I have moved to New York and they are all in Denmark, it has made me realize just how much we should all treasure the time we have together because you never know when that time might be up.\n\nWhat is a fun fact about you?\n\nA fun fact about me is that I never liked wearing dresses when I was younger. I always preferred being outside climbing trees and getting dirty.\n\nWhat are you excited about right now?\n\nRight at this moment, I am excited about several things. OneStopPlus.com gave New York fashion week its very first plus-size fashion show, and I got to be a part of it, which is something I am very proud of. Elena Miro once again put on an amazingly beautiful and well-done show during Milan fashion week. Last but not least, I am over the moon that I once again got to work with the talented people at Vogue, which resulted in a short-film that should be coming out very soon.\n\n*Thank you, Camilla!\n\n**You can watch Camilla’s video and find out more about her at http://www.vogue.it/en/vogue-curvy/how-to/2010/03/camilla-hansen.\n\nCosmopolitan Magazine\n\nRobyn Lawley is a plus model from Sydney, Australia. She is signed with Bella Model Management in Australia, Model Management in the UK, Okay models in Germany, and Wilhelmina in NYC, USA. Some of her clients are David Jones, Nordstrom, Cosmopolitan magazine, Madison Magazine, Kohl’s, New Look, Spirito, Ezibuy, and more. Robyn enjoys films, music, making music, watercolor painting, cooking, eating, rock climbing, and traveling.\n\nRobyn wrote, “I’m a model beyond a size 10 and I love my job. I get to travel the world, and at the same time promote healthy shapes and let audiences know that it’s okay to be who you are. Embrace your body for what it is, exercise, eat as healthy as you can, and have fun. There is so much more to life than fitting into size 6 jeans, and I’m glad I realized this sooner than later.”\n\nPhotographed by Kane Skeener for Cosmopolitan Magazine\n\nHow did you begin your modeling career?\n\nShe started modeling at the age of sixteen, when I won a modeling magazine competition, but I didn’t model for long, as I struggled to keep my weight down. Two years later after seeing success in Abby Valdes and Crystal Renn, I signed with Chelsea from Bella Model Management.\n\nWhat advice would you give to young women who are struggling with self-esteem, confidence, or body image issues?\n\nI think all women and men, for that matter, go through this most days. Try to focus on something else; sometimes we get so self involved that we miss out on everything passing us by. Take up a sport you enjoy or a hobby you would like to start. Confidence can come from achieving even the smallest of things.\n\nTry not to compare your body to that of celebrities or top models because what you see is not always true (especially with Photoshop ruling the planet). Work with the body type that you have and just enjoy that you can see, that you can hear, and that you can walk. Both my mother and my older sister have worked, and still are working, with disabled people and it really can make you think that spending so much time pinpointing your flaws is hiding what you are really about.\n\nPhotographed by Simon Upton for Madison Magazine\n\nWhat kinds of pressures do you see the girls in your life facing? What can we, as mentors, do to address these issues?\n\nI think the most troubling thing is the amount of concern that we have over beauty. We no longer even care if someone has a good soul; we care more if they have lost the most weight or are taking up a certain exercise. I hate when I start researching what a celebrity does; it gets so time consuming. Later, I think my god I could have been practicing guitar or rock climbing. I just wish the beauty/entertainment industry didn’t have such a hold over our self-esteem. I do remember, though, when I was fourteen, I had no idea what cellulite was until I saw a magazine in a grocery store harpooning females with it on their cover. I remember going home straight away to inspect my thighs. From then on, I always wore board shots; even in competitive swimming. Did I have cellulite? No, I didn’t, but that magazine made me feel ashamed of my body. I will always blame them for making women, especially teenage girls, feel ashamed of their bodies. We should be empowering women and pushing them further in their lives, not making them inspect their thighs.\n\nHaving just recently moved to NYC, what has your experience been like so far?\n\nIt’s tricky to say; I both love and hate NYC. It’s just so different from Australia. It can be a shock to the system. I feel like I’m riding a rollercoaster—from crazy parties to crazy people chasing you to awesome shopping. It’s definitely one of a kind.\n\nWhere do you like to shop for clothes?\n\nLONDON!!! It’s the best place to shop in the world. I love Camden markets and Topshop UK. I am finding Williamsburg, Brooklyn (where I live) has awesome vintage.\n\nPhotographed by Georges Antoni\n\nDo you have a favorite workout routine?\n\nI love playing sports. One thing I miss is team sports. I can’t do any because my routine is so out of whack with modeling. I love rock climbing though because it doesn’t feel like exercise; it just feels like a fun challenge and boy it’s challenging. I try to hit the gym about four times a week. I really miss my personal trainers in Sydney, Australia. In NYC, they are so expensive that it’s not worth it. If you find you are a person who lacks the motivation or knowledge, investing in a trainer, even just for a month, is well worth it. Even just to learn the safe way of working out at a gym and what types of exercises are good for your body type.\n\nWhat are your favorite beauty products or must-haves?\n\nI love Benefits new High Beam face illuminating cream that you put on your cheekbones for the healthy glow, Lancôme’s New Définicils Precious Cells Mascara, and of course, good old trusted Paw Paw ointment for my lips.\n\nDo you have a beauty secret or tip you would like to share with us?\n\nMake sure you wash your face twice a day; tone and then moisturize. Sounds dreary, but once it becomes habit it’s second nature.\n\nPhotographed by Kane Skenner for Cosmopolitan Magazine\n\nWhat are you listening to right now?\n\nEVERYTHING–I LOVE MUSIC! The top five albums I listen to all the time are the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack, The Boat That Rocked soundtrack, Juno soundtrack, the best of Janis Joplin, and La Roux’s first album. But, I like anything from Bloody Beetroots, to Jimi Hendrix, to Rolling Stones. Going to festivals is one of my favorite things to do.\n\nFavorite movie?\n\nGah, that’s like favorite song–too hard to pick. I’m a movieaholic. My favourite thing is watching a good movie. They can make me feel comforted– especially movies from my childhood. When I’m homesick, I watch all my old favorites. As a young girl, my dad and mum would drive me and my sisters about an hour to watch movies at the Royal Australian Air Force Base because my dad was in the air force, and tickets were $2 each and we would all get a killer python each. Simple pleasures in life tend to be the best. 🙂\n\nOn a day off, what would your perfect day be like?\n\nWaking up to my cute boyfriend back home, then getting sushi with my best girlfriends, later catch a movie with them and my man, and then going dancing at a club with awesome music with my awesome sisters.\n\nWhat do you love most about modeling?\n\nI love the confidence it gave me. I do admit I was struggling to accept my weight. I just couldn’t get over the fact that I was once an Australian size 6-8 (USA size 4-6). When I joined Bella, my confidence was pretty low, and I doubted that Chelsea, my agent, would sign me. I was lucky she gave me a contract on the spot and about a year later, my confidence was the strongest it had ever been, I felt unstoppable and still do. 🙂\n\nWhat do you do to prepare for a photo shoot and what are your must haves in your modeling bag?\n\nI wash my hair the night before and put a heat protector on my ends. The morning of, I wash and cleanse my face. I then use a good quality moisturizer and Paw Paw on my lips. I always take my own mascara because I have very sensitive eyes, and I don’t want to obtain any eye conditions.\n\nDo you have any funny modeling stories you would like to share?\n\nI think most people find modelling very glamorous, but trust me it can be anything but that. I hate when I have to walk around or get something with my hair is in curlers and I look like an old grannie.\n\nI had a funny week though recently, when I was in Fiji for a Cosmopolitan shoot. I decided to go horse riding on my day off. The horse they had was tiny, but I didn’t get to see it until I had paid. I felt sorrier for the horse because it would have to lug me around, but I didn’t want to seem like a chicken so I went riding anyways. Once I had finished my thighs were so sore– more than usual. When I reached the hotel, my inner thighs were blue and bruised so bad that when I showed the stylist, she gasped… LOL–not good for a swimwear shoot.\n\nPhotographed by Georges Antoni\n\nWe would LOVE to hear about your experience walking in the OneStopPlus.com Fashion Show!\n\nYeah that was so great, I knew it would be a bid deal, especially when I arrived to see where it was. I was so lucky, I only got the job last minute as I did not go to the casting, they spotted me at a go see and decided to use me. It was very empowering experience and I hope they do more.\n\nWhat is a fun fact about you?\n\nI like to do voices. I can do Gollum from lord of the rings, exorcist chick (pretty scarily well, so much so that I shocked a boy that I was dating once; he got so scared that he threatened to punch me if I ever did it again, and naturally I do it to him every time I see him. ha-ha), Stitch from Lilo and Stitch, and E.T.\n\nWhat do you love about yourself and why?\n\nI suppose I love that I rarely say no to anything; consider me the yes woman. I have always been like that ever since I was a little girl. I would give anything a chance. I’m not sure why, but I just never wanted to miss out on something I might have found fun, whether it be sky diving, jet skiing, rock climbing, canyoning, or travelling; anything really deserves a chance.\n\nWhat is one last thing you would like to say?\n\nDon’t be afraid to make a fool of yourself and have fun. My mother always said laughter is the best medicine and by god, she’s right! 🙂\n\n*Robyn talks about acceptance. This is a great video!\n\n**You can learn more about Robyn at her blog: http://reviewmerobyn.blogspot.com/\n\n***Thank you, Robyn!\n\nPhotographed by Roberto Ligresti\n\nBecca Thorpe is a plus model from Annapolis, Maryland who currently lives in New York City. She has been successfully modeling for ten years. She spends her free time behind the lens as a photographer. She has recently shot a fashion spread for Madisonplus, a news and fashion blog (http://madisonplus.com/).\n\nHow and when did you get started in the plus modeling industry?\n\nI started modeling while attending college in Philadelphia. I was going to a party at a hotel where there happened to be a plus modeling contest going on. A woman approached me and asked if I ever considered modeling, and I immediately said no; I play sports and there is obviously no need for someone who is 5’11” and “big” in that industry. Boy, was I wrong. The next week I was working locally and began to think that this could be something if I was smart about it. A year later, I had moved to New York and have been working ever since. Wow, ten years really flies by!\n\nWhat have you learned from the modeling industry?\n\nI have learned so much in this industry. There are so many things I want to say here. Modeling is what I do, not who I am. Business is business and sometimes it has nothing to do with you. More than anything else, modeling has made me grow into a really capable woman who can achieve anything.\n\nHave you ever struggled with low self-esteem or body image issues in the past? If so, how did you reach a point of accepting and loving your body?\n\nHave I ever struggled with body image or self-esteem? HELLO! I am going to be real honest here…I am a woman! Who doesn’t? Let’s be real, we live in a world where it is bombarded on us every day to look a certain way–to be “this” in order for a man to love you and to comply with what others “think” we should be. Yes, even models succumb to this struggle. I have been a size 12/14 since I was twelve years old. There were no Forever 21’s when I was growing up, and I knew (at that young age) that I would never be a size 8. Heck, a size 10 is even pushing it! I am real about my body. I go through phases like everyone else I know. Just look at my closet; it ranges from a size 12 to a 16! That is real life. I do indeed love my body, I love my man for loving my body, and I love that I am in an industry that allows me to be vocal about being honest about it all!\n\nHow would you define confidence?\n\nConfidence is knowing who you are.\n\nHow do you define beauty?\n\nBeauty is being able to say no when you need to. It is saying thank you. It’s being “interested” when you just want to be “interesting”…it’s really listening. It’s a great blazer, red lipstick, and killer high heels. Beauty is accepting where you are right now and still moving forward.\n\nPhotographed by Roberto Ligresti\n\nWhat do you love about yourself?\n\nWhat do I love about myself? I love the strength that the women in my family passed down to me. I love that I am tall (I wish I could go back to my thirteen-year-old self and say that). I love that I have really amazing friends who encourage me to be ‘me’ . I love that I have a sense of humor about the little stuff in life, and I absolutely LOVE that even when I am ninety, I will be asking questions like “would you rather”!\n\nWhat are you passionate about?\n\nI am passionate about capturing moments with people, whether it’s with my camera or a conversation that brings meaning or laughter. No matter what we do, in a job or even with our spare time, we have an ability to touch others with what we say and do.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing in your down time?\n\nIn my spare time you will find me walking in NYC with a camera in my hand. I talk to homeless people, street vendors, strangers, musicians, and even my friends in order to get a real moment snapshot of their lives. Yes, I love taking pictures, but I also love my dog, road trips, my family, and my closest friends here in the city.\n\nWhere do you shop for clothes and who are some of your favorite designers?\n\nI shop everywhere, but those who know me well would say that I am the quintessential “Gap” girl. JCrew is another favorite, but my true finds come from scouring Century 21 and vintage shops.\n\nPhotographed by Lisa Holgrave\n\nFavorite jeans?\n\nGAP…long and lean jeans! They are the staple of my wardrobe.\n\nWhat are some of your beauty must-haves?\n\nWhen it comes to products, the things I cannot live without are Kate Somerville ‘Quench’ for my face (http://www.katesomerville.com/), Kevyn Aucoin’s mascara (http://www.kevynaucoin.com/), Yves Saint Laurent’s Touché Éclat for under eye circles, and lip balm. All of these products are in every bag I own.\n\nPhotographed by Jeff Licata\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about your career as a model?\n\nIt is not the places I have been, it is the people who I have been with on locations that have been the most memorable. The friends I have made on jobs in Germany, Canada, Thailand, and Argentina. The places have been incredible, but the late nights of talking, sharing, and laughing will be what I really remember.\n\nWhat advice would you give to aspiring plus models?\n\nThe advice I would give to girls just starting in this industry is…1) trust yourself 2) be willing to learn, learn, learn…and know that it is not all fun and games — it is a business in which you have to invest a lot of yourself mentally and emotionally. Oh, I know… I can hear the “you just have to stand in front of a camera…how hard is that?” But let me tell you…it is a learned art — one that comes with time and patience. So know your strengths and weaknesses, and be willing to learn and have fun!\n\nPhotographed by Lisa Holgrave\n\n‘Curves For Change’ has brought many of your fellow Wilhelmina models together for a great cause. What has that experience been like for you so far?\n\nWorking with C4C has been one the best experiences I have had. It is truly amazing what women can do together! It is remarkable to know that we are promoting a healthy and honest look at the issues at hand. I have met girls that truly inspire me!\n\n*Curves for Change recently launched their website. To find out more about C4C, please visit http://www.curvesforchange.com/index.html.\n\nPhotographed by Max Abadian\n\nWhat do you wish you would have known at age thirteen?\n\nOh the dreaded age of thirteen when you just want to be like everyone else. If I could pass a note to myself in class at that age, knowing what I know now, it would read, “What you think is important now will change. It always does. There is freedom in being different and in going against the grain, so stand up straight and stand tall in that back row full of boys! It’s okay NOT to have the same outfit as everyone in your class! You are so special my thirteen-year-old self. You have to know that confidence is in your hands, not anyone else’s.”\n\nWhat kinds of pressures do you see girls and women facing today? What can we, as mentors, do to better address these issues?\n\nThere are so, so, so many pressures are on young women today. It has gotten to a point where it’s almost unbearable! I know a lot of models talk about it. To be honest, we struggle with it too! Those pressures are real and sometimes an everyday occurrence. Instead of just talking about it all the time and judging other woman (because admit it, sometimes women can be cruel) we need to start reading things like Plus- Size Models Unite and even the things that Curves for Change is doing. To see models, instead of competing and being hurt or jealous, come together and send a positive image out to women is what this is all about! Yes, we all want to feel good, look beautiful, get the job, and get the guy; but how we get those things is really the important part! Pressures are in every part of life whether you are thirteen or a grown woman. We have the choice of how we look at things so I say to someone struggling with body image or external pressures “It’s there (the pressure). Accept that magazines and other people create a so-called “standard”, but YOU can create your own. Be kind to that voice inside you that compares and judges, and then go throw on a pair of heels and do your own thing.”\n\nWhat are you excited about right now?\n\nWhat I am excited about now is my newfound love of photography. Testing other models, putting stories together, and even the editing. I feel like I have something to say with a camera in my hand. Normal moments can be captured and made into something bigger. The beginnings of a new passion are often very scary. Should I? Am I any good? Those little voices are slowly dissipating, and I am finding myself truly loving this new adventure of being the girl behind the lens.\n\n*Thank you, Becca!\n\n**How do you define beauty? How do you define confidence? What are you passionate about?\n\nDanielle van Grondelle is a plus-size model who grew up in Rotterdam, Netherland. Danielle’s mother agency is Ego’s Models in Amsterdam. Brigitte Models, Munich, Model Management UK in London, and 12 plus UK in London also represent her. She still lives in Rotterdam close to all of her friends and family. Danielle loves her job, and whenever she has time off, she spends it with the people she loves.\n\nHow did you start your career as a plus model?\n\nI was scouted on the street in Amsterdam when I was fourteen years old. Ever since I was fifteen years old, I tried to be a straight-size model, but I was never skinny enough. Even when I was really small, my hips where always too wide. So, I tried every diet there was, but I couldn’t get down to the size they needed me to be. Whenever I booked a job, I was always afraid that I wasn’t going to fit into the sample clothes. After a couple of years, they decided to put me on the “special” board, and I had an odd job here and there. Then I did a job for a magazine with stylist Edith Dohmen. She told me that I would be perfect as a plus-size model. I had no idea what a plus-size model was, so at first I didn’t do anything about it. After finishing school, I had a dream to contact a plus-size agency. After I did, I had a meeting with Ego’s Models and was signed right away. After six months, I quit my designing job to model full-time. That was five years ago, and I absolutely love my job!\n\nWho are some of the clients you have worked with?\n\nI’ve worked with so many wonderful clients. Here are some examples: Avantgarde magazine, BY s’oliver, Evans, Ulla Popken, Marina Rinaldi, Chic magazine, Grazia magazine, Veto jeans, Freundin magazine, Burda magazine, Neckermann, Otto, Happysize, and many more.\n\nWhat do you love most about modeling?\n\nI love being creative and making a beautiful product in the end. I love traveling and meeting new creative people every day. What I love the most is that I can show the world that plus-size modeling is beautiful, and that I can be a role model for young girls.\n\nDo you think that plus modeling is helping redefine beauty?\n\nI think it is! A woman’s body is lovely in its natural form. If you are naturally curvy, then that’s gorgeous. If you are naturally skinny, then that is also beautiful. The thing I don’t like is when woman are trying to be something they are not. Starving yourself is never beautiful; you can see the lack of nutrition in a woman’s hair and skin. I think that with plus-size modeling, we show the world that curvy is gorgeous and that you don’t have to be skinny to be beautiful.\n\nHave you ever struggled with self-esteem?\n\nNo, I have never had a low self-esteem. I think that’s because of my upbringing. My parents always let me know I was beautiful inside and out. I was always very confident in my own skin, whatever size I was.\n\nWhat advice would you give to girls and women who are struggling with body image and self-esteem issues?\n\nEvery body is beautiful; don’t be your own worst critic. Try to focus on the positives, and surround yourself with positive people. And, the most important thing is to love yourself.\n\nWhere do you shop for clothes and who are some of your favorite designers?\n\nI am a true clothing junkie. I think a woman can never have too many clothes, shoes, and bags. I love to have expensive key items, like a nice bag, belt or shoes. I love Marc Jacobs, Chloe, Chanel, Betsey Johnson, and D&G; but I love to mix those pieces with vintage. I love belted vintage dresses! I shop a lot at H&M, Topshop, ASOS, and River Island. I love how they translate the looks from the catwalks to the streets. I also love wearing statement jewelry; I make a lot of my earrings myself.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite beauty products or must-haves?\n\nI love Clinique 3-Step Skin Care program, and I love Estee Lauder’s Advanced Night Repair and DayWear. Whenever I work a lot, my eyes get sensitive. I found a very good eye makeup remover that’s so soft: Chanel Precision Demaquillant Yeux Intense. I am addicted to lip gloss and lip balm, I love Labello Fruity Shine, and I love Guerlain Terracotta lip gloss.\n\nWhat does being healthy mean to you?\n\nI am not a big health freak, but I like to be comfortable in my own skin. I drink a lot of water, and I don’t smoke or drink alcohol. I have periods where I am very healthy…so during those times I eat a lot of fruit, vegetables, and steamed fish or lean meat. But, I also have periods were I like to eat whatever I want, and I can now because I need to stay curvy. I think it’s about the balance between the two. Be healthy, but being happy is even more important.\n\nHow do you define beauty?\n\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, so I love that beauty is so many different things to different people. I think if you are beautiful on the inside, it shows on the outside.\n\nDo you have a favorite workout routine?\n\nI used to be a synchronized swimmer, so I love to swim. I love to shop, so walking around from shop to shop is one of my favorite workouts. Also, I have an exercise machine I use in front of the TV.\n\nWhat do you love about yourself?\n\nI love that I am very loyal to my friends and family. I am always there whenever the people I love need me.\n\nWhat are you excited about right now?\n\nMy long time goal is to live my life with all the people I love around me! I want to stay healthy and be a positive role model. I am looking to buy my very first home now, so it’s a very exciting time.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned is…\n\nThe sky is the limit…That is my mom’s motto in life and now my own as well.\n\n*Thank you, Danielle!\n\n**What is your favorite skin care line? How do you define beauty? What is one of the most important life lessons you have learned so far?\n\nPhotographed by Paul DeLuna\n\nJulie Henderson is a plus model signed with Wilhelmina NY and Model Management UK in London. She has worked with many of the best photographers in the business and has graced the pages of numerous magazines. A few of Julie’s many clients include L’Oreal, La Redoute Paris, Target, H&M, Avenue, Evans UK, and Macy’s.\n\nJulie studied acting and worked for the Broadway showSex, Relationships and Sometimes…Love and was in the film August with Josh Hartnett. Julie also earned a Marketing degree and excelled in basketball at Notre Dame.\n\nJulie is the oldest of four children. Her sister, Cat, lives next door to her in NYC. Cat is working as an assistant Stylist. Julie has always, and still is, a tomboy; she started playing basketball at age ten.\n\nPhotographed by Lisa Holgrave\n\nSome people still hold the outdated thought that “beautiful” women are not intelligent. What do you have to say regarding this topic, Ms. Notre Dame Alumni?\n\nMy first thought to that was…where are those people at? They are certainly not in my world! I come from an upbringing in which the more you have inside, the more you share with the world. The more you grow yourself physically, mentally, and spiritually — the more the outside is a reflection of that! The more connected I am with the Light, (god, whatever you call it) then my physical self reflects that connection. Also, while growing up I didn’t care about being pretty. Pretty got you nowhere on the court; it actually hurt you. So, that was always the last thing on my mind. I still laugh sometimes that being pretty is my “so –called job.”\n\nNotre Dame was really good for me in a lot of ways…I met some of my best friends there. I learned how to balance having no time with having a million things to do. I learned how to handle pressure with everyone watching you. Notre Dame offers a lot of support to their students; even now that I’ve graduated, the ND family is one of my biggest supporters. They were actually the first people to see my Italian Vogue story and tell me about it! Notre Dame has alumni everywhere, and they are very loyal! Deciding to go to Notre Dame was one of the best decisions I have made in my life.\n\nPhotographed by Jessica Scott\n\nHave you ever struggled with self-esteem or body image issues in the past? If so, how did you reach the point of accepting and loving your body as it is?\n\nI guess it’s because I grew up being an athlete, but I always wanted to have a strong body that would be able to push people around on the court. I grew up very close with my dad who always taught me that my body was strong like his. I have the female version of his body actually. Henderson bodies are big and strong and can take a lot.\n\nI always took care of my body because that meant I played sports better. I never understood the whole skinny concept; those girls were too easy to knock over on the court. lol. I was quite big when I was playing in college.\n\nThe funny thing is that I’m in best shape of my life now. I have an amazing trainer, Donnie Raimon (best friends husband), he is an ex navy seal. He taught me how to eat for my body type; I have lots of food allergies: no soy, no dairy, no wheat, no gluten, and no nuts! I fly to Miami every six to eight weeks for new work outs and my body has never felt better!\n\nWhat advice would you give to young women who are struggling with self-esteem, confidence, or body image?\n\nSelf-esteem, confidence, and body image are such fickle things. I would tell girls to put their focus on other things first:\n\nFind some sort of spiritual path. That’s the only thing that keeps me sane and stable (Kabbalah), but it can be any spiritual path; yoga practice, church, temple, meditation, or Abraham –Hicks (I’m a big fan of) because self-esteem comes from knowing yourself, and for me, the only way I know myself is by having a spiritual connection. That is really my main concern/focus –am I connected to the light? Light=god=an ongoing force of energy that is constantly flowing throughout the universe that is only love.\n\nWhen I’m connected then I have confidence. Also, there are times I’m not feeling so great about myself. Karen Berg is always saying that whenever I am full of me, me, me, then there is no room for light; so I try to make room for the light to come in and share with others. When I have issues with myself, I take the attention off myself by focusing on what I can do for others (that’s what I work for, but don’t always do. lol). In my opinion, that’s where true self-esteem comes from.\n\nPhotographed by Lisa Holgrave\n\nWho do you consider a hero or role model?\n\nI have several. When I was growing up it was between Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, and Michael Jordan. Now… the one woman who I look up to in this world, more than anyone, is Karen Berg. She is the co-founder of the Kabbalah Center. She is the woman of all women in my book! She does it all! I strive to be like her every day. She has dedicated her life to making the world a peaceful place.\n\nWhat misconceptions do you think society has of plus-size women?\n\nA lot! This one gets on my nerves as well! I am told all the time that I’m not plus size! What people don’t get is that the average woman in America is a size 12/14. People believe that plus size means out of shape or bigger. I’m a 6’1” 190-pound plus-size woman who is in shape. Because I’m in shape, I can’t be plus size? There are many meanings to plus size, but people like to put the plus size term under one umbrella. There can be many versions of beauty and there can be many versions of “plus.”\n\nPhotographed by Seth Sabal\n\nWhere do you like to shop for clothes and who are your favorite designers?\n\nBloomingdales is my heaven on earth. Stella McCartney is my favorite designer: I love her Adidas line; it’s so me– sporty and fashionable in one mix! I love Elizabeth and James. Right now, all I wear are gap skinny jeans and American Apparel t-shirts with a blazer!\n\nWe know you love shoes! Who are some of your favorite designers?\n\nI wear a size eleven, so it can be quite difficult…I love payless for summer sandals, shop at barefoottess.com for larger shoes (they can be a hit or miss), and Nordstrom (on-line) has my size as well.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite beauty products or must-haves?\n\nI am a product junky. My last buy for face lotion (Katy Hanz recommended this to me; she is in love with it) was Bee Yummy Skin Food. It’s raw and organic (Live Live & Organic store in NYC or on-line at (www.live-live.com/).\n\nI also use many products from ISA’s Restoratives (www.isasrestoratives.myshopify.com). She actually grows the herbs in her garden and then cooks them up in her kitchen. She makes wonderful amazing products! I take her Chaste Tree tincture every day. I also love her yarrow and blue chamomile face cream.\n\nPhotographed by Jessica Scott\n\nPlease tell us about your athletic background. Was it hard to go from being a tomboy athlete to a being a model?\n\nYes very. Modeling actually made me bring out the girl in me. I took dance classes to become graceful and learn my body. Now I know how to tap into both aspects of myself.\n\nOut of all the places your modeling has taken you – where is the most memorable?\n\nBali/Madagascar, it takes forever to get there! It was really hard to see the poverty level there. We stay in these fancy resorts while the people around us are living out of cardboard boxes, etc. Very difficult!\n\nParis is my all time favorite; I never get enough of it!\n\nWhat are you excited about right now?\n\nCurves for Change. I love bringing whole board together to work on this project! It’s quite amazing to see!\n\nPhotographed by Lisa Holgrave\n\n*Thank you, Julie!\n\n**Julie Henderson and Kate Dillon, along with all the ladies on the Wilhelmina WCurve Board, are teaming up for a great cause – Curves for Change.
