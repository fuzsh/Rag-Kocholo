        "text": "Since you are a regular, I know that you have seen my Wilhelmina collection. You actually motivated me to check my Wilhelmina online album and I discovered some errors. A few older items never were placed in the album and I found a misplaced coin, a Black Sea ancient portraying Gordian III. So, thanks for the tune up!\n\nI thought I was the only one that likes netherlands silver. Although with me its junk silver guldens\n\nthe 2 1/2 guldens in large size are my favorite. Most of mine are 72% but I have snagged a few 1800's era in the 94.5% purity here and there.\n\nNone of them are all that common in bullion lots but I'm building a small hoard over time.\n\n@JBK said:\n\nI have also been collecting Queen W coins that were fashioned into jewelry during WWII. Pins, necklaces, etc. were made using her coins and highlighted her portrait. It was a sign of admiration for her and defiance against the Nazis.\n\nI saw just last week a bracelet made of the 1/10 gulden coins I would have bought it but it was tiny , almost child sized."
