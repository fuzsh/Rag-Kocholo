        "text": "Wilhelmina Cole Holladay, who used her social connections, organizational acumen and personal collection of hundreds of works by female painters to establish the country’s first museum dedicated to women in the arts, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 98.\n\nHer death was confirmed by the National Museum of Women in the Arts, which she opened in 1987 and had continued to guide as chairwoman until recently, holding weekly meetings with the museum’s director at her home in Georgetown.\n\nMs. Holladay, known to her friends as Billie, was a skillful Washington networker, someone who understood how to use party invitations and seats on nonprofit boards to press an agenda. But where others might have used those talents to lobby for clients or accumulate power for its own sake, she had a different goal in mind: inserting women into art history, which she believed had too long ignored their contributions.\n\nA patrician with impeccable taste and sense of decorum, she rubbed shoulders with first ladies, lunched with Mellons and Gettys, and drew on those associations and others in Washington’s cultural establishment over the six years it took to open the museum, housed in a former Masonic temple three blocks from the White House.\n\nUnder Ms. Holladay’s guidance, the museum grew to include more than 5,500 works by more than 1,000 artists, with an endowment of $66 million and a network of supporting committees in 13 states and 10 countries.\n\n“No player in the art scene has a deeper understanding of power and of money and of how our system works,” wrote Paul Richard, a critic for The Washington Post, when the museum opened. “Despite her white-glove graciousness, hard-working Billie Holladay is a warrior and a winner.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
