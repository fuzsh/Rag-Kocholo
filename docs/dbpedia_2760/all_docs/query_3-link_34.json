        "text": "Transcript\n\nPreface\n\nThe following oral history transcript is the result of a tape-recorded interview with Wilhelmina Holladay on August 17, 23 and September 16, 23, 2005. The interview took place in Washington, D.C., and was conducted by Krystyna Wasserman for the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. This interview was funded by ArtTable, Inc.\n\nWilhelmina Holladay and Krystyna Wasserman have reviewed the transcript and have made corrections and emendations. The reader should bear in mind that he or she is reading a transcript of spoken, rather than written, prose.\n\nInterview\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Hi. This is Krystyna Wasserman from the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Today is August 17 [2005], and this is my first interview with Wilhelmina Cole Holladay, the founder and chair of the board of the National Museum of Women in the Arts.\n\nHi, Billie.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Hello, Krystyna.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So I thought we can talk a little bit about your life in art, and not necessarily only in art, and perhaps you might want to tell me something about your childhood. When you were born, what was the year, and then how did you grow up to become such an important person in the arts.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, I was born in 1922 in upstate New York and I lived across from my grandmother and grandfather [Gertrude and Charles Henry Strong], and they had a great influence on my life. They were wonderful people. They had given my mother and father a house as a wedding gift, so I spent a great deal of time with them.\n\nI had breakfast with my grandfather because we were both early risers, and my grandmother was the one who really taught me aesthetics. She said, \"Always be aware of beauty. Be aware and sensitive to beauty around you.\" She might lift up an orange and say, \"Why is this beautiful? Is it the color? Is it the smell? Is it the smooth sort of oily finish when you run your hand over the skin?\"\n\nBut she did that with everything. She did it with flowers, she did it with material. And I think it was the very beginning of my heightened awareness and sensitivity to my surroundings. To this day I'm very aware of material and its texture and its color and its weave and why I find it attractive, et cetera.\n\nAnd that's true of so many things. I'll look at china, dishes. I have a collection of Fitzhugh china. And I think my interest is based on that early awareness of the beauty in my surroundings. Ordinary things as well as luxurious items.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Did your parents, did they buy art?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no. I don't think so. I mean, we had some pictures in our house, but they certainly were not -- they certainly were not schooled in art. My grandmother, however, I can remember she had in her library a wonderful -- probably a reproduction of a drawing of -- no, it must have been an engraving of Rosa Bonheur way back then.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You remember because it was a woman?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, it was a woman. And I think that, frankly, Rosa Bonheur at that time was one of the few artists period -- certainly one of the few women artists that were known in America. It was a long time before America really became aware of, interested in and supportive of museums.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yes, they had this big horse painting [The Horse Fair, 1853-55, oil on canvas] at the Metropolitan. I think that was the only woman artist --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, yes, yes. And I've been told that they have more inquiries about that painting than any other one still. Because people were aware of Rosa Bonheur, as evidenced by my grandmother's engraving, I suppose.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So did you have some reproductions of artwork in your room when you were a girl, or did you draw some pictures?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I remember having a print, certainly no great original. A print of élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun and her daughter. Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun was also one of the first known [women painters]. And to me it was just a pretty picture. It was beauty, and I've always been very sensitive to my surroundings -- I want them to please me. It doesn't matter whether they please other people, but I'm not happy if I'm not pleased with my surroundings.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So you decorated your room to please yourself?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, yes. And my room was pretty, or at least people told me so.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So that was when you were in high school?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And then you went to college?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Then I went to college.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: What did you want to become when you grew up, as they say? Did you have any ideas of what you wanted to do?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, to a degree. My grandfather lost his money in the crash in '29. His family had financed Eastman Kodak, and so the Strongs were well known. But they had a lot of stock and they had probably -- I don't know much about it, but I think probably they had bought on the margin or what have you, it was always Eastman Kodak stock. And at any rate, in '29 all of a sudden where there had been affluence there was not affluence and we had to be more careful. Anyway, I grew up, I went to school, I got\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You went to -- which college did you go to?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I went to Elmira College [Elmira, NY]. I was supposed to go away. My mother's family was from Rochester, and my father's family was from a small town outside of Elmira. My Grandfather Strong came to that area, that's how my mother and father met.\n\nHe was very intelligent and decided he had to go into business. He became a builder. And my grandmother sort of ignored the situation; I remember even then she had the first automobile. It was called a Rickenbacker, with little vases inside that she always kept fresh flowers in. It had wooden spokes on the wheels. She would take me for rides and we would travel to Rochester. It took hours and hours to drive there.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Also since you grew up upstate New York, you really grew up in a beautiful landscape.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, it was beautiful. My grandfather had a farm as well as the city house; he also had a house on one of the Finger Lakes, Lake Keuka, K e-u k a. He had many, many grandchildren, and we were divided up according to age, rather than sex. And there would come a time when all of us -- the kids that were my age would go to visit at his lake house. And he would be there. You had to swim across the lake. It was two and-a-half miles wide and you had to swim it if you wanted to swim alone.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And you did?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: After many, many tries. My grandfather would put a rope around our waist and hook it to a rowboat and he would row and when we told him we wanted to give up, we stopped. But once we did the two and-a-half miles we could swim alone.\n\nNow, that was a big deal, because no one swam alone. And so we all tried real hard, and the boys would usually make it first, but I made it finally. It's funny, when you're swimming a long, long way, you get a second breath, it's called. And I never could hold out till I got that, and I'd give up. And then one day somehow I managed to go far enough to get a second breath.\n\nIf you get that second breath, you could swim until you dropped. At any rate, I finally swam the lake, two and-a-half miles.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And you had sisters, brothers you grew up --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No. I had only one brother; he was much older than I. He was terribly bright. And he -- it was disgusting coming along afterward, because no matter how well I did, they would say, well, she does well, but she's not as bright as her brother.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Which was, of course, a lie.\n\n[Laughter.]\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, I don't know about that, but he skipped so many grades that he went into college when he was just 16. And it's a terrible shame, because he did get into some kind of trouble and dropped out and everything. But I think that -- anyway, I have no complaints about my schooling.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Did he behave badly towards you?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, no, he was very nice to me. I was the baby and he was older, and he treated me quite well. Except my mother made him take me to the golf course. He was supposed to teach me golf, he was a great golfer. He didn't like that.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: He must have been a good teacher because you won an award.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, but that was a long time ago when I was perhaps 8 or 9. He didn't want to take me. And would say, \"If you say one word you have to leave. You have to be quiet on a golf course, and don't you move when other people are.\" And I must say, I really learned golf manners, because he was so strict with me.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So it was a nice childhood in the country?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: It was perfectly nice. And I don't have any complaints about my childhood. One thing was very unusual. And this I think too contributed to the kind of person I am. While my grandmother was very aware of everything and proper behavior and so forth and so on, my mother was a free spirit. She was always gone.\n\nThat's why I spent so much time with my grandmother. And my mother had one of the first cars that you drive yourself, and was gone in that car all the time. She loved me, I know she loved me, but she really -- never once did she ever tell me to go to bed. And her sisters and brothers would come to play cards, because my grandmother wouldn't let them play cards at her house. And they would say, don't you think it's Billie's bed time? And she would say, if she's tired, she'll go to bed. And she never told me what to wear.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Well, do you think it was good?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I think at the time sometimes I wanted a little more supervision by her. But now I'm an independent spirit and freely make my own decisions about my behavior.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: I think it was good. I really like when people leave me the decision what to do.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I make my own decisions now and I'm not intimidated by authority.\n\nI don't know, but I think if my mother had not allowed me such total freedom -- my cousins and I would be given enough money to go to town, to go to a movie all by ourselves, et cetera. At any rate, that's pretty much how I grew up. And I went to college and for the most part worked my way through.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yes. So tell me about your college years. What did you major in?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I majored in business and history of art.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And I thought you said something once to me about drama.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Drama, drama. Yes. I took a minor in drama which has helped me in speech and I took a lot -- all the history of art I could possibly take. There was a professor from Cornell who came. I took every course he gave.\n\nBut actually, you see this lack of money at that period meant that I would -- might have to earn a living. And so I took business courses just in case. Now, I never really took much advantage of that when I was graduated.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yes, you did, because you sort of -- you know, when we started the museum --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I knew how a business should be structured. That came from working with my husband.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You graduated from Elmira.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: From Elmira in 1944. While in school I had had a teacher who taught me journalism. Her father was the head of a big stock securities business in Rochester, New York, where a lot of my family lived. Now, I wanted to go to New York but the family wouldn't let me go to New York. They wanted me to go to Rochester, where the family members lived.\n\nSo I did. I went and worked for Howard Ludington, as his social secretary -- Diane Ludington was my teacher in journalism, and she recommended me and her father hired me. And they sort of took me in. They had a beautiful house with a big dog and they said, you come live with us until you get settled, which I did.\n\nAnd it was a wonderful time, because I was his social secretary. I had courtesy memberships to all his clubs, and I arranged for him to entertain his clients and even arranged things for him to do at home and worked in the office to keep track of customers and not do the secretarial work, but from exposure learned a lot about the stock exchange.\n\nIt was organizing, and it was also developing a familiarity with his customers so I could know what pleased them. I mean, I really made an effort to do a dossier, so to speak, on every one of them. So that if their favorite liquor was scotch, we would have plenty of scotch for them. If their favorite meat was beef, we'd have beef when we entertained them.\n\nAnd then something happened. I had moved from the Ludington's house, because I only stayed there until I could get something set up. And there were two girls from Elmira with whom I lived.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Working with you?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no. There were two girls from college who came to Rochester. So the three of us --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: From Elmira College?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes. So the three of us took space in this big, big house off East Avenue. One of these big, big houses built by Eastman and which had been turned into a rooming house.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: In Rochester?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: In Rochester. And I remember so clearly, it was owned and run by a woman named Mrs. Hall. And she took in what would amount to roomers. So Jane and I had one huge bedroom that had before been -- this was a big formal house, and we had what had formerly been the library. And it was lovely; it had a fireplace and everything.\n\nJane and I had that, and then there were other rooms. Now, everyone there was a student at Eastman School of Music except two of us. One of our friends was, one of the three of us, but two of us, Jane and I, were not students. We had jobs in Rochester. I worked for Mr. Ludington.\n\nAnd we had a fantastic experience, because music was all around us, all our friends were musicians, they practiced there. Whatever knowledge -- and I don't have a great knowledge at all of classical music, but whatever I have, the enjoyment I now experience started from that experience.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Did they have a museum in Rochester you would go to?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, not really. But there was so much beauty. And there was theater. I remember seeing the actress Eve de la Gallienne in Chekhov's \"Cherry Orchard\" there and I saw Paul Robeson in \"Othello.\" Rochester's a wonderful city except for the weather. Oh, the weather is miserable. It's just miserable. It's cold, cold, cold.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: When you were a young woman, did you have some idea whether you want to get married, have children, or whether you wanted to work professionally, whether you wanted to move to New York? What did you want at the time when you were 18 years old or so?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I wanted to travel the world. I remember saying I want to see my whole world before I die.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And you managed to do that.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: And, well, I've certainly traveled very extensively. But no, no, I always had a dream of the big scheme of things. Always. And then this thing happened to me. My two friends that I'd gone up there with had met some boys from the University of Buffalo. And they wanted me to go over with them.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: To Buffalo?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: To Buffalo, New York. They wanted me to go over with them to -- they were going to take a test over there, I didn't even know what it was all about. And then these two boys were going to entertain them. And so they said, come on, they'll get you a blind date; we'll all have a real good time in Buffalo, New York. And I went with them and they said, \"Oh, come on, take the test.\" I didn't even know --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Because, it was --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, I didn't know what it was, I just said, \"Sure, I'll take the test with you.\" What it was was a government test, and the World War II was on. And if you passed it you had to accept a position with the government. Now, I was sort of -- I thought the whole thing was a big joke. They failed it, I passed it. I was drafted to go to Washington.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Oh. And that's how you came to Washington.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: And that's how I came to Washington.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: During the war time.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: During the war.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: 1944 or '45, what was the year?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, I believe the year was '46.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yes, and you took this job.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I've forgotten some of the dates. But anyway, I went to work for General Hausman. And that was where -- that was the Air Force Readjustment Division at the Pentagon.\n\nSo I went to work for General Hausman. And General Hausman was head of the Air Force Readjustment division. In other words, when the soldiers would go into the north of Africa they needed certain equipment. When they left Africa and went into the boot of Italy, all those contracts had to be terminated and new contracts made. And that was what General Hausman's division did. I was his assistant.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Very difficult.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: And it was very, very hard work. I worked six days a week one week, seven days the next week. My two friends decided to come with me to Washington and join me.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: The ones who didn't pass?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, that they could get other jobs. There were lots of jobs because it was during the war and there was a dearth of men, they were all in the service. So the three of us found an apartment.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Where was the apartment?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: The apartment -- oh, it was just luck. My mother's cousin was the congressman from a New York area and through him we got an apartment owned by the Godwins. Earl Godwin was a commentator on radio, and he had a wife, Queenie. They had gone to some other place and turned the house they owned in northwest Washington into apartments.\n\nIt was off Columbia Road. It was in a section -- a densely populated section of free-standing houses, but near a whole lot of other things. It was a fun place to live, you could walk to a movie, stores, restaurants, etc.\n\nAnd so my -- my room mates and I took this apartment that was on the second floor. It was just two big rooms, a bath and a terrace that was over a porch overlooking a little park. So it was really quite nice for the three of us. The housing was impossible in Washington, so we were very, very fortunate.\n\nAnd then this beautiful blonde room mate of mine Marion Campbell -- took a job where they were dollar a year men who were experts throughout our country. And they would come in, and agree to work for the government for the war effort for one year for a dollar. They were like people in the service, but they were top businessmen.\n\nAnd the last -- when they came to Washington, their last final clearance was in Marion's office. And they would ask her out. And she'd say, \"I can't go unless my room mate goes.\" So she would come to me and the two of us would go out with these men who just wanted a farewell dinner in America.\n\nThey were married; they had children which we hear all about. My mother would have died if she had known we were doing it, but it was all really very innocent. We'd take them to the most expensive place for dinner -- and we loved doing that, because --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: What were these good places?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, there was a place called the Blue Room at the big Shoreham Hotel.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Anyway, the biggest hotel had a Blue Room. And they served food and had a show. And so we would say, well, if you want to have a nice evening we must go to the Blue Room.\n\nIt was a great treat for us, because we didn't have to cook, we didn't have to buy food, and plus that we really enjoyed ourselves. And if -- and most of them were gentlemen. And there was no hanky-panky of any kind.\n\nBut if they drank too much we would excuse ourselves to go to the ladies room but instead would take a cab and go home. And that's what we did. When I look back at it that was awful. But we certainly enjoyed Washington.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Because it was such an interesting time.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, it was an interesting time. It really was. And then what happened was that Marion met the Chinese diplomats. And she said, \"Billie, I want to have the Chinese to our house for drinks, but I want you here.\" Because we didn't entertain alone at that apartment, and we really were respectable young girls.\n\nAnd I said, well, it'll have to be one of those rare nights when I'm off. I never knew whether I'd have to work late. Oh, it was awful over there at the Pentagon. One night the Chinese came for drinks.\n\nAnd there were just two of them. And one was named Jen Zien Huang. H u a n g. And he was called JZ. And was very attractive, personality wise. And he said to me, \"Tell me what you're doing.\" And I told him. He said, \"Do you like it?\" And I said, \"I hate it.\" I said, \"I'm working myself to death and it's not interesting, it's nothing I'm interested in. I'm doing okay, but gosh, six days a week and then seven with only one day off every other week. \" -- and he said, \"Why don't you come to work for me? \"\n\nAnd I said, \"I can't. Because I'm working during the war, I cannot quit.\" He said, \"Oh yes you can since we have diplomatic immunity.\" And I said, \"You have diplomatic immunity?\" He said, \"Yes, you can resign and we can hire you.\"\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Because that was the Embassy of China?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: China. And he was the representative of the Nationalist Party. He had taken the title of attaché at the Chinese embassy to have diplomatic privileges. He was actually the liaison between the Nationalist Party, because they were in power then, and the U.S.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: No, that was still -- that was --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Chiang Kai-shek was in power.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: He was in power and he was -- JZ was the representative of Chiang Kai-shek's party and our government. I mean, he was the one that negotiated on behalf of the Chinese.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So you decided to work for him?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, I went to General Hausman and said, \"I'm leaving, I'm going to work for the Chinese.\" And he said, \"You can't leave, Billie,\" and I said, \"Yes, I'm leaving.\" And he said, \"I will not sign your release, so you will get no other job in America.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"I'm going to go work for the Chinese and I don't need a release because of diplomatic immunity.\" And he just shook his head and off I went to the Chinese embassy.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And that was, what, one year later?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: About.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So it must have been already after the war, '46?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no, no, no. The war was still on. Well, I'm not positive, because the negotiations -- no, the war was about to end or had ended. See --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: When you were working for this embassy? General Hausman?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: When I worked for the embassy. See, the reason I'm a little hazy is it was a long time ago. But not only that, even after the war ended all contracts connected with the war had to be finalized. And so General Hausman probably was over there doing it long after the war, but that's sort of beside the point.\n\nI went to work for the Chinese, and the war was almost at an end but I think it was still on. And I loved working for the Chinese. I loved it. I mean, we didn't go to work until ten o'clock. And JZ, his job was to cultivate the people important in Washington.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Politically important.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Politically important in Washington. And he went about it in a fantastic way.\n\n[Audio break]\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Okay. So now perhaps you can tell me a little bit more about your experience with the Chinese embassy.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, JZ, his job was to cultivate important people in Washington. Toward this end, before I went to work for him, he enrolled in police school, saying that it was to learn for the Chinese from the Americans how to run -- how to do police work.\n\nWell, what it really turned out to be was that he was the pet of the class, he was a great actor. He was pet of the class and years later, when I went to work for the Chinese they needed to know how to formalize fire departments. Honestly, Americans were naive. He went to school with these firemen and became pet of the class and graduated.\n\nAnd when I went to work for him, he knew all the fire chiefs. Now, the only person that can get into any building, any room in Washington, D.C. is a fireman, to do a fire inspection. They have access anywhere to do fire inspections. I mean, this was a power structure. I was so fresh out of school, having worked for a while in Rochester but not for long, and then for a while at the Pentagon. And now here I was in a totally different position.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So you really learned how to make things happen, how to get things done, how to negotiate.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I mean, I saw what power could do in Washington. And I met many, many people, and I would set up a poker game at General P.T. Mao's house and the senators would come.\n\n[Audio break]\n\nSenators would come and the Chinese would determine how much money was going to be lost to them. It was unbelievable. When I look back and realize how sort of gullible and naive I was, because of course I wasn't I - actually arranging everything, but I caught onto it all after a while. Negotiation was done in Chinese and I didn't speak Chinese.\n\nYou've got to remember -- and he was not a part of this, because he was far too honest, but Harry Truman was a poker player and he was in the Senate. So it was very important to know his fellow poker players. We'll never know if Americans were aware.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: It was really a game which you learned to play.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: In Washington, the Chinese played the game. I found out that it's a great asset to be underestimated. A great asset. We arranged to send over General MacArthur and his wife to report back on the Chiang regime.\n\nMacArthur was sent to China to evaluate the situation with the Nationalists. This is before the communists. I was instructed to find out what kind of sheets do they like the best on their bed. What kind of food do they prefer? What kind of reading do they most like?\n\nWhat are their general hours of retirement and rising in the morning? I had to find out everything I possibly could. And so of course I did. Fortunately I was able to get much information. They lived down in North Carolina where their regular home was, so I went down and gathered information.\n\nI wrote it all up and then this went to China in the diplomatic pouch. When they got to China, they were cosseted. They didn't see a thing they weren't -- you know, I mean, they saw what the Chinese wanted them to see. They were made very, very comfortable.\n\nIf you don't speak Chinese and you're in China, you've got to be taken care of. So MacArthur came back with these glowing reports and I knew that those reports had been manufactured by the Chinese. Now, it wasn't the end of the almighty scheme of things at all. And, you know, to a large degree this has -- the Nationalists lost when the U.S. thought they would win.\n\nWhen Madam Chiang came, she spoke before a joint session of the Congress. The only woman ever to have done so. After that I was then made her social secretary.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: That was still in Washington?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, they sent me to New York. And they put me up in the Waldorf towers. She lived at Ditmar House in Westchester. If she were going to entertain, I would go to the public library and prepare a dossier on every guest. And let's say the gentleman that was going to be at her dinner party, I would be able to give her information, and she would turn and say, \"Your daughter went to Wellesley, I went to Wellesley also.\" \"And I understand you have a summer house at such-and-such, I've been there once, and it's very beautiful.\" In other words, anything I could dig out for her.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So your dream to go to New York came true --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I was then up in New York. I loved it, because I could go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, etc. However, Madam was very demanding.\n\nAnd quite frankly, all of this has helped me with the museum. It just --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: In a way how to play.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, this -- in Washington, the Chinese played the game. And I also found out that it's a great asset to be underestimated. A great asset. We were going to send over general -- what was the general -- who was the general, Krystyna, who went over with all the wonderful things America did after the war?\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Marshall?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: So he was going to go over and represent them. And when he came back -- he quit, he came back and he was totally disillusioned. And I said, \"What happened?\" And he said, \"There's nothing I could do.\" He said there was a place where the Chinese were starving and where it was terrible, \"and so I arranged to have food sent there and with the money UNRA has and all to benefit these people with clothing and food.\n\nAnd the Chinese came to me and said, forget it. These are the refugees coming from the north to the south. And the more that don't die, the bigger problem we have in the south.\"\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Oh, what a terrible thing.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I mean, it's not that the Chinese are so terrible, really, it's just they're different from us. Totally different in their values and in their sanitation and in almost everything you can name. They would spit in the drinking fountain, so I never used it.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Well, you know, this is a different culture.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: This is a different culture.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: But then after you worked with Mme. Chiang Kai-shek for a while in New York, you decided that that was enough and you wanted to come back --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no. I worked for her -- I'm trying to remember the sequence, because it's difficult. But I worked for her for a long time until she went back, and then I went back to the embassy. I quit the embassy when I had a child.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Really? You really worked that long for them?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, I worked for quite a while. And I got to know the Chinese. And the Chinese are very different from us. The Chinese -- you know, it's not all bad, but they have a totally different sense of time.\n\nFor instance, to prepare JZ they sent him to police school, they sent him to fireman school; they did all those things I mentioned. We would probably not do that if we were preparing someone to go to China. It also taught me patience is important if you are looking far ahead at a long term goal. And with the museum they didn't happen right away. You cultivate, you are careful, you work hard and things happen.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So that was kind of an education in learning what you don't really want to do all your life.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, I learned Yes, yes.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And then your life really changed very dramatically\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Very much.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Because you got married.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And how did that all happen?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, I met a man named -- dear, I'm not sure anybody wants to hear all this. I met an officer named Taylor Simmons. We were just very, very good friends. His father was a general. We really liked each other, the two of us, and we did a great deal together. We dated. There was -- it was not a romance.\n\nHis mother and father lived at the 2400 Hotel, which was then a posh residential hotel. A friend of his father, an admiral who also had a big apartment there was told he had to go for health reasons to Arizona, to a dry climate, and he offered the apartment, fully furnished with everything, for Taylor to use while he was gone for a couple of years. Taylor acquired two room mates, the war was over and people were getting out of the service.\n\nAnd so Taylor's roommates were Basil Crabster and Wallace Holladay. Taylor called me up and said, \"Come to our housewarming and see where we are living.\" I had a big embassy car and I didn't want people to be aware that I used it for parties. So I said, \"Is there a place I can park this car? I'm going to be coming in a diplomatic car and I shouldn't use it for parties.\"\n\nWally Holladay answered the phone and said, \"Oh, I'll meet you down front and I'll take it to the garage.\" So I said, \"I'll be there in 15 minutes.\" When I arrived there was Wallace Holladay. He took the car and I went up to the party.\n\nThen I met Basil Crabster, the other roommate and found him fascinating. He had gone to Princeton and then on to Oxford and he'd been in the service with Wally. Basil and I are flirting and having the best time, everything's going great, and he asked me to have dinner with him.\n\nAnd Wally came over to me and he said, \"You seem like a nice girl.\" And I said, \"Well, I hope so.\" And he said, \"Basil's fiancée is here.\" I said, \"Basil's fiancée is at this party? I had no idea he was engaged.\" And Wally said, \"Yeah, she's kind of upset.\" I said, \"He asked me to go to dinner with him.\"\n\nAnd Wally said, \"Well, perhaps you could be my date and he could bring Mary and then we can kind of fix it up.\"\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So that was Wally Holladay. And he was a student in Washington at that time?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no, he was just getting out of the service.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yes, yes, because --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes. He was just getting out of the service. He was still an officer in the Navy. So we went to dinner. That's how I met Wallace Holladay.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: He was from Virginia?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: He was from Virginia and had gone to VPI [Virginia Polytechnic Institute]. He was going back to VPI as soon as he'd get -- could get out of the service to get his master's degree in architecture.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Already he knew that's what he wanted to do?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh yes. He was an undergrad in architecture and he was going back to get a master's degree. He was also very interested in art.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So, he really made you interested in art?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, yes, well, we just got along wonderfully.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And you went to the museums --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh yes, we did everything together. We went out constantly together and -- and he fell in love. And I said, \"Don't get serious, I'm going abroad.\" You know, I still had this thing.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: To travel.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: To travel. That was what I wanted to do. And I'd been offered a job in Aruba and I didn't want to go there particularly but, I was really going to look around after the war so I could travel.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: But you still worked for this embassy at that period?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You had the car.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, yes. I was working for the embassy. Every single day Wally would propose to me, and after a year was up -- and I had the apartment then by myself, because my two room mates had gone on to different things: marriage and so forth.\n\nAnd so Wally kept proposing and one night I said -- we were smooching on the sofa -- I said yes. He said, \"Did you say yes? Did you say yes?\" And he got up and he left, closed the door, walked out, came back 10 minutes later and said, \"Did you say yes?\" And I said, \"Yes, I said yes, Wally, I'll marry you.\" And he said, \"Can we get married tomorrow?\" And I said, \"No, we cannot get married tomorrow.\" But, you know --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You were ready to --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I was ready then. I had really fallen in love with Wally and I was ready to get married. So we got married. So now --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You were married in Washington?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, we were married in Washington. And my mother and my brother came down. Then Wally received an invitation, a fellowship with [Walter Gropius] Gropius at Harvard. And so we thought we were all set and we would go up to Harvard.\n\nThen I became pregnant. And I thought I had ruined Wally's life, but he said, \"Who needs a doctor's degree in architecture? I'd probably end up teaching and I don't even want to teach.\" He said, \"I'm going to make money now thru FHA [Federal Housing Administration]. I'm going to make money, if I'm going to be a father.\" He was offered a job with - it was the government agency that would loan money to rebuild after the war. And there was a man named Ian Woodner in New York who came down here to do real estate development.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Build houses?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, he came down, but Wally was working at the FHA. Wally's job was to review people's plans, review their background and determine whether they were eligible for a loan from the government to do what they wanted to do. So the --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: To build houses?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Right, to build. To develop.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: To develop.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: And Wally was in that position. He was given the job because he'd had high marks; he had a master's degree in architecture and so forth. So he would review their plans for what they wanted to do, look over the site, look over everything about them. And so he had a position of some importance, because he would make the decisions regarding loans.\n\nIan Woodner came to apply, and he liked Wally and Wally liked him. One reason was their mutual interest in art. Ian had worked with Salvador Dali on the World's Fair on Long Island [1939]. And Woody had received the Prix de Beaux Arts which enabled him to paint in Europe for a couple of years. He was first an artist and then he became a businessman.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yes, there is still the Woodner House on 16th Street. That's the same family.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Right. Wally designed that with Woody.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Really?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Now, Woody came to Wally and said, \"Come to work for me.\" See Wally had taken this job at this government agency just till we would go to Harvard.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yes.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: So he came home and said, \"Hey, I've got a chance to make good money, but its not just architecture.\" He'd been offered lots of jobs with architectural firms. He said, \"I like this. It is pretty exciting, and I'll be designing a hotel on 16th Street with Woody. I'll work directly with Woody.\" So I said, \"Fine if you'll be happy.\"\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And you were still living in town, or --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, we then took a place in Virginia in a little apartment. Woody loved Wally. He thought of him as his son. Later Woody became ill and had to turn his business over. The doctor told him he would have to go away for a while. He came to Wally and said, \"You are the only person I am willing to have run my business while I'm away. Will you do it?\"\n\nWallace Holladay worked harder than anybody I've ever known. He would get up at the crack of dawn and go to the office. He would come home at 10, 11 at night. I mean, he worked so hard. And he was walking into Chase Manhattan Bank and saying, \"I've got to borrow $6 million,\" and he was so young, just in his twenties.\n\nWoody came back after two years and the business was booming. He said, \"My business has never been healthier, and you have all the credit.\" And he said, \"Wally, you can have anything you want. You can have 50 percent of my business, you can have -- you name what you want.\"\n\nAnd Wally said, \"I want nothing.\" Wally had never even asked for a raise. He said, \"I want nothing, except I'm giving you one year's notice, and then I'm going into business in competition with you.\"\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Because he learned.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: He had learned so much. And that's what he did. But Woody adored Wally all his life. Woody only died a couple of years ago. Woody had this great, great collection of art. He started out with drawings and then went on to other things. But the Metropolitan Museum of Art showed his art collection. I mean, they would have exhibitions of his holdings and he'd always invite Wally and me up and would announce, \"I want to introduce Wallace Holladay,\" -- he treated Wally like a son.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Okay. I think maybe we end here.\n\n[Audio break.]\n\nHi, this is Krystyna Wasserman interviewing Wilhelmina Cole Holladay at her residence in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. Today is August 24, 2005. And this is our second interview.\n\nBillie, when we talked a week ago we discussed your experience of working for the Chinese embassy. And you worked closely with Madam Chiang Kai shek. Did you know that she was a painter?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I didn't know it at first. And when I found out, I wasn't terribly surprised, because knowing she was a very bright, observant person and could do so many things, it sort of followed that she would be interested in the arts and would exercise any talent she had. And she was very talented.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Well, we also never mentioned that you studied art history in France during your early years. And I wonder whether you could mention that, because that probably was a wonderful experience. And when was that, that was after Elmira College graduation?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, and later on, actually. It really was a marvelous experience. I went to the University of Paris, and there were people there from all over the world doing graduate work on history of art. I can remember once the professor when I asked about American artists, he said, \"But there were no women painting in America.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Well, what about Mary Cassatt,\" just because everybody knows her. And he said, \"Well, she's French.\" And I said \"No, no, no, no, she's American.\" He said, \"No, no, she's French. We gave her one of the biggest awards.\" And this was true. America never recognized her, but the French did, and they did give her an award of standing.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: That's interesting. I think we should go ahead. We ended last time talking that you got married, you had your first child or you were pregnant with your first child and you stopped working for the Chinese embassy. And how your life changed.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, it changed dramatically. We were living in a small apartment in Virginia. My husband said, \"Now I think we'd better build a house.\" He was an architect, had a master's degree in architecture. And so he said, \"I'm going to go look for a proper place to build.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"Tell me what you would most like and I'll come as close as I can to it, I'll search for a site.\" And I said, \"Well, I would really like a penthouse on Garfinckel's roof.\" Garfinckel's was the top department store. I am a city person and I've always loved living in the city.\n\nAnd so finally he came home and he said, \"Well, I've found the spot. And I'm buying it.\" And we got in the car and we drove and we drove and we drove. And I said, \"Oh my goodness, where are we going to live?\" Because it looked absolutely like the country to me. And it turned out that it was Georgetown Pike, which runs along the Potomac River.\n\nAnd at that time it was exceedingly rural. And dear friends of ours who had lived in an apartment near us and we'd become very close friends said, \"Would there be another piece of property next to it that we could buy and share? And you could design a house for us too.\"\n\nAnd so that's what we did. And we lived out there until our children were born and until they went to college. So we lived there a long time.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: But you were going to the city in the meantime?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, absolutely. It was -- actually, I know exactly the timing. It was 10 minutes only, at that time, to get to Chain Bridge so that you could go into Washington. But later on it became increasingly difficult as McLean, Virginia -- and that was our address -- became more densely populated. Now it is just an extension of the city, really. But it was very country-like at that time.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So you played golf, you socialized, you went to the children's school and you were active in the parents committees, yes?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: My children went to a small school called Langley School. It was simply wonderful. It was -- started out as a nursery school, pretty soon they put on first and second grade, and now I think it takes children to the second year in high school.\n\nBut I was put on the board and I decided that they needed a new building, so I worked very hard to raise the money and to get that developed, and we did acquire a new building. I had a marvelous board. I was able to get people very prominent in government, because they lived out there with their children. And Ted Sorenson was on my board, who wrote the book about JFK [John Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis, 1976], and [Joel Macy] Macy, who was the head of Civil Service, was also on my board.\n\nSo it was very interesting, it really was. And it was at that time that I decided I had to take a speech course. I had had some work in drama in college, but I remember going before the mothers and fathers, all the parents of the school children, and having to tell them that there would be a raise in tuition. And I'll never forget it.\n\nI was so frightened that I became ill. And so then I took a speech course. All of these things that happened then were wonderful for my eventual experience in the museum.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: That was the speech class at the university or the private class?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no, it was a very special class given by a woman named Hester Beall Provensen. And it was -- I had turned it down many times because it was really very social. I remember Ladybird Johnson and all these people took it. I really felt I didn't have time for that kind of social bit in the city with children and my work at the school and all.\n\nBoy, then I found out how tough it was to get up, I -- before a group of people -- it was very different from drama. Acting which I'd studied, is where you throw yourself into a character, and here it was a totally different thing. So I went and took the course and I studied very hard, it was 10 weeks long, and I won first prize. And ever since it has helped me, because for the museum I have to speak often.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Often, everywhere, all around the world. But Billie, that was also the time when you started to collect art for yourself.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: To a degree.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Because you developed the most important collection of art by women perhaps in the world.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, I think so. Really I do.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: It was once in your own house. And so how did that all begin?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, first of all, we needed a few pictures for our house. We certainly didn't think of ourselves as collectors. There was a huge high school in Arlington, Virginia and they had an art show of all the works of the students, and Wallace and I went to it and we looked over all of the things and found something we just loved for $100 and we bought it.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: What year was that, roughly?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I'm so sorry, I don't know. Probably --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Fifty?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Perhaps 1950. It gave us great pleasure to own and enjoy this work of art. It was the beginning.\n\n[Audio break]\n\nMy husband was wonderfully supportive. I can remember him working at the Langley school fair, et cetera. We made great friends and it was an interesting period of my life.\n\nMy brother had taught me a little bit about golf and I decided to take it up. And I had two -- knew two women who were taking it up quite seriously. They asked me to join them, and so I began to take golf lessons. That was fun, but it was hard work, because I like to do things well and I wasn't very good at it.\n\nSo I waited until my two children were in school and then I became very serious. And Wiffy Cox, the pro, was a great teacher at a country club here in the area. I took lessons once a week, I practiced every day a little bit, etc. determined that I would be a respectable golfer.\n\nAnd by the end of that summer I had broken 100. And once you break 100 at golf, you have a handicap and can play with your handicap with almost anyone. And, of course, I proceeded to become a better golfer than that. But I think that some people -- probably in a sense it's a lack of security, but some people feel they have to do well with what they do.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And you are one of these people?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: And I'm afraid I'm one of those people.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: I'm sure you are, because I see all these awards for golf on your table. But let's go back to art.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes. So, art. I'm so fortunate that I've lived here where there are good museums and I've spent a great deal of time in them --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So you bought this work from Arlington and then you wanted more or how did this collection --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no, something else happened that was important. My husband began to establish his business, and he started in the Midwest. He was gone a great deal of time and I was lonely. So I went down to the National Gallery of Art and took a test. You had to take a test to even work in the gift shop. And I passed it. And I took a part-time job at the National Gallery of Art.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Doing what?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I did some short tours, on the weekends when the real staff wasn't there. I worked in the gift shop, answering questions of people who came in. That was the only information desk they had at that time.\n\nEvery night before I left I had to check every painting in the museum to make sure it was hanging in its place before they turned out the lights. Things like that. But it was a fantastic learning experience and certainly enhanced my interests in art. And I began to have favorite artists or artists I wanted to know more about, and so I became better informed than I had been.\n\nAnd I had enough of a background to sort of sustain this. And I can remember, because at that time we really couldn't afford major works. I would buy a poster or something, frame them and put them up. That was a great enhancement of my interest in art. And then --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And you bought more art, better art?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: -- for the Washington house?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, we were still living in McLean. And I was working at the museum part-time. And something -- this is just a silly little thing, but a print became available of an artist that I admired, an original print, and that wasn't terribly expensive. It was not a costly one, but it was a print of a Renoir.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Wow, that was very valuable.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no, it was not. I think I paid maybe $200 for it. But you've got to remember, this was years and years and years ago.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: But still, that was a big name.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, it was a big name. And I still have it, and I'll show it to you. But at any rate, I bought it. It was just a small, small beginning. And then I started going to galleries and I went to Harry Lunn's gallery. He saw photography as art and he actually was the one who established photography as art. Years later this paid off, because I knew Harry Lunn and he would alert me to things by women that were important. I bought Berenice Abbott photographs from him which she did when she was in Paris.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So early.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: That was early. But let's get onto the point where Wally and I really did begin to buy some art. We were traveling with a great collector, Richard Brown Baker, who was one of the big brains during the war who broke the code of the Germans.\n\nHe had been at Oxford and was an important person, and then when he returned to the states he decided that the one thing he wanted to do was to collect art. He had an apartment in New York and began collecting contemporary American art. He was astute enough to get Lichtenstein, Pollock, and Rothko. All the ones that became great.\n\nDick Baker had those early on. And we were traveling with him and we had bought a few things. We had purchased some Rouault prints that were very beautiful, and we had bought quite a few things that were reasonably good. But again, we didn't think of ourselves as collectors, we just were buying things for our house that appealed to us.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And you didn't have this focus on women at the time?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no, no. Oh, no, no. But Dick said to us, you must have a focus. You're buying art now and you have to have a focus. It will be more interesting to you and to others. His focus, of course, was 20th century American art. We didn't want a focus, because we only bought what really appealed to us. We didn't want to be limited to one period or one artist or one type of art.\n\nBut then we saw a really beautiful work. We were traveling a great deal and we saw a beautiful painting by a woman in the National Museum in Austria and her work again at the Prado in Madrid. And then when we came home, since neither one of us knew her, even though both of us had been interested in history of art for many, many years. We took out all of our source books and we made a discovery that while --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: That was Clara Peeters, yes?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: That was Clara Peeters. And Clara Peeters wasn't in any of the books, but neither was there any other woman. And as a matter of fact, until the year we opened there wasn't one woman in the leading texts in our country.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yeah, by Janson [H.W. Janson], Art History. We all studied that.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: We decided that that might be a great focus to show the contribution of women to the history of art, which obviously needed doing. We could buy a piece of sculpture, a painting, a watercolor, whatever appealed to us. We decided that that would be our focus. We would try to show the contribution of women to the history of art.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And you didn't have a great feminist ideology which supported this decision at the time, because you just said that it was unfair not to have information about women --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, mostly we felt that there was a whole gap in the history of art that needed filling, that absolutely was a legitimate part that was missing. So always from the start it wasn't really in a sense that women hadn't been treated right, we certainly found that out later on, but it was more the fact that we wanted to be -- to contribute to the history of art, as far as knowledge was concerned. And we were very fortunate. We traveled all over the world. By now I was on the board of the Corcoran. And\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: How did that happen, to be on the Board?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: They invited me to be on and I accepted and found it very interesting. I was on their Works of Art committee. And I was pretty well qualified and the meetings of the committee enhanced my knowledge.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: In collecting art?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, in collecting art by women. Wherever we traveled we'd go into the top commercial gallery and say, \"What do you have by a woman?\" And they'd say, \"Nothing.\" And we'd say, \"Well, that's what we're interested in.\" Six months later they'd be back in touch and say, \"We have found a magnificent work from 18th century France or 17th century Dutch or the Renaissance by women.\"\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Please mention a few names so people will understand how important these artists were, like Vigée-Lebrun or Angelica Kauffman. I remember you once told me a story how you bought Angelica Kauffman and I think it's a fabulous story how you bought the painting. That would be of great interest to anybody who reads your interview.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, if you study the history of art or you love art, it's all wrapped up in history. For instance, Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun was the court painter for Marie Antoinette, which meant in her day she was very, very prominent, a leading artist. And the Royal Academy in France opened up and allowed not only Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun but three other women to become -- four in total -- to become members of the Royal Academy. That was the first time women had ever been in it. As a matter of fact, there aren't any women in it right now.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Really, that's terrible.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: So there were some other woman who had worked with the crown, with Marie Antoinette, and they were included. We are so fortunate, because in the museum now, Wallace and I have given them an example of all four of these women. There's Marguerite Gérard, Adélaide Labille-Guillard, Lebrun, and the fourth one is Anne Vallayer-Coster who worked with the queen.\n\nWhen others discovered our focus, they began to alert us to where works by women might be found.\n\nFor instance, we brought a Judith Leyster from the Chrysler Museum. They de- acquisitioned it and we bought it at a very reasonable price. A few years ago we loaned it from the museum for a show in Europe and it was appraised for insurance purposes for something like $300,000 or $400,000. I assure you we did not pay that for it.\n\nWe also found many, many other artists. We found an Artemisia Gentileschi; we were alerted to in Paris. We found the Lavinia Fontana we gave to the museum from the late Renaissance. She was actually the leading artist of Bologna in the 1500s. The Pope had her come and be the Vatican painter at that time. And, Sofonisba Anguissola, who was the first woman artist to be internationally known. The King of Spain had her come to be the court painter.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You just collected art and you kept it at home and you were happy looking at all these women artists.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Um-hmm [affirmative] and we bought it with quite a bit of help because I knew many people in the field.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Art historians or dealers or both?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, both. And directors at museums, and so forth.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Because they knew by now that you really collected art by women and they would tell you if something was available, yes?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes. At that time, right at the height of this I think Fortune Magazine listed the 10 major collectors and that we were one. That brought us to the attention of many, many dealers.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: I see, so you would --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: So we were approached often.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And at that time you didn't have yet any idea what you would do with all this art.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no, we just wanted --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You just enjoyed it.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, when you really and truly get into the collecting of art, it's so meaningful to you that it has a life of its own so to speak. You don't want to stop because you just love whatever you buy and the excitement of acquiring something that you know is rare and that you're very lucky to have found is an exhilarating experience. And I wouldn't say it was always my favorite or that I was in love with each picture because our goal was to show the contribution of women to the history of art. That was always foremost. So we didn't buy anything we didn't think was significant because of that. Our collecting went on and of course it included works from the Renaissance to the present.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: That's unusual because, you know, contemporary art by women was very hot in the '70s but you really had this unique approach to start early.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: We felt that while we loved contemporary art, certain things in it, we felt we had to grab those that were historically important because we knew they might not ever be available again. They were rare, it wasn't easy to find a Clara Peeters, but we did and bought it. It wasn't easy to -- it was almost like luck when someone would call us up and say I just heard there was this available, or one would come up at auction.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Tell everybody how you acquired the Angelica Kauffman, the circumstances of the purchase.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, it was incredible. We have an apartment in New York and I was there and an Angelica Kauffman was coming up at auction. I hadn't had an opportunity to see it so I called up and since they knew me I said \"Look, could I come and take a look at the Kauffman.\" And they said \"Yes, we'll give you a look at it.\" So I went early. A little later, a terrible storm, one of the worst ever, hit New York City and I was already at the auction house. As a result, many, many people did not arrive and when the auction started as advertised, at a given time, the eighth item was this beautiful Angelica Kauffman. It was handsome, it was a large one, of an English family, and I bought it for $8,000 which is incredible, but no one else was there to bid on it.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: That's an unusual story because nature was on your side.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes. And after the auction four or five people came up and offered me a huge profit which I didn't take. I was so thrilled to have gotten it for the collection because she was probably the most successful woman artist in the 18th century. She went to Italy and when the Empress of Russia, Catherine the Great tried to get her to come to Russia she refused because she was so very busy in Italy with commissions. The Empress collected her art in spite of her refusal to come to St. Petersburg.\n\nMany wonderful things have happened that have helped create the collection.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And the seed of the museum was planted in your head when and who did it?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, the real person who did it -- there were several people who had mentioned the uniqueness of the collection and all, but not the idea\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You invited them home?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, people gradually became aware of it. And some of the feminists who were scholars became very interested. Linda Nochlin and Ann Sutherland Harris had created an exhibition in the '70s. It was the first one ever of women artists entitled Women Artists, 1550 to 1950, and some of our paintings were in that exhibition. So people began to know about what we were doing and there was a heightened interest. Nancy Hanks who was sort of the godmother of the arts, she was I believe the first head of the National Endowment for the Arts, and she worked with the Rockefellers on their collection. So Nancy and I knew each other and we had dinner together one night and she said, \"What you've done to me is that I go now into museums, as I always have, however, now I say to them what do you have by women?\"\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Nancy said this?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, Nancy would visit a museum and ask about what was in its collection by women. And she said it would come as a big surprise when after much thought they might come up with one and after checking say \"Well we have two.\" She thought it incredible, the dearth of material in our museums by women. And she said, \"These museums are all by men -- the directors are men and the collections are by men. She said we ought to have a women's museum.\" This was a big joke to us at the time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking about it. She also thought about it and called me up and said \"Would you give your collection and your library as the seed from which such an institution might grow?\" And Wally and I said \"Yes, we might.\" So we formed a committee. Nancy had lots of clout so we had prestigious people in the museum, social and political worlds. It was a great committee.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: This was an advisory committee or founding committee?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, they came to see what we might be able to do about this. And they said \"Let's start out with a museum without walls. Let's see what kind of material we can gather.\" We pulled together a young committee that went to embassies around the city asking about women in their country, and asking for material.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Who was on this early committee can you remember at least two or three people [From a Washington Post article, \"The Founding Force of Wilhelmina Holladay\" Sarah Booth Conroy, February 15, 1987 the following names are listed as advisory committee members: Lamia Khashoggi, Mary Lasker, Nancy Clark Reynolds, Mary Jane Wick, Claire and Gloria Getty, Diane von Furstenberg, and Louise Nevelson]?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Louise Nevelson was on the committee and she was probably the most prominent women sculptor at that time.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Okay. So, Billie, we are talking about these early days of the museum when you really got the idea of developing the museum.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: We formed this committee of people. I remember Cynthia Helms, her husband had been the ambassador to Iran, and Mike Ainslie was head of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and various others. All of them were people that were qualified to perhaps help us work this out. We met from time to time. Then something very unusual happened.\n\nA young woman who lived next door to me said, \"What are you doing? I see you come and go all the time.\" And I said, \"Well, I'm working on the formation of the National Museum of Women in the Arts.\" She said, \"I find that fascinating.\" She was a student at Georgetown and lived with a young man who'd been in the Peace Corps. She had a little boy about three years old who was adorable. One day he fell and she was frightened. He needed a pediatrician and I took them to my grandchildren's doctor. So we became acquainted.\n\nShe said, \"I'm very interested.\" She said, \"I'd like to know more about it.\" And I said, \"Well, why don't you come to a meeting. We're having one next Tuesday.\" And she came, but had to leave before the meeting ended because she had a class at Georgetown. I was saying goodbye to her and she said, \"You need a building.\" And I said, \"Oh, someday.\"\n\nShe said, \"You know, Mrs. Holladay, I really want to help.\" And I said, \"Well, tell me what committee you want to be on and we'll do something about that.\" And she said, \"No, I mean I really want to help.\" And I said, \"Well, that's wonderful, my dear. And Wally and I are going off on a vacation to the Caribbean and when I get back we'll get together and talk about it.\"\n\nSo I went back into the meeting and someone there said \"Is that Getty as in J. Paul Getty?\" The young woman's name was Getty and it just never occurred to me. I never even thought about it. And it turned out that was her grandfather. Mike Ainslie and my husband then found the building we now own.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: That was 1250 New York Avenue, our present headquarters.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: That's right.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And when you first went there?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, it was in a dreadful state of repair. It had been the home of the Masons. So it was certainly well built [designed by Waddy Wood] and it was built in 1908 -- seven or eight [1907] -- and the Masons had moved to the suburbs. This whole area of the city was a slum, a real slum. There were pornographic shops, one right next door, and the police told us it was just dreadful, that we had to be very careful. The building itself had been turned into a questionable cinema. The homeless people would buy a ticket to get out of the cold and come in and drink. It was really bad. When we got down there to look at it, not only were there these poor unfortunate creatures all over the place but there were rats huge rats. I'd never seen things like that, and I just said \"Let me out of here.\" But saner heads prevailed and they convinced me it was going to be just beautiful when it was all restored. Two and a half years later it was.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: That really was a major step.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: A major step.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You found the place to house your collection because until now the collection was in your house we are now in and you would give tours, yes?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: We had already started working on the idea of the museum in temporary headquarters and --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: On Connecticut Avenue?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: On Connecticut Avenue and you, Krystyna Wasserman became our librarian, so to speak, with the library we had collected. That was very important because eventually that grew to be the tail that wagged the dog. We had some other young people working there and so forth and finally had to move to bigger quarters, still temporary quarters, on MacArthur Boulevard, then we had a first time director and other people helping.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You had a curator of education that organized tours of your collection at your house and --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: The Junior League kindly gave us our first big grant and it was enough to hire someone to handle the --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Education.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, really to develop a group of volunteers.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Volunteers, yes.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: A volunteer coordinator. And she pulled together some founding members who agreed to be docents in our house. Every Thursday we would take reservations to have people see the art in our house which was extensive, and --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And you were leading the tours too because you had some very important people at the time.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, yes.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: The president's wife, the governor's wife.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, that's right. They'd call up and want to see it. So I did. I took some of the little ones. But on Thursdays it was groups who would get a reservation and that was handled by docents. Many things happened about this time. I don't know what to go into and what not to go into, but it all led to the formation of the museum.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: With the board?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, we put together a board of about four or five people just to start with. The Junior League people that had helped me were on it and --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Roma Crocker?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, and some others that were close friends. And Helga Carter who's still very much interested in the museum and supports us financially was my husband's accountant and she agreed pro bono to be our accountant and treasurer.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: I remember her, she was so nice.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh, she's a wonderful person.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: She still works?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: She still does, 20-some years and she's retiring this next year. I don't know what we're going to do without her. She's wonderful. She adores Wally. He's sort of her pseudo father or something. And he was in her wedding, gave her away. So it's a very sad time to have Helga leave. But every year she gives some money to the museum in honor of us, she's so loyal.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You started to renovate the building?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, no, what's more important we -- Claire Getty gave a million dollars, she got her sister [Gloria Getty] to help us, Wally and I pitched in. I went to New York and called on all these corporations for money and was able to get American Standard to give the plumbing, DuPont to do the carpeting, AT&T to do our library and so forth. And when we went to the bank to borrow money to do it -- now, we had the deed of the building and we had bought it for $5 million. Well, when people found out that this whole area was going -- it wasn't very far from the White House -- and when people found out this whole area was going to have a museum, the property values went up. The bank's appraiser appraised it for $12 million. As a result we were able to borrow $8 million for the renovations. We borrowed $8 million and that plus all the in-kind gifts. We did the whole thing.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So that was a major effort.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: It was a major effort and it worked. I said at the time anybody who gives $1,000 a year or $5,000 will be a founding member and have their name up forever. And people said \"You can't do it like this. You have to ask for bigger sums.\" I said \"No, this is the way I'm going to do it.\" I didn't know how many founding members I'd get, you know, but it would be money coming in. We got almost 500. So it was quite a lot of money.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Founding members, yes?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes. And their names are still up there in the entrance to the museum. We did this over a period of the first few years. It not only helped pay for the building and get it up but also it established a constituency and many of those people are still our friends and most of them are members. They had an investment in the museum and were excited to watch it grow.\n\nI don't know how many people give $1,000 a year, $2,000 a year. I always look up their histories because I acknowledge their contribution. It's amazing to see that many of these people started out with $25 memberships and then gradually increased it to $50. I kept them informed and gradually they gave $100, then $200, then $500 and now they're giving $1,000, $1,500 or $2,000. It's wonderful to see the loyalty and continued interest of these early members.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yes, because you really have people from all walks of life.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: It's true.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: One of the very important factors of our success is that you didn't narrow your support to one group or another; you were very open, not only to different kinds of people, but the whole nation because you had this idea of getting support from different states. So maybe first you can say a little bit about the renovation of the museum because we finally opened in 1987 and then about the beginning of the state committees. The idea developed when you were still in the temporary headquarters, because you traveled --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, with regard to the renovation of the building, Julie Harris, the great actress, did a nine minute film for me. Elizabeth Campbell had established public television in this area and was my friend and mentor. She had formerly been the Dean of Women at Mary Baldwin College. Her husband was a prominent lawyer. I admired her greatly because she worked hard for the good of the community and through public broadcasting had begun to educate many viewers. She and I were on several boards together and had become close. I sought her advice because she was so wise and had done so much in developing something truly substantial like public television.\n\nSo she said to me one day, \"You need to have the tool of a video. And I know just the person to do it. Julie Harris.\" I said, \"You know Julie Harris?\" She said, \"Yes, I do. We both have the same Moravian religion.\" Julie Harris came to Washington, saw what we were trying to do in the museum, it was in the process of being renovated. And she agreed to do this nine minute video for me. She could charm the birds out of the trees -- it was a fabulous selling tool.\n\nSo I would go in to these corporations and say I've got a nine minute video, a secretary would get it all set up for me, and if I may have 15 minutes more I'll be up and out of here, because I knew all of them were very busy. And it worked. It really worked. I was able to get all kinds of things.\n\nI grabbed hold of any lead. A young girl, whose father was the CEO of Martin Marietta had been in my child's wedding, and I said, \"Fuzzy, I don't know your father, but I'd love to have an appointment with him. I want to go to Martin Marietta to see if they might be interested in helping.\" And she said, \"Oh, my father will do anything for me.\" She was an adorable young girl. And I said \"Please bring him to the house for a drink,\" so she did.\n\nAnd I said, \"I just wondered if I might meet with your foundation to see if Martin Marietta would be interested in helping with the National Museum of Women in the Art?\" And he said, \"Well, they don't meet with people. You present a proposal.\" I said, \"No, I want to meet with them.\" And he said, \"Well, I guess\" -- Fuzzy said \"Yes, daddy.\" And he said, \"Okay, I'll fix it up so you can meet with the foundation. But, I'm going to tell them that it's up to them because I try not to interfere.\" I said, \"Oh, that's fine.\"\n\nSo I went to meet with the foundation, I showed the Julie Harris video and then told them what I was trying to do. The next day they called me up and said, \"For the first time ever after you left, we all said let's do something big.\" The men and women gave me a million and a half over 10 years for the Martin Marietta Great Hall. It is very beautiful.\n\nThese wonderful things happened and we've enjoyed good relations ever since. I'd never been a fatalist before, but I am convinced the museum was meant to happen because things did fall in place and have continued to do so. Fantastic. It's wonderful.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And then we had the great opening and actually the renovations of the building got an award.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, we received many awards.\n\nI was so lucky Wallace was an architect. He would bring those drawings home and study every inch of them. No one ever had more conscientious planning. Clark Construction did the actual restoration and they won a prize and the interior design division received a prize. The success was truly exceptional.\n\nIn 1987 we had the opening. Mrs. Bush, senior cut the ribbon. Helen Hayes came and gave us a painting. The Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts attended along with the Mayor's wife, etc. It was wonderful.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: A big splash.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, a big splash.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And the exhibition was \"American Women Artists: 1830 to 1930.\" It was curated by Eleanor Tufts.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, that's right, Eleanor Tufts. It was very well done and we were lucky to have her because she was a fine scholar.\n\nI have the catalogue, \"American Women Artists: 1830 to 1930\". It was our first exhibition. United Technology was extremely generous. They underwrote a beautiful catalogue as well as the cost of the whole exhibition.\n\nThe exhibition traveled quite extensively. It went to other museums. Let's see -- it went to the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Wadsworth Athenaeum, the San Diego Museum and to the Meadows Museum. This was good because it heightened the awareness of NMWA and gave us a presence in different places.\n\nThen we had a second opening with the permanent collection. Wally and I had been able to give to the museum approximately 500 works. We just told them to take anything they wanted and they took everything. The house looked so funny, all the white spots on our walls where the pictures had been. The whole house had to be redecorated.\n\nThe second opening was funded by AT&T and it was of the permanent collection. It created the first museum catalogue and was done by Gottlieb of Abrams. It was an exciting opening because it was our permanent collection and was done by invitation. We invited all the people who had helped and those in the city that we wanted to know about it. It was a huge success. A woman who was the vice president of AT&T got up and spoke and gave us a beautiful award which is now in our library. She talked about how important she felt the museum was.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And the balloons went up, red and blue balloons and I thought it was just absolutely splendid.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: It really was. It was exciting. It was exciting and then we all went inside and exclaimed over the beauty of the great hall and so forth.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: People were pushing through this door which was too narrow and I remember there was the Ambassador of Spain in Washington next to some lady in a wheelchair and he was pushing her in because she was so eager to see this museum that's just opened.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, getting NMWA to that point was the result of a great deal of effort on the part of many people. And I must say that one of the big things that happened in connection with the museum was unplanned. A man came to me and he said, \"I am a professional in the field of direct mail\". This was before we all got tons of it. And he said, \"I think your museum could benefit greatly from direct mail. Now this was before the renovation. I said, \"We don't even have a museum yet, it isn't open.\" And he said, \"No, but you are cause related and I really think you'd make out tremendously well.\" And I said, \"Well, what will it cost?\" And he said, \"$40,000.\" And I said, \"I don't dare risk the museum's money, but I'll put up the money myself and take a chance.\" So we went ahead and the return was astounding. He couldn't get over it and I was thrilled. We opened the museum with 60,000 members.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: That was --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Sixty thousand members. That's more members than any other museum in our country had. And Mrs. Bush was so impressed she announced it in her speech. We don't have that many members now and the reason is that after we started I was determined we would curb expenses and be in the black. During our first five years we had to open a gift shop, we had to open a restaurant, we had to get the library functioning. There were so many things to do that we cut out prospecting because it is expensive.\n\nAs a result our membership went down because there is always some diminishing. Once we had some other needs taken care of we started up again a few years ago and are up to 40,000 members. I think we added 8,000 last year. We'll build it back up. But even now our members come from every state and 25 countries and we are one of the largest 10 museums in the world when measured by membership.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yes, Billie because it really is so unique for our museum to have these state committees and international committees. Maybe you could tell a little bit about this idea.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, from the very beginning I didn't want it to be specifically a Washington museum. I wanted it to serve all women and knew that if we were going to accomplish our goal of educating people about women we had to go further than just Washington, D.C. So we decided to have state committees. The first committee we had was in Texas and it was wonderful. Elizabeth Hutchinson who's husband had been the Secretary of Transportation --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: In Johnson's administration?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: In Johnson's administration. Elizabeth was a VIP in Texas. She had run political campaigns in Texas. She came on our board and said, \"Now, we'll start with a committee in Texas.\" I was traveling at the time on behalf of the museum and my secretary called and said, \"Mrs. Hutchinson wants to know what you want her to do in Texas.\" And I said, \"I don't know anything about Texas. Let her do anything she wants to do. I trust her totally.\"\n\nWhen I returned my secretary said, \"Well, you'll be in Texas for two weeks,\" and I was shocked, I hadn't dreamed it was going to be so extensive. But, we went. We started out in Dallas and Caroline Hunt knew Elizabeth Hutchinson. Caroline gave a bountiful tea at her hotel, The Mansion. I was in the receiving line and the women arriving were dressed magnificently. Seventy women came in beautiful clothes and jewels. I must say I was impressed. When everybody was in Caroline turned to me and said, \"I like you.\" This openness of Texas was overwhelming. I wasn't used to it. I hadn't anticipated it, but I found it utterly charming. So I said, \"Well, I like you too.\" She had set up a mike and I gave a little speech about the museum to the guests.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: You show slides usually of the collection --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, not then -- that was before the slides even, before the slide presentation. I do now. But I told all about our plans and they got excited. And then we traveled to other cities. It was blue bonnet season and Elizabeth Hutchinson grew up driving a car. It was incredible. You just drive and drive and drive in Texas, and there were gorgeous blue bonnets, yellow wildflowers and pink wildflowers. We visited all over Texas for two weeks and I remember wherever we went someone would do something nice for us. We went to -- I remember Martha Buchanan owned a hotel in one of the Texas cities and she gave a luncheon for me. And Ellen King of the famous King Ranch people gave a luncheon in Austin. In Waco a woman named Jo Stribling gave a dinner. Her husband owned the local television station so I was on television.\n\nWe just went from place to place all over Texas for two weeks. Elizabeth had run political campaigns and I swear that's what it was like. Finally, on the very last night after ice cream socials and everything you can think of in the way of entertainment, we were in Forth Worth. Our hotel rooms were adjoining and I said, \"Elizabeth, I'm going to get in that bed, I'm going to order a bowl of soup and I am going to sleep and goodnight.\" And she said, \"Now Billie, now Billie, now Billie, just it'll be -- you just have to stay for a minute or two but there's a very important woman in Forth Worth and she wants us to come and I really know you should meet her. It's important.\"\n\nShe went on and on so I said, \"Okay, Elizabeth.\" So I got dressed up and off went to see this woman. And Elizabeth is assuring me that it won't take long. We arrive and it's a beautiful house. The woman was delighted to see us and she said, \"Mrs. Holladay, I have arranged a very special dinner for you of these wonderful, wonderful little birds we cook down here from a special recipe\" and so forth and so on. I look over at the Elizabeth and she's looking up at the ceiling and [laughs] and she had tricked me into it. And of course it was a wonderful dinner and a wonderful evening. Now, years later from that trip, Martha Buchanan is on the board of our museum. I met her years ago at her hotel when she gave the luncheon for me.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And many of those women who formed that early committee are now on our National Advisory Board.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And they have been supporters for so many years.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: You'll have to get out the details because after that visit, Elizabeth came and said, \"You have to come back because we have not covered the state.\" The state is huge. And I said okay. So we went back to Corpus Christie and all these places we hadn't been able to do the first time we did the second time. We still have a fantastic committee there.\n\nRecently I went down for their 20th anniversary. You see, they started two years before we opened. And they had all brought their daughters. Every time they have a meeting they beg me to come, and I do go as often as I can. It's always with husbands, etc. It's a big house party and it lasts three days -- they do everything on a big scale. But this last time I went down Joe and Teresa Long gave this very special dinner in their house. I went in and discovered a museum. They have an extensive collection. The have Berthe Morisot, Georgia O'Keeffe, but also Degas and great male artists.\n\nThen the next day was their business meeting. I attended and they had a big surprise for me. For each year that they had been in existence they gave $1,000. They handed me $20,000 as a gift to the endowment.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Fabulous --\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: I know.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: It's fantastic. But your vision was to have a committee for the National Museum of Women in the Arts in almost every state.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: And it wasn't that they would raise money for us, it was that they would continue our raison d'etre of educating about women artists and in return it would mean more members of course, which it has. They have been well planned with the governor's wife as the honorary chairman, etc. She would open the governor's mansion and have a reception for the members of the state, etc. As the committee became better organized and had greater interest in the museum they started giving us needed gifts: the amplifying system in our auditorium, restoration of art, etc.\n\nWe went from Texas to other states and now we have perhaps 20 in the United States. We didn't do it alphabetically or geographically. When the right person, an \"Elizabeth Hutchinson\" showed up ready to form a committee in a state, then we worked closely with her and helped. And our state committees now are really a backbone of the museum. They offer significant outreach.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And also you didn't mention that one of the objectives of the committees is to present art from their state in our museum.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh yes, that is wonderful and important. Once the committee was fully established and had been incorporated in their own name so that they could raise their own money for an exhibition, they could apply to have an exhibition of the women artists of their state in our museum here in Washington. So far we have had 15 and they've been simply great because there's a rich diversity of talent throughout the country and every state is different. It's amazing how the art has reflected that difference.\n\n[Audio break.]\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Okay, Billie. I think we talked last time about the importance of the state committees and international committees as an outreach of the museum. Can we finish that part of our interview -- can you say something more about these committees?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, the committees are essential if we're going to be more than a Washington museum because they are outreach and they extend the efforts of our raison d'etre by making people aware of women artists and the museum.\n\nAnd, of course, it's a win-win because it gives these contemporary artists an opportunity to show in the nation's capital and good things come. It heightens their popularity, they sell paintings, etc. As the world has grown smaller, we have felt the need for a presence abroad and have been able to form outstanding committees in Paris, Italy, London and India. The committee that we have in Paris for instance had me to go to the Marmottan Musée and meet the Director and talk with him. That museum had much of the work of Berthe Morisot. This initiated an eventual exhibition of their great collection of Berthe Morisot. It was probably the most popular exhibition we've ever had.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: One of the most popular because Camille Claudel and Kahlo, Carr and O'Keeffe they were also very popular. We've had many good exhibitions. But we may talk about this exhibition a little later. At the last meeting of the Works of Art Committee you talked in a very interesting way about your collecting and I thought some of your thoughts about collecting art are really valuable for anybody who would listen to this tape so could you repeat some of the things you said?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, I think I've mentioned my friend, Dick Baker, before. Richard Brown Bake was a great collector. He was the first person to collect American contemporary artists. Early on he went to every show in New York. He was a Rhodes Scholar, was wealthy and after he came back from London after World War II -- it was he who broke the code of the Germans during the war -- he decided that he would devote his whole time and energy in collecting top notch contemporary artists, American artists. He was the first one to buy in depth Jackson Pollock, Lichtenstein, all of the great artists that have since become very, very famous. They were all in his collection and he gave them all to Yale. He's also given art to RISD because he was the Brown family from Rhode Island.\n\nEarly on my husband and I traveled with him extensively. When he saw that we were buying a few works of art he said \"You must have a focus. It will be more important to you and to others.\" We did not think of ourselves as collectors and bought only that which we loved. Then, in an attempt to discover material about Clara Peeters who hung in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and in the Prado, we discovered there was almost no material on women artists.\n\nThey absolutely hadn't appeared in exhibitions et cetera. And it was something that would sustain the momentum because it was almost a monumental task, an endless task. And that line of acquisition was something that not only kept our enthusiasm up but became increasingly important as we delved into it and realized the extent of neglect women artists had had.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: He also defined what a collector needs to do to be successful, didn't he?\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Mayor Barry, Effie Barry, everybody --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: But you made yourself known to the gallery owners that you really had a focus and that you collect women artists of all periods and that was -- that opened the door to all these markets which were then after you trying to present art by women to you hoping that you may buy some.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: That's right. And also because I had worked at the National Gallery of Art when I was young and had been on the board of the Corcoran I had a lot of friends in the art world. And once they discovered that this door which was too would point out possibilities. At any rate, Dick and I met and talked about this and he took me to some of the galleries in New York. He was a wonderful, wonderful companion and as a result of that -- this was long before we had made any decision to collect art by women, but all of the things he said to us about collecting came back to us when we decided on this as a focus. And it seemed to embody everything he had said. I'm so glad we listened to him. He had written me a wonderful essay on collecting. I've always kept it.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Is he alive?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: No, no, he's dead because he was older than we and he was very active in World War II, he was very important.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So he had never seen the museum?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, he had one time.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Oh, good.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: One time he came to the museum and just marveled and I gave him so much credit, of course, because he had led us to a focus and described how collecting should be. We learned so much from him that enhanced and added to the whole effort of the museum.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So we can consider him one of your mentors actually?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Oh my yes, he was a mentor. My husband at the time was certainly very understanding and always supportive, but he was establishing his business and was very busy. Knowing my interest, he was glad that I had Dick with whom I could go to the shows in New York and the advice of someone truly knowledgeable.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Yes, of course. And then you started to acquire art for yourself first and then for the museum. Do you have favorite pieces?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: You know, it's amazing. We love best what we know. My taste in art changes all the time. When I'm collecting a particular artist I try to become very familiar with her history and with her work and for a while she gets to be my favorite artist. And then I move on. If I become interested in another artist that I feel the museum is going to eventually need and that I would enjoy having in my house in the meantime, then I study that artist.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: So who is now your favorite artist?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: My favorite artist right now is Gwen John. Gwen John was the sister of Augustus John and she is a wonderful artist. She sort of draws you into a picture. Her work is very subtle. One time Augustus John said, \"One day I'll be known as Gwen John's brother.\" And, recently the Tate Museum had an exhibition of the two [\"Gwen John and Augustus John,\" 29 September 2004 - 9 January 2005] of their work. My husband I had loaned a painting and went over for the opening. There was celebratory diner and all. When it was reviewed by the critics it was exciting to me to find out that the emphasis of the reviewers was on the work of Gwen John. Wally and I have purchased three more examples of her work, but there are few available.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Wow, that's fantastic. And when you acquire art, how does all that happen? I remember one time you told me about your Christmas presents from Wally and the family gatherings and everybody sees the new painting first and then we're of course getting that for the museum. But could you just say how some of your acquisitions came to your possession?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: We have a family tradition. I have four grandchildren. The family comes here on Christmas Eve and we get all dressed up. One time Wally said to me, \"What do you want for a Christmas present?\" I said, \"I want a butler and a cook on that night so that I can dress up and be comfortable with the family.\" And he said, \"All right, you find them and that's your Christmas present.\" So we were able to get a wonderful professional butler and cook that worked at Blair House and arranged dinners when they had foreign dignitaries visit. They were very special. And that has been my Christmas present every year since.\n\nAnd so Wally would -- he knew what I wanted in the way of art of course, we've talked a great deal about art, and he would buy something as a surprise and hide it in an open place where everybody could see it\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: But you.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Well, I would be busy and I wouldn't notice. It was never very -- it wasn't in the middle of the floor. For instance, when it was a Harriet Frishmuth's sculpture for our fountain out in the garden, he put the lights on out back and put a big red ribbon around her. Had her installed on the Q.T. in the middle of our fountain. Put a big red ribbon around her waist and tied a bow. It was the nude figure of a very young woman.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: And she did these beautiful young sort of blossoming into womanhood figures. This one is up on her toes like she is dancing and there's a frog at the back spitting water. But I was very, very busy and didn't look out the window and didn't see it. Of course, the little children were tee-heeing and talking and trying to make me aware of it in a funny way and I wasn't paying any attention whatsoever, I was just busy making sure everybody was being properly taken care of.\n\nAnd finally the littlest one said, \"I want you to look out the window.\" And I said, \"Well, fine, why? What's out there because it's evening, it's nighttime.\" And he said, \"I want you to look out the window\" and he took my hand and dragged me over to the window and there was this beautiful statue. It was a present to me. And, of course, the children just loved this and the next year -- when I sit at the table with the fireplace behind me (we always have a picture over that fireplace). And unbeknownst to me the picture had been removed and the one Wally had bought as a Christmas present was hanging. But again --\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: Which work was that?\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Eva Gonzales, yes, I think it was Eva Gonzales.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASSERMAN: It is a beautiful painting.\n\nWILHELMINA HOLLADAY: Yes, it is a gorgeous painting. I had admired it greatly. It had been recommended by someone in Europe. It was too expensive and I didn't think we could acquire it. And so that night I was busy again and I sat down in my place. Everybody was seated at the table and then eventually the littlest one again said, \"Please look over -- turn around and look, look.\" And I said, \"Well, why, dear?\" And he said, \"Please turn around and look, look up.\" And there was the beautiful Christmas present. But the children loved this excitement and Wally did too.\n\nKRYSTYNA WASS"
