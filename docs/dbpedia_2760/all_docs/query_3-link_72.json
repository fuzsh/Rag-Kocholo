        "text": "Say what you will about Wilhelmina Slater, the rightful heir to the MODE magazine throne on Ugly Betty, but you can’t deny that she is the ultimate feminist icon. Wilhelmina, who is played perfectly by Vanessa Williams, had confidence, sass, and did not hesitate to let anyone, including her ~boss~ Daniel Meade know exactly how she felt.\n\nNearly eight years after the finale of the ABC comedy, Wilhelmina’s girl power attitude is more relevant than ever — and it’s no surprise that Vanessa has gushed about playing the chic fashion mogul. “A lot of the stance, the carriage, and the facial expressions are where the real power lies. That’s what makes Wilhelmina great,” Vanessa told Entertainment Weekly in 2009. “Sometimes it’s just a look or a sigh or a roll of the eyes or a turn of the back, and that’s weighted enough. It’s been my favorite role of a lifetime, and I truly enjoy coming to work every day.”\n\nShe continued, “Our writers are brilliant. I never know what’s going to come out of my mouth. And the people I get to play with are amazing!” It’s also no surprise that Vanessa, Michael Urie (Marc St. James) and Betty Suarez herself America Ferrera, are keeping their fingers crossed for a reboot. “That’s not true, but if you tweet it… everybody here take out your phone,” America said of reunion rumors at the ATX Television Festival in 2016. “Hashtag: Betty Reboot. We need a hashtag and tweet it out and then we’re going to get… a two-hour special.”"
