        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nWelcome to the next installment in this series of posts about my recent holiday in Sweden. In this post we are back on the move, heading north along Inlandsbanan.\n\nTHE JOURNEY\n\nVery soon after leaving Vilhelmina Norra behind us we made a brief stop at Storuman.\n\nAfter Storuman there was again a period of taking pictures through the window of a moving train.\n\nShortly after I had taken the picture above we arrived at Sorsele, which is significant as…\n\nTHE STATION WHERE INLANDSBANAN TRAINS MEET\n\nYes, it is at an otherwise insignificant dot on the map called Sorsele that the northbound Ostersund-Galiivare service overlaps with the southbound Gallivare-Ostersund service. Sorsele is also home to the Inlandsbanan Museum, although I chose not to go inside. Thus I have many photographs of this location that is so important in the workings of Inlandsbanan…\n\nAfter a brief move we including the lake below we arrived at Slagnas\n\nAfter leaving Slagnas there was a reasonably long period of forward travel…\n\nWe then had a stop for long enough to stretch our legs at…\n\nARVIDSJAUR\n\nI was able to take a few pictures here before we moved on.\n\nMoving forward again, I was still taking pictures through the train window…\n\nWhat looks like a black raindrop in the picture above is actually a mark on the window that got into more than one of my photos! It was very soon after this picture was taken that we arrived at…\n\nTHE ARCTIC CIRCLE\n\nThis was not the first occasion I had been into the arctic – on my only previous visit to Nordic lands in 1994 I had gone by train from Helsinki to Narvik in Norway, with a brief bus ride from Haparanda to Boden in the middle,, and after a night in Narvik had caught a bus to Tromso before then travelling by boat to the most northerly town in mainland Europe, Hammerfest. However in those days I had no camera, and also the point at which we reached the arctic circle was not announced. Here are the shots i took from inside the train before I knew that there would actually be a stop:\n\nI end this post with pictures taken out in the open at the arctic circle:"
