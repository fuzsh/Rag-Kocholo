        "text": "It’s another week here at BCB After Dark: the coolest club for night owls, early risers, new parents and Cubs fans abroad. We hope you had a good weekend. We’re so glad you stopped by tonight. New friends or old, you’re all welcome. Come in out of the heat. There are still a few tables available. Bring your own beverage.\n\nBCB After Dark is the place for you to talk baseball, music, movies, or anything else you need to get off your chest, as long as it is within the rules of the site. The late-nighters are encouraged to get the party started, but everyone else is invited to join in as you wake up the next morning and into the afternoon.\n\nThe Cubs were shut out tonight 3-0 by the Minnesota Twins. I have some family obligations on Monday nights. I normally get home in time to see the final few innings, but this one was over in 2:16, so I missed the whole thing. It doesn’t sound like I missed much.\n\nLast week I asked if it was time for rookie first baseman Michael Busch to start against (most) left-handed starters. A large majority of you, 76 percent, think it’s time for Busch to play every day. Sure, it might be OK to give him a rest against someone like Chris Sale, but otherwise, Busch should be in the lineup. Which makes sense since he’s been one of the Cubs’ best hitters since the beginning of June.\n\nHere’s the part where I talk about jazz and movies. You’re free to skip that. You won’t hurt my feelings.\n\nHere’s a video that just got posted earlier today of pianist Emmet Cohen, drummer Evan Sherman and legendary bassist Ron Carter playing a set at the Birdland Jazz Club in New York. This show is from this past June.\n\nCarter is still amazing at 87 years old.\n\nWhen you think of the great director John Ford, what comes to mind immediately are gorgeous Westerns, dramas about the struggling lower classes and screwball comedies. OK, maybe not screwball comedies. But Ford did direct a kind of screwball comedy in 1935 with The Whole Town’s Talking, starring Edward G. Robinson and Jean Arthur. The Whole Town’s Talking may not be your typical Ford film—or even your typical screwball comedy—it’s still a very fine movie that serves as a star vehicle for Robinson playing a dual role.\n\nRobinson plays Arthur Ferguson Jones, a mild-mannered clerk who fancies himself a writer. Jones is a very contentious worker with a set routine, living by himself in a modest apartment. He secretly has a crush on co-worker Wilhelmina Clark (Arthur), a free spirit who treats her job as frivolously as Jones treats it seriously. Clark doesn’t think much about Jones at all—or really anything else related to her job.\n\nBut Clark reads a newspaper at work and notices that Jones looks exactly like “Killer” Mannion (also played by Robinson), a notorious and violent gangster who is wanted by the police. Of course, in a case of mistaken identity, Jones gets picked up by the police for Mannion’s crimes. Since both men look exactly like Edward G. Robinson, everyone identifies Jones as Mannion. Clark doesn’t exactly help things out because she pretends to be Mannion’s gun moll. She fingers Mannion for every crime they throw at her because she enjoys making the police look like fools.\n\nEventually, Jones’ fingerprints come back and they don’t match Mannion’s. The police decide to release Jones, but they’re worried that someone is just going to pick him up again because he looks exactly like Mannion. So they give him a letter saying that he’s not Mannion and that he’s not to be arrested. (The cops in this film are portrayed as morons.)\n\nOf course, this brings the actual Mannion to Jones’ door, who realizes that the letter Jones has is an automatic “get out of jail free” card. Mannion decides to hide out in Jones’ apartment—who is too meek and scared to protest. Jones goes to work during the day with the letter and then Mannion gets the letter at night so he’s free to commit crimes while Jones sleeps.\n\nOn top of this, a local newspaper uses Jones’ desire to be a writer by getting him to pen a column offering his thoughts on Mannion. Clark finds out about this and appoints herself as Jones’ unofficial agent. But the actual Mannion is very concerned about his public image, finds out about the column and starts dictating it himself—foolishly using information that only Mannion would know.\n\nThe first part of The Whole Town’s Talking is a basic screwball comedy setup with a mistaken identity take. It could be mistaken for a Frank Capra film of the period—which makes sense since screenwriters Jo Swerling and Robert Riskin were well-known for their collaborations with Capra. But the film takes a really dark turn in the final third of the movie—much like Something Wild (1986) went from screwball comedy to violent thriller after Ray Liotta showed up. The Whole Town’s Talking doesn’t go nearly that dark and there are still some comedic elements until the end, but it’s the same kind of sudden shift of tone.\n\nThe main attraction of The Whole Town’s Talking is the dual performance of Robinson as the meek Jones and the violent gangster Mannion. Robinson is parodying the gangsters he played earlier in the decade—in fact, Robinson had sworn off gangster films at this time but couldn’t resist the challenge of the dual role and the skewering of the “gangster” typecasting that he’d been locked into. And while Edward G. Robinson isn’t known for his comedic chops, he does a very good job here as Arthur Ferguson Jones, who meekly under-reacts to all the insanity coming down around him. And it must have been fun for him to be one of his own torturers in the gangster Mannion.\n\nJean Arthur is playing the same kind of career woman that she seemingly always played in the thirties. Clark isn’t as streetwise as some of Arthur’s characters, but she’s the typical kind of free-spirited and independent woman that we see in rom-coms even today. And bless her heart, Arthur continues to act in a screwball comedy all the way through, even after the change in tone. Arthur’s comedic performance softens the shift in tone that could have otherwise have been quite jarring.\n\nThe Whole Town’s Talking is one of those films that John Ford directed in the period between his silent movie career and Stagecoach in 1939, which turned him into a star director. Ford directed a lot of these pictures as he had a reputation at the time for working quickly and cheaply. As such, The Whole Town’s Talking was a low-budget film (other than Robinson and Arthur’s salaries) and there aren’t a lot of the things that we associate with Ford from his bigger projects later in his career. But in The Whole Town’s Talking, Ford does manage to get in a plea for the plight of the “little guy.” Jones is portrayed as a decent guy living a meager and unappreciated life. His bosses not only don’t value him—they don’t even know who he is. Ford never talked about politics and always claimed he never put any in his movies, but it’s clear he was a New Dealer who was always thinking about Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s “Forgotten Man.” Arthur Ferguson Jones is nothing if not the “Forgotten Man,” at least until someone noticed he looked exactly like a gangster.\n\nThe Whole Town’s Talking isn’t going to end up on any lists of the best screwball comedies, gangster movies or John Ford films. But it’s a very solid piece of entertainment that provides some laughs and is a must-watch for any Edward G. Robinson fan. Because this film is really about letting Robinson’s talent shine through.\n\nThere are a couple of uploads of The Whole Town’s Talking on YouTube. Here’s one of them. I couldn’t find an official trailer for the film, but here’s a scene from very early in the film.\n\nWelcome back to everyone who skips tonight’s jazz and movies.\n\nTonight’s question concerns Cubs’ reliever Héctor Neris, and whether you want him back with the Cubs in 2025. When Neris signed with Chicago this past offseason, he and the team agreed on a $9 million team option for 2025. However, that team option becomes a $9 million player option if Neris pitches in 60 games or finishes 45 games, as long as Neris doesn’t finish the season on the injured list.\n\nAs it stands right now, Neris is on-pace to pitch in 63 games, so it’s going to be close as to whether or not that option becomes a player option or a team option. That assumes Neris stays healthy the rest of the way, which maybe we shouldn’t assume.\n\nBut the details of the option are unimportant for tonight’s question, which is “Do you want Hector Neris back with the Cubs in 2025?” A look at the basic numbers of Neris’s season would indicate that it could be an easy call to want him to return. He has an 8-4 record with a 3.60 ERA. His 15 saves in 19 opportunities isn’t great, but it’s not terrible either. Besides, no one is asking if we want Neris back as the Cubs’ closer, a job he got forced into when Adbert Alzolay was ineffective and then injured. We’re just asking whether or not it’s worth $9 million to have Neris pitching somewhere out of the Cubs bullpen next year.\n\nBut a look under the hood isn’t as optimistic. Neris is striking out 9.23 batters per nine innings or 23.6 percent of batters. That’s not great, but it’s good. But it’s also a career-low for Neris. So that’s a troubling sign.\n\nBut the flip side of that is that he’s also walking 5.63 batters per nine, or 14.4 percent of the batters Neris has faced. Those numbers are also career highs. Neris’ FIP (fielding independent pitching) is 4.37, which is his highest total in that category since his rookie season in 2015.\n\nOn top of that, Neris just turned 35 years old in June. I’m not one to get hung up on ages for pitchers and I’m especially not with relievers. But time is undefeated and eventually it’s going to catch up with Neris. But it should be noted Neris’s velocity is actually up a tiny bit from 2023, when he had a very good season for the Astros.\n\nTo counter those arguments, I’ll just point out that Neris is considered an exceptionally positive clubhouse presence and as a mentor for young Latin players. Every Spring Training, Neris takes every Latino minor leaguer out for dinner. He’s someone who really cares about young players and takes an interest in them.\n\nAlso, while Neris was admittedly pretty terrible for a stretch in May and early June, since June 22, Neris has pitched in 14 games and has posted an ERA of 1.35 and a FIP of 1.74. And while that’s a small sample size, Neris’ strikeouts are up and his walks are down in that time period.\n\nJust a reminder—I’m not asking whether or not you want Neris to be the closer next season. Only if you think it’s worth it to pay him $9 million to pitch somewhere out of the bullpen in 2025.\n\nThank you for stopping by this evening. I hope we’ve been able to cheer you up some. Please get home safely. Recycle any cans and bottles. Tip your waitstaff. And join us again tomorrow for more BCB After Dark."
