Once completed, our New Faces team will reach out to arrange a meeting if you are currently what we are looking for. We require all potential models and talent to visit our office for an in-person meeting to be considered for representation.\n\nWe do not accept walk-in appointments, hold open calls, or see anyone without an appointment.\n\nYou do not need professional pictures to submit. Please refer to the images shown above; the images being submitted should be natural, nicely lit images of you. Unedited, photos in color, in minimal to no makeup are preferred. Submissions sent with Face Tune, Instagram, Snapchat, or any other photo filters will not be considered.\n\nParents: If you are bringing children into the agency for potential representation, please be aware that auditions take place in our office space; children should be respectful of our space and furniture. We will politely ask you to return at another time if we feel your child is not yet ready to be in a professional setting.\n\nIf you are a developed/trained actor, please send a recent headshot and resume to our On-Camera Director: cassie@wilhelminadenver.com.\n\nIf you have a Mother Agency and are interested in being represented by Wilhelmina Denver, please have your Mother Agent contact us at newfaces@wilhelminadenver.com.\n\nPLEASE NOTE"
