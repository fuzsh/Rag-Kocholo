        "text": "Today is launch day for our Spring ‚Äò24 collection here at Thread¬Æ which means it‚Äôs time for me to send a few of you some free stuff to celebrate the launch. Comment what your favorite design is from the new collection and I‚Äôll pick a few of you at random and send you some stuff next week! You can find the link to the collection below. üëáüèª #carryon\n\nIn 2018 I was accepted into the art & design department at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and in June of this year I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts concentrating in Graphic Design. The past four years at Cal Poly have been absolutely amazing and not only have I grown as a person but I have learned more than I ever thought possible about being a designer and working in the creative industry. In May I also had the incredible opportunity to start working as a graphic designer for CLSICS, a terrific company based in San Diego, CA. I have now been working & living in San Diego for 6 months and have loved every second of it! CLSICS has treated me like family and I‚Äôve already learned so much from all of my colleagues. I want to say thank you to all of my professors who got me here as well as my amazing friends and family. I would not be here without any of you. I‚Äôm so excited for the future of my career as a designer and am looking forward to this next chapter."
