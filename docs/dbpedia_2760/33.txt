The Finnish refugees in Vilhelmina - To visualize documentary stories with (almost) no documentation

How can I, as a documentary filmmaker, find ways to depict historic events that has none or little documentation in the forms of film, radio or photography?

It started with a press-clipping from 1944 with a few lines about an unknown tragedy in Västerbotten towards the end of World War II. I read in the article that 17 children had died during unclear circumstances. But I later found no footage and very little documentation of this tragedy. I began to think of ways to tell this story despite this. How could I make this tragic story a film that could in a way preserve the memories? In what form? Later I found out that there where in fact 28 children that had died. How was it possible that this tragic event have remained unknown?

Parallell with this process I have written a master´s essay, and when I started building the exposition it felt natural to chose the form of the timeline, for the research and the filmproject "28 barn i Vilhelmina" (working title)

I have also chosen to feature a timeline for the last part of another documentary film, "Det hände i Ingermanland" as this project has similiarities with my current. This comparison is also made in my master thesis.
