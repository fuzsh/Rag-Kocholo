        "text": "Tom Hanks to Present Alan Alda with the 2018 SAG Life Achievement\n\nAward at the 25th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards®\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n55th Annual Accolade to Be Presented on Sunday, January 27\n\nDuring the 25th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards®\n\nSimulcast Live on TNT and TBS\n\nLOS ANGELES (Jan. 8, 2019) – Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Tom Hanks will present the SAG Life Achievement Award to renowned actor, writer, director, producer, and communicator Alan Alda during the 25th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards®, Executive Producer Kathy Connell announced today. Alda accepting SAG-AFTRA’s highest accolade from his co-star in Steven Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies will be a highlight of the SAG Awards® Silver Anniversary ceremony, hosted by Megan Mullally, which will be simulcast live on TNT and TBS on Sunday, Jan. 27, 2019 at 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PT.\n\nBridge of Spies\n\nHanks starred in Bridge of Spies as James Donovan, the lawyer defending KGB agent Rudolf Abel, and Alda co-starred as Thomas Watters, a partner at the same law firm. Bringing their characters’ complex relationship to life reinforced lasting bonds between the two actors. Spielberg’s Cold War thriller, based on a true story, subsequently was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar®.\n\nTom Hanks\n\nIt was 25 years ago that a rapt audience burst into applause and cheers when Tom Hanks accepted the first-ever SAG Award for Male Lead, in recognition of his outstanding performance in Forrest Gump. During his acceptance speech, Hanks proudly held up his Screen Actors Guild card and said, “I got mine for the pilot of Bosom Buddies. My wife [Rita Wilson] got hers for playing a cheerleader on The Brady Bunch. We’ve all got our wonderful stories and our wonderful memories that are connected with this.”\n\nHanks received a second SAG Award the following year as member of the cast of Apollo 13 and has received five additional Actor® nominations. He holds two Best Actor Academy Awards® (Forrest Gump, 1994; Philadelphia, 1993) plus three additional Oscar nominations, as well as four Golden Globes plus five additional nominations. He was most recently seen starring in Spielberg’s 2017 political thriller The Post, which was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. His next on-screen performance will be in Greyhound, a nautical war drama for which Hanks starred, produced and wrote the screenplay (based on the C.S. Forester novel The Good Shepherd). After that, Hanks will be seen as the beloved television icon Mr. (Fred) Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, and he will be heard reprising his role as Woody in the animated Toy Story 4.\n\nMost of Hanks’ work in television is as a producer or executive producer, for which he has seven Emmys® and eight additional nominations; his ninth Emmy nomination was for his guest appearance hosting Saturday Night Live (1975).\n\nHis work has earned Hanks the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Kennedy Center Honor.\n\nTom Hanks is on social media as @tomhanks on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAlan Alda\n\nAlan Alda is one of only six people to receive Oscar, Tony® and Emmy nominations in the same year. His career has earned him induction into the Television Hall of Fame, an Oscar nomination, six Emmys (plus an International Emmy Special Founder's Award and 29 additional Emmy nominations), four SAG Award nominations, six Golden Globes®, four DGA Awards (including the D. W. Griffith Award), the WGA’s Valentine Davis Award, three Tony Award® nominations and more. He also has received the National Academy of Sciences Public Welfare Medal and other honors from the scientific community.\n\nAlda is indelibly linked to his 11 seasons starring as Dr. Hawkeye Pierce on the comedic drama M*A*S*H, which debuted in 1972, during which he became the only person to win acting, directing and writing Emmys for the same series. In 2004, Alda joined Peabody Award recipient The West Wing in his Emmy winning performance as Senator Arnold Vinick. He also hosted the PBS show Alan Alda in Scientific American Frontiers from 1993 to 2005, and has always been in demand to guest star, most recently in Ray Donovan.\n\nOn film, Alda is arguably best known for his Oscar nominated role as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster in 2004’s The Aviator, Bridge of Spies (2015), Tower Heist (2011), Everyone Says I Love You (1996), Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), and Neil Simon’s California Suite (1978). Alda also starred in and wrote The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979), and starred in, wrote and directed A New Life (1988), Sweet Liberty (1986) and The Four Seasons (1981). He will next be seen in the as-yet untitled Noah Baumbach project starring Scarlett Johansen and Adam Driver.\n\nMuch more information about Alda’s extraordinary career and why he was chosen to receive the SAG Life Achievement Award can be found here on the SAG Awards website.\n\nAlan Alda can be found online at AlanAlda.com, Twitter @alanalda, and Facebook /AlanAldaFanPage.\n\nAbout the Life Achievement Award\n\nNominated and voted on by members of the SAG-AFTRA National Honors and Tributes Committee, the Life Achievement Award is bestowed for outstanding achievement in fostering the best ideals of the acting profession.
