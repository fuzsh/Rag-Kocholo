A CBS version, produced by Alda, ran for 13 episodes in 1984.\n\nIn addition to writing The Four Seasons, which has an eight-episode order from Netflix, Fey, Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield are also executive-producing the project, along with David Miner, Eric Gurian and Jeff Richmond. Alda and Marissa Bregman are also on board as producers.\n\nBest of TVLine\n\nStars Who Almost Played Other TV Roles — on Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, Lost, Gilmore Girls, Friends and Other Shows\n\nTV Stars Almost Cast in Other Roles\n\nFall TV Preview: Who's In?
