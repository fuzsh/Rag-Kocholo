        "text": "Filmed entirely on location at Utah State Prison, this is one of the most brutal prison stories ever filmed. A taut, tense trip down nightmare alley and as devastating an experience as one could stomach, making this film one of the most shocking of its genre. In grim and often graphic detail, the film follows the introduction into the system of a new prison guard (Clu Gulager, The Killers. Hunter’s Blood), a man full of high ideals and moral intentions, but totally ill-equipped and unable to contain the corruption and degradation he encounters within. When two new inmates, a college professor (Alan Alda, M*A*S*H, The Four Seasons) and a young teenager become the target for the brutal and sadistic gang leader (Vic Morrow, Combat, Twilight Zone: The Movie), they find nowhere to run and no one to run to. Even the aging Warden (Dean Jagger, I Heard the Owl Call My Name, Game of Death) is bought and paid for by the gang leaders. Their fate is inevitable and terror reigns supreme, it is the law of the jungle, the law of gang rapes, scalding and vicious knifings. Legendary Truman Capote’s (In Cold Blood) The Glass House is a relentless, devastating and above all, a damning portrayal of life and death as it exists in one of America’s toughest prisons. Directed by Hollywood veteran Tom Gries (100 Rifles, Lady Ice, Breakout) and co-starring Billy Dee Williams (The Empire Strikes Back, Hit!), Scott Hylands (Fools, Death Hunt) and Luke Askew (Dune Warriors).
