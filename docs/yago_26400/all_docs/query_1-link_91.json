        "text": "Reading Alan Alda’s new book, one can’t help hearing the words of the late character actor Strother Martin. Playing the prison warden in the Paul Newman film “Cool Hand Luke,” he famously observed: “What we’ve got here is a failure to communicate.”\n\nJust published by Random House, “If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look On My Face?” is Mr. Alda’s attempt to understand why many people have trouble understanding each other—and what can be done about it.\n\nTo some extent, the book grew out of the research and training being conducted at the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science, which he helped to create at Stony Brook University. Since its founding in 2009, the center’s activities have expanded.\n\n“I was beginning to realize that our communication training was useful for more than communicating science, partly because scientists themselves were telling me that it was helping them in their private lives,” he said in an interview last week. “One scientist said, ‘This saved my marriage.’”\n\nIf anything, Mr. Alda pointed out, the current political climate has illustrated and emphasized the need for better communication. “There seems to be more disengagement from one another in politics, more demonizing, and not a little contempt for the other side,” he said. “That certainly seems like a deficit of empathy—and, in my view, empathy is a necessary ingredient for good communication.”\n\nWhile being an experienced author is not a necessary ingredient to writing a book like “If I Understood You,” Mr. Alda does bring that to the table, anyway. He has had two previous best-sellers, “Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: and Other Things I’ve Learned,” in 2005, followed two years later by “Things I Overheard While Talking To Myself.”\n\nOf course, the longtime East End resident—along with his wife, Arlene; the couple celebrated their 60th anniversary in March—is known for more than his author exploits. One of the pleasures of the new book is the recollections of his early days as an actor.\n\n“The insights in the book come from decades of experience on the stage, including improvisation, which I think changed my life,” Mr. Alda said. “As I was writing the book, I realized more than ever how fundamental to good communication those times were—when I learned to relate.”\n\nFrom an early age, he related pretty well with audiences. Born in the Bronx—his father, Robert Alda, was an actor best known for portraying the composer George Gershwin in 1945’s “Rhapsody In Blue”—and having recovered from polio, Mr. Alda served in the U.S. Army, including a post-war tour of Korea.\n\nReturning to the States, he joined several acting troupes, gaining a lot of stage experience. A big break was performing in the musical “The Apple Tree” on Broadway, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award. A break on the small screen was being a cast member of the political comedy series “That Was the Week That Was,” and movie audiences took note of Mr. Alda when he played George Plimpton in the big-screen version of “Paper Lion.”\n\nWhile he continued to star in feature films, including “Same Time, Next Year” and “The Seduction of Joe Tynan,” Mr. Alda became a household name thanks to the success of “M*A*S*H,” the TV series based on the Robert Altman film that ran from 1972 to 1983. When its run ended—the 2.5-hour final installment, which he co-wrote and directed, remains the single most-watched episode of any American network TV series—Mr. Alda turned to writing and directing feature films, beginning with “The Four Seasons.” He also acted in several Woody Allen films, most notably “Crimes and Misdemeanors,” and more recently had supporting roles in “The Aviator,” “Bridge of Spies” and in the TV series “30 Rock.”\n\nSomehow, with such a packed schedule—which has included returns to the stage in “Art” and “Glengarry Glen Ross”—Mr. Alda has been able to pursue a lifelong interest in science.\n\n“I don’t know what inspired my interest in science,” he admitted. “I always wanted to know how things were made and how they got the way they were, and why people behaved the way they did. It’s sort of every child’s version of scientific inquiry. It never left me.”\n\nFrom 1990 to 2007, Mr. Alda was the host of the PBS series “Scientific American Frontiers,” and there is his participation and enthusiasm for projects at the Stony Brook facility. Much of the research for and experiences conveyed in “If I Understood You” are connected to the Center for Communicating Science, as the book’s subtitle indicates: “My Adventures in the Art and Science of Relating and Communicating.”\n\nSome of what Mr. Alda writes about is amusing. An early adventure, titled “It All Began With My Tooth,” is about a non-communicative dentist who performed a procedure that cut out the frenum in his mouth. Like many of us, Mr. Alda did not know what a frenum was until a scene in a movie he was making required him to smile, and he couldn’t do it. True, one result was that he could begin to embrace playing sinister characters—but, today, Mr. Alda said, “I wouldn’t mind having my smile back.” More important, this event was just one example in the book of miscommunication causing confusion and harm.\n\nMuch of the book, though, while populated by witticisms from the author, is the tale of the quests Mr. Alda has been on for decades to find out why people do or don’t understand each other, and to bring the answers he has gleaned to the scientific community, for its benefit but also that of medical patients and various research projects. In that regard, “If I Understood You” and the Stony Brook facility are joined at the hip.\n\n“I just love it that among the 8,000 people we’ve trained to be better communicators, thousands of them are doctors,” Mr. Alda said. “When doctors communicate better, patients are more likely to follow their doctors’ advice. To some extent, we’re helping to save lives.”\n\nAn irony pointed out to Mr. Alda was that one of the book’s sections is titled “The Benefits of Paying Attention,” yet inevitably some people will read his book on handheld devices. One can walk into a Starbucks and see a dozen people communicating with their phones and not each other. Is paying attention more difficult to do with the proliferation of such devices?\n\n“That’s true,” responded Mr. Alda, “but we all still have a little spark of desire to keep track of the emotional life of the person to whom we’re typing messages. That’s why we use smileys and emoji. There is still this vestigial hope that we can keep track of the other person’s inner life and not be misunderstood.”\n\nIn the litany of screen accomplishments above, one film was deliberately left out, to be included last: “Sweet Liberty.” Starring Michael Caine, Michelle Pfeiffer, the legendary Lillian Gish, and Mr. Alda, who wrote and directed it, much of the feature film was shot in Sag Harbor and an advance premiere took place at the Southampton Cinema in May 1986.\n\nIn “If I Understood You,” the author cites organizing the filming of a battle scene in it as an example of the impact of both good and bad communication. Given the relevance of “Sweet Liberty” to both his movie and science careers, would he consider a viewing at a local venue followed by a Q&A? “Sure, why not?” Mr. Alda replied.\n\nAny takers—Bay Street, Guild Hall, anybody? And, no doubt, an added benefit would be copies of Mr. Alda’s insightful and entertaining new book available to patrons."
