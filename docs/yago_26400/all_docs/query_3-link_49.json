        "text": "In 1983, Arlene and Alan Alda released a book featuring photos and behind the scenes details from the final days of M*A*S*H. The book, The Last Days of M*A*S*H, is a must own for M*A*S*H fans. However, the book was not the first book release by Arlene to feature photos from the set of one of Alan’s projects. In 1981, Arlene released the book On Set: A Personal Story in Photographs and Words, which showed the behind the scenes process of filming the movie The Four Seasons. The movie was written by, directed by, and starred in by Alan, and Arlene captured the entire process. The book will feel familiar to M*A*S*H fans as it is in a similar format to The Last Days of M*A*S*H. Let’s take a look at this book and learn more about Alan Alda’s film, The Four Seasons.\n\nThe Four Seasons\n\nOn Set\n\nSince this was the first feature film that Alan had written, starred in, and directed, his wife Arlene decided to use her photography and story telling skills to follow along and document the production of the movie. The filming took place in 1980 in multiple locations including New York, Vermont, Virginia, Georgia, and the Virgin Islands. Arlene followed the production from the initial table reads all the way through the end of the filming. She has behind the scenes photos that show how the film was made, and her written narration tells the story of making a movie in 1980. Since I enjoy the behind the scenes look at M*A*S*H, seeing how a movie was made is very fascinating. In fact, there are several similarities between how The Four Seasons was made and M*A*S*H. Both were single camera, and required the use of a stand-in for Alan since he would also be working behind the camera. Dennis Troy served as Alan’s stand-in in the movie just as he sometimes would on M*A*S*H."
