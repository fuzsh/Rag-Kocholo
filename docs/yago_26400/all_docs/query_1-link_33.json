        "text": "Mamma Mia\n\nWith encouragement from Liz (Tina Fey) and Tracy (Tracy Morgan), Jack (Alec Baldwin) begins a search for his real father. When Tracy introduces his newly discovered illegitimate son to his friends at \"TGS,\" Liz and Pete (Scott Adsit) question the sonâs intentions. Meanwhile, Jenna (Jane Krakowski) and Liz fight for the spotlight when Jenna gets recognition for one of Lizâs ideas. Also stars Jack McBrayer, Keith Powell and Katrina Bowden.\n\n2162 Votes\n\nAt the Democratic Party National Convention, the race to become the presidential nominee has narrowed to three candidates: Russell (recurring guest star Gary Cole), Hoynes (recurring guest star Tim Matheson) and Santos (recurring guest star Jimmy Smits). Also, Bartlet wrestles with the decision to risk national security and launch the secret defense shuttle to rescue the astronauts trapped at the Space Station--or let them die.\n\nKidney Now!\n\nAs Jack (Alec Baldwin) begins to build a relationship with his biological father, MiltonÂ's (Alan Alda) health hangs in the balance. Despite Liz'Âs (Tina Fey) relationship track record, she draws public attention as a relationship expert after a talk show appearance. Meanwhile, Tracy'Âs (Tracy Morgan) high school invites him to speak at graduation and Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) must help him overcome embarrassing memories from his high school experience. Jane Krakowski and Katrina Bowden also star.\n\nIn the Room\n\nAt a Bartlet family birthday, magicians Penn & Teller (themselves) burn the American flag in the White House, prompting a publicity nightmare. Aboard Air Force One, Bartlet is stricken by a paralyzing episode of his multiple sclerosis. And Josh is approached to handle the Vice President's presidential campaign.\n\nThe Mommy Problem\n\nAs a grand jury convenes to investigate the White House military shuttle leak, the campaign's focus changes to national security. Vinick deftly handles the issue while Santos is bound by his party loyalty to align himself with the Bartlet administration."
