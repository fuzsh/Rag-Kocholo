        "text": "At the University of Sayville, North Carolina, history professor Michael Burgess and his literature professor girlfriend, Gretchen Carlsen, finish a friendly fencing match, and Gretchen rejects his suggestion that they move in together. After a failed marriage, she is not eager to keep house with someone new. Michael has written a non-fiction bestseller, Sweet Liberty, a film version of which is being filmed on campus. As he lectures, actor Elliott James steps off the bus, and townspeople ask for autographs. A television reporter interviews director Bo Hodges, who explains he wants to film the revolutionary-era story in the region where the battles took place. Screenwriter Stanley Gould professes his love and admiration for Michael’s book, which he carefully followed to create his screenplay. At the hotel, however, the screenwriter complains his room is cramped and demands a fruit basket from the bellhop. Stanley insists that Michael Burgess read his screenplay and is curious to know what parts Michael thinks are funny. Michael does not recognize the material. There are naked women and men falling off their horses. Michael’s serious book is now a comedy, and he is angry. Stanley pleads with Michael not to confront the director, and proposes they team up to improve the script. Michael reluctantly accepts Stanley’s suggestion. As crew members prepare an outdoor set, Stanley Gould introduces Michael to actor Faith Healy, who has been hired to play a lead character, “Mary Slocum.” In her costume, Faith looks and sounds exactly like Mary, and Michael is charmed. When they find director Bo Hodges, Michael complains that he has distorted the historical record. Hodges responds that he actually saved Michael’s work because it was in limbo when the project was in “turnaround.” The story was altered to appeal to the twelve to twenty-two-year-old demographic that goes to the movies, who, according to Hodges, are interested in three things: defying authority; destroying property; and seeing people with their clothes off. Michael wonders aloud what this has to do with American history. He insists that Bo Hodges concentrate on authenticity, eliminate the make-believe love affair from the script, and improve the dialogue. When Michael points out that his contract gives him the right to consult with the filmmakers, Hodges shakes his hand and notes that they just had a consultation. Later, after Michael makes love to Gretchen in her bedroom, they argue about remaining single, Gretchen’s attempts to ingratiate herself with Michael’s mother, Michael’s attempts to keep the two women apart, his reticence over getting married, and her refusal to live together. Although Michael prefers to visit his mother alone, Gretchen accompanies him, and promises the elderly Mrs. Cecilia Burgess that they will find her long lost boyfriend, Johnny Delvechio. Later, Governor Swayze arrives by helicopter to put in an appearance at a reception for the movie crew. As Michael and Gretchen mingle at the reception, she accuses him of wanting to live together without being willing to become part of her life. She suggests they put their relationship on hold and leaves. Meanwhile, Leslie, the university president’s wife, flirts with actor Elliott James. He lures her into the parked helicopter and takes off. Leslie screams as the craft swoops through the air. Elliott lands the helicopter safely, and party guests applaud as he takes a bow. Later, Michael wakes up Stanley Gould and persuades him to rewrite a scene together. However, Michael does all the writing. On the set, Leslie, the university president’s wife, dressed in period costume, thanks Elliott for her bit part. He asks if she would like to help him learn his lines, and they disappear into his trailer. Michael explains to Faith Healy that he has rewritten a scene to accurately reflect history. He gives Faith the new dialogue, although Hodges asks him not to fraternize with the actors. Michael and Stanley watch from afar as Faith and Elliott insist on playing the scene with new dialogue. Hodges gives in, and Michael observes with great satisfaction as the actors speak his words. Later, at the end of the shooting day, he thanks Faith, and, in character, she invites him to dinner. Michael brings a bag full of salad ingredients to dinner, and confesses that he finds her portrayal of “Mary Slocum” totally authentic. Before they segue into shoptalk, Michael demonstrates smashing a head of lettuce on a cutting board, which separates the core from the rest of the lettuce. Faith asks many questions about her character, and he shows her Mary’s diary. They read the document cover to cover, and kiss as they reenact Mary’s parting with her soldier husband as he goes to war. The next day, Faith demands that Michael be on the set when she shoots her scenes. Stanley cautions Michael that he must also woo Elliott because if Elliott finds out that Faith wants Michael, he will insist that Michael be barred from the set because Elliott did not ask first. Stanley suggests that Michael invite Elliott to fence as a way to win his favor. As they spar, Elliott rips Michael’s shirt several times, and insists on buying Michael a new garment. Later, Gretchen informs Michael his mother is in the hospital with difficulty breathing. There, Mrs. Burgess claims doctors plan to remove her nerves to do experiments. She has also stopped eating because the devil lives in her kitchen. Michael is frustrated because his mother will not let him hire someone to cook for her. She tells him to find Johnny Delvechio and things will sort themselves out. Back on set, Elliott insists that Michael make his character more appealing even if it goes against the historical record. Michael refuses but Stanley persuades him to fence with Elliott some more and do rewrites. At lunch, Gretchen tells Michael she has located Johnny Delvechio through the bricklayer’s union, and persuades Michael to bring him back, while Stanley tags along so that he and Michael can rework the script. At the Delvechio home, Mrs. Delvechio warns Michael to stay away from her husband of forty years. Michael is upset but Gretchen persuades him to lie to his mother about Johnny. At the hospital, Michael tells his mother that Johnny still loves her and thinks about her every day. He cannot visit because he had an accident and is in the hospital, himself. Michael promises he will continue to bring her old boyfriend’s messages but he does not have the authority to have Johnny moved to her hospital room. Michael is grateful for Gretchen’s help and compliments her, but she becomes angry when she arrives to teach Faith Healy embroidery techniques, and the actress uses Michael’s trademark trick to core a head of lettuce. She realizes Michael is having an affair with Faith and leaves. Later, when Michael and Stanley meet with Elliott about script changes, the actor is more interested in diversion since his wife, Grace, has arrived to check up on him. He persuades the writers, Leslie, Gretchen and Grace to go to a nearby carnival, and later teaches his friends a British vaudeville song. However, the clowning around does not improve Michael’s mood. On the set, Bo Hodges refuses to take his criticisms seriously and Michael discovers that Faith is sleeping with Elliott because she claims it improves their scenes together. Meanwhile, Michael is fitted with a Colonial soldier costume as a replacement for some background actors who have dropped out. Soon, Michael argues with Hodges that he is turning an important battle into a farce. As the background actors wait for filming to start, the revolutionary war re-enactors in the group look to Michael for guidance on how to do the scene, and he explains how the real battle was fought. Once filming begins, the Colonials charge the British lines and Hodges watches helplessly. Confusion reigns as Michael pushes Elliott and his horse out of the shot, and directs the scene on the battlefield. After the Colonial soldiers overpower the British, they strip and throw their uniforms in the air, while Michael flashes the “OK” signal to Hodges. Later, as the film company leaves, Stanley tells Michael how much he has learned from him. Soon, Michael apologizes to Bo Hodges for any interference, but the director says the battle scene was shot with six cameras and he can fix anything in the editing room. Faith gives Michael a goodbye kiss and tells him how nice it was to meet him as Gretchen watches. Elliott appears and gives Gretchen a lingering goodbye kiss as Michael watches. After the film company leaves, Michael suggests that he and Gretchen get back together. As they negotiate terms back and forth, they decide on an eight-month trial marriage with an additional four-month option, plus an option to cancel the relationship after a year. Gretchen announces she is ready to go to City Hall and apply for a marriage license. As she teases Michael that the offer will expire in thirty seconds, he runs to her. They hug and kiss. Months later, the actors return to Sayville for the movie premiere. Michael and a very pregnant Gretchen appear radiant as they also attend the event."
