        "text": "“They’ve got nothing but wines I don’t like,” groused Alan Alda good-naturedly.\n\nThe 82-year-old actor, who will be honored with the Screen Actors Guild’s life-achievement award this Sunday, prefers Italian vintages, but we were in a French bistro. Right before our interview, Alda had been temporarily evicted from his co-working space (the elevators were out), so the first few minutes of our conversation were swept up in a flurry of quick hellos and brisk walking. In rapid succession, I watched Alda fend off a few fans, introduce me to an excited canine friend of his named Einstein, and unsuccessfully lobby for a booth. It was too early for lunch and too late for breakfast, so I was dubiously eyeing the coffee menu when Alda announced that he would be having some wine. But he’d mislaid his glasses in the chaos.\n\nSo that was how I ended up reading a wine list to Alan Alda, shortly after noon on a Wednesday—stumbling through circumflex-ridden phrases like “côtes du rhône,” as he winced at either my pronunciation or the mere idea of Médoc. It had been only a few minutes, but I had somehow been folded into Alda’s companionable aura, a role that requires keeping up with both his intellect and his energy, but offers a rich, generous intimacy, too. At one point, he asked if my glasses might work for him, then tried on my Warby Parkers. They didn’t do the trick, which he thought was very funny.\n\nFinally, I got to something he liked the sound of: a Saint-Émilion Bordeaux, which cost more per glass than I typically spend on a bottle. This may be why I decided to have a glass with him. “I’m not a wine talker; I’m a wine drinker,” Alda said, when I asked what he liked about the Bordeaux. It’s the nonsensical tasting notes that get him: “I have never tasted chestnuts in my life!”\n\nIn writing, Alda’s words come off a little blunter than they sound. My transcript of our interview makes his words sound sharp. In person, the actor doesn’t complain—he kvetches. He draws the listener into a state of silliness, where complaining about wine is a joyful thing to do. Blunt, good-humored candor is a charm many of Alda’s characters share—most notably Hawkeye in M*A*S*H, the long-running role for which he won five Emmys. Since then, Alda’s been onstage and in film—he was nominated for an Oscar for his role in The Aviator—but the core of his work is still TV. He’s had arcs on The West Wing, ER, and 30 Rock, and he just finished up another on The Good Fight; for 14 seasons, he hosted Scientific American Frontiers on PBS.\n\nLike Hawkeye, Alda kept up a patter of running commentary throughout our interview, amused by everything happening around him (and waiting for me to laugh along). Unlike Hawkeye, though, Alda doesn’t complain about the really bad stuff—the precarious political state of the world, though it frequently occupies his thoughts, or his Parkinson’s diagnosis, which he went public about last year. The degenerative neurological disorder especially affects movement. When we spoke, tremors occasionally took over his hands, especially when he was trying to keep them still—at one point, he had to hold his phone to his head with both of his hands to stop one from shaking.\n\nAlda was diagnosed several years prior, but kept it private until last year—partly, he told me, so he could continue to work as an actor. “There is a stigma attached to it,” he said. “To this day, people think that if you get a diagnosis of Parkinson’s that your life is over”—despite the work of advocates like Michael J. Fox, who told the public that he had the disease in 1998. Alda eventually opted to open up in order to show others that catching Parkinson’s early and beginning treatment can slow the progression of the disease. “It’s a serious thing, but you have to know that it’s possible to work on it,” Alda said. “You can still have a good life for a long time.”\n\nThe SAG life-achievement award is a special honor among actors, because it’s awarded literally by one’s peers. Shirley Temple and Frank Sinatra have won the award; so have Bob Hope and Sidney Poitier. It’s an honor that recognizes the work actors put in on screens both small and silver; Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Carol Burnett, Betty White, and Angela Lansbury all preceded Alda, too. On Sunday, Tom Hanks—the other nicest man in Hollywood—will present Alda with his statuette.\n\n“It’s hard to describe feelings about it, because it’s such an unusual thing,” Alda said. “It came as a complete surprise.” SAG describes the award as one that honors “career achievement and humanitarian accomplishment,” and though Alda’s not looking forward to the montage of clips from his work—“I hope they don’t include some of my bad acting”—he’s more confident about his philanthropic work, which has come to dominate his day-to-day life.\n\nThat includes the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University, which uses techniques from improvisational theater to train scientists and doctors to more effectively communicate. This is called the Alda Method, and it is trademarked. Also trademarked is the name of Alda’s podcast, Clear+Vivid—which he does partly to demonstrate how effective communication can change minds, and mostly because he thinks it’s really fun. “I love it. I love doing it. It spreads the word about the whole idea of communicating through relating—in every area of life,” he said. Last year, he spoke to a former F.B.I. hostage negotiator. “He says the techniques he uses are very helpful in a marriage,” Alda said, twinkling at me. (It is unlikely Alda needed to use any of them; he has been married for over 60 years to his wife, Arlene. The story they tell is that they met after a rum cake fell on the floor during a party. They were the only two guests who went ahead and ate it anyway.)\n\nIn October 2016, Alda made a guest appearance during the premiere of Oh, Hello, the Broadway show from comedians John Mulaney and Nick Kroll. Mulaney and Kroll aren’t just fans of Alda; they also based the characters they play in Oh, Hello—elderly creeps George St. Geegland and Gil Faizon—on two men they witnessed at the Strand buying individual copies of Alda’s 2006 autobiography, Never Have Your Dog Stuffed. (A close listener will notice that Mulaney’s stand-up delivery owes a debt to Alda’s performance as Hawkeye, too.) When Alda came onstage, Kroll and Mulaney asked if Alda—whose given name is Alphonso Joseph D’Abruzzo—might have a secret buried within his family history. “I think I might be Jewish,” Alda replied. The comedians, without missing a beat, chorus back at him, “Yeah, so does everybody else!”\n\nIt seems fitting that Alda could have this sort of nested identity. M*A*S*H debuted on CBS in 1972, depicting an American military-hospital encampment stationed near the front during the Korean War. Alda’s role on the series changed dramatically as the years went on: his interpretation of Hawkeye steadily inched away from the character presented in the film and original novels, and behind the camera, Alda’s influence over the show grew to encompass writing and directing. For decades, the finale of M*A*S*H was the most-watched broadcast of all time—it had a viewing audience of about 106 million people. The statistics around this episode, “Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen”—written and directed by Alda—are staggering to the modern observer. More than half of all households with a television watched the finale. So many New Yorkers held out on bathroom breaks until right after it ended that the city’s Department of Environmental Protection issued a statement about it: about 1 million residents added an additional 6.7 million gallons of water to the city’s sewers. Some of the episode’s ad sales outperformed the 1983 Super Bowl.\n\n“We were lucky to be able to present human stories—in spite of the fact that it was a comedy—to let in the tragedy and horror of war,” Alda said. “The audience responded to what we did, because while we had wonderful writers and actors, we were all serving something human—not just the commercial end of getting people to watch.”\n\nHe’s not certain a show like M*A*S*H could exist now, though. “We don’t draft people out of their families anymore,” he said. “War is just one of the things that goes on without our noticing.”\n\n“The Vietnam War was fought on television for the first time. The fact that it was the first time meant something. But now, people are blown up by roadside bombs, and we don’t see any video,” he added. “We’re not exposed to what we’re really responsible for. We’re not invited to reflect on it and decide if we really want to do it.”\n\nIt was getting noisier and noisier in the restaurant, which meant that while conversing about conversation, Alda and I were struggling to hear each other. He joked that we were drinking wine instead of eating because the F.D.A. had halted food inspections during the government shutdown, and then he suggested I interview the loud occupants of the table next to us. “They were very interesting, and they’re not even getting the SAG award,” he said, mimicking my future piece. Things kept going wrong: an espresso was delivered to us, but no one had ordered an espresso. Then, another table got upgraded to a booth, even though we had also asked. Alda merrily referred to the usurping booth-sitters as “thieves.”\n\nI asked him how he felt about the current state of the world. “Generally, in the most abstract way, I’d say it’s going to shit,” he responded. “We need better communication more than ever. We’re not going to get anywhere if we demonize the people who don’t agree with us.”\n\n“I think of myself more as realistic than optimistic or pessimistic,” he said. “To be realistic, you have to be sour.”\n\nHe grinned.\n\nAlda grew up hanging out backstage with the showgirls who performed alongside his father, an actor named Robert. His mother, Joan Browne, was a paranoid schizophrenic. In one psychotic state, she tried to stab Robert; Alda was six at the time. “She loved me, even though she let me know many times that she thought I was trying to kill her,” he told me. “She did convince me I could do anything. That might have something to do with this feeling that everything will work out if I apply myself.”\n\n“But I’m also adaptive. If it doesn’t work one way, I’ll try another,” Alda added. “I learned at an early stage in life [that] you either get what you want—or want what you get. I think there’s a Jewish proverb like that, but I invented it. It’s nice that a thousand years ago they quoted me.”\n\nWhen Alda looks back at his career, what stands out most are moments like a scene on M*A*S*H in which he had to laugh and then cry—in the same shot. “I worked hard on that,” he said. The live taping of a presidential debate during the final season of The West Wing was another high point; there, Alda played a Republican senator and presidential hopeful.\n\n“And one that I remember very happily is Louis C.K.’s Horace and Pete,” he continued. “Really, really happy with the whole thing.”\n\nAlda is exceptional on C.K.’s Horace and Pete, which the comedian distributed through his own Web site. The unconventional Web series staged a very theatrical drama around a family-held bar in Brooklyn; the cast included Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco, and Jessica Lange. Alda played an especially horrible old man in the series, and he was very convincing. But since that series debuted, C.K.’s reputation has entered free fall. In November 2017, The New York Times published allegations of sexual misconduct from five women, who all alleged C.K. had masturbated in their presence or while speaking with them on the phone. In a subsequent statement, C.K. admitted his guilt and then apologized. Late last year, C.K. began to stage a comeback via intermittent stand-up sets at the Comedy Cellar in Manhattan. His new material has been controversial, to say the least; according to audio from a set in December, C.K. performed material mocking the victims of the 2018 Parkland mass shooting.\n\n“You have to face the idea that you can still love somebody even though they’ve done something hateful,” Alda said, citing Sarah Silverman’s reaction to C.K.’s downfall. (On her show I Love You, America, Silverman did a monologue about C.K., during which she asked, “Can you love someone who did bad things?”)\n\n“I respect Louie so much as an artist. But he did a terrible thing,” Alda said. “And I hope he finds a way to come to terms with both of those things.”\n\nBut Alda also struggles with what I would call “cancel culture.” (He would certainly not call it that, because despite working out of a co-working space and running a podcast, Alda is not a millennial.) “I think the real question is raised about whether you should wipe out a person’s life’s work because they’ve done bad things,” he said.\n\nWhile starring in M*A*S*H in the 70s, Alda campaigned extensively for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would have put gender-parity language in the Constitution. (“I don’t know if you’re old enough to remember [that],” he said. I’m not.) “Some of the stories were just horrendous,” he said. “A woman lobbying for the Equal Rights Amendment was told by a legislator [that] she’d get his vote if she came to his hotel room and gave him a hand job. That’s how stupid they were.” The 18-word amendment ultimately failed to get the votes it needed to be ratified.\n\nGiven that background, it was no surprise to hear Alda express enthusiasm for the #MeToo movement more broadly. “It’s astoundingly wonderful that women are speaking out more and accusing their molesters. It’s not wonderful that there’s no scale of punishment to fit the crime, as there is with other bad behavior,” Alda said. “There can’t be, because it’s a movement. It’s a stage of a movement, where you have to expect radical behavior.” But eventually, he continued, “I really think the whole question [#MeToo] raises has to be taken up by lawmakers, because it’s—it’s subtle.”\n\nI asked Alda if, with this award coming up, he’s considered what he wants his legacy to be.\n\n“I don’t think about legacy,” he answered. “Acting styles change every generation . . . and what seems like a breakthrough, in reality, or good taste looks really ridiculous a generation later. No one has a lasting legacy, really.”\n\nEven reminiscing about his own history has little interest for Alda. “I don’t want to look back at the past too much. I don’t talk about the past—or the future. I don’t know where I’m going in life; I never do,” he said. “It’s a curious thing: people are really only aware of the past and future of humanity as far back as their grandparents, and as far forward as their grandchildren. Politicians say, ‘I want the world to be better for my grandchildren.’ We can’t conceive beyond that. It’s strange.”\n\nFor Alda, it all comes back to the same thing. “If we keep communicating the way we do now, we’re sunk.”\n\nThe waiter dropped the check on the table, and Alda asked to borrow a pen. When I fished one out of my purse, it came out tangled in hairpins. Something about the way he muttered, “What is this?” sent me into peals of laughter. I left, wine-buzzed, with the feeling that this is part of what he means about communicating better. We had not just talked, during our interview, but also cooperated—located tools, made decisions, and hammered out small, but real compromises. Alda didn’t just sweep me along for the ride; he made it fun. With just a few words and a thoroughly irrepressible sense of humor, Alda makes it possible to be both in on the joke—and the butt of it.\n\n15 Stylish TV Dads\n\n1 / 16"
