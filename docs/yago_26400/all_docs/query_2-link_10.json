The arrival of the film crew seriously disrupts him as actors want to change their characters, directors want to re-stage battles, and he becomes infatuated with Faith who will play the female lead in the movie. At the same time, he is fighting with his crazy mother who thinks the Devil lives in her kitchen, and his girlfriend who is talking about commitment.",

        "text": "Stony Brook is having a virtual Alan Alda film festival this weekend where they showcase a few of my grandpas movies and they honor him and his career. Sweet Liberty was one of the movies they are showcasing so I thought I’d check it because it was one of the only movies of his I hadn’t seen before. My grandpa directs, acts and wrote this movie. He stars alongside Michael Caine, Michelle Pfeiffer, Bob Hoskins and Lillian Gish in one of her final acting roles.\n\nSweet Liberty was one of four movies that he directed. He hated directing because everyone would constantly go to him with their issues and needs for production and he didn’t like that as it felt overwhelming…\n\nThere's an evolution to this movie that I think plays a role in this really not feeling like it is able to reach its true potential. A lot of the earlier parts of this movie feel more like I'm watching a sitcom than a film to me, and I mean that to refer just how the shots feel composed (not a three camera sitcom). It just feels like its limiting itself in some way. And that particularly holds true because I just don't think it does enough with the premise; it doesn't push itself and a lot feels somewhat flat and somewhat rote, particularly the generic way this starts off with relationship troubles.\n\nRoughly halfway through, this starts to really…\n\nAlan Alda's biting satire on the movie business squanders some fantastic high comedy because it wallows in a morass of misguided interpersonal melodrama. Alda plays Michael Burgess, a writer/historian, whose nonfiction book about an event in the American Revolution is being made into a big budget Hollywood movie for the 18-24 male demographic. While this is happening in his sleepy little hamlet in North Carolina, he struggles with his life/life balance with long-term love/sex interest (Lisa Hilboldt) and the increasingly maniacal demands of his paranoid schizophrenic mother (Lillian Gish).\n\nBob Hoskins' hamfisted screenwriter on speed and Michael Caine playing Michael Caine (with, one can only assume, a higher libido) steal every scene. I wanted to offer a recommendation of this…\n\nAfter watching The Fall Guy tonight I fancied another film-within-a-film. Sweet Liberty is one I fondly remember from childhood, renting it from the video shop and watching it on TV whenever it appeared in the schedules, which it did well into the 90s. But weirdly it seems rather forgotten now. It hasn't troubled television in a long time, nor has it been released to Blu-ray either.\n\nWriter/director Alan Alda stars as Michael Burgess, an academic and expert in the American Revolution whose scholarly tome Sweet Liberty has been snapped up by Hollywood, with filming set to begin in his hometown that summer. Unfortunately for Michael, when Hollywood arrives - in the shape of leading man Elliot James (Michael Caine), leading…\n\nOr the only film to co-star Lillian Gish that concludes with a (terrific) Patti LaBelle song and features a climactic scene of fully nude men shaking their rumps at the camera. Sweet Liberty is a movie that I wanted to be much, much better than it actually was. It has a killer cast across the board (Alan Alda, Michelle Pfeiffer, Bob Hoskins, Lillian Gish, Michael Caine, Saul Rubinek, Lois Chiles), and some great barbs on the state of studio filmmaking pandering to horny teenagers in the middle in the 1980s, but Alda, who also wrote and directed, puts himself at the center of almost every scene ... and he is one of the blandest characters in the film. Everybody else…"
