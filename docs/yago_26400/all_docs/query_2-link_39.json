        "text": "Hollywood satires often shred the industry from top to bottom.\n\nThink “The Player,” Robert Altman’s take-no-prisoners assault on Tinsel Town, or the Coen brothers’ nightmarish “Barton Fink.” Even “The Big Picture” took cynical swipes at the industry’s soul-sucking ways.\n\nThe punches thrown in Alan Alda’s 1986 satire “Sweet Liberty,” by comparison, never leave a bruise. It’s not really the point. Alda uses Hollywood as the backdrop for a farcical look at love, indecision and the choices made along the way.\n\nAlda stars as Michael Burgess, a professor who sold his nonfiction book on the American Revolution to Hollywood. He can’t wait to see how big movie stars bring his tome to life. The film’s director (Saul Rubinek) has other ideas.\n\nThe film production ignores the historical record, checking off what we’re told are the critical boxes for a Reagan-era smash:\n\nDefy authority\n\nDestroy property\n\nTake people’s clothes off\n\nToday’s Hollywood bows to fraudulent doctors and governors alike, while mega-stars complain when their beauty is leveraged to spike a scene.\n\nMiss the ’80s yet?\n\nMichael is understandably aghast at the creative liberties with his text. He teams with the film’s hacky screenwriter (Bob Hoskins) to bring some history back to the project.\n\nGood luck.\n\nFAST FACT: “Sweet Liberty” earned $14 million at the U.S. box office in 1986. The comedy now sports a 79 percent “fresh” rating at RottenTomatoes.com.\n\nThe film with a film’s cast isn’t making Michael’s mission any easier.\n\nLeading lady, Faith (Michelle Pfeiffer), will do whatever it takes to nail her part. The dashing Elliott (Michael Caine, oozing movie star charisma) cares more about sleeping with as many women as possible than hitting his marks.\n\nMichael is torn between committing to his long time girlfriend (Lise Hilboldt) and the look Faith shoots him whenever he describes her character.\n\nCan Michael save the film, or will he go Hollywood, too?\n\nRELATED: Alan Alda Cheers Streaming Revolution\n\nAlda’s TV and film career speaks for itself – even without his iconic work on “M*A*S*H*.” His curious ’80s fame, epitomizing the sensitive male ideal, fueled his flirtation with auteur status.\n\nHe started strong with “The Four Seasons” and peaked with “Sweet Liberty.” Lesser projects like “A New Life” and “Betsy’s Wedding” soured Hollywood on his commercial prospects, and he went back to being an actor for hire.\n\n“Sweet Liberty,” finally available on Blu-ray, shows just how good he can be as a triple threat. His Michael hits the usual Alan Alda notes – he’s always losing his temper without a hint of actual malice. Here, he’s given a gentle Lothario streak that makes Michael more compelling, and conflicted.\n\nAlda the director keeps the various story threads alive without sacrificing the film’s humor and wink-wink satire. The comedic beats flow seamlessly from the characters, the slapstick graceful by mainstream comedy standards.\n\nCaine is a hoot, particularly during an early fencing scene against Alda’s Michael. Credit the sound design team for arguably the film’s biggest laugh.\n\nHoskins is over the top without ever being annoying, a near-magical feat. And then there’s screen legend Lillian Gish as Michael’s doddery Mom. She’d be a hardcore Alex Jones fan today given her penchant for conspiracy theories, and her battles with Michael are sweet, hilarious and oddly relatable.\n\n“Sweet Liberty” mocks Hollywood’s vacuous spirit, but there’s an affection for the industry that’s never far off screen. The film indirectly honors the commitment A-listers bring to the gig. Faith’s commitment to her character is so powerful she’s willing to sleep with various men to heighten her screen performance.\n\nShe’s just as hungry to read her character’s diaries.\n\nAlda never stopped working since wrapping “Sweet Liberty,” not even after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in recent years. The film’s Blu-ray edition, free of extras beyond a chatty audio track with film historian/filmmaker Daniel Kremer and film historian/biographer Nat Segaloff, reminds us when he could do no wrong behind the camera."
