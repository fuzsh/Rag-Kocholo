        "text": "Alan Alda really is that cliche \"star of stage and screen.\" He adds playwright to that list with his latest endeavor, Radiance: The Passion of Marie Curie, now at the Geffen Playhouse. Alda, whose screenplays include The Seduction of Joe Tynan and Sweet Liberty, is also a long-time science buff, previously hosting Scientific American Frontiers on PBS, and starring as the physicist Richard Feynman in the play QED on Broadway. He also appears in Universal's Tower Heist, now in theaters.\n\nThese week, Elvis taps into what makes Alan Alda so passionate, from the scientific properties of uranium to the intricacies of human speech. Join them as they test their own hypothesis: the idea that the creation of good dramatic prose and can be a science in and of itself.\n\nBanner image by Larry Hirshowitz"
