        "text": "Alan Alda turns 86 years young on Jan. 28, and for millions of folks, this Big Apple-born thespian will always be Capt. Benjamin Franklin ‘Hawkeye’ Pierce. “M*A*S*H” (1972 – 1983) aired for 11 seasons on CBS, and this beloved comedy series sometimes wandered into categorization-no man’s land because the show frequently dealt with the drama, tragedy, and grief of the Korean War. Meanwhile, Alda could march between gags and heartbreak with the ease of a four-star general ordering a coffee, and yes, he actually served in the U.S. Army Reserves in South Korea during the 1950s.\n\nHe told Terry Gross during a 2019 NPR interview, “I was in the Reserves. I don’t know if you call that being in the military. They put me in charge of a mess hall at one point.”\n\nEarning six Emmy awards - five for “M*A*S*H” and one for “The West Wing” (1999 – 2006) - Alan made a dream career, and although TV is his most prolific vehicle, he’s starred in his share of movies too.\n\nTo help celebrate the man’s 86th trip around the sun – and over 60 years with his wife Arlene – let’s go back and watch about two dozen “M*A*S*H” episodes and these three terrific big-screen performances.\n\nGeorge Plimpton, “Paper Lion” (1968) – “42! Zed! 3! 88! Hut! Hut!” Detroit Lions Quarterback George Plimpton yells his cadence while under center during training camp like he’s a 10-year seasoned veteran. However, once the ball is hiked, his green rookie colors splash on his blue, silver, and white uniform. George has thrown the ball around during two-hand touch games in Central Park with his friends and colleagues, but he’s never actually played college or pro football. In “Paper Lion”, Alda is Plimpton - a real-life journalist - who tries out for the Lions as a quarterback, but he’s really working undercover to write a story. Well, the coaches know George’s true identity, but will they blow his cover? Don’t worry, Alex March’s film – based on Plimpton’s 1966 non-fiction book - isn’t a spy movie but rather a carefree comedy. The 32-year-old Alda – who stands at 6’ 2” and weighs 170 pounds – is built like a marathon runner rather than a muscled man of the gridiron. Still, Alan displays spry athleticism, adolescent joy, and some moments of fiery discourse that will make him a household name as Hawkeye Pierce. Detroit Lions players Alex Karras and Lem Barney and coach Joe Schmidt have supporting roles and offer hijinks, laughs, and mettle that hinder and help George’s indoctrination to the NFL. It’s all in good fun, but then again, no one ever laughed during wind sprints.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster, “The Aviator” (2004) – Wildly successful businessman, film producer, and pilot Howard Hughes faced and overcame countless obstacles thrown in his trailblazing path. Martin Scorsese recounts many of them in this engrossing biopic, and Leonardo DiCaprio stars as the famous, enigmatic personality. If not for Jamie Foxx’s turn as Ray Charles in “Ray” (2004), Leo probably would’ve won his first Oscar 11 years before his 2016 statue. Cate Blanchett won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar with her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn, and Alda earned an Academy Award nomination for his work as U.S. Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster. The Senator from Maine enjoys a friendly relationship with Pan American Airlines, which conflicts with Hughes’ Trans World Airlines. This experienced bureaucrat threatens to embarrass Howard if his demands aren’t met, and he also employs a couple of subtle – but mean-spirited - moves to throw Hughes off his game during a simple lunch. Alda is playing off-type here, but he also started his run as U.S. Sen. Arnold Vinick on “The West Wing” in Dec. 2004, the same month as “The Aviator” release. Admittedly, I’ve never watched “The West Wing”, but I’m curious if Vinick wears Brewster’s gangster-like pinstripe suit.\n\nBert Spitz, “Marriage Story” (2019) – Noah Baumbach ironically named his movie “Marriage Story”. The film squarely focuses on divorce, as Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) wishes to dissolve her marriage to Charlie (Adam Driver). This fierce, biting dramedy rarely gets explosive, except for one signature scene, but the couple’s imperfect-but-amiable bliss painfully shifts into something else. Something distant, clinical, and transactional. Nicole lawyers up with successful, slick super-barrister Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), and out of desperation, Charlie finds her polar opposite: agreeable, aging attorney Bert Spitz (Alda). Bert takes a reasonable, matter-of-fact approach to divorce semantics - in his modest office with wood paneling on the walls - and asks Charlie to face facts rather than fight. This soon-to-be ex-husband may not wish to hear this advice, but Bert – for the audience - is a welcome source of chill comedy. For instance, Bert’s cat randomly roams the hallways. He and his administrator accidentally wear each other’s eyeglasses, and Bert tells Charlie, “You remind me of myself during my second marriage.” How comforting, right?"
