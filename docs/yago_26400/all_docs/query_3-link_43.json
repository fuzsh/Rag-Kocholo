        "text": "TOM PUTNAM: Good evening. I’m Tom Putnam, the Director of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. And on behalf of John Shattuck, CEO of the Kennedy Library Foundation and all of my library colleagues, I welcome you to this very special forum. Let me begin by expressing appreciation to our underwriters including lead sponsor Bank of America, Boston Capital, The Boston Foundation, The Lowell Institute, the Corcoran Jennison Companies, as well as our media sponsors The Boston Globe, WBUR, and NECN.\n\nAlan Alda is one of our country’s finest actors. A five-time Emmy Award winner, he recently had-- [Alan Alda holds up six fingers] [laughter] Six. A six-time Emmy Award winner. He recently--\n\nALAN ALDA: This is a scholarly institution.\n\nPUTNAM: --had the distinction of being nominated for an Oscar, a Tony, and an Emmy Award all in the same year. As if that weren’t enough it turns out that he’s also a delightfully engaging writer. I suppose that should not be surprising for it was the humanity that Mr. Alda infused into his character Hawkeye Pierce during his 11-year run with “MASH” that endeared him to millions of television viewers. I used to watch the show with my father and it served as a bridge-- [laughter]\n\nALDA: 15-yard penalty.\n\nPUTNAM: I didn’t mean--\n\nALDA: Do go on.\n\nPUTNAM: And it served as a bridge between us--\n\nALDA: And this century. [laughter]\n\nPUTNAM: It is true. Providing me with a glimpse of his often unspoken Army experience as a teenager during World War Two. Laughing together in our family room connected us for a moment each week while engaging us in the emerging sensibilities of my times. So in reading Mr. Alda’s book, I was especially appreciative of the stories he recounts of his father, the distinguished actor Robert Alda, one of which provides the title to Mr. Alda’s first book, his memoir, Never Have Your Dog Stuffed and Other Things I’ve Learned. After their pet dog Rhapsody died, his father suggested they bury it together. Yet stricken by the sound of his son sobbing, his father put down his shovel and offered, “Maybe we should have the dog stuffed.” “Stuff the dog?” young Alan replied. Sure enough, six weeks later Rhapsody returned from the taxidermist not only unrecognizable but frighteningly so.\n\nThe experience taught Mr. Alda a lesson, and he writes, “As time went on my memory of the real Rhapsody was replaced by the image of him sitting lifeless on the blue velvet board with a hideous look on his face. The effort to keep him seemed to make him disappear even more. I see now that stuffing your dog is more than what happens when you take a dead body and turn it into a souvenir. It’s also what happens when you hold onto any living moment longer than it wants you to.\n\nALDA: Bravo.\n\nPUTNAM: Mr. Alda’s newest book, Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself, which will be on sale after today’s forum and which Mr. Alda will sign copies of in the Library Pavilion offers us even more life lessons told with both candor and wit, picking up where his first book left off, after a near brush with death which caused him to reflect on how best to live a life of meaning. Imbued in his answer to that question is Mr. Alda’s dedication to his family. And we’re honored to have two of his daughters, Eve and Elizabeth, and their husbands here with us today.\n\nThis new book and his continued success on screen and on stage prove that Alan Alda has not lost his knack of knowing how to touch an audience’s heart. Our moderator this afternoon, Tom Oliphant, comes from another corner of the entertainment industry, journalism.\n\nALDA: He’s really taking a risk tonight, isn’t he?\n\nPUTNAM: A former reporter, editor, and columnist for The Boston Globe, Mr. Oliphant earned a Pulitzer Prize as one of three editors who managed that paper’s coverage of school desegregation in Boston. After retiring from the daily newspaper business in 2005, he wrote his own memoir, this one about his family’s love of the Brooklyn Dodgers. That book has its own allegoric title based on an anecdote during one World Series when first baseman Gil Hodges was in a slump, prompting a priest in Brooklyn to tell his congregation, “It’s too hot for a sermon. Go home. Keep the Commandments. And pray for Gil Hodges.” Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming to the Kennedy Library Alan Alda and Tom Oliphant.\n\nTOM OLIPHANT: You know, among the few cruel things that happen in this building, is that they make me kind of explain how it has to be. And it’s especially tough on an evening like this which has such a huge turnout for very obvious reasons. My job is to make a few lame attempts at profundity for a little while.\n\nALDA: Oh good. I don’t have to then.\n\nOLIPHANT: At which time we will encourage you to go to the two microphones that you may see in the aisle. But the real tough part of this job comes at the end because I suspect they’re going to be long lines. And I hate having to call time but I ask for your forgiveness in advance. So enough ground rules. The honored guest always has the opportunity at these forums to explain himself. To try to encapsulate-- And what’s so interesting is all Mr. Alda is trying to do, in both of these volumes by the way, not just the latest one, is explain the meaning of life. When normally at these forums we’re dealing with the war in Iraq or the economy or who’s going to win the New Hampshire primary, we have an easier topic tonight: the meaning of life. But the first opportunity is if there are ten sound bites or ten pieces of wisdom or a basic message that our honored guest wishes to convey before I attempt to ask my lame questions, please do so.\n\nALDA: Oh, I hadn’t-- I didn’t-- Well, it-- I guess I should say that this book starts off where the last one leaves off.\n\nOLIPHANT: Sure does.\n\nALDA: And that is when I was brought down from this mountaintop in Chile where I was doing the science program that we did for 11 years. And the producer of that show is here and I’m so glad to see him here. A wonderful program. Graham Chedd and his wife Naomi are here. And the program was Scientific American Frontiers. And we did it for 11 years. And right toward the end. Or maybe this was at the end of the 10th year. We were at the last interview of this trip to Chile and we were up on top of a mountain 8,000 feet up and I was interviewing astronomers in this observatory. And I was sitting waiting for the interview, for the final interview. And I got this incredible cramp in my stomach and I didn’t know what it was. And it started to get really bad. And they had a medic there. And he said, “How do you feel?” I said, “Well, I don’t know.” And he didn’t look too secure about the whole thing. I said, “It’s now moved down. I think it’s over here. Maybe it’s my appendix.” And he said, “Yeah, I think so too.” Well, I was really not confident then. And then I couldn’t see straight I was in so much pain. So they carted me down the mountain in this old ambulance that looked like it was one of the ambulances we used on “MASH.” It was that old. And an hour and a half down this bumpy road and I’m screaming and moaning.\n\nAnd Graham was there. And now I was his responsibility. And we were in this little hospital in La Serena, Chile and there was a doctor there who’s on that day, or maybe they called him. And he was an expert in intestinal surgery. And he leaned into my face and he said, “Here’s what’s happened. Some of your intestine has gone bad.” There was about this much of it that was dead. And he said, “We have to cut out the bad part and sew the two good ends together.” And I said, “Oh, you’re going to do an end-to-end anastomosis.” And you should have seen his face when I said that. He said, “How do you know that?” I said, “Oh, I did many of them on “MASH.” Now he used to watch “MASH” when he was in high school. So the two of us came to this evening from a fictional background, you know.\n\nWell, the way the story ended, I lived. And I was so glad to wake up alive. I was euphoric for weeks. And the euphoria subsided, but this unbelievable pleasure at being alive has never gone away. And it was October 19th, which I count as my birthday now. And I feel that I was born in Chile. Because I almost died there. He said, you know, “You could go to Santiago. We could try to get you a plane. But our airport is fogged in and if you wait for the fog to lift you may not make it.” That’s an interesting sentence to hear. So I wanted to get the most juice out of this new life that I had, which was really a gift. It was a surprise.\n\nAnd I wrote the first book then trying to look back over my life and see what made me what I was and how I got to be a person. And I was interested in doing that because I wanted to get more juice out of life. And now that book came out. My life was great. This new life was great. And I had been looking at things I’d said over the years, things I’d said to my children and grandchildren, talks I’d given to young people at commencements, and I was interested in these things. And I was constantly asking these kids to think about values and meaning in their lives.\n\nSo this is where this book came from. In the middle of the night I hear a voice from the back of my head. It’s me, you know, it’s just me. And it’s saying, “So have you lived the life of meaning?” And I said, “What, are you kidding? Look at the life I have. Look at how happy I am.” And the voice said, “No, really. If you don’t wake up tomorrow will this have been a life of meaning?” And I spent the next year, year and a half, really trying to figure out what to me would be a life of meaning. What would help me get to the end and feel I hadn’t wasted my time? So that’s the background for the book. Now you can make that profound if you want.\n\nOLIPHANT: I could try. The very first thing that occurred to me is something that you never quite answer directly in the first one or in the second one. And that was whether this traumatic event is the trigger and whether you would as a public person have been stimulated to this amount of introspection had this not happened to you?\n\nALDA: You know, if it hadn’t happened I wouldn’t have written about a 20 page piece that I thought was an article about the event in Chile. It was such a powerful experience. And that became one of the final chapters in the book. My friend Chuck Grodin, the actor, who has written a number of books, sent it to his editor at Random House who asked me if I wanted to write a book. I thought it was just an article which nobody wanted to print. And I said, you know, I wouldn’t want to write a celebrity memoir. I don’t want to write about the jobs I’ve had. I didn’t want to write an illustrated resume. I wanted to write something that meant something to me. So it became that. But the thing is, once I started writing, the process of writing forced me to be so introspective.\n\nOLIPHANT: Was it easy or hard?\n\nALDA: I don’t think it was hard. The only hard part was normal writing puzzles like structuring it. Going in. You know, that’s hard for anybody. But I love that. I love solving those problems.\n\nOLIPHANT: Well, you know, it’s funny the odd things that happened to us but a lot of us who were deeply touched by this one and fascinated by the second one are very jealous of one thing you could do during this ordeal just before you were operated on.\n\nAnd that was to write a few words to your family not knowing what the outcome of the surgery would be.\n\nALDA: Well, it came upon me suddenly so I didn’t just pass out and not know it was coming, nor did I have the other side of it of looking forward to a sure death or a certain death which some people with certain kinds of cancer have. I have a friend who’s going through that now. But I knew I might not wake up from the operation or at least I thought I might not. So I said to Graham-- I wasn’t scared. That amazed me. I wasn’t frightened. I said I want to say something to my wife Arlene and my children and grandchildren. So Graham said, “Oh, well, I’ll get a pencil.” So he was business-like about it too. But I know he had all this in his head. He was trying to make decisions about my life. So I said a few things, very pedestrian things. Like, I love you. But that turns out to be what people say when that’s all they have. What else are you going to say? That’s the most important thing to say.\n\nOLIPHANT: You also, though, expressed-- I guess the word I’d say is a certain confidence.\n\nALDA: A confidence-- I know you’ll take care of the family, I said, yeah. And when my daughter Elizabeth who’s here, when she heard I had written some last words she said, “What are they? What did you say? Maybe you left everything to me?” Wrong. Yeah, we couldn’t get the paper for a while. Then Graham retrieved it and emailed it to us and we found out-- Nothing for you, no. [laughter] We’ll see how you do today, you know.\n\nOLIPHANT: So then you went on this-- I don’t know if journey of self discovery is a profound observation or a pedestrian one. But the way it touched people was driven home to me this morning in the airport when I ran into an old pal. She’s known to anyone who works here as a cancer survivor, about three years in. And she devoured the first one because she’s a politician, used her connections to get an advanced copy of the second one. And there were two things she said I wanted to offer to you for comment. One was your use of wit. Not simply to be funny but to kind of gently ease us into a discussion of pretty heavy subjects, which she appreciated. And the example she cited is from the book that’s just out. A plaque somebody gave you once with an inscription written on it asking one of the most profound questions humans have to deal with but phrased neatly, to wit, “What if the hokey pokey is really what it’s all about?” And we were chatting before we parted. And based on our reading, mine at least, to a certain extent you answer yes, don’t you?\n\nALDA: That’s right. Yes, that’s probably true, yeah.\n\nOLIPHANT: Explain.\n\nALDA: Well, it’s like-- Well, no, that’s too long and boring. I won’t go that way. It’s funny. I’ll tell you what interests me, is that Marcus Aurelius, the emperor-writer, who was a wonderful writer, 2000 years ago said, “All we have is now.” And I was interested in that because that’s almost exactly what brain scientists had told us when we were doing “Scientific American Frontiers.” One scientist said, “In the brain, now only lasts about five seconds. Electrically and chemically, the state of now. Everything else is either memory of something that just happened or longer ago, or it’s thinking about the future. And that five seconds of now, of course, keeps moving. But if you’re not aware of it when it’s happening you’re just remembering it. And it’s not the same. It’s like the stuffed dog.\n\nOLIPHANT: Meaning you alter it the minute you try to--\n\nALDA: And that’s another thing that a memory-- Gage was it? Pardon? [inaudible comment from audience] This other guy who’s name I think is Gage said in California-- What was it you just said? Wait a minute, wait a minute. He said something like what you just said. You’re not Gage are you? [laughter]\n\nOLIPHANT: No, but my problem is I survived an aneurism blowing up in my head so I always have an excuse for forgetting, myself.\n\nALDA: No, and I want to talk to you about that, too. Well, this had to do with memory. See, but I forget what it was. But it’ll come back. But I’d really like to know if you went- I don’t mean to interrupt your flow of questions. And if you don’t mind my--\n\nOLIPHANT: My friend and I were talking about something. The whole idea of these books, I think, is to help the rest of us think through our own lives, right? That’s the great value.\n\nALDA: You know, the main reason for the books is so I get a chance to write. I love writing. So I wrote about something powerful to me and tried to put things into words that you can’t put into words. So that was the fun for me. And in the process I allowed myself, just so I could have the fun of writing, to actually tackle these ridiculously difficult questions.\n\nOLIPHANT: Yes, but you do tackle them. And that makes us try too. And one of the things that I was really struck by is how often you return in one form or another to some kind of description of now, of a moment.\n\nALDA: Oh, it’s the dancing thing you were doing, with the hokey pokey.\n\nOLIPHANT: Yes, right. And that you don’t seem to be afraid at all of saying that the experience of a particular moment is perfectly fine if you want to define that as basically as what it’s all about.\n\nALDA: Well, it gives me personally-- All I can do is report on my own experience. It gives me personally a sense of life. I experience the life. And somebody asked me to give them examples of the five second thing just this morning. And I never said this before\n\nthis morning. And it occurred to me that it’s really true. She said, “What do you mean about the five second thing?” I said, “Okay, if I’m driving in the car with my wife and she says something and I don’t answer her within five seconds, it’s not so good. Because if I wait five seconds and I’m half thinking about something else, and then it finally rises to my consciousness that she’s asked me something or said something, and then I respond to it, I’m responding to a memory of my wife. I’m not responding-- Because it’s more than five seconds. It’s in the past. It’s a memory.\n\nOLIPHANT: But you underline the significance of those five seconds in a way that seems to me almost to elevate their significance above almost everything else.\n\nALDA: You know what it is--\n\nOLIPHANT: The dog example to me really works in terms of how you seem be-- I mean, Putnam’s already told a story about Rhapsody and stuffing Rhapsody.\n\nALDA: Yeah, that’s good, because I was going to get a lot of laughs with that.\n\nOLIPHANT: Stuffing the dog did not exactly do it for you.\n\nALDA: Yes.\n\nOLIPHANT: Though you do include in the first book a photograph.\n\nALDA: Well, that happened for the paperback. Somebody came up to me while I was signing the hard cover and said, “I have something for you.” And showed me a picture of my dog when the dog was alive, not stuffed. And with my father. And I realized in that moment for sure that I had forgotten what the dog really looked like. All I could remember was this stuffed thing, this object. And this was a picture of this beautiful animal with silky hair and big beautiful eyes.\n\nOLIPHANT: It was alive.\n\nALDA: It was a puppy. He was alive.\n\nOLIPHANT: Yeah, right. But there’s another dog that interested me, reading you.\n\nALDA: What?\n\nOLIPHANT: And that’s Bosco, right?\n\nALDA: Ah, yeah, Bosco.\n\nOLIPHANT: Your sister’s dog. Okay, now at this point in the book this could be a whole lot like a doctoral dissertation, all this use of dogs in memoirs. But listen how he handles Bosco. And he’s dealing with the way Bosco looks when he scratches his stomach, okay. He has a soft belly that I guess from time to time you rub. And he’s talking about, quote, the dreamy look in his eyes when you scratch his belly. Now listen. “This is the meaning of life. Both for me and for him.” And I think you really mean that.\n\nALDA: Well, I do. That moment that I have when Bosco rests in my arm and I scratch his belly and he gets that look. And I think I’m happy, he’s happy, I’m making contact with him. We can’t speak the same language. He smells things. I can’t smell. I know things that he probably doesn’t know and vice versa. And yet we make contact and I can’t think of anything more meaningful than that. You know, no matter how many statues they gave me for things I did. You know, like acting and things which happened to be six. [laughter]\n\nOLIPHANT: That sounds like a mistake I would make, not Putnam.\n\nALDA: No matter how many they give me, I don’t think when I’m dying I’m going to say, “Well, I’m going to die now but at least I got those statues.” I think my mind will go to a moment, if not with Bosco, some other moment of contact when I was really there and the other person was really there. It may not give meaning but it eliminates a little bit the need to wonder about the meaning.\n\nOLIPHANT: Well, you sort of doubt-- I mean, the temptation in reading, especially the one that’s just out, is to see you-- to use a 1960s expression-- to see you finally elevating the personal above the political.\n\nALDA: Yeah, yeah.\n\nOLIPHANT: And that it is the micro experiences that we have that in significance dwarf the things that happen, what out there or-- You believe that?\n\nALDA: Well, I noticed that’s the way my life has gone. I used to be very-- I used to be out in the street picketing when I was in my 20s and 30s and my 40s. I called myself an activist and I was pretty active. And I don’t anymore. I won’t talk about politics in public even though I have very strong feelings. Now I spend my time writing and acting.\n\nOLIPHANT: But I wonder if in that decision there isn’t implied a judgment about activism itself and its ultimate uses. I mean, I had to make notes just at various sections of the books because it’s not all in once place. But nuclear disarmament, at least in the 1950s, those of us who are political junkies remember how vocal and out front you were when that wonderful hopeless cause called the Equal Rights Amendment was out there in the 1970s. But I noticed in your writing about your political activism a definite ambivalence.\n\nALDA: Well, I came to think that much of what I personally did was …(inaudible) in the street. And I call it that in the book. And I contrasted that with the day I met Martin Luther King. And I saw that fire in his eyes. I’ve seen that look in eyes among people whose lives are on the line. Some police officers, football players who can go out and get seriously hurt on a Sunday afternoon. I’ve seen that same look. There was a concentration and a focus. He could see through you, and yet, in a way, he wasn’t looking at you. He was looking into the distance. I don’t mean that metaphorically. I mean literally he didn’t seem to be looking at you so much as through you. And his mind was always on what he was focused on. And he could really move people. And we would stand in the street or walk in circles. One night we picketed in Times Square in the snow.\n\nOLIPHANT: What was the cause?\n\nALDA: It was to end nuclear testing and this was in the 1960s. And I helped organize all these theater actors on Broadway. And we went out and marched around in a circle in Times Square. The snow was falling. No one was there but us. It was midnight. We had invited the press naively. The press was home having a scotch. And then the next day not even our footprints in the snow were left. Everything was gone. You know, we were making ourselves feel better. I think there’s a very important distinction to be made between making yourself feel better and getting something done. And I don’t know exactly what the difference is in how you go about it or how it happens. But I felt I was wasting some energy. Some of the stuff that I helped take part in with the Equal Rights Amendment actually did change things.\n\nOLIPHANT: Yeah.\n\nALDA: And I don’t mean that I changed things, but I took part in that effort and I helped present arguments and that kind of thing. And people who didn’t at that time think it was reasonable that women should get equal pay, and shouldn’t be in public office and be running companies because they had to be home taking care of the babies. You know, they thought that was the reasonable thing. They now take it for granted that women should be equal to men in every way. And even though there’s still plenty of distance to go the people who resisted it are now taking it for granted. That’s very interesting. But I don’t think that was accomplished by walking in circles in the snow. There was another process at work.\n\nOLIPHANT: No, but to use another analogy, you get to-- And anybody who loved the first one is going to really love the second.\n\nALDA: Thank you.\n\nOLIPHANT: But one of the things that I found really challenging was understanding your affection for this physicist. How do you pronounce his name?\n\nALDA: Feynman.\n\nOLIPHANT: Feynman.\n\nALDA: Richard Feynman. You must know Richard.\n\nOLIPHANT: Explain a little.\n\nALDA: Okay, Richard Feynman was one of the great American physicists. He just died in his early 70s about 20 years ago, roughly 20 years ago. And he was considered to be maybe second to Einstein in his brilliance. And he didn’t leave behind a formula the way Einstein did, e=mc2. He left behind drawings that explained-- One of the major things. He also left behind great lectures that made quantum mechanics understandable to other physicists, young physicists coming up. And these drawings showed what was happening to particles as they collided at this submicroscopic level. And through the drawings physicists could understand things that they could only get mathematically. He helped them visualize them. And many physicists have said that only through the drawings were they able to move on in their work. I mean it was an amazing thing. Plus he helped build the atomic bomb. He was a safe cracker--\n\nOLIPHANT: Is that a good thing?\n\nALDA: No. This is how smart he was. In fact, he got very depressed from having built the atomic bomb and did something that I, in a way, wanted to pattern my life after. He decided in a terrible depression when he was teaching a couple of years after Los Alamos that-- He got interested in a plate spinning in the cafeteria. Somebody was tossing a plate up. And he saw that the spin and the wobble of the plate as it spun had some kind of relationship. And he figured it out mathematically. And he took this to Hans Bethe, his mentor, and he said, “Look at this. Look at what I’m figuring out.” And Bethe said, “Yeah, but what’s the significance of this?” And Feynman said, “It has no significance. It’s fun.” And from that moment on he dedicated himself only to figuring out things that were fun. And in fact, he claimed that looking at that plate, figuring out the plate, led eventually step by step to the work that won him the Nobel Prize.\n\nOLIPHANT: But you almost suggest, not only in writing about him, but in writing about yourself, that both the challenge and the joy of examining this one specific thing, like the plate, or like enjoying the look on Bosco’s face, has it’s own intrinsic merit.\n\nALDA: This is all part of this thing about now. It’s the now and the detail. And details make-- Just as details in a novel or a play make it vivid to us and make us know that this happened, whether it happened in the imagination or in life, it seems believable. And whatever it means hits us stronger, more strongly, because of the detail. And just as if I’m actually hearing you now and letting you into my mind during these five seconds the details of what you’re saying, the tone of your voice, all of these things, that nice bowtie you’re wearing, all of this stuff is part of what I’m getting. And those details make me know I’m alive. So I don’t care about meaning after that.\n\nOLIPHANT: That’s right. But for example, you make at least briefly the distinction between this genius-- You did a play about him.\n\nALDA: I did. I played Feynman on Broadway and it was a great time.\n\nOLIPHANT: And we never quite get to the answer to the ultimate question that explains the universe. But you write that you can understand one photon and that’s enough.\n\nALDA: Yeah, well, if you can understand one photon. I wonder if anybody really does.\n\nOLIPHANT: Never tried myself.\n\nALDA: You know, the wonderful thing about quantum mechanics is that it’s a description of nature that is completely unreasonable to us. I mean the idea that something can be in two places at the same time. When my daughters were small, when they were six years old, I taught them the first rule of logic which I loved. I thought this had saved my life, this idea, the rule of identity. That a thing cannot both be and not be at the same time and in the same respect. If you look at from a different angle it could be different. But quantum mechanics says that a particle can be here and miles away, even at the other end of the universe, and they could be entangled. And what you do to one, it happens to the other. It’s almost like the thing can be in two places at once. Now, but that doesn’t make sense to us.\n\nOLIPHANT: No, but the effort of trying to make sense-- And it gets me to a two-parter here that I think helps understand this journey that you’ve taken and now shared with us. And that is whether-- You know, there’s an old argument. Is the journey more important than the destination? Is the effort more important than the result? And in looking back on life and on your life, you seem to me to be making the case that it’s the journey.\n\nALDA: How does “MASH” look?\n\nOLIPHANT: Yeah. I mean, you write about it almost as if it’s over.\n\nALDA: Well, yeah, for me it is because-- It is almost for me personally as if it happened to somebody else. When I’m triggered to remember it by something, somebody says something or I make an association, I can remember it in vivid detail. The same way I can remember in the wings watching my father when I was two years old. I remember those strippers and chorus girls.\n\nOLIPHANT: What was it about them that you remember?\n\nALDA: It wasn’t anything about their clothes, I’ll tell you that.\n\nOLIPHANT: Thanks for the memory.\n\nALDA: But I’m proud of what we did on “MASH.” As we were making it we would say, “What is this? We can’t do that again.” There was an episode early on where we were making fun of the Frank Burns character. And we painted a jeep with gold paint. And as we were doing the scene Wayne Rogers and I looked at each other and said, “Where did they get gold paint during the Korean War? Where did this come from?” I mean, it came from the prop department for us but where did it come from for them? So every time we got to something on the show, a scene that seemed totally incredible, we would say this is a gold jeep. What can we do about this? But there’s a vast part of it, kind of a middle layer of the shows that were really good shows. And then there’s a layer on top where we told stories in ways that we had never told, pretty much nobody had ever told stories like that before. And I really cherished those. But I never see it. I don’t look at it. You know, it’s played all the time.\n\nOLIPHANT: Jesus, I do.\n\nALDA: Yeah. People come up and tell me, “I’ve seen it so many times. I know every word.” I say, “Well, that’s more than I knew when I did it.” I mean, I always had trouble learning my lines. Now I use the iPod method and I learn my lines.\n\nOLIPHANT: You should tell, by the way, the anecdote of how often in the case in celebrity-- When people come up to you they reverse the compliment.\n\nALDA: Yeah, it’s very common. This is very interesting. And everybody I know who is well known has had this happen. They’ll come up to me and they will say to me, “You’re my biggest fan.” Isn’t that interesting? I told the psychiatrists this because I knew they’d love a slip, you know. And it’s hard to know-- Why does this happen over and over? Why that same slip? It’s very interesting. I don’t know, I went blank now. You know, it’s funny, every time-- When I started to treasure my new current life, and I thought I must take advantage of every single second, it turned out that, because I love oatmeal so much--\n\nOLIPHANT: Me too.\n\nALDA: Oh, we must talk about that. I would make it every day. But I make it the hard way. It takes 40 minutes with this Irish steel cut stuff. So you know, and then they’re good. Don’t you love it?\n\nOLIPHANT: Oh yeah.\n\nALDA: So I realized I could save a lot of time if I’d make a big vat of it on Monday and then zap it in the microwave, just a bowlful every day. And it took about three minutes to microwave it. So one day, you know, loving-- And just being in the now and recognizing every minute I’m alive, I’m taking the thing out of the microwave and I realize I didn’t know what had happened for the past three minutes. I had completely blanked out on 180 seconds of my life. And I got very guilty. And then I thought, don’t be crazy. What, are you supposed to worry about every second?. You know, because like in the morning I put one sock on, then I put the other sock on, then I put one shoe on-- I thought, “What if I put one sock and then put the shoe on right away before I went over to the other foot? Maybe I’d save a couple of seconds?” I could read War and Peace again. I’d be a much better person.\n\nOLIPHANT: Now it’s sounding like “MASH” isn’t it?\n\nALDA: Well, I tried it. I did it. I timed it out. For about 15 minutes that day I was putting on my shoes and socks. The old way, the new way, the old way-- I saved 10 seconds the new way. But I decided not to--\n\nOLIPHANT: And what did you do with them?\n\nALDA: I went back to the old way because I felt if I changed the way I put on my shoes and socks it would be unnecessarily crazy. [laughter] And so I decided that if I was going to blank out for a few seconds I would just call it something different. I call it a vacation.\n\nAnd I’m taking these little vacations more and more frequently.\n\nOLIPHANT: Tell me about it. You know, my father tried to deal with this problem during the period when he rode the elevator down in our building in the morning.\n\nALDA: Oh, you mean how to use the time?\n\nOLIPHANT: Yeah. It’s like the three minutes where you’re waiting for the oatmeal.\n\nALDA: No, no, I wasn’t just waiting. I didn’t know what happened to them.\n\nOLIPHANT: His wife, my late mother, Norwegian, attacked it as a problem to be solved. And so what she did, she went to Bartlett’s quotations, got a stack of 3x5 cards and put quotes--\n\nALDA: In the elevator?\n\nOLIPHANT: Yeah, so when he went in the elevator, or while he was waiting for the elevator, he could read a quote by Dostoevsky.\n\nALDA: Would she put them in his pocket?\n\nOLIPHANT: Oh yeah. It was in his overcoat pocket.\n\nALDA: Well, that’s good because it gave them both something to do.\n\nOLIPHANT: Exactly, right.\n\nALDA: And this was meaningful, right?\n\nOLIPHANT: There’s one other cultural question.\n\nALDA: Yeah, I have to pull up my sock.\n\nOLIPHANT: While you pull up your socks. While I encourage folks to line up at the microphones if you have questions, comments. But no harangues please. Because there’s so many of you.\n\nALDA: Well, while they’re lining up I’ll just read a little.\n\nOLIPHANT: While I ask a very dated question.\n\nALDA: This is so good.\n\nOLIPHANT: It is actually. It is. “MASH” the movie and the show come out of a period that I guess was slightly preceded by Heller and Catch-22 and all the rest of it. And it almost foreshadows today where humor is maybe our most reliable source of television news.\n\nALDA: The news, yeah.\n\nOLIPHANT: But I never heard anybody say that Catch-22 or “MASH” the movie or “MASH” the show were, like, wrong. That they were honest. And yet they offered a view of order and discipline in the military at a time of cultural change in America that was humorously dissenting in a way. Did you have a consciousness of the fact that you were really questioning authority by doing this thing?\n\nALDA: Well, yeah, it was a service comedy in that regard. And so was Catch-22, I think. There was the-- Especially in Catch-22 where there was the very notion that there’s a catch. You know, they’ll treat you fairly, but there’s a catch. And it’s catch-22. And in our thing we were always making fun of the brass. That’s a tradition that goes back as long as there’s-- Eating goober peas. Goodness, how delicious, eating goober peas! It’s a civil war. They’re making fun of the general. And Bob Hope would always take the side of the enlisted man against the officers. And they all enjoyed it because it was-- As you say, it was kind of poking gentle fun but everybody got the idea. It wasn’t anarchic, though, I think you’re right about that.\n\nOLIPHANT: Nor was it antiwar. And yet it helped a great many people learn better how to question authority. Right?\n\nALDA: Well, I don’t know. Maybe you’re right. I never thought of that. I’ll have to think about that. Maybe I’ll write about that.\n\nOLIPHANT: Volume three. This program now belongs to you. So you can really spice it up during these 30 minutes. So please, as to the point as you can. Not short, just to the point. Welcome. Thank you.\n\nELLEN KEIG(?): Thank you. My name’s Ellen Keig(?). First of all I just have to say it’s great being here with you guys. I mean, really, really great. I’m a breast cancer survivor, three years. And obviously it was very traumatic. But what I found, like you, is living in the now is very important. But more than that is the joy, the simple joy-- And I find many, many people don’t have that. And I’m wondering if both of you, because both of you have had these very traumatic events like me-- I enjoy the process of living. I call it like the process of living, the details of living, not just the now, but the …(inaudible).\n\nALDA: So let me ask you, do you think it’s possible to enjoy it that much without nearly dying?\n\nKEIG: I do. Because I did before actually. Before this happened to me I always loved life. But now I am so aware.\n\nALDA: See that’s the same thing for me. I was crazy about being alive. I loved it. And I had an appetite for life. But now it’s increased. So we can’t keep taking everybody out and shooting them.\n\nKEIG: But I don’t understand-- But guys--\n\nOLIPHANT: Is there some better way to get all this insight?\n\nKEIG: I don’t understand why most people-- Many people. I won’t say most, because that’s not right. But I find so many people, doesn’t matter how old they are, they could be 25, they can be 60, they do not enjoy life. I mean they really don’t enjoy the little things in life.\n\nOLIPHANT: You mean not even a minimal amount.\n\nKEIG: They really don’t.\n\nALDA: I was just reading about happiness on the airplane yesterday. And they’re now doing studies about happiness. And they talk about a set point about happiness. It’s sort of something you come in with as part of your constitution. And some people are just this happy and some people are this happy. And if you give them-- If they win the lottery-- If they’re down here and they win 100 million dollars, they come up here for a while and after six months they’re back down to their set point. It’s like Weight Watchers.\n\nOLIPHANT: Before I call on the next one you used one little phrase I wanted to ask you to rethink. You kept saying the little things in life.\n\nKEIG: Oh, they’re the big things. Oh, they’re the big things! I say that in quotes. I say that in quotes. They are the big things. Thank you.\n\nOLIPHANT: Let’s switch sides. Thank you, sir.\n\nALDA: Oh, switching sides. Is this the Republican?\n\nOLIPHANT: To the right. That’s right. This is a banker--\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: To the right but coming from the left.\n\nOLIPHANT: Go ahead.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: And like Mr. Putnam I too watched “MASH” over and over again with my father who I’m delighted is here with me. It was a real treat. But there was something very special about it from a political standpoint. And that was that it did help people like me say questioning authority, being antiwar was okay. So I’m a little bit curious, somewhat questioning your commitment or lack of commitment to the political at this point. And whether you think there is really a way in which the micro and macro, as Mr. Oliphant put it, can be combined?\n\nALDA: You know, the political-- In terms of actually trying to be political, going out, and because I’m well known, getting on television and saying-- I get asked a lot to go talk and express an opinion or to write a blog about it or something like that.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Please don’t.\n\nALDA: I just don’t want to do it. I have something to offer in my chosen professions. And that’s how I want to do it. I have strong opinions and I talk to my friends and I try to puzzle things out. But I don’t want to be-- I was asked actually to run for the Senate.\n\nOLIPHANT: New Jersey, right?\n\nALDA: Of New Jersey, yeah, for the US Senate. [Audience applause] Are they applauding New Jersey?\n\nOLIPHANT: No, I think they’re probably lamenting--\n\nALDA: The Jersey boy!\n\nOLIPHANT: They’re probably lamenting the Torricelli period.\n\nALDA: No, it wasn’t Torricelli. It was-- Sorry, can’t say his name right now.\n\nOLIPHANT: Lautenberg.\n\nALDA: Yeah, Lautenberg. It was the seat that he eventually ran for. And I said to these guys, “No, I don’t want to run. I don’t want to be a politician. I don’t want to do it. I’m an actor and a writer. That’s what I want to do. I’d have to stop that to do that.” I said, “I’m not qualified.” And they said, “Yeah, but you could win.” And now whenever Lautenberg sees me he says, “Thanks.”\n\nOLIPHANT: Yeah, I’ll bet he does. Do you get his point?\n\nALDA: I don’t know, do I get it?\n\nOLIPHANT: You want him on a picket line somewhere.\n\nALDA: Is that it?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh no, no, no. I think what I want-- I think his celebrity doesn’t preclude him from being involved in politics.\n\nALDA: No it doesn’t. It doesn’t.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: And for example, I suspect we won’t see an event like we had with Oprah Winfrey posting 1,500 of her closest friends for Barack Obama.\n\nALDA: No.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: But you’ve spoke out in the past on issues of great importance, on a national and international level. And my hope is that your voice will continue to speak out.\n\nALDA: Well, thank you. But I did give it ….(inaudible).\n\nOLIPHANT: But on the other hand, I guess the other counter is that speaking out on the most central questions of life is a hell of a contribution to the public square.\n\nALDA: Well, that’s what I’m trying to do anyway. I’m trying to offer what I think I have to offer.\n\nOLIPHANT: Ma’am, thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: In the first book you wrote about when you were beginning to film “MASH,” the very first episode, and how you were sitting there thinking about how you had nothing in common with the character and how were you ever going to go out there and act that role with the dissimilarity? But as Mr. Oliphant said he and his friend were speaking this morning, I believe he said it was, that something you bring to your writing is your sense of a wit and how you really tie that in to asking the serious questions and evaluating serious issues in life. And I think that’s something that you and your character did bring to “MASH”-- combining that element of wit with the serious issues. I think that’s why there’s probably a small group of people like myself who fell in love with the show and your character when it was in syndication when we were in our toggling years. And now show up at events like this. So I wonder as you continued over the next years in “MASH” if you found more similarities between your personal self and the role that you were acting? And if so, if you found it to be because of your own influence on the character or sort of the character’s influence on you?\n\nALDA: You know, there’s a myth on the Internet that I took over the show and was running it or dictating what was happening. In fact, some people say that it became more political when I got powerful and ran the show. I never ran the show. It was always run by the producers. It didn’t get more political. It got less political over the years. Larry Gelbart wrote a lot of political satire when he was writing in the first four years and after that the stories got more human centered. You know, the relationship centered. And if you look at the shows that my name is on, they’re not political. There’s one that I got the Emmy for writing that touches on feminism. But I hope it’s not propagandistic. I hate propaganda. I would never want to write something that tells people how to think or how to vote. I think propaganda is the enemy of art. And I’m interested in trying to learn how to be an artist.\n\nSo I’m just picking up on what you said about do I have more to say about the character. I only ever tried to take the material that came to me, or that I wrote about 20 or 25 episodes, and I tried to learn more about the character when I wrote those. But not change the character. But I didn’t really know how I could be that guy. It’s what I was talking about before, about playing something that scares me. I understood the outside of the character. I could have pretended to be the character. But to try to internalize that and believe with the magic gift, to say if I were that person how would I be that person? What is there in me that I can draw on so I can convincingly be him and not look like I’m pretending?\n\nThat was the challenge. I didn’t know what to relate it to. And I just eventually just dove in and did it. And all of a sudden I-- At this very shot we were going to shoot. And I just had to just walk across the compound. And I said, “I don’t know how I’m going to do this. How am I going to be this guy?” I didn’t even have to say anything. But I just didn’t feel like I could be the guy. So they say action. So open the door and I walk out and there’s a nurse coming toward me. So I just throw my arm around her waist and pulled her over. And I thought well this isn’t so hard.\n\nOLIPHANT: Howdy-do. Does that help?\n\nALDA: Did I answer it?\n\nOLIPHANT: A follow-up might be-- Can you recap, since most of us either don’t know that much about the Korean War in general or “MASH” units in particular? Can you account for the credibility of the characters on the program over such a long period of time? Maybe it’s people trying, with a little wit, to make sense of madness?\n\nALDA: Well, yeah, that’s what it tended to boil down to most of the time. Because they were on an assembly line of carnage and they had been trained to bring people to health and they were stitching them back together and them seeing them come back all torn up again after they had been back in the grinder. But in addition to that one of the things that made them credible is that we didn’t make it up. The producers interviewed 100 or 200 doctors and nurses who had been through the experience in Korea. And we had reams of transcripts of these interviews. And all of us who wrote for the show would pick through it. I remember going through it one day just looking for an idea, a paragraph or something that could turn into a whole story. And I saw the marks of the pens and pencils of the writers who had preceded me. Putting a circle around something or putting a check mark or an arrow by it. And we used every single little shred of something. And then it turned-- Because we became so familiar with what kinds of lives they led, when we made up a story it often not only sounded real to us, but when the producers went to Korea to visit it, they found out that a story that we had only imagined had actually happened. So if you get enough of the facts right you can figure out what else might be true.\n\nOLIPHANT: Right. So the personal can be political, can’t it?\n\nALDA: I’m not sure I believe in the superiority of the personal over the political. But I sure do believe that if you’re only political and you have no personal awareness or values for the personal, it’s not going to do many people any good.\n\nOLIPHANT: They lived in the Kremlin for a long time.\n\nALDA: Exactly. That’s why Communism stinks. Because it’s just an idea.\n\nOLIPHANT: Sir, thank you for waiting.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Alda, I spent five years serving in the US Army, including a year in Iraq. I wanted to relate to you [applause]-- I just spoke to my good friend who’s stationed about 14 hours on a plane ride in South Korea from here where we were stationed together actually. So he says hello from a little place south of Seoul, South Korea. But when we were in Iraq I was remembering an episode of “MASH” where you were writing out your will and trying to figure out what you were going to leave to each of the other characters in the story. And I remember being pinned down with my friend with our platoon in a firefight and having tracer fire, you know, barely getting over our heads and writing out my will and testament basically. Here I am, 22 years old, and writing out a will and testament. It kind of freaked me out even more than the tracer fire going over my head at times. And later on my buddy had asked me what I had left him. I said, “Well, hey, if I’m dying you’re going to die to, you know.”\n\nBut basically, I jokingly told him I was going to leave him a couple packs of cigarettes and a tube of toothpaste because that’s all we had, you know. But in reality it was so hard trying to come up with stuff to leave people. And basically all I ended up leaving him in my will and testament was, you know, thank you for the friendship and the guidance. Because here I was a 22 year old naïve kid who had just graduated high school a couple of years ago. Hadn’t been to college. Went right overseas. And I kept remember that episode of “MASH” among other ones. The humor, the humanity, you know, you exuded. So I wanted to say thank you.\n\nALDA: I thank you. Thank you not only for saying that but for being there and risking yourself for your country like that. Were you physically hurt in anyway?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Not in Iraq. I was injured twice when I was in Korea, actually. I was a military police officer. So I was temporarily actually blinded by a flashbang grenade. And I also had a pool cue broken over my back breaking up a bar fight.\n\nALDA: How are you otherwise? Was Iraq a debilitating experience emotionally or spiritually?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Emotionally, yes. Because three of my roommates from basic training, my 17-week basic training and AIT course for being a military police officer-- I had nine roommates, three of which I went to Iraq with. And all three of them didn’t come back. It’s kind of funny the things you remember most about some of these people ended up being some of the stupidest stuff. Running around being crazy and being young guys in the military. But considering one of my friends died just shy of his 21st birthday and we were lamenting how we’re old enough to die for our country but we’re not old enough to have a drink at a bar. Yeah, it was emotionally more than anything more draining than anything. And it’s amazing how much you appreciate when you come home-- I told my parents, you know, it can be an all you can eat buffet at a restaurant that you miss like crazy. That’s the one thing that I was looking forward to when I got home.\n\nYou know, a real meal at a good restaurant that I used to go to with my family. That I miss more than anything. And that I appreciated it about a thousand times more once I came home.\n\nALDA: I’m glad you’re back and you’re safe.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. [applause]\n\nOLIPHANT: Switching over, ma’am. Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: That’s a tough act to follow. I think I am your biggest fan. I grew up watching it with my dad. It was my mom’s bowling night.\n\nALDA: You got it right. Well, you can’t be that impressed.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh no. And I watch it in syndication all the time. One question. Since you had your surgery do you go back and talk to the people that influenced your life or that you worked with in “MASH” and things like that?\n\nALDA: Well, we never stopped getting together. The people in “MASH” get together, not that often, but at least once a year we try to get together for dinner. And then we sit around and make fun of each other. And that is what we did. That’s how we spent our days. That’s when I learned a very important lesson about acting which was that the connection that we had off camera which we kept going all day long. We never went to our dressing rooms. We would sit in the circle of chairs and laugh together. We’d just make each other laugh all day long. We carried that energy on stage, on camera. And sometimes we’d be doing right up until the time-- You know, usually on a movie set they say quiet. The bell rings. Everybody quiets down and then they say-- They get the guy with the clapper. Act one, scene two. And then the guy says action. We wouldn’t stop.\n\nThey’d say quiet. We’d just bring it down a little bit. The guy with the clapper says act one, scene 2. They’d have to say it loudly because we’re still talking, we’re still laughing. Guy says action. Just before the first line we would shut up sometimes and then start the scene. But boy, the connection we had with one another we never lost. Now every time I do a play I try to sit with the other actors for an hour before the performance and just get that connection. Just be laughing. Go on stage with that laughter in us. It’s the best preparation.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you.\n\nALDA: Thank you.\n\nOLIPHANT: Thank you. Ma’am.\n\nMAGGIE HANEY(?): Thank you, Mr. Alda, for spending time with us tonight. I’m Maggie Haney(?). First things first, you want to save yourself some time, as much as I love my Irish heritage, Snoqualmie Falls Lodge Oatmeal, Seattle, Washington. Saves you a ton of time.\n\nOLIPHANT: I don’t know that one.\n\nALDA: What kind of oatmeal?\n\nOLIPHANT: Say it again.\n\nHANEY: Snoqualmie Falls--\n\nALDA: Noqualmie Falls--\n\nHANEY: Snoqualmie. S-N-O. Wonderful.\n\nALDA: You like it too? How many other people have ever heard of Snoqualmie? Get a load of this.\n\nOLIPHANT: Oh my God. It’s a conspiracy.\n\nALDA: No, it’s like welcome to the People’s Republic of Massachusetts. [laughter]\n\nOLIPHANT: Snoqualmie Falls Washington--\n\nHALEY: Wonderful lodge. “Twin Peaks” was actually filmed there.\n\nALDA: It’s better than McCanns?\n\nHALEY: Oh, absolutely, bar none.\n\nALDA: Does anybody else find that hard to believe? McCanns burst in your mouth like a gummy champagne.\n\nHALEY: Have you ever had a really good Irish breakfast? Come on now.\n\nALDA: Alright, it was a contradiction in terms. Proceed.\n\nHALEY: To my question.\n\nALDA: You don’t need a question after that. Go ahead.\n\nHALEY: I’ve been in nursing for 37 years. I’ve been blessed to see a lot of continuance of life from birth to death over and over again. And you talk about writing to your family and having that opportunity. And I’ve also seen that and been a part of that a lot. And I’ve been blessed to be a part of that and privileged. My question to you is was there any time during that period between the time that you were ill and the time that you went to surgery that you had any regrets, and you felt like you needed to act on any regret whatsoever?\n\nALDA: Oh, regrets. No, I don’t remember having any regrets. It’s not that I haven’t done things that I don’t regret. It’s just that I didn’t feel any regrets at that moment. And I generally-- You know, when I think about it I don’t mind having done anything I did or any decisions that I made, because that led to some crooked path that got me to here and to loving the people that I love. And I’m happy. But I must have regrets because I’ll be driving in the car with my wife and suddenly I’ll go …[gasp]. And she’ll say, “What? What’s the matter?” I’ll say, “I just remembered something I did 20 years ago.” I think about these things like for centuries.\n\nOLIPHANT: Were you this obsessively introspective?\n\nALDA: That must be what it is, yeah.\n\nOLIPHANT: But the question almost is-- Maybe I don’t think it is directly confronted in the book. Are you a different person because of this or are you a different person simply because according to your concept we are a different person every five seconds?\n\nALDA: I don’t even understand that.\n\nOLIPHANT: I didn’t either. That’s okay. We could have just kept it going and they wouldn’t know.\n\nALDA: I don’t know. I’m curious. I was curious as a little boy. When I was 5 years old I wondered how my mother’s watch worked. And I got the case apart and saw the little wheels turning and I thought this is so interesting. And then I had to put it back together and I couldn’t get it to go together. So I bit on it to put it together. And I left my tooth marks in it. And of course the watch stopped dead, you know. And my mother said, “Ally, did you bite my watch?” And I’m thinking, “I didn’t bite her watch. I was closing it.” But I was curious even from that moment. And I think maybe I just seized on this opportunity of nearly dying.\n\nOLIPHANT: As a nurse does he sound typical or weird or unusual? What’s your experience? It’s probably more vast than ours.\n\nHALEY: And that’s why I’m curious. It’s that I see really a focus on the loving versus the regret. I see a void of regret at those moments in time and was just curious as I continue to ask people-- I asked a 108 year old gentleman one time, who looked great, I said, “How did you do this?” And he said to me, and he winked, and he said, “Everything in moderation.” And he said, “Don’t you dare leave a thing out.”\n\nALDA: You know, when I was 16 I had an inspiration. And I thought, here’s how I’m going to live my life. Everything in moderation, especially moderation.\n\nOLIPHANT: Thank you for waiting.\n\nSHERRY ALPERT: My name’s Sherry Alpert. I had an uncanny experience last week that involved me.\n\nALDA: A what?\n\nALPERT: An uncanny experience.\n\nALDA: Uncanny experience. That’s okay.\n\nALPERT: I turned on a TV show and it was an hour into “The Aviator,” which I by the way loved. And it was right at the beginning of your character’s scene having dinner with Howard Hughes and starting this whole bribery thing that turned into blackmail. And I remember thinking, my God, of all the movies and TV programs I’ve seen Alan Alda in, this is the one character that is the most diametrically opposite to who I envision him as a person. And then I was thinking back to what you said earlier tonight, that you loved taking on parts that were so unlike you, and I’m thinking maybe that was why you did such a stupendous job with it. Because this part was such a completely different person.\n\nALDA: Well, thanks. Yeah, and the trick there was that--\n\nOLIPHANT: Owen Brewster?\n\nALDA: Pardon me?\n\nOLIPHANT: Owen Brewster?\n\nALDA: Owen Brewster, yeah. And he really lived. And I was very-- I was so flattered when Scorsese asked me to do it. And he says, “You’ll just be great in this.” And then I saw a picture of Owen Brewster. He was the ugliest man I ever saw in my life. And I wondered how I got cast in that.\n\nOLIPHANT: You know, the exposure of his corruption is what created the opening that produced Edwin Muskie.\n\nALDA: Oh, really?\n\nOLIPHANT: Out of that corrupt era in Maine is where it came.\n\nALDA: That was an interesting thing for me because I had to figure out how I could want what he wanted and how I could get what he wanted to get. And the point I reach when I’m successful at it is that I don’t just want what he wants. But I feel like I deserve to get it. You know, when you feel like you can deserve Poland you can play Hitler. It’s like of course I want your money. I deserve your money. And then you can be charming about it. You don’t have to be, like, villainous.\n\nOLIPHANT: Can I ask him about another character? You have also been the Republican nominee for President.\n\nALDA: Right. In the same year I played two Republican senators. One a very decent guy and the other this villain you’re talking about.\n\nOLIPHANT: Right. But I don’t know. The “West Wing” guy? I was always sort of ambivalent about. But I asked the question to follow-up on this excellent one about “The Aviator” because in this building, of all places, you have had that rarest of experiences: debating with the presidency at stake in live television.\n\nALDA: Live television.\n\nOLIPHANT: Tell us about that and what you learned about the games--\n\nALDA: You bring up a really good point. The Kennedy-Nixon debate was the first live televised debate. And it was one of the most exciting times of my life professionally because it was written. But only had a few days to rehearse it. It was truly live. You know, people when they say live, sometimes they mean, “Oh, you taped it in front of a live audience.” No, what we were doing went out right then to New York. And we waited a couple of hours and we did it for California. And it was a different audience in the room. And the people in the California version, they thought it was a Democratic rally. I couldn’t get them to shut up when it was my turn to talk. Every time Jimmy Smits says something, everybody goes, “Yes, yes!” And I started adlibbing. I said, “Just a second. What I got is something good to say here, you know.” But it was really exciting because you were living right on the edge there. You didn’t know if you were going to fall of a cliff. I mean I didn’t know if I was going to say something that came at the end. And then we’d just have to stand there for 40 minutes and make it up.\n\nALPERT: Let’s not forget your first political character in “The Seduction of Joe Tynan.”\n\nALDA: Yeah, well I wrote that, so it made me very happy that that was successful.\n\nOLIPHANT: Just to follow up one last time. And then we have time and apparently room for two more. I was wondering if during that hour in primetime you were having to express views that you didn’t agree with--\n\nALDA: You know, it’s so interesting. I got asked that so many times before I played Vinick, this character. And people would say to me, “Oh gee, are you going to have to say a lot of Republican things? Will you be able to do that?” And I’d say, “You know, nobody asked me when I played a murderer. If I can play a murderer I can certainly play a Republican.” Come on.\n\nOLIPHANT: Maybe it’s appropriate to observe, like Freud, that sometimes a line is just a line.\n\nALDA: That’s right. It’s right.\n\nOLIPHANT: We have time for two more. You’ve been very patient and thank you.\n\nJIM MCCULUCH(?): Jim McCuluch(?), a retired school teacher. One of the wonderful things about “MASH” certainly was its humor and you’ve touched upon this with some of the other questions. But you took that idea that transcended life and you found it in manuscripts. How did you build on that idea when you were writing the shows that you wrote to make it both human and funny?\n\nALDA: You know, that’s a very interesting question. I think it happened in different ways. Usually it would happen in a way that I can’t trace for you, except that I really personally have always valued recognition that life is both tragic and funny at the same time. You know, sometimes the biggest laughs are at funerals. You say something about the person who’s gone and everybody recognizes that character and personality and they break into spontaneous laughter. And it’s healing to have it. But with the strangest group of people, everybody in this room, and everybody all around the globe is going to be gone and replaced by other people within the next 120 years. Everybody. Maybe they’ll live a little longer. By then, the people born this minute might live to 130 or 140. But we’re all going to go and none of us pays any attention to that. It’s when we finally do, you and I start to go and the lady before, we start to think, “Well, wait a second. This is pretty good being here. I like this.” So I don’t know why, but I’ve always been very aware. Maybe it was because of a trauma in my childhood or the difficult times I had. I really like to recognize how hard it is and how much fun it can be at the same time. Combining them. But I don’t know. I can’t trace how it comes up.\n\nThere was a time in our house in New Jersey when in the middle of the night the alarm went off and people had broken into the house and it was a terrible feeling of violation. And they stole our car, they stole the TV set downstairs, and they left the door open and the drapes were blowing in the breeze. It looked like a black and white movie from the 1940s. Then the cops came and they searched the house. I was up until 5:00 in the morning, couldn’t sleep. And I had this feeling of violation. I was working on a script at that time and it had nothing to do with this. But I was so moved by this. My emotions were churning.\n\n….(inaudible) even his bad grammar. But it had so much heart in it that Potter said that’s good. I’m going to send it just the way it is. I was moved to write that. But I wasn’t moved by anything like that. I was moved by having been robbed, burgled. Isn’t that strange? The way the brain works. The response to one thing, once you stir it up, can lead to something else. So it’s a good idea to get stirred up as much as possible. Thank you for that question.\n\nMCCULUCH: Just one other little comment to the audience. I had an opportunity this summer to visit some friends from Florida in Toledo, Ohio. And I got an opportunity to go to Clinger’s famous restaurant and have a very wonderful meal there and observe all the pictures of “MASH.”\n\nALDA: Yeah, that restaurant has been done very well.\n\nMCCULUCH: And I’m sure you’ve been there.\n\nALDA: Yeah, thank you.\n\nOLIPHANT: Ma’am, thank you, first of all for your patience. And just moderator talk. When Mr. Alda’s finished with his comments I need to ask a favor of you all. And so will you be kind enough to turn it back to me and then we’ll close. But bless your heart for your patience and the floor is yours.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, the thanks go to you and it’s been delightful. Thank you for being here. First, though, I want to say to the young man from Iraq, I’m sorry you lost your friends and I’m sure everybody here feels that way also. Now, living in the now is living in the present moment.\n\nALDA: His five seconds has gone by. Go ahead.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: But living in the present moment makes a big difference in your life. I learned that a few years back and it did make a difference in my life. In getting back to activism, it isn’t what you’re doing to make the change, but when the change comes about and you’ve made the world a better place, that’s where the satisfaction comes in. And that’s what gives you a good feeling about you and it’s all about making the world a better place and making a difference.\n\nALDA: I agree with you and I certainly hope I didn’t give anybody the impression that I am suggesting to other people that they not be active in the world. I have been very active in the world and now I’m pursuing a different path. Everybody should be free to do what they feel in that moment in their lives they can do to make the best contribution. I’m trying to make the best contribution that I can. I’m making a much better contribution now than if I gave into my vanity and tried to be a politician. I wouldn’t be as good.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Right, and everybody can do it in their own little way.\n\nALDA: That’s right. Everybody should follow their path and maximize their effectiveness. You shouldn’t say should they say. But why do they say should when they say that?\n\nOLIPHANT: They mean must, I think, don’t they?\n\nALDA: You must not. But I think it’s a good idea to follow your own nose. And that changes. And as you grow you see things. That’s what’s happened to me. I’ve seen new ways to do things that I didn’t know I could do and I want to keep finding them out.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Now, add nuts and fruit to your oatmeal. It makes-- [laughter]\n\nOLIPHANT: Welcome to Massachusetts.\n\nALDA: Wait, she’s giving testimony about oatmeal.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: It tastes like dessert. It’s the best breakfast. Add a little ice cream and you’ve got your--\n\nALDA: By the way, you put a little yogurt in the oatmeal?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: No, I don’t care for yogurt.\n\nALDA: It’s very good. It’s like rice pudding. It’s really good.\n\nOLIPHANT: By the way, the oatmeal caucus will meet tomorrow morning upstairs. Now, what I need to please ask of you is if you could be kind enough to give Mr. Alda a couple of moments to get to where there are tons more books, etcetera, etcetera, which is all part of this. You know, there’s one word not about what we should do-- I mean, I think you say we should do. But it’s really must. And it’s tonight’s verb, and it’s worth closing on in a way. Say notice. You know, not when we’re brain dead waiting for the oatmeal to cook. But notice that you’re alive and that makes a difference. This is a special place.\n\nALDA: It certainly is. And you are terrific people to talk with. I really enjoyed it. Thank you very much.\n\nOLIPHANT: And on its behalf the thanks to Alan Alda knows no bounds for a lovely evening. Thanks for coming.\n\nALDA: Thank you.\n\nEND"
