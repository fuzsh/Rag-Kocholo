The film also starred Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Caine. The film was largely an Alan Alda project, and is somewhat drawn from his own early experience in the film business.

MovieArt Original Film Posters in Austin, Texas guarantees that this poster is authentic, vintage, original. MovieArt Austin does not sell reproductions.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer - Actor\n\nSir Michael Caine - Actor\n\nALAN ALDA - Actor/Director"
