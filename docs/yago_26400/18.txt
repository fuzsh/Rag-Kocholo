Sweet Liberty, written, directed by and starring Alan Alda, rips Hollywood's ideals for historical films a new one.

Back Cover Synopsis[]

It's Alan Alda versus Hollywood in the writer-director-star's hilarious comedy about moviemaking. As college history professor Michael Burgess, Alda's life and town are turned upside down when a film company arrives to make a movie out of his best-selling book on the American Revolution. To Professor Burgess' horror, leading man Michael Caine is a philandering adventurer; the movie's director wants to turn his historical novel into a youth-oriented lusty romp and female star Michelle Pfeiffer is so obsessed by Alda's heroine, he begins to fall in love with the zany actress. Brimming with charm and gentle humor and co-starring Lise Hillboldt, Bob Hoskins, Lois Chiles, Linda Thorson and Lillian Gish, Sweet Liberty is a delightful comic confection!
