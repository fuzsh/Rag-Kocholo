        "text": "Rotten-Row\n\nHere’s a tempting bit of greenery - of rue in urbe scenery –\n\nThat’s haunted by the London “upper ten”;\n\nWhere, by exercise on horseback, an equestrian may force back\n\nLittle fits of tedium vitae now and then.\n\nOh, the times that I have been there, and the types that I have seen there\n\nOf that gorgeous cockney animal, the “swell”,\n\nAnd the scores of pretty riders (both patricians and outsiders)\n\nAre considerably more than I can tell.\n\nWhen first the warmer weather brought these people all together,\n\nAnd the crowds began to thicken through the Row,\n\nI reclined against the railing on a sunny day, inhaling\n\nAll the spirits that the breezes could bestow.\n\nAnd the riders and the walkers, and the thinkers and the talkers,\n\nLeft me lonely in the thickest of the throng.\n\nNot a touch upon the shoulder – not a nod from one beholder –\n\nAs the strain of Art and Nature went along.\n\nBut I brought away one image, from that fashionable scrimmage,\n\nOf a figure and a face – ah, such a face!\n\nLove has photographed the features of that loveliest of creatures\n\nOn my memory, as Love alone can trace.\n\nDid I hate the little dandy with long whiskers (they were sandy),\n\nWhose absurd salute was honoured by a smile?\n\nDid I marvel at his rudeness in presuming on her goodness,\n\nWhen she evidently loathed him all the while?\n\nOh, the hours that I have wasted, the regrets that I have tasted,\n\nSince the time (it seems a century ago),\n\nWhen my heart was won instanter by a lady in a canter,\n\nOn a certain sunny day in Rotten-row!\n\nPoem published in the Victorian magazine Fun, 1865"
