        "text": "The Citizens Band make their SXSW debut at the Citizens Circus!\n\nNew York City's entertainment bible Paper magazine called them \"the most exciting act in New York nightlife\", and claimed that \"their combination of Broadway showmanship and arty charisma make them the most appealing nightlife act to hit downtown in a long, long time.\" Now, NYC's most thrilling musical act The Citizens Band announce their SXSW debut at the Warby Parker Citizen's Circus in the grounds of the French Legation Museum at sundown on Monday 12, Tuesday 13 and Wednesday 14 of March. The free all-ages show features some of the Citizens Band's most glorious talents and promises to turn a little corner of Austin into the most glamorous place in Texas, the likes of which have never been seen before!\n\nThe Citizens Band are a musical troupe in the old fashioned sense of the word, a like-minded group of artists with an ever-changing line-up and boundless creativity. Hailing from a fantastic neverland that lies somewhere between a carnival sideshow and Weimar Berlin, The Citizens Band is a sexy, raucous, collaborative cabaret. Offering a unique blend of melodious song, dance and ariel ballet The Citizens Band’s primary goal is to entertain, but always with a sharp jab of the elbow to remind their audience of the state of the world and their place in it. A social conscience is at the core of their being and The Citizens Band likes to remind us that we’re all citizens of the same world.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to attend and/ or speak with members of The Citizens Band prior to or during SXSW. More information on the troupe and video clips of previous shows available here: http://www.thecitizensband.net\n\nMaroon 5s James Valentine to Run Los Angeles Marathon to Benefit The Pablove Foundation\n\nMaroon 5 guitarist James Valentine has announced he will run the 2012 Los Angeles Marathon to help benefit The Pablove Foundation (http://pablove.org/). The national organization’s mission is to fund pediatric cancer research and advances in treatment, to educate and empower cancer families and to improve the quality of life for children living with cancer through hospital play, music and arts programs.\n\nAlready an avid jogger, James Valentine was inspired by Maroon 5’s work with the Teen Impact Program at the Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles, which provides activities and support for young people facing cancer, where Valentine met amazing kids who faced incredible challenges. He was particularly touched by Carlo, a young guitarist in the Teen Impact Program, with whom he shared a passion for guitar. Tragically, Carlo passed earlier this year but his death impacted Valentine, encouraging his desire to no raise money for cancer research.\n\nFor more information or to make a donation, go http://www.stayclassy.org/fundraise/pablove?fcid=122601.\n\nSHE & HIM Release A Very She & Him Christmas on 10/25!\n\nMerge Records is proud to announce the release of She & Him’s first-ever holiday recording entitled A Very She & Him Christmas on October 25th, 2011.\n\nA Very She & Him Christmas is a wonderful collection of holiday tunes from two of music’s most impressive artists – Zooey Deschanel (She) & M. Ward (Him). Inspired by seminal holiday albums by the likes of The Carpenters, Vince Guaraldi, The Beach Boys, Elvis Presley and more, She & Him have set out to create an intimate holiday recording of Christmas classics that helps bring new emotions out of old songs. Recorded in Los Angeles and NYC at various points in 2011, A Very She & Him Christmas sees the duo stepping back slightly from the layered, lush aesthetic of their critically acclaimed second album, Volume Two. On A Very She & Him Christmas, Deschanel and Ward let the songs speak for themselves, oftentimes recording them with just acoustic guitar and vocals. Consistent in everything are the elements that have made She & Him one of the most loved bands of the last few years – Deschanel’s soulful vocal delivery and Ward’s impressive guitar work, both sounding as timeless as ever.\n\nThe track listing for A Very She & Him Christmas is:\n\n1. The Christmas Waltz\n\n2. Christmas Day\n\n3. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\n\n4. I’ll Be Home for Christmas\n\n5. Christmas Wish\n\n6. Sleigh Ride\n\n7. Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree\n\n8. Silver Bells\n\n9. Baby, It’s Cold Outside\n\n10. Blue Christmas\n\n11. Little Saint Nick\n\n12.

Announce New Album Hello Sadness!\n\nLOS CAMPESINOS! Hello Sadness (Arts & Crafts; November 15th, 2011) (Credit: Jon Bergman)\n\nRosi Golan and Family Records Team Up To Release Lead Balloon on Sept 27\n\nRosi Golan and Family Records are extremely excited to announce their partnership for the upcoming release of the gorgeous full length, Lead Balloon set to hit September 27. Family Records is a small but tenacious music company based in NYC, run by artists infected with the moon-headed notion that songs can improve the world. We agree wholeheartedly, the 12 stunning tracks that make up Lead Balloon have definitely brightened our world. Catch Rosi on tour now with Jason Reeves before she heads overseas to play select shows with Joshua Radin as well as Family Records band, Wakey!Wakey!.\n\nOver the years Rosi Golan has worked to refine and hone her sound, collecting new elements and crafting her art in the places she finds herself. The Israeli-born songstress has made many stops in her travels and Lead Balloon perfectly captures the environment where Rosi brought each song to fruition – there is the bone-damp chill of London, the constant buzz of Brooklyn and the arid wind of Los Angeles. Produced by Tony Berg (Phantom Planet, Aimee Mann), the album moves fluidly between genres, containing songs steeped in Americana, clever pop currents running throughout, and thoughtful folk. Her unique talent for rich, dark melodies showcases a voice that not only draws you in, but still haunts you the next day.\n\nFamily Records President Wesley Verhoeve states “We're beyond thrilled to welcome Rosi to the Family. She has been a friend of the Family for years, a like-minded soul and a tremendously talented song writer with a golden voice. Her new album \"Lead Balloon\" is one of those rare records that undulates perfectly between all those thoughts and emotions that every person experiences as part of a relationship, and we can't wait to share it with our fans and the world at large. We're also excited to welcome Rosi's fan base into our Family of passionate music fans, and to be working with Rosi's manager David Margolis who has been a friend for years as well.”\n\nThe Drifter & The Gypsy, Rosi’s 2008 debut, generated several songs that were prominently featured on numerous television shows (including One Tree Hill and Private Practice) and in film (Dear John). On the strength of Drifter, Rosi embarked on a series of tours that saw her traipsing the globe before finally laying new roots down on the west coast where she began recording Lead Balloon.\n\nCatch Rosi On Tour This Summer & Fall!\n\n* With Jason Reeves\n\n** Record release party & show with Ian Axel & The Spring Standards\n\n# With Joseph Arthur\n\n*8/24/11 @ Slowdown – Omaha, NE\n\n*8/25/11 @ Augustana College – Rock Island, IL\n\n*8/27/11 @ Shank Hall – Milwaukee, WI\n\n*8/28/11 @ Space – Evanston, IL\n\n*8/30/11 @ Fine Line Music Café – Minneapolis, MN\n\n*8/31/11 @ The Mill – Iowa City, IA\n\n*9/1/11 @ State Historical Bldg – Des Moines, IA\n\n*9/2/11 @ The Bottleneck – Lawrence, KS\n\n**9/6/11 @ Bowery Ballroom – New York, NY\n\n#9/22/11 @ Troubadour\n\nSO and SO Announce Full Length ASAP and Premiere a Track With Us Weekly\n\nWhether they’re conjuring dreamy pop harmonies or turning out soulful beats, Los Angeles based SO & SO is not your average troupe of ordinary indie pop musicians. With their debut album ASAP set to hit November 15th, SO & SO transcend traditional pop and undulate gracefully from trip-hop to rock and indie pop to electro-fusion. With the incredible award winning multi-platinum producers Rob Wells, Damon Sharpe and newcomer Justin Glasco on board, the California quintet comes together to exude propulsive energy that’s innovative, fresh and sonically all-their-own on this incredibly exciting upcoming release. The band has teamed up with Us Weekly & Ian in Your Ear to exclusively premiere a first listen of the incredibly catchy track, “What’s The Use”, listen to it here: http://bit.ly/rhuA7e.\n\nSO & SO came to fruition when singer Amie Miriello (Dirtie Blonde) and guitarist Jay “Raisin” Dmuchowski (Dirtie Blonde) joined forces with producer Rob Wells at ATV in Canada to compose a songwriting trio and sell the tracks to other artists. However, after the first few tracks were cut they realized that they had stumbled onto something very special, a novel sound Amie describes as “sexy indie pop with real soul,” a sound they wanted to take on themselves. That batch of tunes would eventually become the inspiration for their upcoming full length, ASAP, but SO & SO weren’t quite complete just yet…\n\nWhile playing a gig at LA’s Molly Malone’s, Amie stumbled upon Brandon Rogers a top 12 finalist on Season 6 of American Idol, and was immediately smitten by his effortless vocals. While Brandon was wholly focused on his solo career, he quickly recognized their special and electric vocal chemistry, accepting Amie’s offer to join SO & SO without hesitation. Drummer Adam Hanson and bassist Bana Haffar round out the band and fully connect the dots between pop palatability and dirty soul, a unique, one-of-a-kind dynamic heard throughout ASAP.\n\nTheir brilliant upcoming debut showcases a whirlwind of emotion juxtaposed with poignant poetic rumination. On “Heart Beats Slow” acoustic guitars growl into a powerful chorus, while “What’s the Use?” meanders from tripped-out electronic textures to a hand-clap fueled hook. At the heart of the music lies Amie’s entrancing croon, flares of Jay’s evocative guitar, and a dual backdrop of undeniable soul by drummer Adam and bassist Bana. Like icing on a cake, Brandon provides a decadent layer of rich, organic vocals.\n\nBaaba Maal Announces Fall US Speaking Engagements Tales From The Sahel\n\nThis October, Baaba Maal will be coming to the US to headline a series of speaking dates moderated by renowned music journalist and author Chris Salewicz (The Sunday Times, the Independent, Bob Marley: The Untold Story). Baaba will discuss his personal experiences growing up in Africa and traveling the world, his views on issues facing Africa and the African diaspora, as well as other assorted issues of the day. During the course of the evening, Baaba will be playing some songs alongside multi-instrumentalist Jim Palmer and his longstanding percussionist Mamadou Sarr. This will be a unique and intimate event- an evening full of surprises.\n\nOne of the true stars to rise from the African continent, Senegalese master musician Baaba Maal has been making music for the world to enjoy for nearly two decades. Renowned for his fiery vocal performances and his musical fusion of western sounds with the traditional beats and melodies of West Africa, Baaba Maal has earned immense critical acclaim and has continually reinforced his role as a seminal artist in the world music arena. His work has also extended beyond music and into the realms of humanitarian spokesperson through his role as youth emissary for the United Nation's Development Program and his outspoken stances on HIV/AIDS in Africa, the growing role of women on the continent and his support of youth-based initiatives to help Africa move into the new millennium.\n\nIt’s been roughly one year since Baaba Maal toured the US in support of his latest album, Television, which CNN called “fearless and all-encompassing…fresh yet timeless.” This upcoming series of dates will give US audiences a different experience- the chance to hear Baaba's worldly insight and knowledge.\n\nAnnounced Tales From The Sahel Dates:\n\nOct 5 Oakland, CA @ Yoshi’s\n\nOct 6 Oakland, CA @ Yoshi’s\n\nOct 7 Santa Cruz, CA @ Rio Theatre\n\nOct 8 Los Angeles, CA @ Univ of Southern California\n\nOct 9 San Diego, CA @ Anthology\n\nOct 11 Seattle, WA @ Triple Door\n\nOct 13 Denver, CO @ L2 Arts & Cultural Center\n\nOct 15 Minneapolis, MN @ Cedar Cultural Center\n\nOct 16 Chicago, IL @ Old Town School of Folk Music\n\nOct 17 Ann Arbor, MI @ The Ark\n\nOct 18 Nelsonville, OH @ Smart’s Opera House\n\nOct 19 Alexandria, VA @ Birchmere\n\nOct 21 New York, NY @ Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at PACE\n\nOct 22 Blue Bell, PA @ Science Center Theatre\n\nOct 23 Boston, MA @ ICA Theatre\n\nMONA Annouces Fall Tour\n\nMONA will be hitting the road this fall in support of their upcoming debut album release (ZionNoiz, Mercury).

Inni is comprised of a double live album and seventy-five minute film of Sigur Rós’ last show before their well-documented “indefinite hiatus” at the end of 2008. Recorded and shot over two nights at London’s Alexandra Palace at the close of the world tour around their fifth full length album, Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust, Inni sees the band at the peak of their powers, captured on film for the first time as a core four-piece since they were joined by string section amiina at the start of the century. Directed by Vincent Morisset (Arcade Fire’s Miroir Noir), the film is set to debut at this year’s Venice Film Festival on September 3rd, 2011.\n\nInni is Sigur Rós' second live film following 2007's hugely-celebrated tour documentary Heima. Whereas that film positioned the enigmatic group in the context of their Icelandic homeland, providing geographical, social and historical perspectives on their otherworldly music, Inni focuses purely on the band's performance, and stands as a stark counterpoint to Heima’s kaleidoscopic richness. Where Heima was lush and colorfully expansive, Inni is spare and near-monochromatic in its tunnel vision. Filmed in a manner that invites both intimacy and claustrophobia, Inni cocoons the viewer in a one-on-one relationship with the band, eschewing the audience for closeness, depicting how it feels for both band and fan to experience Sigur Rós live.\n\nThe film’s elegance and atmosphere are enhanced by Morisset’s re-filming of the original digital footage on 16mm, which was then re-filmed again, sometimes through prisms and other found objects, allowing Inni to look and feel like something recovered from the past. Interspersed with this is archival footage drawn from the band’s previous decade, dating back as far as 1998. This juxtaposition gives viewers the full scope of Sigur Rós’ origins, evolution, originality and influence.\n\nThe live album Inni – a first for the band – is comprised of the full set from Alexandra Palace, played in order with just one omission, and clocks in at one-and-three-quarter hours. Recorded by Sigur Rós’ in-house studio engineer Birgir Jón Birgisson, Inni’s live audio recording is far and away the best way of replicating the full-force effect of standing in front of one of the world’s most extraordinary bands for an evening.\n\nWhen taken in together, Inni’s film and live album give us an incredible account of one of the most celebrated and influential rock bands of recent years, showing where they’ve come from, where they’ve been, and like all things Sigur Rós, where it is they will be going next.\n\nMore details of how, when and where Inni will enter the world will be made available shortly. In the meantime, the trailer is available to watch now at www.sigur-Rós.co.uk.\n\nMIDDLE CLASS RUT Announce Headlining Fall Tour\n\nSacramento-based rock duo, Middle Class Rut, have announced the dates of their fall headlining tour! Fresh off the heels of a month long run with the Vans Warped Tour, MC Rut will be joined by Lite Brite and Ume as they make their way across the country. They will be hitting Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Tucson and bouncing around Texas along their routing wrapping their tour at the famed Emo’s in Austin, so be sure to mark your calendars – full list of dates is below! Before kicking off their headlining run, you can catch Middle Class Rut at such festivals as the Buzz Beach Ball and Sonic Boom 2011 on August 19 and September 4, respectively, as well as at Pointfest on September 10. With a busy fall season ahead of them, MC Rut will also be playing as part of the heavy-hitting lineup at KROQ’s Epicenter 2011 on September 24.\n\nMiddle Class Rut are touring in support of their debut album, No Name No Color, which spawned the smash radio hit “New Low” reaching No. 5 at Alternative Radio. Having being named “2011 Artist to Watch” by MTV and scoring a coveted spot in USA Today’s “On the Verge” feature, Middle Class Rut are one of the most promising acts of the year. They recently wrapped up a European arena tour with Linkin Park and just completed their month long trek with the Vans Warped Tour.\n\nMC Rut has been eagerly embraced by rock fans and the press for their stunning debut, which artfully blurs the line between heavy and melodic with raw, energized rock and roll. This band is no overnight sensation. The duo, Zack Lopez (vocals, guitar) and Sean Stockham (drums), have been playing together since they were teenagers. The pair records every song they write together almost immediately upon coming up with the idea in their rehearsal space, capturing the instantaneous spirit of a track while still in the moment. They've toured with a range of artists, including Linkin Park, Social Distortion, Alice in Chains, Them Crooked Vultures, The Bronx and ...Trail Of Dead and their track “Lifelong Dayshift” is featured on the exclusive GameStop release of the Transformers: Dark of the Moon soundtrack.\n\nWATCH:\n\nVideo for “Busy Bein’ Born” at Alternative Press HERE\n\nBehind the scenes video of “Hurricane” cover HERE\n\nBUY:\n\nCollector’s lyric book for No Name No Color HERE\n\n“Hurricane” 10” HERE\n\nCheck in at www.MCRut.com for additional dates and other updates!\n\nMIDDLE CLASS RUT TOUR DATES:\n\n^ with Lite Brite & Ume\n\n8/19/11 Kansas City, KS @ Livestrong Sporting Park (Buzz Beach Ball)\n\n9/2/11 Redmond, WA @ Maymoor Park (107.7 The End – Summer Camp ’11)\n\n9/4/11 Edmonton, Alberta, CA @ Edmonton Northlands Park (Sonic Boom 2011)\n\n9/10/11 Maryland Heights, MO @ Verizon Wireless Amphitheater (Pointfest)\n\n9/11/11 Kalamazoo, MI @ The Strutt ^\n\n9/12/11 Indianapolis, IN @ The Vogue ^\n\n9/13/11 Mt.

He was disappointed she was a girl and cried. Eighteen years later, Jake got over it, and he and his sister Casey had their first practice as a band. Now the brother/sister team, alongside band mate Jake Churton, are releasing Boyfriends, Girlfriends, their infectious sophomore album that is poised to put the Pittsburgh trio on the musical map. Today the band has unveiled the video for first single, “The World Is Ours,” on AOL Spinner. Check out the clip here (http://www.spinner.com/2011/08/15/donora-the-world-is-ours-video/). Boyfriends, Girlfriends is set for release on September 27th on Rostrum Records.\n\nYou may recognize Casey Hanner’s soaring vocals from sync spots pulled from their 2008 self-titled debut album for multiple MTV shows or as the soundtrack to PostSecret’s Valentine’s Day viral video. With a buzzy debut album and a viral video of their own under their belts (see the awe-inspiring hoola-hoop clip for track “I Think I Like You” here) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKaFX_mQBhU, Donora returned to the family studio to write and record Boyfriends, Girlfriends. The Hanner siblings grew up in a music household, living over the recording studio that their father runs. Casey’s bedroom was directly above the control room, and she attributes her ability to sleep through anything to this fact. Jake grew up watching his father in the studio and happened to pick up a thing or two, which he lends brilliantly to the production of their sophomore album.\n\nThe band blends ‘80s slick-pop with ‘50s girl group bop, an alchemy that when layered under the band’s upbeat lyrics leads to an assured exuberance, a whimsy contained on the record that Casey likens to having a “Disney” effect. Jake Hanner plays drums, triggers samples from his octapad, and sings backup, and Casey sings and plays bar chords on an old black and white Silvertone.\n\nAptly named, Boyfriends, Girlfriends is threaded through with a welcome honesty, a hard stare at love and the mythology that surrounds it. First single “The World Is Ours” is a jangle-pop anthem, a point-counterpoint tune that chugs through the elation of love with Casey’s gauzy vocals, as Jake’s provide a shot of realism. “And Then The Girls” is the best song the ‘80s never produced, equal parts synth chilliness and dance-pop warmth, chronicling the predisposition that most have to wait on an idealized version of love. “Mancini’s Dance Hall” – based on the tales a local plumber has spun about his youth -- whirls open in sepia tones before turning into a full-on dance floor strut. Central to the album, and to the band’s sound, is the notion that things can be both serious and fun, upbeat and important.\n\nBoyfriends, Girlfriends track listing:\n\n1. The Story\n\n2. Champion\n\n3. The World Is Ours\n\n4. Mancini’s Dance Hall\n\n5. Boom Boom\n\n6. The Untouchables\n\n7. And Then The Girls\n\n8. Can Can\n\n9. If You See My Boyfriend\n\n10.

Whatever’s On Your Mind, finds Gomez driving forward on a beautifully lush and dynamic album. There is a fresh feeling of rebirth and awakening. One to raise a smile even from the naysayers.

Vanessa recently played her first single “Carousel” on The Today Show as well as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\nPraise for Rabbits on the Run:\n\n“A lovely sort of melancholy magic.” - Entertainment Weekly\n\n“Rabbits on the Run is Vanessa Carlton's career high water mark thus far, especially on the stunning \"Hear the Bells\" and \"Dear California\", a disarming love letter to the Golden State.” KCRW’s Chris Douridas\n\n“Vanessa Carlton again demonstrates her knack for pensive, piano-driven pop on ‘Carousel’ from Rabbits on the Run.” –People\n\n“Singer and pianist Ms. Carlton has long aspired to a different brand of pop stardom: less navel-baring ….and more melodramatic, heavily arranged pop symphonies.” -The New York Times\n\n“Wistful, piano-led balladry, but there's a touch of darkness and complexity on display here that wasn't as apparent on her earlier hits…. she's certainly not just another sensitive girl with a piano….” - RollingStone.com\n\nRabbits on the Run is the most honest and uncompromised album Vanessa Carlton has recorded to date, revealing a striking departure and an exciting snapshot in the evolution of this exquisite storyteller and inventive musician. The album was recorded in the UK at Peter Gabriel’s world-renowned Real World Studios with producer Steve Osborne (U2, B-52’s, KT Tunstall, Doves). The album finds Vanessa returning to music-making its most organic form to create ten intimate, evocative songs, recorded directly to tape with her close-knit team of collaborators including Steve Osborne, Patrick Hallahan of My Morning Jacket, and Ari Ingber of The Upwelling (all playing on the album). Partly inspired by two books, Richard Adams' Watership Down and Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time, Rabbits on the Run is 10-song set of gorgeous, haunting melodies and finely-crafted stories, including the lush first single \"Carousel,” the ambient and eerie “Hear the Bells” and the propulsive “London.”\n\nVanessa Carlton Fall 2011 Tour Dates w.

Heart: Release\n\nOMD Announces North American Tour Dates\n\nOrchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark, one of the UK’s most iconic bands, are returning to the U.S. and Canada for an extensive North American tour this fall. The 21-stop tour marks OMD’s highly anticipated return to the U.S. following their sold-out and highly praised spring run earlier this year. The Boston Globe declared “It may have been their first tour of the U.S. in 23 years, but OMD still sounded as remarkably fresh as they did at their mid-1980s peak,” and Newsday proclaimed “brilliance was on display.” Similarly, Yahoo affirms that their much-talked about SXSW performance “was truly the feel good show of the day.” In many cities, the excitement was so high that the concert had to be relocated to a larger venue to accommodate all the demand. The tour will feature the original OMD line up of Andy McCluskey, Paul Humphreys, Martin Cooper (keyboards) and Malcolm Holmes (drums).\n\nKicking off September 16 in Miami, the outing brings the band to New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, Dallas, San Francisco and many more. In cities where they performed this spring, OMD will be playing a slightly different set of songs to keep the show fresh, but will still include all the hits and classic fan favorites.\n\nOMD is touring in support of History of Modern, their first new album in 14 years. Released last fall via Bright Antenna/ILG, the album has sold over 100,000 copies worldwide and continues to receive overwhelming praise. Interview Magazine calls it “a forward-thinking but nostalgic visit to OMD's synth-y past….they are as influential as the band's contemporaries—Numan, Depeche Mode, even Joy Division,” and the Los Angeles Times states “their updates of Kraftwerk's and Can's analog wrangling still sound like tomorrow.” OMD frontman Andy McCluskey has called it “our best album since Architecture and Morality” – and few would disagree. The album was self-produced by OMD and mixed by one of the UK’s most in demand producers Mike Crossey (Artic Monkeys/Blood Red Shoes/Razorlight).\n\nIt's nearly thirty years since OMD first harnessed their creative and commercial powers, and 2010’s return with History of Modern proves they still have a way with a warm melody and interesting lyric. For all their love of experimental German music, the Wirral duo remains at heart, slaves to the pop song. History of Modern is a powerful, pulsating, vibrant testament to their shared pop sensibility. The 13-song collection contains classic OMD songs that invoke their pioneering and influential electronic roots. Many of today’s electro artists such as LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy, Mark Ronson, The XX, MGMT and The Killers have repeatedly cited OMD as a massive inspiration.

After a brief run of intimate album release shows this past Spring, the band will return to this side of the pond for eagerly anticipated live dates behind their critically acclaimed 13th studio album ALL YOU NEED IS NOW, produced by Mark Ronson and out on S-Curve Records. With performances from coast to coast that will include the Nokia Theater in LA and Tower Theatre in Philadelphia, the band will play their biggest hits and the incredible new songs that have inspired many to declare that Duran Duran are truly having a big moment in 2011.\n\nWith a brand new production that the band members have designed specifically for the North American run, these shows follow Duran Duran’s brilliantly reviewed live shows earlier in the year. American alternative pop-rockers Neon Trees will join the band as special guests on select dates.\n\nBack in the UK, the Duran Duran rumor mill was recently running on high until the band confirmed that indeed they had reunited supermodels Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Eva Herzigova, Helena Christensen, and Yasmin Le Bon for their “Girl Panic !” video, which superstar director JonasAkerlund recently shot in London in collaboration with Harper’s Bazaar and Swarovski Elements. Look out for the video coming this Fall.\n\nOne of the most celebrated albums of the band’s storied three-decade career, the nine-track digital-only version of ALL YOU NEED IS NOW hit #1 on the iTunes Albums Charts in 15 countries before the release of the 14-track LP earlier this year. Around the album’s release, Duran Duran – who have sold more than 80 million albums throughout their career – graced the cover of Paper Magazine and were all over America’s television screens with performances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Ellen DeGeneres Show(twice!), Jimmy Kimmel Live and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. They also played a very special one-night-only show for the American Express: Unstaged series, streamed live and directed by iconic filmmakerDavid Lynch.

After lighting up the blogosphere with their scruffy high-energy garage punk, Noisey followed the band to Athens, GA and scored an exclusive interview that details the wild, occasionally bloody, life of underground music in the deep South. The video also includes footage from the band's incredibly high energy set at the 40 Watt Club. Post it - we give you the embed and it’s a gift to be used lightly.\n\nGrowing up with Black Lips and Deerhunter as their elders in the vibrant Georgia punk community, the Balkans formed in 2008. Since then, they’ve released a non-stop barrage of 7” singles through local labels. Balkans first official LP, self-titled and recently released through Double Phantom, makes an unrelenting first impression with knockout tracks like “Black Swan” and “Troubled and Done.”\n\nWATCH: http://www.noisey.com/#!/feature/meet-balkans\n\nIntroducing Hindi Zahra DEBUT Album Out October 11 NAIVE RECORDS\n\nMoroccan-born, Parisian-bred songstress Hindi Zahra will make her American debut with Handmade (Naïve), out digitally September 26 with a physical release available on October 11. After the album’s worldwide release in 2010, Handmade captured audiences with Hindi’s sultry yet delicate melodies, ultimately taking the Prix Constantin (France’s Mercury Prize) in 2010. Her music is part blues, part jazz, and a dash of gypsy, exhibiting the myriad of colorful influences of Hindi’s past and present.\n\nThe self-taught composer produced and arranged Handmade in its entirety. Music is the story of her life- a family affair. The story of a Berber girl born in Morocco, Hindi’s father was in the army and her mother a housewife, occasional actress and singer of village repute. Her uncles were musicians in the post-psychedelic Moroccan scene of the 60’s and 70’s. She grew up to the sounds of traditional Berber music, the blues of the great Malian Ali Farka Touré and desert rock’n’roll. All of this occurred before she set out across the Mediterranean to join her father in Paris, taking her first job at the Louvre.\n\nWhile the art was influencing her imagination, she started to hone her musical chops doing backing vocals on hip-hop-flavored soul albums before embarking on her solo career. “I soon got fed up with the machines and loops, but what I took away from that experience was the understanding of what I really wanted to do.”\n\nThe album’s first single “Beautiful Tango” is a smoky ballad; a whistle-along melodic tribute to love. This transfixing album pays homage to her heritage with ballads like “Imik Si Mik” (Little by Little) and “Oursoul” (Bygones) in her native Berber tongue.\n\nA chanteuse with a vibrant flare, Hindi’s sound is stripped down and warm, revealing her authenticity. “Set Me Free” sings like a hymn with an impromptu performance by Hindi’s mother using plastic bags as percussion. Hindi effortlessly channels elements of contemporaries such as Keren Ann and Nouvelle Vague, and established women before her such as Suzanne Vega and Madeline Peyroux, while staking her claim in today’s landscape with her thoroughly original touch.\n\nExhibiting the patina of maturity, this formidable new talent’s storytelling will appeal to a wide array of music fans. The album is a melding of soul and folk similar to the feel of when Les Nubians or Sade burst onto the scene. This time, Hindi carves out her own path as she shifts seamlessly from American folk, to Paris tradition to Moroccan soul. A versatile multi-instrumentalist, Hindi has crafted her own soundtrack of soul-folk-jazz ballads with south Moroccan roots, on the cusp of African culture.\n\nHindi will be touring the US for the first time this Fall in support of Handmade, with stops in cities across the country including Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and Chicago, culminating in performances at CMJ in NYC.\n\nWATCH: Click here to see the video for album single, “Beautiful Tango”: http://www.youtube.com/HindiZahra\n\nNorth American Fall Tour Dates:\n\n9/30 Los Angeles, CA @ OohLaL.A.

In addition to bringing the new songs to cities for the first time with Release The Sunbird, he will also be playing a very special set at this year’s Outside Lands Festival on August 12th. Release The Sunbird is a side project, but it’s not. Release The Sunbird a solo project, but it’s not. This musical departure showcases a whole new side of Rogue, and is a re-introduction to an artist you thought you already knew. Rogue, who has spent years on the road with his band Rogue Wave touring with the likes of Death Cab for Cutie, Feist, Spoon, Nada Surf, The Shins, Jack Johnson and many others, is one of independent music’s most reliable musical voices. Come Back To Us, which was recorded on a whim in Bloomington, Indiana, is sun-kissed, joyful and one the loveliest you will hear this year. Live, Zach and vocalist Kate Long deliver captivating performances that are magical and heart-wrenching. Their voices blend together perfectly while singing gorgeous melodies about love, loss, memory, and the deceptive simplicity of hope, as Zach strums along on his guitar. Be sure to catch these remarkable songs live. Dates are posted below!\n\nCheck out “Always Like The Son” live HERE. http://vimeo.com/25695088\n\nPraise for Come Back To Us:\n\n“There's not a harsh note in the music of Release the Sunbird …Come Back to Us … never feels like wallpaper: For all its summery brightness, it remains as sweet as springtime, while still revealing subtle shades of autumnal melancholy. “ – NPR\n\n“…delivering low-key and soulful tracks that weave pleasant acoustic guitar melodies with soft percussion. It’s an album that takes Rogue away from the familiar efforts with Rogue Wave as it harbors eloquent and delicate melodies that pioneer a soft-spoken and delightful album. “ – CMJ\n\n“Come Back to Us is an ideal record for lazy mornings, midnight drives (especially the kind with no particular destination), and maybe even a back yard barbeque. That is to say, its easy and intimate harmonies, sweet melodies, warm guitar tones, and often gently driving pace make this the perfect record for all of the moments when we’re reminded just how good life can be.” – KCRW “…showcases a particular mastery of contemplative folk through a sepia sun-soaked lens.”- Spinner\n\nTour Dates:\n\n8/12/11 San Francisco, CA @ Outside Lands\n\n8/24/11 St, Paul, MN @ Turf Club\n\n8/25/11 Madison, WI @ East Side Club\n\n8/27/11 Chicago, IL @ Schuba's Tavern\n\n8/29/11 Arlington, Virginia @ IOTA Club & Cafe\n\n8/30/11 New York, NY @ Rockwood Music Hall\n\nCerebral Ballzy and Vice Magazine Premiere Junky For Her Video\n\nCerebral Ballzy were born and raised in East New York’s grimy core but instead of crying about it, they scream their way through a sprawling mess of 80s-hardcore and punk rock on their self-titled release which hit July 26 via Adult Swim’s Williams Street Records. The band and director Vice Cooler (Peaches, Deerhoof) came together on July 4th weekend in Costa Mesa at the Volcom House to film the video for “Junky For Her” and the finished product is a gritty throwback to 70’s gore flicks complete with slumber parties, blood, vomit and some very, very, very angry girls.\n\nVice Cooler, excited about the video and the band said ““Cerebral Ballzy are the real deal. There isn’t much division between their music and real life. Whether they were showing up completely wasted or being distracted by everything around them—skateboards, girls, and even a gun that was in the house—they kept me on my toes the whole time. Needless to say me and the crew were not shocked when Honor actually blacked out during the last scenes of him. And those scenes were the most physical and violent.” Watch the video now at Vice Magazine!\n\nLed by frontman Honor Titus and bassist Melvin Honore, Cerebral Ballzy works to restore something golden to New York’s punk rock history – balls. The bands self-titled debut features tracks like “Insufficient Fare” and “Don’t Tell Me What To Do,” telling the story of broken homes and broken bones while capturing the teenage punks’ experience growing up in the Big Apple’s rotten center. Already dubbed “New York’s next great band” by the NME, Cerebral Ballzy have toured the UK and Europe twice, performing with Anthrax, Fucked Up and OFF! and the band continues its never-ending tour, jumping headfirst off every monitor and vomiting into every pit.\n\nELEANOR FRIEDBERGER OF THE FIERY FURNACES Announces Fall Tour\n\nAfter releasing her solo debut album, Last Summer, and hitting the road for select North American dates this summer, Eleanor Friedberger has announced the dates for her upcoming fall tour.\n\nFriedberger, who is known for her work with the Chicago power-pop harmonie-musik duo The Fiery Furnaces, will be playing two nights in New York this August with Deerhunter, select west coast dates this September with The Kills, east coast dates this October with Wild Flag, and several headlining shows along the way. She will be playing songs off of her magnetic solo debut, Last Summer, which has been dazzling critics and fans alike, as well as some Furnaces’ classics with her live touring band. The album, which was just released on Merge Records, is a piece of bubbly pop magic, filled with Phil Spector harmonies, 60’s girl group shimmers, head-nodding funk, and more, all done with Eleanor’s unmistakable panache. Eleanor is a dynamic performer, maintaining her signature vocal phrasing and killer rock n’ roll moves while playing the guitar and exuding an utter charm. With over 10 years of experience under her belt touring with The Fiery Furnaces, you definitely do not want to miss out on Eleanor Friedberger live. Dates are below!

Rosi’s incredible songs and flawless vocals paired gorgeously with the umbrella tree created just-for-her in Williamsburg’s McCarren Park by The Wild Honey Pie to offer fans a first listen of two new tracks in dazzling live videos. As an added bonus for this Buzzsession, the live version of both of the tracks she performed, “Paper Tiger” and “Flicker” are available as downloads (http://www.thewildhoneypie.com/rosigolansession/).\n\nRosi's stunning sophomore effort Lead Balloon perfectly showcases the Israeli singer’s penchant for incredibly rich melodies that not only draw you in, but haunt you the next day. Produced by Tony Berg (Phantom Planet, Aimee Mann), the album moves fluidly across genres, containing songs steeped in Americana, clever pop currents running throughout, and thoughtful folk. Written over the past two years during breaks from touring, Lead Balloon perfectly captures the environment where Rosi brought each song to fruition – from the bone-damp chill of London and the constant buzz of Brooklyn to the arid wind of Los Angeles.\n\nLater this summer, Rosi will head out on the road with Jason Reeves to blow away audiences nationwide with her gorgeous live show in support of Lead Balloon.\n\nCatch Rosi On Tour This Summer With Jason Reeves:\n\n8/21/11 3rd & Lindsley Nashville, TN\n\n8/22/11 Old Rock House St Louis, MO\n\n8/24/11 Slowdown Omaha, NE\n\n8/25/11 Augustana College Rock Island, IL\n\n8/27/11 Shank Hall Milwaukee, WI\n\n8/28/11 Space Evanston, IL\n\n8/30/11 Fine Line Music Café Minneapolis, MN\n\n8/31/11 The Mill Iowa City, IA\n\n9/1/11 State Historical Bldg Des Moines, IA\n\n9/2/11 The Bottleneck Lawrence, KS\n\nTREASURE ISLAND MUSIC FESTIVAL ANNOUNCES 2011 LINEUP\n\nNo one throws a birthday bash quite like the people behind the Treasure Island Music Festival: in honor of the festival’s fifth birthday, festival producers Noise Pop and Another Planet Entertainment are proud to announce the 2011 lineup for what is undoubtedly one of the most incredible, unique music experiences of the year. Saturday will be headlined by Empire of the Sun, while Sunday will be headlined by Death Cab For Cutie; the lineup will be rounded out by the likes of Cut Copy, Explosions in the Sky, Beach House (in one of their only live shows of 2011!), Death From Above 1979, Stephen Malkmus & the Jicks, Chromeo, The Hold Steady, Dizzee Rascal (making a very rare Stateside appearance!) Flying Lotus, St. Vincent and many more. (See full list below)\n\nTwo Day Early Bird tickets will go on-sale with limited availability at a very special price of $99.00 on Wednesday, July 27th at 10am PST / 1pm EST via the Treasure Island website: http://www.treasureislandfestival.com. Once they are gone, Two Day Advance tickets ($115.00) will be available, followed by Two Day Regular tickets ($125.00) once the Advance tickets have sold out. Two Day VIP tickets ($219.00) will also be available on this day, in addition to Two Day Parking Passes ($50.00), which will be available a la carte for the first time.\n\nSingle Day VIP tickets ($119.50) and Single Day General Admission tickets ($69.50) will be made available on Friday, July 29th at 1pm EST / 10am PST. Single Day Parking Passes ($25.00) will also go on-sale on this day.\n\nSelected for its stunning, picturesque views, Treasure Island lays just off the coast of Yerba Buena Island in the San Francisco Bay. When the festival of the same name began in 2007, it quickly became one of the premiere music events of the fall concert season thanks to its consistently fresh and exciting lineups – in its five years, Treasure Island Music Festival has never repeated an act, providing a completely new sonic experience each year. Last year, a sellout crowd (for the second year in a row!) descended on the decommissioned naval base to see headliners LCD Soundsystem and Belle & Sebastian; by splitting each day into genre-specific artists – the first day features dance/electronic artists, while the second features indie rock bands – the festival has previously hosted a wide range of acclaimed artists since its inception, including MGMT, The Flaming Lips, Vampire Weekend, M.I.A., Modest Mouse, The Raconteurs, Justice, Spoon, Thievery Corporation, Girl Talk, The Decemberists and many more.\n\nIn addition to providing music lovers with the coolest artists and an incredible setting, Treasure Island Music Festival ensures that attendees never miss a note of music. With two stages that alternate between bands, rather than having them play simultaneously, concert-goers have the chance to literally hear every note of every artist for the entire weekend.\n\nFor its fifth anniversary, Treasure Island Music Festival will be pulling out all the stops!

With his iconic soulful vocals, Hall’s newest collection feels fresh and current while still maintaining his signature style and songwriting prowess. Hall was joined in the studio by co-producers Greg Bieck (Jennifer Lopez, Destiny’s Child, Ricky Martin) and Paul Pesco on the making of this album. Powerhouse producer, the late T-Bone Wolk (Billy Joel, Carly Simon, Elvis Costello), lent his expertise on stand-out tracks “Lifetime of Love”, “Wrong Side of History” and “Problem With You.” This album serves as the last project they worked on together after a prolific 30 year relationship.\n\nWhile Daryl Hall is an adored staple in America’s music scene for his work in Daryl Hall and John Oates and his already illustrious solo career, he has recently been making waves as a “tastemaker” for up and coming talent as music host and Executive Producer of his smash hit web television series, Live From Daryl’s House. He has been giving artists like Fitz and the Tantrums and Company of Thieves a chance to perform to national audiences, often for the first time. On the program, which won the 2010 WEBBY Award in the Variety category, Hall seeks out new and breaking talent and invites them to his home in Millerton, NY. One of the most unlikely collaborations that stemmed from his show was his pairing up with electro-funk duo Chromeo for a standout performance at Bonnaroo in 2010. Since its inception in late 2007, Live From Daryl’s House has since gained national distribution and will be airing in syndication beginning September 24th, 2011. www.LiveFromDarylsHouse.com\n\nDaryl Hall is the co-founder and lead singer of the “rock and soul” duo Daryl Hall and John Oates . The pair is recognized as the “Number One Selling Duo” in music history by the Recording Industry Association of America, a title they still hold today. Hall, an inductee to the Songwriters Hall of Fame, penned six songs that reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts including such classics as “Rich Girl” and “I Can’t Go For That (No Can Do)” and another five tunes that registered in the Top 10. Hall’s solo career began in the ‘70s and he has released a handful of critically acclaimed albums in that time; Sacred Songs in 1980, Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine in 1986 which spawned the No. 5 Billboard chart hit “Dreamtime”, Soul Alone in 1993 and Can’t Stop Dreaming in 1996.\n\nWith such an incredible legacy behind him and an exciting platform from which to move forward, the future is limitless for Daryl Hall. There are many new artists, some of whom he has championed on his show, who would attribute their work to the influence of the iconic songwriting and melodies that have solidified Hall as one of the most important artists in musical history. Laughing Down Crying will surely hit home with all of his loyal fans who have been waiting over a decade for his next solo effort.\n\nFull track listing:\n\n1. Laughing Down Crying\n\n2.

Noisey.com caught up with the reclusive duo to discuss their roots in the Seattle music scene, and their alignment with SubPop Records for their first full-length release: the critically lauded Black Up. The footage here not only includes the candid interview, but exclusive clips from the band's high energy set at Seattle's Neumo's venue giving fans insight into Shabazz's creative flow, but a rare glimpse at what it's like to see the band explode on stage.

WU LYF’s trans-Atlantic buzz detonated Stateside this past week as they played three intensely energetic sold-out shows in New York City and Los Angeles. The Manchester, England 4-piece are now pleased to announce a full run of North American dates, kicking off in Philadelphia on November 5th. Audiences should expect a force-field of sound filled to the brim with WU LYF’s signature uncompromising Heavy Pop. Please visit www.WULYF.org for more info.\n\nWU LYF’s debut album, Go Tell Fire To The Mountain, is set for physical release on September 6th on the band’s own imprint L Y F Recordings and is currently available via digital retailers. After sequestering themselves away inside a disused church WU LYF began creating the tracks which make up Go Tell Fire To The Mountain. During the recording period their self-produced videos - posted on their fledgling web site - attracted the immediate attention of British music fans and the UK media while a series of euphoric live performances quickly earned them a reputation as the most exciting new band in Britain. WU LYF are surrounded by a group of friends and like-minded souls who make videos, create art, take photos and make up the L Y F (Lucifer Youth Foundation).\n\nPraise for WU LYF Live:\n\n\"...their stirring debut record, Go Tell Fire to the Mountain (out now digitally), which marries the chest-thumping hollering of singer-keyboardist Ellery \"Elle Jaie\" Roberts with post-punk guitars in an anthemic brew. It was a winning combination Friday night at a sold-out Mercury Lounge in New York City.” - Spin\n\n“Those sweaty, inspired Mancs brought down the house once again last Friday night. The insanity of the heat wave outside brought out their beast within….It's those in the know who see that these guys have a fire in their heart and an album of songs that displays their intensity and passion.” – Music Snobbery\n\nWU LYF on tour in November 2011:\n\n5 – Philadelphia, PA @ Voyeur – Making Time\n\n6 – Washington, DC@ Rock N Roll Hotel\n\n8 – Brooklyn, NY @ Music Hall of Williamsburg\n\n10 – Boston, MA @ Middle East\n\n11- Montreal, PQ @ Il Motore\n\n12 – Toronto, ON @Horseshoe Tavern\n\n14 – Chicago, IL @ Empty Bottle\n\n15 – Minneapolis, MN @ 7th Street Entry\n\n18 – Vancouver, BC @ Electric Owl\n\n19 – Seattle, WA @ The Crocodile\n\n21 – San Francisco, CA @ The Independent\n\n22 – Los Angeles, CA @ The Troubadour\n\nERIKA SPRING of AU REVOIR SIMONE Releases First Solo Material with Violens\n\nFriendly Fire Recordings is proud to announce the August 2 release of a split 7\" featuring good friends and NYC buzz bands Violens and Erika Spring (of Au Revoir Simone).\n\nErika Spring Forster began writing music as part of a multimedia project in her schooldays. After graduating and moving to New York, she soon found herself performing with local outfit Dirty On Purpose. It was then that she discovered her affinity for keyboards, collecting an assortment and putting them to use composing original material. Before long she was collaborating on songs after work with a couple of similarly synth-minded girlfriends, eventually forming officially as the band Au Revoir Simone.\n\nOver the next seven years they would enjoy success, writing and recording three albums and touring extensively. In 2010 the group was put on hold so that members could focus on continuing education and starting a family. Erika took the opportunity to explore some more personal musical territory.\n\nSetting out on her own, she has taken elements of her band’s sound and spun them into her own brand of bittersweet sun-bleached pop. Breathing her vocals over mesmerizing keyboard phrases, she produces an effect that approaches the supernatural, with tough, stern beats lending gravity to the otherwise hazy, delirious songs. The music conjures scenes of blustery romance amidst the dunes, of love as a mirage, of softly raising the dead.\n\nBacked by Jorge Elbrecht of Violens on drums and Will Berman on bass, Erika fills out her sound. Under Elbrecht’s guidance as producer, she experimented with effects and instrumentation, recording a handful of tracks at his Greenpoint home studio in early 2011.v\n\nLead single “6 More Weeks”, her contribution to a split 7” with Violens (whose own song \"It Couldn't Be Perceived\" is a scorcher in its own right), features rolling toms and hovering layers of synths in a song of starless, tropical surrender.\n\nLYKKE LI Announces Fall Tour and Tonight Show Appearance\n\nAfter a sold out headlining North American tour this past May, Sweden’s Lykke Li will be returning to the States for four special shows this August, in addition to announcing the dates for her upcoming fall tour.\n\nLykke Li will be playing at Central Park’s SummerStage in New York on August 1st, followed by a stop at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on August 3rd, the House of Blues in Chicago on August 5th, and her only U.S. festival appearance at this year’s Lollapalooza on August 6th. She will be performing songs off of her critically-acclaimed sophomore release, Wounded Rhymes, which was released earlier this year and is already being called one of 2011’s best albums.\n\nIf you can’t catch Lykke Li live this time around, be sure to tune in to The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on August 4th where she will be performing the organ-driven “Youth Knows No Pain.” This hazy, 60’s-inspired tune is filled with pounding voodoo drums, girl-gang vocals and features Lykke Li’s voice sounding bigger and bolder than ever before.\n\nThe 11-date fall tour will be one of Lykke Li’s biggest North American tours to date, allowing fans that missed out on her live this past spring to finally experience her incredible presence in the flesh. As she has proven many times over, her live show is absolutely not to be missed. The dates are:\n\n8/1/11 New York, NY @ Central Park SummerStage (with Timber Timbre)\n\n8/3/11 Los Angeles, CA @ The Greek Theatre (with Best Coast and Fool’s Gold)\n\n8/5/11 Chicago, IL @ House of Blues (with Foster The People)\n\n8/6/11 Chicago, IL @ Lollapalooza\n\n11/5/11 Austin, TX @ Fun Fun Fun Festival\n\n11/7/11 Pomona, CA @ Fox Theater *\n\n11/9/11 Oakland, CA @ Fox Theater *\n\n11/11/11 Denver, CO @ Ogden Theater *\n\n11/13/11 Minneapolis, MN @ First Avenue *\n\n11/14/11 Chicago, IL @ Vic Theater *\n\n11/15/11 Toronto, ON @ Sound Academy *\n\n11/17/11 Montclair, NJ @ Wellmont Theater *\n\n11/19/11 Ashville, NC @ Orange Peel *\n\n11/20/11 Atlanta, GA @ Buckhead Theater *\n\n11/21/11 New Orleans, LA @ Tipitina’s *\n\n*with First Aid Kit\n\nNeon Indian Announces New Album and Fall Tour Dates\n\nNeon Indian is the brainchild of Alan Palomo, who's 2009 debut record Psychic Chasms not only earned the 20 year-old a spot on numerous year-end lists, but assisted the forming of a genre that, though known by a few names now (hypnagogic pop, glo-fi, chillwave), summoned a very unique and specific electro-mangled sound. Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and SPIN all praised Palomo for his adventurous new sound, and he was tapped to perform at top festivals like South by Southwest, Bonnaroo, and Sasquatch and also scored opening slots for bands ranging from Massive Attack and The Flaming Lips to Phoenix and Chromeo.\n\nAfter nearly two years on the road off the success of his debut, Palomo returns this fall with his proper follow-up LP, Era Extraña. This time around, we see a darker shaded sound document that tosses somewhere between an 8-bit shoegaze record and peering through the fence of a teenage apocalypse drive-in flick.\n\nWritten and recorded last winter in an efficiency apartment in Helsinki, Finland during its short solstice days, Era Extraña was ice sculpted from arpeggiated synth-scapes and scribbled journal entries made during his stint there alone in constant solitude. \"It's the closest you can get to feeling like you're at the edge of the earth,\" he says. \"And there were moments where I lost sight of what I was really there to do.\"\n\nThe sample-happy stylings of his previous efforts have been traded in for acid-stained commodore 64 jams (See 'Polish Girl, 'Future Sick') and bit-pulped guitar sludge ballads (see 'Hex Girlfriend', 'The Blindside Kiss'). All throughout, the undulating moods of the record are guided by a haunted three-part instrumental titled Heart: Attack, Heart: Decay, and Heart: Release. Once completed, the layers were then thawed and reassembled by Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips, MGMT), who mixed the album and did additional production with Palomo at his upstate Tarbox Studios. The album sessions there were briefly taken on a scenic detour by a drop-in four-song EP collaboration with The Flaming Lips which was released earlier this year. The album's Spanish title plays with the loose-hinges of the word extraña, which not only directly translates into 'strange', but also means to 'command the act of longing'. These themes of feeling an eerie absence in new strange times are explored throughout the album as a whole in his teenage ethos peppered lyrical musings in an end-days obsessed climate. Many of this is inspired by an ongoing love affair with the notion of what cyberpunk means in a year like 2011. The feeling can best be described in a recent interview where he noted, \"We're now living in the era mysticized by a lot of future-geared 70s and 80s cinema, but it's definitely not quite how they imagined it.\"\n\nEra Extraña is slated for a September 13th release on Palomo's own Static Tongues imprint in conjunction with Mom and Pop Records in North America, Transgressive Records in the United Kingdom and Europe, Pop Frenzy/Inertia in Australia and Big Nothing Records in Japan.\n\nPRESS MATERIALS CAN BE ACCESSED HERE – http://ge.tt/8P8dM46\n\nWatch!! ….HEART : DECAY :Part two of the haunted three-part instrumental which runs throughout\n\nTHE ETTES Release NEW Single Excuse\n\nThe Ettes have released lead single “Excuse” from the band’s fourth studio album Wicked Will (Krian Music Group/Fond Object), out August 2nd. Stream and embed the new song here...http://soundcloud.com/press-here-1/the-ettes-excuse, which is out now exclusively on iTunes. Combining fuzzy bass and searing guitars, a tell-it-like-it-is chorus and a 60s-girl-group flare, “Excuse” is the perfect introduction to an album oozing with sassy defiance and the Ettes’ one-of-a-kind rock ‘n’ roll mystique. “Excuse” has already grabbed the attention of radio programmers around the country ahead of the official radio impact date, with both KROQ and specialty radio giving the song early spins.\n\nOn August 2nd, Sympathy For The Record Industry will come out of a four-year retirement to release the limited edition vinyl of Wicked Will, produced by Liam Watson (The Kills, White Stripes). Additionally, there will be three limited edition 7” singles for the album’s closing track “The Worst There Is.” Each of the three 7” will feature cover art of each band member, with their b-side of choice. Coco Hames’ b-side is “Randy Scouse Git,” a Monkees cover. Poni Silver chose “Eat The Night,” the first song that The Ettes ever wrote and recorded, and Jem Cohen’s b-side is “Colours” by Donovan.\n\nThe Ettes are set to kick off their U.S. summer tour with two special NYC album release shows on August 2 at Mercury Lounge and August 3rd at Knitting Factory.

The headlining dates will immediately follow Matt’s cross country tour with Maroon 5 and Train, which starts on August 27th. Prior to his fall tour plans, Matt will be performing his hit single “Faster” on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on Monday, August 1st and a live performance on Fox News’ Fox & Friends morning show on Friday, August 5th! Click here... http://mattnathanson.com/2011/06/official-music-video-for-faster/ to check out the video for “Faster”.\n\nMatt’s latest album, Modern Love, was released on June 21st via Vanguard Records and debuted at #17 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, Matt’s highest chart placement to date. His first single “Faster” has spent the summer climbing the radio charts, and is currently #21 at Hot AC, # 48 at Top 40 and reached Top 5 at Triple A.\n\nModern Love comes on the heels of 2007’s break-out success Some Mad Hope, which catapulted the San Francisco-based Nathanson from darling of the touring circuit with a devoted cult following to a bonafide hit maker and one of the premiere songwriters on the music scene today. Known for his legendary live shows that are both wildly funny and emotionally provocative, Nathanson took a year off the road to record Modern Love – the first break he has taken from touring in his 15 year career. The success of Some Mad Hope and “Come On Get Higher” gave Nathanson a sense of accomplishment and confidence that allowed him to take a new approach to Modern Love, taking bigger risks and diving deeper into his vast array of musical influences. From the “Depeche Mode groove” in “Mercy (Less Drowning, More Land)” to the ecstatic opening track and first single “Faster,” to the soaring “Run,” which features Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, Modern Love is a luminous and bold departure that translates brilliantly to the live stage.\n\nwww.mattnathanson.com\n\nwww.twitter.com/mattnathanson\n\nMatt Nathanson Tour Dates:\n\n8/25 Agawam, MA @ Six Flags New England\n\n8/26 State College, PA @ Penn State University\n\nFall Headlining Tour:\n\n9/25 New Orleans, LA @ House of Blues\n\n9/27 Washington, DC @ 9:30 Club\n\n9/30 New York, NY @ Terminal Five\n\n10/1 Philadelphia, PA @ Electric Factory\n\n10/2 Pittsburgh, PA @ Diesel\n\n10/4 Buffalo, NY @ Town Ballroom\n\n10/6 Toronto, ON @ The Opera House\n\n10/8 Boston, MA @ House of Blues\n\n10/11 Columbus, OH @ Newport Music Hall\n\n10/12 Detroit, MI @ The Crofoot\n\n10/14 Madison, WI @ The Capitol Theatre\n\n10/15 Chicago, IL @ Riviera Theatre\n\n10/18 St. Louis, MO @ The Pageant\n\n10/20 Denver, CO @ Ogden Theatre\n\n10/21 Salt Lake City, UT @ Club Sound\n\n10/22 Boise, ID @ Knitting Factory\n\n10/23 Portland, OR @ Crystal Ballroom\n\n10/25 Vancouver, BC @ Venue OR Commodore\n\n10/28 Sacramento, CA @ Ace of Spades\n\n10/29 Los Angeles, CA @ Wiltern\n\n10/30 San Diego, CA @ House of Blues\n\n10/31 Phoenix, AZ @ Marquee\n\n11/2 Austin, TX @ La Zona Rosa\n\n11/4 Birmingham, AL @ The Backroom @ Workplay\n\n11/5 Nashville, TN @ The Cannery Ballroom\n\nThe Creators Project Announces New York Event Featuring Karen O Psycho Opera\n\nThe Creators Project, a global cultural and technology initiative by Vice and Intel Corporation, returns to New York this October to host a freakishly over-the-top week-long extravaganza featuring original Studio works and performances by scores of leading artists, musicians, designers and filmmakers.\n\nFollowing last year’s launch in New York, The Creators Project’s return will feature a Karen 0 psycho-opera, an assault on the tragic joys of youth. Directed by Adam Rapp, the work will be produced by The Studio, a multimillion-dollar global studio launched this year by The Creators Project that produces and distributes works from artists representing a cross-section of creative disciplines.\n\nThe New York event will be anchored by a series of original Studio works from The Creators Project which have spent the last year traveling the world and will have been showcased at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and at events in Lyon, Paris, Sao Paolo, Seoul and Beijing.\n\nEarlier this year, The Creators Project radically reinvented Coachella where it was the festival’s first-ever creative partner, collaborating with Arcade Fire, Interpol and Animal Collective, and redesigning the festival’s Main Stage.\n\nThe Creators Project launched in 2010 to support leading and emerging artists that are pushing the boundaries of creative expression through technology. Last year’s global launch in New York featured performances and works by MIA, Interpol, Mark Ronson, Die Antwoord, Spike Jonze, Nick Zinner, Radical Friend, Sleigh Bells and others.\n\nThe Creators Project kicked off its international event series this year in Paris on June 9at La Gaite Lyrique where it held a series of multimedia installations, screenings, panel discussions and live musical performances. It will move to Sao Paolo, Seoul and Beijing before traveling to New York.\n\nINTRODUCING SO AND SO\n\nWhether they’re conjuring dreamy pop harmonies or turning out soulful beats, Los Angeles based SO & SO is not your average troupe of ordinary indie pop musicians. With their debut self titled EP dropping July 26th and full-length album ASAP slated for release in Fall 2011, SO & SO transcend traditional pop and undulate gracefully from trip-hop to rock and indie pop to electro-fusion. With the incredible award winning multi-platinum producer Rob Wells (Mika, Cyndi Lauper, Stereos) on board, the California quintet comes together to exude propulsive energy that’s innovative, fresh and sonically all-their-own on this perfect introduction to what SO & SO are all about.\n\nSO & SO came to fruition when singer Amie Miriello (Dirtie Blonde) and guitarist Jay “Raisin” Dmuchowski (Dirtie Blonde) joined forces with producer Rob Wells at ATV in Canada to compose a songwriting trio and sell the tracks to other artists. However, after the first few tracks were cut they realized that they had stumbled onto something very special, a novel sound Amie describes as “sexy indie pop with real soul,” a sound they wanted to take on themselves. That batch of tunes would eventually become the inspiration for their upcoming full length, ASAP (fall), but SO & SO weren’t quite complete just yet…\n\nWhile playing a gig at LA’s Molly Malone’s, Amie stumbled upon Brandon Rogers a top 12 finalist on Season 6 of American Idol, and was immediately smitten by his effortless vocals. While Brandon was wholly focused on his solo career, he quickly recognized their special and electric vocal chemistry, accepting Amie’s offer to join SO & SO without hesitation. Drummer Adam Hanson and bassist Bana Haffar round out the band and fully connect the dots between pop palatability and dirty soul, a unique, one-of-a-kind dynamic heard throughout ASAP as well as SO & SO’s self-titled EP.\n\nTheir brilliant upcoming EP showcases a whirlwind of emotion juxtaposed with poignant poetic rumination. On “Heart Beats Slow” acoustic guitars growl into a powerful chorus, while “What’s the Use?” meanders from tripped-out electronic textures to a hand-clap fueled hook. At the heart of the music lies Amie’s entrancing croon, flares of Jay’s evocative guitar, and a dual backdrop of undeniable soul by drummer Adam and bassist Bana. Like icing on a cake, Brandon provides a decadent layer of rich, organic vocals.\n\nINTRODUCING EXITMUSIC\n\nNew York City duo Exitmusic – comprised of Aleksa Palladino and Devon Church – will release their first EP on seminal independent label Secretly Canadian this fall. The four song collection, entitled From Silence, will hit stores on October 4th.\n\nChurch and Palladino started writing together several years ago, when Church, originally from Winnipeg, moved to New York following a year teaching English in Taiwan and India. Palladino, a New York native, had been writing and recording her own songs since she was in her early teens. The pair spent pretty much all of their time creating music, but things really began to take shape when they moved to Los Angeles a year later. They began recording at home, creating music that the UK’s Supersweet Magazine described as “dark, brooding and beautiful… a living nightmare.” The duo eventually moved back to New York in 2009, and have slowly but surely been taking the city by storm with their arresting, intense live shows.\n\nFrom Silence immediately establishes the duo’s beautiful, chilling aesthetic. The songs evoke a sense of loss, disorientation, and vertigo, while pulsing forward on Church’s hazy winds of guitar squalor and bass-heavy beats. Anchoring the songs are Palladino’s otherworldly voice, with its spine-tingling vibrato and rich, emotional resonance (few can let out a wail quite like Aleksa). From the urgency of opener “The Sea,” which premiered this past June on Pitchfork to glorious response, to the haunting sway of “The Hours,” and the stunning depths of “The Silence,” From Silence is the perfect introduction to one of New York City’s most intriguing new bands.\n\nThe track listing for From Silence:\n\n1. The Sea\n\n2. The Modern Age\n\n3. The Hours\n\n4. The Silence\n\nExitmusic will be playing a special residency at NYC’s Pianos this summer, rounding out their ranks onstage to include drummer Dru Prentiss and electronic musician Nicholas Shelestak.
