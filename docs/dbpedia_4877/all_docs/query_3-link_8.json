        "text": "Narratological studies of audiovisual works often focus their analysis on theoretical abstractions. Sometimes the search for hermeneutical explanation, as Hans Gumbrecht interjects, resembles a semantic exaggeration in which the material basis (images and sounds) is reduced to mere vectors of abstract knowledge, the story. Color appears among the neglected themes, an element customarily foreign to academic analysis. This article proposes that color is strategically allocated with the intention of fostering some degree of aesthetic experience on the spectators. The very presence of color for viewers, however, will be regulated by their degree of attention and knowledge.\n\n\"Musicians and theorists such as the radiophonic pioneer Pierre Schaeffer, view the products of new audio technologies as devices whereby the experience of sound can be displaced from its causal origins and achieve new musical or poetic resonances. Accordingly, the listening experience associated with sonic art within this perspective is ‘acousmatic’; the process of sound generation playing no role in the description or understanding of the experience as such. In this paper I shall articulate and defend a position according to which an adequate phenomenology of auditory experience must refer to mechanisms of sound generation. This position is shown to follow from a phenomenology of sounds as located events and a physicalist account of auditory properties as features of the temporal development of such events.\""
