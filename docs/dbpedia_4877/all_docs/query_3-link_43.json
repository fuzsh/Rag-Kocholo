I owe a great debt to my colleague, Gilberto Perez, who, from the time this book was a mere unpublished article until its conclusion offered astute criticism and insight into the nature of film and film noir. William Gerdts lent his encyclopedic knowledge of noir and its players. Professor Thomas Leitch of the University of Delaware gave an extraordinarily accurate critique of an earlier version of the book, without which it would never have made it into print. Eddie Muller, as ever generous in his knowledge and love of film noir, provided invaluable help, as did Ted Whipple to whom I am indebted for the images, and Gary Deane. And special thanks go to Greg Clingham and Kate Parker of Bucknell University Press and to Brooke Bascietto, Liliana Koebke, and Gwen E. Kirby at Rowman & Littlefield. All the images in the book come from the archives of the Film Noir Foundation, whose help in preserving the films and assisting critics and scholars cannot be overestimated. Finally, I wish to thank Sylvia Thompson Park for her helpfulness during the final stages of bringing this book into the light.\n\nix\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb ix\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb x\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n“Is film noir a genre or a style?” —Rick Altman1\n\nWhat is film noir? Most commentators agree on the essential films that make up the category, films such as Double Indemnity (1944) and Out of the Past (1947).2 They also agree that the “movement” began in earnest in 1941 with The Maltese Falcon (the third Hollywood version), that it peaked in the late 1940s and early 1950s, that it included a semi-documentary phase, and that its classic period ended in 1958 with Touch of Evil. Every writer acknowledges the same sources of noir: German expressionism, pre-Code Hollywood, French poetic realism, the pulp fictions of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, and Cornell Woolrich. As to “causes,” there too we find the usual suspects, most of them the result of World War II: wartime gloom; reduced production budgets, angst-ridden veterans disoriented by their experiences in combat and threatened by working women; a post war boom that as it created new suburbs also destroyed the city and turned it into a dark wasteland; a new war that threatened atomic annihilation; various responses to Communism at home; a simmering dissatisfaction with the restrictions of the Production Code, and the decline of the studio system of film making. In addition, everyone seems to know what film noir means. As Nathaniel Rich puts it: Coined by French film critic Nino Frank in 1946 and popularized by French critics Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumenton in their 1955 study Panorama du film noir americain, the term describes, in its most narrow application, a series of American films made during World War II and in the years following, 1\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 1\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\npunctuated by violence and pervaded with a profound sense of dread and moral uncertainties. The heroes tend to be cynical, tough, and overwhelmed by sinister forces beyond their control. Stylistically, film noir is distinguished by its stark chiaroscuro cinematography, influenced in large part by German expressionism (many of film noir’s greatest directors, including Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, Robert Siodmak, and Edgar Ulmer had emigrated from Germany and Austria in the 1930s). Films are shot in black and white, lit for night, favor oblique camera angles and obsessive use of shadows, and, most importantly, take place in a city. Film noir tries to make sense of the complexities and anxieties of the postwar urban experience by exploring the rotten underside of the American city, the place where the American dream goes to die.3\n\nYet, despite this accurate summary of received opinion about film noir, no agreement has yet been reached about what exactly it is. As Rich said in the preface to his statement: “‘Film noir’ is itself an amorphous, foggy term.” In common usage, for instance on the Internet Movie Data Base, film noir means any black and white crime film of the 1940s and early 1950s.4 But the scholars and film critics most knowledgeable about film noir have reached no such agreement. Some consider film noir a genre; others think it a style. Robin Wood sees it as “occupying an indeterminate space between a style and a genre”5 and still others refer to it variously as a “movement,” a “cycle,” a “hybrid,” some kind of “generic field”6 or “transgeneric phenomenon”7 which defies classification. For Thomas Elsaesser it’s a “conceptual black hole,”8 and Steve Neale denies that it even existed.9 The fog generated by discussions of film noir results from arguments about genre and the relationship between it and style. By style, the critics usually mean the look of the films, in this case a number of visual motifs that bind the films together, such as night scenes, expressive camera work, and chiaroscuro. Movement is less clear to me, but I think it means a group of films having similar outlooks, such as the Italian “Neo-realist” films following World War II, or the French New Wave of the 1960s, films that have some influence on the historic development of cinema. Cycle is even less clear, but it probably means not something that goes round but a series of films with the same subject, such as Tarzan or James Bond, and in this case the hundreds of gritty crime films of the 1940s and 50s. By hybrid the critics mean a cross between two genres, in the case of film noir between detective stories and melodramas or women’s films. And as to film noir not existing, that comes from critics who complain that the name film noir was a historic afterthought, that there is nothing new in film noir, or that creating categories of this nature will get you nowhere. Left to choose between a vulgar and nondiscriminating everything and an unresolved and sophisticated ontological dispute, one is tempted to throw up one’s hands\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 2\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nand exclaim like a character in Out of the Past “I always say everybody’s right.” By far the most thorough and knowledgeable book on film noir is James Naremore’s More than Night: Film Noir in its Contexts.10 Convinced that film noir has “no essential characteristics” (5), Naremore turns away from an examination of genre and what film noir might be in its own right and looks instead at some of its contexts.11 In its relation to the world from which it arose, he considers modernism, post-war France, and the post-war United States, in particular McCarthyism. In its relation to the people who created it, he considers Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Graham Greene, as well as the studio system and left wing Hollywood screenwriters and directors. In its relation to the forms on which it is based, instead of discussing crime films in any detail, he concentrates on early film noirs such as The Maltese Falcon and Double Indemnity. He speaks of the popularity of the films, but does not spend much time on the audience. And to these basic contexts, he adds the history of this genre, which has no essentials, from the 1940s up to the late 1990s when he first published his book. In the expanded and updated edition of 2008, he continues his history into the twenty-first century. Given his dismissal of generic questions, it does indeed seem odd that he makes reference to “classic film noir” (97, 103, 139), to “the noir category” (136), to the evolution of film noir “like any other genre or style” (219) and to The Manchurian Candidate (1962) as “operating on the margins of film noir” (135). These and numerous other usages throughout the book would seem to contradict his notions about film noir’s nonexistence as a genre. Aware of the problem, Naremore says: It may seem odd, however, that after questioning most of the usual generalizations about film noir in my first chapter, I go on to use the term in a familiar way and to employ a more or less conventional historiography. I would explain the apparent contradiction by pointing out that film noir functions rather like big words such as romantic or classic. An ideological concept with a history of its own, it can be used to describe a period, a movement, and a recurrent style. Like all critical terminologies it tends to be reductive, and it sometimes works on behalf of unstated agendas. For these reasons, and because its meaning changes over time, it ought to be examined as a discursive context. It nevertheless has heuristic value, mobilizing specific themes that are worth further consideration (6).\n\nThis is a strange statement coming from someone who says in the Acknowledgements that his wife endured the process of writing the book “because she likes film noir as much as I do” (xiv). How can one like something that has no essential characteristics? Classic has thousands of applications, but film noir refers to a limited body of movies in what he himself refers to\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 3\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nas “a fully developed noir canon” (160). How can something devoid of essentials provide so many contexts as well as an “important legacy” (11)? How can one deny the existence of something and then talk about it in a “familiar way” as though after all it exists? There’s more than an apparent contradiction here. That a writer as intelligent and well informed as Naremore could breezily dismiss these problems in itself deserves some further consideration. To explain Naremore’s apparent contradiction in usage, it may help to place him in one of his own contexts. He belongs to the first generation of academic film historians. Before the late 1960s, the best writing on film came from reviewers and contributors to magazines, authors such as André Bazin, Otis Ferguson, Robert Warshow, William Pechter, Barbara Deming, and Manny Farber. But with the establishment of film history as a bona fide academic subject and the university departments that supported it, a new generation of film lovers, now with the time and money for archival research, inevitably took over the field. Most of these academicians earned their own advanced degrees in departments of English, French, or Comparative Literature, and they concentrated in the more welcoming Midwestern Universities, such as Wisconsin, Iowa, and Indiana. The Ivy League was slow to pick up the new beat, and traditional film departments such as USC, UCLA, and NYU remained more heavily committed to production than to history or theory. The rise of academic film study also coincided with the powerful influx of French theory on all aspects of culture. Semiotics and deconstruction ruled the day, and not to be familiar with Foucault, Derrida, Barthes, and Lacan, among others, marked one at the very least as ill-informed. Joining the liberating spirit of Rousseau and Marx to the iconoclasm of Nietzsche, these critics concerned themselves not so much with absolutes such as “Truth” but with disclosing the “unstated agendas” (6) and oppressive ideologies behind such concepts. Needless to say they provided strong ideological support for all 1960s and 1970s radicalism, but they also struck at an older generation of critics, most of them politically liberal, who came to be known as “structuralists,” writers such as Claude Lévi-Strauss and Northrop Frye. Whether in anthropology or literary criticism, these writers had discovered what they claimed to be basic human structures, core myths, and archetypal plots which underlay all cultural projects. Such thinking proved anathema to the new school, which far preferred historic relativism and individual self determination. As a result such structuralist thinking came to be labeled as “essentialism,” a term that had the stench of other negative terms such as sexism and racial profiling. Nothing was sacred; every received opinion came under scrutiny.12 If the world were not so imperfect, one might see the whole era as characterized by\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 4\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\na kind of intellectual paranoia, but suspicion and skepticism are better terms, and deeper readings became the order of the day. Such is the milieu which formed Naremore and other important writers on film such as Rick Altman. Thus instead of defining a term such as film noir, Naremore finds “problematizing” it (2), that is to say deconstructing it or examining its various discourses, a much more useful and sensible project. As he says: Perhaps the very word genre, with its etymological links to biology and birth promote a kind of essentialism. . . . The fact is, every movie is transgeneric or polyvalent. Neither the movie industry nor the audience follows structuralist rules, and movie conventions have always blended together in mongrelized ways (6).\n\nThat is true. Yet another fact is that moguls, audiences, and critics place movies in genres and discuss them as belonging to genres, which is what Naremore himself does throughout the book. Genre is not simply an either/or between the alleged structuralist who is too rigid and reductive and the more sophisticated critic who favors discursivity. Reductive as they may be, we cannot think or discourse without such categories. One notices that the films Naremore chooses to discuss in some detail—The Maltese Falcon, The Third Man (1949), Double Indemnity, The Blue Dahlia (1946), Crossfire (1947), Detour (1945), Kiss Me Deadly (1955), and Out of the Past—all fit snugly into the “fully developed noir canon.” When he points out that Clash by Night (1952) has “nothing specific in common with Laura (1944), even though both have been called noir” (6), I cannot help thinking that he knows that Clash by Night, lacking even a crime, has very little in common with any canonized film noir.13 Of course any film can be perceived in multiple genres. The Internet Movie Data Base, for instance, classifies Double Indemnity as “Crime—Film Noir— Thriller” and Out of the Past as “Drama—Film Noir—Thriller.” But you needn’t be a PhD to see which category is more specific and best describes it. Then, too, any critic can create genres according to subjects, themes, politics, characters, technologies, production levels, studios, stars, and dozens of other possibilities. Thus we can speak of circus films, Freudian films, radical films, biopics, early Technicolor films, B movies, Warner Brothers films, and Elvis Presley or Esther Williams films, to name but a few. Yet over time, the discussion of films has centered on what André Bazin in his famous essay, “L’Evolution du Langage Cinematographique,” called Hollywood’s “grands genres.”14 He names seven: American comedy (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington [1939]); burlesque (the Marx Brothers); the musical (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; The Ziegfeld Follies [1946]); police and gangster films (Scarface [1932], I Am a Fugitive [1932], The Informer [1935]); the psychological\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 5\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nand social drama (Back Street [1932], Jezebel [1938]); the fantasy and horror film (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde [1932 and 1941], The Invisible Man [1933], Frankenstein [1932]); and the Western (Stagecoach [1939]). Bazin wrote the earliest version of this essay in 1950. Looking over the history of Hollywood since, to these we would add science fiction, a subdivision perhaps of fantasy and horror, war films, and most importantly film noir, as witnessed by the many articles, books, and contexts it has generated. Were the critical fashion not so prejudiced against defining genres, the complexity of film noir and the diversity of films and techniques attributed to it present still further difficulties. As Rick Altman exclaims, “Is film noir a genre or a style?” (70). The answer is that it is both, the only Hollywood genre that is also a style, a period style no less. My colleague Gilberto Perez has remarked that genre is like grammar and style like rhetoric. Or to borrow terms from Altman, genre has two aspects, the “syntactic,” that is “plot structure and relationships,” and the “semantic,” “key scenes,” “character types,” and “recognizable shots” (89). In the case of film noir, the syntactic perspective enables us to see the genre more clearly, while the semantic gives us a better view of the style and its period. In this case the genre depends more on the situation and actions of the protagonist, while the style consists of dark\n\nFigure I.1.\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 6\n\nHumphrey Bogart in The Maltese Falcon\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\ncities, night clubs, detectives, femme fatales, expressionist camera work and chiaroscuro. When a writer refers to film noir, he may be referring to the genre or the style, for of course in the classic period the two accompany one another and cannot be easily separated. If conventional historiography sees the genre commencing in 1941 with The Maltese Falcon, the most astute observers have recognized Citizen Kane, released earlier in the same year, as the origin of the style. In one of his last essays, André Bazin remarked on the connection between the two: Bogart is without doubt, typically the actor/myth of the war and post-war period. I mean the period between 1940 and 1955. True, his filmography signals some seventy five films since 1930, of which forty or so predate High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon (1941). But those were only supporting roles, and it is beyond question that his character emerged with what is commonly called the noir crime film whose ambiguous hero he was to epitomize. In any case for us it was after the war and especially through the films of Huston that Bogart won such popularity. Now one is aware that the years 1940–1 remark precisely the second major state in the evolution of the American talking picture. 1941 is also the year of Citizen Kane. It must be the case, therefore, that there is some secret harmony in the coincidence of these events: the end of the pre-war period, the arrival of a certain novelistic style in cinematographic ecriture, and through Bogart, the triumph of interiorization and of ambiguity. One can in any case easily see in what respect Bogart differs from those pre-war heroes for whom Gary Cooper might be the prototype: handsome, strong, noble, expressing much more the optimism and efficiency of a civilization than its anxiety.15\n\nThere we have it from the master himself: a new period, a shift in Hollywood’s evolution, a new style, and the ambiguous noir hero who forms the center of the new, more somber genre. Naremore cites a portion of this passage (26) in his discussion of Bazin and existentialism. But instead of disputing the “essentialist” implications of what Bazin is saying, he instead comments on “ambiguity” and “interiorization,” concluding that “the themes of isolation, uncertainty, and ambiguity must have exerted a strong appeal to anyone who was wary of collective politics and inclined to treat social issues in terms of personal ethics” (26). In other words, Naremore turns Bazin’s objective description of something that happened in Hollywood in 1941 into a subjective expression of Bazin’s state of mind or world view. He then goes on to say that “During this period the younger critics at Cahiers du cinema began to project Bazin’s ideas onto Hollywood” (26). Such a misreading of Bazin stems from Naremore’s thesis that the French “invented” film noir (13, 15, 216). To be sure they gave the phenomenon the name that stuck, but as we shall argue in Chapter 3, Hollywood and the\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 7\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nmost perceptive of the critics of the era were well aware of this new breed of film. So rather than the French critics projecting their own notions onto Hollywood, Naremore, and those who take up this view, are in fact projecting their own ideas about film noir, in borrowed French terminology, back onto the French. Despite Naremore’s initial statement that film noir “has less to do with a group of artifacts than with a discourse” (11), by the end of his book he’s admitting that “If we abandoned the word noir, we would have to find another, no less problematic, means of organizing what we see.” And the final paragraph begins, “But I would also argue that even if noir is only a discursive construct, it has remarkable flexibility, range, and mythic force, maintaining our relation to something like an international genre” (276–77).16 He then concludes by suggesting that film noir has proven more lasting than Westerns: All the while, the old thrillers—one way streets and dead ends, mad love and bad love, double crosses and paranoid conspiracies, discontents in the nuclear family and perverse violence in every corner of the society—are as topical as ever and still productive of good films. (277)\n\nGiven these statements, I cannot help thinking that Naremore has a very clear idea of the genre of film noir, but the tiresomeness (276) of the debate and prevailing ideology have caused him to take another approach to the subject. So where do I come into the picture? Near the end of his book Naremore says, “We can never know exactly how audiences in the 1940s and 1950s viewed the dark movies of their day” (261). “Exactly,” maybe, but we have a pretty good idea from their own statements of what everyone from Joe Breen at the Production Code office to Barbara Deming at the Library of Congress was thinking at the time. And I, now an octogenarian, have my own memories. I was, after all, part of the audience for which these pictures were made. In contrast, then, to Naremore’s explicit thesis, I believe that the “group of artifacts” constitutes a genre, which though an idea, is an idea that can be looked at and described in its own right as well as in its contexts. Furthermore, I believe that although the French dubbed these artifacts film noir, the “idea” of noir was not a French back projection or “invention,” and that Hollywood itself was very much aware of what it was doing and what was happening. In the chapters which follow, I will attempt to define film noir as a genre, discuss the relationship between the genre and the style it adopted, and illustrate how the two played a major role in creating the period. As a genre, film noir continues on as “neo-noir,” but as a period style it remains forever fixed in the 1940s and 1950s. I suspect that if critics could free themselves from anxieties about genre as being rigid or essentialist, and if they had a better understanding of period style, an art historical concept that has\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 8\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ngone out of favor if not usage, a great deal of light would shine into the dark corners of noir.\n\nNOTES 1.

In the expanded and updated 2008 edition, he concludes by saying, “It is perhaps unimportant whether we give Mulholland Dr. [2001] a generic or stylistic label, but if we call it noir, and if film noir in its self-conscious, postmodern manifestations is occasionally capable of this kind of wrenching dramatic effect, then it remains capable of almost anything” (310).\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 10\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nChapter One\n\nTheory of Genre\n\nGenre means a type, a kind, a species, or a category. As such it is a concept or an idea. You can hold a movie in your hand, as a reel or a CD, and you can project it and make notes and comments on its content. It does not change; it is a thing. Not so with genres. Because they exist in the minds of observers, they can be invented, changed, joined with others, redefined, and also denied. They have always engaged philosophers, for they enable us to think about things. Without them we would be reduced to pointing and grunting. As Socrates explained, there is no such thing in nature as “equal,” by which he illustrated that concepts are realities and that we learn by recollection (Phaedo, 74a–75c). Theories, whether of genre or evolution, are also concepts, abstractions, not perceivable entities. Thus all seekers after knowledge have attempted to create objective categories or sciences through which they could organize their subjective perceptions, or as David Hume, the skeptical philosopher of the eighteenth century called them, “customary connections.” Following the Greeks, we call them “ologies,” meaning “knowledge of something,” as in geology, the knowledge of the earth; biology, the knowledge of living things; anthropology, the knowledge of man; psychology, the knowledge of the mind; sociology, the knowledge of society. Though from a skeptical perspective all of them are suspect and can by rigorous analysis be deconstructed, none of these branches of science or social science can exist without a common sense recognition of patterns of evidence and behavior. And so it is in with art. We needn’t be philosophers to recognize the various arts: the visual— painting, sculpture, architecture; the performing—music, dance, and drama; and the literary—poetry and prose. Right away, we notice that the categories have porous borders and cross over into one another. Architecture employs decoration, so sculpture and painting enter the picture. Paintings can contain 11\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 11\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n12\n\nChapter One\n\nsculptural elements, and sculptures have been painted or otherwise colored. Dance, drama, and certain forms of music, are also visual. Drama in turn is a form of literature, and poetry and prose often depend on how a work is printed. In art, it would seem, transgression is the rule, but then no work can transgress without recognizable boundaries to begin with. Thus, genre and innovation depend on one another. Not infrequently two genres hybridize and create a new genre, as when oratorio and drama joined to form opera. Such was the creation of cinema, which combined visual, performing, and literary arts with the new technology of “motion pictures.” If we consider for a moment a large category such as painting, we quickly see into how many categories it can be subdivided. For instance, mediums such as oil, watercolor, tempera, and acrylic can be applied to canvas, wood, metal, clay, or mixed with plaster. Art historians divide paintings into periods and styles, and then argue over their decisions. When it comes to painting, the term genre can refer to a Dutch tavern scene or to any gathering of ordinary people, but it also refers to types of subject matter such as history, landscape, portrait, and still life. To these categories modern studies have added ones of patronage and usage, and we think of religious art, courtly art, and public art. Film, as a newcomer to the arts, presents some special problems, the first being “Qu’ est-ce que le cinema?” as Bazin phrased it, or “what is it?” Adding to Bazin’s own answers which centered on film’s relation to reality, Gilberto Perez, through his discussion of major directors has placed film in its various contexts, such as its relationship to landscape and theater.1 Christian Metz, another major theorist, has demonstrated that film does not have a unique language of its own, but consists of some eight autonomous segments, ranging from shot to sequence.2 In an article entitled “Pure Cinema,”3 I attempted to describe what to me seemed the three main types of film, namely, documentary, avant-garde, and fictional narrative, the proponents of each type imagining that they alone made the pure thing. As with other categories, these also cross over into one another, though for the most part one can distinguish among them. The third type, fictional narrative, commonly known as the movies, has proven by far the most popular and has spawned the most sub-species. It is here that we find not only Bazin’s “grands genres” but also film noir. And it is on this level that most discussions of film genre take place. The most challenging of the many studies is Rick Altman’s Film/Genre. As something of an iconoclast, Altman wishes to overthrow the notion that genres are permanent, transcendent entities. Instead he favors “problematizing” genres, that is, challenging received opinions about them. He notes, for instance that even as fixed a genre as the musical was not at first perceived by that name, but rather as “musical romances,” “musical dramas,” or “back stage comedy” (32). Typically, he argues, a genre begins as an adjective and\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 12\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nTheory of Genre\n\n13\n\nonly later becomes a noun (50). This process was also true of the Western, another fixed genre that proves on closer analysis anything but fixed (34–38). He also favors “discursivity,” that is, looking at genres from different angles and perspectives. For instance, he points out that critics see a family of films having similar qualities or conventions, but producers are looking at what succeeds and how to repeat that formula while adding new elements that will give their product a competitive edge over their rivals (38). Advertisements for films consistently appeal to what the critics would see as several genres, usually combining thrills with romance (54–62), as in the poster that provided the title for Pauline Kael’s book, Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang.4 Through this discursive method, any film can be seen as fitting into a multitude of genres, while the genres themselves constantly shift and hybridize. Genres then should be seen not only in their own right but, as Naremore illustrates, in other contexts. As much as one admires the freshness and depth of Altman’s theorizing and his genuine contribution to genre studies, one cannot overlook some overreaching and flaws in his presentation. For instance, I have trouble with his notion that following Aristotle, “Horace sets up a simple generic model for the ages: poets produce by imitating a predefined original sanctioned by the literary-critical oligarchy” (4). One of the myopic neoclassic critics mentioned by Altman is Alexander Pope. In 1711 he published an imitation of Horace’s Ars Poetica entitled An Essay on Criticism.5 To be sure he asserts that “Those RULES of old discover’d not devis’d, Are Nature still, but Nature Methodiz’d” (88–89) and that “Nature and Homer were . . . the same” (135). Yet, alongside such neoclassicism, we also discover a great deal of “discursivity”: You then whose Judgment the right Course wou’d steer, Know well each ANCIENT’S proper Character, His Fable, Subject, Scope in ev’ry Page, Religion, Country, Genius of his Age: Without all these at once before your Eyes, Cavil you may, but never Criticize. (118–23)\n\nEach of these represents a discourse and introduces relativity not transcendence into the discussion. As to the rules, here is perhaps Pope’s most famous dictum: If, where the Rules not far enough extend, (Since Rules were made but to promote their end) Some Lucky LICENSE answers to the full Th’ Intent propos’d, that License is a rule.\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 13\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n14\n\nChapter One\n\nThus Pegasus, a nearer way to take, May boldly deviate from the common Track. Great Wits sometimes may gloriously offend, And rise to Faults true Critics dare not mend; From vulgar Bounds with brave Disorder part, And snatch a Grace beyond the reach of Art. (146–55)\n\nIt would seem that Pope too is aware of the hybridization, the crossing of boundaries, the instability of genres, and the critics need to be aware of them. Since Altman acknowledges postmodernism’s “distaste for totalizing discourse” (7), we are not surprised to see him dispute with Northrop Frye. He lumps Frye with others who lift generic texts “out of time” and place them “in a timeless holding area as if they were all contemporaries. . . . [T]his synchronic approach strips away historical differences” (19). Later he remarks that “the myth oriented rediscovery of genre criticism . . . jeopardized our ability to think of genres as anything other than the stable manifestations of more or less fundamental and permanent human concerns” (49). “Once filled by prayer, the role of mediating between man and the eternal has now fallen to genre” (50). By genre here, Altman means archetypes and basic myths, not the Western, the musical, or the biopic. And he hits upon the implication of all such structural studies, namely that humans possess some kind of imaginative DNA, common to all cultures. We are not blank tablets as Locke would have it, but pre-coded with innate ideas, or more frightening, made in the image of God. Altman, like other post modernists, does not need to argue with these structuralists or attempt to refute them. Rather such notions are too heinous, too antithetical to contemplate and just stating them or revealing them serves to refute them. But why? Why can’t we have archetypes and discursivity? Why make an either/or argument, along the lines of heredity vs. environment? Why insist on one at the expense of the other? Altman here displays some of his own rigidity. He’s absolutely right in drawing attention to what Frye calls “the stubborn structure” of the archetypes. But he completely ignores what Frye calls “the Theory of Modes,” namely the variations of those structures in different periods of history. Rather than acknowledge Frye’s “problematizing” of these structures, he prefers to set up a straw man. Strictly speaking, Frye’s four archetypal plots are genres or types of plot. But as archetypes they do not preclude the instability of what we commonly call genres, their rise or fall, their hybridization and mutations, their historic and institutional causes, the subjectivity of their definitions, or our ability to find the hidden agendas which give them support. Genres such as the epic, the novel, the Western, and film noir are not archetypal. On this level of genre, there is no such thing as essential or timeless, but rather historic phenomena\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 14\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nTheory of Genre\n\n15\n\nwhich the genres themselves do much to interpret and explain. Every era creates genres; all artists make use of them, but their only constant is mutability. What Frye would insist upon, and illustrate for that matter, is that any genre which tells stories, any narrative, will, upon analysis, reveal its stubborn structure. As outrageous as that may sound, it is true. Or rather I should say that for more than fifty years now I have yet to find any narrative work from any time or culture that does not build upon or utilize his archetypal plots. From comic books to grand opera, from Hollywood to Bollywood, one can, if so inclined, discover them, and the best a post modernist with a distaste for totalizing discourse can do is categorically reject them as irrelevant or not worth considering because of their hateful essentialist implications. At one point in his argument Altman examines a statement by Wittgenstein about “family resemblances” (83). Needless to say he is skeptical about the permanent implications of such an idea, so following Wittgenstein’s own advice to look rather than think about such things, he goes to the supermarket to examine what are labeled as nuts (86–89). Immediately he sees that the word refers to all kinds of nuts which come in a variety of packages and are associated with mixes and cooking oils. At home, he discovers that the nuts he has bought are shelved according to differing ideas than the ones in the store, and on an additional trip to the warehouse he sees that nuts and oils, placed together at the market, are stored in completely opposite locations. To top it all off, he reads an encyclopedia and finds out that cashews are fruits and peanuts legumes. From all this looking, he reaches some general hypotheses, the concluding one stating that “The perceived nature and purpose of genres depend directly and heavily on the identity of purpose of those using and evaluating them” (98). From here, after a short consideration of a commonly accepted genre such as the Western, he states: When we look more closely at generic communication, however, it is not sharing and understanding that appear, but competing meanings, engineered misunderstandings and desire for domination rather than communication. . . . [G]enres must be seen as a site of struggle among users. Our challenge is to discover the ways in which the authors and consumers of generic terminology disguise their interests and activity (99).\n\nTwo observations: First, Altman unintentionally engages in what William Empson called “double irony.”6 Empson used the term to describe how Fielding made fun of Richardson’s conventional morality, but through the unfolding of the plot, especially having to do with incest, he comes around to supporting Richardson’s views. In Altman’s case, irony one results from the deconstruction of the commonly used category of nuts, but irony two results from the fact that despite all the problematizing and discursivity about nuts,\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 15\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n16\n\nChapter One\n\nthe category stands and neither the supermarket nor the consumer will have any difficulty in using it. Second, Altman, a true man of the 1960s, leaps from nuts, an innocent grouping relatively free of disguised interests, to the cultural anxiety of conspiracy theory. Let us then look at the Western from Altman’s and Frye’s points of view. Rather than one large permanent category, Altman points out how the alleged first Western, The Great Train Robbery (1903) was not perceived as a Western at all, but rather as a railway or crime film (34). A few years later they became known as “cowboy films” as opposed to “noble Indian” films (36–37). And once critics had consolidated these types into the Western, one cannot help noticing the many trail mix variations: musical Westerns such as The Harvey Girls (1946), The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend (1949), and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954); burlesques such as Laurel and Hardy’s Way Out West (1937), the Marx Brothers’ Go West (1940), and Cat Ballou (1965); and contemporary and rodeo Westerns such as Lonely Are the Brave (1962), The Lusty Men (1952), and Junior Bonner (1972). When considering dominant views and ideology one must consider films such as The Virginian (1929) in which Eugene Pallette remarks that we “must turn this prairie into the United States of America,” and other nationalistic epics ranging from The Iron Horse (1924) to Union Pacific (1939) and Western Union (1941), the latter two appearing after a drought of A Westerns at a time when the United States was coming under threats from abroad. One can still distinguish between gunfighter Westerns, the kind Robert Warshow, at the outset of the Cold War, saw as central to the genre,7 and the multitude of Indian Westerns from Broken Arrow (1950) on that appeared in the 1950s, films dealing with race relations in what must be considered as a displaced and allegoric treatments of black and white tensions at the outset of the Civil Rights Movement. What politics lie behind wilderness vs. civilization Westerns, law and order Westerns, cattlemen vs. sheep herder Westerns, land and water right Westerns? Why did Westerns prosper during the Roaring ’20s, making Tom Mix one of the most popular box office stars of the time, and then during the Depression decline into B movies and serials whose audiences tended to be juvenile, rural, and southern? How were Monogram and Republic, the two minor studios who made most of these films, financed? What arrangements did they make with the major studios for distribution, the use of studio ranches, and the hiring of wranglers, stunt men, and equipment? What economic or personal factors influenced changing locations from the San Fernando Valley to Old Tucson, Lone Pine, or the Monument Valley? Then as to the stability of the established genre, who is not aware of how the 1960s transformed the seeming pride in the national epic of the winning of the west into the shame of greed, corruption and genocide? In an\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 16\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nTheory of Genre\n\n17\n\nearly article I called this “The Losing of the West,”8 resulting in films such as Little Big Man (1970), McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971), and Dances with Wolves (1990), in which the cavalry turns villainous and the town remains corrupt, the protagonist but adding to the mess, his girlfriend not a virgin but a prostitute. At present, the Western has altogether disappeared from view. Its last great star, Clint Eastwood, has turned to urban problems. The most famous, most written about of all the genres, is anything but impermeable and transcendent. Yet all this mutability cannot do away with Frye’s stubborn structures. On the whole, Westerns favor, or used to favor, the plot of romance. Here a group of primarily good people—there’s always an innocent heroine and domestic animals—led by a hero, set out on a quest—the wagon train west. En route they meet and overcome obstacles, wicked men, swollen rivers, deserts, and hostile Indians spurred on and misled by the wicked white men, but in the end they reach their goal, the green world of some happy valley in the Promised Land. Such is The Covered Wagon (1923) and all its successors. Or another group led by a scout or some such Natty Bumpo type of heroic frontiersman sets out to build a railroad or string the telegraph. They too meet all sorts of obstacles, including those wicked whites and deluded Indians, but in the end complete their task and drive the golden spike uniting a now harmonious community or country, as in John Ford’s The Iron Horse. Another favorite version of the plot of romance consists of some kind of Captain Virility, a Hopalong Cassidy, Lone Ranger, or Singin’ Sammy who, fully formed as a hero, rides into a town and rids it of a nest of vipers or defends the innocent but plucky virgin from the sexual and land-encroaching villain. With a slight twist, this story turns into a plot of comedy. Here the protagonist, as in Destry Rides Again (1940), begins as an eiron, an anti-hero, who enters a corrupt town run by some male blocking figure, a corrupt land owner or political boss, and after suffering numerous humiliations, rises to cleanse the town and in most instances wins the love of a threatened young woman. Tragic plots, though more rare, also occur. Gary Cooper portraying Wild Bill Hickok in The Plainsman (1936) meets a tragic end as does Tyrone Power in Jesse James (1939), Gregory Peck in The Gunfighter (1950), Burt Lancaster in Apache (1954), Paul Newman in Left Handed Gun (1958), and John Wayne, in his last film, The Shootist (1976). As to plots of irony, seemingly antithetical to American optimism and the myth of the west, these too abound. Here psychologically troubled protagonists never escape from a fallen or “mad” world where “blocking figures” and oppressive laws win out in the end. Not surprisingly, such films became common during the period of film noir, starting with The Oxbow Incident (1943) and are now commonly referred to as “noir Westerns,” films such as Pursued (1947) and The Naked Spur (1953).\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 17\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n18\n\nChapter One\n\nAltman and Frye, discursivity and structuralism, rather than contradicting one another can both be useful in the analysis not only of individual works but also of genres. Armed with this hypothesis, let us turn to a consideration of film noir as a genre.\n\nNOTES 1. Gilberto Perez, The Material Ghost (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998). 2.

It plays a prominent role in all genres, and is almost as common to drama as conflict itself. When it comes to the movies however, crime commonly refers to a family of films, all of them in contemporary settings. So many examples offer numerous discursive possibilities. Arthur Lyons, for instance, lumps all B movie crime films into the noir category.1 One thinks of caper or heist films, newspaper crime fighters, prison films, spies and secret agents, to name but a few other possibilities. Bazin designated police and gangster films as one of his “grands genres.” I would break that down into two subordinate genres, gangsters and police, depending on the main characters who typically meet different fates, death or triumph. The gangster film, despite numerous precedents, became a full-fledged genre early in the Depression, primarily through the example and success of three classics, Little Caesar (1931), The Public Enemy (1931), and Scarface. In his famous essay, “The Gangster as Tragic Hero,” (1948) Robert Warshow endowed them with critical respectability,2 unlike the Hayes Office which in the early 1930s attempted to suppress them or change their nature. The New Deal, with its optimism and faith in progressive government, gave rise to a counter genre, the G-Man or gangbuster film. People now tend to praise the New Deal and look down on the Production Code Administration, which did to gangster films what the newly formed FBI attempted to do to public enemies. Yet the Roosevelt Administration and the Roosevelts themselves, particularly Mrs. Roosevelt, fully and directly supported the Code and its aims.3 In Hollywood the New Deal meant a shift from fallen women to child stars, from Mae West to Shirley Temple. Despite the cleanup, however, the gangster film and the gangsters survived, but so then did the gangbusters, especially in the multitude of police and law enforcement procedural films which filled post-war screens. 19\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 19\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n20\n\nChapter Two\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, with films such as Bullitt (1968), The French Connection (1971), and Dirty Harry (1971) the police procedural took a new turn. Now instead of departmental know how and collective derring-do, a lone cop finds himself caught between the crooks outside the department and the crooks and corrupt city officials within, a trap from which there seems no escape. I called this “the Police State.”4 This development may well be a trend or series and not an enduring genre, for lately such films have disappeared from view, one of the last being L.A. Confidential (1997). Commonly referred to as a “neo-noir,” in large part because of its setting in the classic noir period, in my discourse it is more a “police state” type since almost all the conflict occurs within the L.A. department. A third genre or type, very popular in the 1930s, was the mystery or “Whodunit.” These featured a super sleuth: Philo Vance, Sherlock Holmes, Ellery Queen, Perry Mason, Charlie Chan, Mr. Moto, the Saint, the Falcon. Rather than being somber or threatening, many of them were lighthearted and comical. The Thin Man (1934), starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, was typical of this type. Focused more on the romantic relationship between the stars and their post Prohibition drinking habits than on the crimes, it can just as easily be considered a screwball comedy. Five sequels followed. These were all based on Dashiell Hammett’s last novel. With Hammett we turn to the question of whether film noir spreads itself all over the family of crime films or is a genre in its own right. By widespread consensus, film noir begins to come into focus in October, 1941 when Warner Brothers’ released the third version of his novel The Maltese Falcon (1930). That the two earlier versions did not establish a genre illustrates the importance of period in the creation of film noir and how intermingled are period and genre in its history. The first version of 1931 starred Ricardo Cortez. But instead of being cynical and hard boiled or world weary, he plays Sam Spade as a leering womanizer who lives in an elegant apartment, more suitable to Philo Vance or Sherlock Holmes than Spade. Bebe Daniels, in playing the femme fatale Miss Wonderly, appears repeatedly in lingerie, in a bathtub, and never loses an opportunity to display her cleavage. In short, this Falcon displays many of the conventions of pre-Code Hollywood. Not so the 1936 version, Satan Met a Lady, starring Warren William and Bette Davis. This interprets the Falcon as a screwball comedy, in the then very popular manner of Frank Capra. The woefully miscast William cavorts about in an oversize hat and at one point comically (except it is not funny) pulls a beret over the head of the Wilmer Cook substitute. The names of the characters have all been changed, but the British comedian and comic butler Arthur Treacher plays the Joel Cairo part and Alison Skipworth, one of Hollywood’s grande dames, plays the fat man. It’s a catastrophe which even Bette Davis cannot salvage.\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 20\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nFilm Noir: The Genre Defined\n\n21\n\nNo wonder then that on the eve of America’s entry into World War II a more somber Hollywood could be persuaded by John Huston to attempt a faithful version of the classic novel, this time with a cast, fortunately headed by Humphrey Bogart (George Raft turned down the part), who embodied perfectly Sam Spade and the type of the hard-boiled protagonist. It made him a star. This tough, wise cracking private eye, dwelling in a grungy no man’s land between the criminals and the incompetent and corrupt authorities, represents something new in crime films. Borde and Chaumenton saw its hero, unlike previous crime fighters, as “barely distinguishable from the classic gangster.”5 What makes Sam Spade and his offspring different is not just the down and out milieu of the dark city, the femme fatale, and the double cross, but the fact that the hard-boiled protagonist becomes enmeshed in the treachery and falsehood of the other characters, most often through his sexual involvement with a female client or prime suspect. This never happens to the super sleuths, though some like Holmes and his precursor, Poe’s Dupin, can identify with the mind of the criminal. This involvement in the lives of the criminals ensures that this new kind of detective remains in the foggy, nightmare world between the criminals and the law. As Louis Markos aptly puts it, he solves the crime “by physically and emotionally entering into the morally ambiguous realm of the criminal, a sort of Dantean descent into the underworld. . . . Indeed the detective at times seems as corrupt as the criminals he is tracking down.”6 Following this lead, Karimi, Schatz, and Luhr7 all look to the hard-boiled detective film or what Krutnik calls the “tough crime thriller”8 as central to any generic framework for film noir. Such a definition makes more sense than other efforts, such as equating film noir with “realism”9 or, as is often the case, with any 1940s crime film. Schatz believes that the detective film is the genre and that film noir is the style, a style derived from Citizen Kane.10 Here we encounter the two meanings of film noir—a genre or a style. The majority of those attempting to define the genre, as well as those who deny that noir can be a genre, look at the main characters and the subjects, what Altman would call the syntactic qualities of the film. Schatz and also Luhr look at the visual style as definitive. We shall have more to say about these distinctions later. One can construe hard-boiled detective films as a genre—why not? Its wisecracking tough guy protagonist makes them easy to identify. But neither such films nor the visual style and narrative structures of Citizen Kane fit all the films commonly alleged to be film noirs. Thus numerous critics balk at seeing noir as a genre, claiming it is too amorphous to qualify. Krutnik and Neale make the case very well. A claim that film noir centers on the hard-boiled detective excludes Double Indemnity and such noir stalwarts as\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 21\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n22\n\nChapter Two\n\nDetour, The Killers (1946), Criss Cross (1949), D.O.A. (1950), and Sunset Boulevard (1950), to name but a few. A claim that noir centers on a femme fatale omits Laura. A claim that it centers on a visual style leaves out The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). If it centers in a dark city, there’s no place for They Live by Night (1949) and Gun Crazy (1950). If noir depicts a fallen world and employs tragic and ironic plots, so do gangster films and many melodramas. So-called noir films exhibit great differences in their treatment of sexuality and gender. Male anxiety exists in other genres and many other types of film use flashbacks and the other narrative and visual devices claimed for film noir. No group of films, not even a single film encompasses all the characteristics of film noir.11 Double Indemnity lacks a nightclub and dark city corruption; there’s no psychiatrist in Out of the Past. And so it goes, whatever defining characteristic one sets up serves only to marginalize some noir films that other critics find essential. Unlike the gangster film, the Western, and the war film, film noir, so the argument goes, cannot be defined by a character, a locale, or a subject.12 Understandably then, English speaking scholars have been debating noir’s identity ever since the 1970s when the French term came into popular usage, thanks largely to Paul Schrader’s “Notes on Film Noir,”13 and have fallen back on “movement,” “cycle,” “series,” “hybrid,” among other such nomenclatures, to describe this “transgeneric phenomenon.” The discussions then have resulted not in consensus but rather in a kind of exhaustion which has favored either the solution offered by James Naremore or the dismissal of the problem from those who don’t want to listen to scholarly quibbles and say “Let’s just enjoy the films; we know which ones they are.” Undaunted by these problems, a number of critics still consider it a genre. Robert Porfiro favors film noir as either a hybrid genre created out of preexisting categories and as a response to the Production Code or as a genre “in the broadest sense as a ‘sort’ or species of film not strictly defined.”14 Mark T. Conard believes that an existential “mood and sensibility” characterize film noir, but that the same Nietzschean philosophy which created such a mood also makes noir impossible to define.15 James Damico makes the best effort. He takes a Stanley Cavell–like approach, that is, one that limits a genre to a few perfect examples, and offers a more restricted definition: briefly, a world-weary man meets a femme fatale who leads him and herself into crime and destruction.16 That Damico’s list omits Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe is not the strange oversight one might at first believe. Although Hammett and Chandler cannot be overestimated as major sources of film noir, the films based on their novels are not essential to the genre. To be sure Hammett gave us the cynical hardboiled investigator who himself is morally flawed amidst a cast of scoundrels\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 22\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nFilm Noir: The Genre Defined\n\n23\n\nand a fallen world. The third version of The Maltese Falcon justly shares credit for initiating the disputed category. But had it never been remade, Citizen Kane, which was released five months earlier, by itself popularized the visual style and narrative conventions associated with film noir. And I Wake Up Screaming (1941) released but thirteen days after The Maltese Falcon, joined by Double Indemnity, Laura, and Phantom Lady (1944) would have raised considerations about a new wave of crime films. Of these, Double Indemnity is by far the most important, for, as Sheri Chinen Biesen has shown, it was this film more than any other that brought the new genre into contemporary consciousness.17 Raymond Chandler gave us the seedy, corrupt dark city and a wise cracking hero, but in his novels and the screenplays based on them during the classic period of noir, the hero never falls. Strange though it may seem, Chandler’s screenplays, Double Indemnity, The Blue Dahlia, and Strangers on a Train (1951) are much more central to the notion of film noir than the films based on his novels. As Chandler wrote in The Simple Art of Murder, “But down these mean streets a man must go who is not mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid.”18 Chandler’s statement provides the clue we have been looking for—“tarnished.” It helps us define the noir protagonist, a man or woman who is “tarnished, that is to say “fallen,” not an innocent hero like Philip Marlowe but someone like Sam Spade who crosses a moral boundary and becomes—if not the criminal himself—enmeshed and tainted by criminality. Remember that Spade had been sleeping with the wife of Miles Archer, his murdered partner, and then commences an affair with the murderer, Bridgid O’Shaughnessy. If one goes over the list of films proposed for the “canon,” one finds again and again a protagonist who has taken a false step, attempted a cover up, become an accomplice, or in some way fallen into crime. Either he or she commits the crime or in some way, through chance, a mistake, a moral lapse, or bad decision, becomes implicated in it, most often as the chief suspect. Admittedly some of the most interesting protagonists—Sam Spade or Jeff Markham in Out of the Past or Scotty Ferguson in Vertigo (1958)—are detectives. But other professions, types of work, or stations in life fit just as well. To illustrate the point, I list below but one single example of the range of occupations we find in classic film noir.

Film noir can happen to anyone. It is a situation. As Eddie Muller points out, “what characterizes genuine noir is not the depth of depravity a writer is willing to depict, but rather the depth of empathy he or she brings to characters who, through a twist of fate or their own destructive nature, face dire, life and death situations.”19 Roger Ebert put it this way: film noir “is a movie where an ordinary guy indulges the weak side of his character and hell opens up beneath his feet.”20 Foster Hirsch in his Film Noir: The Dark Side of the Screen (1981),21 one of the first American books on film noir and still the best introduction to the subject, did not strain to define the genre but took a common sense approach, discussing its sources, conventions, and the films that best exemplified them. Lately, however, in the third edition of his book (2008), fully aware of the years of debate, he writes, “Despite some qualms, my own sense is to anoint noir as a genre.” For him “a film with a crime scene, a neurotic protagonist, and a menacing atmosphere is on its way to grabbing the prize.”22 He or she is not necessarily neurotic as Hirsch suggests,\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 24\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nFilm Noir: The Genre Defined\n\n25\n\nbut the fall does serve to bring out the darker side of his or her psyche. And lately, Naremore remarks that “Noir tends to be about losers and has never been accused of promoting moral uplift or the American dream. It certainly isn’t a proletarian art, but its protagonists are very often social outsiders or criminals.”23 Film noir then can be defined by a subject, a locale and a character. It consists of all three. Its subject is crime, almost always a murder but sometimes a theft. Its locale is the contemporary world, usually a city at night. Its character is a fallible or tarnished man or woman. From these givens, from this situation, an investigation almost always ensues which further involves the protagonist as it unravels the web of misadventures. Not all investigators are private eyes or cops. He might be a supporting character, an insurance investigator such as Edward G. Robinson in Double Indemnity or Edmond O’Brien in The Killers. He might be a reporter, such as John Derek in Scandal Sheet or a returning veteran, keen on discovering what happened to a friend or relative, as in Cornered (1945), Act of Violence, and Dead Reckoning, both of 1947. Not a few noir heroes are amnesiacs carrying out an investigation leading to themselves, such as John Hodiak in Somewhere in the Night (1946) and John Payne in The Crooked Way (1949). Most ironic of all, of course is\n\nFigure 2.1. The Investigator: Edmond O’Brien in The Killers\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 25\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n26\n\nChapter Two\n\nEdmond O’Brien in D.O.A., a business man who sets out to investigate his own murder. Whether it leads to punishment and doom or redemption is not as important to the genre as there being an investigation. Such then are the components which make up the genre of film noir: a crime, a fallible protagonist, a contemporary setting, and, usually, an investigation by someone or some agency, not necessarily the protagonist. In the classic period, this situation gives rise to a typical cast, no one type of character being absolutely essential to the genre. In addition to the fallible protagonist and the investigator, one is likely to find a femme fatale, a conventional girlfriend or wife, a psychopath, numerous police (good and bad) corrupt politicians, gangsters or criminals, not as protagonists but as villains or obstacles, returning G.I.s, and a psychiatrist. There is nothing new in this combination. It occurs in Oedipus Rex,24 Hamlet, and Crime and Punishment, three of the most outstanding examples. Two of course are plays, tragedies in fact, and the other is a novel. But film noir applies to the movies, quite a different means of presentation. It also applies to a group of films, a large and distinguished group. And it also applies to the milieu of the crime, the fallen world of the dark city which like the social environment of the naturalist novel envelopes the protagonist and contributes to his fate. It is at this point that the genre of film noir and the style of film noir merge. So, Nino Frank and the other French observers didn’t get it wrong. They were just the first to give the name that stuck to those films of the early 1940s which embodied conventions that set them apart from previous crime films. Of course there were predecessors. Aren’t there always? One thinks of Fritz Lang’s M (1931) and You Only Live Once (1937), among others, but as with the early novels, these were not a group but isolated examples that fit into other categories such as social anatomy or gangster films, whereas the noirs came as a barrage, an explosion on the screen, of crime and betrayal, not unlike the gangster and fallen women films of the early 1930s. Thus, when these characteristics—crime, faulty and morally confused protagonist living in the contemporary world, and an investigation—are complemented by chiaroscuro, expressionistic camera work, dark city and night settings, and narrative devices such as the voice over and flashback, all elements of the noir style, we know that, unlike the characters, we are safe within this NEW genre. If no single element of noir is new, what is new is the concentration of such elements in crime films and the shift in Hollywood conventions which they represent. In the 1930s, Hollywood gave us heroes and heroines who were resourceful, energetic and interesting, but, on the whole, innocent. If they fell, as in the gangster films, one could usually blame society and the class system. The protagonists of the 1940s are not only confused but culpable, and if they fall, it’s their own fault, or it’s because the mistakes\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 26\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nFilm Noir: The Genre Defined\n\n27\n\nof a former time catch up with them. Rather than being the opposite of the villain, as in the 1930s, the hero or heroine becomes his mirror image, secret sharers of the same dilemma, usually some sexual obsession or disorientation. Femme fatales abound in 1930s films—think of Claire Dodd—but she is always less glamorous or appealing than the heroine—think of Joan Blondell or Irene Dunne. That film noir arrived without the benefit of a new theory or new techniques of film making reminds one of the seventeenth century artists who changed the look of painting and created the Baroque style without altering the theory of art, the means of production, or the technique of painting as developed in the Renaissance. Like the Baroque, film noir also followed a classic period and has been called by both admirers and critics decadent. But to me the most compelling proof that film noir is a bona fide genre is its reemergence in the 1970s in what the critics have dubbed “neo-noir.”25 Film noir was not just a period phenomenon but a genre that can be reinterpreted for a later era. In the history of art we see similar phenomena. Whereas some genres, such as the masque, have a relatively short life span, arising and dying within a specific period, others live on. Thus opera, a creation of the Baroque and a quintessential Baroque form, survived the seventeenth century and adapted itself to other periods. Likewise, the novel, a Rococo creation, lived on long after the period which established it became synonymous with frivolity and decadence. It too adapted.26 So film noir soon reappeared, changed somewhat but remaining noir nevertheless. Though born out of the anxiety, despair, gloom and tragedy of the 1940s, it adapted to the paranoia and Weltschmerz of our times. Todd Erickson presents a variation on this idea, contending that the original “movement” (by which he means period style) of noir later became a genre.27 But it was a genre to begin with, the sure sign of which is that artists from a later era continued to use it. In neo-noir we immediately recognize the favorite noir subjects: the private eye, somewhere in between the police and the criminals as in Kill Me Again (1989); the cop who becomes enmeshed with the femme fatale, as in Klute (1971) and Basic Instinct (1992); the so-called normal guy who goes over the edge as in Body Heat (1981) or makes a bad decision as in No Country for Old Men (2007); the sympathetic couples who have become involved in crime and are on the run, as in Badlands (1973) and Thelma & Louise (1991); the psychopathic protagonist only slightly more deranged than the world he inhabits, as in Taxi Driver (1976) and Falling Down (1993); the anatomy of the conventional town, as in Blue Velvet (1986); the private lives of petty criminals and losers as in The Grifters (1990), One False Move (1992), and Pulp Fiction (1995); and finally the seemingly dead man who through flashbacks seeks comprehension and revenge as in Point Blank (1967), a film considered by many the first neo-noir. In addition, old film noirs, such as Out of the Past have been remade,28 and several new ones, such as Chinatown\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 27\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n28\n\nChapter Two\n\n(1974) are set in the classic noir period. One of these, Devil in a Blue Dress (1995), for the first time features a black private investigator who discovers racism at the heart of the crime. So the genre persists, but not the style. Visually, neo-noirs differ because they are filmed in color and favor brightness over chiaroscuro. Rather than the city at night, the favorite image of a dangerous wasteland has switched to the desert. The Great Basin of Nevada, the Salt Flats of Utah, and particularly the Coachella Valley between Palm Springs and Indio and northward to Las Vegas have all served well, as has semi-arid Los Angeles itself. That locale just east of the San Bernadino Pass which contains all the windmills has proven almost irresistible. When the desert isn’t appropriate, the tropics will do, the humid, sweat-soaked, stultifying tropics of the bayous and South Florida. Fargo (1995) introduced the frozen north, which continues in such recent films as Transsiberian (2008). But the main difference between the classic and neo versions lies in the depths of evil they portray. In retrospect, film noir, which seemed somewhat shocking at the time, seems relatively tame today or even camp. Then sex could lead to murder. But now it takes the form of rape, abuse of women, and incest. Greed has become drug trafficking and maniacal sadism, which flourishes in a totally corrupt, racist, non-system of criminal justice. Whereas classic film noir always provided a saving framework of law (crime did not pay, and if the mayor was corrupt, the governor was not), neo-noir presents a paranoid, nightmare world where everyone is victimized and no one can leave Las Vegas. So the genre persists, but the style and some of its conventions have changed as a new period has emerged. Whether the genre will survive the twenty-first century, no one can tell. One wonders why a form so interesting lingered so long in the swamps of pulp fiction. But it took more than a depression; it took a World War to blast America out of its traditional optimism and imagined innocence. At the moment, the prospects for noir are bright. Noir thrives on pessimism, cynicism, and paranoia. It depends on ambiguous sexual identities, instabilities, and the crossing of traditional boundaries. It feeds on political corruption and moral decadence. Given these conditions, the twenty-first century seems well on the way to providing a suitable habitat.\n\nNOTES 1.

Bolstering this idea, critics cite numerous post noir interviews with directors and actors who, when asked if they knew they were making film noirs, answered No, though of course the question itself implies the existence of some sort of entity. My favorite response is that of femme-fatale stalwart Marie Windsor who, when asked by co-stalwart Audrey Totter what she called film noir, replied, “B movies.”1 Steve Neale even goes so far as to say film noir cannot be “verified by contemporary sources.”2 But the argument that film noir was an afterthought, that film noir as a category only came into existence ex post facto3 cannot be sustained. The evidence to the contrary is overwhelming, some of it supplied by Neale himself. To begin with, the fact that a genre does not acquire a name until later does not mean the genre did not exist prior to its naming. All genres are ex post facto, as a group of films must exist before anyone can see family resemblances. As Altman points out, even musicals and Westerns were not instantly recognized as such. Movies still do not have a commonly acknowledged name, and this after more than a century: photoplay, pictures, motion pictures, flicks, movies, film, cinema—take your choice. Nor is there any term in English, such as the Greek word poem, which designates what we clumsily refer to as “a work of literature,” and this after more than ten centuries. All the styles of art history: Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist, Baroque, Rococo, and Neo-Classic were named after the contemporary event, many of them originally having pejorative connotations. 31\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 31\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n32\n\nFigure 3.1. McGraw\n\nChapter Three\n\nMarie Windsor in The Narrow Margin, with Don Beddoe and Charles\n\nIn literature, the novel serves as a perfect example of a phenomenon named after the fact. Prose fiction existed from ancient times onward, but the novel, associated with the term realism, was a much later development. Many think that the modern genre first appeared in 1554 with the publication of the picaresque Lazarillo de Tormes or in 1605 when Cervantes published the first part of Don Quixote. The first French novel, The Princess of Cleves, appeared in 1678, and what are now considered the first English novels, Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders in 1719 and 1720. Yet none of these were considered novels or a type of fiction by their contemporaries. Rather they were seen as criminal biographies, historic romances, or in the case of Don Quixote, as a work in a category all its own. It was not till Marivaux published Marianne (1731) and Le Paysan Parvenu (1735), Richardson published Pamela (1740), and Fielding Joseph Andrews (1742), works that were rapidly imitated by other writers, that the public became conscious of another genre. Even at that time in English the word “novel” indicated a short story, as in Cervantes’ Exemplary Novels (1613). Longer works of prose fiction were called “romances” or “comic romances.” Dr. Johnson called the novels of his day “modern romances.” Fielding facetiously referred to his Joseph Andrews as a\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 32\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nObjections\n\n33\n\n“comic epic poem in prose,” and Richardson and his admirers thought that he had created “a New Species of Writing.” From the 1740s until the 1770s—a full generation after the novel had blossomed with its two masterpieces, Clarissa (1747) and Tom Jones (1749)—readers and critics were conscious of the genre but the word “novel” did not become attached to it, and then only in English. Because Don Quixote was not recognized as a novel until more than a century after it was written, does that mean it is not a novel? The naming of film noir came much earlier in its history. That happened not a generation later, not in the 1970s, but in 1946,4 only four and a half years from the outset of the phenomenon, and well before noir peaked in the early 1950s. Borde and Chaumenton’s Panorama du film noir americain appeared in 1955, three years before the “movement” had ended. That at least\n\nFigure 3.2. Robert Aldrich showing his awareness of noir.\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 33\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\n34\n\nChapter Three\n\nsomeone in Hollywood knew of this concept is shown in a photo of Robert Aldrich, director of Kiss Me Deadly (1955) on the set of Attack (1956) holding a copy of the book. There’s hardly an astute observer of the 1940s that did not notice the changes in Hollywood films of the time. Neale himself cites two superb examples, an article in Variety (March 3, 1947) that speaks of the “murderous ladies cycle,” and another in The Spectator (December 2, 1947) that notices the new Hollywood Freudianism. In 1945 Lloyd Shearer wrote an article for the New York Times Magazine that begins: Of late there has been a trend in Hollywood toward the wholesale production of a lusty, hardboiled, gut and gore crime stories, all fashioned on a theme with a combination of plausibly motivated murder and studded with high-powered Freudian implication. Of the quantity of such films now in vogue, “Double Indemnity,” “Murder My Sweet” [1944], “Conflict” [1945], and “Laura” are a quartet of the most popular which quickly come to mind. Shortly to be followed by Twentieth Century-Fox’s “The Dark Corner” [1946] and “The High Window,”5 MGM’s “the Postman Always Rings Twice’ and “The Lady in the Lake” [1946], Paramount’s “Blue Dahlia” and Warners’ “Serenade” [1956] and “The Big Sleep”[1946]. . . . [This] quartet constitutes a mere vanguard of the cinematic homicide to come. Every studio in town has at least two or three similar blood freezers before the camera right now, which means that within the next year or so movie murder particularly with a psychological twist will become almost as common as the weekly newsreel or musical.6\n\nD. Marshan wrote another like it for Life (August 25, 1947) noting the villains and heroines with “deeply rooted diseases of the mind” flashing across the screen in a “display of psychoneurosis, unsublimated sex, and murder most foul.”7 In an article written in 1946, no less a critic than Siegfried Kracauer noted the change and described the attributes of noir, especially its pessimism.8 Manny Farber praised noir in his early essay “Underground Film,”9 but the most acute observer of all was Barbara Deming, who, working for the Library of Congress in the late 1940s, perceived the shifts in conventions that constituted film noir, particularly the characterization of men and women, and by 1950 had written a book about them, some of its chapters being published in City Lights in the early 1950s, and the book as a whole appearing in 1969 as Running Away from Myself: a dream portrait of America drawn from the films of the forties.10 But the book that demolishes the afterthought and non-existent theories is Sheri Chinen Biesen’s Blackout: World War II and the Origins of Film Noir. Through her painstaking exploration of studio records, press books, publicity, contemporary reviews, and media gossip, she establishes without further discussion that by 1944, two years before Nino Frank in France dubbed the\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 34\n\n8/17/11 12:40 PM\n\nObjections\n\n35\n\nphenomenon “film noir,” Hollywood’s producers, directors, and reporters were fully conscious of a “new kind of Red-Blooded Mystery.”11 “Red meat crime” was an even more popular term, as we see in this 1944 article by Fred Stanley, the New York Times’ Hollywood reporter of the era. Last week’s high mark in the “red meat” trend was the disclosure that MetroGoldwyn-Mayer is to co-star John Garfield and Lana Turner in Mr. Cain’s “The Postman Always Rings Twice.” The property, bought several years ago, was kept in the studio’s archives until now because (to use a favored Hollywood expression) of Metro’s inability to clean it up. . . . Closer to the cameras is another of Mr. Cain’s novels, “Mildred Pierce” . . . scheduled to go into production this week at Warner Brothers . . . reported to be negotiating for the author’s “Serenade.” The screen version of Raymond Chandler’s “The Big Sleep,” in production at Warners, is said to be another example of ingenuity in treating of psychopathic and physiological matters.12\n\nWhile such comments come from critics and observers, the best evidence of noir consciousness comes from Hollywood’s own productions. What is imitation if not a form of consciousness? The creators of The Maltese Falcon and the even more influential Double Indemnity could not possibly have been aware that their efforts would result in a new type of crime film, but that cannot be said of the creators of the multitudes of films spawned in the 1940s and 1950s by these two originals. I am not speaking of noir elements in other genres but of crime films that belong to this genre. In his Film Noir Guide, Keaney discusses over 700 candidates.13 Were the sheer numbers of imitators not enough to convince us of an awareness that goes beyond the fuzzy notions of trend or zeitgeist, we can see such consciousness in contemporary parodies. As Borde and Chaumenton put it in 1955, “Film noir wouldn’t be a series worthy of the name if it hadn’t given rise, in Hollywood itself, to various parodies.”14 The 1953 film The Band Wagon, directed by Vincente Minnelli, who also directed the noirish Undercurrent (1946), includes a dance, “The Girl Hunt Ballet,” performed by Fred Astaire as a hard-boiled detective and Cyd Charisse as a femme fatale, which mimics the conventions of hard-boiled detective films. How could such a dance be created if Hollywood were not aware of the phenomenon? To anyone who might claim this dance has more to do with the novels of Mickey Spillane than film noir, there is an even better example. This is the Bob Hope film My Favorite Brunette (1947), which though mentioned by Borde and Chaumenton, has been ignored by those disclaiming the contemporary evidence for noir consciousness. The film opens with Hope in prison, on death row, but a flashback takes us to Hope as a children’s photographer whose seedy office is next door to that of a hard-boiled private eye, played in a cameo by Paramount’s number one noir hero, Alan Ladd. Ladd, who is\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 35\n\n8/17/11 12:41 PM\n\n36\n\nChapter Three\n\nFigure 3.3. Parody as awareness. Alan Ladd and Bob Hope in My Favorite Brunette\n\ntaking some time off, asks Hope, who is in awe of him, to take in the mail and watch his office. While Hope busies himself there, a beautiful seeming femme fatale (Dorothy Lamour) enters and asks him to help her. When Hope foolishly impersonates Ladd, he falls into all sorts of comic difficulties with a den of criminals that includes Peter Lorre. How could contemporary Hollywood make a parody of a genre if it were unaware of its existence? Lest there be any doubt about Hollywood’s consciousness of film noir, one need only look at its effect on the office of Joe Breen, head of the Production Code Administration. Thomas Doherty’s book, Hollywood’s Censor, documents numerous complaints about this “genre without a name,” as Doherty calls it.15 For instance, in December 1947, Abram F. Meyers, general counsel of the Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors wrote: Those of us who lived through the outburst against moral laxity on the screen in the early 1930s, and witnessed the skillful job done by Will Hayes in putting out that fire, cannot help wondering why the situation was again allowed to get out of hand.16\n\nThings got so out of hand that “On June 28, 1949, Breen called a full-dress meeting that brought together the PCA staff, representatives from all the\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 36\n\n8/17/11 12:41 PM\n\nObjections\n\n37\n\nmajor studios, and prominent independent producers” to discuss the problems caused by film noir and the changes it represented in Hollywood conventions.17 Unfortunately for Breen, the Production Code focused on moral details, not tragic and ironic plots. It could ban nudity, foul language, and getting away with murder, but it had no provisions for banning a fallen world characterized by crime, betrayals, and double crosses as long as justice prevailed in the end, even a justice wrought by Fate and an inescapable dark past. The Code had long winked at the violence in Westerns, particularly saloon brawls, but now it had to deal with savage individual violence. It could tone down the brutality, but it could not do away with film noir. As Doherty puts it, “No soothing Voice of Morality or lawful end reel wrap up could wash away the grime of a netherworld that from studio logo to final frame smeared the entire running time.”18 Like the menace in a horror film, it might not yet be named, but Hollywood knew it was there. Alain Silver sums up the argument against those who believe noir was invented by later observers by saying they “continue to confuse lack of term for lack of intent.” The proof of contemporary consciousness of film noir lies in the works themselves. Whether they had a name for it or not, whether they called their pictures thrillers or mysteries, actioners or mellers, the pictures themselves affirm that the filmmakers of the noir cycle were well aware of what type of movie they were making.19\n\nNO CANON Neale claims that “noir, in my view, never existed,”20 and that it has no fixed canon. Absolutely fixed, of course not, but as fixed as the readings in any course in the Victorian novel. Not even the books of the Bible are fixed. To this day Catholics and Protestants cannot agree on which are the Ten Commandments. Canons, like genres, are never fixed, but at the first critical mention of film noir, we see the formation of a canon of its works. Nino Frank cited The Maltese Falcon and Double Indemnity, and to these Borde and Chaumenton include and discuss the following: This Gun for Hire (1942), The Killers, The Lady in the Lake, Gilda, The Big Sleep, Shanghai Gesture (1941), The Set-Up (1949), Rope (1948), The Asphalt Jungle (1950), Fallen Angel, Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950), The File on Thelma Jordan (1950), Night and the City (1950), Gun Crazy, He Walked by Night (1948), White Heat (1949), The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Ride the Pink Horse (1947), The High Wall (1947), Red Light (1949), Kiss of Death (1947), T-Men (1947), Border Incident (1949), Chicago Deadline (1949), The Crooked Way, and Somewhere in the Night (1946).\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 37\n\n8/17/11 12:41 PM\n\n38\n\nChapter Three\n\nIf film noir had no canon, it would not lend itself to one semester courses in the history of film. Phillip Gaines published his own version of such a course where again we find agreement about the essentials. His basic list includes Double Indemnity, The Maltese Falcon, Nobody Lives Forever (1946), The Naked City (1948), as ‘Docu-noir, Gun Crazy, The Woman in the Window (1944), Detour, D.O.A., Kiss Me Deadly, The Killing (1956), and Touch of Evil. For further viewing he recommends The Postman Always Rings Twice, Laura, This Gun for Hire, Murder, My Sweet, Phantom Lady, The Blue Dahlia, The Dark Mirror (1946), The Dark Past (1948), Brute Force (1947), The Two Mrs. Carrolls (1947), The Killers, Border Incident, T-Men, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956), The Big Heat (1953), Fallen Angel, Angel Face (1952), and Scarlet Street.21 My own course on film noir usually included the following: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Double Indemnity, Scarlet Street, Detour, Mildred Pierce, The Killers, The Big Sleep, Out of the Past, In a Lonely Place, Sunset Boulevard, Strangers on a Train, The Killing, and Vertigo. As you can see, I placed Hitchcock in the genre, whereas most film courses treat him as a genre in himself. More about that later. Similarly, Alain Silver’s top ten are Kiss Me Deadly, Gun Crazy, Double Indemnity, Criss Cross, The Woman in the Window, Ride the Pink Horse, Out of the Past, Night and the City, Caught (1949), White Heat, and The Big Sleep.22 Silver and his coeditor James Ursini devote their Film Noir Reader 4 to what they call “The Crucial Films,” which consist of Double Indemnity, Detour, The Big Sleep, Out of the Past, The Unsuspected (1947), Gun Crazy, D.O.A., The Big Night (1951), Kiss Me Deadly, The Big Heat, The Big Combo (1955), and Touch of Evil. And in his newest anthology Nicolas Saada discusses five films he considers prototypes of variations on noir style: Murder My Sweet, Panic in the Streets (1950), The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, and Touch of Evil.23 And James Damico names nine essential films: Double Indemnity, The Woman in the Window, Scarlet Street, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Killers, The Lady from Shanghai, Out of the Past, Pitfall (1948), and Criss Cross.24 Again and again, critics and scholars, whether pro or con genre, choose to discuss the same films. I doubt that courses in Greek Drama or Shakespeare show as much consistency. No one will agree on the top ten or the ten most typical. Such a listing depends on personal tastes and favorites, but all involved will choose from the same group of films from the same time frame. A few of them belong more to the period than the genre, but whether they comprise a cycle, a movement, or a genre, unquestionably they make up a canon.\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 38\n\n8/17/11 12:41 PM\n\nObjections\n\n39\n\nTOO AMORPHOUS Genres and literary categories are not mathematical concepts. As Altman has demonstrated, all genres are amorphous, so why discredit film noir for its own fogginess? There’s hardly a film made that does not fit several genres. Is The Benny Goodman Story (1956) a musical or a biopic? Is Sweet Dreams (1985) a musical, a biopic, or a women’s film? Even Double Indemnity and Out of the Past can be classified as love stories. But I maintain that a crime story set in the contemporary world and featuring a fallible protagonist, especially if it also features an investigation, will aid one in discriminating noir from nonnoirs, such as Clash by Night which depicts a somber and complicated love triangle but lacks any crime. That Fritz Lang directed it and Clifford Odets wrote it does not make it a noir, nor does its gloomy philosophizing. All genres and styles have works that are central to them, perfect examples so to speak—in the case of film noir, Double Indemnity and Out of the Past. From these central works, others radiate outward toward a periphery where they can just as easily be construed as other genres. For instance, there are dozens of crime films with murders and the noir style that to me do not qualify as generic film noirs. Take for instance The Window (1949), based on a story by Cornell Woolrich. In this film a young boy, Bobby Driscoll, witnesses a murder. Because of his propensity to fantasize and tell stories, neither his parents nor the police believe his account of the crime. His mother even takes him upstairs to the killers’ apartment to make him apologize to them for his lie, of course tipping them off about the threat the kid poses. Then follows a cat and mouse suspense drama, filmed almost entirely at night on dark stairways and prison-bar-like fire escapes. It’s a wonderful and effective example of noir style. By a stretch, one could say that the boy’s making up stories, such as his father having a ranch in Texas, and telling it to the other kids as the truth marks him as a noir-like fallible protagonist. But to me, he is just too innocent. Silver and Ward, however, include The Window in their encyclopedia of noir, where Robert Porfiro describes the setting of the film as “an American urban landscape that seems almost infernal. . . . Such a world represents the inverse of the American dream of freedom.”25 Because of its depressed urban setting and its noir style, Porfiro can place The Window in the context of film noir, but surely he would not claim it as central to the idea of the genre as, let us say, some of the other films he describes, such as Decoy (1946), in which a crazed femme fatale kills no less than three men duped into carrying out her mad schemes.26 Likewise many critics for good reasons see White Heat as a film noir. It departs from classic gangster films such as Scarface and through its psychological themes moves\n\n9781611483635_EPUB.indb 39\n\n8/17/11 12:41 PM\n\n40\n\nChapter Three\n\naway from that center. To me, however, it remains a gangster film, influenced by film noir, belonging to the n"
