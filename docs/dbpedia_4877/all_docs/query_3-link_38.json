        "text": "By Wes Clark\n\nYes, yes, another set of Internet film reviews. But mine are short, snappy and to the point, like the brisk patter in the best noirs. These assume you know something about the film. If you don't and you want to learn more, why, simply click the title and links to everything you want to know will appear, thanks to the wonder of\n\nThe Internet Movie Database. (The best things in life are free!)\n\nA note about content\n\nWhat constitutes a film noir, exactly? It seems every film critic has his own opinion, but many seem to agree that the book Film Noir : An Encyclopedia Reference to the American Style by Silver and Ward has about as representative a listing as any book. But I don't accept it as canon. It does not include what to me are two obvious noirs, \"Hoodlum Empire\" or Bogie's \"The Two Mrs. Carrolls,\" or the boldly noirish nightmare \"Dementia,\" or the Ida Lupino-directed women's interest films which are mildly noir or newer foreign films such as \"Insomnia\" or \"Following.\" The Lucille Ball film \"Lured\" certainly seems to fit - and yet appears nowhere that I could find. I, personally, reject \"Notorious.\" Some films, like \"When Gangland Strikes,\" can be difficult calls. That title alone would seem to put in the canon, but it seems way too good-natured to be noir. Yet... it contains two murders, the first of which shows a lot of blood from a gunshot wound for a 1956 film, and a storyline that is commendably clever. So I include it, and will happily review and include the films I see without regard to anyone's accepted listing. Defining noir is half the fun. And maybe, in the end, defining noir is like that famous description of obscenity: \"I can't describe it fully, but I know it when I see it!\"\n\nAdditional note: I have read the Film Noir Reader, edited by Silver and Ursini - which complicates things. One critic wants to include \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"King Kong\" as being film noir! This being the case, I'll stick to my guns. If I think it's noir I'll review it. If you disagree, fine, you can join the limitless list of film critics who all seem to disagree on a comprehensive list.\n\nBy the way, Silver and Ursini's book is slow going. Reading it, I have primarily learned that watching film noir is much more fun than reading about it, especially having to slog through something like, \"Cinema spectatorship also becomes less of a predominantly masculine activity with its emphasis upon the sadistic male gaze. In Studlar's view, the spectator (mail or female) regressed to the infantile pre-Oedipal phase, submitting to (and identifying with) the overpowering presence of the screen and the woman on it.\" (Tony Williams, \"Phantom Lady, Cornell Woolrich, and the Masochistic Aesthetic.\") Whew. This stuff may get lauded in the Women's Studies programs of great universities, but it sure looks like academic flapdoodle to me.\n\nOne last comment: \"The Golden Age of Hollywood\" is normally considered to be around 1939, when Gone with the Wind and the Wizard of Oz were made, but to me the true Golden Age was about ten years later, in the postwar era. I have seen very few films from the period 1945-1950 that I haven't liked. The films of that era had, by then, lost the \"Gee, you're swell!\" artificiality of the previous decades, and a more mature narrative style had fully emerged. These films usually hold up well on viewings fifty years later.\n\nFAVORITES\n\nLucky Number Slevin: An entertaining neo-noir with a darkly comic first half and a grim and purposeful second half; as it turns out it's a revenge story, but you don't understand that right away. I liked it. One critical opinion holds that, \"...trying too hard to be clever in a Pulp Fiction kind of way, this film succumbs to a convoluted plot, overly-stylized characters and dizzying set design.\" Agreed - but I still liked it. Lucy Liu is quite good as the bubbly mortician.\n\nSnatch: A Guy Ritchie British crime-comedy; it was entertaining. Not film noir at all as it was too much of a black comedy. Also, the editing style was too breathless and fast-paced. But it was fun.\n\nDead Man's Shoes: A superior British revenge flick with a supernatural twist. Really intense, really good. Paddy Considine is wonderful in this. Maybe even better than Get Carter.\n\nThe Suspect: Stars the always interesting Charles Laughton, a favorite actor. He's like Edward G. Robinson: You can't take your eyes off him. Henry Daniell, a reliable heavy, really shines in this one as a dissolute rotter. The plot: \"An unhappily married man begins a flirtation with a younger woman. When his wife threatens to ruin her, he decides to take action.\" Unhappily married was right! Rosalind Ivan, playing the wife, was an absolute, world-class shrew. This was one of those productions set in England with English stars but shot at Universal City; when I was a kid I always assumed that these were British films, like the Sherlock Holmes series starring Basil Rathbone. But no, they were American, too.\n\nThe Kid Detective: What happens when Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys grow up? This film posits a humorous answer. While it's mostly a comedy and riffs off of classic detective storylines, the plot turns very dark indeed in the final act. An amusing, original and memorable take on film noir and sleuthing - most of the time I wasn't really sure what was happening or where the story was going, and the final part was a real surprise.\n\nDick Tracy Versus Cueball: An RKO short film noir from 1946... it was great fun! The bad guys are invariably grotesque, people scream loudly and theatrically at every violent provocation and the bit players are all wonderful (Skelton Knaggs - a man with a face very much in the style of his name - was in this.) Also, Cueball, Vitamin Flintheart and Filthy Flora of the Dripping Dagger Inn (which had a wonderful neon sign) - great stuff! Very watchable and entertaining and over in about an hour. I never cared much for the comic strip but they make great little movies.\n\nThe Nickel Ride: A generally unknown and unfairly disregarded noir starring Jason Miller, the actor who is known primarily for playing Father Karras in The Exorcist (1973). It's the story of a low-level crime boss whose influence is waning and who is on his way out. Somebody wrote that almost every scene has a sense of dread about it, and so it does. It's a low key production from the Seventies that somehow manages to be representative of the best Seventies films but could take place in any era. Quite good.\n\nAlias Nick Beal: An excellent horror-film noir hybrid starring Thomas Mitchell as a corrupted politician and Ray Milland as a satanic tempter. (Nick Beal = Nick = \"Old Nick\" = Satan. Beal = Bealzebub.) Film noir stalwart Audrey Totter provides interest as a tart used to lure Mitchell down. I normally don't care for Ray Milland, but he was absolutely wonderful in this - along with Walter Huston's \"Mister Scratch\" in the Devil and Daniel Webster (1941), he's one of the classic screen's great devils. I couldn't tell from the VHS copy I had, but it appeared there was something interesting going on with Milland's eyes - perhaps the lighting, perhaps make up. But they seemed to glow somewhat. Very effective. He was genuinely creepy. Subtle, but creepy. In one scene Totter gets the slap of all slaps from Milland. You see women getting slapped all the time in film noir (especially in any films starring Dan Duryea), but this one stood out in the genre. Geez, it sounded like a thunder clap! Good foley, I guess. One more thing: this well-crafted film maintained interest and told the story it needed to tell with no wasted scenes and no slow sections in 90 minutes. Why can't modern filmmakers do that anymore? I agree with Aki Kaurismaki, the Finnish filmmaker, who believes that when it comes to running time, less is more.\n\nThe Pretender: We noirheads love our John Alton mystery lighting - and this tight little noir is a fine example of it. It also features a solo oboe and a Theramin in the score to provide a nightmarish, repressive atmosphere. Alan Carney portrays a film noir grotesque. Lots of fun!\n\nThe Silent Partner: Who knew the Canadians could make a gripping noir thiller? Set in 1978, this may be Elliott Gould's best role - a clever bank teller who plays cat and mouse with a murderous bank robber (Christopher Plummer). A clever script and an intricate plot.\n\nA Prophet: It's Corsicans vs. Muslims in this fascinating French prison epic about a young Arab who rises to become a crime kingpin.\n\nLadies in Retirement: Simply put, one of the best gothic murder mysteries I have ever seen and one of Ida Lupino's best roles. Starts out slow, but really grows with a very strong cast, including the ever unpredictable Elsa Lanchester and Louis Hayward.\n\nRuthless: Detour is Edgar Ulmer's most celebrated film noir, but this - with an a-list cast - is his best. A little bit Citizen Kane, a little bit The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, this is one of those movies that follow the protagonists from childhood up to their demise. An excellent production with Sydney Greenstreet in a great role. Loved it.\n\nQuai des Orfevres: An absolutely wonderful 1947 French film noir by director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who, in 1955, directed the magnificent Diabolique. The title refers to the Parisian version of Scotland Yard, and tips us off that, yes, this is a police procedural. The story of French filmmakers and film noir - the American genre they gave name to - is mixed. To me, their productions often seem too heavily derivative of the Yank originals. I can almost imagine the crew enthusiastically saying things like, \"Ah, oui! Le Bogie avec le trenchcoat et fedora! C'est magnifique!\" But when the French make a good film noir, it is very, very good - this is one of these. It's eye candy... post-war Paris is shown in evocative black and white: the wet side alleys, the crowded, smoky bars and theatres, depressing police stations, the interesting cars, the crowded apartments. The look of this film is so strong, in fact, it almost overwhelms the plot and action. One doesn't care what's happening - one just likes looking at it. But, fortunately, the plot is also strong, with the characteristic Clouzot twist ending. (Long before M. Night Shyamalan, there was Henri-George Clouzot.) A curiosity: a lesbian, who oddly wears her name \"DORA\" stitched to her blouse, is a feature of this plot. In 1947! The amusing and sympathetic police inspector - who bears an uncanny resemblance to Russian composer Igor Stravinsky - has a wry line at the end: \"You and I are two of a kindwe'll never get lucky with women.\"\n\nBlack Tuesday: A 1954 Edward G. Robinson prison break film... it's as good as Robinson gets and as good as film noir gets. Unrelenting and hardcore - really, really excellent.\n\nFor Men Only: This one was a total surprise as it was quite good, despite the somewhat homoerotic title and hazing opening sequence. It's Paul Henreid's indictment of fraternity hazing among college \"boys\" (meaning twentysomethings). The chief baddie in this was a very young Russell Johnson, the Professor in Gilligan's Island! The femme fatale was a young Kathleen Hughes, one of those forgotten 1950's actresses whom the camera absolutely loved. She looked sensational in this. It was also the film debut of Vera Miles. A unique movie. Wait - was this film noir? Not really. It also wasn't a juvenile delinquency film. I guess I'd call it a social issue film. Note: A puppy gets shot and killed in this as an initiation task. Whew. You don't see that very often in movies.\n\nRuthless: Director Edgar G. Ulmer is primarily known for Detour, a quick, dirty and cheap 1945 noir starring harridan Ann Savage in the part of her life, but Ruthless is, I think, his better film. It's one part Citizen Kane and one part The Strange Love of Martha Ivers. I was hooked from the moment it started until the rather surprising conclusion. An indictment of greed, Zachary Scott stars as a selfish, obsessed tycoon who runs through many business associates, friends and women by the film's end. Wonderful.\n\nThe Midnight Story: A superior Tony Curtis movie with an honest-to-goodness plot twist at the end that I didn't see coming. (That doesn't happen very often.) In this one, Curtis is a cop who quits the force to investigate the murder of a priest and becomes emotionally close to the family of the suspect. One of Tony Curtis' better early efforts.\n\nThe Blue Lamp: A truly wonderful Brit Noir; a great British cast, a compelling story and utterly gorgeous black and white cinematography. The plot is sort of a British version of the American A Detective Story which came out the following year; in a nutshell, a day in the life of a Bobby. My favorite line: \"We're going after the bastard who killed P.C. Dixon.\" This is the earliest British film, I think, to use the word \"bastard\"; when that line is uttered it has real impact - a real lesson to modern day filmmakers who feel compelled to scatter blood, explosions and swearing about. Less is more. This flick has appeal for Londoners and those who love the city (I'm numbered in that group): the darkest, key-lit London streets at night, and great old 1940's cars careening around corners showing the city as it was in 1949... excellent. It took real guts to be a Bobby back then. Apparently, the tactic to take in an armed baddie was not to pull a gun on him, but to stare him in the eyes, walk at him and say, \"Put the gun down.\" (This happens twice in the film.) Wow.\n\nLe Trou: The best prison film I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot because the prison flick is a sub-genre of film noir, and so I've seen a bunch of them. This film is a lot like The Asphalt Jungle (1950) in that you become emotionally attached with the prisoners staging the jailbreak - the protagonists are not just criminals, they are human beings who have done criminal things (exactly what criminal things isn't described). So you're pulling for them: in Asphalt Jungle it's a heist, here, it's a prison break. It runs over two hours... normally, I prefer shorter films, but there was a method to the director's madness. At one point you see the prisoners bang and chip away on the concrete floor of their prison with a steel bar for what seems like an extended length of time, the message being, of course, that this is hard, hard work.\n\nNo Orchids for Miss Blandish: An unusual and oddly named film noir. Why unusual? It created a scandal when it was released in the U.K. For one thing, it is set in New York City with a British cast, which means that everyone save the American lead actor affects rather bizarre dialects. (One psychopathic tough sounds like Spit in the Bowery Boys.) A reviewer noted that an unusually high number of statements in the film end with the word, \"See?\" It's also notable for being unusually violent for a British film; lots of gun deaths. And it's also sexually suggestive - not in any way that would cause surprise nowadays, but definitely over the top in 1948. A British reviewer once said the film had the morals of an alley cat and the sweetness of a sewer. I loved it! I always look for the DAME-HUNGRY KILLER COP RUNS BERSERK element in an old noir, and this film had it in spades - which is unusual because Britnoirs tends to be mannered and rather mild. This was most bizarre and thoroughly over the top Brit noir, ever. Lots of fun.\n\nThe Lineup: A top notch late period film noir. A Don Siegel directed film, this one moves right along, always sustaining interest. It has great San Francisco locations, including the police building that television's Chief Ironside worked out of (those large semi-circular windows upper story are instantly recognizable). Eli Wallach plays a psychopathic hit man assisted by his coach, played by character actor Robert Keith, a middle aged man who looks like a grinning skull with a pencil thin mustache and a dry demeanor. His funny little habit is to collect the final words of the people Wallach kills in a little notebook! Isn't noir great? The best ones have those little freaky details.\n\nThe Last Lullaby: Lean and economical, there are no distractions in this film. It's just the plot and characters, sparingly told. It reminded me a lot of cult favorite Blast of Silence (1961). The title makes no real sense with the story, by the way. I imagine it was selected because it sounds noirish. Well done; a good, viable neo-noir.\n\nRed Light: I normally don't care for George Raft films because I think the man can't act, but this one was intriguing and he was well cast in it. It was perhaps his best performance ever. It was an oddball film in that it mixed a film noir plot and style (revenge for the murder of a beloved brother) with a strong religious message - I've never seen that before! Also, Raymond Burr (shown above) was the baddie, and this may have been one of his best films as well. A real surprise which I quite enjoyed.\n\nNobody Lives Forever: A great film featuring noir street guy John Garfield in full John Garfield style, which is to say that he's brash, energetic, street wise, tough and charming. Like Bogie, but younger and somewhat more vulnerable. During World War II my father reported that he could usually get somebody to buy him a drink simply by stating that he was from Brooklyn (as he actually was). New Yorkers and Brooklyners back then were considered all-American types, and Garfield made a film career out of this kind of presence. As if Garfield wasn't enough, this film also featured the beloved and ever cool Walter Brennan, who even in 1946 looked old enough to be called \"Pops.\" (His wikipedia article makes note of the fact that he could often play parts for men older than he was with great success.) He has a great street scam in this film: a hustler, like Garfield, he invites people to look through his telescope for a dime. He then relieves them of their wallets while they're doing so!\n\nThe 7th Commandment: The neat thing about having a taste for old black and white crime films is that sometimes you're very agreeably surprised. For instance, the other night I put in this DVD a noirhead friend Mike Keaney gave me. I'll save you from having to look it up... the seventh commandment is the one about adultery. It was a cheapie production from a studio I never heard of, which starred nobody I knew, written and directed by a name totally unfamiliar to me. It had a rather clunky start but featured a blond femme fatale who was... interesting. As the film progressed I noticed that while it was obviously made on the cheap, it had a quality. By the time I got to the end of the film I was a bit astonished - this film had transcended its low budget. In fact, the low budget qualities enhanced the film! The actress (Lyn Statten) played her part well - in fact, she was really something to behold. A tough cookie in thrall to her sometimes vicious boyfriend, by the end of the production I was convinced that I had just seen one of the really notable femme fatale performances in film noir.\n\nOne of the unique things about the 7th Commandment, however, was the religious element. Without describing the plot too much, it's about a man who get amnesia, becomes an honest-to-goodness faith healing evangelical minister who is blackmailed and then tempted by his former girlfriend. He falls to her wiles and multiple murders ensue. What was striking is that the religious element was handled with respect; it was clear that the director intended that it was the important theme in the production. One reviewer wrote, \"I don't want to give away much of the plot, as the element of surprise is important. However, if the combination of a gritty b&w low-budget blackmail melodrama mixed with serious religious issues of faith and salvation sounds intriguing, track this film down. I've never really seen anything like it!\" Actually, neither have I.\n\nAfterwards I wondered, did I just see a cult film? After some Internet research I realized I had. From the IMDB bio for Lyn Statten: \"...her only noteworthy film to date was Crown International's \"The 7th Commandment\" released in December, 1961; a feature only distributed to drive-in vendors. Statten's portrayal of the femme-fatal Terry James, who takes the fall for an auto accident when her boyfriend, suffering amnesia, deserts the scene, is one of the most lost pieces of cinematic history ever to grace the screen.Statten proved only to be a one-hit-wonder, but her icy and bad-girl image continues to live on in the palms of avid cult film devotees.\"\n\nRemember, only an audience can make a cult film.\n\nCrime Wave: This one stars noir stalwarts Sterling Hayden (a snarling, jaded detective), Ted de Corsia (always the heavy), Gene Nelson (All-American type who had a past run-in with the law that haunts him despite his efforts to go straight) and last but certainly not least, the ever lovable Timothy Carey, Hollywood's creepiest creep. In one scene Carey is assigned the duty of guarding Nelson's wife, a job he eagerly accepts with a leering smile and garbled dialogue. One feels her husband's pain at this. It was also filmed in Los Angeles and Glendale - the community next to hometown of Burbank - and I recognized many of the scenes. That's always fun.\n\nElevator to the Gallows: An early Louis Malle work and the absolute coolest film noir I have ever seen. Given that I've seen 400+ of these, that's saying something. It features elegant black and white cinematography, lingering shots of Paris streets in the late Fifties, a Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing, a young Jeanne Moreau and an improvised score by Miles Davis. You just don't get more chic than that. But wait! There's more! One of the characters has an Ever Ready Plato clock on his desk. I want one. The twisty, turny plot and the conclusion are also very satisfying.\n\nDecoy: A very characteristic film noir - all fedoras, attitudes, cigarettes, betrayals and the meanest femme fatale (Jean Gillie) ever. It's now available on a DVD, but for years this film wasn't distributed in any other form than a videotape dub from Croatian television - this is the version I saw. (By the way, \"doctor\" in Croatian is \"doktore.\") It was excellent. Jean Gillie would have had a more notable career except that she died just three years after Decoy was released, at age 33. But she certainly earned her place amongst the Dark City Divas with her portrayal in Decoy, her last lines a scornful laugh. Noirheads love this film...\n\nTwo Dollar Bettor: A cool little film. It's not a major film by any means, and people think it's camp. What I liked about it was the horse race betting angle. My father was a handicapper and enjoyed driving to Del Mar racetrack to play the horses. Given that I haven't ever seen a noir with a horse racing plot, I liked this one. Do I sound defensive? Well, yes, I am - it wasn't an especially good film, truth to tell. But I liked it and it's a guilty pleasure. Carl \"Alfalfa\" Switzer of the Little Rascals comedy series was in it. He played a teenage football star (!). Thank goodness he didn't croon.\n\nNew York Confidential: An absolute first rate film noir starring some of my favorite noir stalwarts: Richard Conte, Broderick Crawford and Mike Mazurki. I suppose there was probably a prototypical syndicate film before this one, but this is an early one where all of the formulas and elements used in later and more celebrated works like Goodfellas, The Godfather and the Sopranos are present. If you like Mafia films this is an early one you'd need to see. You know the brief scene in the first Godfather film, where somebody snaps a photo of Don Barzini (Richard Conte) attending the Corleone wedding - where he makes a displeased face and has a henchman destroy the roll of film? To fully appreciate that little bit of business you had to have seen the 1950's Conte films like this one. Richard Conte was the smoothest of the film noir gangsters, always elegant, always poised, always fun to watch. And there is simply nobody in Hollywood today who is anything like Broderick Crawford; I wonder if his type - hulking, determined, loud, solid and old school - is even to be found in society anymore. In the Godfather films Talia Shire plays the gangster's daughter; that's a character present in New York Confidential as well, here played by Anne Bancroft in high style: her Daddy can get her anything, except respectability, and she resents it. All that, plus... Celia Lovsky (Star Trek's T'Pau) as the Cappo's mother. Great film...\n\nThe Night Has a Thousand Eyes: I've been looking for it for more than a decade; it's rarely shown and isn't on DVD. Stars Edward G. Robinson. It's based on a story by the always interesting pulp writer Cornell Woolrich. This one is perhaps his most fatalistic tale, and involves Robinson as a psychic who sees an odd series of life-threatening occurrences for a young woman. I quite enjoyed it - an entertaining film.\n\nThe Friends of Eddie Coyle: The plot was unsophisticated, nothing new there. The cast supporting Robert Mitchum as the title character was okay, too - but there was nothing special there, either. And the music was vintage Dave Grusin 1973 jazz funk. What elevated it was Mitchum's notable performance as the put upon, cornered loser. During one important scene he invites a fellow gunrunner to count the number of knuckles on his hand - he has twice as many as he should. Why? Because he was once punished by the mob by having his fingers slammed into a drawer, all of them broken. It hurt, it hurt bad. Nothing personal, you understand, they had to do it. And the remembrance of that pain - he rubs his hands - is evident in every scene where he considers selling out the mob to keep himself out of prison. You really feel for the guy. In the pantheon of film noir losers, Eddie Coyle is right up there with Richard Widmark's more youthful and flamboyant Harry Fabian in Night and the City. Unforgettable.\n\nFramed: A crackerjack film noir starring Glenn Ford and the luminous Janis Carter. Film noir guru Eddie Mueller says it's \"...the kind of film that we talk about when we try to describe what film noir is all about.\" Indeed - all the elements are there and well-played. A great little film. I quite enjoyed it.\n\nWoman on the Run: A terrific film noir starring a wise-cracking Ann Sheridan. It's one of those location noirs, where a city - in this case, San Francisco - is used prominently enough to almost become one of the characters in the film. This one had a great plot (a man who witnessed a murder flees the cops who want him as a witness - in the process of looking for him his estranged wife discovered that he really loves her after all), neat actors (Robert Keith is wonderful in this, as is Sheridan and stalwart noir leading man Dennis O'Keefe), a great location (mid century San Francisco) and a novel plot twist. The conclusion, which takes place at a boardwalk amusement area, is bizarre and nightmarish. Films like this remind me of what attracted me to film noir in the first place! I mention Robert Keith... his is a name that is really only known to old film buffs nowadays, but he's in a group of favorite film noir character actors. Whenever I see his name or that of Timothy Carey, Percy Helton, Emile Meyer, Paul Stewart, Jack Lambert, Barry Kelley, Jack Elam or Frank Cady appearing in the credits I have to smile. They're almost like old friends. 1950 was a great year for films noir... in addition to the one I cite above, it also marks the release of The Asphalt Jungle, Sunset Blvd., Where the Sidewalk Ends, In a Lonely Place, Gun Crazy, Night and the City, D.O.A., Panic in the Street, No Way Out, Caged, Dark City... so many top quality productions... Film historians usually cite 1939 as being a high water mark for quality output from Hollywood. I think it's more like 1947-1951. And 1950 was, arguably, the high water mark year for film noir.\n\n99 River St.: A noir that should be much better known than it is. The casting is perfect and the direction is spot on. It was so good I didn't even mind the happy ending so much.\n\nThe Breaking Point: A top notch noir with John Garfield. Garfield made a number of excellent noirs, but I think this one was his best. As usual, he plays a headstrong and acerbic but basically likable guy. He plays a fishing boat captain who seems to continually run afoul of bad luck and bad contacts. What struck me about this film was the refreshingly non-stereotypical treatment of a black man; the final scene of the man's son awaiting his return from a dodgy boat cruise was poignant. The noir protagonist may have escaped death, but it's clear the story is still tragic.\n\nConvicted: Did Broderick Crawford ever make any bad films? I don't think so. He and Glenn Ford really shine in this great old prison film. I liked the scenes of the convicts gathering to shout (\"yammer\") at the warden's office. Lots of tough looking old dudes in this one.\n\nBlast of Silence: Spare and elegant, it describes a hit man's contracted job, the murder of a gangster. Naturally, that's not all there is to it. Most of the action is told in narrative and it has many wonderful shots of New York City in evocative black and white. This is considered a rediscovered classic; I think people viewing it in 1961 probably figured, \"good little film\" and that's it. Nowadays we see it as it fits in the tail end of a long film noir cycle (1940-1961). In fact, this may just be the very last true noir of the classic period. The Criterion DVD has a neat little features section showing the locations as they looked in 1961 and now; it's surprising just how much the look of the places has changed. NYC in the 1950's and 1960's has a very different look than the city of today...\n\nNight and the City: I didn't think I would like this one at first. I mean, London is the city referred to, here. Isn't noir an American product? Nevertheless, Richard Widmark pulls off the loser character of Harry Fabian so convincingly that the way the film ends is never in question, and I watch just to see a sort of cosmic justice be done. Mike Mazurki, an early pro wrestler, is in this, and one wouldn't think he would be a convincing ingredient of a tough, gritty film - but he is. Googie Withers is in it, too! I have only seen four films with this oddly-named British actress, but they are favorites: this one, Dead of Night, Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes and the Powell and Pressburger film One of Our Aircraft is Missing..\n\nPickup on South Street: Wonderful cast and great noir ambiance. I especially like Richard Widmark's home: a shack over the water, approached by walking along a (metaphorical) narrow plank. It's hard to believe he was 39 when he did this one, he seems like such a youthful wiseguy. Jean Peters is an engaging \"b-girl\" (these days we call them \"ho's\"). Thelma Ritter is great in this, too, and has a especially memorable line in keeping with noir fatalism: \"Go ahead and blow my head off, mister. You'd be doing me a favor.\" (He - Richard Kiley - does.)\n\nKiss Me, Deadly: In many ways the film noir. I didn't care much for it when I first viewed it, but upon subsequent viewings its quirky characters (the guy at the morgue is especially freakish), nihilism and freak-out ending worked its magic on me. It is now a favorite. The great Nat King Cole song \"I'd Rather Have the Blues (Than What I Got)\" woven throughout helps, too, as do the classical allusions. The only problem I have with this is that Velda looks like a grown-up female Jerry Mathers (\"Leave it to Beaver\").\n\nThe Asphalt Jungle: One of those films where you root for the criminals because, as is explained by one of the characters in this film, \"crime is merely a left-handed form of human endeavor.\" Unexpectedly gripping and tense., and a great collection of types. Throw Marilyn Monroe into the mix and you've got one terrific film - possibly the best crime film, ever. I like the smoky heist planning scenes set in harsh light and velvet shadows.\n\nDetective Story: A day in the life of a cop, presented by William Wyler. The majority of this film is (claustrophobically) confined to a precinct headquarters. It's entertaining in that four or five storylines are going on at once, with much visual interest. Also, it has an excellent cast of character actors - there are no weak roles in this. It must have been considered ahead of its time in subject matter as well, as it deals - in fairly frank terms - with an abortionist. Horace McMahon, a favorite of mine who also played a gruff New York police lieutenant on the TV series The Naked City, is in this and adds credibility to the production. The last scene is a bit over-the-top, but nevertheless adds the necessary noirish kick. Up to that point this film is too frequently cheery and comical to really be a noir, but the tragic last part puts it into noir territory. An excellent film.\n\nThe Killing: A heist film similar to Asphalt Jungle, in that you get wrapped up with the details of the crime and begin to consider the criminals as mere working stiffs. What puts this one over the top for me is the unlikely pairing of nebbish little guy Elisha Cook, Jr. and the so-very-female Marie Windsor as an (unhappily) married couple - they have some incredible dialog. The narrative style is unique, too, and copied (with no requirement to do so) in Pulp Fiction.\n\nRiot in Cell Block 11: One of the better prison films, but then, director Don Siegel knows what he's doing. This one has a favorite character actor and noir stalwart, Emile Meyer, as a compassionate prison guard. He's much more interesting as a menacing slob, frankly. This film also stars one of Hollywood's scariest heavies, Leo Gordon - but young, buff (wearing wife-beaters) and psychotic. A fine film! By the way... it co-stars a young Alvy Moore, aka Hank the County Agent from Green Acres, which jeopardizes this film's noir status. That's my rule. Any film he's in can't be taken seriously. (See \"5 Against the House.\") Fortunately, however, he has only a bit role with infrequent speaking parts, so I'll waive my rule.\n\n(NOTE: In real life, Alvy was a Marine who fought at Iwo Jima. So he gets major respect from me for that!)\n\nKiller's Kiss: Another early Stanley Kubrick effort. New York looks bleaker here than in any other film, and the laconic, emotionless blonde male and female leads seem washed of life or vitality. Sort of like Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake but with no sense of personal style - reduced to that because of their surroundings. It has an upbeat ending, but you sense that life together will suck for them nevertheless. In my opinion this film should be better received critically than it is.\n\nThe Driver: Ryan O'Neal plays against type in this great neo-noir; a man of few words who does some fancy driving (which is a lot more interesting to watch the chase sequences in the far better-known Bullitt). Bruce Dern plays a semi-psychotic detective and Isabelle Adjani is, well, just great to look at!\n\nScarlet Street: Starring my favorite thinking man's actor, Edward G. Robinson. I love the fact that his crime is shown as unpunished by the law. See? You can still shock well within the bounds of 1940's filmmaking conventions. Made by one of my favorite directors, Fritz Lang, and starring a notably young Joan Bennett - whom I got to know as a kid watching Dark Shadows. She was a matriarch, by then, but this film shows she could portray a convincing prostitute! Those paintings Robinson's character does are great - I especially like the Grandma Moses-style portrait of Bennett at the end.\n\nThe Sweet Smell of Success: The most thoroughly bitter film I have ever seen - you almost want to take a shower after seeing it. Tony Curtis has his best role in this one as the pathetic, desperate publicity agent Sidney Falco. At one point in the film somebody makes a cutting comment to Tony Curtis, and he uses this a few moments later to his advantage - as he uses everything he can lay his hands on: cash, relationships, information. Noir, above all, is an exposition device for human desperation, and this film depicts that better than anything else.\n\nMildred Pierce: I'm no Joan Crawford fan - she's a screen Medusa as well as an offscreen one - but I certainly liked this film. All about a mother's poisonous love. She has a sympathetic role in it, perhaps that's why I like it. Eve Arden, as a wise-cracking waitress, has all the best lines and steals every scene she's in.\n\nSide Street: A favorite just for the great evocative shots of mid-century Manhattan, but Anthony Mann adds all sorts of interesting little features to this one as well. For instance, at one point a bad guy chokes the life out of poor Jean Hagan - who is especially convincing as a b-girl - while kissing her! Whew... never saw that before. I also liked the duality of the bad guy taxi cab driver being a family man like Farley Granger, the protagonist. And the automobile chase scene at the end was great, too (those bulbous old sedans didn't corner well). The only thing I didn't care for about this film was Cathy O'Donnell, who, when paired with Farley Granger, acts somewhat retarded to me. She was lacklustre in They Only Live at Night, too. The scene when Granger calls her and she shouts \"Run! Get away!\" was especially annoying. But it doesn't take much away from a film that grabs you at the beginning (with great overhead shots of Manhattan) and never lets go.\n\nTry and Get Me!: One of the bleakest films noir I have ever seen (which is really saying something). You might think it's about a cornered hoodlum, gun in hand, screeching the movie title at the police, but it's not. It's actually a left-wing denunciation of mob violence. The scene where the mob grabs the men has real impact. What surprised me was when the film changed direction from the crime to the mob's reaction to it, which was intended to be the focus all along. An excellent b-film.\n\nThe Big Combo: No doubt about it, Richard Conte was smmooooth, an ideal noir gangster. And the opening scenes grabbed me, too: a blonde in a white dress running in and out of light in a darkened alleyway, two (homosexual) goons in chase. The torture scene was especially memorable, Earl Holliman grinning sadistically, face half in and half out of the light. It's not often that so much is done with so little budget. Finally, this movie has my all-time favorite film noir opening title sequence: big white block letters superimposed over an moving aerial shot of New York City at night, accompanied by David Raksin's perfect jazzy score, the saxophone suggesting gangsters, strippers or both. The whole attitude of the movie and the hard-boiled urban 50's is summed up in a perfect minute and a half.\n\nDetour: The case study of doing so much with so little budget. As Roger Ebert points out, the flaws and evident budgetary shortcuts don't detract from the film, they are the film. This one plays like a noir nightmare, having a logical sense all its own. When viewing it, my wife pointed out how improbable it was, based on mistaken and foolish decisions - but she admitted that the following day she was thinking about the film nonetheless. It is a cheapie that is not easily cast away mentally or forgotten. The appropriately-named Anne Savage is remarkable, the hands-down meanest shrew in all of noir.\n\nKiss of Death: Include me in with the Tommy Udo fans from the late forties. Richard Widmark gives an unforgettable performance in this, his first film. I read somewhere that Victor Mature - an actor I don't care for at all - gave his best performance in this film, but it was unfortunate since he was so thoroughly out-classed by Widmark. My favorite scene is at the end, when Mature confronts Widmark, and we see Udo's eyes peering at him from behind a door. Very suspenseful.\n\nSudden Fear: From all accounts Joan Crawford was a pretty horrible woman, but she's ideal for this part, a woman-in-distress noir. Nobody in Hollywood had eyes that could stare out in this fashion, and Jack Palance is suitably creepy. There is one part in this film, just after Crawford's character learns of the plot against her life, that has some terrific facial expressions on Crawford and Palance suggesting that the balance of power has shifted, thanks to hidden knowledge.\n\nThe Strange Love of Martha Ivers: Strong performances from all concerned, and Liz Scott never looked or sounded better. My favorite aspect of this one is that it starts with the characters' childhoods - indicating that the rot set in at a very early age. (And the pre-story is interesting in itself, such are the strong performances from the young cast.) However, I've never found Barbara Stanwyck especially attractive. This is probably because I first became familiar with her as an older woman in the 1960's TV series The Big Valley, where she was anything but a femme fatale.\n\nChinatown: Yes, in color, and yes, made in 1974. But Roger Ebert described this one best when he wrote that it isn't so much neo-noir, but, rather that this film takes its place alongside the best noirs. I love the downbeat ending: director Roman Polanski was right to insist upon it, writer Robert Towne, who wanted something more upbeat, was wrong. I'm no Jack Nicholson fan - I think he plays Jack Nicholson far too often and is irretrievably typecast - but I like his understated performance in this film. The music is great, the various characters are a delight to watch, and the evil John Huston portrays in this film is unforgettable. I still get chills at the end, when he escorts his granddaughter away. And the revelatory scene where Nicholson slaps Faye Dunaway into revealing the core secret of the film was shocking in a way I rarely see in films. Maybe, like a fine wine, noir was something that had to be bottled in the 40's and only fully matured in the 70's. One of my very favorite films in any genre.\n\nThe Two Jakes: I had to watch this one twice to fully appreciate it. On the second viewing, I rewound and fast-forwarded the tape around to make sure I caught the subtle stuff: 1.) \"Whipstocking\" as a sexual pursuit and oil drilling technique. 2.) Trembler/temblor (I made the same mistake when I was a kid). 3.) The clever and subtle metaphorical way Gittes finally recognizes Catherine Mulray based on a previous scene. 4.) Constant references to the previous film - Catherine Mulray: \"We haven't been introduced\" (true, but they have met). I also like the way this echoes the first time Gittes meets Evelyn Mulwray (\"Mr. Gittes, have we ever met?\"). 5.) The Richard Farnsworth character mispronounces Gittes' name the way Noah Cross did. 6.) Memorable supporting characters: That hilariously self-important Notary Public (who was a clerk in the prior film) and the scientist who tries to warn about the accumulating gas pressures. What's with the cop with the green parrot on his shoulder? 7.) According to a voiceover, Gittes got a medal in WWII, which, framed, hides his wall safe. Actually, I bet this film will bear an attentive third viewing. I'm sure there's stuff I missed. I now think that this film is far better than the critics apparently did when it was released. For instance, for me it does a better job of establishing that the past can't be avoided than the more celebrated \"Out of the Past.\" The last line in this film is great. Even Jack Nicholson, an actor I tire of because he always seems to play the same character (Jack Nicholson), gives a restrained and sympathetic performance. I strongly recommend this one.\n\nI understand Towne, Evans and Nicholson were going to do a trilogy about what made Southern California great (water in \"Chinatown,\" oil in this film and Hollywood in a third installment). Until the third film is actually made - if ever - I will mentally substitute \"Sunset Boulevard.\"\n\nBody Heat: An update of Double Indemnity, really, but a very good one. It's also a guilty pleasure of mine since I do not like explicit sex in films (and this one is pretty explicit). What puts this one over the top for me plotwise is how well the betrayal is revealed, bit by bit, and the identity switcheroo at the end. But what makes this film really special is the blusey/jazzy/depressive score by John Barry, which suckered me in immediately during the opening credits. I have purchased a CD of the music and have been driving my poor family crazy with it in the same way my mother did to me with the score to Gypsy, when I was a child. Barry wrote many a good piece of music for the Bond films, but he really outdoes himself in this one. My only complaint is that Kathleen Turner is not at all a woman I would kill for, so there's some willing suspension of disbelief required from me.\n\nThe Set-Up: Gripping; the best fight film I have ever seen. Interestingly, at only 72 minutes, filmed in real-time. (That is, a clock shown on a street at the end is advanced 72 minutes from the same clock shown at the beginning.) Being something of a senior athlete myself, I like that angle of this film.\n\nThe Red House: A largely unknown film, but when I first stumbled across it on TV I was hooked enough to stay up until 2 AM watching it. (And this was before I discovered film noir.) Not a film noir in the conventional, urban, sense, but more like a rural-noir. In fact, this film is just plain different, period. It has Julie London in it, which is recommendation enough for me. The climax is genuinely creepy and haunted.\n\nBrigham City: Mormon film noir! The tag line explains it as well as anything else: \"Nothing attracts a Serpent like a paradise.\" Other films have also had this idea as a subtext (\"The Red House,\" \"Blue Velvet\"); what I like about this one is that as I am a Mormon myself, the Utah culture depicted therein seems so recognizable.\n\nTension: One of the better police procedurals I have seen. It differs from the usual fare in that the lead cop (Barry Sullivan) seems to be sadistic and manipulative in his pursuit of the bad guy (who, in this case, is a gal). Audrey Totter is great in this, as the tough as nails femme fatale. Richard Basehart is excellent as well. I also liked the \"tension\" metaphor of the rubber band, used in crucial scenes. A great little noir!\n\nThe Big Heat: What noir is all about, and perhaps the best angry cop drama out there. Fritz Lang did some fine work; perhaps his very best. Gloria Grahame has the primo role in this one (\"We're both sisters under the mink\"), and Lee Marvin's flinging about of hot liquid is certainly memorable. The gunplay was effective: after I watched this one I was awakened from sleep by some kid's lit firecracker in front of our house, and, half-awake, briefly wondered if life was in the process of becoming art.\n\nPitfall: Perhaps because I am a sometimes bored but happily-married man this one really speaks to me. Dick Powell is great; I'm so glad he got out of light musicals to do noir, he's much better suited to it. And Liz Scott was never more appealing. I like the fact that at the end of this one he gets off, but not really scot-free. A satisfactory ending.\n\nMoonrise: Like the Red House, another rural-noir; this one seems to take place in Virginia. Dane Clark effectively conveys frustrations and emotions under the surface, and one sympathizes with his occasional rage, fear and desperation. A fatalistic, depressive ending seems more appropriate instead of the upbeat one it has, but on the whole this is a unique and engrossing film. It's a good example of how noir conventions and themes works well in genres outside of urban crime. It has been pointed out that noir is not so much a genre (night/city/streets/crime) so much as an artistic style, or a sensibility. My favorite aspect of this film is that the whole thing looks like the action - even a carnival! - takes place in the middle of thick (metaphorical) woods, crisscrossed with dark, brackish (metaphorical) creeks. At the end, hope is indicated by the surroundings and cinematography opening up.\n\nPursued: Another good example of off-genre noir - this one is a Western! I saw it as a kid late one night with my father, and was interested in the nightmarish flashbacks Bob Mitchum had as a kid, which are fully explained at the end of the film.\n\nBlade Runner: A celebrated science-fiction cult film with unexpected and interesting philosophical themes about life. It also happens to be yet another off-genre noir, and since it was made in 1982, a neo-noir at that. Ridley Scott's vision of the Los Angeles of tomorrow is so convincing, I have no problem believing that someday L.A. will really look like this. Perhaps my favorite aspect of this film is that it appeals to my son, and we have enjoyed viewing it together. Odd how the simple things in life are so fulfilling, isn't it?\n\nOdd Man Out: Directed by Carol Reed, who made the excellent \"The Third Man.\" Not known as a film noir because it's British, but it's pretty noirish nonetheless. This one takes place in the alleys and streets of Belfast; the photography is a stunning and expressionistic black and white. It has a doom-laden \"heist gone wrong\" storyline about a dying IRA gunman and the way people respond to him, and the inevitable (but nonetheless rather shocking) tragic ending in front of an iron fence that symbolizes jail cell bars. Add a femme fatale and that's as noir as a movie gets. Of all the films James Mason made, this is his favorite. He has good taste.\n\nThey Made Me a Fugitive: A Brit-noir; British films are always well-cast, and this one is certainly no exception. The interesting thing about watching a Brit-noir is seeing how the hard-boiled attitudes translate when spoken in a British dialect. There's a fight that takes place on a slippery slate tile roof of a funeral parlor (the letters \"R.I.P.\" are mounted on the top as a sign) that is especially well-shot and memorable - I also liked the ambiguous ending.\n\nBrute Force: A great prison breakout movie, and perhaps one of the most socially liberal of all the noirs, which gives the film an added political edge. (In order for this film to work, you have to agree that the inmates are more unfortunate than evil, and that the same thing could happen to any one of us at any time - which is a flawed bit of left-wing thinking.) Anyway, this film is described as being especially violent, which it is in some cases, but it's a far cry from what we see nowadays. (However, I wish someone would have popped the Calypso inmate - sort of a noir Jar-Jar Binks - who is given to singing annoyingly.) Still, this is a great film. Hume Cronyn is especially hateful as Captain Munsey, a sadistic little tyrant. The best line is given to the left-wing expositor, the drunken prison doctor: \"No one escapes. No one ever escapes.\"\n\nMulholland Drive: A David Lynch production, and an especially \"Lynchian\" one at that. Certainly not a conventional noir - this is more like a dream or nightmare. Has a difficult narrative flow that takes some thinking about to make sense of, but certainly gets the atmosphere right. At first, when I left the theater, I figured this one was just another exercise in Lynchian doppelgangers and didn't consider the film as anything special. Then, as I thought about it more, I realized how good the film really was. I am now convinced that it is the best example of film noir for the new millennium. Great incidental music by Angelo Badalamenti. (I wrote up a little article, \"Mulholland Drive Explained.\")\n\nRaw Deal: Great title, great film. Packs nearly every noir visual aspect and style into a taut 79 minutes. It's hard to imagine a film being emotionally tougher than this one. I especially like the overwrought poster text: \"Women! Bullets! Can't stop a man like this!\" The big, blocky letters in the title sequence convey a good idea of what's coming, too. They don't make 'em anymore like this because they can't.\n\nBlood Simple: About as good as modern-day noir gets. The themes are all there, the characters are updated with the more natural acting style that is common now, but with all of the interesting kinks and turns of a noir plot. Much less irony and black humor than Fargo, and therefore, in my opinion, a better film. The next time I view this one, I think I'm going to turn the color off to see it it works better in black and white...\n\nThe Window: You can introduce your kids to film noir with this one! An entertaining film; 12 year old Bobby Driscoll makes this film work and does a credible acting job. One of the themes of this work - the boy who cried wolf - is a little forced, but overall this film works quite well, makes sense, and sustains interest. The urban cinematography is quite good, too.\n\nThe House of Games: An interesting look at the world of people who choose to live by their wits and the con. Also, oddly enough, a film about a woman who comes to understand herself better. This one is made vibrant by David Mamet's quirky dialog (\"Oh, you're a bad pony. And I'm not gonna bet on you.\" \"You can't bluff someone who's not paying attention.\")\n\nThe Grifters: A successful neo-noir featuring John \"Noah Cross\" Huston's daughter Anjelica Huston. An interesting three-way look at who's better at the grift: Huston, her son (I think) John Cusack or Annette Bening. Who's conning whom? This film reminds me of \"The House of Games,\" another excellent neo-noir. My favorite image out of this movie is described in the review below.\n\nInsomnia: An interesting cinematic proposition: What does film noir look like north of the Artic circle, where there is no night? On assignment in northern Norway, a corrupt Swedish cop causes the accidental death of his partner while investigating a murder case, and attempts a cover up. But he can't sleep, and the daylight pours in on him like the Eye of God. This is a brilliant Norwegian neo-noir, and suggests that Nordic melancholy and Ingmar Bergmanesque ghostly visitations are well-suited to noir (even when, cinematically, there is no \"noir.\") The end of the film is especially interesting: the cop driving into a tunnel looks like a metaphor for a descent into hell. (In much the same way Anjelica Huston takes a dark elevator ride downwards after accidentally killing her son in \"the Grifters.\")\n\nFollowing: Brit neo-noir. A tightly scripted little production of only 69 minutes - in black and white, yet. If RKO was still making low budget noirs in the U.K., maybe they'd look like this! The only flaw it has is the same flaw that \"Pulp Fiction\" has - a time-jumbled, non linear narrative that seems to be that way simply to be different. I see nothing about the story to require it. (Kubrick's \"the Killing\" came by it naturally, as a result of telling different stories - set-up for a heist - that coincide at some point in time.)\n\nT-Men A procedural film (this time the Treasury Department and not some police force), it has all the noir goodies but with a rather heavy-handed narrative. Still, a great film. It's interesting to see how the two treasury agents only really become alive and interesting to us when they go undercover.\n\nBorder Incident: Sort of a South of the Border version of T-Men, really, but a great film in its own right. Anthony Mann really knew how to direct in this genre, and who can argue with John Alton lighting? Ricardo Montalban is excellent in this - makes me wonder why he became so hammy later on.\n\nMemento: One of those films with a non-linear narrative, but the reason for it in this one makes sense: since the main character can't create short-term memories, the flow of this story makes the viewer attempt to work out the puzzles within his own fractured and interrupted mind. I'm not entirely sure I've worked out all the relationships and betrayals in this one, but it's an interesting mental exercise. One scene is fascinating: a woman insults the main character and tells him she's going to betray him. She is slugged, and, bleeding from the nose and mouth, exits the room, knowing that he will forget the incident. She goes into her car to wait while he frantically tries to find a pen or pencil to write himself a reminder. He cannot. The camera shows her sitting in her car looking at the front door with a wicked, knowing look on her face - then she goes back into the house and lies to him. Since he forget the previous situation he believes her, and she manipulates him into a murder. If there is a scene that better visually describes the heart of the film noir femme fatale, I'm unaware of it. (A good analysis of this movie's complexities is here.)\n\nPoint Blank: When I started to watch this movie, I asked myself, \"How much of a film noir could this be, being that it was made in 1967?\" The answer is that it is a convincing update on the style while still being a obvious product of the mid-60's in look. (Lemon yellow seems to be a prominent color in this film's palette.) I'm pretty sure Point Blank belongs in a category I call, \"He's dead but he doesn't know it\"; there is convincing evidence that all of the action takes place in the mind of the protagonist, who is shown being shot in the very opening moments. Lee Marvin's character's name is simply \"Walker,\" which seems suggestive. There are comments like, \"You're alive?\" and \"You should have died at Alcatraz!\" etc. This film depicts an altered view of reality, as well. At times it's quite dreamlike - which is a feature of many noir films. (The professional critics have a name for it: \"oneric.\") Lee Marvin's final scene shows him receding into some dark shadows, which seems to suggest the finality of death. There is one very effective scene that features the sound of a vengeful Lee Marvin loudly walking down an airport corridor that is used as the audio track for a scene involving his wife, who betrayed him. This film has many such moments, and suggests that noir was, indeed, live and well in the psychedelic era. An excellent contribution to the style.\n\nMadigan: One year after Point Blank came another, but more conventional, Sixties film noir, \"Madigan,\" starring the eternally interesting and viable Richard Widmark. I think this one may have introduced the look, feel and colors of the Seventies television cop dramas - it looks like an especially good episode of \"Ironside\" or \"The Streets of San Francisco\" to me. (Or even an episode of \"Madigan\" - go figure.) Anyway, I like the fact that the lead character gets killed at the end - that, and the cynicism of the character, is where the noir edge comes in. I am now convinced that anything Widmark stars in is worth watching - but this film is better than that.\n\nKey Witness: It isn't very often that I come across a cute film noir, but this is one of them. An affable inventor is twice (yes, twice!) accused of murders he didn't commit. Why cute? He invents talking clocks (a door opens and a little figure pops out which says \"It's ten o'clock!/Time to turn in!/Mama and Papa shouldn't argue!/To fight is a sin!\") and kissing couple light switches (you move the boy into a position where he's kissing a girl to turn on the room lights). And, at the end, Smiley the Hobo, whom you finally discover is why the film is named as it is (SPOILER), thrusts his face through a paper clock face and recites a charming little poem to wrap things up. Wow. The noir pal from whom I got this rare gem thinks this film was a stinker and gives it only one star. I think it was brilliantly unique! Five stars!\n\nUnderworld U.S.A.: A fine example of noir filmmaking. It's hard not to like a film with: 1) A moll named \"Cuddles,\" 2) A gunman who ritualistically puts on dark glasses before executing his victims (one, shockingly, being a little girl on a bicycle), 3) A hard-boiled old mother figure who compensates for not being able to have kids by surrounding herself with baby pictures, 4) First rate noir cinematography, much of the action taking place in a dank alley, 5) A great revenge motif, 6) A downbeat fatalistic ending, and, last but certainly not least, 7) Cliff Robertson's puckish, expressive face, almost a cross between a sardonic Burgess Meredith and the Joker! It's hard to understand why critics cite \"Touch of Evil\" (1958) as being the last great noir. I would argue that this film, produced in 1961, merits that distinction.\n\nLe Samourai: The French named film noir - in this film, they prove they also love it. French minimalism works well with the style; there is very little dialog and a stark look. What struck me as being characteristically French about this film was Alain Delon's habit of smoothing the brim of his fedora before setting out (to kill someone).\n\nNight Moves: Released in 1975, and it really shows. However, at heart this is still a great noir. I have to admit, like most viewers my age I favor (or am used) to naturalistic acting styles that came into vogue after the classic years of film noir. (People don't run around saying things like, \"That's swell!\" anymore.) This film incorporates modern acting style with a script and plot that is directly related to the older films. So I was satisfied with it as a skillful blend of two filmmaking eras. Like the critics, I also enjoyed the final image: that of a boat turning metaphorical circles. On a personal level, I was pleased to notice that in this noir, Dark City is Burbank, California - my home town!\n\nThe Man I Love: This is Exhibit A in my case that Ida Lupino was a film noir goddess like no other. It's not really a film noir as it seems to be too light-hearted, but it's certainly noirish. First of all there's that sensational opening Gershwin song which Ida sings while conducting all sorts of business: lighting a cigarette, lighting someone else's, taking a drink... whew. What the woman lacked in tonal qualities she certainly made up for in noir allure. (I kept thinking that a mature Judy Garland would have knocked this song out of the ballpark, the way she did with \"The Man That Got Away.\") Her form-fitting dress - according to Eddie Muller it had to be cut off her when she suffered breathing problems - was sensational. Ida had what one would nowadays call merely a \"nice\" figure, but this dress makes the best out of every millimeter. And what a cast of characters! 1. The virtuous sister 2. Her crazy G.I. husband, in residence in the laughing house 3. Their battlin' boy 4. The debutante younger sister 5. The blonde floozie across the hall with the twins 6. Her indulgent, cuckolded husband 7. The twins 8. The brother who's a wanna-be gangster 9. The leering nightclub owner/thug 10. A brilliant but troubled jazz pianist 11. Until the advent of rock, the world's goofiest-looking guitarist 12. Alan Hale, Sr. (Haw! Guffaw! Hawhawhaw!) ...all strung together by a tough, wisecracking Ida Lupino, who models a series of stunning gowns. This is a wonderful film, not to be missed. Possibly Ida's best.\n\nAutumn Leaves: One of the occupations I find myself involved in after watching 1940's and 1950's films is mentally debating, \"Was it film noir?\" The IMDB shows this one merely as \"drama,\" but what do THEY know? And it doesn't appear in Silver's noir encyclopedia... but I think it's film noir. I won't strenuously argue the case, however. The usual gritty urban cinematography is missing, but frankly, I have only rarely seen such a thorough and convincing exploration of big city loneliness, desperation and madness as this. It's like \"In a Lonely Place\" in that way. What propels it into noir is what substitutes for the central film noir crime: the deeply psychological power of the father having sex with the son's wife. A moral crime, almost Oedipal. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. While I'm inclined to not like Joan Crawford because she was such a real-life beast, I have to admit that she always draws me into a movie. Maybe she simply benefited by being involved with good scripts and great directors, I don't know. And, I have to admit, she was a great actress. At one point in this film a whole series of facial features pass by on her face, reflecting inner conflict. And, yelling at Vera Miles, she spits out \"You, his loving, doting fraud of a father! And you, you SLUT! You're both so consumed with evil, so ROTTEN! Your filthy souls are too evil for Hell itself!\" Like, wow. There's a May-December aspect to this production that is a little suspect: when this film was made Crawford was 52 (referred to as a \"girl!\") and Robertson was 31. But such is movie magic that they seem somewhat younger. The soft focus on Crawford's face doesn't hurt, either. Finally, I must mention Maxine Cooper - Hammer's gal Velda in \"Kiss Me, Deadly\" - and, I think, a very promising but underrated actress. She should have had a better career than she had. Not just a sexy brunette, in \"Kiss Me, Deadly\" she read her lines in such a way that you could detect there was a real intelligence at work. Playful and yet knowing in an almost occult way. (After all, she names \"the Great Whatszit.\") She only has a small part in this as a nurse but gives the simple line \"How does your garden grow?\" real meaning. When she sees that Robertson sees his wife, she asks, \"*Now* how does your garden grow?\" My guess is that Aldrich liked directing her - and I wish she had made more films. So, I think \"Autumn Leaves\" is film noir and I certainly recommend it.\n\nA Face in the Crowd: This isn't just film noir - this is *brilliant* film noir! A mix of \"Nightmare Alley,\" \"God's Little Acre,\" \"The Sweet Smell of Success\" (there's a Sidney Falco-style character) and the Clinton Administration all thrown together. That rapidly-edited advertising sequence for the pep pill Vitagex must have seemed exceptionally over-the-top in 1957; it sure looked unusual to me in 2003. And this storyline had me guessing. I kept supposing that Lonesome Rhodes would meet his inevitable fall in his marriage to the underage Lee Remick - a sort of Jerry Lee Lewis storyline. (Except that this film would have been prophetic. The story about Lewis' 13 year old wife broke the following year, in 1958.) Instead, there's a wonderful and shadowy sequence where Patricia Neal ends Lonesome's career with some crucial audio board work in a television control booth. That made me think of the end of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" - a desperate attempt to do the right thing and to stop a dangerously powerful man. Speaking of film noir cinematography, it appeared to me that this film got darker and more shadowy as the plot progressed, being a sort of visual parallel for the dark forces at work. I also liked the elevator ride Griffith takes down from the penthouse to the garage; it reminded me of the end of \"the Grifters.\" A great visual metaphor. That ending is sublime, Griffith yelling \"Marsha, don't leave me!\" from the top of a Manhattan skyscraper to an uncaring city. But what impressed me the most about this film was Andy Griffith (his first movie!), who gave a loud, virile, leering, calculating, at times menacing and half crazy performance - a far cry from anything else he did since. I had no idea he could grab center stage that well. (I grew up watching him play Don Knott's straight man.) His Lonesome Rhodes is a memorable and worthy character to add to the cast of doomed figures in the Dark City. I loved this film, and I'm surprised to find that it isn't in the noir canon as a late period noir. I guess the hillbilly and comical aspects of it get in the way.\n\nLos Olvidados: A Luis Bunuel film about juvenile delinquents living in the Mexican slums, this might also be considered a \"social issues\" film or simply a foreign film, but it is as bleak and tragic as the most noirish noirs I have seen. Made in 1950, during the classic era. A fascinating film in that it is so direct and honest. Actually, it seems to be way ahead of its time... I caught it as it started on television one night and was fascinated.\n\nHigh School Big Shot: A neat thing about digging around b-films for noir content is occasionally finding a treasure. I found this one marketed as a teen-exploitation, or juvenile deliquent film (which the title strongly suggests), but, like \"The T-Bird Gang,\" it is less that than it is a late (1958) film noir with teen exploitation themes. At only 61 minutes it moves along quickly with an unusually bleak story line and credible acting and plotting throughout. The male lead, played by Tom Pittman, is especially good. He seems a little mature for high school, but that's a general fault of the teen genre (I have yet to see a production about high school starring identifiably high school age teens). Apparently life followed art somewhat - this was Pittman's last flick. An unhappy and troubled young star with feelings of inadequacy, shortly after this film he left a party drunk and crashed his custom Porsche in Benedict Canyon in L.A. - he wasn't found until twenty days or so later. This film was given the Mystery Science Fiction 3000 treatment, but I think it's too good for that. The final scenes, shot at the Port of Los Angeles, is quite fatalistic and noirish.\n\nWithout Warning!: A \"lost noir\" in that it has never been released on video before. The actors are all unknowns, and the running time is only 75 minutes. It was shot using the plain old black and white film stock that was commonly used in the industry back then - but it looked great. Shot in L.A., it featured cops in fedoras in the film noir sub-class known as a \"police procedural.\" Nothing remarkable, really. But the quality of the script, editing, music, character development and pacing was such that when it was over I thought, \"What a great little film!\" It features a remarkable pick-up scene with the murderer on the prowl and an awfully forward blonde. Hollywood needs to produce fewer blockbusters and more 75 minute gems like this one.\n\nMystery Street\n\n: Perhaps the first police procedural featuring forensic science, it features Ricardo Montalban as a police detective and Elsa Lanchester as a conniving busybody. Both are well cast and fascinating to watch. This one isn't featured in film noir literature, but it should be. A great, little-known noir gem!\n\nThe Big Night\n\n: A damned peculiar film noir starring John Barrymore Jr. (aka John Drew Barrymore). It's one of those \"rite of passage\" works, but this rite is in accordance with the Gospel of Noir. The plot: a shy and easily embarrassed young man turns seventeen, so his father presents him with a birthday cake at the bar in which he works. However, the young man's father is humiliated and savagely beaten in front of his son by a malevolent sports writer with a cane. Distraught and in search of revenge, the teen grabs his father's gun and goes after the sports writer. During the course of a long night he attends a boxing match, gets conned out of ten bucks by a hustler (Emile Meyer!) whom he later beats up in the men's room, insults a black woman, becomes drunk and wakes up in the apartment of a couple of sisters - one of who gives him his first kiss. He finds out that his father is a cad and shoots the sports writer and, thinking he murdered him, flees through some great-looking industrial sections of Los Angeles. At the end of the film he and his father are escorted away by the cops. Wow, all in the course of only 75 minutes!\n\nThis movie was directed by Joseph Losey, who produced another odd film, 1948's \" The Boy with the Green Hair.\" I mentioned a great-looking industrial area of Los Angeles... this would be near where some large natural gas towers are located. I know this area because, when I was about thirteen, my Mom had some business down there and took me with her. I recall sitting in the car looking at the bleak surroundings and fantasizing about running off with Kelly Beal - the thirteen year-old redhead who lived up the street near the railroad tracks - and finding a place somewhere in Los Angeles. Talk about hormonal. Finally, along with The Human Jungle this is the second noir I've seen with a Pabst Blue Ribbon beer sighting. As the protagonist is getting his birthday swats from his friends, guys are unloading boxes of PBR from a truck. How cool is that? Perhaps I should introduce a new sub-genre of film noir to the UCLA Film School: Pabst Noir.\n\nHollywoodland\n\n: I was struck by how alike it is to Chinatown. Both involve private detectives who specialize in seedy divorce/breakup cases, both feature an unfolding case seen from the private detective's perspective, both have people warning, \"You don't know what you're getting into,\" (but in the case of Hollywoodland there is no core secret of the type found in Chinatown), both feature a scene where the PI is using a camera, recovering consciousness from being slugged, etc. There are enough similarities that cause me to wonder if it's intentional on the part of the director. I recall reading once that there is no such thing as a coincidence in a movie (because they have to be assembled so painstakingly), so it must be intentional. Robert Towne, who wrote the much-praised screenplay for Chinatown, intended the film to be one part of a Southern California Trilogy, examining three elements that made the region what is it. For the record, they are water and farming (Chinatown), real estate (the sequel, The Two Jakes) and the film industry. The third film was never made. But, with Hollywoodland, there's an acceptable entry by a different screenwriter. One of the themes in Hollywoodland, that I wouldn't have expected to be present in a treatise about a celebrity suicide, is heroism. What, exactly constitutes being a hero? The film is about the death of George Reeves, the stereotypical 1950s Man who portrayed my generation's Superman for television. His reluctant and disparaging embrace of the role of hero is part of what drives the plot. A secondary plot - the private detective's failed relationship with his son - provides additional examination. This is an excellent film...\n\nAngel Face\n\n: An undervalued noir by Otto Preminger. Seeing it, I began to understand that while it is an utterly typical noir, it has an odd appeal of its own. So much so, in fact, that I think it's easily as good as Out of the Past - better even, as I've never liked that film as much as other noirheads. Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons are both excellent: he's a sleepy sap, she's a conniving femme fatale... without being obvious about it. This is one of the best in that it's a lot like Detour, a film you find yourself thinking about after you've seen it.\n\nCaged\n\n: Perhaps the penultimate women-in-prison film and a sort of female version of Brute Force. I liked watching the frightened Eleanor Parker turn into the tough-as-nails con at the end. A film that begged for a sequel - except they weren't doing sequels back then...\n\nThe Well\n\n: A film ahead of its time insofar as race relation films are concerned. The first half or so is noir, the latter half is a thriller. I found myself thinking, \"What a great little film!\" all though it.\n\nHickey and Boggs\n\n: With Robert Culp and Bill Cosby you're expecting a light-hearted \"I, Spy\" kind of thing. What you get instead is a bleak 1972 neo-noir set in the Los Angeles I remember well. Not a whole lot of fuss with this one, just a story well-told. I liked that Culp's character owns two classic Ford Thunderbirds in this...\n\nAppointment With Crime\n\n: As I've written before, one of the joys of watching old forgotten crime films is unexpectedly coming across something well-made, rare and unusual. Something completely unlike the indulgent, formulaic and creatively bankrupt big budget Hollywood fare in theaters currently. This is a Brit noir like that - good film, bad title. It starred as a criminal protagonist William Hartnell, who is far better known internationally as the original British television Doctor Who. Hartnell's Doctor was a jovial but sometimes petulant old man - always a humanitarian. On the whole, a positive if somewhat mysterious role model. As the criminal thug Leo Martin in this film he was ferret-like, vengeful, manipulative and utterly contemptible; he carried this film very well indeed. Also notable was Herbert Lom as a homosexual upper class kingpin and his flamboyantly limp-wristed companion (Hartnell calls him a \"Christmas Carol\"); I've never seen the like in a film this early. Suggestions of homosexuality are usually MUCH more subdued in film noir. There's also (bleeped out) swearing in this grim and desperate film... apparently there were also four overly-violent scenes cut as well. Appointment With Crime badly needs a quality restoration. What put it over the top for me, however, were some truly wonderful but brief character actor scenes - this film is so well cast it's a joy to watch. A film I thought would be completely unpromising became instead one of my favorite Brit noirs. I love when that happens!\n\nThe Story of Molly X: A chicks in prison film from the classic film noir era starring June Havoc - NOW we're talkin'! I love these. Havoc is as hardboiled as they get, and the mandatory cat fight scene is pretty good, too. What fun! Gravelly voiced noir guy Charles McGraw is thrown in for good measure as a relentless cop. Excellent.\n\nGideon of Scotland Yard: A Britnoir and therefore potentially overly polite, mannered and dull - but, ah, it's directed by John Ford, and this makes all the difference. It's a fun look at the day of an overworked London cop... amusing, fun and it moves right along. A minor gem starring a pre-Ben Hur Jack Hawkins.\n\nNo Questions Asked: A fine, classic period noir with all the usual trimmings (dark alleys, wet pavement, shadows, a femme fatale, a virtuous girl as counterpoint, a betrayal, thugs, fedoras, cigarette smoking) and a few surprises. Surprise #1: a pair of guys dressed as women pulling off a robbery in a ladies' waiting room - never saw that before! Surprise #2: A mobster boss who can hold his breath underwater for a long period of time. This comes into play at the end where he attempts to drown the protagonist, a clever plot point. This film stars Jean Hagen, an under-regarded actress. All in all, a very worthwhile entry into the genre.\n\nThe Narrow Margin: One of the best it-takes-place-on-a-train movies ever, with a surprising plot twist at the end (that I didn't expect). Marie Windsor and Charles McGraw are wonderful in this.\n\nBeast of the City: It doesn't get much more 1930s in style and tone than this fast-moving and great little pro-police flick. What makes it noir is the surprising and exceptionally violent end. (But why did it have to conclude with a passage from Brahms' Lullaby of all things?)\n\nNOT FAVORITES, BUT GOOD\n\nClasse Tous Risques : A French film noir from 1960. I liked it. How many man-on-the-run crime movies do you see where the protagonist has two children in tow after his wife is murdered? I'm also a sucker for productions showing street scenes in foreign cities in the 1950s and early 1960s - they're always so visually interesting. As is usual with French films, this one doesn't end, it just stops with a brief and laconic bit of dialogue and \"FIN\" splashed onto the screen.\n\nBlack Angel: An entertaining classic period film noir starring Dan Duryea who didn't slap any women around this time (that was his trademark in his early years). He played a far more sympathetic role as a heartbroken drunkard in this one, but, still, I kind of feel sorry for any actresses who had to act alongside him in other movies: Wap! Wap! Co-starring Peter Lorre and based on a Cornell Woolrich novel, it was interesting enough in the usual Woolrich fashion but had a really unlikely third act. Come on... no matter how drunk people get, they don't forget that they murdered somebody, right? Nevertheless, a fun movie.\n\nThe Prowler: It was quite good, sort of a variation of Double Indemnity in police uniform. The main thing I remember about it was a visually interesting peeling paint job on an interior wall at the film's conclusion - hahaha! Also, this is another one of those classic period films noir where a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer is seen - the protagonist is knocking them back in one scene. (It must have been a really popular beer back in the late 40's/50's.) Unusually for a period noir, a pregnancy becomes a major plot point. Van Heflin carried this film quite well as the protagonist. It has a good, fatalistic film noir conclusion.\n\nShakedown: It's about an over-ambitious and unscrupulous San Francisco newspaper photographer who attempts to set mobster against mobster for his own reasons (mainly, to get sensational shots) and winds up dead. Howard Duff plays a real creep. For a minor film this was pretty good; it sustained interest and the direction was tight and moved along - something modern filmmakers should learn.\n\nThe Racket: An enjoyable, standard film noir in most ways. Liz Scott is always fun to watch. Not to be confused with the 1928 silent film of the same name.\n\nThe Kremlin Letter: One of those cynical spy films like The Man Who Came in from the Cold and The Ipcress File. It was entertaining and moved right along, and had the requisite amount of negativity and downbeat style for it to qualify it as a neo-noir.\n\nThe Long Wait: An obscure and hard-to-find film noir starring Anthony Quinn, adapted from a Mickey Spillane story. As in Spillane's Kiss Me, Deadly (1955) it has the unlikely trope that every beautiful woman encountering the protagonist (and there are four) wants to make love to him. But Anthony Quinn - who looks and acts apelike - makes an unconvincing romantic leading man. The kissing scenes are brutish and the heads seem like two boxcars slamming together. The film's most interesting set piece is a curious scene taking place in a dark room lit by one light, where Quinn is tied up in a chair, and a beautiful blonde (who is also tied up) has to weirdly slither along a floor to get to him as the bad guy looks on gleefully. The film is very noir and contains another familiar noir trope: amnesia. The protagonist isn't sure who he is and learns that he's wanted for murder. Despite a bad start - a smarmy romantic ballad played over the opening credits - the film is entertaining and moves right along interestingly. It's very Spillane in that women are slapped around a lot. Bruno VeSota, a porcine character actor who nevertheless got a lot of work, is in it; prior to seeing this I thought that this particular actor's presence was a surefire indication that the film would suck, but this and Dementia (1956) are possible exceptions. The Long Wait may just be VeSota's best film!\n\nA Blueprint for Murder: A suspenseful and enjoyable noir that doesn't resolve the storyline until the final minute or two of playing time! I don't believe I have ever seen pacing like this in any other film. (Look at Jean Peters in that green dress - an order of magnitude bustier than she actually was...)\n\nTreasure of Monte Cristo: A film noir, sort of, with an awkward title. It wasn't bad... it was entertaining. Noir stalwart Steve Brodie is a crooked lawyer. An adult Dead End Kid Bobby Jordan is in it; he somehow manages to shoot out the tire of a passing sheriff's car with a revolver. Good shot! Sid Melton (one of the Green Acres carpenters) is an awful comedy relief, as is an obnoxious Italian old man. Part of a \"Forgotten Noir\" DVD collection.\n\nSky Liner: Entertaining, which is a real achievement since the majority of the film is set in the interior of a Lockheed Constellation while in flight. (There's a dead guy in the restroom!) The Connie is the real star of the film and upstages all the actors; it's interesting to see how people traveled by plane in 1949.\n\nTwo Men in Manhattan: A French film noir by Jean-Pierre Melville. It has the distinction of being a French film shot in New York City co-starring the director and featuring a great, jazzy background score. It's also short on plot and long on a cool mood and setting; this primarily exists as a sort of visual love letter to New York City at night - and it is definitely eye candy insofar as capturing the look of the city in 1959. That's the film's primary attraction. Melville's continuing interest in American noir is once again evident, as it was in Le Deuxieme Souffle, Le Samourai, Le Cercle Rouge and Bob Le Flambeur, but this film strikes me as perhaps the least of his noirs. The women in this, by the way, are all gorgeous. Most of them can even read their lines well.\n\nCosh Boy: A very entertaining British juvenile delinquency/film noir hybrid from 1953, Cosh Boy was distributed in the U.S. as The Slasher, since audiences weren't likely to know what a cosh is. Actually, this was a minor mystery... I had always thought a cosh was like a blackjack or a sap. But the dictionary claimed it's a club or a baton. The problem is that at the end of the film the Cosh Boy in question pulls out a straight razor and threatens to cut his newly-married Canadian step-father, who approaches him with belt drawn to deliver a much needed damn good whacking. So is a cosh also a blade? It's the first British film to receive an \"X\": rating. Why? Because the Cosh Boy gets a very young and beautiful Joan Collins pregnant, and there's some violence. James Kenney, as the title character, is excellent. He's a perfectly hateful little creep in this, much like Richard Attenborough in 1948's Brighton Rock. The cinenatography is very dark; this film cries out for a Criterion-style restoration and treatment.\n\nMurder by Contract: A cool little film noir from 1958, starring Vince Edwards (Dr. Ben Casey). There were some plot holes in it, but it was a spare, economically-told thriller that happens to have been a childhood favorite of Martin Scorsese. I liked it, too. It was interesting and entertaining, and had an odd electric guitar soundtrack.\n\nThe Big Bluff: An especially obscure film noir from 1955. I have seen hundreds of these and it's a very rare occasion when one turns up that I haven't seen. (That title, \"The Big (Whatever)\" is a film noir formula. When you see The Big... as a film title you know you're dealing with a film noir.) It was... entertaining. It was clear that this was a low budget production, but the direction, acting and plot were top notch. It was unusual in that it featured an homme fatale rather than the usual femme fatale - a handsome mustachioed slickster named Ricardo De Vila. I appreciated the scenes of a vengeful bongo player in a Nash Metropolitan - honest - shadowing a man who is carrying on with his wife. The Big Bluff also had a clever trick ending and Martha Vickers. Noirheads like me know Vickers as the wild and, it is suggested, nymphomaniacal sister of Lauren Bacall in the 1946 Humphrey Bogart noir The Big Sleep. She wasn't quite the hotsy-totsy vixen she was a decade prior but she was still part of an excellent cast.\n\nStereo: A German neo-noir with metaphysical/supernatural overtones. (It reminded me of the British neo-noir Dead Man's Shoes in that respect.) I liked it. The title \"Stereo\" is a bit puzzling.\n\nSin City 2: A Dame to Kill For: Perhaps I'm getting used to what I might call \"comic book noir\"; I liked this installment better than the first one. Oh, it still has some absolutely ridiculous neo-feminist fanboyz scenes - the Asian gal with the swords who effortlessly kills guards left and right - but at least I wasn't looking at my watch during this one. The acting is somewhat better than I recall in the first movie, too.\n\nThe Right Hand of the Devil: I have been waiting 42 years (!) to see this again! It's a seedy, tawdry, nasty, low budget film noir (with a couple of horror elements) I saw with my father one night on broadcast television in 1974. Somebody uploaded it to youtube. It was just as sleazy as I recall... but it was worth watching. The plot: a balding criminal kingpin arrives in Los Angeles to pull a heist. To do this he needs to seduce the woman who holds the key to the safe in the Los Angeles Sports Arena. Later, he attempts to kill her by drugging her and sending her in a car off a cliff. The highlight of the film takes place at the end: he finds her in a bar (but doesn't recognize her), and takes her to his apartment. She throws off her clothes and cries, \"You always liked my legs - here, HAVE ONE!\" and pitches her prosthetic leg at him and then shoots him in the head. Hahahahaha! Dad and I got a big laugh out of that part. It's no Double Indemnity, but it's fun.\n\nGangster Squad: This one was suggested to me by a friend because it contains some amusing Burbank (my hometown) references. The historical crooked Burbank police chief Elmer Adams (called here Elmer Jefferson) was depicted as dining with Mickey Cohen in a swank restaurant, which probably happened. The corruption certainly did. But, by and large, this movie was not historically accurate. It was mainly an exercise in style, containing a lot of automatic Tommy Gun fire a la a 1930's film. By 1949 this was not how the mob was doing things. The plot was an inferior version of The Untouchables (1987). (Which, in turn, was an inferior version of the 1950's television series.)\n\nOutside the Wall: A not bad Richard Basehart flick about a man getting out of prison after spending half his life within. Needless to say, he is tempted to pursue crime in The Big City, or even the little town. Is he headed back to prison or will he find love with a virtuous woman and stay out of prison?\n\nLarceny: With John Payne, Shelley Winters (in full mouthy blonde bombshell mode) and slappin' Dan Duryea, who, as it turns out, doesn't slap any women in this one. But there's a great little scene where John Payne slaps Shelley Winters and she whacks him back. Larceny is a good, if fairly standard, example of the film noir genre, and a nice little exposition of the art of the grift - the way of the con man. It stands with House of Games (1987) and The Grifters (1990) in that respect. It hasn't yet been released in DVD. Why ever not?\n\nMr. Soft Touch: This one was very odd. The first twenty minutes or so started out as fairly standard, but good, film noir. Then there's a big middle section that suddenly and weirdly changed into something like a Frank Capra Christmas comedy, and the final ten minutes or shifted back into film noir. It's as if the directors (there were two) intended to make very different films! Watchable... but strange.\n\nCry of the Hunted: Directed by Joseph H. Lewis - who had an unfailing ability to take rote material and elevate it into something worthwhile. (Terror in a Texas Town (1958), involving Sterling Hayden as a Swedish whaler out for revenge in the Old West, is Exhibit A. Hayden brings a harpoon to a gunfight!) Cry of the Hunted is a bit odd in that it contains some rather subtle homosexual overtones between the dogged police pursuer and his prey. (The plot involves a cop going after a man on the run in the Louisiana swamp country.) I'm guessing that period audiences either didn't get it or shrugged it off. These days, however, it seems odd and out of place.\n\n23 Paces to Baker St.: This one was okay. It's a Hitchcockish tale about a blind man (Van Johnson) who overhears a kidnapping plot.\n\nThe Flesh is Weak: A British production starring John Derek, an American. (Those types of productions are always suspect.) It's about the London prostitution racket - and it was considerably more blunt about it than an American production from the period would have been. No nudity and nothing explicit, but it was out of the storytelling norms for 1957. It wasn't bad.\n\nRepeat Performance: The plot: a woman (Joan Leslie) murders her husband, regrets it, and gets the year to live over again to change the events leading to the murder. It was horribly melodramatic and featured hoity-toity upper-class characters talking endlessly in rooms, but the more I think about it the more I liked it. My final assessment is that it was... okay. Good. Worth watching.\n\nImpulse: I regard this as a minimally acceptable film noir (in this case a Britnoir), the story of a man bored with his domestic situation who gets involved with a beautiful woman (Constance Smith), thugs, gunfire and stolen diamonds. Not boring, the femme fatale is interesting and the story moves along in a 80 minute run time.\n\nSnatch: An entertaining and original British gangster film/comedy about jewel thieves. The British output with crime films is somewhat spotty - most of the time Britnoirs are too mannered and polite to really be good. But when they do a good one, it's really good: Appointment with Crime (1946), Brighton Rock (1947), They Made me a Fugitive (1947), No Orchids for Miss Blandish (1948), Get Carter (1971) and The Long Good Friday (1980) come to mind. Snatch joins them.\n\nTake My Life: The first film directed by Ronald Neame, who would later become a major player. The plot is not far removed from an earlier film noir, Phantom Lady (1944). In Take My Life, a wife must investigate and prove that her husband isn't a murderer. (In Phantom Lady it's a boss-secretary relationship.) The movie is told in a subtle flashback by a favorite British character actor, Francis L. Sullivan; he played Nossross in Night and the City (1950), a favorite film noir, and Mr. Bumble in David Lean's Oliver Twist (1948), arguably the greatest movie, ever. When I see Sullivan in a production my interest perks up. Good film!\n\nBoth Sides of the Law: An entertaining flick showing policewomen work in postwar London/ Peggy \"Gun Crazy\" Cummins plays an annoying twit.\n\nGang Busters: A cheap, nasty, thrown-together b-film about prison breaks in Oregon cobbled together from three television episodes. Yet it works! Fun to watch.\n\nThe House of the Arrow: Oscar Homolka - a fascinating character - totally dominates this British whodunnit as a French detective. A charming film, but, sadly, some of the dialogue is very difficult to make out because of dialects.\n\nThe Crooked Circle: An okay boxing film. The same plot as the much superior The Set-Up, but watchable.\n\nExposed: A very brief (45 minutes!) Republic noir starring the pretty and well-tailored Adele Mara as a snappy blonde private eye - sort of a prototype Honey West, actually. There's a funny fight scene in this one where a little guy prevails - somehow - over a much bigger guy. Worth watching for the patter from Mara.\n\nRoses are Red: A silly title and an likely premise: a District Attorney and a crook (both played by Don Castle) are identical twins and plans are made by thugs to switch one with the other - but through the miracle of effective direction and a good cast, it works.\n\nThe Guilty: Based on a Cornell Woolrich story, a murder mystery dealing with, this time, identical sisters. Starring Don Castle who played identical men in Roses are Red! Also stars Bonita Granville, who is always fun. There are some nicely noir streets and interiors in this one, Regis Toomey as a cop and a switcheroo trick ending. Not bad at all.\n\nOnce a Thief: Not bad. Caesar Romero and June Havoc make this one worth watching.\n\nMissing Women: A Republic quickie. A woman and her husband are married all of an hour when he's shot dead by thugs. The Mrs. goes after them! Not bad. But Missing Women? There was only one!\n\nJohnny Stool Pigeon: A competent police procedural with Howard Duff, Dan Duryea and Shelley Winters - who was a far more appealing and winsome character when she was young than later on.\n\nPickpocket: A Robert Bresson minimalist noir; one of those 1950's French films with tons of interesting shots and style.\n\nExperiment Alcatraz: An odd, budget film about inmates subjected to a new radioactive therapy; one goes crazy and murders his friend. Or is he really crazy and there's more to it than that? A film just oddball enough in plot (irradiated inmates) to maintain interest and short enough in running time not to lose it/\n\nPhilo Vance's Gamble: After an unpromising beginning, it moves along satisfactorily. Actually, I think I like Alan Curis' take on the character better than William Powell's! The sidekick is funny.\n\nOne Way Out: On the very edge of British yawndom, what redeems this one is the tragic ending.\n\nUnmasked: Raymond Burr is a wonderful villain in this one, and that's what makes it worthwhile.\n\nWoman in Hiding: Ida Lupino! Married to a creep! That's what makes this one good. You always root for Ida Lupino!\n\nViolated: A cheesy, amateur film about a psychopath who scalps women. This one looks a lot like Killer's Kiss, and has some great location shots of New York City in the early 1950's.\n\nThe Obsessed: David Farrar stars in this Victorian whodunnit with a Scotland Yard detective and a good twist at the end. Otherwise, kind of Meh.\n\nThe Spider: Richard Conte plays a snappy private eye in this 1945 one hour whodunnit. Rote, but not bad.\n\nNo Man's Woman: A great vehicle for Marie Windsor as a thorough rotter everyone else in the cast wants to see dead.\n\nThree Crooked Men: A mildly exciting British heist film. Interest is sustained via the characters, not the plot.\n\nPink String and Sealing Wax: The plot is noir, the setting is Victorian. It stars Googie Withers as a femme fatale murderess - which is all I need to maintain interest because there are no bad Googie Withers films!\n\nThe Embezzeler: A Britmovie that is much more like a segment from one of those W. Somerset Maugham anthologies than it is a Britnoir of its own, but it is watchable and rather fun.\n\nThe Impersonator: A 1961 Britmovie with just enough atmosphere, creepiness and interest to make it worthwhile. The child protagonist in this is quite good.\n\nSteel Jungle: The \"steel jungle\" of the title being a prison... this is a pretty decent jail flick starring reliable heavy Ted DeCorsia as the baddie behind bars. Things start off slow with this one, but pick up. All in all, an enjoyable and somewhat different prison flick.\n\nInside Detroit: A rare film starring Pat O'Brian as a gangster; another Irishman, Dennis O'Keefe, is his adversary. The United Auto Workers are portrayed as an entity avoiding mob rule at all cost, which I found odd and even condescending. Nevertheless, this was an enjoyable film.\n\nCity of Shadows: Stars that lovable mug Victor McLaglen in a sympathetic role. Anthony Caruso also stars as a crim.\n\nHomicide: A not bad Warner Bros. flick with Alan Alda's dad.\n\nAngela: A sort of wannabe Double Indemnity, Italian Style. Film noir stalwart Dennis O'Keefe plays a man who becomes a sap for beauteous (and I do mean beauteous) Mara Lane, who steals every scene she's in. The primary reason to watch this one is, 1.) Lane, and 2.) The incredible 1950's Italian cars. I wish I knew what they were... Why can't we make cars with style and individuality like the Italians did in the 1950's? Have we forgotten how to bend sheet metal into curves? Cars all look alike now.\n\nJennifer: A thriller starring Ida Lupino, one of my favorite B-film queens! She can play innocent and frightened as easily as she can portray tough and hardboiled. She and her husband Collier Young later went on to produce \"women's interest\" films of their own (bigamy and unwed motherhood are two subjects that spring to mind), which she produced. Anyway, I saw this one a decade or so ago but forgot to note it in my guide. An effective little thriller.\n\nValerie: A film noir in the guise of a Western, this one was rather hard to watch as it was nearly ninety minutes of Sterling Hayden abusing his wife, played by Anita Ekberg (the \"Valerie\" of the title). Insults, slapping, cigar burns... Hayden made a first class heel, however. By the end of the film you were hoping that somebody would shoot him full of holes.\n\nNightmare: A superior remake of Cornell Woolrich's Fear in the Night; this one stars Kevin McCarthy in the DeForest Kelley role and Edward G. Robinson. I like this one better than the original; Robinson lifts it.\n\nThe Truth About Murder: Let's pretend that teen sleuth Nancy Drew (Bonita Granville), inspired by her lawyer father Carson Drew, graduates from law school and b"
