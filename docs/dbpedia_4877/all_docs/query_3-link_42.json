We have also gained a lot from attenders and speakers of the annual Comedy conferences at the University of Salford in 2007–11. We would like to thank Matthew Frost, the readers of our proposal and all at Manchester University Press who have had a hand in shaping this book. John would like to thank colleagues and students at the University of Central Lancashire and the University of Salford for sharing an enthusiasm for comedy and particularly to thank the School of Media Music and Perform­ ance at Salford for a period of sabbatical leave. As always, thanks to Karen, Ellyn and Alice. Glyn would like to thank colleagues past and present for help with this project, and the following individuals, without attempting to shift any blame to them: Douglas Field, for timely reassurance; Peter Krämer, for advice on teaching comedy film; Alan Peterson, for detailed feedback; Ian W. White, for as far back as I can remember; Michaela Schoop, for retaining a sense of humour and creating the cover illustrations; and Edmund, William and Greta for learning jokes along the way.\n\n[ vii ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 7\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nTo students of comedy\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 8\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nIntroduction\n\nO\n\nur aims in writing this book have been fourfold. Firstly, we want to produce a wide-ranging introductory academic book for students and teachers interested in studying comedy on film, television and radio (and for anyone else with an analytic interest in these media). Secondly, we want to discuss key issues around comedy through analysis of significant and revealing comedy texts from these media. Thirdly, on the basis of our teaching experiences, we want to show students how to respond to comedy analytically; that is, to write about it interestingly and originally, referring to – but differing from – other writers on the same or similar comedic texts. Finally, we hope to point the way for new research in the area, knowing that we couldn’t possibly cover all aspects of this vast field alone.\n\nOur focus and the choices we have made The title of this book, Laughing Matters, signals both our focus on comedy and our belief in its social, psychological and cultural importance. Still a relatively mysterious form of human behaviour, laughter appears to be a universal human experience. One research study suggests that we laugh, on average, eighteen times a day, mostly in the evening, and mostly owing to common social incidents rather than formal jokes (Rappoport 2005: 25). In this book our focus is on professional comedy, and particularly the films, programmes, jokes, gags, slapstick and narrative situations that are produced by people whose job it is to make us laugh. This is not to deny the importance of what we might call everyday laughter that runs throughout all our lives, as when we share a joke with a work colleague, or laugh at some incident on the street. Such ‘amateur’ moments of laughable incongruity are important, but they are not something that can – or indeed should – be recreated for a wider audience since, as we often say when we attempt unsuccessfully to recount the joke, ‘you had to be there’. Instead we highlight film, television and radio as the key media in delivering comedy for mass consumption. Of course ‘comedy’ is not just a genre but a meta-genre far beyond the scope of a project of this size to encompass entirely. Among the media and performance modes that we largely or wholly [1]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 1\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nL au g h i n g M at t e r s neglect are stand-up comedy, cabaret, stage comedy from revue to farce, comic novels and poems, satirical literature, blogs, periodicals (including ‘comics’), cartoons, everyday face-to-face amateur joke-telling and the circulation of jokes on mobile phones and comedy clips via the internet. Even where there are strong links to the three media we have chosen to highlight, we make no apology for leaving these others out because the project is sufficiently (if not over-) ambitious anyway. We hope that what we have chosen to exclude will point others towards further research in those areas. There are other exclusions. We have focused on British and American comedy across the media we cover. These two nations may be ‘divided by a common language’ but are consistent reference points for one another, more or less visible, across the Atlantic. In cinema, the relationship is usually very one-sided with Hollywood dominating, though British film productions occasionally make a splash (Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Full Monty). Contributions to Hollywood cinema by performers who began in Britain have certainly been significant (consider, for example, the careers of Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel, Cary Grant and Bob Hope). The few American sitcoms that establish themselves on British television have been, and are, hugely influential in the UK (from the evergreen The Phil Silvers Show aka Sergeant Bilko, to Cheers, Friends and Curb Your Enthusiasm), yet there are several examples of British television products making an impact in America, too (some examples might be Monty Python’s Flying Circus, Till Death Us Do Part via All in the Family and The Office). While we recognise debates that argue for distinctive comic sensibilities across cultures and even within sub-cultures, and which discuss important determinants such as ethnicity, national identity and regionalism, we believe that there is sufficient Anglo-American interaction in our chosen media, whether it is direct or through translation and/or influence, for us to discuss British and American material together, noting the significant differences in production contexts where relevant. We leave it to other, more specialised, studies to excavate in depth what is distinctive about comedy in relation to particular nations (see Medhurst 2007) and regions (see Russell 2004). It is worth noting at this point that though Anglo-American comedy is substantial and vast, it is a smaller field than English-language comedy. But to even begin to include comedies produced in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and elsewhere, most of which have not reached British or American screens, would consume too much precious word-count. Sorry Kath and Kim (2002–7). Once again, we hope that what we have chosen to exclude will point others towards further research in those areas. Within the boundaries we have set ourselves, what do we actually mean by comedy? Laughing certainly matters, but comedy and laughter are not synonymous and, as we suggested above, much of our laughter is provoked by everyday social interaction, not what we might call ‘professional comedy’. The [2]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 2\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nintroduction link between laughter and comedy is one of both expectation and anticipation. If a film, radio or television comedy text possesses any level of ambition, it should intend to produce laughter and is usually explicit about this intent. Comedic texts are, in fact, often prepared to use any means necessary in order to achieve that goal whether it is by innovation, by boundary-challenging or by repetition, recycling and rewriting. Importantly, these mediated, performative texts provide a context for laughter, generic ‘cues’ that encourage laughter as a ‘natural’ and legitimate response. Comedy is a commodity that develops and builds upon what has gone before in a number of generic forms within the media we cover. Film, radio and television have been recorded or are recordable in analogue and now digital forms, in ways that allow us to see both their links and lineages. This is not true of their entire histories, and absences in the history of all three media are to be lamented. However, even before reproduction was technologically possible, comedy appeared in forms that were reproducible such as sketches and routines. Gags erase their history pretty quickly with a change of performer, or of narrative context. Comedy has always recycled itself, building originality out of an intertextual combination of what has gone before (and what hasn’t). This shows comedy texts having some of the characteristics of postmodernity before theoretical access to ‘postmodernism’ in any medium. It is certainly a uniquely complex meta-genre, as we shall see when we discuss theories of comedy below. Creating successful comedy in our selected media requires such heterogeneous strategies and approaches because audiences, taste and times change. As William Goldman (1996: 39) has said of the film industry’s ability to predict success, ‘nobody knows anything’, and this applies almost across the board to comedy in film, television and radio when it comes to judging what will and what won’t succeed. It is also difficult to predict what will endure in audience affections and become canonised as a ‘classic’. This is a way of saying that not all our choices will be well known or entirely representative and that in the future their selection may look distinctly odd (or indeed very perceptive). Have we got room to be genuinely comprehensive within the media we aim to cover? No. We certainly can’t examine everything. Comedy’s essential heterogeneity would make it difficult to cover the entire topic coherently even if it were not so vast. There are exhaustive efforts to do so elsewhere for single media such as Lewisohn (1998, 2003b) on British television, Siegel and Siegel (1994) and Austerlitz (2010) on American cinema and Wertheim (1979) on radio. One of the dangers of covering comedy across three media is that of merely producing a set of shallow historical surveys (‘and then … and then …’) that reiterate an existing canon of material. We won’t be wholly able to escape this danger since we must take our aim to be a teaching textbook seriously and deal primarily with material that is readily available, but we will select comedy texts that are illuminating in their own right and/or revealing in the way they [3]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 3\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nL au g h i n g M at t e r s have previously been interpreted by other commentators. Our concentration on specific texts alongside the need to survey the field is necessary, because, without attentive examination through close reading, little can be added to our knowledge of comedy material. It is the uniqueness and the specificity of comedy in recordable media we focus on, presenting us with one-off moments that can be enjoyed again and again and analysed.\n\nAnalysing comedy Despite André Bazin’s view that comedy is the most serious genre in Hollywood, since it reflected ‘the deepest moral and social beliefs in American life’ (Bazin 1982), there has been resistance to analysing comedy in all of the media we are concerned with. It is perhaps most clearly seen in relation to film, as Andrew Horton notes: ‘there is a historical bias against a close and serious consideration of comedy. That comic films seldom win Academy Awards even though comedy reigns at the box office (six out of the top ten selling films in 1988) is only the latest example in a long history of criticism that has viewed comedy as inferior to other genres in Western culture’ (1991: 2). If Horton’s evidence seems a little outdated, then the box office top tens for both 1998 and 2008 can also be invoked and both also show five comedies earning more than $100 million in America alone. If we include Computer Generated Image (CGI) animations predicated on comedy, such as A Bug’s Life (1998) and Kung Fu Panda (2008), the significance of comedy to cinema only becomes clearer. Comedy’s commercial viability and lack of critical attention seem to be related. Comedy films are seldom culturally prestigious and are usually ignored by polls of ‘the best’ films, but they are reliable money earners, the bread and butter of the industry, capable of spectacular success. The same appeal to audiences and relative lack of attention paid by critics is apparent in critical response to television and radio comedy, too. Stott summarises the situation in the following way: ‘Comedy’s denigration in academic study is a product of its populism’ (2005: 148). An academic book (to our way of thinking at least) on the ‘lowbrow’ subject of comedy in popular media is necessary today, but outside of the academy any publication which aims to analyse comedy and humour seems anathema to many practitioners, anti-intellectuals and cultural snobs (among others). It has its echoes in the commonly expressed fear on the part of students that if we analyse comedy it will cease to be funny for us. There are a number of ripostes to this. Firstly, the implication is comparable to saying that being able to read music inhibits one’s ability to appreciate it. Secondly, the field of comedy is far broader than just the things that make us laugh personally and anyone studying it may choose to target those pieces they don’t find funny in the first place. Rightly, Andy Medhurst rebels against doing this, foregrounds his subjectivity and explores what makes him laugh, confident that ‘knowing [4]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 4\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nintroduction how comedy works, understanding its internal conventions, its performative dimensions and its ideological implications, causes no harm to its pleasurability unless the comedy under scrutiny was flawed from the outset’ (2007: 6). The fear of finding that we shouldn’t be laughing at what makes us laugh, coupled with the generally low academic status of humour (not to mention the constant attacks on media as a subject worthy of serious academic study) conspires to counsel caution in analysing comedy. Who knows what we might uncover? These fears may also determine why more usual ways of writing about comedy deflect interest away from how the comedy works. Recent writers on the subject, such as Mills (2005), Medhurst (2007) and Deleyto (2009), argue strongly that far too little criticism of comedy focuses on the actual performance, delivery and sources of the humour. The interest in and affection for comedic performers and certain comedic texts has generated a lot of writing which instead assumes biographical and anecdotal form. Nostalgia and reminiscence are clearly acceptable frames through which to view comedy, but too often this material falls prey to the tendency to make comedic performers their own auteurs, responsible for all aspects of writing, production and performance of those media they appear in. While the history of comedy certainly features several true renaissance men and women, such approaches neglect the other aspects of the production context and the performers they work with. Auteurism, star studies and the industrial reliability of comedian-led comedy also provide tracks for academic criticism to follow but these are ultimately constraining if rigidly adhered to, at least in terms of what we hope to achieve here. Certainly material must be delivered by the appropriate performer(s) and in the right medium for that humour. Thus Buster Keaton’s screen persona in his silent films is a key to their success, as is the rapport and particular range of silly voices that gave British radio’s The Goon Show (1951–60) its unique character. Performers are interesting subjects, but the period in which they are at the cutting edge of comedy, or are otherwise vitally in tune with their time, may be brief. The nexus of things that makes comedy work ought not to be reduced to individuals, even where they are a driving force. Therefore we will not proceed entirely through personalities (performers, writers, directors) but will also highlight individual texts with little regard for their authorship. Though claims that laughter is somehow ‘universal’ have some validity, the historical specificity of comedy must also be acknowledged as significant. In-depth archival work on a huge scale would be required to place our selected comedic texts in full historical context for a project of this scope, but an awareness of these media products as historical artefacts is something we encourage. There is clear evidence, just from the century our chosen media have been operational, that comedy tastes change over time. Did everyone find Laurel and Hardy funny when the films were originally screened, and does everyone today still find them funny? The sustained appeal of certain [5]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 5\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nL au g h i n g M at t e r s performers and texts to minority audiences can certainly be instructive, but supposedly ‘timeless’ comedy is actually just material from the past that has an appeal to the present. Identifying what an audience will find funny today is difficult enough for contemporary comedy producers but guessing exactly what they found funny in the past is perhaps even more so. It is one reason that discussion of comedy often comes down to personalities. Box-office returns, together with listener and viewer ratings, seem to suggest that audiences have found this or that performer funny at that particular time. We may also find them more or less amusing, to a degree, but can we be sure that we are laughing at the same things that appealed to contemporary audiences? Such assumptions are sometimes quickly elided, but we need to remember they are there. In our work we have to be aware of our early twenty-first century context and the influence it has on our understanding (and lack of understanding) of historical texts. Writing about comedy is a lesson in subjectivity. One person’s sense of humour is different from the next, but even if we laugh at the same time it is not clear whether we are laughing at exactly the same thing or exactly what aspect of the thing (line, event, image) sparks our laughter. What seems certain is that being surrounded by other people laughing at comedic material (except when we are the object of their laughter) makes it easier for us to laugh. Another key factor is our awareness of genre and the way in which comedic texts establish a ‘“conspiratorial” relationship with the viewer (reader)’ (Horton 1991: 9) or gather what Brett Mills calls ‘comic impetus’ (2009: 5–6). When we turn on our televisions to watch a programme called Michael McIntyre’s Comedy Roadshow, we have a good idea of what to expect. Thus primed, we are ready for the comedy text to deliver, but our experiences of rolling in the aisles are likely to be far fewer than we might have hoped for. What are we looking for as the primary comedy experience? Whether it is the silent comedians’ hierarchical categories of ‘the titter, the yowl, the belly laugh and the boffo’ (Palmer 1987: 101), or Ken Dodd’s more concise scheme of ‘titters, woofers and belters’, that primary experience is laughter. Comedy’s aim of producing a physical reaction from its audiences puts it in the disreputable company of other genres aiming for a physical response, such as horror (see Paul (1994) on links between horror and comedy) and pornography. Initial critical analyses of media texts preferred to look to respectable literary models instead, and as a result, as Stott suggests: ‘a recurrent problem of comedy criticism is its focus on structure and plot’ (2005: 31). Narrative coherence is by no means the key to comedy. Henry Jenkins, responding to early sound film in What Made Pistachio Nuts?: Early Sound Comedy and the Vaudeville Aesthetic (1992), explores the differing emphases of different comedy texts in relation to gags, lead performers, performance styles and self-reflexivity. Jenkins’s (1992: 129–32) criteria for analysing coherence in narrative comedy are summarised below: [6]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 6\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nintroduction 1 Narrative Integration: Is the emphasis on narrative or gags? 2 Character Integration: How well do character roles fit the star personae? 3 Expressive Coherence: How coherent are the actors’ individual performances? 4 Ensemble Consistency: Is there a ‘homogeneity of performance style’ among the performers or not? 5 Consciousness of Audience: Do the performers work as though there was a fourth wall between them and the camera or do they play to the audience? Using these criteria, Jenkins establishes an opposition between what he calls anarchistic comedy and affirmative comedy. In an anarchistic comedy the emphasis would be on gags over narrative, star persona over character, with less than coherent performances and no homogeneity of style across the cast, who may possibly show some awareness of the audience. The opposite emphasis, on narrative, character, homogeneity and maintaining the fourth wall, is typical of the romantic comedy or what Jenkins calls ‘the affirmative comedy’. The two types are never, however, mutually exclusive: ‘The disintegrative aspect of anarchistic comedy – the comedy of disorder – almost always coexists with the integrative aspect of romantic comedy – a comedy of reordering – though the emphasis given the two plots shifts from film to film across historical periods’ (1992: 236). A strong, involving and affecting narrative can increase comic dividends, but as Horton points out, ‘No plot is inherently funny’ (1991: 1). A genuinely funny sequence, something that goes beyond a ‘bit’ and reaches what Palmer calls ‘comic articulation’ (1987: 98–113), is gold. A few genuinely effective – because they raise laughs – scenes, sequences, catchphrases or characters will sell a comedy text to audiences much more successfully than the consistent level of achievement in the film, sitcom or sketch show they appear in. The basics, beyond reception context, are then relatively simple according to Palmer: ‘any event – in order to be funny – should simultaneously be surprising, implausible and plausible’ (1987: 136). Let us suggest some famous comedy sequences that illustrate this: • a starving Charlie Chaplin eating his boots in The Gold Rush (1925) • Jack Benny pausing to consider his response to a mugger’s demand for ‘Your money or your life’ in his radio vehicle, The Jack Benny Show (1948) • Del-Boy (David Jason) falling through a bar counter while attempting to ‘play it cool’ in the situation comedy Only Fools and Horses (1989) • the exchange ‘Well you started it!’ ‘No, you started it; you invaded Poland’ in the Fawlty Towers episode ‘The Germans’ (1975) • Cameron Diaz gelling her hair with Ben Stiller’s semen in There’s Something About Mary (1998). [7]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 7\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nL au g h i n g M at t e r s Such comedy is memorable, recountable, repeatable; but why? What exactly is it that is funny about these images or scenes? There will be important details for you that we’ve missed out, especially for any of them that are unfamiliar. This brings the additional question about how much context do we need to know to understand the gag? Anyone attempting to recount a humorous incident from their own life which they found far funnier than any of the examples cited above may find it impossible to convey the humour to others, leaving them with the wry conclusion along the lines of ‘I guess you had to be there at the time’. Content is important, but establishing the comic context is key. As anyone who has tried to tell a joke knows, it isn’t simply dependent on the narrative or the cleverness of the words; a joke has to be performed or, as it is customarily put, ‘delivered’. To do this well requires a combination of distinct attitude, build-up, facial expression, body language and timing. If some of these are good enough, and if the audience is sufficiently warmed up, the quality of the joke becomes less and less important. This is why some ‘much-loved’ sitcoms bear repetition so well. To focus in particular on just one of the sequences recalled above; Del-Boy’s brother, Rodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst), is distinctly taller than him and may, perhaps, have been even more spectacular when toppling rigidly through the unexpectedly open counter, since he has further to fall, but the laughs (coming partly because of surprise at this particular piece of slapstick intruding into a largely verbal sitcom) are heavily dependent on Del-Boy’s misplaced confidence in his being master of any situation. Punctured pomposity is funnier than sheer haplessness. In fact in each of our examples there is a level of delusion or a refusal of reality: a way for the audience to understand some aspect of the context\n\n1 Buster Keaton with the two loves in his life, the train and the girl (Marion Mack), in The General (1926). See pages 41–2.\n\n[8]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 8\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nintroduction better than the characters in each case: You can’t eat boots; life is better than money; Del-Boy is not, as he imagines, cool; Basil Fawlty is not, as he imagines, (currently) sane; semen isn’t hair gel. Does this understanding lead to feelings of superiority or of sympathy? Do we take pleasure in knowing (or imagining) we are not that hungry, that stingy, that embarrassed, that tactless or that innocent? Or do we feel relief because we recognise that while we, too, are potentially prey to hunger, robbery, accidents and misunderstandings these particular mishaps have not happened to us? Answers to these questions would not exhaust all that might be said about any of these sequences. Comedies (and jokes) are particularly resistant to being reduced to one meaning, seemingly preferring a range of possibilities which they (and we) arbitrarily close off with an ‘ending’ or by wilfully imposing a single ‘meaning’. Critical and cultural neglect of comedy (‘It’s only a joke/ comedy’) stems from allowing the often quite arbitrary endings of comedy narratives to stand for resolution of the issues raised (see Stott 2005: 148). The more familiar we are with the ways in which comedy works, the more easily we can identify the relevant issues in the texts. To introduce what these issues might be we need to survey the academic field of comedic study and address the critical work that has preceded ours.\n\nThe field It has been a commonplace complaint in earlier books on comedy that the subject has suffered from analytical neglect, but this is increasingly a relative statement. In the past it has been true, partly because of belated academic recognition of the media themselves, partly because the task of attaining academic credibility ordained that areas such as comedy, perceived as frivolous in a field sometimes accused of being itself entirely frivolous, were not the first to be focused upon. Over the extended development of this project, even when chapters have been written, in addition to new groundbreaking comedies appearing and ‘classic’ comedies becoming hard to get hold of, despite the wonder of YouTube, new academic material has regularly been published making this a sometimes Sisyphean struggle. This problem is exacerbated because we are attempting to cover a broad area. Our approach is part film studies, part media studies and part cultural studies within a socio-historical contextualisation. Our positions within each of these academic areas could be further exhaustively broken down, but we leave those who might be interested in the results to do so. The point is that comedy is of interest to a number of disciplines. The first critics studying comedy in twentieth-century media, finding themselves in a new field, tended to want to map the whole thing comprehensively, only to find their maps did not suit those coming after them. Gerald Mast (1979; first published 1973) begins with definitions of comedy that he [9]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 9\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nL au g h i n g M at t e r s knows other will protest against. He himself vehemently argues against the more metaphorical approach of Raymond Durgnat in The Crazy Mirror (1969), while Jerry Palmer (1987) finds Mast irritatingly eclectic and hampered by his literary obsession with plot. Steve Seidman (1979, 1981) finds early writers too unfocused, and praises Stuart Kaminsky’s systematisation (2nd ed. 1985), while introducing his own concept of ‘comedian comedy’. Comedian comedy, now a critically recognised genre, focuses on the parallel tensions between the comedian’s character conforming to the society represented in the film’s narrative and the comedian’s pre-established star persona conforming to the film’s generic contract to provide comedy (1981: 3). Henry Jenkins (1992), in focusing on early sound comedy, begins to find the flaws in Seidman (defining the genre by criteria which really apply only to a specific historical period), yet Jenkins is in turn taken to task by Mark Winokur (1996) for neglecting what he sees as the overarching theme of ethnicity (as indicated by his title American Laughter: Immigrants, Ethnicity, and 1930s Hollywood Film Comedy). Ethnicity joins those recurrent academic frames which are the usual suspects in approaches to comedy (race, class and gender), since areas of conflict are also commonly areas for comedy. We find that difference, while fundamental to humanity, has proved quite difficult for human cultures to negotiate. Complex and intelligent as human beings are, there appears to be a real difficulty in our assimilating the fact that others are not identical with ourselves. Where there is difference we subjectively define ourselves in relation to it, usually seeing ourselves in the best light by assigning negative characteristics, or at least inferior ones, to those who are different in whatever ways we deem to be important. As Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick points out: ‘It is astonishing how few respectable conceptual tools we have for dealing with this self evident fact [of difference]. A tiny number of inconceivably coarse axes of categorization have been painstakingly inscribed in current critical and political thought: gender, race, class, nationality, sexual orientation are pretty much the available distinctions’ (1990: 22). Contemporary critical approaches to comedy tend to highlight one or the other of these axes. For example, Gray (1994) and Rowe (1995) focus on gender, Winokur (1996) and Rappoport (2005) on ethnicity, and Beach (2002) on class. Choosing to focus on a range of these axes, rather than exclusively on one, we open ourselves to criticism from all those who come afterwards, though, as we have made clear, the expectations applied much depend on what each subsequent writer and critic aims to achieve. This is the point where we, if we wanted to, ought to start getting in some kicks at our predecessors. In the belief, however, that we are taking part in a noble enterprise, we claim to be standing on the shoulders of giants (though even this phrase may have originated as a joke), in fact several giants, at once. Comedy texts, unlike criticism, do not have to be consistent in their approach, or in what they target and hit and therefore we haven’t committed [ 10 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 10\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nintroduction ourselves to any particular aspect of comedy in order to be free to choose the most productive approach to any given comedic text. Our attitude is that comedy is so heterogeneous, so diverse (often within the same text), that there is no single approach that can answer every circumstance (nor do we imply that foregoing writers believe this). It is simply wise to draw on a range of available approaches to explain different comedic phenomena in the most productive fashion possible and this is the approach we recommend. We don’t expect that everyone will agree with our analyses, our choice of texts or this approach.\n\nTheories of comedy Abstract debate on the theory of comedy can be, as Gerald Mast acknowledged, ‘a quicksand out of which many never climb’ (1979: 3). Despite numerous impor­­­tant and illuminating contributions to understanding comedy, there is no one overarching theory of comedy which ‘explains’ comedy in all its heterogeneous diversity. We are with Andy Medhurst when he counsels us to reject the ‘lure of the big C’ and recognise the variety of intellectual paradigms that can be mobilised in any attempt to account for the complexities of comedy (2007: 10). We also heed Andrew Horton’s considered view that ‘No totalizing theory of comedy has proved successful’ (1991: 2). What we can say is that comedy has suffered from being taken both not seriously enough (in other words, not studied) and too seriously (that is, theorised about, but in ways that tend towards tedium). In the study of comedy there is something of a disjunction between those critical texts that focus on how humour works (for example, Freud’s analysis of the mechanics of the joke) and those that focus on what appears to be at stake (that is, the content or subject of the comedy). Palmer, arguing in favour of his own approach, suggests that: ‘To evoke values in the mode of humour is to evoke them in a special, unique way, a way which cannot be reduced to the serious presentation of the “same” material’ (1987: 14–15). Medhurst argues, from a slightly different standpoint, that: ‘Comedy is never just a question of content – questions of form, style, consumption, context and (often most crucial of all) performance must always be in play’ (2007: 24). The complexity created for those studying comedy comes partly from the fact that: ‘Humour is both a signifying process and a social process’ (Palmer 1987: 204). That is, it is distinct from other genres but also embedded within wider culture. We have opted for a broad cultural focus while limiting (if that is the right term) ourselves to three media. The following comments attempt to position this book in relation to what we consider valuable – if sometimes contradictory and partial – theories of humour and comedy that have been advanced previously. Though Aristotle argued that humour distinguished humankind from the beasts, Plato was fairly certain that comedy rotted thought, and his views were still current, among the educated classes, into the Renaissance and the early [ 11 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 11\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nL au g h i n g M at t e r s modern era (Morreall 1983: 85–9). If, as has been suggested, laughter is ‘the enemy of social distinctions’ (Stott 2005: 134), then, in fairly rigid, hierarchically structured societies, comedy clearly has subversive potential that needs careful policing. For Thomas Hobbes, writing in the early seventeenth century, laughter resided in a sense of superiority over others, such that we can laugh at their social inferiority. Though they emanate from a social structure long since gone, such notions of superiority, of scorn and disparagement, still carry a charge – where else does the comic potential of seeing someone slipping on a banana skin come from? Though much comedy relies on a sense of subversion, of undermining (if only briefly) treasured thoughts and beliefs, there is clearly a role for comedy in reinforcing views, values and attitudes, of utilising stereotypes and bolstering prejudices. If, as Andy Medhurst argues, ‘Above all else, comedy is an invitation to belong’ (2007: 19), it needs to be recognised that this sense of belonging is sometimes created by excluding others, which may explain why the British have their jokes about the Irish, the Americans their jokes about the Poles. Politically situated explanations for humour ignore what many have seen as the ludicrous incongruities that are part and parcel of being human. For Henri Bergson, writing in 1900, ‘the comic simply does not exist outside the pale of what is strictly human’ (2008: 10). Faced with the eccentricities and foibles of human beings, laughter is a response, ‘a sort of social gesture’: human ‘rigidity is the comic, and laughter is its corrective’ (2008: 17). Though it is hard to take Bergson seriously once he asks ‘What is there comic about a rubicund nose? And why does one laugh at a negro?’ (2008: 25), his idea that laughter can arise only from an absence of emotion, that ‘laughter is incompatible with emotion’ (2008: 68), is interesting, as is his insistence on the social function of laughter and its reliance on the presence of others, as when he asserts that ‘Our laughter is always the laughter of a group’ (2008: 11). Bergson sees humour as springing from humanity’s awareness of their helplessness in a crazy, machine-like world and his work does have considerable mileage in relation to silent, slapstick and physical comedy, as well as what Gehring (1996) terms ‘Dark Comedy’, where the world is often seen as inhospitable, antagonistic, strange (Stott 2005: 95). If sociological and philosophical explanations of humour and comedy stress the extent to which human beings are not in charge of their world, the work of Freud and his followers questioned whether we are even in control of our own minds. In essence, Freud argued for a three-dimensional view of personality in which primitive, socially unacceptable id impulses are inhibited or censored by the moralistic superego, while the ego or conscious self mediates between them. In Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious (first published in 1905), he argues that all jokes and witty remarks relate directly or indirectly to some sort of socially unacceptable behaviour which is articulated in laughter. For Freud, most comedy and certainly most jokes centre on hostility and obscenity, on [ 12 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 12\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nintroduction aggression and sex. Freud saw individuals in society as subject to various forms of necessary repression, involving us in the expenditure of psychic energy; a joke allows the feelings that are repressed to emerge into the open in a socially acceptable disguise. In this way, ‘Jokes permit a brief holiday from inhibition and logic in order for them to be re-imposed with greater effectiveness’ (Gray 1994: 29). They are ‘little emissaries of the unconscious’ (Stott, 2005: 11). Freud allows us to make an important step. Our laughter is not consciously willed; it must come from part of us inaccessible to conscious thought. However, Freud’s attempts to calibrate the psychic ‘economy’ of our response to jokes inhibits the development of this argument, and these aspects of his essay are regularly taken to task by commentators (Morreall 1983: 28–35; Palmer 1987: 35; Carey 2002). Though Freud did not set out to analyse a wide range of humour (only innocent wordplay and obscene jokes), his point about how humour accesses subconscious wishes is clearly a valuable one. His focus on release and relief, on the tension, arousal and release that accompany virtually all humour, is clearly relevant, especially when contentious topics such as sex, race, gender, religion and politics are being dealt with. Psychoanalytic theory allows us to make a distinction between ‘Oedipal (accommodation, compromise, social integration) comedy and pre-Oedipal (wish fulfilment, dreams) comedy’ (Horton 1991: 10). That distinction roughly equates to comedies interested in maintaining a link with narrative realism (affirmative comedies) and those comedies which favour the implausible and impossible (anarchistic comedies). The notion of repression – whether social, political or psychological – has become central to our contemporary culture and this may explain the impact that Mikhail Bakhtin has had on recent attempts to explain comedy. Bakhtin has been invoked heavily since the mid-1980s because his concept of the carnivalesque, developed in relation to the works of the medieval writer Rabelais, seems useful in dealing with comedic excess (see Horton 1991: 12–14; Krutnik 2003: 13–16; Stott 2005: 32–9). The reversals of hierarchy and everyday order and the emphasis on the body, on food, drink, song, dance and sexuality in carnival certainly readily overlap with some forms of comedy. Carnival, like much popular comedy, offers a safety valve (or vent) for those at the bottom of the hierarchy and is nonetheless important for that, especially in its cele­bration of the universally human experience of the body. However, as other commentators have pointed out, carnival is a period of licensed transgression against the status quo rather than being genuinely subversive of authority. Moreover, Bakhtin’s concern with sexuality is essentially with male sexuality, and his work does little to explain the abundance of mother-in-law jokes and the complete absence of father-in-law jokes. Nonetheless, Bakhtin’s concept of the carnivalesque can be seen to combine Freud’s idea of a temporary escape from the accepted order, even though, because of comedy’s essential h ­ eterogeneity, it cannot account for all forms. [ 13 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 13\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nL au g h i n g M at t e r s In different ways, Freud and Bakhtin suggest that, in the right conditions at the right time, the moment of laughter represents a willing, if temporary, suspension of normal mental processes, accepted mores, beliefs and values, whether these be moral, social or political. Given the right context, we are invited into a cognitive playground where anything goes, where we can transgress the conventional boundaries of taste, political correctness, morality, even reality itself. We acquiesce in a journey of exploration where there are few consequences since, and this is important, we are not being asked to abandon our moral values, political beliefs, deep-seated beliefs or even (dread the thought) our prejudices. We are asked to take a vacation, to imagine, to see things anew, rise above our thoughts, to stop taking everything so boringly seriously. As Rappaport points out, it was Erasmus who argued long ago in his In Praise of Folly (1509) that it is the impulsive, foolish, irresponsible thoughts and behaviours that make the practical realities of life bearable, and these are the stuff of comedy (Rappaport 2005: xiii). This cognitive and affective clash between the world as it is and as it might be depends on our perceived sense of the ludicrous and the incongruous within a specific context. When two or more comments, characters, events or objects come into unexpected juxtaposition, the results can be jarring and, in the right context, frequently funny. Arthur Koestler (1949) explored this process in his concept of ‘biosociation’, where the juxtaposition of multiple ‘independent and self-contained logical chains’ creates a release of emotional tension resulting in laughter. Jerry Palmer, who has made major contributions to the theory of comedy, especially with his Logic of the Absurd (1987), develops Koestler by positing the reciprocal relationship between plausible and implausible (absurd) explanations in gags – a kind of short circuit of logic – as the cause of laughter (1987: 70) Palmer uses a concise example from the film Dr Strangelove (1963) wherein Peter Sellers as President Merkin Muffley finds one of his generals and the Russian Ambassador struggling over a camera and is outraged: ‘Gentlemen! You can’t fight in here! This is the War Room!’ Palmer explains: ‘Both the plausibility and implausibility of this remark derive from the discourses that are fundamental to the structure of the plot. It is implausible because of the identification of “fight-war”, plausible because war needs a high degree of organisation which must be conducted in a calm atmosphere’ (1987: 190–1). The logic of the absurd is exactly what allows comic events to service simultaneously what others have called anarchistic and affirmative comedy narrative forms (1987: 143–9). The comic effect that Palmer describes is, in fact, a double undermining from the space between the two explanations; a brief acknowledgement of the chasm that we have to leap across to continue the process of ‘making sense’. This might seem frighteningly post-structuralist, but it also links back to psychoanalytical approaches because making sense, applying rules, is an [ 14 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 14\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nintroduction imposition of ‘grown-up’ thinking over the untrammelled mind of childhood, still present in the adult subject but repressed from conscious thought in the id. Comedy might sometimes be seen as ‘temporarily suspending the “rules” of adulthood and returning, albeit symbolically, to an earlier, pre-Oedipal state’ (Horton 1991: 5). The activity of the id is routinely mastered by the rational adult mind, but the nature of comedy challenges that mental hegemony because comedy ‘happens too fast for us to adjust to what is happening’ (Morreall 1983: 48). The true laugh isn’t consciously willed and one of humour’s key elements is surprise, which is why jokes have ‘punchlines’ and comedians seek to ‘knock audiences dead’ (see Morreall 1983: 48–9). The key element of surprise creates hesitancy in the conscious mind (the ego – ‘us’) during which the unconscious mind can seize upon and apprehend other meanings and generate laughter. Explaining a joke, that is laying it out for the conscious intelligence, won’t achieve anything like the same effect. Nonetheless, to do so occasionally might be instructive. Here we return to one example briefly mentioned by Palmer (1987: 53–4) and discuss it in the manner that Horton (1991: 6–7) unpacks a Woody Allen joke, though, purposely, a little less neatly. The line is a short barb in the film Horse Feathers (1932) through which Groucho Marx indicates his irritation with a confederate: ‘I’d horsewhip you if I had a horse.’ Close analysis of this line puts it artificially into slow motion, even though the text in which it appears purposely gives us no time to do this. It is in fact a mere fragment, but how does it work as humour? Superficially, the line may be seen as two things: an expression of anger, and a knowing satire of a cliché of the angered aristocrat. These could be further complicated by the persona of the speaker and recipient (brothers playing father and son) and the situation of the delivery, but we will keep things simple for now (see Chapter 2). Our social conditioning tells us anger must be restrained; the tense used (‘I would’) already indicates the speaker has thought better of it, but it is the exposure of the reasoning behind the caveat (‘if I had a horse’) that creates the humour. The particular excuse we read off may be one of a non-exclusive range; the first is that the threat is immediately withdrawn because Groucho is too pusillanimous to actually offer any physical violence, thus the line diminishes his masculinity. A second reason might be that he thinks (very literally) that a horse and all the paraphernalia associated with it would be the only way to acquire the necessary equipment (a horsewhip) to carry out the threat, making this expression of anger impossible to him because it is dependent on wealth and class he doesn’t have, another self-inflicted humiliation; a third excuse may be that the only thing holding him back is indeed the absence of a horse in the vicinity (rather than a horsewhip) with which he could whip the subject of his remark, which leads to either the impossible image of a man wielding a gramniverous quadruped or the implication that Groucho doesn’t actually know what a horse or a horsewhipping is and that his use of language has exceeded his knowledge. [ 15 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 15\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nL au g h i n g M at t e r s This may be a tortuous exposition of a single line and, of course, given the quick succession of gags, puns and one-liners that usually populate a comedy film (or television or radio programme) the chance to isolate one line is a luxury we don’t get while viewing or listening. But, as Horton and Palmer indicate, given the correct climate or context (this is Groucho speaking in a Marx Brothers movie), we only need to perceive a pair of plausible and implausible readings to make the line effectively humorous. We’ve tried to indicate there is a wider range of possibilities open to us, whichever combination we might have used during viewing, without limiting the reading to a single meaning or pair of opposed meanings. We hope to have shown that this is also a line that may engage us in thinking about versions of social restraint, masculinity, class and the relationship between language and logic. In short, analysing one piece of verbal humour (reduced and simplified almost to a piece of text) has immediately plugged us in to a number of crucial issues. Such detailed analysis will clearly not be possible throughout. What we need to do now is to explain how the book will proceed.\n\nThe structure of this book The focus, parameters and methodological approach of the book have been outlined above in this Introduction. We have argued that, though no single theory can possibly begin to explain the diversity and heterogeneity of comedy, there are some ideas and concepts that are particularly useful as we begin to explore comedy in our chosen media forms. A basic glossary of terminology for dealing with comedy concludes the Introduction. The chapters that follow indicate the history and development of comedy in film, radio and television, consider the cultural functions of comedy and undertake close textual analyses of some comedy texts with a view to encouraging further work. We have split our ten chapters between two parts, and outline below the specific content and structure of these parts. In Part I, we are concerned to look at how comedy works. In order to do this we turn our attention to the nature of comedy as manifested in specific media forms, from the exploitation of the non-visual in radio to the familiar, domesticated settings suited to television’s small screen; from the silent cinema screen to the possibilities of CGI. We examine the historical, industrial and cultural contexts in which British and American comedy in film, radio and television developed (in that order). The chapters focus on certain genres rather than all sub-genres of comedy in these media and look at particular examples, evaluating specific criticism and a range of critical approaches to these forms. Chapters 1 to 3 deal specifically with the development of comedy in film. The first chapter discusses silent comedy, including the classical comedian comedies of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton. The second [ 16 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 16\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nintroduction chapter focuses comedy in the early sound period and the very different approaches to sound film of the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy. The third chapter steps aside from these comedian comedies to follow the parallel 1930s development of the sound romantic comedy film. Across these three chapters considerations of genre, sub-genre and the dominant forms of comedy (slapstick, verbal humour) are highlighted with particular reference to the interaction between anarchistic and affirmative modes of comedy. Chapters 4 and 5 on radio and television address comedy in broadcast media. We focus on the industrial context and practices that flow from and reflect different national attitudes to these media. Building on previous criticism of broadcast comedy, these chapters highlight the preferred comedic forms and formats of these media. In the distinctively different products from either side of the Atlantic across the two media there are, however, considerable continuities, such as the use of sketch comedy and its unique-to-broadcasting spin-off specialist form, the sitcom. Having established some of the basic characteristics of comedy in these media as they developed over time, in Chapter 6 we discusses the disrespect with which comedy treats generic boundaries, looking in particular at comedy westerns, musical comedies and so-called mockumentaries. As the comic impetus finds its targets within the forms that surround and compete with it, the chapter discusses what this urge towards hybridising and self-reflexivity demands of its makers and audiences, and what it illustrates about the particularities of comedy. Chapter 7 examines a special case in comedic form by taking a closer look at animation and the specific comedic modes developed by the early pioneers of animated comedy and sustained in the present by the computer-generated comedy blockbusters of recent years. Though not restricted to comedy, the history of animation on film and television shows it largely dominated by comedic forms, evolving in particularly surreal and self-reflexive ways. All these chapters stress the importance of recognising formal, institutional and technological determinants that help shape comedy and raise issues about the transitory nature of much comedy, relating these to an understanding of the cultural dynamics of comedy’s reception and consumption. In Part II, the focus is on what comedy does, and we engage in more detail with the social functions of comedy and raise questions about the construction, transmission and contestation of cultural values by engaging with a few of Sedgwick’s ‘inconceivably coarse axes of categorization … inscribed in current critical and political thought: gender, race, class, … [and] sexual orientation’ (1990: 22), though not in that order. In particular we look in more detail at the ways in which comedy texts engage in key social and cultural debates and form part of a culture’s ongoing negotiation with fundamental issues in human life. Through a series of overlapping histories of comedy in film and/ or television and radio we note the effects of comedy’s engagement with these [ 17 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 17\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nL au g h i n g M at t e r s issues and the controversies it often causes. In particular we discuss ways in which issues of class and gender dictate the reputation of particular comedy texts and how comedy highlights issues of gender and race in ways that may be seen as liberating or divisive. Chapter 8 deals with gender, sexuality and comedy, ranging from the depictions of femininity and masculinity in romantic comedy film to the representations offered of gay and lesbian characters across our chosen media. The chapter also highlights the opportunities comedy texts provide for queer readings of gender and sexuality simply by reason of their undermining the rigid categories of patriarchal discourse. Chapter 9 considers taste as a criterion for evaluating comedy and the different standards invoked in relation to cultural capital, class, gender and postmodern irony. Studies of low British comedy and American gross-out comedy underpin work on specific examples which directly challenge standards of taste and cultural taboos. Chapter 10 investigates race and ethnicity as issues for comedy, and evaluates various examples of screen and radio comedy which have picked their way through these cultural minefields. The chapter focuses on changes in television representations of race in Britain and on the representation of African-Americans in film and television, and explores why comedy is often the preferred form for raising these issues and how easily humour around race and ethnicity takes on an ambivalence that might be troubling as well as effective in producing laughter. The book ends with a short conclusion that briefly considers the likely future of comedy, the impact on it of new technologies, where the frontiers of transgressive taste may lie, public nostalgia and affection for past comedy and the appetite for new forms of comedy. After that, we’ll all need a lie down. The Appendix is not for everyone.\n\nTerminology The following brief definitions are intended as a useful summary without providing a full justification or history of the terms. Steve Neale and Frank Krutnik’s in-depth discussion in Popular Film and Television Comedy (1990: 1–82) has been a major source for the following. Comedy: At its most basic a genre (in literature, theatre, film, radio or ­ television) in which the narrative has a happy ending. As such laughter is not necessarily essential to a comedy. In film, television and radio the genre of comedy is usually assumed to entertain audiences by generating laughter. It doesn’t, therefore, necessarily depend on narrative. Because the genre of ‘comedy’ is otherwise too broad to be critically useful, comedy is prone to hybridisation (e.g. comedy-drama, comedy-western, situation-comedy, comedy quiz). [ 18 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 18\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nintroduction Structure of comedy narrative: The sequence is usually Exposition, Com­­­ plication, Resolution (Happy Ending); possibly extended with Further Complication before Final Resolution (Happy Ending). Other than the presence of the happy ending there is really nothing to mark this structure as comic. Comic: Causing (or meaning to cause) laughter. Comic motivation: Developments in comedy narrative tend to be less rigorously motivated than in other genres. Comedy conventions are flexible, and often laughter-generating comic devices work against coherent narrative development and verisimilitude. Comic devices can be subdivided as follows: Gag: A joke or comic utterance (for Neale and Krutnik 1990: 51–2 the only type of gag is the visual gag defined below). Visual gag: From a pratfall to a visual pun. Articulated or developed visual gag: A sequence of visual gags. Comic event: Any of the above which is comic only by virtue of its ­narrative context. Comic types: These might be sorted into one of the following: the joketeller, the comedian (a particular comic persona), the stereotype, the fully rounded comic character. Comic modes: Parody: A mode of comedy that targets the conventions of a pre-existing aesthetic form. This is not the same as a simple comedy hybrid because in a parody comedy dominates the partner genre. Satire: A mode of comedy that mocks or attacks social conventions. Slapstick: A physical mode of comedy that predominated in the silent period but is still with us in contemporary visual comedy (see Chapter 1). Spoof: A full-length parody (see Chapter 6).\n\nFollowing up\n\n☞\n\nIn each of the following chapters there will be several sections in this format and under this heading which will offer some suggestions for further exploration of the areas and issues discussed. No doubt you can think of other approaches that would be just as good, or better, to help you to get to grips with what really interests you about comedy. In this case just use the appearance of the ‘Following up’ sections as a reminder to do so.

The audience was in hysterics throughout’ (Montgomery 1968: 268). Half a century later, it is difficult to imagine a contemporary audience having the same reaction. Although the work of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and other silent film comedians has been made more accessible through DVD, for most people silent comedies have become unfashionable and incomprehensible artefacts from a distant and strange era, marked above all by the absence of audible spoken language which renders their aesthetic unacceptably ‘difficult’. We might experience amused admiration of the clever antics on display, appreciate the witty intelligence of some of the comic material, but this is likely to be mixed with a degree of bemusement about exaggerated acting styles, discomfort about levels of physical abuse and annoyance at the ethnic and gender stereotypes on display. While revered as ‘comedy greats’ whose historical influence and significance is readily acknowledged, even the films of Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd are more likely to be admired for their wit and visual audacity than for any ability to induce hysterical belly-laughs. The work of lesser-known talents such as Harry Langdon, Larry Semon, Mabel Normand and Ford Sterling seems even more remote from our contemporary comic sensibilities. Yet a consideration of silent film comedy raises important questions about the relationship between comedy and the cultural context in which it is produced, and about changing audience tastes and perceptions of what passes as funny. Any attempt to understand silent film comedy fully is constrained by a number of factors. In spite of the greater accessibility of material on DVD, an enormous number of films have gone missing. As a result most critical writing about silent film comedy is constructed around those films and comedians that have survived. Archival research is helping us to ‘recover’ something of the historical and cultural context in which silent film comedy flourished, but much more needs to be done if we are to understand fully the modes, diversity and appeal of silent comedy for disparate cinema audiences. Moreover, [ 23 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 23\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\ncomedy forms a tendency to regard generic systems as synchronic and static rather than diachronic, subject to change and evolution, means that we often judge silent cinema through inappropriate criteria, often ‘reading back’ from contemporary notions of the comic in ways that do little justice to comedy forms, aesthetics and sensibilities that differ radically from our own, but which were popular in their own time. Add to this the alien, truncated experience of watching films with no spoken dialogue (often on a small screen), our unfamiliarity with having to read sometimes quite lengthy title cards and the fact that we are less adept at lip-reading than silent cinema audiences were, and it is easy to understand why even the greatest films from the silent comedy era can seem remote from what contemporary audiences expect from film comedy. The history and evolution of silent film comedy from the mid-1890s to the coming of commercially viable synchronised sound cinema in the late 1920s mirrors changes within cinema itself during that period, changes which were evident not just in film production and aesthetics but in audience reception and consumption of films. From being a novelty whose lasting impact was still a matter of speculation, to becoming a medium of industrialised mass consumption, silent comedy no less than silent cinema as a whole underwent rapid transformation. This process was far from ordered and coherent, as competing companies attempted to discover comedians and comic modes that generated box-office success. However, it is possible to outline certain broad trends in the development of silent film comedy, trends that reflect changes in the development of the film industry and its relationship with audience taste and expectations, as well as broader historical and cultural changes. While recognising the diversity that characterised developments in silent film comedy, Peter Krämer (1988: 100–1) identifies six distinct phases in the development of American silent film comedy: 1 early ‘trick’ comedies that played with technical possibilities such as stop-motion and superimposition, but which were obsolete by 1908 2 ‘slapstick’ comedies and parodies of emerging contemporary cinematic genres produced by companies such as Keystone from 1912 onwards 3 social and situation comedies starring featured players such as John Bunny and Sidney Drew which, from 1912 onwards privileged characterisation rather than frenetic comic action 4 slapstick ‘comedian comedies’ such as Chaplin’s early films at Keystone in 1914 and at Essanay in 1915 which emphasised the character and performance of the star, but still involved a high degree of physical action and knockabout 5 so-called classical ‘comedian comedies’ such as those starring Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Chaplin’s later films which paid much greater attention to integrating comic performance and persona into more structured dramatic patterns [ 24 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 24\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nsilent film comedy 6 more sophisticated social comedies of the late 1910s and early 1920s which dispensed with dominant comic personas in favour of intricate narrative construction, depth of characterisation and realistic situations and behaviour.\n\nEarly cinema and early film comedy Like contemporary audiences at an IMAX screening, the audiences who flocked to see the Lumière brothers’ Cinematograph in 1895 and similar shows went to experience novelty. They enjoyed the process of sitting together in a darkened space, caring little, certainly before they decided to go, about what types of films were being screened. What they saw at these and other early exhibitions of moving pictures in the 1890s and early 1900s were short actuality films, often shot in recognisable locations, military scenes, close-up ‘facial’ films and ‘trick’ films that exploited the mechanics of filmed projection, filmed stage acts featuring conjurors, dancers and gymnasts, and comedies, lots of comedies. The early comedy shorts that have survived from this period, such as the Lumière brothers’ own L’Arroseur Arrosé (aka The Gardener and the Bad Boy, 1895) appear at one level simple and unsophisticated. The Lumière catalogue described this ‘domestic scene comedy’ as ‘showing a lawn with a gardener using a hose to sprinkle it. A bad boy steps on the hose, causing the water to squirt into the gardener’s face. He drops the hose, runs after the boy, and gives him a sound thrashing.’ However, as Charles Musser suggests, this and other early silent comedy films signal many of the formal, thematic and ideological issues that remain central to an understanding of contemporary film comedy (Musser 1994: 143). There is, arguably, a basic narrative, predicated on the relationship between cause and effect. This narrative is combined with and contains moments of physical excess and abuse, as the water squirts into the gardener’s face. We, the audience, are to some extent implicated in the boy’s determined act of transgression, unable and unwilling to warn the gardener of the boy’s actions, but sharing in the process of retribution as the boy is chased and punished. The slapstick world of physical excess challenges, but is ultimately contained within, a wider moral world, as order and stability appear to be restored. L’Arroseur Arrosé inspired a genre that remained popular between 1896 and 1905; short, single-shot, films based around a single gag often featuring a ‘bad boy’ who is usually punished for his actions (Gunning 1995: 89). More importantly, L’Arroseur Arrosé is amenable to a range of social, political and psychoanalytical interpretive readings. It is doubtful whether contemporary audiences entered into ruminations about the meaning of these early comedies, though they appeared to enjoy the moments of physical excess that were central to the films, moments that were imitated by different film-makers and different companies operating in different countries, often tailored to local audiences. The basic gag in [ 25 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 25\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\ncomedy forms L’Arroseur Arrosé was copied by the British pioneer Birt Acres in his comedy A Surrey Garden (1896) and clearly influenced a series of early British comedy shorts made by James Williamson, including Two Naughty Boys Teasing the Cobbler (1898). The basic gag involving a fight with white flour and black soot in R.W. Paul’s early British comedy The Miller and the Sweep (1897) is reused in his Quarrelsome Neighbours (1897). Biograph’s The Prodigal’s Return (1896), described as a ‘laughing picture’ in which a well-off gentleman returns ‘to his home in a jolly condition and reveals his trouble when he attempts to find his way into bed’ (Musser 1994: 157), sounds remarkably similar to R.W. Paul’s Two AM; Or, The Husband’s Return (1896) in which a drunk comes home and, despite his best efforts, inadvertently wakes his wife. At a time when ‘cinema’, as we understand the term, did not exist, short films were exhibited at fairgrounds, travelling shows and other, often itinerant, sites that were already catering for a public eager for novelty and variety. The curiosity value of film was not confined to working-class audiences in the late 1890s, as suitable films such as travel shorts and news footage (both real and fabricated) were shown at respectable American venues such as Keith’s Bijou, the Brooklyn Institute and their European equivalents (Musser 1994: 183–9). However, for poor, working-class and immigrant audiences across Europe and the United States, films needed to make an immediate and intelligible impact. Comedy films, particularly those with slapstick and visual gags centred on robust physicality, met this need. Originally referring to a light paddle made of two thin pieces of wood that made a loud noise when used to strike another comic or clown in pantomime, circus and other forms of ‘low’ comedy, slapstick became an important part of early silent comedy films. American slapstick comedy, reliant on fast and furious physical activity, became associated with Mack Sennett’s Keystone Company from 1912 on­­­­wards. Before that American audiences were supplied with imports and copies of European comedies, especially from Italy and France, where comedians such as Ferdinand Guillame and André Deed made comedies that exploited the ability of film to effect sudden transformations in time and space, challenging the accepted boundaries and physical logic of the material world. Known in France as Boireau, in Italy as Cretinni and for American audiences as Foolshead, Andre Deed and other comedians exploited the ability that silent film had to play easily to a range of international audiences. Many of these comedies relied on the seemingly universal appeal of film’s special effects, on simple plots involving mistaken identities or simply on the chase. Perhaps the most important and certainly the most influential of these early European silent comedians was the Frenchman Max Linder (1883–1925), who began making films for Pathé in 1906. Though there are elements of physical slapstick in his films, Linder’s films mark the development of that strand of early film comedies that rely on character and situation as much as physical excess. Initially unbilled, Linder’s character Max was acknowledged from 1909 onwards in films such [ 26 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 26\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nsilent film comedy as Max Takes a Bath, Max Is Jealous and Max’s Mother-in-Law. The importance of character and costume to Linder’s success proved hugely influential when American film comedy began to challenge the dominance of European companies and comedians in the period just prior to the outbreak of the First World War. Max Linder’s own move to America was more important as an indication of the growing power of Hollywood than for any success enjoyed by the films he made in America.\n\nThe emergence of American film comedy from 1912: Mack Sennett and Keystone Comedy was an increasingly prominent element of film production across Europe prior to the outbreak of the First World War. In Britain, for example, the Ec-Ko Film Company was formed in 1912 and produced one slapstick comedy short a week. Billy Merson’s Homeland Film Syndicate also produced a string of short comedies featuring British music hall talent. However, although the war in Europe was to cause immense damage to European film production capacity, the emergence of an increasingly powerful American film industry was evident even prior to 1914. A key figure in the development of this growth and in American film comedy was the Canadian-born Mack Sennett (1880–1960). Like the more recent ‘dot com’ boom of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, from 1908 onwards a rash of new film companies started up and expanded to meet unprecedented audience demand for the new technology, increasingly being seen in purpose-built cinemas which were growing in number, size and luxuriousness. Sennett founded the Keystone Company in the summer of 1912, a subsidiary of the already successful New York Motion Picture Company owned by Adam Kessel and Charles O. Baumann. Between 1912 and 1932, Sennett, through various companies, produced over eleven hundred films, including the short silent comedies that characterised studio output in the late 1910s and early 1920s, an output that ‘singularly influenced the direction and dimension of motion picture humour for over two decades’ (Lahue 1971: 43). In popular imagination Keystone remains best known for its Keystone Kops, frantic car chases and pie-throwing slapstick. In fact the contribution made by Sennett and the Keystone Company to the development of silent film comedy is more extensive and significant. In the first place, despite numerous experiments with early film sound, Sennett proved that a certain type of film comedy worked within the constraints and limit points of silent cinema, most notably the absence of audible dialogue, and worked in ways that appealed to contemporary cinema audiences. Influenced both by French film fantasy and by a more raucous American burlesque tradition, Sennett managed to combine the two in short two-reel comedy films (each reel lasting approximately ten minutes) that engaged with aspects of the lived experiences of [ 27 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 27\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\ncomedy forms emerging social and cultural modernity. Keystone’s early ethnic comedies of 1912 and 1913 acknowledged the presence of Jewish and immigrant audiences, still struggling with English as a language, but having to deal with the exigencies of crowded urban and domestic life. Acknowledging the deprivations that audiences lived with, Keystone comedies celebrated the brutish vulgarities and injustices that were central to immigrant and urban working-class experience, and offered some form of carnivalesque retribution through their reiterative images of incompetent authority. At the same time Sennett was not slow in exploiting the commercial potential of female display through the increasing use of what officially became the Sennett ‘Bathing Beauties’ from 1917, even though the girls served little purpose as comic devices. In the same way, Keystone’s ‘Kid Komedies’ series from 1913 onwards made unashamed use of the ‘cute’ appeal of child stars such as Paul Jacobs, whilst perpetuating the animosities between adults and malicious youngsters established with the ‘bad boy’ genre a decade earlier. In his highly unreliable memoirs, Sennett claimed that Keystone ‘was a university of nonsense’ but there is little doubting the success that the studio enjoyed (Sennett 1954: 140). Sennett’s significance also lay in the number of screen comedians who worked for him. As one commentator noted, looking at the cast lists of early Keystone comedies, ‘it seems that virtually everyone who was anyone in the days of the silent film comedy had worked for Mack Sennett at one time or another’ (Lahue 1971: 103). While most of these, such as Slim Summerville, Bobby Vernon, Charles Avery, along with numerous female comedians such as Louise Fazenda and Polly Moran, have been forgotten, others, including Mabel Normand, Roscoe Arbuckle, Ben Turpin, Edgar Kennedy and Charlie Chaplin, enjoyed more or less illustrious comedy careers with both Sennett and other companies. For many, notably Chaplin, Sennett’s comedy formula, with its emphasis on pace, physical slapstick, reiterative visual gags and the inevitable climactic chaotic chase, proved too restrictive and ‘Sennett invariably lost his people as they began to find themselves’ (Kerr 1975: 70). Driven in part by his concern to resist the increasingly higher salaries demanded by players who could be readily identified by audiences, Sennett’s ensemblebased comedy vehicles resisted the development of individual identification and talent, so that the byword amongst aspiring screen comedians became ‘start with Sennett – get rich somewhere else’ (Louvish 2003: 100). Keystone’s comic world was one of impossible physicalities, of fantastic biologies, where people are hit on the head with bricks and survive, are thrown down flights of stairs before scampering away, where tying a shoelace often involved being kicked on the backside, where, amongst others, Chaplin and Marie Dressler conduct their courtship by throwing bricks at each other. The sheer preponderance of successive visual gags has sometimes been seen as a weakness in Sennett’s films, attracting criticism that they were ‘long on gags and short on logic and story line’ (Lahue 1971: 267). Arguably, such criticism [ 28 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 28\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nsilent film comedy not only misunderstands the nature of much silent film comedy but fails to account for the enduring popularity of slapstick well into the 1920s and beyond. While narrative cinema was developing in genres such as melodrama and the western, slapstick comedy gags were intended, as Donald Crafton argues, ‘as a calculated rupture’ (1995: 107), as moments of excess that disrupted and forestalled narrative. Though the ideological function that gags were able to undertake was increasingly threatened by film industry economics, manifest in the tendency towards increased narrative integration, it is possible to understand this distinctive phase of silent film comedy only by recognising narrative and slapstick as ‘two distinct modes of cinema … each driven by particular and historical contexts’ (King 2002: 24). Short comedies, in particular, were designed to be gag-driven and it was enough to establish a setting and situation in which the gags were to predominate. Though Sennett and Keystone excelled at such films and numerous other studios produced slapstick shorts, the demand for more ‘culturally respectable’ product was evident as early as 1912. John Bunny (1863–1915) is now the forgotten man of American silent film comedy, despite enjoying huge global success and earning a salary that matched US President Woodrow Wilson’s (Gehring 1997: 37). Between 1910 and 1915 Bunny featured in over two hundred comedy shorts, most of which have not survived. A capable stage actor who also starred in a British three-part version of Pickwick Papers (1913), Bunny’s Vitagraph domestic comedies, in which he was invariably at odds with a puritanical and domineering wife (often played by the diminutive Flora Finch), gave screen comedy a critical respectability, not least through their rejection of slapstick and physical violence as central comic mechanisms. Instead, Bunny relied on an understated acting style which expressed his frustration at his inability to pursue masculine activities that are frowned upon by his wife. In A Cure for Pokeritus (1912), for example, his love for gambling is frustrated by his wife’s machinations that force him into a resigned form of domestic incarceration. At a time when women’s suffrage and emancipation were major political issues, Bunny’s comedies clearly keyed in to social anxieties centred on gender roles in ways that transcended some of the more basic comic appeal of slapstick. In much the same way, the popular Vitagraph films starring Mr and Mrs Sidney Drew were proof that there was a market for domestic film comedy in the early 1910s which relied on carefully performed, nuanced explorations of the comic potential inherent in ‘respectable’ married life. Like Bunny, Sidney Drew came from a ‘legitimate’ theatre background and his appearance in film comedy undoubtedly made silent film comedy more acceptable to middle-class audiences.\n\n[ 29 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 29\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\ncomedy forms\n\nFollowing up: early silent comedies\n\n☞\n\nA lot of silent film comedies are now available on YouTube, though the viewing quality is often poor compared to how contemporary film audiences would have experienced them, and they may well be heavily edited or otherwise ‘corrupted’. However, bearing this in mind, take a look at an example of an early comedy such as L’Arroseur Arrosé or The Miller and the Sweep, compare these with one of Sennett’s Keystone Kops short films and consider the differences between them. Despite these differences, in what sense do the films share a reliance on visual gags and slapstick?\n\n☞\n\nDo you agree with Musser that these early films signal many of the formal, thematic and ideological issues central to contemporary comedy, or is King right when he asserts that slapstick and narrative in early films represent ‘two distinct modes of cinema’?\n\n☞\n\nWhat are the limitations of slapstick and physical violence as comic mechanisms? By referring to specific examples, analyse the extent to which slapstick remains an element in contemporary film comedy.\n\nThe rise of the slapstick ‘comedian comedies’: Charlie Chaplin Though the slapstick comedies produced by Keystone and others were criticised at the time and subsequently for what was perceived as their ‘crude vulgarity’, slapstick continued to be an important comic mode throughout the 1920s. However, improvements in technology resulted in better film stock and lengthier films, and the commercial drive to appeal to more affluent middleclass audiences, together with the development of narrative feature films in other genres, meant that accommodations needed to be made. Although slapstick comedy shorts continued to be popular with audiences as part of ‘an evening’s entertainment’ (Koszarski 1994) along with newsreels, series, cartoons and a feature film, it became increasingly clear that, to avoid being marginalised commercially, film comedy would have to produce longer-length films. As a consequence, the disruptive, excessive moments provided by visual gags were increasingly required to relate in some manner to narrative plausibility. This inherent aesthetic and ideological tension between ‘crude’, logically incoherent slapstick gags and ‘respectable’, coherent and organised narrative found a formal solution in the rise of ‘comedian comedies’ that placed greater emphasis on performance through the presence of a star comedian. Prior to 1920 this development of comic personae took place within the short comedy film form rather than in feature films. In Britain the most significant ‘comedian comedies’ starred Fred Evans in the ‘Pimple’ series of films produced between 1912 and 1918. Though Evans [ 30 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 30\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nsilent film comedy never created an entirely consistent costume for Pimple, the film titles, such as Pimple’s New Job (1913), Pimple Has One (1915) and Pimple’s Uncle (1915) clearly point to the central role played by the main comic character. Like Sennett’s output, many of the Pimple films created comic effect through their parodies of contemporary film dramas and melodramas, such as Pimple’s Charge of the Light Brigade (1914). Though their knockabout humour and emphasis on visual gags bear similarities with developments in American silent comedy of the same period, in many respects the Pimple films anticipated the absurdist tradition in British comedy evident later in the Goons and Monty Python. In America the central figure in the development of slapstick ‘comedian comedies’ was the British-born Charlie Chaplin (1889–1977). Though not usually regarded as an innovator, Sennett had produced a feature-length comedy, Tillie’s Punctured Romance, as early as 1914. Starring Marie Dressler in the title role and featuring Chaplin and Mabel Normand, the film was marketed as ‘The Impossible Attained – A SIX REEL COMEDY’. A contemporary reviewer for the Motion Picture News saw the film as a ‘masterpiece of the slapstick art’ and as ‘six thousand feet of undiluted joy’ (Mitchell 1997: 259–60). Though the film has a clear narrative trajectory, much of the puncturing comes from successive visual gags performed by Chaplin, playing a decidedly unsavoury character cynically seeking a share of the millions that Tillie is about to inherit. Typical of the slapstick gags in the film are those that take place in the restaurant where Tillie, abandoned by Charlie, has taken a job as a waitress. When Charlie and Mabel, his altogether more attractive girlfriend, arrive in the restaurant for a meal, he has his chair pulled from beneath him and gets his ear pulled and face slapped as he flirts with an attractive waitress, before having a tray of food tipped all over him when confronted by the hapless Tillie. As he makes his exit amidst the ensuing bedlam, Charlie treads on the prostrate Tillie, who has fainted away at the shock of seeing him. A departing step on the stomach of a fallen adversary became one of the small defining trademarks of the tramp persona in Chaplin’s two-reel comedies, a small gesture of triumph in a world where such triumphs are limited. Some comic meanderings and pratfalls on a park bench under the suspicious eye of a Keystone policeman occur before a return to the narrative announces the apparent death of Tillie’s millionaire uncle, a cue for the cad to return to the restaurant where, slipping and sliding on the floor, he declares his ‘love’ for Tillie. Married and living in the palatial home, Tillie catches Charlie kissing Mabel and a frantic chase involving pie-throwing, gunshots and the incompetent Keystone Kops follows, as slapstick both ruptures and is clearly privileged over the plot. Interestingly, the film closes on a display of female solidarity as both Tillie and Mabel, friends united, reject the villainous ‘city slicker’ Charlie. The thirty-four other pictures that Chaplin made for Keystone were all shorts. In spite of the success of Tillie’s Punctured Romance, Sennett failed to capitalise on the success of feature-length comedy film and, indeed, on [ 31 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 31\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\ncomedy forms Chaplin, who left Keystone for Essanay in 1915. Though his appearance in the film, dressed in over-sized boots and ill-fitting trousers that presaged the famous ‘Tramp’ costume, contributed enormously to Chaplin’s rising fame and earning potential, neither he nor the studios he worked for returned to feature-length comedies until the 1920s. With the exception of some extendedlength Mr and Mrs Sidney Drew comedies for Vitagraph, some adaptations of popular stage successes and feature-length character comedies starring Douglas Fairbanks, such as Wild and Woolly (1917) and When the Clouds Roll By (1920), star comedians developed their screen personas through comedy film shorts that retained a strong element of knockabout comic violence and visual gags. The development of ‘comedian comedy’ was reliant on the construction of a consistent comic persona that was present in film after film (Riblet 1995). Though constrained by the short, two- and three-reel format, Chaplin was able to develop a screen persona that emerged more fully in his films for Essanay, including The Tramp (1915). Though he first appeared in a tramp costume in his second film for Keystone, Kid Auto Races (1914), he had previously appeared with ‘a tall silk hat, a monocle and a ‘“way-down-East” droopy mustache’ (Sennett 1954: 153) in Making a Living (1914), as the similarly welldressed Lord Helpus in Cruel, Cruel Love (1914), in smart ‘civvy’ clothes in Tango Tangles (1914) and dressed as a woman in A Busy Day, in The Masquerader (both 1914) and in Essanay’s A Woman (1915). In Essanay’s His New Job (1915), Chaplin gets through several costume changes in a film studio, one of several reflexive films that have the emergent real-life film star playing someone struggling to find a place within the film business. This trajectory towards the development of a costume and screen persona that was appealing, memorable and that resonated with the times was not, as Chaplin often implied, natural, consistent or inevitable (Chaplin 1966: 145). As we have seen, Chaplin’s character in Tillie’s Punctured Romance, a cynical, misogynistic city slicker, was a deeply unsympathetic one, leading to rejection at the conclusion of the film. Chaplin’s tramp costume accommodated the crude slapstick vulgarity that remained an element in his films even as late as City Lights (1931) (Paul 1991), but transformed him into a much more sympathetic character, both part of, and set apart from, mainstream society. In this he perhaps was able to represent the condition of millions of people, not just in America, but wherever the conditions of modernity were emerging. The shift from rural to urban existence and the alienating experience of working in factories and offices, the experience of poverty in the middle of apparent prosperity driven by powerful, uncaring, emergent corporations, the increase in the pace of life epitomised by developments in transportation and the media, the social and cultural shifts encapsulated by the notion of ‘The Jazz Age’, inform much of Chaplin’s comedy. However, this development of what is sometimes referred to as an ‘Everyman’ figure was barely perceptible in Chaplin’s films for Keystone; [ 32 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 32\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nsilent film comedy as Sennett recalled, ‘I did not see ... the subtleties and the pathos of the small, hard-pressed man in a dilemma’ (Sennett 1954: 156). This hesitant development of a consistent screen persona was reliant on Chaplin’s growing, if still tentative, ability to motivate and justify knockabout physical comedy within the framework of a film’s storyline, so that his comic gestures rooted in the slapstick tradition began to ‘conform to an emotional reality’ (Kerr 1975: 74). This is evident in Essanay’s The Bank (1915), in which Chaplin plays a janitor who foils a bank robbery, but still fails to get the girl. Chaplin starts the film in tramp costume, but spends most of the film in his janitor’s oversized coat that he keeps in the bank vaults. As with so many of Chaplin’s comedies, not least Work (1915), one of his best films for Essanay which he wrote and directed, the comedy is rooted in the world of work, or at least the attempt to look for and sustain employment. Work, along with food, occupies a central place in his comedies, both of them rendered scarce and not to be taken for granted in a society riven by social injustice and inequality (Mellen 2006). In The Bank significant elements of knockabout physical comedy remain unmotivated, notably the rivalry with Charlie’s fellow janitor. The blows to the head, swipes with a wet mop and kicks in the rear that Charlie delivers show little class solidarity or sympathy with a fellow worker who has done nothing to antagonise Charlie. True, the respectably attired middle-class bank executives are also on the receiving end of Charlie’s slapstick violence, but it is not until the attempted robbery that the slapstick takes on understandable and justified motivation, as Charlie uses his violent skills to good effect. The Bank is important in revealing an element of pathos that was to become increasingly important in Chaplin comedies. Here, it centres on Charlie’s mistaken belief that Edna, the bank typist (Edna Purviance), has bought him a tie as a birthday present, when it is actually intended for Charles, the middle-class, respectably attired bank cashier. The subsequent discovery of his mistake leads to what became trademark scenes of Chaplin pathos, as he fails to win the girl despite the heroics he has displayed and, in the process, comments on the class chasm that separates ‘democratic’ Americans. The inconsistent, tentative progress towards both a consistent screen persona and the growing integration of slapstick comedy within a narrative framework is equally evident in the A Woman, produced by Essanay in July 1915 between The Tramp and The Bank. Dressed in the tramp costume, Charlie betrays a succession of mendacious and often malicious behaviours, using his cane as a dangerous weapon to rip women’s skirts, knock hats off, trip people up, before leading the philandering, flirtatious father figure to the edge of a lake, where he promptly pushes both him and an interfering policeman into the water. Charlie and his victim meet up again back at the family home and old animosities are resumed. Following a lengthy knockabout sequence involving protruding hat-pins, squirting soda-siphons and slaps to several heads, Charlie [ 33 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 33\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\ncomedy forms loses his trousers and attempts to leave the house, much to the disgust of a passing Purity League crowd. In what looks as if it might be a useful plot strategem to make good his exit, Charlie dresses up as a woman. However, any intended plot motivation gets lost as the remaining ten minutes of the film are devoted to Chaplin hamming it in drag. The daughter (Edna Purviance) colludes in this, lending him a pair of her shoes and even persuading Chaplin to shave off his moustache, an unusual rupture of what became the Chaplin persona, a moment privileged in a series of close ups. The complex politics of gendered identity were given considerable attention in silent film comedy, with comedians as diverse as Chaplin, Harry Langdon, Buster Keaton and Stan Laurel all continuing a music hall tradition of cross-dressing, a tradition that has continued via Some Like it Hot (1960) into contemporary comedies such as Mrs Doubtfire (1993) and Big Momma’s House (2000) (see Chapter 8). Even rotund Oliver Hardy dressed like a young girl and posed in a bathing suit in a parody of Sennett’s Bathing Beauties. The mutabilities of gender identity and challenges to concepts of masculine authority became pronounced in the 1920s, not least in the work of Laurel and Hardy, whose films ‘present a series of experiments with different identities and roles, which are assumed by putting on and taking off the dress appropriate for each masquerade’ (Sanders 1995: 2). Although Chaplin was less prone to abandon the tramp costume as his success grew, many of his films interrogate relations between the genders, though increasingly through the pathos that finds full expression in City Lights (1931). Chaplin’s silent comedies were concerned with social issues and subtle class divisions that impact on his characters. More than love, romance and the possibilities of domestic bliss, his comedies foreground the importance of employment and economic survival in what is often portrayed as an affluent yet uncaring society. As Joan Mellen observes, ‘social inequality is the premise of all the tramp films, with the tramp on the wrong side of the class divide’ (2006: 10). These central themes are increasingly evident in the comedies produced for Mutual in 1916 and 1917, including The Floorwalker, The Rink, The Pawnshop, The Immigrant and Easy Street, which represent the epitome of the short-form slapstick comedian comedies. In The Rink (1916), Chaplin’s impressive roller-skating skills are given considerable prominence in the slapstick antics in the second half of the film, though the ending disappoints, as Charlie escapes his pursuers by hooking his cane on to a passing car. The earlier scenes in the restaurant where Charlie works as a waiter offer much clearer evidence of visual gags that are motivated by the film’s context. One such gag centres on the arrival of Mrs Stout, a very large woman (actually played by the male actor Henry Bergman), clearly too large to fit into the restaurant chair; Chaplin breaks off first one then the other of the arms of the chair before helping her to sit at the table. In formal terms, the film makes use of the long takes that had come to characterise [ 34 ]\n\nMUP_Mundy_White.indd 34\n\n02/11/2012 14:12\n\nsilent film comedy Chaplin comedies, enabling an emphasis on the performance of the visual gags. The Rink also makes effective use of Chaplin’s direct appeal to the viewer, eliciting sympathy for the downtrodden protagonist, though this is overplayed in the gag where Chaplin serves a live cat to a restaurant customer, his look to camera breaking down as Chaplin is unable to restrain a smile, effacing the distinction between actor and character. Perhaps more than any other film, Easy Street (1917) epitomises the maturity of the two-reel slapstick comedian comedy. Though centred on the clowning antics of Chaplin, Easy Street foregrounds the social chaos that characterises the poor, immigrant urban experience, a violent world fuelled by alcohol, crime and drugs, beyond the control of the forces of the law, and where domestic violence goes unrestrained. The transformation of Easy Street from lawless, violent bedlam, dominated by the towering drunken bully (Eric Campbell), into an orderly, law-abiding community is matched by Charlie’s own transformation from an unemployed derelict to c"
