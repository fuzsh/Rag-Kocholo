Sakshi revealed that MSD is not a camera-shy person, and is open to act in movies if a good script comes his way.

“If there is something good, he will do it. He has acted in plenty of advertisements. He is not a camera-shy person and has been in front of the camera since 2006.”

Sakshi was later asked in what genre could fans see MSD act in movies, to which she replied, ‘action’. “If I have to choose for him, it would be action, because he is always in action.”

Notably, Dhoni was recently present in Chennai for the release of the music album Lets Get Married, which is directed by Ramesh Thamilmani.
