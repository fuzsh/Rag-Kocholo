        "text": "A film journalist looks at the era of action-hero movies and the stars that powered them.\n\nThe action movies made in the 1980s and ’90s had no pretensions to be high art. Rather, they told simple stories in which muscle-bound good guys punched, shot, or blew up armies of bad guys. Empire magazine editor de Semlyen, the author of Wild and Crazy Guys, loves the genre, and this book is an engaging tribute to the figures who created it. Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger are at the center, with lengthy biographies, but the author has plenty to say about other stars like Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and the odd Steven Seagal. Some of the action movies of the era—e.g., Rocky, Terminator, Die Hard, and Under Siege—were huge hits, while others made decent money even though their appeal was more limited. Of course, many were awful. Entertainment was the goal, and comic-book violence was the means; any connection with reality was entirely coincidental. There was a long-running feud between Stallone and Schwarzenegger, which de Semlyen enjoys exploring, although he notes that it ended with the two of them waltzing together at a party (which must have been something to see). The period was fun, but it couldn’t last, partly because the stars themselves began to age and partly because CGI would begin to dominate the moviemaking business. Schwarzenegger’s semi-ironic Last Action Hero, made in 1993, foretold the end of the era, with the focus shifting to younger, spryer men like Keanu Reeves as well as to women like Charlize Theron. The author is clear on the reasons for the appeal of the genre: “There’s something eternally comforting…about cheering on characters who don’t need superpowers to make the earth a better place. Just bravery, brawn, and a well-placed kick.”\n\nA joyful romp featuring larger-than-life characters, iconic movies, and plenty of behind-the-scenes info.\n\nA former New York City dancer reflects on her zesty heyday in the 1970s.\n\nDiscovered on a Manhattan street in 2020 and introduced on Stanton’s Humans of New York Instagram page, Johnson, then 76, shares her dynamic history as a “fiercely independent” Black burlesque dancer who used the stage name Tanqueray and became a celebrated fixture in midtown adult theaters. “I was the only black girl making white girl money,” she boasts, telling a vibrant story about sex and struggle in a bygone era. Frank and unapologetic, Johnson vividly captures aspects of her former life as a stage seductress shimmying to blues tracks during 18-minute sets or sewing lingerie for plus-sized dancers. Though her work was far from the Broadway shows she dreamed about, it eventually became all about the nightly hustle to simply survive. Her anecdotes are humorous, heartfelt, and supremely captivating, recounted with the passion of a true survivor and the acerbic wit of a weathered, street-wise New Yorker. She shares stories of growing up in an abusive household in Albany in the 1940s, a teenage pregnancy, and prison time for robbery as nonchalantly as she recalls selling rhinestone G-strings to prostitutes to make them sparkle in the headlights of passing cars. Complemented by an array of revealing personal photographs, the narrative alternates between heartfelt nostalgia about the seedier side of Manhattan’s go-go scene and funny quips about her unconventional stage performances. Encounters with a variety of hardworking dancers, drag queens, and pimps, plus an account of the complexities of a first love with a drug-addled hustler, fill out the memoir with personality and candor. With a narrative assist from Stanton, the result is a consistently titillating and often moving story of human struggle as well as an insider glimpse into the days when Times Square was considered the Big Apple’s gloriously unpolished underbelly. The book also includes Yee’s lush watercolor illustrations.\n\nA blissfully vicarious, heartfelt glimpse into the life of a Manhattan burlesque dancer.\n\nThe iconic model tells the story of her eventful life.\n\nAccording to the acknowledgments, this memoir started as \"a fifty-page poem and then grew into hundreds of pages of…more poetry.\" Readers will be glad that Anderson eventually turned to writing prose, since the well-told anecdotes and memorable character sketches are what make it a page-turner. The poetry (more accurately described as italicized notes-to-self with line breaks) remains strewn liberally through the pages, often summarizing the takeaway or the emotional impact of the events described: \"I was / and still am / an exceptionally / easy target. / And, / I'm proud of that.\" This way of expressing herself is part of who she is, formed partly by her passion for Anaïs Nin and other writers; she is a serious maven of literature and the arts. The narrative gets off to a good start with Anderson’s nostalgic memories of her childhood in coastal Vancouver, raised by very young, very wild, and not very competent parents. Here and throughout the book, the author displays a remarkable lack of anger. She has faced abuse and mistreatment of many kinds over the decades, but she touches on the most appalling passages lightly—though not so lightly you don't feel the torment of the media attention on the events leading up to her divorce from Tommy Lee. Her trip to the pages of Playboy, which involved an escape from a violent fiance and sneaking across the border, is one of many jaw-dropping stories. In one interesting passage, Julian Assange's mother counsels Anderson to desexualize her image in order to be taken more seriously as an activist. She decided that “it was too late to turn back now”—that sexy is an inalienable part of who she is. Throughout her account of this kooky, messed-up, enviable, and often thrilling life, her humility (her sons \"are true miracles, considering the gene pool\") never fails her.\n\nA juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through."
