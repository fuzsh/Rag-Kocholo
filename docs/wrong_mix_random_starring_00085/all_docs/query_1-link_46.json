        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nDanny Madigan is a huge fan of Jack Slater, an action hero played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. When his best friend, Nick the projectionist, gives him a magic ticket to the newest Jack Slater movie, Danny is transported into Slater's world, his number one hero where the good guys always win. It's a dream come true for Danny, but things take a turn for the worse when one of Slater's enemies, Benedict the hit man, gets a hold of the ticket and ends up in Danny's world. Slater and Danny must join forces to stop him at all costs before it'll be the end of Jack Slater.\n\nIntention:\n\nTo remove all the unnecessary dialogue, silly attempt at humour and all scenes where Danny tries to convince Slater he's in a movie. So it will be like how you'd expect having a dream with your favourite action star would go, Danny will be along for the ride and will work with Slater to solve the case using his knowledge and enjoy all the action that comes along with it."
