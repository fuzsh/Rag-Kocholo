        "text": "File picture of BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha.\n\nPatna: Shatrughan Sinha, BJP leader, former actor and quip-trafficker, said today he has a one-point agenda - \"to make action hero (Narendra Modi) the Prime Minister of the country.\"\n\nMr Sinha, 67, has offered this commitment after the BJP agreed to let him run from Parliament from his constituency of Patna Saheb, which he has represented since 2009.\n\n\"I was asked about fighting Lok Sabha election from Delhi but I told the leadership that native Patna Saheb is my first, second and last choice,\" Mr Sinha told reporters.\n\n\"I thank the party for honouring my wish,\" he said. The BJP had recently considered allocating his constituency to Ravi Shankar Prasad, who is a member of the Rajya Sabha.\n\nMr Sinha is a member of the section within the BJP that is loyal to veteran LK Advani. Last year, Mr Advani urged the BJP unsuccessfully against picking Mr Modi as its prime ministerial nominee. Mr Sinha was among those who had publicly criticized the Gujarat Chief Minister.\n\nPromoted\n\nListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"Advaniji is an elderly statesman who has always guided the party,\" the former Bollywood star said today. His remarks referenced Mr Advani's rift with the BJP over his own constituency. While the party wanted him to run for a sixth term from Gandhinagar in Gujarat, Mr Advani had indicated a preference for moving to Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nHowever, this evening, he said that after the BJP offered him a choice, he has decided to stick to Gandhinagar.\n\n."
