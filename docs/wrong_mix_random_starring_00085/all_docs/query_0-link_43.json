        "text": "You know the drill. This is where your burning questions come to stop, drop, and roll their way into the blog. As always, these are actual emails from actual readers (. . . as far as you know).\n\n“What’s the language adjustment been like over there? Do most people speak English?”\n\n– Steven K., Dayton\n\nMost people speak some level of English, it just varies how well they speak it. Usually, speech takes on a weird hybrid known as Tanglish (Tamil + English), where a speaker will slip in and out of each language in the middle of a sentence. Sometimes the best word to use is only found in one of the languages, so they’ll borrow it and transition seamlessly back to the other language. The King’s English not the first language for anyone, though, so often times they won’t use it unless they have to. As far as the workplace goes, my coworkers all speak English pretty well (they have to in order to do their jobs). This doesn’t mean that they speak it all the time though. In the break room, I’m likely to be found sitting silently while a crossfire of Tamil darts back and forth. Impossible to understand? Absolutely. Are they calling me names without me realizing it? Almost certainly.\n\n“Have you been compared to or mistaken for any celebrities?”\n\n– Wes G., Memphis\n\nDespite the fact that all white people look alike, I have not yet been mistaken for a famous Caucasian. I have been told I resemble a couple though. I’ll let my five readers be the judge:\n\nExhibit A – Wayne Rooney, professional soccer player\n\nI can go along with this. Dude’s not exactly hideous, and I kinda see the squinty eyes/disappearing hair thing. I’ve been compared to Rooney by a few different people here, actually, and I can roll with it. The next guy, however…\n\nExhibit B – “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, pro wrassler\n\nSo yeah, some comparisons are more flattering than others. I think I’ve already told the story, but what’s great about the Steve Austin one was that three teenagers told me about my alleged resemblance while I was on the beach. I thought for a moment, “Umkay, not great, but at least I guess the guy’s in good shape. I’ll choose to focus on that part.” Not two seconds later, one of the dudes followed up with, “… But only in the face.” So bald and not entirely clean-shaven? Got it.\n\n“Is arranged marriage in India culturally or religiously based? For example, would a Christian couple in India have an arranged marriage? If so, do you think you could get in on that?”\n\n– Stephen B., Memphis\n\nThe tradition of arranged marriages transcends religion. It’s practiced by everybody, and some estimates I’ve heard claim that 70-75% of marriages in India are still arranged today. Chew on that. Most parents are traditional here, and want to control all aspects of the engagement and wedding. Often times, when a couple falls in love and eschews their parents’ involvement in the process, the young couple will be financially cut off and disowned.\n\nOne of the weirdest/funniest things I’ve seen here is a particular store in the mall by the name of “Tamil Matrimony.” It’s like if Match.com or eHarmony had a physical site. From what I’m told, you can go in and pay a fee to the company to build you a profile and match you with a member of the opposite sex. The company does this by matching up the most important criteria: social status, salary, and caste, of course. This is all similar to most familiar dating site procedures, but the difference is that once you’re paired up with someone, you’re pretty much expected to marry that person. You don’t have to, of course, but if you’re an Indian who’s had to pay a company to pick out a spouse, you might not be the choosiest person in the world. Needless to say, the company boasts an incredible marriage rate. The average Raj can stroll into the mall with jeans on his mind and leave with the deets on his soon-to-be wife. Tamil Matrimony, everybody!\n\n“Speaking of arranged marriages, how’s ol’ Karthik doing?”\n\n– Lacy K., Dayton\n\nBoy oh boy. Okay, so when he picked me up at the airport a few weeks ago, one of the first things I asked him was about his honeymoon. If you recall, Karthik got hitched in November, held the reception in early December, and waited to take his honeymoon until I’d left – that way, he’d have nearly three weeks just to him and Saranya. He laughed when I asked him about it though. I was confused. “You didn’t go to Goa (a beach getaway on India’s West Coast)?” “No, sir,” he replied through a smile. Karthik explained to me that right after I left, they found out Saranya was pregnant. Clearly, they’d wasted no time (Mazel tov, Karthik!). So he shook his head and explained pithily, “No honeymoon, sir.” I wasn’t aware of this until he explained it to me, but pregnancy is treated a bit differently here. Once a woman is pregnant, she is kept from any physically strenuous activity for the duration of the pregnancy, if at all possible. Oftentimes, including in Saranya’s case, the woman goes to stay with her family, so that she can receive round-the-clock attention and care while her husband stays behind and works. So for the last month, Saranya has moved back in with her parents an hour and a half away from Chennai. Karthik visits her when he can, once every couple of weekends or so. Is there any merit to this system, where the man avoids all that accompanies pregnancy, while the woman doesn’t have to see the face of the perpetrator responsible for her growing sentiment of “YOU DID THIS TO ME”? You decide. At any rate, this is the most anticipated pregnancy and birth since the San Diego Zoo’s Ling-Wong in the late ‘70s. I’ll post updates as I receive them.\n\n“Anything good on TV over there?”\n\n– Chip D., NY\n\nThere’s usually something entertaining on the movie channels (the English ones, anyway. I don’t venture over to the trippy, acid-fueled, low-budget, 1980’s Bollywood musicals.). Just by keeping some of the movies on in the background, though, I’ve been able to occasionally glance up at some half-decent flick and go, “Wait a minute… he was in that?” This has been the best part of TV over here, actually – just watching movies I haven’t seen in years and noticing all the strange casting. I’ll give you a few examples:\n\nSir Ian McKellen (“Gandalf” from Lord of the Rings, “Magneto” from X-men)\n\nAlso in 1994’s The Shadow, starring Alec Baldwin (McKellen played the absent-minded scientist), and 1993’s Last Action Hero, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger (where he played “Death,” only getting one or two lines).\n\nChris Parnell (Saturday Night Live, Anchorman)\n\nAlso in 1996’s Christmas classic Jingle All the Way, starring (you guessed it) Arnold Schwarzenegger, playing an annoying toy store clerk. (Say it with me: “DAHSHUH-DAHNTZUH-PRAHNTZUH-VEEXEN-KAHMIT-KYOOPIT-DAHNAH-BLEETZEN!” I hope you enjoyed that as much as I did.)\n\nMichael Fassbender (“Magneto” from X-men: First Class)\n\nAlso in 2006’s 300 (the one about SPAH-TAH), playing “Stelios.”\n\nEric Stonestreet (“Cam,” A.K.A. “the flamboyant one,” from Modern Family)\n\nAlso in 2005’s The Island , starring Ewan McGregor. In the most ironic of casting choices, Stonestreet played a burly trucker who walks into a men’s public restroom, intruding on an awkward situation with two guys (the classic, “It’s not what it looks like…” scenario). Stonestreet’s character, completely weirded out, avoided eye contact and immediately exited the bathroom. Clearly, the actor has range.\n\nSide-note: Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of two celebrities here who are way more popular than I expected. In Arnold’s case, apparently he appealed to the action-loving, non-English-fluent masses in India. They recognized one of their own, I suppose. Even his most forgettable movies are played constantly over here. The second celebrity is Michael Jackson. Dude is still crazy-loved on the subcontinent. He is undoubtedly the most-liked of any Western musician, living or dead. Now that you know way more than you ever cared to know about Indian TV and cameo roles, let’s move on.\n\n“You seem to be well-liked, sometimes maybe even because of your race. Ever had any negative experiences due to your unparalleled whiteness?”\n\n– Jesse J., Chicago\n\nIt’s true that being a novelty has had some perks. Only on one or two instances, though, has my melanin deficiency caused trouble. First, generally, homeless people flock to me in a literal bum rush. The common assumption is White = $. But the only specific instance was when a teenager at a road-side shop tried to sell me a Coke for 3x the actual value, just to see if he could. AU CONTRAIRE. Sorry, son. Trying to mark up a Coke by Rs. 35 is the second-oldest trick in the book (the first, of course, being “Never get involved in a land war in Asia.”) Supposedly, taxi drivers and other salespeople also charge white people more, believing they can pay and won’t know they’re being overcharged. With Karthik around to do the talking, however, people are often hesitant to try to pull one over on Whitey.\n\n“Caylee called us out of the blue the other day “just to say hello,” but really it was a transparent attempt to squeeze her way into the Favorite Child spot. It was cute. You can tell that sort of gesture doesn’t come naturally for her but you applaud the effort anyway. It was like when little Samson used to try and walk on his hind legs. Except in Samson’s case, he wasn’t, ya know, our Tied for Third-Least-Favorite pet.”\n\n– Bonnie C., Dayton\n\nYup, these are my readers.\n\nSorry it took me a little while to get this one out. I had to sort through and cull ALL KINDS of questions because I have MANY FRIENDS. FOR REAL, YOU GUYS.\n\nSomething Extra: From 1979 to 1993, New York City had upwards of 3,000 obsolete, non-working fire hydrants on sidewalks for the sole purpose of increasing parking violation revenue.\n\nLasting Image:\n\nPlay us out, The Rocket Summer!"
