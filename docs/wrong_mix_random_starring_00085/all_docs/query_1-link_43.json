Paul Scheer & Jason Mantzoukas join us once again for a clock-busting, rip-roaring time, and weâre unpacking all of this movieâs meta madness. Is John McTiernan able to parody his own work? Should the kid have actually killed people in this movie (as in the original, edgier script)? Will David have an aneurysm if this episode recording doesnât end at a reasonable time? Pre-order Paulâs Book: https://www.paulscheer.com/my-book And if anyone has what Jason is looking for, email blankcheckpodcast@gmail.com and well get it to him.
