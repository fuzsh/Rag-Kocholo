        "text": "Abstract\n\nMultiple pathways contribute to the pathophysiological development of type 1 diabetes (T1D); however, the exact mechanisms involved are unclear. We performed differential gene expression analysis in pancreatic islets of NOD mice versus age-matched congenic NOD.B10 controls to identify genes that may contribute to disease pathogenesis. Novel genes related to extracellular matrix development and glucagon and insulin signaling/secretion were changed in NOD mice during early inflammation. During \"respective\" insulitis, the expression of genes encoding multiple chemosensory olfactory receptors were upregulated, and during \"destructive\" insulitis, the expression of genes involved in antimicrobial defense and iron homeostasis were downregulated. Islet inflammation reduced the expression of Hamp that encodes hepcidin. Hepcidin is expressed in β-cells and serves as the key regulator of iron homeostasis. We showed that Hamp and hepcidin levels were lower, while iron levels were higher in the pancreas of 12-week-old NOD versus NOD.B10 mice, suggesting that a loss of iron homeostasis may occur in the islets during the onset of \"destructive\" insulitis. Interestingly, we showed that the severity of NOD disease correlates with dietary iron intake. NOD mice maintained on low-iron diets had a lower incidence of hyperglycemia, while those maintained on high-iron diets had an earlier onset and higher incidence of disease, suggesting that high iron exposure combined with a loss of pancreatic iron homeostasis may exacerbate NOD disease. This mechanism may explain the link seen between high iron exposure and the increased risk for T1D in humans.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2337/db21-0948\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000905183700009\n\nView details for PubMedID 35499603\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9233262\n\nAbstract\n\nRegulatory T cells (Tregs) normally maintain self-tolerance. Tregs recognize \"self\" such that when they are not working properly, such as in autoimmunity, the immune system can attack and destroy one's own tissues. Current therapies for autoimmunity rely on relatively ineffective and too often toxic therapies to \"treat\" the destructive inflammation. Restoring defective endogenous immune regulation (self-tolerance) would represent a paradigm shift in the therapy of these diseases. One recent approach to restore self-tolerance is to use \"low dose IL-2\" as a therapy to increase the number of circulating Tregs. However, studies to-date have not demonstrated that low-dose IL-2 therapy can restore concomitant Treg function, and phase 2 studies in low dose IL-2 treated patients with autoimmune diseases have failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefit. We hypothesize that the defect in self-tolerance seen in autoimmunity is not due to an insufficient number of available Tregs, but rather, due to defects in second messengers downstream of the IL-2R that normally control Treg function and stability. Previous studies from our lab and others have demonstrated that GRAIL (a ubiquitin E3 ligase) is important in Treg function. GRAIL expression is markedly diminished in Tregs from patients with autoimmune diseases and allergic asthma and is also diminished in Tregs of mice that are considered autoimmune prone. In the relevant pathway in Tregs, GRAIL normally blocks cullin ring ligase activity, which inhibits IL-2R desensitization in Tregs and consequently promotes Treg function. As a result of this defect in GRAIL expression, the Tregs of patients with autoimmune diseases and allergic asthma degrade IL-2R-associated pJAK1 following activation with low dose IL-2, and thus cannot maintain pSTAT5 expression. pSTAT5 controls the transcription of genes required for Treg function. Additionally, the GRAIL-mediated defect may also allow the degradation of the mTOR inhibitor, DEP domain-containing mTOR interacting protein (Deptor). This can lead to IL-2R activation of mTOR and loss of Treg stability in autoimmune patients. Using a monoclonal antibody to the remnant di-glycine tag on ubiquitinated proteins after trypsin digestion, we identified a protein that was ubiquitinated by GRAIL that is important in Treg function, cullin5. Our data demonstrate that GRAIL acts a negative regulator of IL-2R desensitization by ubiquitinating a lysine on cullin5 that must be neddylated to allow cullin5 cullin ring ligase activity. We hypothesize that a neddylation inhibitor in combination with low dose IL-2 activation could be used to substitute for GRAIL and restore Treg function and stability in the Tregs of autoimmune and allergic asthma patients. However, the neddylation activating enzyme inhibitors (NAEi) are toxic when given systemically. By generating a protein drug conjugate (PDC) consisting of a NAEi bound, via cleavable linkers, to a fusion protein of murine IL-2 (to target the drug to Tregs), we were able to use 1000-fold less of the neddylation inhibitor drug than the amount required for therapeutically effective systemic delivery. The PDC was effective in blocking the onset or the progression of disease in several mouse models of autoimmunity (type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis) and a mouse model of allergic asthma in the absence of detectable toxicity. This PDC strategy represents targeted drug delivery at its best where the defect causing the disease was identified, a drug was designed and developed to correct the defect, and the drug was targeted and delivered only to cells that needed it, maximizing safety and efficacy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fimmu.2022.1046631\n\nView details for PubMedID 36569931\n\nAbstract\n\nType 1 Diabetes (T1D) occurs as a result of the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells by self-reactive T cells. The etiology of this disease is complex and difficult to study due to a lack of disease-relevant tissues from pre-diabetic individuals. In this study, we performed gene expression analysis on human pancreas tissues obtained from the Network of Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD), and showed that 155 genes were differentially expressed by ≥2-fold in the pancreata of autoantibody-positive (AA+) at-risk individuals compared to healthy controls. Only 48 of these genes remained changed by ≥2-fold in the pancreata of established T1D patients. Pathway analysis of these genes showed a significant association with various immune pathways. We were able to validate the differential expression of eight disease-relevant genes by QPCR analysis: A significant upregulation of CADM2, and downregulation of TRPM5, CRH, PDK4, ANGPL4, CLEC4D, RSG16, and FCGR2B was confirmed in the pancreata of AA+ individuals versus controls. Studies have already implicated FCGR2B in the pathogenesis of disease in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Here we showed that CADM2, TRPM5, PDK4, and ANGPL4 were similarly changed in the pancreata of pre-diabetic 12-week-old NOD mice compared to NOD.B10 controls, suggesting a possible role for these genes in the pathogenesis of both T1D and NOD disease. The loss of the leukocyte-specific gene, FCGR2B, in the pancreata of AA+ individuals, is particularly interesting, as it may serve as a potential whole blood biomarker of disease progression. To test this, we quantified FCGR2B expression in peripheral blood samples of T1D patients, and AA+ and AA- first-degree relatives of T1D patients enrolled in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study. We showed that FCGR2B was significantly reduced in the peripheral blood of AA+ individuals compared to AA- controls. Together, these findings demonstrate that gene expression analysis of pancreatic tissue and peripheral blood samples can be used to identify disease-relevant genes and pathways and potential biomarkers of disease progression in T1D.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fendo.2020.609271\n\nView details for PubMedID 33424774\n\nAbstract\n\nThere are variable reports of risk of concordance for progression to islet autoantibodies and type 1 diabetes in identical twins after one twin is diagnosed. We examined development of positive autoantibodies and type 1 diabetes and the effects of genetic factors and common environment on autoantibody positivity in identical twins, nonidentical twins, and full siblings.Subjects from the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study (N = 48,026) were screened from 2004 to 2015 for islet autoantibodies (GAD antibody [GADA], insulinoma-associated antigen 2 [IA-2A], and autoantibodies against insulin [IAA]). Of these subjects, 17,226 (157 identical twins, 283 nonidentical twins, and 16,786 full siblings) were followed for autoantibody positivity or type 1 diabetes for a median of 2.1 years.At screening, identical twins were more likely to have positive GADA, IA-2A, and IAA than nonidentical twins or full siblings (all P < 0.0001). Younger age, male sex, and genetic factors were significant factors for expression of IA-2A, IAA, one or more positive autoantibodies, and two or more positive autoantibodies (all P ≤ 0.03). Initially autoantibody-positive identical twins had a 69% risk of diabetes by 3 years compared with 1.5% for initially autoantibody-negative identical twins. In nonidentical twins, type 1 diabetes risk by 3 years was 72% for initially multiple autoantibody-positive, 13% for single autoantibody-positive, and 0% for initially autoantibody-negative nonidentical twins. Full siblings had a 3-year type 1 diabetes risk of 47% for multiple autoantibody-positive, 12% for single autoantibody-positive, and 0.5% for initially autoantibody-negative subjects.Risk of type 1 diabetes at 3 years is high for initially multiple and single autoantibody-positive identical twins and multiple autoantibody-positive nonidentical twins. Genetic predisposition, age, and male sex are significant risk factors for development of positive autoantibodies in twins.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2337/dc18-0288\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000457193000013\n\nView details for PubMedID 30061316\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6341285\n\nAbstract\n\nA pilot study suggested that combination therapy with low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) preserves C-peptide in established type 1 diabetes (T1D) (duration 4 months to 2 years). We hypothesized that 1) low-dose ATG/GCSF or 2) low-dose ATG alone would slow the decline of β-cell function in patients with new-onset T1D (duration <100 days).A three-arm, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial was performed by the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Study Group in 89 subjects: 29 subjects randomized to ATG (2.5 mg/kg intravenously) followed by pegylated GCSF (6 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 6 doses), 29 to ATG alone (2.5 mg/kg), and 31 to placebo. The primary end point was mean area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide during a 2-h mixed-meal tolerance test 1 year after initiation of therapy. Significance was defined as one-sided P value < 0.025.The 1-year mean AUC C-peptide was significantly higher in subjects treated with ATG (0.646 nmol/L) versus placebo (0.406 nmol/L) (P = 0.0003) but not in those treated with ATG/GCSF (0.528 nmol/L) versus placebo (P = 0.031). HbA1c was significantly reduced at 1 year in subjects treated with ATG and ATG/GCSF, P = 0.002 and 0.011, respectively.Low-dose ATG slowed decline of C-peptide and reduced HbA1c in new-onset T1D. Addition of GCSF did not enhance C-peptide preservation afforded by low-dose ATG. Future studies should be considered to determine whether low-dose ATG alone or in combination with other agents may prevent or delay the onset of the disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2337/dc18-0494\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000442337700017\n\nView details for PubMedID 30012675\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC6105329\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough certain dogma portrays amyloid fibrils as drivers of neurodegenerative disease and neuroinflammation, we have found, paradoxically, that amyloid fibrils and small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). They reduce clinical paralysis and induce immunosuppressive pathways, diminishing inflammation. A key question was the identification of the target for these molecules. When sHsps and amyloid fibrils were chemically cross-linked to immune cells, a limited number of proteins were precipitated, including the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 NAChR). The alpha7 NAChR is noteworthy among the over 20 known receptors for amyloid fibrils, because it plays a central role in a well-defined immune-suppressive pathway. Competitive binding between amyloid fibrils and alpha-bungarotoxin to peritoneal macrophages (MPhis) confirmed the involvement of alpha7 NAChR. The mechanism of immune suppression was explored, and, similar to nicotine, amyloid fibrils inhibited LPS induction of a common set of inflammatory cytokines while inducing Stat3 signaling and autophagy. Consistent with this, previous studies have established that nicotine, sHsps, and amyloid fibrils all were effective therapeutics in EAE. Interestingly, B lymphocytes were needed for the therapeutic effect. These results suggest that agonists of alpha7 NAChR might have therapeutic benefit for a variety of inflammatory diseases.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29915045\n\nAbstract\n\nType 1 diabetes requires major lifestyle changes and carries increased morbidity and mortality. Prevention or delay of diabetes would have major clinical effect.To determine whether oral insulin delays onset of type 1 diabetes in autoantibody-positive relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes.Between March 2, 2007, and December 21, 2015, relatives with at least 2 autoantibodies, including insulin autoantibodies and normal glucose tolerance, were enrolled in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Finland, and Germany. The main study group (n = 389) had first-phase insulin release on an intravenous glucose tolerance test that was higher than the threshold. The 55 patients in the secondary stratum 1 had an identical antibody profile as the main study group except they had first-phase insulin release that was lower than the threshold. Secondary strata 2 (n = 114) and strata 3 (n = 3) had different autoantibody profiles and first-phase insulin release threshold combinations. Follow-up continued through December 31, 2016.Randomization to receive 7.5 mg/d of oral insulin (n = 283) or placebo (n = 277), including participants in the main study group who received oral insulin (n = 203) or placebo (n = 186).The primary outcome was time to diabetes in the main study group. Significance was based on a 1-sided threshold of .05, and 1-sided 95% CIs are reported.Of a total of 560 randomized participants (median enrollment age, 8.2 years; interquartile range [IQR], 5.7-12.1 years; 170 boys [60%]; 90.7% white non-Hispanic; 57.6% with a sibling with type 1 diabetes), 550 completed the trial including 389 participants (median age, 8.4 years; 245 boys [63%]), 382 (96%) in the main study group. During a median follow-up of 2.7 years (IQR, 1.5-4.6 years) in the main study group, diabetes was diagnosed in 58 participants (28.5%) in the oral insulin group and 62 (33%) in the placebo group. Time to diabetes was not significantly different between the 2 groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0-1.2; P = .21). In secondary stratum 1 (n = 55), diabetes was diagnosed in 13 participants (48.1%) in the oral insulin group and in 19 participants (70.3%) in the placebo group. The time to diabetes was significantly longer with oral insulin (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0-0.82; P = .006). The HR for time to diabetes for the between-group comparisons for the 116 participants in the other secondary stratum was 1.03 (95% CI, 0-2.11; P = .53) and for the entire cohort of 560 participants was 0.83 (95% CI, 0-1.07; P = .11), which were not significantly different. The most common adverse event was infection (n = 254), with 134 events in the oral insulin group and 120 events in the placebo group, but no significant study-related adverse events occurred.Among autoantibody-positive relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes, oral insulin at a dose of 7.5 mg/d, compared with placebo, did not delay or prevent the development of type 1 diabetes over 2.7 years. These findings do not support oral insulin as used in this study for diabetes prevention.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00419562.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jama.2017.17070\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000415870300019\n\nView details for PubMedID 29164254\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5798455\n\nAbstract\n\nThe natural history of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is challenging to investigate, especially as pre-diabetic individuals are difficult to identify. Numerous T1D consortia have been established to collect whole blood for gene expression analysis from individuals with or at risk to develop T1D. However, with no universally accepted protocol for their collection, differences in sample processing may lead to variances in the results. Here, we examined whether the choice of blood collection tube and RNA extraction kit leads to differences in the expression of genes that are changed during the progression of T1D, and if these differences could be minimized by measuring gene expression directly from the lysate of whole blood.Microarray analysis showed that the expression of 901 genes is highly influenced by sample processing using the PAXgene versus the Tempus system. These included a significant number of lymphocyte-specific genes and genes whose expression has been reported to differ in the peripheral blood of at-risk and T1D patients compared to controls. We showed that artificial changes in gene expression occur when control and T1D samples were processed differently. The sample processing-dependent differences in gene expression were largely due to loss of transcripts during the RNA extraction step using the PAXgene system. The majority of differences were not observed when gene expression was measured in whole blood lysates prepared from blood collected in PAXgene and Tempus tubes.We showed that the gene expression profile of samples processed using the Tempus system is more accurate than that of samples processed using the PAXgene system. Variation in sample processing can result in misleading changes in gene expression. However, these differences can be minimized by measuring gene expression directly in whole blood lysates.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28821222\n\nAbstract\n\nSevere forms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a common upper airway inflammatory disorder, are associated with nasal polyps (NPs). NP disease is ameliorated by glucocorticoid (GC) treatment, whose cellular effects are poorly understood. We therefore assessed the influence of GC therapy on NPs in CRS patients, focusing on regulatory T (Treg) cells. Treg cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry in NPs and control tissues from GC-treated CRS patients and controls. After GC exposure, selective expansion of Treg cells was seen within NPs, and not blood or adjacent ethmoid tissues. To confirm direct GC effects, NPs from the same patients were biopsied prior to, and following, 1week of oral GC exposure. Direct expansion of Tregs into the same NP bed was detected in 4/4 CRS patients following GC exposure. Treg cell spikes into NPs were secondary to cellular recruitment given limited Ki67 expression within these regulatory cells. Chemokine gene expression profiling identified several chemokines, notably CCL4, induced within NPs upon GC treatment. Neutralization of chemokine receptor/ligand interactions using CCR4 small molecule antagonists reduced Treg migration towards GC-treated NPs in an ex vivo migration assay. Our findings suggest that the common use of GCs in the treatment of NP disease leads to recruitment of Treg cells from peripheral sites into NP tissues, which may be critical to the anti-inflammatory effect of GCs. Mechanistically Treg expansion appears to be conferred, in part, by chemokine receptor/ligand interactions induced following corticosteroid therapy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.clim.2017.02.002\n\nView details for PubMedID 28279811\n\nAbstract\n\nAntinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are detected in ∼18% of females, yet autoimmune disease develops in only 5-8%. Immunologic differences between ANA-positive healthy individuals and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may elucidate the regulatory mechanisms by which ANA-positive individuals avoid transition to clinical autoimmune disease.Healthy individuals (n = 790) were screened for autoantibodies specific for 11 antigens associated with lupus, systemic sclerosis, and Sjögren's syndrome. From this screening, 31 European American ANA-positive healthy individuals were selected and demographically matched to ANA-negative controls and SLE patients. Serum cytokine profiles, leukocyte subset frequency, and reactivity were analyzed by multiplex assays, immunophenotyping, and phosphospecific flow cytometry.Of 790 individuals screened, 57 (7%) were ANA-positive. The majority of proinflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-17 (IL-17), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, exhibited a stepwise increase in serum levels from ANA-negative controls to ANA-positive healthy individuals to SLE patients (P < 0.0001). IFNα, IFNβ, IL-12p40, and stem cell factor/c-Kit ligand were increased in SLE patients only (P < 0.05). B lymphocyte stimulator (BlyS) was elevated in SLE patients but decreased in ANA-positive individuals (P < 0.001). Further, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was down-regulated in SLE patients only (P < 0.0001). ANA-positive individuals had increased frequencies of monocytes, memory B cells, and plasmablasts and increased levels of pSTAT-1 and pSTAT-3 following IFNα stimulation compared with ANA-negative controls (P < 0.05).ANA-positive healthy individuals exhibit dysregulation in multiple immune pathways yet differ from SLE patients by the absence of elevated IFNs, BLyS, IL-12p40, and stem cell factor/c-Kit ligand. Further, severely decreased levels of IL-1Ra in SLE patients compared with ANA-positive individuals may contribute to disease development. These results highlight the importance of IFN-related pathways and regulatory elements in SLE pathogenesis.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/art.39706\n\nView details for PubMedID 27059145\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5042816\n\nAbstract\n\nType 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoreactive T cells that recognize pancreatic islet antigens and destroy insulin-producing β-cells. This attack results from a breakdown in tolerance for self-antigens, which is controlled by ectopic antigen expression in the thymus and pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs). The autoantigens known to be involved include a set of islet proteins, such as insulin, GAD65, IA-2, and ZnT8. In an attempt to identify additional antigenic proteins, we performed an expression-based genome-wide association study using microarray data from 118 arrays of the thymus and PLNs of T1D mice. We ranked all 16,089 protein-coding genes by the likelihood of finding repeated differential expression and the degree of tissue specificity for pancreatic islets. The top autoantigen candidate was vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP). T-cell proliferation assays showed stronger T-cell reactivity to VDBP compared with control stimulations. Higher levels and frequencies of serum anti-VDBP autoantibodies (VDBP-Abs) were identified in patients with T1D (n = 331) than in healthy control subjects (n = 77). Serum vitamin D levels were negatively correlated with VDBP-Ab levels in patients in whom T1D developed during the winter. Immunohistochemical localization revealed that VDBP was specifically expressed in α-cells of pancreatic islets. We propose that VDBP could be an autoantigen in T1D.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2337/db15-1308\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000375028000023\n\nView details for PubMedID 26983959\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4839207\n\nAbstract\n\nThe evolution of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) therapy has been marked by consecutive shifts, from insulin replacement to immunosuppressive drugs and targeted biologics (following the understanding that T1D is an autoimmune disease), and to more disease-specific or patient-oriented approaches such as antigen-specific and cell-based therapies, with a goal to provide efficacy, safety, and long-term protection. At the same time, another important paradigm shift from treatment of new onset T1D patients to prevention in high-risk individuals has taken place, based on the hypothesis that therapeutic approaches deemed sufficiently safe may show better efficacy if applied early enough to maintain endogenous β cell function, a concept supported by many preclinical studies. This new strategy has been made possible by capitalizing on a variety of biomarkers that can more reliably estimate the risk and rate of progression of the disease. More advanced (\"omic\"-based) biomarkers that also shed light on the underlying contributors of disease for each individual will be helpful to guide the choice of the most appropriate therapies, or combinations thereof. In this review, we present current efforts to stratify patients according to biomarkers and current alternatives to conventional drug-based therapies for T1D, with a special emphasis on cell-based therapies, their status in the clinic and potential for treatment and/or prevention.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/stem.2290\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000374697700002\n\nView details for PubMedID 26840009\n\nAbstract\n\nPeripheral tolerance is partially controlled by the expression of peripheral tissue antigens (PTAs) in lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs). We previously identified a transcriptional regulator, deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 (Deaf1), that can regulate PTA expression in LNSCs of the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs). During the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), Deaf1 is spliced to form the dominant-negative isoform Deaf1-Var1. Here we show that Deaf1-Var1 expression correlates with the severity of disease in NOD mice and is reduced in the PLNs of mice that do not develop hyperglycemia. Inflammation and hyperglycemia independently drive Deaf1 splicing through activation of the splicing factors Srsf10 and Ptbp2, respectively. Inflammation induced by injection of activated splenocytes increased Deaf1-Var1 and Srsf10, but not Ptbp2, in the PLNs of NOD.SCID mice. Hyperglycemia induced by treatment with the insulin receptor agonist S961 increased Deaf1-Var1 and Ptbp2, but not Srsf10, in the PLNs of NOD.B10 and NOD mice. Overexpression of PTBP2 and/or SRSF10 also increased human DEAF1-VAR1 and reduced PTA expression in HEK293T cells. These data suggest that during the progression of T1D, inflammation and hyperglycemia mediate the splicing of DEAF1 and loss of PTA expression in LNSCs by regulating the expression of SRSF10 and PTBP2.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2337/db14-0803\n\nView details for PubMedID 25187368\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4303971\n\nAbstract\n\nType 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex polygenic disease that is triggered by various environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals. The emphasis placed on genome-wide association studies to explain the genetics of T1D has failed to advance our understanding of T1D pathogenesis or identify biomarkers of disease progression or therapeutic targets. Using the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D and the non-disease prone congenic NOD.B10 mice, our laboratory demonstrated striking tissue-specific and age-dependent changes in gene expression during disease progression. We established a \"roadmap\" of differential gene expression and used this to identify candidate genes in mice (and human orthologs) that play a role in disease pathology. Here, we describe two genes, Deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 (Deaf1) and Adenosine A1 receptor (Adora1), that are differentially expressed and alternatively spliced in the pancreatic lymph nodes or islets of NOD mice and T1D patients to form dominant-negative non-functional isoforms. Loss of Deaf1 function leads to reduced peripheral tissue antigen expression in lymph node stromal cells and may contribute to a breakdown in peripheral tolerance, while reduced Adora1 function results in an early intrinsic alpha cell defect that may explain the hyperglucagonemia and resulting beta cell stress observed prior to the onset of diabetes. Remarkably, both genes were also alternatively spliced in the same tissues of auto-antibody positive prediabetic patients, and these splicing events resulted in similar downstream effects as those seen in NOD mice.

Here, we show that the expression of a potential glucagon inhibitor, the adenosine A1 receptor (Adora1), is gradually diminished in α-cells of NOD mice, autoantibody-positive (AA(+)) and overtly type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients during the progression of disease. We demonstrated that islet inflammation was associated with loss of Adora1 expression through the alternative splicing of Adora1. Expression of the spliced variant (Adora1-Var) was upregulated in the pancreas of 12-week-old NOD versus age-matched NOD.B10 (non-diabetes-susceptible) control mice and was detected in the pancreas of AA(+) patients but not in control subjects or overtly diabetic patients, suggesting that inflammation drives the splicing of Adora1. We subsequently demonstrated that Adora1-Var expression was upregulated in the islets of NOD.B10 mice after exposure to inflammatory cytokines and in the pancreas of NOD.SCID mice after adoptive transfer of activated autologous splenocytes. Adora1-Var encodes a dominant-negative N-terminal truncated isoform of Adora1. The splicing of Adora1 and loss of Adora1 expression on α-cells may explain the hyperglucagonemia observed in prediabetic NOD mice and may contribute to the pathogenesis of human T1D and NOD disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2337/db13-0614\n\nView details for PubMedID 24264405\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3837064\n\nAbstract\n\nTo assess effectiveness of inpatient hybrid closed-loop control (HCLC) followed by outpatient sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy initiated within 7 days of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes on the preservation of β-cell function at 1 year.Sixty-eight individuals (mean age 13.3 ± 5.7 years; 35% female, 92% Caucasian) were randomized to HCLC followed by SAP therapy (intensive group; N = 48) or to the usual-care group treated with multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy (N = 20). Primary outcome was C-peptide concentrations during mixed-meal tolerance tests at 12 months.Intensive-group participants initiated HCLC a median of 6 days after diagnosis for a median duration of 71.3 h, during which median participant mean glucose concentration was 140 mg/dL (interquartile range 134-153 mg/dL). During outpatient SAP, continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use decreased over time, and at 12 months, only 33% of intensive participants averaged sensor use ≥6 days/week. In the usual-care group, insulin pump and CGM use were initiated prior to 12 months by 15 and 5 participants, respectively. Mean HbA1c levels were similar in both groups throughout the study. At 12 months, the geometric mean (95% CI) of C-peptide area under the curve was 0.43 (0.34-0.52) pmol/mL in the intensive group and 0.52 (0.32-0.75) pmol/mL in the usual-care group (P = 0.49). Thirty-seven (79%) intensive and 16 (80%) usual-care participants had a peak C-peptide concentration ≥0.2 pmol/mL (P = 0.30).In new-onset type 1 diabetes, HCLC followed by SAP therapy did not provide benefit in preserving β-cell function compared with current standards of care.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2337/dc13-1074\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000327211500053\n\nView details for PubMedID 24130350\n\nAbstract\n\nInnate immunity contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, but until now no randomised, controlled trials of blockade of the key innate immune mediator interleukin-1 have been done. We aimed to assess whether canakinumab, a human monoclonal anti-interleukin-1 antibody, or anakinra, a human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, improved β-cell function in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.We did two randomised, placebo-controlled trials in two groups of patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes and mixed-meal-tolerance-test-stimulated C peptide of at least 0·2 nM. Patients in the canakinumab trial were aged 6-45 years and those in the anakinra trial were aged 18-35 years. Patients in the canakinumab trial were enrolled at 12 sites in the USA and Canada and those in the anakinra trial were enrolled at 14 sites across Europe. Participants were randomly assigned by computer-generated blocked randomisation to subcutaneous injection of either 2 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) canakinumab or placebo monthly for 12 months or 100 mg anakinra or placebo daily for 9 months. Participants and carers were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was baseline-adjusted 2-h area under curve C-peptide response to the mixed meal tolerance test at 12 months (canakinumab trial) and 9 months (anakinra trial). Analyses were by intention to treat. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00947427 and NCT00711503, and EudraCT number 2007-007146-34.Patients were enrolled in the canakinumab trial between Nov 12, 2010, and April 11, 2011, and in the anakinra trial between Jan 26, 2009, and May 25, 2011. 69 patients were randomly assigned to canakinumab (n=47) or placebo (n=22) monthly for 12 months and 69 were randomly assigned to anakinra (n=35) or placebo (n=34) daily for 9 months. No interim analyses were done. 45 canakinumab-treated and 21 placebo-treated patients in the canakinumab trial and 25 anakinra-treated and 26 placebo-treated patients in the anakinra trial were included in the primary analyses. The difference in C peptide area under curve between the canakinumab and placebo groups at 12 months was 0·01 nmol/L (95% CI -0·11 to 0·14; p=0·86), and between the anakinra and the placebo groups at 9 months was 0·02 nmol/L (-0·09 to 0·15; p=0·71). The number and severity of adverse events did not differ between groups in the canakinumab trial. In the anakinra trial, patients in the anakinra group had significantly higher grades of adverse events than the placebo group (p=0·018), which was mainly because of a higher number of injection site reactions in the anakinra group.Canakinumab and anakinra were safe but were not effective as single immunomodulatory drugs in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.

Phenotyping these diseases for diagnosis, prognosis and selection of therapies is an ever increasing problem. Advances in multiplexed assay technology at the gene, protein, and cellular level have enabled the identification of 'actionable biomarkers'; that is, biological metrics that can inform clinical practice. Not only will such biomarkers yield insight into the development, remission, and exacerbation of a disease, they will undoubtedly improve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of classification, and ultimately guide treatment. This Review provides an introduction to these powerful technologies that could promote the identification of actionable biomarkers, including mass cytometry, protein arrays, and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor high-throughput sequencing. In our opinion, these technologies should become part of routine clinical practice for the management of autoimmune diseases. The use of analytical tools to deconvolve the data obtained from use of these technologies is also presented here. These analyses are revealing a more comprehensive and interconnected view of the immune system than ever before and should have an important role in directing future treatment approaches for autoimmune diseases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/nrrheum.2012.66\n\nView details for PubMedID 22647780\n\nAbstract\n\nThe immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a growth factor for a wide range of leukocytes, including T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Considerable effort has been invested in using IL-2 as a therapeutic agent for a variety of immune disorders ranging from AIDS to cancer. However, adverse effects have limited its use in the clinic. On activated T cells, IL-2 signals through a quaternary 'high affinity' receptor complex consisting of IL-2, IL-2Rα (termed CD25), IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ. Naive T cells express only a low density of IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, and are therefore relatively insensitive to IL-2, but acquire sensitivity after CD25 expression, which captures the cytokine and presents it to IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ. Here, using in vitro evolution, we eliminated the functional requirement of IL-2 for CD25 expression by engineering an IL-2 'superkine' (also called super-2) with increased binding affinity for IL-2Rβ. Crystal structures of the IL-2 superkine in free and receptor-bound forms showed that the evolved mutations are principally in the core of the cytokine, and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the evolved mutations stabilized IL-2, reducing the flexibility of a helix in the IL-2Rβ binding site, into an optimized receptor-binding conformation resembling that when bound to CD25. The evolved mutations in the IL-2 superkine recapitulated the functional role of CD25 by eliciting potent phosphorylation of STAT5 and vigorous proliferation of T cells irrespective of CD25 expression. Compared to IL-2, the IL-2 superkine induced superior expansion of cytotoxic T cells, leading to improved antitumour responses in vivo, and elicited proportionally less expansion of T regulatory cells and reduced pulmonary oedema. Collectively, we show that in vitro evolution has mimicked the functional role of CD25 in enhancing IL-2 potency and regulating target cell specificity, which has implications for immunotherapy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/nature10975\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000303200400054\n\nView details for PubMedID 22446627\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3338870\n\nAbstract\n\nThe therapeutic benefit of the small heat shock protein αB-crystallin (HspB5) in animal models of multiple sclerosis and ischemia is proposed to arise from its increased capacity to bind proinflammatory proteins at the elevated temperatures within inflammatory foci. By mass spectral analysis, a common set of ∼70 ligands was precipitated by HspB5 from plasma from patients with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyloidosis and mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These proteins were distinguished from other precipitated molecules because they were enriched in the precipitate as compared with their plasma concentrations, and they exhibited temperature-dependent binding. More than half of these ligands were acute phase proteins or members of the complement or coagulation cascades. Consistent with this proposal, plasma levels of HspB5 were increased in patients with multiple sclerosis as compared with normal individuals. The combination of the thermal sensitivity of the HspB5 combined with the high local concentration of these ligands at the site of inflammation is proposed to explain the paradox of how a protein believed to exhibit nonspecific binding can bind with some relative apparent selectivity to proinflammatory proteins and thereby modulate inflammation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1074/jbc.M111.337691\n\nView details for PubMedID 22308023\n\nAbstract\n\nGlutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is a major target of the autoimmune response that occurs in type 1 diabetes mellitus. In animal models of autoimmunity, treatment with a target antigen can modulate aggressive autoimmunity. We aimed to assess whether immunisation with GAD formulated with aluminum hydroxide (GAD-alum) would preserve insulin production in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.Patients aged 3-45 years who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for less than 100 days were enrolled from 15 sites in the USA and Canada, and randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: three injections of 20 μg GAD-alum, two injections of 20 μg GAD-alum and one of alum, or 3 injections of alum. Injections were given subcutaneously at baseline, 4 weeks later, and 8 weeks after the second injection. The randomisation sequence was computer generated at the TrialNet coordinating centre. Patients and study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the baseline-adjusted geometric mean area under the curve (AUC) of serum C-peptide during the first 2 h of a 4-h mixed meal tolerance test at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included changes in glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and insulin dose, and safety. Analysis included all randomised patients with known measurements. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00529399.145 patients were enrolled and treated with GAD-alum (n=48), GAD-alum plus alum (n=49), or alum (n=48). At 1 year, the 2-h AUC of C-peptide, adjusted for age, sex, and baseline C-peptide value, was 0·412 nmol/L (95% CI 0·349-0·478) in the GAD-alum group, 0·382 nmol/L (0·322-0·446) in the GAD-alum plus alum group, and 0·413 nmol/L (0·351-0·477) in the alum group. The ratio of the population mean of the adjusted geometric mean 2-h AUC of C-peptide was 0·998 (95% CI 0·779-1·22; p=0·98) for GAD-alum versus alum, and 0·926 (0·720-1·13; p=0·50) for GAD-alum plus alum versus alum. HbA(1c), insulin use, and the occurrence and severity of adverse events did not differ between groups.Antigen-based immunotherapy therapy with two or three doses of subcutaneous GAD-alum across 4-12 weeks does not alter the course of loss of insulin secretion during 1 year in patients with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes. Although antigen-based therapy is a highly desirable treatment and is effective in animal models, translation to human autoimmune disease remains a challenge.US National Institutes of Health.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60895-7\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000293615800029\n\nView details for PubMedID 21714999\n\nAbstract\n\nThe immunopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with T-cell autoimmunity. To be fully active, immune T cells need a co-stimulatory signal in addition to the main antigen-driven signal. Abatacept modulates co-stimulation and prevents full T-cell activation. We evaluated the effect of abatacept in recent-onset type 1 diabetes.In this multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, patients aged 6-45 years recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive abatacept (10 mg/kg, maximum 1000 mg per dose) or placebo infusions intravenously on days 1, 14, 28, and monthly for a total of 27 infusions over 2 years. Computer-generated permuted block randomisation was used, with a block size of 3 and stratified by participating site. Neither patients nor research personnel were aware of treatment assignments. The primary outcome was baseline-adjusted geometric mean 2-h area-under-the-curve (AUC) serum C-peptide concentration after a mixed-meal tolerance test at 2 years' follow-up. Analysis was by intention to treat for all patients for whom data were available. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00505375.112 patients were assigned to treatment groups (77 abatacept, 35 placebo). Adjusted C-peptide AUC was 59% (95% CI 6·1-112) higher at 2 years with abatacept (n=73, 0·378 nmol/L) than with placebo (n=30, 0·238 nmol/L; p=0·0029). The difference between groups was present throughout the trial, with an estimated 9·6 months' delay (95% CI 3·47-15·6) in C-peptide reduction with abatacept. There were few infusion-related adverse events (36 reactions occurred in 17 [22%] patients on abatacept and 11 reactions in six [17%] on placebo). There was no increase in infections (32 [42%] patients on abatacept vs 15 [43%] on placebo) or neutropenia (seven [9%] vs five [14%]).Co-stimulation modulation with abatacept slowed reduction in β-cell function over 2 years. The beneficial effect suggests that T-cell activation still occurs around the time of clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Yet, despite continued administration of abatacept over 24 months, the decrease in β-cell function with abatacept was parallel to that with placebo after 6 months of treatment, causing us to speculate that T-cell activation lessens with time. Further observation will establish whether the beneficial effect continues after cessation of abatacept infusions.US National Institutes of Health.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60886-6\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000293615900032\n\nView details for PubMedID 21719096\n\nAbstract\n\nDengue virus infection is a public health threat to hundreds of millions of individuals in the tropical regions of the globe. Although Dengue infection usually manifests itself in its mildest, though often debilitating clinical form, dengue fever, life-threatening complications commonly arise in the form of hemorrhagic shock and encephalitis. The etiological basis for the virus-induced pathology in general, and the different clinical manifestations in particular, are not well understood. We reasoned that a detailed knowledge of the global biological processes affected by virus entry into a cell might help shed new light on this long-standing problem.A bacterial two-hybrid screen using DENV2 structural proteins as bait was performed, and the results were used to feed a manually curated, global dengue-human protein interaction network. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment, along with network topology and microarray meta-analysis, were used to generate hypothesis regarding dengue disease biology.Combining bioinformatic tools with two-hybrid technology, we screened human cDNA libraries to catalogue proteins physically interacting with the DENV2 virus structural proteins, Env, cap and PrM. We identified 31 interacting human proteins representing distinct biological processes that are closely related to the major clinical diagnostic feature of dengue infection: haemostatic imbalance. In addition, we found dengue-binding human proteins involved with additional key aspects, previously described as fundamental for virus entry into cells and the innate immune response to infection. Construction of a DENV2-human global protein interaction network revealed interesting biological properties suggested by simple network topology analysis.Our experimental strategy revealed that dengue structural proteins interact with human protein targets involved in the maintenance of blood coagulation and innate anti-viral response processes, and predicts that the interaction of dengue proteins with a proposed human protein interaction network produces a modified biological outcome that may be behind the hallmark pathologies of dengue infection.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/1471-2334-11-34\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000287239500001\n\nView details for PubMedID 21281507\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3037883\n\nAbstract\n\nBone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) are cells of the immune system that have been used as a tool to boost, modulate, or dampen immune responses. In the context of autoimmunity, DCs can be modified to express immunoregulatory products encoded by transgenes, and used therapeutically in adoptive cellular therapy. DCs that were lentivirally transduced (lt) to express interleukin 4 (IL-4) can significantly delay or prevent the onset of autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. However, modifying cells using viral vectors carries the dual risk of oncogenicity or immunogenicity. This study demonstrates that NOD DCs, electroporated with \"translationally enhanced\" IL-4 mRNA (eDC/IL-4), can be equally efficient therapeutically, despite the reduced amount and shorter duration of IL-4 secretion. Moreover, a single injection of eDC/IL-4 in NOD mice shortly after the onset of hyperglycemia was able to maintain stable glycemia for up to several months in a significant fraction of treated mice. Treatment with eDC/IL-4 boosted regulatory T (Tregs) cell functions and modulated T helper responses to reduce pathogenicity. Thus, treatment with DCs, electroporated with modified IL-4 mRNA to express IL-4 for up to 24 hours, constitutes a viable cellular therapy approach for the regulation of autoimmune diabetes, as a preferred alternative to the use of viral vectors.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/mt.2010.146\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000284828000012\n\nView details for PubMedID 20628358\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC2997578\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article will review new technologies used to characterize the immune phenotype of cells and serum for potential use in studies of autoimmunity.One area of recent development in studies of immune phenotyping is the contrast between cells of the immune system at rest and following activation. This simply involves comparing these cells at rest and following ligand-induced activation and measuring signaling system activation (phosphoepitope identification) or intracellular cytokine production or activation-induced gene expression. Preliminary data using these techniques have begun to identify signatures of disease (biomarkers) that are only seen when using these activation-induced assays. One of the most exciting new technologies, cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry, couples a flow cytometer to a mass spectrometer, allowing many more parameters to be analyzed per cell, and without spillover between assay reagents, compared to conventional optical flow cytometry (heavy ions, mass, replaces fluorophore readout). Another new technology to analyze soluble proteins, bead-based immunoassays, can simultaneously measure up to 75 soluble analytes in a multiplexed array. Other technologies provide similar innovations in terms of analytical content, throughput, and miniaturization.We believe that new cellular genomic and protein-based technologies can provide key insights into autoimmune disease pathogenesis, progression, and therapy, and that these assays need to be applied in a systematic way to samples from patients with autoimmune diseases.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/MED.0b013e32833ada91\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000285063800003\n\nView details for PubMedID 20531181\n\nAbstract\n\nUbiquitination of eukaryotic proteins regulates a broad range of cellular processes, including T cell activation and tolerance. We have previously demonstrated that GRAIL (gene related to anergy in lymphocytes), a transmembrane RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase, initially described as induced during the induction of CD4 T cell anergy, is also expressed in resting CD4 T cells. In this study, we show that GRAIL can down-modulate the expression of CD83 (previously described as a cell surface marker for mature dendritic cells) on CD4 T cells. GRAIL-mediated down-modulation of CD83 is dependent on an intact GRAIL extracellular protease-associated domain and an enzymatically active cytosolic RING domain, and proceeds via the ubiquitin-dependent 26S proteosome pathway. Ubiquitin modification of lysine residues K168 and K183, but not K192, in the cytoplasmic domain of CD83 was shown to be necessary for GRAIL-mediated degradation of CD83. Reduced CD83 surface expression levels were seen both on anergized CD4 T cells and following GRAIL expression by retroviral transduction, whereas GRAIL knock-down by RNA interference in CD4 T cells resulted in elevated CD83 levels. Furthermore, CD83 expression on CD4 T cells contributes to T cell activation as a costimulatory molecule. This study supports the novel mechanism of ubiquitination by GRAIL, identifies CD83 as a substrate of GRAIL, and ascribes a role for CD83 in CD4 T cell activation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.4049/jimmunol.0900204\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000275119400048\n\nView details for PubMedID 19542455\n\nAbstract\n\nBecause of their potent immunoregulatory capacity, dendritic cells (DCs) have been exploited as therapeutic tools to boost immune responses against tumors or pathogens, or dampen autoimmune or allergic responses. Murine bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) are the closest known equivalent of the blood monocyte-derived DCs that have been used for human therapy. Current imaging methods have proven unable to properly address the migration of injected DCs to small and deep tissues in mice and humans. This study presents the first extensive analysis of BM-DC homing to lymph nodes (and other selected tissues) after intravenous and intraperitoneal inoculation. After intravenous delivery, DCs accumulated in the spleen, and preferentially in the pancreatic and lung-draining lymph nodes. In contrast, DCs injected intraperitoneally were found predominantly in peritoneal lymph nodes (pancreatic in particular), and in omentum-associated lymphoid tissue. This uneven distribution of BM-DCs, independent of the mouse strain and also observed within pancreatic lymph nodes, resulted in the uneven induction of immune response in different lymphoid tissues. These data have important implications for the design of systemic cellular therapy with DCs, and in particular underlie a previously unsuspected potential for specific treatment of diseases such as autoimmune diabetes and pancreatic cancer.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1182/blood-2009-02-204321\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000267789600024\n\nView details for PubMedID 19363220\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC2710920\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL) is expressed in quiescent naive mouse and human CD4 T cells and has a functional role in inhibiting naive T cell proliferation. Following TCR engagement, CD28 costimulation results in the expression of IL-2 whose signaling through its receptor activates the Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Activation of mTOR allows selective mRNA translation, including the epistatic regulator of GRAIL, Otubain-1 (Otub1), whose expression results in the degradation of GRAIL and allows T cell proliferation. The activation of mTOR appears to be the critical component of IL-2R signaling regulating GRAIL expression. CTLA4-Ig treatment blocks CD28 costimulation and resultant IL-2 expression, whereas rapamycin and anti-IL-2 treatment block mTOR activation downstream of IL-2R signaling. Thus, all three of these biotherapeutics inhibit mTOR-dependent translation of mRNA transcripts, resulting in blockade of Otub1 expression, maintenance of GRAIL, and inhibition of CD4 T cell proliferation. These observations provide a mechanistic pathway sequentially linking CD28 costimulation, IL-2R signaling, and mTOR activation as important requirements for naive CD4 T cell proliferation through the regulation of Otub1 and GRAIL expression. Our findings also extend the role of GRAIL beyond anergy induction and maintenance, suggesting that endogenous GRAIL regulates general cell cycle and proliferation of primary naive CD4 T cells.\n\nView details for DOI 10.4049/jimmunol.0803986\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000265899800008\n\nView details for PubMedID 19414743\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC2853371\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ubiquitin E3 ligase gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL) (Rnf128) is a type 1 transmembrane protein that induces T cell anergy through the ubiquitination activity of its cytosolic RING finger. GRAIL also contains an equally large luminal region consisting primarily of an uncharacterized protease-associated (PA) domain. Using two-hybrid technology to screen for proteins that bound the PA domain we identified CD151, a member of the tetraspanin family of membrane proteins. GRAIL bound to the luminal/extracellular portion of both CD151 and the related tetraspanin CD81 using its PA domain, which promoted ubiquitination of cytosolic lysine residues. GRAIL exhibited specificity for lysines only within the tetraspanin amino terminus even in the presence of other cytosolic lysine residues in the substrate. GRAIL-mediated ubiquitination promoted proteasomal degradation and cell surface down-regulation of tetraspanins via Lys-48 linkages. As a result, the juxtaposition of PA and RING finger domains across a lipid bilayer facilitates the capture of transmembrane substrates for subsequent ubiquitination. These findings identify for the first time a single subunit E3 ligase containing a substrate-binding domain spatially restricted by a membrane from its E2 recruitment domain as well as an E3 ligase for members of the tetraspanin family.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1074/jbc.M805092200\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000259969300052\n\nView details for PubMedID 18713730\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC2568916\n\nAbstract\n\nA deficit in IL-4 production has been previously reported in both diabetic human patients and non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. In addition, re-introducing IL-4 into NOD mice systemically, or as a transgene, led to a beneficial outcome in most studies. Here, we show that prediabetic, 12-week old female NOD mice have a deficit in IL-4 expression in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) compared to age-matched diabetes-resistant NOD.B10 mice. By bioluminescence imaging, we demonstrated that the PLN was preferentially targeted by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) following intravenous (IV) administration. Following IV injection of DCs transduced to express IL-4 (DC/IL-4) into 12-week old NOD mice, it was possible to significantly delay or prevent the onset of hyperglycemia. We then focused on the PLN to monitor, by microarray analysis, changes in gene expression induced by DC/IL-4 and observed a rapid normalization of the expression of many genes, that were otherwise under-expressed compared to NOD.B10 PLN. The protective effect of DC/IL-4 required both MHC and IL-4 expression by the DCs. Thus, adoptive cellular therapy, using DCs modified to express IL-4, offers an effective, tissue-targeted cellular therapy to prevent diabetes in NOD mice at an advanced stage of pre-diabetes, and may offer a safe approach to consider for treatment of high risk human pre-diabetic patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.clim.2007.12.009\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000255231100010\n\nView details for PubMedID 18337172\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC2453076\n\nAbstract\n\nThe goal of this study was to compare the ability of donor naive and alloantigen-primed effector memory T cells to induce graft-vs-host disease after bone marrow transplantation in MHC-mismatched irradiated host mice. Purified CD4(+) naive (CD62L(high)CD44(low)) T cells and CD4(+) effector memory (CD62L(low)CD44(high)) T cells obtained from unprimed donors and donors primed to host alloantigens, respectively, were injected into host mice, and the rapidity, severity, and pattern of tissue injury of graft-vs-host disease was assessed. Unexpectedly, the naive T cells induced a more acute and severe colitis than the primed memory cells. Whereas the naive T cells expressing CD62L and CCR7 lymph node homing receptors vigorously expanded in mesenteric lymph nodes and colon by day 6 after transplantation, the primed memory T cells without these receptors had 20- to 100-fold lower accumulation at this early time point. These differences were reflected in the significantly more rapid decline in survival and weight loss induced by naive T cells. The primed memory T cells had a greater capacity to induce chronic colitis and liver injury and secrete IL-2 and IFN-gamma in response to alloantigenic stimulation compared with memory T cells from unprimed donors. Nevertheless, the expected increase in potency as compared with naive T cells was not observed due to differences in the pattern and kinetics of tissue injury.\n\nView details for PubMedID 17982043\n\nAbstract\n\nAppropriate targeting of therapeutic cells is essential in adoptive cellular gene therapy (ACGT). Imaging cell trafficking in animal models and patients will guide development of ACGT protocols. Collagen type II (C-II)-specific T cell hybridomas are transduced with a lentivirus carrying a triple fusion reporter gene (TFR) construct consisting of a fluorescent reporter gene (RG), a bioluminescent RG (hRluc), and a positron emission tomography (PET) RG. Collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) mice are scanned with a bioluminescence imaging camera before and after implantation of various known cell quantities in their paws. Linear regression analysis yields equations relating two parameters of image signal intensity in mice paws to the quantity of hRluc expressing cells in the paws. Afterward, trafficking of intravenously injected cells is studied by quantitative analysis of bioluminescence images. Comparison of the average cell numbers does not demonstrate consistently higher accumulation of T-cell hybridomas in the paws with higher inflammation scores, and injecting more cells does not cause increased accumulation. MicroPET images illustrate above background signal in the inflamed paws and chest areas of CIA mice. The procedures described in this study can be used to derive equations for cells expressing other bioluminescent RGs and in other animal models.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1117/1.2821415\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000252851100046\n\nView details for PubMedID 18163841\n\nAbstract\n\nProgressive destruction of articular cartilage and bone is the pivotal problem of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Joint destruction is the cause of severe disability and determines the long-term outcome of disease. Conventional therapy does not control this destructive process sufficiently and the anti-rheumatic drugs available today can cause severe systemic adverse effects. Local application of chondroprotective and osteoprotective agents by means of gene therapy would be an attractive alternative to conventional therapy of RA and could provide long-term expression of the therapeutic agents and minimize systemic adverse effects. For this purpose, we have developed the concept of adoptive cellular gene therapy. This treatment strategy is based on using genetically engineered cells that home specifically to sites of autoimmune inflammation and thus allow local delivery of therapeutic gene products. Ex vivo transduction of these cells avoids systemic exposure of the host to the transgene-encoding vector and thus adds to the safety of this approach. In this article of the CIS Spring School in Autoimmune Diseases 2005 proceedings, we review our work on developing the strategy of adoptive cellular gene therapy and summarize recent advances in the evaluation of therapeutic effects and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.autrev.2005.09.009\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000235349400018\n\nView details for PubMedID 16431349\n\nAbstract\n\nThe homing receptors L-selectin and alpha4beta7 integrin facilitate entry of T cells into the gut-associated organized lymphoid tissues such as the mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer patches. We studied the impact of inactivation of genes encoding these receptors on the ability of purified donor CD4+ T cells to induce acute lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) associated with severe colitis in irradiated major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched mice. Whereas lack of expression of a single receptor had no significant impact on the severity of colitis and GVHD, the lack of expression of both receptors markedly ameliorated colitis and early deaths observed with wild-type (WT) T cells. The changes in colitis and GVHD were reflected in a marked reduction in the early accumulation of donor T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes and subsequently in the colon. The purified WT donor CD4+ T cells did not accumulate early in the Peyer patches and failed to induce acute injury to the small intestine. In conclusion, the combination of CD62L and beta7 integrin is required to induce acute colitis and facilitate entry of CD4+ donor T cells in the mesenteric nodes associated with lethal GVHD in allogeneic hosts.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2339\n\nView details for PubMedID 16105972\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough systemic administration of neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies has been used successfully in treating rheumatoid arthritis, there is a potential for side effects. We transduced a collagen reactive T-cell hybridoma with tissue-specific homing properties to assess therapeutic effects of local delivery to inflamed joints of anti-TNF single-chain antibodies (scFv) by adoptive cellular gene therapy. Cell culture medium conditioned with 1 x 10(6) scFv producer cells/ml had TNF neutralizing capacity in vitro equivalent to 50 ng/ml anti-TNF monoclonal antibody. Adding a kappa chain constant domain to the basic scFv (construct TN3-Ckappa) gave increased in vitro stability and in vivo therapeutic effect. TN3-Ckappa blocked development of collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1LacJ mice for >60 days. Transgene expression was detected in the paws but not the spleen of treated animals for up to 55 days postinjection. No significant variations in cell proliferation or cytokine secretion were found in splenocytes or peripheral lymphocytes. IL-6 expression was blocked in the diseased paws of mice in the scFv treatment groups compared to controls. In conclusion, we have shown that local expression of an anti-inflammatory agent blocks disease development without causing demonstrable systemic immune function changes. This is encouraging for the potential development of safe adoptive cellular therapies to treat autoimmunity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/sj.gt.3301980\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000184207000007\n\nView details for PubMedID 12858190\n\nAbstract\n\nFor many decades, anergy has been used as a descriptive term to describe a state of antigen-specific unresponsiveness. A better understanding of this phenotype was revealed in the 1980s using in vitro model systems. These model systems demonstrated that protein synthesis and mobilization of Ca2+ was required leading to the pursuit of a novel gene(s) that would be unique to the anergy phenotype. Several putative \"anergy factors\" have been suggested. In this review, we provide an overview of the anergy phenotype and proposed anergy-related genes. To date, no single gene has been described that would completely fulfill the criteria of an \"anergy factor.\" We review work from our laboratory describing a novel gene that we have termed Gene Related to Anergy In Lymphocytes (GRAIL) that is upregulated in T cells anergized in vitro and in vivo and, following transduction into T cells, reiterates the anergy phenotype.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000187357900007\n\nView details for PubMedID 14713718\n\nAbstract\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune arthritis, for which treatment options remain limited. This study investigated the potential role of adoptive cellular gene therapy as a novel means for treating the RA animal model collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T-cell hybridomas retrovirally transduced to express IL-4 1 day before booster immunization significantly reduced the number of inflamed joints. Cell transfer after clinical onset of disease had no therapeutic effect. Bioluminescence imaging showed that the hybridomas migrated to the inflamed joints, thus delivering the regulatory protein locally at the site of inflammation. The homing was, at least in part, due to chemotaxis in response to proinflammatory chemokines that are expressed in inflamed joints. There were no significant changes in the cytokine milieu of the draining lymph nodes, nor in the systemic levels of anti-collagen antibodies in treated mice. We conclude that the beneficial clinical effects observed in our model were most likely based on the local action(s) of IL-4 in the inflamed joints and that the local delivery (and effects) of regulatory cytokines, like IL-4, constitutes a novel and effective method of preventing organ-specific autoimmune disease and of minimizing systemic adverse effects.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1006/clim.2002.5299\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000180187600008\n\nView details for PubMedID 12498812\n\nAbstract\n\nWe previously described a mechanism for the maintenance of peripheral self-tolerance. This involves the cross-presentation of tissue-associated antigens by a bone marrow-derived cell type that stimulates the proliferation and ultimate deletion of self-reactive CD8 T cells. This process has been referred to as cross-tolerance. Here, we characterize the elusive cell type responsible for inducing cross-tolerance as a CD8alpha(+) dendritic cell (DC). To achieve this aim, transgenic mice were generated expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) linked to CTL epitopes for ovalbumin and glycoprotein B (gB) of herpes simplex virus under the rat insulin promoter (RIP). Although tracking of YFP was inconclusive, the use of a highly sensitive gB-specific hybridoma that produced beta-galactosidase on encounter with antigen, enabled detection of antigen presentation by cells isolated from the pancreatic lymph node. This showed that a CD11c(+)CD8alpha(+) cell was responsible for cross-tolerance, the same DC subset as previously implicated in cross-priming. These data indicate that CD8alpha(+) DCs play a critical role in both tolerance and immunity to cell-associated antigens, providing a potential mechanism by which cytotoxic T lymphocyte can be immunized to viral antigens while maintaining tolerance to self.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1084/jem.20020861\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000178893100011\n\nView details for PubMedID 12391021\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC2194045\n\nAbstract\n\nT(H)2 cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of asthma, but the precise immunologic mechanisms that inhibit T(H)2 cell function in vivo are not well understood.The purpose of our studies was to determine whether T cells producing IL-10 regulate the development of asthma.We used gene therapy to generate ovalbumin-specific CD4 T-helper cells to express IL-10, and we examined their capacity to regulate allergen-induced airway hyperreactivity.We demonstrated that the CD4 T-helper cells engineered to express IL-10 abolished airway hyperreactivity and airway eosinophilia in BALB/c mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin and in SCID mice reconstituted with ovalbumin-specific T(H)2 effector cells. The inhibitory effect of the IL-10-secreting T-helper cells was accompanied by the presence of increased quantities of IL-10 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, was antigen-specific, and was reversed by neutralization of IL-10. Moreover, neutralization of IL-10 by administration of anti-IL-10 mAb in mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin seriously exacerbated airway hyperreactivity and airway inflammation.Our results demonstrate that T cells secreting IL-10 in the respiratory mucosa can indeed regulate T(H)2-induced airway hyperreactivity and inflammation, and they strongly suggest that IL-10 plays an important inhibitory role in allergic asthma.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1067/mai.2002.127512\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000177936900018\n\nView details for PubMedID 12209095\n\nAbstract\n\nAcute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is still a major obstacle in clinical allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation. CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (T(reg)) cells have recently been shown to suppress proliferative responses of CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells to alloantigenic stimulation in vitro and are required for ex vivo tolerization of donor T cells, which results in their reduced potential to induce aGVHD. Here we show that CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells isolated from the spleen or BM of donor C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) mice that have not been tolerized are still potent inhibitors of the alloresponse in vitro and of lethal aGVHD induced by C57BL/6 CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells in irradiated BALB/c (H-2(d)) hosts in vivo. The addition of the CD4(+)CD25(+) T(reg) cells at a 1:1 ratio with responder/inducer CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells resulted in a >90% inhibition of the mixed leukocyte reaction and marked protection from lethal GVHD. This protective effect depended in part on the ability of the transferred CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells to secrete interleukin 10 and occurred if the T(reg) cells were of donor, but not host, origin. Our results demonstrate that the balance of donor-type CD4(+)CD25(+) T(reg) and conventional CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells can determine the outcome of aGVHD.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1084/jem.20020399\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000177658200011\n\nView details for PubMedID 12163567\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC2193938\n\nAbstract\n\nLymphocytes are highly mobile cells that travel throughout the body in response to a tremendous variety of stimuli. Revealing lymphocyte trafficking patterns in vivo is necessary for a complete understanding of immune function, as well as cell-cell and cell-tissue interactions in immune development and in response to insult. Although the location of cell populations in various tissues at any given point in time may be revealed by techniques such as flow cytometry and immunofluorescence, these methods are not readily amenable to the assessment of dynamic cell migration patterns in vivo. In the past 5 years, technologies for imaging molecular and cellular changes in living animals have advanced to a point where it is possible to reveal the migratory paths of these vitally important cells. Here, we review one advancement in cellular imaging, in vivo bioluminescence imaging, which addresses the problem of lymphocyte tracking. This imaging strategy has the potential to elucidate the temporal patterns of immune responses and the spatial distribution of lymphocytes within the body.\n\nView details for PubMedID 11750093\n\nAbstract\n\nT cell anergy is characterized by the inability of the T cell to produce IL-2 and proliferate. It is reversible by the addition of exogenous IL-2. A similar state of unresponsiveness is observed when the proliferative response of murine CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells is suppressed in vitro by coactivated CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. We have developed a suppression system that uses beads coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs as surrogate APCs to study the interaction of CD4(+)CD25(+) and CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells in vitro. CD4(+)CD25(+) T cell-induced suppression, in this model, was not abrogated by blocking the B7-CTLA-4 pathway. When the CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells were separated from the CD4(+)CD25(+) suppressor cells after 24 h of coactivation by the Ab-coated beads, the CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells were unable to proliferate or to produce IL-2 upon restimulation. The induction of this anergic phenotype in the CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells correlated with the up-regulated expression of the gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL), a novel anergy-related gene that acts as a negative regulator of IL-2 transcription. This system constitutes a novel mechanism of anergy induction in the presence of costimulation.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000171858300018\n\nView details for PubMedID 11591749\n\nAbstract\n\nCD4+ T cells are believed to play a central role in the initiation and perpetuation of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In the murine model for multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, pathogenic T cells exhibit a Th1-like phenotype characterized by heightened expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Systemic administration of \"regulatory\" cytokines, which serve to counter Th1 effects, has been shown to ameliorate autoimmune responses. However, the inherent problems of nonspecific toxicity limit the usefulness of systemic cytokine delivery as a potential therapy. Therefore, we used the site-specific trafficking properties of autoantigen-reactive CD4+ T cells to develop an adoptive immunotherapy protocol that provided local delivery of a Th1 cytokine antagonist, the p40 subunit of IL-12. In vitro analysis demonstrated that IL-12 p40 suppressed IFN-gamma production in developing and effector Th1 populations, indicating its potential to modulate Th1-promoted inflammation. We have previously demonstrated that transduction of myelin basic protein-specific CD4+ T cells with pGC retroviral vectors can result in efficient and stable transgene expression. Therefore, we adoptively transferred myelin basic protein-specific CD4+ T cells transduced to express IL-12 p40 into mice immunized to develop experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and demonstrated a significant reduction in clinical disease. In vivo tracking of bioluminescent lymphocytes, transduced to express luciferase, using low-light imaging cameras demonstrated that transduced CD4+ T cells trafficked to the central nervous system, where histological analysis confirmed long-term transgene expression. These studies have demonstrated that retrovirally transduced autoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells inhibited inflammation and promoted immunotherapy of autoimmune disorders.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000170949600070\n\nView details for PubMedID 11490028\n\nAbstract\n\nAutoantigen-specific T cells have tissue-specific homing properties, suggesting that these cells may be ideal vehicles for the local delivery of immunoregulatory molecules. We tested this hypothesis by using type II collagen-specific (CII-specific) CD4(+) T hybridomas or primary CD4(+) T cells after gene transfer, as vehicles to deliver an immunoregulatory protein for the treatment of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CII-specific T cells or hybridomas were transduced using retroviral vectors to constitutively express the IL-12 antagonist, IL-12 p40. Transfer of engineered CD4(+) T cells after immunization significantly inhibited the development of CIA, while cells transduced with vector control had no effect. The beneficial effect on CIA of IL-12 p40-transduced T cells required TCR specificity against CII, since transfer of T cells specific for another antigen producing equivalent amounts of IL-12 p40 had no effect. In vivo cell detection using bioluminescent labels and RT-PCR showed that transferred CII-reactive T-cell hybridomas accumulated in inflamed joints in mice with CIA. These results indicate that the local delivery of IL-12 p40 by T cells inhibited CIA by suppressing autoimmune responses at the site of inflammation. Modifying antigen-specific T cells by retroviral transduction for local expression of immunoregulatory proteins thus offers a promising strategy for treating RA.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000168867400014\n\nView details for PubMedID 11375419\n\nAbstract\n\nWe recently discovered that short polymers of arginine efficiently translocate across the cytoplasmic membrane independent of the basic amino acid transporter. We evaluated the kinetics and biological effects of heptamers of L-arginine and D-arginine (L-R7 and D-R7, respectively) in vascular cells. We assessed the effects of these peptides on the NO synthesis pathway and vascular cell proliferation.Human umbilical vein endothelial cell and rabbit vascular segments were incubated in medium containing biotin-labeled L-R7 or D-R7. Both polymers rapidly translocated through the vessel wall and into the vascular cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. At a dose of 10 micromol/L for 30 minutes, 100% of the endothelial cells showed evidence of cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of the peptides. To evaluate the biological effects of the polymer translocation on myointimal formation, rabbit jugular vein segments were incubated with polymers (10 micromol/L, 30 minutes) or vehicle before arterial interposition grafting. Planimetric measurement 28 days after surgery revealed that L-R7 and D-R7 substantially reduced myointimal formation compared with the control condition (intima/media ratio: control 1. 50.5, L-R7 0.40.2, and D-R7 0.80.2; P:<0.05). Furthermore, basal nitrate and nitrite production from L-R7-treated grafts was significantly higher than that from both control and D-R7-treated veins. Studies in vitro of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells revealed that both polymers also exhibit an NO-independent inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.Short polymers of arginine have the unique ability of vascular cell translocation, and they also have direct biological effects. These attributes are potentially useful in treating myointimal hyperplasia.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000165405800013\n\nView details for PubMedID 11085967\n\nAbstract\n\nHomopolymers or peptides containing a high percentage of cationic amino acids have been shown to have a unique ability to cross the plasma membrane of cells, and consequently have been used to facilitate the uptake of a variety of biopolymers and small molecules. To investigate whether the polycationic character of these molecules, or some other structural feature, was the molecular basis for the effect, the ability of a variety of homopolymers to enter cells was assayed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Polymers of L- or D-arginine containing six or more amino acids entered cells far more effectively than polymers of equal length composed of lysine, ornithine and histidine. Peptides of fewer than six amino acids were ineffective. The length of the arginine side-chain could be varied without significant loss of activity. These data combined with the inability of polymers of citrulline to enter cells demonstrated that the guanidine headgroup of arginine was the critical structural component responsible for the biological activity. Cellular uptake could be inhibited by preincubation of the cells with sodium azide, but not by low temperature (3 degrees C), indicating that the process was energy dependent, but did not involve endocytosis.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000165173900006\n\nView details for PubMedID 11095185\n\nAbstract\n\nCD4+ T cells are important mediators in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and would therefore provide ideal candidates for lymphocyte-based gene therapy. However, the number of Ag-specific T cells in any single lesion of autoimmunity may be quite low. Successful gene transfer into autoantigen-specific CD4+ T cells would serve as an ideal vehicle for site-targeted gene therapy if it were possible to transduce preferentially the small number of autoantigen-specific T cells. In this study we have demonstrated that retroviral infection of CD4+ lymphocytes from either autoantigen-stimulated TCR transgenic mice, or Ag-activated immunized nontransgenic mice, with a retroviral vector (pGCIRES), resulted in the transduction of only the limited number of Ag-reactive CD4+ T cells. In contrast, polyclonal activation of the same cultures resulted in transduction of non-antigen-specific lymphocytes. Transduction of Ag-reactive CD4+ T cells with pGCIRES retrovirus encoding the regulatory genes IL-4 (IL4) and soluble TNF receptor (STNFR) resulted in stable integration and long-term expression of recombinant gene products. Moreover, expression of the pGCIRES marker protein, GFP, directly correlated with the expression of the upstream regulatory gene. Retroviral transduction of CD4+ T cells targeted specifically Ag-reactive cells and was cell cycle-dependent and evident only during the mitosis phase. These studies suggest that retroviral transduction of autoantigen-specific murine CD4+ T cells, using the pGCIRES retroviral vector, may provide a potential method to target and isolate the low frequency of autoantigen-specific murine CD4+ T cells, and provides a rational approach to gene therapy in animal models of autoimmunity.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000086020700019\n\nView details for PubMedID 10725713\n\nAbstract\n\nActivated T lymphocytes modulate the level of many molecules on their cell surface, including cytokine receptors. This regulation of cytokine receptor expression affects the ability of T cells to respond to cytokines and thus influences the outcome of an immune response. The receptor for IFN-gamma, a proinflammatory cytokine, consists of two copies of a ligand binding chain (IFN-gammaR1) as well as two copies of a second chain (IFN-gammaR2) required for signal transduction. The expression of IFN-gammaR2 is down-regulated at the mRNA level on CD4+ T cells when they differentiate into the Th1, but not the Th2, phenotype. This down-regulation has been demonstrated to depend on the ligand, IFN-gamma, which is produced by Th1 but not Th2 T cells. The regulation of the cell-surface expression of IFN-gamma receptors during primary T cell activation has not been reported. Naive and differentiated T lymphocytes express IFN-gammaR1 at the mRNA level and as a cell-surface protein. In this study, we present evidence that cell-surface expression of IFN-gammaR1 is transiently down-regulated on the surface of naive CD4+ T cells shortly after TCR engagement. Furthermore, this down-regulation is not mediated by the ligand, IFN-gamma, but results from TCR engagement and can be inhibited by cyclosporin A.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000086020700010\n\nView details for PubMedID 10725704\n\nAbstract\n\nThe low precursor frequency of Ag-reactive CD4+ T cells has been a barrier to the study of CD4+ T cell responses to conventional Ags as well as CD4+ T cell responses to autoantigens recognized during the course of an autoimmune disease. We have recently reported that all \"conventional Ag\" reactive CD4+ T cells are contained within the subpopulation expressing high levels of the CD4 molecule, termed CD4high. We have identified a CD4high population in the islets of Langerhans of prediabetic nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice that is extremely potent in transferring disease. As few as 500 CD4high islet-infiltrating CD4+ T cells transferred insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus to CD8 reconstituted NOD-SCID mice within 30 days of transfer. In contrast, CD4high T cells isolated from either NOD spleen or salivary glands did not transfer insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus into similar CD8-reconstituted NOD-SCID recipients. These data indicate that the precursor frequency of NOD islet-reactive, pathogenic CD4+ T cells is much higher in the prediabetic NOD pancreas than in these other organs. The islet-infiltrating CD4high T cells displayed selected memory markers, by cell surface analysis, and displayed a Th 1 phenotype by RNase protection assay, but had a marked decrease in IL-4 mRNA determined by quantitative real time PCR when compared with the less pathogenic CD4normal islet-infiltrating T cells. Use of the CD4high marker to select Ag activated T cells represents a tool to isolate and study pathogenic CD4+ T cells from autoimmune lesions in which the Ag has not been previously defined.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000083638400067\n\nView details for PubMedID 10553102\n\nAbstract\n\nUsually we rely on vaccination to promote an immune response to a pathogenic microbe. In this study, we demonstrate a suppressive from of vaccination, with DNA encoding a minigene for residues 139-151 of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP139-151), a pathogenic self-Ag. This suppressive vaccination attenuates a prototypic autoimmune disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which presents clinically with paralysis. Proliferative responses and production of the Th1 cytokines, IL-2 and IFN-gamma, were reduced in T cells responsive to PLP139-151. In the brains of mice that were successfully vaccinated, mRNA for IL-2, IL-15, and IFN-gamma were reduced. A mechanism underlying the reduction in severity and incidence of paralytic autoimmune disease and the reduction in Th1 cytokines involves altered costimulation of T cells; loading of APCs with DNA encoding PLP139-151 reduced the capacity of a T cell line reactive to PLP139-151 to proliferate even in the presence of exogenous CD28 costimulation. DNA immunization with the myelin minigene for PLP-altered expression of B7.1 (CD80), and B7.2 (CD86) on APCs in the spleen. Suppressive immunization against self-Ags encoded by DNA may be exploited to treat autoimmune diseases.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000079105000029\n\nView details for PubMedID 10092787\n\nAbstract\n\nThe current paradigm of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and disease association suggests that efficient binding of autoantigens by disease-associated MHC molecules leads to a T cell-mediated immune response and resultant autoimmune sequelae. The data presented below offer a different model for this association of MHC with autoimmune diabetes. We used several mouse lines expressing different levels of I-Ag7 and I-Ak on the nonobese diabetic (NOD) background to evaluate the role of MHC class II in the previously described NOD T cell autoproliferation. The ratio of I-Ag7 to I-Ak expression correlated with the peripheral T cell autoproliferative phenotype in the mice studied. T cells from the NOD, [NOD x NOD. I-Anull]F1, and NOD I-Ak transgenic mice demonstrated autoproliferative responses (after priming with self-peptides), whereas the NOD.H2(h4) (containing I-Ak) congenic and [NOD x NOD. H2(h4) congenic]F1 mice did not. Analysis of CD4(+) NOD I-Ak transgenic primed lymph node cells showed that autoreactive CD4(+) T cells in the NOD I-Ak transgenic mice were restricted exclusively by I-Ag7. Considered in the context of the avidity theory of T cell activation and selection, the reported poor peptide binding capacity of NOD I-Ag7 suggested a new hypothesis to explain the effects of MHC class II expression on the peripheral autoimmune repertoire in NOD mice. This new explanation suggests that the association of MHC with diabetes results from \"altered\" thymic selection in which high affinity self-reactive (potentially autoreactive) T cells escape negative selection. This model offers an explanation for the requirement of homozygous MHC class II expression in NOD mice (and in humans) in susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000077713600008\n\nView details for PubMedID 9858513\n\nAbstract\n\nAutoimmune diseases in humans represent an immune attack on self tissue. Current therapies for almost all autoimmune diseases utilize potent and nonspecific immunosuppressive regimens. These therapies are complicated by their side effects and also place the patient at increased risk for opportunistic infections and malignancies. Our current understanding of immune mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases remains limited. Ongoing studies include identifying genes that predispose an individual to developing autoimmunity, identification of autoantigens that trigger or perpetuate autoimmunity, and studies of immune cell interactions that lead to immune response. Although it may be many years before a full understanding of autoimmunity is obtained, treatment in animal models of autoimmune disease and some human clinical trials have begun to study alternative treatment approaches to therapy of autoimmune disease. Future therapies for autoimmune diseases should target the inappropriate autoimmune response. This article will describe the use of gene therapy in the treatment of autoimmune disease. We believe that autoimmunity can be ameliorated by delivering trans-acting immunoregulatory molecules by retrovirally transduced autoantigen specific T cells that home to lesions of autoimmunity. Until recently, there has not been a practical alternative to systemic delivery of immunoregulatory molecules, however systemic delivery suffers from toxic side effects and dangerous global immunosuppression. In order to study immune regulation using retroviral transduction for local delivery of immunoregulatory products, we used myelin basic protein (MBP) reactive T cell hybridomas in the murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this report, we show that MBP reactive T cell hybridomas transduced to express IL-4 or TNF, ameliorated or exacerbated disease, respectively. Additionally, the effects of these cells were dependent on T cell receptor (TCR) expression, indicating that the effects were due to homing of the T cells and the local delivery of cytokines. We believe that gene therapy, allowing local delivery of immunoregulatory proteins by autoantigen specific T cells, represents an interesting potential therapy for autoimmune disease.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000076885900015\n\nView details for PubMedID 9831193\n\nAbstract\n\nInducible gene expression is primarily regulated at the level of transcription. Additional steps of \"processing\" pre-mRNA, involved in the regulation of induced gene expression, have not been previously reported. Here we report a novel mechanism of \"activation-induced splicing\" of preexisting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) message (pre-mRNA) in naive T lymphocytes after engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR), which still occurs after inhibition of transcription. Expression of TNF has been previously demonstrated to be regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels. However, neither the large pool of TNF mRNA observed in activated T cells nor TNF protein production, which peaks very shortly after activation, can be solely attributed to increased transcription. Evidence is presented that activation-induced splicing of TNF pre-mRNA plays a significant role in the rapid production of TNF seen in activated T cells. Activation triggers processing of TNF pre-mRNA that has accumulated in naive T cells (before activation-induced transcription), and the mature TNF mRNA is translocated to the cytoplasm for rapid translation and protein production. This novel form of activation-induced splicing of TNF may allow T cells to mount an immediate response to activation stimuli under physiological conditions.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000075236900003\n\nView details for PubMedID 9670037\n\nAbstract\n\nIn these experiments, we studied the role of anti-CD4 (Ox38) monoclonal antibody in the induction of allograft unresponsiveness in high-responder Lewis rats in the single liver, kidney, small bowel, and heart versus the combined heart-kidney, heart-liver, and heart-small bowel transplantation models.ACI heart, kidney, liver, and small bowel allografts were transplanted into untreated and anti-CD4 treated Lewis rats. In selected animals bearing long-surviving ACI liver or kidney allografts for over 3 months, donor-matched second heart or third-party (Brown Norway) heart allografts were transplanted. Simultaneously, heart-liver, heart-kidney, and heart-small bowel transplants were performed on the day of operation. Rejected allografts were verified by autopsy and pathology.ACI liver allografts were permanently accepted by Lewis recipients treated with either regular-dose (5 mg/kg for 4 days) or low-dose (5 mg/kg for 2 days) of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody. Pretransplant anti-CD4 therapy (5 mg/kg for 4 days but not 5 mg/kg for 2 days) resulted in a long-term survival of kidney allografts (mean survival time [MST] > 100.0 days, n=5). Pretransplant anti-CD4 treatment (5 mg/kg for 4 days) could not induce tolerance when single ACI hearts were transplanted; however, long-term survival of ACI heart allografts could be induced when heart transplants were combined with liver (n=7) or kidney (n=8) transplants. The survival of both ACI heart allografts (MST=25.0 day"
