        "text": "The Tanegashima Space Center (TNSC), is the largest rocket-launch complex in Japan with a total area of about 9,700,000 square meters. Located in the south of Kagoshima Prefecture, along the southeast coast of Tanegashima, it is known as the most beautiful rocket-launch complex in the world.\n\nOn-site facilities include the Yoshinobu Launch Complex, a launch site for large-size rockets, Spacecraft Test and Assembly Buildings, and the Spacecraft and Fairing Assembly Building. Using those facilities, a series of operations are performed from assembling launch vehicles, maintenance, inspections, final checks of satellites, loading satellites onto launch vehicles, launches, and tracking launch vehicles after liftoff. The TNSC plays a pivotal role for satellite launches among Japanâ€™s space development activities.\n\nJAXA invites the public to visit our cutting edge R&D space facility to help understand our past, present and future programs and challenges. Exhibition locations in the center are categorized according to programs such as launch vehicles and space environment utilization. You can feel and touch the actual space R&D environment, including a life-size launch vehicle mock-up.\n\nThe Bus Tour can take you the launch-related facilities in the Tanegashima Space Center with explanations by the guide. We have the tours three times a day (twice a day from December to February). The tour is closed on the same day as the Museum.\n\nAdvance reservation is required and accepted from 3 months before the tour date. For reservations, please use the Space Museum Contact Form or call(+81-997-26-9244). Participation fee is free.\n\nPlease note that the course may be changed or canceled depending on the weather, launch and test schedules, etc."
