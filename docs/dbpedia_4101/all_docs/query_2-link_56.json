        "text": "A greenhouse for growing Muscat in Tsutaka, Kita Ward, Okayama Prefecture. For the cultivation of Muscat, a temperature of approximately 20 °C and a substantial amount of ultraviolet light are desirable elements. Therefore, reflecting the ultraviolet rays entering from the glass roof of the greenhouse using reflective sheets placed on the ground promotes growth, such that the fruit of the Muscat becomes reddish-purple. Side windows and the skylight are opened, whereas temperature and humidity are controlled by incorporating outside air. The side windows have been modified such that nine consecutive sliding windows can be opened and closed simultaneously by connecting them with bars.\n\nHayashi Grape Labo\n\n(Muscat/Tsutaka-cho, Okayama City, Okayama Prefecture)\n\nThis article is an excerpt from “Window Workology,” a joint research project concerning windows and the behaviors around them done in collaboration with Tokyo Institute of Technologyʼs Yoshiharu Tsukamoto Laboratory."
