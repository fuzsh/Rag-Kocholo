Hisataka Moriwaki\n\nHokkaido University FoVM Experimental Animal Facility\n\nKita 18, Nishi 9, Kita-ku Sapporo, 060-0818 JapanIn 2005, a Japanese law, Act on Welfare and Management of Animals was revised and the 3Rs concept (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) in animal experiments was stipulated in the Act. According to the concept, our Animal Facility has been making a great endeavor to execute animal experiments which satisfy animal welfare and the international standard. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the School including a ordinal citizen member has been improving the animal care and use program and facility, such as support for planning of appropriate animal experiments, critical review of the experimental protocols, improvement of environments of Animal Facility, application of environmental enrichment, evaluation of appropriate quality and number of animals, reduction or elimination of unpleasantness, suffering, and pain in animals, appropriate choice of sedative, analgesic, and anesthetic drugs, establishment of endpoints, and inspection by attending veterinarians all the year round. To verify that our Animal Facility satisfies high level of animal ethics and the international standard for using animals, we decided that our Facility should be reviewed by The Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC International) which is the most well-known NPO for evaluation of animal facilities. In 2007, our Animal Facility obtained the full accreditation from AAALAC International as the first accredited institute among Japanese Universities and has kept the status since then. Our Animal Facility wishes to execute animal experiments by satisfying animal welfare as well as to rear qualified persons who could be a leader for executing the appropriate animal experiment with wide knowledge.\n\nHybrigenics Services\n\nTokyo, JapanHybrigenics Services is a complete service provider of cutting-edge technologies dedicated to the study of proteins and their interactions in 35+ organisms and any research thematic.

The beginning of the application of the chromosomal engineering research to medicine was the development of human mono chromosome library and the chromosome transfer technology. In the 1990's, we succeeded in developing the first fully human antibody-producing mouse in the world through collaboration research with Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd. (present Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd.). This result has opened up a new era of antibody drugs. In the next 20 years, the foundation of artificial chromosome engineering technology has been completed, and many state-of-the-art platforms are being constructed for drug discovery to combat intractable diseases. Through extensive use of these technologies, we will strive to reach out, even a day earlier, to patients who suffer from intractable diseases. ■Our Mission We contribute to people's living and health by applying innovative chromosome engineering technology developed by Tottori University (Japan) to medical treatment and drug discovering widely. ■Our Business: Research and development and commissioned research of pharmaceuticals by utilizing chromosome engineering technology - Development of humanized model mice &amp; rats - Fully human antibody producing mice (TC-mAb mouse) - Humanized ADME model mice &amp; rats (Tc-huADME Model) - Humanized genetic rare disease model mice &amp; rats - Down Syndrome mouse/rat model (A model animal with human chromosome 21 introduced) - Contract studies - Discovery of fully human antibodies - Pharmacokinetic study using humanized ADME model mice &amp; rats - Animal production of above trans-chromosomic mice &amp; rats ____________________________________________________________________________ ■Our Key Technology: Artificial Chromosome Vector The artificial chromosome is a vector having a minimal function and structure as a chromosome by removing the gene region from a natural human or mouse chromosome. It is possible to introduce Mb size giant genes and multiple genes. The artificial chromosome is maintained stably in the cell and is transmitted from the parent to children in mouse and rat. The artificial chromosome vector is not inserted into the chromosome of the host but exists independently within the cell nucleus. Since it can carry various genes, it functions as a high-performance remote controller that issues commands to cells. Examples of practical applications include fully human antibody-producing animals, rare disease animal models, and cells / animals for functional evaluation. ■Fully Human Antibodies Producing Mouse: TC-mAb mouse We established a new generation of human Ab producing Tc mice (TC-mAb mice), which stably maintain a mouse-derived engineered chromosome containing the entire human Ig heavy and kappa chain loci in a mouse Ig knockout background. Comprehensive, high-throughput DNA sequencing revealed that the human Ig repertoire, including variable gene use, was well recapitulated in TC-mAb mice. Despite slightly altered B cell development and a delayed immune response, immunized TC-mAb mice exhibited more subsets of antigen-specific plasmablast and plasma cells compared with wild-type mice, leading to high efficiency hybridoma production. Thus, TC-mAb mice offer a valuable platform to obtain fully human therapeutic Abs and to elucidate the regulation of human Ig repertoire formation. [Contract studies] - Animal production of above trans-chromosomic mice &amp; rats - Custom fully human antibody development using TC-mAb mouse. - We can refer you to our company’s partner. ■Humanized ADME Model Mouse &amp; Rats: Tc-huADME Model In order to solve the problem of animal species differences found in research and development, human pharmacokinetic-related gene was introduced into experimental animals with artificial chromosome vector. Since it is introduced with gene regulatory region induced, it reproduces timing specific and tissue specific expressions in mouse / rat. These animals are useful for predicting human-specific pharmacokinetics, enzyme induction / inhibition tests, and analysis of drug-drug interactions. In addition to supplying animals as collaborative research, we also conduct contract tests from drug administration to sampling. - A model animal in which a pharmacokinetic-related gene cluster is humanized. - Physiological gene expression confirmed in all tissues. - Breeding by mating is possible.

We can also collect urine and feces and dissect for tissue sampling. - Non-GLP study : Conducted by our company. - GLP study : We request our partner company (SHIN NIPPON BIOMEDICAL LABORATORIES, LTD. (SNBL)). ■HepG2 Cell for stable expression of 4CYPs+POR HepG2 cell: TC-HepG2 HepG2 cells, a cell line derived from human liver cancer, have been used as an alternative model of the liver for many years. However, since expression of drug metabolism-related genes (mainly CYP) is remarkably low, and it is considered difficult to use them as a substitute for human primary hepatocytes. We have overcome this problem with artificial chromosome vector connected to four CYPs (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) and POR and provide cells showing high CYP activity. [Applications of TC-HepG2 cell] - Inhibition test / drug interaction test - Research of hepatotoxicity - High content screening ■Down Syndrome mouse/rat model: Evaluation of anxiety-like behavior A model animal with human chromosome 21 introduced. The animal is useful for; - Phenotypic analysis of higher brain dysfunction etc. - Evaluation of drugs for ameliorating symptoms. - Drug discovery by identifying causative genes. - Drug repositioning search Please refer to the attached PDF for details.\n\nTrans Chromosomics, Inc.\n\n86 Nishi-cho Yonago, Tottori, 6838503 Japan■About Trans Chromosomics Our company was founded in 2014 to put the research outcomes of basic chromosome researches over 40 years into practical use.

The animal is useful for; - Phenotypic analysis of higher brain dysfunction etc. - Evaluation of drugs for ameliorating symptoms. - Drug discovery by identifying causative genes. - Drug repositioning search Please refer to the attached PDF for details.\n\nWakayama Medical University Laboratory Animal Center\n\n, Wakayama-shi, Wakayama-ken 641-0011, JPThe Laboratory Animal Center was established as the “Joint Use Facility and Animal Room as a part of the Applied Medicial Research Laboratory in 1974. It was re-established as the “Laboratory Animal Center” during the move to the Kimiidera Campus in 1999. The Center supports animal experiments carried out in the University. In addition to rearing laboratory animals, it has in place the environment required for more advanced animal experiments and supplies data and information relevant to animal experiments. The Center has a total area of about 1980 m2. The rearing room is set at a temperature of 23±1°C, 50-60% humidity, with illumination from 8:00 to 20:00 (12L12D). Animals reared include mice (maximum storage capacity of 21,935 animals), rats (maximum storage capacity of 730 animals), hamsters, gerbils, guinea pigs, rabbits (maximum storage capacity of 114 animals), dogs, monkeys (maximum storage capacity of eight animals), and chickens. The Center is equipped with a rearing room with an air conditioning system that uses a one-way airstream method to prevent generation of smells and allergens from the animals and create a pleasant environment for researchers, a microbarrier system for rearing many genetically recombinant animals in a clean environment, an environmentally controlled rearing room with optionally programed temperature, humid, and lighting, and an experimental rearing room for experiments such as stress tests that require irritation of the animals to be prevented as far as possible. In addition, the Center is also involved in the creation of new genetically recombinant animals using gene editing technology and stock preservation of mutant strains. At present, the Center is involved in a wide variety of basic research and applied research, including analysis of stress response in various organs, research into wound healing, research into pain mechanisms, analysis of obesity-related hormone induced genes, basic research into cancer immunotherapy, analysis of genes involved in organogenesis, and analysis of the roles of chemokines and cytokines in various diseases.\n\nAlltech\n\nTenjin Daisan Building 4F, 3-5, Tenjin 3-chome, Chuo-ku, Fukuoka 810-0001 JapanFounded in 1980 by Irish biochemist and entrepreneur Dr. Pearse Lyons, Alltech is a leading global biotechnology company whose mission is to improve the health and performance of people, animals and plants through natural nutrition and scientific innovation. We pursue this mission guided by what we call the ACE principle, our promise that in doing business we have a positive impact on the Animal, the Consumer and the Environment. Animal Health Our core business improves animal health and performance by adding nutritional value to feed, naturally, through Alltech’s innovative use of yeast fermentation, enzyme technology, algae and nutrigenomics, which studies the impact of nutrition at the genetic level. Our technologies and support programs enable farmers to realize greater efficiency, profitability and sustainability on their farms. Alltech Crop Science Our Alltech Crop Science division complements our animal nutrition business by focusing on improving the health of crops. Our technologies enable us to improve the productivity of the field, in terms of yield quality and quantity, and to enhance nutrition beginning with the soil and the seed. Human Health We believe scientific innovation in animal and crop sciences is part of a much more important story, that of human health. Healthier animals and crops, nurtured naturally through Alltech’s nutritional solutions, affect human well-being. For example, fruits, vegetables and animal proteins have become less nutrient-rich in the past half-century. From fish to oranges, you need to eat more today to get the same nutritional value. Our work within animal and crop sciences is restoring value and also exploring ways to naturally enrich foods through improving the animal diet or crop produced. For example, laying hens fed a diet rich in Alltech’s algae produce eggs enriched with DHA omega-3, an essential nutrient for human cognitive development and health at all ages.\n\nWakayama Medical University Laboratory Animal Center\n\n, Wakayama-shi, Wakayama-ken 641-0012, JPThe Laboratory Animal Center was established as the “Joint Use Facility and Animal Room as a part of the Applied Medicial Research Laboratory in 1974.
