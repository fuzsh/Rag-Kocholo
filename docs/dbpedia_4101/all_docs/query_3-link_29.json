They are made possible by generous supporters and funders and allow HRI to further connect with our coastal communities.\n\nResearch Programs\n\nThe Harte Research Institute is set apart from other marine research institutions by its use of the HRI Model, a unique interdisciplinary way of working that integrates our science with economic, policy and sociological expertise. Each of our nine research programs are dedicated to working together to develop science-driven solutionsâ„¢ that aim to conserve coastal and marine resources, while also developing resilient communities and economies in the United States, Mexico, and Cuba."
