Soil test results provide guidance on the types and amounts of fertilizer and lime to apply to optimize plant growth and yield. Soil testing is just one component of agronomic and environmental nutrient management that collectively helps sustain plant growth and minimize nutrient losses into the surrounding landscape using the best available science. In Arkansas, routine soil testing is done free of charge provided the soil is from Arkansas and the person submitting the sample is an Arkansas resident. The Fertilizer Tonnage Fee has supported soil testing services and enforcement of fertilizer laws in Arkansas since 1953 and provides free routine testing of soil at the Marianna Laboratory. Routine soil analysis includes measurement of soil water pH and extraction of plant available nutrients using the Mehlich-3 extraction method. A list of routine and non-routine (fee-based) services and references for the analytical methods used by the Marianna Soil Test Laboratory is given below. For information on how to collect and submit a soil sample, please go to How to Submit Soil Samples page.\n\nLaboratory Methods and References\n\nRoutine analysis\n\nMehlich III (Index of nutrient availability for selected nutrients, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Na, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B)\n\nZhang, H., D.H.

Starting in 2018, the Marianna Laboratory participates in the Agricultural Laboratory Proficiency Program (ALP). Prior to 2018, the laboratory participated in the North American Proficiency Testing (NAPT) Program. Current and past results from these programs are available upon request.\n\nThe Marianna Soil Test Laboratory guidelines on soil sample retention are outlined below. Please contact the laboratory immediately after receiving results if a request for reanalysis is needed.\n\nSoil samples will be retained at the laboratory for a maximum of 30 days after analysis or until sample storage space becomes limited.\n\nDuring the rush season (September thru April) sample retention may be as low as 2 weeks.\n\nTo request reanalysis of samples you will need to provide the laboratory identification number(s) of the sample(s) that need to be reanalyzed and indicate what analytes need to be reanalyzed (pH, Mehlich-3 extractable nutrients, or both).\n\nSome soil samples may not contain enough soil for reanalysis.\n\nTo request sample reanalysis, login to the soil sample submission portal (https://uasoiltest.uada.edu/). Once logged in, click on “Request a Retest of a Sample” at the bottom of the menu page. Enter the Lab ID and the reason for requesting sample reanalysis and click on” Request sample retest” to submit the request.\n\nSoil Samples\n\nCrop Codes\n\nSoil Test Results\n\nCounty Agent Info\n\nHow to Submit Soil Samples\n\nDirections for Consultants and Farmers (PDF)\n\nLIMS Training Video\n\nSoil samples must be submitted in a University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture soil sample box that contains a barcode and sample identification number. Soil sample boxes are available free to Arkansas residents at Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service offices located in each county (https://uaex.uada.edu/counties/). Agriculture consultants needing large quantities of soil sample boxes should contact the Marianna Soil Test Laboratory (870-295-2851).\n\nIf information about how to collect a soil sample is needed, please watch the video available at https://uaex.uada.edu/environment-nature/soil/soil-test.aspx or contact the county Extension agent for further assistance.\n\nSoil samples (about 1 pint of soil) may be brought directly to the Marianna Soil Test Laboratory as long as the samples are in barcoded soil sample boxes and sample information has been entered into the online system. Soil samples may also be delivered to the nearest County Extension Office (in a plastic bag or other suitable container and put into a barcoded soil sample box) and be shipped to the Marianna Soil Test Lab.\n\nSoil sample information is now submitted to the laboratory electronically using the website https://uasoiltest.uada.edu/. The CES 435 form is no longer used. Clients must develop an account with a user id and a password to submit samples and view soil test reports. Clients who do not have an email address must submit soil samples through the county office and will receive a soil test report through the mail.\n\nSample information may be submitted directly by the client or the staff at any County Extension Office. Regardless of who electronically submits soil samples, the required information includes:\n\nPhone number and mailing address\n\nEmail address (if available)\n\nField or sample name\n\nPlant or crop to be grown ( see crop code Tab above)\n\nFor rice, the cultivar is also needed\n\nFor selected crops (e.g., corn and forages for hay production), a yield goal is needed.\n\nOther information (non-essential)\n\nLime history (last 4 years)\n\nIrrigation water source\n\nField leveling history (last 4 years)\n\nRequest and payment for fee-based analysis\n\nSoil Association number Map\n\nThe online sample submission program allows users to view the soil samples that have been successfully submitted to the laboratory. Once soil samples have been analyzed, the client will receive an email stating that soil sample analysis is complete and the reports are ready to be viewed, downloaded, or printed. Clients that do not have an email address, will be mailed a hard copy of soil test results directly from the laboratory. Clients with an email address will need to create an account to receive notification of when soil test results are available.\n\nSoils NOT Tested at Marianna Soil Testing Laboratory\n\nIf the native soils have been heavily amended with compost, bagged garden soils, mulch, etc the Marianna Soil Test Laboratory will not analyze the samples. Samples containing or comprised of mulch, potting soil, perlite, and vermiculite, and/or compost are not lab friendly and may contaminate laboratory equipment. Routine soil analysis is not an appropriate assessment of the suitability of these products for plant growth.\n\nCrop Codes\n\nCrop CodeCrop NameCrop Type 1Corn for Grain (Yield Potential up to 125 bu/acre)Row Crop 2Corn for Grain (Yield Potential up to 150 bu/acre)Row Crop 3Corn for Grain (Yield Potential up to 175 bu/acre)Row Crop 4Corn for Grain (Yield Potential ≥ 200 bu/acre)Row Crop 5Corn for SilageRow Crop 6CottonRow Crop 7Grain Sorghum for Grain -
