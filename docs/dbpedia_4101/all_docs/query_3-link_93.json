        "text": "Welcome!\n\nWelcome to the Department of Ophthalmologyâ€™s research web pages. Here you will find information about the breadth of research being conducted by our faculty. Our research laboratories are located on the 5th floor of the Research Complex-1 North tower on the Anschutz Medical Campus. Faculty conducting ocular epidemiology and comparative effectiveness research are located in the Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Eye Center also on the Anschutz campus.\n\nOur research division is under the leadership of J. Mark Petrash, PhD, Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Ophthalmology. We currently have 19 faculty members, including basic researchers and clinician-scientists, who direct impactful basic and translational research projects. Our research team is further strengthened by 9 vision research colleagues from other departments who have secondary or adjoint appointments in ophthalmology, respectively. In addition, clinical faculty in our department are leading and participating in a broad number of clinical trials.\n\nResearch areas of excellence include:\n\nOur department also provides an excellent training environment for graduate students at the University of Colorado. Faculty affiliations include graduate programs in Biomedical Science, Toxicology, Cell Biology, Stem Cells and Development, Molecular Biology, Neuroscience, and Public Health programs. Students in these competitive programs can perform their graduate research or rotations with our faculty. Many of our faculty also mentor undergraduate trainees associated with the Gates Summer Internship Program.\n\nWe are also proud to host a variety of monthly meetings to stimulate research in the vision sciences. During the academic year, we host a Journal Club in which our graduate students and postdoctoral scientists lead discussions of high impact publications in leading journals. We also host a Vision Science Seminar Series featuring internationally-prominent speakers from the vision research community. Group meetings are open to the campus community.\n\nPlease explore our site to learn more about the research being performed in each laboratory. If you are interested in supporting our research, please visit our giving page for information on that process. Thank you for taking the time to visit us today!"
