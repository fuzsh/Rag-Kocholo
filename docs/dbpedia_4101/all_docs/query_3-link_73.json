        "text": "Research driven by the needs of children\n\nDedicated to research with a purpose, our priorities are driven by the specific needs of the children and families Children’s Mercy serves. This approach further strengthens the interconnectedness and impact of the hospital’s clinical and research programs, bringing science to the bedside to accelerate the pace of discovery and enhance care.\n\nThe CMRI’s world-class research enterprise includes a team of internationally recognized scientists and researchers whose sole focus is to serve the needs of children.\n\nLed by Shawn St. Peter, Surgeon-in-Chief and interim Chief Scientific Officer, and Steven Leeder, interim Executive Director, The CMRI, Associate Chair-Research, Department of Pediatrics, a distinguished and highly experienced leadership team supports the CMRI’s mission and vision of improving the health and wellbeing of children through world-class translational research. The dedicated leadership team at the CMRI includes:\n\nMark Hoffman, PhD, Chief Research Information Officer\n\nSteven Leeder, PharmD, PhD, Deputy Director, interim Executive Director\n\nJeanne James, MD, MBA, FAAP Chair of Pediatrics\n\nShawn St. Peter, MD, Surgeon-in-Chief and interim Chief Scientific Officer\n\nMary Tomlinson, Vice President of Research Administration\n\nLearn more about our leadership team.\n\nAn unprecedented investment\n\nThe CMRI’s new building was kickstarted by two of Kansas City’s most iconic families who together generously donated $150 million to transform pediatric research. The donation from the Hall Family Foundation and the Sunderland Foundation represents the largest one-time gift ever made to a children’s hospital for pediatric research.\n\nThe gift not only transforms research at Children’s Mercy but the Kansas City skyline as well, with a dynamic window configuration featuring different colors that represent the genetic anomalies found in the DNA of children with specific rare diseases – just some of the difficult cases and questions the CMRI researchers are trying to solve.\n\nExplore ways you can help support our work at the CMRI.\n\nSetting a high bar for clinical research\n\nChildren and their families are the most valuable resource at the CMRI, and every interaction at a child’s bedside or in the clinic is an opportunity for our researchers and staff to learn. Discoveries made today that can change the course of a child’s health tomorrow are not possible without the children and families who volunteer in our clinical studies.\n\nProtecting the health and wellbeing of these research volunteers, often called human subjects, is of utmost importance at the CMRI. Our human subjects research program has earned full accreditation by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs, Inc. (AAHRPP), an independent, nonprofit organization. Children and their families are the most valuable resource at the CMRI, and every interaction at a child’s bedside or in the clinic is an opportunity for our researchers and staff to learn. Discoveries made today that can change the course of a child’s health tomorrow are not possible without the children and families who volunteer in our clinical studies.\n\nAs the “gold seal,” AAHRPP accreditation ensures children and their families who research volunteers in clinical studies that our program meets the highest standards for ethics, quality and protections.\n\nLearn how to get involved in a clinical study at Children's Mercy.\n\nAreas of Emphasis\n\nSeveral dedicated Areas of Emphasis enhance the quest to find answers to pediatric medicine’s most challenging questions. These Areas of Emphasis – Genomic Medicine, Health Care Innovation, Population Health and Precision Therapeutics – provide a supportive framework for discovery through access to expertise and state-of-the-art resources for researchers and teams striving to translate scientific discoveries into medical advances. Read more about the CMRI’s Areas of Emphasis.\n\nThe CMRI also features the latest medical technologies, a robust applied informatics program, and state-of-the-art biorepository that further drive research and innovation."
