        "text": "Lab focus\n\nSynapses are specialized structures that are critical for the transmission of information between neurons in the brain. Fine-tuning of the electrochemical activity at synapses underlies cognitive processes. In Alzheimer’s disease, memory loss coincides with synapse deterioration. The Tracy lab is investigating the molecular events that lead to synapse dysfunction and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. We think that synapses are particularly vulnerable to toxicity early in the progression of dementia before neurons begin to die. Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, accumulates in the brain and becomes toxic to neurons in Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. We are exploring how tau-mediated toxicity contributes to the emergence of synapse pathophysiology in these diseases. We are using mouse models and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived neurons to dissect the mechanisms that trigger synapse and neuronal dysfunction during pathogenesis. Our long-term goal is to establish a foundation for new treatment strategies to restore synapse function and cognition at the early stages of disease progression before neurons are lost.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nMillions of people are suffering from progressively debilitating dementia as they age, and the number of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease is steadily rising. To advance our understanding of the mechanisms that promote cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia, it will be critical to discover the events that lead to synapse dysfunction and deterioration. This research may uncover new approaches for therapeutic intervention early in disease progression to promote the healthy aging of the brain."
