On behalf of the deceased, we would like to thank all of you for supporting the institute for many years.\n\nBecause of the fever of an unknown cause that started in May 2019, he became weak for a long period and eventually returned to Himeji for hospitalization.\n\nWe regret deeply for his death especially because we were informed that he was able to take meals little by little and was recovering.\n\nPlease understand that the funeral was held only by the family, and they decline condolatory calls and flowers.\n\nWe sincerely pray that Mr. Tochimoto’s soul may rest in peace.\n\nWe look forward to your continued support and cooperation.\n\nSumio Okada, PhD\n\nDirector of the NPO Hanzaki Institute of Japan\n\nOur New Director\n\nDr. Sumio Okada succeeded the directorship of the institute from Mr. Tochimoto in 2017 who was active as an honorary president until his death. Now the institute made a new start under Dr. Okada’s directorship. Dr. Okada is the world’s leading authority on Japanese giant salamanders with 20+ years of experience with this species. His research currently focuses on parental care behaviors, breeding ecology, population assessment, and human impacts. He has published extensively and appeared on numerous nature documentaries.\n\nThe Hanzaki Institute and Asago City are hosting 17th Annual Japanese Giant Salamander Conference in 2020!\n\nWe are excited to announce that we are the host for the next Annual Conference. The past conferences have been domestic and targeted only Japanese participants. In 2020, we are making the conference international and inviting not only Japanese but also international participants. Please be noted that it is an invitation-only conference. If you are a member of CIG (Cryptobranchid Interest Group), you will receive an invitation. If you are not a CIG member but are involved in amphibian conservation research/education, please contact us for the details of the conference.\n\nOn-going Research Projects\n\nWhereas we work with the Prefectural and the local governments for outsourcing population surveys, we actively seek grants from private companies and organizations for our own research summarized below.\n\nPopulation Monitoring\n\nOur main research project is to monitor the giant salamander population in Ichikawa River. We regularly wade through the river at night, find giant salamanders, and take various measurements. To date, we identified over 1700 individuals and most of them are identified with microchips. By comparing data and measurements over time, we are working to resolve mysteries behind the life cycle of the Japanese Giant Salamander such as longevity and growth rate.\n\nPopulation Assessment - Collaboration with Bucknell University\n\nDr. Mizuki Takahashi’s lab at Bucknell University and we are assessing populations in small un-surveyed tributaries using the environmental DNA method. We currently know little about the importance of those small streams (1 to 3 order streams) to the cycle history of giant salamanders. Despite the small size, those streams may provide important habitats for larval and juvenile giant salamanders. Dr. Takahashi led a summer research program with three Bucknell Students during the summer of 2018. They stayed at the Institute for about a month, conducted the eDNA research, and interacted with the locals including students from Ikuno High School.\n\nBreeding Ecology - Collaboration with Azabu University\n\nDr. Kumi Matsui’s lab at Azabu University and we are assessing breeding status of salamanders by analyzing reproductive hormones in blood samples and using a portable ultrasound device. Dr. Matsui’s lab visits the institute throughout the year and monitor how reproductive organs and hormones change in response to their breeding activity.\n\nPopulation Monitoring within our Community - Collaboration with Ikuno High School\n\nStudents from the local Ikuno High School and we just started monitoring of the giant salamander population in front of the Ikuno High School located in Ikuno Town. It is our mission to engage our community members in conservation and promote environmental education among the young. We are developing a long-term collaborative relationship with the high school.\n\nFuture Collaborators\n\nWe are actively seeking collaborators to promote research and conservation of Japanese Giant Salamanders. Please contact us if you are interested.\n\nDonations to the Institute\n\nWe sincerely thank to the following organizations and individuals for their generous supports. We are a non-profitable organization that solely depends on memberships, grants, and donations for the management of the institute. In particular, donations enable us to continue and expand our research. We would greatly appreciate your support.\n\nHonolulu Zoo (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)\n\n- Laura Debner\n\nCurator of Reptiles/Amphibians and Children's Zoo/ Conservation Chair\n\nSan Antonio Zoo (2016)\n\n- Danté Fenolio, PhD\n\nVice President of Conservation and Research\n\nDetroit Zoological Society (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)\n\n- Mark Vassallo\n\nCurator of Amphibians\n\nIf you are able to support us, please contact us at info@hanzaki.net.

Please see the aim, qualification, and the researchers of our Research Unit as follows.\n\nAim\n\nIn order to achieve the aim of the Hanzaki Research Institute, which is\n\nconservation and restoration of the giant salamander and its natural\n\nenvironment, it is vital to work with partners who can engage in long-term\n\nresearch. For this reason, the Hanzaki Research Institute welcomes\n\nresearchers who can devote themselves to research with enthusiasm, and will\n\nprovide research funds as needed within the budget. Researchers are obliged\n\nto return their research results to society by submitting annual reports,\n\npresenting research findings at domestic and international conferences.\n\nQualification\n\nThose who, regardless of nationality, has a doctoral degree or are enrolled\n\nin a doctoral program who can engage in research on the giant salamander,\n\nother local wildlife, and their natural environment in cooperation with the\n\nHanzaki Institute. Those who have not obtained a doctoral degree or who are\n\nnot enrolled in a doctoral program may be qualified to be as an Hanzaki\n\ninstitute researcher based on a recommendation by the president and vice\n\npresident.\n\nDirector\n\nSumio Okada\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D., United Graduate School of Agriculture Sciences at Tottori University\n\nResearch Interest\n\nMy research interests are the ecology and conservation biology of the Japanese giant salamander, especially, larval life history, paternal care behaviors, population dynamics, and the impact of human activities with long-term monitoring.\n\n【Related publications】\n\nTapley, B., ST Turvey, S Chen, F Xie, J Yang, Z Liang, H Tian, M Wu, S Okada, J Wang, J Lü, F Zhou, J Xu, H Zhao, J Redbond, T Brown and AA Cunningham. 2021.

Using various research tools such as aquatic mesocosms, behavioral assays, and molecular analyses, our current projects focus on: 1) Interspecific interactions between wood frogs and spotted salamanders, 2) Effects of road salt pollution on an aquatic community, 3) Parental care behaviors of Japanese giant\n\nResearcher\n\nYuichi Ikegami\n\nEducational Background\n\n· M.S., The University of Shimane\n\n· B.S., The University of Shimane\n\nResearch Interests\n\nSince my retirement, I started studying Chinese and Japanese classic literature and found it interesting to see how such classic literature provides the foundation for modern society and culture. With this background, I am interested in histories and folklores surrounding giant salamanders.\n\nResearcher\n\nKaori Takagi\n\nEducational Background\n\nPh.D., The University of Tokyo\n\nM.S., The University of Tokyo\n\nB.S., Tokyo Gakugei University\n\nResearch Interests\n\nSalamander, dispersal, landscape genetics, local adaptation, metapopulation dynamics, conservation ecology.\n\nI seek to understand the survival strategies of salamanders from the perspective of dispersal and local adaptation. Especially, I am interested in how dispersal and local adaptation contribute to the maintenance of metapopulations. Ultimately, I would like to apply these pieces of knowledge to the management and conservation of salamanders.\n\n【Related publications】\n\nTakagi, K. and Miyashita, T. 2019 “Larval Prey Preference of Pond-breeding salamander Hynobius tokyoensis Living in a Stream” Current Herpetology in East Asia.
