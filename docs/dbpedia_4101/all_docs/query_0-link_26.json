        "text": "Estimation of reproductive parameters\n\nWe used PWI data of bears that were at least five years old to estimate age at first reproduction and reproductive interval. Although female bears are sexually mature and able to reproduce from four years old (Katayama et al. 1996; Yamanaka et al. 2011b), PWI for four-year-old females can be obtained from the annulus width only between the ages of three and four, because the annulus width from four to five years old is still in the process of formation (Tochigi et al. 2019). Therefore, we used the PWI of female bears ≥ five years old. Previous studies indicated that the PWI was significantly smaller in years when female bears gave birth successfully and raised cubs until at least August (Tochigi et al. 2018; Tochigi et al. 2019). We used the threshold reported by Tochigi et al. (2018); a PWI < 0.25 indicated that the bear probably had a cub or cubs until at least August (i.e., a “cub-year”). If two or more consecutive “cub-years” were detected, then female bears were possibly accompanied by cubs during all the consecutive cub-years. Consecutive litter production occurs largely when a female loses her cubs-of-the-year (Garrison et al. 2007) and then produces another litter in the subsequent year. Therefore, detection of consecutive cub-years likely indicates that the female lost her cubs-of-the-year before the end of the mating season (Medill et al. 2010). Furthermore, there was a low chance that females lost cubs-of-the-year before the end of the mating season during the final year of consecutive cub-years (Fig. 2). We defined a non-consecutive cub-year or the final year of consecutive cub-years as a reproduction year (Fig. 2). For example, in Fig. 2a, where the PWI indicated three consecutive cub-years from age five to age seven, we assumed that the bear lost the cubs that she gave birth to at ages five and six, making year seven her “first reproduction.”\n\nWe estimated the age at first reproduction by recording the minimum age during a cub-year for each female bear. We determined the reproductive interval by tallying the number of years between a cub-year and the next cub-year for each female bear. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the age at first reproduction and the reproductive interval were generated from bootstrapping (2000 resamplings) by using the simpleboot (Peng 2019) and boot packages (Canty and Ripley 2021) in R software v. 4.0.3 (R Core Team 2022).\n\nTo estimate litter size at birth, we tallied the placental scars for each female bear. This method is widely used (e.g., Helle and Kauhala 1995; Wooding and Bukata 1996), because the number of placental scars corresponds to the number of blastocysts that implant in the uterine wall (Tsubota et al. 1990) and is positively correlated with observed litter size (Strand et al. 1995). In addition, we defined the minimum age at which placental scars were detected as minimum age at primiparity. The 95% CI for the litter size was also generated from bootstrapping (2000 resamplings).\n\nEstimation of mortality rates\n\nTo estimate the mortality rates of subadult and adult female bears (one to 21 years old), we used the mark–recapture–recovery (MRR) model based on the Cormack–Jolly–Seber process (Langrock and King 2013), which can estimate both natural and human-caused mortality separately. An individual bear has three possible fates in any given year: remaining alive, dying of natural causes, and being killed by humans. The process model of MRR was described by a multinomial distribution that determines the transition of an individual's fate. For simplicity, natural mortality and human-caused mortality were assumed to be additive; this is a good approximation for animals with low mortality rates such as ursids (Hebblewhite et al. 2003; Beston 2011; Bischof et al. 2018). To impose a sum-to-one constraint on the multinomial probabilities, we implemented the following vector of probabilities of survival rate, natural mortality rate, and human-caused mortality rate:\n\nwhere pn and ph are parameters of the natural mortality rate and human-caused mortality rate, respectively. When pn and ph are small enough (say, pnph < 0.01), Φ ≈ (1 – pn – ph, pn, ph). The detection of an individual by trapping can be regarded as a Bernoulli trial in which the observation probability depends on the trapping effort in year t. A simple Poisson catchability model (Fukasawa et al. 2020) was assumed for the detection probability qt = 1 – exp(–cEt), where c is the detectability coefficient (i.e., detection probability per unit effort) and Et is the trapping effort in year t. Tags of individuals killed by humans were assumed to be recovered with certainty. We defined the structure of our MRR model as natural or human-caused mortality with a certain probability per unit time step; living individuals are captured with a probability corresponding to the trapping effort and then released alive, and individuals killed by humans are recovered with a probability of 1. As the dataset for model estimation, we constructed detection histories of each female bear in each year and used the histories as input data to fit models containing parameters for natural mortality, human-caused mortality, and detectability over the year. To ensure the identifiability of the model, we assumed that human-caused mortality was constant over the study period. We defined the trapping effort as a product of the total number of traps and number of nights. Because the maximum value of effort was more than 300 000, we divided the detectability by 1000 to avoid numerical overflow in the parameter estimation. The model fit was conducted by using a non-linear optimization function, nlm(), with a self-written log-likelihood function in R ( Supplementary Material S1 (ms2022-0034-supplS1.r)). The 95% CI was calculated by using profile likelihood methods.\n\nWe used a generalized linear model with binomial error and a logit link function to estimate cub mortality. Although we considered the possibility of variance across mothers, the sample size was too small to be used as a random effect. Therefore, we set the number of cubs that survived until at least August and the number of cubs first observed with a particular female (i.e., immediately after the mother had given birth) as the response variable, with only the intercept as the predictor term.\n\nReproductive parameters\n\nThe mean age at first reproduction (5.44 years old; range four to seven years) of our study population was in the range of previously reported ages of sexual maturity (Katayama et al. 1996; Nakamura et al. 2011; Yamanaka et al. 2011b). Additionally, more than half of the female bears had a successful first reproduction at age four or five years. This finding also indicates that several primiparous mothers that had given birth as soon as they reached sexual maturity were able to successfully raise cubs through the first summer.\n\nAlong with age at first reproduction, reproductive interval duration in Asian black bears was previously unknown. The reproductive interval observed here (2.38 years) indicates that female Asian black bears take two years or more before their next reproduction. In several American black bear (U. americanus) and brown bear (U. arctos) populations, offspring separate from their mother at one–two years of age (Rogers 1987; Steyaert et al. 2012). This might indicate that mothers are unable to raise cubs the year after separation, even if they separate from their yearlings (i.e., the cubs survive to the following year) and have the opportunity to mate with males during the mating season. Alternatively, mothers might not separate from their yearlings and might therefore continue to raise their two-year-old cubs (i.e., the yearlings survive to the following year). However, we did not observe female bears caring for two-year-old cubs at our long-term study site; we therefore infer that females may not be able to give birth to another litter immediately after separation. We expect that limiting factors such as low food availability may delay the next chance of successful reproduction (Costello et al. 2003). We think it possible that Asian black bears depend on pulsed resources—that is, resources whose availability changes in space and time with a low frequency, a large magnitude, and a short duration (Yang et al. 2008). Alternatively, since related female Asian black bears form matrilineal assemblages and have overlapping home ranges (Kozakai et al. 2017), the reproductive intervals of daughters may become longer if they stay close to their mothers even after natal dispersal (Støen et al. 2005; Ordiz et al. 2008). In addition, longer intervals may be a consequence of estimating reproductive interval duration for primiparous females only; the reproductive intervals of these females can be longer than those of multiparous females, as documented in brown bears (Zedrosser et al. 2009). We removed consecutive cub-years from our calculations because females would likely have lost their cubs during such years. Thus, our reproductive interval represents the time interval between two litters of cubs that have a high chance of surviving until at least August of their birth year. Therefore, our “reproductive interval” is most certainly longer than the interbirth interval (i.e., the time interval between the birth of a female's litter and the birth of her next litter; Stringham 1990), which is one of the key representations of the reproductive interval.\n\nAlthough we did not perform a statistical analysis, the mean litter size in this study (1.58 ± 0.09), as determined by observation of placental scars, appears to have been smaller than that in previous studies (2.00 ± 0.00 in Katayama et al. 1996; 1.8 in Nakamura et al. 2011; and 1.88 ± 0.12 in Yamanaka et al. 2011b). This may be explained by the average age of bears or the duration of the sampling period in our study. Our sample contained younger females (6.45 ± 0.57 years for individuals with placental scars) and covered a longer period (11 years) than in previous studies (female age 10.6 ± 1.22 years and study period over three years in Katayama et al. [1996]; about 10.8 ± 0.63 years and over one year in Nakamura et al. [2011]; and 10.6 ± 0.50 years and over nine years in Yamanaka et al. [2011b]). It is possible that younger females have smaller litter sizes because of a lack of reproductive experience (Zedrosser et al. 2009). In addition, good environmental conditions, such as high food availability, could lead to larger litter sizes (Czetwertynski et al. 2007; Johnson et al. 2020). If the samples had been collected over a short period of time, then the litter size might have been either under- or overestimated, because it is difficult to account for changes in food availability over time. However, our sample spanned 11 years, enabling us to determine the litter size over many years, during which time food availability fluctuated. Additionally, had we checked both the placental scars and the corpus albicans, we could have determined whether the cubs had been born during the current or the previous year (Yamanaka et al. 2011b). However, given the difficulty of sectioning and staining our samples for microscopic examination, uncertainty exists regarding whether the estimated litter was born during the year in which the female was captured or the year before.\n\nMoreover, the mean litter size based on the number of placental scars (1.58) was lower than the mean litter size observed in the core distribution area (number of cubs first observed = 1.80; number of cubs surviving after the mating season = 1.70). In general, the number of cubs observed would be smaller than the number of placental scars because of partial litter loss (Katayama et al. 1996; Yamanaka et al. 2011b), but our litter size estimates showed an opposite relationship. Our litter size estimates based on placental scars may have been biased because our sample contained younger females, or because our estimation was based on individuals culled at the periphery of the distribution, or both.\n\nWe confirmed that placental scars could be formed in relatively young bears (two years old), which is younger than the previously reported age of sexual maturity (four years old; Katayama et al. 1996). The inference that bears may give birth at two years old does not contradict the results from previous studies suggesting that ovulation may occur in females one–three years old (Katayama et al. 1996) or at least two years of age (Yamanaka et al. 2011b). The maximum observed age of females with placental scars was 20 years. Because placental scars persist for one or two years after giving birth (Tsubota et al. 1990), it is likely that the maximum reproductive age was 19. The possibility that bears 19 or 20 years old might still be of reproductive age is concordant with previous reports or observations of 16–18-year-old mothers with cubs (Katayama et al. 1996; Yamanaka et al. 2011b). Nakamura et al. (2009) also documented ovulation in a 22-year-old female. Our results and those of these previous studies suggest that Asian black bears produce cubs until their 20s.\n\nIn general, reproductive parameters (age at first reproduction, reproductive interval, litter size, and minimum age at primiparity) are affected by external factors such as habitat condition, population density, and magnitude of conflict with humans (e.g., Bischof et al. 2018; van de Walle et al. 2018). In addition, internal factors such as nutritional condition and the length of maternal care would affect reproductive parameters (van de Walle et al. 2018). Therefore, the reproductive parameters of the Echigo–Mikuni population may differ from those of other populations of Asian black bears, because females in other populations may live in habitats with different nutritional conditions or exhibit a different age structure from that of the Echigo–Mikuni population. Additionally, we should be cautious about interpreting the reproductive parameters from our study, because our data included those on nuisance bears. Nevertheless, Asian black bears culled as nuisances in mast failure condition of hard mast in Japan do not differ substantially from nuisance bears in better masting condition with regard to stored body fat, indicating that poor nutritional condition is not directly related to nuisance behavior (Yamanaka et al. 2011a). Given that nutritional condition, which could affect reproductive parameters, possibly does not significantly differ between culled bears and free-ranging bears, the reproductive parameters observed here may be similar to those of free-ranging Asian black bears.\n\nMortality parameters\n\nHuman-caused mortality, such as from sport hunting and culling, was relatively low (0.005, 95% CI: 0.002–0.021) compared with natural mortality (0.101, 95% CI: 0.059–0.167). The Ashio–Nikko Mountains are located in an area where nuisance killing and sport hunting are conducted (Tochigi Prefecture 2021; Gunma Prefecture 2022). In both prefectures, most bears were killed during control operations (more than 50%; Tochigi Prefecture 2021; Gunma Prefecture 2022). Our recovery records, which are all for nuisance kills, reflect this situation (Fig. 6). However, human access is controlled in most of our study area. Thus, culling pressure and human–bear conflicts are lower in our study area than in other areas inhabited by the Echigo–Mikuni population. If future population size estimates or population trend estimates are conducted by using our data for human-caused mortality, it may lead to overestimation of population size. Therefore, estimating specific human-caused mortality before population analysis is critical.\n\nMortality and survival rates vary by season, year, age class, reproductive status, and other factors in brown bears, American black bears, and polar bears (U. maritimus) (Hebblewhite et al. 2003; Regehr et al. 2010; Krofel et al. 2012; Bischof et al. 2018). Here, we estimated the average natural mortality across a 19-year period for individuals ranging in age from one to 21 years, thereby smoothing variation in age structure and over time. The mortality rates for each age group and season must be confirmed in order to estimate how each parameter contributes to population dynamics. However, for ursids, adult survival rate is an essential parameter affecting population growth and fluctuation (Hebblewhite et al. 2003; Mitchell et al. 2009). Considering the absence of reports on the mortality rate of Asian black bears, our finding is important and constitutes fundamental biological data.\n\nIn Japan, the number of Asian black bears that are culled fluctuates among seasons and years (Echigo–Mikuni population: Tochigi Prefecture 2020; Gunma Prefecture 2022; Nagano Prefecture 2022; Japan: Oka 2006; Ministry of the Environment 2022). Although there may be seasonal and annual variations in human-caused mortality in our study area, we were unable to account for fluctuations, because our sample size was small and there was no annual change in culling pressure. In the future, we should conduct an analysis using more samples across a wider area to take temporal fluctuations into account and estimate general human-caused mortality. This would help us understand the bear-culling situation in Japan and the impact of culling on bear population dynamics.\n\nCub mortality (0.235) during the first half year after birth was higher than natural mortality (0.108) and human-caused mortality (0.005) in subadult and adult female bears. We expect that sexually selected infanticide (the killing of dependent offspring by adult males to generate mating opportunities) (Steyaert et al. 2014) may have an impact on cub survival rates in our study system. Factors affecting cub mortality remain unclear for Asian black bear so far, but a previous study showed evidence for male infanticide during the mating season in our study area (Yamazaki 2017) and in another population in Japan (Naganuma et al. 2021). We suggest that more observations and field verifications are needed to clarify the main causes of cub mortality and the occurrence of sexually selected infanticide in our study system. Cub mortality also varies with mother-related factors: age, nutritional condition, and the length of maternal care, as is for example the case in brown bears (Zedrosser et al. 2009; van de Walle et al. 2018). This finding indicates that reproductive experience may also affect cub mortality, and it may also apply to Asian black bears. We need more samples to evaluate the factors that impact cub mortality and to reduce uncertainty in future studies."
