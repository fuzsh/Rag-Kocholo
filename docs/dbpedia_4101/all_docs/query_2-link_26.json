        "text": "Japan was extremely restricted on importing commodities from abroad during the World Warâ… . Especially, self-supply of chemicals and iron and steel was forced. ln order to meet these demands, the 1st Division for developing nonflammable celluloid and the 2nd Division for iron and steel were established in August, 1915 and April, 1916, respectively, in the Provisional Institute of Physical and Chemical Research of the Tohoku Imperial University.\n\nThe first head of the 2nd Division was Professor Kotaro HONDA invented the KS magnet steel soon. This was the beginning of a great success exploiting a variety of functional alloys such as new KS magnet steel, Sendust, Superinvar, Coelinvar and so on and cultivating and sending out a great number of excellent researchers. The institute has been a pioneer for material research 100 years.\n\nThe institute was reorganized on May 21, 1987 as a collaborative research institute to meet the current rapid progress in materials science. IMR provides opportunities for the researchers both in academic institutes and industries to carry out cooperative work for mutual benefits. The chance for this collaboration is open not only to Japanese researchers but also to those overseas."
