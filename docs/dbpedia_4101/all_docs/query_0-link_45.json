Svrjcek (editor) U.S. Department of Commerce SH11 .A44672 no.92 NOAA Technical Report NMFS The major responsibilities of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are to monitor and assess the abundance and geographic distribution of fishery resources, to understand and predict fluctuations in the quantity and distribution of these resources, and to establish levels for their optimum use. NMFS is also charged with the development and implementation of policies for managing national fishing grounds, development and enforcement of domestic fisheries regulations, surveillance of foreign fishing off United States coastal waters, and the development and enforcement of international fishery agreements and policies. NMFS also assists the fishing industry through marketing service and economic analysis programs, and mortgage in- surance and vessel construction subsidies. It collects, analyzes, and publishes statistics on various phases of the industry. The NOAA Technical Report NMFS series was established in 1983 to replace two subcategories of the Technical Reports series: \"Special Scientific Report-Fisheries\" and \"Circular.\" The series contains the following types of reports: Scientific investigations that document long-term continuing programs of NMFS; intensive scientific reports on studies of restricted scope; papers on applied fishery problems; technical reports of general interest intended to aid conservation and management; reports that review in considerable detail and at a high technical level certain broad areas of research; and technical papers originating in economics studies and from management investigations. Since this is a formal series, all submitted papers receive peer review and those accepted receive professional editing before publication. Copies of NOAA Technical Reports NMFS are available free in limited numbers to governmental agencies, both Federal and State. They are also available in exchange for other scientific and technical publications in the marine sciences.

CHAS. SC 29408-2623 PREFACE The United States and Japanese counterpart panels on aquaculture were formed in 1969 under the United States-Japan Cooperative Program in Natural Resources (UJNR). The panels currently include specialists drawn from the federal departments most concerned with aquaculture. Charged with exploring and developing bilateral cooperation, the panels have focused their efforts on exchanging information related to aquaculture which could be of benefit to both countries. The UJNR was begun during the Third Cabinet-Level Meeting of the joint United States-Japan Committee on Trade and Economic Affairs in January 1964. In addition to aqua- culture, current subjects in the program include desalination of seawater, toxic microorganisms, air pollution, energy, forage crops, national park management, mycoplasmosis, wind and seismic effects, protein resources, forestry, and several joint panels and committees in marine resources research, development, and utilization. Accomplishments include: Increased communication and cooperation among technical specialists; exchanges of information, data, and research findings; annual meetings of the panels, a policy-coordinative body; administrative staff meetings; exchanges of equipment, materials, and samples; several major technical conferences; and beneficial effects on international relations.

Rochester, WA 98579 ABSTRACT Inbreeding is an important part of any selection and breeding program designed to improve aquacultural broodstock. A decrease in freshwater and saltwater growth rate was noted in a strain of coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, undergoing selection to improve these traits for commercial production. Thus, an investigation was undertaken to estimate the level of inbreeding in this strain and to assess different approaches to alleviate problematic levels of inbreeding. Estimation of inbreeding level was conducted via pedigree analysis and change in heterozygosity of elctrophoretically detected ser-um proteins variants of odd- and even-year lines of coho salmon. The two methods of analysis indicated vastly different inbreeding levels. However, pedigree analysis, the more accurate of the two methods, estimated inbreeding levels not anticipated to cause the observed depression in growth traits. Two approaches, interstock crosses and crosses between parallel -selected lines, were assessed for alleviation of inbreeding problems. Both types of crosses decrease the level of inbreeding, but the performance of the two types of crosses dif- fered greatly. Crosses between unrelated year classes of the selected stock showed positive heterotic effects, while the outcrosses with unrelated lines yielded negative heterotic effects. These results indicate that careful attention should be given to the selection of the founding populations from which broodstocks are developed and that subsequent breeding information be collected to pro- duce pedigrees for population maintenance. Furthermore, the production of parallel \"in-house\" lines, may provide the best method of minimizing inbreeding without diluting selection gains. Introduction result in increased inbreeding levels (Falconer 1981), where the magnitude will depend on the genetic characteristics Inbreeding is integral to any selection and breeding pro- of the population and the severity of the constraints im- gram designed for the development of broodstock.

THORGAARD Department of Zoology and Program in Genetics and Cell Biology Washington State University Pullman, WA 99164-4220 ABSTRACT Techniques to manipulate chromosome sets and produce polyploid fishes or fishes with all the inheritance from the female or male parent have been exploited in aquaculture in recent years. Some of the principal applications of this work have been to produce sterile fish or to produce monosex populations. Three additional applications of chromosome set manipulation that we have explored in salmonids in our laboratory and in collaboration with other laboratories have been 1) increased survival in triploid hybrids; 2) the potential for gene transfer by \"incomplete gynogenesis\"; and 3) the generation of homozygous diploids and ultimately homozygous clones through androgenesis (all-paternal inheritance). A number of researchers have demonstrated that interspecific triploid fish hybrids survive better than the corresponding diploid hybrids. Notable examples of this phenomenon include the tiger trout (brown trout x brook trout) hybrid, the rainbow trout x coho salmon hybrid, and the chum salmon x chinook salmon hybrid. The tiger trout has considerable potential as a sport fish and may be advantageous because both the diploid and triploid hybrids are essentially sterile. The rainbow trout x coho salmon hybrid has increased resistance to IHN (infectious hernatopoietic necrosis) virus characteristic of the coho salmon parent. The chum salmon x chinook salmon hybrid has early seawater tolerance characteristic of the chum salmon parent. Gynogenesis (all-maternal inheritance) experiments have normally involved complete inactiva- tion of the paternal genome by radiation or chemical treatment of the sperm. However, we have demonstrated that if a lower than normal radiation treatment is applied to the sperm, some paternal genes may still be active in the progeny. This has been demonstrated for both pigmentation and isozyme loci. It appears that the paternal genes in this situation are located on chromosomal fragments which are lost during development. If the paternal genes can be stably inherited and if desirable paternal traits can be selected for, this \"incomplete gyogenesis\" might potentially be used to transfer desirable traits between species. Androgenesis is induced by fertilizing radiation-inactivated eggs with normal sperm and by applying a pressure or heat treatment to block the first cleavage division and produce homo- zygous diploids. We have successfully induced androgenesis in rainbow trout and have also pro- duced androgenetic progeny from homozygous androgenetic males. Androgenesis has a number of distinctive applications for aquaculture, including generation of homozygous clones and recovery of strains from cryogenically preserved sperm. 9 Outcrossed Lines of the Hard Clam Mercenaria mercenaria ROBERT T. DILLON Jr. Department of Biology College of Charleston Charleston, SC 29424 JOHN J. MANZI Marine Resources Research Institute Charleston, SC 29412 ABSTRACT A large-scale breeding program has been initiated in South Carolina to achieve improved growth and survival of the hard clams, M. mercenaria. This interdisciplinary, multi-institutional program uses the facilities and personnel of the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Research Institute, the College of Charleston, the University of South Carolina, and Clemson University. Nursery stocks of hard clams that had been selected for fast growth were obtained from Aquaculture Research Corporation (\"ARC\" - Dennis, MA) and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (\"VIMS\" - Wachapreague, VA). These stocks were compared to corresponding wild populations for allele frequencies at seven polymorphic enzyme loci. Although as few as 30-60 parents were spawned at each of four generations to produce these two broodstocks, neither line exhibited any reduction in heterozygosity. Both lines, however, showed evidence of genetic drift and loss of rare alleles, suggesting that crosses between them could result in genetically distinct lines. ARC and VIMS stocks were spawned on three occasions at different times of the year for pro- duction of both reciprocal outbred and pure control lines. Growth and survival were monitored regularly over two years. Early growth was strongly influenced by time of spawning, and as such was not a reliable indicator of subsequent growth. Most significant disparities between trials decreased as the lines aged. At 21 months, outbred and purebred lines were not consistently different in their heterozygosity, mean size, or size variance. Within crosses, little relationship was detected between shell length and heterozygosity aver- aged over the seven enzyme loci. However, significant differences between the largest and smallest clams were detected at individual loci in 10 of 42 tests. Results were consistent neither with the hypothesis that the alleles themselves were affecting growth, nor with the hypothesis that these enzyme loci were tightly linked to other loci affecting growth. Rather, it appears that alleles are marking the entire genomes of their parents, and that variation in the growth rates of the off- spring from individual clams may be obscuring any relationship with overall heterozygosity. A Preliminary Study on Genetics of Two Types of the Rotifer Brachionus plicatilis YONG FU, YUTAKA NATSUKARI, and KAZUTSUGU HIRAYAMA Faculty of Fisheries Nagasaki University Bunkyomachi, Nagasaki Nagasaki 852, Japan ABSTRACT The domesticated rotifer Brachionus plicatilis can be divided roughly into two types, called L and S, using morphological differences in the shape of anterior spines on the lorica (obtuse angled and pointed, respectively). However, differences in growth responses with respect to environmental factors make this method unreliable, We have, therefore, tried to clarify differ- ences at the genetic level between types, using starch gel electrophoresis of enzymes. Thirty-four collected strains were separated by three methods into the two types. Initially, strains were qualitatively judged with respect to differences in the shape of anterior spines. Afterwards pure strains were cultured parthenogenetically and re-evaluated using the second method (quan- titative). To accomplish this, morphological features were measured, the ratios of which created an index for comparison of the strains (cluster analysis). Both the anterior spine and cluster analysis indicated that the 34 strains were composed of two large clusters consisting of 15 L and 19 S strains. Allozyme variations of the 34 strains were then detected by horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. Nine isozyme loci were recognized. Of the 42 alleles observed, 15 alleles over 6 loci showed great differences between L- and S-types. Using genetic distances according to the allele frequencies of 42 alleles, a dendrogram was drawn. The strains separated into two groups. One group con- sisted of only S-type strains, the other group was subdivided again into 3 clusters. One of these three clusters consisted only of the S-type strains, while the other two contained only L-type strains. This result indicates the great genetic differences between L and S strains. Introduction not to genetic differences. However, Fukusho and Okauchi (1982, 1983, 1984) have provided evidence that differences Since the introduction of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis to may be genetic and that the two types can be isolated from nourish larval fish, aquaculturists have increased scientific each other. In countries outside Japan, many scientists attention on this organism.

Present Status of Genetic Studies on Marine Finfish in Japan KUNIHIKO FUKUSHO National Research Institute of Aquaculture Fisheries Agency Nakatsuhama, Nansei-cho, Watarai-gun, Mie 516-01 Japan ABSTRACT The present paper briefly introduces the status of genetic breeding of marine finfish in Japan. The domestication of exotic species is also described. Selection is the most successful technique of genetic breeding for marine finfish, even though limited scientific data and experimental results have been reported. Selection was conducted on red sea bream, I'agrus major, and Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, and their selected strains were supplied for industrial culture. Experiments on hybridization leading to heterosis were conducted as well as interspecific, intergeneric, inter- family, back and reciprocal crosses. Few of these hybrids, however, have been widely used by the industry, except the P. major x crimson sea bream, Evynnisjaponicus. Chromosome manipu- lation studies such as triploid production and all female production by gynogenesis have been conducted since 1984 in Japan. These technologies are strongly expected to be adopted in in- dustrial culture, even though they are currently experimental. Exotic species or strains of marine finfish have been introduced to Japan and cultured in recent years. Most marine species are imported to supply seed where local production is inadequate, not to introduce a new industrial target species or strain, except the red sea bream. Cryopreservation of sperm is used in most hybridization studies, induction of gynogeriesis, and triploid production. This technology will no doubt be adopted in androgenesis and gene bank projects for marine finfish. Introduction tools for improving fish quality.

WIRKKULA Department of Microbiology Oregon State University Corvallis, Oregon 97331-3804 ABSTRACT Viral pathogens in aquaculture have largely been controlled by the culling and destruction of carriers and infected animals and eggs. Because most viral pathogens in aquaculture are trans- mitted via water and because sensitive animals reside in the neighboring waters, the administra- tion of attenuated viral vaccines has not been feasible. Attenuated vaccines require costly trials to assure that these modified live viruses are nonvirulent in all species and that reversion to virulence does not occur. Killed viral vaccines have been too expensive to produce for the aquaculture industry. Thus, subunit viral vaccines developed by recombinant DNA techniques are attractive alternatives for the industry. These vaccines are nonreplicating and inexpensive to produce. The molecular cloning and expression of viral genes in several host vector systems for the develop- ment of subunit viral vaccines for aquaculture has been the primary research focus of the authors' laboratory. Work on the development of such vaccines for infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), a fish rhabdovirus, and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), a fish birnavirus, is presented. Laboratory tests of both vaccines in vivo have indicated that fish develop protective immunity to live virus after vaccination.

Several factors increase the possibility of rapid (often detrimental) genetic change in cultured populations, but genetic considerations are often overlooked in the effor"
