        "text": "Developing technology for defending the nation from missile threats\n\nWe develop and assess integrated systems for defense against missiles and other threats. Our activities include investigating system architectures, developing advanced sensor and decision support systems, making field measurements, and assessing deployed system capabilities.\n\nAir, Missile, and Maritime Defense Technology Groups\n\nAdvanced Concepts and Technologies\n\nAdvanced Sensor Systems and Test Beds\n\nAdvanced Undersea Systems and Technology\n\nIntegrated Missile Defense Technology\n\nInterceptor and Sensor Technology\n\nKwajalein Field Site\n\nSystems and Architectures\n\nOur expertise is in developing radar, electronic warfare, and system-of-systems technologies for future integrated air and missile defense systems. We design highly digitized phased array radars, equipped with advanced signal processing and electronic protection, for the next generation of land, shipboard, and airborne sensors.\n\nSensors play a critical role in air and ballistic missile defense by detecting, tracking, and characterizing threats. Our staff design, develop, and prototype innovative advanced sensor systems and employment architectures for air defense systems and the U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System.\n\nWe develop and assess innovative technology to support the U.S. Navy and Department of Defense's undersea and counter-undersea missions. Our expertise lies in acoustic and non-acoustic sensors, undersea networks, autonomous systems, and advanced signal processing.\n\nTo help defend our nation, deployed forces, and allies from ballistic missile attacks, we support the Missile Defense Agency in the development, deployment, testing, and enhancement of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). We continuously develop and enhance BMDS elements to enable them to keep up with rapidly evolving threats.\n\nWe assist the Missile Defense Agency and the U.S. military with protecting the country and our forces by developing advanced technologies that enable air and missile defense systems to identify, track, and intercept potential threats.\n\nKwajalein Field Site serves as the scientific advisor to the Reagan Test Site at the U.S. Army Garrison - Kwajalein Atoll, located 2,500 miles west-southwest of Hawaii. The site's radars, optics, and telemetry systems support missile testing, space surveillance and testing, satellite launches, and scientific measurements.\n\nTo protect our nation, deployed forces, and allies in air, missile, and maritime engagements, our group defines future defense architectures, develops new algorithms, and identifies applications for new technologies to enhance the United States’ defenses against potential threats.\n\nFeatured Projects\n\nradar\n\nWind Turbine Interference–Mitigation Study\n\nA strategy for lessening wind turbines’ effects on the performance of an aircraft measurement system at a naval air station on the Chesapeake Bay could inform future research into interference mitigation for other radar applications.\n\nRF technology\n\nDual-Use Waveforms for Radar Detection and Wireless Communication\n\nNew waveforms enable efficient spectrum sharing between radars sensing moving objects and wireless communications systems transmitting data.\n\nradar\n\nKwajalein Modernization and Remoting Program Radar Open System Architecture\n\nWe developed an open system architecture that reduces the complexity and cost of operations at the Reagan Test Site.\n\ndecision support\n\nReagan Test Site Automation and Decision Support\n\nNew software tools provide test operators with automated decision support for directing sensors during increasingly complex tests conducted at the Reagan Test Site.\n\nLaboratory Stories\n\nWith the Laboratory sitting on the boundary of academia and industry, I can observe and participate in various areas of cutting-edge research and see some of that work implemented in the real world.\n\nJames Casey\n\nData Scientist\n\nAir, Missile, and Maritime Defense Technology\n\nAdvanced Undersea Systems and Technology\n\nI appreciate having the support of my group leaders, who assign me tasks that let me take the lead and who trust me to make decisions on their behalf.\n\nJulia Kiernan\n\nGroup Administrative Assistant\n\nAir, Missile, and Maritime Defense Technology\n\nAdvanced Sensor Systems and Test Beds\n\nWhere else can you be on the cutting edge of technologies that keep us out of harm’s way and give us the sanctuary that we all deserve?\n\nMichele Gruber\n\nGraphic Artist\n\nAir, Missile, and Maritime Defense Technology\n\nSystems and Architectures\n\nOne of the fantastic aspects of being a Laboratory employee is that there are opportunities to work on a wide variety of projects.\n\nBenjamin Evans\n\nSignal Processing Researcher\n\nAir, Missile, and Maritime Defense Technology\n\nAdvanced Undersea Systems and Technology\n\nAdvancing Our Research\n\nEvents\n\nLeadership\n\nView the leadership of the Air, Missile, and Maritime Defense Technology research area.\n\nFeatured Publications\n\nBackdoor poisoning of encrypted traffic classifiers\n\nIEEE Intl. Conf. Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW, 28 Nov. - 1 Dec. 2022.\n\nProbabilistic coordination of heterogeneous teams from capability temporal logic specifications\n\nIEEE Robot. Autom. Lett., Vol. 7, No. 2, April 2022, pp. 1190-7.\n\nOur Staff\n\nView the biographies of members of the Air, Missile, and Maritime Defense Technology research area."
