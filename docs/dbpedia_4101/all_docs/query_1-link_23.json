But if your organisation establishes effective crisis preparation, you can mitigate potential risks ‚Äî and even emerge stronger.\" - PwC U.S. Army Garrison - Aberdeen Proving Ground proved they are #crisisready with the ability to provide quick response to incidents that may impact the installation. Full-scale exercises like this one are necessary to test installation emergency response, and recovery systems and capabilities. Many lessons were learned through the exercise that will help #APG develop a more thorough approach to how we handle the initial impact of a crisis and speed up recovery. We thank our U.S. Army Installation Management Command-led evaluation team for their guidance, support and tactful feedback. We also give a huge shoutout to various partners for their support including organizations from the Harford County Government and the American Red Cross. #crisiscommunication #wearegarrison #emergencyservices #crisisresponse Omar Jones Robert L Edmonson II David Stainback U.S. Army DEVCOM 20th CBRNE Command U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) U.S. Army DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory\n\nWhat an amazing #EarthDay celebration we had.

As a result, apg has been recognized with the arbor day foundation‚Äôs tree city award for the 19th year in a row. #TeamAPG's Earth Day event included interactive activities, handouts, games, and interactive displays featuring all four divisions of the APG Directorate of Public Works.\n\nThis week we are recognizing outstanding garrison all-star employee, Kim Ford, for her time and commitment to the Garrison and Aberdeen Proving Ground!
