Human Resource Development

Women in the Workplace: Women in Manufacturing

Factories are mainly for men, right? Wrong! At the Oppama Plant, a variety of women are active.

Female leaders, working mothers, and a variety of people from young to experienced are working on site as "Monozukuri Girls".

The Oppama Plant supports women who seek to work in a stimulating and rewarding environment.

Coexistence of R&D, experimentation, and production SCM

The Oppama Plant not only produces cars, but also has a general research center for advanced technology research, the Oppama Proving Ground (test course) where you can check the safety and performance of cars and experience the fun of cars. It also has a dedicated wharf where about 20,000 cars can be stored and three car carriers can dock.

Mechanism improvement (Kaizen)

With the wisdom and technology of the employees working on the production line, we are constantly creating devices that use natural energy, cogs, the principle of leverage, and other structures and mechanisms to improve safety and productivity.

At the Karakuri Kaizen Kufu Exhibition 2020, "Aim and Tilt" won the Excellence Award.

10â The special summer event has been conducted!â

How have you getting along with the continuing harsh summer heat lately?

In this summer, we are carrying out âOn-line Tour of Oppama Plantâ which you can participate in the Plant Tour from home!

On July 17th, as an special event, we had âLet's ask these Experts! We are the Research Team of Oppama Plant!â, the event which these expert members who work at the plant answer questions from our guests.

There were a lot of questions such as âWhat was your childhood dream?â, âWhat is the hardest thing when you are working?â, and more from these children who attended the events, and the Experts members also had a fun time thereâª

We asked these Expert members who attended the on-line tour about the impression of the event!

It is said that children leave cars, but I was surprised they were familiar with Nissan cars.

I think that it is necessary not only to manufacture the vehicles but also to study about complete structure of them.

It was a valuable experience for me, and I realized that they have high interest in Nissan cars as their questions were really specific.

We will do our best to make our workplace more amazing for those who attend our Plant Tours.

I was surprised that these children were very knowledgeable when we talked with them.

I would like to appreciate these Nissan funs children's feelings and keep manufacturing high quality and attractive cars in the future.

We are planning special tours on national holidays and etc.

We will inform you detailed information by posting on our Plant Tour Reservation Site.

Please check it and we are looking forward to your participation!
