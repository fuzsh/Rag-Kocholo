A New Score

Along with its restoration, the National Library of Medicine commissioned a musical sound track for the film—following the traditional silent-film practice of screening films with live musical accompaniment.

The Snark Ensemble also recorded the score for the sound track. Watch the film with the 2011 soundtrack.

Prior to recording the sound track for The Reward of Courage, Maurice Saylor and the Snark Ensemble had composed and recorded soundtracks for DVD collections of early silent movie stars including Harry Langdon and Charley Chase. The Harry Langdon Collection: Lost and Found (Alexandria, VA: Allday Entertainment, 2007). Becoming Charley Chase (Alexandria, VA: Allday Entertainment, 2009).
