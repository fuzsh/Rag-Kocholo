        "text": "The book begins with a Confederate scout and his job was to locate the position of the North and count the number of soldiers. The scout takes the information and informs the confederate generals. General James Longstreet wanted to go north to Gettysburg to plan a defense but General Lee wanted to attack instead. The union General, General Buford at the same time rode to Gettysburg to realize the confederates were getting close so he quickly came up with a plan to move to a hill to set up and wait for the confederate army. Unfortunately, the Confederates failed to obtain the high ground on the hills, which allowed the Union army to take defensive action. The novel goes back to when General Lee was wanting to attack the union army and Gen. Longstreet trying to convince Lee that it wasn 't the best option. Gen. Longstreet thought it\n\nAfter several volleys, I received notice from Lieutenant James H. Nichols, commander of Company K of the 20th and Major Ellis Spears, commander of the left wing of the 20th Maine, and a messenger sent by Captain Orpheus S. Woodward, commanding officer of the 83rd Pennsylvania, of some suspicious flanking movement by the Confederate forces . I climbed up on a large boulder and saw that while three left companies of the enemy were keeping a steady rate of fire along the front, several were moving to the left end of our men. To avoid being flanked, I ordered my companies to side-step paces to the left and Companies A, H, C, G, and the F, the Colors Company to refuse to the left at a right angle, doubling the original regimental front .\n\nIn Killer Angels by Michael Shaara, James Longstreet is one of the most prominent characters in the novel. Longstreet, a Confederate General who was Lee’s second in command, is the main tactician on the Confederate side of the Civil War. Throughout the novel, Longstreet’s character is in a conflict with General Lee. Lee believes that the best way to win at Gettysburg is to pose an offensive campaign; whereas, Longstreet declares, “‘I have been under the impression that it would be our strategy to conduct a defensive campaign, whenever possible, in order to keep this army intact (111).’” In addition to the internal conflict in the Confederate army, Longstreet’s purpose is to also be the voice of reason.\n\nGeneral Beauregard saw a battalion of troops advancing towards him. With both the Confederate and Union flags looking so similar, he wasn’t sure which side these men were on. It wasn’t until he was about to order retreat when a gust of wind unfurled the flag, showing the colors of the Confederate States of America. With this new influx of fresh troops, the Confederates were able to push back the Union. The Union army was not prepared for the new troops arriving, and a retreat was immenent. The Union army fled, but inexperience turned into chaos, with no one retreating with any organization. They were lucky. The Confederates were also mostly green to battle, and their inexperience and disorganization made them unable to pursue the Union\n\nThe book The killer Angels by Michael Shaara depicts an accurate picture of what it's like to fight in the Civil War. Shaara not only describes the horrifying experience the characters had to endure during the Battle of Gettysburg, but also the motives behind the character's acts and decisions. The majority of the book is spent describing Joshua Chamberlain, James Longstreet, and Robert E. Lee. Longstreet and Lee fought on the Confederate side and Chamberlain fought for the Union. One of the conflicts in the novel involves Longstreet’s spy and Lee. Lee isn't sure whether to believe Longstreet’s shady spy that claims the Union army is moving close to the Confederates. The book was made very interesting by having characters fighting for opposing\n\nLate in the afternoon troops started to approach Beauregard. He prepared to retreat, unsure whose army the soldiers belonged to(“Battle Of”). Early in the civil war, the Union and Confederate flags were very similar in design and color and it was very hard to tell the difference between the two. Both flags had stripes and a blue square in the corner. The additional natural chaos of the battlefield didn't help with the confusion(“Not”). As the troops got closer to Beauregard he could see that the troops belonged to the Confederacy and that it was Johnston with reinforcements. The new addition to the Confederate’s force gave them the upper hand and they attacked the unsuspecting Union army(“Battle Of”). Colonel James Brown charged into the Union line into a section of confused New Yorkers(“The”). The union army was forced into a chaotic retreat. The also disorganized Confederates did not pursue the fleeing army(“Battle Of”). The disorganized Union army ran into panicking citizens who had started to flee upon seeing the Union's defeat. Along with the narrow bridges, overturned wagons, and cannons the citizens of Washington DC made the retreat nearly\n\nMilitary tactics and strategies are depicted in a historically accurate way for both the union and confederate armies. The rank of a Civil War soldier indicated his duties and responsibilities within the army. The vast majority of men who fought in the civil war were enlisted men who fought as soldiers. Above them were non-commissioned officers and commissioned officers. While officers had more prestige than soldiers, they also had a lot more responsibilities, since they were accountable for all the soldiers under their command. In the movie we can see that General Robert E. Lee and General Reynolds are clearly in control and have the highest control of dictating soldiers, with who have lower ranks. Furthermore this attribute can be further seen when Colonel Chamberlain (in the Union army) speaks to the 20th Main, on whether they should continue to fight with the Union. The motivational speech emotionally expatiated, indicates the true power and ability high ranked soldiers have during the Civil War. The speech is clearly able to motivate and persuade the young men to fight against the Confederates. This ranking hierarchy\n\nHistory is usually written by the victors of war. The Civil War is no different. We often hear stories about the famous Iron Brigade and its tenacious fighting ability or of the “fighting” 69th Irish Regiment of New York but many historians have overlooked the epic sacrifices Southern soldiers endured. Sure, everyone has heard of Robert E. Lee or “Stonewall” Jackson, but the men under their command are the reasons for their fame. Many times, the men from a certain geographical region are grouped together, whose combined regiments formed brigades. This paper is a tribute to the men of North Carolina who, gave their lives fighting for the Confederate cause; with a focus on the 28th Regiment of North\n\nThe poet Wilfred Owen was one of many poets who were against war. He reflected this idea of anti-war in his poems, one of his poems called “Anthem for Doomed Youth”, mirrors most aspects of war all put together in this short still deep poem. An example of that would be when the speaker stated,” What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?”(1) The speaker asks is there any sound that marks our soldier’s death other than the sounds of church bell’s which are mostly rung to represent somebody’s absence? Clearly, the speaker sets anger as the tone of the poem through this question to show that soldier’s death is unremarkable.. The speaker compares the soldiers to a “cattle” which illustrates that soldiers are treated more like animals with no feelings and also shows how they are killed indiscriminately in war. Finally the line ironically contains an iambic pentameter which is a natural rhythm for such dark, grim, dull subject. The two novels, The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane, and All Quiet on The Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque, both present a similar idea of how soldiers are killed out there in the front comprehensively and the dehumanization of war towards its soldiers. The first novel is set during the Civil War, and it focuses on the psychological aspects of one soldier named Henry Fleming and how his naive thoughts about war constantly change through the course of the novel. The second novel presents the life of a soldier named Paul Baumer and his\n\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was amongst one the most important turning points during the Civil War. It was a three-day bloody battle between the Union and Confederate forces which would ultimately lead up to the victory of the Union. In The Killer Angels, Michael Shaara shows a depiction of the battle through the eyes of the officers and tries to give the reader a first-hand look into the daily struggles that they had to deal with when it came to distinguishing between what’s best for their men and chances of success in the battle. In the book, we are introduced with two important officers: Colonel Chamberlain of the Union force, and General Lee of the Confederate force. Throughout the book, we witness different leadership strategies and philosophies between both officers which ultimately serve as their road to success or failure in the battle. Focusing on General Lee’s philosophy on leadership, “To be a good soldier, you must love the army. But to be a good officer you must be willing to order the death of the thing you love.”, it reinforces the idea that in order to fully succeed at battle, you must set aside and sacrifice your sense of sympathy towards your soldiers as a way to avoid making emotional decisions.\n\nHe also further articulates the loss of war morals with his discussion of this sea-faring battle between the North and South. The Union soldiers were silent, and “behind each man a holy angel stood” (2/5). There is foreshadowing of death in the phrase “Dim buoys give hint of death below” (2/5). The Union sends a surprise ambush, which Melville calls an “evil art” (2/5). The attack struck through the “loyal crews” (2/5). He proves this learned “deadlier lore” (1/5) when the Union army showed no guilt during their “glorifying hour” (2/5). He calls them “traitors” (2/5) for killing noble soldiers, who were just performing their duties. The South thus attempts to mimic this “evil art” (2/5) by sending a lone battleship of “solid Ram of iron and oak” (2/5), while the Union sends out their “wooden Hartford” (2/5). He uses terms, such as “wooden” and “oak”, to symbolize nobility and goodness, while using the term “iron” to signify evil and hate (2/5). The Tennessee was sent out alone, entrusted with its hateful “iron bark” (2/5). In the end, the iron armor was not impenetrable. With the use of heavenly images, Melville seems to imply that evil and hateful acts do not go unpunished. Melville favors the North, thus is why the angels, who are imaginatively built into this story, only stood behind the Union soldiers. Here, he leaves it up to the audience to decide which side they believe is more evil. Melville inputs this phrase--“pale on the scarred fleet’s decks there lay” (2/5)—to remind his audience that victory did not come without a costly price. This sea battle killed many noble soldiers, who now lay “quiet far below the wave”"
