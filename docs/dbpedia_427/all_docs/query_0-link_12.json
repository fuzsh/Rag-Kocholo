        "text": "See SCM H 2230 Visual materials and non-music sound recordings and the new [Oct. 2007] SCM H 1913 Moving Image Genre/Form Headings. To summarize:\n\nH 2230\n\na. Assign subject headings for all important topics mentioned in the summary statement (520 field).\n\nb. If a specific topic is emphasized in order to illustrate a more general concept, assign subject headings for both the specific and the general topics.\n\nH 1913\n\na. Assign genre/form headings to both fiction and nonfiction works. \"Headings may be assigned from different levels of the same hierarchy if desired.\"\n\nb. In addition, assign one of the headings from the following list:\n\n655 _0 ‡a Fiction films.\n\n655 _0 ‡a Nonfiction films.\n\n655 _0 ‡a Fiction television programs.\n\n655 _0 ‡a Nonfiction television programs.\n\n\"Films\" as an LC genre term applies to works originally released as motion pictures, video, or digitally (e.g. YouTube). \"Television programs\" applies only to works that were originially telecast.\n\nc. For films assign either 655 _0 ‡a Short films (anything less than 40 min.) or 655 _0 ‡a Feature films (40 min. or longer). Note that these terms are now assigned to both fiction and non-fiction films. (Until the new H 1913, Feature films was assigned only to fiction films 40 min. or longer)\n\nH 2230 gives the following example; a form/genre heading should now be added:\n\n520 ‡a Describes the highlights of Colombia, including the production of coffee. 651 0 ‡a Colombia ‡x Description and travel. 650 0 ‡a Coffee ‡z Colombia. 655 0 ‡a Nonfiction television programs.\n\n3. When a topic is discussed in conjunction with a particular place, make, insofar as possible, a subject entry under both the topic and the place.\n\n245 0 0 ‡a American dream ‡h [videorecording] / ‡c directed by Barbara Kopple ; produced by Barbara Kopple and Arthur Cohn. 520 ‡a In this Academy Award winner for best documentary in 1991, the true-life story of the 1985-1986 workers' strike against Geo. A. Hormel & Company in Austin, Minnesota is documented from beginning to end. When Geo. A. Hormel & Company made $2 million in profits, then cut its workers' salaries by $2.00 an hour each, the workers had only one option: Go out on strike. 650 0 ‡a Geo. A. Hormel & Company Strike, Austin, Minn., 1985-1986. 610 2 0 ‡a Geo. A. Hormel & Company. 610 2 0 ‡a United Packinghouse, Food, and Allied Workers. ‡b Local 9 (Austin, Minn.) 650 0 ‡a Strikes and lockouts ‡x Packing-house workers ‡z Minnesota ‡z Austin. 650 0 ‡a Packing-house workers ‡x Labor unions ‡z Minnesota ‡z Austin. 650 0 ‡a Industrial relations ‡z Minnesota ‡z Austin. 651 0 ‡a Austin (Minn.) ‡x Economic conditions ‡y 20th century. 655 0 ‡a Feature films. 655 0 ‡a Nonfiction films.\n\n4. When a particular person is treated as illustrative of a profession or activity, assign a heading for both the person and the field of endeavor. However, do not treat as a biography (i.e., no --Biography subdivision).\n\n520 ‡a The message of the Los Angeles evangelist who preached to thousands in the 1920s. 600 1 0 ‡a McPherson, Aimee Semple, ‡d 1890-1944. 650 0 ‡a Evangelists ‡z United States. 655 0 ‡a Short films. 655 0 ‡a Nonfiction films.\n\n5. Fiction films. Assign a) & b) as appropriate. Assign in the order listed if more than one is assigned.\n\na) Use subdivision ‡vDrama after topical subjects to the same extent you would use it for a drama in book form. SCM:SH H 1870 sec. 4: \"Bring out the topic of an individual play by assigning headings of the type described in sec. 3 [i.e. \"[topic]--Drama or [topic]--Juvenile drama. Use headings of this type as the standard means of designating topics in drama, for example, Alcoholism--Drama; Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865--Drama; Holmes, Sherlock (Fictitious character)--Drama; Brontë family--Drama.\" ]\n\nb.) Assign form headings for genre (Comedy films; Western films) or for technique (Silent films, Experimental films). Use 655 _0. The heading must be established by LC; the most up-to-date list is in OCLC authorities (search on the genre index). If the heading has not been established as 155 by LC, use the 150 heading if available and tag as 650.\n\nIt is not correct practice to subdivide form/genre headings geographically to indicate that the film is about or produced in a given place. (Not documented in H 2230, but apparently LC practice based on records in LCDB)\n\n245 0 4 ‡a The red badge of courage ‡h [videorecording] / ‡c Metro Goldwyn Mayer ; produced by Gottfried Reinhardt ; directed by John Huston ; screenplay by John Huston ; adaptation by Albert Band. 651 0 ‡a United States ‡x History ‡y Civil War, 1861-1865 ‡v Drama. 650 0 ‡a War films. <655 is not yet established; use 650 for the time being> 655 0 ‡a Fiction films. 655 0 ‡a Feature films.\n\n6. Assign Films for the hearing impaired or Television programs for the hearing impaired to all videos produced with captions or sign language for viewing by the hearing impaired.\n\nNote that the new definition for \"Films\" and \"Television programs\" is applied here as well. Films: a video originally released as a motion picture, or as a video, or digitally. Television programs: a work originally telecasted.\n\nNote that the form heading [tag as 650] Video recordings for the hearing impaired is now obsolete & should not be assigned as either 650 or 655. Note that ... for the hearing impaired is not assigned if the video only has subtitles for foreign language films; the form heading should only be assigned when justified by the 546 note Closed-captioned.\n\n7. Assign as a form heading either Films for people with visual disabilities or Television programs for people with visual disabilities to all films with additional audio description provided for the visually handicapped.\n\nNote: The heading Videos for people with visual disabilities is now obsolete.\n\n8. Foreign language teaching films. Assign the heading [...] language–Films for [...] speakers as the first heading, and bring out any special topics by assigning additional headings.\n\n520 ‡a Offers a tour of France including Paris, Alsace, Burgundy, the Riviera, Provence, the Pyrenees, and the Breton and Norman coasts. The narration in English deals with the history and culture of France, the shorter narration in French is a simplified version of the English using a controlled vocabulary aimed at the first-year student, and is followed by the French text repeated with French subtitles of the narration. 650 0 ‡a French language ‡x Films for English speakers. 651 0 ‡a France ‡x Description and travel.\n\n9. Assign a 730 for videos of choreographic works. For choreographic works, see LCRI 25.5B."
