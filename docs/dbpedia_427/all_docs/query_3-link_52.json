        "text": "During the Silent Era, when most films dealt with dramatic or comedic takes on the “boy meets girl, boy loses girl” theme, other motion pictures dared to tackle such topics as rejuvenation, revivication, mesmerism, the supernatural and the grotesque. A Daughter of the Gods (1916), The Phantom of the Opera (1925), The Magician (1926) and Seven Footprints to Satan (1929) were among the unusual and startling films containing story elements that went far beyond the realm of “highly unlikely.” Using surviving documentation and their combined expertise, the authors catalog and discuss these departures from the norm in this encyclopedic guide to American horror, science fiction and fantasy in the years from 1913 through 1929.\n\nJohn T. Soister is a teacher of modern and classical languages, and lives in Denver, Colorado.\n\nHenry Nicolella, of Syracuse, New York, retired from a ministry of working for the homeless.\n\nSoftware developer Steve Joyce lives in Marietta, Georgia.\n\nHarry H Long lives in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He reviews DVDs for the Lebanon Daily News and is editor of two magazines: Scarlet: The Film Magazine and Van Helsing’s Journal.\n\nBill Chase is a library assistant at the Cleveland Public Library and lives in Cleveland, Ohio."
