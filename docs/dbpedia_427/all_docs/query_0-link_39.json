        "text": "Collected commentary. Headlines, images, and excerpts from news articles, editorials, official reports, addresses, and humor pieces reflect the broad span of opinion on the Red Scare and the campaign to define \"100% Americanism.\" To what extent was the Red Scare a reasoned response to the war's aftermath and radical activism? To what extent did it escalate into national hysteria? How did it resemble McCarthyism after World War Two and the patriotism campaign after September 11, 2001? Selections can be divided among students for research and classroom discussion. (12 pp.)\n\nPolitical cartoons. Eight political cartoons on the Red Scare reflect the perspective of mainstream America from 1919 to the mid-1920s. Who were the \"Reds\"? How did they threaten America? What should be done about the threat? What solutions, safeguards, and built-in remedies were portrayed by the cartoonists? Study the cartoons with the five other cartoon collections in this Theme DIVISIONS and complete the cartoon analysis chart. (Cartoons, 9 pp.; Chart: 2 pp.)\n\nBabbitt: the \"Good Citizens' League.\" Set in the fictional midwestern city of Zenith in 1920, Sinclair Lewis's classic novel Babbitt satirically portrayed the anxieties and adjustments of middle-class Americans after World War One. Many strove to define \"100% Americanism\" and insisted on frequent and unambiguous demonstrations of loyalty. Lewis placed his main character, real estate broker George Babbitt, in the middle of this frenzy. Struggling to identify his own political stance, Babbitt is caught between his newly adopted liberal views and his colleagues' demand that he join the local \"Good Citizens League.\" Note: the dialogue includes several swear words. (5 pp.)\n\nPolitical addresses on \"Americanism,\" 1919-1920. During World War One and in the runup to the 1920 presidential election, political leaders were invited by the U.S. State Department's Committee on Public Information to record short sections of speeches they had delivered on recent issues. The 78rpm records, produced by the Columbia Graphophone Company under the label Nation's Forum, were sold for two dollars and released at the rate of two per month—one Republican and one Democrat. Many are available in American Leaders Speak: Recordings from World War I and the 1920 Election, 1918-1920 from the Library of Congress, and many among them address the Bolshevik threat, citizen loyalty, and Americanism. We recommend that you begin with the two speeches below; each speech transcript appears at the bottom of the page. (See Supplemental Sites below for similar addresses in the collection.)\n\n- \"Americanism,\" Franklin D. Roosevelt (Democratic Party), former Asst. Secretary of the Navy; acceptance speech for the party's vice-presidential nomination, August 9, 1920 (4:21).\n\n- \"Americanism,\" Leonard Wood (Republican Party), U.S. Army major general; candidate for party's presidential nomination; undated speech, 1920 (4:10).\n\nSilent animated cartoons\n\n- Uncle Sam and the Bolsheviki-IWW Rat, Ford Motor Co., 1919. In this brief cartoon by the educational film division of the Ford Motor Company (Henry Ford was staunchly anti-union), farmer \"Uncle Sam\" points out bounteous harvests of grain, the \"fine results of our labor\" that symbolize American institutions. His attention is drawn to a huge malevolent rat chewing through the wall to devour the harvest. The rat is labeled \"Bolsheviki (I.W.W.),\" i.e., the International Workers of the World, the Communist-inspired labor union that espoused the destruction of capitalism. The farmer kills the rat with a shovel and exclaims that \"Bolshevists are the rats of civilization.\" Don't miss the excellent commentaries by Dr. Scott Simmon (University of California, Davis)—an overview to the right of the video screen and a voiceover with the cartoon video. Also note the commentary by Mark Marks on the music created for the cartoon by Dr. Brian Robison (MIT). (0.40) NATIONAL FILM PRESERVATION FOUNDATION\n\n- All Puzzled, 1925. Felix the Cat offers to help his human complete a crossword puzzle (a '20s fad) by finding the answer to a clue—a seven-letter word for \"Found Chiefly in Russia.\" Arriving in Russia through the kick of a helpful donkey, Felix discovers himself amidst Bolshevik revolutionaries and their bombs, one of which explodes and sends Felix flying home. \"Did you get the seven-letter word?\" asks his human. Felix shakes his head \"no.\" \"All I found in Russia was trouble\"—which is the answer to the puzzle clue: T-R-O-U-B-L-E. Note the caricature of the bomb-wielding Russian revolutionary.
