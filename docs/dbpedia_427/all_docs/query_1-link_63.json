        "text": "This work identifies 436 American silent films released between 1909 and 1929 that engaged the issues of militant labor and revolutionary radicalism. It begins with an extended introduction and analytical chapters that investigate the ways in which the American motion picture industry portrayed the interrelationships between labor radicals, exploitative capitalists, socialist idealists and Bolsheviks during this critical twenty-year period.\n\nEach entry contains a detailed plot synopsis, citations to primary sources, coding indicating the presence or absence of 14 predominant discernible biases (including anti- and pro-capitalism, socialism, revolution and labor), and subject coding keyed to 64 related terms and concepts (including agitators, Bolshevism, bombs, female radicals, militias, mobs, political refugees, and strikes). These statistical data included in the filmography are presented in a series of charts and are fully integrated into the historical-critical text. Total number and percentage statistics for the instances of these coded biases and traits are given per year, per era, and overall.\n\nAcknowledgments vii\n\nPreface 1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRed-Tinted Flickers of History 5\n\nCHAPTER 1 1\n\nA Red Blur: The Mixed Message on Class and Radicalism in Progressive Era Films, 1909–1917 21\n\nCHAPTER 2 2\n\nThe Red Scourge on Film: From Wartime Xenophobia to Being in the Vanguard of Anti-Bolshevik Hysteria, 1918–1920 71\n\nCHAPTER 3 3\n\nFrom the East to the East Side: White Flight from the Red Hordes to America, 1921–1929 111\n\nABOUT THE FILMOGRAPHY\n\nHow to Read the Filmography 139\n\nGlossary of Coding Terms 140\n\nYearly Film Totals, 1909–1929 144\n\nCoding Statistics, 1909–1917 144\n\nCoding Statistics, 1918–1920 146\n\nCoding Statistics, 1921–1929 147\n\nCoding Totals, 1909–1929 148\n\nPredominant Discernible Biases, 1909–1917 149\n\nPredominant Discernible Biases, 1918–1920 149\n\nPredominant Discernible Biases, 1921–1929 150\n\nPredominant Discernible Biases: Totals, 1909–1929 150\n\nTHE FILMOGRAPHY 151\n\nAppendix 1: Selected Foreign Films Released in the United States 1909–1915 283\n\nAppendix 2: Topical American Shorts, with Coding, 1918–1920 287\n\nAppendix 3: Selected American Fictional Shorts, 1921–1927 293\n\nNotes 297\n\nBibliography 319\n\nIndex 333\n\nChoice Outstanding Academic Title\n\n“this painstakingly researched book contains an extensive bibliography and index, as well as a comprehensive filmography with standard production information for individual, thematically coded entries and vital information about surviving film prints and their location.
