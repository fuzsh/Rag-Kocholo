Its early-detection-and-treatment message was embedded in a story that featured a nefarious “quack”, a credulous and vulnerable woman, a young couple thwarted in love, and a hard-headed businessman who comes to believe that clinics in the factory could improve workers health and productivity, reduce company costs, and detect cancers.

The restored film had a premiere at the National Academy of Sciences on November 10, 2011, with the composer Maurice Saylor leading a musical group playing the score he composed. The Snark Ensemble also recorded the score for the sound track. Watch the film with the 2011 soundtrack.\n\nPrior to recording the sound track for The Reward of Courage, Maurice Saylor and the Snark Ensemble had composed and recorded soundtracks for DVD collections of early silent movie stars including Harry Langdon and Charley Chase. The Harry Langdon Collection: Lost and Found (Alexandria, VA: Allday Entertainment, 2007). Becoming Charley Chase (Alexandria, VA: Allday Entertainment, 2009).
