        "text": "This post is for the Third Marathon Stars blogathon, hosted by The Wonderful World of Cinema, In the Good Old Days of Classic Hollywood, and Musings of a Classic Film Addict.\n\nAnna May Wong was one of the first Asian-American movie stars. Born Liu Tsong Wong in 1905 to a San Francisco family of second-generation Chinese immigrants, she was an avid film fan as a child. Dreaming of stardom, she secured her first job as an extra in the 1919 Alla Nazimova film The Red Lantern. By the early 1920s, her name was known to film fans due to her distinctive screen presence and youthful beauty, but due to the racist attitudes of the time, Wong’s stardom was often stunted. Due to concerns about miscegenation, she could only kiss her leading man if he was the same race as she. Major roles she was perfect for often went to white actresses by default, even if the character in question was Asian. And often times the roles she did land were either small or stereotypical.\n\nWong has experienced something of a re-evaluation recently– she’s become the first Asian-American on US currency and several books, both fiction and non-fiction, have been published about her in the last few years– but she still isn’t universally known, even among classic film fans. When two fellow classic film fans I know in real life saw me reading a biography about her, they told me they’d never even heard her name. Some critics continue to disparage her as a “dragon lady” who took demeaning roles for a paycheck. Others see her as a trailblazer who fought as hard as she could for better onscreen representation of Chinese and Chinese-descended characters at a time when Hollywood felt no compulsion to offer such.\n\nI’d been aware of Wong for years, though I never knew much about her life or work outside of a few key silent films. She often appears in movie magazines of the 1920s, presented as a madcap flapper in the latest fashions. For this marathon, I read biographical material on Wong while I went through my selected five films to give extra context to her work.\n\nOkay, I do have a confession to make. The maximum number of films you’re allowed to have seen with your selected star is three. When I signed up, I could only come up with three films I knew I had seen with Wong: The Toll of the Sea, The Thief of Bagdad, and Shanghai Express. I felt this blogathon would be a great opportunity to see some Wong pictures that had been on my watchlist for a while now, like Piccadilly and Daughter of Shanghai. It wasn’t until I combed through Wong’s IMDB page weeks later– after watching three of the five prescribed films and reading an entire biography– that I realized she was also in the 1924 Peter Pan, Mr. Wu, and Old San Francisco, three movies I vaguely recall watching as a college undergrad. And by vaguely recall, I mean I only know I saw two out of three of them because they’re logged on my IMDB account. As for Peter Pan, apparently she was Tiger Lily in that (I don’t recall a thing about her performance there), but all I remember from that film was that Ernest Torrance was Captain Hook and that the Darlings’ dog Nana looked like a Cthulu-esque abomination.\n\nAhem. Anyway, even if I don’t meet the hard letter of the “3 films max” rule, I still say I fit the spirit. I can recall exactly three performances of Anna May Wong’s, no more than that. I may as well have had those other films erased from my memory, except for…\n\nWith that out of the way, here are the films I actually remembering seeing with Wong before the blogathon, as well as a brief overview of her life and career threaded throughout:\n\nThe Toll of the Sea was not Wong’s big break as a movie star (that would belong to the anthology film Bits of Life, where she played opposite Lon Chaney), but it is the film that cemented her fame. The second Technicolor feature film, the movie’s story is nothing special, just a retelling of the Madame Butterfly story set in China instead of Japan. If anything elevates it above being a mere historical curiosity, it’s Wong’s tender performance as a seduced and abandoned young woman.\n\nWong was still in her teens when she made this film, so her performance is not as polished as her later work. However, she is still sensitive and touching, emphasizing the tragedy of Lotus Blossom’s situation as a woman shunned by her own culture for pursuing a relationship with a white man and similarly rejected by the white Americans for her ethnicity. Wong’s girlishly humorous moments in the first half of the movie only throw the constant grief and pain of the latter part into harsher relief. (At the time, Wong’s crying scenes were considered noteworthy both among critics and in Hollywood. As it turned out, Wong was one of a select number of actors who could cry on cue.) In the end, Wong walks away with the film, an impressive feat considering how young she was.\n\nUnfortunately, a leading role in one hit film did not mean Wong was suddenly going to be headlining tons of movies. Throughout the 1920s, her Hollywood career largely saw her in supporting parts, many of them steeped in orientalist stereotyping. The Thief of Bagdad is considered among her more memorable roles in this period, even if it’s a relatively minor one in the context of such a grand fantasy epic and is still stereotypical in nature. Wong plays a beautiful Mongolian slave girl in the Bagdad palace. While she is supposed to serve the princess, she conspires with the ambitious Mongolian prince (Sojin) to overthrow the Bagdad royals. It’s not much of a part and a lesser actress would have been overtaken by the character’s crazy costume and hairpieces, but Wong lends a playful sensual dimension to the role, particularly in a sequence where Fairbanks’ thief has a knife at her back. Wong’s response oscillates between fear and flirtation, using erotic charm to get herself out of the situation, not realizing Fairbanks has already left the room.\n\nThroughout the mid-1920s, Wong continued to act, though the roles weren’t getting any better. In the late 1920s, Wong grew weary of the situation and leapt across the Atlantic to seek better opportunities in Europe. Black Americans like Josephine Baker and Paul Robeson had done the same, finding less racial barriers abroad. Like Robeson, Wong mostly worked in England after a brief stint in Germany. When the talkie revolution swept through the movie industry, Wong worked on her vocal delivery and was able to make the transition with little trouble. In the early 1930s, more famous than ever due to her European journey, Wong decided to give Hollywood another go. She landed a contract with Paramount.\n\nOne of the better roles she got during this period was the prostitute Hui-Fei in Josef von Sternberg’s 1932 potboiler Shanghai Express. Having rewatched the film recently, I have two conclusions: 1) this movie is absolutely style over substance and 2) Wong walks away with the entire thing. The actual main storyline about Marlene Dietrich’s Shanghai Lily and her devotion to the stuffy nitwit doctor played by Clive Brook is melodramatic boilerplate only elevated to classic status by Dietrich’s charisma and the smoky, glamorous atmosphere of Von Sternberg’s direction.\n\nOf all the characters, Wong’s is the only one who measures up to Dietrich in any way. The two women play off one another well due to a shared sense of cynicism towards a world that looks down on them as “fallen women.” However, just as Lily’s self-sacrificial love for Dr. Harvey reveals nobility beneath her “bad girl” persona, Hui-Fei displays similar hidden depths. She has her own sense of honor and obligation, viewing the Eurasian rebel leader Henry Chang played by Warner Oland as a menace to her country (“The government has offered a price of 20,000 for his capture – alive or dead. It will be a great day for China when that price is paid.”) and ultimately killing him after he rapes her. When Lily thanks her– Chang was going to force Lily to become his mistress in exchange for her beloved’s life– Hui-Fei makes it clear she didn’t kill Chang for Lily’s sake, but for her own.\n\nUnfortunately, Hollywood continued to be stingy with good roles for Wong. The greatest heartbreak of her career was being rejected for the role of O-lan in MGM’s The Good Earth, an adaptation of the Pearl Buck novel of the same name. The tale of the hard lives of Chinese farmers, this was a film that largely treated the Chinese with sympathy, yet the major roles were claimed by white actors. Wong was refused the part because her leading man would be Paul Muni (a Jewish actor who initially quipped “I’m about as Chinese as Herbert Hoover” when offered the role) and the Production Code forbade actors of different races from kissing on-screen. Luise Rainer got the role instead.\n\nWong largely worked in B-pictures as the decade wore on. In the late 1930s, she visited China, a longtime dream of hers. However, she was shocked when her reception in China was rather cool, sometimes even hostile. Chinese critics felt Wong was a disgrace, taking on stereotypical and sexualized roles that made Chinese womanhood appear loose and wicked. Wong understood the criticism– she shared it herself– but it still stung, especially since she often fought for better representation of Chinese and Chinese-American characters in Hollywood projects.\n\nDuring World War II, Wong appeared in propaganda films showing the Chinese in a heroic light and did all she could to support the war effort, but her stardom was on the wane. When her Paramount contract lapsed, it was not renewed and she was stuck making films for poverty row studios. Still, Wong worked hard and donated her salary to organizations like United China Relief.\n\nIn the immediate postwar period, Wong stopped working in the movies for a few years. She converted her home into a series of apartments for rent. She returned to film in 1949, appearing in a small role in the movie Impact. Throughout the 1950s, she worked in television. This work was initially promising: Wong got the lead in her own series, The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong, the first TV program to feature an Asian-American protagonist. A mystery show, it lasted only ten episodes before cancellation. Like much early television, the program is now lost. For the rest of the decade, she had to settle for supporting parts.\n\nWong was unfortunately an alcoholic in her later life and this contributed to her early death of a heart attack at age 56. What makes her ultimate end so tragic is that she may have been on the verge of a comeback. She was offered the role of Madame Liang in the film version of Flower Drum Song, but had to decline due to her poor health.\n\nMy general impression of Wong from the above three films and my reading about her life is that she was a beautiful actress with great presence too often under-served by the material she was given. For my five films, I tried to select films from a variety of genres, as well as from different phases of her career in order to get a fuller picture of her talents and screen image.\n\nDaughter of Shanghai (dir. Robert Florey, 1937)\n\nWhen antiques dealer Mr. Lang (John Patterson) refuses to aid a human smuggling ring, he and his daughter Lan Ying Lin (Wong) end up kidnapped by the villains. They shoot Lang dead, but Lan Ying Lin manages to escape. Swearing justice for her father’s death, she goes undercover to track down the smugglers’ leader, disguising herself as a dancer to infiltrate a dive on a Central American island. She crosses paths with Kim Lee (Philip Ahn), a G-man also on the trail of the criminal gang. The two become reluctant allies, all the while never suspecting the ringleader– and the one who most wants to see them dead– might be someone they know and trust…\n\nBy the late 1930s, Wong was mostly relegated to B-movies. While lacking the clout of A-pictures, some of my favorite movies from the classic period are B-productions as they often had more freedom to experiment or portray things you wouldn’t see in a more expensive movie that needed to be “safe” in order to return the hefty investment. Daughter of Shanghai is one of the most enjoyable B-movies you’re likely to find, not just for its delightfully pulpy narrative but also for its progressive depiction of Asian-Americans as heroes.\n\nWong plays a true badass in this movie. She’s smart, she’s independent, and she doesn’t take anyone’s crap. Wong herself was reportedly delighted with the role, happy to play a Chinese-American who wasn’t treacherous or shady, but openly noble and brave. She makes a great team with Philip Ahn’s G-man, and it’s also great to see her allowed to have a romantic relationship with another character that doesn’t end in misery and/or death.\n\nThe film itself is a delightful ride with all the pulp trimmings: near-death situations, last-minute escapes, dangerous traveling conditions, fistfights. The story is almost paced like a condensed movie serial and it’s never dull. Robert Florey was in the director’s chair, so there’s style to burn. Interestingly, though this film was made while the Production Code was in full force, it often has the feel of a pre-code melodrama due to its emphasis on seduction and potent danger.\n\nThere’s no denying this film is a low budget affair. Shot in a month, it’s hardly a Von Sternberg arthouse object. I don’t care. This movie is a hell of a lot of fun and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great evening watch when they want to be entertained but don’t have two hours to burn. There are lengthy, expensive Netflix series which don’t have the entertainment value this thing does.\n\nDaughter of the Dragon (dir. Lloyd Corrigan, 1931)\n\nExotic dancer Princess Ling Moy (Wong) discovers her long-lost father is none other than the notorious Fu Manchu (Warner Oland). Before they have time to do any normal father-daughter bonding activities, he is mortally wounded while killing his nemesis, Sir John Petrie, who he wrongly believes was responsible for the death of his family during the Boxer Rebellion. As he lies dying, Fu Manchu makes Ling Moy promise to kill the rest of the Petrie clan as revenge for their own slaughtered loved ones. Ling Moy swears to fulfill her father’s last request, but her quest for revenge will be complicated by her burgeoning romantic feelings for Petrie’s son Ronald (Bramwell Fletcher) and the efforts of Chinese detective Ah Kee (Sessue Hayakawa).\n\nDaughter of the Dragon was Wong’s first movie under her Paramount contract. In terms of Asian representation, Daughter of the Dragon is the polar opposite of Daughter of Shanghai. This earlier film is far more negative, depicting Ling Moy as a seductress out to snap up clueless white men and murder/mutilate any love rivals without mercy. I cannot imagine Wong was too happy with this film, considering her dismay at the continued Hollywood-approved stereotyping of Chinese people as wicked deceivers.\n\nAdmittedly, the film does have camp value, not unlike the similarly orientalist The Mask of Fu Manchu with Boris Karloff. The production is dripping with over the top Chinese-inspired design and Ling Moy’s costumes are eye-catching. It’s clear the film’s main purpose is not exploration of character or theme, but providing the audience with vicarious thrills and chills as our “heroes” (I cannot put enough quotes around that word, since the so-called good guys are universally boring and mostly passive– also I do not get why Ling Moy is so into Ronald, he’s about as sexy as soggy fish and chips) evade gruesome yet creative death traps. This is certainly a case where the bad guys steal the show, simply because they have so much more drive and seem to be having so much more fun.\n\nThe best I can say about Daughter of the Dragon is that it never drags and Wong never phones it in, though the material is undeniably beneath her. Wong is able to give her character fleeting glimmers of melancholy. You get the sense Ling Moy’s wanted a father figure all her life and once she’s given one, she dedicates herself to pleasing him to fill that void– even if pleasing him means committing multiple murders. This makes Ling Moy a bit more human than she likely was on paper, but it’s not enough to really combat the nonsense in the script or to magically make the movie good. I can’t say I recommend it, but it has its moments in a so bad it’s funny kind of way.\n\nLady from Chungking (dir. William Nigh, 1942)\n\nKwan Mei (Wong) is the leader of a band of Chinese freedom fighters. Surrounded by the occupying Japanese on all sides, they bide their time in a peasant village. One day, a pair of American pilots are shot down near the village and captured by the Japanese. Seeing potential allies, Kwan Mei plans to rescue them as well as gather information about the plans of the invaders. Learning the Japanese leader General Kaimura (Hans Huber) has a taste for refined women, Kwan Mei poses as an aristocrat sympathetic to the occupiers in order to seduce any big plans out of him. Will she succeed?\n\nDuring World War II, Wong was ardent about supporting the war effort, particularly through sending aid to the Chinese through organizations like United China Relief, participating in USO entertainments, and of course appearing in Allied propaganda. However, these films were for Producers Releasing Corporation, a poverty row studio. This effectively marked the beginning of the end of her movie career. The silver lining is that Wong got to play heroic figures.\n\nWhile it’s no Casablanca, Lady from Chungking is a solid programmer, though nothing especially memorable. The comic relief is unbearably corny, such as when one of the American pilots narrates a baseball game in his sleep, much to Kwan Mei’s confusion. Characters are mostly underdeveloped and the story moves swiftly, which works for the movie’s adventure/thriller elements but less so for the interesting tensions that are left unexplored. General Kamimura is a fervent classist, sneering at the Chinese peasants and only taking an interested in aristocratic women as his bedmates. He loses all interest in Mae Clarke’s Russian opportunist when she reveals she is not a noblewoman in exile, but all but jumps onto Kwan Mei when she passes herself as a Chinese aristocrat. Playing on the general’s fantasies and sense of cultural superiority, Kwan Mei is able to charm information out of him, but this sexual entanglement also puts her at odds with her own people, who begin to wonder if Kwan Mei’s loyalty can be cancelled out by the luxury of being a Japanese officer’s mistress.\n\nNone of this goes anywhere interesting, but at only an hour, the film never overstays its welcome and Wong commands the screen easily. She cuts a noble figure and even gets an inspirational speech at the end. Her character is not a damsel needing to be rescued by the brave Americans, but an active heroine in her own right, as are the other Chinese characters. Plus, it’s always great to see Mae Clarke, another actress who deserved a better career than what she ultimately received.\n\nWhen Were You Born (dir. William McGann, 1938)\n\nAstrology expert Mei Lee Ling (Wong) finds herself flocked to during an ocean liner trip to San Francisco. Passengers react to her character readings and predictions with amazement and skepticism, but no one expects her most sensational prediction to come true: that one of the passengers will be dead within two days. When the very man turns up dead in that time frame, Mei is approached by the police. They suspect her, but instead she offers her aid in sniffing out the real culprit by using her knowledge of astrological signs.\n\nWhen Were You Born was intended to be the start of a mystery film series starring Anna May Wong as a Zodiac expert who solves crimes by analyzing suspects based on their astrological sign. This would not come to be as the film didn’t make much of an impact. As much as I have come to love Wong during this marathon, I can see why the series never panned out, because this movie milks its gimmick dry before the slim runtime even ticks down. Much of the film is just Wong explaining everyone’s Zodiac sign and then telling the cops why this or that person did or didn’t do this or that crime because of that sign. The only things that held my interest was Wong’s lovely wardrobe and poised manner.\n\nI don’t really have too much to say about this film. The camerawork is rote, the characters are one-dimensional, and it doesn’t help that I’m not that fond of mysteries as a genre. However, perusing reviews, I noticed that people who are into astrology tend to think this is a cute trifle, so your mileage will definitely vary.\n\nPiccadilly (dir. E.A. Dupont, 1929)\n\nLondon nightclub owner Valentine Wilmot (Jameson Thomas) has a bit of a dilemma. His biggest draw is the dance team Mabel and Vic. The problem is that Vic has been harassing Mabel (Gilda Gray) to extend their partnership into the romantic realm, despite her constant rebuffs and entanglement with Wilmot. Called out for his unprofessional conduct, Vic quits before he can be fired. Mabel tries to go solo but Vic was the more popular of the two, meaning Wilmot needs a new act to reel customers back in. Enter Shosho (Wong), a young scullery maid with dreams of dancing. Her eastern-inspired act is a hit, cementing Mabel’s fall from grace. When it looks as though Shosho has a grip on Wilmot’s affections as well, Mabel becomes desperate. However, she finds Shosho is unwilling to give up her hard-earned fame and romance.\n\nModern consensus is that Piccadilly features Anna May Wong’s finest performance. Her final silent film, it is a great showcase for how technically dazzling late-period silents were. Though the top-billed star is Gilda Gray, the film is Wong’s show all the way.\n\nOn paper, the plot of Piccadilly is basic backstage melodrama: an older woman (and by “older,” I mean just past the impossibly ancient age of 25– Gilda Gray was in her late twenties when filming this, though she was made to look a bit older) with a waning showbiz career contends with a hot young thing looking to take her place in the limelight. However, the characters are given more depth than you’d expect and there are no clear-cut heroes or villains. Mabel’s career is threatened by ageist attitudes and the fickle tastes of her public while Shosho is up against rampant racism. Both women are sympathetic, and both are capable of pettiness and cruelty.\n\nShosho’s situation is handled with great delicacy. A less inspired movie would have made her a simple femme fatale, but Piccadilly emphasizes that Shosho is not a cold-hearted villainess but a young woman from a lower class background who craves luxury and excitement. Her introduction is one of the most brilliant quick-sketches of a character I’ve ever seen. Shosho dances slowly and sensually atop a table, mesmerizing her fellow scullery workers. When the camera lingers on her legs, we see her tattered stockings. This shot is not merely erotic, but also a keen insight into how dance is a brief escape from Shosho’s dreary everyday life. For a moment, she can transcend being a dishwasher. When she finally makes it big as a dancer and rapturously reads the positive reviews in the newspaper, Wong makes Shosho’s girlish delight so palpable that it’s impossible not to empathize with her.\n\nOf course, Shosho is not a saint. As evidenced by her interactions with Mabel, she can be catty. She also strings along her boyfriend Jim (King Hou Chang), expecting him to be content with taking a backseat while she pursues a relationship with another man. Though she does seem genuinely fond of him, she certainly takes his loyalty for granted and is not above emasculating him, such as when she demands he model her skimpy dancer’s costume for Wilmont.\n\nShosho’s youthful beauty and appeal to the white British audience’s taste for the “exotic” is able to propel her to fame, but her ethnicity still provides roadblocks. Shosho and Wilmot share a mutual attraction, but dare not make their romance public. The two see a racially mixed couple shamed at a bar, a foretaste of what could happen to them should they take a chance on their relationship. Shosho’s dismayed reaction to the fiasco shows her interest in Wilmont is not merely that of a gold-digger.\n\nOverall, Piccadilly is a fantastic film, almost a proto-noir with its shadowy aesthetic and complicated morality. The ironic ending is particularly a punch to the gut. If you’ve never seen a silent film before or if you’ve only seen silent comedy and want to dip your toes into silent drama, this is a great gateway title. But even more so, it’s a great gateway to Wong’s dramatic skills.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAfter this marathon, I came away with greater respect for Wong, both as an actress and as a person. Hollywood truly did this woman dirty. She could handle drama and comedy with ease. She had a lovely speaking voice. She had great command of her body and an expressive face. Top all that with her undeniable beauty and it’s a crime she was not offered the same opportunities as white actresses of similar caliber.\n\nOf the five movies I marathoned, my favorite was probably Daughter of Shanghai due to Wong playing a badass who doesn’t have to die tragically and just the overall pulpy vibe of the film. Piccadilly is a close second with its noirish intrigue and complicated characters. Lady from Chungking is pretty good for what it is, while When Were You Born is forgettable and Daughter of the Dragon is a tough sell unless you’re looking for something to give the MST3K treatment.\n\nDespite the limits the film industry imposed upon her, Wong took nothing lying down. I admire her for her steadfastness in fighting for better, less demeaning roles, even if she did not win every battle. She was often the high point of many a film and deserves her rediscovery.\n\nSources:\n\nAnna May Wong: From Laundryman’s Daughter to Hollywood Legend by Graham Russell Gao Hodges\n\nBackwards and in Heels: The past, present, and future of women working in film by Alicia Malone\n\nPiccadilly audio commentary by Farran Smith Nehme\n\nWhen I started doing these “greatest hits of X year” posts in 2021, I expected to only make one a year going forward. However, these are so much fun. I just love looking at what movies drew audiences in the past and looking into how they hold up over time. By this year’s end, I might have several of these on the blog. I can’t hold myself back.\n\nThis time, we’re looking at 1924, the year in which Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer came into being. Often considered the most glamorous of the Golden Age studios, in 1924 it was still a ramshackle operation and its days of dominance would not kick into high gear until the start of the talkie era. Regardless, they scored two major hits in 1924, one of which cemented the stardom of Lon Chaney Sr. and the other which launched the stardom of matinee idol John Gilbert.\n\nSome familiar faces will be present on this list. Cecil B. DeMille continues to dazzle Jazz Age audiences with his tales of bad behavior and moral redemption among the young and beautiful. Harold Lloyd continues to be the most lucrative screen comedian, landing two hit features. Douglas Fairbanks’ landmark fantasy epic The Thief of Bagdad is also a big hit, though numbers don’t quite match up to his previous effort, Robin Hood.\n\nNew faces appear as well. John Gilbert’s steady rise to legendary sex symbol begins in earnest here. Young Mary Astor appears opposite John Barrymore at the start of her own stardom. Norma Shearer appears in He Who Gets Slapped, the first MGM film put into release– an oddly fitting detail since for much of the 1930s, she would be dubbed the Queen of the MGM lot.\n\nLet’s waste no more time. Onto the post!\n\nMy usual note: It is difficult to get 100% accurate box office information from the silent era and this list is based on the top ten films offered up by Wikipedia as the big hits of 1924. Box office numbers can vary depending on the source (and here, I just stuck to the Wikipedia numbers for consistency’s sake), so just keep that in mind as we forge ahead.\n\n#10 – HIS HOUR\n\nRelease date: September 29, 1924\n\nBox office (est.): $197,000\n\nSummary: Prim British noblewoman Tamara Loraine (Aileen Pringle) is drawn to wild Prince Gritzko (John Gilbert), a dashing Russian with a long list of conquests. However, she has enough self-control to hold off his advances. Circumstances propel Tamara to Gritzko’s lodge, where he aggressively tries to get her to submit. Can these crazy kids find love despite Gritzko’s caveman ways?\n\nElinor Glyn is a key figure in early 20th century pop culture. A novelist who specialized in torrid, exotic romance, her books were equally controversial and popular for their sexual content. Her most famous novel was Three Weeks, the passionate tale of a love affair between a British youth and a mysterious temptress who turns out to be royalty. The masses saw the Glyn universe as one of glamorous, racy escapism. Allegedly more discerning readers sniffed at Glyn’s work as trash.\n\nActor John Gilbert was among the critics, but he was roped into making a film version of Glyn’s novel When the Hour Came by fledgling studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Producer Irving Thalberg concurred with Gilbert that the material was trash– but the public had a taste for trash and were willing to pay good money for it. Gilbert’s reluctance to take the lead was not allayed when he met Glyn in person. A powerful force in Hollywood (several of her books were turned into films and she was given a lot of sway over casting decisions), Glyn was a celebrity in her own right, her bright red hair wrapped in elaborate turbans and her demeanor the height of Jazz Age camp. When she was introduced to Gilbert, she is said to have called him “the black stallion,” much to his embarrassment.\n\nAt the time, Gilbert was not the superstar he would become by the mid-1920s and his name was overshadowed by Aileen Pringle. Pringle had just come off her lead part in an adaptation of the more famous Three Weeks, which catapulted her to stardom and made her a natural casting choice for His Hour. Pringle is only remembered in silent film buff circles today, but she appears to have led a fascinating life. While a bit snobby and aloof with her co-stars, her wit and intelligence made her popular with intellectuals like HL Mencken, and would later marry crime novelist James M. Cain of The Postman Always Rings Twice fame, though the union lasted only two years.\n\nWhatever its stars thought, His Hour was a hit and King Vidor’s lush direction singled out for praise. However, the eroticism was apparently too hot to handle for many moral watchdogs, particularly a scene in which Gilbert caresses, kisses, and bites Pringle’s hand while she feigns sleep. Regardless of the pearl clutchers, the film was Gilbert’s first for MGM and helped cement his reputation as one of the great silent screen lovers.\n\nHis Hour exists in a print with Czech intertitles but is currently unavailable to view anywhere. Gilbert biographer Eve Golden claims it’s unimpressive, hampered by Gilbert and Pringle’s lack of chemistry, and Gilbert’s Russian prince being “little more than a stalker and rapist.” Ouch.\n\nSources:\n\nDark Star: The Untold Story of the Meteoric Rise and Fall of Legendary Silent Screen Star John Gilbert by Leatrice Gilbert Fountain\n\nJohn Gilbert: The Last of the Silent Film Stars by Eve Golden\n\n#9 – BEAU BRUMMEL\n\nRelease date: March 30, 1924\n\nBox office (est.): $453,000\n\nSummary: George “Beau” Brummel (John Barrymore) and tradesman’s daughter Margery (Mary Astor) are madly in love, but her parents oppose the union due to Beau’s lack of money or title. Margery is compelled to marry a lord, embittering her former love. Beau intends to have his vengeance upon high society by becoming one of the most popular members of the smart set, befriending the dissolute Prince of Wales (Willard Louis) and seducing many a married lady. However, through it all, Beau is haunted by his love for Margery and his simmering anger at the elites eventually compromises his good standing with the prince. Will he and Margery ever find a way to be together, or are they destined to forever be apart?\n\nWhile John Gilbert was just getting in his footing as a contender for top Hollywood matinee idol, John Barrymore was still enjoying plenty of success as a swoon-worthy thespian. During the 1900s and 1910s, Barrymore fangirls packed the theaters to hear his lovely voice and see his handsome face. While the medium of silent film could not capture Barrymore’s voice, his acting chops and good looks still came through.\n\nThe 1924 Beau Brummel was among Barrymore’s greatest hits of the 1920s. Based loosely on the life of the infamous 19th century dandy of the same name, Beau Brummel is a tragic romance. George “Beau” Brummel is unable to be with the noblewoman he loves due to class interests, so he plunges himself into a life of hedonistic dissolution, seducing married women, spending hours on perfecting his appearance, and partying it up with the equally amoral Prince of Wales. Much of the movie covers Beau’s society balancing act, charming the elite while covertly treating them with contempt. However, his enduring love for Margery gives his character considerable sympathy.\n\nMargery was the first major role of Mary Astor, who is absolutely, hauntingly beautiful throughout the film. She looks like a fairy tale princess come to life. Her relationship with Barrymore was as intense offscreen as it was on. The two had a sexual relationship during filming, even though Barrymore was over 40 and Mary Astor was only 17. Though she viewed Barrymore through rose-tinted lens during this time, Astor later said learned a lot about acting from observing Barrymore’s methods onset:\n\n“I was impressed by the keenness of his analysis and interpretation of character. He was the first actor I ever heard speak of a character in the third person. Instead of saying ‘I will do this’ or ‘I will make my entrance when a certain event occurs,’ Jack would say, ‘I don’t think the guy would do that. I think he’s so mad he wouldn’t even bow to the king.’ He was thinking of the character as a real being, with an intrinsic character that would cause him to react in ways quite different from the way he, as John Barrymore, would react.”\n\nThe part of Lady Margery isn’t terribly complicated, but Astor’s expressive face elevates what is otherwise a standard ingenue role. Her real life feelings for her co-star shine through all their scenes, intense and all-consuming.\n\nI have to say the most interesting dynamic in the film is between Beau and the Prince. The jovial energy between Barrymore and Willard Louis is palpable. According to Astor, the two told dirty jokes in their scenes together, believing that since they were making a silent film, no one in the audience would be the wiser. Alas, deaf patrons and others adept at lip-reading caught every nasty line and sent in their complaints to Warner Bros.\n\nAs far as Barrymore goes, the film is as much a showcase for his versatility as the more famous Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. We get to see Beau progress from besotted soldier to witty rake to disgraced old man living in madness and poverty. The gradual transformation is heartbreaking, making the film’s famous final scene all the more touching. I won’t spoil that ending in case you haven’t seen the film, but it does allow the film to conclude on a sentimental but powerful note.\n\nSources:\n\nMy Story: An Autobiography by Mary Astor\n\nThis Mad Masquerade: Stardom and Masculinity in the Jazz Age by Gaylyn Studlar\n\n#8 – HE WHO GETS SLAPPED\n\nRelease date: November 9, 1924\n\nBox office (est.): $493,000\n\nSummary: Scientist Paul Beaumont (Lon Chaney) sees his life fall apart when his wealthy patron, the Baron Regnard (Marc McDermott), plagiarizes his work and steals away his wife Marie (Ruth King). Humiliated before a panel of academics and spurned by Marie, Paul begins to see the world as cruel and absurd. He leaves his former identity behind when he joins a circus as a clown named HE. Gaining fame for his masochistic comedy act, HE finds love anew for the circus’ gentle bareback rider Consuelo (Norma Shearer), even though her heart belongs to her handsome co-performer Benzano (John Gilbert). But when Consuelo’s impoverished father Count Mancini (Tully Marshall) seeks to use her beauty to curry finances and favor with Baron Regnard, HE plots a dastardly revenge to defend the woman he loves.\n\nI’ve always found it hilarious that He Who Gets Slapped—a grim drama about a masochistic clown bent on revenge against the lecherous aristocrat who cuckolded him—was the first work wholly produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the one classic era studio you’d think most likely to shy away from such material. This is one perverse film in which humanity is marked out as collectively predatory and cruel. There are some glimmers of hope, true, but they are oh so faint.\n\nHe Who Gets Slapped is based on a 1915 Russian play still much revered in its country of origin. The film takes only the most basic ingredients from its source—the bitter clown, the impoverished Count Mancini’s desire to wed Consuelo to the Baron, the downbeat view of the human condition—but otherwise changes it from a talky, philosophical piece to something like a Jacobean revenge tragedy. The blend of the tragic and the ridiculous reminds me a bit of something like Oldboy, to be honest.\n\nThe sinister tone, circus setting, and presence of Lon Chaney might lead one to assume this is a Tod Browning project, but the director was Victor Sjostrom (billed Seastrom in the film itself), a Swedish filmmaker and actor enticed to Hollywood by Louis B. Mayer. He Who Gets Slapped was his second American project and he would go on to direct several great silent classics, like The Scarlet Letter and The Wind. After the talkie revolution, Sjostrom returned to his native Sweden and stuck to acting exclusively, becoming a mentor to a young Ingmar Bergman and starring in one of Bergman’s greatest pictures, Wild Strawberries. During the 1920s, Sjostrom relished his time with Chaney (the two would make two films together), calling him the greatest actor working on screen or stage.\n\nChaney was certainly on the up and up in 1924. He’d become a bonafide star after the success of The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1923 and his celebrity would remain undimmed until his untimely death in 1930. Chaney’s performance as HE is among his finest work. The way he channels his pain and rage into his bitter clown act is downright chilling. And yet, flickers of compassion pulse through the performance, allowing one to hope that perhaps something of HE’s faith in humanity can be renewed.\n\nAt its heart, He Who Gets Slapped is about how unfeeling people can be when it comes to the pain of others. HE’s act is a recreation of the worst day of his life in which he was humiliated before a scientific committee by the Baron: he announces basic facts only to be slapped repeatedly by his fellow performers. The skit culminates in HE having a felt heart ripped from his chest by another clown, who proceeds to stomp it into the ground before giving HE an irreverent clown funeral. I doubt anyone who’s ever watched this film has ever found this “comic” act funny, yet the onscreen audience howls with sadistic mirth. They look positively obnoxious in those crowd shots, and one wonders what HE gets out of his act. Is it his way of exercising control over a situation in which he was so powerless? Is it an undetected gesture of contempt towards all humanity?\n\nEven the kindhearted Consuelo, played by a luminous Norma Shearer, is guilty of a certain level of thoughtlessness. When HE confesses his love to her, Consuelo reacts with disgust then laughs, the very thought of this middle-aged clown being enamored with her too absurd a concept to be true. She even slaps him for good measure—a gesture that’s intended to be playful, but only devastates HE. On one hand, it’s hard to blame Consuelo’s reaction—I don’t know how I would react if a co-worker I viewed as a casual friend randomly and passionately swore their love for me—but because we understand HE’s alienation and pain so keenly, it’s hard not to empathize with his rejection.\n\nThe dynamic between HE and Consuelo is more fascinating than the usual Chaney/Unrequited Love Interest deal because HE isn’t just in love with Consuelo. He arguably sees her as a double, for both of them have been objectified by the wealthy. Consuelo’s father treats her as a commodity that can be used to buy his way back into aristocratic society. When we first see her, she’s being appraised by the ringmaster as though she were a thoroughbred horse. She turns in a circle, eyes downcast, utterly dehumanized. But one of the most chilling scenes in the film occurs when Count Mancini is trying to convince the Baron to marry Consuelo. Disgusted by Consuelo’s show business profession, the Baron initially refuses. However, Mancini begins to spin his sales pitch, asking the Baron to “Imagine what a bride she will make.” We don’t get any more intertitles specifying what else the Count is saying, but his leering manner and the Count’s suggestive fondling of a set of pearls tell us everything. When HE moves in to save Consuelo from being used as a sexualized bargaining chip, it isn’t because he thinks he’ll win her heart. At that point, she’s already rejected him. Instead, it becomes a means of making sure history does not repeat itself and the Baron will no longer be able to use other humans as his playthings.\n\nFor all its nastiness, He Who Gets Slapped is not so much a nihilistic horror show as a cathartic call to compassion. The ending scenes are among the most moving in all film. I always find my heart aching when the drama ends, no matter how many times I’ve seen it and it remains one of my all-time favorites of the entire silent era.\n\n#7 – TRIUMPH\n\nRelease date: April 27, 1924\n\nBox office (est.): $678,526\n\nSummary: King Garnet (Rod La Roque) is a no-good wastrel, ignoring the canning factory he inherited and shirking every responsibility he can. Anna Land (Leatrice Joy) works in the factory to support her struggling family, but dreams of a singing career. Both characters face trials a-plenty, particularly King when he learns that due to a secret will, he has to take direct control of the factory or else he’ll lose his ample inheritance to his illegitimate brother William Silver (Victor Varconi), who happens to be the factory manager. Also, there’s a Romeo and Juliet flashback somewhere in there because this is a silent DeMille film after all and we need our period costumes, damn it!\n\nCecil B. DeMille followed up his mammoth production of The Ten Commandments with more modest (at least, by DeMille epic standards) Jazz Age potboilers, but they seem to have pleased 1920s audiences. The first film in a three-picture contract DeMille signed for Famous Players-Lasky, Triumph brought back DeMille favorites Leatrice Joy and Rod La Roque for the lead roles. Zasu Pitts, fresh off Von Stroheim’s Greed, is in a supporting comic relief part. Like the modern story of The Ten Commandments, Triumph was designed as a Jazz Age morality play about the idle rich and the importance of hard work, putting its flawed leading man through the ringer so he could earn his happiness.\n\nI don’t have much to say about this one. Prints of Triumph survive, but like His Hour, it remains unavailable for viewing. Contemporary reviewers seemed to universally concur it was good enough if a bit too long for what it was and certainly nothing that would make you forget The Ten Commandments anytime soon. On the flip side, DeMille biographer Scott Eyman has seen the film and his impression isn’t so favorable: “The setting is outlandish, the plot defies synopsis let alone rational analysis, and DeMille’s filmmaking carries authority but no energy until the end, when he puts together a rousing fire sequence that looks dangerous and probably was.”\n\nSources:\n\nCecil B.

DeMille by Gene Ringgold\n\n#6 – FEET OF CLAY\n\nRelease date: September 28, 1924\n\nBox office (est.): $904,383\n\nSummary: Kerry Harlan (Rod La Roque) is a poor boy. Amy Loring (Vera Reynolds) is a rich girl. After he saves her from drowning, the two marry, but complications ensue. Firstly, Kerry has to stay off his feet due to a shark bite that occurred while he was rescuing Amy. Secondly, his married sister-in-law Bertha (Julia Faye) wants him as her boy toy and aggressively pursues him. When Bertha dies due to an accidental fall from a balcony, scandal haunts the young couple, who decide to form a suicide pact. However, their subsequent trip to the afterlife is cut short when they’re brought back to life and then…uh… yeah, the plot synopsis kind of confuses me.\n\nFeet of Clay was DeMille’s second picture for Famous Players-Lasky, though it was a project for which he had little enthusiasm. Jesse Lasky insisted DeMille make a film from Margaretta Tuttle’s novel (originally a magazine serial) of the same name, but DeMille wanted to make an adaptation of the Sutton Vane play Outward Bound. Outward Bound is about a group of passengers on a ship who slowly realize they are all dead and en route to the afterlife. The spiritual angle suited DeMille’s interests, but Lasky was insistent on Feet of Clay and so DeMille decided to make the best of it by combining Tuttle’s story with elements from a 1914 play called Across the Border, which involves out-of-body experiences.\n\nDeMille tried subtly inserting elements from Outward Bound into Feet of Clay‘s script, but Vane sniffed them out and sued Famous Players-Lasky. The studio ended up settling with Vane out of court and the whole affair soured their view of DeMille, though Adolph Zukor was already felt somewhat threatened by DeMille, whose loyal staff viewed themselves as more beholden to the director than to the studio. Lasky and Zukor flaunted an upcoming contract with DW Griffith as a means of putting DeMille in his place– he wouldn’t be the only prestige director on their payroll now. Ultimately, DeMille finished out his contract with The Golden Bed in 1925, then left to start up his own studio.\n\nRegardless of the behind the scenes misery involved, Feet of Clay was a profitable film, grossing three times its budget. Reviews were favorable too. Writing for The Motion Picture News, Frank Elliott claimed, “The plot packs a good moral and swings the observer along through moments of the wildest jazz, the strongest drama, real heart appeal, and passionate lovemaking.” Alas, Feet of Clay is a lost film, so I cannot offer any opinions of my own.\n\nSources:\n\nCecil B.

That home is about to be invaded by Wifey’s relations: the domineering pro-Prohibition moralist mother Winnifred (Josephine Crowell), and her two sons, the grown-up deadbeat Charley (Charles Stevenson) and the underage brat Bobby (Mickey McBan). As much as Hubby tries to make the best of things, the trio are an unholy pain and the sooner Hubby can get rid of them, the better.\n\nHarold Lloyd’s features come in two flavors: “character pictures” with more developed emotional throughlines and “gag pictures” with loose plots and a laugh a minute. Nineteen-twenty-four saw Lloyd offer up one of each: Girl Shy would be the character picture and Hot Water the gag picture. In fact, Hot Water was designed as a response to critics of Girl Shy (which we’ll discuss later in this post), a “character film” deemed overlong. So, Hot Water only runs for an hour and consists of three episodic vignettes following a young newlywed’s day from hell when his insufferable in-laws come to visit.\n\nThe first vignette concerns his trip to the grocery store, where he wins a prize turkey in a raffle drawing and has to try to carry it home without causing a riot on the public transport. The second introduces the annoying in-laws. They come by for a visit, usurping Hubby’s house and his attempt at a romantic drive in his new car with Wifey. Their family outing goes about as well as any attempt at a peaceful drive in a silent comedy. The final vignette involves Hubby trying to shut Winnifred up through a discreet use of chloroform, only for him to believe he’s killed her. When her “ghost” starts stalking through the house and the police appear outside the door, hijinks ensue.\n\nCritics and fans often find Hot Water lacking compared to Lloyd’s other features. It’s not uncommon to see it deemed “a weaker effort.” I beg to differ: Hot Water is damn funny and one of my go-to silent comedies when I want to laugh out loud. I love the dysfunctional family element, maybe because it’s just more relatable the older I get.\n\nThe visual storytelling is also brilliant. My favorite example is when Hubby slowly realizes his in-laws are in the house. He gets hit by a spitball—a sign that Bobby is there. He sees cigarette smoke rising above the back of an armchair—a sign that Charley is there. And then he sees his own pipe in a trash can—a sign that Winnifred is on the prowl for vices to cure.\n\nLloyd’s expressions throughout are what kills me most. Anytime he realizes he has to deal with his irritating relations, the light dies in his eyes and his jaw becomes firm, an excellent and accurate manifestation of everyday misery. Though a master of mugging when a scene called for it, these subtle reactions are hilarious and show how wonderfully expressive Lloyd was as an actor.\n\nIf I have a complaint about Hot Water, it’s that these characters are all so good that I wish they were in a more developed film story. Like, imagine irritated Harold Lloyd having to lug his wife and her awful family to some vacation spot—Harold Lloyd goes to Wally World! Man, I would have LOVED to see that. Such a shame silent comedians didn’t really go for sequels. These characters just begged for it.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Harold Lloyd Encyclopedia by Annette M.

Disguising himself as a prince, Ahmed plans to kidnap the Princess, but instead falls mutually in love with her. His charade discovered by the Princess’ enraged father, Ahmed must win his lady love’s hand by finding a priceless treasure. In time, he will also have to save both princess and Bagdad itself from a conniving Mongolian prince (Sojin Kamiyama).\n\nDouglas Fairbanks was riding high after the smash success of his Robin Hood, which was the number one box office attraction of 1922. A grand epic colored by romantic chivalry and good-humored action, what could possibly top it? During the pre-production phase, Fairbanks jumped from project to project with his usual creative abandon. Maybe he’d make a pirate movie? Or an epic set in Ancient Rome? Or an adaptation of Monsieur Beaucaire?\n\nUltimately, Fairbanks set his heart on an epic mash-up of the stories of The Arabian Nights, intending to outdo himself with an array of action, romance, and immersive fantasy. As a result, The Thief of Bagdad is undoubtedly the artiest film of Fairbanks’ career. The Three Musketeers and Robin Hood were elaborate spectacles, but their visuals still had some grounded qualities. The Thief continually leaves any sense of realism behind in just about every facet of its creation, conjuring an uncompromised storybook world in which rippling fabric stands in for a raging ocean and the William Cameron Menzies sets are an Art Deco dream of the dangerous yet wondrous world of The Arabian Nights.\n\nBoldest of all is arguably Fairbanks’ performance. He was always ebullient and energetic, but here, his acting takes on balletic dimensions. Influenced by Vaslav Nijinskiy and the Ballets Russes, Fairbanks all but dances through this part, throwing both arms up when surprised, hopping from place to place like a Mario Brother, or rubbing his belly in large circles when intoxicated by the aroma of fresh bread. Non silent film afficionados will assume this is just silent movie overacting with no artistic thought put into it (“hur, hur, people couldn’t act before Brando hur hur”). Fairbanks biographer Tracey Goessel is more on the mark when she says, “[Fairbanks] was trying to make a film as universal, as primarily symbolic, as dance.”\n\nThe Thief was a box office success and most of the critical notices were positive, but this triumph would be mixed. For one thing, the movie was so expensive that its profits were not as substantial as previous Fairbanks spectaculars. The Thief also wasn’t as popularly received as Robin Hood. While it played well in the cities, small town exhibitors claimed their patrons were less keen on this artier Fairbanks. In a few years, the critics would concur, calling the film a pretentious misfire. It’s clear Fairbanks had succumbed to the desire to make ART! How dare he!\n\nYears ago, I was with these critics, finding the film beautiful but ponderous, but my most recent viewing of The Thief changed my mind. As opposed to watching Fairbanks’ opus on a tiny laptop in crappy YouTube quality, I had on the latest bluray release, splashed across my sizeable flat screen with Carl Davis’ gorgeous Rimsy-Korsakov-inspired score blaring. Presented in good quality (while my phone was in another room), The Thief became an engrossing experience, a competitor with Fritz Lang’s two-part Die Niebelungen as the greatest fantasy film of the 1920s.\n\nSources:\n\nThe First King of Hollywood: The Life of Douglas Fairbanks by Tracey Goessel\n\n#3 – SECRETS\n\nRelease date: March 24, 1924\n\nBox office (est.): $1,500,000\n\nSummary: Sitting patiently by the sickbed of her husband John (Eugene O’Brien), elderly Mary Carlton (Norma Talmadge) looks back on their life together. In her teens, Mary abandoned a life of ease and wealth to elope with penniless John. They made a life in the American West, facing physical danger and heartbreak together. In middle age, John’s infidelity threatens the union, but the relationship survives due to Mary’s patience. However, can it survive John’s illness?\n\nSecrets presents superstar Norma Talmadge at the height of her illustrious career. Her part is an actor’s dream come true: a single character we see over different phases of a long life. In this movie’s case, four phases. And I have to say, Talmadge’s work in differentiating the different versions of the same character is masterful. I would not be shy calling this her best performance– at least, among the scant Talmadge oeuvre readily available for viewing.\n\nA frame story in which the elderly Mary Carlton (Talmadge) sits beside her ill husband’s bedside as she remembers their long marriage bookends three flashbacks showing the evolution of their relationship. What’s most striking is how convincing the old age makeup on Talmadge is in these scenes. Even now, it’s difficult to age up younger actors without making them look abominable…\n\n…Ahem. But the make-up here is fantastic, as it remains throughout the film as we go through this woman’s long life and marriage. The old age make-up alone is great.\n\nEach section feels like its own mini-movie, each with a different genre and tone. The first of the flashbacks takes place in 1865 when Mary was a young, lovestruck girl. John is a penniless employee of her father’s, making him an unsuitable option for Mary’s hand. Her parents desire a more socially advantageous match for their daughter, but Mary’s unmarried aunt– who was forced to give up the man she loved due to his low standing– urges the girl to follow her heart. This first section is slow but charming, playing almost like farce towards the end when Mary has to hide John in her room. While the visual metaphor of elaborate undergarments representing the limited social standing of Victorian women is a cliche by now, it works well here, with Mary almost laughing at the ridiculous amounts of layers she asked to put on for her first ball.\n\nThe second section sees the movie morph into a western. Mary is now a frontier wife with an infant son. She and John live in a humble house, but are happy. However, John runs afoul of a murderous gang and they ambush his house. We get a big shoot-out scene, in which the couple defend their home and Mary tries to console their ill baby. The sequence is both exciting and sentimental, once again emphasizing Mary’s devotion to the relationship and her iron will.\n\nThe third section is the weakest. Mary is now a comely matron and John a successful politician. They’ve two grown children and a beautiful home. Even Mary’s parents are no longer estranged from their daughter, coming by to visit her. However, Mary’s contentment is destroyed when she learns John is having an affair with Estelle, a gorgeous widow intent on breaking up the marriage. What makes this section suffer is John’s weak motivation. He tells Mary the affair was only born of short-lived lust and he has no plans on divorce. And right away, crisis averted, as Mary takes the repentant lug back, even though he also admits they’re penniless again. The adultery is treated like a minor inconvenience.\n\nIs this poor writing or the result of missing footage? Indeed, it’s hard to properly evaluate Secrets, as it exists in incomplete condition. As it stands, the film’s success largely relies on Talmadge’s virtuoso performance. If I have a major issue, it’s that the husband character is underdrawn and colorless, making you wonder what makes him worth so much devotion and sacrifice. For me, this prevents the movie from having the emotional impact it should have, but regardless, it’s still an entertaining melodrama, one I wish was in better, more complete condition.\n\nSources:\n\nSilent Stars by Jeanine Basinger\n\n#2 – GIRL SHY\n\nRelease date: April 20, 1924\n\nBox office (est.): $1,550,000\n\nSummary: Tailor’s apprentice Harold Meadows (Harold Lloyd) is hardly a ladies’ man. He stutters around women and has never had a girlfriend. This does not prevent him from writing a how-to book about wooing all the different sorts of women out there, from flappers to vamps. During his quest for publication, he meets Mary Buckingham (Jobyna Ralston), a Los Angeles heiress. The two fall mutually in love, though Harold only wants to ask for her hand if he can make a good living from his book. When the book is rejected as too absurd, Harold breaks off the relationship… that is, until he learns the nefarious secret of Mary’s other suitor, the greedy and callous Ronald DeVore (Carlton Griffin), and becomes determined to save Mary from him.\n\nIt’s difficult for me to pinpoint the “best” Harold Lloyd film. Safety Last! is the most iconic, sure, and The Freshman is truly masterful, but Girl Shy is an astonishing piece of work. Of all the silent Lloyd features, I find it the most satisfying. It’s very funny. It has satire. It has sweet romance. It has one of the most action-packed climactic chases in all silent comedy. All around, it might be Lloyd’s best career-best effort.\n\nLloyd’s first independent production, Girl Shy is a landmark in other ways as well. Some consider it a key title in the development of the cinematic romantic comedy. The last third involving Harold’s chase to stop his beloved’s wedding to another man, inspired two other major films. The first was the 1925 Ben-Hur. Director Fred Niblo was inspired by the shot in which the camera appears to be run over by the horses Harold utilizes to rush to the rescue. Niblo used a similar device during the chariot race in Ben-Hur. The second film is Mike Nichols’ The Graduate. There’s a direct link between Harold rescuing Mary from her unwanted nupitals and Dustin Hoffman crashing Katharine Ross’ would-be wedding, as Nichols was inspired by the earlier film.\n\nAll this aside, what sticks out most to me about Girl Shy is how it walks the fine line between genuine sentiment and broad comedy, but without devolving into sappy goo or mood whiplash. The romance between Harold and Mary is very touching. They’re both in situations in which they are not fully appreciated by the other people in their life: Harold is mocked as a joke and Mary is valued only for her money. With any movie, it is vital that the audience intensely care for the characters and desire their happiness. I am not a big fan of romantic comedy, but Girl Shy is so special to me because Lloyd and Ralston are both so likable and so sweet together. It would be a kind of death if their characters did not end up together.\n\nThe satire of Jazz Age lovemaking also plays well still. The excerpts from Harold’s book show him assuming the roles of masculine indifference or total dominance when dealing with a “vampire” and a “flapper.” These scenes lampoon conventions of romantic drama so prevalent in popular culture at the time, particularly the idea of the “cave man” who takes what he wants and won’t be ordered about. Even if the stereotypes of “vampire” and “flapper” are dated to the 1920s, terrible romantic advice based on goofy perceptions of women sure isn’t and these scenes remain highly amusing.\n\nGirl Shy is just such a pure lark of a film. It moves quickly, it makes you feel for the characters, it leaves you feel so, so good. It’s easy to see why audiences so readily took to both it and Lloyd himself.\n\nSources:\n\nThe Harold Lloyd Encyclopedia by Annette M. D’Agostino\n\n#1 – THE SEA HAWK\n\nRelease date: June 14, 1924\n\nBox office (est.): $2,000,000\n\nSummary: English baronet Oliver Tressilian (Milton Sills) is a decent man with a bit of a temper. Knowing it bothers his intended Rosamund Godolphin (Enid Bennett), he promises to cool it down, even if her brother Peter (Wallace MacDonald) is an antagonistic moron who wants to pick a fight with the Tressilian family any chance he can. Unfortunately, self-control comes far less easily to Oliver’s half-brother Lionel (Lloyd Hughes), who kills Peter during a duel. Afraid of being executed for murder, Lionel pins the blame on Oliver and has him kidnapped by the wily Captain Jasper Leigh (Wallace Beery), who takes the baronet to sea. When Jasper’s ship is captured by the Spanish, Oliver is forced to become a galley slave, but he escapes with the aid of the Moors. Converting to Islam and taking on a new name, Sakr-el-Bahr, he swears vengeance on those who wronged him, making his swift way back to English shores…\n\nThough a massive hit in its day, The Sea Hawk is among the most underrated silent films, often overshadowed by its talkie remake with Errol Flynn. (Though “remake” is a bit inaccurate in relation to the talkie version since other than the title and Elizabethan setting, the two stories have nothing in common.) Adapted from a 1915 novel of the same name by Rafael Sabitani (also responsible for Captain Blood and Scaramouche), this is the kind of rip-roaring adventure story Hollywood doesn’t make anymore. Family betrayal! Romance! Kidnapping! Daring escapes! Naval battles! Pirates! Faraway lands! With the exception of some orientalist stereotyping, the film has held up very well.\n\nThe spectacle on display is still breathtaking now, maybe even more so in an age saturated with green screens and CG. You see, director Frank Lloyd didn’t want to use miniatures to stage the naval battles since 1920s audiences were sophisticated enough to sniff out silver screen fakery. He insisted on full-scale ships, which he got with the aid of Fred Gabourie, a technical director who helped construct props and sets for Buster Keaton’s films. The effort more than pays off and the battle footage was considered so impressive that it was repurposed for other movies even into the 1930s and 1940s. Combined with rich historical atmosphere, this is one good-looking film.\n\nThe Sea Hawk also benefits from a great leading actor. Milton Sills is one of those movie stars whose name only rings a bell with silent movie geeks, largely because he died at the dawn of the talkie era, yet he is a revelation in this. I heard Rudolph Valentino was considered for this role. Given the antagonistic romance between Oliver and Rosamund for much of the film, I can imagine him in the part (particularly when Oliver kidnaps Rosamund and carries her away to his ship bridal style). Being older and less smoldering, 42-year-old Sills brings a wholly different quality than the 29-year-old Valentino would have. There’s a different sense of drama to a mature man having his world turned upside down compared to a much younger man’s. With Valentino, Oliver’s reversal of fortune might have come off like a coming-of-age adventure in the vein of Moran of the Lady Letty. With Sills, it comes off like a settled man having to reinvent himself amidst adversity and a new culture.\n\n(This isn’t to say Sills lacks erotic appeal. There’s a scene where he strips down before a judge to prove he couldn’t have killed Peter Godolphin since he hasn’t any injury, and what we see is pretty impressive, if I’m going to be objectifying about it.)\n\nBy and large, this is an adventure yarn with all the trimmings and a wonderful supporting cast. Enid Bennett just came off a big hit with Douglas Fairbanks’ 1922 Robin Hood, where she played Maid Marian. She gets more to chew on with Rosamund, who struggles to despise Oliver after she believes he killed her brother. For his part, Beery comes close to stealing the show from everyone. He is hilarious as Jasper Leigh, willing to promise anything to save his own skin and promoting himself in a rather Falstaffian fashion. Altogether, this is a great, great movie. If you haven’t seen it, then you’re in for a real treat.\n\nSources:\n\n“The Sea Hawk” by Bret Wood, https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/16041/the-sea-hawk#articles-reviews?articleId=33788"
