        "text": "Iga Swiatek enters the grass season yet again as the reigning French Open champion.\n\nThe world No. 1 will now turn her attentions to the grass, which has been the least successful surface of her career so far.\n\nWimbledon\n\nMurray 'not bitter' about Raducanu Wimbledon withdrawal - but they haven't spoken since\n\n25/07/2024 at 09:17\n\nShe had her best grass results last season as she made the semi-finals in Bad Homburg and her first Wimbledon quarter-final.\n\nWhen will Swiatek play next?\n\nSwiatek was set start her grass swing at the Berlin Open, which has a stacked field.\n\nThe WTA 500 event, which runs from June 15 to 23, was due to feature nine of the world’s top 10 players.\n\nHowever, that is now down to eight after Swiatek withdrew from the tournament.\n\n\"Due to overall physical and mental fatigue after an intense nine weeks, unfortunately I do need to withdraw from the tournament in Berlin in order to rest and recover,\" said the world No. 1.\n\nSwiatek is not on the entry list for any other grass events.\n\nThe Berlin Open is followed the next week by the Rothsay International in Eastbourne and Bad Homburg Open in Germany.\n\nWimbledon then starts on July 1.\n\nWill Swiatek play Wimbledon?\n\nWith a healthy advantage at the top of the WTA rankings over new world No. 2 Coco Gauff, Swiatek will be the top seed at Wimbledon.\n\nHer best result at the grass Grand Slam was last year when she lost in the quarter-finals to Elina Svitolina.\n\nTalking about her grass preparations after winning the French Open, Swiatek said: “I felt last year that I could adapt quicker. I'll also see what the plan is for this year, because last year it was the first time I was able to play this tournament before… so I think to play some matches before Wimbledon is also good, but on the other hand, I played basically almost every match in Stuttgart, Madrid, Rome and here, and so we need to take care of my physicality, as well.\n\n“So we'll see what the plans are. But I think the biggest progress I can make on grass right now is using my serves that was better, but also I don't expect a lot. The balls are different. Overall tennis is different on grass. I'll just see and I'll work hard to play better there.”\n\nHighlights: Dominant Swiatek defeats Paolini to win French Open title\n\nWill Swiatek play the Olympics?\n\nSwiatek is set to lead Poland at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nShe was beaten in the second round in Tokyo 2020 but this summer will be bidding to win Poland’s first tennis medal at the Games.\n\nWith the tennis event held at Roland-Garros, the home of the French Open, Swiatek will be a strong favourite for gold.\n\nSpeaking about the Olympics last month, Swiatek said: “In Tokyo, it was really stressful, so this year I'm working hard to keep expectations low. I'll try to do everything step by step.\n\n\"I want to keep [the Olympics] like any other one, even though it is the Olympics. Even though I have a lot of baggage on my shoulders. Winning any medal would be a dream come true, but we'll see.\"\n\nThe Olympic tennis event starts on July 27 and finishes on August 4, just three weeks before the US Open.\n\n‘Another level!’ - Swiatek seals quickfire double-break to take control against Gauff\n\nStream top tennis action live on discovery+, the Eurosport app and at eurosport.com\n\nWimbledon men\n\n'I want to sit at same table as big guys' - Alcaraz targets legends after Wimbledon triumph\n\n15/07/2024 at 07:13"
