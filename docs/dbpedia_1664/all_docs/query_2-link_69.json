        "text": "Kerriane McBean, the fortunate winner of Supreme Ventures Limited’s (SVL) Golden Ticket promotion, lived a dream in Paris as she enjoyed an all-expense-paid trip to the 2024 Olympic Games. Accompanied by her mother, Opal Swaby, Kerriane made the most of this once-in-a-lifetime experience, savouring every moment of her Parisian adventure.\n\nThe trip, organized and sponsored by Supreme Ventures, gave Kerriane and her mother the incredible opportunity to immerse themselves in the excitement of the Olympic Games. They cheered on the athletes from the stands and even met some of the stars in person, adding a personal touch to their unforgettable experience.\n\nOne of the highlights of Kerriane’s journey was fulfilling a lifelong dream by visiting the iconic Eiffel Tower. Describing the moment as \"surreal and everything she thought it would be,\" Kerriane was thrilled to finally see the landmark up close. The pair also explored the stunning Palais Versailles, adding another layer of enrichment to their Parisian escapade.\n\nSupreme Ventures Limited (SVL) Executive Chairman, Gary Peart, Opal Swaby, Olympian Tia Clayton and Golden Ticket winner Kerriane McBean in Paris for the Olympics 2024.\n\nReflecting on her incredible journey, Kerriane expressed her deep gratitude for the experience. \"This trip has been everything I ever imagined and more. Seeing the Eiffel Tower in person and walking through the halls of Versailles was a dream come true. I’m so grateful to Supreme Ventures for making this possible and for treating us like royalty every step of the way,\" she said.\n\nChloleen Daley-Muschett, Corporate Communications and PR Manager at Supreme Ventures Limited, shared her enthusiasm for being part of this special experience. \"At SVL, we are committed to creating extraordinary experiences for our customers. It has been an absolute pleasure to watch Kerriane and her mother enjoy Paris and the Olympic Games. This Golden Ticket initiative embodies our dedication to rewarding our loyal customers in truly unique and memorable ways,\" she remarked.\n\nSteve Kerr described Stephen Curry as the difference after his 24-point haul helped Team USA claim Olympic gold with a 98-87 victory over France on Saturday.\n\nKerr's team held off a late charge from France to win their fifth straight Olympic gold, with Curry putting on a masterclass from 3-point range in the latter stages.\n\nCurry shot 8-of-13 from 3-point range, sinking four of those efforts after Victor Wembanyama had dragged France within three points with three minutes remaining.\n\nDespite working with Curry for 10 seasons in his role as Golden State Warriors coach, Kerr cannot get enough of watching the four-time NBA champion.\n\n\"Steph Curry ended up being the difference. The flurry at the end of the game was just incredible. Watching him never gets old,\" Kerr told Eurosport after the game.\n\n\"I want to give credit to France; they were amazing. It felt like we were going to break that game open but they just kept hanging in there.\n\n\"Congrats to France on the silver medal, it’s a great accomplishment.\n\n\"Winning a gold medal is a dream for any young athlete, so to be part of it is incredibly special, and I'm just thankful for the opportunity.\"\n\nWembanyama finished with a game-high 26 points for France, while Guerschon Yabusele also had 20 points, 15 of them coming in the first half.\n\nFrance head coach Vincent Collet said: \"For sure, it's a disappointment, because we expected that we could do it but, in the end, we have to recognise they were better.\n\n\"This is the greatest moment of my career and, to do it in Paris, it is something special. We had a dream to make it happen but it was impossible, USA were too good.\"\n\nTeam USA claimed their fifth straight Olympic gold in men's basketball with a 98-87 victory over France in Saturday's final, with Stephen Curry starring with 24 points.\n\nSteve Kerr's star-studded United States side required a thrilling comeback to beat Nikola Jokic's Serbia in the semi-finals on Thursday, but a far better start put them on course for glory against the hosts in Saturday's gold-medal match.\n\nThe USA went into half-time with a nine-point lead thanks to some excellent early work from Devin Booker, though Guerschon Yabusele's 15 first-half points kept France in it, the highlight being a poster dunk on LeBron James.\n\nFrance shot just 3-of-16 from field range through the first two quarters but got hot in the third quarter, outscoring the USA 25-23 to give themselves hope of a comeback.\n\nRoared on by a vocal crowd at Bercy Arena – where Joel Embiid received plenty of jeers after rejecting the opportunity to represent France – the hosts made up more ground early in the fourth, thanks primarily to the efforts of Victor Wembanyama.\n\nThe NBA Rookie of the Year finished with a game-high 26 points – his first 20-point haul at the Paris Games – while also adding seven rebounds, dragging France to within three points with just under three minutes remaining.\n\nHowever, Curry took charge from there, quietening the crowd with a majestic 3-pointer, his fifth of the game, and adding a further three jumpers before the buzzer.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors star finished with 24 points and was 8-of-13 from 3-point range, having also produced an incredible 36-point performance in Thursday's win over Serbia.\n\nA couple of Kevin Durant free throws and a Booker layup helped the USA stetch their lead in the dying stages, claiming a record-extending 17th Olympic gold in men's basketball.\n\nFrance, meanwhile, had to settle for a third silver in men's basketball, having also been beaten finalists at London 1948 and Sydney 2000."
