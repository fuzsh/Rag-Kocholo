        "text": "Here's all you need to know ahead of this year's French Open at Roland Garros as Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek defend their singles titles.\n\nThe second Grand Slam of the season will see the world's best players compete in Paris, with 22-time major champion Djokovic, Swiatek, Rafael Nadal, Carlos Alcaraz, Casper Ruud, Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff among those in action.\n\nThere will also be a handful of Brits taking part at the tournament, either in the main draw of qualifying, with 2016 finalist Andy Murray likely to make his final appearance at Roland Garros before his impending retirement later this summer.\n\nIs the one-handed backhand a dying art?
