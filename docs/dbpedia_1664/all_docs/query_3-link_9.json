        "text": "Athletics: Sifan Hassan (NED) wins the women's marathon!\n\nWhat an incredible climax to this race!\n\nAs the finish line edges closer, that group of five dwindles to four, then to three, until Hassan and Assefa hit the afterburners and engage in a sprint battle to the end.\n\nAnd a battle it was, for as Hassan attempted to get around Assefa, the two athletes briefly make contact as they fight for position. But Hassan's kick is stronger, and the Dutchwoman pulls away in the last 100m or so to win gold in a new Olympic record time of 2:22:55!\n\nIt's Hassan's third Olympic medal of Paris 2024, the sixth Olympic medal of her career, and the first ever Olympic gold in the marathon for the Netherlands.\n\nAssefa is just three seconds behind to win silver, while bronze goes to Hellen Obiri, her third Olympic medal after winning two silvers at Rio 2016 on the track.\n\nðŸ¥‡****Sifan Hassan (NED): 2:22:55 OR\n\nðŸ¥ˆTigst Assefa (ETH): 2:22:58\n\nðŸ¥‰Hellen Obiri (KEN): 2:23:10\n\nAthletics: Marathon runners prepare for sharp climb\n\nThe athletes are about to tackle the steepest hill of the marathon, and this is where a winner could step to the fore - just as Tamirat Tola (KEN) did yesterday in the men's race.\n\nJust before they start their climb the runners take on water and energy drinks - vitally important as the Parisian sun blazes down on them.\n\nWe even have some brave spectators who are running alongside them on the other side of the barriers!\n\nI wonder if they can keep pace...\n\nWhat else is happening on Day 16 of Paris 2024?\n\nWhile the women's marathon is ongoing, here's what else you can expect from the final day of Paris 2024.\n\nThe last 13 gold medals will be awarded before the Closing Ceremony in the evening at the Stade de France.\n\nAt the Bercy Arena, the women's basketball final (3:30pm) will be the final event of the entire Games. Team USA will be expected to win their eighth straight title.\n\nCycling (track) - Jason Kenny's successor to be anointed\n\nAt the Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines Velodrome, the last three track cycling finals will take place, including in the men's keirin (1:32pm).\n\nThe two-time defending champion, Jason Kenny, has retired from the sport, meaning there will be a new champion in the event. British riders have won gold at this event since Beijing 2008, with Chris Hoy winning the two before Kenny.\n\nThose are big shoes for Jack Carlin or Hamish Turnbull to fill. Colombia's Kevin Quintero, who was one of his country's Opening Ceremony flag-bearers, is the reigning world champion and will attempt to win the first Colombian track cycling gold.\n\nClosing Ceremony brings curtain down\n\nAfter all the events are done, it is time to finally celebrate the previous 16 days. The Stade de France will host the Closing Ceremony (9pm), a chance for the athletes to mingle amongst themselves and reflect on another Olympic Games.\n\nPlus there will be the much-anticipated handover from Paris 2024 to Los Angeles 2028.\n\nAnd as the Olympic Cauldron is extinguished, attention will turn towards the Paralympic Games, which open on 28 August, and Milano Cortina 2026, the next Olympic Winter Games, in barely a year and a half.\n\nMedal events\n\nAthletics (track and field)\n\n08:00â€“11:30: W marathon\n\nBasketball\n\n11:30â€“13:30: W bronze medal game; 15:30â€“17:30: W gold medal game\n\nCycling (track)\n\n12:45â€“13:21: W sprint finals race 1, race 2; 13:32â€“13:38: M keirin final; 13:44â€“13:46: W sprint finals decider if required; 13:56â€“14:25: W omnium points race\n\nHandball\n\n09:00â€“11:00: M bronze medal match; 13:30â€“15:30: M gold medal match\n\nModern pentathlon\n\n12:40â€“13:00: W final laser run\n\nVolleyball\n\n13:00â€“15:30: W gold medal match\n\nWater polo\n\n10:35â€“12:05: M bronze medal match; 14:00â€“15:30: M gold medal match\n\nWeightlifting\n\n11:30â€“13:38: W +81kg\n\nWrestling\n\n12:00â€“12:35: M freestyle 65kg medal finals; 12:35â€“13:20: M freestyle 97kg medal finals; 13:20â€“13:55: W freestyle 76kg medal finals\n\n21:00â€“23:15: Closing Ceremony\n\nFull daily schedule here.\n\nAthletics: Women's marathon underway!\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the final day of the Olympic Games Paris 2024!\n\nThe women's marathon has just started, with 92 athletes vying to be called Olympic marathon champion. It's very early in the race, but the initial tempo that the lead athletes are setting is quite respectable and a few women are already falling away from this main pack.\n\nPeres Jepchirchir (KEN) is the defending champion and will attempt to become the first woman to win two gold medals in the Olympic marathon.\n\nThe Parisian streets are packed with fans who are cheering on all the runners. We seem to have the flags of all 40 nations in the field represented among the crowd, which makes for a wonderful view."
