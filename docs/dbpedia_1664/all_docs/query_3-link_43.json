        "text": "Tim Clayton/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nThe rain can't seem to stay away from Roland Garros.\n\nAll matches from the women's draw were completed on Friday, while three matches on the men's side were postponed and will continue tomorrow.\n\nOn the men's side, No. 2 seed Jannik Sinner defeated Pavel Kotov in three sets.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz and Stefanos Tsitsipasr also won their matches in straight sets.\n\nIn perhaps the biggest surprise of the day, No. 6 seed Andrey Rublev fell to Matteo Arnaldi in three sets.\n\nIn the women's draw, results went as expected, with Iga Swiatek returning to her dominant ways and Coco Gauff winning in straight sets.\n\nFrey/TPN/Getty Images\n\nNo. 2 seed Jannik Sinner and No. 3 seed Carlos Alcaraz both played on Friday, each winning in three sets.\n\nSinner hit 36 winners to just 21 unforced errors, while winning 79% of first-serve points.\n\nSinner has dominated each match, winning all three in straight sets.\n\nAlcaraz faced a tougher opponent in No. 27 seed Sebastian Korda, though he was able to get back to his signature play, overcoming everything his opponent put in his way.\n\nIn the bottom half of the draw, Alcaraz and Sinner each look like firm favorites and should be expected to face each other in the semifinals.\n\nIan MacNicol/Getty Images\n\nAfter staring down defeat on a match point against Naomi Osaka in her second-round match, Iga Swiatek was able to rebound in dominating fashion, winning in straight sets.\n\nSwiatek, who struggled against Osaka, played a much cleaner match in the third round, committing just 19 unforced errors.\n\nThe No. 1 seed should continue to coast through her portion of the draw until a potential match with Coco Gauff in the semifinals.\n\nSpeaking of Coco Gauff, the No. 3 seed defeated No. 30 Dayana Yastremska in straight sets today.\n\nWhile Gauff has yet to drop a set this tournament, she has double-faulted at least four times in her three matches.\n\nAs her quest to dethrone Swiatek continues, these numbers will no doubt have to change if the young American is going to have any chance."
