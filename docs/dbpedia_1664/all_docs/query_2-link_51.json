        "text": "Shooter Manu Bhaker headlined India’s result for the third day in a row at the Paris 2024 Olympics. Partnering Sarabjot Singh, she advanced to the 10m air pistol mixed team bronze medal match after the duo finished third in the qualification round.\n\nRamita Jindal and Arjun Babuta, however, fell short of an Olympic podium in their respective 10m air rifle finals on Monday.\n\nIn badminton, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty confirmed India’s first men’s doubles quarter-finals spot in their second Olympic appearance. Lakshya Sen won his men’s singles match to stay in quarters contention.\n\nAshwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto, on the other hand, suffered back-to-back defeats and will not make the last eight in the women’s doubles.\n\nWith a late goal, Harmanpreet Singh rescued a point for India in the men’s hockey Pool B clash against Argentina.\n\nManika Batra, meanwhile, became the first Indian table tennis player to make the round of 16 in a singles competition at the Olympics.\n\nHowever, contrary to expectations, the Indian men’s archery team delivered an underwhelming performance and lost their quarter-finals clash against Turkiye.\n\nTable tennis: Manika Batra breezes into round of 16\n\nIndia's Manika Batra beat home favourite Prithika Pavade in the table tennis women's singles round of 32 at the Paris 2024 Olympics. The 29-year-old Batra became the first Indian table tennis player to make the round of 16 in the Olympics.\n\nBatra, a Commonwealth Games champion, won 11-9, 11-6, 11-9, 11-7 against her 18th-ranked French counterpart after 37 minutes at the South Paris Arena. The Indian table tennis ace overcame a two-point deficit in the first game, followed by a comfortable second. Despite the 19-year-old Pavade's resistance in the final two games, the world No. 28 held her nerve to advance in the last 16.\n\nBatra will face eighth seed Miu Hirano (Japan) or unseeded Zhu Chengzhu (Hong Kong China) in the women's singles pre-quarterfinals.\n\nScore: Manika Batra beat Prithika Pavade 4-0 in table tennis women's singles round of 32 match.\n\nComing up... Manika Batra's table tennis singles R32 match\n\nAce Indian table tennis player Manika Batra will take on France's Prithika Pavade in the women's singles round of 32 match at 12:30 AM IST tonight. It is India's final event of Day 3 at the Paris Olympics 2024.\n\nBatra, seeded 18th at Paris 2024, beat Anna Hursey of Great Britain 4-1 at the South Paris Arena on Sunday.\n\nAt Tokyo 2020, Batra became the first female table tennis player from India to reach the round of 32 in singles at an Olympics, a feat replicated in Paris. Her Gold Coast 2018 gold was historic too, making Batra the first Indian player to medal in women's singles at the Commonwealth Games.\n\nThe 12th-seeded Pavade, making her second Summer Games appearance, won 4-1 against the Islamic Republic of Iran's Neda Shahsavari on Sunday.\n\n\"Need to work more on myself\" - Indian archer Dhiraj Bommadevara\n\nDhiraj Bommadevara was a part of the Indian men's archery team that lost to Turkiye in the quarter-final earlier today.\n\nBommadevara, who finished fourth in the individual ranking round on Thursday, registered the lowest score among the Indian trio at the Les Invalides in the quarters. His final shot, marked at seven, turned out to be crucial in the fourth set.\n\nSpeaking after the defeat, Bommadevara said, \"I need to work more on myself and really, thanks to my teammates for believing in me. I will learn from these situations and try not to repeat my mistakes and get back stronger.\n\n“The main thing is to focus on myself rather than other situations. The second thing is to make decisions about the wind. After making decisions today, what happened is I didn’t believe in my decision. Small things count and every single arrow. I’m sure I’m coming back from it,\" the Asian Games 2023 silver medallist added.\n\nThe Republic of Korea’s stunning archery record\n\nJeon Hun-young, Lim Si-hyeon and Nam Su-hyeon continued the Republic of Korea’s legacy in the women’s team archery Olympic competition on Sunday.\n\nAt Paris 2024, the trio beat the People’s Republic of China team to win the gold medal in the women’s archery competition.\n\nSince the inception of this event at the Olympics at Seoul 1988, all 10 gold medals have been bagged by the Republic of Korea!\n\nThe men's team, meanwhile, clinched their seventh title on Monday after winning the gold medal match against hosts France. They have failed to stand on an Olympic podium only once - Barcelona 1992.\n\nIndian men's hockey team captain Harmanpreet Singh calls for improvement in finishing\n\nHarmanpreet Singh, the Indian captain, converted a crucial penalty corner in the penultimate minute of the men's hockey Pool B against Argentina on Monday and earned his team a vital point at Paris 2024.\n\nIndia threatened to score throughout the match. While the finishing wasn't up to the mark, the Argentine goalkeeper also made seven saves.\n\nSpeaking on his team's performance, Harmanpreet said, \"That was a good comeback. We've been fighting until the last whistle, we had so many chances. We're glad that we scored a goal.\"\n\n\"We created some chances, but the finishing was not there. In the next game we need to focus on our finishing. I think we were carrying the ball very well and getting into the circle. The finishing should be there,” stated the Indian captain.\n\nNovak Djokovic trumps Rafael Nadal in blockbuster tennis clash\n\nSerbia's Novak Djokovic beat Spaniard Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-4 in the men's singles second round match at the Paris 2024 Olympics on Monday.\n\nIn a much-anticipated clash at the Court Philippe-Chatrier, top-seeded Djokovic won the first set comfortably in 39 minutes.\n\nNadal, an Olympic champion, however, stepped up his performance in the second set. But despite notching more points on the first serve and a higher break point conversion rate, Nadal lost the set to the Beijing 2008 bronze medallist.\n\nBoasting an incredible record at Roland Garros, 14-time French Open champion Nadal has lost just five out of 117 matches on these courts. Three of those defeats, interestingly, have been against Djokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam winner.\n\nDjokovic, meanwhile, has now won 31 of his 60 matches against Nadal in men's singles tennis.\n\nScore: Novak Djokovic won 6-1, 6-4 against Rafael Nadal in round two of the tennis men's singles.\n\nArchery: India go down to Turkiye in men's team quarters\n\nThe Indian men's archery team, Dhiraj Bommadevara, Tarundeep Rai and Pravin Jadhav, lost 6-2 to Turkiye and were knocked out in the quarter-finals at the Paris 2024 Olympics on Monday.\n\nThe Indian trio were outscored 57-53 and 55-52 in the first two sets at Les Invalides. While the third set also seemed to be going Turkiye's way, Berkim Tumer misfired a seven in their penultimate shot, allowing India to take the set.\n\nIn the final set, Jadhav shot two 10s but Bommadevara, a two-time World Cup bronze medallist, hit only a seven in the team's final attempt. Mete Gazoz, the reigning Olympic individual champion, followed with a 10 as Turkiye won the fourth set 58-54.\n\nIndia were also defeated in the women's team archery quarter-finals on Sunday.\n\nScore: India lost 6-2 against Turkiye in the archery men's team quarter-finals.\n\nSatwik-Chirag advance to badminton quarters\n\nIndian men's doubles pair Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty booked their place in the quarter-finals of the Paris Olympics 2024 on Monday.\n\nThe Indian duo have confirmed a spot in the top eight following Lucas Corvee-Ronan Labar's defeat against Muhammad Rian Ardianto-Fajar Alfian in Group C earlier today.\n\nFeaturing in their second Summer Games, Satwik-Chirag scripted history by becoming the first Indian badminton doubles pair to advance to the quarter-finals at the Olympics.\n\nSatwik-Chirag will play Ardianto-Alfian in their final group match on July 30 (tomorrow) at 5:30 PM IST before stepping out at the La Chapelle Arena in the last eight on August 1.\n\nBadminton: Lakshya Sen passes Belgian challenge\n\nIn the Group L men's singles badminton match, India's Lakshya Sen overcame Belgian shuttler Julien Carraggi's challenge in straight sets at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nWorld No. 18 Sen, a former Youth Olympics silver medallist, won 21-19, 21-14 after 43 minutes at the La Chapelle Arena on Monday. While Sen had to turn over a four-point deficit to clinch the first game, the Indian badminton player was in complete command in the second over his 52nd-ranked opponent.\n\nOn Sunday, Lakshya Sen's result against Guatemala's Kevin Cordon, a victory, was deleted, as per BWF General Competition Regulations for group stage play, after the latter pulled out of the Paris 2024 Olympics due to a left elbow injury.\n\nThe 22-year-old Sen will take on third seed Jonatan Christie, 26, in his final Group L match on Wednesday, July 31 at 1:40 PM IST. A win against his Indonesian opponent will take Sen through to the pre-quarterfinals as the group winner.\n\nGet India's Paris 2024 badminton tournament results here.\n\nScore: Lakshya Sen beat Julien Carraggi 21-19, 21-14 in badminton men's singles Group L match.\n\nHockey: India snatch late draw vs Argentina\n\nThe Indian men's hockey team, who trailed for the majority of the Pool B match on Monday, shared the points with Argentina at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nLos Leones took a 1-0 lead in the second quarter against the record Olympic champions, courtesy of forward Lucas Martinez. But Indian captain Harmanpreet Singh smashed a penalty corner in the penultimate minute, earning his team a draw at the Yves-du-Manoir Stadium.\n\nIn the third quarter, Argentina had an opportunity to make it a two-goal lead. However, Maico Casella Schuth put the penalty stroke wide of PR Sreejesh's goal.\n\nIndia edged the possession 55-45 in their second Paris 2024 contest while also making 17 attacking circle penetrations, four more than Argentina. But the Tokyo 2020 bronze medallists found it difficult to beat Argentine shot-stopper Tomas Santiago, who made seven saves.\n\nIndia, who beat New Zealand 3-2 on Saturday, are currently third in the men's hockey Pool B standings with four points. Only the top four teams from both groups will make the quarter-finals at Paris 2024.\n\nScore: India draw 1-1 against Argentina in men's hockey Pool B match.\n\nShooting: Arjun Babuta falls short of 10m air rifle podium\n\nIndian shooter Arjun Babuta finished fourth in the men's 10m air rifle final at the Paris 2024 Olympics on Monday.\n\nScoring 208.4, Babuta was in medal contention for the majority of the first stage and early in the second stage. The 25-year-old, however, marked a 9.5 in his final attempt to fall 1.4 short of medal contention.\n\nBabuta, a two-time gold medallist at the Changwon World Cup in 2022, made his Olympic debut at Paris 2024. He also featured in the mixed team event, alongside Ramita Jindal, where India ranked sixth.\n\nEarlier today, Ramita also failed to make the women's 10m air rifle podium in Paris.\n\nSheng Lihao from the People's Republic of China, meanwhile, upgraded Tokyo 2020 silver to gold at Paris 2024 while scoring 252.2.

The former Indian men's cricket team head coach was a part of a panel discussion organized by Dream Sports in the French capital.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Dravid congratulated Manu Bhaker, India's first medallist at Paris 2024, for her bronze medal in the women's 10m air pistol event.\n\n\"To come here and to be able to get over her past failures and win a bronze medal is a phenomenal achievement which takes years of sacrifice,\" said Dravid. \"The Olympics is the pinnacle of a lot of sports.

The Indian duo had lost in straight games to the Republic of Korea's Kim So Yeong and Kong Hee Yong on Saturday.\n\nThe Republic of Korea team beat Australia's Setyana Mapasa and Angela Yu later in the day. As a result, Crasto-Ponnappa will not make the quarter-finals of the women's doubles competition at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nScore: Tanisha Crasto-Ashwini Ponnappa lost 21-11, 21-12 against Nami Matsuyama and Chiharu Shida in badminton women's doubles Group C match.\n\nOn this day in 1980: India's latest men's hockey gold\n\nThe Indian men's hockey team beat Spain 4-3 in the final at Moscow 1980, 44 years ago, to clinch the Olympic title.
