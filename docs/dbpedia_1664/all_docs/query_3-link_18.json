        "text": "Rafael Nadal will not appear at the U.S. Open after all.\n\nWhen his name landed on the entry list for the year’s final Grand Slam earlier this summer, Nadal raised hopes that he might appear in New York, perhaps for the last time in a storied career that is winding down.\n\nLate Wednesday, Nadal announced on social media that he would not play in the tournament, which begins Aug. 26.\n\n“I will miss those electric and special night sessions in NYC at Ashe,” Nadal wrote, referring the Arthur Ashe Stadium, the main court at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, “but I don’t think I would be able to give my 100% this time.”\n\nNadal, who played several clay court tournaments this spring and summer, including the Olympic Games, did not indicate what was keeping him from being able to give his best. He also chose not to play Wimbledon, fearing that switching to grass after the French Open and then back to clay for the Olympics at Roland Garros in Paris would put his now-fragile physique in jeopardy.\n\nPlaying at the U.S. Open always seemed like a long shot. He has won the tournament four times, most recently in 2019, but hard courts can be especially wearing and Nadal has suffered from a series of injuries the past two seasons — a cracked rib, an abdominal tear, multiple hip injuries that required surgery, another injury to the hip area, and a back issue.\n\nLast year, Nadal said this would likely be his last as a professional player, but he has remained noncommittal on that front in recent months. He has suggested that if he is still enjoying playing, he might not stop. He refused to announce any concrete stop date last week when he lost in straight sets to Novak Djokovic in the second round of the Olympic tournament.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nRafael Nadal got closer to the tennis swansong he wants. Is it as close as he gets?\n\nHowever, his results have never gotten to the level where he would like them to be. He lost early in most of the top-level tournaments he managed to play this spring, including the French Open, which he has won 14 times. Alexander Zverev, the No. 4 seed, beat him in the first round. At the time, he said there was a “big chance” that it would be his last time playing in the French Open, but left the door open for another appearance.\n\nHe said Wednesday that his next tournament would be the Laver Cup, the team event that his good friend, Roger Federer, created as a tennis version of golf’s Ryder Cup. That will take place in late September in Berlin.\n\nJudging from his words Wednesday, though, a U.S. Open appearance down the road seemed doubtful.\n\n“Thanks to all my US fans in particular,” he said, “will miss you all and will see you another time.”\n\nNadal’s withdrawal came on the same day the USTA announced the prize money pool for this year’s U.S. Open, which will be $75 million — a Grand Slam tournament record. This beats its own record of $65 million from 2023.\n\nPlayers that reach the first round will be guaranteed $100,000 and the champions in the men’s and women’s singles draws will be awarded $3.6 million, up from $3 million in 2023.\n\nIt trumps this year’s Wimbledon prize money of just over $64.4 million.\n\nRequired reading\n\nRafael Nadal’s Olympics defeat was so close to the tennis swansong he craves — but so far\n\nWhat’s it like to play Rafael Nadal on clay?
