        "text": "Key events\n\nShow key events only\n\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\n\nShare\n\nRight that’s it from me for today. Do join us tomorrow for coverage of the men’s semi-finals, as Jannik Sinner aims to make it two Italians in the singles finals, as he takes on Carlos Alcaraz, and Alexander Zverev faces Casper Ruud. Can’t wait. Who needs Djokovic, Nadal and Federer? Bye!\n\nShare\n\nSo does Paolini have a chance against Swiatek? Well … at least she’s playing well enough and with enough confidence to hopefully make it interesting. But Swiatek is the strong, strong favourite to extend her Roland Garros supremacy to a third consecutive year. Swiatek leads the head-to-head 2-0, with Paolini winning a combined total of only six games – though that first match was six years ago, so we can’t read too much into that.\n\nAs for Andreeva, it’s a tough loss for her given the way she fell away in the second set, but it’s a learning experience for the 17-year-old for sure. Her time will come. And her first grand slam semi-final means she’ll be in the top 25 when the new world rankings are announced on Monday.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.09 CEST\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nA beaming Paolini says:\n\nIt was a tough match, she’s playing unbelievable at 17, she’s so complete, so I was a bit nervous before the match. I lost against her one month ago so I was like, come on, you have to do better.\n\nToday I was nervous in the first set but ball after ball I was getting relaxed. I’m really happy I managed to win the match at the end.\n\nI learnt a little bit later than other players but to dream is the most important thing in sport and in life. I don’t know what to say, I’m so emotional.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 18.38 CEST\n\nNext up for Paolini: the unenviable task of facing Iga Swiatek in Saturday’s final. Which is an all-Polish final of sorts given that Paolini’s mother is of Polish descent. Not that Italy will be having any of that.\n\nShare\n\nPaolini beats Andreeva 6-3, 6-1!\n\nThis is the first time in the Open era that Italian players have reached the French Open semi-finals in the men’s and women’s singles. Paolini says she’s been inspired by what Jannik Sinner has achieved this year … and the Italian renaissance has well and truly hit Paris because Paolini has three match points at 0-40! Paolini runs forward to the short ball – and completes the victory! No nerves there! The hugely likeable 28-year-old is into her first grand slam final having never been beyond the second round of a major before this year!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 18.32 CEST\n\nPaolini 6-3, 5-1 Andreeva*\n\nA first ace from Paolini at the perfect moment, 15-30 down on serve, to scramble back to 30-all. But here’s a break point! “Come on, you’re going to do this, come on,” urges Martinez, Andreeva’s coach, aware that Andreeva hasn’t converted a single one in this match. A drop shot from Paolini … Andreeva chases it down but Paolini reads which way Andreeva is going … and puts away the volley! Deuce. Advantage Paolini after great hustle from Paolini. Jeu Paolini. She’s a game away!\n\nShare\n\nPaolini breaks: Paolini* 6-3, 4-1 Andreeva\n\nIt’s not quite the end game yet for Andreeva, but time is starting to run out. 15-30. 15-40. Two points for Paolini to get a double break – which would give her a bit of breathing space as she seeks to serve this out to reach her first grand slam final. And Andreeva is almost in tears when she makes another error to give Paolini the break.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nPaolini breaks: Paolini 6-3, 3-1 Andreeva*\n\nAndreeva displays good aggression to get to 30-all on Paolini’s serve. She looks a little out of breath after her efforts and lets Paolini move to 40-30, and Andreeva has her head in her hands when she misdirects a backhand wide.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nPaolini breaks: Paolini* 6-3, 2-1 Andreeva\n\nThis is getting messy for Andreeva. A first double fault from the Russian and she slumps to 0-40 on serve. Paolini is 1/1 on break points; Andreeva is 0/5. It’s very nearly a second double – Martinez can barely watch in the box – but the serve just drops in and Paolini prods long. 15-40. 30-40, after a delicate drop shot and lovely angled volley. But Andreeva dumps her backhand into the net and Paolini has the second-set break to add to her one-set advantage!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 18.11 CEST\n\nPaolini 6-3, 1-1 Andreeva*\n\nAndreeva, remember, came from a set down in her quarter-final yesterday against Aryna Sabalenka – who was admittedly ailing – but it will give the Russian belief that she has the ability to produce a similar turnaround here. But it’s disappointing from Andreeva as she gets to 30-all on Paolini’s serve – before letting the Italian off the hook. “I’m trying,” an anguished Andreeva exclaims to her box.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.12 CEST\n\nPaolini* 6-3, 0-1 Andreeva\n\nAndreeva, the youngest grand slam semi-finalist since a 16-year-old Martina Hingis in 1997, leaves the court briefly after losing that first set to gather her thoughts. It does the trick, as she advances to 40-15. But Paolini is a pocket rocket on the next point, drive-volleying Andreeva into submission. Paolini is playing with more power than her much taller opponent. Paolini has said her form this year is the result of a more fearless approach – and she’s certainly demonstrating that here.\n\nShare\n\nPaolini wins the first set 6-3!\n\nYou wouldn’t know this is Paolini’s first slam semi-final. She looks nerveless on her way to 30-0. There’s a look of frustration from Andreeva towards her coach, Conchita Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion, when Paolini brings up two set points at 40-15. And Andreeva isn’t able to make Paolini work for it because Andreeva’s return loops long!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.12 CEST\n\nPaolini* 5-3 Andreeva\n\nSo Andreeva is serving to stay in this set. There are several chances here for Andreeva to come forward and finish the points – but she stays rooted to the baseline. Not the best tactic against an opponent who would be happy to scurry around the court until tomorrow. She doesn’t want to be playing Paolini at her own game. But Andreeva does come through from 30-all.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nPaolini 5-2 Andreeva*\n\nAndreeva started playing tennis only 11 years ago, at the age of six. Remarkable to think how much she has achieved already. Paolini charges to 15-0, 30-0, 40-0. But three well-crafted points from Andreeva – her high intelligence on the court belies her age – and it’s deuce. Advantage Andreeva, her fourth break point of the match. But this one comes and goes too. Andreeva hits the clay off her shoes in frustration. Advantage Andreeva, her fifth chance. Paolini forces Andreeva to hit a deep backhand and then sends Andreeva on a fruitless diagonal charge forward to a drop shot. Deuce. Paolini clips the sideline with a forehand winner and somehow survives with the hold!\n\nShare\n\nPaolini* 4-2 Andreeva\n\nThe longest rally of this encounter so far – 19 shots – and Andreeva emerges victorious. 30-0. But a 12th unforced error from the Russian prodigy – Paolini has hit only four – and it’s 30-15. 40-15, but Paolini really should have done better. Paolini makes amends with her third winner. 40-30. And has the sniff of a double break when Andreeva snatches at her shot and nets. Deuce. But it becomes no more than that because Andreeva gets to advantage and then pulls off a second-serve ace!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 17.50 CEST\n\nPaolini 4-1 Andreeva*\n\nAndreeva resets straight away, and brings up two break-back points at 15-40. Some superb defence from Paolini saves the first. She’ll run and run all day if she has to. The Italian grinder has the smallest stature at 5’4” but the biggest heart. And a poor return from Andreeva sees the second break point go begging too. Deuce. A high-class rally follows, now it’s Andreeva’s turn to show her defensive skills, and Andreeva has a third break point. Andreeva looks to have clinched it when Paolini’s forehand clips the net … but it somehow trickles over! Deuce. Advantage Paolini. Game Paolini, as Andreeva makes her 11th unforced error in only five games.\n\nShare\n\nPaolini breaks: *Paolini 3-1 Andreeva\n\nPaolini stunned the 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the quarter-finals yesterday, while Andreeva accounted for the reigning Australian Open champion and No 2 seed Aryna Sabalenka. Both, perhaps, are relieved to be playing again today, without a day off. Less time for them to think and for the nerves to set in. But neither are quite settled yet, it’s been stop-start so far. Paolini gains the first break point of the match at 30-40 on Andreeva’s serve, and Andreeva’s forehand fails. Paolini, the 12th seed, has the first break!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 17.32 CEST\n\nPaolini 2-1 Andreeva*\n\nApparently this is the biggest age gap in a Roland Garros women’s semi-final since a 30-year-old Chris Evert beat a 15-year-old Gabriela Sabatini in 1985. Andreeva wraps up a hold with a winning volley, and is doing her best to put the older player in her place, as she starts swinging to get to 0-30 on Paolini’s serve. Paolini pegs her back to 30-all, and then the Italian edges ahead of her Russian opponent for 40-30. And game.\n\nShare\n\nPaolini 1-0 Andreeva*\n\nMost of the crowd have left for a quick break, but no time for one on this live blog, because after the semi-final that everyone predicted from the start of the tournament, we’re on to the one that absolutely no one did. Paolini is serving first against Andreeva, and moves without any fuss to 40-15. Which is jeu when Andreeva goes wide.\n\nYou’d think the 28-year-old Paolini would have more experience than her 17-year-old opponent at this stage of a slam – but not so. Both are playing in their first major semi-final. Paolini had never been beyond the second round of a major before this year, while Andreeva reached the last 16 both at Wimbledon last summer and the Australian Open earlier this year.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 17.34 CEST\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nSo it’s 20 consecutive match wins at Roland Garros for Swiatek, a third successive final here and a fourth overall. She’s not at Nadal’s levels yet, but she’s accumulating quite some record at Roland Garros, and will be the overwhelming favourite in the final against Mirra Andreeva or Jasmine Paolini. They’re up next – and have just stepped on to court to warm up. When you look at those stats there’s absolutely no shame for Gauff in losing to Swiatek today; Swiatek is simply the best clay-court player in the business. At least Gauff has the consolation of knowing that she’ll be the new world No 2 next week. But after her 11th defeat in 12 against Swiatek, she’s going to have to figure out how to cause Swiatek more problems away from Swiatek’s favoured clay courts.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek speaks:\n\nIt was intense. In the second set it was tight because we were breaking each other. I was consistent with my tactics and went for it.\n\nI think Coco is progressing a lot, you can see by her results. Last year’s US Open shows she’s tough, she’s going to grow, so it’s nice to see her handling well everything around her. I’m sure we’re going to have many more matches at the highest level.\n\nSomething changed [after the second-round match against Naomi Osaka]. I didn’t have time to get into the match. After that, the weather changed, which helped my game, and I gained confidence.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 16.59 CEST\n\nSwiatek beats Gauff 6-2, 6-4!\n\nSwiatek, though, does now have the match on her racket, as she steps up to serve for a place in the final. 15-0. 15-all. The crowd are urging Gauff on here, they want more of this. The umpire is out of her chair on the next point to confirm that Gauff’s shot was indeed wide. 30-15. 40-15, when Gauff goes for broke on the return. Two more match points to add to Swiatek’s two from the previous game.\n\nFrom Swiatek’s second serve, Gauff hits a deep, deep return, then into one corner, then the other, this is brave, brave hitting from the 20-year-old, and she saves a third match point! Can she save the fourth too? Swiatek aborts her ball toss – there’s a sign of nerves – and her first serve lands long. But the second serve goes in, and Gauff ends with her 39th unforced error! For the third year in a row, Gauff falls to the world No 1 at Roland Garros and Swiatek is into her fourth French Open final!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 16.53 CEST\n\nSwiatek* 6-2, 5-4 Gauff\n\nGauff sees Swiatek’s winner on the previous point and raises it with a winner of her own … advantage Gauff … but Gauff then hits beyond the baseline! Chris Evert reckons Swiatek is winning about three-quarters of the longer rallies. Gauff could do with a couple of quick points here. The next one is speedy – but it doesn’t end in her favour, because she nets. Advantage Swiatek, a second match point. Swiatek misdirects her forehand! Deuce. Advantage Gauff. GAME GAUFF! THIS MATCH ISN’T ENDING JUST YET!\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek 6-2, 5-3 Gauff*\n\nSo Gauff must hold here to remain in this semi-final. It starts well for her. 15-0, 30-0. But then there’s a vicious forehand from Swiatek – Gauff has barely finished her swing when Swiatek takes the ball on the rise and cracks it back, giving Gauff absolutely no time to breathe – 30-15. 40-15, after a second uncharacteristic mis-hit in this game from Swiatek. 40-30. Again just as Gauff thinks she’s getting away, Swiatek reels her back in. Deuce.\n\nThat’s 35 unforced errors from Gauff now compared with Swiatek’s 12 – if you can call Gauff’s unforced errors given her formidable opponent. And a 36th of the affair gives Swiatek her first match point. The pair go down the middle, then cross-court, then down the middle, and Gauff saves her best until nearly last with a gutsy inside-out forehand winner! Deuce. Advantage Gauff courtesy of a stinging serve down the middle. Deuce, as the game reaches nearly eight minutes …\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek 6-2, 5-3 Gauff*\n\nThat’s three games in a row for Swiatek, after Gauff had led 3-1, as the three-times champion restores order in her Philippe Chatrier kingdom. The King of Clay may be no more – but we’re watching the Queen of Clay here. Swiatek moves within a game of her third successive Roland Garros final when Gauff can only send her return into the net. Make that four games in a row.\n\nShare"
