        "meta_description": "Coco Gauff, Novak Djokovic and other players at the U.S. Open will be playing for a record total of $75 million in compensation at the year’s last Grand Slam tennis tournament. That is a rise of $10 million from a year ago. The U.S. Tennis Association announced Wednesday that the women’s and men’s singles champions will each receive $3.6 million in 2024. The total compensation includes money to cover players’ expenses. The full compensation puts the U.S. Open ahead of the sport’s other three major championships this season. Play begins at Flushing Meadows on Aug. 26.",

        "text": "Coco Gauff, Novak Djokovic and other players at the U.S. Open will be playing for a record total of $75 million in compensation at the year’s last Grand Slam tennis tournament, a rise of about 15% from a year ago.\n\nThe women’s and men’s singles champions will each receive $3.6 million, the U.S. Tennis Association announced Wednesday.\n\nThe total compensation, which includes money to cover players’ expenses, rises $10 million from the $65 million in 2023 and was touted by the USTA as “the largest purse in tennis history.”\n\nThe full compensation puts the U.S. Open ahead of the sport’s other three major championships in 2024. Based on currency exchange figures at the times of the events, Wimbledon offered about $64 million in prizes, with the French Open and Australian Open both at about $58 million.\n\nThe champions’ checks jump 20% from last year’s $3 million, but the amount remains below the pre-pandemic paycheck of $3.85 million that went to each winner in 2019.\n\nLast year at Flushing Meadows, Gauff won her first Grand Slam title, and Djokovic earned his 24th, extending his record for the most by a man in tennis history.\n\nPlay in the main draws for singles begins on Aug. 26 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and concludes with the women’s final on Sept. 7 and the men’s final on Sept. 8.\n\nThere are increases in every round of the main draw and in qualifying.\n\nPlayers exiting the 128-person brackets in the first round of the main event for women’s and men’s singles get $100,000 each for the first time, up from $81,500 in 2023 and from $58,000 in 2019.\n\nIn doubles, the champions will get $750,000 per team; that number was $700,000 a year ago.\n\nThere won’t be a wheelchair competition at Flushing Meadows this year because the dates of the Paralympic Games in Paris overlap with the U.S. Open. So the USTA is giving player grants to the players who would have been in the U.S. Open field via direct entry.\n\n___\n\nA previous version of this story was corrected to fix the total compensation amount to $75 million in the headline and the 2019 winners’ paychecks to $3.85 million.\n\n___\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.
