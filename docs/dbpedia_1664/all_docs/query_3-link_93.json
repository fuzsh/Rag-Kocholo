She was able to reach the championship game two years ago, but lost to the first seed. So, she is trying to avenge that loss in this year’s event.\n\nSince that defeat, Gauff has greatly improved and obtained some hardware in women’s singles. This includes a 2023 US Open championship, which was her first major title.\n\nGauff is currently one of the best female tennis players in the world, as she entered the 2024 French Open as the third seed. Fans can watch her compete in the quarterfinal round tomorrow for free online by using DirecTV Stream and Fubo TV.\n\n2024 French Open women’s singles schedule\n\nQuarterfinals on June 4:\n\n#3 Coco Gauff vs #8 Ons Jabeur\n\n#1 Iga Świątek vs #5 Markéta Vondroušová\n\nQuarterfinals on June 5:\n\n#4 Elena Rybakina vs #12 Jasmine Paolini\n\n#2 Aryna Sabalenka vs Mirra Andreeva\n\nSemifinals on June 6:\n\n#1 Iga Świątek vs #3 Coco Gauff\n\n#12 Jasmine Paolini vs Mirra Andreeva\n\nFinals on June 8:"
