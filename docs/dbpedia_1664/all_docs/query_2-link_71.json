        "text": "Dear New Jersey,\n\nI've never claimed to be morally superior to anyone else.\n\nI generally keep my opinions to myself and go about my life.\n\nRecently, though, there was an incident that not only left me fuming but also made me question people in general.\n\nI needed to pick up a few things at the grocery store over the weekend. It was a last-minute trip at night.\n\nPulling out of my parking space, I noticed an elderly woman on a motorized scooter oddly sitting between several parked cars. It was dark in this part of the lot.\n\nI pulled up next to the woman, rolled down my window, and said, \"Ma'am, are you okay?\"\n\nShe stared at me with no answer.\n\nI got out of my car and approached a little closer. I didn't want to frighten her.\n\nAgain I asked, \"ma'am are you okay?\" Nothing. I then asked, \"Do you need help?\" Nothing.\n\nREAD MORE: New Jersey's Most Overpriced Grocery Stores\n\nThis didn't sit right with me, so I returned to my car and drove around to one of the cart attendants.\n\nThey usually have radios to communicate with the inside of the store.\n\nAs I pulled up next to the attendant, I could tell he had earbuds.\n\nI motioned to him to take them out. Before I could say anything, he said, \"You have to get a cart up front,\" and continued walking.\n\nI was irritated at this point, but it would've bothered me if I left without knowing this woman was safe.\n\nAfter seeing that the elderly woman was still sitting alone, I parked my car and returned to the store.\n\nI told the front desk employee that an elderly woman on a scooter was in a dark part of the parking lot and wasn't responding to me.\n\nThe employee responded, \"I'm sure she's fine.\"\n\nReally?\n\nI can count the number of times I've asked to speak to a manager. This was one of them.\n\nALSO READ: The Grocery Store's New Jersey Desperately Needs\n\nThe employee called for the manager with an attitude as I stood there about to explode.\n\nThe manager arrived, and he expected me to complain about something.\n\nI had plenty to complain about, but the most important thing was the woman's well-being in the parking lot.\n\nI informed the manager about what was happening, and he quickly asked me to show him where the woman was.\n\nBy the time we got out there, the woman was gone. The scooter was still there, so the manager didn't think I was making things up.\n\nHe thanked me for letting him know, and I went on my way. Hopefully, this woman is safe.\n\nDriving home, I couldn't help but think about how many people had walked past that woman and done nothing.\n\nShe wasn't hard to find. In fact, several people were just a couple of cars away.\n\nAgain, I'm not here to prop myself up for being an outstanding citizen, but how much effort does it take to check on someone who may be in distress?\n\nIs it me, or is there just less caring for others in our world?\n\nThe people of Jersey are kind and compassionate overall. Let's not let those qualities fade.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMatt Ryan"
